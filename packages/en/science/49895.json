For some years past it has\r\nbeen out of print, to the loss of more recent students. The delay,\r\nhowever, has not been without its compensations, as librarianship has\r\nmade several advances which have been generally accepted, and has made\r\nmany experiments, the issue of which is not yet decided, in the twelve\r\nyears since the publication of the second edition. The work has been\r\nregarded with much justice as the most comprehensive complete treatise\r\non library economy, and is the standard to which most British libraries\r\nconform in general; indeed, it is not too much to say that the whole\r\nmodern school of librarians here has been moulded by the work. When,\r\ntherefore, I was asked to prepare a new edition I was faced with the\r\nquestion of how best to preserve its comprehensive character. I might\r\nhave revised it conservatively, merely touching up the statistics,\r\nadding to the bibliographies, and correcting statements which have been\r\nmodified by later experience; but that would have left the book partial\r\nand incomplete. Rightly or wrongly, I have rewritten almost every\r\nchapter, have added sections on questions touched upon only lightly or\r\nnot at all in previous editions, and have omitted several statements in\r\nwhich strong personal views were expressed; in fact, I have tried to\r\npreserve everything that seemed to be of permanent value, to excise\r\neverything merely controversial, and to avoid obtruding any\r\nidiosyncrasies of my own. I cannot hope to have succeeded completely,\r\nand any suggestions for the improvement of future editions will be\r\nwelcomed.\r\n\r\nBoth of the earlier editions retain their value for students, but the\r\ncriticism which may fairly be levelled at them is that Brown rarely\r\ncontemplated the needs of a library of more than 40,000 volumes, and,\r\ntherefore, omitted much that is necessary in the administration of such\r\nlibraries. I have tried to balance this. It is perhaps desirable to set\r\nout the particulars in which the third edition differs from the second.\r\nThe following chapters have been rewritten in their entirety: IV., V.,\r\nVI., XV., XVIII., XX. and XXVII. The following are new: all Divisions\r\nI., XIII. and XIV.; and Chapters VII., XXVII., XXVIII., XXIX. and XXX.\r\nEverything else has been retouched, except the chapter on museums and\r\nart galleries; that I have left, because although the librarian ought to\r\nhave a knowledge of curatorship, that knowledge is not library economy;\r\nand, within its limits, the chapter is good common sense. I have dealt\r\ndrastically with the bibliographies, which consisted in the main of\r\nlists of articles in library periodicals. Every library student knows\r\nthat textbooks and treatises are supplemented by periodical literature,\r\nand a reference to the indexes of library journals should be an obvious\r\nthing for him to make on any subject; and seeing that we have Cannons’s\r\n_Bibliography of Library Economy_, 1876-1909, for the years covered by\r\nthe title, and that the best articles are now indexed in the Library\r\nAssociation Index, it seemed sufficient to make a general reference to\r\nCannons and otherwise restrict the lists with few exceptions to separate\r\npublications. Appendix II, “The Librarian’s Library,” has been revised\r\nby Mr Richard Wright, M.C., to whom my thanks are due. An important\r\nomission is the Appendix of “Factors and Percentages,” which gave\r\nfigures for calculating the size, cost, output, etc., of libraries. This\r\nhas been deliberate; the conditions created by the War are so fluid that\r\nfactors which are likely to have a permanent value are impossible to\r\ncompile. Brown’s _Guide to Librarianship_ gives the pre-war factors, and\r\nit is unnecessary to reprint them here.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir is based upon the obituary notices and appreciations which\r\nwere collected and edited by Mr L. Stanley Jast for _The Library\r\nAssociation Record_, the biographical facts in particular being drawn\r\nfrom the memoir by Brown’s nephew, Mr James Douglas Stewart, which is\r\nincluded in those notices. Others will share my regret that his\r\npreoccupation with his new work at Manchester prevented Mr Jast from\r\nrevising this _Manual_. I cannot but perceive, now that my work is\r\nfinished, how much better it would have been had he filled my place. A\r\nfew notes, prepared by Mr Jast for Chapters I.-II., have been included.\r\n\r\nUsually, when one has written a book, one has to acknowledge much help\r\nfrom other librarians, but, owing to the extraordinary circumstances in\r\nwhich this revision has been made, I felt that I ought not to call for\r\nhelp from others already overburdened. My own task has been completed\r\nunder great pressure, most of the work being done between 6.30 and 8.30\r\na.m. My wife has saved me from many blunders, and her experience as a\r\nformer member of Mr Brown’s staff has been most valuable to me.\r\n\r\n  W. C. BERWICK SAYERS\r\n\r\n  POSTSCRIPT.--As the final proofs are leaving my hands I learn that the\r\n  long-expected Government Bill to remove the penny rate limitation was\r\n  introduced into the House of Commons by Mr Herbert Lewis and read a\r\n  first time on the 28th of November. The second reading occurred on the\r\n  2nd of December, and the Bill became law on the 23rd of December 1919.\r\n\r\n  It is now practically certain that the powers in regard to Public\r\n  Libraries which were held by the Local Government Board now accrue to\r\n  the Ministry of Education, and, consequently, wherever the Local\r\n  Government Board is mentioned in the _Manual_, the Ministry of\r\n  Education should be understood.--W.

He concluded characteristically that this\r\nwas because the librarian was an Englishman. The lad who endeavoured to\r\nbegin what was his real life-work on this unusual day was James Duff\r\nBrown, who was to become in many ways the greatest practical influence\r\nof his time in the British public library movement, who lived through\r\nits most expansive period, codified and published its methods and\r\nresults, experimented boldly, faced and overcame a remarkable force of\r\nopposition, and left behind him a memory which present librarians\r\nrevere, and works which will not easily be forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe have no record of his earliest years, other than that he was born at\r\nEdinburgh on 6th November 1862, and during boyhood showed tenacity and\r\nmental acquisitiveness. At thirteen he became an apprentice in the\r\npublishing house of Edmonstone & Douglas in his native city, and in the\r\nsame year, when Mr Douglas left that firm at the establishment of that\r\nof Douglas & Foulis, he remained with Mr Douglas. A year later found him\r\nat Glasgow with the firm of W. R. McPhun & Sons. The work done for these\r\nfirms gave him an initiation of a kind into literature, but the earlier\r\nGlasgow period was never a happy memory of his, and his true career\r\nbegan at the Mitchell Library. Here he spent ten years, enlarging his\r\nknowledge, specializing thoroughly in librarianship, devoting much of\r\nhis leisure to musical lore, and by ability and purposefulness working\r\nhis way to responsible positions on the library staff. When he was\r\ntwenty-one he began to collect material for his _Biographical Dictionary\r\nof Musicians_, which appeared four years later in 1886; at twenty-three\r\nwas Glasgow correspondent to _The Musical Standard_; and he was the\r\neditor and reviser of the six large quarto volumes of Chalmers’s\r\n_Caledonia_ which appeared 1887-90. The industry thus shown was inherent\r\nin his character. He told Mr T. A. Aldred that he acquired the\r\nearly-rising habit in youth, and that most of his work was done in the\r\nmornings before he began his official day’s work at 9 a.m.; and the\r\nMitchell was at some distance from his home. This habit, which few of us\r\never acquire, he retained through life. It is interesting to know that\r\nhe served from 1886 to about 1888 in the Third Lanark Volunteers; a\r\nlittle booklet from his pen, _A Volunteer Reconnaissance_, records his\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nA large library, however liberally administered, does not often offer\r\nopportunities for a man’s larger initiative unless he occupies one of\r\nthe chief positions; and the exercise of his gifts did not come fully\r\nuntil his appointment in 1888 to the newly-established Clerkenwell\r\nPublic Library in London. The building is a comparatively small edifice\r\noccupying a triangular site, and hardly one in which experiments little\r\nshort of epoch-making might be expected; but Brown was a man of ideas\r\nand courage who could make the most of such a building. Moreover, London\r\noffered him openings which he did not hesitate to take. Retiring in\r\nperson as a rule, nervous in speech, and in appearance of no special\r\nsignificance, he yet threw himself with quiet energy into the work of\r\nthe Library Association. It must be remembered that from about 1888 to\r\n1898 the public library movement in England received its greatest\r\nimpetus, probably because in those years the full effects of the\r\nEducation Act of 1870 came into play. Few of the libraries founded in\r\nthat period are entirely without marks of his influence. In 1891 he\r\nconceived the idea--very old in itself, but quite new in its application\r\nto municipal libraries in this country--of throwing open the shelves to\r\nthe choice of readers; and he formulated a scheme, which he called by\r\nthe somewhat tautological name of “safe-guarded open access,” and\r\npublished it anonymously in _The Library_ in a paper entitled “A Plea\r\nfor Liberty to Readers to Help Themselves.” A visit to America in 1893,\r\nwhere he attended the Chicago Conference of the American Library\r\nAssociation as a delegate of the Library Association, confirmed him in\r\nhis opinion of the practical desirability of the system, although he\r\nsays, “There was no such thing as proper safe-guarded open access as now\r\nunderstood anywhere in America when I was there”; but free access there\r\nwas, without the locking wickets and other safeguards which he\r\nintroduced at Clerkenwell. In brief, his method was to admit readers to\r\nthe shelves, but by way of a wicket at which their credentials were\r\nchecked unobtrusively, and to allow them to pass out at another wicket\r\nat which the books chosen were charged. Thus the reader was locked in\r\nthe library while making his choice. The results of his experiment were\r\npresented to the Belfast Conference in a paper he wrote in collaboration\r\nwith one of his Committee, Mr Henry W. Fincham, entitled “The\r\nClerkenwell Open Lending Library,” which was modest and restrained in\r\ntone; but although the discussion that ensued was generous and\r\nappreciative to an extent, it was the fiercest yet known amongst\r\nlibrarians, and the question became the most contested one in our work.\r\nSo sharp were the divisions the simple suggestion created that the\r\nmunicipal library profession went into two armed camps, and friendships\r\nand good-feeling were frequently destroyed by it. It is difficult for\r\nyounger librarians to realize the courage and confidence that were\r\nneeded to champion open access twenty-five years ago against the active\r\nantagonism of 90 per cent. of the profession. There were not wanting\r\nmen, however, who were drawn to the champion, amongst them Mr L. Stanley\r\nJast, then librarian of Peterborough, Mr T. Johnston, librarian of\r\nCroydon, and Mr Brown’s own assistants, Mr Charles Riddle in particular,\r\nwho opened the first library outside London on this system at\r\nBournemouth in 1895. In 1896 Croydon adopted it, Hornsey followed in\r\n1898, and although progress was slow at first, to-day it has so far won\r\nthe battle that the opening of a new library on any other system is a\r\nmatter for surprise, and many of the more conservative libraries, even\r\nin the largest cities, have adopted it at least in some part of their\r\nsystem; moreover, the question itself has become impersonal, and no\r\nlibrarian to-day would criticize another for any views he might hold in\r\nconnexion with it. It was, as Sir J. Y. W. MacAlister declared in 1894,\r\n“the dawn of a new epoch; a hundred years hence the authorities of the\r\ngreater municipal London, which will then be carrying on the work now\r\nonly attempted by the present congeries of village communities, will\r\npass a resolution ordering a tablet to be fixed to the wall of a quaint\r\nthree-cornered building in Clerkenwell, to commemorate the fact that\r\nhere, in 1894, the revolution had begun which in a few years had changed\r\nthe entire system of public libraries throughout the land.”\r\n\r\nAlthough safe-guarded open access was the principal practical\r\ncontribution of Brown to library practice, he introduced other things of\r\ngreat importance. His _Quarterly Guide_ was the first annotated library\r\nbulletin published in England. He invented an indicator, more compact\r\nand perhaps as effective as most others, as a challenge to another\r\nsimilar inventor. He improved the sheaf catalogue, and indeed many of\r\nthe commonest appliances now in use were of his contriving. A\r\ndescription of these, and others, he gave in his _Handbook of Library\r\nAppliances_, 1892, published by the Library Association. As open access\r\nabolished the need for alphabetical indicator-keys, he was at liberty to\r\nconsider the question of catalogues radically; and he advocated the\r\nclassified catalogue and class-lists as fulfilling the needs of students\r\nand readers better than other forms. In this advocacy he secured the\r\nvigorous co-operation of Mr Jast; and in this matter also a great\r\ncontroversy ran for some years, dignified amongst librarians as “the\r\nbattle of the catalogues.” The issue is still in doubt as to the entire\r\ndesirability of the classified catalogue for all purposes and places,\r\nbut to-day the classified catalogue is certainly as common as any other\r\nform.\r\n\r\nHis brain and pen were active throughout life. In 1897 he published, in\r\nconjunction with Stephen Stratton, a _British Musical Biography_,\r\nanother valuable biographical dictionary. In 1898 he founded, and for\r\nmany years was to edit, _The Library World_, an independent and radical\r\njournal of library methodology and politics, which has held its own to\r\nthis day. Opinions of all kinds were expressed in its pages; Brown wrote\r\ninnumerable articles for it; and many librarians of present distinction\r\nfirst saw themselves in print in its pages. Especially did Brown\r\nencourage through its pages the struggles of young and unknown men at a\r\ntime when encouragement was of priceless value to them. A list of his\r\nworks is given at the end of this chapter, and will be sufficient to\r\nshow his energy; but the appearance of his _Manual of Library\r\nClassification and Shelf Arrangement_, 1898, which contained his\r\nAdjustable Classification, was a real event, because it was the first\r\ncomprehensive treatment of a till then little understood and much abused\r\nsubject; as was that of his greatest work, the _Manual of Library\r\nEconomy_, which first appeared in 1903, and has influenced all library\r\nmethodology.\r\n\r\nQuiet as he was in many ways, he was of a social disposition, a trait\r\nwhich found an outlet to some extent at the Library Association, of\r\nwhich he was a councillor from 1890 to 1911; but for closer purposes of\r\n_camaraderie_ he founded, with Mr Jast, the well-known Pseudonyms, a\r\ndining-club of librarians and their friends, which had its origin in the\r\n‘nineties, and flourished for many years. The meetings were held in\r\nvarious Bohemian restaurants in Soho, professional and literary topics\r\nwere debated, and Brown reported them in _The Library World_. The\r\nreports had little relation to the actual proceedings, and few people\r\nwere more entertained, and, incidentally, astonished at their own\r\nwittiness (as reported) than the Pseudonyms themselves. This is but one\r\ninstance of his humorous way of regarding all things. In conversation,\r\nand in writing of even the most dryasdust subjects, it seemed impossible\r\nfor him to talk or write without humour.\r\n\r\nBrown’s sixteen years at Clerkenwell made the library perhaps the most\r\nreputed in the country. Mr Jast may be quoted upon this: “Mr Brown’s\r\ninfluence and reputation extended far beyond his own country. Foreign\r\nlibrarians visiting London almost invariably made for two places; one\r\nwas the large and handsome room overlooking a stately west-end square,\r\nwhich Mr J. Y. W. MacAlister occupied for so many years; and the other\r\nwas a small room, high up in a rather dingy-looking triangular building,\r\noverlooking a dingier street in Clerkenwell, which was so hidden away\r\nthat one rather stumbled upon it than found it, where Mr J. D. Brown\r\nworked in his official capacity as Librarian, before he was called to a\r\nsphere more worthy of his labours, in Islington. How many librarians,\r\nhow many members of library committees, how many workers in the Library\r\nmovement have been charmed, interested, and instructed in these two\r\nrooms?” Not only was he required to give advice in his own country; at\r\ndifferent times he was called upon to lecture on “free public libraries”\r\nin the United States, in Holland and in Belgium. “A Bruxelles,” writes\r\nM. Paul Otlet, “il parla devant l’auditore du Musée du Livre et son\r\nsuccès fut très grand.” I cannot help thinking that his success depended\r\nmore upon his subject and his clear writing than upon his speaking; he\r\nwas on the whole an indifferent speaker, his nervousness was painful to\r\nhimself and others, and his ineradicable Glasgow accent was a real\r\nobstacle. He told my wife that the only place in which he enjoyed\r\nspeaking was the meetings of the Islington Staff Club; he confessed to a\r\nhorror and nervousness in public speech.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 he was appointed the first Borough Librarian of Islington. Here\r\nthe public libraries scheme had its very beginnings under his care, and\r\nhe was responsible for the interior design of the fine central library\r\nand the north and west branches; probably also for the south-east\r\nbranch, but of that I am not sure. These libraries, I dare affirm,\r\nrepresented the highest achievement in library-planning in this country,\r\nwith their handsome, adequate and practical rooms, economy in working,\r\nand general suitableness for their purpose. Here he brought into\r\npractice two of his principal innovations. The first was the Subject\r\nClassification, a huge, minute scheme, which we describe in more detail\r\nin the later pages of this book, which challenged comparison with the\r\ngreat and more popular American schemes in its completeness, logical\r\narrangement, and admirable notation. Its focus upon British requirements\r\nmade it specially attractive to British librarians, and although it may\r\nnever supersede the more universal Decimal System of Melvil Dewey, it is\r\nnevertheless a work of the greatest value to all librarians. The second\r\nand more revolutionary innovation was the exclusion of the newsroom as\r\nusually understood from the libraries. In his account of his visit to\r\nAmerica, he mentioned with something approaching disapproval the absence\r\nof this department from American libraries and the sense of desertion\r\nwhich resulted there; but at Islington he adopted the American plan. I\r\nam told that the Islington public did not approve the omission quite as\r\nmuch as did its author, but the arguments he used for it were\r\ncommon-sense ones, although he has had few, if any, British imitators.\r\n\r\nTo give in detail all his work for Islington would be to occupy a\r\ndisproportionate space in a memoir of this compass. Suffice it to say\r\nthat he provided this not entirely grateful Borough with a system which\r\nis the admiration of our profession. He gathered round him an\r\naccomplished staff, published a model select catalogue, encouraged the\r\nformation of an excellent staff guild for his assistants, and did many\r\nother invaluable things. He had long been a teacher of young librarians.\r\nWhen the Library Association courses were inaugurated at the London\r\nSchool of Economics he became the lecturer in library organization and\r\nroutine, and served in that capacity for many years. As one of his\r\nstudents, I can vouch for his conscientious, painstaking teaching, his\r\ncare in clearing up difficulties, the encouraging and friendly way in\r\nwhich he answered our questions, marked our exercises, and generally\r\nmade our work of interest and value. No librarian who turned to him for\r\nadvice ever went unhelped, whatever his age or school of thought. He\r\nwrote hundreds of letters to such purpose in his beautiful minute\r\nhandwriting, and a collection of these would form, I believe, an\r\nexcellent journal of contemporary librarianship. He seemed, in\r\nparticular, to have a minute knowledge of all librarians and library\r\nassistants, their capacities and work accomplished. His obvious sympathy\r\nwith young assistants first drew many of us to him. From the day I met\r\nhim in 1896 at Bournemouth to his death he showed me by constant signs\r\nhis regard for younger men and women who had a real interest in the work\r\nthat he himself loved. He treated us with equal consideration in his\r\ncorrespondence, and the youngest correspondent received the same\r\ncourtesy as his elders. He drafted the constitution of the Library\r\nAssistants’ Association, which with slight modifications has proved most\r\nwise and successful; and he frequently, especially in his last years,\r\nattended the meetings of this Association, taking part in the\r\ndiscussions when invited to do so, but seldom intruding his opinions\r\nunasked upon his young listeners, who, be it remarked, were always eager\r\nto hear him.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult task to sketch “the man in his habit as he lived,” but\r\na few words may be written. The portrait which forms our frontispiece\r\nis almost life-like, with its thoughtful, quiet, and, if one looks\r\ncarefully enough, intent and humorous face. In person he was small, but\r\nnot too obviously so; fragile-looking, but yet compact and vital in\r\nappearance and movement; he had brown hair and beard, delicate features,\r\ndeft and supple hands; he thought calmly, was a rapid, consistent, and\r\npersevering worker; what he began he finished. His writings have been\r\npronounced by Dr E. A. Baker to possess unmistakable quality, although\r\n“he scoffed at the word ‘style’ as denoting some futile kind of verbal\r\nlegerdemain” (I think he must have done so jokingly, as his own personal\r\nlibrary showed that he was by no means blind to the qualities of\r\nliterary expression). “Shrewd, practical common sense, rough on cranks\r\nand sentimentalists, unmerciful to muddlers, impervious to a good many\r\nideas, but a steady assertor of those he had tried and approved--this\r\nwas the stuff of Brown’s writing,” is Dr Baker’s estimate, and in the\r\nmain it coincides with my own. His personal tastes may be inferred from\r\nhis work. “He once told me,” writes Mr Aldred, “he knew three subjects\r\nonly, viz., library economy, music, and Scotland. I forget the order in\r\nwhich he placed them. Being a Scotsman, probably Scotland came first. In\r\nmany respects, however, J. D. B.’s knowledge was of the encyclopædic\r\norder--he appeared to know a little of any subject named.”\r\n\r\nIn early life he was pronounced to be consumptive, but he told me, “I\r\nhave lived to see the doctors who condemned me in their graves,” by\r\ncareful living, and probably by sheer will power. But in his later years\r\nhe had to meet many difficulties at Islington, where the libraries\r\nbecame the sport of a political party and he had a committee which was\r\nunable to assess his powers. It is useless to revive this now, but it\r\nprobably helped to bring about his early death. He first became\r\nseriously ill in 1911, and with a few intervals, when we believed him to\r\nbe practically himself again, he gradually weakened. In the last few\r\nmonths of his life a stay at Bournemouth was tried as a final resource,\r\nand here he read musical biography assiduously and maintained the\r\nkeenest outlook upon all things; but no improvement ensued in his\r\nhealth, and he returned to London a dying man. The end came at his\r\nhouse, 15, Canonbury Park South, Islington, on 26th February 1914; and\r\nhe was buried, amid every sign of regret and affection, at New\r\nSouthgate Cemetery. His only memorial to the present are his works; I\r\nbelieve they will be an enduring one.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: Brown entered upon his library career at a time when the\r\nlibrary movement received its greatest impetus, and brought the whole\r\nforce of a fertile and inventive mind and a ready pen into its service.\r\nHe wrote the first text-books actually intended for English public\r\nlibrarians, collected and systematized all available methodology, and,\r\nthoroughly believing in his mission, this man more than any other in his\r\ngeneration fashioned in this country a living, interesting profession\r\nout of the despised materials of the popular library. An impression\r\nwritten by Alderman H. Keatley Moore, B.A., B.Mus., J.P., a veteran\r\nworker for public libraries, who made his acquaintance early, may serve\r\nto conclude this necessarily brief account of our author:\r\n\r\n“What was it especially that made one feel so clearly that one was in\r\nthe presence of a true man, of an absolute master of his subject, of\r\none, in fact, whom it was an honour to know?\r\n\r\n“I think it was that curious quietness, the repose of a man who has\r\nthought out everything fully for himself, and is content to leave the\r\nfacts as he has arranged them to tell their own story. He was still,\r\nbecause he was so strong; he was undisturbed by clamour because he had\r\nbeen through it all, and now stood in the open with the conquered\r\nfortress behind him, its strength his strength made visible; one\r\ngradually grew rather timid of this shy talker because he always had the\r\nfacts on his side. . . . He was the most unaffected and modest man of real\r\nmark that I have ever met in my long public life. I shall always be glad\r\nto have known him. I shall always remember the great services he\r\nrendered to me, to my town, to our country. Across my sincere regret at\r\nhis loss flickers the whimsical thought of how he would wonder at the\r\nfuss we are making over him.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Brown’s separate publications.

METHODS OF THIS BOOK\r\n\r\nI. Library economy is a term covering every branch of work concerned\r\nwith libraries; and libraries may be defined in a phrase as institutions\r\ndevoted to the collecting, conserving and exploiting of literature.\r\nOriginally the prevalent character of libraries was that of conserving\r\nrather than exploiting institutions, and much of the technical equipment\r\nof the modern librarian has come into being as a result of their\r\nprogress from their original “museum” to their present “workshop”\r\ncharacter. Our subject, then, covers the founding, organizing,\r\nadministration and routine of libraries. It is one of much wider compass\r\nthan is commonly supposed. Whatever may have been the original\r\nintention, for example, of the pioneers of the municipal public library\r\nmovement, and there are still many who seem to regard that movement as a\r\ncounter-attraction to the seductions of the saloon bar and similar\r\nplaces of recreation, the present public library is a many-sided, active\r\ncivic institution, making its appeal to all classes of the community as\r\na centre of education, culture and recreation, with a trained service to\r\ndirect it. Nearly every other type of library also is most concerned\r\nwith the best means of attracting people to make use of literature, and\r\nis an active force in the community rather than a passive one.\r\n\r\nII. Libraries have been recognized as important in all ages, and a brief\r\nstudy of the early civilizations of the East and of the Mediterranean\r\ncountries, as well as all later periods, shows the existence of state,\r\npublic, ecclesiastical and monastic libraries for which there was some\r\nsort of librarianship, with even such seemingly modern appliances as\r\nclassification and cataloguing of a kind. But the library as we know it\r\nto-day, and librarianship in particular, may almost be said to be the\r\ncreation of the last half of the nineteenth century. Earlier town\r\nlibraries indeed existed, the first, it is believed, being that at\r\nNorwich, which was opened to the public in 1608; but although there were\r\nindividual instances, the municipal public library (commonly but\r\nerroneously called the “free library,” because no charge is made for its\r\nuse) was a result of the Libraries Act of 1850 promoted by William\r\nEwart, M.P., who had at his back the real pioneer of public libraries,\r\nEdward Edwards, whose _Memoir of Libraries_ is the most monumental of\r\ntreatises on library history and administration. The Act of 1850 had in\r\nview the needs of the poor, sanctioned the levying of a halfpenny rate,\r\nand, with curious want of vision, left the provision of books to the\r\ngenerosity of private donors. The debates upon the bill before it became\r\nlaw are curious and entertaining reading; and it appears that the\r\nspecial purpose of libraries was the prevention of crime! Progress was\r\nslow at first, but in 1853 it was stated that thirteen towns had adopted\r\nthe Act. In 1855 its provisions were extended to Ireland, and in this\r\namending bill the amount that might be levied for libraries throughout\r\nthe kingdom was increased to a limit of one penny in the pound.\r\n\r\nIII. We need not follow the history of the movement, as an excellent\r\nmonograph by J. J. Ogle, _The Free Library_, is available on the\r\nquestion; nor need we go into the parallel and in some respects more\r\nwonderful development of the movement in America. So far as this country\r\nis concerned libraries have grown up in every considerable town, with\r\nvery few exceptions; but the whole movement has been retarded, even\r\ncrippled, by the retention of the limit of one penny in the pound as the\r\namount a local authority may spend on library provision. The advance in\r\ngeneral education--it must be remembered that in 1850 not more than\r\none-seventeenth of the children of the people were receiving an\r\neducation which could be called satisfactory even when judged by the low\r\nstandards of that time--has created a new reading public more vast than\r\nwas contemplated by the promoters of the Act; but the only legal help\r\ntowards meeting its demands has come from the increased product of rate\r\nassessments; the limit remains sixty-five years after its imposition.\r\nBut the increase we have mentioned has not been negligible, even if it\r\nis entirely insufficient, and it has been assisted in a remarkable way\r\nby private generosity. Amongst many who have provided towns with public\r\nlibrary buildings, Passmore Edwards, Lord Brassey, Henry Tate, Colonel\r\nGamble and Professor Sandeman may be mentioned; but the greatest impetus\r\nto the movement was given by the systematic and almost universal\r\nmunificence of Andrew Carnegie, which began in 1886 and has been\r\ncontinued by him and by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which he has\r\nendowed, to the present. His system has been to provide a suitable\r\nbuilding on the condition that the authority accepting it adopted the\r\nLibraries Act and provided a site from other charges than the library\r\nrate. By this means scores of towns which were without or had only\r\ninferior library buildings now possess one in some way worthy of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIV. The expansion of libraries gave rise to the modern profession of\r\nlibrarianship. The older libraries were usually in the charge of\r\nscholars, whose main work was that of “keeper” of the books, a title\r\nwhich the librarian in charge of the British Museum still bears,\r\nalthough it does not now comprehend his work. The municipal library\r\nrequired a man who was not primarily a scholar, although scholarship was\r\nan invaluable basis for his work; he was rather required to be an\r\nadministrator, a purveyor of books, and, because of the very limited\r\nmoneys at his disposal, something of a business man. For some years,\r\nhowever, there was no definite science or art of librarianship in this\r\nsense. Edward Edwards, in the second volume of his _Memoirs of\r\nLibraries_, laid firmly the foundations of present library economy in a\r\nrésumé and exposition of the multifarious methods of cataloguing,\r\nclassification, library planning and administration used in the various\r\nlibraries of the world. Little followed in England until the growing\r\nneeds of the work caused a few far-seeing librarians to find some means\r\nof bringing librarians together. This they succeeded in doing in the\r\nsuccessive conferences of librarians, British and international, the\r\nfirst of which was held in London in 1877. Out of these sprang the\r\nLibrary Association in 1878, with Mr Henry R. Tedder and the late E. B.\r\nNicholson as its first honorary secretaries, and the late Robert\r\nHarrison as honorary treasurer. In the first year the late E. C. Thomas\r\nsucceeded Nicholson, and somewhat later he was associated in his office\r\nwith Mr (now Sir) J. Y. W. MacAlister, one of the most significant and\r\ncreative personalities in our work; while Mr Tedder assumed the office\r\nof treasurer, which he holds to this day, an office in which his wisdom\r\nand counsel as well as his unsparing industry have done much to create\r\nthe present stability of the Association. By means of frequent\r\ngatherings, especially by its annual meetings, the Library Association\r\ngradually brought together the whole body of librarians in this country,\r\nwho read and discussed professional papers, published proceedings,\r\ninitiated scheme after scheme for the promotion and improvement of\r\nlibraries, and generally became the controlling factor in library\r\npolity. It was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1898. For many years it\r\nwas recognized that training in technical methods was necessary for\r\nlibrarians, and the Association has devoted much attention to this work.\r\nAt first it held summer schools and, from 1898, other brief courses for\r\nlibrary students, and examined the students upon them. Later it\r\nestablished, in connexion with the Governors of the London School of\r\nEconomics, regular courses of lectures at that institution. A\r\ncarefully-designed and remarkably helpful syllabus of instruction was\r\ndrawn up, and on this examinations were held and certificates leading up\r\nto a diploma in librarianship were issued. The latest phase of the\r\neducational work of the Association has been the securing of a grant\r\nfrom the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust for the establishment of a School\r\nof Librarianship at University College, London, which it is expected\r\nwill commence on 1st October 1919. This will primarily be a day school\r\nwith courses of study founded on the syllabus of the Association, which\r\nhas been carefully revised and extended to meet the new circumstances.\r\nIt is ridiculous to prophesy, but if this School is a success it is\r\nprobable that it will revolutionize the whole character of library\r\nservice in this country.\r\n\r\nV. There have been various definitions of the purpose of libraries and\r\nlibrarians, few of them entirely adequate. We shall not attempt another\r\ndogmatically, but we may suggest that that purpose is to provide a\r\nrepresentative and systematically arranged collection of literature from\r\nthe daily newspaper to the elaborate treatise and encyclopædic work of\r\nreference. The methods of doing this, and of exploiting in the public\r\ninterest the collection when made, are the subject-matter of this\r\nmanual. Until this primary purpose of a library is fulfilled any\r\nattempts at those added activities which are advocated by some\r\nlibrarians to-day are likely to be mistaken, or at least ill-advised.\r\nThe Library Association has not issued a comprehensive manifesto\r\ncovering this matter, and might very well do so, if care were taken, as\r\nno doubt it would be, to give considerable elasticity to the\r\ndefinitions. At the Annual Meeting in 1917, however, it did adopt a\r\nseries of resolutions of great importance, which, as the almost\r\nunanimous pronouncement of the profession, must find a place here. In\r\nthe light of the rough definition given, their inadequacy as a\r\ncomprehensive statement of library work is obvious enough, but they have\r\ngreat value as showing the trend of that work in the effort to meet the\r\nremarkable intellectual, industrial and other conditions created by the\r\nEuropean War; and this seems to us a justification for treating each of\r\nthe resolutions at greater length in the following pages:\r\n\r\n1. “That the aim of the library as an educational institution is best\r\nexpressed in the formula ‘Self-development in an atmosphere of freedom,’\r\nas contrasted with the aim of the school, which is ‘Training in an\r\natmosphere of restraint or discipline’; in the school the teacher is\r\ndominant, because it is possible to pass on a form, to teach an art; but\r\nin the library the pupil strikes out his own line, and becomes his own\r\nteacher; the library supplies the material upon which the powers\r\nawakened and trained in the school can be exercised; the library and the\r\nschool depend upon different ideas, deal with different material in\r\ndifferent ways, and there is no administrative relation between the two;\r\nfurthermore, the contacts of the library with organized education\r\nnecessarily cease at the point where the educational machinery itself\r\nterminates, but the library continues as an educational force of\r\nnational importance in its contacts with the whole social, political and\r\nintellectual life of the community; that the recognition of the true\r\nplace of the library in education must carry with it the provision of\r\nadequate financial resources, which is impossible under the present\r\nlimitation on the library rate; such limitation therefore should be\r\nremoved at the earliest possible moment.”\r\n\r\n2. “That the creation in the child of intellectual interests, which is\r\nfurthered by a love of books, is an urgent national need; that while it\r\nis the business of the school to foster the desire to know, it is the\r\nbusiness of the library to give adequate opportunity for the\r\nsatisfaction of this desire; that library work with children ought to be\r\nthe basis of all other library work; that reading-rooms should be\r\nprovided in all public libraries, where children may read books in\r\nattractive surroundings, under the sympathetic and tactful guidance of\r\ntrained children’s librarians; but that such provision will be largely\r\nfutile except under the conditions which experience, especially in\r\nAmerica where the importance of this work has long been recognized and\r\nwhere it is highly developed, has shown to be essential to success.”\r\n\r\n3. “That in view of meeting trade conditions after the war, commercial\r\nlibraries should be established in all the great trade centres of the\r\nkingdom, as a part of the municipal library system, where business men\r\nmay obtain reliable commercial information, by means of the collection\r\nand arrangement for rapid consultation of all Government and other\r\npublications relating to commerce; that such libraries should act as\r\noutliers or branches of the Commercial Intelligence Department of the\r\nBoard of Trade; and that such Department should further the work of\r\nthese libraries in every possible way; that in the smaller towns\r\ncommercial collections should be formed.”\r\n\r\n4. “That technical libraries are as essential, both to technical\r\neducation and to manufacture, as the laboratory or the workshop; that\r\ndiscovery and invention are stimulated by books; that the technical\r\nlibrary, therefore, should be established as a special department of the\r\npublic library in all important manufacturing towns, with a special\r\norganization, including a librarian trained not only in library method\r\nand in the bibliography of technology, but possessing also a sufficient\r\ntechnical knowledge to enable him to act as a source of information to\r\ninquirers.”\r\n\r\n5. “That collections of books and other printed and manuscript matter\r\nbearing upon questions of local government should be established in\r\nconnexion with municipalities; that such collections to be effective\r\nmust be in charge of a trained librarian; that the management of such\r\ncollections should be placed under the library committee; that the cost\r\nof such libraries will be small in proportion to the valuable part they\r\nwill play in serving the needs, not only of officials entrusted with the\r\ncarrying out of public work, but also of members of the municipality\r\nresponsible for local government finance and policy.”\r\n\r\nVI. Since the succeeding chapters of this manual were revised the\r\nMinistry of Reconstruction has issued a report on libraries and museums\r\nwhich has been made by its Adult Education Committee. This traverses in\r\na general way the ground covered by the Library Association resolutions\r\nand makes recommendations of much moment and gravity. The aim of the\r\nreport is to explain the extent of libraries and to secure their\r\nco-ordination. It criticizes Resolution 1 on the ground that it\r\nrepresents the aims of education inadequately, and it deduces from\r\nseveral very cogent arguments the policy of placing libraries under the\r\nlocal education committees in order that they may be merged into and\r\nworked as an extension of the national education system. For London this\r\nwould mean taking libraries from the boroughs and placing them in the\r\ncare of the county. The matter is too unsettled to admit of argument\r\nhere, but such a policy, if carried out, might alter radically the whole\r\ncharacter of library provision and administration. The linking up of\r\nlibraries is recommended by means of a central lending library in\r\nLondon, the municipal libraries, special libraries, and rural libraries;\r\nthe central lending library would supply the more expensive, little-used\r\nbooks to students direct or through the municipal or rural libraries,\r\nand special libraries should be drawn upon in their specialities for\r\nbooks to be used throughout the country. To the end that the service\r\nshould be developed to the greatest extent, the present income of\r\nlibraries should be increased, either by an increase in the separate\r\nlibrary rate or by abolishing that rate altogether and allowing the\r\nestimates of the library to be included in general education estimates.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite probable that the near future will see a removal of the\r\nmain financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nVII. This manual is based upon the syllabus of the Library Association,\r\nbut excludes sections 1 and, in part, 2 (Literary History and\r\nBibliography), and includes the subject-matter of the resolutions of\r\n1917. Primarily it is a manual of municipal library practice, but is by\r\nno means exclusively so. Special libraries have their individual\r\nmethods, and a general conspectus of librarianship cannot include them;\r\nand state, university, institutional, club and private libraries are\r\nequally matters for specific treatment such as would be impossible here.\r\nBut all libraries are faced with very similar problems of selection,\r\naccession, classification, cataloguing, etc., or at any rate they differ\r\nin these matters in degree rather than in kind; and it is hoped that for\r\nthem much that follows will be at least interesting and suggestive. To\r\nthis end the method aimed at is expository rather than argumentative;\r\nand when two or more methods are in vogue they have been placed side by\r\nside in order that the student may review them and form his own judgment\r\nof their relative merits. Where we are dogmatic we are so unconsciously,\r\nand we hope that aberrations of this kind will be passed over with\r\nforbearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION II\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION, COMMITTEES AND FINANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Municipal Libraries: Acts of Parliament.=--The principal Acts of\r\nParliament under which British public municipal libraries are now\r\nconstituted consist of the following:--\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND\r\n\r\n  1855. “18 & 19 Vict., c. 40. An Act for further promoting the\r\n  establishment of Free Public Libraries and Museums in Ireland.” (The\r\n  principal Act.)\r\n\r\n  1877. “40 & 41 Vict., c. 15. An Act to amend the Public Libraries Act\r\n  (Ireland), 1855.”\r\n\r\n  1894. “57 & 58 Vict., c. 38. An Act to amend the Public Libraries\r\n  (Ireland) Acts.”\r\n\r\n  1902. “The Public Libraries (Ireland) Amendment Act.” Gives power to\r\n  District Councils to adopt the Acts, and empowers County Councils to\r\n  make grants in aid of libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOTLAND\r\n\r\n  1887. “50 & 51 Vict., c. 42. An Act to amend and consolidate the\r\n  Public Libraries (Scotland) Acts.” (The principal Act.)\r\n\r\n  1894. “57 & 58 Vict., c. 20. An Act to amend the Public Libraries\r\n  Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1887.”\r\n\r\n  1899. “62 & 63 Vict., c. 5. An Act to amend the Public Libraries\r\n  (Scotland) Acts.”\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND AND WALES\r\n\r\n  1892. “55 & 66 Vict., c. 53. An Act to consolidate and amend the law\r\n  relating to Public Libraries.” (The principal Act.)\r\n\r\n  1893. “56 Vict., c. 11. An Act to amend the Public Libraries Act,\r\n  1892.”\r\n\r\n  1898. “61 & 62 Vict., c. 53. An Act to provide for the Punishment of\r\n  Offences in Libraries.”\r\n\r\n  1901. “1 Edw. 7. An Act to amend the Acts relating to Public\r\n  Libraries, Museums and Gymnasiums, and to regulate the liability of\r\n  managers of libraries to proceedings for libel.”\r\n\r\n  [NOTE.--This Act does _not_ deal with actions for libel. It was\r\n  originally intended to do so, but the clauses were struck out of the\r\n  bill, and the title escaped emendation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=2.= The whole of these are in force, and they repeal all the former\r\nActs dating from 1850, while incorporating some of their provisions. In\r\naddition to these general Acts, a considerable number of local Acts have\r\nbeen passed on behalf of various towns, which include provisions for the\r\nmodification of the general Acts, chiefly in regard to removing the\r\nlimitation of the rate, and for other purposes. Such powers are usually\r\ncontained in improvement or tramway Acts, and the principal towns which\r\nhave obtained them include Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh,\r\nHalifax, Darwen, Sheffield, Cardiff, etc. Several towns, like Brighton,\r\nHuddersfield, Kingston-on-Thames, have also special Acts which confer\r\nthe power of establishing libraries, independently of the general Acts,\r\nso that the public libraries of Britain are not constituted under one\r\ngeneral law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3.= The Public Library Law is further modified or extended by various\r\nother statutes which were passed for different purposes, and the\r\nprincipal Acts of this kind are as follows:\r\n\r\n  “24 & 25 Vict., c. 97. An Act to consolidate and amend the Statute Law\r\n  of England and Ireland relating to malicious injuries to property,”\r\n  1861.\r\n\r\n  This gives power to prosecute for misdemeanour any person who\r\n  unlawfully and maliciously destroys or damages any book, manuscript,\r\n  etc., in any public museum, gallery, cabinet or library.\r\n\r\n  “56 & 57 Vict., c. 73. An Act to make further provision for local\r\n  government in England and Wales,” 1894.\r\n\r\n  Enables rural parishes to adopt the Public Libraries Act, 1892, by\r\n  means of a parish meeting or poll of the voters in the parish.\r\n\r\n  “62 & 63 Vict., c. 14. An Act to make better provision for local\r\n  government in London,” 1899.\r\n\r\n  Confers the power of adopting the Public Libraries Act, 1892, on the\r\n  Metropolitan Borough Councils, by extending to them the provisions of\r\n  the Public Libraries Act, 1893.\r\n\r\nThe remaining statutes which in any way deal with public or private\r\nlibraries will be noticed in connexion with the departments of library\r\nadministration, to which they specially refer, such as loans, rating,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe only other Acts of Parliament which may in the future influence\r\npublic libraries are the Education Acts passed since 1902. Under these\r\nActs local Education Boards are empowered to “promote the general\r\nco-ordination of all forms of education,” and in many districts the\r\neducation and library authorities are amalgamated for common purposes.\r\nIt remains to be seen what further extensions will take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Main Provisions of the Municipal Libraries Acts.=--A brief summary\r\nof the leading practical points of the various Acts will serve to give\r\nan idea of the powers which are conferred upon municipal authorities in\r\nregard to libraries:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) ADOPTION OF ACTS IN TOWNS.--The Acts may be adopted in any city,\r\n  county borough, burgh or urban district by a resolution passed by the\r\n  council, at a special meeting of which a month’s notice shall have\r\n  been given, and the resolution must be advertised publicly in the\r\n  usual way, and a copy sent to the Local Government Board, if the\r\n  adoption is in England or Ireland; while a notice of the fact of\r\n  adoption must also be sent.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) ADOPTION OF ACTS IN PARISHES.--In parishes in England and\r\n  Scotland the Acts can only be adopted by a majority vote of the\r\n  householders or voters.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) LIBRARY RATE.--A rate of one penny in the £ on the rateable\r\n  value of an administrative area is the limit fixed by the Act, but\r\n  power is given parishes to fix a smaller sum by a popular vote, and\r\n  urban districts of all kinds to remove or fix any rate within the\r\n  limit of one penny by resolution of the council.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) POWERS.--The Library Authority may provide public libraries,\r\n  museums, schools for science, art galleries and schools for art, and\r\n  for that purpose may purchase and hire land, and erect, take down,\r\n  rebuild, alter, repair and extend buildings, and fit up, furnish and\r\n  supply the same with all requisite furniture, fittings and\r\n  conveniences. The Library Authority shall exercise the general\r\n  management, regulation and control of every department established\r\n  under the provisions of the Acts, and may provide books, newspapers,\r\n  maps and specimens of art and science, and cause the same to be bound\r\n  and repaired when necessary. Also appoint salaried officers and\r\n  servants, and dismiss them, and make regulations for the safety and\r\n  use of every library, museum, gallery and school under its control,\r\n  and for admission of the public thereto. Power is also given to make\r\n  agreements with other library authorities for the joint use of library\r\n  or other buildings; and to borrow money, with the sanction of the\r\n  central authorities, for the purpose of buying sites, erecting\r\n  buildings and furnishing them. The Irish Act of 1877 also gives power\r\n  to establish schools of music as part of a library scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Non-Municipal Libraries: Acts of Parliament.=--The legislation\r\naffecting the large number of British libraries which are not supported\r\nout of the rates is neither extensive nor satisfactory. The chief\r\nfeature of most of the Acts of Parliament which have been passed seems\r\nto be the benevolent one of granting certain facilities to various kinds\r\nof landowners to divest themselves of their property in order to provide\r\nsites for literary and scientific institutions. There are similar\r\nclauses in the Public Libraries Acts, and, of course, most of the Acts\r\nnamed apply to municipal libraries; but in reality this kind of\r\nlegislation is not particularly valuable. To make the transfer of land\r\nfor public purposes more easy is quite laudable, but it has not yet had\r\nthe effect of inducing landowners to part with free plots of land as\r\nbuilding sites, either to public library authorities or literary\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=6.= The principal Act bearing on literary and scientific institutions\r\nis entitled “An Act to afford greater facilities for the establishment\r\nof Institutions for the promotion of Literature and Science and the Fine\r\nArts, and to provide for their better regulation,” 17 & 18 Vict., c.\r\n112, 1854. This is nearly all taken up with provisions for transfers of\r\nlands and other property, and with a few regulations concerning members,\r\nrules, altering, extending or dissolving the institution, etc. This Act\r\nwas afterwards to some extent modified by “An Act to facilitate the\r\ntransfer of Schools for Science and Art to Local Authorities,” 54 & 55\r\nVict., c. 61, 1891. These, and the other Acts referred to, which deal\r\nwith transfers of property, have had very little to do with the\r\ndevelopment of voluntary literary and scientific institutions or\r\nlibraries; the principal statute under which most of them are now\r\ngoverned being an Act passed primarily for quite a different purpose.\r\nThis is the “Act to amend the ‘Companies Act, 1862,’” 30 & 31 Vict., c.\r\n131, 1867, under Section 23 of which power is given the Board of Trade\r\nto grant licences to literary and similar associations, providing for\r\nregistration with limited liability, and conferring all the privileges\r\nattaching to limited companies. In connexion with this Act, and those of\r\n1862 and 1877, the Board of Trade have issued a series of circulars and\r\nforms, which include draft rules, articles of association, etc. Under\r\nthese licences a considerable number of British literary institutions\r\nhave been established and organized.\r\n\r\n\r\n=7. British Colonial Library Legislation= has proceeded very much on the\r\nlines adopted in the mother country, and in every case the permissive\r\ncharacter of the Acts has been preserved, and, in most cases, the rate\r\nlimitation. On the other hand, some effort has been made to keep in\r\ntouch with schools and universities.\r\n\r\nIn =South Africa= a Government proclamation established the South\r\nAfrican Public Library at Cape Town in 1818. This was further regulated\r\nby an ordinance passed in 1836, which gave the library the right to\r\nreceive a free copy of every publication issued in CAPE COLONY. Other\r\nlibraries in the large towns now receive grants from the Government, and\r\na large number of smaller libraries also receive grants equal to the\r\nannual average amount raised by subscriptions and donations during the\r\nthree preceding years; but in no case shall the amount of the\r\nParliamentary grant exceed £150 for any one library in one year. No\r\ngrants are made if less than £25 is raised by subscription. In return\r\nfor the grant, reading-rooms and reference libraries are to be open free\r\nto the public, and an annual report has to be presented to the\r\nGovernment. In NATAL the same arrangement is made, though on a much\r\nsmaller scale. In both colonies books are only lent for home reading to\r\nsubscribers. In 1874 an Act was passed by the Legislature of Natal for\r\nregulating literary and other societies not legally incorporated.\r\n\r\nIn =Canada=, under a General Libraries Act of 1854, County Councils were\r\nauthorized to establish four classes of libraries: (1) Ordinary common\r\nschool libraries in each school-house for the use of children and\r\nratepayers; (2) a general public library available to all ratepayers in\r\nthe municipality; (3) professional libraries of books on teaching, etc.,\r\nfor teachers only; and (4) a library in any public institution under the\r\ncontrol of a municipality. Arrangements were made whereby the Education\r\nOffice sold books at low rates to the school libraries; and afterwards\r\nthe Education Department of the Legislature gave annual grants, equal to\r\nthe amounts contributed by members for book purchase, to mechanics’\r\ninstitutes, etc., and subsequently increased such grants for books to\r\n$400 (£80) annually. The province of Ontario, in 1882, passed “An Act to\r\nprovide for the Establishment of Free Libraries,” on lines very similar\r\nto the English Acts. Power is given any city, town or incorporated\r\nvillage to provide libraries, newsrooms, museums and branches, on the\r\npetition and with the consent of the qualified electors. The management\r\nis vested in a board chosen from the Town Council, citizens other than\r\ncouncillors, and the Public School Boards. The library rate is limited\r\nto an “annual rate not exceeding one half of a mill in the dollar upon\r\nthe assessed value of all rateable, real and personal property.” This\r\nform of limitation is borrowed from the practice of the United States.\r\nAbout ninety places have adopted this Free Libraries Act in Ontario. In\r\n1895 an Act was passed in Ontario to enable mechanics’ institutes to\r\nchange their names and transfer their property to municipalities on\r\ncondition that the libraries were made free to the public.\r\n\r\nThe =Australian= colonies have all passed separate laws, somewhat\r\nsimilar to those in force in other parts of the Empire, in regard to\r\ntheir adoption being left to local option, and rates being more or less\r\nlimited. In 1870 VICTORIA passed an Act establishing the Library, Museum\r\nand National Art Gallery at Melbourne, and in 1885 “The Free Libraries\r\nAct” was passed. But, in 1890, these Acts were repealed by “An Act to\r\nconsolidate the Laws relating to Libraries.” The Melbourne Public\r\nLibrary, which was established in 1853, is now wholly supported by\r\nGovernment, and it lends books to any municipality in the colony. In\r\naddition, the Government make grants from public funds to most of the\r\nmechanics’ institutions, athenæums and other literary societies in\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA has quite a body of library laws, dating from 1863, when\r\nthe South Australian Institution was incorporated, but most of them have\r\nbeen repealed or incorporated in the two principal Acts regulating\r\ninstitutes and free libraries. By the various Acts passed in connexion\r\nwith institutes or literary societies, grants in aid are made by\r\nParliament on lines similar to those in force in the other colonies,\r\nwhile rules and regulations are made and power given to transfer such\r\ninstitutes to the municipalities. Public libraries are regulated by “An\r\nAct to establish Free Libraries in Corporate Towns and District\r\nCouncils,” 1898, subsequently amended by an Act of 1902. This Act gives\r\nlocal authorities power, on the request and with the consent of the\r\nratepayers, to adopt the Act, subject to the rate not exceeding 3d. in\r\nthe £. Municipal libraries are also entitled to receive the same grants\r\nas are made to institutes.\r\n\r\nIn NEW SOUTH WALES public libraries may be established under the\r\n“Municipalities Act,” 1867. The Government makes grants for the purchase\r\nof books on a scale according to population, and other funds must be\r\nprovided by the subscriptions of members. Schools of art are entitled to\r\nreceive a Government grant in proportion to the amount of monetary\r\nsupport accorded by the public. In addition, the Sydney Public Library\r\n(established in 1869) is entirely supported by the Government, and it\r\nsends out carefully selected boxes of books to 128 institutes throughout\r\nNew South Wales, the entire cost being defrayed by Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn WESTERN AUSTRALIA grants are made to institutes as in the other\r\ncolonies, but there is no general Library Act in existence yet. In 1887\r\nthe Government established a Public Library at Perth, and contributes\r\n£3000 per annum for its maintenance. The only legislative enactment\r\nconcerning libraries in Western Australia is an Act for establishing a\r\nLaw and Parliamentary Library for the Legislature, which was passed in\r\n1873 and amended in 1889.\r\n\r\nQUEENSLAND passed an “Act to consolidate and amend the Laws relating to\r\nMunicipal Institutions, and to provide more effectually for local\r\ngovernment,” 1878. This was extended by the “Divisional Boards Act” of\r\n1887, and now Municipal Councils or Divisional Boards may make bye-laws\r\nfor the establishment, maintenance and management of public libraries.\r\nBrisbane Free Public Library, the only library of importance opened\r\nunder this Act, has an annual grant from the municipal funds varying\r\nfrom £800 to £1000. One hundred and forty schools of art throughout the\r\ncolony also receive Government grants for library and other purposes to\r\nthe extent of about 8s. 2d. for every pound subscribed by members.\r\n\r\nTASMANIA has a model library law, which is worthy of adoption in every\r\ncivilized country. It is contained in “An Act to amend the Law relating\r\nto Public Libraries,” passed in 1867. It is so short, and so much to the\r\npoint, that the whole of it may be quoted. After a two-line preamble it\r\ndeclares that: “The Municipal Council of every municipality may, from\r\ntime to time, apply such sum as it sees fit, out of the rates of such\r\nmunicipality, in and towards the formation and maintenance of Public\r\nLibraries within such municipality.” That is the whole Act, and it gives\r\nno indication of the grudging limitations which other countries inflict.\r\nThe only blemish on this admirable statute is the fact that it is not\r\ncompulsory. Most of the Tasmanian towns being small, only Hobart has put\r\nthe library law into force, by appropriating a penny rate to the support\r\nof the Tasmanian Public Library (1849), which is also maintained by\r\nGovernment grants. The small libraries throughout Tasmania receive\r\ngrants, on the usual conditions, from the Government.\r\n\r\nThe library law of NEW ZEALAND is based on a series of Acts, similar to\r\nthose passed in this country for the regulation of municipal libraries\r\nand literary institutions. The principal Acts are: (1) “An Act to\r\npromote the establishment of Public Libraries,” 1869, giving power for\r\nthe governing body of a city, village or district to adopt the Act with\r\nthe consent of the ratepayers, and to levy a rate not exceeding 1d. in\r\nthe £; (2) “An Act to confer powers on Public Libraries and Mechanics’\r\nInstitutes,” 1875--a series of rules for incorporation and management;\r\n(3) “An Act to promote the establishment and support of Public\r\nLibraries,” 1877. In this Act it is laid down that the grant for public\r\nlibraries is to be apportioned among provincial districts, in proportion\r\nto the population of such districts, and that a subsidy equal to the\r\namount of the library rate is to be paid to municipal libraries\r\nestablished under the Act of 1869. Free admission to reading-rooms is\r\npermitted, but no person to be allowed to borrow unless he contributes\r\nnot less than 5s. per annum.\r\n\r\nNone of the =West Indian= dependencies have legislation relating to\r\nlibraries, although grants are paid from Government funds towards the\r\nmaintenance of libraries in different British possessions.\r\n\r\nIn =India= the Government subsidizes only libraries connected with the\r\nleading departments of State, such as law and parliamentary libraries\r\nfor the use of legislators and the Councils forming the Indian\r\nGovernment. It cannot be said to redound to the credit of the Government\r\nthat the only public library systems in India have been established in\r\nnative States. The Gaekwar of Baroda has instituted such a system, which\r\nextends from the capital city to the smallest village, and his example\r\nhas been followed by the native State of Indore.\r\n\r\nThe British colonial libraries are thus established and regulated on\r\nlines very similar to the municipal libraries of this country, and\r\nliterary institutions of all kinds are incorporated and recognized in\r\nthe same way as in the United Kingdom. There are numerous differences,\r\nhowever, in points of detail, because, although the permissive clauses\r\nare retained for municipal libraries in every case, in some cases, such\r\nas Tasmania and South Australia, the rate limit is either non-existent\r\nor greatly increased. Again, it is a universal provision in colonial\r\nadministration for the Governments to assist all kinds of libraries, to\r\nthe extent of contributing, within limits, as much money as is raised by\r\nthe subscriptions of members or produced by a municipal library rate.\r\nAlso, more attempt is made, especially in Canada, to embody the\r\nlibraries as part of the national system of education, and in this\r\nrespect our colonies are ahead of the mother country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=8.= The Library Legislation of the =United States= is of very great\r\nimportance, because of its variety, liberality and consistent aim to\r\nmake libraries an essential part of the system of national education.\r\n\r\nAs Dr Thomas Bray was the first to procure library legislation in\r\nEngland, so was he the first to obtain a law of this kind in North\r\nAmerica. He founded a library in South Carolina, which in 1700 formed\r\nthe subject of an Act passed by the Legislative Assembly of South\r\nCarolina for its regulation and protection. In 1715 a similar law for\r\nthe same purpose was passed by the Legislative Assembly of North\r\nCarolina. In subsequent years many laws were passed by different States\r\nfor the incorporation and regulation of all kinds of social,\r\nsubscription, mercantile and other libraries, much on the same lines as\r\nwere found necessary in other countries, in order to give such\r\nassociations legal standing and recognition. In some of the States laws\r\nhave been enacted providing for the payment of an annual grant to\r\nproprietary libraries, on condition that they are made free to the\r\ngeneral public for reference purposes. This plan of utilizing existing\r\nlibrary facilities for the public benefit is common to both the United\r\nStates and our own colonies, and there are many less effective ways of\r\nsecuring reading privileges at a comparatively cheap rate. It would add\r\nenormously to the educational resources of London, for example, if, in\r\nreturn for an annual Government grant, the general public could have\r\naccess to the reading-rooms of some of the more important literary,\r\nscientific and artistic libraries, especially those which are rich in\r\nthe current periodical literature of other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the “Report of the Commissioner of Education” for the United States,\r\n1895-96, vol. i., there is a very elaborate account of the “Library\r\nLegislation in the United States,” to which reference must be made by\r\nthose who want minute details of the laws of the different States of the\r\nUnion. Here it is only possible to deal with the laws affecting school\r\nand municipal libraries, and to give typical examples of the legislation\r\nin each class.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 the New York State Legislature passed a law establishing\r\nlibraries for the school districts of the State. These libraries were\r\nmuch extended and improved by later laws, and till 1853 they practically\r\nsupplied the place of the public libraries. Other States established\r\nthese school district libraries, open to scholars and all citizens,\r\nMassachusetts and Michigan following in 1837, Connecticut in 1839, Iowa\r\nand Rhode Island in 1840, and others at various dates down to 1876, when\r\nColorado passed a similar law. The failure of this system in many places\r\nled to the first Town Library Law being passed by the Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts in 1848, under which the City of Boston was authorized to\r\nestablish a free public library and levy a tax of $5000, or £1000, for\r\nits support. This was the first State law passed in America, and in 1849\r\nNew Hampshire passed a general law for the whole State. Massachusetts\r\nnext extended its library law from the City of Boston to the whole State\r\nin 1851, and Maine followed in 1854. The other northern States followed\r\nslowly, till now nearly all the States, save a few in the South and\r\nWest, have laws enabling municipal libraries to be established. Previous\r\nto this, most of the States, as they became incorporated in the Union,\r\nestablished libraries for the use of the legislative councils in the\r\ncapital towns of each State, and these State Libraries, as they are\r\ncalled, constitute a very important class of public library in the\r\nUnited States. The first actual municipal library opened in the United\r\nStates was that of the town of Peterboro’, in New Hampshire, which in\r\n1833 established and supported out of the local taxes a public library,\r\nwhich still exists. From this it appears that there was nothing either\r\nin the Federal or State law of the United States to prevent any town\r\nfrom supporting a library at the public expense if it saw fit. The\r\nprinciple of interference in local affairs by central authorities is,\r\nhowever, a thoroughly Anglo-Saxon convention or principle, and though\r\nthe Federal Legislature in America does not impose local laws on the\r\nState authorities, these State legislatures impose the same restrictions\r\nupon local municipal authorities which are common throughout the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe main provisions of the State Library Laws of America are:\r\n\r\n  (1) The adoption of the library laws of the State by any city or\r\n  municipal council, with or without the petition or consent of the\r\n  ratepayers. The practice differs in the various States, but it is\r\n  permissive and not compulsory in every State.\r\n\r\n  (2) Power to levy a rate for the establishment and support of\r\n  municipal libraries, varying from the fraction of a mill per dollar on\r\n  the taxable value of the town to any sum the council may see fit to\r\n  levy.\r\n\r\n  (3) Power to appoint trustees and do everything necessary for the\r\n  equipment and efficient administration of the libraries.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that in the United States the basis of taxation\r\nis entirely different from what it is in this country. Here rental,\r\nminus a certain deduction, is adopted as the unit from which to make up\r\nthe rateable value of a town. In the United States the value of all\r\nproperty is taken, instead of mere rental, as the unit from which the\r\nrateable value is built up. If a house in England is worth £420, and\r\nrents at £36, it would be assessed at about £30, and the library rate\r\nwould be levied upon the £30, producing 2s. 6d. In the United States the\r\nsame house, plus contents, would pay rates on the £420, being the value\r\nof the property, but on a smaller poundage. One mill on the dollar is\r\nthe thousandth part of 4s. 2d., or about one-twentieth of 1d. If,\r\ntherefore, the library rate in an American town is 1 mill, or the\r\ntwentieth of 1d., on the dollar, property valued at £420, or $2100,\r\nwould pay a total library rate of about 8s. 6d. Other classes of\r\nproperty, such as live stock, crops, etc., are also taxed, so that in\r\nAmerica the produce of even a comparatively small library rate is much\r\ngreater than in a town the same size in England, and this fact should\r\nalways be kept in mind when comparisons are being made between the\r\nlibrary systems of the two countries.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which should be mentioned as illustrative of\r\nthe difference of the methods of the United Kingdom and the United\r\nStates in regard to the adoption of the library laws by municipalities.\r\nIn those States of America where a poll of the citizens is required\r\nbefore the libraries can be established, no special vote is taken, but\r\ninstead, at the annual election of councillors, the voting papers bear\r\nthe question: Are you in favour of a library being established at a tax\r\nof ---- mills on the dollar? Thus at one election the municipal council\r\nis returned to office, and their library policy dictated to them by the\r\nratepayers. The liberal library laws of the United States have produced\r\na great number of very large and magnificently equipped public\r\nlibraries, which are administered by well-educated officers, who are\r\npaid adequate salaries for the work they accomplish. No other country in\r\nthe world can show such a scheme of libraries closely in touch with all\r\nthe other educational bodies and recognized by the State as part of the\r\nnational system of education.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the library authorities in the United States have shown\r\nmore wisdom than those of other countries, by establishing Boards of\r\nLibrary Commissioners charged with the responsibility of supervising the\r\nlibrary work of the whole of a State. These Library Commissions are\r\nestablished in some of the States, but not in all, and are generally\r\ncomposed of five or six educational experts. They have power to advise\r\nin the establishment of local libraries in every respect as regards\r\nselection of books, cataloguing, etc., and may expend public money in\r\nthe purchase of books for libraries in towns which do not possess\r\nmunicipal libraries. They are also authorized to pay for all clerical\r\nwork required in connexion with the Board, to issue reports and collect\r\nstatistics, and in some cases to organize travelling libraries. All\r\nthese State Library Commissions issue handbooks, and those of New Jersey\r\nand Wisconsin will give some idea of the important work in co-ordinating\r\nthe library forces of America now being accomplished by these\r\nCommissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=9.= No country in =Europe= has a library law like that in force in\r\nBritain and the United States, but a certain amount of recognition is\r\naccorded to public libraries by the State in most countries. Municipal\r\nlibraries exist in France under State direction, but very few towns in\r\nother countries have done much to foster public libraries in their\r\nmidst; but in recent years movements for the establishment of municipal\r\nlibraries on British or American lines have been initiated in several\r\nEuropean countries, and such libraries are now to be found in Norway,\r\nHolland and Germany. In some cases endowed or university or royal\r\nlibraries are recognized or partly supported by the State or the\r\nmunicipal authorities, but so far no European nation has passed a\r\ngeneral library law which gives communities direct control of the\r\nestablishment, organization and support of public libraries by means of\r\na tax or rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=10.= It is fitting to close this chapter with a brief reference to\r\n=future library legislation in Great Britain=. The most urgent and\r\ninsistent need, without which further development is impossible, is to\r\nremove or raise the limitation of one penny in the pound on the library\r\nrate, which was fixed by the Act of 1855. Over forty places, including\r\nnearly all the large towns, have acquired extended rating powers by\r\nmeans of special local Acts, but such a course is practically\r\nprohibitive in the small towns, where relief is generally needed most.\r\nIn view of the growth of the demand for branch libraries, technical and\r\ncommercial departments, children’s reading-rooms, and for educational\r\nwork in many directions--extensions certainly never contemplated by the\r\noriginal Acts--the penny limitation is an anachronism, which it was the\r\nbusiness of Parliament to have removed long ago. Another anomaly which\r\npresses for remedy is that the County Councils, alone of all the related\r\nlocal government bodies, such as Borough and Urban District Councils,\r\nhave no expressed power of adopting the Libraries Acts. The consequence\r\nhas been detrimental to the establishment of village libraries. A Parish\r\nCouncil may adopt the Acts, and a few parishes have done so, but the\r\nyield of a penny rate in a parish is so small that in most cases it is\r\nimpossible to meet even necessary administrative expenses, with nothing\r\nwhatever left over for books and papers. It is not surprising in these\r\ncircumstances that the rural population of the country is still deprived\r\nof the social and educational advantages of the public library. What is\r\nobviously indicated is a larger administrative authority, such as the\r\nCounty Council, which could group the parishes, pool the income from the\r\nrate, and administer from one centre a system of travelling libraries,\r\ncombined with local stationary collections of books and the provision of\r\nsuitable reading-rooms in the various districts. Such schemes have been\r\ninitiated in about a dozen counties by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust\r\nin conjunction with the County Councils, but while the Scottish\r\nEducation Act of 1918 gives County Education Authorities power to\r\nprovide and maintain libraries, there is no mention of libraries in the\r\nEnglish Education Act of 1918. These and other needed reforms in the\r\nlibrary law are made in a Bill, now being promoted by the Library\r\nAssociation, which every well-wisher of the movement must hope will\r\nreceive the sanction of the Legislature without further delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n=11.= The solution of the problem may, indeed, come from another\r\ndirection, as the present President of the Board of Education (Mr H. A.\r\nL. Fisher) indicated in an interview with a library deputation (April\r\n1919) that the powers relating to public libraries then held by the\r\nLocal Government Board were to be transferred to another department. The\r\nBoard of Education was thus indicated, and it may be that new sources of\r\nsupport, means of co-ordination, and possibly periodical Government\r\ninspection of libraries, may flow from the transfer; but it is too early\r\nto speculate upon the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=12.

Methods of Adopting the Public Libraries Acts.=--There are only two\r\nmethods prescribed by the Libraries Acts under which public libraries\r\ncan be established. In rural parishes a parish meeting, called upon a\r\nrequisition signed by ten or more voters and held at the time and place\r\nappointed, may adopt the Acts by a bare majority of those present and\r\nvoting. At least seven days’ notice of the meeting must be given, but it\r\nis better to allow a month. Should a poll be demanded, it must be\r\nconducted by ballot according to the rules laid down by the Local\r\nGovernment Board. Full particulars, including forms of requisition, will\r\nbe found in Chambers and Fovargue’s _Law Relating to Public Libraries_,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n=15.= As already stated in Section 4, any county borough, urban\r\ndistrict, burgh or other similar authority may adopt the Libraries Acts\r\nby a resolution of the council, without reference to the voters. A\r\nmonth’s notice of motion must be given in the customary form, and a bare\r\nmajority of the council can pass the resolution. A copy of the\r\nresolution adopting the Acts must be sent to the Local Government Board,\r\nand it must also be advertised in the local papers and posted on the\r\ndoors of all the churches and chapels--where such notices are usually\r\nposted. It is best to make the resolution state a particular date when\r\nthe Acts are to come into operation, as is required by the Scotch Act.\r\nIn some places the Acts after being adopted have been allowed to become\r\na dead-letter owing to neglect of this necessary precaution. As the\r\nurban districts and burghs are given power to fix the amount of rate\r\nwithin the limitation of one penny, it is not necessary to include in\r\nthe resolution adopting the Acts any stipulation as to the amount of\r\nrate. A useful form of resolution is as follows:\r\n\r\n  That the Public Libraries Act [_state date of principal Act_] and all\r\n  subsequent Acts amending the same be, and are hereby adopted, for the\r\n  county borough of -------- [_state place_], and shall be in force\r\n  throughout the borough [_or other area_] on and after the . . . . . .\r\n  day of . . . . . . . . [_state year_].\r\n\r\n\r\n=16.= As the power of adopting the Acts in populous areas is now vested\r\nin the local authorities, there is no longer, as formerly, any need to\r\neducate opinion among ratepayers as to the necessity for establishing\r\npublic libraries. The Library Association has issued a useful pamphlet,\r\n_The Establishment of Public Libraries_, 1909, and most of the other\r\npropagandist literature of a useful kind appears in the various books of\r\nMr Thomas Greenwood (_Public Libraries_, _British Library Year Book_,\r\netc.), and these should be consulted by anyone in a rural parish who\r\ndesires to raise the question in a practical form. As regards urban\r\ndistricts the initiative may safely be left in the hands of the\r\nintelligent members of council, who will sooner or later move in the\r\ndirection of placing their districts in line with all the other large\r\ntowns in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=17.= At present about 534 towns and districts in the United Kingdom\r\nhave adopted the Public Libraries Acts, or local Acts, and this number\r\nincludes every large town in the country. The principal areas still\r\nunprovided with public libraries are the Metropolitan Borough of\r\nMarylebone and the towns and districts of Bacup, Crewe, Scarborough,\r\nSwindon, Govan, Leith, Pollokshaws and Wishaw; together with Dover,\r\nJarrow, Llandudno and Weymouth, which, though they have adopted the\r\nActs, have taken no steps to put them into force.\r\n\r\n\r\n=18. Endowments.=--Little need be said about the foundation of public\r\nlibraries by endowment or bequest. The wills of Stephen Mitchell and\r\nGeorge Baillie, of Glasgow, are models of what a liberal bequest should\r\nbe, both as regards the amounts bequeathed and the conditions laid down\r\nfor the formation of the library itself. The practical condition\r\nattached to all the gifts made by Mr Andrew Carnegie and Mr J. Passmore\r\nEdwards for public library purposes should be adopted by every\r\nbenefactor who proposes to found a library. This is the very sensible\r\none that, if the gift of money is accepted by the community, the local\r\nauthority must adopt the Public Libraries Acts, in order to maintain the\r\nlibrary in a state of efficiency for all time. The only alteration\r\nsuggested in the form of future bequests is that, when money is offered\r\nto a small town on the condition that it adopts the Libraries Acts, the\r\nwhole of the gift should not necessarily take the form of a building\r\nfund. Small towns usually have very inadequate incomes from the library\r\nrate, and for this reason it might be wise if a fair proportion of the\r\ngift were directed to be invested as a book fund. A large library\r\nbuilding without books is by no means as useful to the people as a much\r\nless ambitious building provided with a fund which permits of the annual\r\npurchase of £50 to £100 worth of books, independently of the library\r\nrate. At the same time, the endowment of libraries in the manner\r\nsuggested would not always act as an encouragement to town councils to\r\nprovide proper funds for libraries; indeed, it might act as an excuse\r\nfor withholding them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=19. Appointment of Committees.=--The first step after the Libraries\r\nActs have been adopted by a local authority will be the appointment of a\r\ncommittee, and it is desirable that only capable men should be elected.\r\nThe best interests of the library will be served by a committee\r\nconsisting of good business men and literary or professional men or\r\nwomen, in about equal proportions. It is quite evident that the\r\nlegislature did not contemplate the formation of public libraries by\r\ncommittees consisting exclusively of the rank and file of local\r\nauthorities, who are chiefly concerned with paving, drainage and other\r\nequally material matters. By Section 15, Sub-section 3, of the “Public\r\nLibraries Act, 1892,” it is ordained that “an urban authority may if it\r\nthink fit appoint a committee and delegate to it all or any of its\r\npowers and duties under this section, and the said committee shall to\r\nthe extent of such delegation be deemed to be the library authority.\r\nPersons appointed to be members of the committee need not be a member of\r\nthe urban authority.” The “Public Libraries (Ireland) Amendment Act,\r\n1877,” gives similar power to elect members outside the local authority.\r\nSection 4 ordains that “the committee in which the general management,\r\nregulation and control of such libraries, museums or schools may be\r\nvested under the provisions of the 12th Section of the principal Act may\r\nconsist in part of persons not members of the council or board or\r\ncommissioners.” By the “Public Libraries Consolidation (Scotland) Act,\r\n1887,” Section 18 ordains that the local authority shall “appoint a\r\ncommittee, consisting of not less than ten nor more than twenty members,\r\nhalf of whom shall be chosen from amongst the magistrates and council,\r\nor board, as the case may be, and the remaining half from amongst the\r\nhouseholders of the burgh or parish other than the magistrates and\r\ncouncil, or board, and three members of such committee shall form a\r\nquorum.” It is further ordained, Section 21, that this committee “shall\r\nmanage, regulate and control all libraries and museums established under\r\nthis Act, or to which this Act applies; and shall have power to do all\r\nthings necessary for such management.” It is thus clear that local\r\nauthorities are fully empowered to select the best expert advice it is\r\npossible to obtain in the district, and that the administration of the\r\nlibrary should not rest entirely in the hands of the local authority. It\r\nis therefore advisable that library committees, while consisting of a\r\nmajority of members of the local authority, should be strengthened by a\r\ngood proportion of members selected from among the best qualified\r\ncitizens. The principle of co-option is compulsory in the case of\r\nEducation Committees, and so far as this principle is concerned the\r\narguments for its adoption on Library Committees are equally cogent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=20. Constitution of Committees.=--The portions of the Acts already\r\nquoted make it plain that in Scotland the library committees shall be\r\nindependent bodies, with power to provide everything necessary, without\r\nrequiring the sanction of the local authorities, or doing more than from\r\ntime to time reporting their proceedings. In Ireland, under Section 12\r\nof the principal Act, “the general management, regulation and control of\r\nsuch libraries and museums, etc., shall be, as to any borough, vested in\r\nand exercised by the council or board, and as to any town, in and by the\r\ntown commissioners, _or such committee as they respectively may from\r\ntime to time appoint, who may from time to time purchase and provide the\r\nnecessary fuel, books, appoint and dismiss officers, make rules_,” etc.\r\nThis approximates closely to the English law, which differs from that of\r\nthe Scottish in leaving the power of appointing an independent or\r\nsemi-independent library committee in the discretion of the local\r\nauthority. The English Act has already been quoted in the previous\r\nsection, and it now remains to give reasons why every Public Library\r\nCommittee should be independent of the control of the local authority,\r\nsave for certain purposes. The fact that, in Scotland, the hybrid\r\ncomposition of the committee is regarded as a reason for making it\r\npractically independent of the local authority offers a strong argument\r\nin favour of a similar course being pursued in England and Ireland. A\r\nmixed committee is entitled to act without the special sanction of the\r\nlocal authority, if only for the reason that all its members cannot take\r\npart in the ratifying proceedings of the council or board. It seems\r\nillogical to invite capable citizens who are not members of the council\r\nto pass certain resolutions and then submit them for confirmation to a\r\ncouncil on which they have no vote or voice. Furthermore, a committee of\r\nany kind appointed to administer an Act, like the Public Libraries Act,\r\nwhich lays down clearly what may be done and how much may be expended,\r\ndoes not require the same kind of oversight and control as an ordinary\r\ncommittee appointed for some municipal purpose with comparatively\r\nunlimited powers of expenditure. No committee appointed for an\r\neducational purpose should be subject to the delays and difficulties\r\ncaused by having to submit all its proceedings for confirmation by a\r\nsuperior authority. All these arguments furnish reasons why local\r\nauthorities in England and Ireland should follow Scotland in giving\r\nPublic Library Committees a complete or partial delegation of powers\r\nunder the Public Libraries Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=21. Delegation of Powers.=--A delegation of powers under the various\r\nsections of the Acts quoted should provide for a fair measure of\r\nindependence for the committee, with a fair share of general control on\r\nthe part of the local authority. As a matter of policy, as well as in\r\nthe public interest, it is very desirable to maintain harmonious\r\nrelations between a central board and its acting committees, and for\r\nthese reasons information as to the proceedings of a committee should\r\nalways be available, if required. But, for the reasons already set\r\nforth, a Public Library Committee should be a _reporting_ and not merely\r\na _recommending_ body. With the exception of public libraries in the\r\nMetropolitan Boroughs, which are compelled by Section 8 (3) of the\r\n“London Government Act, 1899,” to receive the sanction of the Borough\r\nCouncil and its Finance Committee for expenditures over £50, every\r\nPublic Library Committee in England and Ireland should be constituted\r\nunder a special delegation of powers, such as was contemplated and\r\nauthorized by the Acts already quoted. A fair and workable form of\r\ndelegation of powers, which has been adopted with good results, is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  That the [_name of authority_] hereby delegates to the Public Library\r\n  Committee all the powers and duties vested in it as the Library\r\n  Authority under the Public Libraries Acts, 1892, and all subsequent\r\n  amendments, with the following reservations:--\r\n\r\n  1. The sanction and raising of loans for new buildings or other\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\n  2. The making and collection of the annual library rate.\r\n\r\n  3. The confirmation of agreements with adjoining library authorities\r\n  for the joint use of libraries.\r\n\r\n  4. The confirmation of the appointment or dismissal of the librarian.\r\n\r\n  5. The sanction of any scheme for the formation of branch libraries.\r\n\r\n  6. The proceedings of the Public Library Committee to be reported\r\n  monthly to the [_name of authority_], but only for confirmation and\r\n  sanction as regards Clauses 1 to 5 of this constitution.\r\n\r\n  7. The librarian to act as clerk to the Public Library Committee.\r\n\r\nAs regards Metropolitan Borough Councils, it may be desirable to add a\r\nclause to the effect that no expenditure exceeding £50 be incurred\r\nwithout an estimate being first obtained by the Finance Committee of the\r\nBorough Council. But it is doubtful, if even this restriction is\r\nnecessary, if, when the rate is made, the Borough Finance Committee\r\npasses an estimate for the whole amount of the public library rate, to\r\nbe expended on general library purposes according to a budget or scheme\r\nprepared by the Public Library Committee. This will get over the\r\ndifficulty of having to obtain fresh estimates every time £50 worth of\r\nbooks is ordered. The “Public Libraries Act (Amendments) Act, 1901,”\r\ncontains a clause making it quite clear that for library purposes a\r\nMetropolitan Borough is an urban district.\r\n\r\n\r\n=22. Standing Orders.=--The standing orders or bye-laws regulating\r\nPublic Library Committees need not be very elaborate. Generally, they\r\nshould be the same as those governing other committees of the local\r\nauthority, with the exceptions as to powers. The committee should be\r\nelected annually by the local authority, and the number of members\r\nshould be small rather than large. The needs of districts differ, but a\r\nPublic Library Committee of over twelve may be an encumbrance rather\r\nthan a help to the institution. At the same time a larger committee\r\nmeans a larger representation on the Council, and help from more people\r\nwho are actually or nominally interested in the library service.\r\nProbably the largest committee in England is that at Wallasey, which has\r\nthirty members, of whom thirteen are Council members. Where such large\r\ncommittees exist it is usually found that the actual executive work\r\ndevolves upon a sub-committee, such as the Book Sub-Committee. Meetings\r\nare generally held once a month; certainly there is ordinarily no\r\noccasion for the committee to be called more often, and in some towns a\r\nquarterly meeting is found to be sufficient. A chairman should be\r\nelected annually by the committee; he should invariably be a Council\r\nmember, as he is the natural representative of the committee on the\r\nCouncil; but the vice-chairman may fittingly be a co-opted member. The\r\nprinciple of a constant change of chairmen, adopted in some Councils, is\r\na bad one on a Library Committee, as the work is quite different, in\r\nmany respects, from other departments of the public service, and\r\nknowledge and experience are required if a sound and consistent library\r\npolicy is to be pursued. This is impossible under a system in which\r\nchairmen come and go annually. The same remarks apply to the committee\r\nas a whole; its personnel should remain reasonably stable. Three members\r\nshould form a quorum. The committee should control its own clerk, who\r\nought to be the librarian, although, as we have implied, this is by no\r\nmeans generally the case, and, indeed, is sometimes impossible under the\r\nstanding orders of the Council. The Public Libraries Acts require that a\r\nseparate account be kept of receipts and expenditure from the library\r\nrate, and library committees should see that this is done in all cases\r\nwhere the accounts are kept and payments made by the Council officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n=23. Duties of Committees.=--To a considerable extent these are fixed by\r\nthe delegation of powers granted and the standing orders adopted. But\r\nthere are certain broad principles which should be observed by library\r\ncommittees in the ultimate interest of their work. The chief of these is\r\nthat the committee is concerned rather with library policy than with\r\nlibrary administration; with what shall be done rather than with how it\r\nshall be done. The administration, planning, arrangement, methods,\r\netc., of a library are technical matters purely appertaining to the\r\nlibrarian; and many libraries are stultified by well-meant and\r\nconscientious interference in details of this character by library\r\ncommittees. The committee has the right, and it is its duty, to expect\r\nthe results of its policy to be visibly effective in the library\r\nservice, but it should confide the means of obtaining those results to\r\nits librarian; only in this way can the special training which\r\nlibrarians now bring to their work be made of maximum use to the\r\ncommunity. With the modifications implied in these principles the duties\r\nof the committee cover:\r\n\r\n  1. General oversight of buildings, staff and the work of the various\r\n  departments of the library.\r\n\r\n  2. Careful supervision of the selection of books.\r\n\r\n  3. Compilation and revision of public rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n  4. Regular checking of accounts and expenditures, including those of\r\n  all officers.\r\n\r\n  5. Regular meetings on fixed dates.\r\n\r\n  6. Every member of committee should become acquainted with the\r\n  elements of public library administration, and for this purpose should\r\n  possess copies of all the live Acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n=24.= To cover the work effectively, various sub-committees are\r\nnecessary, which should be small, but large enough to give each member\r\nof the committee an actual interest in some definite department of\r\nlibrary work. Usually the sub-committees appointed include a _Book_\r\nSub-Committee, which undertakes the examining of all lists of books\r\nsuggested for purchase; an _Accounts_ Sub-Committee, to which all\r\nfinancial matters are committed; and a _Staff_ Sub-Committee, which is\r\nconcerned with the appointment, dismissal, remuneration, and training of\r\nthe employees. Some of the large libraries have a _Buildings_\r\nSub-Committee to regulate the proper maintenance of library properties;\r\n_Lectures and Extension_ Sub-Committee; _Branches_ Sub-Committee; and\r\nsuch other groupings as the local circumstances warrant. In most cases,\r\nhowever, the needs of the authority are met by the three sub-committees\r\nfirst-named; and the multiplying of sub-committees is not desirable\r\nwhere there is not enough business to keep them interested and\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=25.

The Library Rate.=--The general library Acts passed for Ireland,\r\nScotland and England all limit the amount to be raised by rate for\r\nlibrary purposes to one penny in the pound on the annual rateable rental\r\nof all properties within the areas, with certain exceptions or\r\nmodifications as to gardens and agricultural lands. Great doubt exists\r\nas to what is meant by a penny rate and on what value it is to be\r\nlevied. Some authorities maintain that the income from a penny rate can\r\nonly represent the net sum realized by a penny on the rateable value,\r\nafter all deductions have been made on account of empty houses and other\r\nirrecoverable items. Against this may be set the actual practice in\r\nseveral places, of paying over the full sum which a penny rate on the\r\nnominal rateable value would produce, without any deductions whatsoever.\r\nAs the Public Libraries Acts have placed a limitation on the amount of\r\nthe library rate, it may be assumed that the libraries were intended to\r\nbenefit to the full extent of the rateable value. At any rate the Acts\r\nare silent on the point, and practice differs so much that it is fair to\r\nsay that a public library, because of the present limitation, and\r\nbecause some places now give the full product, is entitled to the full\r\namount which a penny rate would yield when calculated on the full\r\nrateable value of the town or district, without deduction of any kind,\r\neither for unproductive properties or cost of collection. It has been\r\ndecided that no deduction can be made from the income produced by the\r\nlibrary rate on account of the cost of collection, and as this rate is\r\nnow collected as part of a general or other unlimited rate, it seems\r\nunfair to saddle it with any part of the cost of collection. If it were\r\ncollected as a separate rate, or with rates similarly limited by Act of\r\nParliament, the position would be different. The difference between the\r\namount paid over to public libraries and the actual sums which would be\r\nproduced were the rate charged on the full rateable value is sometimes\r\nconsiderable. The losses range from over 20 to 5 per cent., and thus a\r\nconsiderable limit is placed upon the book-purchasing power of a large\r\nnumber of libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=28. Unexpended Balances.=--In some places the local authority has\r\nappropriated unexpended balances of the public library rate and applied\r\nthem to other local purposes. This action is clearly illegal, and could\r\nonly have been taken by those who are ignorant of the decisions of the\r\nLocal Government Board on the point. It is true the Acts do not specify\r\nhow unexpended balances of the library rate are to be dealt with, but it\r\nis equally true that as the money was raised under a special Act for a\r\nstrictly defined purpose, it cannot be diverted to any other purpose,\r\nnor can it be carried forward as a portion of the library rate for a\r\nsucceeding year. No doubt the wording of the Act is responsible for the\r\ninterpretation which has been put upon the section entitled “Limitations\r\non expenditure for purpose of Act.” It reads: “A rate or addition to a\r\nrate shall not be levied for the purposes of this Act for any one\r\nfinancial year in any library district to an amount exceeding one penny\r\nin the pound.” The Local Government Board have decided that any\r\nunexpended balances of the library income must be carried forward to\r\nnext year’s library account, without prejudice to the next year’s\r\nlibrary income. This decision has been upheld by all the district\r\nauditors of the Local Government Board, and it is difficult to\r\nunderstand the reason why a few places still cling to the belief that\r\nthe library rate can be further limited by this illegal procedure of\r\nappropriating unexpended balances. Committees who are threatened with\r\nthis action can always protect themselves against the injustice by\r\ntaking care that there are no balances to appropriate; but it will\r\nprevent them from saving a little money for necessary book purchases,\r\ncleaning or other purposes. It should be pointed out, furthermore, that\r\nthe section of the Act above quoted does not really refer to the total\r\n_amount_ to be raised by rate in a given year, but only to the\r\n_poundage_ or rate which may be charged for library purposes, namely,\r\nnot more than a penny in the pound. The question of the _product_ of\r\nthis rate of a penny is not mentioned anywhere in the Acts, and it is\r\nthis lack of clear definition--the failure to distinguish the amount of\r\na rate from the total amount which it will produce annually--which is\r\nresponsible for many of the difficulties hitherto met with in\r\nadministering the Libraries Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=29. Annual Estimates.=--The Scotch principal Act is the only one which\r\nrequires an annual estimate or budget to be prepared by the library\r\nauthority for the information of the local authority. Section 30 of the\r\nAct of 1887 provides that “The Committee shall in the month of April in\r\nevery year make up, or cause to be made up, an estimate of the sums\r\nrequired in order to defray the interest of any money borrowed, the\r\npayment of the sinking fund, and the expense of maintaining and managing\r\nall libraries and museums under its control for the year after\r\nWhitsunday then next to come, and for the purpose of purchasing the\r\nbooks, articles and things authorized by this Act,” etc. This estimate\r\nhas to be submitted to the local authority, who “shall provide the\r\namount required out of the library rate to be levied by it, and shall\r\npay over to the committee the sum necessary for the annual expenditure\r\nby it in terms of its estimate.” By the standing orders of most local\r\nauthorities yearly or half-yearly estimates have to be prepared and\r\nsubmitted by the various committees, and as practice varies everywhere,\r\nit will be well for the library authority to follow the local practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n=30.= Local circumstances alter the conditions materially in every\r\nplace, and hitherto there has been a lack of uniformity in presenting\r\nfinancial statements which makes any attempt to produce a model budget\r\nto be suspect. The form of the statement is often governed by the\r\npractice of the Borough Accountant, who arranges the order of items in\r\naccordance with his own views; but wherever it is possible to do so, it\r\nwould be well if the form of annual estimate conformed with the order\r\nadopted in the report made by Professor W. G. S. Adams to the Carnegie\r\nUnited Kingdom Trust in 1915, _On Library Provision and Policy_, which\r\nwould arrange in some such order as in the table on page 46.\r\n\r\nEach of these items will probably need analysis, and the order given\r\nhere may be inverted; indeed, the form shown is merely meant to be\r\nsuggestive and to show the nature of the information which the Council\r\nusually requires when it is considering the annual estimates.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMITTEE ESTIMATE, 1919.           |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |_Expenditure._                                                |\r\n  +--------+--------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  | Actual |                          |Estimate| Actual |Estimate|\r\n  | 1917.  |                          |  1918. |  1918. |  1919. |\r\n  +--------+--------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  | 1. £897|Books and Binding         |   £900 |  £910  |  £920  |\r\n  | 2. £300|Newspapers and Periodicals|   £350 |  £380  |  £380  |\r\n  | 3. etc.|Salaries and Wages        |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 4.     |Rent and Loans            |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 5.     |Rates and Taxes           |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 6.     |Maintenance:              |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 7.     |  Lighting                |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 8.     |  Heating                 |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 9.     |  Cleaning                |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  |10.     |Balance                   |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  +--------+--------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |_Income_                           |        |        |        |\r\n  +--------+--------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  | 1.     |From 0d. rate             |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  | 2.     |From other sources        |    ..  |   ..   |   ..   |\r\n  +--------+--------------------------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.--Form for Annual Estimates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=31.= The distribution of the income over the various items is again\r\nsubject to local circumstances; but, thanks to the inquiry of Professor\r\nAdams, a table of comparative distribution of income drawn from the\r\nfigures of about 500 library systems throughout the kingdom has been\r\npublished, which gives the best information at present available. It is\r\nqualified by the facts we have emphasized in the last paragraph, and\r\nstill more by the changed conditions which result from the European War,\r\nwhich have increased such items as salaries, and reduced the\r\nbook-purchasing (and indeed every other purchasing) power of libraries\r\nconsiderably. We give the table of percentages of expenditure for\r\nlibraries with, and without, loans, merely remarking that it may serve\r\nas a rough guide by which library committees may work. Again, the\r\nlibrarian, in submitting his budget for the use of his committee, will\r\nanalyse the items into general administrative, central, reference and\r\nbranch libraries’ expenditure, and under each will show salaries as\r\ndistinct from wages paid for unskilled service; and books will be\r\ndivided into “new,” “replacements,” etc.; periodicals into those filed\r\npermanently and others; maintenance charges into building expenses,\r\nfurniture and fittings, stationery, repairs to fabric and furniture, and\r\nso on. The Council as a rule does not require so detailed a statement.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFIED PERCENTAGES OF LIBRARY EXPENDITURE\r\n\r\n                      LIBRARIES WITH LOAN CHARGES.\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n  |         |        | Peri- |       |      |      |Other Items,|     |\r\n  |         | Books  |odicals|       |Rents |Rates | including  |     |\r\n  | Income. |  and   |  and  | Sala- | and  | and  |Maintenance |Total|\r\n  |         |Binding.| News- | ries. |Loans.|Taxes.|of Premises,|     |\r\n  |         |        |papers.|       |      |      |Light, Heat,|     |\r\n  |         |        |       |       |      |      |     &c.    |     |\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n  |    £    |    %   |    %  |    %  |    % |   %  |       %    |   % |\r\n  |8000     |        |       |       |      |      |            |     |\r\n  |   & over|  19·06 |  4·96 | 37·5  | 15·46| 2·41 |    20·58   |99·97|\r\n  |4000-8000|  18·81 |  5·31 | 39·96 | 12·54| 1·81 |    21·55   |99·98|\r\n  |3000-4000|  17·97 |  6·07 | 41·74 | 17·42| 1·09 |    15·68   |99·97|\r\n  |2000-3000|  19·53 |  6·44 | 39·33 | 13·5 | 2·38 |    18·78   |99·96|\r\n  |1500-2000|  21·09 |  6·24 | 37·87 | 13·13| 2·3  |    19·01   |99·64|\r\n  |1000-1500|  19·07 |  7·43 | 37·18 | 16·47| 2·21 |    17·62   |99·98|\r\n  | 750-1000|  17·58 |  7·81 | 38·97 | 10·8 | 2·22 |    22·6    |99·86|\r\n  | 500- 750|  17·55 | 10·88 | 36·32 | 11·81| 3·10 |    20·22   |99·88|\r\n  | 250- 500|  13·12 | 10·25 | 38·9  | 15·09| 4·00 |    18·61   |99·97|\r\n  | 100- 250|  16·31 | 13·13 | 33·63 | 21·31| 3·14 |    12·45   |99·97|\r\n  |Under 100|  14·32 | 16·15 | 25·84 | 24·48| 2·66 |    19·52   |99·97|\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n\r\n                     LIBRARIES WITHOUT LOAN CHARGES.\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n  |         |        | Peri- |       |      |      |Other Items,|     |\r\n  |         | Books  |odicals|       |Rents |Rates | including  |     |\r\n  | Income. |  and   |  and  | Sala- | and  | and  |Maintenance |Total|\r\n  |         |Binding.| News- | ries. |Loans.|Taxes.|of Premises,|     |\r\n  |         |        |papers.|       |      |      |Light, Heat,|     |\r\n  |         |        |       |       |      |      |     &c.    |     |\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n  |    £    |     %  |    %  |    %  |    % |   %  |       %    |   % |\r\n  |1000     |        |       |       |      |      |            |     |\r\n  |   & over|  19·93 |  6·37 | 39·22 |  ..  | 2·03 |    32·43   |99·98|\r\n  | 750-1000|  25·4  |  7·95 | 44·17 |  ..  | 3·16 |    19·29   |99·97|\r\n  | 500- 750|  20·31 |  9·98 | 45·49 |  ..  | 3·86 |    20·23   |99·97|\r\n  | 400- 500|  18·48 | 10·07 | 40·90 |  ..  | 5·81 |    24·6    |99·86|\r\n  | 300- 400|  15·9  | 12·31 | 46·91 |  ..  | 2·9  |    21·9    |99·92|\r\n  | 200- 300|  17·13 | 13·25 | 42·98 |  ..  | 4·00 |    22·61   |99·97|\r\n  | 100- 200|  16·2  | 15·66 | 45·1  |  ..  | 2·54 |    20·47   |99·97|\r\n  |  50- 100|  20·16 | 15·82 | 34·29 |  ..  | 5·68 |    24·02   |99·97|\r\n  |Under 50 |  28·65 | 21·85 | 36·46 |  ..  | 2·26 |    10·75   |99·97|\r\n  +---------+--------+-------+-------+------+------+------------+-----+\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.--Returns compiled from Professor Adams’ Report on Library\r\nProvision and Policy [Carnegie United Kingdom Trust], Sec. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n=32.= We must consider in some detail the principal expenditures to\r\nwhich library committees are subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n=33. Loans.=--The Libraries Acts give fairly full instructions as to\r\nloans for public library purposes. In England under the principal Act\r\n“every library authority, with the sanction of the Local Government\r\nBoard . . . may borrow money for the purposes of this Act on the\r\nsecurity of any fund or rate applicable for those purposes.” In parishes\r\nthe regulations for borrowing prescribed by the “Local Government Act,\r\n1894,” are to apply. As a preliminary to borrowing, an inquiry is held\r\nlocally by a Local Government Board inspector, who receives evidence as\r\nto proposed buildings, sites, amount required, etc., and also hears\r\nobjections to the proposal. The Local Government Board print bills\r\nannouncing the inquiry, and these must be posted and paid for by the\r\nlibrary authority. At such inquiries full particulars should be prepared\r\nas to income, date of adopting Acts, etc., as well as particulars of the\r\nproposed scheme. After the inquiry is held it is generally about three\r\nmonths later before the sanction of the Board is received. This states\r\nthe amount sanctioned and for what period the money can be borrowed for\r\nsites, buildings, furniture or books, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe security for loans is declared by the “Public Health Act, 1875,”\r\nSection 233, to be the “credit of any fund or all or any rates or rate\r\nout of which they are authorized to defray expenses incurred by them in\r\nthe execution of this Act.” And it is further laid down that “they may\r\nmortgage to the persons by or on behalf of whom such sums are advanced\r\nany such fund or rates or rate.” It thus appears that neither library\r\nbuildings nor the library rate can be mortgaged for the purposes of\r\nlibrary loans, but only the rate or rates out of which the expenses of\r\nthe Public Health Act are paid. This practically means the general rate\r\nof a district.\r\n\r\n\r\n=34.= The Local Government Board will fix the period for which sums of\r\nmoney for particular purposes may be borrowed. Generally the periods are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  For sites or lands                                     60 or 50 years.\r\n   „  buildings (including fixtures like counters,\r\n        screens, wall and standard bookcases, wall\r\n        newspaper slopes, barriers, etc.)                30 years.[1]\r\n   „  books                                              10   „\r\n   „  furniture (tables, chairs, desks, and movable\r\n        furniture only)                                  10   „\r\n\r\n  [1] A loan for purchasing an existing building will not be sanctioned\r\n      by the Local Government Board for a period exceeding twenty or\r\n      twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe money may be borrowed from the Public Works Loan Commissioners,\r\nCounty Councils, Banks, Friendly Societies or private individuals. The\r\nrate of interest varies, according to the state of the money market.\r\nFour per cent. may be regarded as an average interest at present, but\r\nlibrary authorities have borrowed for as low as 3 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=35.= The methods of repayment vary, and this must be entirely a matter\r\nfor local arrangement, and should follow the practice in vogue with\r\nother municipal loans. An equalized repayment of principal and interest\r\non the annuity system has the advantage of distributing the payments\r\nuniformly over the whole period, and of placing part of the burden on\r\nsucceeding ratepayers as well as upon those who establish the library.\r\nThis is much fairer than making the pioneer ratepayers practically bear\r\nthe whole foundation cost of establishing an institution which increases\r\nin its value to the community as it progresses. On the other hand,\r\nbuildings are sure to depreciate in value, and the question of repairs\r\nis a constant one, so that some authorities maintain that loans on\r\nstructures should be paid off by annually diminishing instalments of\r\nprincipal and interest. In Scotland repayments of principal must be made\r\nfrom a sinking fund which is to be formed from a certain proportion of\r\nthe rate put aside annually.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for negotiating a loan and drawing up the necessary\r\ndeeds should be placed in the hands of a solicitor, but in many cases\r\nthe accountant or town clerk of the district is responsible for all\r\narrangements, and will see that the deed is duly sealed as prescribed by\r\nthe Act.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this it should be noted that by Section 237 of the\r\n“Public Health Act, 1875,” a register of the mortgages on each rate must\r\nbe kept, and that “within fourteen days after the date of any mortgage\r\nan entry shall be made in the register of the number and date thereof,\r\nand of the names and description of the parties thereto, as stated in\r\nthe deed.” Furthermore, “every such register shall be open to public\r\ninspection during office hours at the said office [local authority’s\r\noffice] without fee or reward.” As the auditor will call for this\r\nregister, the clerk to the library authority should see that it is\r\nprovided, if the local authority has not already done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n=36.= The arrangements for loans in Ireland and Scotland are somewhat\r\nsimilar to those just described. In Ireland no power to borrow was given\r\nunder the principal Act, but the Amendment Act of 1877 gives the power,\r\nprovided the commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury approve. The\r\nCommissioners of Public Works in Ireland may lend, and power is given to\r\nmortgage, as security, either the borough fund, town fund, or the\r\nlibrary rate itself. In Scotland the local authority may borrow, without\r\nany other consent, on mortgage or bond on the security of the library\r\nrate, a sum or sums not exceeding the capital sum represented by\r\none-fourth part of the library rate, capitalized at the rate of twenty\r\nyears’ purchase of such sum. A sinking fund must be formed, consisting\r\nof an annual sum equal to one-fiftieth part of the money borrowed, which\r\nis to be invested and applied to the purpose of extinguishing the debt.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the question of loans, it may be well to offer a word of\r\nwarning against the danger of overborrowing, which has very seriously\r\ncrippled the work of various libraries. In some places as much as\r\none-half the library income has to be devoted to the repayment of\r\nprincipal and interest of loans; in others, one-third is similarly\r\nspent. One-fourth is the maximum which in any case should be set apart\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=37. Assessment to Rates and Taxes.=--The assessment of public library\r\nbuildings to rates and taxes has been for long a burning question, and\r\nis still far from final settlement. The limitation of the library rate\r\nto a penny in the pound has always been considered by library\r\nauthorities a strong reason why all additional burdens on the meagre\r\nincome raised thereby should be resisted. But all local authorities and\r\nassessment committees did not think likewise, and a good deal of\r\nfriction resulted.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 was passed “An Act to exempt from County, Borough, Parochial,\r\nand other Local Rates, Land and Buildings occupied by Scientific or\r\nLiterary Societies,” 6 & 7 Vict., c. 36, under which a few public\r\nlibraries obtained certificates of exemption from the payment of local\r\nrates, from the Registrar of Friendly Societies, as allowed by this Act.\r\nSome of these certificates were recognized by the rating authorities,\r\nothers were ignored, and it was frequently maintained that a public\r\nlibrary was not a scientific or literary society within the meaning of\r\nthe Act. In 1896, however, a complete change took place as regards this\r\npoint, by a decision of the House of Lords, which ruled that public\r\nlibraries were literary societies or institutions for the purposes of\r\nthe “Income Tax Act of 1842,” under which such institutions were granted\r\nexemption from the payment of income tax. Although the case, brought by\r\nthe Corporation of Manchester against the Surveyor of Income Tax for\r\nManchester, did not directly refer to the Act of 1843, the decision that\r\npublic libraries were literary institutions effected all that was\r\nnecessary for the purpose of claiming exemption from local rates under\r\nthe “Literary Societies Act of 1843.” A full report of this case and\r\ndecision is printed in the _Library_ for 1896, in the _Times_ law\r\nreports and elsewhere. The effect of this decision was to remove any\r\ndoubt from the mind of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has\r\npower under the Act to grant certificates exempting public libraries\r\nfrom the payment of local rates, and as a result many libraries obtained\r\ncertificates, and now enjoy complete or partial exemption. It is not\r\nnecessary to quote the Act of 1843, which can be obtained for one penny\r\nfrom the King’s printers, but the procedure requisite for obtaining a\r\ncertificate of exemption may be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=38.= An application claiming exemption under the 1843 Act must be\r\naddressed to the Registrar of Friendly Societies at London, Edinburgh or\r\nDublin, as the case may require. With this must be enclosed a copy of\r\nthe rules and regulations of the library, signed by the chairman and\r\nthree members of committee, and countersigned by the clerk or\r\nlibrarian. These rules must include the following, or others in similar\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n1. “The ---- Public Library is a society established for purposes of\r\nliterature and science exclusively.”\r\n\r\n2. “The library is supported in part by a rate levied in accordance with\r\nthe Public Libraries Acts, and in part by annual voluntary contributions\r\nof money and gifts of books and periodicals. The Library Committee shall\r\nnot make any dividend, gift, division or bonus in money unto or between\r\nany of the members.”\r\n\r\nThese two rules are absolutely necessary to a successful application,\r\nand, if not already incorporated, should be included by special\r\nresolution of the library authority before application is made. It is\r\nbest to send printed copies of the rules, and it should be noted that\r\nthree identical copies, all signed, must be sent. On these the registrar\r\nendorses his certificate, and sends one to the Clerk of the Peace for\r\nthe district, one to the library authority, and retains one. The form of\r\ncertificate usually attached is as follows:\r\n\r\n  It is hereby certified that this society is entitled to the benefit of\r\n  the Act 6 & 7 Vict., c. 36, intituled “An Act to exempt from County,\r\n  Borough, Parochial and other Local Rates, Lands and Buildings occupied\r\n  by Scientific or Literary Societies.”\r\n\r\n  Date.\r\n\r\n     _________\r\n    /         \\\r\n   /  Seal of  \\\r\n  | Registry of |\r\n   \\  Friendly  /\r\n    \\Societies./\r\n     \\________/\r\n\r\nThe application should show that annual voluntary contributions of\r\nmoney, books and periodicals are received, but there is no direction\r\nlaid down as to the amount of voluntary contributions which will pass\r\nmuster. The point is somewhat vague, but it may be assumed that the\r\namount received from gifts, subscriptions, sales, books, periodicals,\r\netc., need not form a substantial proportion of the income. As the\r\nEnglish Registrar accepts donations in kind as annual voluntary\r\ncontributions, it is only necessary to value these to make up a\r\nrespectable sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n=39.= Certificates are not granted as a rule in cases where a charge for\r\nadmission is made. Furthermore, it is doubtful if the exemption from\r\nlocal rates would be allowed by hostile local authorities for any\r\noccupied portions of library buildings. A caretaker’s or librarian’s\r\nresidence would in all probability be separately assessed, if the\r\ncertificate were otherwise recognized. By a decision of a Court of\r\nQuarter Sessions at Liverpool in 1905, it has been decided that the\r\nCorporation of Liverpool is liable for local rates on a library\r\nbuilding; but it is not possible to say how far this may affect\r\nlibraries holding these certificates. Legislation is pending, and till\r\nsomething is definitely settled, the question must remain open.\r\n\r\n\r\n=40.= The House of Lords’ decision already noticed also freed public\r\nlibrary buildings from income tax, but it should be distinctly\r\nunderstood that inhabited house duty can be charged for the whole of a\r\nbuilding, even if only partly occupied as a residence, when included\r\nunder one roof, unless it can be shown that the library and residence do\r\nnot communicate directly with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n=41. Insurance.=--Library buildings and their contents should be fully\r\ninsured against fire. To ascertain insurable value take the cost of\r\nbuildings at the contract price, including all charges which would have\r\nto be incurred again for rebuilding; furniture at the contract price;\r\nlending library books at 3s. 4d. per volume all over; and reference\r\nlibrary books at 5s. per volume all over, and thus obtain a total. An\r\nallowance is sometimes made for depreciation, but a full covering value\r\nis always safe. The policy will state these various items separately for\r\nthe purposes of insurance, but will likely charge a uniform percentage\r\non all. 1s. 6d. per cent. is a fair charge in a good office, but\r\ninsurances can be effected for as low as 1s. 3d. per cent. Library\r\nbuildings form a safe risk, and unless in a case of temporary premises\r\nwith bad surroundings, 1s. 6d. per cent. should be regarded as a maximum\r\ncharge. Some offices return the premium once in five years or so by way\r\nof bonus. Insurance policies should be revised every few years to keep\r\npace with the growth of the library. Paintings, valuable MSS. and rare\r\nbooks must be made the subject of special insurances. The same may be\r\nsaid of temporary exhibitions, especially of loan articles, which ought\r\nto be covered by a policy for the period of the show. Plenty of\r\nfire-buckets should be provided in public library buildings to cope with\r\nthe first outbreak of fire. Hydrants, save in large buildings, are not\r\nnecessary, on account of their cost and practical inutility. If a fire\r\ncannot be checked at its onset by means of buckets, it is time to ring\r\nup the fire-brigade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=42.= Another insurance that should be provided is against claims for\r\ndamage or injury to children who use juvenile departments which may be\r\ncaused through any defect in the building or its fittings; and in\r\nconnexion therewith it should be remembered that children cannot legally\r\nbe held contributory by their carelessness or misbehaviour to such\r\naccidents as would cause injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n=43.= Health insurance must be paid by the library committees for all\r\nemployees of sixteen years of age and more who earn less than £250 a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n=44. Contracts, Agreements, Requisitions.=--Contracts for regular\r\nsupplies should be renewed annually. The principal items of this kind\r\nare:\r\n\r\n  Books, bookbinding, periodicals and newspapers, printing, stationery,\r\n  cleaning materials.\r\n\r\nLocal sentiment is generally in favour of procuring all supplies\r\nlocally, where possible, and when this can be done without absolute\r\ndisadvantage to the library it is the most convenient course. Tenders\r\ncan be invited either by public advertisement or on the nomination of\r\nmembers of committee and the librarian. To begin with, public\r\nadvertisement is, perhaps, the fairest way; afterwards, quality of\r\nservice and other considerations will decide. Specifications should be\r\nprepared and sent out according to requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=45.= All specifications and contracts should be carefully preserved.\r\nThe former should be entered up in a specification book, which need be\r\nbut an ordinary foolscap folio blank book, ruled faint. Accepted\r\ncontracts should either be filed in boxes or guard books, or copied into\r\na contracts book similar to the specification book. Accepted estimates\r\nfor occasional work should be fastened to the accounts. It is important\r\nto be able to lay hands on any given document or its terms without the\r\nslightest delay. All tenders for regular supplies and estimates for\r\noccasional work should be opened in committee, in meeting duly convened,\r\nunless by special resolution the librarian or a sub-committee is\r\nauthorized to deal with them. Envelopes, printed with the address of the\r\nlibrary and having the words “Tender for ----” printed boldly in one\r\ncorner, should be enclosed with all invitations for estimates to prevent\r\nthe risk of accidental opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n=46.= In connexion with contracts it is important to note that Public\r\nLibrary Committees and officers are subject to the penal provisions of\r\nthe “Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act, 1889,” 52 & 53 Vict., c. 69,\r\nin the event of bribes or commissions being given or received in\r\nconnexion with pending contracts or supplies. As this does not seem to\r\nbe generally known, the essential words of the Act are quoted:\r\n\r\n  “Every person who corruptly solicits or receives, or agrees to\r\n  receive, for himself, or for any other person, any gift, loan, fee,\r\n  reward, or advantage, as an inducement to any member, officer, or\r\n  servant of a public body, doing or forbearing to do anything in\r\n  respect of any matter or transaction in which such public body is\r\n  concerned; and every person who shall, with the like object, corruptly\r\n  give, promise, or offer any gift, loan, fee, reward, or advantage to\r\n  any person, whether for the benefit of that person or of another,\r\n  shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. Any one convicted of such an\r\n  offence shall be liable to imprisonment for two years, or to a fine of\r\n  £500, or to both imprisonment and fine; and, in addition, be liable to\r\n  pay to such public body the amount or value of any gift, loan, fee, or\r\n  reward so received by him; and be adjudged incapable of holding any\r\n  public office for seven years, and to forfeit any such office held by\r\n  him,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=47.= AGREEMENTS for leases, loans, joint use of libraries with\r\nadjoining authorities, or between committee and librarian or other\r\npersons, should be drawn up by a solicitor. Minor agreements may be\r\ndrawn up by the library authority, but they should all be stamped with a\r\nsixpenny stamp if in connexion with a consideration of £5 and over. The\r\nlegal limits within which agreements between various kinds of library\r\nauthorities can be made are duly set forth in the various Public\r\nLibraries Acts, and, as these matters seldom arise in the course of\r\nordinary library routine, there is no need further to consider the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n=48. Suggestions on Management.=--It is well to keep a book or to\r\nprovide forms to enable readers to make suggestions on the management of\r\nthe library. Frequently such suggestions take the form of complaints,\r\nbut it is a useful thing to allow free opportunity for the expression of\r\npublic opinion. In some libraries separate books are kept for\r\npropositions of new books not in the library and suggestions on\r\nmanagement. A simple form, on which the reader can make suggestions on\r\nmanagement or of books, is preferable. When these forms are made readily\r\navailable, and are kept in public view, together with a locked box in\r\nwhich the slips can be lodged through a slit in the lid, they are much\r\nmore effective as a means of drawing suggestions than special MS. books\r\nwhich have to be asked for. A useful form of slip is the following:--\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |                 LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY.                 |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  | I beg to make the following suggestion (.if a book or    |\r\n  | periodical, please give publisher and price.):--         |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  | ........................................................ |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  | ........................................................ |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  | ........................................................ |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  | ........................................................ |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |       Name.............................................. |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |       Address........................................... |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |       Date.............................................. |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  |   ~Please fold across and leave in “Suggestions” Box.~   |\r\n  |                                                          |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 3.--Suggestion Slip.\r\n\r\nA small locked box to contain these, and lettered on side “Suggestions,”\r\nshould be provided. If one of these boxes is placed in each important\r\ndepartment of the library, readers will be encouraged to air their\r\nviews. Even if nothing more valuable should be received than a complaint\r\nabout a draught or the manner of the librarian, it is better than the\r\ndull indifference and apathy which are met with in libraries where\r\nreaders are discouraged from taking any part in the administration.\r\nOccasionally some brilliant, if impossible, suggestions on management\r\nare received by means of these slips and boxes, and suggestions of\r\ndesirable books can always be depended upon. Every means of interesting\r\nreaders in the work of the library should be adopted, and this will be\r\nfound a very effective method.\r\n\r\n\r\n=49. Accounts.=--By the principal English Act, Section 20 (1), it is\r\nordained that “separate accounts shall be kept of the receipts and\r\nexpenditure under this Act of every library authority and its officers,\r\nand those accounts shall be audited in like manner and with the like\r\nincidents and consequences, in the case of a library authority being an\r\nurban authority, and of its officers, as the accounts of the receipts\r\nand expenditure of that authority and its officers under the Public\r\nHealth Acts.” In Ireland the same provisions apply, that is, library\r\naccounts are to be kept and audited like those of the local authority,\r\nand copies of the accounts are to be sent within one month after\r\nauditing to the Lord Lieutenant. In Scotland the accounts are to be kept\r\nseparately in special books, and are to be audited by “one or more\r\ncompetent auditors.” In all cases the books are to be open to public\r\ninspection, and in Scotland abstracts of the accounts are to be inserted\r\nin one or more newspapers published or circulated in the district.\r\n\r\nNo special system of library book-keeping has been laid down, the\r\nnearest approach to a form being that prescribed by an order of the\r\nLocal Government Board, dated 26th November 1892, for parishes whose\r\nlibrary accounts are audited in like manner to those of Poor Law\r\nGuardians. In Greenwood’s _Public Libraries_, fourth edition, 1894,\r\npages 343-345, some details are given of this system, and the first\r\nedition of this _Manual_ also gives specimens of forms, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=50. Financial Statement.=--The form of financial statement for public\r\nlibraries in parishes, prescribed by the Local Government Board, alluded\r\nto in Section 49, is the best for all purposes. As shown in the section\r\non Annual Estimates, it provides for every kind of receipt and\r\nexpenditure. Printed blanks giving the whole of the items copied from\r\nthe L.G.B. Order of 1892 have been published. In addition to a blank\r\ntabular form for showing particulars of loans, etc., the statement\r\nincludes spaces for the undernoted items, all duly set out to form a\r\nbalance sheet:\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT.\r\n\r\n  RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n  Rates.\r\n  Fines and penalties.\r\n  Donations and subscriptions.\r\n  From parliamentary grants.\r\n  From other local authorities.\r\n  From sale of securities in which sinking fund is invested.\r\n  From all other sources, specifying them.\r\n    Sale of catalogues, etc.\r\n      etc.\r\n\r\n  EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n  Buildings, repairs, maintenance.\r\n  Books, periodicals, etc.\r\n  Salaries and remuneration of officers  and assistants.\r\n  Establishment charges not before included.\r\n  Loans: Principal repaid {Out of invested Sinking Fund.\r\n                          {Otherwise.\r\n    „    Interest.\r\n  Payments to other local authorities.\r\n  Other expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=51. Audit.=--In cases where library accounts are audited under the\r\n“District Auditors’ Act, 1879,” it is imperative that all the forms and\r\nconsequences should be borne in mind. District auditors have power to\r\nsurcharge expenditures for items which in their opinion cannot be\r\nlegally incurred under the provisions of the Public Libraries Acts, and\r\nit should also be remembered that the committee-men who sign the\r\ndisputed cheque are held liable. The powers vested in library\r\nauthorities are so wide that it is very doubtful if some district\r\nauditors are not exceeding their authority by objecting, as they have\r\ndone in some places, to payments for publications, subscriptions to\r\nsocieties, expenses of lectures, and other items. In cases of surcharge\r\nappeal for relief should be made to the Local Government Board, when it\r\nis a first offence, or when there is good grounds for challenging the\r\ndecision of the auditor. The cost of auditing accounts is laid down in\r\nthe “District Auditors’ Act, 1879,” according to the following scale.\r\nThe library authority is required to purchase the necessary stamps to\r\ncover the amount:\r\n\r\n  Under £20                 = £0  5\r\n      £20 and under     £50 =  0 10\r\n       50     „         100 =  1  0\r\n      100     „         500 =  2  0\r\n      500     „       1,000 =  3  0\r\n    1,000     „       2,500 =  4  0\r\n    2,500     „       5,000 =  5  0\r\n    5,000     „      10,000 = 10  0\r\n   10,000     „      20,000 = 15  0\r\n   20,000     „      50,000 = 20  0\r\n   50,000     „     100,000 = 30  0\r\n  100,000 and upwards       = 50  0\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, very few libraries will have to pay more than £10. The\r\ncharges for auditing by a firm of chartered accountants are generally\r\naccording to an agreed scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=52. Rating:=\r\n\r\n  Greenwood, Thomas.

FORM OF\r\nTHE ANNUAL REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\n=55. Statistical Methods.=--It seems desirable to describe here, as\r\nbeing concerned with committee work, the various statistical and other\r\nmethods adopted to show the operations of the library. Every business\r\nconcern of any consequence has what approximates to a statistical\r\ndepartment, in which records are kept and analysed of every transaction\r\nof the business, and from these useful deductions are made. Such\r\nstatistics, with the necessary proviso that the keeping of them should\r\nnot impede more obvious work, are desirable for libraries, and although\r\nthey are necessarily of a quantitative rather than qualitative\r\ncharacter, they are nevertheless of value as showing the use made of the\r\nseveral departments and of the various classes of the stock. Statistics\r\nusually kept include: the stock; accessions; the issue of books and\r\nmaterial in each department according to their classes; the number of\r\nreaders’ tickets in force; and the attendances at the reading rooms.\r\nSometimes records are kept of the occupations and ages of readers, and\r\nthe wards from which they are drawn.\r\n\r\nHitherto all these statistics have been of doubtful comparative value,\r\nowing to the great divergence in the methods of computation adopted, and\r\nthe methods of administering the library have a definite effect upon the\r\nresultant figures. For example, in the few libraries where so brief a\r\ntime as a week is allowed for the reading of a volume, the issue figures\r\nwill be higher than in those where a fortnight or more is allowed. Then,\r\nthe amounts charged as fines for undue detention of books, ranging from\r\n1d. a week or part of a week to 1d. a day beyond the time allowed, make\r\na difference of some moment. Again, in some libraries it is usual to\r\nrecord the number of borrowers continuously, only counting off the\r\nlapsed tickets, while in others only those borrowers who are actually\r\nusing the libraries within the year are counted. It would be well if an\r\neffort were made to standardize all these methods. A scheme for\r\nstandardizing the form in which they are to be presented has been\r\nreached, and is described below (Section 62).\r\n\r\n\r\n=56.= A satisfactory record of the relative circulation of books can be\r\nmade only of a classified stock. Certainly comparisons cannot be fairly\r\nmade while one librarian classes his periodicals as science, useful\r\narts, etc., and another groups his together as miscellaneous. Then, some\r\nlibrarians, rightly we think, separate Juvenile Fiction issues from\r\nAdult Fiction issues; and, indeed, divergences and anomalies are\r\nfrequent and are confusing.\r\n\r\nSuggested rulings for Issue Record books, for lending and reference\r\nlibraries respectively, are given on page 62.\r\n\r\nThe record book should have about thirty-five lines to the page,\r\nexclusive of the headings, to allow one line for each day and leave room\r\nfor adding up the columns. The dates, 1 to 31, may be printed down each\r\ncolumn, but this will mean leaving gaps for Sundays. It is better to\r\nwrite the dates in for each month, omitting Sundays, which may be\r\nentered on a separate page or pages. The issues of each year should be\r\nkept together in a series; and a page or more, as required, should be\r\nleft for the necessary summaries, which can be entered up to show the\r\ntotal issues month by month in cumulative form. If this is done\r\nregularly the figures for the annual or other reports are quite easily\r\nobtained. The accessions book, if kept entered, added and classified up\r\nto date, will give similar information about books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=57.= It is usual to count volumes separately. Thus a work in five\r\nvolumes is counted as 5 in the record. Illustrations, pamphlets,\r\nbroadsides and other material in separate form are usually counted in\r\nthe same way, but are sometimes indicated as being of this separate\r\ncharacter in separate columns. There are minor problems in counting\r\nwhich interest librarians, and upon which opinion is divided. Thus, when\r\na series of prints are formed into a public exhibition, it is sometimes\r\nthe practice to count each print as having been issued once. They may,\r\nhowever, have been examined by hundreds of people during the exhibition,\r\nand sometimes an allowance is made for that fact. Again, the\r\nconsultation of a magazine in the reading rooms is usually not counted;\r\nbut the same magazine when bound is counted if issued from the shelves\r\nin the reference library. Directories, time-tables, and similar\r\nquick-reference works are often omitted from the statistics. There seems\r\nno reason why all these uses of material should not be recorded, so long\r\nas the character of the use is made clear in the reports of the\r\nlibrarian. Otherwise the frequent complaint of librarians that their\r\nfigures represent only part of their work seems to be justified; and it\r\nis well to remember that public criticism of libraries is in the main\r\nbased upon their statistics. At the same time if the recording of\r\nstatistics means the placing of barriers between books and readers, it\r\nis a safe principle to prefer fewer statistics and more accessibility.\r\n\r\n                                      1\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  Month: September 1918.

This does not mean necessarily that tickets not\r\nin active use at the time statistics are compiled should be regarded as\r\n“dead.” A borrower may leave his ticket in abeyance for several months\r\nwith the intention of using it later. It does mean that only those\r\ntickets should be counted which are valid at the time. As we have seen,\r\nvalidity ranges from one to three or more years in different libraries,\r\nand the figures as a rule will be only approximately sound. If, however,\r\nall valid tickets are included, and if the number of tickets issued\r\nwithin the year covered by the annual report is also indicated, the\r\nrecord will be a serviceable account of the use made in relation to the\r\npopulation of the district served. It is usual to show the number of\r\nactual borrowers divided into burgesses and non-burgesses; of\r\nnon-resident borrowers (employees, scholars, etc.); and of supplementary\r\ntickets (non-fiction, teachers’, illustration, music, etc.) held by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=58.= Where it is thought necessary to keep records of the occupations\r\nof readers, a blank line for the name of the occupation is included on\r\nthe application voucher (see Section 368) from which the records are\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=59.= It is not usual to keep formal statistics of the number of\r\nvisitors to newspaper and periodical rooms; the attendances are either\r\nnot recorded or are estimated. In some cases, however, a daily count is\r\nmade at monthly or other intervals and the yearly attendance is gauged\r\nfrom this. It is obvious that such figures have no great value. A series\r\nof visits to the rooms will assure any librarian or member of committee\r\nof the amount of use that is made of them equally well.\r\n\r\n\r\n=60.= Brief paragraphs, presenting the record of work weekly or monthly,\r\nand the number of borrowers, are sometimes sent to the local newspapers.\r\nThis is a good plan, and the matter is more acceptable if presented in\r\nliterary rather than in merely tabular form. At each meeting of the\r\nlibrary committee a fairly complete statistical record of the work since\r\nthe last meeting is presented, in which the factors we have discussed,\r\ntogether with the percentage of fiction issued, and comparisons with the\r\ncorresponding weeks or months of the previous year, are made. The\r\ncommittee is thus kept closely acquainted with the results of its work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=61. The Annual Report.=--The annual report of the library committee is\r\nthe summary and crown of its labours, and is often the most direct means\r\nof contact between the committee and the community. Such reports deserve\r\nmore attention than is commonly given to them by librarians, and in this\r\nmatter the American librarian--who is essentially a business man and\r\ndoes not often produce useless documents--may give hints to his British\r\nbrethren. A report should be a complete history of the operations of the\r\nlibrary in all its departments; and if improvement is necessary it is in\r\nthe direction of reducing the mere statistical and in increasing the\r\nliterary matter to be included. Elaborate tables of issue, stock, etc.,\r\nof central and branch libraries have a use for the librarian and may be\r\nkept at the libraries, but their publication is of interest to few other\r\npeople, and they are better given in summary. Plain and clear reports,\r\nin which comparisons with other libraries by name should be avoided, and\r\nwhich present the salient statistics without the use of confusingly\r\nelaborate tables, give the best results. Illustrations and an occasional\r\ndiagram rendering in graphic form the statistical results of work are\r\nnot necessarily superfluous, and may brighten the report considerably.\r\nThe report will not be a less authoritative document if it is\r\nattractive. The information which a library report ought to convey may\r\nbe indicated briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n  Title-page.\r\n\r\n  List of members of committee and library staff.\r\n\r\n  Narrative report.\r\n\r\n  [This is the most interesting feature from the public point of view.\r\n  It is usually a review of the year founded upon the statistics, etc.,\r\n  in the appendix, and is properly presented as if written by the\r\n  committee and signed by the chairman. Frequently, however, it takes\r\n  the form of a report written by the librarian to the committee, to be\r\n  adopted as the committee’s report. Each method has advantages. The\r\n  committee can appeal to the council upon any part of its policy with\r\n  greater authority than the librarian. On the other hand, the librarian\r\n  can express views of the work and needs of the library from his own\r\n  standpoint. The character of the document, however, would seem to\r\n  require that a report should be the committee’s. Sometimes, as usually\r\n  in America, the question is solved by having a brief report from the\r\n  committee, followed by a longer one from the librarian.]\r\n\r\n  Appendix of documents:--The following forms may be used conveniently\r\n  to present the statistical record:--\r\n\r\nSTOCK\r\n\r\n              Central.

Library Association Summary.=--The appendix outlined above may be\r\nreduced considerably by substituting for most of the items a summary in\r\nthe form recommended by the Library Association. The financial\r\nstatement, however, should always be given in full, even by libraries\r\nthe accounts of which are kept by the municipal treasurer or accountant.\r\nIt is clearly impossible to gauge the character of any library’s work if\r\nthe distribution of expenditure in performing it is not shown. The\r\nsummary recommended by the Library Association resembles a summary used\r\nin American library reports, and is the outcome of a suggestion made to\r\na meeting of the North Central Library Association in 1916 by Mr E. L.\r\nHetherington, then Secretary of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust. Its\r\npurpose is not only to present the statistics of libraries in a succinct\r\nand simple manner, but by its general adoption to secure a uniform\r\nrecord from all libraries by which satisfactory comparisons may be made.\r\nNo library report should appear without this summary, even if the\r\nlibrarian chooses to retain his more elaborate tables; and, in view of\r\nits utility and the proposed generalness of its use, we append it in\r\nfull with the Library Association’s explanatory notes.\r\n\r\nGENERAL STATISTICS:\r\n\r\n    (i) Population as at last Census.\r\n   (ii) Amount of rate in

Asterisks with relative foot-notes should be placed against any\r\n  figure which includes abnormalities; for example, if any item of the\r\n  expenditure includes certain special or non-recurring charges, the\r\n  amount of that expenditure should be detailed in a foot-note with an\r\n  explanation of the item.\r\n\r\n  _General Statistics._\r\n\r\n  2. Head (iii) should express in pence the cost of the total library\r\n  service--per inhabitant according to last census.\r\n\r\n  3. Similarly head (iv) should express the cost of the total library\r\n  expenditure per inhabitant.\r\n\r\n  4. Head (v) asks for the number of separate establishments. The\r\n  figure should include the central library, but if delivery stations\r\n  are also included the number of such subsidiary establishments should\r\n  be stated in a footnote.\r\n\r\n  _Income._\r\n\r\n  5. Head (i) should be confined solely to the income from the library\r\n  rate.\r\n\r\n  6. Head (ii) should include income from all other sources, whether\r\n  from interest on investments, rents, sales of catalogues, fines or\r\n  special subscriptions or donations.\r\n\r\n  _Expenditure._\r\n\r\n  7. Under head (iv) should be included only the cost of periodicals not\r\n  permanently retained. In cases of periodicals which are subsequently\r\n  bound and added to the permanent library stocks, their cost should be\r\n  included under head (i) books and head (ii) binding.\r\n\r\n  8. Care should be taken that head (vii) should be confined to the\r\n  salary payments made to the library staff proper. All wages paid to\r\n  caretakers, cleaners, messengers and the like, should be included\r\n  under head (xii).\r\n\r\n  9. It will be observed that there is no separate heading for\r\n  “miscellaneous” or “other items.” It is desired that all items of\r\n  expenditure should be allocated to the headings detailed above.\r\n\r\n  _Stocks._\r\n\r\n  10. It is recognized that the word book or volume has no definite\r\n  technical meaning, and is usually an indeterminate expression useful\r\n  for popular purposes.\r\n\r\n  It may therefore be useful to make the following definitions for the\r\n  guidance of the Libraries:--\r\n\r\n  _Volumes_ mean books as they stand on the shelves.\r\n\r\n  _Pieces_ mean separate works or parts (each usually having a separate\r\n  title-page to itself, as with pamphlets, parts of periodicals, and the\r\n  like).\r\n\r\n  _Papers_ mean lesser items, usually with less than 5 pages, as\r\n  broadsides, cards, fly-sheets.\r\n\r\n  _Items_ mean volumes, pieces and papers.\r\n\r\n  _Works_ mean whole literary productions whether in several volumes or\r\n  only one piece.\r\n\r\n  Thus: Ten pamphlets bound together, with five broadsides at end, are\r\n  one volume, ten works or pieces, fifteen items. A dictionary in twenty\r\n  volumes would count as twenty volumes, pieces and items, but one work,\r\n  and in a sense one book.\r\n\r\n  Having regard to these definitions care should be taken, in recording\r\n  the number of volumes in a library, to reckon ten pamphlets or parts\r\n  as the equivalent of a single volume.\r\n\r\n  _Issues._\r\n\r\n  11. Head (iii) should give the issues from the reference library\r\n  actually recorded.\r\n\r\n  12. Head (iv) should give the estimated use made of the books from the\r\n  open shelves of the reference library.\r\n\r\n  13. Sunday use of libraries should be separately recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=63. Statistics:=\r\n\r\n  Hetherington, A. L. Library Statistics. _In_ L.A. Record, v. 19, p. 3,\r\n  1917.

General.=--The success or failure of a library depends almost\r\nentirely upon the ability and energy of the staff. Opinion upon this\r\nquestion has been almost revolutionized in the past twenty years, and\r\nonly very occasionally now do we find some misguided library authority\r\nplacing so special an institution in the keeping of stickit ministers,\r\nunlucky schoolmasters, retired soldiers, minor journalists, unsuccessful\r\nbooksellers, and similar remnants of the failures or superannuated in\r\nother walks of life. No untrained person is likely to attain more than\r\nthe poorest or most commonplace results and will undoubtedly prevent the\r\nlibrary from serving the community to anything like its potential\r\ncapacity. Indeed, the work of the librarian is a professional occupation\r\ndemanding for its successful accomplishment a training as complete and\r\nspecial at least as that required of the teacher. A committee fails\r\nsignally in its public duty if it does not recognize this fact in the\r\nchoice of its librarian; and the public has a right to demand that the\r\nman appointed to occupy any technical public office shall have had both\r\ntraining and experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n=66.= The appointment of a chief librarian should be the first step\r\ntaken by a committee. Numberless blunders, often resulting in great\r\nsubsequent expense, have been made in the past through the mistaken\r\neconomy of proceeding with buildings, methods and book-selection before\r\nsuch appointment. These matters are essentially the work of the\r\nlibrarian and _not_ of the committee; and any little amount that may be\r\nsaved from the salary of the librarian is invariably lost because of the\r\nadoption of faulty apparatus or plans; amateur experiments are usually\r\nexpensive. If, at the beginning of its career, a library committee is\r\nunable to engage a qualified librarian, application should be made to\r\nthe Library Association for the nomination of a professional adviser,\r\nwho for a reasonable fee would give invaluable assistance at the time\r\nwhen such assistance is really vital.\r\n\r\n\r\n=67. Qualifications.=--As is the case with the prominent members of\r\nevery other profession, good librarians are born, not made. Training and\r\nexperience cannot create such natural endowments as enthusiasm,\r\noriginality, initiative--in short, positive genius for the work; but\r\ntraining and experience in sound methods will provide a passable\r\nsubstitute. Experience, however, depends for its value upon its\r\ncharacter, and long years in inefficiently-managed libraries will not\r\nsuffice for modern needs. Owing to the wide difference between the\r\nmethods of, say, thirty years ago, and the more scientific methods of\r\nto-day, it is necessary to judge the experience of any librarian by the\r\nschool in which he has been trained. This does not mean that a library\r\nwhich has been in existence thirty years or more is operated by obsolete\r\nmethods; most of the larger libraries, indeed, have kept pace with, and\r\nhave helped to originate, the modern methods which are to be preferred.\r\nAt the same time the practice of appointing librarians from larger\r\nlibraries in preference to those from smaller ones is often mistaken. A\r\nsmall library may afford its staff opportunities for a more\r\ncomprehensive training than a large one, but it may not be so extensive\r\nin detail. In short, the _size_ of the library in which a man is trained\r\nis no index to the character of its service, and this character is the\r\nmain factor in considering experience.\r\n\r\nThe physical qualifications of a librarian should include good health,\r\nfreedom from deformity, defect or incurable disease, and his or her age\r\nshould not usually be less than twenty-five. Age is not so important in\r\ncases of promotion, as the committee has first-hand and accurate\r\nknowledge of capabilities to guide it. As regards the physical condition\r\nof librarians, it may be said generally that the same principles which\r\nguide selection in business appointments should be the rule in library\r\nappointments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=68.= The professional attainments of a librarian should be judged\r\nmainly by their suitability for the duties to be performed. The degree\r\nof attainment differs in individuals, and it would be unfair to expect\r\nso many useful qualifications in a librarian who is to receive £200 per\r\nannum as in one who is to receive a much larger salary. But there are\r\ncertain broad principles to be considered, the cardinal one being that\r\n_only trained librarians should ever be appointed to chief positions_. A\r\ncommittee is safe in selecting candidates from amongst diplomates,\r\nfellows and members of the Library Association, as these _ipso facto_\r\nhave received the training indicated. We give in Sections 99-101 some\r\naccount of the compass and activities of the Library Association, and\r\ncommend what is there written to the consideration of library\r\ncommittees. Here it may be said that a diplomate is a librarian who has\r\nreceived at least three years’ training in a library recognized by the\r\nAssociation, has gained the six provisional certificates of that body in\r\nliterary history, bibliography, classification, cataloguing, library\r\norganization and library routine, and has in addition shown a knowledge\r\nof Latin and one modern foreign language, and has presented an\r\nacceptable written thesis showing independent research upon some\r\ndepartment of librarianship. The diploma is a very considerable\r\nattainment, and is at present held by few librarians, but the number\r\nincreases, and no doubt its possession will influence future\r\nappointments considerably. It was initiated in 1901, and therefore too\r\nrecently to have made it possible for all eligible candidates for\r\nappointments to have acquired it. To meet this situation, and to set up\r\na standard of qualification, the Library Association adopted in 1911 a\r\nscheme for the classification of librarians into fellows, members, and\r\nstudent-members. A fellow is a librarian of approved experience who held\r\noffice prior to the end of 1914, a librarian who holds the diploma, or a\r\nuniversity degree plus approved library experience, or an assistant\r\nlibrarian of proved reputation and capacity who held office prior to the\r\ndate named. All other librarians at the initiation of this scheme were\r\nclassified as members (except very young men and women who became\r\nstudent-members and whose degree of training may be judged from that\r\nname). After 1914 admission to fellowship has generally been restricted\r\nto diplomates, or graduates with library experience, save in exceptional\r\ncases where great and proved capacity has been shown; and admission to\r\nmembership has been restricted to chief librarians, or to assistants who\r\nhold four of the six diploma certificates. Other factors may apply in\r\nindividual cases, but there are very few librarians or assistants of\r\ncharacter and ability who are either members or certificate-holders of\r\nthe Association.\r\n\r\nWith due allowance for the size and means of the library, and the salary\r\nto be offered to the librarian, the following list of qualifications may\r\nserve as a guide to a committee as to what they may expect.\r\n\r\nLIBRARIAN’S QUALIFICATIONS\r\n\r\n  1. Training for at least three years in a library which is classified\r\n  according to some recognized bibliographical scheme [Decimal,\r\n  Expansive, Library of Congress, Subject or other].\r\n\r\n  2. A wide knowledge of English and Foreign Bibliography and\r\n  Literature, and an intimate and exact knowledge of the contents of\r\n  modern, and especially technical, scientific, and historical, books.\r\n\r\n  3. Sufficient acquaintance with languages to enable the translating of\r\n  title-pages with the aid of dictionaries.\r\n\r\n  4. A knowledge of business routine, including elementary book-keeping\r\n  and accounts.\r\n\r\n  5. Practical acquaintance with the leading systems of book\r\n  classification.\r\n\r\n  6. Full knowledge of the various methods of cataloguing, with a\r\n  thorough grasp of the modern literature of the subject.\r\n\r\n  7. Experience in staff management.\r\n\r\n  8. Practical knowledge of all modern systems of library working,\r\n  including book-binding, book-buying, charging and maintenance.\r\n\r\n  9. Knowledge of modern periodical literature, and the management of\r\n  news-rooms.\r\n\r\n  10. General culture, the ability to make a useful public speech, tact,\r\n  courtesy, and, in fact, good “personality.”\r\n\r\n=69. Advertisements and Application Forms for\r\nAppointments.=--Advertisements for librarians are usually inserted in\r\none or all of the following:--_The Times_, _The Athenæum_, _The\r\nSpectator_ and _The Municipal Journal_. A useful form of announcement\r\nmay be subjoined:\r\n\r\n  LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF LIBRARIAN\r\n\r\n  A Chief Librarian is required for the Liberton Public Library.\r\n  Candidates must be Diplomates, or Fellows, or Members of the Library\r\n  Association (or be certificated by that body), and have had at least\r\n  three years’ training in a library employing scientific\r\n  classification. Salary to commence, £. . . . ., rising by annual\r\n  increments of £. . . . . to a maximum of £. . . . . . The application,\r\n  which should be accompanied by three recent testimonials, is to be\r\n  made on a special form which may be obtained from the undersigned. All\r\n  applications should reach the undersigned not later than [_allow three\r\n  weeks_]. Second class railway fares and reasonable expenses of\r\n  selected candidates will be allowed. All canvassing will disqualify.\r\n\r\n  A. B. C.,\r\n\r\n  _Town Clerk, or Clerk to the Committee_.\r\n\r\nThe practice of requiring candidates to apply on a special form is\r\nfairly general, and has the advantage of securing uniformity in the\r\ninformation supplied, and in emphasizing the particulars considered to\r\nbe the most important. For very important positions the method may be\r\nnot so advantageous, as valuable conclusions may be drawn from the\r\n_manner_ in which candidates present their applications. The following\r\ndraft form may be suggestive to committees:--\r\n\r\n  LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMITTEE\r\n\r\n  [Address.]\r\n\r\n  APPLICATION FOR LIBRARIANSHIP\r\n\r\n  _The candidate is particularly requested to answer every question in\r\n  full, and return to A. B. C. [address], by 12 o’clock on [date to be\r\n  named], marked on outside of envelope, “Librarianship.”_\r\n\r\n  1. Full name.\r\n\r\n  2. Address.\r\n\r\n  3. Age next birthday.\r\n\r\n  4. Married or single.\r\n\r\n  5. Number of family if married.\r\n\r\n  6. Is your health good?\r\n\r\n  7. Have you any physical defect (deafness, lameness, etc.)?\r\n\r\n  8. Present occupation.\r\n\r\n  9. Length of service in present occupation.\r\n\r\n  10. Former occupations, if any.\r\n\r\n  11. Are you a Fellow or Member of the Library Association?\r\n\r\n  12. Do you hold the Diploma or any of the Provisional Certificates of\r\n  the Library Association?\r\n\r\n  13. Do you possess any of the following qualifications?--\r\n\r\n  Practical knowledge of modern literature.\r\n\r\n  Practical knowledge of scientific classification.\r\n\r\n  Practical knowledge of library planning.\r\n\r\n  Knowledge of accounts and book-keeping.\r\n\r\n  Experience in management of staff.\r\n\r\n  Practical knowledge of modern library management.\r\n\r\n  14. State system used in your library for the following departments,\r\n  and which you would adopt if appointed here:--\r\n\r\n  Classification.\r\n\r\n  Printed catalogue.\r\n\r\n  Manuscript catalogue.\r\n\r\n  Book issue method.\r\n\r\n  Reference library method.\r\n\r\n  15. Have you originated any library device, or published books or\r\n  articles on practical phases of library work?\r\n\r\n  16. Do you possess any degrees or certificates of an educational kind?\r\n\r\n  17. Have you made a special study of any particular subject?\r\n\r\n  18. When could you enter upon duty if appointed?\r\n\r\n  19. Add here any further relevant particulars [_leave large space_].\r\n\r\nSelected candidates, when interviewed, should be examined on the\r\nquestions scheduled above and on the qualifications specified in Section\r\n68. A few questions by the chairman, based upon these, in addition to\r\nthe independent suggestions of members of committee, will generally\r\nresult in obtaining a very fair estimate of the qualifications of each\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=70. Salaries.=--Owing to the limitation of the library rate and a\r\ngeneral underestimate of the librarian’s utility, salaries in municipal\r\nlibraries are not very liberal, and may be described as inadequate. In\r\nthe state, university and some of the endowed and proprietary libraries\r\nthe salaries range much higher, taken all round. These appointments,\r\nhowever, especially such as the British Museum, India Office, the Houses\r\nof Parliament, the universities and similar institutions, are seldom\r\noffered for competition. In public municipal libraries the salaries of\r\nchief librarians range downward from about £800. Some of the large\r\nLondon proprietary libraries, and many of the provincial libraries of a\r\nsimilar kind, give salaries to about the same maximum.\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the income, population and work of the principal\r\nEnglish and American libraries has enabled the following table to be\r\nproduced, showing the amount which a library can reasonably pay for a\r\ngood officer. This scale is considerably below the American one, but\r\nslightly higher than the English.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5.--TABLE OF LIBRARIANS’ SALARIES WHICH SHOULD BE PAID BY LIBRARIES\r\nPOSSESSING THE INCOMES UNDERNOTED\r\n\r\n  +-----------+----------------+\r\n  |  Library  |                |\r\n  |  Annual   |  Librarian’s   |\r\n  |Income from|    Salary.     |\r\n  |   Rate.   |                |\r\n  +-----------+----------------+\r\n  |     £     | £              |\r\n  |  20,000   |1000            |\r\n  |  15,000   | 800            |\r\n  |  10,000   | 750            |\r\n  |   8,000   | 700            |\r\n  |   6,000   | 600            |\r\n  |   5,500   | 550            |\r\n  |   5,000   | 500            |\r\n  |   4,500   | 450            |\r\n  |   4,000   | 425            |\r\n  |   3,500   | 400            |\r\n  |   3,000   | 350            |\r\n  |   2,500   | 325            |\r\n  |   2,000   | 300            |\r\n  |   1,900   | 290            |\r\n  |   1,800   | 280            |\r\n  |   1,700   | 270            |\r\n  |   1,600   | 260            |\r\n  |   1,500   | 250            |\r\n  |   1,400   | 240            |\r\n  |   1,300   | 230            |\r\n  |   1,200   | 220            |\r\n  |   1,100   | 210            |\r\n  |   1,000   | 200            |\r\n  |     900   | 190            |\r\n  |     800   | 180            |\r\n  |     700   | 170            |\r\n  |     600   | 160            |\r\n  |     500   | 150            |\r\n  |     400   | 120            |\r\n  |     300   |  90            |\r\n  |     200   |  60}For part of|\r\n  |     100   |  30}time only. |\r\n  +-----------+----------------+\r\n\r\n  [The above table is rather higher than that given in the last edition,\r\n  as regards the libraries with incomes exceeding £3000, and is based\r\n  upon my own inquiries and conclusions as they have been affected by\r\n  the European War. Few librarians receive normally £1000, and it is\r\n  quite clear that the present salaries for the greater libraries are\r\n  most inadequate, having regard to the responsibilities\r\n  involved.--EDITOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=71.= The only other point of importance arising out of the question of\r\nlibrarians’ salaries is that of providing a residence on the library\r\npremises. This policy has been adopted in London more than anywhere\r\nelse. It affects the question of salary to some extent, though not quite\r\nso much as has been claimed. A committee of a £4000 library might argue\r\nthat, by providing a good house in a valuable position, they are only\r\nentitled to give a salary of £325, the balance of £100 being represented\r\nby the house. The practical reply to this is, that a house under these\r\nconditions, although it could rent at £100 or even more, is just worth\r\nto the librarian exactly what he would be prepared to pay for house rent\r\nif he lived away from the library. Any allowance or deduction should\r\naccordingly be based upon this consideration. In small libraries it is\r\nnot advisable to incur additional cost in the erection of buildings by\r\nproviding a residence for the librarian in order to save on his salary.\r\nBeyond the advantage of having a librarian living on the premises as a\r\nkind of superior perpetual caretaker, there is little to be gained by\r\ncomplicating a library building with such an excrescence as a residence.\r\nIf houses are provided at all, they should be mainly used by caretakers\r\nwho have to get up early, and there is a decided convenience in having\r\nan officer of this description always at hand. If possible, residences\r\nshould be erected as far away from public reading-rooms as they can be,\r\nthe occupation of rooms over news-rooms, etc., having been proved to be\r\nunhealthy in many cases. The accommodation provided for a caretaker\r\nusually consists of a sitting-room or large kitchen, parlour, two\r\nbedrooms, and the usual offices. In some London libraries very liberal\r\nprovision has been made for librarians living on the premises, the\r\naccommodation consisting of three large living rooms, four or five\r\nbedrooms, kitchen, scullery, bathroom and other offices. The whole\r\nquestion of residence or non-residence is one for library authorities to\r\ndecide for themselves, but the matter is another proof of the necessity\r\nwhich exists for appointing librarians before buildings are erected.\r\n\r\n\r\n=72. Superannuation.=--There is no general law at present under which\r\npublic librarians can retire on a pension after a certain age has been\r\nreached. Some towns have made separate arrangements for the\r\nsuperannuation of all their officers, but even this is far from common.\r\nThe National Association of Local Government Officers, which deserves\r\nthe support of librarians and committees, has a Bill before Parliament,\r\nthe object of which is to procure for municipal officers the same\r\nregulations as to superannuation as are in force for poor-law officers,\r\nbut this has not yet passed into law.\r\n\r\n\r\n=73. Conditions of Librarian’s Appointment.=--There are several points\r\nrequiring notice in connexion with the conditions upon which librarians\r\nare appointed. It is not usual to draw up a formal agreement, but if\r\nthis is done it should be executed by a solicitor, and specify the\r\nprincipal obligations, terms and duration of the appointment.\r\n\r\n  1. In large libraries it is usual to stipulate that the librarian must\r\n  devote the whole of his or her TIME to the duties of the office. This\r\n  simply means that no other office can be held concurrently, but\r\n  particularly a paid office. A librarian’s private time can be devoted\r\n  to any hobby he chooses, be it gardening, cycling, photography,\r\n  literature, music or sport. Provided, always, such recreations do not\r\n  render a librarian less fit for his public duty. Official time\r\n  occupied in any work which has for its object improvement in\r\n  professional knowledge should be allowed within reasonable limits.\r\n  Attendances at meetings called for professional purposes, or visits to\r\n  other places for the purpose of acquiring professional knowledge,\r\n  would, we take it, be considered quite legitimate. Where a certain\r\n  number of hours daily or weekly has been fixed, the question of the\r\n  disposal of a librarian’s leisure time will not arise.\r\n\r\n  2. Notice of intention to DETERMINE AN APPOINTMENT might be stipulated\r\n  for in an agreement. The usual practice is one month’s notice on\r\n  either side.\r\n\r\n  3. A public librarian who handles public money should be required to\r\n  obtain security from a recognized guarantee office. The amount insured\r\n  against will generally be fully covered by a sum equal to 10 per cent.\r\n  of the annual income of the library. Thus, a library with an income of\r\n  £2000 should make £200 the insurable sum, as this will cover any\r\n  possible defalcations of the librarians, who, under any circumstances,\r\n  in such a library, can never handle more than about £60 or £70 in the\r\n  course of one month. The premium for municipal officers averages about\r\n  5s. per cent., and, of course, the library authority should make the\r\n  annual payments to keep the policy alive.\r\n\r\n  4. The VACATION allowed to librarians varies with the conditions of\r\n  each place. In some cases five weeks are allowed, irrespective of the\r\n  time occupied by conferences or other annual meetings. Usually four\r\n  weeks are given. As a rule, committees will not be found niggardly in\r\n  this matter when they have an officer whom they can respect and trust.\r\n  In American libraries a month is often allowed, and in some cases much\r\n  longer periods.\r\n\r\n  5. The only ANNUAL CONFERENCES of any importance in connexion with\r\n  public library work are those of the Library Association and the\r\n  Museums Association. Practice differs as regards libraries sending\r\n  delegates to the annual conferences of the Library Association. In\r\n  some cases where a library is a subscribing member, and, in addition,\r\n  the librarian is also a member in his own name, it sends a member of\r\n  the committee and the librarian, and pays their expenses. In other\r\n  cases the librarian alone is sent, and his expenses paid. In still\r\n  other cases the librarian is allowed the time to attend, but has to\r\n  pay his own expenses; while, sometimes, the chairman of committee\r\n  attends, and either pays his own expenses or has them paid by the\r\n  committee.\r\n\r\n  Every library which desires to keep abreast with modern ideas in\r\n  library work should send its librarian to the annual conferences of\r\n  the Library Association, and pay his expenses. All public libraries\r\n  should join this association as institution members, and their\r\n  librarian will naturally be a member in his own right. There is more\r\n  knowledge and good obtained by a librarian coming into personal touch\r\n  with other librarians during a conference week than can ever be\r\n  achieved in a state of hermit-like seclusion. The sum spent on a\r\n  library conference to insure a librarian’s attendance is by far the\r\n  most profitable investment a library committee can make in a single\r\n  year.\r\n\r\n  Some doubt exists as to whether members of committee can be sent at\r\n  the expense of the library rate, and, so far as parishes are\r\n  concerned, it has been decided by the district auditors that they can\r\n  not be sent unless at their own personal expense. Municipal boroughs\r\n  have power to send committee delegates if so disposed, but the matter\r\n  remains doubtful as regards Urban District Councils.\r\n\r\n\r\n=74. Duties of the Librarian.=--The duties of a librarian practically\r\ncover every section of this _Manual_, and it is therefore needless to go\r\nover the same ground here. It may be assumed, however, that the\r\nlibrarian also acts as clerk to his committee, and a few of the more\r\npersonal duties of the librarian may be specified. It has been\r\nrecommended that a librarian should act as clerk, and some reasons may\r\nbe given why this course should always be taken. The librarian is the\r\nonly official who holds all the threads of work and routine in his hands\r\nor who thoroughly understands the practical working of the institution.\r\nBy combining the functions he remains in touch with his committee, and\r\ncan much better understand their views than if a second person acts as\r\nintermediary or interpreter. The plan is also more economical, as town\r\nclerks sometimes take a salary for acting as clerk to the library\r\ncommittee, or charge a proportion of office expenses to the library.\r\nBoth courses are quite unnecessary. It is not desirable, when a library\r\ncommittee has obtained a complete or partial delegation of powers, to\r\nhave its work controlled or interfered with by another municipal\r\ndepartment. Even when a library committee remains but an ordinary\r\ncommittee of a local authority, it is not desirable for the town clerk\r\nto do more than depute a junior clerk to attend meetings for the sole\r\npurpose of recording minutes. The chairman and librarian should call all\r\nmeetings and arrange all necessary business. It is too often overlooked\r\nthat library committees are appointed to carry out special work under a\r\nspecial Act of Parliament, and that, in consequence, they are performing\r\nduties outside the ordinary routine of municipal work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=75.= The following summary of the more important duties of the\r\nlibrarian is applicable to the average library, but must be adjusted\r\nconsiderably in large libraries, where the chief librarian is mainly an\r\nadministrator. Such large libraries have special departmental experts,\r\nand it is clear that over many of these items the chief librarian can\r\nexercise only a general supervision. Where there are large trained\r\nstaffs he should avoid details and concern himself with the general\r\ndirection of all departments; otherwise he will become immersed\r\nimpossibly in minutiæ to the great detriment of the library service as a\r\nwhole:\r\n\r\n  1. He must superintend and prepare all the business for the library\r\n  committee, including summoning meetings, preparing agendas, checking\r\n  accounts, compiling lists of books, preparing reports and taking\r\n  minutes of proceedings.\r\n\r\n  2. He must attend all committee meetings, and such of the local\r\n  authority meetings as may be fixed.\r\n\r\n  3. He must prepare all specifications for contracts, and bring forward\r\n  in plenty of time all business which arises regularly, either monthly,\r\n  quarterly or annually.\r\n\r\n  4. He should sign all orders and be responsible for all correspondence\r\n  connected with the library. He should keep copies of all orders and\r\n  important letters, as well as copies of any specifications or other\r\n  documents.\r\n\r\n  5. He must fix the time, duties and daily work of the staff, and\r\n  superintend and check their attendance and work in every department.\r\n\r\n  6. He must see that order is maintained among readers throughout the\r\n  main building and branches, and that the rules are enforced within\r\n  reason, and that the opening and closing of the library are done\r\n  punctually.\r\n\r\n  7. He must carefully supervise the selection of books and periodicals\r\n  for addition to the library, and examine all necessary lists,\r\n  catalogues and reviews for that purpose.\r\n\r\n  8. He should check all cataloguing and classification work.\r\n\r\n  9. He should be prepared when called upon to aid readers, as far as\r\n  possible, in any line of research, and should be easily accessible at\r\n  all times when on duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n=76.

There are about forty such library\r\n  schools.\r\n\r\n  For articles, see Cannons, E 26-28, Assistants, Qualifications,\r\n  Training, etc.; A 135-175, Library Schools in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nASSISTANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n=78. General.=--The organization of the library staff under the chief\r\nlibrarian is naturally governed by the number of assistants and the size\r\nof the system they work. Most libraries have a second qualified\r\nlibrarian who is variously called Deputy-Librarian or Sub-Librarian [or\r\nsometimes he is called Chief Assistant Librarian, Deputy Chief\r\nLibrarian, or, more rarely in England, Vice-Librarian. There is still\r\nconsiderable confusion in the nomenclature of library offices, and it\r\nwould be well if a uniform system were adopted. (See Appendix I.)].\r\nLarge libraries have, in addition, a hierarchy of assistants, as\r\nfollows: 1. A Superintendent of Branches, where there are several\r\nlibraries in the system, as at Birmingham, Glasgow, etc.; 2.\r\nLibrarians-in-Charge of the several departments; 3. Branch Librarians;\r\n4. Senior assistants; 5. Junior assistants. The qualifications of\r\nDeputy, Superintendent of Branches, Librarians-in-Charge and Branch\r\nLibrarians differ from those of the Chief Librarian in degree rather\r\nthan in kind, and to these positions only trained men should be\r\nappointed. In many cases they are appointed from staff, not always to\r\nthe benefit of the library. It is a sound plan to throw open all the\r\nhigher appointments in libraries to competition, in which competition,\r\nof course, any member of the existing staff should be allowed, without\r\nprejudice, to compete. One of the mistaken policies, especially of large\r\nlibraries, has been to promote men because of mere length of service.\r\nSuch service is undoubtedly valuable, but is not necessarily a proof of\r\nqualification for higher library positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=79. Deputy-Librarian.=--It may be affirmed that appointments to any\r\nsenior position should be subject to the same principles, and to\r\nconditions similar to those governing the appointment of chief\r\nlibrarians. In small libraries the means at the disposal of the\r\ncommittee do not always permit of a salary sufficient to attract a\r\ndiplomate of the Library Association, or a man similarly qualified, but\r\nno assistant who is inexperienced or is without the certificates of the\r\nLibrary Association should ever be appointed to the important position\r\nof Deputy-Librarian. The duties of the Deputy-Librarian comprise the\r\nwhole administration of the library system under the chief librarian,\r\nthe general supervision of every department, and the direction of the\r\nduties of the whole staff. He becomes acting-chief librarian in every\r\nabsence of his principal, and should be qualified to assume this\r\nposition both by his knowledge and his personality. It is therefore\r\nclear that his technical training must in general be as sound and\r\ncatholic as that of his chief; and in addition to this quality, he\r\nshould possess initiative, disciplinary powers, discretion, and loyalty\r\nto his chief and to the existing system. In detail his duties will vary\r\naccording to the size of the system; and in small libraries he will be\r\nmerely the superior assistant, taking part in every operation (except\r\nthe merely mechanical ones, which may be performed by untrained juniors)\r\nof the library; in somewhat larger libraries he may arrange the hours\r\nand duties of the staff and superintend them, and check all cataloguing\r\nand classification. In the largest libraries his work is almost purely\r\nadministrative.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the appointment of a Deputy-Librarian are somewhat\r\ndifficult to describe, owing to the divergences we have named. He\r\nusually, but not always, works similar hours to the remainder of the\r\nstaff; has his own office, or, at any rate, private desk; and is usually\r\ninvested with considerable authority. It should be the aim of the chief\r\nlibrarian to make this office a worthy one--and to see that only worthy\r\npersons occupy it. A good deputy gives tone to the whole staff, as he\r\ncomes into more intimate contact with it than the chief librarian. The\r\nsalaries paid to Deputy-Librarians are again matters which vary; they\r\nrange from £100 to £300, and in a few places to much higher sums than\r\nthis. [In the last edition it was laid down that the deputy should\r\nreceive a maximum of not less than half of that of the chief; but we\r\nthink any dogmatic statement of that kind objectionable, as being\r\nsubject to numberless variations in various places.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=80. Superintendent of Branches.=--This librarian acts as a _liaison_\r\nofficer between the chief librarian and the branch librarian in systems\r\nwhere there are many branch libraries. He must be qualified to assess\r\nthe work of each library and to co-ordinate the whole branch system, to\r\nlook over time-sheets, examine into the performance of the assistants,\r\njudge their capacity and training, advise as to the books required in\r\nparticular localities, and, in general, make the units of the system\r\nsmooth-working parts of a homogenous whole. It is probable that a\r\ncapable superintendent is an economy of some consequence in a large\r\nsystem. Few libraries, however, with less than a dozen branches possess\r\nsuch an officer, his duties usually in other cases falling upon the\r\nchief or deputy librarians. The superintendent is subordinate to the\r\ndeputy-librarian, and his salary is something more than that of a branch\r\nor departmental librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n=81. Departmental Librarians.=--Of recent years the tendency in library\r\nwork has been towards specialization, and in most libraries of any size\r\nassistants are given more or less permanent charge of departments, and\r\nare usually called librarians-in-charge. The librarian of a branch\r\nlibrary falls into this category although he may not occupy exactly the\r\nsame level on the staff as the librarian-in-charge of the reference\r\nlibrary; as, also, in libraries which have such departments, does the\r\nhead of the cataloguing staff, the order division, etc. In the great\r\nlibraries the librarian-in-charge of the reference department is easily\r\nthe head of the grade we are discussing, as he must obviously be a\r\nperson of considerable bibliographical acquirements in addition to being\r\nthe possessor of a complete library training, and his work lies with\r\ninquirers, research workers, and similar readers who require skilled and\r\nsympathetic assistance. In the majority of libraries all\r\nlibrarians-in-charge are regarded as official equals. Their salaries are\r\nobviously governed by the wealth and work of the library concerned, but\r\na rough calculation ranges them at from the inadequate minimum of £90 to\r\nabout £250 or more, with many intermediate scales. The duties of a\r\nlibrarian-in-charge involve the responsibility of conducting the\r\ndepartment according to the prevailing library policy, the arranging of\r\nthe duties of the staff and the seeing that they are performed, the\r\ntraining of the staff, the maintenance of order in public rooms, and\r\nthe exploiting of the department to the utmost in the interest of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=82. Library Councils.=--In some libraries the chief librarians have\r\nformed the deputy-librarian, the superintendent of branches and the\r\nlibrarians-in-charge into a committee which is variously named, but is\r\ncommonly called by the large name of the Library Council, which meets\r\nweekly or monthly in the chief librarian’s office and discusses the\r\ncurrent methods of the library system and the means whereby its\r\nactivities may be improved and its influence extended. Such a council\r\nhas necessarily only a consultative function, and all decisions it\r\nreaches are subject to the chief librarian. Regular agenda are often\r\nused and minutes kept of such meetings, and they are surprisingly\r\nfruitful in useful and practical suggestions. Even quite impractical\r\nsuggestions should be encouraged at such meetings, as they often throw\r\nlight on the general work and lead to other suggestions of a useful\r\ncharacter. More and more both in this country and in America the chief\r\nlibrarians are taking their senior colleagues into their confidence in\r\nthis way, and thus a community of interest is created and an enthusiasm\r\nis fostered which are well worth having.\r\n\r\n\r\n=83. Assistants.=--In America the library assistant is in the best\r\ninstances a person who is a graduate of a college or who has had a high\r\nschool education; who, in addition, has taken a course of one year, or,\r\nin special instances, two years at a library school. Not all or even the\r\nmajority of assistants are of this type, as the American library is\r\nunable to afford a large number of workers so highly qualified. On this\r\nside of the Atlantic the American system is an impossible ideal in\r\nexisting circumstances; not one library in the kingdom--except,\r\noccasionally, the Government libraries--could pay the initial salaries\r\nwhich such training should command. Indeed, the whole question of\r\nstaffing libraries is affected in most adverse manner by the inadequacy\r\nof library incomes. Assistants must as a rule be chosen from amongst\r\nyoung people just leaving school--often Council elementary or secondary\r\nschools. They are therefore people in almost every sense, except, it may\r\nbe, natural ability, incapable at the beginning of their library career\r\nof anything more than the mere mechanical tasks. They have to be\r\neducated before they are trained technically in most cases. To secure\r\nthe right material it is becoming the practice to demand of candidates\r\nfor library work a fair general knowledge, and the Library Association\r\nhas asked that some such certificate as matriculation, or the Oxford and\r\nCambridge Locals, should be required of them. Where the supply of\r\ncandidates so qualified does not exist, the chief librarian sets a\r\nsimple qualifying examination paper to test the common sense and\r\neducation of candidates. Appointments are usually made for a\r\nprobationary period of about three months, at the end of which time it\r\nis possible to judge in a rough way whether the youngster will benefit\r\nby library training or not. Owing to the limited prospects the work\r\noffers the librarian has a moral obligation to see that appointees who\r\nare unsuitable are encouraged to seek other occupations as soon as their\r\nunfitness for librarianship is proven. Where both sexes are employed\r\nexactly the same type of qualifications should be required from each,\r\nand equal remuneration should be paid. The smaller salaries sometimes\r\noffered to girls have ill results both upon the individual candidates\r\nand upon the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n=84. Hours.=--The last exhaustive inquiry into the hours worked by\r\nmunicipal library assistants was made by the Library Assistants’\r\nAssociation in 1911, who embodied its results in a valuable report.\r\nHours are naturally influenced by the prevailing length of working-time\r\nin commerce and in other walks of life. The average number worked in\r\nlibraries in 1908 was 48 weekly; in 1911 it was 45·22; but the tendency\r\nis to make it 42 hours. The difficulties which face a librarian in\r\narranging a time-sheet are that he has usually too small a staff, and\r\ncannot afford a larger one, and that the library is in many or all of\r\nits departments open from twelve to fourteen hours daily. This involves\r\nevening work on several days in the week, and means that the hours are\r\nirregular and broken. At the same time the nature of library work is\r\nexacting, and much more efficient work can be expected from a\r\nseven-hours’, or even shorter, day than from a longer one. Study,\r\nrecreation and social experience are absolutely necessary for successful\r\nwork; and time-sheets should be arranged to make these possible. There\r\nis no excuse whatever for the at one time prevailing time-sheets which\r\nrequired assistants to work from about 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. with an\r\ninterval of 1½ hours for dinner and a similar interval for tea. The\r\nlibrarian whose staff is so small that these hours are necessary to keep\r\nthe library open is attempting at the expense of the health and whole\r\nnatural life of his staff to do more work than the community has a right\r\nto expect. Even with the seven-hour day the broken hours involved form\r\nthe least attractive feature of library work. The time-sheet suggested\r\nby the Library Assistants’ Association is given as a practical solution\r\nof some of the difficulties we have enumerated--not as an ideal but as\r\nthe result of experience. It provides for a half-holiday weekly and for\r\nhours of recreation and study. It should be the aim to make the use of\r\nthe sheet regular, so that every assistant may know what evenings, for\r\nexample, he has at his disposal throughout the year. Modifications are\r\nsometimes made during the summer months, when the work is slacker, in\r\nthe direction of giving the assistants more free time.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED TIME-SHEET (LIBRARY ASSISTANTS’ ASSOCIATION)\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                    MONDAY\r\n  A   ------------            ------------\r\n  B               ------------   ---------\r\n  C 8.45----------\r\n  D   ------------               ------------\r\n  E   ------------            -------------\r\n  F               ------------   ----------\r\n  G   ------------   ------------\r\n  H               ------------   ----------\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                    TUESDAY\r\n  A               ------------   ---------\r\n  B   ------------   ------------\r\n  C   ------------               ------------\r\n  D 8.45----------\r\n  E               ------------   ---------\r\n  F   ------------            ------------\r\n  G               ------------   ---------\r\n  H   ------------   ------------\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                   WEDNESDAY\r\n  A   ------------\r\n  B               ------------   ---------\r\n  C   ------------   ------------\r\n  D   ------------            ------------\r\n  E 8.45----------\r\n  F               ---------      ---------\r\n  G               ---------   ------------\r\n  H   ------------               ------------\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                    THURSDAY\r\n  A               ------------   ------------\r\n  B   ------------\r\n  C   ------------            ------------\r\n  D   ------------   ------------\r\n  E               ---------   ------------\r\n  F 8.45----------\r\n  G   ------------               ------------\r\n  H               ------------   ------------\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                     FRIDAY\r\n  A   ------------   ------------\r\n  B               ------------   ------------\r\n  C               ------------   ---------\r\n  D               ------------   ---------\r\n  E   ------------   ------------\r\n  F                              ------------\r\n  G 8.45----------\r\n  H   ------------            ------------\r\n\r\n     9 10 11 12  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n                    SATURDAY\r\n  A               ------------   ---------\r\n  B   ------------            ------------\r\n  C               ------------   ---------\r\n  D               ------------   ---------\r\n  E   ------------               ------------\r\n  F   ------------   ------------\r\n  G   ------------            ------------\r\n  H 8.45----------\r\n\r\nFIG. 6 (Section 84).\r\n\r\n  Hours of duty 42 per week. Each assistant has a half-day and an\r\n  evening off, works one night until 10 o’clock, and comes on one\r\n  morning at 8.45. The library is assumed to be open all the week, and\r\n  where an early-closing day is in vogue, the time-sheet is simplified\r\n  by confining nearly all the half-holidays to that day.\r\n\r\n  The time-sheet would be much improved if 5 p.m. were substituted for 6\r\n  p.m. on the evening off; an assistant leaving at 6, after he has had a\r\n  meal, has very little evening left. It should be the endeavour so to\r\n  adjust the sheet that each assistant is off every other evening, the\r\n  half-day counting as one. Local circumstances will suggest variations,\r\n  which can easily be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n=85.= The whole staff question, so far as junior assistants are\r\nconcerned, may be modified by the Education Act of 1918. This has raised\r\nthe age at which children may leave school, and requires of them\r\npart-study until the age of 18. Seeing that the juniors at present\r\nengaged are of 14 years and upwards, this may mean duplicate junior\r\nstaffs, with accompanying problems of remuneration. It may be that\r\nspecialized library training may be accepted in lieu of the continuation\r\nclasses contemplated by the Act. But the matter is at present in a state\r\nof transition, and we can only indicate the new problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=86. Sunday Work.=--Some libraries remain open on Sundays and on public\r\nholidays, usually for a part of the day. About half of these pay extra\r\nremuneration for hours worked on these days; others allow time off\r\nthrough the week for it; and in one or two places Hebrew assistants are\r\nspecially employed for Sunday duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n=87. Junior Assistant.=--The work of the assistant in his first library\r\nyears is largely mechanical: the preparing of books for circulating;\r\nlabelling, card-writing, tagging; keeping shelves in order and replacing\r\nreturned books; charging and issue-desk work of the simpler kind. There\r\nis much work in every library of this unskilled character which forms a\r\nuseful training in business habits, order, regularity, etc. It is\r\nunfortunate, however, that the smallness of staffs often makes it\r\nnecessary to put the work of issuing books to readers in the hands of\r\njuniors. The actual charging of books is indeed a mechanical process,\r\nbut its performance is carried out at one of the main points of contact\r\nwith the public where knowledge and experience are of great value.\r\nLarger libraries have, as a rule, departmental staffs which are confined\r\nto the work of the particular department to which they are accredited.\r\nThis is undoubtedly the most business-like and economical method; but\r\nevery assistant should be given the opportunity of learning the work of\r\nevery department and should be required to do so. This may be done by\r\ntransferring the assistants at not too lengthy intervals. In smaller\r\nlibraries this departmental division does not exist, and an assistant\r\nmay work in the lending library in the morning, in the reference library\r\nin the evening, and at a branch to-morrow, just as the exigencies of the\r\nservice dictate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=88. Senior Assistant.=--The name senior assistant is bestowed\r\nupon assistants with a few years’ experience and training, including\r\nas a rule the possession of two or more certificates of the\r\nLibrary Association. They occupy a position somewhat analogous to\r\nthat of non-commissioned officers, and act as reliefs to the\r\nlibrarians-in-charge. Often they are made responsible for some branch of\r\nthe routine, as, for example, book-binding, defaulters, registration of\r\nborrowers, etc., and this is a good method, provided that any one\r\nassistant is not confined rigidly and for too long to one task. A sense\r\nof responsibility is a useful quality which can be fostered in this way.\r\nUsually senior assistants are promoted from the junior staff, but not\r\nalways; and it is becoming a general condition of promotion to this\r\ngrade that the candidate shall have taken some part of the Library\r\nAssociation course. Promotion should never be made unless the candidate\r\nhas shown a disposition to qualify in some such manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=89. Work Book.=--It is a good plan to use a work book or duty book, in\r\nwhich the daily duties of each assistant can be entered. By means of\r\nsuch a book it is easy to change the work about, in order to give every\r\nassistant an opportunity of doing everything in turn; and it is\r\nnecessary because of the changes worked on the composition of the staff\r\nby the time-sheet. A good form of work book for a library where the\r\nstaff is not departmental is shown in the ruling below, which can be\r\nadjusted to meet the conditions in large libraries. The names or numbers\r\nof the assistants are written or printed in the margin, and against\r\nthese the particular duty, or set of duties, to be performed that day\r\nare written. This book is generally made up by the deputy-librarian and\r\nchecked by the librarian. In small libraries the librarian can write up\r\nthis record. Apart from its value as a simple means of distributing and\r\nfixing duties, it makes a capital record of visitors or callers, errors,\r\nabsences of staff, progress of certain pieces of work, checks of various\r\nkinds, and may even be used as a staff time-book. The form given on page\r\n92 (Fig. 7) is a guide to the work of a library and a check upon\r\nresults. For convenience’ sake the assistants are numbered in order of\r\nseniority.\r\n\r\n\r\n=90.= The method of using this book is very simple. If there are ten\r\nassistants or under, one page only is used, each member of the staff\r\nreceiving an appropriate number. If there are more than ten assistants\r\ntwo pages must be used, the numbers on the second page having the figure\r\n1 prefixed to them, and the 10 being altered to 20. Thus page 2 will\r\nappear as 11, 12, 13, 14, etc. If there are more than twenty assistants\r\na third page can be used, the existing numbers having 2 prefixed as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEach assistant on arriving or departing enters on the “Time-Sheet” his\r\nor her exact time in the spaces reserved, beginning the day with the\r\nfirst column. The assistants who check and tidy _a_ to _d_ in the\r\nmornings write their initials opposite the particular duty, while those\r\nwho attend to the charging system, date stamps, overdues and cash for\r\nchange also initial the item, the amount of change being stated. Against\r\neach assistant’s number is written his or her duties for the day. The\r\nfirst page or pages of the work book should be reserved as a key, and\r\nthe names of the assistants should be written against the numbers which\r\nrepresent them. The column “New Orders” is for new instructions for all\r\nthe staff. These should be entered briefly in red ink from the bottom\r\ntowards the top of the page. The Notes lines will receive all items\r\nspecified and any other notable incidents occurring in the course of\r\neach day, such as “Breakdown of Electric Light,” “Drunken man expelled,”\r\netc. The work book must be kept in _one_ recognized place, and every\r\nassistant should be held responsible for entering up his own notes and\r\ntime. Any note of a general kind must be entered by the senior officer\r\npresent on duty. The work book should be submitted to the chief\r\nlibrarian every morning.\r\n\r\n     <-------------------------------9″------------------------------->\r\n   ^ +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n   | |                                                                |\r\n   | |                                                                |\r\n   | |                             Date ............................. |\r\n   | |                                                                |\r\n   | |        Time-Sheet.

Salaries.=--Salaries are the most difficult question the library\r\nprofession has to meet. Up to the present few library workers have been\r\npaid more than a living wage, and many have received barely that. It is\r\nobvious that increases in this direction are essential in the new\r\nconditions; but it is equally obvious that no library should spend so\r\nmuch in salaries that it is unable to purchase new books or to\r\nadminister them. We saw in Section 31 that the average amount spent on\r\nsalaries in the United Kingdom was about 42 per cent. of the entire\r\nincome; and the staff, including the chief librarian, must be\r\nrecompensed from the sum represented. The following figures show what\r\nwas paid in the various positions in 1911:--\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |Income of Library|Librarians in|  Senior   |  Junior   |\r\n  |   Authority.    |   Charge.   |Assistants.|Assistants.|\r\n  +-----------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |       £         |      £      |     £     |     £     |\r\n  |    500- 1,000   |    73-100   |   46- 80  |   19-52   |\r\n  |  1,000- 1,500   |    54- 65   |   58- 90  |   19-52   |\r\n  |  1,500- 2,000   |    84-120   |   77-125  |   24-65   |\r\n  |  2,000- 3,000   |    78-180   |   84- 95  |   20-60   |\r\n  |  3,000- 4,000   |   122-250   |   65-100  |   26-80   |\r\n  |  4,000- 5,000   |   107-160   |   90-130  |   26-65   |\r\n  |  5,000-10,000   |   148-225   |  100-170  |   29-78   |\r\n  | 10,000 and over |    95-160   |  108-170  |   26-56   |\r\n  +-----------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 8.--Salaries paid in 1911.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these “actual” figures are full of anomalies and\r\ndivergences, and the inadequacy of payment they reveal is in some grades\r\npositively remarkable. The European War has produced conditions under\r\nwhich it is impossible for many of these payments to sustain life, and\r\nthe case for better payment is an imperative one. At the same time the\r\nargument is not for increased salaries out of _present_ library means,\r\nbut for increased library means wherewith to pay increased salaries. Any\r\nother course, in present circumstances, would lead many libraries into\r\nbankruptcy. Salaries are subject to deduction, in the case of assistants\r\nearning less than £250 per annum, for National Health Insurance; and in\r\nsome towns having superannuation schemes, contributions, amounting on\r\nthe average to 2½ per cent., are exacted for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following salary scale for junior and senior assistants has been\r\nused in smaller libraries whose incomes exceed £1000:--\r\n\r\n  Juniors--1st year    £26  0 0\r\n           2nd   „      31  4 0\r\n           3rd   „      36  8 0\r\n           4th   „      41 12 0\r\n\r\n  Seniors--1st   „      52  0 0\r\n           2nd   „      62  0 0\r\n           3rd   „      72  0 0\r\n           4th   „      82  0 0\r\n           5th   „      92  0 0\r\n           6th   „     104  0 0\r\n\r\n(Thus, an assistant must, as a rule, wait ten years in order to earn two\r\npounds a week!) All salaries, whether paid monthly or weekly, should not\r\nbe subject to any deduction on account of absences from illness (except\r\nin so far as the matter is governed by National Health Insurance rules),\r\nholidays, or other causes. The annual increases should only be granted\r\nprovided the report of the chief librarian is satisfactory. No assistant\r\nshould be allowed to hold the view that increases in salary are\r\nautomatic and not dependent upon satisfactory service. It is a good plan\r\nto arrange for the whole of the staff increases to become due at the\r\nsame date, so that they can all be considered at one meeting of the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n\r\n=92. Vacation.=--The time granted for annual holidays ranges from three\r\nweeks or more for deputy librarians and departmental librarians to one\r\nweek for juniors. A week or ten days is not sufficient for rest and\r\nchange, and a fortnight is the minimum that should be allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=93. Staff Training.=--In present circumstances every library should\r\nhave a definite official system of training for its staff, and every\r\nassistance in and inducement to study should be given. The low salaries\r\npaid in libraries demand that assistants shall at least receive in part\r\nreturn the best equipment that can be given them. The first essential is\r\ngeneral education approximating to matriculation, and definite study of\r\n_literature_ should be required from the first year. Where such training\r\nhas not been acquired previously, junior assistants should be required\r\nto read in such manner that they may at the age of sixteen take the\r\nPreliminary Test offered by the Library Association, and no assistant\r\nshould be retained permanently, in his own interests as well as in those\r\nof the library, who is unable to pass that Test. Not until the Test is\r\npassed should assistants be encouraged to study the more technical\r\ndivisions of the Library Association syllabus. Chief librarians should\r\nsupervise the training of the whole staff and hold periodical brief\r\nexaminations to convince themselves that it is being pursued\r\nsystematically. Every librarian-in-charge should be held responsible for\r\ndirecting the studies of his subordinates, and in small libraries the\r\ndeputy-librarian should assume this duty. Some libraries have staff\r\nguilds which hold regular classes, sometimes with outside teachers in\r\nspecial subjects; and the plan is to be commended. All books that may be\r\nrequired should be provided by the library, and class fees and\r\nexamination expenses are paid in many towns--a method which deserves\r\nuniversal adoption. Every professional certificate won should command\r\nsome financial recompense, however small; and, other things being equal,\r\npromotion should be given only to assistants who hold certificates. In a\r\nfew libraries, but in an increasing number, a certain amount of study is\r\nallowed in official hours; this is a matter of time-sheet arrangement,\r\nas sporadic reading in ordinary library hours is not to be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n=94. The Library Economy Library.=--The foundation of all training is a\r\ncollection of works on library economy and bibliography. A library\r\nwithout this is not properly equipped, and some libraries have much to\r\nseek in the matter. Every recognized text-book on the theory and\r\npractice of every department of librarianship, all library periodicals,\r\nthe best examples of catalogues, bulletins, reading lists, annual\r\nreports, and the standard bibliographies, should be available on the\r\nfreest conditions to the whole staff. Some libraries set apart a\r\ndefinite fund for the purchase of such works; and its expenditure is one\r\nof the best ultimate economies in which a committee can engage.\r\nMoreover, the institution which ostensibly provides the literature of\r\nall other professions is obviously in a ridiculous position if it does\r\nnot provide the literature of librarianship. In Appendix II. we give a\r\nlist of the works which should form the professional collection of every\r\nlibrary of average size; and even small libraries should endeavour to\r\nbecome possessed of the majority of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=95. Women Librarians and Assistants.=--The employment of women in\r\nlibraries is not universal in this country, and very few women hold the\r\nposition of chief librarian, and these only of small libraries. In the\r\nUnited States the proportion of women librarians and assistants is\r\nnearer 95 per cent. than the 14 or 15 per cent. of Britain. There can\r\nhardly be a doubt, however, that women will be more extensively employed\r\nin British municipal libraries than they have been hitherto. In large\r\ntowns it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and retain the\r\nservices of intelligent lads who will devote themselves to the work, and\r\nit is unnecessary to affirm nowadays that a well-educated, intelligent\r\ngirl is just as suitable for public library work as a well-educated lad.\r\nIf women are employed in libraries, they should be paid at the same rate\r\nas men or lads performing similar duties. There is no reason why a woman\r\nshould be paid less than a man for doing exactly the same work.\r\nEverything recommended regarding qualifications, duties, etc., should\r\napply to women as well as to men. It is the opinion of some librarians\r\nthat, if women are employed, the staff should be composed entirely of\r\nthem, as a mixed staff requires various kinds of separate accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=96. Caretakers.=--A satisfactory janitor or caretaker, generally\r\nspeaking, is a valuable member of staff, and is rare. A good man seldom\r\nstays very long, so easy is it for him to seek and obtain promotion.\r\nCaretakers’ wages vary all over the country, according to the size of\r\nthe library, amount of work and perquisites. In cases where a residence\r\nis provided, it is usual to secure the services of a man and his wife,\r\nand furnish him with a uniform and the usual light, coal, etc. In such\r\ncases the wages are usually less than when a man has to find his own\r\nresidence. From 25s. to 30s. weekly is the wage given when a house is\r\nprovided. In other instances, according to circumstances, the wages vary\r\nfrom 27s. 6d. to 50s. weekly. In large libraries extra assistance should\r\nalways be provided, and the cleaning should be done early in the\r\nmorning, before the hour of opening. A sufficient staff of cleaners\r\nshould be provided to enable this to be done without interfering with\r\nthe service of the public. Three hours every morning should suffice to\r\nclean any library, and it is important to employ plenty of help. The\r\nwages of cleaners vary from 9d. an hour downwards, but it is more often\r\nthe practice to pay so much a week according to circumstances. Rates for\r\nthis class of work differ so much that it is impossible to do more than\r\nroughly indicate a possible basis.\r\n\r\nA caretaker should be made responsible to the librarian for the\r\ncleanness and order of the building, and his duties should include a\r\ncertain number of hours’ attendance in uniform as general overseer of\r\nthe rooms and their frequenters. It is imperative that this official\r\nshould not be allowed to develop the attitude of a Jack-in-office, and\r\nin all his patrol work courtesy and firmness should be required. Eight\r\nor nine hours daily should be considered full time for a caretaker, and\r\nsuitable arrangements must be made to enable him to remain off duty at\r\nhours when the business is quiet. In large libraries it is customary to\r\nemploy more than one janitor or caretaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n=97. Staff and Public.=--It is most important that good relations should\r\nexist between readers and the whole of the staff. It is a well-known\r\nfact that one or two overbearing assistants can render a public library\r\nmore unpopular than almost anything else. Assistants should school\r\nthemselves to endure with philosophy the impertinence of the small\r\nnumber of the general public who contrive to make themselves\r\nobjectionable in every town, and not visit on the heads of the\r\ninoffensive majority the sins of the inconsiderate few. The staff of\r\nevery public library should learn as a first lesson that they are the\r\nservants and not the masters of the people, and that mutual self-respect\r\ncan be maintained without undue familiarity on the one side or aloofness\r\non the other. The supercilious “official” attitude, with which public\r\nservants are so frequently credited, is to be completely repressed and\r\nkept under, and the public should be taught to appreciate their own\r\nlibraries, and to understand that the doors of a municipal library are\r\nalways open to receive and welcome every class of citizen. At the same\r\ntime, preference should not be shown for any particular frequenter or\r\ngroup of frequenters, and gossiping must be suppressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=98. Staff Accommodation.=--In libraries of every size private rooms of\r\nsuitable dimensions should be provided for the librarian and the\r\nassistants; with work- and store-rooms for the staff and caretaker. The\r\nlibrarian’s room in small libraries may be made large enough to serve as\r\na committee room, and in all cases should have separate lavatory\r\naccommodation. A large safe or strong room is often attached to the\r\nlibrarian’s room, or in a secure part of the basement, in which to store\r\nvaluable documents and books. It should be shelved to contain such\r\ndocuments as registers, minutes and other local records in a convenient\r\nmanner, and should be kept well ventilated and dry for the safe\r\npreservation of its contents. Strong rooms vary in size from 4 feet × 6\r\nfeet × 8 feet, to large apartments 20 feet × 20 feet and upwards. The\r\nusual furnishings of a librarian’s room comprise a desk, table,\r\nbookshelves, chairs, hat and umbrella stand, and other office furniture.\r\nStaff mess-rooms should be fitted with tables, chairs, cupboards, with a\r\nlocker for each assistant, cooking apparatus and other appliances.\r\nWork-rooms for staff use must be fitted to suit the class of work\r\ncarried on, whether cataloguing or preparing books, binding or filing.\r\nStore-rooms for general purposes and for the use of the caretaker should\r\nalso be provided, fitted with all necessary cupboards and shelving.\r\nSeparate staff rooms and lavatory accommodation should be provided in\r\nlibraries with staffs composed partly of men, partly of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Cowell, Peter.

The\r\nlargest of these societies is the American Library Association, which\r\nhas nearly 4000 members; and many continental European countries have\r\nsuch societies. In the United Kingdom the principal societies are the\r\nLibrary Association and its branches, and the Library Assistants’\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=100. The Library Association.=--This body, which is the centre and\r\ncontrolling force of British librarianship, was founded in 1877 at the\r\nFirst International Library Conference, which was held in London. In\r\n1898 it received a Royal Charter by which it became the responsible\r\nrepresentative body of the profession. Its objects as set out in the\r\nCharter are to unite all persons engaged or interested in libraries by\r\nmeans of conferences and meetings for the discussion of bibliography and\r\nall other phases of librarianship; to promote the better administration\r\nof libraries; to improve the position and qualifications of librarians;\r\nto promote the adoption of the Public Libraries Acts and the\r\nestablishment of reference and lending libraries for use by the public;\r\nto watch and promote legislation affecting public libraries; to\r\nencourage bibliographical study and research; to publish information of\r\nservice to the members or which in any way furthers the interests of the\r\nAssociation; to collect and maintain a library and museum; to hold\r\nexaminations in librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency;\r\nand to maintain in every lawful way the interests of libraries and their\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nThe Association is not purely professional. It seeks the co-operation in\r\nmembership of library authorities, members of library committees and all\r\npersons who are interested in libraries, as well as library workers\r\nthemselves. The presidency of the Association has until quite recently\r\nusually been held by a public man who was not a librarian. The executive\r\nis a council consisting of president, past presidents, honorary\r\nsecretary, solicitor and treasurer, and twelve members of any grade\r\nrepresenting London, and twenty representing the remainder of the United\r\nKingdom, who, with the exception of the past presidents, are elected\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThe membership consists of Honorary Fellows, Fellows, Members, Associate\r\nMembers and Student Members. The _Honorary Fellowship_ is given for\r\ndistinguished service to the objects of the Association; _Fellows_ are\r\nholders of the Library Association diploma, chief librarians who held\r\noffice before December 1914, and, in some instances, librarians who are\r\ngraduates of universities; _Members_ are librarians[2] who hold four\r\nprofessional certificates and have had three years’ approved library\r\nexperience, or librarians 25 years of age or more, who held office\r\nbefore December 1914 and have had not less than six years’ approved\r\nexperience; _Associate Members_ are librarians not qualified as Fellows\r\nor Members, and non-librarians; _Student Members_ are persons under 25\r\nyears of age who are studying for librarianship; and libraries and\r\ninstitutions are received as _Institution Members_. Fellows and Members\r\nhave the right of using the initials F.L.A. and M.L.A. respectively\r\nafter their names so long as they remain subscribing members. The\r\nentrance fee to all grades of membership is one guinea, and the annual\r\nsubscription is also one guinea, except for Student Members, who pay a\r\nhalf-guinea yearly.\r\n\r\n  [2] The word “librarian” includes “library assistant.” After all,\r\n      “librarian” is the name of a member of a profession, not the\r\n      holder of a position.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of classification of members set out in the last paragraph\r\nhas been in operation since 1914, and in course of time the classes will\r\nshow the degrees of qualification possessed by their members. In 1914,\r\nhowever, many quite undistinguished people were made Fellows simply\r\nbecause they held the chief office in a library, however small or badly\r\nmanaged that institution might be. Hereafter, if the Council carries\r\nout its duties properly, as there is every reason to believe it will,\r\nonly men and women qualified by a searching examination will become\r\nFellows or Members. All classes of members (except student members, who\r\ndo not vote) enjoy equal privileges in the Association.\r\n\r\nThe Association holds monthly meetings from about November to June in\r\nLondon, at which professional papers are read and discussed. It also\r\nholds an Annual Conference, usually early in September, when it is\r\ngenerally the guest of some municipality, and when the greater part of\r\nits members foregather for the discussion of library questions. The\r\nAnnual Conference is the principal library event of the year, and every\r\nlibrary worker who can should attend, as more is to be learned during\r\nthat week than in many months of solitary reading or study of library\r\nproblems. Library committees should not only encourage their librarians\r\nto attend; they should send delegates of their own members, and in the\r\ncase both of these and of the librarians, defray their expenses. The\r\npapers and discussions are published in _The Library Association\r\nRecord_, the monthly official journal of the Association, which is\r\nissued free to all members.\r\n\r\n\r\n=101. Educational Work.=--From the standpoint of this book the most\r\ninteresting part of the Association’s work is that of its Education\r\nCommittee. The Committee holds examinations yearly in May, and the\r\nscheme of examination for the Diploma includes six provisional\r\nexaminations, a language test, a thesis, and, if desirable, further oral\r\nexamination, etc., as follows:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Provisional certificates are granted for:\r\n\r\n  1. Literary History.\r\n  2. Elements of Practical Bibliography.\r\n  3. Classification.\r\n  4. Cataloguing.\r\n  5. Library History, Foundation and Equipment.\r\n  6. Library Routine.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) A satisfactory essay upon some aspect of each of the above\r\n  subjects is required as part of the examination.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Practical experience of not less than 24 hours a week for at\r\n  least 3 years as a member of the administrative staff of one or more\r\n  libraries approved by the Council.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) A thesis showing original thought or research on some subject\r\n  within the purview of the syllabus, the subject being previously\r\n  approved by the Council.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) A certificate approved by the Council, showing an elementary\r\n  knowledge of Latin or Greek, and one modern foreign language. In the\r\n  absence of such certificates the candidates may be examined by\r\n  gentlemen appointed by the Council.\r\n\r\nEach of the examinations may at present be taken separately; and the\r\nmethod of preparation is left to the individual candidates. It may be by\r\nindividual reading, by the correspondence classes provided by the\r\nAssociation, or by attendance at the courses of lectures which the\r\nAssociation also provides. No student, however, is admitted to the\r\nexamination who has not passed matriculation, the senior Oxford or\r\nCambridge Local, or some similar examination. For those who cannot\r\nobtain one of these certificates, the Association prescribes its own\r\nPreliminary Test (held in May and October), which consists of papers in\r\nthe general school subjects and in such matters as will test the\r\ncandidate’s powers of observation and his common sense. The Association\r\npublishes a yearly _Syllabus_ setting forth in detail these conditions,\r\na detailed synopsis of the required subjects, lists of text-books,\r\nclasses, etc., and a full list of certificate-holders.\r\n\r\nThe address of the Association is at Caxton Hall, Westminster, London.\r\n\r\nWe conclude these remarks by saying that librarians may be judged by\r\ntheir relations with the Library Association. Membership is in a broad\r\nsense the seal upon their experience and qualifications; and the\r\ncatholicity of the Association’s educational work and its record of\r\nactivity on behalf of libraries and librarians command the respect and\r\nadherence of all who are likely to read this book. No library worker of\r\nwhatever grade whose income exceeds £100 a year should consider it\r\nconsistent with his self-respect to remain outside this Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n=102. The Library Assistants’ Association.=--This is a purely sectional\r\nassociation for assistants in municipal and institutional (but not\r\ncommercial lending) libraries, and was founded in 1895 by the members of\r\none of the Library Association Summer Schools, to educate and to protect\r\nthe special interests of assistants, and to provide them with a freer\r\nplatform than the Library Association seemed to offer. By means of\r\nmonthly meetings held throughout the winter at various libraries, the\r\nreading of papers, discussions, etc.; by study circles, summer schools,\r\ninternational visits to libraries, and other activities, it has changed\r\nfor the better the whole tone of the library service, and has won for\r\nitself a distinct place amongst professional associations.\r\n\r\nIt is organized on lines similar to those of the Library Association,\r\nbeing governed by a President, Honorary Treasurer, and Honorary\r\nSecretary and a Council of ten London and ten non-London members. Its\r\nmembership is of _Honorary Fellows_, elected for special distinction or\r\nservices; _Fellows_ who are chief librarians who were formerly members;\r\n_Members_, assistant librarians earning salaries of £52 per annum and\r\nmore; and _Associates_, assistants earning less than £52. The\r\nAssociation has several branches; maintains a good professional library\r\n(housed at the Central Public Library, Islington); issues free to all\r\nmembers a monthly journal, _The Library Assistant_; and has been\r\nresponsible for various valuable brief publications included in the\r\n“L.A.A. Series.” The subscriptions for membership are 5s. per annum for\r\nFellows and Members, and 2s. 6d. for Associates.\r\n\r\nThe value of the Association has been widely recognized, and library\r\nassistants, of whatever age or rank, would serve their own interests and\r\nthose of their profession by adhering to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=103. Other Societies.=--Other purely library Societies which may be\r\nmentioned are the Panizzi Club and the Society of Public Librarians. The\r\nPanizzi Club, which was founded in 1914, is mainly composed of\r\nuniversity, Government and institutional--but not municipal--librarians.\r\nIt has not yet published any proceedings, and is interested in the\r\ncompiling of co-operative bibliographies, and in doing such other work\r\nas will co-ordinate and improve the service of the libraries it\r\nrepresents. The Society of Public Librarians is a small body of\r\nlibrarians which meets in London for the reading and discussion of\r\npapers. It does not seek to add to its membership except by the\r\nnomination of existing members.\r\n\r\n\r\n=104.= Societies which are not mainly for librarians, but which are of\r\nconsiderable interest to them, are the Bibliographical Society and the\r\nMuseums Association. The Bibliographical Society, founded in 1892, has\r\nits headquarters at 20 Hanover Square, London, W.1, and exists for the\r\npromoting of the study of the book and manuscript mainly in their\r\nhistorical and bibliographical characteristics. It meets monthly for the\r\nreading and discussion of papers, and publishes, to members only,\r\nvaluable works on matters within its province. The annual subscription\r\nis one guinea, and the entrance fee is a similar sum.\r\n\r\nThe Museums Association, founded in 1889, has for its object the\r\nbringing together of museum officials, members of museum committees, and\r\nothers interested in museum work for mutual discussion and help. Its\r\nmembership is made up of persons who pay a subscription of one guinea\r\nper annum, and associates who pay a half-guinea. An annual meeting,\r\nusually lasting four days, is held in July, when papers are read and\r\ndiscussed. The _Museums Journal_, published monthly, contains the\r\ntransactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=105. Staff Guilds, etc.=--It will be appropriate to say a little here\r\nabout the private organizations of library staffs, known as guilds, or\r\nclubs, which are becoming a feature of larger libraries here and in\r\nAmerica. The members of the staff band themselves together for mutual\r\nimprovement and recreation with a committee chosen of their own numbers\r\nto direct their activities. These latter include classes in library\r\neconomy, literature, and other subjects of interest to assistants for\r\nthe younger members of the staff, and reading circles, elocution\r\nclasses, etc., for the older ones. Recreations, as cricket, swimming,\r\nwalking, photography and other sports, are also arranged by the guilds;\r\nand at Croydon there is an annual excursion which is recognized by the\r\npublic, the libraries being closed for the purpose on the chosen day.\r\nCroydon, Fulham and Glasgow have issued staff magazines in connection\r\nwith their clubs; these are usually cyclostyled publications. The\r\nIslington club has distinguished itself for social gatherings, and the\r\nNew Year’s gathering of the Glasgow club is one of the features of the\r\nlibrary year. Wisely conducted, these guilds have a great influence for\r\ngood, are an incentive to study, and produce that better work which\r\ncomes from mutual understanding amongst library workers. They should be\r\nrecognized by the library committee and the chief librarian, but should\r\nbe perfectly autonomous.\r\n\r\n\r\n=106.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Library Assistant.\r\n\r\n  Library Association Record.\r\n\r\n  Library Association Year Book.\r\n\r\n  Thorne, W.

Theory.=--Although the subject of library buildings has been\r\nfrequently treated by various writers, there is a lack of literature on\r\nthe important question of size limitation and the modifications arising\r\ntherefrom. Controversy has raged round such questions as stacks _versus_\r\nalcoves, general _versus_ special reading rooms, general _versus_\r\nseparate book stores, and so on, but on the much more important\r\nquestion, “What size is the library to be?” hardly any theories or\r\ndefinite statements exist. Beyond a vague general recommendation to\r\nsecure as large a site as possible, in view of future extension, writers\r\non library architecture have not committed themselves to any principle\r\nwhich would guide those responsible for new library buildings in\r\nestimating the provision to be made. The chief reason for this is no\r\ndoubt the cherished tradition that libraries are to be made as large as\r\npossible, because they are the repositories of the literature of the\r\nages and the storehouse for every kind of printed matter. The _museum_\r\nidea of a public library, however, is now giving place to the _workshop_\r\nidea, and few librarians nowadays of average-sized municipal libraries\r\nhold the view that it is their function to provide and retain every\r\nbook, irrespective of its value or appeal, and to attempt to rival the\r\nBritish Museum or Bibliothèque Nationale on a reduced scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n=108.= There are several very important considerations to be advanced in\r\nfavour of limiting libraries both as regards book storage and\r\naccommodation for readers, and these shall be set out in order. However\r\nmuch one may sympathize with the view that all public libraries ought to\r\ncollect _everything_--on the grounds that it may one day be used, and\r\nthat nothing which illustrates past life, customs, etc., should be\r\nignored--it is only fair to point out that this work is already being\r\ndone effectively by general or special libraries in all parts of the\r\ncountry. This particular form of literature conservation is the chief\r\nprovince of the great State libraries like the British Museum, Patent\r\nOffice, India Office, National Libraries of Ireland and Wales, etc.; the\r\nuniversity libraries; the endowed or special libraries like the\r\nAdvocates’ (Edinburgh), Mitchell (Glasgow), John Rylands (Manchester);\r\nthe great proprietary libraries of a special kind like the Royal\r\nColonial Institute, Athenæum Club, Signet (Edinburgh), London Library,\r\netc.; and scientific, law and collegiate libraries of all kinds. The\r\nburden of carrying on this tradition of universal garnering need not be\r\nborne by municipal libraries, except in the case of great towns such as\r\nBirmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol, where the\r\nlibraries may reasonably be expected to be as representative as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=109.= The workshop form of public library provides for the systematic\r\nand continuous revision of the stock of the library, and in this way it\r\nbecomes practicable to fix a rough limit to the size of a building. This\r\nis a most important matter, because it is undoubtedly the result of a\r\ngeneral cultivation of the museum idea which has led to the formation of\r\nsome municipal libraries, a great portion of whose contents could be\r\ndiscarded without perceptible inconvenience to anyone. While the wisdom\r\nof acquiring additional land for future extension, should it be\r\nrequired, can be admitted, the wisdom of erecting and furnishing large\r\nbuildings on the assumption that they ought to be filled as speedily as\r\npossible can be questioned safely. The result of overbuilding is to\r\ncripple the early and most critical years of the library’s existence\r\nwith heavy loans and their repayment, while the upkeep of a great\r\nbuilding ultimately designed to accommodate 100,000 volumes and 500\r\nreaders, though starting with only 10,000 volumes and 100 readers, is\r\nsure to be out of all proportion. Library buildings should bear some\r\nproportion to the funds available for their maintenance and the\r\npercentage of the public they are likely to attract.\r\n\r\n\r\n=110.= The chief danger with most library authorities is the tendency to\r\nerect a library building having no relation to the funds available for\r\nits maintenance. The laudable desire for a handsome architectural\r\nexterior, which all public buildings ought to have, is frequently\r\ncarried to such an extent that utility is completely sacrificed to an\r\nornamental outside appearance. Where funds are plentiful, as they would\r\nbe without a limited rate, there is no reason why a fine-looking\r\nbuilding should not be provided, but where money is strictly limited it\r\nis necessary to consider the plans rather than the elevation. In any\r\ncase, the interior arrangements should never be subordinated to the\r\ndesire for mere outward show and ornament, and a library building in the\r\nhands of a competent architect can be made of a suitable and dignified\r\ndesign notwithstanding the rate limitation. In too many cases most of\r\nthe money provided for library buildings has been spent on the\r\nstructure, with the result that the interior fittings have been cut down\r\nto the cheapest and meanest varieties. The outside of a library building\r\nis its least important feature, and should never be so extravagant as to\r\nimperil the utility and appearance of the interior arrangements. There\r\nare library buildings now existing on which much money has been lavished\r\napparently for the purpose of providing façades to dazzle the townsfolk,\r\nbut which, nevertheless, are not only inconveniently planned inside, but\r\nfurnished and fitted up in a style which suggests a kitchen rather than\r\na public institution. This is often brought about by a wrong division of\r\nthe money borrowed for building and furnishing purposes. A sum is set\r\napart for furniture, which would be ample if such permanent fittings as\r\nbookshelves, counters, screens, etc., were not included. But when these\r\nare provided out of a furniture loan it is seldom that a large enough\r\nsum is borrowed. It is important to remember that such fittings as\r\nbookcases, counters, screens, wall newspaper slopes, barriers, lifts,\r\ngalleries, etc., form permanent parts of the building, and ought to be\r\nincluded in the building loan, which can be borrowed for thirty years. A\r\nfurniture loan must be repaid within ten years, and only such _movable_\r\nitems as tables, chairs, desks, office furniture, etc., should be bought\r\nfrom this fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n=111.= Assuming, also, that a building must be provided which will bear\r\nsome relation to the number of persons who will be attracted, the stock\r\nto be housed, and the funds available for maintenance, the following\r\nfactors are presented as a basis from which estimates can be made:--\r\n\r\nIt has been definitely ascertained that 6 per cent. of the population of\r\nthe average town become borrowers. For this number the average stock of\r\nbooks provided in lending libraries is three per borrower. Books are\r\nkept out on an average ten days each, or twelve days non-fiction, eight\r\ndays fiction. In a year of 306 days each borrower will read about thirty\r\nbooks. Here, then, is a basis from which to start in providing\r\naccommodation for a lending library. If a town has 50,000 inhabitants,\r\nit will attract 3000 borrowers, who will require 9000 volumes as a\r\nminimum lending stock. The annual issue should be 90,000 volumes. It\r\nfollows that the minimum lending library accommodation in a case like\r\nthis should comprise shelving for 9000 volumes, and lobby or other\r\nspaces for at least seventy-five persons present at one time. In theory\r\nan issue of 300 per day should mean an average hourly attendance of\r\nthirty per hour, but in actual practice it must be recognized that\r\nborrowers attend at uncertain parts of the day, and most commonly during\r\nthe last two or three hours in the evening; therefore it is safe to\r\nallow for the accommodation of at least one-fourth of the daily average\r\nnumber of visitors. Many lending libraries are overshelved owing to a\r\nfailure to recognize the possibility of revision of stock and the\r\nequally important fact that the best shelving for books is in the homes\r\nof the people.\r\n\r\nThe same rules apply to all the other departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSITES AND PLANS\r\n\r\n\r\n=112.= This chapter is of a purely practical character, with\r\nillustrations from well-known examples of library plans. Except in the\r\nnecessary precautionary remarks made already, it has been thought\r\nundesirable to dwell upon the elevations of libraries and the relative\r\ndesirability of façades, although much might be said upon the subject\r\nand it is worthy of careful attention. Such a discussion, however, could\r\nbe useful only if a long series of illustrations were given ranging say\r\nfrom the New York and Pittsburgh public libraries, the National Library\r\nof Wales, the Liverpool Public Library and the Mitchell Library at\r\nGlasgow, which are large and handsome architectural edifices, to the\r\nmore modest but satisfactory small buildings such as those at Bromley,\r\nHerne Hill and Wallasey. Although a certain common character is to be\r\nfound in smaller municipal library elevations, and especially in\r\nCarnegie libraries, there is no distinctive type of elevation peculiar\r\nto libraries which immediately suggests the purpose of the buildings.\r\nThis is one of the things to be desired in British architecture, as it\r\nis fair to expect that such buildings should be both artistic and\r\nappropriate, if such results can be reached without the sacrifice of\r\neven more important considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=113.= It is premised that all central libraries require certain\r\ndepartments, including reference and lending libraries, newspaper room,\r\nmagazine (or periodicals) room, children’s room, lecture room, and\r\nadministrative departments--librarian’s office, cataloguing room, store\r\nrooms, staff rooms, cloak rooms, etc. Too often the provision made for\r\nadministrative and staff purposes is inadequate, and the library suffers\r\ngreatly in consequence. Branch libraries do not, as a rule, have\r\nreference rooms, although accommodation for a collection of\r\nquick-reference books is necessary, and in many branch libraries\r\nnewspaper and magazine rooms are combined. All the apartments premised\r\nabove are not present in all buildings. Older libraries have no separate\r\nprovision for children, and indeed work with children on a large scale\r\nis quite a recent development of library activity, but the desirability\r\nof such a department is made clear in Division XIII. Lecture rooms are\r\nrarer still, because of the peculiar view taken by legal authority that\r\nlectures are not within the province of libraries; and in some of the\r\nlarger cities lecture work is adequately carried out by other\r\ninstitutions. A modern librarian, however, regards a lecture room as a\r\nnecessary part of his building, and even in the larger cities lectures\r\nwhich are purely library lectures, having a direct bearing upon the use\r\nof books, can be given satisfactorily only in direct connexion with the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=114. Sites.=--In choosing sites for public library buildings committees\r\nshould bear in mind the following principles:--\r\n\r\n  1. They should be central and easily accessible from all parts of the\r\n  district, by tramways or other conveyances.\r\n\r\n  2. They should be as far as possible isolated from all other\r\n  buildings, particularly shops.\r\n\r\n  3. Quiet side streets are preferable to noisy main thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n  4. Level sites are preferable to those on steep gradients.\r\n\r\n  5. More ground than is required for immediate use should be secured if\r\n  possible.\r\n\r\nA large number of the public libraries of the country are erected upon\r\nland which has been presented to the towns, and an endeavour should be\r\nmade to procure a gift of this kind before a purchase is made. It will\r\nmake a considerable difference to the size and quality of the building\r\nwhich can be provided if land has to be purchased. Frequently land can\r\nbe secured upon a long lease at a nominal or peppercorn rent, and when\r\nthis can be done it is better than borrowing more money than the rate\r\nwill allow, and thereby crippling the library in its early years. In the\r\ntables in Section 31 no direct provision is made for loans for sites,\r\nbut if it is necessary that money must be borrowed for the purpose, the\r\nmargin which is mentioned as arising from incidental receipts, will\r\nprobably meet the annual repayments of a loan spread over fifty years,\r\nif the site and its purchase money are not excessive. But in any case,\r\nlet the advice to committees be reiterated not to borrow money for sites\r\ntill they have exhausted every hope of inducing some public-spirited\r\ncitizen or public body to come forward with a gift of land. This is the\r\nonly way, save in towns with very large incomes, in which the inadequate\r\nprovisions of the Public Libraries Acts can be in part overcome. At the\r\nsame time it should be remembered that by these and other Acts of\r\nParliament special power is given to town councils and other public\r\nbodies to convey land to library authorities for building purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=115. The Architect.=--When a suitable site has been secured it is usual\r\nto institute a competition for the planning and design of the building.\r\nThis is not necessarily the best method; indeed, we are of opinion that\r\nmore satisfactory results are obtained if a reputable architect is\r\nengaged without competition other than his previous record establishes\r\nfor him in comparison with other architects, who will carry out the\r\ndirections of the committee. The importance of appointing a professional\r\nlibrarian before any serious step is taken or permanent arrangement is\r\nmade has already been pointed out. No plan should be drawn up or\r\naccepted without such skilled guidance as he can give. The mistakes made\r\nin the past through neglect of this precaution are a warning to\r\ncommittees never to trust to their own choice and judgment, and not to\r\nrely entirely upon an architect, who is often unacquainted with the best\r\narrangements for working a public library, however great his artistic\r\nand technical qualifications may be. Assuming that a competent librarian\r\nhas been appointed, the first thing to do after securing a site is to\r\ndetermine the size and kind of building required, and to make out a\r\nrough plan of the interior arrangements and prepare a specification of\r\nrequirements or instructions to the architect. If a competition is\r\ndetermined upon, a limited one is preferable to any open one, unless\r\nthere are local or other reasons against such a course. In the case of\r\nan open competition, advertisements should be inserted in the local\r\npapers, and in _The Architect_, _Builder_ and _Building News_, inviting\r\narchitects to compete, and asking them to apply for the conditions.\r\nPremiums should be fixed for the designs placed first, second and third\r\nin order of merit by the assessor who judges the plans. These must be\r\nregulated by the size and style of the building. £50, £30 and £20 have\r\nbeen offered for buildings costing £4000 and upwards. Premiated designs\r\nbecome the property of the committee. The Royal Institute of British\r\nArchitects, London, should be asked to nominate an assessor at a fee to\r\nbe determined, and of course such assessor will not be a competitor. It\r\nis usual to merge the premium of the successful architect whose design\r\nis carried out into the fee paid him for superintending the work, which\r\namounts to 5 per cent. on the cost of the building, including all\r\nextras.\r\n\r\n\r\n=116. Instructions and Plan.=--The instructions to the competitors\r\nshould be accompanied by a plan of the site drawn to quarter- or\r\neighth-inch scale, and showing building line and ancient lights, if any.\r\nThey should specify the amount and kind of accommodation required on\r\neach floor, and state that the cost should not exceed a certain sum\r\nexclusive of movable furniture. Permanent fittings should include\r\nbookcases, wall and standard; screens, counters, wall slopes for\r\nnewspapers, barriers, and any other kind of fixture. The conditions as\r\nregards premiums, assessing, etc., should be sent with the instructions\r\nand site plan. All competitive designs should be drawn to the same scale\r\n(one-fourth or one-eighth inch), and should be finished in black without\r\ncolour or ornament. Perspective drawings, in addition to elevations, may\r\nbe sent at the discretion of each competitor. Each set of drawings\r\nshould include a plan of every floor, showing proposed arrangement of\r\nbookcases, counters, furniture, etc.; an elevation of every face; and a\r\nsection through the building both ways. Plenty of time should be allowed\r\nfor the sending in of designs; three months at least from date of\r\nadvertisement. Usually the assessor draws up the instructions, and\r\nafterwards circulates answers to any questions which may be put by the\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=117. Selection of Plan.=--The competing drawings should be sent in\r\nunmarked in any way, but should be numbered in order of receipt, so that\r\nthe assessor and committee cannot recognize the author. The competitor’s\r\nname and address should be sent separately in a sealed envelope marked\r\non the outside with the same number, and some such words as “architect’s\r\nname and address,” to prevent accidental opening. It is the duty of the\r\nassessor to advise the committee as to the practicability of every\r\ndesign; to determine if it is in accordance with the instructions; to\r\nascertain if it can be carried out for the amount stated; and to judge\r\nwhich designs are first, second and third in order of merit after\r\nfulfilling the conditions of the instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=118.= The following rules for judging library plans will be found\r\nuseful; they are based on a wide experience of planning in all its\r\ndepartments, and can be used by architectural assessors and librarians\r\nas a guide:--\r\n\r\n  1. No public room should be made a thoroughfare leading to any other\r\n  public room.\r\n\r\n  2. All exits from public rooms should be within view of the staff.\r\n\r\n  3. Oversight of public rooms should, if possible, be secured without\r\n  the need for special officers in every room. For this purpose\r\n  ornamental glazed partitions are preferable to solid walls.\r\n\r\n  4. No passage for public traffic should be less than 4 feet wide.\r\n  Where movable chairs are used the passages should be from 6 to 8 feet\r\n  wide.\r\n\r\n  5. Cross gangways between table and bookcase-ends should not be less\r\n  than 3 feet if used as thoroughfares, but may be 2 feet only if simply\r\n  spaces to enable readers or assistants to pass round.\r\n\r\n  6. Bookcases should not exceed 7 feet 6 inches in height either in\r\n  open access or closed libraries, and shelves should be of the uniform\r\n  length of 3 feet, unless for folio and quarto stock, when 18 inches\r\n  will be found better. For fiction wall shelves in open access\r\n  libraries, the depth should not exceed 7 inches.\r\n\r\n  7. Standard bookcases in open access libraries should be spaced at not\r\n  less than 6 feet apart when facing each other, and in closed libraries\r\n  at not less than 3 feet apart.\r\n\r\n  8. Magazine room readers should be allowed not less than 12\r\n  superficial feet each, including table and passage room.\r\n\r\n  9. Reference library readers should be allowed not less than 18\r\n  superficial feet, including table and passage room.\r\n\r\n  10. Where indicators are used in lending libraries the counter space\r\n  should provide 5 feet run for every 4000 volumes stored, or 15 inches\r\n  per 1000 numbers, and at least 10 feet run of clear space for service.\r\n  The public space in front of any such counter should not be less than\r\n  10 feet wide, unless in a very small library, when it may be 6.\r\n\r\n  11. In open access lending libraries the spaces should not be less\r\n  than those shown in No. 7 above. As a general rule it will be found\r\n  easy and fairly accurate to allow 20 square feet to every borrower\r\n  estimated to be present at one time, and disregard the provision of\r\n  stock. In this calculation allowance is made for gangways, stock and\r\n  readers.\r\n\r\n  12. Allow nine volumes per foot run in lending library shelving, and\r\n  eight volumes per foot run in reference library shelving. A 7 foot 6\r\n  inch bookcase should give an average of eight shelves per tier in a\r\n  lending library, and about the same in a reference library, if\r\n  separate provision is made in wall cases for folio and other large\r\n  books.\r\n\r\n  13. Public lobbies and staircases must be arranged according to the\r\n  rules laid down by any local or general building act or bye-law.\r\n\r\n  14. Newspaper slopes should allow an average of 4 feet run for every\r\n  paper. This will provide for spaces between papers.\r\n\r\nIn some towns the competition designs for library buildings have been\r\nplaced on exhibition, to enable the public and other interested persons\r\nto compare the premiated with the other drawings. This seems an\r\nadmirable procedure, regarded as a mere matter of policy, but the\r\npractical advantage is somewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=119. Library Planning.=--In subsequent chapters are set out in detail\r\nsome of the chief requirements of the different departments of a public\r\nlibrary, and here may be noted a few general principles, illustrated\r\nwith plans. It is impossible to fix any data which will apply to all\r\nsizes and shapes of sites, on account of differences introduced by\r\ndifficulties of lighting, approaches and varying local requirements. The\r\ndata given above (Section 118) can be applied in most cases, as\r\ndimensions of this class seldom vary, but any additional data are\r\ncertain to be modified by local conditions.\r\n\r\nThe chief principle to be emphasized is the one already stated, that\r\npublic libraries should be constructed and stocked with the view to\r\nconstant revision, and that their size should be limited by the number\r\nof _live_ books likely to be wanted at any period. It is difficult to\r\nsay what the number of actually living books will be at any given\r\nperiod, but judging by the selections which have been made in histories\r\nof literature and in such books as Sonnenschein’s _Best Books_, it may\r\nbe roughly estimated that there are about 50,000 works of perennial\r\ninterest which are worth storing in a modern workshop library. Even this\r\nnumber could be reduced by one-half and still be made fairly\r\nrepresentative of every literature, period and subject of human\r\ninterest. In the largest municipal libraries a very considerable\r\nproportion of the stock is composed of duplicates of popular books in\r\ncentral and branch libraries, while practically one-half of the stock of\r\nsuch libraries consists of literature which is rarely used. The\r\nprovision of book-storage should, therefore, be limited in the case of\r\nmunicipal libraries, not so much by the size of building which can be\r\nafforded by the income, but by the actual living books which are likely\r\nto be required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Sketch Plan for a Small Town Library (Section\r\n119).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--North Islington Library, with Reading Room on\r\nGround Floor (Section 120).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--North Islington Library, with Lending\r\nDepartment on First Floor (Section 120).]\r\n\r\nIn libraries which start with incomes of £500, provision should not be\r\nmade for more than 20,000 volumes. In those with commencing incomes of\r\n£1000 to £2000 room, for 40,000 volumes will be found ample. From £2000\r\nto £3000, 60,000 volumes; from £3000 to £4000, 100,000 volumes; from\r\n£4000 to £5000, 130,000 volumes; from £5000 to £6000, 160,000 volumes,\r\nand so on. Bearing these figures in mind, the planning of library\r\nbuildings becomes greatly simplified. The main points to be aimed at in\r\nlibrary planning are good light, convenient access to rooms, a fair\r\namount of oversight, and the arrangement of departments so as to secure\r\nquiet in the principal reading rooms. For this last reason the reference\r\nlibrary should be put farthest away from both newsroom and lending\r\nlibrary, so that the traffic of these departments will not disturb\r\nreaders. In small libraries it is best and most convenient to keep the\r\nwhole of the departments on one floor, obtaining light, if necessary,\r\nfrom the roof. The sketch plan, Fig. 9, shows a convenient arrangement\r\nfor such a library.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Lambeth (Herne Hill Branch) Open Access Library\r\nwith Radiating Stacks in a Square Room (Section 121).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=120.= The plans which are given in this section illustrate the\r\nprincipal points raised. They will also serve as suggestions to\r\ncommittees, librarians and architects charged with the establishment of\r\nnew library buildings. Figs. 10 and 11 represent a building designed to\r\nbe worked on the open access system in each department, and in every\r\nrespect it is a model of good arrangement and convenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Montrose Open Access Lending Library (Section\r\n121).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=121.= The principle of radiation to secure oversight and ease of\r\nworking is well illustrated in this plan. The next plan (Fig. 12) shows\r\nthe plan of radiation applied to an open access lending department in a\r\nsquare room, and here it is obvious that considerable loss of space is\r\nsustained in the angles. The same objection applies to the arrangement\r\nof Figs. 13 and 14. Figs. 10 and 11 show the children’s room and general\r\nreading room on the ground floor, and the lending library on the first\r\nfloor, together with a lecture room. It is argued in favour of this that\r\nfewer people go to the lending department than to the reading room, and\r\nthat the plan is therefore more convenient. In practice it has been\r\nfound an admirable arrangement. Figs. 15 and 16 show the arrangement of\r\na large library, fully equipped with all departments, and in this the\r\nradial arrangement of bookcases in the lending library has not been\r\nadopted because of the shape of the room. Another plan on the same\r\nprinciple (Fig. 27) illustrates an open access library without radiating\r\nbookcases, and a double entrance and exit counter. An interesting\r\narrangement for a small open access library is afforded by the Fulham\r\nNorth Library, designed by the late Franklin T. Barrett, in which the\r\nlending department is shown in a gallery surrounding a reading room on\r\nthe ground floor (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Bromley (Kent) Open Access Lending Library with\r\nRadiating Stacks in a Square Room (Section 121). This Library has now\r\nbeen re-arranged, and the radiating stacks arranged in parallel order.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=122.= The following plans of closed libraries, worked on various\r\nsystems, speak for themselves, and show clearly the variety of ways in\r\nwhich this kind of library can be arranged.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 shows a semi-circular counter with the books arranged behind,\r\nthe borrowers’ space being flanked by a reading room and juvenile room.\r\nFigs. 19 and 20 are arranged with long counters providing for indicators\r\nfor fiction and card changing for non-fiction, with the other\r\ndepartments grouped round. Fig. 21 shows an indicator occupying the\r\nsides of a large lobby on the first floor, and Fig. 22 a plan for\r\nworking a library on the open access system for non-fiction, and the\r\nindicator for fiction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Islington Central Library. Ground Floor Plan\r\n(Section 121).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16 (Section 121).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=123.= The plan on p. 129 shows a case in which the arrangements are\r\ndesigned as a compromise between whole and partial open access, the\r\nlending department having open access for non-fiction and the closed\r\nsystem for fiction (Fig. 22). It is doubtful if any advantage arises\r\nfrom this compromise, and certainly readers are denied the privilege of\r\nreferring from class to class, and cut off from the pleasure of seeing\r\nthe whole of a classified collection of books at one time. The great\r\nadditional mutual oversight of reader over reader is also lost, and\r\nthere is always the suspicion attaching to such a compromise that a\r\nfavoured class has been created.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Fulham (North) Library Plan, showing Open\r\nAccess Lending Library on First Floor and Reading Room, through Well, on\r\nGround Floor (Section 121).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=124. Building Specification and Contracts.=--The specification for the\r\nbuilding on which builders are required to tender will be prepared by\r\nthe architect, and it is usual in most cases to have the quantities\r\nabstracted by a surveyor, so that contractors can all tender for the\r\nsame thing. The surveyor’s fee, 1 per cent. to 1½ per cent., according\r\nto the total amount, is usually included in the specification, as are\r\nalso allowances for other extras, such as foundation-stones, memorial\r\ntablets, and such items as presentation trowels, etc., if a\r\nfoundation-stone laying is made a public ceremony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--St Pancras Central Library (a proposed\r\nbuilding), showing Lending Department arranged for Indicator Charging\r\n(Section 122).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=125.= The contract for the building may be publicly advertised in such\r\njournals as the _Contract Journal_, _Builder_, _Building News_ and the\r\nlocal newspapers, or may be confined to a few selected firms, and the\r\ntenders should, when received, be opened at a meeting of the library\r\nauthority, to which the firms who tender may be invited. When a contract\r\nis accepted and signed it should contain a clause specifying that all\r\nextras must be sanctioned by the library authority before being put in\r\nhand, and must be certified by the architect when completed. It is well\r\nto avoid extras by making a careful estimate in advance, but if they are\r\nsupplied, great precaution must be used to see that they are limited and\r\nstrictly watched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Glasgow Branch Library, Plan and Elevation\r\n(Section 122).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Glasgow Branch Library, Plan and Elevation\r\n(Section 122).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=126.= A clerk of works must be appointed to watch over the building\r\noperations on behalf of the library authority and the architect, and\r\nit is a wise and most economical policy to pay for a first-rate man. The\r\nwages of a competent man, who is usually recommended by the architect,\r\nwill amount to from about £7 weekly, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe architect’s fee is 5 per cent. on the total cost of the building,\r\nincluding extras and all furniture or other fittings which he may\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Lending Library on First Floor adjoining\r\nReference Library (Section 122).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=127. Opening Ceremony, etc.=--There are certain ceremonial matters\r\nconnected with the laying of foundation-stones, unveiling of memorial\r\nstones or brasses and opening ceremonies, which each locality must\r\narrange to suit its own needs. An opening ceremony of a public character\r\nis always so useful in making known a library that it ought when\r\npossible to be arranged. It need not be a very expensive function, and\r\nif an eminent public personage, local or otherwise, can be secured to\r\nperform the ceremony, so much the better. It is a doubtful point whether\r\nthe expense of an opening ceremony can be defrayed from the library\r\nrate. In districts where the expenditure is audited by a Government\r\nauditor, a moderate sum may be passed, with the caution not to incur\r\nsuch charge again, but it is dangerous to assume that this expenditure\r\nwill always be allowed. Such expenditure, if incurred, would not of\r\ncourse include any extravagant items such as banquets, receptions, etc.,\r\nbut be confined to printing and other expenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Lending Library with Open Access for\r\nNon-fiction (Section 123).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=128.= The lighting, heating and ventilation of library buildings are\r\nall matters which primarily concern the architect; and they are seldom\r\nsolved in a completely satisfactory manner. Lighting is the one that\r\nmost directly interests the librarian, as much of the effectiveness of\r\nlibraries depends upon it. A valuable discussion upon the question took\r\nplace in 1911 at joint-meetings of the Illuminating Engineering Society\r\nand the Library Association, at which both librarians and lighting\r\nengineers expressed their views and experience. The matter is one for\r\nexpert advice, but librarians should be clear as to the problems to be\r\nsolved in artificial lighting; these are:\r\n\r\n  To light reading room tables, so as to avoid glare in the eyes of\r\n  readers.\r\n\r\n  To prevent the casting of strong shadows, single or multiple.\r\n\r\n  To avoid fixing furniture or fittings in permanent positions.\r\n\r\n  To ensure the illumination of the room generally, as well as the\r\n  tables.\r\n\r\n  To light the vertical spaces presented by two cases of books standing\r\n  face to face, with a narrow gangway between, so that the book-titles\r\n  on all the shelves can be read easily.\r\n\r\nTo ensure good results attention must be directed to general lighting,\r\nwhich should be full in newspaper and similar rooms, but subordinate in\r\nreference libraries; and it is recommended that point lighting, with\r\npositions fixed and shades chosen to prevent glare, should be used at\r\nall reading points and tables; and if possible _all_ lights should be\r\nsuspended from the ceiling, as to fix them upon furniture involves the\r\nanchoring of the furniture to the floors or walls. In general lighting\r\nthe use of the walls and ceilings as reflectors should be remembered,\r\nand the walls should be tinted in such colours as return the maximum\r\nreflection. The problem of lighting gangways of books has not been\r\nsolved satisfactorily, but tube-o’-lights or line-o’-lights fixed on the\r\ntop cornice of cases have given good results. Lights centred above\r\ngangways are the most usual method, but these produce shadows. We can\r\ntouch upon this subject only briefly, but the gravest thought should be\r\ngiven to it, as systems of lighting which are most effective\r\narchitecturally are often quite useless for library purposes.\r\n\r\nThe ventilation of the rooms should be thorough and yet exclude\r\ndraughts; and on this matter, as upon the kindred matter of heating, we\r\ncannot do more here than refer to the recent literature upon those\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n=129.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Adams, H.

Such fittings should be included in the loan raised for\r\nbuilding, which can be borrowed for thirty years, and not in that raised\r\nfor furniture, which can only be borrowed for ten years. The additional\r\ntwenty years for which money can be borrowed for permanent buildings\r\nwill be found to make a very considerable difference in the annual\r\nrepayments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=131. Counters and Barriers.=--Counters and barriers are required\r\nchiefly in lending and reference libraries, or in situations where it is\r\nnecessary to cut readers off from books or private rooms. No lending\r\nlibrary counter which has to carry an indicator should be more than\r\nthirty inches high and eighteen inches wide, and for ledger or card\r\ncharging and open access the dimensions need not be more than thirty-two\r\ninches high and two feet wide. Reference library counters for cutting\r\nreaders off from the books and for service should be thirty-two inches\r\nhigh and two feet wide. All counters should be fitted on the staff side\r\nwith shelves and cupboards, and on the public side the panelling should\r\nbe raised at least four inches from the floor to prevent it from being\r\nkicked and marked. It is a useful plan to fit up the back of a long\r\ncounter with shelves, drawers and cupboards alternately, as shown in\r\ndiagram on the next page (Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nThis arrangement can be carried out to any extent and in any order,\r\naccording to space. In lending library counters a slot for money should\r\nbe made in the top of the counter over one of the small locked drawers.\r\nThis will form the till for cash receipts from fines, the sale of\r\ncatalogues, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Back of Library Counter (Section 131).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=132.= Barriers for open access lending and reference libraries are made\r\nin various forms. In small open access libraries the barriers need only\r\nbe large enough to control the entrances and exits of readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--West Islington Library, showing wicket.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--North Islington Staff Enclosure, Open Access\r\n(Section 133).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=133.= Lending library barriers for open access are planned in a variety\r\nof ways to take charging trays, etc. The following are typical\r\nillustrations of barriers or combined counters and screens specially\r\ndesigned for open access libraries. The object of the glazed screen is\r\nto protect the staff from draughts and the charging system from being\r\ntampered with. The plans and views of open access barriers in Figs.\r\n24-25 show the usual arrangement for ordinary purposes, and an imaginary\r\ndesign for a library doing a very large business requiring three\r\nassistants at each side is shown in Fig. 28. By means of this it would\r\nbe possible for six assistants, three at each side, to discharge and\r\ncharge books at the rate of 1400 per hour, a speed never required\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes a barrier with two wickets on the entrance\r\nside and one at the exit will serve for the largest single library in\r\nexistence (Fig. 27). The treadle latches such as are fitted in the open\r\naccess libraries of Croydon, Clerkenwell, Hornsey, Lambeth, Darwen,\r\nSouthport, etc., will be found well adapted for the purpose of\r\ncontrolling the wickets of both single and double open access barriers\r\n(Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Lambeth (Herne Hill) Branch Library Open Access\r\nBarrier (Section 133).]\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to wickets hinged at one side is their tendency to\r\nslam, no matter what kind of controlling springs or buffers are used. In\r\ncourse of time every form of pneumatic or other spring loses its power,\r\nand some effective form of noiseless turnstile or very light barrier on\r\nrising butts would perhaps be an improvement. Where lending libraries\r\nare isolated, the trouble is not so marked as in cases where they adjoin\r\nreading rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n=134.= The plans already printed (Figs. 18-22) explain better than words\r\nthe form of counters best adapted for lending libraries using the\r\nindicator system of issue.\r\n\r\nThe space for borrowers in front of an indicator ought not to be less\r\nthan four square feet per person likely to be present at one time, in\r\norder to prevent crowding at busy times. Thus a town with 3000 borrowers\r\nwould have an average daily issue of about 300 volumes, which might\r\nmean seventy-five people present at one time, counting companions, and\r\nthus 300 square feet of borrowers’ lobby would be necessary as a\r\nminimum; or a space 30 by 10 feet. It is not often, however, that one\r\nfinds lobbies planned on this desirable scale. The height of a counter\r\ndesigned to carry an indicator should not exceed thirty inches, and the\r\ntop need not be more than eighteen inches wide. The length of the\r\ncounter will depend entirely upon the kind of indicator used, and\r\nwhether it is classified or not, or intended for all the stock or only\r\nfor fiction. The indicators most used all differ in size (see Section\r\n386, etc.), and this factor must be taken into account in designing the\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Croydon Central Library. Open Access Lending\r\nDepartment, showing Double Wickets (Section 133).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=135.= Sometimes a simple barrier is required in some kinds of reference\r\nlibraries to separate bookcases from reading rooms. This may be either\r\nfixed or movable, and a good form can be constructed of ornamental\r\nironwork, surmounted by a polished oak or walnut rail, about four to six\r\ninches wide, in the style of illustration (Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Triple Open-Access Barrier (Section 133).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=136. Screens.=--In small libraries with a small staff it is often\r\npossible to obtain complete oversight of nearly every department by\r\nusing glazed partitions or screens instead of opaque internal walls. In\r\ncases where there is no roof weight to be supported this is a very good\r\narrangement, and is recommended for every building to which it can be\r\napplied. When such partitions separate rooms, it is advisable to carry\r\nthem right up to the ceiling to exclude noise. In other situations, as\r\nwhen dividing a room into two or more sections, the screens need not be\r\nmore than eight or nine feet high. Clear glass should be used\r\nthroughout, unless in the upper panels, for the sake of both oversight\r\nand light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Treadle Latch for Open Access Wicket (Section\r\n133).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Barrier for Dividing Rooms (Section 135).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=137. Lifts.=--In large libraries with many floors, passenger or other\r\nlifts for carrying heavy weights are desirable. In a building with two\r\nor more floors, an ordinary lift for transporting parcels of books to\r\nthe extent of perhaps two hundredweights should be provided in a\r\nconvenient place, preferably against a wall. Such lifts should have\r\nautomatic brakes and simple raising and lowering mechanism; but an\r\nelectric motor will be found less noisy and easier to work than any\r\nform of rope lift. In addition, it is often of greater service to have\r\nsmall, quick-running lifts or tubes capable of carrying one to six\r\nsingle books from floor to floor. In cases where lending library books\r\nare issued for reading in the reading room, this is a very convenient\r\narrangement, and it also greatly facilitates the work of the staff by\r\nenabling messages and small articles to be rapidly transferred from\r\nplace to place.\r\n\r\n\r\n=138. Speaking Tubes and Telephones.=--Speaking tubes connecting every\r\ndepartment should be provided in all new buildings, if telephones have\r\nnot already been fixed. The telephone is much easier applied to an\r\nexisting building, as there is less cutting about of walls required. But\r\nin new buildings speaking tubes can be provided quite easily, and they\r\nare simpler to work and less liable to get out of order than telephones.\r\nThe telephone should be provided for every large public library, which\r\nought to be connected with the municipal offices, the telephone exchange\r\nand its own branches. It is often possible for a public library to\r\nobtain a sufficient service by having a wire from the town hall\r\nswitchboard to the library. The annual cost of this is only about\r\none-fourth of the regular exchange service. For a complicated internal\r\nservice of inter-communications, the telephone is much superior to\r\nspeaking tubes, as the switchboard system enables the user to\r\ncommunicate with any department without the need of extra tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=139. Miscellaneous.=--In some libraries accommodation for CYCLES is\r\nprovided outside the buildings, which is the proper place for such\r\nmachines, in view of their tendency to do damage when placed against\r\ninterior walls. In buildings which front busy main streets this kind of\r\naccommodation cannot be provided unless there is a courtyard or similar\r\nspace in front. Some libraries which are infested by DOGS would be all\r\nthe better of some effective means of keeping such animals outside. No\r\ndoubt, if their owners were spoken to, they would agree to fasten them\r\nto hooks or rails outside the building, if proper means were provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n=140.= TURNSTILES for counting purposes are fitted up in several\r\nlibraries, as well as in most museums, art galleries, etc. They should\r\nbe placed in situations where their noisy clacking will not prove\r\ndisturbing, if they are used at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n=141.= Good English CLOCKS, with conspicuous dials, should be placed in\r\nevery public room of a library. Where a number are provided, it is\r\nbetter to specify electrically controlled or synchronized clocks, which\r\nkeep uniform time and are much less troublesome than ordinary self-wound\r\nclocks. Libraries should have a supply of small THERMOMETERS\r\ndistributed and fixed throughout the rooms as a check upon the internal\r\ntemperature, and it is a useful thing to provide a barometer as well.\r\nBold visible CALENDARS are also desirable in every department.\r\n\r\n\r\n=142= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Brown, J.

All authorities on library architecture are agreed that\r\nhigh shelves are an obstruction to quick service, and a danger to books,\r\nby placing them in a vitiated atmosphere with a comparatively high\r\ntemperature. The old-fashioned wall-cases, twelve or fifteen feet high,\r\nwhich could only be reached by means of long ladders, are no longer\r\nrecommended or installed, because of the labour they place upon the\r\nstaff, their danger, and the fact that all the books on the upper\r\nshelves are not only inaccessible, but liable to a certain amount of\r\nharm. Modern librarians prefer to enlarge their floor area for the\r\npurpose of book-storage, and to provide wall and standard bookcases\r\nwhich are within easy reach of the floor, thus placing the entire stock\r\nat the command of both staff and readers without the labour or danger of\r\nclimbing long ladders. It may be said, generally, that high wall-shelves\r\nshould never be provided, unless with the provision of an iron gallery\r\nhalf-way up, which can be reached by means of stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=144.= The question of adjustability is just as important as\r\nget-at-ability. In every method or appliance which is introduced for\r\nlibrary, or, indeed, any other work, the great principle of movability\r\nor adjustability should be preferred to fixity. The power of moving or\r\nchanging without altering the character or shape of anything is of\r\nenormous advantage in every operation, and a very good illustration of\r\nthe application of this power is furnished by the card catalogue, with\r\nits infinite capacity for expansion in every direction. Book-shelves\r\nshould be as mobile as cards in their own way, and should be so\r\nadjustable that a new shelf can be introduced or an existing one removed\r\nat any point where such a course is possible. The only advantage which\r\nfixed wooden shelves possess is that of comparative cheapness, but this\r\nis an advantage which, in a short time, is completely swallowed up in\r\nthe inconveniences which arise through the impossibility of placing\r\nbooks of varying sizes in strict classified order on the shelves.\r\nBesides a great sacrifice of vertical space in some places, it will be\r\nfound in a rapidly growing library that the carefully gauged shelves, at\r\neight, nine, ten, or twelve inches apart, in every tier, cannot be made\r\nto contain all the books which ought to go on these shelves in their\r\norder. The day comes when the eight-and-a-half or nine-and-a-half inch\r\nbook arrives which must go on the eight or nine inch shelf, and, because\r\nthere is no means of making a slight adjustment, such books must either\r\nbe shelved out of their order, or placed on their fore-edges. If such\r\nshelves are arranged throughout a library at a distance of ten inches\r\napart to provide for contingencies, they will take all sizes up to demy\r\n8vo, but at a great sacrifice of space, especially in the fiction\r\nshelves, where most of the books average about seven and a half inches.\r\nAny attempt at varying the distances between shelves in every tier will\r\nlead to confusion in a strictly classified library. On the other hand,\r\nliberal spacing will result in the loss of a shelf in every tier,\r\nthereby reducing the total storage space by about one-eighth or\r\none-ninth, according to the number of shelves in a tier. The balance of\r\nadvantage lies, with movable forms of shelving, and it is strongly\r\nrecommended that no other kind be specified or ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=145.= The following diagrams give the usual dimensions for ordinary\r\nstandard and wall bookcases, and may be taken as the unit from which a\r\nlibrary stack can be built up according to any plan of arrangement. Fig.\r\n31 represents a double-sized standard iron bookcase, 7 feet 6 inches × 3\r\nfeet 2 inches × 15 inches, which can be joined end to end to form cases\r\nof any length, or used in halves to form cases against walls.\r\n\r\nExactly the same dimensions can be used with wooden presses fitted with\r\nadjustable brackets or catches. In reference libraries the dimensions\r\nmay be slightly varied, as the average book which must be stored is\r\nrather larger than in lending libraries. But the chief provision for\r\nfolio and large quarto books should be in special cases arranged round\r\nthe walls, and it is well to have presses intended for music and quartos\r\nfitted with uprights about eighteen inches apart, in order to\r\ndistribute the weight of the books and facilitate their handling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Double Bay Standard Metal Bookcase (Section\r\n145)].\r\n\r\n\r\n=146.= For standard reference cases the unit of size should be 7 feet 6\r\ninches × 3 feet 2 inches × 18 inches. Special wall-cases should be the\r\nsame height, but should have an arrangement for large books in the form\r\nof a ledged base projecting at least six inches from the front of the\r\nupper part of the case, about three feet above the floor (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n\r\n=147. Adjustable Shelf Fittings.=--The old-fashioned varieties of shelf\r\nadjustments for wooden bookcases, such as pegs fitting into holes\r\ndrilled in the uprights, one and a half or two inches apart, wooden or\r\nmetal ratchets for carrying bars or rods for supporting the shelves, and\r\nsimilar devices, may be dismissed as unsuitable for modern library\r\npurposes. The best-known adjustment is that known as Tonks’, from the\r\nname of its patentee. It consists of metal strips, with perforations at\r\ninch intervals, let into grooves in the uprights, and designed to carry\r\nthe shelves on four metal studs or catches, which engage in the slots or\r\nperforations. This method requires very careful fitting, as the grooves\r\nin the woodwork must be deep and smooth enough to admit the catches, and\r\neach metal strip must be accurately inserted so that the slots will come\r\nlevel not only with those adjoining, but with those on the opposite\r\nupright. The least carelessness in fitting will cause shelves to rock\r\nand buckle, because not supported by catches all at one level. The\r\nillustration on page 145 (Fig. 33) will show exactly the form of this\r\nfitting. It consists of: shelf supported on standard; perforated metal\r\nslip and stud; and groove in wooden standard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Wooden Wall Case with Lodged Base (Section\r\n146).]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this variety of shelf fitting does not give\r\nabsolute adjustability, but only a movement of about an inch up or down,\r\nas may be required. Smaller adjustments are impossible by this or any\r\nother similar system.\r\n\r\n\r\n=148.= There are various other methods of fixed shelf adjustments for\r\nwooden bookcases, English, American and German, but none of them possess\r\nany particular advantage over Tonks’ variety.\r\n\r\nAbsolute adjustability in shelf fittings, as applied to wooden cases,\r\nhas been obtained in the English method, to be seen at various libraries\r\nin England. There are also various American systems.\r\n\r\nBoth of these forms are similar in principle to the absolute adjustments\r\ndescribed under Section 149, but the English system was the first to be\r\npatented, and therefore ranks as the pioneer of this type of shelf\r\nfitting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Wooden Shelf Adjustment (Section 147).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=149. Metal Bookcases with Absolute Shelf Adjustments.=--The best and\r\nmost used English variety of metal bookcase with absolute shelf\r\nadjustment is that which has been installed in the public libraries of\r\nWorcester, Shoreditch, Huddersfield, Lambeth, Perth, the Patent Office\r\nLibrary, London, Islington and elsewhere. It consists, as shown in Figs.\r\n31, 34 and 35, of strong steel uprights, in which are formed continuous\r\ngrooves, which carry and support shelf brackets designed to grip at any\r\npoint by automatic means. These brackets will slide up and down the\r\nuprights to any point, while a small controlling lever is depressed, but\r\nthe moment this is released the bracket will become firmly fixed in\r\nplace, and will remain there till again moved, whatever weight may be\r\nplaced upon the shelf which it supports. These brackets can be pushed up\r\nwithout touching the controlling lever, and will always grip at the\r\npoint where they are left. To push them down, the controlling arm must\r\nbe depressed as already described. The shelves for this type of case may\r\nbe either metal or wood, but probably good oak shelves will be found as\r\nsatisfactory as any. Standard cases made in the dimensions given in\r\nSection 145 are usually divided down the middle, at the back of each set\r\nof shelves, by means of a wire-work grill. This does not obstruct\r\noversight, light or air, yet serves to prevent books on one face of the\r\nstandard from being accidentally or otherwise transferred to the\r\nopposite face. There are points of safety, convenience and adjustability\r\nabout metal bookcases which make them preferable to all other forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Details of Lambert’s Adjustable Metal Shelving\r\n(Section 149).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=150.= A special form of this type of metal bookcase has been designed\r\nfor book-storage in small spaces, and as applied to the India Office\r\nLibrary, London, and Bodleian Library, Oxford, has been found convenient\r\nand economical. The same shelf adjustment is used, but the presses\r\ninstead of resting on the floor are swung from iron girders, so as to\r\nslide easily whenever wanted. These presses are swung closely side by\r\nside and drawn out, one at a time, as required.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar plan for increasing the storage capacity was\r\nintroduced into the British Museum many years ago, the chief difference\r\nbeing that the sliding presses go face to face with the existing\r\nstandards, one here and there, instead of in solid rows as at the India\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Metal Shelving, Patent Office Library, London\r\n(Section 149).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=151.= It is not proposed to describe every variety of iron or metal\r\nbookcase which has been introduced, such as the Library Bureau, Smith,\r\nLawrence, Cotgreave, etc., and it will be sufficient to mention that in\r\nBritain, Germany and America there are several interesting forms used.\r\n\r\n\r\n=152. Special Bookcases.=--In Section 146 a form of special wall-case is\r\ndescribed which is suitable for storing folio and quarto volumes. In\r\nvery large libraries it may be necessary to provide additional storage\r\nspace for bound files of newspapers, extra large folios and prints.\r\nFiles of newspapers can be stored in a special form of double rack, as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 36. As small libraries will bind only the files of\r\nlocal papers, the provision by them of shelves for this purpose need not\r\nbe a very serious matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=153.= Large folio volumes are best kept flat on sliding trays or\r\nshelves. When they are kept upright they are very apt to suffer through\r\nthe heavy leaves sagging and dragging at the binding. Valuable folios\r\nshould always be kept in flat positions. A suitable method of storage is\r\nto provide a large double-sided case, with a sloping top, which can be\r\nused for consulting the books. The shelves should be arranged to slide\r\nout and in on runners, and each shelf may have a brass handle on its\r\nfore-edge to enable it to be easily pulled out. The dimensions of such a\r\ncase will depend upon the number of folios to be stored and their size,\r\nbut the following illustration (Fig. 37) will be found suitable for all\r\nordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Rack for Bound Newspapers (Section 152).]\r\n\r\nThis case will store about 150 to 200 folio volumes, according to their\r\nthickness, which is ample space for all ordinary municipal public\r\nlibraries. The shelves of this case should be covered on their upper\r\nsurfaces with leather or thick cloth. A similar style of rack can be\r\nused for storing large collections of prints, the only difference being\r\nthat the prints would be kept in special boxes as described in Section\r\n307, which would take the place of volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=154.= In calculating the number of volumes which can be shelved in a\r\ngiven space, the following general rules will be found fairly\r\naccurate:--\r\n\r\n  Nine lending library books will occupy one foot run of space.\r\n\r\n  Eight reference library books will occupy one foot run of space.\r\n\r\nAllowance must be made, in calculating from plans, for the space\r\noccupied by uprights, etc., and care must be taken to reckon dwarf\r\nbookcases only according to their capacity. If nine inches are allowed\r\nas the average height of books, which will give eight shelves to a tier\r\nseven feet six inches high, excluding cornices, plinth or thickness of\r\nshelves, then a single-sided case of the dimensions shown in Section 146\r\nwill store 216 volumes in a lending library and about 192 in a reference\r\nlibrary. A double-sided case will hold 432 and 384 volumes respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Section and Elevation of Case for Large Folio\r\nBooks (Section 153).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=155. Racks for Filing.=--Wooden racks or iron-pipe racks may be used\r\nfor a variety of purposes, such as storing unbound newspapers and\r\nperiodicals, pamphlets, and all kinds of loose papers or bundles. Such\r\nracks are best made in a light, open form, so as to reduce the\r\ncollection of dust to a minimum, while admitting air and light freely.\r\n\r\n\r\n=156. Galleries.=--Galleries of iron are sometimes added to reference\r\nlibraries and in other departments to provide a means of reaching high\r\nwall-shelves, and also to give additional accommodation for storage.\r\nThey are a feature of the large stack rooms of American libraries,\r\nwherein the books are all massed together, gallery above gallery and\r\ntier above tier. Unless there is some very strong reason, architectural\r\nor otherwise, galleries should be avoided in every public library where\r\nrapid service of readers is necessary. Save for storing little-used\r\nstock, galleries are not recommended in any situation, unless the\r\npressure for book space is very great. When galleries must be provided,\r\ncare should be taken to provide adequate approaches. If a straight\r\nstaircase is out of the question, a circular iron one should be\r\nprovided, wide enough to enable an assistant to go up or down\r\ncomfortably with an armful of books. In some libraries the circular iron\r\nstaircases are more like exaggerated corkscrews than proper means of\r\ngetting up and down from a gallery or floor. It is much better to have\r\nstairways in a single flight, which will allow of two persons passing\r\neach other, and for this purpose they ought to be at least three feet\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nIn libraries with bookcases of the uniform height of seven feet six\r\ninches, long ladders will be unnecessary, but in cases where they must\r\nbe used, step ladders are preferable to rung ones. A light form of step\r\nladder which is used in many public libraries and shops is illustrated\r\n(Fig. 38). For all practical purposes this ladder will be found ample.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Lattice-work Steps (Section 156).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Short Steps for Low Shelves (Section 156).]\r\n\r\nShort steps for enabling the upper shelves of seven foot six inch cases\r\nto be scanned easily are made in various forms, some being folding and\r\nothers fixed. The variety as illustrated (Fig. 39) will be found useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Continuous Wooden Step and Handles, Hornsey\r\nCentral Library (Section 157).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=157.= In some open access libraries it has been found advisable, in\r\ncases where the top shelves are out of reach, to provide a continuous\r\nfixed step of wood or iron at the base of each bookcase, to enable\r\nreaders to reach the upper shelves without using movable steps of the\r\nsort figured above. A strong, wide iron rail projecting about four\r\ninches or six inches from the case, about nine inches or twelve inches\r\nabove the ground, has been found useful, especially when associated with\r\na handle fastened to the upright at a convenient height above. The\r\nillustration (Fig. 40) will give an idea of such a continuous step and\r\nhandle applied in wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Spring Step for Bookcases (Section 158).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=158.= Detached steps secured to the uprights of bookcases, combined\r\nwith handles, are very often used for staff purposes in place of the\r\nordinary movable wooden steps or ladders. There is one form with an\r\nautomatic adjustment which enables the step to spring up flat against\r\nthe upright out of the way when not wanted as figured in illustration\r\n(Fig. 41). It is not necessary to fit this into the uprights, and to\r\ncut away the woodwork in order to let it into its place. There is still\r\nanother variety, used at Hull, Kilmarnock, etc., which is always in\r\nposition for use, but which also possesses an automatic adjustment\r\nenabling it to be brushed aside harmlessly by anyone passing, and to\r\nreturn to its “ready” position at once. This form can be attached to any\r\nordinary wooden upright by means of screws, without cutting away or\r\nfitting. The handle supplied with this has a superior shape and grip\r\n(Fig. 42).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Swinging Step and Improved Handle (Section\r\n158).]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFURNITURE\r\n\r\n\r\n=159.= The effect of shabby fittings and furniture on the minds of\r\nvisitors is not such as will tend to the promotion of discipline, nor\r\nwill it instil respect for the library into the minds of ratepayers and\r\nreaders. A fine building, appropriately fitted up, will not only impress\r\nthe average visitor, but it will cause the citizens to take pride in the\r\nlibrary as a civic institution. A fine building shabbily fitted up\r\ninside will probably have quite a different effect. While a strong\r\ndistinction is to be drawn between luxury and propriety in such matters,\r\na much better purpose will be served by procuring good and substantial\r\nfittings and furniture than by wasting on extravagant exteriors most of\r\nthe money available for building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Two-sided Desk Topped Table (Section 160).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=160. Reading Tables.=--For general reading rooms the tables should not\r\nbe too long, nor, if readers are to sit on both sides, too narrow. A\r\ntable to accommodate, say, eight persons, four on each side, should be\r\n8 feet long × 3 feet wide × 32 inches high. The rails of reading-room\r\ntables should not be made so deep as to interfere with the comfort of\r\npersons using them, and cross rails connecting the table legs near the\r\nfloor level should never be used, as these only serve as foot-rests. A\r\ncertain number of tables should be made with desk or sloping tops, as\r\nshown in illustration (Fig. 43). Oak, walnut or other hard woods should\r\nbe used for library furniture. Pitch pine is not recommended, as it\r\ninvariably splits as the resin dries out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--British Museum Reading Table with Desk and Rack\r\n(Section 161).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Reference Room Table (Section 161).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=161.= In reference libraries, especially in those designed for students\r\nwith open access to the shelves, quite a liberal space should be\r\nallowed. It has not hitherto been the practice, save in large libraries\r\nlike the British Museum, to give reference readers as much table room\r\nas is desirable, nor to give students the amount of isolation which they\r\nrequire. The general policy has been to seat readers at long tables and\r\nseparate them from their opposite neighbours by means of a screen, as is\r\ndone at the British Museum, and in libraries like the Cornell\r\nUniversity, Ithaca, New York. This method, which is depicted in Fig. 44,\r\ngives a certain amount of seclusion, but it does not provide a\r\nsufficiency of room for books and materials. Then, of course, no\r\nmunicipal library can hope to compete with the British Museum in the\r\nprovision of expensive furniture. To ensure that each student reader\r\nwill obtain a liberal share of room, combined with comfort and\r\nisolation, a system of separate tables in the form illustrated (Fig. 45)\r\nis strongly recommended, or some way which will secure the same\r\naccommodation. The plan of making the table the unit of space instead\r\nof the readers will automatically solve the problem of how much room to\r\ngive each reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Periodical Rack on Elevated Platform (Section\r\n162).]\r\n\r\nThe table illustrated (Fig. 45) gives the following accommodation:--\r\n\r\n  Six square feet of free table-top with a sunk ink-well.\r\n\r\n  A back board six inches or nine inches high to prevent overlooking by\r\n  neighbours, and provide space for ruler and pen racks, shelves, clips,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  A sloping writing desk can be added if required.\r\n\r\n  Shelves under the table for holding extra books, materials or an\r\n  overcoat.\r\n\r\n  An extension slide to pull out and form a book-rest or supplementary\r\n  table for papers.\r\n\r\n  In addition, if space permits, an umbrella holder can be fitted to the\r\n  left-hand support of the table, so that each reader will be isolated\r\n  and self-contained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=162. Periodicals, Tables and Racks.=--The question of the methods of\r\ndisplaying periodicals and magazines is discussed in Chapter XXXI., and\r\nit is not necessary to consider the matter of policy here. Various kinds\r\nof tables have been designed for displaying magazines in covers in a\r\nfixed place, and for simply enabling them to be easily read in the\r\nordinary way. Where periodicals are kept in racks, tables in the forms\r\ndescribed in Section 160 will be found sufficient. In cases where the\r\ntables have to perform the combined function of racks and tables, other\r\narrangements are necessary. There are many forms of rack-table, but only\r\nthree need be described. The first, which is used in several large\r\nlibraries, provides a large elevated rack above the table-top, on which\r\nthe periodicals are placed, so as to free as much as possible of the\r\ntable surface for readers. This is illustrated (Fig. 46).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Periodical Rack on Table Top (Section 163).]\r\n\r\nIn this form of table-rack the periodicals are not fastened to their\r\nplaces, and, owing to the varied sizes of the periodicals in an elevated\r\nposition, they give a somewhat untidy appearance to a room.\r\n\r\n\r\n=163.= A less conspicuous form, and one equally effective, dispenses\r\nwith the elevated platform, and the rack simply rests upon the table-top\r\nas illustrated (Fig. 47). If necessary, the periodicals can be fastened\r\nto the rack by means of cords or chains encased in rubber or leathern\r\nthongs, and the contents of each table can be displayed upon an\r\nadjustable titles list in the form described in Section 474, fastened to\r\nthe ends of the rack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Reading Table with Partition for Titles\r\n(Section 164).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=164.= A remarkably effective form of periodical table, which has a\r\nseparate place and title for each, is shown in Fig. 48.\r\n\r\nThis makes effective division between readers seated on opposite sides\r\nof the table, and tends to prevent conversation and the interchange of\r\nperiodicals. The periodicals can be fixed by means of chains or cords\r\nif thought necessary. At Wolverhampton, Islington, Hammersmith, Croydon\r\nand other places this plan of “tethering” magazines is adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=165.= Periodical racks are made in a large variety of forms, and the\r\nfollowing illustrations are typical of most of the devices used (Figs.\r\n49 and 50). Another kind often seen is the “Cotgreave.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Periodical Rack with Magazines Resting on\r\nNarrow Shelf (Section 162).]\r\n\r\nA smaller rack for railway time-tables is illustrated on p. 162 (Fig.\r\n51).\r\n\r\n\r\n=166. Reading Easels.=--In connexion with these special tables,\r\nbook-stands or easels for keeping a number of books open at once will be\r\nfound useful. It often happens that a student desires to compare his\r\nauthorities, and an easy means of keeping several books open at a given\r\nplace is necessary. The book easels shown below are the best form yet\r\ndevised. Fig. 52, which is made entirely of metal, has the advantage of\r\nleaving the table surface practically free and unobstructed, while the\r\nautomatic means provided for keeping books open at any place,\r\nirrespective of the number of leaves, is of great utility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Rack for Odd or Occasional Periodicals,\r\nFinsbury Public Library (Section 165).]\r\n\r\nFig. 53, constructed of wood, is also a light useful article, but as it\r\nrests the book close to the table surface more obstruction is caused,\r\nwhile the leaf-holders are not automatically adjusting.\r\n\r\nThere are various other forms of wooden reading easels, but they are\r\nlight articles designed to fold up, and will not carry large reference\r\nbooks with any great degree of security.\r\n\r\n\r\n=167. Chairs.=--There is such an immense variety of library chairs that\r\nthe chief difficulty becomes that of selection. A strong chair with a\r\nsaddle seat fixed to a special rail instead of direct to the legs is\r\nbest, and in all ordinary situations arm-chairs are preferable, as they\r\ngive an automatic spacing of elbow-room which renders calculation\r\nunnecessary. It is wise, however, to avoid a very wide arm-chair, and to\r\nuse small chairs only if space is limited to two feet per reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Railway Time-table Rack (Section 165).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Metal Reading Easel (Section 166).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Wooden Reading Easel (Section 166).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=168.= Where the space between tables is very restricted the chairs\r\nshould be fastened to the floor, so that there can be no blocking of\r\ngangways. One plan is that adopted at the Mitchell Library, Glasgow,\r\nNorth Library, Fulham, and elsewhere, of having revolving arm-chairs\r\nmounted on pedestals secured to the floor. These have the one great\r\ndisadvantage of being non-adjustable. Readers cannot pull them a little\r\nforward or push them back, and thus such fixed chairs have the defect of\r\nall fixed things--they cannot be moved to suit varying conditions.\r\nAnother form for a crowded situation is a small strong chair of good\r\ndesign anchored to the floor by means of a stout cord (Fig. 54). Each\r\nchair has a stout staple screwed under the seat in the centre, and a\r\nsimilar staple is screwed into the floor at a suitable distance from the\r\ntable front, and corresponding in situation with the staple in the chair\r\nseat when placed in position. Lengths of stout window cord are then cut\r\nand provided with swivel hooks at either end, which are fastened to the\r\nstaples on the floor and on the seat, allowing a sufficient length of\r\ncord to admit of a fair amount of play and movement when anchored. On\r\ngranolithic or other cement or concrete floors, fixed chairs cannot be\r\nused readily.\r\n\r\nThis kind of anchorage allows of a chair being moved backwards, forwards\r\nor sideways, and readers can get to and from their seats without\r\ntrouble. Arm-chairs are not recommended for this style of fastening.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of chairs should be shod with rubber or leather pads to deaden\r\nthe noise of movement on the floor. There are several varieties of such\r\npads to be obtained from furnishing firms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Chair with Anchorage Attachment (Section 168).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=169.= Hat rails of metal or wood are sometimes provided under all\r\nchairs--a very necessary provision in wet weather. The Continental\r\nsystem of uncovering the head when entering public buildings is not yet\r\nvery common in the United Kingdom, but readers should certainly be\r\nencouraged to do so by having the means of bestowing their headgear\r\nplaced easily at hand. General hat, coat and umbrella stands or racks\r\nare not popular in public libraries, and need not, as a rule, be\r\nprovided. But some kind of hat and umbrella holders should certainly be\r\nprovided in connexion with the chairs. A very good combination arm-chair\r\nis shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 55). This provides hat\r\nand umbrella accommodation, and may also have attached to the left, or\r\nboth arms, a folding wire-work drop holder, in which to place completed\r\npapers, light books or other articles not wanted to litter the table-top\r\n(Fig. 56). Of course, such chairs with these additional accessories\r\ncould only be used in situations where there was plenty of room. In many\r\ncases umbrella rails are attached to every table, and this is usually\r\nthe best plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n=170.= Every library should buy more chairs than are required. This will\r\nenable the chairs to be removed for cleaning purposes in batches of a\r\ndozen or more, their places being taken by the spare ones. This will\r\nprevent the seating accommodation from being reduced during any cleaning\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=171. Desks.=--For staff purposes ordinary school desks will be found\r\nample. These are provided with side flaps and a locking compartment. A\r\nCanadian form with shelves and a lock-up desk flap, with pigeon holes,\r\nsuitable for going against a wall, is a useful type of desk for\r\nassistants doing a special class of work, as the desk flap can be locked\r\nback out of the way, and so protect the papers or work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Chair with Hat Rail and Umbrella Holder\r\n(Section 169).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Chair with Folding Tray or Shelf (Section\r\n169).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=172.= For large libraries, where an elevated superintendent’s desk is\r\nnecessary, the combined desk and drawer cabinet used in the Mitchell\r\nLibrary, Glasgow, has many advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n=173. Lecture Room.=--Furniture and fittings for children’s departments\r\nand lecture rooms require special consideration. The former are dealt\r\nwith in Division XIII. In the lecture room the principal fittings are\r\nthe platform and the fittings connected with the use of the lantern.\r\nPlatforms should be wide, and should be as long as it is possible to\r\nmake them having regard to economy of space in the room. A height of\r\nthree feet is suitable, and the structure should be solid, so that it\r\nmay not echo or squeak beneath the tread, and a covering of some\r\nsound-deadening material--thick cork-lino or cocoanut-matting--is\r\ndesirable. A counter or fixed table running along the front has been\r\nfound useful, and to this water, gas, and similar fittings may be\r\nconnected for use in science lectures; but this counter is not usually\r\nrequired, and it may obstruct the screen and will certainly prevent the\r\nuse of the platform for dramatic and similar representations for which a\r\nclear stage is necessary. Green baize hangings as a background and front\r\ncurtains of this material are very effective for several purposes. The\r\nplatform should so be placed that it can be reached by the lecturers\r\nwithout the necessity of passing through the audience.\r\n\r\nFor lantern screen there is nothing better than a smooth wall finished\r\noff in flat white, but where this is impossible a rigid is preferable to\r\na rolling screen as giving a surface free from folds and kinks. Screens\r\nshould be kept perfectly clean, as dirt injures the effect of slides\r\nincalculably. The lantern itself should be of the electric arc variety,\r\nas being easy to manage and always ready with little delay, especially\r\nwhere the “direct” electric current is available. It is best installed\r\nin a room outside, or a gallery closed in from, the lecture room, the\r\nprojection being made through an opening. An electric signal which\r\nprovides at the platform a push for the use of the lecturer, and sounds\r\na “buzzer” or flashes a small lamp in the operator’s apartment, is\r\nprobably the best form of lantern signal.\r\n\r\nThe chairs in lecture rooms should be as comfortable as means will\r\nallow, and should be fitted with rubber tips to ensure quiet. Quiet\r\nfloor coverings should be used in the room, and, indeed, all fittings\r\nand furniture should produce that ease of body which will allow the mind\r\nto occupy itself exclusively with what is going on upon the platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION VI\r\n\r\nBOOK SELECTION AND ACCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBOOK SELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=174. General Principles.=--Although a great number of articles and\r\npapers have been written upon the subject of book selection, there still\r\nseems room for some remarks upon the general question from a standpoint\r\nsomewhat different from the ordinary. Most of the articles which have\r\ncome under notice deal with the mere routine of book selection--how to\r\nsystematize the ordering of books; the work connected with preparing\r\nthem for public use; the bibliographical side; the question of\r\nduplicating popular books; and other more or less mechanical aspects of\r\nthe matter. The philosophy of book selection and questions connected\r\nwith the policy of building up libraries have rarely been considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=175. The first point which occurs is the connexion between a library’s\r\nincome and its book-purchasing power. As, by law established, most\r\nBritish library incomes are strictly limited, it follows that a similar\r\nlimitation must govern the supply of books, and that only a _selection_\r\nof new books can be procured, old and out-of-print books taking their\r\nchance. The very largest rate-supported libraries are bound by this\r\nlimitation to buy only a selection from the immense mass of books\r\nannually published, and, even if such purchases amount to several\r\nthousands of volumes, they represent only a _selection_. The smaller\r\nlibraries must of necessity make a selection within a selection, and it\r\nfollows that, in all cases of libraries supported by small incomes or\r\nburdened by heavy charges for the repayment of loans or other purposes,\r\nthe selection must be carefully made if it is to be representative of\r\nall that is best in ancient and modern literature. Another factor which\r\nenters into the matter need only be mentioned in order to be dismissed:\r\nthat is the obvious unsuitability of a very large proportion of the\r\nbooks annually published because of their form (pamphlets and tracts),\r\nsubject-matter (school-books, bibles, etc.), or special nature (local\r\nlists, reissues, directories, etc.).\r\n\r\n\r\n=176.= The fund available in most public libraries for the purchase of\r\nbooks can be made the basis for a rough calculation showing at what rate\r\nlibraries of different sizes should grow. By reference to the tables in\r\nSection 31 it will be found that the sum which can be annually expended\r\non books is limited in libraries of all sizes, and that the annual\r\nadditions must of necessity follow the same limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=177.= The annual production of new publications in the United Kingdom\r\nmay be taken at about 10,620 volumes, including everything, and the\r\nnumber of new books in this total may be averaged at about 8300 volumes.\r\nIt will thus be seen that the British municipal libraries must be\r\n_selectors_ rather than _collectors_ of books, because the income of no\r\none of them is equal to buying more than a proportion of the 8300 new\r\nbooks published annually in Britain alone. Some English public\r\nlibraries, because of their accumulations of old, useless and effete\r\nbooks, resemble gardens choked with weeds; and their efficiency is\r\nclogged by the necessity for storing and caring for books which are of\r\nno value or interest. The presence of such books in a modern library\r\nhinders effective use and administration, because they occupy space\r\nurgently wanted for more useful modern books; they add enormously to the\r\ncost of cataloguing and charging; and in other ways they use up the\r\nresources of the library without adding to its public utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n=178.= It may be taken as a somewhat strong statement, that there are\r\nnot more than 50,000 books, excluding duplicates of popular works and\r\nthose in more than one volume, worthy of preservation in any public\r\nmunicipal library. The truth is that, of real, living works of literary\r\nand human interest, there are perhaps not more than 20,000 in the\r\nEnglish language, but the larger figure is preferred in order to cover\r\nthe world’s literary output fully. Let anyone who doubts this try to\r\ncompile a list of even 5000 books of permanent literary or other\r\ninterest, in order to find what a difficult task it is. No doubt the\r\ndifficulty of selection is the main reason why some public libraries\r\ngrow up in a haphazard way, because it is a work which demands not only\r\npersevering industry, but an encyclopædic knowledge of literature and\r\nthe contents of books. Nevertheless, this difficulty of selection, and\r\nthe limitation of the field of selection, are powerful reasons why\r\nmunicipal libraries should abandon the museum or storage ideal, and go\r\nboldly for making the workshop or practical utility ideal the one most\r\nworthy of realization. In Chapter VIII. it has already been pointed out\r\nto what extent British libraries have fostered indiscriminate\r\ncollecting, often at the expense of efficiency, while the workshop plan\r\nof library has been comparatively neglected. Even if municipal libraries\r\nhad unlimited resources, the wisdom of indiscriminate collecting would\r\nbe doubtful; especially as many special libraries are doing the work.\r\nSpecialization should be the watchword of the future, owing to the\r\nenormous literary activity of recent times, and the branch of\r\nspecialization which public libraries should adopt is careful\r\n_selection_ of books and equally careful _rejection_ of all which have\r\noutlived their day and purpose, or become “dull, stale and\r\nunprofitable.” Public library buildings should be erected, not on the\r\nprinciple of storing as many books as can possibly be collected in fifty\r\nyears’ time, but of restricting the book accommodation to the reasonable\r\nlimits which careful selection and cautious discarding will fix, and\r\nincreasing the space available for readers, and giving them only the\r\nvery best literature, imaginative or instructive, that the world has to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=179.= It is a hazardous undertaking to lay down any particular rules\r\nfor the formation of a British municipal library, and especially to\r\nstate what proportions each class of literature should assume. Equally\r\nfutile is it to take any figure as the average price which each volume\r\nin a library should cost. Although 4s. 5d. has been adopted as an\r\naverage price, this must only be regarded as a mere basis for a\r\ncalculation which simply aims at being a suggestion. Practically every\r\npublic library differs in its needs according to its income and the\r\nspecial industries and character of the people in the town where it is\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\n\r\n=180.= Attempts have been made at various times by different authorities\r\nto lay down the proportions of every class of literature which should be\r\nrepresented in public libraries. The following figures are given for\r\nwhat they are worth, and not by any means as a hard and fast guide to be\r\nfollowed:--\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGES OF CLASSES OF LITERATURE REPRESENTED IN PUBLIC LIBRARIES,\r\nETC.\r\n\r\n  Class 000 General Works                  3\r\n        100 Philosophy                     4\r\n        200 Religion                       5\r\n        300 Sociology                      7\r\n        400 Philology                      4\r\n        500 Science                        9\r\n        600 Useful Arts                    9\r\n        700 Fine and Recreative Arts       7\r\n        800 Literature                    28\r\n        900 History                        8\r\n            Biography                      8\r\n            Travel                         8\r\n                                         ---\r\n                                         100\r\n\r\nThere are one or two changes which modern practice will make probable in\r\nthese percentages, such as increases in the percentages of classes 5-7\r\nand a decrease in class 8. The attention now bestowed upon technical\r\neducation and the universal provision of music texts will almost\r\ninevitably increase these classes at the expense of some other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=181.= Imaginative literature rightly takes first place in the\r\nrepresentation of classes, and when made up of Prose Fiction, Poetry,\r\nMusic and Painting, accounts for about 33 per cent. of the whole.\r\nAlthough Bacon in his classification of human knowledge places\r\nImagination as represented by Poetry at the end of his scheme, thereby,\r\nperhaps, indicating his opinion of its comparative importance, there can\r\nbe no doubt that as regards popularity, importance and longevity it\r\neasily maintains first place in the minds and hearts of a majority of\r\nthe human race. Whose are the great names in literature? The\r\nphilosophers, or historians, or scientists? None of these. The\r\nstory-teller, the song-writer, the singer and the artist completely\r\novershadow all other kinds of literary and scientific genius, and\r\nmonopolize a foremost position of honour among mankind, because, after\r\nall, they are the greatest teachers as well as the most capable\r\nentertainers. Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, Cervantes, Molière,\r\nBalzac, Hugo, Scott, Dickens, Fielding, Thackeray, Burns, Byron, Milton,\r\nBeethoven, Handel, Wagner, Titian, Raphael, Turner, Rembrandt, and so on\r\nin endless variety, are infinitely greater and more treasured names to\r\nthousands of human beings than any of the exponents of more formal and\r\nexact knowledge. The story-teller and the singer will be remembered long\r\nafter philosophies, and systems of history and science are as mouldering\r\nand forgotten as the ruins of ancient Babylon. The great majority of the\r\npeople of all nations will much rather sing with the singers than chop\r\nlogic with the philosophers, and this is at once a reason and\r\njustification for imaginative literature occupying the leading place in\r\nall public libraries. It has become the fashion for a certain section of\r\nlibrarians, a few public men and a considerable number of newspapers, to\r\nlament in doleful accents the popularity and preponderance of fiction\r\nreading in all kinds of lending libraries. But surely Fiction, as the\r\nmost hardy and flourishing form of literary endeavour, which has been\r\nbuilt up by the contributions of some of the greatest minds of all\r\nnations, cannot be denied its rightful place because certain\r\nnarrow-minded persons think it fashionable to denounce the whole policy\r\nof public libraries? Whether they choose to do so or not matters very\r\nlittle, since it is quite evident that imaginative literature is going\r\nto survive, whatever happens, as it has done with extraordinary strength\r\nand vitality, through ages of change and destruction; while\r\nphilosophical, political and social systems have appeared and\r\ndisappeared in endless procession. This is a reason why imaginative\r\nliterature should occupy a foremost place in public libraries, and the\r\ntheory of the survival of the fittest is amply proved by the vitality of\r\nprose fiction, poetry and music, which entitles them to receive the\r\nattention due to their importance in the regard of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=182. Best Books.=--A live library, in addition to the literary classics\r\nin all departments, should only select the best and most popular books.\r\nThe question of selecting only the very best, or only what is in great\r\ndemand, should be compromised by always getting the best, with a\r\nselection of the most popular, subject to the understanding that the\r\nlatter are to be discarded when their day is past. Every movement which\r\nstirs the public mind and imagination produces a great crop of books,\r\nbut only a very small proportion of these survive or are worthy of\r\npreservation. No one can argue against a moderate supply of such works\r\nat the time when public interest is aroused, but objection may be raised\r\nto the more ephemeral books of this kind being preserved long after all\r\ninterest in their subjects has waned. If a municipal library founded in\r\n1750, and steadily collecting for 156 years, could be found, its\r\ncontents would be composed of enormous quantities of dead and forgotten\r\ntheology, history, biography, science, fiction and every other class,\r\nwhich would not excite the slightest interest in the minds of five\r\npersons in a thousand. The skimmings of such a library would no doubt be\r\nvaluable, and a fair proportion of it of interest and use to present-day\r\nreaders, but the bulk of it would be of no practical service to anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=183.= The general public is comparatively indifferent to\r\nbibliographical rarities, and books which are merely curious or scarce\r\nshould not be bought from the present restricted funds of British\r\nmunicipal libraries. There is a certain advantage in making a small\r\nspecial collection, on the museum plan, to trace and illustrate the\r\nevolution and history of printing and book production from the original\r\nmanuscript forms, but the general connection of incunabula and rare\r\nspecimens of typography by modern municipal libraries is neither\r\npossible nor desirable. There is infinitely more wisdom in spending £50\r\nin a selection of modern works on technical subjects, which would be of\r\nimmense service to living persons, than in spending the same amount in\r\nthe purchase of a single rare Bible which will only appeal to a few\r\nstudents of typography. Books must not be regarded as an investment on\r\nwhich a profit can be made by a sale at some future date, because books\r\nof bibliographical rarity and much monetary value bought from public\r\nfunds must remain public property, inalienable for all time. The books\r\nbought for a public library should rather be regarded as machinery or\r\nplant, to be renewed when necessary and kept thoroughly abreast of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=184.= Returning to the question of buying and preserving books of\r\ntemporary interest. There are hundreds of subjects which in their day\r\nhave excited great public interest, and in connexion with which an\r\nenormous literature exists, but which have faded into comparative\r\ninsignificance with the lapse of time. Take subjects like the Jacobite\r\nRebellions, French Revolution, American Civil War, the Slavery\r\ncontroversy, Crimean War or Disruption of the Church of Scotland. Every\r\none of these subjects was represented in its day by cart-loads of books\r\nand pamphlets, but the whole of these have been sifted and epitomized by\r\nlater historians in works of permanent value, and municipal libraries\r\ncan simply buy these, and leave the preservation of the contemporary\r\nliterature, which ranks as original authorities, to the care of the\r\nspecial libraries which exist for the purpose. The literature of the\r\nBoer War is a case in point, as also is much of the literature of the\r\nGreat European War of 1914-1919 already. It is necessary for public\r\nlibraries, while public interest is keen, to select the best, or what\r\nmay seem best, from the mass of material pouring from the press, but\r\npresently all this will be condensed into a few classics, giving in a\r\ncomprehensive and sufficient manner every fact of the slightest interest\r\nto posterity, and then all the ephemeral works can be discarded in their\r\nfavour. What remains of any particular interest to students, or even\r\nordinary readers, from the huge literature which arose from the Crimean\r\nWar? Only Kinglake and perhaps two popular illustrated books. The same\r\nholds good with all subjects which have created immense contemporary\r\nliteratures, and there need not be the slightest compunction about\r\ndiscarding any book when its usefulness is past unless it takes rank as\r\na valuable original authority. At a later stage some suggestions on book\r\ndiscarding or library weeding are given, which may prove helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=185.= Book selection should be conducted upon the sound principle of\r\nbuying only the best representative works on all subjects, whatever may\r\nbe their cost or place of origin. A more haphazard and ineffectual\r\nmethod of building up a public library than buying cheap series and\r\nlibraries of reprints can hardly be imagined. It is almost equivalent to\r\nadvising a committee to buy cheap books by the yard in order to fill the\r\nshelves, and let the proper representation of great subjects depend on\r\nchance. Books published in “series” or “libraries” are too often mere\r\ncommercial ventures of small literary or other value; and in the case of\r\neditions of standard authors, such uniform series are often the worst\r\nform in which a poet or novelist can be presented to a reader. They are\r\nfull of errors and omissions, and whether the series is devoted to art,\r\nscience, literature or history, it may be taken for granted that they\r\nare simply temporary text-books which possess the doubtful advantage of\r\nbeing bound uniformly, and the undoubted disadvantage of being often\r\nuniformly erroneous and misleading. Of course this statement does not\r\napply all round, because there are several well-known series of works of\r\nquite exceptional value. Connected with this a word may be permitted on\r\nthe nationality of text-books. Patriotism in literature and library\r\nmanagement may be a fine thing, but it must occasionally lead to sorry\r\nresults in a public library. The best and most recent scientific works,\r\nwhether on biology, geology or any other subject, should be bought\r\nwithout regard to the nationality of the authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=186. Popular Books.=--The duplication of popular or temporarily popular\r\nbooks is a policy to be adopted with the greatest of care. In some\r\nlibraries the plan of multiplying copies of every book which becomes\r\nfashionable is carried to such an extreme that some injury must be done\r\nto the general work of the library by unduly fostering one class of\r\nliterature at the expense of all the other classes. The practice of\r\nadding six or more copies of a new novel has the effect of decreasing\r\nthe funds available for the purpose of buying other works, and it\r\ncertainly gives rise to misleading conceptions of the stock of books\r\npossessed by the libraries. A reported stock of 5000 novels may easily\r\nmean an actual stock of only 3000 different works in libraries which buy\r\nthree, six or twelve copies of a single popular work. This makes a vast\r\ndifference in the field of choice offered to borrowers, because, after\r\nall, popular novels of the ordinary much-advertised class soon have\r\ntheir little day, and the duplicates become dead stock. For this reason\r\ncaution should be exercised in the supply of extra copies of temporarily\r\npopular books, and a good plan is to provide a special stock or\r\naccessions book in which they can be registered and, when necessary,\r\nwritten off without complicating the other records of the library.\r\nThese remarks apply almost exclusively to the duplication of novels and\r\nmagazines. There is less need to trouble about other classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=187. Replacements and Out-of-print Books.=--Replacement of worn-out\r\nbooks is a recurrent, necessary and serious expense in most libraries,\r\nand one which gravely reduces possible expenditure upon new books.\r\nBefore replacing an old, dirty or defective book it should be carefully\r\nconsidered if it is worth retaining in the library. Closely connected\r\nwith the question of replacements is the matter of out-of-print books.\r\n\r\nMost librarians in libraries of several years’ standing have been\r\nconfronted with the difficulty of obtaining copies of certain books\r\nwhich have been allowed to go out of print by their publishers. The\r\nnumber of such books is rapidly increasing, and among them are works\r\nwhich have taken a recognized place in English literature, as well as\r\nmany others which have obtained a certain value by being enshrined in\r\nthe catalogues of hundreds of public and other libraries. In course of\r\ntime many of these books are worn out, and it becomes necessary to\r\nreplace them with new copies. It is then the discovery is made that\r\nfresh copies cannot be obtained, and the librarian receives a long list\r\nof books from his bookseller marked with the ominous sign “O/P.” A\r\ntemporary relief is sometimes obtained by advertising for second-hand\r\ncopies. Even these are becoming more difficult to procure, and in the\r\ncase of novelists like G. P. R. James, James Grant and Harrison\r\nAinsworth, sometimes only three-volume editions are reported.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested that all out-of-print books should be reprinted, nor\r\ndo we suggest that the fact that a book has appeared in many library\r\ncatalogues is conclusive evidence of its permanence; but there are\r\ncertainly numbers of books which are frequently mentioned in other\r\nbooks, or in the newspapers, which have been allowed to run out of\r\nprint; and the combined efforts of librarians might induce publishers to\r\nrepublish these. Usually speaking, however, the fact that a book has\r\nremained out of print for more than a year or two is evidence of the\r\nabsence of public demand for it, and seeing that novel-writing is\r\nprobably at a higher general level now than at any earlier period (in\r\nspite of the lack of individual Fieldings or Jane Austens), we are of\r\nopinion that such out-of-print books may be withdrawn from the library\r\nrecords, and the gaps left made good by more modern works of equal merit\r\nand greater popularity. After all, and especially so far as imaginative\r\nliterature is concerned--and these remarks apply almost exclusively to\r\nthat--it is no part of the work of the library to revive what public\r\nopinion, the soundest _ultimate_ guide, has permitted to perish; more\r\nespecially as booksellers charge exaggerated prices for out-of-print\r\nnovels, whatever their merit may be. In the case of some of the older\r\nbooks which form landmarks in literary history, it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to have well-edited modern reprints for the benefit of the\r\nstudents who are being formed in every school in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nBooks which are purchased to replace worn-out copies need not receive\r\nnew numbers, but may be given the numbers of the books which they\r\nreplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n=188. Doubtful Books.=--Censorship on books admitted into public\r\nlibraries has been exercised much more frequently and rigorously in the\r\nUnited States than in the United Kingdom. Instances are common in both\r\ncountries of books being excluded for sectarian or political reasons by\r\nPublic Library Committees. Any action of this kind on the part of a\r\nPublic Library Committee should be confined to protecting junior readers\r\nfrom coming into contact with demoralizing literature, and preventing\r\nthe library from becoming a dumping-ground for feeble and trashy books\r\nof all kinds. No one can object to a committee electing to sit in\r\njudgment on any book which may be thought to endanger public decency, or\r\ninculcate ideas of morality counter to those generally adopted, but such\r\nexplorations in search of the improper should not be confined to\r\nfiction. The question of buying certain _free_ classics, such as\r\nRabelais and Boccaccio, is quite another matter. All libraries ought to\r\npossess them, provided reasonable means are taken to keep them out of\r\nthe hands of the immature reader. As regards what constitutes maturity,\r\nevery library authority will doubtless frame its own rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=189. Reference and Lending Books.=--A difficulty is sometimes\r\nexperienced in deciding for which department books of a certain class\r\nare most suitable. About such quick-reference works as encyclopædias,\r\ndictionaries, annuals, directories, atlases, large art works, etc.,\r\nthere can be very little doubt, but expensive scientific books, large\r\nworks of travel, theological and historical works of a certain kind\r\noffer a problem much more complicated. As reference libraries are at\r\npresent constituted and used in many English towns, the plan of putting\r\nall expensive books of whatever nature in the reference department\r\nsimply means that they are seldom used, and might as well not have been\r\nbought. In properly conducted open access reference libraries, which are\r\nliberally and intelligently conducted, a good deal may be said in favour\r\nof placing such books there. They will at least be freely accessible\r\nwithout the formality of readers having to make written application,\r\nwhile the advantage of a reference book being always on the premises is\r\nnot to be overlooked. No harm can result from placing all kinds of\r\nexpensive text-books in the lending department, and if they are not on\r\nloan they are always available for the use of any reference reader who\r\nwants them. The advantage to a student of being able to take a recondite\r\nand expensive text-book home with him for comparison with, and as an aid\r\nto, his own books is undeniable, and it is the fact that, by\r\nco-operation, the citizens of a town can thus procure otherwise\r\nunattainable books, which makes the Public Libraries Acts so valuable,\r\nand adds force to the plea for placing expensive works within easy reach\r\nof the majority of readers. Local circumstances will in most cases\r\nmodify the conditions under which reference and lending libraries are\r\nbuilt up and differentiated. In some places there is no separation, save\r\nin the catalogue, between the reference and lending libraries, and in\r\nothers both departments are not only kept apart, but subdivided into\r\nopen, special and store collections. All this is very much a matter of\r\nadministration to be settled by each responsible officer in accordance\r\nwith his or her knowledge of the particular local conditions. We deal\r\nwith this question more in detail in the chapters on the Reference\r\nLibrary (Division XII.).\r\n\r\n\r\n=190. Special Collections.=--The most necessary work of the library,\r\nafter it has formed its general collection, is to collect local\r\nliterature; this we deal with in a separate chapter (XXVIII.). Most\r\npublic libraries possess some kind of special collection in addition to\r\nthe purely local collection. Examples of these may be specified in the\r\nShakespeare and Cervantes collections at Birmingham; the Burns and\r\nScottish poetry collections at Glasgow; music, shorthand, Chinese books,\r\netc., at Manchester; fishes at Cheltenham; Welsh literature at Cardiff,\r\netc. The literature of special local industries should always be\r\ncollected. Representative works in foreign languages, particularly\r\nFrench, German and Italian, should also be collected, in addition to the\r\nGreek and Latin classics; and the large and more cosmopolitan cities may\r\nendeavour to represent every foreign literary output so far as their\r\ncircumstances warrant and their finances permit them to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n=191. Sets of Periodicals.=--Some discrimination must be made in regard\r\nto the collecting of periodicals. Larger libraries settle the question\r\nby securing and preserving sets of all magazines of value which they can\r\naccommodate; but obviously the expense of the practice, the ephemeral\r\ncharacter of much of this type of literature, and the large amount of\r\nshelf space it requires, makes that practice impossible for any but the\r\nlargest libraries. Ephemeral, but otherwise wholesome, magazines may be\r\nused unbound for issue in lending libraries to good purpose; or may be\r\nbound and so used--but not replaced when they are worn out. Only\r\nperiodicals which have a _reference_ value should be retained in sets,\r\nand then only where the geographical situation of the library warrants\r\nthat course. A smaller town near a great town library may reasonably\r\nrefer its readers to that library for sets of expensive periodicals. We\r\nare led to this view by the facilities now at the disposal of librarians\r\nthrough the Library Association. That body now publishes the _Subject\r\nIndex to Periodicals_, hitherto called _The Athenæum Subject Index_--an\r\ninvaluable and indeed indispensable tool for all librarians--and by an\r\narrangement with the Central Lending Library for Students, Tavistock\r\nSquare, London, W.C., any article recorded in the _Subject Index_ may be\r\nborrowed for a payment of about fourpence. The _Index_, moreover, gives\r\na list of the principal periodicals, and is a rough guide to assessing\r\ntheir permanent worth as well as an admirable key to their contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n=192. Music=.--Nearly every public library of any importance has now\r\nestablished a music collection, and the general experience is that it is\r\none of the most popular and appreciated sections in the library. The\r\nprovision should not at first extend to more than collections of\r\npianoforte, violin, organ and vocal music in the form of bound volumes;\r\noperas, oratorios, cantatas and other vocal scores; the scores of\r\norchestral and chamber compositions; and text-books on theory, history\r\nand various instruments. Single compositions in sheet form should be\r\nvery sparingly introduced, if at all, unless collections of the songs of\r\nsome of the best modern composers are formed and bound up into volumes.\r\nA large stock of compositions in single sheets, however bound or\r\nsecured, would prove a great trouble in a public library. The\r\ncompositions of local composers should be collected, however, and bound\r\nin volumes. In providing shelving for music, it is well to have special\r\ncases with uprights only eighteen inches apart, as it is very difficult\r\nto consult long rows of thin quarto books, when on shelves three feet\r\nlong, owing to the weight of the books. This applies to quarto and folio\r\nbooks generally.\r\n\r\n\r\n=193. Engravings.=--Save in book form, very few public libraries have\r\ndone much in the way of collecting engravings, prints and etchings,\r\nunless they have been of local interest. Considerations of expense would\r\ndeter most British public libraries from attempting this kind of\r\ncollection, and it is rather a pity, because many prints and engravings\r\nwhich illustrate historical events have immense practical value.\r\nPortraits, too, are extremely valuable and useful, but as means are at\r\npresent provided, the whole matter is one of pure speculation and\r\nsentiment. But perhaps the day will come when public libraries may be\r\nable to collect specimens of the etched work of great artists;\r\nengravings after the greatest masters; engravings and prints depicting\r\nleading events in the national history; and pictures illustrating\r\ncostume, ceremonials, manners and customs, disappearing buildings, great\r\nengineering works, topographical changes, etc. The value of these\r\ngraphic aids to the furtherance of knowledge is enormous, and it is a\r\npity some systematic effort cannot be made to record, preserve and index\r\nthem more generally and effectively than has been done in depositories\r\nlike the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[3]=194. Photographs.=--Collections of photographs which deal with local\r\nmatters should be made by every public library (see Chapter XXVIII.).\r\nCertain American libraries also collect photographs of great pictures\r\nand those which represent various natural forms. Studies for the use of\r\nartists are also collected, mounted on cards, and made accessible, and\r\nsome of these attempts to popularize art should be made in British\r\nlibraries. Photographs are comparatively cheap, and almost every kind of\r\npicture and study can be obtained in this medium. What is particularly\r\nrequired is some kind of practical list or guide, drawn up by an expert,\r\nfrom which libraries could make their selections. A systematic list\r\ncovering the various arts of design, historical painting, sculpture,\r\narchitecture, etc., would be of great service. Photographs of great\r\npublic events, ceremonials, buildings, etc., and of eminent personages,\r\nwould have to be purchased according to means, and, as every one knows,\r\nthis might be made an endless matter. There is no reason, however, why\r\npublic libraries should not preserve good photographs of the most\r\neminent authors, artists, musicians, scientists, military commanders,\r\nroyal personages, etc. Portraits of such persons are not always easy to\r\nfind in books, when required, especially as the _A. L. A.\r\nPortrait-Index_ is limited in scope; therefore a separate collection of\r\nportraits in alphabetical order would be a valuable addition to a public\r\nlibrary. In this connexion it is useful to remove portraits of\r\ncelebrities, views, etc., from worn-out books and magazines, and\r\npreserve them along with all other appropriate matter.\r\n\r\n  [3] The matters thus marked are dealt with more fully under the\r\n      Division on Reference Work, but are included here for the sake of\r\n      giving a complete conspectus of the material involved in\r\n      selection.--ED.\r\n\r\n[4]=195. Lantern Slides.=--In libraries which possess lecture-rooms or\r\nother suitable accommodation, it is often desirable to collect lantern\r\nslides on such subjects as local topography and history, or on topics\r\nwhich illustrate bibliographical and kindred subjects. These will be\r\nfound very useful, and as the collection increases, sets can be lent out\r\nto societies or individuals who require them for lectures. The cost of\r\nstoring and cataloguing the slides is not great, and they are\r\nundoubtedly a valuable addition to the pictorial side of literature.\r\n\r\n  [4] The matters thus marked are dealt with more fully under the\r\n      Division on Reference Work, but are included here for the sake of\r\n      giving a complete conspectus of the material involved in\r\n      selection.--ED.\r\n\r\n[5]=196. Trade and other Catalogues.=--A most useful department, though\r\nsomewhat difficult to maintain, is a collection of the best and most\r\nrepresentative catalogues and price lists of all kinds of commodities.\r\nSeveral points crop up in connection with the work of forming such\r\ncollections, and the question of policy is here perhaps the most\r\nimportant. Many firms will not give their price lists; and it may be\r\nconsidered invidious to select firms, thereby suggesting favouritism and\r\nunfair advertising. In some industries prices, ideas and designs are\r\nregarded as trade secrets, and doubtless jealousies might be stirred up\r\nin some quarters. But the fact remains that illustrated catalogues of\r\nbooks, furniture, ironmongery, machinery, pottery, art publications,\r\nscientific apparatus, etc., are often more generally useful than\r\ntext-books or special trade and professional journals. Even pattern\r\nbooks of wall-papers, bookbinders’ cloths, leather-work, typefounding\r\nand so forth are of immense service to special students, and an effort\r\nshould be made to strengthen the literary side of suitable subjects by a\r\njudicious selection of the best illustrated trade catalogues.\r\n\r\n  [5] The matters thus marked are dealt with more fully under the\r\n      Division on Reference Work, but are included here for the sake of\r\n      giving a complete conspectus of the material involved in\r\n      selection.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=197. Books for the Blind.=--Many libraries now store and circulate\r\nbooks for the blind in the Braille and Moon types, and in this work some\r\nof them have been aided by the expert advice and actual donations of\r\nspecial societies interested in the well-being of the blind. There is\r\nquite an extensive and rapidly growing literature for the blind in the\r\nspecial raised type required for finger-reading, and a library of a few\r\nhundreds of volumes makes quite an imposing show. The question of space\r\nwill arise in many places, because books for the blind are, as a rule,\r\nonly embossed on one side of each page, and, owing to this embossing and\r\nthe size of the type, some books make several thick quarto volumes. No\r\nspace could, however, be devoted to a more humane or valuable purpose\r\nthan the storage of books for the blind, and every encouragement and\r\nsupport should be given to the movement; though it would undoubtedly be\r\nthe most effective method of ministering to the needs of the locality to\r\nsubscribe for a constantly changing supply of books to one of the\r\ninstitutions for the blind which make a speciality of this kind of work.\r\n\r\n[6]=198. Maps.=--In addition to all local maps and plans, old and new,\r\nsets of the Ordnance and Geological Survey maps on the one-inch scale\r\nshould be added. Atlases will exist in the reference library as a matter\r\nof course, but maps of the United Kingdom suitable for tourists,\r\ncyclists, anglers, climbers, etc., should be added as freely as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n  [6] The matters thus marked are dealt with more fully under the\r\n      Division on Reference Work, but are included here for the sake of\r\n      giving a complete conspectus of the material involved in\r\n      selection.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n=199. Discarding Effete Books.=--The question of periodically weeding\r\nout a public library, with the object of keeping it always up to date\r\nand also making room for fresh additional stock, has already been partly\r\ndiscussed in Sections 107, etc., and 174, etc., and it is a most\r\nimportant part of modern public library policy. The periodical\r\nreprinting of class lists affords a valuable opportunity for considering\r\nthe claims of certain kinds of books to remain idle on the shelves,\r\nwhere they not only fill the space which should be available for more\r\nlive works, but they obstruct the general work of the library. Every\r\npublic library receives at one time or another books which must for\r\nreasons of policy be catalogued. Such books, for example, as are\r\ndonated, are expected to be placed in the library and duly catalogued.\r\nThere are generally hundreds of such books in every large library which\r\nhave no permanent value; and these, and also the mistaken selections of\r\ncommittees and librarians, should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\nThere are also, of course, the books which go out of use automatically,\r\nsuch as those noted in the subjoined Rules, and those others which\r\nmanage to slip into libraries when the custodian is dreaming of higher\r\nthings, or is misled by the erroneous titles adopted by authors. The\r\nweeding-out process should be continuous, and when catalogues are being\r\nreprinted, the books are being rearranged, or any kind of fresh movement\r\nis being made, a specially favourable opportunity is afforded to prune\r\nthe growth of weeds which will somehow manage to infest the\r\nbest-regulated libraries in spite of every care. The sentimental museum\r\nidea is, of course, responsible for much of the tendency to collect and\r\npreserve everything, on the Byronic theory, no doubt, that\r\n\r\n    A book’s a book, although there’s nothing in’t,\r\n\r\nand, as a library is a repository for books, then _all_ books should be\r\ncollected and preserved at any hazard or sacrifice, be they good or\r\nbad.\r\n\r\n\r\n=200.= RULES FOR DISCARDING USELESS BOOKS:\r\n\r\n  SCIENCE.--All general works which are not epoch-making, but merely\r\n  recapitulations of ascertained facts, should be discarded when twenty\r\n  years old. Care should be taken not to discard any book, however old,\r\n  which has not been efficiently superseded. All ordinary text-books of\r\n  every science, save mathematics and occult science, may be discarded\r\n  when twenty years old. Nicely illustrated textbooks, especially of\r\n  zoology and botany, should be discarded with much caution.\r\n\r\n  USEFUL ARTS.--The same rule applies to this class as to Science, save\r\n  that patents, specifications, recipes, books on household arts, and\r\n  all finely illustrated books should be retained.\r\n\r\n  FINE ARTS.--Books must be discarded very sparingly in this section.\r\n  Collections of engravings, finely illustrated books, and collected\r\n  music, not at all.\r\n\r\n  THEOLOGY AND PHILOSOPHY.--Philosophical works, particularly systems of\r\n  philosophy, should never be discarded. Historical and explanatory\r\n  text-books may be discarded as they become superseded by later works.\r\n  Old theology, commentaries on the Bible, sectarian literature and\r\n  sermons should be discarded very freely. Theological controversies\r\n  should never be collected by general municipal libraries unless of\r\n  local interest.\r\n\r\n  SOCIAL SCIENCE.--This class requires frequent revision, especially in\r\n  the sections devoted to political economy, government, law and other\r\n  topics. Books on questions of momentary interest can be replaced by\r\n  historical résumés. Constantly changing subjects like law, government\r\n  and political economy should be kept up to date as much as possible,\r\n  and the historical record kept by means of recent histories. Questions\r\n  like parliamentary reform, slavery and chartism are illustrations of\r\n  once burning topics which may just as well be represented by a few\r\n  modern histories as by actual collections of the very voluminous\r\n  literature attached to each subject.\r\n\r\n  LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.--Old grammars may be discarded without risk,\r\n  and also ordinary school dictionaries. Books on literary history,\r\n  bibliography and librarianship are tools, and should never be\r\n  discarded.\r\n\r\n  PROSE FICTION.--Novelists mentioned in literary histories should never\r\n  be discarded. Minor novelists of all lands, who are not mentioned in\r\n  literary histories, whose works have remained unissued for a year or\r\n  two, should be promptly discarded. So, also, should merely topical\r\n  novels of no permanent interest, which libraries are often forced to\r\n  buy under pressure. Continuous popularity is a good reason for\r\n  retaining any novel, provided it is not immoral.\r\n\r\n  POETRY AND DRAMA.--Collective works should never be discarded unless\r\n  efficiently superseded. But poets and dramatists of a day who are no\r\n  longer read may be safely discarded, but no one who is named in\r\n  histories of literature.\r\n\r\n  HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY.--Historical works which are mere résumés, and\r\n  not themselves original authorities, may be discarded with comparative\r\n  safety; but the matter of illustrations again applies here with\r\n  considerable force. Works of travel of the ordinary globe-trotting\r\n  description may be discarded when ten years old, along with all kinds\r\n  of guidebooks, save those which are local. But here, again, beware of\r\n  discarding illustrated books. Pioneer works of exploration should be\r\n  retained. Old gazetteers are, as a rule, lumber, but some of the\r\n  illustrated ones, like Lewis’ for Britain, may be retained for their\r\n  armorial illustrations. Histories which are literary classics, like\r\n  Hume, Robertson, Clarendon, should be kept, even if superseded by more\r\n  accurate modern works.\r\n\r\n  BIOGRAPHY.--Collected biography should never be discarded. The\r\n  biographies of nonentities in the individual biography class may,\r\n  however, be weeded pretty freely and frequently after they are from\r\n  forty to fifty years old.\r\n\r\n  MISCELLANEOUS.--Discard old encyclopædias with care; newspapers or\r\n  directories freely. Retain all local matter of this kind however. Be\r\n  extremely chary about storing inferior magazines of the miscellany\r\n  order. A long set of an old magazine of this kind is a positive\r\n  incubus, and most modern magazines of the snippet order are not worth\r\n  house-room. Wear them out in the reading rooms by all means, but do\r\n  not preserve them.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL.--All works that are defective or dirty should be discarded,\r\n  or at any rate withdrawn from general circulation. A book defective in\r\n  a plate or a section or two can sometimes be completed by an\r\n  application to the publisher for the missing part, which is usually\r\n  forthcoming at small cost. Dirty books are the bane of municipal\r\n  lending libraries, and a ruthless policy in regard to them is a public\r\n  economy. Especially does this remark apply to classic fiction: clean,\r\n  or fresh, copies should always be available, even if at the cost of\r\n  obtaining fewer works of inferior fiction. Many of the criticisms\r\n  levelled at libraries have been due to neglect of this matter;\r\n  sometimes due, we are sorry to say, to want of money to buy the\r\n  necessary replacements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=201.= None of the foregoing recommendations for discarding, except the\r\nlast, applies to bibliographical rarities or curiosities; to works of\r\nrecognized literary merit which are mentioned in histories of\r\nliterature; to books which are of local interest; or to special\r\ncollections. They apply simply and solely to the rank and file of\r\nliterature, the 50 per cent. of the fruits of the press which become\r\nstale through effluxion of time. The question of how to dispose of\r\ndiscarded books can generally be decided by some local circumstance.\r\nDiscarded text-books of science are generally of little value to anyone,\r\nand need not be preserved at all. But faded works of travel, history and\r\nbiography may find interested readers in workhouses, hospitals and\r\nprisons. To these, or similar institutions, the discarded books of a\r\npublic library could be transferred. It is hardly necessary to point out\r\nthat books which are not good enough or fresh enough for a central\r\nlibrary, are not good enough for a branch library. Books proposed to be\r\nwithdrawn permanently should be submitted to the library committee, and\r\nlists of the discarded books may be printed in the bulletin, if there is\r\none, or, failing that, in a separate form. It is useful that readers\r\nlikely to be interested should be afforded an opportunity of judging the\r\nproposals and action of the library committee in its work of weeding out\r\nthe library. Any serious objection to a book being removed should be\r\nconsidered, and nothing should be done without the utmost deliberation,\r\nbecause, as yet, we have not achieved a public library _index\r\nexpurgatorius_ of books not worth preserving. When this comes, the task\r\nwill be immensely lightened. Books which are discarded should not be\r\npermitted to leave the library unless stamped, to indicate that they are\r\nrejected. A stamp with a movable dating centre should be used, with the\r\nwords,\r\n\r\n  “Public Library, Discarded,”\r\n\r\nin a circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=202. Practical Methods of Selection.=--The number of books which have\r\nbeen published to aid in book selection is somewhat large, but few of\r\nthem, save, perhaps, Sonnenschein’s publications and Nelson’s _Standard\r\nBooks_, make any attempt to indicate the best editions of particular\r\nauthors. It may be assumed that every entry in these lists of best books\r\nrepresents a work which is recommended on account of its merit, literary\r\nor otherwise. But something more than this is required by the librarian\r\nwho is faced with the task of building up a great modern library, and is\r\nlimited in his selection to books of the most enduring merit, and those\r\nwhich most completely and accurately record the state of the science or\r\nsubject to which they are devoted. It is a very easy matter to simply\r\norder _books_, like the millionaire who fitted up his library by the\r\nsuperficial yard, thereby tempting a bookseller, entrusted with a large\r\norder for books of a uniform size in fine bindings, to bind up some\r\nhundreds of copies of a cheap “remainder,” in different covers, but with\r\nvarying titles, in order to provide in dummy form the necessary mileage\r\nof books required. Public library formation can hardly be undertaken in\r\nthis happy-go-lucky manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=203.= The principal aids to the selection of new books are The Library\r\nAssociation List of Best Books, which is an annotated, classified and\r\nevaluated list published weekly in _The Athenæum_, and _The A. L. A.\r\nBook-List_, which serves similarly for American books, and the journals\r\nof various kinds, which review and advertise books as published.\r\nComparatively few of the literary journals review books in a manner\r\nhelpful to the would-be book-buyer, because they do not describe the\r\ncontents of them so much as criticize their literary style, production,\r\nprinters’ errors, etc. Generally speaking, a modern book review is what\r\nit was in the old days of the _Edinburgh_ and _Quarterly_, simply a peg\r\non which to hang the reviewer’s opinions on the subject of the book,\r\nand on which to display his knowledge and critical insight. Moreover, it\r\nmust be remembered that publishers advertise their wares in literary\r\njournals, and that fact may, in some cases, not be without influence\r\nupon the views of the critics. The subject of the book, its style of\r\ntreatment, scope, and details of its contents are left to be divined by\r\nthe reader. Some of the modern publishers’ monthly catalogues are much\r\nmore helpful than any journal or review, because they add brief\r\ndescriptive notes to each entry of a new book. A plain, practical note\r\noutlining the principal contents and intention of a book is worth pages\r\nof critical remarks to the librarian book-buyer. The following is a list\r\nof the journals most used by librarians in selecting new books:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL:\r\n    Athenæum                  }\r\n      (Annotated)             }\r\n    Literary World            }\r\n    Publishers’ Circular      }  Weekly and monthly, most of\r\n    Saturday Review           }    them giving a summary list\r\n    Nation (London)           }    of new books, reviews, and\r\n    Spectator                 }    advertisements.\r\n    Times Literary Supplement }\r\n      (Annotated)             }\r\n    Bookman.\r\n    Bookseller.\r\n    Book Monthly.\r\n    A.L.A. Book List.\r\n      (Annotated.)\r\n    Nation (New York).\r\n    Publishers’ Weekly (New York).\r\n\r\n  SPECIAL:\r\n    Nature (scientific books generally).\r\n    English Mechanic (technical books)\r\n    Engineer (technical books).\r\n    Current Foreign books can readily be found in the lists\r\n      issued by Brockhaus, Hachette, Williams & Norgate,\r\n      Dulau, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the very uncertain and unsatisfactory method of thus\r\nchoosing new books by their titles, because it amounts to very little\r\nelse, some arrangement is required whereby libraries can obtain\r\nnon-fictional books on view, so that they can be properly examined\r\nbefore being ordered. Publishers are generally willing to submit new\r\npublications to librarians through their booksellers, and visits to\r\nlarge book stores should be made frequently. A good plan is for a public\r\nlibrary to maintain one or two subscriptions with a large commercial\r\ncirculating library, through which new books may be read or examined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=204.= The best guides to the titles of old books, which, of course,\r\ninclude modern books other than recent publications, will be found in\r\nAppendix II., p. 507. Here again, no doubt owing to the largeness of the\r\nfield, notes in aid of choice are badly wanted. Nelson’s and\r\nSonnenschein’s books are the best in this respect, if the special\r\nannotated lists in the latter are excepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=205. General:=\r\n\r\n  Bascom, E.

Donations.=--The first British Public Library Act did not make any\r\nprovision for funds with which to buy books: it trusted entirely, with\r\nthe innocence of extreme youth, to the benevolence of donors. As these\r\nsomewhat rare persons did not respond in an encouraging manner, the Acts\r\nwere forthwith amended, and communities given power to purchase books\r\nfrom such limited funds as were left after loans, the librarian’s salary\r\nand the lighting bill had been settled. Although every library benefits\r\nnow and then from the generosity of donors of books and money, donations\r\ncannot be regarded as a reliable source of a constant and liberal supply\r\nof good and suitable books. Indeed, it may be asserted that more printed\r\nrubbish is bestowed annually on public libraries than anything of a\r\nuseful or valuable sort. Touting for gifts is to be avoided. It is not\r\nonly undignified, but often results in failure and a certain loss of\r\nstatus to the library which employs a general begging policy.\r\n\r\nState papers and public documents are carefully preserved in many\r\nlibraries in the United Kingdom. Many of the best parliamentary papers\r\nand reports can be obtained free on application to H.M. Stationery\r\nOffice in London, but other valuable public documents, such as some of\r\nthe Record Office publications, the Ordnance Survey, etc., must be\r\npurchased. The parliamentary papers were not given free to public\r\nlibraries till after years of agitation dating from the time of Edwards\r\nin 1850. A selection of these papers will be found sufficient for most\r\nlibraries, and this can be made from the lists published by H.M.\r\nStationery Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n=208.= All donations, good, bad or indifferent, should be duly recorded\r\nin a special DONATION REGISTER, and the donors should be thanked in the\r\nusual manner, either by means of a special circular or post-card. For\r\nthe majority of donations a printed post-card of acknowledgment is\r\ncommonly used, and specially valuable gifts are acknowledged by special\r\nresolutions conveyed in a handsome form. It would seem better, however,\r\nif a letter-form of acknowledgment were generally used. Gratitude, even\r\nfor small gifts, costs little, and its expression frequently leads to\r\nmore valuable gifts. The usual wording for acknowledgments runs thus:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  |                 LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY.                  |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  | I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your gift     |\r\n  | named below, and to convey to you the most cordial thanks |\r\n  | of the Library Committee.                                 |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  |               Yours faithfully,                           |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  |       ............................_Chief Librarian._      |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  | ......................................................... |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  | ......................................................... |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  | ......................................................... |\r\n  |                                                           |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 57.--Donation Acknowledgment (Section 208).\r\n\r\n\r\n=209.= The ruling of a donation book (Fig. 58) will be found to answer\r\nall ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\nThe donation number is a progressive number which should be given to all\r\ngifts, particularly books, because, when pencilled on volumes which are\r\nduplicates or not stocked for any reason, it is easy to ascertain their\r\nhistory by turning up the number in the donation book. Most of the other\r\nheadings explain themselves. When books are added to the library as\r\ndonations it is well to carry into this record the accession numbers\r\ngiven to them in the columns provided. In the “Remarks” column can be\r\nentered any information as to the disposal of the gifts. In some\r\nlibraries a book is used which resembles a receipt book in having a\r\ncounterfoil and a tear-off sheet forming a thanks circular or\r\nacknowledgment form. This style of book is less satisfactory than the\r\nform of record given above.\r\n\r\n  <-----------------9″------------------><-------------9″-------------->\r\n  +----++------+------++---------++-----+--------++----------++--------+\r\n  |    ||      |Date  ||         ||     |        ||Accession ||        | ^\r\n  |Do- ||Date  |of Ac-||Descrip- ||No.  |Name and||Number.   ||        | |\r\n  |na- ||of Re-|knowl ||tion of  ||of   |Address ++-----+----++Remarks.| |\r\n  |tion||ceipt.|edg-  ||Donation.||Vols.|of      ||Lend.|Ref.||        | |\r\n  |No. ||      |ment. ||         ||     |Donor.  ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  +----++------+------++---------++-----+--------++-----+----++--------+ |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        |13″\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | |\r\n  |    ||      |      ||         ||     |        ||     |    ||        | V\r\n\r\nFIG. 58.--Donation Book Ruling (Section 209).\r\n\r\n\r\n=210. Readers’ Suggestions.=--There are comparatively few suggestions of\r\nnew books made by readers in public libraries, most of the\r\nrecommendations coming from the librarian and the committee. It is\r\ncustomary to provide a book in which members of the public can enter\r\ntheir suggestions, or slips as described in Section 48. Slips are\r\nperhaps preferable to books, as they are more likely to be used by the\r\npublic and are handier to arrange. Failing them, an ordinary foolscap\r\nfolio book can be provided, ruled with columns across two pages showing:\r\n\r\n  +-------+-------+------+-----+-----+------+-------+----------+--------+\r\n  |Date of|       |      |Date |     |      |       | Name and |Decision|\r\n  |Sugges-|Author.|Title.| of  |Vols.|Price.|  Pub- |Address of|of Com- |\r\n  | tion. |       |      |Publ.|     |      |lisher.|Proposer. |mittee. |\r\n  +-------+-------+------+-----+-----+------+-------+----------+--------+\r\n  |       |       |      |     |     |      |       |          |        |\r\n  |       |       |      |     |     |      |       |          |        |\r\n  |       |       |      |     |     |      |       |          |        |\r\n\r\nFIG. 59.--Proposition Book Ruling (Section 210).\r\n\r\n\r\n=211.= From the suggestions of the public and the committee and his own\r\nstudy of reviews, catalogues, journals, etc., the librarian prepares a\r\nlist of book suggestions for the use of the committee, or special books\r\nsub-committee, as the case may be. This list may either be entered and\r\nkept in the suggestions book, or written out on separate slips (5 inches\r\n× 3 inches), which can be afterwards used as a catalogue for staff use.\r\nThe latter plan is preferable as being more economical and convenient,\r\nespecially when worked in conjunction with suggestion slips, of the same\r\nsize, instead of a proposition book. Some committees require a\r\nduplicated list of the suggestions to be prepared and circulated before\r\nthey meet in order that every member may have the opportunity of\r\nexamining it beforehand. In a few cases the librarian also (or as an\r\nalternative) obtains all the books on approval from the bookseller, and\r\nthe committee chooses from direct examination of the books themselves.\r\nThis method involves extra labour, especially in large libraries, but is\r\nvery successful and well worth the trouble. When the list has passed the\r\ncommittee, with whatever modifications they may have imposed, the books\r\ncan be ordered as described below in Section 213. These suggestions are\r\nthe main source from which the library is built up, and ought to be\r\nprepared and examined with great care. Arising out of this part of the\r\nsubject is the question of buying books at sales. This is often done\r\nthrough a bookseller or other agent, who receives a marked copy of the\r\ncatalogue, with the prices to be offered written against each entry, and\r\nfor his services in attending and bidding 5 to 10 per cent. is generally\r\nallowed. Of course, at any book-sale in the same town as the library,\r\nthe librarian may attend, but an experienced agent is more likely to\r\navoid mistakes. Unfortunately few public libraries can afford to compete\r\nwith booksellers and private collectors in the saleroom, and practically\r\nthis source of accessions is not of much use to the majority of British\r\npublic libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=212. Subscription Books.=--Sources of book supply in many libraries are\r\nthe works coming regularly as annuals, or from societies to whose\r\npublications the library subscribes. Patents’ specifications,\r\nparliamentary reports and other periodical publications also furnish a\r\nconstant, if somewhat irregular, stream of additions. There should be\r\nsome simple means of checking these annual and irregular publications,\r\nand a series of cards, somewhat similar to those suggested for magazines\r\nin Section 475, will be found very convenient. It is hardly necessary to\r\nadd that these check-cards should be examined regularly for overdues and\r\nomissions. Societies which issue only occasional monographs are the most\r\ndifficult to trace and check. With annual publications of a definite\r\nkind, such as _Whitaker’s Almanack_, there is no trouble whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n=213. Ordering.=--The routine of book ordering should be reduced to the\r\nsimplest possible system. There are plenty of elaborate methods designed\r\nto find out and penalize defaulting assistants, booksellers, etc., but\r\nthey are not recommended. The very simplest plan is to place the\r\nproposition slips, when dealt with by the committee, in a special tray,\r\nor, better, drawer of a card cabinet, in a compartment marked “Books\r\npassed by committee,” and then to enter them in an ordinary order-sheet,\r\nof which a carbon copy should be taken, or which may be copied later.\r\nThese order sheets (8 inches × 10 inches) may be ruled thus:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |                      LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY                       |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |                               ................................19   |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |   M............................. will oblige by supplying the      |\r\n  | following books according to the terms of............... contract, |\r\n  | as soon as possible, accompanied by an invoice setting             |\r\n  | out the price of every single book, and the discount.

Where a duplicated (cyclostyled,\r\nmimeographed, etc.) list of suggestions is used for the committee, a\r\ncopy of this, with the committee’s adjustments, can be used as an order\r\nlist. The bookseller’s invoice and the books are checked by the\r\nsuggestion slips, and discrepancies of price or books not supplied are\r\nrevealed immediately. The use of books for entering lists, or for other\r\nlibrary record purposes, is gradually giving way to the more mobile and\r\neconomical systems to be obtained by the use of expansible files and\r\ncard indexes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Book-order Tray (Sections 213, 214).[7]]\r\n\r\n  [7] This illustration is retained because it illustrates a\r\n      satisfactory method of guiding; but this type of tray is inferior\r\n      to a special drawer in an “administrative” card cabinet. In such a\r\n      cabinet drawers would be assigned to (1) “SUGGESTIONS,” which\r\n      would include the slips for all books noted by the librarian for\r\n      consideration; suggestions by experts; by staff; incomplete works,\r\n      etc.; (2) “COMMITTEE DRAWER,” containing books “Submitted to the\r\n      Committee,” and “Passed,” and “Rejected” (with reasons), or\r\n      “Postponed for further inquiries, etc.”; (3) “ORDER DRAWER,” with\r\n      guides showing “Ordered,” “Overdue,” “Not Supplied” (when O.P.,\r\n      Binding, Reprinting, etc., the reasons should be stated and\r\n      dated); and (4) “ADDITIONS,” containing the slips of books added\r\n      during the year, after the slips have been used in the cataloguing\r\n      processes. After a year the slips are worked into the Staff\r\n      Catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=214.= When the order has been placed with the bookseller, the slips\r\naforesaid should be transferred to a compartment marked “Books on\r\norder,” and as the books are supplied they can be withdrawn and placed\r\nin a compartment marked “Books for catalogue.” This will leave a residue\r\nof overdue books, which can be overhauled at intervals, and, when the\r\nbooks have been written for, transferred to a compartment marked “Books\r\noverdue.” A simple form of tray is one divided by means of projecting\r\nguides to indicate the contents of each compartment (Fig. 61).\r\n\r\nThis plan of keeping check of books on order, at every stage, will be\r\nfound much simpler, and more accurate and convenient than any system of\r\nbook-keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=215. Accession Work.=--When a parcel of new books arrives from the\r\nbookseller, or a monthly lot of donations is passed, it is wise to enter\r\neach lot in a special book called the routine book, which will determine\r\nthe order of numbering, and give rough figures of cost and number of\r\nadditions to all departments. This book is ruled as shown in Fig. 62A,\r\nand explains itself.\r\n\r\nEach new book should be carefully examined for imperfections, etc.,\r\nbefore being numbered.

Other\r\nprocesses connected with book numbering for shelving purposes are\r\nconsidered in Chapter XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n=219.= The next process is the LABELLING of the books.

Some libraries add a label ruled in columns to show dates of\r\nissue, but this does not seem particularly useful. Lending library books\r\nare labelled with a label pasted down on the inside front board bearing\r\nthe chief rules for borrowers, and with a date label secured to the\r\nfront fly-leaf by means of a narrow line of paste on the inner edge.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                        |\r\n  |                       _No_......                       |\r\n  |                                                        |\r\n  |           METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF ISLINGTON.           |\r\n  |                    PUBLIC LIBRARIES.                   |\r\n  |                                                        |\r\n  |                      NORTH BRANCH.                     |\r\n  |             MANOR GARDENS, HOLLOWAY ROAD, N.           |\r\n  |                                                        |\r\n  | HOURS.

The absurd and\r\nmost inconvenient practice of publishing novels, reference books, and\r\nindeed any kind of work, with uncut leaves, is one which causes more\r\nwaste of time and irritation than almost anything else in connexion with\r\nbooks. A publisher may be justified in sending out special books in\r\nlimited editions with uncut edges and leaves unopened, but every other\r\nkind of book should have its edges neatly and smoothly trimmed and its\r\nleaves cut in readiness for the reader. It is cleaner and more\r\nconvenient, because nothing holds dust like the rough top and fore-edges\r\nof books cut with a paper-knife, and for this reason alone it should be\r\nmade a penal offence to issue books with unopened leaves.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                      |\r\n  |                      TIME ALLOWED FOR READING.                       |\r\n  |                                                                      |\r\n  | This book is issued for 15 days and must be returned on or before    |\r\n  | the date last stamped below.

A half-cut book is an abomination not to be\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nVarious kinds of stamps are used, ink, embossing and perforating. The\r\nink ones, usually applied with rubber dies, are not altogether\r\nsatisfactory when used with ordinary aniline endorsing inks, as they can\r\nbe erased. Printers’ ink is more satisfactory, but it takes some time to\r\ndry, and requires metal stamps to make it work easily. The ink used by\r\nthe Post Office when applied with a metal stamp has been found\r\neffective. But for their expense embossing stamps are most satisfactory,\r\nand of the various kinds of these the perforating stamp formed like a\r\npair of nippers is the easiest to apply. Whatever kind of stamp is used,\r\nit should be made in a circular shape, as in whatever position it is\r\napplied it never appears to be upside down or uneven, as other shapes\r\ntoo frequently do.\r\n\r\nEvery library should select certain fixed pages on which the stamps are\r\nto be placed, and every title-page, first and last pages of text, and\r\nall plates should be stamped. As a rule too much time is wasted in\r\nstamping library books, and it will be found quite enough to stamp the\r\nplaces indicated, and use a blind embossing stamp for the boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n=222.= In certain books it is desirable to insert special labels for the\r\ninstruction of the staff and as a gentle warning to readers; for\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------+\r\n  |                            |\r\n  | =Notice to Staff.=--This   |\r\n  | book is to be examined on  |\r\n  | its return to the library. |\r\n  |                            |\r\n  +----------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 66.--Warning Label.\r\n\r\nThis is especially useful in the case of books containing plates of art\r\nsubjects which are liable to theft or disfigurement.

Stock Book.=--This is the chief inventory or record of the books\r\ncontained in the library in every department, and should be ruled to\r\nshow the history of each book from its accession till its final\r\nwithdrawal. The intermediate renewals of worn-out copies need not be\r\nshown in this book, as they complicate the record immensely, and there\r\nseems no strong reason for doing more than noting the total number of\r\nrenewals in the Routine book, as already shown in Section 215. There are\r\nmany forms of stock books, but for ordinary British municipal libraries\r\nthe variety shown in the ruling on page 202 will be found, with its\r\naccessories, sufficient for every purpose.\r\n\r\nThere does not seem to be any obvious advantage in the American plan of\r\nprinting the accession numbers progressively down each page, as this\r\nrenders it impossible to re-enter a new book which has been given a\r\nwithdrawn number, and there is a decided waste in using up from two to\r\na hundred lines for a single work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=225.= The stock book now recommended can be adapted to any system of\r\nclassification, and when used in conjunction with the annual abstract\r\nsheets, ruled as shown on page 203, the exact position of the stock can\r\nbe easily and correctly ascertained.\r\n\r\n  +---------+--------+------------+------------+------------+------+\r\n  |Accession|Author. |Brief Title.| Place of   |  Date of   |No. of|\r\n  |  No.    |        |            |Publication.|Publication.|Vols. |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  +---------+--------+------------+------------+------------+------+\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  |         |        |            |            |            |      |\r\n  +---------+--------+------------+------------+------------+------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 69.--Stock Book.--Left-hand Folio (Section 224).\r\n\r\n  +-----+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------++------+\r\n  |Class|Binding.|Donor or|Date of | Price. |Special|With- || Re-  |\r\n  | No. |        | Vendor.|Receipt.|        |Collec-|drawal||marks.|\r\n  |     |        |        |        |        | tion. |Book. ||      |\r\n  +-----+--------+--------+--------+--+--+--+-------+------++------+\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n  |     |        |        |        |  |  |  |       |      ||      |\r\n\r\nFIG. 70.--Stock Book.--Right-hand Folio (Section 224).\r\n\r\n\r\n=226.= Every book received into the library must be entered in the stock\r\nbook, and a separate book should be kept for the reference and lending\r\ndepartments and for every branch.

This method of\r\nre-entering cannot be done with stock books having the accession numbers\r\nready printed, and librarians who use this form must make up their minds\r\nto run a very irregular series of numbers.\r\n\r\nThe whole process can be simplified by the use of a loose-leaf accession\r\nbook, such as the “Kalamazoo” ledgers. As entries become congested by\r\nthe substitution of other books for those originally stocked, the\r\ncongested pages can be re-written as a whole. A register of discarded\r\nbooks or withdrawals can be kept in a separate book--the superseded\r\nloose leaves can be filed for the purpose--if it is thought desirable to\r\nretain a record of books which have been and are no longer in the\r\nlibrary; but experience has not shown such a record to have any precise\r\nor practical value.\r\n\r\nAs in many other branches of library work, the tendency in accession\r\nwork is to elaborate every process instead of simplifying it. The\r\nsimplest form of stock book is that in which a specially ruled\r\ncounterfoil is attached to the order forms and which only provides\r\ncolumns for accession and class numbers, author, title and number of\r\nvolumes, publisher and price. After all a stock book need only be a kind\r\nof record of origin, and not necessarily an epitome, of the catalogue\r\nand classification. What a stock book is wanted for is to answer the\r\nquestions: When did a given book come; where did it come from; what did\r\nit cost; how many books does the library possess; what are they about?\r\nThere are so many records which give other particulars, that it seems a\r\ngreat waste of time to repeat a large number of the particulars given in\r\nsome stock books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=227.= The withdrawals book is the necessary complement of the stock\r\nbook, and in it is entered every book permanently withdrawn from the\r\nlibrary for any reason.

The Library Association, however,\r\nrecommends that in presenting public statistics of stocks, as in annual\r\nreports, there should be differentiation, and gives the following\r\ndefinitions:--\r\n\r\n“_Volumes_ mean books as they stand on the shelves. _Pieces_ mean\r\nseparate works or parts (each usually having a separate title-page to\r\nitself, as with pamphlets, parts of periodicals, and the like); _Papers_\r\nmean lesser items, usually with less than five pages, as broadsides,\r\ncards, flysheets and prints; _Items_ mean volumes, pieces, papers,\r\nlantern-slides, and generally all material constituting the library\r\nstock, and issued to readers; _Works_ mean whole literary productions,\r\nwhether in several volumes or only one piece. Thus--ten pamphlets bound\r\ntogether, with five broadsides at end, are one volume, ten works or\r\npieces, fifteen items. A dictionary in twenty volumes would count as\r\ntwenty volumes, pieces, and items, but one work, and in a sense one\r\nbook. Having regard to these definitions, care should be taken in\r\nrecording the number of volumes in a library, to reckon ten pamphlets or\r\nparts as the equivalent of a single volume.”\r\n\r\nThus, if these definitions are used, it becomes necessary to indicate in\r\nthe stock book the nature of the work; and to differentiate, one or two\r\nsymbols, such as p.=pamphlet, and pr.=paper, may be used; but if “p.” is\r\nwritten in the “No. of vols.” column to distinguish a pamphlet, that\r\nwill meet all usual statistical purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=229.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Dana, J.

Some of its uses are obvious to all readers; it brings\r\nthe material on any subject together on the shelves and in the\r\ncatalogues, and thus enables both librarian and reader to find books\r\nreadily. It has perhaps more important uses, because it enables the\r\nlibrarian, and, in open access libraries, the public, to see the\r\nstrength and weakness of the collection in various subjects; it,\r\ntherefore, is the only safe and certain means by which a collection may\r\nbe built up systematically, and may be increased. Moreover, it reveals\r\nthe obsolete books merely by bringing them into juxtaposition with books\r\nwhich have superseded them. An imperfectly classified, or unclassified,\r\nlibrary resembles chaos as nearly as anything can do, and want of\r\nclassification renders the finest collection of books useless except to\r\nthose who already know all there is to be known of any subject in which\r\nthey may be interested, and who can therefore find the books by other\r\nmeans. In short, classification is the primary key to the assembling,\r\nfinding, selecting and rejecting of books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=231.= It does even more than this. A perfectly or logically constructed\r\nclassification shows not only all the books on a specific subject; it\r\nalso shows the books which are collateral, or which lead up to and away\r\nfrom the books on the specific subject. It will readily be seen,\r\ntherefore, that the art of classification is one that must be understood\r\nthoroughly by the successful librarian. Several text-books have been\r\nwritten on the subject, and many articles have appeared advocating and\r\ncriticizing various systems. We can give here only a few leading\r\nprinciples, and afterwards discuss the four or five schemes which have\r\nreceived most general recognition from librarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n=232.= A classification system is a schedule or chart of knowledge\r\narranged in some logical order according to a definite and invariable\r\nprinciple. It may arrange knowledge by the historical, evolutionary or\r\nsome other and arbitrary principle, the choice of which is governed by\r\nthe rule that the order must be that which is likely to be most\r\nserviceable to the users of the system. Special classifications, such as\r\nwould be necessary for arranging a collection devoted to anthropology,\r\nor botany, or archæology, naturally arrange books by the principle that\r\nwill most clearly reveal their place in the progress of the subject\r\nrequired; and such classifications are merely mentioned in passing.\r\nGeneral classifications, which are the business of the average\r\nlibrarian, usually proceed in the historical or evolutionary order we\r\nhave mentioned. Their schedules consist of a number of general headings,\r\ncalled main classes, which are divided by gradual steps in accordance\r\nwith the principle employed until specific headings are reached. Each of\r\nthe headings must be exclusive of subjects not falling into it. In order\r\nto make this schedule of subjects practicable as a method of book\r\narrangement, it must be equipped with special “form” classes which\r\naccommodate general works, or works of so composite a character that\r\nthey do not fall into any of the subject-classes; and which also\r\naccommodate such aggregates of literature as poetry, drama, essays,\r\nfiction, etc., which are arranged by the form in which the matter in\r\nthem is presented, and not by the matter itself. Further, it must be\r\nequipped with a notation, or a shorthand sign for each of the subjects\r\nin the schedule, which may be written on the backs of books and in\r\ncatalogues instead of the names of the subjects. And, finally, it must\r\nhave an index which forms a ready key to the tables of the schedule, and\r\nis a convenient means of checking the placings of books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=233.= The theory of classification is a subject for special study, and\r\nthere are rules of order, division, nomenclature, notation and indexing\r\nwhich it is useful for a library student to master. As the ground has\r\nbeen covered adequately by the text-books which are listed at the end\r\nof this, we shall do better to refer the reader to these rather than to\r\nenlarge this manual by attempting to traverse it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=234.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Brown, J.

General.=--Quite a large number of classification schemes have\r\nbeen devised by Continental, American and British librarians, in which\r\nbooks are systematically arranged according to related topics, and\r\nmarked with a notation which enables any book or subject to be\r\ndistinguished by its number, for purposes of shelving, charging and\r\ncataloguing. All the best known of such schemes are described in Brown’s\r\n_Library Classification and Cataloguing_, London, 1912, and Richardson’s\r\n_Classification_, 1912. It will be sufficient to name the methods of\r\nHarris, Perkins and Smith, of America; Edwards and Sonnenschein, of\r\nEngland; Bonazzi, of Italy; and Hartwig, of Germany, which, with the\r\nwell-known French scheme of Brunet, make up a very interesting\r\ncollection of international contributions to the classification of\r\nbooks. None of these schemes has been adopted in more than one or two\r\nlibraries, so that their influence is not sufficiently widespread to\r\nmake any further description of their details necessary. It will be much\r\nmore helpful to librarians if the chief systems of classification are\r\nmentioned which fulfil every requirement as regards notation and general\r\nadaptability to library work, and have been put to the practical test of\r\napplication in a number of libraries. The systems in question are the\r\nDecimal, Expansive, Library of Congress, and Subject, the last being\r\nEnglish and the three others American. They have all been extensively\r\nadopted, and each exists as a separate printed work, with an index; a\r\nvital part of any method of classification. Unprinted schemes, or those\r\nof merely theoretical interest, have little practical value, and though\r\nevery librarian has his own ideas of classification, and generally\r\nmanages to graft them on to the scheme of some other person, and even to\r\nnibble away at his original, it is the best and wisest course to adopt a\r\ncomplete, printed and accessible scheme with as little modification as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=236. Decimal Classification.=--This, the most popular and widely\r\napplied of all library schemes, was invented by Melvil Dewey in 1873-76,\r\nand has been under revision constantly since, and is to-day in general a\r\nvery extensive and detailed scheme. As indicated by its name, the system\r\nis divided into groups of ten, and from this results an admirable\r\nnotation of unlimited expansibility.\r\n\r\nIts chief divisions are as follows:\r\n\r\n  000 GENERAL WORKS.\r\n\r\n  010   Bibliography.\r\n  020   Library Economy.\r\n  030   General Cyclopædias.\r\n  040   General Collections.\r\n  050   General Periodicals.\r\n  060   General Societies.\r\n  070   Newspapers.\r\n  080   Special Libraries.\r\n  090   Book Rarities.\r\n\r\n  100 PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\n  110   Metaphysics\r\n  120   Metaphysics: Special Topics.\r\n  130   Mind and Body.\r\n  140   Philosophical Systems.\r\n  150   Mental Faculties, Psychology.\r\n  160   Logic.\r\n  170   Ethics.\r\n  180   Ancient Philosophers.\r\n  190   Modern Philosophers.\r\n\r\n  200 RELIGION.\r\n\r\n  210   Natural Theology.\r\n  220   Bible.\r\n  230   Doctrinal Theology.\r\n  240   Devotional and Practical.\r\n  350   Homiletic, Pastoral, etc.\r\n  260   Church Institutions.\r\n  270   Religious History.\r\n  280   Christian Churches and Sects.\r\n  290   Non-Christian Religions.\r\n\r\n  300 SOCIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  310   Statistics.\r\n  320   Political Science.\r\n  330   Political Economy.\r\n  340   Law.\r\n  350   Administration.\r\n  360   Associations.\r\n  370   Education.\r\n  380   Commerce, etc.\r\n  390   Customs, Costumes, Folklore.\r\n\r\n  400 PHILOLOGY.\r\n\r\n  410   Comparative.\r\n  420   English.\r\n  430   German.\r\n  440   French.\r\n  450   Italian.\r\n  460   Spanish.\r\n  470   Latin.\r\n  480   Greek.\r\n  490   Minor Languages.\r\n\r\n  500 NATURAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n  510   Mathematics.\r\n  520   Astronomy.\r\n  530   Physics.\r\n  540   Chemistry\r\n  550   Geology.\r\n  560   Palæontology.\r\n  570   Biology.\r\n  580   Botany.\r\n  590   Zoology.\r\n\r\n  600 USEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n  610   Medicine.\r\n  620   Engineering.\r\n  630   Agriculture.\r\n  640   Domestic Economy.\r\n  650   Communications.\r\n  660   Chemical Technology.\r\n  670   Manufactures.\r\n  680   Mechanic Trades.\r\n  690   Building.\r\n\r\n  700 FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n  710   Landscape Gardening.\r\n  720   Architecture.\r\n  730   Sculpture.\r\n  740   Drawing, Decoration.\r\n  750   Painting.\r\n  760   Engraving.\r\n  770   Photography.\r\n  780   Music.\r\n  790   Amusements.\r\n\r\n  800 LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n  810   American.\r\n  820   English.\r\n  830   German.\r\n  840   French.\r\n  850   Italian.\r\n  860   Spanish.\r\n  870   Latin.\r\n  880   Greek.\r\n  890   Minor Languages.\r\n\r\n  900 HISTORY.\r\n\r\n  910   Geography and Description.\r\n  920   Biography.\r\n  930   Ancient History.\r\n  940   Europe.                     }\r\n  950   Asia.                       }\r\n  960   Africa.                     }\r\n  970   N.

Expansive Classification.=--This system was devised by Charles\r\nAmni Cutter, a well-known American librarian, and author of the code of\r\n_Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue_, which has been a text-book for many\r\nyears. The Expansive Classification has not been adopted to any extent\r\nin Britain, but is printed in a series of seven classifications of\r\nprogressive fullness, and completely indexed, and so becomes one of the\r\nmethods to be studied.\r\n\r\nAn outline of the scheme follows:\r\n\r\n  A       Generalia\r\n\r\n  A         General works\r\n  Ae        General encyclopædias\r\n  Ap        General periodicals\r\n  Ar        Reference works\r\n  As        General societies\r\n\r\n  B-D     Spiritual sciences\r\n\r\n  B         Philosophy\r\n  Ba-Bf       National philosophies and Systems of philosophy\r\n  Bg          Metaphysics\r\n  Bh          Logic\r\n  Bi          Psychology\r\n  Bm          Moral philosophy\r\n  Br        Religion, Natural theology\r\n  Bt        Religions\r\n  Bu          Folk-lore\r\n  Ca          Judaism\r\n  Cb          Bible\r\n  Cc          Christianity\r\n  Cce           Patristics\r\n  Ce            Apologetics, Evidences\r\n  Cf            Doctrinal theology\r\n  Ck            Ethical theology\r\n  Cp            Ritual theology and Church polity\r\n  Cx            Pastoral theology\r\n  Cz              Sermons\r\n  D             Ecclesiastical history\r\n  Dk              Particular churches and sects\r\n\r\n  E-G     Historical sciences\r\n  E       Biography and Portraits\r\n  F-Fz    History\r\n  F         Universal history\r\n  F02       Ancient history\r\n  F03       Modern history\r\n  F04       Mediæval history\r\n  F11-F99   History of single countries (using local list)\r\n  Fa-Fw     Allied studies, as Chronology, Philosophy of history,\r\n              History of civilization, Antiquities, Numismatics,\r\n              Chivalry, Heraldry\r\n\r\n  G       Geography, Travels\r\n\r\n  G11-G99   Single countries (using local list)\r\n  Ga        Ancient geography\r\n  Gf        Surveying and Map-making\r\n  Gz        Maps\r\n\r\n  H-K     Social sciences\r\n\r\n  Hb      Statistics\r\n  Hc      Economics\r\n  He        Production\r\n  Hf          Labour\r\n  Hi            Slavery\r\n  Hj        Transportation\r\n  Hk        Distribution, Commerce\r\n  Hm          Money\r\n  Hn          Banking\r\n  Hr          Private finance\r\n  Ht        Taxation and Public finance\r\n  Hu          Tariff\r\n  Hw          Property, Capital\r\n  Hz          Consumption\r\n\r\n  I       Demotics, Sociology\r\n  Ic        Crime\r\n  Ig        Charity\r\n  Ih        Providence\r\n  Ik        Education\r\n\r\n  J       Civics, Government, Political science\r\n  Ju        Constitutions and Politics\r\n  K       Legislation and Law\r\n  Kd        Public Documents\r\n\r\n  L-Q     Natural sciences\r\n\r\n  L       General works, Metrics\r\n    _Lb-Lg_  _Number and space_\r\n  Lb      Mathematics\r\n    _Lh-Lr_  _Matter and force_\r\n  Lh      Physics\r\n  Lo      Chemistry\r\n  Lr      Astronomy\r\n    _M-Q_   _Matter and life_\r\n  M       Natural history\r\n  Mg      Geology, incl.

Cutter, nephew of the author, but no parts have been published for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n\r\n=238. Library of Congress.=--This is the elaborate and detailed scheme\r\napplied to the great Library of Congress, and is the work of its\r\nclassification department. Its outline (1909) is based upon that of the\r\nExpansive scheme of Cutter which is shown above, but is varied to meet\r\nwhat are thought to be the special needs of the American national\r\nlibrary. Each of the classes has been published separately in convenient\r\nform with an index.\r\n\r\nThe main classes and divisions of the Library of Congress Classification\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n  A       General Works.

Subject Classification.=--This, the most recent British scheme, is\r\nthe work of the author of this manual, James Duff Brown; is a complete,\r\nhomogeneous, detailed and well-indexed scheme, and is selected for\r\nnotice as being generally applicable to British libraries of all kinds,\r\nalthough it is not likely to oust the Decimal scheme from its priority\r\nof place. It is based on the principle of placing all topics in a\r\nlogical sequence; of keeping applications of theory as close as possible\r\nto the foundation theory; and of providing one place only for each\r\nimportant topic. The complications and intersections of human knowledge\r\nprevent anything more than an approximation to this ideal, but it has\r\nbeen found in actual practice to be a classification scheme which works\r\neasily and harmoniously.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from its valuable introduction will give the best\r\nview of the principles on which the system is based:\r\n\r\n“THE ORDER OF THE MAIN CLASSES.--The reasons which determined the\r\nadoption of a certain sequence of classes in this system may be briefly\r\nset forth here, instead of any argument or attempt to justify the order.\r\nThe battle which has raged, and is still raging, among scientists, as to\r\nthe best and most desirable order in which to arrange the great branches\r\nof human knowledge in order to produce a ‘hierarchy,’ must deter a\r\nnon-scientific classifier from arguing on such a complicated and\r\ndifficult topic. It will, therefore, suffice if I briefly describe the\r\nmain classes in their order and give reasons why they were assigned to\r\nthe places they occupy.\r\n\r\n“A GENERALIA.--The divisions of this main class comprise most of the\r\nrules, methods and factors which are of general application, and which\r\nqualify or pervade every branch of science, industry or human study.\r\nThey are universal and pervasive, and cannot be logically assigned to\r\nany other single main class as peculiar or germane to it.\r\n\r\n“B, C, D PHYSICAL SCIENCES.--Matter, force, motion and their\r\napplications are assumed to precede life and mind, and for that reason\r\nthe material side of science, with its applications, has been selected\r\nas a foundation main class on which to construct the system.\r\n\r\n“E, F BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE.--Life and its forms, arising out of matter,\r\noccupy the second place among the main classes, and here are put\r\ngeneral biological theories and facts, followed by plant and animal\r\nlife, each in an ascending order from low to high forms of organization.\r\n\r\n“G, H ETHNOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL SCIENCE.--Human life, its varieties,\r\nphysical history, disorders and recreations, follows naturally as a\r\nhigher development of plant and animal life, and completes the\r\nbiological chain.\r\n\r\n“I ECONOMIC BIOLOGY AND DOMESTIC ARTS.--The applications of plant and\r\nanimal life to human needs, placed midway between the physical and\r\nmental attributes of man as indicating the primitive exercise of mind,\r\nand to assemble in one sequence the chief biological subjects. As a\r\nmatter of practical convenience, rather than logical necessity, it was\r\nthought better to keep composite subjects like Agriculture, Clothing,\r\nFoods, etc.--involving questions of origin, use and manufacture--all in\r\none place, close to the main classes from which they are derived, rather\r\nthan to distribute them more closely at Botany or Zoology.\r\n\r\n“J, K PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION.--Mental attributes, order and beliefs of\r\nhuman life, following naturally from its physical basis, and primitive\r\nmanifestation in the instinct of procuring food and clothing.\r\n\r\n“L SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCE.--Social order and laws of human life.\r\nPlaced here because, although society or family and other tribal\r\norganizations may have preceded religion, mind as embodied in philosophy\r\nmust have preceded both.\r\n\r\n“M LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.--Communication and recording in human life.\r\nThe spoken, written and printed word, which grew as a necessity out of\r\nthe primitive operations of mind.\r\n\r\n“N LITERARY FORMS.--The products of communication and recording in human\r\nlife in their more imaginative forms; placed here on the ground that\r\nfable probably preceded more formal history.\r\n\r\n“O-X HISTORY, GEOGRAPHY, BIOGRAPHY.--The actions, records and\r\ndescriptions of human life and its dwelling-place. Arranged in this\r\norder and at this place because of their intimate connexion. Geography,\r\nalthough logically related to Physiography and Biography to Ethnology,\r\nare, nevertheless, as a matter of practical utility, and because of the\r\nliterature actually existing, more naturally grouped here than\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\n“The order of the classes may, therefore, be briefly described as\r\nexpressing:\r\n\r\n  1. Matter.\r\n  2. Life.\r\n  3. Mind.\r\n  4. Record.”[8]\r\n\r\n  [8] From _Subject Classification_, by James Duff Brown, 1906, pp.\r\n      11-13; second edition, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe only serious objection which has been urged against this scheme is\r\nthe inclusion of Education, Logic, Mathematics, and the Graphic and\r\nPlastic Arts in Generalia. This course is, however, fully justified by\r\nthe somewhat amusing circumstance, that the critics are unable to agree\r\namong themselves as to the exact logical place of any of the series.\r\nWhile one insists that Logic should be placed in Philosophy, he is bound\r\nto admit that it ought not to be separated from Mathematics, while on\r\nthe other hand he cannot allow arithmetic, book-keeping and geometry to\r\ninvade the sacred temple of the philosophers. Education is even a\r\ngreater stumbling-block. It is variously assigned to Psychology,\r\nSociology, Philology and Ethnology by different critics, and Fine Arts\r\nis equally perplexing. In actual practice in a library, there is really\r\nno inconvenience felt in connexion with the distribution of any of these\r\nclasses, and as they do not originate naturally from any of the other\r\nmain divisions, but qualify and pervade the whole of them like an\r\nencyclopædia, or other general work, it will be found best to retain\r\nthem where they are. The other important features of this system are\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\nTHE CATEGORICAL TABLES form an important feature, whereby a separate\r\nseries of forms, phases and other qualifying factors are provided, which\r\ncan be applied to every subject, and so relieve the main tables from\r\ncongestion. They are applicable to the very largest libraries, and give\r\nample means of subdividing any topic, however large it may be. They can\r\nalso be used with other systems of classification, as they are\r\nindependent of the main tables and form a series of parallel numbers by\r\nwhich the classification numbers can be themselves classified. For\r\nexample, a library may have 1000 books on a subject like Architecture in\r\ngeneral, to all of which the simple number B300 would be applied. By\r\nadding the qualifying numbers from the Categorical Tables, which appear\r\nafter a point, and are invariably the same when applied to any subject,\r\nthe following sub-classification would result, which has the effect of\r\nassembling all related forms of books together:\r\n\r\n  B300    Architecture, General\r\n  B300·1      --        Bibliography\r\n  B300·2      --        Dictionaries\r\n  B300·3      --        Text-books, Systematic\r\n  B300·4      --            --      Popular\r\n  B300·6      --        Societies\r\n  B300·7      --        Periodicals\r\n  B300·10     --        History\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to those general works, the library possessed several\r\nhundreds of books on Building Construction, B305, these would be\r\nsubdivided in exactly the same manner, as would also any subdivision of\r\nthe same topic, such as Foundations, Walls, Roofs, etc.:\r\n\r\n  B305·1    Building Construction, Bibliography\r\n  B305·3       --         --       Text-books, Systematic\r\n  B305·10      --         --       History\r\n  B329·1    Roofs, Bibliography\r\n\r\nThese categorical tables are therefore of universal application, and as\r\nthey contain nearly one thousand qualifying forms, phases, etc., it will\r\nbe seen that their use will greatly simplify the practical work of\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the above examples, the symbols of the Notation are\r\nperfectly simple combinations of letters and numbers. By treating the\r\nnumbers decimally, it is possible to intercalate as many new ones as\r\ndesired between any of the existing numbers, thus providing an infinity\r\nof places.\r\n\r\nThe Index is very extensive in the number of subject-words it contains,\r\nand comprises practically every topic likely to be encountered in\r\nordinary practice. The Classification Tables themselves provide places\r\nsomewhere for every remote subject, and the Introduction describes how\r\nsuch out-of-the-way matters are to be treated.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to set forth all the features of this system of\r\nclassification--its elaborate series of _biographical numbers_ for\r\narranging Fiction, Poetry and other alphabetical classes; its new system\r\nof short _date-marks_; its rules for the _arrangement of special\r\nsubjects_, authors, etc.; and its notes on the simplification of the\r\nwhole subject of book classification. Reference can only be made to the\r\nSummary Table of Main Classes for an idea of the size and style of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY TABLE OF MAIN CLASSES, WITH ABRIDGED NOTATION\r\n\r\n  _Main Classes_\r\n\r\n  A--Generalia\r\n  B-D--Physical Science\r\n  E-F--Biological Science\r\n  G-H--Ethnology, Medicine\r\n  I--Economic Biology, Domestic Arts\r\n  J-K--Philosophy and Religion\r\n  L--Social and Political Science\r\n  M--Language and Literature\r\n  N--Literary Forms, Fiction, Poetry\r\n  O-W--History and Geography\r\n  X--Biography\r\n\r\n  A       Generalia\r\n  A0      Generalia\r\n  A1      Education\r\n  A3      Logic\r\n  A4      Mathematics\r\n  A5        Geometry\r\n  A6      Graphic and Plastic Arts\r\n  A9      General Science\r\n\r\n  B, C, D Physical Science\r\n\r\n  B0      Physics, Dynamics\r\n  B1        Mechanical engineering\r\n  B2        Civil engineering\r\n  B3        Architecture\r\n  B5        Railways, Vehicles\r\n  B6        Transport, Shipbuilding\r\n  B8        Naval and Military science\r\n\r\n  C0      Electricity\r\n  C1      Optics\r\n  C2      Heat\r\n  C3      Acoustics\r\n  C4        Music\r\n  C8      Astronomy\r\n\r\n  D0      Physiography\r\n  D1        Hydrography, Hydrostatics\r\n  D2        Meteorology, Pneumatics\r\n  D3      Geology, Petrology\r\n  D4        Crystallography, Mineralogy\r\n  D6        Metallurgy, Mining, Metal trades\r\n  D7      Chemistry\r\n  D9        Chemical technology\r\n\r\n  E, F    Biological Science\r\n\r\n  E0      Biology\r\n  E1      Botany\r\n  E2        Cryptogams\r\n  E3        Phanerogams\r\n  F0      Zoology\r\n  F1        Metazoa\r\n  F2        Mollusca\r\n  F3        Insecta\r\n  F4        Pisces (Fishes)\r\n  F5        Reptilia\r\n  F6        Aves (Birds)\r\n  F7        Mammalia\r\n\r\n  G, H    Ethnology and Medicine\r\n\r\n  G0      Ethnology\r\n  G2        Human Anatomy and Physiology\r\n  G3        Pathology\r\n  G4        Materia medica\r\n  G5        Therapeutics\r\n  G6        Functions, Organs, Osteology\r\n  G7        Nervous system\r\n  G8        Sensory system\r\n  G9        Respiratory system\r\n  H0        Blood and Circulation\r\n  H1        Digestive system\r\n  H2        Urinary system\r\n  H3        Reproductive system\r\n  H4        Skin and Hair\r\n  H5        Parasitical and Infectious diseases\r\n  H6        Ambulance, Hospitals, Hygiene\r\n  H7        Physical Training and Exercises\r\n  H8        Field sports\r\n  H9        Recreative arts\r\n\r\n  I       Economic Biology, Domestic Arts\r\n\r\n  I0  Agriculture, Dairy farming\r\n  I1  Veterinary medicine\r\n  I2  Milling, Gardening, Forestry\r\n  I3  Wood-working\r\n  I4  Textile manufactures\r\n  I5  Clothing trades\r\n  I6  Costume.

Adjustable Classification.=--The Subject Classification is the\r\nsecond scheme invented by Brown which has achieved success. The earlier\r\nscheme was the _Adjustable Classification for Libraries, with Index_,\r\nLondon, 1898, and is interesting as the forerunner of the much larger\r\nsubject scheme. Only the main classes are given here:\r\n\r\n  A Science\r\n  B Useful Arts\r\n  C Fine and Recreative Arts\r\n  D Social Science\r\n  E Philosophy and Religion\r\n  F History and Geography\r\n  G Biography\r\n  H Language and Literature\r\n  J Poetry and Drama\r\n  K Prose Fiction\r\n  L Miscellaneous\r\n\r\nThis initial alphabetic notation is divided by a progressive numerical\r\nnotation, of which the following is a sample:\r\n\r\n  D       Social Science\r\n\r\n      2-8 General\r\n    10-92 Manners, Customs, etc.\r\n   94-150 Political Economy\r\n  152-272 Government and Politics\r\n  274-354 Law\r\n  356-358 Commerce, Finance\r\n  400-424 Communications\r\n  426-484 Education\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n=241. Numbers.=--The class letters and numbers of all books should be\r\nwritten in the inside, preferably on the back or front of the\r\ntitle-page, and should also be carried on to the labels, book-cards and\r\nall other records. On the outside the class letters and numbers may be\r\nlettered in gilt or written on a suitable tag, which must be firmly\r\npasted on the back. The usual position for the tag is at about 1½ inches\r\nfrom the foot of the back, as this gives regular and uniform marking,\r\nwhich looks neat. Some librarians prefer a place at the top of the back,\r\nas the arranging number thus becomes more prominent, and the tag at the\r\nfoot is more subject to handling. The diagram shows the two methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Lettering of Class Numbers (Section 241).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=242.= In classification systems in which the class numbers are used for\r\ncharging and all other purposes it is necessary to provide a series of\r\nelaborate auxiliary marks to distinguish book from book in the same\r\nsubdivision. Thus, in the Decimal scheme, 621·18 is the number for\r\nbooks on boilers. If there are six books on this topic, some distinction\r\nmust be used in charging to enable the librarian to know which book has\r\nbeen issued. Mr Cutter has devised a table for this purpose, which is\r\nknown as the “Cutter Author Marks,” by which surnames are arranged\r\naccording to their initials and qualified by a number thus:\r\n\r\n  Abbott   = Ab2.\r\n  Acland   = Ac6.\r\n  Cook     = C77.\r\n  Cousin   = C83.\r\n  Crabb    = C84.\r\n  Gardiner = G16.\r\n  Gerry    = G36.\r\n  Gilman   = G42.\r\n  Shock    = Sh8.\r\n\r\nThe six books on boilers would accordingly be distinguished by receiving\r\nthese author marks, and the numbers might become:\r\n\r\n  621·18 Ab2      Abbott on Boilers.\r\n  621·18 C83      Cousin       „\r\n  621·18 G16      Gardiner     „\r\n  621·18 Sh8      Shock        „\r\n\r\nIn the Subject Classification these books when given the number for\r\nboilers, C210, could be further distinguished by the numbers of the\r\nbiographical tables, thus:\r\n\r\n  C210\r\n  ----     Abbott on Boilers.\r\n  3011\r\n\r\n  C210\r\n  ----     Cousin       „\r\n  3669\r\n\r\n  C210\r\n  ----     Gardiner     „\r\n  4565\r\n\r\n  C210\r\n  ----     Shock        „\r\n  7863\r\n\r\n\r\n=243. Book and Shelf Marking.=--It is better to have the class numbers\r\nstamped on the back of the book at once than to rely on tags or labels,\r\nwhich have a tendency to peel off. In some open access libraries using\r\nordinary gilt lettering, a subsidiary marking has been adopted to\r\nprevent misplacement and to aid replacement.\r\n\r\nThese marks are simple round spots of coloured enamel painted on the\r\nbacks of books, and they effectually prevent shelf being mixed with\r\nshelf and tier with tier. There are eight shelves in a tier, and eight\r\ndistinctive colours are used, so that no colour is repeated in the same\r\ntier, and they are varied in every succeeding tier, so that adjoining\r\nshelves will not correspond in the colour of their marking. As a further\r\nprecaution, the class marks are placed at different heights on the backs\r\nof the books in each tier, so that, even if a red-marked book from Tier\r\n1 were placed among the red-marked books on Tier 3, there would still be\r\na distinction. Of course the same level is maintained for each tier, by\r\nmeans of gauges, and the progression of colours is observed. When a book\r\nmoves forward to another shelf, the mark is painted over with the new\r\ncolour, and when the book is moved to another tier, the mark is\r\ncarefully scraped out and altered to suit the new location. As movement\r\nis not extensive in ordinary libraries, this alteration is only an\r\noccasional duty. The class numbers maintain the topic order on the\r\nshelves, and so the most common method of open access shelf marking is\r\ncomplete. It has been argued that the class letters and numbers are\r\nall-sufficient to maintain order in a library which allows readers to go\r\nto the shelves, but on this point experience varies. At any rate, there\r\nis no harm in taking simple precautions of this kind, which certainly\r\npossess the great advantage that if a book is misplaced it can be\r\nnoticed instantly and rectified. Uniform form marks require closer\r\nscrutiny, the use of colours demands but a casual glance. In closely\r\nclassified libraries where there is no public access to the shelves,\r\nsimple class numbers ought to be sufficient for staff purposes. The only\r\nadditional point is that, perhaps, the accession numbers should also\r\nfigure on the backs of the books, especially if an indicator is used for\r\ncharging in the lending department.\r\n\r\nCOLOURS.\r\n\r\n      Tier 1.

The best general guide is a plan of the department showing\r\nthe disposition of the books in the cases, and indicating the sequence\r\nof the classification by means of arrows. The plan of the Croydon\r\nCentral Lending Library may serve as an example. If the classes are\r\nindicated chromatically: for example, 000 red, 100 blue, 200 yellow, 300\r\ngreen, etc., the plan will be more easily followed. Such a plan, drawn\r\nto a large scale, framed, and hung in a conspicuous position, will give\r\nreaders a valuable conspectus of the department.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  |           =CHART OF SUBJECTS           |\r\n  |              IN THIS TIER=             |\r\n  +========================================+\r\n  | PHYSICS                                |\r\n  |   535 LIGHT                            |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  | PHYSICS                                |\r\n  |   536 HEAT                             |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  | PHYSICS                                |\r\n  |   537 ELECTRICITY                      |\r\n  |   FOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING SEE 621·3 |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  | PHYSICS                                |\r\n  |   537 ELECTRICITY                      |\r\n  |   538 MAGNETISM                        |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  | PHYSICS                                |\r\n  |   539 MOLECULAR PHYSICS                |\r\n  |   540 CHEMISTRY                        |\r\n  |   541 THEORETICAL                      |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  | CHEMISTRY                              |\r\n  |   542 PRACTICAL EXPERIMENTAL           |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 78.--Tier Guide showing Lettering of Front (Section 244).\r\n\r\nIn addition, a series of bold class labels at the top of each class, and\r\nplenty of topic labels on the shelves, together with the progressive\r\nclass numbers boldly printed, and fixed to the end of each shelf, will\r\nbe found a great help to understanding the classification and finding\r\nthe books. Shelf topic and number labels can be printed by the staff\r\nwith an ordinary rubber-printing or sign-writing apparatus, and they can\r\nbe fixed to the shelves by means of the label-holders mentioned in\r\nSection 249. For class numbers on the shelf-ends xylonite label-holders\r\nwill be found economical and convenient, as they can be cut into inch\r\nwidths. The above figure (Fig. 76) of a shelf-front with labels will\r\ngive some idea of the application of these marks. The class number of\r\nthe first or last topic only need be given. A method of guiding by tiers\r\ninstead of by shelves is described in _The Library World_ (Nov. 1904)\r\nand is one of many experiments which have been made with shelf guiding.\r\nThe illustrations (Figs. 77, 78) will show much better than words the\r\nappearance and possibilities of this system. Another form is illustrated\r\nbelow (Fig. 79) and shows a class label for indicating the chief\r\ncontents of a main class. The illustration of an open access lending\r\nlibrary given opposite (Fig. 80) shows the system of press guides used\r\nat the North Islington Library, which in practice has been found very\r\neffective.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                   |\r\n  |                      A                            |\r\n  |                                                   |\r\n  |                  GENERALIA.                       |\r\n  |                                                   |\r\n  | 000 GENERAL          500 GEOMETRY                 |\r\n  | 100 EDUCATION        600 GRAPHIC AND PLASTIC ARTS |\r\n  | 300 LOGIC            900 GENERAL SCIENCE          |\r\n  | 400 MATHEMATICS                                   |\r\n  |                                                   |\r\n  |    For Special Subjects _see_ Index to Subject    |\r\n  |                 Classification.                   |\r\n  |                                                   |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 79.--Class Guide (Section 244).\r\n\r\n\r\n=245. Shelf Register.=--The shelf register is a record of the books as\r\nthey stand on the shelves, and is the main guide used in stock-taking\r\nand otherwise checking the books. Cards are sometimes used for this\r\npurpose, each work being entered on a separate card, the whole being\r\narranged in trays in the order of the classification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Bookcase with Classification Guides and Shelf\r\nLabels (Section 244).]\r\n\r\nAnother method is to use shelf-register sheets, which occupy very little\r\nspace, a single sheet being used for each class division or subdivision.\r\nThe sheet is headed, as shown in the subjoined ruling, with the class\r\nletter and number, and the books in the section are entered in\r\nauthor-alphabetical order to begin with, afterwards just as books are\r\nadded (Fig. 81). The narrow columns are reserved for checking the\r\nshelves. The date of check is written at the top, and the presence of\r\nthe book indicated by a tick. In some open access libraries stock is\r\ntaken of the shelves twice a year by means of these sheets. Missing\r\nbooks are not ticked, but noted in order that further search may be made\r\nin the charging system and other records. When they turn up they are\r\nticked off. The sheets are collated periodically, and any books which\r\ncontinue to be unaccounted for are noted and entered in a special book\r\nruled to show author and title, date missing, and having a column for\r\nthe record of any subsequent facts, such as its finding, replacement, or\r\nother means of recovery.\r\n\r\n  <----------------------------------7″---------------------------------->\r\n  +------+-------+------------------+-++-----+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-----+\r\n  | Ac-  |       |                  |V||     | | | | | | | | | | | | E   | ^\r\n  |ces-  |       |                  |o||Mar. | | | | | | | | | | | |100·3| |\r\n  |sion  |Author.|      Title.      |l|| 6,  |   Dates of Check.   |     | |\r\n  | No.  |       |                  |s||1900.| | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  |.||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  +------+-------+------------------+-++-----+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-----+ |\r\n  | 5,216|Balfour|Manual of  Botany |1||  ✓  | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |15,621|Henfrey|   „         „    |1||  ✓  | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  | 5,111|Lindley|Elements of Botany|1||  ✓  | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     |9½″\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | |\r\n  |      |       |                  | ||     | | | | | | | | | | | |     | V\r\n\r\nFIG. 81.--Shelf-check Register (Section 245).\r\n\r\n\r\n=246. Dummies and Overflow Stock.=--Sometimes the library becomes\r\ncongested at certain places owing to limited space and rapid growth, and\r\nif discarding is not resorted to some of the less popular, or old, books\r\nmust be removed to a supplementary store. There is scarcely a library\r\nwhich does not possess a second classification stored apart, where such\r\ncrowded-out books are kept. On the shelf-register these books can either\r\nbe indicated by some such means as a red-ink cross, or they can be\r\nremoved from the original and entered on supplementary sheets. Dummies,\r\nsuch as those described in Section 247, can also be used to show books\r\nlocated elsewhere, especially in open access libraries, or lists can be\r\nmounted on cards and kept beside each tier. The question of surplus\r\nstock is one which ought to be dealt with on the broad lines of the\r\ndiscarding policy discussed in Section 199, but, of course, an actual\r\ndivision of stock caused by overcrowding must be treated as recommended\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nLarge and odd-sized books should be shelved in special presses, and\r\ntheir place in the classification can be indicated by means of dummies,\r\nas described below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Shelf Dummy for Book Shelved out of Order\r\n(Section 247).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=247. Shelf Accessories.=--For the purpose of maintaining order on the\r\nshelves and marking particular divisions or classes, various devices\r\nhave from time to time been introduced.\r\n\r\nDUMMIES are used to indicate the temporary absence of books, or to show\r\nthat particular works, because of their large size, are located on some\r\nother shelf. The simplest form of shelf dummy for classification\r\npurposes is a block of wood about 7 inches × 5 inches × ⅝ inch, painted\r\nwhite, or covered with white paper on the edge, and lettered with the\r\ntitle of the book which it represents. The title may be written on each\r\nof the seven-inch faces, in case the block gets reversed, and should\r\nalso bear a plain direction to the location of the book it represents\r\n(Fig. 82). [A similar dummy, bearing the classification number and the\r\nname of the division, serves as a good guide to the classification. The\r\nblock is inserted at the beginning of each new classification sequence;\r\nand both in this case, as in that of the dummy that represents books,\r\nthe dummy is too unlike a book to be taken for anything other than a\r\nguide.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Millboard Dummy for Withdrawn Book (Section\r\n248).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=248.= For books temporarily withdrawn a piece of millboard covered\r\nwhite on one side may be used in the form shown below (Fig. 83). This\r\nshould have the author, number and title of the missing book written on\r\nthe white side. One board of this sort can be used over and over again\r\nfor different books, by simply adding the new title and obliterating the\r\nold one. This board can also be used instead of the block above\r\nillustrated (Fig. 82) if space is a matter of moment.\r\n\r\nThe object of the tail in this form of board is to prevent the board\r\nfrom disappearing behind or getting lost among the other books. When\r\nplaced between two books, with the projection overhanging the front of\r\nthe shelf, it will always stick out so as to be seen readily, while it\r\ncannot very readily be pushed deep into the shelf because of the\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Xylonite Label-holder (Section 249).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Tongued Metal Book-rest (Section 250).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Flanged Metal Book-rest (Section 250).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=249.= LABEL-HOLDERS for keeping all kinds of classification or other\r\nlabels in place upon the fore-edges of shelves, close to the books which\r\nthey indicate, are made in various forms. An old form was made out of\r\ntin or thin japanned iron, with a pair of flanges on the upper and lower\r\nedges to take a card-label. This was screwed or tacked on to the edge of\r\nthe shelf and shifted when necessary. Another form of this holder is\r\nmade precisely the same as regards the turned-over flanges to form\r\ngrooves, but without the screw-holes, and has in addition a long\r\nprojection to slide under the books on the shelf so as to keep in place.\r\nThis can be moved easily, but it is very apt to be pulled out when books\r\nare removed. A simple, effective shelf label-holder is made from strips\r\nof transparent xylonite bent in a rectangular form, and pinned or\r\nscrewed to the under-side of the shelf as illustrated (Fig. 84). This\r\ncan be made to fit into shelves with either square or rounded edges, and\r\nkeeps the labels clean, as it covers them over. The advantage of this\r\nform of label-holder is that it can be cut with a pair of scissors or a\r\nknife to any size if wanted only for simple shelf or class numbers. It\r\nis also easily adjusted or changed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Combined Book-rest and Shelf Guide (Section\r\n250).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Yale Book-rest (Section 250).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=250.= BOOK-RESTS AND SHELF GUIDES.--Practically every librarian born\r\nbefore 1880 has invented a book-rest at some period of his career, and\r\nthere is consequently the less need for describing more than one or two\r\ntypical devices. The best-known form is the ordinary rectangular metal\r\nrest, which is made in several styles in japanned iron. Fig. 85 is the\r\ncommonest form, though it is objectionable, because books are apt to be\r\nimpaled upon the sharp edge and damaged, and occasionally the rest\r\nitself is lost. A better, though slightly more expensive, form is Fig.\r\n86. By reason of the flanged side there is no danger of books being\r\ndamaged, and this side can also be used as a classification guide if\r\nwanted to indicate where one class begins and another ends. A variation\r\nof the dummy mentioned in Section 247 (Fig. 82) is a plain wooden block\r\nmounted on metal angle pieces which can be made to act as a useful\r\nlabel-holder in classified libraries. The illustration (Fig. 87) will\r\nshow the form of this device.\r\n\r\nAnother form of book-rest or support is sufficiently described by the\r\nillustration (Fig. 88).\r\n\r\n\r\n=251. Book-Stands and Carriers.=--For desk and table use there are two\r\nvery convenient and adjustable book-stands, which will be found useful\r\nin public as well as private libraries. One is the American stand with\r\nadjustable wire compartments, which is useful for keeping books handy\r\nfor desk use or for sorting out cards, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Book-carrier hung on front of Bookcase (Section\r\n252).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Book-truck (Section 253).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=252.= The other is the English adjustable book-stand which is largely\r\nused for displaying and carrying about a few books for committee or\r\nconsultation purposes. As a table book-holder, this is probably the best\r\nand strongest form ever invented. As shown in the illustration (Fig.\r\n89), the uprights slide and firmly grip a large or small number of\r\nbooks, according to the capacity of the holder. This contrivance has\r\nbeen adapted as a library book-carrier, by having strong hooks attached,\r\nwhich fit into staples affixed to the fronts or ends of bookcases. They\r\nare very useful for classifying and arranging books awaiting replacement\r\nor shelving.\r\n\r\nThere are other forms of book-holders and carriers with fixed upright\r\nends, but they are not so satisfactory as the adjustable forms\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=253.= In large libraries a book-truck will be found a useful appliance\r\nfor moving quantities of books about, either for purposes of service or\r\nlocation or cataloguing. The design in Fig. 90 will explain this device\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=254. Author Marks:=\r\n\r\n  Brown, J. D.

General.=--Of the interior administrative work of the municipal,\r\nor even more of the university or institutional library, that which\r\noccupies most time and thought is cataloguing. A catalogue is properly\r\ndefined as an explanatory, logically-arranged inventory and key to the\r\nbooks and their contents, and differs from a bibliography in being\r\nconfined to the books in a given library. For its production wide\r\nknowledge both of cataloguing rules and of general subjects is required,\r\nand experience in ordinary reference work is essential. The staff,\r\ntherefore, to whom the cataloguing is entrusted should be highly trained\r\nand well educated; that is to say, that part of the staff which deals\r\nwith the final processes in cataloguing--the choice of headings,\r\ntreatment of titles, annotation, selection of added entries, and the\r\nfiling of the finished material. In large libraries cataloguing staffs\r\nare chosen with care, and cataloguing rooms are arranged for the work\r\nwith a careful regard to the value of natural lighting, of furniture so\r\narranged that the cataloguer has not to rise from his desk every time he\r\nwishes to make a reference, and, indeed, with the object of producing\r\nthe best results at a minimum expenditure of energy. Even in the\r\nsmallest library, where the librarian does the cataloguing, a\r\npreliminary attention to such matters as the construction of the\r\ncataloguing table and its accessibility to the inevitable cataloguer’s\r\nreference books, will save much labour hereafter. It may not be\r\nsuperfluous to add that as cataloguing is exacting work, it is fatiguing\r\nwork, and no assistant should be kept at it without variation for a\r\nlonger time than he can remain mentally alert and fresh. Eye-strain and\r\nfatigue mean inaccuracy, and at the best inefficient work, and seven\r\nhours is a maximum that should not be exceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n=257. Kinds of Catalogue.=--There is no more important decision that a\r\nlibrarian has to make than that of the form which the catalogue is to\r\ntake. A wrong choice here will produce months of labour to make good the\r\nerror. The choice will no doubt be influenced by the kind of public for\r\nwhich the catalogue is required. The public may be general in character,\r\nand within that somewhat vague definition may be artisan, or commercial,\r\nor what not; or it may be special--with a large number of students. The\r\npublic a municipal library has to serve usually combines all these\r\nelements; and in choosing the form of catalogue, a librarian may be\r\nguided by the desire to serve them all, but to emphasize the educational\r\nside of his work. The questions which a catalogue or catalogues may be\r\nexpected to answer are: what books has the library (_a_) by a given\r\nauthor, (_b_) on a given subject, (_c_) having a given title. Most\r\ncatalogues may, by the addition of indexes, be made to yield this\r\ninformation with varying degrees of efficiency. The various forms, and\r\nexamples of them, should be considered carefully before the choice is\r\nmade. Those most recognized are the _Author_ catalogue, the _Dictionary_\r\ncatalogue, the _Classified_ catalogue, and the _Alphabetical-Classed_\r\ncatalogue.\r\n\r\nThe _author_ catalogue is most valuable in the hands of literary men and\r\nof experts, but is of very limited use to the reader whose knowledge of\r\nauthors is small. It is simply an alphabetical arrangement of author\r\nentries of books, without any reference in that arrangement to their\r\nsubjects. The best examples of this form of cataloguing are the British\r\nMuseum _Catalogue of the Printed Books_ and the _Author Catalogue_ of\r\nthe London Library.\r\n\r\nThe _dictionary_ catalogue is the form most popular here and in America,\r\nand, unfortunately, is usually the most defective. As its name implies,\r\nit resembles the ordinary alphabetical arrangement of the dictionary,\r\nand embraces in one alphabet entries of authors, subjects, titles, and\r\nseries. The principle of subject entry is that books are entered under\r\nthe specific subject, and not usually under broad headings; thus books\r\non Trees are entered under that word, and not, as in a classified\r\ncatalogue, under their historical, or logical, place in Botany. The\r\ndictionary form is that most attractive to the general reader, and in\r\nits ideal form is a remarkably effective instrument; that is to say,\r\nwhen it analyses the subjects in books, and links all specific and\r\ngeneral headings by cross-references. The best examples are the Brooklyn\r\n_Library Catalogue_ and the _Index Catalogue_ of the U.S.\r\nSurgeon-General’s Library; and good English examples, which will repay\r\nstudy, are the catalogues of Bishopsgate Institute, London, and of\r\nHampstead Public Libraries which seems to be modelled on the Bishopsgate\r\ncatalogue. Objections to the dictionary catalogue are that it gives no\r\nconnected view of any subject and of its collateral subjects, that it is\r\nrarely cross-referenced adequately, that headings are chosen haphazard,\r\nand, what is its chief objection, if it is printed it is out-of-date the\r\nday after publication--an objection which does not apply so much to the\r\nprinted classified catalogue, as that lends itself to publication, and\r\nto revision, a class at a time. Librarians using this form should base\r\ntheir subject entries upon the _A. L. A. List of Subject Headings_\r\n(second edition, 1912) or the _Library of Congress List_ (in progress,\r\nissued in parts by the Library), as these will secure a choice of\r\nrecognized headings and save much labour in deciding between alternative\r\nheadings. The application of the Library of Congress list may be studied\r\nin The Library Association _Index to Periodicals_ (1915-16), which is,\r\nin the main, arranged upon it.\r\n\r\nThe _classified_ catalogue--the best accessible example of which is the\r\ncatalogue of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (1895-1902, supplements,\r\n1902-06 and 1907-11), while good English examples are issued by The\r\nPatent Office, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Islington (selected catalogue),\r\nBolton and Walthamstow--is gradually ousting the dictionary catalogue\r\nfrom the favour of librarians. In this form books are arranged in the\r\norder of the classification, in the perfect form in the strict order of\r\nit, and under each specific heading the books can be arranged\r\nalphabetically or (preferably) in chronological or inverse-chronological\r\norder, or in the order which places the best book first. Such a\r\ncatalogue shows the whole “family” literature of every subject in a\r\nlogical progression, and is therefore much more valuable to the student\r\nthan other forms. It must, however, be equipped with author and subject\r\nindexes to make it usable by ordinary readers who have not grasped the\r\nscheme of classification; such indexes are usually placed at the end of\r\nthe catalogue, or class if the catalogue is issued in class lists, and\r\nthe catalogue is prefaced with an outline of the scheme.\r\n\r\nThe _alphabetical-classed_ catalogue is one in which the books are\r\narranged under specific subjects and the subject headings are arranged\r\nin alphabetical order. Excellent examples of the method are the Library\r\nAssociation _Index to Periodicals_ and (with briefer entries) the London\r\nLibrary _Subject Index_, and the British Museum _Subject Index_. As the\r\nlast two examples show, this form is usually provided as an index to be\r\nused in conjunction with a separate author catalogue, but complete,\r\nindividual catalogues have been produced in this form. Its advantages\r\nare those accruing to the alphabet, rapid reference and easy\r\nrecognition; its disadvantages are the inevitable separations of allied\r\ntopics.\r\n\r\n\r\n=258. Annotation, etc.=--In all forms of catalogue the difficulties\r\nwhich have to be obviated are the lack of clearness of meaning in titles\r\nand of information as to the qualifications of authors, the scope, size,\r\n_format_, date and other features of books. These particulars can, and\r\nshould, be given as a rule under the principal entry of each book as\r\npart of the main entry; but to amplify such information,\r\nnotes--technically called annotations--are now frequently provided. An\r\nadmirable conspectus of the art of annotation is available in E. A.\r\nSavage’s _Manual of Annotation in Library Catalogues_, and the student\r\nis referred to that work. Here it will be sufficient to say that\r\ncatalogue entries should be as full in bibliographical particulars as\r\nthe means of the library will allow, and that notes, which must be as\r\nbrief as possible, should elucidate obscure titles, show the\r\nqualifications of the author, his method, elementary or otherwise, the\r\npreliminary knowledge required for the reading of the book, its place in\r\nthe literature of the subject, and the presence of bibliographies,\r\nglossaries, etc.; and should give, in the case of reprints, the date of\r\nfirst publication, and in that of revised editions, the nature of the\r\nrevision or editorial additions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=259. Form of Catalogue.=--Having chosen the manner in which his\r\ncatalogue is to be compiled, or, to adapt a term from classification,\r\nits inner form, the librarian has an almost equally important decision\r\nto make as to the manner of its outer form, or the way in which it may\r\nbe made accessible to his public. At one time every librarian aimed to\r\nproduce a printed catalogue as a matter of course and necessity, partly\r\nbecause MS. forms were imperfect, and partly because the universal\r\nprevalence of the barrier system made a key of which every reader could\r\nhave a copy an integral part of the charging. This view does not prevail\r\nto anything like the former extent, and the complete printed catalogue\r\nin book form is becoming less and less general. In some ways this is\r\nunfortunate, because the printed catalogue has the indisputable value of\r\nbook-form, homogeneity, and convenience both for consultation and for\r\ncarrying about; besides, it is a valuable bibliographical tool for use\r\nin all other libraries. At the same time, the great cost of the printed\r\ncatalogue, especially when issued complete in any of the alphabetical\r\nforms, and the irritating fact that in a growing library it is\r\nincomplete the day after it is published, have made it almost impossible\r\nfor public librarians to publish in this form. Complete printed\r\nclass-lists are a more satisfactory form, because each class can be\r\npublished separately and at such intervals as will distribute the cost\r\nover several years; and revisions can be made in similar serial manner,\r\nso that classes such as the Useful Arts, in which books most rapidly run\r\nout of date or are superseded, can be more frequently revised than\r\nothers. Most classified catalogues are issued in this manner. But, in\r\nspite of the admitted advantages of the complete printed catalogue in\r\nbook-form, the tendency is to depend upon complete manuscript catalogues\r\nat the library, and to advise readers of additions by means of a\r\nperiodical library bulletin, by duplicated lists, by lists published in\r\nthe local newspapers, etc. The open access system has destroyed the most\r\nimmediate necessity for the printed catalogue--the choosing of books\r\nfrom a stock which readers were unable to examine--and few libraries\r\nwhich publish such a catalogue can hope to recoup even a substantial\r\npart of the cost from sales. One or two libraries have a _selected_\r\nprinted catalogue, which contains the 10,000-20,000 invariable books in\r\nthe library--the classics in all branches of literature which readers\r\nhave a right to expect to find on the shelves--and depend upon MS.\r\ncatalogues for the stock as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n=260. Card Distribution, etc.=--In using the term “manuscript catalogue”\r\nwe speak somewhat loosely, in that the term usually covers any catalogue\r\nnot in printed _book_ form; hence it covers slip, card, sheaf, placard\r\nand various other forms in which individual entries may indeed be\r\nprinted. The most used of these is the card catalogue, in which each\r\nentry of books is made on a separate card, and the cards are arranged on\r\ntheir fore-edges in drawers or trays (but drawers preferably) in the\r\norder that would be used in a book-catalogue. The merit of this system\r\nis its infinite flexibility; for, as every book has its separate card,\r\ncards for additions can be inserted without dislocating the order, and\r\nthe catalogue can be kept up-to-date always. Several of the great\r\nbibliographical and cataloguing institutions have adopted this form, the\r\nmost important being the Library of Congress at Washington. This\r\nadmirable library not only prints its own cards, but offers copies for\r\nsale to other libraries at a low cost. In 1914 these cards were\r\navailable for 650,000 titles, and to these additions of from 50,000 to\r\n55,000 are made annually. As the cards are of standard size (5 inches ×\r\n3 inches = 12·5 × 7·5 cm.) they can be used in any properly constructed\r\ncatalogue. Naturally there is an emphasis on American books, but\r\nthousands of the cards apply to English books as well. Thus, for an\r\nexpenditure of about two cents per card, any library may have the cards\r\nfor its catalogues, and this is at a far smaller cost in labour and\r\nmoney than any individual printed entry can be obtained by any library.\r\nThe backbone of the system is the “unit” card; that is to say, one card\r\nis printed for a book and on it are indicated all cross-references,\r\netc., and extra copies of the card can, if it is thought necessary, be\r\npurchased and placed under the headings indicated. The Library of\r\nCongress issues advance proof sheets at a charge of $30 a year, which\r\nmay be cut up and mounted on cards as a staff catalogue, or as\r\nsuggestion slips, and from these may be learned the serial numbers by\r\nwhich cards may be ordered. In the United States several of the great\r\ncity libraries act as depots for storing whole sets of the cards, which\r\nlibrarians of other libraries may consult instead of proof sheets. This\r\ncard distribution method has thus been dwelt upon as it has as yet no\r\nanalogue in the United Kingdom, and it is to be hoped that some\r\njudiciously chosen great British libraries may act as depots for Library\r\nof Congress and other cards. Their use would save thousands of pounds to\r\nBritish libraries, as well as set free for other library purposes the\r\nhundreds of cataloguers in hundreds of different libraries who are all\r\nengaged in the wasteful task of cataloguing the very same books. Other\r\nlibraries which issue printed cards are the Institute International de\r\nBibliographie at Brussels, the Concilium Bibliographicum, Zurich, the\r\nJohn Crerar Library, Chicago, and Pittsburgh Library. About ninety per\r\ncent. of the municipal library books in the United States are covered by\r\nthe Library of Congress cards; therefore a certain number of cards have\r\nstill to be made by the individual libraries; and in English libraries\r\npractically all the card catalogues are so made. In some cases the cards\r\nare made by mounting entries from the periodical list of additions or\r\nbulletin, but usually the cards are written, hand-printed or typed. It\r\nis obvious that some system of card distribution from an authoritative\r\ncentre is badly needed in the United Kingdom as a measure of mere\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=261. Sheaf Catalogue.=--The second form of manuscript catalogue is the\r\n_sheaf_, which may be described as a book-application of the principle\r\nof the card catalogue. It consists of a sheaf or holder in the shape of\r\na book-cover which is fitted with locking rods designed to hold some 600\r\nor 800 leaves. The leaves are separate individual pieces of paper cut to\r\na standard size and punched with slots and holes to accommodate the\r\nlocking rods of the sheaf. The sheaf is arranged on much the same plan\r\nas the card catalogue, except that several books are entered on each\r\npage as a rule, and when any page becomes congested it is re-written as\r\na whole. It will be seen that this is the loose-leaf principle, which\r\nhas largely become so prominent in business methodology; and, indeed,\r\nthe sheaf-catalogue was undoubtedly the forerunner of the loose-leaf\r\nledger. It has most of the advantages of the card catalogue, occupies\r\nless space, and has the undeniable advantage of book form; but whereas\r\nin the card catalogue there is little or no re-writing of entries, in\r\nthe sheaf catalogue this must be undertaken at intervals. Of course if\r\none page were devoted to each entry, as one card is so devoted in the\r\ncard catalogue, the merits of the systems would seem to be equal, except\r\nperhaps that the card is of a more durable material than the paper used\r\nin the sheaf. But either card or sheaf is infinitely superior to any\r\nother form of MS. catalogue.\r\n\r\nA reference only is necessary to other forms of MS. which have been\r\nproposed from time to time, as none of them has been adopted by any\r\nnumber of libraries. The very old libraries occasionally use a slip\r\ncatalogue; the Bodleian and British Museum, for example, paste slips\r\ninto volumes or guard books resembling large scrap-books in approximate\r\nalphabetical order, and other libraries use similar methods. The system\r\nis a good one in many respects; the public understands and likes it; but\r\nthe catalogue runs to so many large volumes that its accommodation would\r\nbe a serious matter for the ordinary library; and the congestion of\r\nentries, with loss of all but approximate alphabetical order at most\r\nletters of the alphabet, will be obvious. Adjustments will be explained\r\nin the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is not the intention here to recommend any special method or form of\r\ncataloguing; individual library systems have individual needs; and no\r\nlibrarian should make so important a decision as to the character of his\r\ncatalogue without an examination of such catalogues as have been named\r\nand described. Our next chapter will illustrate the physical forms of\r\ncatalogue sufficiently, we think, for most practical purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=262. Codes and Rules[9].=--Whatever form of catalogue is chosen, the\r\nmain entry is practically the same for them all; that is, the author\r\nentry; and a whole literature of cataloguing rules and codes now exists\r\nwhich must receive careful attention.

Anglo-American Code.=--While the study of the above codes and\r\nelucidations is a necessary preliminary to the best cataloguing work,\r\nthey all lead up in general to the Anglo-American cataloguing code,\r\nwhich made its first appearance in 1908,[10] and at the time of writing\r\n(May 1919) is again under revision. It is a useful and happy example of\r\nco-operation between the two principal library societies of the world,\r\nand may be said to have laid the foundations of all future cataloguing\r\nmethod. It consists of definitions; 174 substantive rules, with\r\nvariations where the two countries could not agree, and where some\r\nrecognized authority such as the Library of Congress differed from the\r\nrule recommended; and appendices on abbreviations, transliteration, and\r\nsample catalogue cards illustrating the rules. A digest and criticism of\r\nthese rules, which are too many to be copied here, will be found in\r\nBrown’s _Library Classification and Cataloguing_, and will serve to show\r\nthe skeleton of the entries they provide, and will be serviceable to the\r\nstudent who reads it in connexion with the Code itself. The main feature\r\nof the Code is fulness of entry, involving various repetitions in\r\nplaces; for example, the author’s name, which is used as the heading, is\r\nalso repeated in the title.\r\n\r\n  [10] _Cataloguing Rules: Author and Title Entries._ Compiled by\r\n       Committees of the American Library Association and the Library\r\n       Association. English edition, 1908. (Out of print, 1919.)\r\n\r\n  LECKY, WILLIAM EDWARD HARTPOLE. The American Revolution, 1763-83;\r\n  being the chapters and passages relating to America from the author’s\r\n  _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_, by William Edward\r\n  Hartpole Lecky. . . . Arranged and edited, with historical and\r\n  bibliographical notes, by James Albert Woodburn. . . .\r\n\r\n  Added entry: Woodburn, James Albert.\r\n\r\nThe example will give an idea of the general treatment of a book and of\r\nthe use of punctuation. The three dots have a “separating” purpose\r\nmerely. Rules that differ from some in fairly general use are: 23, which\r\nprescribes that authors shall be entered in full and in their vernacular\r\nform with certain exceptions; 25, which enters compound names under the\r\nfirst part of the name and refers from the other part,--thus:\r\nBurne-Jones, Sir Edward, _not_ Jones, Sir Edward Burne-; and in\r\nparticular 33, which enters a nobleman under his family name and refers\r\nfrom his titles,--thus: THOMSON, WILLIAM, _1st baron Kelvin_; LUBBOCK,\r\nJOHN, _1st Lord Avebury_. Authors who have changed their names are\r\nentered under the earliest form, but the later name is added to the\r\nentry,--thus: SMITH, HANNAH, _afterwards_ Hesba Stretton; and married\r\nwomen are treated similarly. Pseudonymous authors are entered under\r\ntheir real names when they are known, with references from the assumed\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear that, in view of the impossibility of printing the\r\nAnglo-American Code in this chapter, it will be futile to give an\r\nalternative Code in a manual which deals with the general activities of\r\nthe profession. A brief Code did appear in the last edition, which was\r\npractical and simple, and reference may be made to that, but it is\r\nstrongly to be suggested that all future catalogues should be\r\naccommodated to the A.-A. Code in order that uniform methods of entry\r\nmay be perfected, catalogues may become more generally understandable,\r\nand a formidable obstacle to co-operative cataloguing be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=264. Bulletins.=--Since about 1894 a number of libraries have issued\r\nperiodical magazines, or bulletins, in which are printed lists of new\r\nbooks, reading lists on special subjects, notes on the work of the\r\nlibraries, and other matter likely to be of use and interest to library\r\nreaders. The first use of such a magazine is to supply readers with a\r\nregular supplementary catalogue of all book additions; a second purpose\r\nis to publish notifications of new rules or alterations in the working\r\nof the library; and a third may be to issue information about the work\r\naccomplished by the library. The greatest amount of space, therefore,\r\nshould be allotted to the description of new books, and annotations\r\nshould be supplied liberally to the entries which require them. The\r\nmagazine has the advantage over ordinary supplementary catalogues in\r\nthat it is issued regularly and frequently; and it has a valuable\r\npurpose in supplying printed entries by means of which the card or sheaf\r\ncatalogue can be kept up-to-date effectively. Copies of the magazine can\r\nbe printed on thin paper (preferably bank paper) on one side only, and\r\nthe entries can be cut out and mounted on cards or slips and inserted in\r\nthe standard catalogue of the library, whatever form it may take.\r\nEmphasis may be laid upon the special catalogues or reading lists which\r\ncan conveniently be published by this means. A special catalogue is\r\nusually a classified list of entries on the subject chosen in ordinary\r\ncatalogue form, of which several good examples appear in the Norwich\r\n_Readers’ Guide_. A reading list has a directive purpose; it is in a\r\nmuch freer form as a rule, selects the best books on the subject, and\r\nindicates the order in which they may be read most profitably, with\r\nqualitative and elucidatory notes. Examples of such lists appear in\r\nseveral American library bulletins, and examples readily accessible are\r\nthose in the Croydon _Reader’s Index_, a sample from one of which is\r\nsubjoined:\r\n\r\n=DARWIN AND THE EVOLUTION THEORY=\r\n\r\n=PART 1. INTRODUCTORY COURSE.=\r\n\r\n  For those who are unable to read very widely in the theory the\r\n  following are suggested, in the order given, as sufficient for giving\r\n  an accurate and fairly complete view of the question.\r\n\r\n  =Saleeby’s= “Organic Evolution,” a simple but interesting intro. to\r\n  the subject\r\n\r\n  =C=[11] 575\r\n\r\n  =Romanes’s= “Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution” is also a\r\n  brief statement of the primary factors of the theory\r\n\r\n  =CST= 575\r\n\r\n  =Clodd’s= “Story of Creation” is a popular but more extensive study of\r\n  the whole question of evolution\r\n\r\n  =CST= 575\r\n\r\n  =Wallace’s= “Darwinism” should be read as a direct intro. to Darwin’s\r\n  own works. Embraces researches made between 1872 and 1889, and answers\r\n  objections; it is popular in method\r\n\r\n  =CST= 575\r\n\r\n  =Darwin’s= “Origin of Species” is the epoch-making work in which, in\r\n  1859, he first fully expounded his theory of the mutability of species\r\n\r\n  =CST= 575\r\n\r\n  His “Descent of Man,” 1871, is an account of further experiments, and\r\n  more careful in style\r\n\r\n  =CT= 575\r\n\r\n  =Huxley’s= “Man’s Place in Nature” may be read as a suppl. to Darwin,\r\n  as the work of a brilliant independent critic\r\n\r\n  =CST= 573\r\n\r\n  =Romanes’s= “Darwin and after Darwin” carries on the theory to 1890. 3\r\n  v.\r\n\r\n  =C= 575\r\n\r\n  =Haeckel’s= “Evolution of Man” contains the view of the theory of the\r\n  first of German biologists. Principally a study of embryology. 2 v.\r\n\r\n  =C= 575\r\n\r\n  =Weissmann’s= “The Evolution Theory” is the latest re-statement of the\r\n  whole subject (1904). Is popular, and contains a study of the author’s\r\n  germ theory. 2 v.\r\n\r\n  =C= 572\r\n\r\n  If the reader is unable to spare time for reading all the above,\r\n  Romanes’s “Scientific Evidences” and Wallace’s “Darwinism” are perhaps\r\n  the most useful to the beginner.\r\n\r\n  [11] =C= = Central, =R= = Reference, =S= = South Norwood, and =T= =\r\n       Thornton Heath, the Libraries possessing copies.\r\n\r\n=PART 2.

Beagle’\r\n  [1832-36],” 1889\r\n\r\n  =CSTR= 508.3\r\n\r\n  This v. and the two succeeding ones were the outcome of a government\r\n  scientific expedition round the world during which D. was naturalist.\r\n  The results of the voyage were considered “the most important of\r\n  recent years,” and “it is impossible to overrate the influence of the\r\n  voyage on D.’s career. He left England untried, he returned a\r\n  practised and brilliant geologist. And above all he came back full of\r\n  the thoughts of evolution.”\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the additions catalogue as it appears in these\r\nbulletins may be gathered from the two following examples:\r\n\r\n=Philology.=\r\n\r\n  =Wright, Joseph.= Primer of the Gothic Language: containing the Gospel\r\n  of St Mark, selections from the other Gospels, and the Second Epistle\r\n  to Timothy: with grammar, notes, and glossary. 1899.

Some bulletins\r\nare wholly or partly supported by advertisements, and when these are\r\nincluded it is better that they should be on separated pages at the\r\nbeginning and end, and not, as is sometimes done, inserted in irritating\r\nmanner amongst the library matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=265. Preparation of Catalogue Copy.=--The quickest and most economical\r\nmethod of preparing catalogue copy for the printer is to do it as\r\nperfectly as possible, according to set rules of typing or handwriting,\r\npunctuation, type-marking, and revision. Irritations innumerable pursue\r\nthe librarian who allows copy to go to the printer which leaves anything\r\nto the imagination or discretion of that too often unjustly abused\r\nperson; printers’ corrections are an alarming addition to the cost if\r\nthey have not been anticipated; and what is and what is not a correction\r\nhas always been a matter upon which author and printer have rarely seen\r\neye to eye. If the copy is fool-proof and composition-proof the chances\r\nof corrections are reduced to the minimum, although it is impossible to\r\nremove them entirely.\r\n\r\nSeparate entries should be made for each book on slips, of uniform size\r\nto permit of rapid arrangement; and in most cases the 5 in. × 3 in.\r\npaper slips used for suggestions will serve, although where annotation\r\nis used to any extent the size is rather too small for type- or\r\nhand-written entries. On these the entries are made according to the\r\nrules in force, and if hand-written, they should be according to a\r\nstandard hand-writing. The models given (Fig. 91) are the best forms of\r\nhand-script that have yet been devised, and every beginner in\r\ncataloguing should be required to learn their use. If the slip is ruled\r\nhorizontally, with two vertical lines (a double margin) at the left side\r\nof the slip, it will be easier to regularize every entry by commencing\r\nthe leading word or name at the first vertical line, the title at the\r\nsecond, and leaving a horizontal line blank between the title and the\r\nannotation. Every type distinction should be indicated according to the\r\nstandard rules for marking printing copy (see Brown’s _Library\r\nClassification and Cataloguing_, p. 256, “printer’s corrections,” which\r\napply to the preparation of copy as well as to its correction). Finally,\r\nall copy should be checked microscopically before it is sent to the\r\nprinter, even if it has been written by the librarian himself or by the\r\nchief cataloguer. The slips should be arranged in order and numbered, or\r\nthey may be mounted on sheets of paper in columns of about ten or\r\ntwenty, in order to prevent loss. Two proofs at least should be required\r\nfrom the printer, the first in slip, or galley, form, the second in page\r\nform; it is better to have three proofs, especially if the catalogue has\r\nelaborate type distinctions, employs many abbreviations, etc. Moreover,\r\nthe most minute reading of proofs is necessary. It is really wonderful\r\nto what an extent errors creep into proofs, and the practice of the\r\nprinter’s reader who went over every page of proof however perfect until\r\nhe _did_ find an error, although it is a counsel of perfection, is\r\nsuggestive of what may be expected from the reader of catalogue proofs.\r\n\r\n  A B C D E F G H I J\r\n    K L M N O P Q R S\r\n    T U V W X Y Z\r\n\r\n  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n\r\n    o p q r s t u v w x y z\r\n\r\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0\r\n\r\nFIG. 91.--Hand-Printing for Catalogues (Section 265).\r\n\r\n\r\n=266. Printing Specifications.=--Hints on printing specifications\r\nrelating to catalogues can be gained from Philip’s _The Production of\r\nthe Printed Catalogue_ and from Quinn’s _Library Cataloguing_, but the\r\nspecifications there given must be adjusted to the special kind of\r\ncatalogue proposed. An excellent practical method of obtaining estimates\r\nof cost is to have specimen pages printed of the body of the catalogue\r\nand the indexes, exactly of the required model, spaced out with the\r\nnumber of lines per page. If the manuscript copy is not ready, estimates\r\ncan be obtained from the printers per page, according to the specimen\r\npages, and this is a fair way of tendering. If the copy is ready,\r\nestimates should be obtained for the whole job, including covers, in the\r\nstyle of the specimen pages. A printer can soon tell how much print a\r\nmanuscript will run to, especially if the copy has been prepared in a\r\nuniform manner, with ten or twelve slips mounted on the folio. A clear\r\nunderstanding as to payment for corrections and additions to proof\r\nshould be reached before the tender is accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=267. Co-operative Cataloguing.=--Efforts have been made from time to\r\ntime to obviate the duplicating of cataloguing work that occurs all over\r\nthe country, and in every country, and brief reference should be made to\r\nthese. The principal is the Library of Congress card-distribution\r\nsystem, to which detailed reference has been made. In Great Britain\r\nvarious attempts have been made, but chiefly in the form of annotated\r\nand classified lists of new books, which it was expected that libraries\r\nwould transfer to their own catalogues. Such lists were issued in _The\r\nLibrary World_ in 1901, but were discontinued for lack of support. Later\r\nthe Library Association issued such lists in _The Library Association\r\nRecord_, but in recent years this work, which is still done by members\r\nof the Association, is published in the form of weekly lists in strict\r\ncatalogue form (Decimal classified, and annotated) in _The Athenæum_;\r\nand _The Librarian and Book Selector_ publishes monthly annotated lists\r\nwhich are classified by both the Decimal and Subject classifications. In\r\nAmerica, _The A. L. A. Book-List_, _The Wisconsin Library Bulletin_, and\r\n_The Ontario Library Review_ all provide similar lists. Any of the\r\nentries in all of these is suitable for cutting out and mounting on\r\ncards or slips for insertion in existing catalogues.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of catalogue co-operation are those in which more than one\r\nlibrary has joined in the issue of a catalogue to cover the stock of all\r\nin certain subjects. A small example was the _Union Class-List of the\r\nLibraries of the Library and Library Assistants’ Association_, 1913; and\r\nlarger examples are the _Classified Catalogue on Architecture, etc., in\r\nthe Principal Libraries of Manchester and Salford_, 1909, which was\r\nedited by Henry Guppy and Guthrie Vine for the Joint Architectural\r\nCommittee of Manchester; and the Newcastle _Classical Catalogue_, 1912,\r\nwhich contains certain periodicals and books in the Armstrong College\r\nLibrary, as well as those in the Public Libraries. The most recent\r\nexamples are series of class-lists on important subjects such as\r\nInternal Combustion Engines and Aeronautics, both 1918, issued by the\r\nCommittee on Joint-Technical Catalogues, Glasgow, which bring together\r\ntitles from the libraries of eighteen institutions in that city,\r\nindicating the location of the various books by abbreviations added to\r\nthe entries, as:\r\n\r\n  Cassier’s Engineering Monthly. E. Kp. L. Ml. P. Pp. S. St. U.\r\n\r\nMany schemes for a national central co-operative catalogue have been\r\ndrawn up, and lie buried in the pages of library periodicals, until some\r\nfuture time when the benefits of such work will be realized and\r\nrecognized in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL METHODS OF DISPLAYING CATALOGUES\r\n\r\n\r\n=268.= We have dealt already with forms of catalogue to some extent, but\r\nthe five chief methods of displaying manuscript catalogues merit a more\r\ndetailed consideration and illustration. It is needless to attempt to\r\ndescribe every device which has been introduced for the purpose of\r\ndisplaying catalogues and providing for additions and expansion, and we\r\nshall limit our selection to those which are best known, most effective\r\nor most used. The five chief methods are the Page, Card, Sheaf, Placard\r\nand Panoramic, a nomenclature suggested in an article which appeared in\r\n1893 in the _Library_, pp. 45-66.\r\n\r\n\r\n=269. Page Catalogues.=--The most elementary form of the page catalogue\r\nis the ordinary manuscript book, with stepped thumb-index or simple\r\nalphabetical division of the leaves, so many being allowed for each\r\nletter of the alphabet. This is an unsuitable variety for a public\r\nlibrary, and should not be used for cataloguing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum public catalogue consists of large guard books, in\r\nwhich printed or manuscript slips of book entries are mounted on the\r\ntough cartridge paper leaves, so as to leave space for additions. When a\r\npage becomes congested, the slips can be lifted by means of a\r\npaper-knife, as they are secured only at the ends, another leaf can be\r\ninserted on the adjoining guard, and the old and additional slips can be\r\nredistributed over the whole of the newly created space. This catalogue\r\nrepresents but one alphabet, or copy of the catalogue, in some hundreds\r\nof volumes, and each volume only holds a small portion of the alphabet,\r\nas from Bal to Bec. One copy of the catalogue thus serves many readers\r\nat one time. By distributing the entries over a number of volumes,\r\ncongestion is less likely to occur than in catalogues complete in\r\nthemselves in one or two volumes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--Catalogue Shelves, British Museum (Section\r\n269).]\r\n\r\nA variation of this system of guard book is to be seen in some public\r\nlibraries where the whole of the catalogue is mounted in one volume. A\r\nnumber of copies of this style of page catalogue must be provided to\r\nmeet public needs, and it is, on the whole, a less serviceable and much\r\nmore expensive form than the catalogue on similar lines spread over a\r\nnumber of volumes. A good example of this kind of page catalogue is to\r\nbe seen in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, where it exists in the form of\r\nhuge guard books displayed on special stands.\r\n\r\n\r\n=270.= To overcome the difficulty of inserting additional leaves at\r\npleasure in page catalogues, various kinds of adjustable albums, with\r\nmovable leaves, have been introduced. At the Bibliothèque Nationale, in\r\nParis, and elsewhere a catalogue is used consisting of thick, hinged\r\nleaves, punched at the back and laced into the boards, or secured by\r\nmeans of a screw fastening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Adjustable Screw Binder (Section 271).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=271.= Another variety of this French binder designed to secure\r\nadjustability of leaves is that shown below in the illustration (Fig.\r\n93), wherein the leaves are clamped by the pressure of two wooden slats,\r\nwhich are drawn together by means of two or more endless screws turned\r\nby a key.\r\n\r\nFor this kind of binder it is necessary to notch the leaves to\r\ncorrespond with the screws.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the sheaf binders (Section 282) can also be applied to\r\npage catalogues, and very successful page books have been made up from\r\nthe form illustrated in Sections 286-87. The most recent methods of\r\nloose-leaf ledgers have also great possibilities for catalogues, and are\r\nprobably to be preferred to any book manuscript type other than the\r\nsheaf.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the devices just described are so arranged that leaves can\r\nbe inserted, to a more or less limited extent, at any point. The British\r\nMuseum type does not provide for unlimited additions, nor for any\r\nsubsequent division of volumes, without much trouble and rebinding. The\r\nFrench and other adjustable leaved binders do allow for unlimited\r\ninsertions, subject to the condition that the matter mounted on the\r\npages must be redistributed. In an adjustable book new leaves can be\r\ninserted at any place till the volume is full, and then the contents may\r\nbe divided and two books used, this subdivision and spreading being\r\ncontinued as the entries increase in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n=272.= A form of page catalogue combining the powers of inserting new\r\nleaves at any point, and moving single entries about without having to\r\npaste them down or lift them up, is called the Rudolph Indexer. It\r\nconsists in its book form of thick cardboard leaves, to which metal\r\nflanges are secured, down each margin. Each leaf is provided with a\r\ndouble-hinged fastening, which enables it to be hooked on to any\r\nadjoining leaf, so as to form a volume of any desired thickness, to\r\nwhich a pair of covers can be attached. The catalogue entries are\r\nwritten or printed on narrow cards, and these are slipped under the\r\nflanges, which secure them by either end. Fig. 94 shows at a glance the\r\nappearance of this form of page catalogue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Rudolph Indexer Book (Section 272).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=273.= There are certain advantages claimed for page catalogues which\r\nmay be enumerated here. The chief is that a large group of entries can\r\nbe scanned with one sweep of the eye, thereby facilitating the rapid\r\nfinding of any particular entry. Another is that, being in book form, it\r\nis more easily manipulated than other forms of catalogue. Its\r\ncomparative cheapness is sometimes put forward as an advantage over\r\nother forms, particularly cards, but on this point it is not wise to\r\nassume cheapness where so much time and labour are necessarily involved.\r\nAs regards the claim to rapidity in turning up entries because a whole\r\npage is exposed at a time, there are considerable doubts as to its\r\nsoundness. General experience of such catalogues as the British Museum\r\nis that, owing to the number of entries, the occasional congestions and\r\ndisorders where double columns of entries exist, it is more difficult to\r\nfind a given entry than in the case of cards or slips properly guided\r\nand in accurate alphabetical order. This point may be further\r\nillustrated by the case of men or women who are not adepts at using\r\nalphabetical lists, and who turn up a particular word in a dictionary\r\nwith much difficulty and loss of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Card Catalogue Cabinet with Sliding Extension\r\nRunners (Section 275).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=274. Card Catalogues.=--The card-index is the invention of librarians,\r\nand is perhaps the most important contribution to method that commerce\r\nowes to them. Cards for library cataloguing purposes were used in France\r\nin the middle of the eighteenth century; they were used in Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, early in the nineteenth century; and in 1852 they were\r\nintroduced into the Bank of England for commercial indexing. The plan of\r\nkeeping cards or slips on edge in boxes or drawers loosely, thereby\r\ngiving unlimited means of expansion and intercalation, must have\r\noccurred to many minds as the best means of maintaining perpetual\r\nalphabetical order. Single cards not attached in any way, save\r\ntemporarily, possess unlimited powers of movability, and can be arranged\r\nin any kind of order when assembled in numbers, because each card can be\r\ntaken away or moved about or fresh cards added at any point in a series,\r\nwithout upsetting any adjoining card, or interrupting alphabetical\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe cards, when arranged in alphabetical order, are separated into small\r\ndivisions by means of projecting guides, on which are printed subject or\r\nauthor or other words or class numbers, which serve the same purpose as\r\nthe running catch-words of a dictionary, only they are much more\r\neffective, because more conspicuous. They are secured by means of a rod\r\nwhich passes through holes punched in the lower part of the cards, and\r\nthe rod is either locked or screwed into the back or front of the\r\ndrawer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=275.= The usual plan is to store the cards in the drawers of a cabinet,\r\nmarking the contents of each drawer plainly on the outside. Fig. 95 is\r\nan illustration of a card cabinet, showing the usual guides and sliding\r\nrunners to enable the whole extent of a drawer to be pulled free of the\r\ncabinet for purposes of examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Cabinet of Card Trays (Section 276).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Sideless Card Catalogue Tray (Section 276).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=276.= Another form, which is illustrated above (Fig. 96), shows\r\nvarious improvements, including an adjustable angle-block, for\r\nsupporting the cards at a suitable angle for easy consultation: this can\r\nbe screwed up tight at any point in a drawer, so as to hold a smaller or\r\nlarger number of cards in place; a special form of rod on which the\r\ncards are strung or filed, easily removable, but still capable of\r\nsafeguarding them against misuse or misplacement; a special automatic\r\ncatch at the front of the drawer to prevent it being pulled out\r\naccidentally, but which does not prevent any drawer from being taken\r\naway from the cabinet if required. Another important improvement\r\nintroduced in 1902 was the modification in the sides of trays, whereby\r\nthe woodwork was cut down so as to lighten the tray and enable the cards\r\nto be handled from the sides as well as the top. This variety is known\r\nas the “Sideless Tray” (Fig. 97).\r\n\r\n\r\n=277.= The card catalogue in cabinets of fixed drawers is not, in some\r\nways, such an effective arrangement as detachable trays or drawers\r\nstored in a suitable rack or cabinet. The fixed-drawer plan has various\r\ndisadvantages, chief among which is the serious one that a single person\r\nconsulting a cabinet may monopolize from 6000 to 10,000 entries,\r\naccording to the number of drawers forming a tier. Where there are four\r\nto six drawers in a tier it is impossible to adjust them so that both\r\ntall and short persons will find them equally accessible; and only a few\r\npersons can use the catalogue at one time, as two persons will\r\npractically cover up three tiers, thus in some cases cutting off from\r\nother users at least 20,000 or more entries. There is also the\r\ndifficulty of filling up application forms for books, as no proper\r\nwriting surfaces are available, although some modern cabinets have a\r\nhorizontal shelf which slides in and out as required from the centre or\r\nfrom beneath the cabinet, as shown in Fig. 95. In addition there is the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining a good light on the lower drawers, and the large\r\namount of space occupied by a large cabinet. To meet these difficulties\r\ncard cabinets should be placed most carefully so that the person of\r\naverage height can consult all drawers without trouble; and the\r\nextension shelf just mentioned should be provided; or, the cabinets\r\nshould stand upon a table the top of which projects in front of them\r\nsufficiently to permit of drawers withdrawn from the cabinet being\r\nplaced upon them. This shelf or table provides the desired writing\r\nsurface; and small paper note-blocks on which readers can note catalogue\r\nparticulars are part of the table equipment.\r\n\r\nWhen printed entries are mounted on blank cards, it is advisable to\r\n“guard” them, in order to balance the additional thickness of the upper\r\npart, which causes bulging, by pricking the fronts of the cards, or\r\nembossing them by means of a blunt awl, thus:\r\n\r\n  | Embossed            Hole            Embossed |\r\n  |   dent                                dent   |\r\n  |                                              |\r\n  |    ●                 ○                  ●    |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nA similar result may be obtained by pasting strips of paper of similar\r\nquality to that on which the printed entries are mounted on the lower\r\npart of the back of the card.\r\n\r\n=278.= Various kinds of trays, described and figured below, are intended\r\nto replace the “cabinet” system; but it is clear that if every drawer is\r\neasily detached from a cabinet and if suitable table space is available\r\ntheir advantages are more theoretical than real. A good form, which is\r\nwell safeguarded and not too heavy or clumsy, will be found in a tray\r\nwhich is provided with all necessary accessories in the form of\r\nlocking-rod, guides, adjustable angle-block, outside label-holder, and\r\nfelt pads to prevent it from scratching table-tops or other furniture.\r\nThis kind of tray can be kept in racks of a convenient size, and users\r\ncan remove it to a table for consultation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--Cards for Bonnange Catalogue Trays (Section\r\n279).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=279.= A French form of card-catalogue tray was invented by Mr F.\r\nBonnange, of Paris, in 1866, and improved in 1874. In this, the method\r\nof securing the card differs from the rod threading through\r\nperforations, as in English and American models. The cards are hinged,\r\nand have shoulders formed in the slightly thicker lower portion, as\r\nshown in the illustration (Fig. 98), which is also slotted to clear the\r\nfastening. The hinged cards shoulder into side grooves formed in the\r\nwooden trays, and the slotted portion is placed astride a powerful\r\nendless screw, which traverses the tray from end to end, and carries a\r\nsuitable block which acts as a travelling clamp. The screw is worked by\r\nmeans of a key, and when turned to the right the block travels forward\r\nalong the screw till the cards are all firmly clamped between it and the\r\nend of the tray; when turned to the left the block travels back and so\r\nreleases the cards to enable insertions to be made. The upper portion of\r\nthe cards being hinged, and consequently free of the block, are not\r\nclamped, and can be turned over readily for purposes of consultation.\r\nGuides, alphabetical or numerical, may be inserted either above or at\r\neither side of the cards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Bonnange Card Catalogue Trays (Section 279).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=280.= An Italian card tray on a somewhat similar principle to this was\r\ninvented by Mr A. Staderini, of Rome, in 1890. It differs from the\r\nBonnange tray in having a sliding-block gearing with a ratchet which is\r\nfastened along the bottom and made to engage or disengage with a key.\r\nThe cards are similar in principle to those of the Bonnange system, save\r\nthat the lower hinged half is not slotted. The illustration (Fig. 100)\r\nwill explain better than words the appearance and other accessories of\r\nthis tray.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Staderini Card Trays and Hinged Card (Section\r\n280).]\r\n\r\nBoth the Bonnange and Staderini methods share in common an advantage of\r\nsome importance, viz., the clamped lower portion of the card forms a\r\ncounterfoil to show what has been taken, should a card by accident or\r\ndesign be removed or torn off. The accession number or brief title of\r\nthe book can be written on the clamped portion of the card, and so will\r\nsafeguard against loss and imperfections. This is an advantage not\r\npossessed by any of the ordinary card methods, because when cards are\r\ntorn from the rods they leave no trace, and become lost for ever,\r\nleaving it very problematical whether a catalogue is perfect or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=281.= A card catalogue on a somewhat similar principle to the French\r\nand Italian forms just described is known as the Duplex Card Catalogue,\r\nand was invented in England to enable both sides of the cards to be\r\nused, thereby considerably enlarging the capacity of the catalogue,\r\nwhile materially reducing its bulk. It is fitted with falling ends which\r\nact as angle-blocks; a travelling angle-block can be adjusted and locked\r\nat any point; a locking-rod for threading the cards upon in order to\r\nsecure them; and xylonite label-holders. The cards are larger than\r\nordinary catalogue cards, and instead of being hinged are simply creased\r\nat a short distance above the rod holes. This gives a slight bulge and\r\nenables the cards to have the necessary play. The trays are held\r\nlengthways in a position parallel to the body, instead of at right\r\nangles as in the case of ordinary trays, and the cards or leaves are\r\nsimply turned over like those of a book.\r\n\r\nAn extended, illustrated study of the whole of card-cataloguing\r\nmethodology is Sayers and Stewart’s _The Card Catalogue_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Duplex Card Catalogue (Section 281).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=282. Sheaf Catalogues.=--The sheaf catalogue is not so widely used as\r\nthe card system in Britain, but, as we have shown, it has exactly the\r\nsame advantages as regards the power of expansion and intercalation. It\r\naims at combining the advantages of both book and card catalogues, by\r\ndividing the catalogue into handy sections so that the maximum number of\r\nreaders can consult it at one time; providing means for continuous\r\nexpansion in alphabetical order; safeguarding the contents of sections;\r\nreducing the amount of storage space occupied; and enabling users to\r\nhandle and turn over the catalogue like the leaves of an ordinary book.\r\nThe introduction of ordinary paper slips, which can be used in any\r\ntypewriter, which can be easily stored in various forms of binders in\r\nbook form, and which can be added to in manuscript without undoing the\r\nholder, is a real economy in library administration which has not\r\nreceived the attention it deserves. While 1000 entries in a card\r\ncatalogue will occupy from 750 to 840 cubic inches of space, the\r\nsheaf-holders most in use will not take up more than fifty-six cubic\r\ninches of space for the same number of entries. The writing surfaces are\r\nalso much larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Leyden Slip Holder (Section 283).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=283.= The slip catalogue known as the Leyden, from its first use in the\r\nUniversity Library of Leyden, in Holland, in 1871, consists of bundles\r\nof slips, notched as shown in the illustration (Fig. 102), and secured\r\nby means of cord or catgut. The outer boards are hinged, and notched to\r\ncorrespond with the slips, and the cord is tied firmly round the volume\r\nand into the slots, so as to bind the whole. These Leyden holders are\r\nonly adapted for private or staff use, and must be kept in very thin\r\nsections, as the volumes get more loose and insecure the thicker they\r\nare made. As a means of holding any kind of temporary slip, this is,\r\nhowever, a useful device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--Volume of Staderini Sheaf Catalogue (Section\r\n284).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=284.= A much more mechanically perfect slip catalogue-holder is the\r\nscrew-binder invented by Mr A. Staderini, of Rome. It comprises a fixed\r\nback and boards, to which two iron screw-bolts are attached. On these\r\nthe slips, which are perforated to correspond with the bolts, are\r\nthreaded, and the books are secured by means of brass screw-caps which\r\nfasten the boards to the bolts, and so make the volume rigid and the\r\nslips secure. These volumes are numbered and kept in pigeon-holes, which\r\nbear the volume numbers and letters denoting the section of the alphabet\r\ncontained in each sheaf (Figs. 103-104).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--Staderini Sheaf Catalogue in the Victor\r\nEmmanuel Library, Rome (Section 284).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=285.= A “sheaf”-holder on exactly the same principle, but with a\r\ndifferent and neater fastening, was invented in 1891 by Mrs\r\nSacconi-Ricci, of Florence. This holder also fits into numbered\r\npigeon-holes, and consists of perforated slips threaded on to two\r\nupright rods, which are kept in place by means of a sliding bar which,\r\nwhen screwed into place, locks the slips and boards into one compact\r\nvolume (Fig. 105).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Sacconi Sheaf Catalogue (Section 285).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Adjustable Sheaf Catalogue, Clamp Fastening\r\n(Section 286).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=286.= The most used and oldest of the British sheaf catalogues is the\r\n“Adjustable Catalogue-Holder,” which was invented about 1892. This has a\r\nflexible leather back, and the slips are bound and unbound by the\r\ncontracting and expanding action of two cylindrical screws, turned by\r\nmeans of a metal key. It is not necessary, as in the case of all other\r\nsheaf-holders, to undo this one in order to remove the slips when\r\nadditions are being made, the loosening of the screws being all that is\r\nnecessary. The slips are punched at the back edge with bayonet-shaped or\r\nkeyed slots, which give sufficient holding power when the screws are\r\ntightened to clamp the boards and slips into one solid and firm volume.\r\nThe book numbers, if written on the clamped portion of the slips, will\r\nremain in the sheaf if entries should be wilfully torn out, and no\r\ncatalogue could be rendered imperfect without the knowledge of the\r\nlibrarian. Xylonite label-holders are attached to the back of this form\r\nof sheaf, which enable contents labels to be changed at will, without\r\npasting or damaging the back. A rack or pigeon-holes can be provided in\r\nwhich to store these sheafs in numbered, alphabetical or class order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Adjustable Sheaf Catalogue, Open for\r\nConsultation (Section 287).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Adjustable Sheaf Catalogue, Open for making\r\nAdditions with Cradle and Key (Section 287).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=287.= The most recent form of catalogue sheaf is that illustrated in\r\nFigs. 107-8. It differs from the adjustable in having a rigid back, and\r\nbut one screw. In other respects it is perhaps easier to manipulate than\r\nthe binders just described.\r\n\r\nThe holder consists of a strong wooden back to which two stout covers\r\nare attached by means of hinges, specially designed to guard against\r\ninjury to the covers. Within the holder a special form of brass\r\nscrew-fitting is mounted, upon which the slips are threaded, so that\r\nwhen the covers are closed the whole sheaf is firmly secured by means of\r\na special screw. A few turns of the key suffices to lock or open the\r\nholder.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                                                      Oliphant   |\r\n  |                                                         (Mrs.)  |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                             Adam Graeme.

These\r\nsheaves can be kept on the shelves with their classes. To this an author\r\nand title index can be provided in one alphabet, each author being kept\r\non one slip or more, and both sides of the slips being used to ensure\r\neconomy of space, and enable readers to find at once any particular\r\nbook. Thus, on the front of the slip an author entry might appear as in\r\nFig. 109, while on the back, or reverse side, the titles would be\r\ncontinued as on Fig. 110.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                                                             Old |\r\n  |                  Old court suburb, by Hunt              U906    |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                  Old curiosity shop, by Dickens         Fiction |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                  Old dominion, by Johnston              Fiction |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                  Old Mortality, by Scott                Fiction |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                  Old world in its new face, by Bellows  Q037    |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  |                        [_and so on_]                            |\r\n  |                                                         _OVER_  |\r\n  |                                                                 |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 111.--Sheaf Catalogue Title Slip (Section 288).\r\n\r\nThe matter of strict alphabetical order in such index slips is of little\r\nconsequence, owing to the concentration of entries which enables a\r\nconsultor to note the contents with one sweep of the eye.\r\n\r\nTitle entries can be done in similar fashion, the leading word being\r\nused as the index or catch-heading, as in Fig. 111.

But it is at best doubtful if this is\r\nnecessary save in very large subjects. For example, entries like the\r\nabove are quite easily discovered (Fig. 112).\r\n\r\nWhere annotations on a large scale are employed, it is best to make use\r\nof a separate slip for each entry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Adjustable Placard Catalogue (Section 289).]\r\n\r\nIn all kinds of sheaf catalogues a fair margin should be allowed round\r\nthe entries, to preserve them against finger-marks.\r\n\r\nThe slips are punched so as to secure absolute uniformity in size and in\r\nthe position of the holes. The hole being made in an oval form allows\r\nthe slips to be easily threaded on, or removed from the screw-fitting.\r\n\r\nThe special construction of the holders prevents the slips from sagging\r\nor drooping at their free ends, a fault observable in both the Staderini\r\nand Sacconi forms. It is usual to “guide” all forms of sheaf or slip\r\ncatalogues, by boldly writing catchwords on both outer corners of each\r\nleaf (see Figs. 109-10, 112), and indicating the contents by means of\r\nthe xylonite label-holders on the backs.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of sheaf-cataloguing methodology is explained and\r\nillustrated in Stewart’s _The Sheaf Catalogue_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=289. Placard Catalogues.=--The most ordinary form of placard catalogue\r\nis a manuscript or printed list of books on a large sheet or sheets,\r\nwhich is framed and hung on the wall where readers can see it. There are\r\nseveral varieties of these framed lists, which are used chiefly for\r\nlists of additions. A form giving the power of moving single entries has\r\nbeen devised in England which is better than anything else usually seen.\r\nThis consists of a frame with a movable back, on which vertical xylonite\r\nslips are fastened in such a way as to form long columns with flanged\r\nsides. Under the flanges can be slipped pieces of cardboard the width of\r\nthe columns, which slide up and down in the length of the column as\r\nrequired. The titles of new books can be written on these cards and\r\narranged in any order. If blank cards are left between every letter of\r\nthe alphabet or every class, additional entries can be added at any\r\nmoment. If several frames are used, some hundreds of new books can be\r\ncatalogued, and when full the entries can be transferred to the printed\r\nbulletin, or otherwise utilized, to free the frames for further\r\nadditions. The illustration given above will show the nature of this\r\nadjustable accessions catalogue, which corresponds in principle with the\r\nadjustable Periodical List.\r\n\r\n\r\n=290. Panoramic Catalogues.=--Several methods have been proposed or\r\ndevised for displaying catalogue entries on an endless chain in a\r\npanoramic or continuous form, but none of them has been generally\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY (CHAPTERS XVI.-XVIII.)\r\n\r\nThe principal literature of the subject of cataloguing has been\r\nmentioned in the text, and much of the best, more recent writing is in\r\nperiodicals; moreover, every general work on libraries has a chapter or\r\nmore on the subject.

General.=--Although the library invented the card index, it may be\r\nconfessed that in this country the library has not yet realized the\r\npossibilities of its own invention, even if it is convinced of its\r\ncomplete desirability. We make no question, however, of the fact that\r\nsuch methods as card-indexing and its derivative, vertical filing,\r\nbecome more necessary every day if the librarian is to handle with any\r\ndegree of success the multiplicity of documents, prints, papers and\r\nother disparate matter which form so important a part of the stock of a\r\nreally living library. Since the publication of the second edition of\r\nthis MANUAL the whole matter has made such advances that a complete\r\nreversal of many of the statements and recommendations made in it is\r\nnecessary. The general indexing and filing problems before the librarian\r\nare these:\r\n\r\n  1. Borrowers’ register.\r\n\r\n  2. Stationery and supplies register.\r\n\r\n  3. Correspondence filing and indexing.\r\n\r\n  4. Indexing of minutes.\r\n\r\n  5. The filing of clippings.\r\n\r\n  6. The filing of broadsides, prints, photographs, maps, lantern\r\n  slides, negatives.\r\n\r\n  7. The filing of deeds.\r\n\r\n  8. The filing of pamphlets.\r\n\r\nAs the index is the key to the filing system, we will treat of filing\r\nmethods first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Folder for Vertical File.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=301. Vertical, and Loose=, _versus_ =Other Methods.=--Any rigid method\r\nof filing becomes confused and time-wasting. For example, the old method\r\nfor correspondence sent out was to copy it in a letter-book which was\r\nequipped with a thumb-index. As all letters so copied were placed in\r\nthe book in chronological order, it necessarily happened that\r\ncorrespondence with a given person or on a given subject was found in\r\nseveral separate places in the book; and, although the letters received\r\nwhich occasioned the correspondence could be pasted into the letter-book\r\nagainst the replies, no connected view of the correspondence could be\r\ngained without several references. The letter-book method served its\r\npurpose for a long time, and has been preserved owing to the\r\nconservatism which is a British characteristic and to fear of loss,\r\nmisplacement, or inaccurate record being made. Experience proves,\r\nhowever, that loss and misplacement can easily be prevented, and\r\naccurate record of letters is equally possible, when filing by flexible\r\nmethods is used. Moreover, the principle of classification--alphabetical\r\nor subject--is the foundation of successful filing which admits of rapid\r\nreference and completeness; for it is beyond question desirable that all\r\ncorrespondence, documents, etc., relating to any given matter, should be\r\nkept in one place only. For example, the bookbinding transactions of a\r\nlibrary involve correspondence with several bookbinders, specifications,\r\ninstructions, orders, incidental correspondence respecting defects,\r\nerrors, etc.--and all this material should come together for the simple\r\nreason that it is used together. To ensure this the material must be\r\nfiled individually as a general rule; that is to say, in such a way that\r\nadditional material can be inserted. There are various methods: the\r\nStolzenberg file, for instance, and other files which resemble it. These\r\nare generally folders of stout manilla, having two flexible prongs\r\ninside at the fold which penetrate and fold over the margins of the\r\npapers and so hold them in place; and when an insertion is made the\r\nprongs are lifted and the new paper fitted into position. More recent is\r\nloose filing in folders in which the material is not secured in any way,\r\nand insertions are therefore possible without obstruction of any kind.\r\nAll folders are filed in drawers, in cabinets as a rule, and the average\r\noffice desk is now equipped with drawers for vertical filing. An\r\nillustration of a folder and filing cabinet will show better than much\r\ndescription what we have in mind (Figs. 114, 115).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--A Drawer of a Correspondence Filing Cabinet.]\r\n\r\nIn these folders correspondence and other documents are filed together\r\nwith the carbon copies of replies. The carbon copy of a letter is, of\r\ncourse, an exact facsimile of it made at the one original operation of\r\nwriting or typing the letter; it is thus an exact record, and additions\r\nor corrections are easily visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=302.= The arrangement of correspondence, etc., is a matter upon which\r\nopinion differs, but except for general correspondence, which may be\r\nfiled alphabetically in folders--one or more folders as required being\r\ndevoted to each letter of the alphabet--it is generally found that a\r\nclassified arrangement is to be preferred. Even in the alphabetical\r\nfolders an expansible number should be given to each folder in order\r\nthat it may be indexed briefly and clearly. For the classification of\r\ncorrespondence several schemes have been devised; that, for example, in\r\nthe latest edition of Dewey’s _Decimal Classification_ is full, flexible\r\nand practical; and perhaps that which is most used is L. Stanley Jast’s\r\n_Decimal Classification of Library Economy and Office Papers_, 1906\r\n(revised 1907). The main divisions, a subdivision, and a section of the\r\ncomplete tables will enable us to illustrate its use (see p. 284).\r\n\r\n  _Main Divisions._\r\n\r\n  0  General.\r\n  01 Librarian.

All correspondence is marked boldly with the\r\nnumber of the division to which it belongs, and is filed in the folders\r\nwhich bear the number. The folders are numbered on the projecting edge\r\nof the broader flap, as shown in Fig. 114, and are arranged numerically\r\naccording to the notation order. It may be objected that this method\r\nseparates letters from one correspondent who may write at various times\r\nor on various subjects; but experience proves that except in few cases,\r\nsuch as are provided for under 55, where general correspondence is\r\narranged alphabetically under the names of the writers, the questions\r\nthe file is required to answer are not answered in terms of names of\r\ncorrespondents; moreover, the alphabetical name index, which is an\r\nindispensable accompaniment of the method, brings together all\r\nreferences to letters from any given correspondent. The index should be\r\non cards, and should give the name and address of the correspondent, the\r\nclassification number of the subject, and the dates of the letters\r\nreceived or dispatched (see Fig. 116).\r\n\r\nNot only does this index serve as a key to the correspondence file\r\n(Section 302); it may contain, without prejudice to its value, all\r\naddresses which the librarian deems it expedient to keep, with telephone\r\nnumbers, telegraphic addresses, and cable codes where necessary.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that a classified file of this kind will accommodate\r\nall other documents and lists--book-lists, reports made on subjects or\r\ndepartments, minutes, and in fact any miscellaneous papers whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\n=304.= The effectiveness, and indeed safety, of any individual indexing\r\nor filing system depends upon the care with which it is manipulated in\r\norder that misplacements of papers or cards may not occur. The fear of\r\ncarelessness or ignorance on the part of assistants has caused some\r\nlibrarians to prefer an alphabetical system of filing. When this is so\r\nit should be alphabetical by subjects, except in the case of general\r\ncorrespondence which deals with no particular subjects. Library\r\ncommunications are frequently of this general nature, but the vital\r\nletters are upon subjects; for example,\r\n\r\n  Exhibitions,\r\n  Lectures,\r\n  Readings,\r\n  Story Hours,\r\n\r\nare headings taken at random for which folders would be included. In\r\narranging courses of lectures, for example, a librarian may write and\r\nreceive any number of letters; and he wants them together as\r\na rule and not in the alphabetical order of correspondents. This\r\nalphabetical-subject system requires an index to such folders as do not\r\ncome under general correspondence; folders coming under the latter would\r\nbe most useful in a sequence separate from the subject folders, but such\r\nseparation is not essential.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                              |\r\n  | SMITH, H.

This simply means arrangement alphabetically by the name of the\r\ncorrespondent, and in this method the file is self-indexing to the\r\nextent of the names. If it is made the rule to place letters from\r\ninstitutions under the names of such institutions, and to insert, where\r\nnecessary, in strict alphabetical order slips of paper to hold all\r\ncross-references from the names of officers, there will be no need for\r\nfurther indexing. If topical indexes are required they can be compiled\r\non 8vo slips, the subject word being written boldly on the top of the\r\nsheet, and the names of the writers on the topic in alphabetical order\r\nbelow. These slips can take their place in alphabetical order among the\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=306.= All working correspondence files should be weeded out at\r\nintervals to remove matter of transient interest and to relieve\r\ncongestion. The librarian should at the first mark such papers as are to\r\nbe filed--much correspondence is merely formal, and has no information\r\nvalue, and need not be filed even temporarily; but it is better to file\r\neverything and to weed frequently than to lose any important document by\r\ninitial carelessness. When weeding out, the matter of merely temporary\r\ninterest may be destroyed; and that which it is desired to keep may be\r\ntransferred in strict order to filing boxes, or another storage filing\r\ncabinet, thus leaving the current files free from any but current\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Storage Box for Pamphlets, Letters, etc.\r\n(Section 306).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=307. Prints, Photographs and Maps.=--Unframed, unmounted “illustration”\r\nmaterial, in which are included prints, illustrations, photographs,\r\nmaps, and broadsides, requires separate and careful filing. In the first\r\nplace it should be, so far as possible, mounted on “nature,” “sultan\r\nmecca,” or similar mounts of uniform size. This applies particularly to\r\nprints and photographs, and is the best means of ensuring their\r\npreservation and ease in handling and consulting them. They then need\r\nclose classification by one of the existing systematic schemes to line\r\non so far as may be with the classification of the books; and it is\r\noften necessary to expand a classification considerably to differentiate\r\nthe almost innumerable sub-topics which may form the subjects of\r\npictures. Such expansion is skilled work and should be done only by an\r\nexpert classifier. An examination of the classification proposed for\r\nlocal photographic surveys in Gower, Jast and Topley’s _The Camera as\r\nHistorian_, 1916 (Sampson, Low), will show how minute a classification\r\nphotographs demand. Each mount should bear a label, in the top left\r\ncorner preferably, giving the class-number, the subject, and other\r\nparticulars (see the sections on Photographic Surveys, =433=, etc.). The\r\nfiling may be in classification order in boxes which will lie flat on\r\nthe shelves; and the most economical boxes are those made of the\r\nstoutest material compatible with lightness, such as cardboard covered\r\nwith rexine, pegamoid cloth, etc.; heavy boxes of wood are awkward to\r\nhandle and should be avoided. Better than boxes, because of the ease of\r\nconsultation and insertion permitted, is a vertical file in drawers. In\r\nthis the prints are inserted loosely like cards in a card-index, and no\r\nlifting and little handling are necessary to find any given print. For\r\nvertical filing the mounts should be the stoutest available, and a\r\nfurther protection is to use folders to hold groups of prints--one to a\r\ntopic as a rule. The projecting edge of the folder may bear the topic\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=308.= Maps do not fit readily into the vertical system, and are\r\ntroublesome material as a rule. Several solutions of the map-filing\r\nproblem have been suggested--rolling them and inserting them in tubes in\r\na cabinet on the principle of the umbrella stand; mounting them on\r\nspring rollers and fixing them over bookcases where they can be drawn\r\ndown to be consulted exactly as a blind is drawn; and an ingenious\r\nmethod devised by Mr G. T. Shaw, and described in _Public Libraries:\r\ntheir Organization, etc._, 1918 (Library Association), is worth\r\nexamination. For the many small maps that all libraries possess, flat\r\nfiling in such boxes as Fig. 118 depicts is probably the best. Single\r\nsheets of the Ordnance Survey, or other similar maps which are much\r\nhandled, should be mounted on linen or some similar material, and an\r\nadditional protection from tearing is to bind them with tape, which may\r\nbe done by folding the tape over the edges and running them round with\r\nan ordinary sewing machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Box for Filing Prints and Maps (Section 308).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=309. Newspaper Clippings.=--The vertical file is an excellent\r\ninstrument for dealing with newspaper clippings. These, in the case of\r\nmatters of temporary interest, may be dropped into classified folders.\r\nFor clippings which it is desired to keep, it is better to provide a\r\nmount, which may be of paper of sufficient substance to bear them, and\r\npaste them down, writing in the top left corner the class-number,\r\nsubject, source and date of the clipping. The older methods of filing\r\nclippings in newspaper-cuttings books, or in any form of guard book,\r\nhave the disadvantage of inflexibility, want of rational means of\r\nindexing the contents, and occasion reference in course of time to\r\nseveral volumes for matter on any subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n=310. General.=--For most filing purposes quarto folders, to accommodate\r\nquarto papers, which file in standard-sized drawers, are sufficient; but\r\nboth drawers and folders can be obtained in foolscap and other sizes.\r\nAnd notwithstanding our advocacy of the loose method of filing, there is\r\nmuch to be said for such files as the Stolzenberg for papers which have\r\nan invariable chronological appearing and are valuable in that order;\r\nbecause the file, having the apparatus already described for securing\r\nand binding the papers, has the never-to-be-discounted virtue of book\r\nform. Such papers are minutes, periodical reports on special\r\ndepartments, financial analyses, book-lists, etc. Moreover, although the\r\nstandard Stolzenberg cabinet accommodates its folders in horizontal\r\nfashion, the latter are also suitable for filing vertically in the\r\ndrawers recommended for general purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=311. Lantern Slides and Negatives.=--Modern libraries collect and\r\npreserve, occasionally even make for their own use, lantern slides and\r\nnegatives. The method recommended for storing these is precisely\r\nsimilar to that for prints; that is to say, in drawers in cabinets of\r\nsuitable dimensions. Such cabinets are made by several firms\r\nspecializing in photographic apparatus; and drawers can be obtained of a\r\nsize to accommodate either slides or negatives. Without being dogmatical\r\nupon the point, it may safely be said that the best arrangement of\r\nslides is a classified one in drawers, the classification number being\r\nwritten on a label on the mount of the slide and on the top edge of the\r\nbinding. If the slide is made from a negative in the possession of the\r\nlibrary the number of the negative should also appear on the mount.\r\n\r\n\r\n=312.= Negatives require more careful treatment, as the film is subject\r\nto damage if unprotected. They are also generally larger than lantern\r\nslides; and separate cabinets, or separate drawers, are desirable to\r\nhold them. A useful method is to insert each in a small manilla folder\r\nbearing the number on its edge, which number should also be written in\r\nink (white is best) on the corner of the negative. Negatives may be\r\narranged by accession numbers, as they are rarely wanted more than one\r\nat a time; and the slide catalogue will refer from slide to negative, as\r\nwell as be a direct reference to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=313.= The index or catalogue of slides may be on cards arranged as a\r\nrule by titles or subjects, as the photographer or slide-maker’s name is\r\nrarely wanted. The following example of a card shows the title, source,\r\nlocation, and classification number of a slide and the number of its\r\nnegative:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | 656 LOCOMOTIVES.                                     |\r\n  | Ble                                                  |\r\n  |         Blenkinsop’s Engine, with Rack-Rail, 1811.   |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |     Print--                   Lantern Slide--        |\r\n  |       Process                   Coloured.            |\r\n  |       Size 3 in. × 3 in.                             |\r\n  | Negative 18.

Indexes.=--Probably no work demands the use of indexes so\r\nimperatively as library work. The catalogue is merely an extension of an\r\nindex, and the borrowers’ register (which is dealt with in Section 366,\r\netc.) is in its most convenient form merely an index. We have already\r\ndealt with the indexes for correspondence, lantern slides, etc., and it\r\nwill be more convenient to deal with the indexes to prints and maps in\r\nSections 438, etc. Here we can mention only one or two administrative\r\nindexes, with the general remark that the methods described are not to\r\nbe regarded as stereotyped, but are merely suggestions which librarians\r\nmay adapt to their special needs.\r\n\r\nTHE CARD DIARY.--A useful little card index is one which may go on a\r\ndesk, and is guided with the days of the week, and has such other guides\r\nas “This Week,” “To-day,” “Next Week,” “Miscellaneous matters,” etc.,\r\nwhich serves as a reminder to its user. Behind the appropriate guide are\r\nfiled cards referring to the matters which are to be dealt with at the\r\ntime indicated. These card-diaries are commonly known as “ticklers,” and\r\ncan be a most effective aid to methodical administration.\r\n\r\nSTATIONERY AND SUPPLIES INDEX.--It is an important matter, especially in\r\nlarge libraries, to be able to put hands immediately upon any article of\r\nstationery or other supplies. The old, haphazard plan of thrusting\r\nsupplies in cupboards with wooden doors, and trusting to luck or memory\r\nfor finding them again, is too leisurely a method for the busy modern\r\nlibrarian. All storage cupboards or presses should have glazed doors.\r\nThis simple precaution has the effect of inducing tidiness on the part\r\nof the staff, and the prospect of slovenly arrangement is reduced to a\r\nminimum. The next process is to decide upon a method of indexing which\r\nwill offer the greatest facilities for rapidly finding any given\r\narticle. In the _Library World_ for July, 1899, Mr Jast describes a\r\ngraphic method of achieving this end. He provides a series of cards of\r\nuniform size, one or more for each article indexed, according to the\r\nneed for indexing them more than once in the alphabet. On these cards he\r\ndraws a rough diagrammatic elevation of the cupboard or other place of\r\nstorage, as illustrated (Fig. 120).\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |     Fine Receipt Books.

The index is made by arranging these cards in the\r\nalphabetical order of the names of the various articles. Any one wanting\r\na new fine receipt book, and not knowing where to find it, would look up\r\nthis index under the word “Fine” and there he would find the card which\r\nindicates not only the receptacle where these books were stored, but\r\nalso the exact position. This card may be combined with the inventory\r\ncard described in the next chapter (Section 327).\r\n\r\nAnother plan would be to mark every cupboard or other receptacle with a\r\nletter or number. As these places would have glass doors, if they had\r\nany at all, there would be no necessity to mark separate shelves or\r\npigeon-holes further. It is not always possible, or even desirable, to\r\nfix the location of supplies beyond the main receptacle. A reference to\r\na cupboard is quite near enough for any one having eyes in his head. To\r\nthese various receptacles an index on cards or slip books as before can\r\nreadily be made. The card should bear the name of the article at one of\r\nits top corners, and on the opposite corner the number or letter of the\r\nplace where it is to be found. If necessary the remainder of the card or\r\nslip can be used for setting out the dates and quantities of successive\r\norders of the article. This will be found a very useful form of\r\ninventory.\r\n\r\n\r\n=315.= The indexes of minute books are usually kept in the books\r\nthemselves and not separately. If a thumb index has not been provided, a\r\nfew pages, say, twenty-six, may be reserved at the beginning or end of\r\nthe book, in which an alphabetical sequence can be spaced out in pencil.\r\nIt is equally clear, for all the reasons given in favour of the\r\nindividual entries, that cards permit, that these indexes may be made on\r\ncards.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |    F  |DICKENS, CHARLES                                           |\r\n  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |       |   _David Copperfield_                                     |\r\n  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |       |                                       Macmillan, 4 : 6n.  |\r\n  +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  |   Accession No. 7,420             Date withdrawn, 10 : 6 : 18.    |\r\n  |   Incomplete                      Out of date                     |\r\n  | ✓ Dirty                           New ed.

Other.=--Other indexes which have been found of value are a\r\ngeneral administrative index, with sections allotted to suggestions for\r\nactivities; information given from the libraries, and not given (a most\r\nimportant matter as revealing deficiencies needing remedy); the location\r\nand distribution of keys when the latter are in the hands of several\r\npeople; classification decisions; and, indeed, there is no limit to the\r\nuse of the card index as an administrative tool. One simple and\r\ninvaluable index in libraries where lectures are given is a Lecturers’\r\nIndex, with guides for Offers, Next Series, Current Lectures, Past\r\nLectures, behind which are placed cards bearing the names and addresses\r\nof lecturers, the titles and other particulars of their lectures, dates\r\nof delivery, etc. The mere indexing of such materials affords many\r\nsuggestions and reduces lecture-organization to a very simple process.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=319.

Forms and Blanks.=--Most of the important forms and blanks have\r\nalready been described and figured under the different departments to\r\nwhich they refer, and this section will, therefore, only deal with a few\r\ngeneral forms. NOTEPAPER of various kinds should be provided, some in\r\nthe ordinary business size, some post quarto, and some foolscap folio.\r\nOn each of these sizes the usual heading should be printed, with the\r\narms and name of the town, librarian’s name, and any other information\r\nthought necessary. All ordinary correspondence can be carried on with\r\nthe business size, but official and complimentary letters should be\r\nwritten on the larger sizes. ENVELOPES to suit the various sizes should\r\nalso be procured, and it is a good plan to stock some large-sized manila\r\nenvelopes for sending off large documents, reports, etc. These can be\r\nhad in a variety of sizes, and some of them have clasps instead of\r\ngummed flaps, which make them very useful for temporary filing purposes.\r\nGummed postal WRAPPERS should also be stocked in a fairly large size,\r\nand LABELS for sending off parcels, with the name of the library boldly\r\nprinted on them, will be found very useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=323. Writing Materials.=--INKS are manufactured in such a variety of\r\nkinds and colours that choice is made difficult. A good black ink should\r\nbe procured, and also a bright red colour. Copying ink is not necessary\r\neven where press letter-copying is employed, as ordinary blue-black ink,\r\nif not blotted but allowed to dry naturally, will make perfectly good\r\npress copies. Care should be taken not to dry the tissue-paper leaves of\r\nthe letter book completely when making copies. Other colours of inks,\r\nsuch as green, violet, etc., can be obtained if wanted for special\r\npurposes. INK-WELLS should be got in the modern reservoir form, with a\r\nconstant level dipping place. Ink kept in such receptacles never gets\r\nthick or dirty, and the pen is never overcharged or underfed. These\r\nink-wells with rubber tops can be obtained for about one shilling each,\r\nbut for staff and committee use a better variety should be ordered as\r\nthe rubber degenerates quickly under the chemical action of the ink.\r\nInk-wells should preferably be associated with pen-_racks_ rather than\r\nwith pen-trays. A rack sorts the pens and pencils out automatically in a\r\nvisible order, while a tray wastes a large amount of time annually,\r\nowing to the groping and examining and fruitless fumblings necessitated\r\nbefore the right pen or pencil is found among its fellows. One pen one\r\nplace, is a good motto for any librarian. Of course the FOUNTAIN PEN\r\nremoves a great deal of the waste of time and trouble inseparable from\r\nink-pot filling, pen selecting, pen dipping, etc., and every librarian\r\nought to have one as part of his ordinary equipment. There are various\r\nsorts in the market, but the higher priced ones are, as a rule, the only\r\nreliable ones, and the cost is an investment on which a return is soon\r\nmade. STYLOGRAPHIC PENS are very useful, but because of their tendency\r\nto spoil good handwriting, they are not so satisfactory as fountain\r\n_pens_, although they are much cheaper. For staff use in the numbering\r\nof book labels, charging, etc., stylographic pens would be found very\r\nuseful, and every library of reasonable size should stock a few.\r\n\r\nPENCILS for public use should be the ordinary cedar ones at about 5s. a\r\ngross. For note-book copying purposes a Rowney “H” pencil, retailing at\r\ntwopence, will be found of great value, as it does not “set off” like\r\nthe ordinary “H-B.” A hard pencil lasts much longer than a soft one, it\r\ndoes not require pointing so often, and the fact just mentioned, that\r\nwriting done by its means does not blur or “set off” is an advantage not\r\nto be despised. Red and blue crayon pencils should be kept for checking\r\npurposes. Ordinary pen-holders and hard and soft pen-points are\r\noccasionally stocked in public libraries, as well as pencils, to lend\r\nout to the readers. Where this is done a certain amount of loss will\r\nhave to be faced, as pens and pencils both disappear in the most\r\nmysterious ways. It is, however, a very great convenience to provide\r\npens, especially in reference libraries fitted with special\r\nreading-tables provided with sunk ink-wells.\r\n\r\nBlotting paper, foolscap paper ruled faint, scribbling pads, and common\r\nwhite paper in sheets about 15 inches × 9 inches for mounting slips,\r\nshould be provided among the writing materials of a library.\r\n\r\n\r\n=324. Library Stationery Cabinet.=--It is needless to set out in more\r\ndetail the various desk accessories and miscellaneous stationery\r\nrequired in a library, and an enumeration of the minimum contents of a\r\nstationery cabinet, which ought to be had for every library will\r\nsuffice. A cabinet of this sort could be made up in various sizes and\r\nprices, like medicine chests, and would be found much more useful than\r\nthe random method of buying articles at present in vogue.\r\n\r\nSTATIONERY CABINET\r\n\r\n  Paper clips.\r\n\r\n  Stationery case. For holding a supply of envelopes, note-paper, etc.\r\n  (large sizes).\r\n\r\n  Numbering machine (five figures).\r\n\r\n  Rubber dating stamps, with loose type and with band-changing\r\n  apparatus.\r\n\r\n  Rubber printing outfit.\r\n\r\n  Nest of drawers, twelve in cabinet.\r\n\r\n  Cash-box.\r\n\r\n  Paper fasteners, corner clips, wire clips and brass clips.\r\n\r\n  Red tape, several spools (for documents only).\r\n\r\n  Pins.\r\n\r\n  Hand-rest for writing.\r\n\r\n  Tape measure or good two-foot rule.\r\n\r\n  Waste-paper basket.\r\n\r\n  Dispatch basket (wicker), for holding documents.\r\n\r\n  Letter scales, weighing to eight pounds.\r\n\r\n  Scissors.\r\n\r\n  Paste in bottles.\r\n\r\n  Rubber bands, assorted.\r\n\r\n  Rubber erasers.\r\n\r\n  Call bells, for public or office use.\r\n\r\n  Gummed labels, assorted sizes.\r\n\r\n  Sealing wax.\r\n\r\n  Twine of various thicknesses.\r\n\r\n  Ruled quadrille or squared paper (for planning).\r\n\r\n  Tracing paper or linen.\r\n\r\n  Case of mathematical instruments.\r\n\r\n  Paper knives.\r\n\r\n  Bone folders.\r\n\r\n  Leather book-carrying straps.\r\n\r\n  Reading and magnifying glasses.\r\n\r\n  Key rings and labels.\r\n\r\n  Writing pads or tablets.\r\n\r\n  Manuscript books of various sizes, 8vo, 4to, folio, for odd record\r\n  purposes.\r\n\r\n  etc. etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=325.= The typewriter and its accessories are to be taken for granted in\r\nall libraries; and in connexion therewith its own special stationery,\r\ntypewriting carbon, and stencilling papers, inks, etc. Most libraries of\r\neven medium size now employ a skilled stenographer who acts as secretary\r\nto the chief librarian, manages the correspondence filing, the\r\nduplicating work, copies catalogue cards, etc. The best typewriter is\r\nthe cheapest machine in the long run, and it should be equipped with\r\ncarding and tabulating apparatus. Those which have more than one fount\r\nof type, as roman and italic, large and condensed types, have much to\r\nrecommend them. A duplicating machine is an invaluable accessory. For\r\nsmall libraries the flat stencil-duplicating machine, such as the\r\nGestetner, will suffice, and probably the best copies of smaller work,\r\ncard forms, etc., are obtained by this means. But for circulars,\r\nbook-lists, programmes and other matters of which many copies are\r\nrequired a cyclostyle is desirable. By its means topical reading lists\r\nand the many circulars which a live library desires to issue almost\r\nevery week can be prepared and circulated widely with the utmost\r\ndispatch. Such a machine is one of the best investments a library can\r\nmake.\r\n\r\n  +-------+----------------+------------+---------+-----------+\r\n  | Date. |  Description.  |   Price.   | Vendor. | Location. |\r\n  +-------+----------------+---+---+----+---------+-----------+\r\n  |       |                | £ | s.| d. |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n  |       |                |   |   |    |         |           |\r\n\r\nFIG. 124.--Inventory Book (Section 326).\r\n\r\n\r\n=326. Records.=--An inventory should be kept of all supplies ordered,\r\nwith dates and quantities, and a very good plan is to use the cards\r\ndescribed at Section 327. These could be ruled in a series of columns to\r\nshow dates, quantities and prices, and kept in a box which would serve\r\nthe double purpose of inventory and supplies index. But there are other\r\nsupplies besides stationery, etc., and these would have to be added. An\r\ninventory should be kept of all movable property belonging to the\r\nlibrary, such as furniture, pictures and other articles. It could be\r\nruled as shown in Fig. 124.\r\n\r\n\r\n=327.= The following is a good and simple method of keeping an inventory\r\nof supplies, and providing for their automatic renewal. Thin slips on\r\ntough paper are ruled and printed as in the examples shown (Figs.\r\n125-6).\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                             |\r\n  | PAPER                                                       |\r\n  |                                                             |\r\n  | DESCRIPTION--Foolscap, ruled faint and margin.              |\r\n  |                                                             |\r\n  | LOCATION      4--2.

There are many ways of\r\neffecting this check, all more or less satisfactory, but none, perhaps,\r\nis quite so certain as an actual material check upon the running-out of\r\nsupplies. In addition to the inventory it is necessary to establish an\r\n“emergency-supply” cupboard, safely locked up, and in it to place a\r\nsmall stock of everything which is liable to run out. Thus, if two reams\r\nof foolscap arrive, a five-quire packet must be taken from it,\r\nseparately parcelled up, and deposited in the emergency-supply\r\nreceptacle. Attached to this emergency bundle should be a luggage label,\r\nor other conspicuous tag, bearing the words “Foolscap, ruled faint,\r\norder No. 69, Stock exhausted. . . .” The blank space is for the date\r\nwhen the emergency supply is transferred to the ordinary stock cupboard.\r\nIn course of time the accessible stock is used up, and the person who\r\nremoves the last sheet, or the one who next goes, discovers the\r\nshortage, and is forced to ask the key-keeper of the emergency cupboard\r\nfor the reserved stock. This is produced, the label is dated and handed\r\nto the person responsible for ordering a fresh supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n=328.= All general library KEYS may be assembled on a special key-board.\r\nThis should consist of a large board fitted with the necessary number of\r\nhooks, one for each key or group of keys, and a proper descriptive label\r\nand number should be pasted under each hook. The keys should be numbered\r\nand labelled to correspond, with ivory labels attached by rings to every\r\nkey. In addition an alphabetical list should be fixed to the door of the\r\nkey-board, so as to facilitate finding. In some libraries the\r\ndepartmental heads and assistants are provided with a master-key to all\r\ninternal doors which concern them; but keys which give access to the\r\nbuilding as a whole should be limited to the chief librarian and the\r\nchief caretaker. A large building requires many keys, and a card-index,\r\nentering of the name of each key and the person who holds it or its\r\nlocation, is a useful method of checking the safety of keys. When keys\r\nare removed from the building, they should be insured with one of the\r\nkey insurance or registry offices.\r\n\r\nThere are several minor matters of routine or arrangement not dealt with\r\nin other places. Dusting is usually underdone in British libraries. For\r\none thing there is rarely a sufficient supply of cloth dusters; often a\r\ndirty one, stowed away in a drawer, is all the provision for a large\r\nlibrary. Clean dusters should be attached by means of rings or clips to\r\nevery bookcase and cupboard throughout a library, and the staff should\r\nbe required to use them on every possible occasion. Certainly a book\r\nshould never be handed to a reader in a dusty condition, as not only may\r\nthe reader be offended, but he must inevitably transfer the dust from\r\nthe outside to the inside of the book in handling it. There would be\r\nmuch less dust among book-shelves if a liberal supply of dusters were\r\nallowed and constantly used. When books are being dusted systematically\r\na large tray or box of wet sawdust should be provided. Into this the\r\nbooks should be dusted by means of a brush.\r\n\r\nIt is also a good plan, whenever possible, to take very dusty books out\r\nto the open air, and smartly beat them together, two at a time. This\r\ndrives the dust out more effectually than anything else. Vacuum cleaners\r\nwhich work by means of suction are sometimes useful in cases where large\r\naccumulations of dust require to be removed, and not simply\r\nredistributed, but a powerful variety is necessary as the smaller vacuum\r\ncleaners remove the top layer of dust as a rule, and leave a solid\r\nsubstratum. Wood block and linoleum covered floors when treated with wax\r\npolish do not require to be scrubbed, and the surface remains smooth,\r\nand cleaning is reduced to a minimum. There are various floor\r\npreparations which are said to be effectual in keeping down dust, but\r\nmost of them produce discoloration in the course of time, and periodical\r\nscrubbings should be arranged to restore the original colour of the\r\nflooring.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nBOOKBINDING AND REPAIRING\r\n\r\n\r\n=329. General.=--Public library binding is an art by itself, and is\r\nquite distinct from ordinary commercial bookbinding on the one hand, and\r\nartistic binding on the other. A binding which is strong enough to\r\nwithstand the handling of its owner and his friends, and beautiful\r\nenough to please the taste of the fastidious amateur, may be practically\r\nuseless in a position where it may have to endure the handling of\r\nhundreds, or even thousands, of different persons, all of whom are not\r\nequally educated in the proper use of books. A public library book\r\nrequires to be bound neatly and strongly, with particular regard to the\r\nintegrity of the stitching rather than to its mere covering, although\r\nthis has to be considered in the case of much-used reference books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=330.= For public library work only good binders who are experienced in\r\nthis particular class of bookbinding should be employed. In many cases,\r\nespecially in small towns, the work turned out by local binders is about\r\nas bad as it can well be, and just as likely to lead to the rapid\r\ndestruction of books as to their preservation. Cheapness does not in\r\nthis matter necessarily mean economy, nor is good workmanship often an\r\naccompaniment of low prices. It may be said generally that library\r\nbinding is one of the items of maintenance which no library can _afford_\r\nto have done cheaply and badly. It is much better, in the long run, for\r\na library in a small provincial town to send its work to a recognized\r\nbookbinder in a large town, and even to pay carriage both ways, than to\r\ndepend upon the local bookseller or stationer, who only knows about the\r\ncasing of magazines. A good binder will bind a book in a manner which\r\nwill enable the boards to outlive the leaves, while a poor workman will\r\nrequire to have his work done over again very soon, if, meanwhile, his\r\nrough and unscientific methods have not tended to shorten the existence\r\nof the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n=331.= The question of binding books from the sheets, or rebinding\r\ncloth- and paper-board books in leather, before putting them in\r\ncirculation, has been much debated, though it is really not a very\r\nformidable or difficult matter after all. As no one can foretell with\r\ncertainty whether or not any given book is going to be popular and much\r\nused, it is manifestly a mistake to have any book re-bound, or specially\r\nbound from the sheets, until this very important point has been\r\nascertained. Time alone can determine whether a book is going to be\r\npopular, and for this reason there seems little economy or gain in\r\nspecially binding new books at the outset. Books in publishers’ cloth\r\nbindings, when printed on paper of fair quality, will often circulate\r\nfrom twenty to forty times before attaining a condition which requires\r\nre-binding, and when strongly and properly rebound in leather or other\r\nboards will outlast the book. Some claims have been advanced with regard\r\nto the durability of various styles of binding, but it is impossible to\r\nignore the fact that it is the paper of the book and not the covers of\r\nthe binding which forms the weak point.\r\n\r\nThe Great War has rendered this paper problem an acute one. For a few\r\nyears before 1914 librarians had induced a few publishers to produce\r\nsome classes of books on a superior paper, and in a reinforced\r\nbinding--that is, one according to the Society of Arts and Library\r\nAssociation recommendations--but the war conditions not only stopped all\r\nthis, they prevented the importation of paper and paper-materials. Hence\r\nthe most appalling rubbish was made to serve the purpose of book-paper,\r\nwith disastrous results for almost all books published from 1915-19. Few\r\nbooks published in that period are in materials that will last without\r\nany particular use for a decade, and far fewer will stand the handling\r\nof public library readers or bear re-binding in any material heavier\r\nthan cloth. The public acquiesced in these materials as a war necessity;\r\nit has yet to be seen if the publishers, having found the public\r\napparently contented with them, will persist in their use when they\r\nbecome cheaper. Every effort must be made to prevent it.\r\n\r\nDirt is also as potent a factor as rough usage in shortening the life of\r\na book, and it really matters little what kind of special materials or\r\nstitching are employed since no book’s existence can be prolonged beyond\r\na certain term of years when dirt and inferior paper are such important\r\nelements in the matter. There are other factors in the question of\r\nbinding from sheets, and one is the difficulty of obtaining the\r\nnecessary copies from publishers. Another is the fact that some cheap\r\nnovels cannot be had in quires at all, and, consequently, any advantage\r\nwhich may result from unused sheets giving a better and firmer hold for\r\nstitching cannot be obtained. The durability of new books re-bound in\r\nspecial materials has been somewhat exaggerated, and librarians and\r\ncommittees should first adopt the ordinary method of allowing use to\r\ndetermine the books which require re-binding. But experiments should\r\nalso be tried with special re-binding and other plans in order to\r\nascertain what is best; and a good general rule will probably emerge--no\r\nbook should be bound so well that the cover is in excellent condition\r\nlong after the inside has been worn beyond redemption.\r\n\r\n\r\n=332.= It would be a valuable concession if publishers would issue some\r\ncopies of every novel by well-known authors, printed on specially tough\r\npaper, and bound according to the specification given in Section 341.\r\nThis would meet every need which exists for specially bound copies of\r\npopular books, and give the much more valuable advantage of editions\r\nprinted on paper which is not mere rubbish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=333. Home Binding.=--The question of establishing a bookbinding plant,\r\nfor the purpose of conducting binding on the library premises, is one\r\nwhich affects only the large libraries of the country; but large towns\r\nwith a number of branch libraries may find it both economical and\r\nadvantageous to establish binderies, if not for extensive operations in\r\nthe binding of books, at least for their repair and re-casing. At\r\nPortsmouth, Hull, Bristol, Brighton, Bournemouth and elsewhere home\r\nbinderies more or less extensive have been established, and the\r\nexperience gained in these places seems to vary considerably.\r\n\r\nThe advantages accruing to the home bindery are obvious, apart from that\r\nof the convenience of having the work done on the library premises; the\r\nlibrarian can select only the best materials and can supervise the work\r\nat every stage of the processes. Librarians who have established such a\r\ndepartment are convinced not only of its convenience but also--a much\r\nmore important point in present circumstances--its economy. When it is\r\nremembered that much other work than the actual binding and re-casing of\r\nbooks, such as illustration-mounting, ruling, magazine cover-making,\r\netc., may be carried out in the home bindery, there is much to be said\r\nfor it; but until the experiment has been carried much further home\r\nbinding is not advocated save in the larger libraries. A joint-stock or\r\ncooperative bindery could be worked by the London Metropolitan Borough\r\nLibraries with considerable prospects of success and economy, but in\r\nisolated provincial towns the plan is not so feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=334.= Repairing departments stand upon quite another footing, and here\r\nthere is safe ground for experiment with every prospect of success. At\r\nGlasgow, Manchester, Croydon, Islington and other places, small\r\nrepairing plants have been in operation for some time with good results.\r\nAt all the places mentioned women workers are employed, who repair and\r\nre-case books, stitch pamphlets in covers, and even bind less important\r\nbooks which are not likely to be greatly used. Lettering and numbering\r\ncan also be done, a useful branch of the bookbinder’s art, carried on at\r\na considerable number of libraries. A repairing plant such as is used at\r\nCroydon costs less than £30, while the wages of a repairer may range\r\nfrom 40s. weekly. Materials also run into a certain sum per annum,\r\naccording to the nature and amount of work done.\r\n\r\n\r\n=335.= Finishing, which includes lettering and numbering, can be done by\r\nmembers of the library staff, although instruction is sometimes\r\ndifficult to obtain owing to trade jealousy and the regulations of most\r\npolytechnic schools, which, though supported by public funds, deny\r\ninstruction to any save those actually engaged in particular trades.\r\nPerhaps the day will come when library schools, such as that about to be\r\nestablished in London at University College, will include this subject\r\nwhen dealing with bookbinding, typography and all allied practical arts.\r\nA complete finishing plant, including sets of numbers and alphabets, can\r\nbe purchased at a sum which even small libraries can afford. The\r\nsatisfaction of accomplishing on the premises the work of class\r\nlettering and numbering, which requires both care and neatness, is\r\ngreat. At any rate, inquiry should be made by librarians into the\r\npossibilities of establishing a finishing department, especially in\r\ncases where a systematic classification is used.[12]\r\n\r\n  [12] _See_ “Specification for the fittings of a small bindery,” by F.\r\n       J. Williamson, in _Leather for Libraries_, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n=336. Materials.=--For public library purposes book-covering materials\r\nshould be of the most durable sorts, and it is not wise to employ many\r\ndifferent varieties either of cloths or leathers. Ordinary binders’\r\ncloth is nearly as satisfactory as anything else for preserving its\r\ncolour, lettering and defying the pernicious effects of gas-laden\r\natmospheres and extremes of temperature. It will not stand much\r\nhandling, however, and is very liable to wear out at the corners and\r\njoints. Nevertheless, for little-used collections of pamphlets, sets of\r\nlocal publications, and other matter which merely wants binding for\r\nappearance’s sake and storage purposes, ordinary binders’ cloth is\r\nstrongly recommended. Smooth varieties are preferable to rough or\r\npatterned kinds, as being less liable to harbour dust. Apart from\r\nordinary binders’ cloth, the best known varieties are linen cloths,\r\nbuckrams and Pegamoid and Rexine cloths. Pegamoid and Rexine cloths are\r\ntreated in a special way with some preparation of celluloid to render\r\nthem impervious to dirt and moisture. For novels and other short-lived\r\nbooks these cloths are worth a trial, as they cannot be regarded as\r\nexpensive. At any rate, experience has proved that these materials will\r\noutlast any novel which may be re-bound in them, and, after all, that is\r\nas much as can be expected of any binding. Leather should rarely be\r\nplaced upon little-used books, and many libraries which hitherto used it\r\nfor long sets, have discarded it in favour of legal buckram, or such a\r\nmaterial as Winterbottam’s washable cloth. A certain amount of handling\r\nis necessary for the preservation of most leathers, as the animal grease\r\nfrom the hands is a preservative, and they deteriorate if this is not\r\nforthcoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n=337.= The principal leathers used for public library bindings are\r\npig-skin, persian and levant moroccos, and roan. Calf, russia and other\r\nfancy leathers should not be used, as they turn brittle under the\r\ninfluence of heated and dry air, and crumble to pieces. Apart from this,\r\nthey are costly and otherwise unsuitable for public library purposes.\r\nThe leathers recommended should be used according to the books which\r\nthey have to cover, and the following list will give an idea of the best\r\nclasses for which to use each kind:--\r\n\r\n  Levant morocco, or real morocco, made from goat-skin. This material\r\n  should be used for very valuable books which require a handsome and\r\n  dignified binding. It is very durable, but expensive for ordinary\r\n  work.\r\n\r\n  Persian morocco, made from sheep-skin, is not so dear or so good as\r\n  levant morocco, but is a durable and satisfactory leather if a good\r\n  quality is procured. It should be used for popular books in the\r\n  non-fictional classes of the lending department. Heavy books can be\r\n  bound in this leather, but pig-skin is better. The more it is handled\r\n  the better it wears and keeps its condition.\r\n\r\n  Roan is a kind of inferior sheep-skin, with a different grain and\r\n  surface from Persian morocco, and is a useful and cheap leather for\r\n  certain classes of books, such as the less popular works of travel,\r\n  science, theology, fiction, etc. Books up to the crown octavo size can\r\n  be half-bound in this material at prices ranging from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a\r\n  volume. Heavy books are not recommended for binding in this leather.\r\n\r\n  Pig-skin is the strongest leather of all, and also the most durable\r\n  for much-used heavy books; but librarians should make certain that\r\n  real pig-skin is supplied, and not some wretched imitation. The price\r\n  of pig-skin is rather more than good Persian morocco. All reference\r\n  works, such as dictionaries, atlases, directories, and other volumes\r\n  which are being constantly handled, may well be bound in this.\r\n\r\nAll leathers specified for bookbinding should be of the acid-free\r\ndescription recommended by the Society of Arts Committee (1898-1900) and\r\nthe Sound Leather Committee of the Library Association. Sumach-tanned\r\nleathers are now to be had with a special guarantee from the makers.\r\n\r\nOther binding materials, such as vellum, parchment, canvas and patent\r\nleathers of various kinds, are seldom required in libraries, and need\r\nnot be considered further. Preparations for spreading on books to\r\nprotect them may also be passed over, and also the continental and\r\nAmerican habit of covering all books in manilla or other paper covers of\r\nuniform colour. Most of the so-called leather “preservatives” are\r\nhurtful rather than helpful, but it may be observed that some leather\r\nbindings which get dry and worn will improve if treated with ordinary\r\nvaseline. It should be rubbed well and plentifully into the texture of\r\nthe leather with the fingers, and when it has soaked in, should be wiped\r\nwith a soft cloth. Vaseline is as good as any patent or other\r\npreservative for reviving decaying and shabby leathers of all kinds,\r\nalthough it dries quickly, and furniture polish has also been\r\nrecommended. As regards covers, the time has not yet come when the\r\nindividuality of a book, as issued by its publisher, or given by its\r\nappropriate library binding, requires to be hidden under a paper mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n=338. Class Colours.=--In systematically classified libraries there is a\r\ncertain amount of advantage to be gained by re-binding each class of\r\nbooks, as required, in some appropriate colour. When open access to the\r\nshelves is also granted, there is a very considerable aid to the\r\nmaintenance of order given by the use of distinctive class colours.\r\nThus, Science may be light brown or fawn colour; Fine Arts, orange;\r\nSocial Science, light green; Theology, etc., black; History and Travel,\r\ndark green; Biography, maroon; Philology, light blue; Poetry, red;\r\nFiction, dark brown; and Juvenile, yellow; and so on to any degree. A\r\nvariation of this plan is to vary the colours for authors, binding each\r\ndistinctively; this gives a not unpleasing variety to the shelves and\r\nhas a certain arranging value.\r\n\r\n\r\n=339. Lettering and Numbering.=--When lettering and numbering have to be\r\ndone apart from the re-binding, they can be executed by the staff after\r\na little practice, as pointed out in Section 335. The object of\r\nlettering is to facilitate the finding of books, and for this reason it\r\nshould be clear and bold. It is also possible by means of a little\r\nvariation to obtain a certain amount of class-guiding in the system of\r\nlettering, and it should be made an invariable principle in every public\r\nlibrary to adopt a certain order of particulars on the backs of books,\r\nand stick to the order. Too often this important matter is left to the\r\nfitful fancy of the binder’s finisher, with the result that very\r\nfrequently the author’s name appears in all the panels in rotation. The\r\nseries of suggestions given in Fig. 127 for dealing with each class is\r\noffered as a basis on which any librarian can build a system of his own.\r\nThe letterings are arranged to provide for titles, authors, volume\r\nnumbers, class numbers, and dates of publication when necessary. Class\r\nletters and numbers occupy one definite place on each book, which is not\r\nsubject to variations in height when appearing on books of different\r\nsizes. The markings here figured for the backs of books are arranged so\r\nthat titles occupy the leading panel in all classes and thereby\r\ncorrespond with the great majority of the books as issued by publishers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Specimens of Class Lettering and Numbering\r\n(Section 339).]\r\n\r\nThe chief points to emphasize in these suggested letterings are that the\r\nclass letter and number should always occupy the same relative position\r\nirrespective of the size of the volume, namely, about two inches from\r\nthe foot, and that alphabetical classes like Fiction, Poetry and Essays\r\nshould be boldly lettered with the first three letters of the author’s\r\nsurname, or numbers from an author table, while _Individual_ Biography\r\nonly should be similarly marked with the surname letters of the\r\n_subject_ of the biography, but not the author, save in the case of\r\nautobiographies, letters, etc. If it should be thought necessary to add\r\nthe accession numbers, they can be placed out of the way in the top\r\nhalf-panel, as shown in No. 7, while shelf colours for open access can\r\nbe added at the points suggested in Section 243.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Specimens of Class Lettering and Numbering\r\n(Section 340).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=340.= The principal alternative method is that mentioned in the chapter\r\non classification (Section 241), where the book is lettered in\r\naccordance with what is thought to be the natural process in arranging\r\nand finding books. Thus a book is arranged on the shelves first by its\r\nclass, second by its author, third by its title, except in the case of\r\nindividual biography, where the name of the biographee takes the panel\r\nwhich in other books is devoted to the author, and the author takes the\r\npanel below the title. Fig. 128 will indicate sufficiently the\r\nappearance of such a lettering scheme, and will show how it subordinates\r\nordinary usage to library purposes, especially in the third example.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 brings Dowden’s book into the group of Shakesperian books, and\r\nshows the spelling of the name preferred in the catalogue for the\r\nheading; and No. 4 shows the method of indicating both the real name of\r\nthe author, which is the catalogue heading and arranging name, and also\r\nthe author’s pseudonym.\r\n\r\n\r\n=341. Specification.=--Whether or not library binding should be done by\r\ntender, which in practice means giving the work to the lowest bidder, is\r\na question which different places must settle in different ways.\r\nSometimes tenders are insisted upon by the municipality for all work\r\ndone with public funds. It must be recognized, however, that binding is\r\na very varied matter, some books requiring special treatment, and that\r\nbinders are equally varied in their ability to do special work. The best\r\nresults can only be obtained if the librarian has power to send certain\r\nclasses of work to the firms best qualified to deal with them. So far as\r\ngeneral binding is concerned, the present-day combination of\r\nmaster-binders has levelled up prices until every binder quotes\r\npractically the same figures; so there does not seem much to be gained\r\nby tenders, except that legal formality which is so much approved by\r\npublic authorities. If it is used, bookbinding specification should\r\ninclude every point which has any bearing on the cost, finish and\r\nworkmanship of the books. The specification of the Society of Arts and\r\nthat drafted by Mr Douglas Cockerell are very good, and many of their\r\npoints could be included in a specification for library binding. As\r\nrequirements differ in every library, it is impossible to attempt the\r\ndrafting of a model specification which will meet every case, but the\r\ndetails set out in the following draft may prove useful and suggestive:\r\n\r\nDRAFT BOOKBINDING SPECIFICATION.\r\n\r\n  To the Public Libraries Committee\r\n\r\n  of. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n  Date. . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen,\r\n\r\n  . . . . . . undertake to bind books for the. . . . . . . . . .

It is a good plan\r\nto have the corners of the leaves slightly rounded, but added corners of\r\nvellum often result in the roughing-up of the cloth which fits down to\r\ntheir edges, and there is no great benefit arising from the rounding of\r\nthe corners of the covers.

Records and Checks.=--When a lot of books for binding is sent out\r\nit must be accompanied by a set of instructions to the binder, and a\r\ncopy of this must be retained at the library as a record and to check\r\nthe books when returned. The most usual plan is to send out a binding\r\nsheet, ruled as in Fig. 129, on which are entered the particulars of the\r\nbooks requiring binding. These particulars are also entered in a binding\r\nbook, ruled exactly the same as the sheets, and in the last column of\r\nthis the books are marked off as returned. This result, and an actual\r\nfacsimile copy, may be obtained by using a duplicating book, the sheet\r\nsent to the binder being so perforated as to be easily removable. The\r\ndouble copying involved in making out two separate sheets is thus\r\navoided. It is usual to make the binder’s messenger check over and sign\r\nfor every lot of books at the end of the page. Another method, which\r\npossesses the advantage of enabling the binder to distribute the work in\r\nhis workshop, and makes every book carry its own instruction, is as\r\nfollows: Procure a large book of perforated slips, with a counterpart\r\npage, unperforated, behind every page of slips, in the style of a\r\nmanifold order book. Have these pages ruled as in Fig. 130, and\r\nprogressively numbered.\r\n\r\nOr separate order slips, as under (Fig. 131), can be used, and their\r\npurport briefly entered in a binding book ruled to show title, class and\r\ndate returned, with a column for a consecutive number, which of course\r\nwould be written on the corresponding slip.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+-------------------+\r\n  | No.               | Date sent         |\r\n  +===================+===================+\r\n  |               LETTERING               |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+\r\n  | TITLE                                 |\r\n  |                                       |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+\r\n  | AUTHOR                                |\r\n  |                                       |\r\n  +---------------------------------------+\r\n  | VOL.

Dates can be stamped to save time.\r\nThe slips are then detached and placed in the books to which they refer.\r\nAn ordinary order form is then made out in some such terms as:\r\n\r\n  Mr.................... will please bind as per contract and separate\r\n  instructions the ............ books sent herewith, comprising numbers\r\n  ......... to ............\r\n\r\nThe binder’s messenger can sign the book on the last counterfoil, in a\r\nform like this:\r\n\r\n  Received on .......... from the ................ Public Library ......\r\n  volumes for binding.\r\n\r\nOr a rubber stamp with these words and blanks can be used. The object of\r\nthe progressive number is to afford a ready means of identifying\r\ninstructions and ascertaining in an easy manner the number of books\r\nbound in any one year. These numbers may also be written in ink at the\r\nend of the letterpress of each book, as a means of ascertaining how\r\noften any book has been re-bound. The price, if carried into the column\r\nreserved for the progressive number in the counterpart, will also be a\r\nuseful record to keep. By simply referring to the progressive numbers it\r\nis possible to ascertain the price paid for successive re-bindings, and\r\nto keep a check on the whole of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=343.= Repairs should not be entered in this book. It is better to use\r\nan ordinary order sheet and copy it in the press order book. It can be\r\nheaded:\r\n\r\n  Mr............ will please re-case the following books:\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  Mr............ will please repair the following books, as per\r\n  instructions added to each:\r\n\r\n\r\n=344. Miscellaneous.=--Tape or ribbon BOOK-MARKS are sometimes placed in\r\npublic library books, but a much more obvious and useful plan is to\r\nprint a special book-mark with a folding-over tab, which can be placed\r\nin _all_ books which are issued, and not confined simply to those which\r\nare re-bound. A good form of marker can have one or two pointed rules\r\nfor the due care and preservation of books printed on a conspicuous\r\npart.\r\n\r\nSome enterprising firms give away book-marks of various kinds, many\r\npublishers insert advertising cards which serve as markers, and\r\noccasionally an advertising agent will supply a library with book-marks,\r\nand pay for the privilege, on being allowed to use some part of it for\r\nadvertisements from which he draws the revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=345.= Special END-PAPERS have been introduced in a few libraries to be\r\nplaced in re-bound books. They serve the purpose of an ownership mark\r\nmore effectually than a book-plate, but, of course, they can only be\r\nused in the books which happen to require re-binding. The Croydon\r\nend-paper is quite an elaborate design, giving compartments showing the\r\narms, monogram and a view of the town hall. End-papers of this kind are\r\na luxury which few public libraries can afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n=346.= An effective way of placing an indelible mark of ownership upon a\r\npublic library book is to impress a blind stamp upon the outside front\r\nboard. This can be done by means of a screw-press and a special die, and\r\nneed not cost more than £10. Any member of the staff can impress such a\r\nstamp, and it is better than confining this mark of ownership simply to\r\nbooks which have been re-bound. A circular stamp is best, as it will\r\nalways appear straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=347.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Bailey, A. L. Library Bookbinding, 1916. H. W. Wilson Co.\r\n\r\n  Chivers, Cedric.

General.=---A public library is an institution based upon broad\r\nlines of mutual co-operation, in which every citizen has equal rights,\r\nand in which the rules should be drafted to protect the common\r\nproprietary rights, without penalizing any section of the community.\r\nHence the liberal attitude which recognizes that the whole purpose of\r\nlibrarianship is to get books used must be brought to the drafting of\r\nrules. Fortunately this attitude is becoming more common, if it is not\r\nuniversal, and the whole tendency of modern public library work is to\r\nbreak down all barriers between the readers and the freest use of books.\r\nIndeed, it is better to lose a few books yearly than to protect them\r\nfrom the very few dishonest people who may live in the community by\r\nmeans which militate against the liberty of readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=349. Hours.=--The number of hours during which municipal libraries\r\nshould remain open to the public will vary according to the local\r\nconditions, staff and funds of every town and district. In small places,\r\nwith scanty populations and little libraries with but one attendant, a\r\nfew hours open at night on several days in the week, according to\r\nrequirements, will serve every practical purpose. In towns of a fair\r\nsize, of say from 10,000 to 30,000 people, the reading rooms should be\r\nopen all day uninterruptedly from 10 to 9 or 10, but the lending library\r\nneed only be kept open from 10 to 2 and from 5 to 9. In large towns of\r\nover 40,000 inhabitants, the libraries should remain open all day from\r\nearly morning till late at night--say from 8 A.M. till 10 P.M. for\r\nnewsrooms; 9 A.M. till 10 P.M. for reference libraries; 10 A.M. till 9\r\nP.M. for lending libraries; and 4 till 8 P.M. for juvenile departments,\r\nif any. There should be no interruptions, at any rate so far as\r\ndepartments other than the lending library are concerned, to these\r\nservices, either in the way of half- or whole-day closing to suit the\r\nstaff, or any irregularity in hours. The public library is a bureau for\r\nthe supply of information, and should be found open at any time in a\r\nworking-day, during which people are likely to use its resources. In\r\nlarge towns there is no necessary connexion between the public hours and\r\nthe staff, and in an important matter of this kind, which affects the\r\nconvenience of hundreds of people, the policy of employing extra\r\nassistance, in order to keep the library open all day and every day\r\nwithout overworking the staff, should not be questioned. It may be\r\nargued that if one town of a certain size can keep its public libraries\r\nopen all day and every day (save Sundays and holidays, of course), every\r\nsimilar town and all larger ones can easily do likewise. But, as may be\r\nseen by reference to Greenwood’s _British Library Year Book_, 1900-1901,\r\nthis is not invariably the case. A careful and well-constructed\r\ntime-sheet will often get over difficulties which may seem to arise from\r\nunder-staffing or other conditions. There have been, and possibly still\r\nmay be, libraries in which, largely because of badly constructed\r\ntime-sheets, the assistants are given only one evening off weekly, and\r\nwork from eight to nine hours daily, although the library is closed for\r\na half-day every week, and thus both assistants and public are\r\nincommoded.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, to dogmatize upon the question of hours is unwise, as\r\nlocal circumstances condition the question so much. Moreover, the recent\r\nmovements in the industrial and commercial worlds are in the direction\r\nof reducing working hours, and most people are now at liberty before 7\r\nP.M., a fact which does away with the _necessity_, if not the\r\nconvenience, of keeping libraries open to the late hours until recently\r\nin vogue. Again, a suburban library, with a population which returns\r\nfrom a neighbouring city in the evenings, has need to be open later than\r\none, say, in the city itself. The whole matter is one of public\r\nconvenience, and if it is remembered that to have the library used to\r\nits fullest limit is the ideal, the hours will be chosen well. At the\r\nsame time, there are always readers who prefer to use the library in the\r\nlast hour of the day, whatever that hour may be. If the closing hour is\r\nnine, they will arrive at 8.45; if eight, at 7.45, and so on; it is a\r\ncurious, not uncommon human trait, which may be borne in mind when hours\r\nare being arranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n=350. Age Limits.=--There are wide differences in the practice as\r\nregards the limit of age from which persons are allowed to use the\r\nlibraries, but within recent years the opinion on this point has\r\nundergone considerable change. Formerly persons under eighteen and\r\nsixteen were forbidden the use of public libraries; now such high limits\r\nare very uncommon, though fourteen is still frequently seen in the rules\r\nof otherwise progressive libraries. Of course, local conditions must\r\nreceive due consideration in this matter, though it is difficult to\r\nthink of any circumstance which calls for any distinction being made\r\nbetween children of twelve and those of fourteen years of age. There are\r\nhundreds of bright, intelligent lads and girls of twelve who are the\r\nequals in knowledge and ability of their fellows of thirteen and\r\nfourteen years of age; in fact, children do not fit, intellectually,\r\ninto age-compartments; their capacities are surprisingly individual.\r\nWhat seems reasonable is the entire abolition of age limits in lending\r\nlibraries, subject to the reservation that the librarian should have\r\ndiscretionary power to refuse to issue books to any child unable to read\r\nand write. Failing this, the limit might be fixed at twelve where there\r\nare no separate juvenile libraries, but reduced to seven where such\r\ndepartments exist. There is a certain amount of trouble and\r\ninconvenience to adults resulting from admitting very young children,\r\nespecially in open access and other libraries without separate juvenile\r\naccommodation, and this would be partly met by the compromise proposed.\r\nSeparate children’s libraries are the solution of the difficulty, and,\r\nwhen these can be provided all round, the age limit downwards can be\r\nabolished so far as they are concerned, while the limit for the adult\r\nlibrary can be raised to twelve or fourteen. But adequate provision\r\nshould be made for interchanging, and all necessary facilities provided\r\nfor enabling intelligent young people under the limit to procure\r\nsuitable more advanced books if desired, and also for allowing adults to\r\nrevive their youth by allowing them access to the works of Ballantyne,\r\nHenty and other authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=351.= As regards age limits in reference libraries and reading rooms,\r\nthere is more to be said for keeping them high than in the case of\r\nlending libraries, especially when there are separate children’s rooms.\r\nBut, generally speaking, there is no strong reason for excluding\r\nwell-conducted boys or girls from a popular reading room, whatever their\r\nages may be, provided they do not come during school hours, or do not\r\notherwise make the library a place in which to hide from some duty. In\r\nsome libraries, with age limits of twelve, fourteen or over, it is the\r\npractice to turn away younger children from news and reading rooms in\r\ncases where they are accompanied by their parents or elders. This is an\r\nabuse of a rule which was only intended to protect readers from the\r\nnoisy incursions of irresponsible youngsters, who are wont to stray into\r\npublic places out of sheer devilment, or accident, or excess of\r\ncuriosity. To apply this rule to children in arms, or youngsters\r\naccompanied by and in charge of their elders, is simply officialism\r\ncalculated to injure the popularity and prestige of municipal libraries.\r\nThe age limit for a reference library designed for students, with open\r\naccess to the shelves, should be fixed at fourteen or sixteen, with\r\ndiscretionary power to the librarian to grant permits to any studious\r\nyoungster under that age. Where access to public reading rooms and\r\njuvenile departments is easy, there seems no good reason for throwing\r\nopen the reference library to all and sundry, unless under the\r\nsafeguards suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n=352. The Borrowing Right.=--There are several points in connexion with\r\nthe borrowing rights of various classes of citizens which it is\r\ndesirable to notice, especially as they have much bearing on the\r\nquestion of a library’s popularity and good management. In some towns\r\nthe borrowing right is strictly confined to ratepayers or residents in\r\nthe library district. Employees who live outside the district are\r\nexcluded, but for what particular reason it is difficult to understand.\r\nAn employee contributes directly to the material well-being of the\r\ndistrict in which his work lies; he contributes indirectly but\r\nsubstantially towards the rates; he spends most of his waking and all\r\nhis working hours in the district; and in other ways he is as much a\r\ncitizen as the resident who works outside the district and only sleeps\r\nin it at night. It is impossible to discover any reason for the\r\ndistinction made between employee and resident in some places, and it\r\nmay be pointed out that plenty of large towns grant the borrowing right\r\nto employees without the slightest inconvenience, difficulty or\r\ninjustice to anyone. A further wise liberality permits borrowing\r\nprivileges to all non-resident scholars and students at schools or\r\nsimilar institutions in the town. Similar arguments apply in favour of\r\nsuch an arrangement, and these young folks are usually readers of a\r\nvaluable type.\r\n\r\n\r\n=353.= Teachers and others engaged in educational work should be dealt\r\nwith as generously as possible, and should be lent as many books as they\r\nneed at a time for purposes of their work. From six to twelve works are\r\nfrequently required by a teacher in preparing a subject, and he should\r\nbe allowed to have them, the most liberal interpretation possible being\r\ngiven to this privilege. Obviously no teacher should be permitted to\r\nmake his needs an excuse for borrowing batches of current and popular\r\nworks to the detriment of other readers, but it is better to risk even\r\nthis than to fail him in what may be an important matter. A teacher\r\nreaches farther than the average individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n=354.= Another regulation which tells against the interests of municipal\r\nlibraries is that in which every intending borrower, ratepayer or\r\notherwise, is required to obtain the signatures of one or two registered\r\nratepayers as guarantors before a ticket will be issued. It is not\r\nnecessary to imagine reasons for this very serious obstacle to intending\r\nborrowers. Since many large and small towns dispense with this\r\nprecaution in the case of ratepayers, and allow non-ratepayers and\r\ncompounding householders to have tickets on the guarantee or\r\nrecommendation of one ratepayer or on leaving a small deposit, there is\r\nno reason why this elaborate double guarantee should not be abolished\r\nall round. The time will doubtless come when guarantees of all kinds\r\nwill be abolished and suitable recommendations substituted.\r\n\r\nThere are other antiquated and needless restrictions in connexion with\r\nthe borrowing right which need not be specified at length, but are\r\ngrouped together here as examples of bad rules for which there is little\r\njustification.\r\n\r\n  1. The illegal charge of 1d. or 2d. for tickets or voucher forms,\r\n  still levied in some places in defiance of the Public Libraries Act,\r\n  1892, Section 11, Sub-section (3); and various judicial decisions.\r\n\r\n  2. Requiring more than three days’ notice before issuing a borrower’s\r\n  ticket. (In some places borrowers are required to wait for a week or\r\n  fourteen days from the date of lodging their application for tickets.)\r\n\r\n  3. Limiting the time for reading books to less than fourteen days.\r\n\r\n  4. Refusing to renew books by post-card, letter, telephone, or\r\n  messenger, and requiring that the actual books shall be brought back\r\n  to be re-dated.\r\n\r\n  5. The imposition of fines amounting to more than 1d. per week or part\r\n  of a week for overdue books. (In certain libraries, some of which are\r\n  not pressed for funds, the exorbitant fine of 1d. per day is imposed\r\n  for overdue books, with a time limit of seven, ten and fourteen days.\r\n  This question is further considered in Section 355.)\r\n\r\n  6. Refusing to exchange books on the same day as that on which they\r\n  are issued. (As the books which are brought back for exchange are\r\n  usually those which the borrowers have read previously, there seems\r\n  little need for such a disobliging rule.)\r\n\r\n  7. Refusing to issue books on the same day as that on which they are\r\n  returned to the library. (A common practice in the old-fashioned\r\n  libraries, worked by means of charging ledgers, but still found in\r\n  several much more up-to-date libraries. The same craze for tantalizing\r\n  the public has in a minor degree infected some open access lending\r\n  libraries which will not re-issue returned books until they have been\r\n  replaced on their shelves by the assistants.)\r\n\r\n  8. Charging borrowers 1d. or 2d. as a penalty for losing their tickets\r\n  and requiring them to be re-issued. (Query, a contravention of the\r\n  Act.)\r\n\r\n  9. Disallowing the use of ink for copying purposes in all\r\n  circumstances.\r\n\r\n  10. Allowing only one volume at a time to borrowers.\r\n\r\n  11. Restricting the number of books which a reference reader may have\r\n  at one time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=355. Fines and Penalties.=--So long as the present rate limitation\r\nremains as fixed by successive Acts of Parliament, fines will continue\r\nto be levied in British municipal libraries. There is no doubt that the\r\nsmall incomes realized in most public libraries from the niggardly\r\nprovision made by Parliament is one cause of the efforts made in many\r\ncases to increase funds, by imposing fines of varying degrees of\r\nseverity upon the borrowers from lending libraries. This is, indeed, the\r\nprincipal reason, though it is said that, but for penalties of some\r\nsort, books would never be returned at all. There may be some truth in\r\nthis, as regards a small proportion of borrowers, but the experience of\r\nManchester and some American towns where no fines are imposed rather\r\nmodifies the statement as to the supposed disastrous effects of\r\nnon-fining. This, like many another question, is one on which the\r\ninexperienced theoretical objector appeals to his imagination for\r\ndetails of all sorts of hardships, inconveniences and dangers arising\r\nas the result of abolishing fines. Every argument is directed towards\r\nshowing how the library would suffer, and incidentally it has been\r\nmentioned that, perhaps, the undue retention of a popular book would\r\nprove highly inconvenient to other readers who wanted it. These matters\r\nneed not be discussed, since it must be obvious that popular books can\r\nalways be duplicated to a certain extent; that more diligence can be\r\nexercised in the tracing, pursuit and ingathering of overdue popular\r\nbooks; and that there are methods of punishing hardened delinquent\r\nborrowers of this kind, by suspending their tickets, as is done at\r\nManchester without serious results. But it is quite evident that in\r\nBritain fining for overdue books will be maintained until it is declared\r\nillegal--and no doubt, with bye-laws not legally confirmed, it is a\r\ndoubtful practice, in England at all events--or Parliament has removed\r\nthe rate limitation or provided other means of financial assistance,\r\nwithout all this scraping, pinching and doubtful means of increasing\r\nfunds. What is suggested is more latitude in the imposition of fines,\r\nand a less eager desire to make money over the business than is implied\r\nin such fines as 1d. a day, and fines of two, three, four and five cents\r\nas charged in some American libraries. No library has a right or any\r\nneed to make a profit out of such a transaction as fining for overdue\r\nbooks, and it would be better to make a uniform charge of 1d. per week,\r\nor portion of a week, for books retained over a fortnight, when not\r\nrenewed by postcard or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=356. Holiday and Sunday Opening.=--Whether libraries are to be opened\r\nor not on public holidays and Sundays is largely a matter for local\r\noption. In some places libraries have been experimentally opened on\r\nPUBLIC HOLIDAYS on the sentimental plea that many persons are unable to\r\nuse them at any other time, and the result has been anything but\r\nencouraging. In other places, like seaside and holiday resorts, they\r\nhave been opened on such holidays, with decided advantage to trippers\r\nseeking shelter from inclement weather. Generally speaking, all\r\nlibraries should be _closed_ on public holidays, on the grounds that a\r\ngeneral holiday should be generally observed as such, and that people\r\nare much better in the fresh air than sitting indoors in libraries or\r\nanywhere else on such occasions. If any exception to this were made it\r\nwould be to open only on wet and stormy public holidays, but always\r\nexcept Christmas, and, in the case of Scotland, New Year’s Day. The\r\npublic holidays in Britain are too few and far between to effect any\r\nradical influence upon libraries or readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=357.= As regards SUNDAYS, conditions are rather different. To begin\r\nwith there are more of them, and they come at regular intervals. But\r\nunless the need for Sunday opening can be demonstrated by a satisfactory\r\nresult derived from a series of trial openings, it is better for the\r\nlibraries not to be opened as a mere concession to the views of certain\r\nsocieties, or the supposed utility of the movement to people who are\r\nalleged to be unable to come on week-days. If experiment proves that\r\nSunday opening is meeting a real need, open the libraries by all means,\r\nbut not otherwise. As a compromise it is suggested that if Sunday\r\nopening is decided upon, the reading rooms only should be open between\r\nthe hours of 3 and 9 P.M. on every Sunday between October and May\r\ninclusive. There is little need for Sunday opening in warm\r\nweather--people are much better out-of-doors--especially if, as is\r\nusually the case, attendances fall off greatly.\r\n\r\nShould the Sunday opening question become a burning one in any town,\r\narrangements might be made to open the reading room and reference\r\nlibrary, provided at least 500 citizens take out tickets as an earnest\r\nof their intention to use the library. It is doubtful if in any town\r\nSunday opening has been limited to students and other inquirers, but it\r\nwould form a reasonable manner of settling a difficult question should\r\nopinion be sharply divided.\r\n\r\nAs regards ways and means of carrying on the business of a public\r\nlibrary on holidays and Sundays, special arrangements must be made, both\r\nas regards the necessary attendants, heating, lighting and cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n=358. Enforcement of Rules.=--There is nothing in the original English\r\nor Irish Acts which gives power to enforce rules and bye-laws, but in\r\nthe Act of 1901 such may be obtained provided the rules are approved by\r\nthe Local Government Board. In the Scotch Act very full provisions are\r\nmade for the confirmation and enforcement of bye-laws. Clause 22 of the\r\nAct of 1887 reads: “It shall be lawful for the committee to make\r\nbye-laws for regulating all or any matters and things whatsoever\r\nconnected with the control, management, protection and use of any\r\nproperty, articles or things under their control for the purposes of\r\nthis Act, and to impose such penalties for breaches of such bye-laws,\r\nnot exceeding £5 for each offence, as may be considered expedient; and\r\nfrom time to time, as they shall think fit, to repeal, alter, vary or\r\nre-enact any such bye-laws, provided always that such bye-laws and\r\nalterations thereof shall not be repugnant to the law of Scotland, and\r\nbefore being acted on shall be signed by a quorum of the committee, and,\r\nexcept in so far as they relate solely to the officers or servants of\r\nthe committee, such bye-laws shall be approved of by the magistrates and\r\ncouncil, or the board, as the case may be, and shall be approved of and\r\nconfirmed by the sheriff of the county in which the burgh or parish, or\r\nthe greater part of the area thereof, is situated.” Provision is also\r\nmade for advertising and giving due notice of intention to adopt the\r\nbye-laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n=359.= It should be stated, however, that there are quite a number of\r\ncases in which magistrates’ decisions in England have upheld the rules\r\nof Public Library Committees with regard to recovery of fines for\r\noverdue books, the value of books lost and guaranteed, and on other\r\npoints. In some of these cases it has not been held or suggested that\r\nguarantee or voucher forms should be stamped as agreements, or that any\r\nlimit under £5 should be placed on the amount of the guarantor’s\r\nliability. Nevertheless, a value limit of £1 or £2 might be placed upon\r\na guarantor’s liability, and that will dispose of the awkward point as\r\nto the agreement being stamped.\r\n\r\n\r\n=360. Draft Rules and Regulations.=--These draft rules are based upon a\r\ncareful examination of the principal bye-laws adopted by many of the\r\nprincipal libraries in Britain and the United States, with certain\r\nmodifications to harmonize them with certain leading principles\r\nadvocated throughout this book. No two places are exactly alike in all\r\ntheir circumstances and local conditions, so that no library is likely\r\nto adopt these rules exactly as they stand. But they contain suggestions\r\nwhich may be found useful in drawing up and adopting a series of\r\nsuitable rules, and enabling most vital points to be met. Some\r\nlibraries have an enormous number of rules, amounting in some cases to\r\nfifty or sixty items, but many of these are quite unnecessary and need\r\nnot be considered. The draft rules drawn up by the Local Government\r\nBoard may be obtained if thought needful; but they are printed\r\nseparately in the _Library Association Record_, 1903, p. 28. The fewer\r\nand simpler the rules the more likely are the people to read and observe\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARY\r\n\r\n  RULES AND REGULATIONS\r\n\r\n  GENERAL\r\n\r\n  1. The Liberton Public Library is a society established for purposes\r\n  of literature and science exclusively. The librarian shall have the\r\n  general charge of the library, and shall be responsible for the safe\r\n  keeping of the books and for all the property belonging thereto.\r\n\r\n  2. The library is supported in part by a rate levied in accordance\r\n  with the Public Libraries Acts and in part by annual voluntary\r\n  contributions of money and gifts of books and periodicals. The library\r\n  committee shall not make any dividend, gift, division, or bonus in\r\n  money unto or between any of the members.\r\n\r\n  3. Admission is free to all parts of the library during the hours of\r\n  opening, but no person shall be admitted who is disorderly, uncleanly\r\n  or in a state of intoxication. Smoking, betting and loud conversation\r\n  or other objectionable practices are also forbidden in the rooms or\r\n  passages of the library.\r\n\r\n  4. The librarian shall have power to suspend the use of the ticket of\r\n  any borrower, and refuse books or deny the use of the reading rooms to\r\n  any reader who shall neglect to comply with any of these rules and\r\n  regulations, such reader having the right of appeal to the library\r\n  committee, who shall also decide all other disputes between readers\r\n  and the library officials.\r\n\r\n  5. Readers desirous of proposing books for addition to the library may\r\n  do so by entering, on slips (_or_ in a book) kept for the purpose, the\r\n  titles and particulars of publication of such books, which will then\r\n  be submitted to the committee at their first meeting thereafter. All\r\n  suggestions on management to be written on slips or sent by letter to\r\n  the committee.\r\n\r\n  6. Any person who unlawfully or maliciously destroys or damages any\r\n  book, map, print, manuscript or other article belonging to the\r\n  libraries shall be liable to prosecution for misdemeanour under the\r\n  provisions of 24 & 25 _Vict., c. 97, An Act to consolidate and amend\r\n  the Statute Law of England and Ireland relating to malicious injuries\r\n  to property_, 1861. The provisions of the statute entitled 61 & 62\r\n  _Vict., c. 53, An Act to provide for the punishment of Offences in\r\n  Libraries_, 1898, shall also apply.\r\n\r\n  REFERENCE DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n  7. The library and reading room shall remain open on week-days from 9\r\n  A.M. till 10 P.M. (and on Sundays, from October to May inclusive, from\r\n  3 to 9 P.M.), but shall be closed on Christmas Day (New Year’s Day),\r\n  all public holidays, and such other days as the committee may from\r\n  time to time appoint.\r\n\r\n  8. Every person on entering the reference library shall sign his or\r\n  her name, with the correct address, in a book kept for the purpose.\r\n  Anyone giving a false name or address shall be liable to prosecution,\r\n  and shall not afterwards be allowed to use the library.\r\n\r\n  9. Every person before leaving the room shall return the book or books\r\n  consulted into the hands of the librarian or his assistants, and must\r\n  not replace books taken from the open shelves, but leave them with the\r\n  assistant at the exit.\r\n\r\n  10. Any work in the lending department, if not in use, excepting\r\n  Fiction, may be had on application at the reference library counter\r\n  for perusal in the reading room, but on no account must such books be\r\n  taken from the room.\r\n\r\n  11. Illustrations of all kinds may be copied, but not traced, save by\r\n  permission of the librarian. Extracts from books may be copied in\r\n  pencil. The use of ink is only permitted at certain tables which are\r\n  reserved for the purpose. Certain works are only issued after a\r\n  written application to the library committee.\r\n\r\n  LENDING DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n  12. The lending library is open daily for the issue and receipt of\r\n  books every week-day from 10 A.M. till 9 P.M., but shall be closed on\r\n  Sundays, Christmas Day (New Year’s Day), all public holidays and such\r\n  other days as the committee may from time to time appoint.\r\n\r\n  13. Books shall be borrowed for home reading only by persons rated,\r\n  resident or employed in the Borough of ..........., or qualified by\r\n  Rule 18.\r\n\r\n  14. All persons whose names appear on the current Roll of Electors of\r\n  the Borough, or in the local directories as residents, may borrow\r\n  books on their own responsibility, after filling up an application for\r\n  a borrower’s ticket, on a form provided for the purpose.\r\n\r\n  15. Other residents, and non-resident employees in the borough, over\r\n  twelve (fourteen) years of age, may borrow books, but must first\r\n  obtain a guarantee (or recommendation) from a duly qualified person,\r\n  as defined in Rule 14, and must sign an application for a borrower’s\r\n  ticket, on forms to be provided by the librarian. But no such\r\n  guarantor shall be allowed to assume responsibility for more than\r\n  three other persons, unless by special arrangement with the committee,\r\n  and in no single case shall his or her liability exceed £2 per person\r\n  guaranteed.\r\n\r\n  16. Any person resident or employed in the borough, unable to obtain\r\n  the signature of a qualified resident as a guarantee, may borrow books\r\n  on leaving a deposit of 10s. with the librarian. The guarantee of the\r\n  recognized head officials of Government departments, Friendly\r\n  Societies and similar organizations may be accepted at the discretion\r\n  of the Committee in lieu of an ordinary guarantee, for persons who are\r\n  employed in the district.\r\n\r\n  17. The Application and Guarantee Form, duly signed, must be delivered\r\n  to the librarian, and if, on examination, it is found correct, the\r\n  borrower’s ticket will be issued three days (_or_ at once) after\r\n  (excluding Sundays), but will only be delivered to the borrower in\r\n  person. This ticket will be available at the central library or any\r\n  branch or branches.\r\n\r\n  18. In accordance with Section 11 of the Public Libraries Act, 1892,\r\n  the committee will lend books to persons, other than those duly\r\n  qualified under Rules 13-16, who pay an annual subscription of 7s.\r\n  6d.; but such borrowers must conform, in every respect, to all the\r\n  rules of the library, and shall have no privileges other than those\r\n  possessed by the other borrowers.\r\n\r\n  19. The committee shall issue additional tickets to readers, available\r\n  for all classes of literature save Fiction. Any duly enrolled borrower\r\n  may have one of these extra tickets on filling up an application form\r\n  as for an ordinary ticket. School teachers may have more than one\r\n  ticket of this class on application to the librarian.\r\n\r\n  20. All tickets and vouchers must be renewed annually, each ticket and\r\n  voucher being reckoned available for one year from date of issue.[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] In some libraries the practice has arisen of making tickets\r\n       permanent, as long as the holder resides in the district, without\r\n       renewal annually. In place of renewal, a revision takes place, to\r\n       ensure accuracy of addresses, etc.; where this is so, Rule 20 is\r\n       unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  21. The borrower must return each volume lent within fifteen days,\r\n  including days of issue and return, and shall be liable to a fine of\r\n  1d. per week or portion of a week for each volume lent, if not\r\n  returned within that period, but the issue of a book may be renewed\r\n  for a further period of fifteen days, dating from the day of\r\n  intimation, on notice being given to the librarian either personally\r\n  or in writing, and no further renewal will be allowed if the book is\r\n  required by another reader. Books which are much in demand may,\r\n  however, be refused such renewal at the discretion of the librarian.\r\n\r\n  22. Each volume on return shall be delivered to the librarian or his\r\n  assistant, and if on examination it be found to have sustained any\r\n  damage or injury, the person to whom it was lent, or his or her\r\n  guarantor, shall be required to pay the amount of damage done or to\r\n  procure a new copy or series of equal value, and, in the latter case,\r\n  the person supplying the new copy shall be entitled to the damaged\r\n  copy or series on depositing the new one.\r\n\r\n  23. Borrowers who are unable to obtain a particular non-fictional\r\n  book, and desire that it shall be retained for them on its return,\r\n  must give its title, number, etc., to the assistant, and pay 1d. to\r\n  cover cost of posting an intimation that it is available for issue;\r\n  but no book will be kept longer than the time mentioned in the notice\r\n  sent. Novels cannot be reserved under this rule.\r\n\r\n  24. Borrowers are required to keep the books clean. They are not to\r\n  turn down or stain the leaves, nor to make pencil or other marks upon\r\n  them. They must take the earliest opportunity of reporting any damage\r\n  or injury done to the books they receive, otherwise they will be held\r\n  responsible for the value of the same.\r\n\r\n  25. If an infectious disease breaks out in any house containing books\r\n  belonging to the library, such books are not to be returned to the\r\n  library, but must be handed over to the Medical Officer of Health or\r\n  any sanitary officer acting on his behalf. Until such infected house\r\n  is declared free of disease by the Medical Officer of Health, no books\r\n  will be issued from the libraries to any person or persons residing\r\n  therein. In similar circumstances non-resident ratepayers or employees\r\n  must return their books to the Medical Officer, and cease to use the\r\n  libraries till their residences are certified free from infection.\r\n\r\n  26. Only actual borrowers who are enrolled on the register of the\r\n  library shall have the right of direct access to the book-shelves, but\r\n  their representatives may be admitted at the discretion of the\r\n  librarian or his assistants. To prevent disappointment, these\r\n  representatives should come provided with a list of several\r\n  book-titles and numbers.\r\n\r\n  27. Any change in the residence of borrowers or their guarantors, or\r\n  notice of withdrawal of guarantee, must be intimated to the librarian\r\n  within one week.\r\n\r\n  28. Borrowers leaving the district or ceasing to use the library are\r\n  required to return their tickets to the librarian in order to have\r\n  them cancelled; otherwise they and their guarantors will be held\r\n  responsible for any books taken out in their names.\r\n\r\n  29. No person under twelve years of age shall be eligible to borrow\r\n  books or make use of the adult library, except by the librarian’s\r\n  permission.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL READING AND MAGAZINE ROOMS\r\n\r\n  30. The general reading room shall remain open on week-days from 8\r\n  A.M. till 10 P.M., and the magazine room from 9 A.M. till 10 P.M. (and\r\n  on Sundays, from October to May inclusive, from 3 to 9 P.M.). Both\r\n  rooms shall be closed on Christmas Day (New Year’s Day), all public\r\n  holidays, and such other days as the committee may from time to time\r\n  appoint.\r\n\r\n  31. No persons under twelve years of age, unless accompanied by their\r\n  parents or elders capable of controlling them, shall be allowed to use\r\n  these rooms, except by permission of the librarian or his assistants.\r\n\r\n  32. Any persons who use these rooms for purposes of betting, or who in\r\n  any way cause obstruction or disorder in these or any other rooms or\r\n  passages of the libraries, are liable to be proceeded against under\r\n  the provisions of 61 & 62 _Vict., c. 53, An Act to Provide for the\r\n  Punishment of Offences in Libraries_, 1898.\r\n\r\n  33. Readers in possession of newspapers or other periodicals must be\r\n  prepared to resign them to any other reader who may ask to peruse\r\n  them, ten minutes after the request has been made through one of the\r\n  library staff.\r\n\r\n  JUVENILE ROOM\r\n\r\n  34. The juvenile reading room and library shall remain open from 4\r\n  till 8 P.M. daily on Monday to Friday inclusive, and from 10 A.M. till\r\n  6 P.M. on Saturdays.\r\n\r\n  35. The admission is free to every boy or girl under (twelve) fourteen\r\n  years of age residing in the Borough of . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\r\n  who is able to write and read; but they must obtain a guarantee (or\r\n  recommendation) from their parents or school teacher as to good\r\n  behaviour and safe return of all books.\r\n\r\n  36. Only one book per week will be allowed to each borrower.\r\n\r\n  37. Application for tickets admitting to the reading room must be made\r\n  at the library.\r\n\r\nThere are certain admonitory rules which are best displayed in frames in\r\nplacard form, such as: SILENCE IS REQUESTED; NO CONVERSATION ALLOWED; NO\r\nDOGS ADMITTED; CYCLISTS ARE REQUESTED TO KEEP THEIR MACHINES OUTSIDE THE\r\nBUILDING; PLEASE WIPE YOUR BOOTS; NO ADMISSION THIS WAY; NO SMOKING\r\nALLOWED; and so on. Some of the general rules would be much more\r\neffective if displayed in this form.\r\n\r\n\r\n=361. Notes on Rules.=--1 and 2. These rules are included for the\r\npurpose of qualifying for the certificate of exemption from income-tax\r\nand local rates, as described in Sections 37-40.\r\n\r\n15. In some libraries the guarantee of responsible heads of large\r\ngovernment and other departments is accepted for all the employees, and\r\nsecretaries of associations and school teachers have also been accepted.\r\nIn the first case the association has become responsible for all its\r\neligible members, and signs through its secretary. In the second case\r\nthe teacher assumes responsibility for all his eligible pupils. It\r\nshould be understood that a teacher’s guarantee does not involve the\r\nteacher in financial responsibility, but is an indication of his opinion\r\nthat the applicant may benefit by the use of the library, and usually\r\nincludes the assumption that he will use his moral influence to secure\r\nthe due care and return of books. Some libraries have abolished the\r\nguarantee for non-ratepayers.\r\n\r\n16. DEPOSITORS should be treated as ordinary borrowers, and their\r\ntickets and numbering should go through the same routine. The money\r\nreceived from deposits may either be paid into the bank and repaid as\r\nwanted by depositors from petty cash, or held by the librarian and\r\nrepaid when called up. Deposit money of this kind when paid into the\r\nbank tends somewhat to complicate and falsify the accounts by recording\r\nreceipts which do not belong to the library, and inflating the petty\r\ncash expenditures, but borough accountants regard it as orthodox\r\nbook-keeping as a rule. The practice differs in all places as regards\r\nthis point, and the librarian may keep a separate account of these\r\nmoneys, whether paid into the bank or not.\r\n\r\n18. Under the powers conferred by the 1892 Act, many public libraries\r\nnow permit persons residing outside the district who are not otherwise\r\nqualified to become borrowers on payment of an annual subscription,\r\nranging from 5s. to 10s. The money received from this source should be\r\npaid into the subscriptions account at the bank, and a proper receipt\r\ngiven to the subscriber, showing how long the subscription is current.\r\n\r\n21. The RENEWAL OF BOOKS is generally allowed without question, if no\r\ninquiries for them in the interval have been recorded. In other cases,\r\nsuch renewals must, of course, be refused, unless the books are not\r\nreturned, in which case nothing can be done. Here again the eternal\r\nfiction question arises, and there are reasonable doubts if the right of\r\nrenewal should be allowed in the case of recent popular novels. With\r\nclassic fiction and other books it is quite another matter, and students\r\nshould be allowed to renew within all reasonable limits, and by any\r\nreasonable means--post-card, telephone, message or other--providing that\r\nreaders give the necessary particulars. A form of renewal slip is used\r\nat some libraries which may be useful. Copies are taken away by any\r\nborrower who thinks he may require them, and if he desires to renew a\r\nbook, he simply fills up a slip and sends it by hand or post to the\r\nlibrary. The assistant then picks out the charge from the charging\r\nsystem, inserts the renewal slip in the pocket, and re-issues it under\r\nthe current date. The renewals may be picked out and sorted in one\r\nsequence behind a special guide, so that when a book is returned which\r\nhas not been re-dated, it is easy to find it; or a “dummy” book card may\r\nbe inserted in order under the original date of issue bearing a\r\nreference to the date of renewal--this is perhaps the more effective\r\nmethod. Renewals should count as re-issues, and a record should be made\r\nof the issue of all books which are thus renewed.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | _Book No._                     |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | _Issued_                       |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | _Renewed_                      |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | _Fine_                         |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | This Ticket should be returned |\r\n  |   when renewing the Book.      |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  |                                |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  |          LIBERTON              |\r\n  |       PUBLIC LIBRARY.          |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 132.--Renewal Slip (Section 361 (21)).\r\n\r\n23. The practice of RESERVING BOOKS has been adopted in many libraries,\r\nand within certain limits it is useful. The chief points connected with\r\nthe matter are whether all books should be reserved, and how many orders\r\nfor the same popular book should be booked at once. As regards the first\r\npoint, it is wise to exclude current popular, but not classic, fiction\r\nfrom the operation of the rule, partly for the reason that in this class\r\nduplicates of popular novels are generally stocked, and also because it\r\nis necessary to restrict as much as possible any privilege which may\r\nseem to favour one class to the exclusion of another, as there is no\r\ndoubt that the charge of 1d. will practically exclude many poor people\r\nfrom participating in this method of book-reservation. It is simple to\r\nmake a rough distinction between classic and current fiction, by adding\r\nthe classic symbol (some arbitrary sign) to the class-mark of all books\r\nwhich have been published more than ten years. Such works are not\r\nnecessarily classic, of course, but all that is contemplated is to\r\nprevent the holding-up on reservation lists of the latest works. As\r\nregards the second point, librarians will have to exercise a nice\r\ndiscretion as to how many readers they will place on the rota at one\r\ntime, as it is quite conceivable that to reserve any popular work twenty\r\nor thirty times ahead is simply to cut it off from general circulation\r\nfor an indefinite period. In the case of very popular books, the\r\npossibility of buying a special copy for reservation should be\r\ncontemplated. As regards the method of working the system of reserving\r\nbooks, the usual plan is to sell a post-card to the borrower, who\r\naddresses it to himself and enters the name of the book wanted. These\r\npost-cards are then returned to the librarian, who arranges them in\r\norder, and, as the books are stopped on return, sends out the post-card\r\nnext in order. A usual form for the post-card is as follows: “Please\r\nnote that the book ............................. reserved by you, has\r\nnow been returned, and will be kept for you till the evening of\r\n..........................” The assistant fills in the date by which the\r\nbook should be claimed. Of course, borrowers who fail to claim miss\r\ntheir turn. A separate register of these reserved books can be kept in\r\naddition to the cards, if thought advisable. A receipt should, of\r\ncourse, be given for each post-card, and in some libraries the numbers\r\nof the books reserved are written on the counterfoils.\r\n\r\n25. INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTIFICATION.--Authorities differ greatly as to\r\nthe power of books to carry and disseminate disease. American and\r\nEnglish bacteriologists, after exhaustive researches and tests, declare\r\nthat dirty books cannot convey infection, whilst German and French\r\nscientists are not so sure. The latest tests and theories are negative.\r\nInfection is conveyed in a wet state from the patient to another person,\r\nand it is affirmed that when contagious matter has dried it is\r\ninnocuous. It is, therefore, clear that the conditions under which books\r\nmay carry disease rarely, if ever, occur. As library assistants are\r\ncontinually turning over, handling and inhaling the dust, etc., from\r\nlending library books without observed ill results, it may be assumed\r\nthat the danger of infection, if it exists at all, is greatly\r\nexaggerated. But as the public mind is somewhat excited over this\r\nquestion, it is necessary for library authorities to take steps to\r\nreassure the people that everything is done to prevent disease being\r\ncommunicated through the medium of library books. The Public Health Acts\r\nare quite clear on the point that persons suffering from infectious\r\ndiseases, or in charge of other persons so suffering, are liable to\r\npenalties for lending any article; and this would cover the case of a\r\nlibrary which re-issued a book which came from an infected house. The\r\npractice should therefore be for the local sanitary authority to seize\r\nall library books found on disease-infected premises, and simply destroy\r\nthem after due notification to the library authority. A further\r\nnotification should be sent to the library when the house has been\r\ndisinfected and declared free from disease, as in the meantime the\r\nlibrarian has stopped the issue of books to persons in the\r\ndisease-stricken house from the date of the first intimation. There are\r\nvarious forms of notice used for notifying when and where disease breaks\r\nout, and what books are destroyed, and also for declaring the infected\r\nhouse free from disease. As regards the disinfection of books by means\r\nof fumes, etc., the opinion is that it cannot be properly done without\r\ndestroying the bindings, and it is best to take the extreme course in\r\nview of the public fears. As regards the cost of replacing such\r\ndestroyed books, the local sanitary authority can be called upon to do\r\nthis under the provisions of the Public Health Acts, 1901, but unless\r\nthe annual loss is very great, it seems hardly advisable to raise the\r\npoint. In small places or towns with very limited book funds, the\r\nsanitary authority should certainly be asked to replace all books which\r\nare destroyed. It is a wise plan to keep a separate record of books\r\nwhich are destroyed in the interest of the public health. This need not\r\nnote any further particulars than the dates, titles and numbers of\r\nbooks, and cost. A column can be reserved for remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n=362.

General.=--By a tradition now firmly implanted in the mind of the\r\npublic, and nourished by journalists, the lending department is the most\r\nprominent feature of the public library. The average public criticism,\r\nfavourable or otherwise, is almost invariably based upon lending library\r\nstatistics. This is probably because the average person knows the\r\nlibrary as a place from which he may “take out” books. In a treatise for\r\nlibrarians the inadequacy of this view need not be stressed, although,\r\nas in many matters connected with their calling, librarians are not\r\nunanimous as to the relative value of their departments, some exalting\r\none or other at the expense of the rest. There are, however, clear\r\nprinciples which have a fairly general acceptation. The main one is that\r\nin libraries which are in fairly close proximity to much greater\r\nlibraries, it is wise to place more emphasis on the lending than on the\r\nreference department. It would be an unjustifiable duplicating of\r\nexpense for a library, for example, within a mile or two of the British\r\nMuseum, to attempt the hopeless task of rivalling it in the provision of\r\nexpensive reference works; while on the other hand it would be justified\r\nabundantly in providing the finest possible lending library. Even here\r\ndogmatism is to be avoided, because the habits of populations in what\r\nappear to be exactly similar localities may differ greatly. Where, for\r\nexample, a city working population living in a large suburb returns\r\nrarely or not at all to the city in the evenings, there may be a real\r\ndemand for a reference library. Only experience, which bears in mind\r\nthe general principles stated, can resolve which policy it is best to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nOn account of its prominence and the numerous opportunities for good\r\nwork it affords, the lending library deserves the utmost care in its\r\nplanning and administration, and the simplest and freest methods\r\ncompatible with reasonable care for the safety of the books are the\r\nbest. All the considerations we have described as to book-selection and\r\nweeding-out, etc., apply with particular force in this department; and a\r\ncareful study should be made of the various methods of issue described\r\nin the next chapter before one is chosen, as a wrong choice may inflict\r\nmuch hardship on readers and later involve changes which will be most\r\nexpensive; in fact, the converting of a lending library from one system\r\nto another is probably the most costly operation in which it can be\r\ninvolved. The staffing of the department requires just as much\r\nconsideration as that of any other, and the all too frequent and often\r\nunavoidable practice of employing the youngest boys and girls at the\r\ncharging counters or desks is much to be deprecated even when it cannot\r\nbe altogether avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n=367. Voucher Forms.=--There are all kinds of voucher forms in use in\r\nthe municipal libraries of the United Kingdom, ranging in size from\r\nfoolscap folio to post-card. These vouchers are the forms on which\r\nborrowers apply for tickets entitling them to use the library, and they\r\nare the basis of the necessary registration of borrowers which all\r\nlibraries must perform. It is not needful to describe more than one\r\nform, because it is gradually being adopted, with variations to suit\r\ndifferent localities, as the standard system of the country. The legal\r\nquestions connected with the validity of certain forms of guarantee are\r\nalso beyond the scope of this section, because judicial rulings have\r\nbeen obtained on all kinds of forms, and the only point requiring\r\nconsideration, that of the amount of the guarantor’s liability, has\r\nalready been discussed.\r\n\r\nA form of voucher which can be used as a movable card (5 in. by 3 in.)\r\nis preferable to a large slip, which requires binding in volumes, or\r\nother special means of preservation; and the style of cards given in\r\nFigs. 133-136 will be found satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThese voucher cards should be printed on a stout material, which may be\r\nof a different colour for each type of reader--burgess, non-burgess,\r\nstudent, etc.--and handed free to any person entitled to borrow books.\r\nWhen returned filled up, they are duly examined to ascertain if the\r\napplicant is duly qualified, and when this is done the card is filed,\r\nafter it has been numbered from the number book, and the borrower’s card\r\nmade out. The space in the top left-hand corner is to hold the\r\nborrower’s name, boldly written in as a catch-word for alphabetical\r\narrangement. The No. . . . space at the top right-hand corner is for the\r\nborrower’s progressive number. The Date. . . space at the bottom\r\nleft-hand corner is the date of application, which also becomes the date\r\nof expiry two years later. The Elector’s Roll. . . space at the bottom\r\nright-hand corner is for the number on the current electors’ roll. It is\r\na useful thing to mark this roll with the numbers of the cards of any\r\nborrowers for whom a ratepayer may be guarantor, in all cases where a\r\nlimit is put to the number whom one person may guarantee. There is\r\ngenerally plenty of marginal space for this purpose.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |

Non-Ratepayer Applicant (Section 368).\r\n\r\nIn some libraries the guarantee form has been entirely abandoned in\r\nfavour of a recommendation which carries with it no explicit liability\r\nfor losses.\r\n\r\nThe vouchers for non-ratepayer applicants should be dealt with in the\r\nsame way as those for ratepayers, viz., checked with registers and filed\r\nin the alphabetical order of surnames, after tickets have been made out\r\nand an entry made in the number book.\r\n\r\n\r\n=369.= It will be seen that the vouchers illustrated permit any borrower\r\nwho desires it to acquire a non-fiction or duplicate ticket in addition\r\nto a general ticket. The more general practice has been to require a\r\nseparate voucher to be filled up (and guaranteed in the case of\r\nnon-burgesses) for every such ticket. In this case the voucher requires\r\nno separate wording, but the word “Duplicate” or “Non-Fiction” stamped\r\nboldly across the ordinary voucher is sufficient to indicate the\r\ndifference. But there seems no special advantage in making the applicant\r\ngo through this double process. The same holds good with regard to\r\nvouchers for those who make a deposit in lieu of obtaining a written\r\nguarantee, or who subscribe in terms of Rule 18.

Tickets.=--Various forms of borrowers’ tickets are used with\r\nindicators and card charging, but only the kinds most commonly used need\r\nbe described. One form is shown below (Fig. 137) for libraries in which\r\nborrowers retain their tickets when they have no books on loan. They are\r\nmade with cloth backs to fold across, and the one with the clipped\r\ncorner is a good form to adopt for students’ or extra tickets available\r\nfor non-fictional works only. The variety shown is not ruled to hold a\r\nrecord of the numbers of books which are borrowed upon it, as it does\r\nnot seem necessary to keep such a record. To keep it involves a great\r\ndeal of work, and the information it affords, being practically confined\r\nto what type of book an individual reads, is rarely wanted. As a check\r\non lost books it may have some value, but that has no relation to the\r\ncost of keeping it.\r\n\r\nThis ticket can be used with any kind of issue method, and it is\r\ntherefore noted here and not with other cards among the charging\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n         +-----------------------+\r\n         |           1           |\r\n         +-----------------------+\r\n         | H.

W. MacAlister at the Library Association Conference at Aberdeen. In\r\nAmerica this is generally known as the “Two-Book System,” and it became\r\nvery widely adopted after 1894. Indeed, American libraries are most\r\ngenerous in their lending; many libraries lend as many as ten books at a\r\ntime; and one or two have recently (1919) invited borrowers to take at\r\nany one time “as many as they like.” The advantage of this\r\nindiscriminate freedom is not quite obvious, and, owing to their more\r\nlimited stocks, it would be impossible in most British libraries. There\r\nare decided advantages in the plan of allowing borrowers to have two\r\nbooks at a time, and there is no doubt it greatly enhances the value of\r\nthe public library to many people. As indicated by Rule 19, Section 360,\r\nspecial privileges are recommended to be extended to school teachers,\r\nwho ought to be allowed any number of books, within reason, required for\r\ntheir special and important work of education. There is no objection to\r\nallowing special privileges to all earnest students engaged on special\r\nlines of research, provided no injustice is done to the general work of\r\nthe library or to students similarly engaged. Certainly it is better to\r\nlend a real student half a dozen or more books at a time than to have\r\nthese books lying idle at the library. Of course, in libraries with more\r\nreaders than books, if there are any, extra tickets will require to be\r\nissued with caution, but in all large libraries the privilege can be\r\nextended without fear or hesitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=372. Registration.=--All borrowers’ tickets should be numbered in a\r\nprogressive series, and the same number should be given to the same\r\nborrower as long as he or she remains connected with the library. This\r\nprevents overlapping and the clumsy method of numbering continuously up\r\nto a certain limit and counting off the early numbers; a doubtful way of\r\nascertaining the total number of actual borrowers at any given time. The\r\nruling of a number register in book form is shown in Fig. 138.\r\n\r\n  +---++------------+------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |No.||    1901.   |    1902.   |1903.|1904.|1905.|1906.|1907.|\r\n  +---++------------+------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | 1 ||H.

The column\r\nis chosen which represents the year in which his ticket expires, and\r\nagainst the number is written the borrower’s name, and under it the\r\nmonth and day when the ticket expires. The holder of a given ticket can\r\nbe ascertained very rapidly by this method, and time-expired or dead\r\nticket-holders can be counted off without trouble. But it is necessary\r\nto mark or qualify the entries in order to do this. An easy way to\r\nindicate an expired ticket is to mark the register with a blue tick (✓)\r\nas shown in Fig. 138 (No. 2). These expired numbers should be given to\r\nnew borrowers, so as to keep the register filled up and complete, and at\r\nthe end of a given period, when it is time to ascertain the number of\r\n“live” or actual ticket-holders, it is only necessary to count the blue\r\nticks, and deduct their total from the last number of the series, in\r\norder to obtain the exact number of current borrowers. A number register\r\nbook ruled as shown in Fig. 138 will last for many years. It is not\r\nnecessary to print the progressive numbers or years, and it will\r\nfacilitate counting operations if fifty numbers are allowed for every\r\npage. Duplicate or special ticket-holders numbered in a separate series\r\nshould be entered in a special book, and juvenile ticket-holders can be\r\ntreated in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=373.= To prevent the possibility of a number of tickets being obtained\r\nby the same individuals, all tickets should be registered and made out\r\nat one library of a town, but, of course, issued from the library at\r\nwhich the application was made, and such tickets should be made\r\ninterchangeable. There does not seem to be any advantage attached to\r\nseparate branch registration, and certainly there is much loss of good\r\nservice when residents are confined to the use of a particular branch.\r\nThe residents in a town are entitled to use any of the libraries, and a\r\ncentral registration of borrowers is therefore essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n=374.= When the borrowers’ vouchers have been duly checked, numbered,\r\nand the tickets have been written out, they should be filed in\r\nalphabetical order of the borrowers’ surnames in properly guided trays\r\n(or, better, card cabinets), supplied with all necessary angle blocks,\r\netc., as in the case of charging and card-catalogue trays and cabinets.\r\nThese form the alphabetical index to the borrowers, while the borrowers’\r\nnumber register supplies the numerical side. Thus any question regarding\r\nborrowers can be answered without delay. It is not necessary to keep an\r\nalphabetical index of guarantors if the electors’ roll is marked as\r\npreviously suggested.\r\n\r\n\r\n=375.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Dana, J. C. (_Ed._).

It\r\nwill, therefore, be needless to describe charging systems so generally\r\ndiscarded, and it will suffice if reference is made to the first edition\r\nof this work, in which many forms were illustrated and explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=377.= The great objection to all charging ledgers in book form was\r\ntheir want of movability and adjustability. The entries when once made\r\nwere fixed, either in a running sequence under a date of issue, a\r\nborrower’s name, or a book’s title. If, for any purpose, it should be\r\ndesirable to manipulate the entries, in order to secure greater\r\naccuracy, or some definite record of a special kind, the book ledgers\r\ndid not lend themselves to this sort of treatment. There was no kind of\r\nmovability possible, and questions which might be answered readily\r\nenough if entries were movable and separate, could not be put to any\r\nissue record in volume form. Chiefly because of this, the slip or card\r\nmethods of charging were introduced, which enable registration to be\r\nconducted in a variety of ways for different purposes. It is impossible\r\nto say when or where cards were first introduced, but as they have been\r\nused for commercial purposes for years before the public library system\r\nwas established, it follows that many minds must have discovered the\r\nutility and convenience of movable entries. There are many varieties of\r\ncard or slip charging in existence, and innumerable methods of working\r\nor applying them. Movable entry systems are in every respect the most\r\ninteresting, not only because they present greater possibilities to the\r\ningenious mind, but because they are more scientific and more natural.\r\n\r\n\r\n=378.= There have been numerous systems devised for recording issues of\r\nbooks from public libraries, but in none have so many variations been\r\nintroduced as in the great group using cards as a basis. There is hardly\r\nany limit to be put to the variety of ways in which cards can be used;\r\nand, without describing every system in detail, it will nevertheless be\r\ninteresting to select and describe typical plans from among the more\r\npractical varieties, as representative of each particular group. The\r\nfundamental idea of all card systems of charging is that each book or\r\nvolume shall be represented by a movable card, which can be stored in\r\nvarious ways when the book is on the shelf, and used to register or\r\ncharge the book, when issued, to its borrower.\r\n\r\n\r\n=379.= When cards are used as movable entries, there is no need to keep\r\na column for showing date of return; and, before describing a method of\r\nworking, the following specimen ruling for a card is given:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+\r\n  | =F 9432=                           |\r\n  |                HOPE                |\r\n  |                                    |\r\n  |         Prisoner of Zenda          |\r\n  +========+=========+========+========+\r\n  |  8276  | Jul. 19 |  2641  | Nov. 6 |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n  |        |         |        |        |\r\n\r\nFIG. 139.--Book Issue-Card (Section 379).\r\n\r\nThe first and third columns may be used for the borrowers’ numbers, and\r\nthe second and fourth for dates of issue, as shown above, or all four\r\ncolumns may be used for borrowers’ numbers. The backs of the cards may\r\nbe ruled the same, without the heading. These cards are kept in a strict\r\nnumerical order of progressive numbers in trays or drawers. When a book\r\nis chosen by a borrower, the card representing it is withdrawn from its\r\nplace, the borrower’s number and date of issue entered, the date of\r\nissue stamped on the date label of the book, and the transaction is\r\ncomplete when the book-card is placed in a tray, or behind a special\r\nblock bearing the date of issue. At the end of the day the cards are\r\nall sorted up in numerical order, as far as possible, the statistics\r\nmade up from them, and they are then put away in the dated issue trays,\r\nor behind date blocks in drawers. When a book is returned, its date and\r\nnumber direct the assistant to the exact number of the book-card, which\r\nis withdrawn, and at leisure replaced in the main sequence. No other\r\nmarking off is necessary, and the book is immediately available for\r\nissue. Overdues gradually declare themselves, as day after day passes,\r\nand the cards for books in circulation diminish in number as returns are\r\nmade. This is card charging of a simple kind, which is rarely used\r\nnowadays, as in cases of overdues, queries, etc., it necessitates\r\nreference to the borrowers’ register, and such references are always a\r\nnuisance; but it forms the basis of all the more elaborate scientific\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n=380.= The pocket system of card-charging is that most used in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, not only as a separate method, but also frequently in\r\nconnexion with, or as an adjunct to, indicators. This is a loose pocket\r\nsystem in which each book is represented by a manila card (about 4 × 2\r\ninches) ruled on both sides to take borrowers’ numbers and dates of\r\nissues. Every borrower is represented by a card of a similar kind, but\r\none inch shorter (see Fig. 140). When a book is issued its card is taken\r\nfrom the tray, and, with the borrower’s card, is placed in a loose\r\nmanila pocket, the date of issue is stamped on the date label inside the\r\nbook and the borrower receives the volume. It is customary in most open\r\naccess libraries to hand the borrower his card when his book is\r\ndischarged. If he does not want another book at the moment he retains\r\nhis card for the future, but if he does want another he selects one in\r\nthe usual way, and hands it and his ticket to the assistant at the exit\r\ncharging wicket, where the charge is made very rapidly by simply\r\nselecting the book-card and “marrying” it with the borrower’s card in a\r\nloose pocket. In some libraries the charges thus made are simply sorted\r\nby book numbers and arranged behind projecting date guides in the issue\r\ntrays. In others this is postponed till the book numbers have been\r\ncarried on to the book-cards. Whatever method of registration is adopted\r\nthe ultimate result is that a complete charge is got by mechanical\r\nmeans, which obviates the need for writing at the moment of issue. The\r\nplan of keeping the book-cards in pockets inside the books has been\r\nadopted in some libraries, but of course this destroys the value of the\r\nsystem as an indicator to the staff of books in and out. At the same\r\ntime, in open access libraries particularly, it facilitates service at\r\nthe moment of issue. The conjoined cards of this loose pocket system\r\nappear as in the diagrams on page 355 (Figs. 142-3).\r\n\r\n\r\n=381.= The following diagrams show one of the principal systems of card\r\ncharging now used in British libraries. Each book has a small triangular\r\npocket inside the front board, in which is placed a small book-card (2 ×\r\n1⅛ inches) of manila, on which is written the class number, author and\r\ntitle of the book it represents. In cases of duplicate copies it is\r\nadvisable to write the accession number on the book-card to facilitate\r\nstocktaking. Each book also has a date label inside the front board\r\nfacing the book pocket (Fig. 141).\r\n\r\n            +---------------------------+\r\n            |  4622               A 32  | } Book-card\r\n            |          BALFOUR          | } projection.\r\n            +---------------------------+\r\n            |  5916      30 Mar., 1908  | }\r\n            |      RICHARD GARNETT,     | }\r\n            |      1 Museum Street.     | }\r\n            +---------------+           | }\r\n          { |                \\---+------+ }\r\n          { |                 \\  |      | } Borrower’s\r\n          { |                  \\ |      | } card\r\n          { |                   \\+------+ } projection.\r\n          { |                    \\      | }\r\n          { |                     \\     | }\r\n          { |                      \\----+ }\r\n          { |                       \\   | }\r\n  Pocket. { |                        \\  | }\r\n          { |                         \\ | }\r\n          { |                          \\|\r\n          { |                           | }\r\n          { |                           | }\r\n          { |                           | } Pocket.\r\n          { |                           | }\r\n          { |                           | }\r\n          { |                           | }\r\n            +---------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 140.--Book and Borrower’s Cards combined in Pocket (Section 380).\r\n\r\nEach borrower has a neat linen-covered or other card bearing the name of\r\nthe library, the name, address and number of the borrower and the date\r\nwhen the card was issued, or better, when it will expire, if periodical\r\nrenewals are demanded.

Charging Appliances.=--An important part of a card method is the\r\ntray for holding and displaying the cards, and of this there are a\r\nnumber of kinds in use in libraries using indicators and in those\r\nworking without them. For many reasons, but above all for economy of\r\nspace, it is best to use a comparatively small-sized charging card, the\r\nadvantage being that all the accessories, such as trays, guides, etc.,\r\nare correspondingly small, cheap and easily handled.\r\n\r\n  <---------- 1¼″ ----------->\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |                          | ^\r\n  |          Watson          | |\r\n  |          (John)          | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |   30 Thornhill Square.   | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |           5963           | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |    30th Sept., 1906.     | 3″\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  +--------------------------+ |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |         BOOKTON          | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |          PUBLIC          | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  |        LIBRARIES.        | |\r\n  |                          | |\r\n  +--------------------------+ V\r\n\r\nFIG. 142.--Borrower’s Card with Pocket.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n  |                          |\r\n  |          Watson          |<--{ Borrower’s\r\n  |          (John)          |   {   Card.\r\n  |                          |\r\n  |   +------------------+   |\r\n  |   |      E 100·3     |---|<--{Book-\r\n  |   |                  |   |   {Card.\r\n  |   |      Balfour     |   |\r\n  |   |                  |   |\r\n  +---+------------------+---+\r\n  |                          |\r\n  |         BOOKTON          |\r\n  |                          |\r\n  |          PUBLIC          |\r\n  |                          |\r\n  |        LIBRARIES.        |\r\n  |                          |\r\n  +--------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 143.--Borrower’s Card and Book-card conjoined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=383.= A standard size of card tray made of wood is shown in Fig. 144.\r\n\r\nThis tray (_b_) is provided with a rod (_a_) for securing the guides\r\n(_e_) in a continuous slot (_c_) at the bottom, to carry and secure the\r\nslot-fastening (_f_) of the guides (_e_). It has cut-away sides to\r\nfacilitate the handling of the cards; a back slide or block (_d_) to\r\nretain the cards at any convenient or required angle; angle-bars and\r\ncatch-pieces of brass (_g_ and _h_) to secure a series of trays firmly\r\nin place, and prevent upsetting or knocking about. For every kind of\r\ncard charging, whether in connexion with an indicator or without, this\r\nstyle of single tray, capable of indefinite expansion, is preferable to\r\ndrawers or frames divided into compartments. Each tray will hold with\r\nits guides approximately 1000 cards, and, when divided up into hundreds,\r\nany number can be found quite rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Elevation and Plan of Card-charging Tray\r\n(Section 383).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=384.= The guides are generally made of steel, enamelled and figured, or\r\nfrom vulcanized fibre, xylonite or aluminium, bearing the numbers\r\nstamped upon them. Every charging system of this kind should have a set\r\nof nine guides for each thousand numbers, numbered simply 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, 7, 8, 9, or having the hundreds running progressively throughout,\r\n100, 200, 300, 400, etc. There should also be at least two complete sets\r\nof date guides, numbered from 1 to 31 inclusive, a set of alphabetical\r\nguides (for unclaimed borrowers’ cards) from A to Z, and the\r\nmiscellaneous guides for fines, marked 1d., 2d., 3d., 6d., etc.,\r\n“Overdues,” “Renewals,” “Guarantors Notified,” etc. All these are\r\nnecessary for working card-charging as described in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=385.= It is advisable to provide a card-sorting tray, which may be a\r\nsimple rack divided into narrow compartments representing thousands. The\r\ncompartments need not be more than an inch wide, as the cards can lie\r\njust as easily on their edges as flat, and with greater economy of\r\nspace. Where fiction is kept in a separate series of trays, or the\r\nbook-issue cards are classed, then, of course, some modifications will\r\nbe required both in book-issue and sorting trays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--Card-charging Trays in use (Section 378).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=386.= The indicator, as a library tool, is almost entirely an English\r\nappliance, and it is somewhat curious, considering their love for, and\r\nextensive use of, mechanical contrivances, that American librarians have\r\nnever taken kindly to it. Various abortive experiments have been tried\r\nat Boston and elsewhere with indicating devices of several patterns, but\r\nthe almost universal opinion of American librarians is against\r\nindicators in any shape or form. This holds good as regards colonial and\r\nforeign libraries generally, though one or two Canadian and Australasian\r\nlibraries have adopted indicators of an English design. In England, on\r\nthe contrary, the invention of these appliances has gone on\r\nunremittingly for sixty years, and there are about twenty different\r\nvarieties, each possessing its own merit or ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=387.= An indicator is a device for indicating or registering\r\ninformation about books, in such a way that it can be seen either by the\r\nstaff alone, or by the public and staff both. The information usually\r\nconveyed to the public is some kind of indication of the presence or\r\nabsence of books, and the methods of accomplishing this almost\r\ninvariably take the form of displayed numbers, qualified in such a way\r\nas to indicate books _in_ and _out_. Thus, small spaces on a screen may\r\nbe numbered to represent books, and their presence in the library\r\nindicated by the space being blank, or their absence from the library\r\nshown by the space being occupied by a card or block. Or, colours may be\r\nused to indicate books in and out, or a change in the position of the\r\nblock representing a book. No doubt the idea of the mechanical indicator\r\nwas early evolved from the needs of the first public libraries. The\r\nfirst practical application of it was in 1863, when Mr Charles Dyall,\r\nthen Librarian at the Hulme Branch of the Manchester Public Libraries,\r\nhad one made for actual use by the public and the staff. This seems to\r\nbe the very earliest English indicator, and Mr Dyall is entitled to full\r\ncredit as the pioneer inventor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=388.= The ELLIOT INDICATOR, 1870, is very fully described in a pamphlet\r\nentitled “A Practical Explanation of the Safe and Rapid Method of\r\nIssuing Library Books, by J. Elliot, inventor of the system.\r\nWolverhampton, 1870.” This pamphlet gives diagrams and descriptions of\r\nthe Elliot Indicator in substantially the same form in which it exists\r\nat the present day. The numbers are alongside the ticket shelves or\r\nspaces, and a specially thick borrower’s ticket is used with coloured\r\nends to show books out and overdue. The indicator is a large frame,\r\ndivided into columns by wide uprights carrying 100 numbers each, which\r\ncorrespond with the little shelves, formed of tin, dividing each column.\r\n\r\nThere are 100 shelves and numbers in every column, and the indicator is\r\nmade in several sizes, according to the width of the borrower’s card\r\nused. The public side is covered with glass. The method of working is\r\nsimple. The borrower scans the indicator till he finds the space\r\nopposite the number he wants vacant. This indicates that the book he\r\nwants is in, and he then hands his ticket to the assistant, stating the\r\nnumber of the book he requires. The assistant enters the book number and\r\ndate of issue in the borrower’s card, and inserts it in the indicator in\r\nthe space against the number. The book is then fetched, and before issue\r\nit is registered on a specially ruled day-sheet, by means of a stroke,\r\nto record the day’s circulation for statistical purposes. When the book\r\nis returned its number directs to the space on the indicator occupied by\r\nthe borrower’s card, which is withdrawn and returned to the owner, when\r\nall liability for fines is cleared. Overdues are detected by means of\r\ndifferently coloured ends to the borrowers’ cards, or the periodical\r\nexamination of the indicator. This indicator, which occupies a very\r\nlarge amount of counter-space, has been, or is, in use at Wolverhampton,\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne and Paisley.\r\n\r\n  +-----+----------------------------+  { Space\r\n  | 491 |                            |<-{  for\r\n  |     +----------------------------+  { Ticket.\r\n  | 492 |                            |\r\n  |     +----------------------------+  { Ticket in\r\n  | 493 | ########################## |<-{  space,\r\n  |     +----------------------------+  { indicating\r\n  | 494 |                            |  { book out.\r\n  |     +----------------------------+\r\n  | 495 |                            |\r\n  |     +----------------------------+\r\n  | 496 |                            |\r\n  |     +----------------------------+\r\n  |     |                            |\r\n  +-----+----------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 146.--Diagram of Elliot Indicator (Section 388).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--A Library Indicator, as seen from the side of\r\nthe public.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=389.= COTGREAVE INDICATOR, 1877.--This indicator is that which has been\r\nmost used in this country, and was the invention of Alfred Cotgreave,\r\nthen Librarian of the Wednesbury Public Library, in 1877. An account of\r\nits structure and working from one of the descriptive circulars issued\r\nin connexion with it will enable anyone to gather a good idea of its\r\nappearance and use:\r\n\r\n“It consists of a wooden or iron frame, fitted with minute zinc shelves,\r\ngenerally 100 in a column. Upon each of these shelves is placed a small\r\nmetal-bound ledger (3 inches × 1 inch), containing a number of leaves,\r\nruled and headed for the number of borrower’s ticket, and date of issue,\r\nalso date of return or other items as may be required, numbered or\r\nlettered at each end, and arranged numerically in the frames. One part\r\nof it is also lettered for entries of date of purchase, title of book,\r\netc. The metal case has turned-up ends, and the numbers appear on a\r\nground coloured red at one end and blue at the other, one colour showing\r\nbooks _out_, the other books _in_; other colours may be used if\r\npreferred. The _out_ numbers can be covered altogether with a date slide\r\nif required. The change of colour is effected by simply reversing the\r\nledger in the indicator frame. The public side of the indicator is\r\nprotected by glass.\r\n\r\n“The _modus operandi_ is as follows: A borrower having chosen a book\r\nfrom the catalogue, consults the indicator, and finding the required\r\nnumber to be on _blue_, denoting _in_, asks for the book corresponding,\r\nat the same time tendering his library ticket. The assistant withdraws\r\nthe indicator ledger, makes the necessary entries, inserts borrower’s\r\nticket, and reverses the ledger, which then shows the _red_ colour,\r\nsignifying _out_. He then hands out the book asked for. The borrower’s\r\nticket will remain in this number until he changes his book, when his\r\nticket will, of course, be transferred to the next number required, and\r\nthe returned number will be reversed again, showing by the _blue_ colour\r\nthat the book it represents is again _in_, and is immediately available\r\nto any other reader requiring it. The entries need not be made at the\r\ntime of issue, but may stand over until a more convenient time.\r\n\r\n“When a book is not required the ticket is returned to the borrower, and\r\nacts as a receipt, exonerating him from liabilities.”\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of working this indicator in order to obtain certain\r\nrecords or notifications of overdues, and nearly every library has some\r\nmodification of its own.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to trace the history of the indicator in any further\r\ndetail, because, with one exception, the forms described comprise all\r\nthat have been introduced to any extent in English public libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=390.= Another indicator which has been introduced to some extent was\r\ninvented in 1894, and has several features which may be described here.\r\n\r\nIt consists of a series of wooden blocks, each of which is numbered with\r\n250 numbers in gilt figures, and each number has a slot under it large\r\nenough to hold a book-card with red coloured or white ends, bearing the\r\nsame number as the slot. These blocks can be built into columns of 1000\r\nwith the numbers running consecutively, the whole being lodged in a\r\nglazed frame. This indicator differs from other varieties in having the\r\nnumbers qualified by the red or white line of the card under the numbers\r\nto indicate books _in_; when the slot is blank, the book is _out_. “The\r\nwithdrawal of the book-card is the method of indicating books out, and\r\nit is the union of this card with the borrower’s card which forms the\r\nbasis of the subsequent registration. When a book is issued the\r\nassistant withdraws the card from the recorder and places it in the\r\nreader’s ticket, which is formed like a pocket, fetches the book, stamps\r\nit with the date of issue, and so completes the transaction at the\r\nmoment of service. Afterwards, the readers’ pocket tickets containing\r\nthe book-cards are assembled and arranged according to classes in\r\nnumerical order. They are then posted, by book and reader numbers only,\r\non to a daily issue sheet or register, and the date of issue is stamped\r\non each book-card, if this has not already been done at the moment of\r\nservice. The conjoined book- and reader-cards are then placed in a tray\r\nbearing the date of issue, in the order of classes and book numbers, or\r\nin one series of book numbers as may be needful.” In other respects this\r\ncharging system resembles the card methods described in Section 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n=391.= The only other indicator which is designed on an entirely\r\ndifferent principle from any of the foregoing is the Adjustable\r\nIndicator proposed by the author in a paper read before the Library\r\nAssociation in 1895, and published in _The Library_ for 1896, with\r\nillustrations. This was a practical proposal for an adjustable indicator\r\nin which its size should be limited by the number of books in actual\r\n_circulation_, and not by the number in _stock_. There is a very\r\nimportant point here, as a library with a stock of 30,000 volumes would\r\nrequire an indicator occupying about thirty-eight feet run of counter\r\nspace. If it never had more than 4000 volumes out at one time, these\r\ncould be shown on the limited indicator above named within a space of\r\nnot more than six or eight feet. This is a most important question, and\r\nit is inevitable that, in many libraries where conditions and feeling\r\nare opposed to progressive changes, this continual growth of indicator\r\nspace will force library authorities into the serious consideration of\r\nless crowded methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=392.= On the principle of limiting the indicator to one particular\r\nclass of literature, several varieties have been introduced at Brighton,\r\nWimbledon, Glasgow and Lewisham. So many libraries now use indicators\r\nfor Fiction only that there is some advantage in having special\r\nappliances for the purpose. The Glasgow indicator consists of a series\r\nof detached columns with adjustable number-blocks representing the\r\nbooks, arranged so that insertions can be made at any point. The\r\nLewisham or Graham indicator is an alphabetical one, and consists of an\r\nordinary pigeon-holed frame, into which fit small numbered blocks of\r\nwood or metal bearing the names of authors and similar blocks with the\r\nnumbers of their works. The chief advantage of this form is that it is\r\nself-contained, and requires no key to enable borrowers to ascertain\r\nwhat are the titles of books indicated _in_. A simple reference to the\r\nauthor’s name in the ordinary catalogue enables this to be done. An\r\nindicator on similar lines has been invented by Cotgreave, who applied\r\nthe idea to a magazine indicator.\r\n\r\n         +---+----------------+\r\n  Out .. | ● |     ARGOSY.    |\r\n         |---+----------------+\r\n  In ... | ○ |  ART JOURNAL.  |\r\n         +---+----------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 148.--Diagram of Periodicals Indicator (Section 393).\r\n\r\n\r\n=393.= Indicators are occasionally used for recording and indicating the\r\nissue of the parts of periodicals, both in lending libraries and\r\nreading-rooms. The reading-room indicator simply shows what periodicals\r\nare in use or available, in cases where they are kept behind a barrier\r\ninstead of being spread over tables or racks. There are examples of this\r\nindicator at the Public Libraries of St Saviour’s, Southwark, and\r\nFinsbury. The principle is simple. The titles of magazines are mounted\r\nupon narrow blocks of wood, arranged loosely in columns so as to be\r\nadjustable, within a glazed frame. The back of this frame is open to the\r\nstaff only. Against the end of each title a hole is drilled to take a\r\nround peg which is coloured black at one end and white at the other. The\r\nwhite ends are shown when a magazine is _in_, and when it is issued the\r\npeg is reversed to show the black end. This indicates _out_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=394.= As a substitute for indicators, and an approach to open access,\r\nmany libraries provide a show-case for new books on the lending library\r\ncounter, to enable readers to see the additions as they are made. In\r\nsome libraries these show-cases are not glazed on the public side, so\r\nthat the readers have the additional privilege of examining the new\r\nbooks as well as merely seeing them. Certain libraries, like Birkenhead\r\nand St George’s-in-the East, Stepney, have whole departments of books\r\narranged behind wire or glass within seeing distance of the readers, and\r\nthey have the option of choice by bindings and titles, which, if not\r\nmuch better, is as good as choosing from catalogue entries, and at any\r\nrate gives the semblance of freedom and closer touch with the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=395.= At one time a considerable controversy, often conducted with\r\nsurprising feeling, raged in England over the respective merits of\r\nindicator and open access methods. This continued from about 1894, when\r\nJames Duff Brown inaugurated the safe-guarded open shelf plus\r\ncard-charging method at Clerkenwell (now Finsbury Central) Library. His\r\nliberalizing action necessarily threatened the property of those who\r\nowned indicator patents--some of them librarians unfortunately--and an\r\nastonishing number of objections to each method were then discovered by\r\nthe advocates of either (some of them honest). The younger librarians\r\nwill have none of this controversy. It is a purely impersonal question\r\nas to which is the better system, and the gradual extension of the open\r\naccess system seems to have settled the matter in its favour. It is\r\nclear that with advancing education the public will question the right\r\nof the libraries to erect barriers, however ingenious and practical,\r\nbetween the books and their readers. All that it seems necessary to say\r\nhere is that librarians should be able to examine both systems in actual\r\nworking, study the results obtained, and form their own conclusions\r\nwithout having their integrity or morality challenged because of their\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=396.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Brown, J.

Branch Libraries.=--Branch libraries are included in this\r\ndivision, because as a general rule they are principally lending\r\nlibraries with a reading-room attached, and rarely possess reference\r\ndepartments. Every large town extending over a wide area must sooner or\r\nlater face the question of establishing branch libraries, not only as a\r\nconvenience to the public, but as a relief to the central library. No\r\nrule can be laid down as to the distance which any reader should be from\r\nthe nearest branch or other library. It is one thing to make a\r\nsymmetrical plan on paper, showing a central library with a ring of\r\nbranches situated at regular distances, and so placed as to bring every\r\nreader within one, half or quarter of a mile of the nearest library, but\r\nit is quite a different matter realizing this ideal. Topographical\r\ndifficulties arise; the matter of density of population must be\r\nconsidered; and, to crown all, sites or suitable premises cannot always\r\nbe obtained at, or near, the places selected, as the ideal spots. For\r\nthese reasons regular spacing can rarely be achieved in the provision of\r\nbranch libraries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.--Quick-reference Collection, Glasgow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=398.= A branch library differs from a delivery station in being, to\r\nsome extent, a miniature central library, carrying its own stock of\r\nbooks, and having its own reading-room accommodation and magazines. A\r\ndelivery station need not necessarily have a stock of books, beyond\r\nthose sent in response to applications, and it would have no\r\nreading-room whatsoever. Branches and deliveries are often confused, no\r\ndoubt because both provide for book distribution, but beyond this common\r\nfeature all resemblance ceases. The question of the amount and kind of\r\naccommodation which it is desirable to provide depends entirely upon\r\nfunds, conditions and requirements. For most situations in which\r\nbranches are necessary, such as the suburbs of large towns, the minimum\r\nprovision should include a lending department, and general reading-room\r\nfor periodicals. Very occasionally a reference department is provided,\r\nbut few systems will bear the cost of providing more than one such\r\ndepartment, and that at the central library; but every branch should\r\nhave a collection of quick-reference books which answer everyday\r\nquestions and afford such information as is needed in every library.\r\nSuch a collection does not necessarily require a separate room, because\r\nthat requires special oversight, but it is better to place it in a\r\nconvenient recess of the reading-room or vestibule, where it is under\r\nthe observation of the staff, and where it is not necessary for the\r\nreader to pass through the wickets or other barriers of the lending\r\ndepartment in order to make use of it. All kinds of extra features can\r\nbe added to these provisions, if necessary, but these will depend upon\r\nfunds; but a lecture room is especially valuable in a branch, as it is\r\nusually in an area ill-provided with such accommodation and one in which\r\nlectures, exhibitions, etc., can be given most profitably. Modern\r\nexperience also advocates children’s departments at branches, as the\r\nsuburbs are the nursery districts of most towns, and therefore the most\r\nfruitful opportunities for work with children are afforded in them. Some\r\nof the branches at Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Croydon,\r\nCoventry, Edinburgh, Bristol, Islington, Lambeth, Sunderland and Fulham\r\nare models of what such establishments should be.\r\n\r\n\r\n=399.= It is impossible to lay down any rules for guidance as regards\r\nthe financing of branches, beyond the general recommendation that they\r\nshould never be developed at the expense of the central library. It is\r\nbetter to have one efficient library in a town than several inefficient\r\nones, as is the case in some towns where this wholesome principle has\r\nbeen forgotten or ignored. Librarians are justified in taking a strong\r\nstand upon this point against the unreasonable demands of ward committee\r\nrepresentatives, who are sometimes bent upon getting everything they can\r\nfor their own particular district irrespective of the claims of the\r\nsystem as a whole. Separate account should be kept of all moneys\r\nexpended upon each branch. Receipts should also be separately accounted\r\nfor, and the central library should receive a daily or weekly statement\r\nof all cash intromissions, issues, occurrences, etc. Such statements can\r\neither be rendered upon specially ruled sheets or post-cards, or kept in\r\nbooks according to some such form as shown in Fig. 150. All forms,\r\nbooks, etc., at the branch should correspond with those of the central\r\nlibrary, and everything affecting administration stated throughout this\r\nbook applies, though in a modified degree, to branch work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=400.= In the selection of books for branches the same principles should\r\nbe applied as previously advocated, namely, the endeavour to get a high\r\naverage of quality and utility in the literature added and the\r\ndetermination to discard useless books when the time comes. But an\r\neffort should be made to vary the contents of branch libraries so as to\r\nobtain as catholic and representative a stock as possible. With Fiction,\r\nof course, this is not so easy, especially in the case of popular novels\r\nby well-known writers, but in other classes this can be done frequently.\r\nFor instance, if the north branch has So-and-So’s _Chemistry_, there is\r\nno reason at all why, all things being equal, the south branch should\r\nnot have Someotherbody’s _Chemistry_ and the east branch Someone-else’s.\r\nOf course it is assumed that these are all text-books of fairly equal\r\nmerit. As every library should possess a union catalogue showing the\r\nwhereabouts of every book in the library system, and as borrowers’\r\ntickets should be interchangeable all over the town and not limited to\r\none particular library, this arrangement of different books on similar\r\nsubjects widely enlarges the borrower’s field of choice. If the central\r\nand branch libraries are all interconnected by means of the telephone,\r\nas they ought to be, a borrower at the north branch can ascertain if\r\nSomeotherbody’s _Chemistry_ is available without going himself, and can\r\neasily arrange by waiting a day or shorter time to have the book\r\ndelivered at the nearest branch. At Croydon a system of interchange\r\neffected by means of the municipal tramways, which carry parcels of\r\nbooks free, reduces the waiting for a book at another library to about\r\nthirty minutes. Such systems of interchange are a great convenience in\r\nmany cases, and place the entire resources of the library at the command\r\nof readers, no matter where they may live.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |              LIBERTON PUBLIC LIBRARIES.             |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |                NORTH BRANCH.--REPORT.               |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |    Date........................                     |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |                    |A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|J|K|L|| Total.  |\r\n  | Lending Issues   . | | | | | | | | | | | ||         |\r\n  | Reference Issues . | | | | | | | | | | | ||         |\r\n  |                    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++---------+\r\n  |                    | | | | | | | | | | | ||         |\r\n  |                    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-++---------+\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Receipts from Fines                                 |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |    „       „  Catalogues, etc.                      |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Books asked for                                     |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Books wanted from Central                           |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Supplies wanted                                     |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  | Callers and occurrences                             |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  |                          Signed.................... |\r\n  |                                                     |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 150.--Branch Library Return (Section 399).\r\n\r\n\r\n=401. Delivery Stations.=--A delivery station is a place which may or\r\nmay not have a small deposit collection of books--generally not--and is\r\nmeant to supply readers in thinly populated districts and to be the\r\nforerunner of an orthodox branch to be established when the district\r\ndevelops. Such stations are usually a post-office, school, police\r\nstation, or shop, which may be induced to carry out the necessary\r\ncharging, etc., sometimes at a small remuneration. At the very best a\r\ndelivery station in a town is but a makeshift substitute for a branch,\r\nand, from the borrowers’ point of view, does not afford a very\r\nsatisfactory or expeditious service. If books which are wanted are not\r\n_in_ at the central library, considerable delay and trouble are caused.\r\nBorrowers are compelled to make out long lists of the books they desire\r\nto read, and as often as not these are all out at the central store. As\r\ndelivery stations seldom carry a stock of books from which an\r\nalternative choice can be made, borrowers are driven to the task of\r\nmaking out new lists or taking anything the delivery attendant can get\r\nby telephone, if there is this kind of communication, which is not\r\ngenerally the case; and as delivery stations are frequently managed by\r\nany untrained person obtainable, the reader gets very little help in\r\nsolving real difficulties. Apart from all this, a day must elapse, as a\r\nrule, before any book wanted can be obtained, even if it is available,\r\nand for these reasons the establishment of book-delivery stations is not\r\nadvisable save in remote and inaccessible parts of a large town, when\r\nevery other method of giving a local service has been found\r\nimpracticable. A highly organized system of delivery stations with\r\nfrequent motor deliveries might, however, be made effective in scattered\r\nsuburbs, but although such a system has been suggested, we have no\r\nrecord of a successful British example.\r\n\r\n\r\n=402. Travelling Libraries.=--Of much greater importance are travelling\r\nlibraries, which can be made to serve every purpose of delivery\r\nstations, with the great additional advantage of furnishing, in part,\r\nthe same alternative selection of books as a branch library affords.\r\nThese libraries are much used in the United States, and take the form of\r\nboxes of books numbering from fifty upwards, which can be deposited at\r\nfixed points in towns and rural districts, where borrowers can attend\r\nand make a choice of reading matter. Boxes of books by this plan can be\r\nsent to the care of responsible persons in all parts of a town, and\r\nthese persons can undertake the local delivery and collection of the\r\nbooks, either for a small fee or as voluntary sub-librarians. Various\r\nkinds of records are necessary to keep track of the boxes and their\r\ncontents and where and to whom they travel. Until lately very little of\r\nthis kind of work had been done either in the United Kingdom or America,\r\nalthough the Americans are gradually developing systems of rural\r\ntravelling libraries and town “home” libraries. The travelling libraries\r\nof the States of New York and Wisconsin form a most interesting study,\r\nas also do the “home” libraries of the city of Boston. Lately this\r\nmatter has been given a considerable impetus through the Carnegie United\r\nKingdom Trust, which has established experimental rural library schemes\r\nin various parts of the kingdom in connexion with County Councils and,\r\nmore infrequently, suitable municipal centres. Scotland, Ireland, and\r\nWales, the counties of Dorset, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire,\r\nCumberland and Westmorland have all such schemes in operation or have\r\nundertaken them. These have a central deposit library and circulate\r\nboxes of books at frequent intervals to the villages and towns in the\r\narea, in which the clergy, teachers and others act as honorary\r\nsub-librarians. In this way the people who are not at present touched by\r\nthe public libraries are being brought into the fold. The matter is in\r\nthe experimental stage, and is jeopardized by the fact that, in England\r\nat least, the County Councils have no express powers to provide\r\nlibraries; but results of the most promising kind have already been\r\nobtained, and the day is no doubt at hand when the traditional idea of\r\nthe function of a public library as a store from which literature is\r\ndoled out to the people, _if they know what they want_, will be\r\nsuperseded by a very pronounced missionary spirit, and an endeavour to\r\nmake known in every possible way the value of all kinds of books to all\r\nkinds of people.\r\n\r\n\r\n=403. Subscription Departments or Book Clubs.=--In some of the older\r\nmunicipal libraries subscription departments or book clubs have been\r\nestablished, as a means of increasing the stock of a library, without\r\nmuch expense. Such departments exist at Bolton, Burton, Dewsbury,\r\nDundee, Elgin, Leek, Tynemouth, Wednesbury and Workington. They are\r\noperated as follows: For a certain annual subscription any library\r\nreader or townsman may join this select library. From the subscriptions\r\nso received, supplemented in some places by occasional grants from the\r\nrate, new books are bought, generally in accordance with the wishes of a\r\nmajority of members, but on this point practice varies. For one year\r\nthese books are at the service of subscribers only, who borrow them in\r\nthe usual way, for a fortnight or other periods according to\r\ncircumstances. At the end of the year each book is transferred to the\r\npublic library, and becomes the property of the library authority for\r\nthe use of all borrowers. Where the selection is made with discretion,\r\nthis may seem an economical way of obtaining books for a public library,\r\nand there is much to be said in its favour in present circumstances; but\r\nobjections have been raised. Public libraries, it is argued, have no\r\nright to set up a privileged class in this way, especially as it is\r\nprobable that the subscriptions cannot pay all the cost of service,\r\nlighting, housing, etc.; thus a proportion of the cost of maintenance\r\nfalls on the library funds, and it is doubtful if in the end there is\r\nmuch gain in receiving as a _quid pro quo_ a number of stale and,\r\nperhaps, not very judiciously selected books; and, further, public\r\nlibraries have no right to compete with private and commercial\r\nsubscription libraries for the sake of ministering to the few people who\r\ncan afford the luxury of a select public library to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=404.= Another form of subscription is occasionally indulged in by\r\npublic libraries. By paying a certain subscription to large commercial\r\nlibraries, like Mudie’s, they are entitled to borrow so many volumes at\r\na time, and these are re-issued to the borrowers in the ordinary way,\r\nthe library being responsible for losses. In small libraries this is\r\noften an economical way of obtaining the temporary loan of copies of\r\nexpensive books for which there is a large transient demand, and in this\r\nway the people have immediate access to books which might otherwise\r\nnever be bought, or only obtained in second-hand form long after their\r\ninterest had faded. The only trouble about this arrangement is that it\r\ndepends upon the mood of the said commercial libraries for its\r\ncontinuance. To what extent these would endure a constant drain from a\r\nhundred or so municipal libraries remains to be seen, as also does the\r\nproblem of how they would meet the demand when it attained large\r\ndimensions. At one time certain of the London commercial libraries\r\nabsolutely refused to lend books to public libraries on any terms. Now\r\nthey are more complaisant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=405. Inter-Library Exchanges.=--This is a method of book distribution\r\nwhich has not been tried to any extent among British municipal\r\nlibraries, and some organization would be required to place it on a\r\nworking basis. Briefly, the idea is to enable a public library which has\r\nnot got a particular book, to borrow it from some library which has,\r\nassuming all the responsibility for its safety and due return; and\r\nmaking its own arrangement with its borrower for the cost of carriage.\r\nThis kind of exchanging could be managed better in London than\r\nelsewhere, but it could be applied to any group of libraries, such as\r\nthose of Lancashire, Wales, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, etc. Each\r\nexchanging library would require to possess a complete set of class\r\nlists and bulletins, or other catalogues, of all the other libraries,\r\nand when a demand was made for a book which was not in its possession,\r\nthe assistant could look through the catalogues of the other libraries\r\ntill he found a copy, and it could then be written for, the borrower\r\npaying all resulting expenses. Of course, this arrangement would only\r\napply to non-fictional works. There would be an undoubted advantage,\r\ntoo, if such a privilege could be obtained for public library borrowers\r\nfrom some of the older proprietary libraries with huge stocks of\r\npractically unused books which municipal libraries would not buy in the\r\nordinary course. Arrangements whereby books from special scientific or\r\nother libraries could be borrowed for the use of local borrowers would\r\nalso be an arrangement, could it be managed, which would benefit a\r\ngreater number of students and other persons than at present. But, of\r\ncourse, there would be very serious difficulties in the way of inducing\r\nthe owners of valuable special libraries to lend books for the use of\r\nstrangers introduced by municipal library authorities. Meanwhile,\r\nbecause of these difficulties thousands upon thousands of valuable and\r\nuseful books are lying idle and neglected in every part of the country,\r\na waste of power which it is sad to contemplate.\r\n\r\nA modification of this idea is the arrangement now made between a few\r\ntowns whereby readers from the one who are visiting the other, who have\r\nbeen vouched for as being in good standing by their own library, are\r\npermitted to borrow books from the library in the town visited. Such an\r\narrangement exists between Brighton and Croydon, Waterloo has a similar\r\nscheme, and possibly other places, and these have given much\r\nsatisfaction. The main difficulty is that few inland libraries can give\r\na full return to libraries in pleasure or health resorts, but perhaps\r\ntoo much emphasis should not be laid upon the necessity for an absolute\r\nreturn of service.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE LIST OF AUTHORITIES\r\n\r\n\r\n=406.

Character and Scope of the Department.=--The reference library is\r\nthe communal study, bureau of information, and muniment house, when it\r\nis developed to its full possibilities. A definition of reference work\r\nturns upon a definition of a reference book to a large extent, and it is\r\nnot easy to give more than an approximate one. A reference book is one\r\nwhich is consulted to obtain some particular fact or matter from it and\r\nnot one that is read through as a whole. All works in dictionary,\r\nencyclopædic, chronological, periodical and similar forms are of this\r\ncharacter. But any book which may be consulted in the way indicated is\r\nalso legitimately a reference book. Further, all literary and graphic\r\nmaterial which may so be consulted, whether in MSS., printed,\r\nphotographic or other form, is rightly a part of such a library. The\r\nencyclopædic work is therefore the basal stock of the department; and\r\nstandard treatises on every branch of literature, whether in actual\r\nreference form or not; the definitive editions of the classics, as for\r\nexample the Variorum Shakespeare, must be included. Transient or\r\npermanent small reference material, such as pamphlets, magazine\r\narticles, broadsides, news-clippings, trade catalogues, illustrations,\r\nmaps, etc., should all find a place in it; in fact, much of the most\r\nvalued information work is done with the aid of such small material;\r\nimportant facts are frequently found in seemingly insignificant\r\nmaterial; and the work of bringing it in relation to other similar\r\nmaterial is one of the first-class services of the reference library.\r\n\r\nFrom such a statement of the nature of the stock the purpose of the\r\ndepartment may be deduced. Primarily, as its name implies, it is a place\r\nwhere references to books are made; but, although this is primary, it is\r\ntoo limited a statement of the functions of the department. In it\r\ncontinuous reading, research, and prolonged study are all carried on,\r\nand if a library does not provide facilities for these it is to that\r\nextent inefficient. These considerations give rise to certain necessary\r\narrangements, the first of which is freedom of access to quick-reference\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.--The Mitchell Library, Glasgow. A recent large\r\nreference library, with a great central reading-room, and several\r\nspecial departments.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--Plan of Islington Reference Library.]\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the library building it is essential that the most\r\nquiet part of the building which is accessible to the public should be\r\ndevoted to the reference department. It should be a room which in its\r\ndesign and proportions is dignified, and produces by these things and\r\nits furnishing and decorations an atmosphere conducive to mental\r\ntranquillity and study. It is impossible to define such an atmosphere,\r\nbut it exists in all really successful reference libraries, and these\r\nmay be studied at most of our great cities and towns, as at Bristol,\r\nBirmingham, Liverpool, in the British Museum, and elsewhere. The\r\ndecorations, for example, if there are any beyond the merely\r\narchitectural, such as painted ceilings, walls, etc., should indeed be\r\nartistic, but are appropriate only when they are restrained,\r\ninobtrusive, and do not divert readers from the main purpose of the\r\nroom or encourage visitors to come merely to stare at them. Some\r\nreference libraries, built on ecclesiastical models, have stained-glass\r\nwindows which are beautiful features, but the same principles apply in\r\nthis form of decoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=408. Furniture.=--The library furniture must depend upon the size,\r\nshape and lighting of the room, but the alcove system, as it exists at\r\nthe Bodleian and similar older libraries, has never been surpassed from\r\nthe point of view of _study_, although it is possibly not so good as the\r\nrotunda of the British Museum, or that of the Library of Congress, and\r\nthe Picton Reading Room at Liverpool, for merely reference purposes.\r\nAgain, the alcove system occupies more space than one in which the cases\r\nare fixed against the walls and arranged in other parts of the room to\r\nsecure the maximum of shelf accommodation. As regards tables and seating\r\naccommodation the older reference departments in municipal libraries has\r\nusually been defective in that they merely allowed seats at long tables,\r\nwith about twenty-four inches of sitting space and a half of a two- or\r\nthree-foot table in front, often with provision, equally scant, for a\r\nreader to sit opposite. The reference reader requires not only\r\nisolation, to a considerable extent, as is provided at the British\r\nMuseum, but plenty of space in which to spread out his books and papers.\r\nMoreover, nothing is more disconcerting and uncomfortable to a reader\r\nthan the unpleasant proximity of other people, and no student or reader\r\nwho makes extracts, or has to wrestle with obstinate facts in history,\r\nscience or philology, can do so if he is environed by others similarly\r\nor otherwise engaged, at very close quarters. This is recognized in the\r\nBritish Museum and similar libraries, where each reader has what is\r\nvirtually a desk to himself so constructed as to secure the maximum of\r\nprivacy. The provision of small, self-contained separate tables as\r\ndescribed in Section 161 is probably the best that can be made. These\r\nnot only give plenty of space at the top, but also provide a definite\r\namount of space for books, etc., under the tables themselves. For the\r\nconsultation of elephant folios and similar very large books the special\r\nslope outlined in Fig. 33 and described in Section 153 is a reasonable\r\nand necessary provision. One or two large flat tables for use in special\r\ncases are also to be desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--The Islington Reference Library. Note the\r\nspecial tables.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=409. Access.=--For successful reference work a certain measure of open\r\naccess is essential, and is allowed by most libraries which otherwise\r\nare arranged on the closed system. The British Museum, Birmingham and\r\nother large reference libraries allow readers free choice from a\r\nselected assortment of books, numbering from a few to 20,000 or more\r\nvolumes, of quick-reference character, including atlases, gazetteers,\r\ndictionaries, directories, encyclopædias, codes, etc., which answer\r\neveryday questions and which are wanted without delay. These, in\r\nthemselves, form a fairly considerable reference library, and that fact\r\nshould be recognized when the question of access is under consideration.\r\nOther libraries allow freedom of access to nearly the whole collection;\r\nbut none allows it to the whole. There are in many libraries unique\r\nbooks, records, and other works to which access is wisely limited, in\r\nthe interest of their preservation as records and from other points of\r\nview. These, however, form an infinitesimal part of the stock of average\r\nmunicipal collections. All it is wished to emphasize here is that open\r\naccess without any formality whatever should be allowed to the obvious\r\nquick-reference works of the kind enumerated above. A much-occupied\r\nbusiness man who wants an address, the definition of a word, or a cable\r\ncode is not likely to endure the bother of filling up application forms\r\npatiently; and to insist upon it may mean the loss of the patronage of a\r\nvaluable class of the community. For the general part of the reference\r\nlibrary where open access is in vogue admission is usually gained by\r\nsigning the visitors’ book. Such signing has not definite safeguarding\r\nvalue, but is to some extent a moral check upon would-be defaulters, and\r\nis useful as a means of registering the number of readers. The plans\r\ngiven in Chapter VII. give some idea of the disposition of the ordinary\r\nreference library, and no one plan can be called the best. All that can\r\nbe affirmed positively is that ample reading space should be allowed,\r\nthat good light, natural and artificial, and ventilation, ease of\r\nadministering the stock, close classification and the fullest\r\ncataloguing possible should be aimed at. The commonest error, as we have\r\nhinted, is crowding and insufficiency of seating accommodation. A\r\nwell-administered reference library creates its own reading public, and\r\naccommodation which may be ample at the opening of the library often\r\nproves in a few years to be inadequate.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                  CAREVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY.                     |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                    REFERENCE DEPARTMENT.                       |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |   No Book must on any account be removed from this room, or    |\r\n  |                 transferred to other readers.                  |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  +----------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  | Book No. |  Author and Title of Book.  | Initial of Assistant. |\r\n  +----------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |          |                             |                       |\r\n  |          |                             |                       |\r\n  |          |                             |                       |\r\n  |          |                             |                       |\r\n  |          |                             |                       |\r\n  +----------+-----------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  | Name of Applicant............................................. |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  | Address....................................................... |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  |                        Date................................... |\r\n  |                                                                |\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 154.--Reference Library Application Form (Section 409).\r\n\r\nWhere access to shelves is not allowed, and application forms are used,\r\nit is customary to supply blanks similar to that shown in Fig. 154, on\r\nwhich particulars of the book wanted are entered. In some libraries\r\nthese slips are placed on the shelves in the place of the books issued,\r\nand remain there till the books are replaced. To ascertain that no books\r\nare missing an assistant examines the shelves every morning, and notes\r\nany slips still remaining which represent books issued on the previous\r\nday. To facilitate this operation a differently coloured slip may be\r\nused on alternate days--white to-day, blue to-morrow--so that on a white\r\nday the presence of a blue slip will instantly draw attention to a\r\nmisplacement or a missing book. In other libraries the slips are filed\r\nnear the point of issue, and remain there as a check against the shelves\r\nand the readers until the books are returned. Some libraries return the\r\nslips to the borrowers as a receipt, and compile their statistics from\r\nthe books; others retain the slips and make up their statistics from\r\nthem. Some libraries also insert an issue label in the inside front of\r\neach book, which is stamped every time the book is issued, and thus a\r\nrecord is made of a book’s popularity or otherwise, which should prove\r\nuseful when discarding has to be considered. Application forms, or for\r\nthat matter signatures in visitors’ books, are no protection against\r\nthefts of books. Readers have simply to give a false name and address,\r\nand walk off with any book they please, if they intend theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n=410.= It is the common practice in open access reference libraries to\r\nhave notices displayed of this nature:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n  | =Readers are requested not     |\r\n  | to return books to the shelves |\r\n  | when they have done with       |\r\n  | them, but to close them and    |\r\n  | leave them on the table.=      |\r\n  +--------------------------------+\r\n\r\nOr, they may be required to return them to the assistant; in any case it\r\nis better for readers not to return them to the shelves personally.\r\nEither of the methods recommended enables the staff to make records of\r\nthe use of books. The consultations can be entered up in a rough-ruled\r\nand classified book kept for the purpose, and the staff can replace the\r\nbooks at once. It will be recognized that complete statistics are\r\npractically impossible in open access departments, because only books so\r\nleft on the tables or taken to the tables can be counted; but much\r\nvaluable work is done by readers in the shape of rapid consultations at\r\nthe shelves with immediate replacing of the volumes consulted.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be his general method, the wise librarian will never limit\r\na reader to one or any number of books at a time. Sometimes a dozen--we\r\nhave known fifty--books are required to settle a comparatively small\r\npoint. They are forthcoming in a good reference library. Students of\r\nrecognized regularity may even be released from overmuch form-filling;\r\nfifty forms for the fifty books we have named would be an interminable\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n\r\n=411. The Stock.=--The building-up of a reference stock demands the\r\nhighest skill and prevision in the librarian. The purpose which it is\r\nintended to serve must be clearly before his eyes, and this may, and\r\ndoes, differ with differing places. A library in a distinctly commercial\r\nand industrial area faces needs obviously different from one in a purely\r\nresidential area. But in all libraries every kind of dictionary and\r\nencyclopædia, general and special, philological, technical, scientific\r\nand historical, is a prime requisite. On these the stock will be\r\nbalanced with a view to procuring the best and latest statement of\r\nknowledge in every field. This end the too-often neglected\r\nbibliographical collection subserves. Every general and special\r\nbibliography from the British Museum catalogue to the small select\r\ncatalogues issued by local libraries, every index, every special\r\ncatalogue, indeed every catalogue within reason of other libraries which\r\na librarian can procure, is a necessary tool in building up the\r\ncollection and in tracking information when it is complete. There have\r\nbeen many select bibliographies, but there is still room for many more.\r\nThe average bibliography of a subject is not selected; it aims at\r\ncompleteness, and seems to assume that its users are people who want to\r\nspend a lifetime on the subject. There are such, no doubt, but to the\r\naverage reader it presents a formidable if not paralysing array of\r\nentries. What is needed, both from experts and from libraries, is a\r\nseries of very brief lists which contain only the best books given in\r\norder of their value, comprehensiveness, historical character, and so\r\non. Knowledge of bibliographies and the methods of using them is the\r\nchief part of the equipment of the reference librarian.\r\n\r\nIn this work there are two ideals, as was shown when the general\r\nquestion of book selection was under consideration: one the museum\r\nideal, in which every kind of book of every age is collected; the other\r\nwhich limits the stock to books of proved or probable utility to the\r\npopulation served. The former is the business of the national libraries\r\nand those of the great centres of population, such as Glasgow,\r\nBirmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, etc., and to a\r\ncertain extent those which are at great distance from such large\r\ncentres; and special libraries within their own fields should be\r\nexhaustive. But this ideal is not for other libraries, except in so far\r\nas it applies to the local collection; that should contain everything of\r\nwhatever value. Otherwise the live book is what is wanted. The ordinary\r\nreference library should therefore be revised periodically, obsolete and\r\ndead stock should be discarded, and no book should be included because\r\nit does not appeal to lending library readers or has been received as a\r\ngift for which there seems to be no other depository--these are\r\nemphatically books to be excluded. With these general provisions a brief\r\nsurvey of the principal requirements of the stock may have its uses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.--The Picton Reading Room, the Central Reference\r\nLibrary of Liverpool.]\r\n\r\n  I. Quick-reference works of every type.\r\n\r\n  II. Bibliographies, general and select, and catalogues of every type.\r\n\r\n  III. The best editions of the classic authors in every language.\r\n\r\n  IV. The most comprehensive compendiums and treatises on every subject.\r\n\r\n  V. All material on the predominating local industry.\r\n\r\n  VI. All books, pamphlets, and all other literary, pictorial and\r\n  graphic matter relating to the locality. This will be dealt with more\r\n  fully in considering the Local Collection.\r\n\r\n  VII. Permanent files of at least _The Times_, and all local\r\n  newspapers; and temporary files of other newspapers most in demand.\r\n\r\n  VIII. Sets of periodicals, as indexed in the Library Association\r\n  _Index of Periodicals_. This is a rather large business, and should be\r\n  attempted only by libraries that can afford the cost. Others should\r\n  elect to keep only those of such character as to add permanently to\r\n  the book-strength of the library, and to use the Periodicals Loan\r\n  Library, which is worked in conjunction with the _Index of\r\n  Periodicals_, for other periodical material. All periodical indexes,\r\n  whether general, as Poole’s, _The Review of Reviews_, _The Athenæum_,\r\n  and The Wilson Company’s, or particular, as _The Times_, the indexes\r\n  to _The Quarterly_, _The Edinburgh_, etc. The value of these in large\r\n  libraries is obvious; it is not always so clearly recognized that they\r\n  have even a greater value for smaller libraries as clues to accessible\r\n  material which may not be in their stocks. In any case the Library\r\n  Association index should be taken.\r\n\r\n  IX. The publications of the major learned and scientific societies, as\r\n  the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical, the Historical and similar\r\n  societies. These present knowledge well in advance of that contained\r\n  in books as a rule.\r\n\r\n  X. Clippings from newspapers and periodicals which have definite\r\n  facts, in addition to those contained in books, and on current\r\n  happenings of moment, matters of “useful” character (the day to day\r\n  changes in rationing rules, etc., during the war are a case in point)\r\n  and similar material having an immediate, and real, if transient\r\n  value.\r\n\r\n  XI. Government publications, which in most libraries may be selected\r\n  after a brief interval. Many of the reports of commissions, surveys,\r\n  etc., have a high permanent value.\r\n\r\nThis conspectus is not necessarily complete, nor is all the material\r\nnamed of equal value or equally in demand; but every librarian should\r\nreview these headings in relation to his reference department. To place\r\nrigid limits upon the stock is absurd, seeing that utility and not\r\nmathematical or other precision is the object of the work. If,\r\ntherefore, a librarian finds some other special field of material is\r\ndemanded he should add it without hesitation if he is convinced that the\r\ndemand is not frivolous or very restricted. For example, to add an\r\nexpensive and recondite (say) archæological treatise in Modern Greek at\r\nthe behest of one reader is a case in which his decision might wisely be\r\nfor refusal.\r\n\r\n\r\n=412. Classification.=--In its classification the reference library\r\npresents more physical problems than the lending library. The most\r\nminute classification is the best undoubtedly, and this should be used;\r\nbut the size problem is a real one. While the greater number of\r\nreference books are of octavo size, quartos, folios, and even larger\r\nbooks are many. They cannot stand together in class sequence without an\r\nimpossible loss of space. The simplest method is to have three\r\nsequences, for octavos, quartos and folios respectively, in\r\nappropriately sized shelves, in three different parts of the room. But\r\nthis means various journeys across the room when all the books on a\r\nsubject are required. The distance is abbreviated if the octavos,\r\nquartos and folios follow one another in each class. A third method\r\nwhich has proved most successful is to divide every tier (which is\r\npresumed to have adjustable shelves) into three parts and to run three\r\nparallel sequences in each, the octavos occupying the top part, the\r\nquartos the middle, and the folios the bottom. The parallel can be only\r\napproximate, but it is sufficiently close for the reader or the staff\r\nto review any subject completely and readily. With any of these methods\r\nbroken order may be resorted to if it is thought well. The arranging of\r\nall quick-reference books in a separate complete sequence nearest the\r\nentrance or the place of service is a case in point; and special\r\nseparate classifications may well be given to periodicals, to local\r\nliterature, to the predominating industry, and so on without limit.\r\nAgain, convenience is the supreme law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 156.--The Main Reading Room of the Royal Society of\r\nMedicine, a modern open access reference library.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=413. Cataloguing.=--The catalogue of the department should aim at the\r\nmaximum of fulness and be in as many forms as are necessary to bring out\r\nthe entire resources of the department; there should be no retrenchment\r\nof time or labour in producing the best here, as a small collection of\r\nbooks adequately catalogued will give greater service than a larger one\r\ncatalogued poorly. It is not an unfair paradox to say that the smaller\r\n(within reason) a reference library is the more detailed should be its\r\ncatalogue. This being so, whatever kind of catalogue may publish the\r\nbasal stock, the general current needs of the library can be kept\r\nsupplied only by a card or slip catalogue of unlimited expansibility.\r\nThe reference catalogue, even for books already in stock, can rarely be\r\ncomplete, and any fixed form of printed catalogue, unless it is\r\nsupplemented by a MS. catalogue, will soon fail signally as a guide to\r\nthe collection. As to the cataloguing form, experience proves that a\r\nmere author catalogue has a very limited value in reference work. It\r\nshould be provided in some form, of course, but for one reader who\r\ninquires for a book by its author, a score require something about\r\nsubjects, usually specific subjects such as the Horse, Verdun, Violin\r\nstrings, Election Law, Tithes, Date of a Battle, Arms of Sussex,\r\nBirthplace of Douglas Haig, Words of a Poem, etc. There must therefore\r\nbe some form of subject catalogue, and there is much virtue in the fully\r\nclassified card or sheaf catalogue, with author and subject indexes.\r\nThese, if carried out efficiently and minutely, will do the work that is\r\nrequired. By fulness of entry we mean that titles should be abbreviated\r\nas little as is possible within common-sense limits; that all\r\nbibliographical particulars, number of volumes, size, pagination, date,\r\nillustrations, maps, diagrams, glossaries, indexes, bibliographies and\r\ndate and places of publication (except when London) should be indicated.\r\nMoreover, annotations of obscure books, and indicating sequences,\r\ncommentaries, missing parts, and so on, are of special value here. Added\r\nentries may, and should, be carried as far as the cataloguing resources\r\nof the library allow, all books of composite character, miscellaneous\r\nworks, transactions, many periodicals, etc., being analysed and\r\ndisplayed in the catalogue under their class headings. It is also most\r\nuseful to collect in the catalogue references to bibliographies of all\r\nkinds contained in works which are in the lending library. For examples,\r\nthe Home University Library and the Cambridge Manuals of Science and\r\nLiterature are not books to be found in the average reference library,\r\nbut they contain excellent little select bibliographies which the\r\nreference librarian will find useful, and an entry of each of these\r\nshould be made. Every item which goes into the library should be\r\ncatalogued, pamphlets and excerpts from other works, however small,\r\nincluded, if it is intended to preserve them, as well as maps.\r\nPhotographs and prints probably need a separate catalogue, as certain\r\nconsiderations, dealt with later on, enter into their cataloguing, but\r\nin a card catalogue provision can be made for nearly every kind of\r\nmaterial. Temporary material may be entered on a coloured card, which\r\npermits of rapid revision of the entries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.--Reading Table, Chair, and Accessories, Royal\r\nSociety of Medicine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=414. Pamphlets.=--Pamphlets and magazine excerpts form a large part of\r\nevery reference library and are often difficult to deal with\r\neffectively. When not bound in volumes, they may be stitched in manila\r\nwrappers, and stored in boxes of various sizes, such as 8vo, 4to, etc.,\r\nof the kind specified in Section 306. Each pamphlet should be lettered\r\non the side of its wrapper, with its author, title, date, class letter\r\nand number and accession number. The collection might be commenced with\r\nan 8vo box for each class, and gradually extended from this nucleus as\r\nthe stock increased, the contents of boxes being divided and subdivided,\r\nand placed in new boxes with changed lettering. As these would be\r\narranged in class order, there would be no more difficulty in finding a\r\nsingle pamphlet than in finding a book. With miscellaneous collections\r\nof pamphlets bound in volumes, the best plan is to renumber them in a\r\nprogressive series, and carry the volume number against the catalogue or\r\nother entry. It is not advisable to run more than one series of numbers,\r\nand if by chance a collection is acquired which is already numbered,\r\nthese should be covered over with the continuation numbers of the\r\nlibrary’s own progressive series. On the whole it is better not to bind\r\npamphlets, partly owing to their miscellaneous nature, which prevents\r\nany real classification or even approximate subject order in the volumes\r\ncomposed of them, partly because of their very temporary value as a rule\r\nand because of the impossibility of inserting new ones into bound\r\nvolumes. A student or discoverer frequently advances his first\r\nconclusions in a pamphlet, and sooner or later these are superseded by\r\nbooks, and many pamphlets are merely statements of views upon political\r\nand other questions of much immediate but usually quite passing\r\ninterest. In the average library they become dead stock in a few months\r\nor years. Pamphlet collections should be weeded out more frequently than\r\nbook collections.\r\n\r\n\r\n=415.= The vertical file is the most adequate method of dealing with\r\ncuttings, broadsides and similar separate matter. If the folders are\r\nclosely classified, the ordinary printed index to the classification\r\nscheme used is a fairly good key; but a slip index of some kind will\r\nexhaust the file better and accelerate reference. If a brief index entry\r\nis made before the cutting is dropped into its folder, in some such form\r\nas follows, the work will not be unduly burdensome:\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | ATLANTIC FLIGHT.                                 |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |        U.S. Seaplane, NC4, flies to Lisbon.      |\r\n  |                                                  |\r\n  |                    D.

Accessories.=--Every means of comfort and every reasonable aid to\r\nstudy should be given to readers. We have dealt with reading tables. The\r\nchairs deserve almost equal consideration. They should be comfortable;\r\nan arm-chair is better than other forms. The view at one time expressed\r\nthat seats without backs in some way induced to mental alertness was\r\nthat of some stupid theorist; as a matter of fact ease of body is\r\nessential to elasticity of mind. Chairs should have rubber tips or\r\nsilent castors to prevent the nerve-racking scritching which moving\r\nchairs too frequently make, but when metal castors are used they should\r\nnot be of the slippery variety that slides readers unexpectedly on to\r\nthe floor. Reading stands with clips for holding books open should be on\r\nevery table, or provided in sufficient numbers to meet all probable\r\nneeds. At certain tables the use of ink should be permitted, and\r\nblotting pads, ink, pens, etc., should be provided. Tracing may be\r\npermitted from most illustrated books, prints, etc., but as a protection\r\na sheet of xylonite should be available and the reader be required to\r\ninterpose it between the copy and his tracing paper. Sheets in several\r\nsizes should be kept for use with books of different sizes. Rulers, [T]\r\nsquares, a map measurer, a reading glass, compasses, etc., may all\r\nreasonably form part of the equipment and be lent on request. Scrap\r\npaper for notes, both at the catalogues and at the tables, is another\r\nreasonable provision, as is a small stock of foolscap which readers may\r\npurchase at cost price. Some libraries have the rule that letters must\r\nnot be written in the room, and it has its uses, as cases are not\r\nunknown where nomadic business men, election agents, etc., have\r\nmonopolized tables for hours or days for the distinctly non-literary and\r\nnon-library purpose of addressing circulars; but the writing of\r\noccasional correspondence, if it does not exclude other readers from the\r\nwriting tables, may safely be winked at. Other libraries do not allow\r\nthe reading of other books than those from the shelves in the\r\ndepartment, but the absurdity of such a rule, if carried to its logical\r\nconclusion, is patent. It may not be superfluous to add that every\r\nreference library should be equipped with a stand for hats, coats and\r\numbrellas, but readers may be warned by notice that the library does not\r\naccept responsibility for their safety.\r\n\r\nAll the forces of the library stock in all departments should be at the\r\ndisposal of the reference reader; thus any book in the lending\r\nlibraries, except perhaps current novels of the popular kind, which may\r\nbe on the shelves, should be allowed to be requisitioned, as also should\r\nany newspaper, periodical or other material in files which may not form\r\npart of the department. A good plan in open access libraries is to give\r\nthe reference reader a pass admitting him to consult the lending library\r\ncatalogues or shelves, but after he has selected books from them to have\r\nthem brought from the lending library by the staff. Such uses of lending\r\nlibrary books should count as reference consultations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=417. The Lending of Reference Books.=--Whether or not reference library\r\nbooks should ever be lent away from the building is a question upon\r\nwhich librarians are sharply divided. It is argued that a reference\r\nlibrary is a place where a reader has a right to expect every book in\r\nstock to be available at all times, and this is a reasonable theory.\r\nThat reader, however, is a hypothetical person as a rule, and too rigid\r\na policy of refusal has some disadvantages. Experience tells every\r\nlibrarian what books ought not to be lent in ordinary circumstances, if\r\nin any; and these are quick-reference books of all kinds, and any book\r\nthe loss of or damage to which would be irreparable. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, a real student really requires the home use of a reference book\r\nwhich is not in everyday demand, and the library would suffer little and\r\nmight gain much by lending it. If the ordinary loan periods are thought\r\nto be inadmissible, much can be said for lending over week-ends or at\r\nhours when the library is inaccessible to readers. It is a question\r\nwhich every librarian must settle for himself. In one successful\r\nreference library which lends, when a reasonable cause is shown, every\r\nbook not excluded by the exceptions just named, and has done so for\r\ntwenty years without the least inconvenience, a form of application,\r\nwhich is also a charging form, is used. This is a card 6 inches × 5\r\ninches, which folds in the middle and files as a standard-sized\r\ncatalogue card (3 inches × 5 inches):\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  | _Purpose wanted for_ ............................................ |\r\n  | _Why Book cannot be studied in Library_ ......................... |\r\n  |                                                                   |\r\n  |           (Do not write below this line.)

There are so few of them\r\n(probably a dozen weekly) that any other form of charging has been found\r\nto be unnecessary. The assistant concerned in the work examines the file\r\nweekly, and books overdue are written for immediately. Borrowers guilty\r\nof retaining reference books beyond the allowed time are denied the\r\nprivilege of borrowing thereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=418. Staff.=--It is fair to say that there are too few reference\r\nlibrarians in this country; that is to say, persons who, in addition to\r\nordinary scholarship and library technique, have trained specially in\r\nbibliography, the drawing out of readers and information-hunting.\r\nPerhaps as a result of the library schools now in course of organization\r\na race of such useful librarians will arise. The staffing of the\r\nreference library is perhaps the greatest difficulty a librarian has to\r\novercome. In the larger libraries the department is in the control of\r\nexperts, or at any rate of the most efficient workers on the staff, but\r\nin smaller towns it falls to the keeping of an assistant, often a\r\ndifferent person every day or even shift, who can be spared from the\r\ngeneral staff; indeed, in some libraries reference work is so small that\r\nthis is all that can be afforded. In such circumstances the best work is\r\nout of the question. The reference reader demands skilled attention.\r\nLibraries catering for a learned or special clientele have their own\r\nspecial problems; but the ordinary civic library has, in addition to\r\nnumbers of such clients, the average man and woman to deal with who are\r\nnot only unskilled in the use of books, but have also some difficulty in\r\nmaking known their actual needs. It is obviously beyond the power of a\r\nboy or girl assistant to draw out of these readers the exact nature of\r\ntheir difficulties; that is a task requiring address, sympathy and tact,\r\nwhich experience alone gives. In small libraries the librarian himself\r\nmay consider it a privilege to work at busy times in this department; it\r\nwill be well worth his while. The qualifications a reference librarian\r\nshould aim to possess are a complete library technique, an intimate\r\nknowledge of the sources of information and of his stock, and a certain\r\nmissionary spirit which loves knowledge for its own sake. In addition he\r\nmust have sympathy with all classes of inquirers and be able to suffer\r\nfools gladly. On the technical side he will find in certain little books\r\na good elementary grounding; among them is Hopkins’s _Reference Guides_,\r\nKroeger’s _Guide to Reference Books_, and so on. All juniors in a\r\nreference department should go through a course based upon these, and\r\ncourses in practical book-selection and bibliography. No question should\r\nbe regarded as trivial; it is no part of the librarian’s duty to assess\r\nthe value of any information asked; and patience even beyond what may\r\nseem reasonable limits is an everyday requirement. For example, the\r\nquestion once asked, “On which side of Cromwell’s nose was there a\r\nwart?” seemed frivolous enough, and it involved the consulting of dozens\r\nof books; but it proved to be wanted for the identification of what is\r\nbelieved to be a unique death mask.\r\n\r\n\r\n=419. Records.=--All information the sources of which were not obvious\r\nshould be recorded on cards, together with the sources from which it was\r\ngiven, in order that similar search may not be necessary when it is\r\nrequired again. Carbon copies of all special lists of books compiled\r\nshould be filed for future use. Failures of the library are most\r\nimportant as showing deficiencies in the collection, and questions which\r\ncould not be answered should always be recorded. When a reference\r\nlibrary cannot supply information from its own resources, it should\r\nendeavour to find what neighbouring library can supply it, and either\r\ndirect the inquirer there, or, better, borrow the book required. Mutual\r\nco-operation of this kind between libraries is easy to arrange, and few\r\nlibrarians do not recognize its value. It should always be borne in mind\r\nthat to turn a reader away empty is a loss of prestige to the library,\r\nwhile a reader well served and satisfied is a potential friend and\r\nprobable patron afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n=420. Special Library Collections.=--In the average town it should be\r\nthe endeavour to concentrate all the special libraries of institutions\r\nand societies in the reference library. It is obviously an uneconomy for\r\nspecial collections to be locked up for the greater part of the week in\r\nthe private rooms of institutions and societies when they may be made\r\navailable all day and every day to the members of these societies and to\r\nthe general public in the municipal reference library. These bodies may\r\noften be induced to deposit their collection if some simple arrangement\r\nis made by which books may be lent as required to their members and may\r\nbe available to everybody for reference purpose when not so lent out. By\r\nthis means a useful reinforcement of the stock is made at the expense of\r\nshelf-room and administration only. It is usual to catalogue such\r\ncollections exactly as other parts of the stock, but to add some\r\nindividualizing symbol to the class-mark to show its ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n=421. Information Bureaux.=--Among the many possibilities of the\r\ndepartment we shall confine ourselves in this chapter to its use as an\r\ninformation bureau, leaving such important considerations as the Local\r\nCollection, and its auxiliaries Regional and Photographic Surveys, and\r\nCommercial Libraries for treatment in separate chapters. The information\r\ndesk or bureau is the name given to the department of the work which\r\nlays itself out to answer inquiries for business and other people. It is\r\nprimarily quick-reference work and is done in proximity to the\r\nquick-reference collection. But it goes further in the direction of\r\nsupplying such current information as the present population of the\r\ntown, its rates, etc., the addresses of burgesses, the latest Derby\r\nwinner, the cable code used by this or that firm, the plays available at\r\nthe theatres, the social or other events of this, next or last week, and\r\nindeed any useful or convenient information whatsoever. Much of the\r\nmaterial needed is in the quick-reference collection, much must be\r\nclipped from the newspapers, and some--as, for example, the programmes\r\nof local societies--must be sought for at first-hand. It may be objected\r\nthat this information may, to an extent, be found in newspapers by the\r\ninquirers themselves. Admitted; but they have not always the required\r\nnewspaper at hand, and the information bureau is always there. Briefly\r\nindexed vertical files, within hand-reach of a public telephone, are the\r\nmeans of working such bureaux. The telephone is essential to real\r\nsuccess, and inquiries by telephone should be invited. Where there are\r\ncommercial libraries in connexion with the library system, much of this\r\nwork may be done in them, but there is, as the examples given above\r\nshow, a large amount of work that can be done outside their field; and a\r\nready and efficient information bureau is a real asset to any town.\r\n\r\n\r\n=422. Indexes of Readers.=--Another useful work that in large libraries\r\nmay properly be relegated to the cataloguing department may be conducted\r\nin smaller ones by the reference staff. This is the supplying of firms\r\nand individuals with lists of books of use in connexion with their\r\nindustry or study. Some libraries supply such people with a small card\r\ncatalogue of the whole of their subject as it is represented in the\r\nlibraries, and send cards regularly for entries of additions. Other\r\nforms of catalogues can be used, of course, for this purpose. In\r\nconjunction therewith, and as a useful adjunct to other work, it is a\r\ngood plan to make card entries of the special subjects affected by\r\nindividual readers under the names of the subjects, and to advise the\r\nreaders by post-cards of all additions made in those subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n=423.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Bodleian Library.

General.=--Of the departments of reference, other than the general\r\nworking department, prior consideration may be given to the Local\r\nCollection on the ground that every municipal public library must have a\r\ncollection of this kind. At any rate it should have as complete a\r\ncollection as possible of material relating to its town. County\r\ncollections are a much more serious matter and should only be attempted\r\nby towns of county rank, or the town in each county where the majority\r\nof the population is. There is hardly a county in England which can\r\nsupport two county collections, because rival collections are mutually\r\ninimical, and their competition for certain items causes the price of\r\nthe latter to increase absurdly. The town is another matter. The one\r\nplace where copies of books, pamphlets, photographs, etc., relating to a\r\ntown ought to be found is its public library; and there are several\r\nprinciples, warnings and suggestions that may be enunciated in connexion\r\nwith the work. The relative value of the material to be collected is\r\nhardly a matter for the librarian; often most despised material has\r\ngreat value when brought into relation to other material. The best\r\ngeneral principle is: “Get everything and leave its evaluation to\r\nposterity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=425. Material collected.=--Primarily the words local collection are\r\nco-extensive with local bibliography. This last term, however, is too\r\nnarrow, and the broad headings embraced by the collection may be set\r\nout, and then considered in detail. These are:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Printed records.\r\n  (_b_) Written records.\r\n  (_c_) Pictorial records.\r\n  (_d_) Engraved records.\r\n\r\nAll or most of these are found in every local collection, and their\r\nstatement immediately raises the question: Can pictorial records,\r\nalthough undoubtedly a part of local history, come into the province of\r\nthe library? Are they not rather in that of the art gallery? Similarly\r\nare not engraved records (bronze coins, tokens, rubbings of monumental\r\nbrasses and seals) better placed in the museum? It may be urged that the\r\nart gallery is concerned with art, the museum with science, and the\r\nlibrary (in this connexion) with history. Pictures and engraved articles\r\nare not collected by the librarian because of their artistic\r\nqualities--in fact, many of his most cherished possessions are artistic\r\natrocities--but because they are records. On this argument a good case\r\ncan be made for their retention in the library. No doubt, where a town\r\nhas the three institutions named, and where the local collecting spirit\r\nis at work in each, and is definitely co-ordinated, it would be wise and\r\neconomical to sub-divide the field; but where there is only the library,\r\nthere can be only one principle, and that the one already\r\nemphasized--”get everything.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=426.= When we come to consider the printed records of any locality, we\r\nare surprised at their extent. These, again, can be set out in a brief\r\ntabular form:\r\n\r\n  A. Books _of_ the locality.\r\n\r\n    1. By local authors.\r\n    2. Locally printed.\r\n    3. Newspapers and periodicals.\r\n    4. Public material: parliamentary, legal, etc.\r\n    5. Public material: municipal.\r\n    6. Trade material.\r\n    7. Programmes: theatre, cinema, music hall, concert hall, etc.\r\n    8. Posters.\r\n\r\n  B. Books _on_ the locality.\r\n\r\n    1. Topography.\r\n    2. History.\r\n    3. Biography.\r\n    4. Public material: parliamentary, legal, etc.\r\n    5. Novels, poems, and plays with local setting.\r\n    6. Newspaper and periodical references.\r\n\r\nThese headings cover a wide area, but the presence of every form of\r\nmaterial named is desirable in the local collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n=427.= For the purposes of the local collection an author may be defined\r\nas 1, a writer who is born, and educated in whole or part, in a town, or\r\nwhose family is indigenous in it; 2, residents of some years’ standing\r\nor whose works reflect the locality; 3, authors of utterances or\r\nwritings made in, or upon, or addressed to the locality; 4, public men,\r\nofficials, etc.; 5, any minister, public speaker, etc., who holds office\r\nor meetings in the town; 6, all local bodies, public or private--the\r\nmunicipality, churches, societies, clubs, etc.; and 7, all local\r\ntradesmen--catalogues, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is a prime duty of every public library to collect locally printed\r\nbooks; the _lacunæ_ in our national bibliography have been lamentable in\r\nthe past in regard to locally and privately printed books, owing to the\r\nlack of such collecting, and they are not likely to decrease if this\r\nduty is not vigorously undertaken by the librarian of to-day. The search\r\nmust be specially eager for the privately issued volume, but however\r\nlimited the author intends his circulation to be, he is usually quite\r\npersuadable as far as a copy for the local collection goes. Local\r\nnewspapers, it is obvious, are material of cardinal value. Every one of\r\nthem must be collected, bound, and to some extent indexed. And similar\r\nif somewhat lesser value attaches to every periodical whatsoever--be it\r\nthe issue of a sect, school, institution, trader, party, club, or any\r\nother body--published in the town. It is a curious fact that few\r\nlibraries possess, for instance, sets of the various church magazines.\r\nThese are, usually, of course, made up of a London-published religious\r\nperiodical inset in sheets dealing with the particular church that\r\ndistributes them. The inset may be discarded, but the local part should\r\ncertainly be collected from every such periodical issued locally. Few\r\nrecords are more important than this.\r\n\r\nThe local collection must certainly include all local acts, bye-laws,\r\norders in Council that have a local bearing. It is remarkable how many\r\nof these there are for even supposedly insignificant areas.\r\n\r\nNovels and other imaginative literature, which have a local setting,\r\ncome clearly into the collection. It is a curious fact that the modern\r\nnovel of this character is frequently missed. It seems all the more\r\nimportant to collect it when we know that the average “selling life” of\r\na six-shilling novel is about six weeks, and its public life quite often\r\nnot much longer. Only the local library can--or ought--to save much of\r\nthis fiction and imaginative writing.\r\n\r\nReferences to the district in outside newspapers and periodicals should\r\nalways be kept. Even when they are founded on the material in the local\r\nnewspapers they are usually coloured by the outside view, or are in\r\nbetter perspective than the local writer can bring to bear upon whatever\r\nis under discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=428.= The basic records of a town, and, therefore, from the point of\r\nview of the local collection, its most important, are its written ones;\r\nand in these, generally speaking, libraries are most deficient, for the\r\nobvious reason that the ordinary municipal library is a newcomer, and\r\nthat in modern days the printed record has largely superseded the\r\nwritten one. Not altogether, however, as we shall see. Written records\r\nare almost of as many types as are the printed--there are parliamentary,\r\nmunicipal, parochial, private business and personal manuscripts, of\r\nwhich every librarian should strive to obtain possession. A copy of the\r\nDomesday Book for his area, albeit impossible, except by successful\r\nburglary of the Public Record Office, would be a desirable beginning to\r\nthe collection. After that, we may tabulate a list of the classes of\r\nwritten material which should be sought:\r\n\r\n  1. Parochial Records: Tithe Registers, Parish Registers, Rate Books.\r\n  2. Municipal Records: Rate Books, Assessment Registers, Minute Books.\r\n  3. Private business records: Leases, indentures, agreements.\r\n  4. Manuscripts, autographs, etc.\r\n\r\nParochial registers of all kinds, tax books, etc., were until\r\ncomparatively recent years kept in the charge of the Church. Modern\r\nvicars have, as a rule, little interest in them, and are often willing\r\nto hand them over to the public library. Such books have an obvious\r\nvalue in resolving the whereabouts, rateable value and occupants of\r\nvarious types of property; and very interesting questions may be settled\r\nby their means. The actual parish registers--of births, marriages and\r\ndeaths--are another matter, and the originals cannot, we believe, be\r\ntransferred to the library. In some cases the staffs of libraries have\r\nobtained permission to transcribe these verbatim, and have actually done\r\nso.[14] It is undoubtedly a useful work, but scarcely comes into the\r\nprovince of the librarian as such; his work is to collect existing\r\nmaterial, not to create material, although there are infrequent\r\nexceptions to the rule. In general we must wait until one of the\r\npublishing societies produces these registers, and in the meanwhile\r\nrefer inquirers to the Church. All we need to emphasize here is the fact\r\nthat for centuries the corporate life centred in the Church, and it is\r\nto the Church that we must look for our primary written records.\r\n\r\n  [14] At Walthamstow this was done by a member of the Libraries staff.\r\n\r\nWe reach somewhat surer ground when we endeavour to collect municipal\r\nrecords. The older municipalities--Coventry, Stratford-on-Avon,\r\netc.--have had some regard for their records, and have at least\r\npreserved them. Modern municipalities preserve them, too--that is to\r\nsay, theoretically. A visit to the basement or attics of the average\r\nmunicipal building is, however, a woeful experience for the collector.\r\nUsually, in cob-webbed chaos, he will find the records that in a century\r\n(or much less) will have immeasurable interest for the student of local\r\naffairs. There are written minutes as distinct from printed ones of\r\nmunicipal committees, rate, assessment, receipt, wages, work, and\r\nnumerous other books to be found in the confusion. It is not always easy\r\nto persuade the people concerned to hand over these books, and indeed\r\nthe more recent of them probably ought not to be handed over; but a\r\nlittle persuasive tact has in more than one case secured the right of\r\nthe librarian to take charge of and to classify and catalogue them.\r\nSometimes limitations are placed upon their use (for example, books of\r\nthe last ten years may not be exposed to general consultation), but in\r\nany case they ought to be secured for the collection if it is in any\r\nway possible. The records, it must be mentioned, are voluminous and\r\nbulky, and if in addition to the right of custody the municipality can\r\nbe induced to provide a room for their reception, the relief will\r\ngenerally be a welcome one.\r\n\r\nIn some ways the most attractive of written records, the most human, are\r\nthe private ones; and these are also the most difficult to obtain.\r\nLeases, wills, agreements, indentures, and similar deeds are naturally\r\nnot stored systematically anywhere in the average town, and they must be\r\nsearched out. Old inns are likely places, as are old solicitors’\r\noffices, and auctions sometimes bring them to light. There are, of\r\ncourse, dealers who specialize in them, and most desirable deeds have\r\nbeen obtained cheaply from London dealers. Such documents throw more\r\nlight on the changes, customs, and language of a locality than do any of\r\nthe more formal records mentioned above.\r\n\r\nLocal literary manuscripts, autographs, manuscripts of local authors,\r\nletters, and similar written documents are so obviously desirable that\r\nmore than a mention of them is superfluous; but we want, in this\r\nconnexion, to urge that to-day will very quickly belong to the past, and\r\nthat the collection of these things from the hands of living men is to\r\nbe desired. When a librarian receives a letter from the mayor, a\r\nprominent alderman, or similar local celebrity, he does not as a rule\r\nthink of it as something to be preserved in the local collection. Why\r\nnot?\r\n\r\n\r\n=429. Pictorial and Graphic Material.=--In recent years librarians have\r\ngiven systematic attention to the collection of pictorial records,\r\nalthough, indeed, they have long been recognized as a part of the\r\ncollector’s province. These naturally divide into:\r\n\r\n  1. Painted records.\r\n  2. Prints.\r\n  3. Photographs.\r\n  4. Maps.\r\n\r\n(We think we can extend the word “pictorial” to cover maps.) The\r\npresence of painted records may be questioned, but their value as\r\nrecords is undoubted, seeing that they give colour, atmosphere, and have\r\nother interpretative values which are absent from the more meticulously\r\naccurate photograph. Local prints and photographs should be collected\r\nwithout special regard to their artistic value; record is always the\r\nmotto of the collector, not beauty, however much we may desire it\r\npersonally. Care should be taken to secure photographs in a permanent\r\nprocess, but it is better to have them in the more evanescent processes,\r\nand to take special care of them, than not to have them at all. All\r\ngas-light photographic prints (with a distinct preference for\r\nplatinotype, bromide and velox papers in this descending order) are\r\npractically permanent; but the finest photographic paper extant will not\r\nendure direct sunlight everlastingly. The question of the treatment of\r\nprints and photographs generally, however, deserves separate treatment,\r\nand here we are concerned only with what should be collected. The\r\npictures, then, must represent distinctive things, interpretative of the\r\nlife of the district. Pictures of individual flowers, which grow\r\nanywhere, trees which are not peculiar to the place, “pretty bits” which\r\nmight be matched in any place in the kingdom, are of little or no value.\r\nOmitting these inessential things, practically everything else from the\r\nportrait of the Member of Parliament to that of the local amœba comes\r\nwithin the scope of the collection. The cheapest print from the cheapest\r\nperiodical need not be despised. It may serve its turn.\r\n\r\n\r\n=430.= Special endeavour should be made to secure a complete set of the\r\nmaps of the region covered. In spite of the conventionality and\r\ninaccuracy of many early maps they are our original source of\r\ninformation on many points vital to the collection. For some counties\r\nthe maps have been scheduled with exemplary thoroughness, and by basing\r\nhis collection on one of these schedules the collector will be helped\r\ngreatly, seeing that the old cartographers usually worked on several\r\ncounties, and the map bibliography of Yorkshire, for example, may be\r\nexpected to furnish useful clues to the maps of Kent. Old gazetteers,\r\ntopographies, histories, encyclopædias and periodicals of general scope\r\noften contain maps, and the least prepossessing of such works should be\r\nconsulted in order to obtain them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=431.= Engraved records are fewer than any previously mentioned. They\r\ninclude local seals, crests, coins and tokens, and similar articles.\r\nTokens, it may not be generally known, were coins, usually having the\r\nvalues of a farthing, a halfpenny, and a penny, which local traders were\r\npermitted to issue to supply the scarcity of a small coinage from the\r\nnational treasury. These were issued mainly from the sixteenth to the\r\neighteenth centuries and generally had a local exchange value only,\r\nalthough a number were accepted in many counties. Clearly these tokens,\r\nwhich often carry the trade marks, signs, etc., of the trader issuing\r\nthem, are a valuable and interesting part of local material. The\r\nCoventry Public Libraries possess what we believe to be an unique\r\ncollection of tokens relating to that city. Various local medals should\r\nalso be sought.\r\n\r\n\r\n=432. Sources of Supply.=--There is something trite and unoriginal in\r\nthe discussion of the methods of obtaining books for the local\r\ncollection, but perhaps something useful may emerge from a\r\nrecapitulation of the principal ones. So far as the municipal library is\r\nconcerned, the common method must be by purchase, although much will be\r\nsecured from private generosity when the collection has become known. It\r\nis important, in our opinion, not to leave the collection unmentioned in\r\nthe annual estimates; a definite appropriation should be made for it,\r\nthe amount of which will of course depend upon the resources of the\r\nlibrary and upon the area covered. We have found at Croydon, where the\r\ncollection covers extra-metropolitan Surrey, that much may be done on an\r\nappropriation of £35 a year. This need not be spent entirely upon the\r\ncollection, nor should the collecting be limited to the purchasing power\r\nof this sum, but it seems to be very desirable to have money so\r\near-marked in order that attention may be focussed upon the collection\r\nas an important part of the activities of the library.\r\n\r\nIt is also essential, if the collection is to be successful, that the\r\nlibrarian should have discretionary power in the spending of the\r\nappropriation. Local literature disappears with a rapidity that is\r\nsometimes astonishing, and keen collectors on making discoveries in the\r\ncatalogues of booksellers and dealers, usually secure the coveted books\r\nby telephone or telegram. The library would be a greatly handicapped\r\ncompetitor if the sanction of the libraries committee had to be awaited\r\nbefore purchases could be made. In some towns the discretionary power is\r\nvested in the chairman, and where he is immediately accessible to the\r\nlibrarian there are distinct advantages in this method, especially if he\r\nis sympathetic. It is a good axiom for the librarian to avoid\r\nresponsibilities which can judiciously be distributed!\r\n\r\nA certain amount of judicious advertisement of the needs of the library\r\nis desirable in this matter. Care should be taken that a note to the\r\neffect that local material is purchased should appear in Clegg’s\r\n_Directory of Booksellers_, and in other similar publications. On the\r\nnotepaper of the library some such note as the following might be given\r\nin small type: “The librarian will be glad to hear of written or printed\r\nmaterial relating to Selsey, either as a gift or for purchase.” This is\r\nespecially useful, as the notepaper circulates mostly in the district\r\nitself, where much literature may be hidden, unvalued and neglected,\r\nwhich its owners would willingly add to the collection. With the\r\ndirectory entry before him the bookseller will generally report\r\nindividual items, but in any case he will send his catalogues, and these\r\nmust be perused diligently. As a rule the bookseller is sufficiently\r\nmaster of his business to enter likely material, under county and town\r\nheadings, but not infrequently books which have a local appeal appear in\r\nother parts of the catalogue. In this work the librarian will naturally\r\nand wisely make use of his whole staff, and every inducement should be\r\nheld out to assistants to help in the discovering of local material and\r\nto make suggestions for the extension of the collection. Generally,\r\nhowever, little inducement will be needed, as library workers as a whole\r\nare both keenly interested in and proud of the local collection.\r\n\r\nOther sources of supply may be dealt with briefly. Donations will\r\naccount for many of the most curious and useful, and these are best\r\ninduced by exhibitions of material from the collection, by references\r\nmade to the collection in books in the lending library (a slip can be\r\ninserted in all topographical books, for example, calling attention to\r\nthe existence and scope of the collection), and by paragraphs, articles,\r\netc., built up from local material, which may appear in the public\r\npress, and which the local press is only too glad to publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n=433. Photographic Surveys.=--The current pictorial records, the\r\nphotographs, can usually be obtained, by the expense of much energy and\r\nlittle money, through a Photographic Survey Society. As this matter has\r\njust lately received systematic and authoritative treatment,[15] it is\r\nunnecessary here to enlarge upon it further than to say that a\r\nphotographic survey society is usually a band of photographers,\r\nprofessional and (mainly) amateur, who make photographic records in a\r\nsystematic manner of a particular district, its history, antiquities,\r\nnatural features, architecture, industries, current activities, and, in\r\nfact, everything that presents or interprets its life. Such societies\r\nare increasing in number, and have a social side in the shape of\r\nphotographic excursions, reunions, etc., which make them rather more\r\nthan gatherings where the cacophanous jargon of the dark-room pervades\r\neverything; hence they band together many people who are interested in a\r\ndistrict and the preservation of its memories. As a rule the whole of\r\nthe work of the survey, except the cataloguing and classifying--which\r\nare the business of the librarian--is done by members of the survey. The\r\nlibrary usually supplies mounts, storage and cataloguing requisites.\r\n\r\n  [15] Gower, H. D., Jast, L. S., and Topley, W. W. _The Camera as\r\n       Historian: A Handbook to Photographic Record Work._ 1916. Sampson\r\n       Low.\r\n\r\n\r\n=434. Regional Surveys.=--Similarly, but more recently, regional (or\r\ncivic) survey societies have come into existence, which parcel out\r\ncertain local areas, and study everything in them, from their geology to\r\nthe last manifestations of the human intellect working in them, and\r\nrecord the results on maps.[16] Thus maps of the local strata,\r\nwater-bearing beds, flora, rainfall, industries, old inns, milestones,\r\nboundary marks, and so on, have been made for the circle of twenty\r\nmiles, centering in Croydon. This is a new form of work of the utmost\r\nvalue for providing data of current utility, and for preserving the\r\nrecord of local features. Such societies are already recognizing that\r\nthe municipal reference library is the natural storing-place of such\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n  [16] See _Library World_, vol. xix., pp. 32-34.\r\n\r\n\r\n=435. Cost.=--Naturally the most important factor in collecting is the\r\nprice of the material collected. This, not remarkably, often gives us\r\nconsiderable pause, as the present-day cost of local literature does not\r\nseem to bear any relation to its original cost; and to appraise the\r\nvalue of manuscript material, deeds and similar matter, is almost\r\nimpossible. Scarcity and competition are the two factors in creating\r\nprices. In local literature the demand can be controlled if librarians\r\ndo not traverse other fields than their own district in making their\r\ncollection. A little consultation with brother librarians should bring\r\nabout a workable division of any given county, with the result that the\r\nindividual collection would be satisfactory, and the duplication of\r\neffort and expense would be avoided. Only the very large towns should\r\nattempt county collections. Moreover, this avoidance of competition\r\nwould lessen the demand for the same book, and so help to bring down its\r\nmarket value. The competitor who can completely out-distance the average\r\nlibrary is the keen private collector with a generous purse and\r\nunlimited leisure. In his case the librarian can only hope that his will\r\ncontains a clause in which his collection and the library are in happy\r\njuxtaposition. With relation to actual buying, it is a good axiom never\r\nto purchase anything except “on approval.” It is really wonderful how\r\nattractive a commonplace and almost valueless item can appear to be in\r\nan agent’s catalogue. In few cases this “sending on approval” is refused\r\nby booksellers, but the majority are only too glad to do it, especially\r\nif the prospective purchaser undertakes to pay postage both ways in the\r\nevent of rejecting the material. By this means large bundles of stuff\r\nwhich have only a nucleus of useful matter can be weeded out, and the\r\nprice arranged according to the result. This is particularly desirable\r\nwhen dealing with deeds, which often prove to be incomplete, or of far\r\nless interest than (say) the entry, “Forty Surrey Deeds, 1542-1816,”\r\nwould imply. One does not suppose that dealers in these things are one\r\nwhit less honest than other men, but their prices are often in the\r\nregion of the absurd. If the collector has reason to think that this is\r\nso, he should make a reasonable offer for the books he wants, and it\r\nwill generally be found that the bookseller is amenable to this sort of\r\nargument. Naturally we are speaking of the general items for the\r\ncollection. In every district individual items have a definite high\r\nvalue which cannot be reduced, and it is the lot of most local\r\ncollectors to be compelled regretfully to pass by, as beyond their\r\nmeans, many things that they would gladly possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n=436. Mounting of Prints, etc.=--It remains to devote some attention to\r\nthe mounting, cataloguing and storage of material. Books and pamphlets\r\nare treated as in the general library, as are broadsides, cuttings and\r\nsimilar separate material. The photograph may be treated in various\r\nways. At Birmingham, for example, the prints are mounted, and stored in\r\nwhat are virtually loose-leaf albums, which permit perfect\r\nclassification and the insertion of any new photograph without\r\ndislocation. The more usual method is to mount the photographs on a\r\nuniform size mount--17 in. by 13½ in. for large prints, and 12½ in. by\r\n10½ in. for smaller (and the great majority of) prints have been found\r\nsatisfactory. Nature papers of double strength have been used, and every\r\neffort should be made to secure an acid-free paper. When it is obtained\r\nthe prints should be fixed by the dry-mounting process, if possible;\r\nnearly all adhesives have injurious chemical action upon photographic\r\npapers. The mounted prints and photographs are stored in boxes such as\r\nthat shown in Fig. 118, or in the drawers of a vertical file.\r\n\r\n\r\n=437. Classification.=--The classification of the local collection\r\ndemands a much closer arrangement than any general scheme provides. Up\r\nto the present most librarians have constructed one for their own use;\r\nand there are two methods. One, and that most readily used, is a\r\ntopographical arrangement with a subject sub-arrangement; the other is\r\nthe converse--a subject arrangement with topographical sub-division. The\r\nchoice may be determined by the answer the reader gives to the question:\r\nWhich are users more likely to want--\r\n\r\n  1. The churches of a county or town as a whole? or\r\n  2. Material, including the church, relating to a town (in a county) or\r\n  parish or ward (in a town)?\r\n\r\nThe topographical arrangement of (say) a county survey is usually\r\nsecured by adding to the subject number the number of the square on the\r\nkey Ordnance Survey map of the county. That is, when the main\r\narrangement is subjectival. When it is topographical the ordnance number\r\nprecedes the subject number. A detailed example of the working of a\r\nlocal collection classification is given in Gower, Jast and Topley’s\r\n_The Camera as Historian_.\r\n\r\nEvery mount should bear upon it a label showing particulars of the\r\nsubject, number, photographer, process, date, etc. This goes well into\r\nthe left-top corner. The example given is that of the Surrey\r\nPhotographic Survey. A similar label with the necessary adaptations is\r\nadvisable on all prints which are not the property of such Surveys.

Cataloguing.=--The cataloguing of the local collection should, of\r\ncourse, follow the code in general use; but certain amplifications are\r\ndesirable. The size, pagination, date of publication, town of\r\npublication, and the names both of printer and publisher (if they are\r\ndifferent) should be given. Omissions from titles should be as\r\ninfrequent as possible, and when made should be indicated. The object is\r\nto make this catalogue as fully bibliographical as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=439.= The cataloguing of prints is a fairly simple matter if treated in\r\ncommon-sense fashion. Inquirers only occasionally require the works of\r\nartist or photographer in connexion with such prints as are stocked by\r\nlibraries. A subject-index appears to be the best form, with a local\r\nindex; thus\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+\r\n  |                             |\r\n  | GOLF COURSE, REIGATE. 263.5 |\r\n  |                             |\r\n  +-----------------------------+\r\n                 1\r\n  +-----------------------------+\r\n  |                             |\r\n  | REIGATE.

All the detail\r\nbeyond that can be found on the prints, which themselves are in their\r\narrangement a classified catalogue. Of course special prints would go\r\nunder the artists’ names, or under their titles if their value warranted\r\nthat course. Usually it does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n=440. Maps.=--It is appropriate to deal with maps here, as the largest\r\nnumber of maps will probably be local ones. The classification methods\r\nsuggested for prints apply to maps as well; that is to say, the\r\npredominating arrangement should be topographical, and the\r\nsub-arrangement subjectival, and the ultimate arrangement may be\r\nchronological. Thus a map of the geology of a particular town would\r\narrange--\r\n\r\n  Class No. of Town.  |  Geology No.  |  Date.\r\n\r\n\r\n=441.= The cataloguing of maps may follow the Anglo-American rule, which\r\nruns:\r\n\r\n  Enter maps under the cartographer. If the name of the cartographer is\r\n  not found, enter under the publisher; thus:\r\n\r\n  GREGORY, C. C. M’Millan’s map of New Brunswick. Drawn by C. C.\r\n  Gregory. Scale of statute miles _ca._ 8 to the inch.\r\n\r\n  JOHNSTON, W. _and_ A. K., _pub._ Johnston’s commercial and library\r\n  chart of the world on Mercator’s projection.\r\n\r\nThis simple rule needs some amplification for a large collection of\r\nmaps; and the following simple rules have been found to be satisfactory:\r\n\r\n  1. The _Arrangement_ of entries is in chronological order, and where\r\n  two entries occur under one date they are arranged alphabetically by\r\n  the _heading_.\r\n\r\n  2. _The Name adopted for Heading_ is that of the cartographer where\r\n  found; where the cartographer is not found, the publisher, or\r\n  engraver, or title (in this order) forms the entry word.\r\n\r\n  3. The unit of _Scale_ wherever possible should be the inch.\r\n\r\n  4. Give the _Size_, measured from one inner margin to another,\r\n  vertical measurements first, to the nearest quarter-inch below the\r\n  actual size.\r\n\r\n  5. The _Date_ of arrangement is that printed on the map; but modern\r\n  maps illustrating places at a past period in history arrange under the\r\n  period, the publication date being added to the entry merely as\r\n  information. Undated maps from atlases or other works take the date of\r\n  the work in which they appear.\r\n\r\nAll catalogues so arranged require topographical and subject indexes.\r\n\r\nThe filing of maps was dealt with in the chapter on Filing and Indexing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=442. Deeds.=--Deeds are difficult to handle and store because of their\r\nshape and size, the seals attached to them, and for other reasons. For\r\nordinary purposes flat filing in boxes similar to those used for maps\r\nwill serve. The cataloguing of deeds has been variously done, but for\r\nlocal purposes a topographical arrangement, with a chronological\r\nsub-arrangement, is recommended. Examples of typical entries may be\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n  =Bagshot.=\r\n\r\n  1715 21 June (i. George I.). LEASE OF COTTAGE AND LAND. BAGSHOT.

General.=--It is appropriate to devote a brief space to the\r\nconsideration of reference libraries of municipal material, because the\r\nLibrary Association has affirmed the desirability of such libraries;\r\nalthough, so far as this country is concerned, the matter is in the\r\nprospective stage rather than that of accomplishment. In various\r\nCanadian and American cities such libraries exist and have proved their\r\nutility.\r\n\r\nMunicipal history would probably furnish many examples of independent\r\nattempts to solve similar local government and administrative problems,\r\nall conducted without that reference to one another which is implied in\r\norganization, and without full profit being derived from the successes\r\nor failures of former workers. It is true that before carrying out\r\nschemes appeal is made by municipalities to their official experts; but\r\nthe experience of the latter, however wide, is usually circumscribed,\r\nand they can add to it only by personal visits to and correspondence\r\nwith, similar experts. This limited knowledge, and the expenditure of\r\ntime and money, could be avoided by any municipality which possessed an\r\norganized library of reference material.\r\n\r\nIt is, as we have shown, the business of every library to preserve in\r\nits local collection all publications of the authority to whom it\r\nbelongs. The value of this limited work is obvious, but it does not\r\nnecessarily demand a special department. When, however, an attempt is\r\nmade to collect every kind of material, manuscript, printed, pictorial\r\nand statistical, which is likely to throw light on problems of local\r\nadministration, including the municipal literature issued by other\r\nauthorities, the task becomes so large that a separate and\r\nself-contained department must be devoted to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=446.= In almost every municipal office there is to be found a smaller\r\nor larger collection of the more obvious technical books for the\r\nreference use of its staff. Such books are treatises on engineering\r\ndetails, accountancy, and the Town Clerk has usually a small collection\r\nof acts, manuals, and other literature bearing upon municipal law. The\r\ncollections are rarely if ever large enough to possess a representative\r\nand co-ordinate character, nor are they easily available for the whole\r\nof the staff of the local authority or for members of the town council\r\nand the public. There is a certain wastefulness in this method of\r\nproviding books. One or two of the greater towns have more general\r\nmunicipal collections; Glasgow is an example; but there is no town in\r\nthe United Kingdom which possesses a systematically arranged and\r\nprofessionally administered municipal library, or bureau of municipal\r\nresearch, if the term is preferred. Yet many things may be urged in\r\nfavour of such a department. It would be an infinite advantage to any\r\ninquirer, whether an official or a member of the public, to be able to\r\ngo to a specially constituted department and to study what has been the\r\ngeneral experience of any question or scheme under consideration or in\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits presumed the field of the municipal reference is a\r\nwide one. It would collect all books of an authoritative nature on local\r\ngovernment, and every available municipal document, from the minutes of\r\nthe local council to the small paragraph from the newspaper which would\r\nshed light on municipal administration. It is definitely bibliographical\r\nwork and should be placed under the control of the libraries committee;\r\nmoreover, it is expert work, and can only be conducted satisfactorily by\r\na man or woman who has been trained in the collection, classification,\r\nfiling, and particularly the minute cataloguing and indexing of literary\r\nmaterial; in short, to be effective, it must be placed in the care of a\r\nprofessional librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n=447.= Such a library would demand fairly generous accommodation if it\r\nis to contain the material indicated, and would require a proper staff;\r\nit would cost money. Here, perhaps, we have the crucial factor in the\r\nsituation, because it is difficult to convince the average municipal\r\ngovernor that books can bear a part in the solution of municipal\r\nproblems. It is obvious that such a department cannot be supported out\r\nof the present resources of library committees--in fact, it is most\r\nundesirable, even if it is legal, that the cost should fall upon the\r\nlibrary rate. It is special work to assist the government of a town, and\r\nshould be paid for by the governing authority as a whole and quite apart\r\nfrom ordinary library funds. In Milwaukee, where the Public Library\r\nadministers such a department, the city makes an annual appropriation of\r\nfive thousand dollars from the general city fund to be added to the\r\nlibrary’s revenue, and used only for municipal reference purposes. One\r\nthousand pounds a year would possibly seem an excessive amount to the\r\naverage town council, but when it is remembered that such a library, by\r\nthe information it would afford, might save many more thousands of\r\npounds, the investment would seem to be an eminently satisfactory one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=448.= America has anticipated us in this, as in many other library\r\nmatters, and such libraries of this character as she possesses have\r\nproved to be quite successful. A large volume has already been devoted\r\nby Mr J. B. Kaiser to the discussion of the practical methods in vogue\r\nin this and collateral libraries. There, as here, stress is laid upon\r\nthe economy resulting from such work. It prevents the adoption of\r\nill-considered municipal schemes, or schemes which it shows to have been\r\na failure elsewhere. It provides examples of the successes of other\r\ntowns, and, therefore, gives the possessing town the best models upon\r\nwhich to frame its own work. It is insisted, too, that this is work for\r\nthe librarian, and that it is useless to spend money upon the provision\r\nof material and to place it in the charge of people who are not\r\nspecially equipped by education, experience, and technical training to\r\nunderstand and focus the information contained in the library. What is\r\nnot so vital in America, because of the _comparative_ wealth of\r\nlibraries there (few of them are really over-financed), is the fact that\r\nwhile this may form an important branch of the public library, it must\r\nhave a separate revenue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=449.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Kaiser, J.

General.=--The most recent development of library works which has\r\njustified itself in practice has for its aim the provision of\r\ninformation useful to commercial and business men. It is comparatively\r\nnew to this country but has been in vogue in America for some years\r\npast, in particular in the Commercial Museum at Philadelphia, which is a\r\nseparate, self-contained institution. In Great Britain commercial\r\nlibraries have been established as part of the public library system at\r\nGlasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham, Leeds and\r\nelsewhere. The names of these towns indicate an important fact. Separate\r\ncomprehensive commercial libraries are expensive institutions, and are\r\nonly justified where a large demand for their services may be expected.\r\nSmaller libraries may indeed have commercial departments in connexion\r\nwith their reference departments, but it is wiser to limit their stock\r\nand work to the definitely local trades than to attempt a general\r\ncommercial service entirely beyond their means and probable needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=451. The Commercial Department.=--As distinct from the general\r\ncommercial library as established in the great towns we have named, the\r\ncommercial section in an ordinary library is a development of the\r\nInformation Desk. It specializes in local industries and trade, and on\r\nthat subject collects every form of printed and graphic material, the\r\nstandard text-books and works of reference, directories, year-books,\r\ncodes, reports and periodicals. These are classified and indexed\r\nminutely, and are so disposed that ordinary questions which a business\r\nman may be expected to ask can be answered as rapidly as possible. It is\r\nwhat the Americans call “quick-fire reference work,” in which immediacy\r\nof need and of its satisfaction are the prime requisites. We do not wish\r\nto set limitations to any branch of library service, and if a librarian\r\ncan, without loss or inconvenience in other directions, include further\r\nfeatures from those described in the following sections, he should\r\ncertainly consider himself at liberty to do so; but this will rarely be\r\nthe case. The separate, highly-developed commercial library is\r\ndistinctly a work for the some half-dozen British cities which are\r\ncentres of great commercial and industrial populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=452. The Commercial Library.=--The need has long been felt in this\r\ncountry for rapid access to current and standard commercial\r\nintelligence, although it has not always been realized, and the need has\r\nbeen accentuated by the Great War, which has made Great Britain more\r\nthan ever a competitor in the world-struggle. The Board of Trade has\r\nestablished an intelligence department in London, and chambers of\r\ncommerce exist in most towns which have intelligence-work as part of\r\ntheir reason for existence; but London is too far away for the\r\nprovincial man of business who wants immediate information, and the\r\nchambers of commerce do not embrace in their membership more than a part\r\nof the business community. Hence the desirability of fully-equipped,\r\nskilfully-administered libraries.\r\n\r\nAt Glasgow, Liverpool and elsewhere the commercial library is housed in\r\na commodious, appropriate department as near to the business centre of\r\nthe city as possible. It is administered by the library authority, and\r\nis in the immediate charge of a librarian skilled in classification,\r\nfiling and indexing, and the use of works of reference. The stock of the\r\nlibrary has been defined by Mr S. A. Pitt, the chief librarian of\r\nGlasgow, as standard and current; the standard consisting of treatises,\r\nencyclopædic works, code books, Government reports, Parliamentary\r\npapers, and works on commercial law and business method; the current of\r\nall kinds of fugitive papers and material of great temporary, but\r\nprobably very transient, interest, such as notices, reports, pamphlets,\r\nleaflets, news-cuttings, catalogues and price-lists. To the standard\r\nwould be added directories of every trade, industry and profession, and\r\nof every country, county and important town; atlases, maps, charts and\r\nsimilar material would form an important part of the collection; and,\r\nperhaps most important of all, every financial journal, trade\r\nperiodical, etc., in English, with a liberal supply of those in other\r\nlanguages. The consular reports, and other Government publications,\r\nincluding those of the Patent Office and other technical departments of\r\nthe Crown, should be included. Some of these can be obtained as a free\r\ngrant; many of them, strange to say, can only be obtained by purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n=453.= The methodology of such a library resembles that of the ordinary\r\nreference library, with special emphasis on minute filing and indexing.\r\nAs much of the current information as possible should be on cards or in\r\nvertical files in the most concise form; the business man has no time to\r\nread lengthy material, nor can he afford to wait for it while the\r\ncommercial librarian slowly produces it--that is, as a rule; there are\r\ntimes when a question demands a reference to London or to some other\r\nplace, which involves delay; but in the ordinary course, a quotation,\r\naddress, character of a firm, route, code, or some such information, is\r\nwanted, and it should be forthcoming on the instant. The card index and\r\nvertical file, and experience in the needs of readers, should eventually\r\nlead to effective service. Much of the work is done by telephone, and a\r\ncomplete telephone equipment is an essential of the library. The whole\r\nresources of the general library system of the town are also at the\r\ndisposal of the user of the commercial library. The library also keeps\r\nrecords of the specialities of the various manufacturers, traders, etc.,\r\nof the town, of changes in their scope, management, and so forth; and an\r\nindex of translators, typing firms and others required at times by\r\nbusiness people. It must revise its material regularly and\r\nsystematically so that it may always be the latest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=454.= To secure the best results co-operation with exchanges and\r\nchambers of commerce is desirable; and in many places this seems to have\r\nbeen forthcoming.

Campbell states that the\r\ncommercial libraries, as projected by librarians, “are to meet the wants\r\nof the smaller commercial man, the tradesman, the man who pushes his\r\nway, the men who have risen from nothing”; the others, presumably, are\r\nprovided for by the exchange and the chamber of commerce. At Manchester,\r\nhowever, the commercial library is actually in the Royal Exchange, and\r\nother cities have made their present progress through the co-operation\r\nof the representative organizations of commercial men. Unless this is\r\nforthcoming there seems not very much chance of success. It may be that\r\nthe commercial library, as now initiated by librarians, will in course\r\nof time become the nucleus of a commercial institution or bureau in\r\nwhich the branches of the Board of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce, and\r\nthe various Consuls may be housed, controlled in its operations by an\r\nexpert paid a very high salary, who shall be for the district a sort of\r\nMinister of Commerce capable of guiding the commercial people. But that\r\nis in the region of speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=455. Technical Libraries.=--While the commercial library furnishes\r\ninformation for the buyer and seller of commodities, the technical\r\nlibrary is concerned with information for the manufacturer and\r\noperative; the question is therefore closely related to the question of\r\ncommercial libraries, and in some districts is the more important. In\r\nlarge American libraries there is usually a separate department of the\r\nreference library devoted to technology, but in this country the supply\r\nof such books as this department would afford has been inadequate.\r\nLately considerable attention has been devoted to technical libraries,\r\nand we may summarize a few of the results and recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n=456. Local Industries.=--It is clear that municipal libraries have a\r\nspecial interest in providing all literature possible on local\r\nindustries; text-books of the various trades, periodicals, patent\r\npublications, reports, catalogues and similar matter should be collected\r\nassiduously. This does not mean that every trade represented in the town\r\nneed be treated in an exhaustive manner, but the leading industries, by\r\nwhich numbers of the townsfolk live, certainly should be. Examples of\r\nsuch collections are those on engineering at Coventry, furniture at\r\nShoreditch, clocks and clock-making at Finsbury, coal-mining at Wigan,\r\nand the leather trades at Northampton. Some of these, however, are\r\nconfined to books, in many cases perforce for lack of funds and personal\r\nservice; but the ideal, too often unrealized, is a collection of\r\nmaterial of all kinds of which books form only a part. Local means and\r\nopportunities must determine how far any library can carry such a\r\ncollection--usually, at present, not very far; but as many works of\r\nrecognized value on the predominant industries should certainly be\r\nstocked.\r\n\r\n\r\n=457. Technical Collections Generally.=--Hitherto it has been the\r\nprovince of the municipal library to supply general works in\r\ntechnology, and the special libraries of individual industries have been\r\nprovided by the industry. This, in the view of the Ministry of\r\nReconstruction’s Adult Education Committee (Third Interim Report,\r\n_Libraries and Museums_, 1919, Cd. 9237), should be the prevailing\r\nmethod of the future. It is obvious that few public libraries can supply\r\nexpensive treatises on technical questions in which their own district\r\nis not directly interested; even with a greatly increased library rate\r\nthey could not do so in any large measure. The greater cities may\r\nperhaps acquire these books, but they could not supply more than one or\r\ntwo copies. Too limited a view should not be taken in great towns,\r\nbecause co-ordination and co-operation such as are implied in the\r\nJoint-Technical Catalogues published at Glasgow bring the whole\r\nresources of a wide area to a focus. In ordinary towns the present aim\r\nshould be to obtain the largest possible number of general and special\r\nworks in science and applied science, and to leave the supply of the\r\nmore expensive, recondite, and valuable but rarely used treatises to a\r\ncentral reservoir library, which may be developed out of the Central\r\nLending Library for Students, perhaps with the aid of the special\r\nlibraries of the various institutions which represent trades and\r\nprofessions. The main aim of the Library Association is to have a\r\ncentral reservoir library established in London from which all libraries\r\nmay draw important little-used books; and the Ministry of\r\nReconstruction’s Committee adopt this idea as the basis of their scheme\r\nfor the co-ordination and re-organization of libraries.\r\n\r\nIn building up technical collections a library benefits greatly by\r\nexpert assistance; but the advice of several, and not one only, is very\r\ndesirable, since experts rarely agree on minute questions of books, and\r\neach of any two experts cancels the idiosyncrasies of the other. But\r\nexperts can usually be found from neighbouring universities, or big\r\nindustrial concerns, who will give the library the benefit of their\r\nknowledge, especially in assessing the value of older books. No section\r\nof the library needs revision so frequently as the technical, unless it\r\nbe the commercial. This is more especially likely to be the case in\r\nthese next few years after the War, when all industrial advances made\r\nfrom 1914 onwards will probably be recorded, to the superseding of many\r\nprevious books.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=458.

Newsrooms.=--The chief difference which exists in the composition\r\nof British and American libraries is the frequent absence from the\r\nlatter of general reading rooms in which the principal newspapers are\r\ndisplayed for public use. The newsroom has never been generally\r\nrecognized in the United States as a necessary department of a public\r\nlibrary, and, save in a few exceptional cases, these rooms are not to be\r\nfound in the average American public library. The nearest approach to\r\nthe British newsroom in America is the large magazine reading room, in\r\nwhich all kinds of weekly and monthly periodicals are displayed. This is\r\nsubstantially the same as a newsroom, but without the current numbers of\r\ndaily newspapers. There are reasons why the Americans do not encourage\r\nnewsrooms, and one is the enormous number of newspapers which exist in\r\nevery large town. The display of a representative selection of\r\nnewspapers and the cost of maintaining the department would occupy a\r\nlarge space, and the funds would be spent to a considerable extent in\r\nproviding one of the least healthy forms of literature. But perhaps the\r\nreal reason for the American indifference to the newsroom is the\r\nsensational and vulgar tone of a considerable portion of the newspaper\r\npress. Some American newspapers are free from such undesirable and\r\nobjectionable features as sensational and untrue comments on current\r\nevents, vulgar personalities, exaggeration and misrepresentation,\r\nobjectionable and dangerous advertisements, and a very low level of\r\nliterary merit, but many are not. The best fugitive work of American\r\nwriters of any importance is to be found in the magazines and literary\r\nweeklies, which offer a marked contrast in every respect, save perhaps\r\nas regards advertisements, to the somewhat debased character of many\r\nAmerican daily newspapers. These are all reasons why newsrooms on the\r\nBritish plan are not quite desirable in American libraries, and they\r\napply to a large extent to the altered conditions of recent British\r\njournalism. Time was when the average British newspaper represented a\r\nhigh standard of accuracy, fairness and literary ability, but since the\r\nimportation of many doubtful American methods, the character of the\r\npress has to a large measure degenerated. Moreover, few British\r\nnewspapers are independent of political or corporation control, although\r\nexceptions exist, and impartial reports of and comments upon news are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\n\r\n=461.= The stock arguments in favour of newspapers are reasonable, and\r\nhave a strong element of truth in them. They attract a class of reader\r\nwho would not otherwise come to the library at all, and satisfy the\r\nliterary aspirations of some ratepayers who might receive otherwise no\r\ndirect return for their rates. The presence of literary, technical and\r\ncommercial periodicals in the newsroom is also said to attract a large\r\nnumber of interested readers, and no doubt it does; but this result\r\nmight be achieved independently of the newspaper element. Newspaper\r\nreaders are often a class apart; they rarely read anything else. _Real_\r\nnewspaper readers are comparatively few, and besides those who come for\r\nthe weekly periodicals, the newsroom attracts loafers, sporting men and\r\nall kinds of hopeless individuals, to whom the comparative comfort of\r\nthe newsroom is an attraction. Mr George Gissing, in one of his\r\nsketches, has drawn an exaggerated picture of such a newsroom haunter,\r\nwho suffers from a kind of neurosis which drags him irresistibly to a\r\npublic newsroom, there to indulge his morbid olfactory sense. The main\r\nargument in favour of newsrooms is that they present representative\r\njournals of every shade of opinion, and give the opportunity which is\r\nbadly needed of comparative reading. But it is a department which some\r\nlibrarians think costs rather more than is justified by its actual\r\nvalue. When the annual charges for periodicals, fittings, lighting,\r\nheating, oversight and proportion of loan are all added together, it\r\nwill be found that a newsroom costs a very considerable amount, which\r\ncould be applied to more permanent advantage in a reference or lending\r\nlibrary. The smaller the library the greater is the proportionate cost,\r\nand committees may seriously consider the question of limitation in\r\npublic newsrooms, at any rate so far as daily newspapers are concerned.\r\nIt is clearly a department where continual supervision is necessary,\r\nwhere it is most difficult to enforce discipline, and one that gives\r\nrise to continual public criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=462.= A few years ago the practice of _blacking out_ the betting news\r\nwas adopted in some newsrooms, as an experimental device to discourage\r\nthe sporting element, which in some towns used to obstruct the greater\r\npart of the newsrooms. This is mentioned, not as an example to be\r\nfollowed, but as showing the shifts some library authorities have been\r\ndriven to in order to prevent abuses. This practice of obliteration is\r\nnow rare. Another suggestion for coping with the betting fraternity is\r\nto cease buying or displaying the evening papers, or to procure them so\r\nlate as to make them useless for the purposes of the sporting element,\r\nwhile not in any way penalizing the reader who comes after 7 p.m. As a\r\nfurther suggestion for limiting the cost and obstructions of most\r\nnewsrooms in large towns, it has been proposed (1) that only the morning\r\ndaily papers be bought, for the benefit of the unemployed; (2) that the\r\n“Situations Vacant” columns only be displayed from 7 or 8 till 11 a.m.;\r\n(3) that the whole of them be removed at 11 o’clock, and their places\r\noccupied by maps, charts, pictures of current topics, or other similar\r\nbroadside matter likely to interest and instruct.\r\n\r\n\r\n=463.= In this way a newsroom might be greatly improved, and the\r\ncharacter of its work changed, without interfering with the use of the\r\nillustrated periodicals, technical journals and trade papers displayed\r\non the tables. By utilizing the wall space only for newspapers, good\r\noversight is obtained and a certain amount of limitation is forced upon\r\nthe authority by mechanical means. In arranging newspapers on the\r\nstands, care should be taken to separate the popular journals by a few\r\nless popular ones, so as to avoid continuous crowding at one or two\r\npoints. The people who read newspapers should be distributed round the\r\nwalls as thinly as possible, and this can only be effected by spreading\r\nthe papers all round the available area.\r\n\r\n\r\n=464.= In selecting newspapers for a newsroom great care should be taken\r\nto represent all political parties, and at the same time to avoid as far\r\nas may be the sensational element. All local papers should be taken, if\r\nnot for display at least for permanent preservation. The leading London\r\nand provincial dailies should be taken, and a representative daily from\r\nScotland and Ireland, and the leading foreign newspapers in French and\r\nGerman at least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--Double Newspaper Stand, Chelsea (Section\r\n466).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=465.= Newspapers are best displayed upon wall stands where possible, as\r\nmore oversight can be obtained, and the economy over standard slopes,\r\nwith papers on both sides, is undeniable. A newsroom fitted with\r\nnewspaper stands at right angles to the walls, and covering most of the\r\nfloor space, presents a somewhat crowded and obstructed appearance, and\r\nit is impossible for the staff to thoroughly overlook it easily. Apart\r\nfrom this a newsroom gains much in appearance, spaciousness and airiness\r\nwhen the newspapers are relegated to the walls, well out of the way. The\r\nweekly journals can be kept very conveniently on tables, as shown in\r\nSections 162-65, and it is sometimes found advantageous to secure them\r\nby means of cords or chains as described in Section 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n=466. Newspaper Stands.=--The present conditions of printing and\r\nproduction seem to make the broadside style of newspaper a necessity in\r\nall countries, and till some radical change in machinery is introduced\r\nwhich will permit newspapers in pamphlet or small quarto form to be\r\nproduced rapidly, large stands for the display of newspapers will have\r\nto be provided. Standard newspaper slopes either at right angles to\r\nwalls or distributed over the floor of a newsroom are not recommended,\r\nfor the reasons already given and because their cost is much greater.\r\nThey are necessary, however, in some cases, owing to considerations of\r\nlight and convenience, and the form and dimensions indicated will be\r\nfound useful (Figs. 165 and 166).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--Double Newspaper Stand (Section 466).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--Wall Newspaper Stand (Section 467).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=467.= Apart from the fact that an exclusive use of wall slopes leaves\r\nthe centre of the room free, it permits the titles and whereabouts of\r\nnewspapers to be more easily noticed. Wall slopes should be made to the\r\nsame dimensions as standards, save, of course, that only one face is\r\nnecessary. The lower part of the slope should project eighteen inches to\r\nfifteen inches from the wall, to give a convenient angle for reading.\r\nToo great a slope is not desirable, as it tends to throw the top of the\r\npaper out of the reach and eye range of short people. This difficulty\r\nhas been met most satisfactorily by the system designed, we believe, by\r\nMr E. A. Savage for use at Wallasey. Here the slopes work on a central\r\npivot and move backwards and forwards to enable the top or bottom of the\r\npaper to be read with ease, and are so balanced that they fall easily\r\nand readily into their correct position when released. These slopes, it\r\nmay be added, are much lower than those usually adopted, and a reader\r\nmay be seated at them and may compass the whole paper thus. A small\r\nbeading or projection at the foot of the slope is frequently of use in\r\npreventing papers from drooping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=468. Newspaper Fittings.=--TITLES for newspapers should be fixed on the\r\nstands over the centre of the spaces occupied by the papers. A\r\ntitle-board about six inches high should be provided for the purpose. It\r\ncan be made to slide along a projection on the top of the stands if\r\ngrooved on its under side. On this the name-tablets of the newspapers\r\nshould appear in bold letters, not less than two inches high. These\r\ntablets may be printed on paper or card, or may appear on enamelled,\r\nmetal or plate-glass tablets. There is a very large variety of such\r\nname-tablets on the market, and choice will not be difficult. It is a\r\nuseful practice to attach to the fronts of the stands at intervals small\r\nbone, metal or card tablets intimating that papers must be surrendered\r\nto other readers after a certain period of warning has elapsed. A useful\r\nform of such intimation is as follows:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+\r\n  | =Readers are requested to relinquish    |\r\n  | newspapers within TEN MINUTES of        |\r\n  | being asked to do so by other readers.= |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--Simplex Newspaper Holder (Section 469).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--Revolving Newspaper Holder with Clips (Section\r\n469).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=469.= HOLDERS.--There is a very large variety of rods, clips, and other\r\nmeans for holding newspapers on their stands, and the following\r\nillustrations will describe them better than words. A good form is used\r\nin the public libraries of Hammersmith, Wolverhampton, Leicester,\r\nFinsbury, Liverpool, etc., and consists of a pair of screw clips which\r\ncan be readily adjusted to any height of paper. These Simplex clips are\r\nillustrated on the revolving rod. Fig. 168 is called the “Simplex”\r\nnewspaper rod, and is fastened to the bottom by means of a screw turned\r\nby a key. It is used in the public libraries of Wolverhampton, Croydon,\r\nHull, West Ham, Glasgow, etc. Fig. 169 is a revolving holder which can\r\nbe adjusted to different sizes of illustrated periodicals, by means of\r\nthe sliding screw clips. It is intended for periodicals like the\r\n_Graphic_, _Sketch_, _Architect_, etc., which frequently have large\r\nfolding plates running across two pages, and which cannot be\r\nconveniently examined when the journal is secured to a stand. A special\r\nform of separate wooden stand or easel is also made for such illustrated\r\njournals, which will be found useful when room is scarce on the other\r\nslopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=470.= Other fittings for newspaper slopes which are sometimes used are\r\nmetal leaning bars or fences to keep readers from leaning on the papers\r\nand tearing them. These must be very strongly fastened at the foot of\r\nthe slope in such a position as to project about four to six inches from\r\nthe front. They should be held in strong brackets, as they have to\r\nsupport a very considerable weight.\r\n\r\nThe sticks and rods for holding single or several newspapers, such as\r\nare used for clubs and restaurants, are not particularly suitable for\r\npublic library use, unless under very exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest abuses of the newsroom is the tearing or cutting\r\nout of parts of newspapers (ladies frequently remove them with the\r\nscratching of the point of a hat-pin!), especially of advertisements. It\r\nis well to have a notice prominently displayed to the effect that this\r\nis a penal offence, and that persons desiring to copy advertisements may\r\nborrow pencil and paper for the purpose on application.\r\n\r\n\r\n=471. Magazine Rooms and Periodicals.=--The newsroom may be made the\r\nstore for all the trade, technical and other weeklies which in any way\r\nconvey _news_ in their own particular fields; while the magazine room,\r\nif provided separately, may be reserved for the monthly and quarterly\r\nmagazines, reviews and other miscellanies, which are not so much\r\nvehicles for the spread of current news. This is a rough division, but\r\nit seems a reasonable one for libraries where some distinction must be\r\nmade between newsrooms and magazine rooms. In the selection of\r\nperiodicals and magazines the same care should be taken as with\r\nnewspapers to choose only the best and most representative. Committees\r\nshould make it an invariable rule never to take any sectarian paper,\r\nsave as a donation, or in response to a widespread public demand. Church\r\nand chapel papers are often forced upon libraries by their respective\r\npartisans out of sheer rivalry, and when this sort of thing once begins\r\nthe library is sure to suffer by having to pay dearly for the\r\ngratification of mere sectarian feeling. It is waste of money to\r\nsubscribe for the papers of this, that, and the other sect, on the\r\nsentimental grounds of fair play all round, and of meeting the views of\r\nlarge bodies of ratepayers in the same spirit as the wishes of trades or\r\nprofessions are met by providing technical and other journals. But there\r\nis this difference. A technical journal appeals to all sects, while a\r\nsectarian journal does not, and, as a matter of fact, is seldom read by\r\nits adherents once the honour of the faith is vindicated by having it\r\nplaced in the public library. Some libraries adopt the rule of refusing\r\nall donations of periodicals in order to prevent the difficulties that\r\narise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=472.= The arrangement of periodicals and magazines in their respective\r\nrooms calls for some notice. There are several ways in actual use which\r\nall prove satisfactory, and which are, nevertheless, very different in\r\napplication. The most common plan of displaying periodicals is to spread\r\nthem loose all over the tables in strong covers lettered with the\r\ntitles, and to try to maintain a rough alphabetical order. Another\r\nmethod is to place the periodicals in their covers in racks as described\r\nin Sections 162-65. The readers are expected to take what periodical\r\nthey want from these racks, read it at the tables, and return it to its\r\nplace in the rack. As a rule they either do not return them accurately\r\nor they leave them lying on the tables. But in any case this method is\r\npreferable to the plan of spreading them over the tables, as it acts in\r\na measure as an indicator to the periodicals in use. A third method is\r\nto keep the whole of the periodicals off the tables or racks, and to\r\nissue them from a counter or rack which is superintended by an\r\nassistant. This can be done in a number of ways, but preferably by means\r\nof an indicator such as is described in Section 393. The last plan is\r\none which has the advantage of providing each periodical with a fixed\r\nplace where it can always be found, though it entails the provision of a\r\nseparate chair and table space for every magazine, and so requires a\r\nmuch greater amount of space than any of the other methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--Adjustable Periodicals List (Section 474).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=473.= With tables provided with racks in the manners shown in Section\r\n165 the periodicals can be arranged alphabetically, or classified by\r\nkind, and secured to the rack or table by means of stout cords or chains\r\ncovered with leather to prevent noise. If double-sided tables are\r\navailable, with divisions as described above, they should be provided.\r\nDouble-sided tables, especially if narrow, are not comfortable to sit\r\nat, either on account of the knees, breath or manners of your\r\n_vis-à-vis_, but when divided by means of a central partition, much of\r\nthis objection is removed. Except for the difficulty of providing space\r\nfor every separate periodical, it has been found, after trial of most of\r\nthe other methods, that the fixed plan, plus some convenient means of\r\ninserting a new periodical at any point, is on the whole the most\r\nsatisfactory all round. It is a decided advantage for a reader to be\r\nable to go straight to the place where the magazine he wants is fixed,\r\nand to find it always there when directed to it from any form of\r\nindicator or periodicals list. If the less popular or valuable\r\nperiodicals were placed in a rack similar to that shown in Section 165,\r\nFig. 49, the space required for displaying the better periodicals and\r\nmagazines would be considerably restricted in area, while there would be\r\na gain in space as well. The plan of keeping all the periodicals\r\ntogether which deal with the same trade or subject is very advantageous,\r\nand has the effect of removing the readers of lighter magazines, who are\r\nsometimes of a restless type, from the more studious reader who wants\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=474.= In any plan of displaying periodicals on tables or racks a key to\r\nthe order should be provided in the shape of an adjustable periodical\r\nlist, which gives a complete list of every periodical or magazine\r\ncontained in a room. It is an appliance in which the name of every\r\nperiodical taken by the library is clearly displayed on a printed\r\nmovable slip in a glazed English oak frame. This frame has a movable\r\nback to which are attached xylonite strips which retain the printed\r\ntitles of the magazines in place, enabling them to be arranged in any\r\norder and to be added to or taken from at pleasure. Thus the name of a\r\nwithdrawn or defunct periodical can be easily removed and that of a new\r\none added.\r\n\r\n\r\n=475.= The checking of periodicals and newspapers as received, and every\r\nmorning as they lie on the tables, should be done by means of special\r\nrecords or checks. An effective form of check card for magazines or\r\nperiodicals as received from the newsagent is shown in Figs. 171-3. This\r\nshows overdues at once, and enables a complete check to be kept on the\r\ndelivery of periodicals. One kind of ruling suffices for every kind of\r\nperiodical, daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly, and the cards are ruled\r\nas in the figures below with heading and fifty-two lines to the page. If\r\nnecessary both sides can be ruled, and so one card can be made to last\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nIn the cards for monthly periodicals the names of the months should be\r\nwritten in advance, the dates of receipt being added against each month\r\nas the magazine is received. In the case of weeklies and dailies the\r\nnumbers are to be entered number by number as received. An overdue can\r\nbe noticed at once by anyone going over the cards, by simply noting that\r\na weekly due on Friday, the day previous to the actual date of\r\npublication, has not been entered. These cards should be examined for\r\noverdues daily in the case of dailies, and every Friday evening or\r\nSaturday morning in the case of weeklies and monthlies. If each kind is\r\nstored in a suitable box or portfolio the checking and marking-off can\r\nbe done with great rapidity. These cards can also be used for annuals,\r\nsociety publications, etc. In the latter case the year can be written at\r\nthe top of the column, and the publications received for the\r\nsubscription can be written in the column lengthways. If nothing has\r\nbeen received by the middle of any year, the society can be notified.\r\nBut the irregularity of society and other subscription publications is a\r\nfeature which requires a good deal of watching, and a card check of some\r\nkind is essential.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |     _Cornhill Magazine._                 _Annual Cost_, 9s.        |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  | _Vendor_, Jones & Co.     _Due about_ 28th.   _Location_, Rack 30. |\r\n  +-----+------+-----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+\r\n  |   19|01.   |   19|02.  |  19|03.  |  19|04.  |  19|05.  |  19|06.  |\r\n  +-----+------+-----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+\r\n  |No.  | Rec. |     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |Jan. |Dc. 28|     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |Feb. |Jn. 29|     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |Mar. |Mar. 1|     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |Apl. |      |     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |May  |      |     |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |     |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |The ruling continues for 52 lines.                                  |\r\n\r\nFIG. 171.--Periodicals Check Card, Blue (9¼″ × 6″), showing Arrangement\r\nfor Monthlies (Section 475).\r\n\r\n  +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | 1901.| 1902.|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |Jun. 1|Jun. 2|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  8|  „  9|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „ 15|  „ 16|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „ 22|  „ 23|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „ 29|  „ 30|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |      |      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n\r\nFIG. 172.--White Card, showing Arrangement for Weeklies (Section 475).\r\n\r\n  +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |<     |      |   19|01.  |     |    >|<    |     |   19|02.  |     |    >|\r\n  +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |Jun. 1|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  3|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  4|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  5|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  6|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  7|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „  8|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „ 10|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |  „ 11|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n\r\nFIG. 173.--Buff Card, showing Arrangement for Dailies (Section 475).\r\n\r\n\r\n=476.= The morning check of periodicals as they lie on the tables should\r\nbe done by an assistant armed with a list, written or printed on a card,\r\nby means of which he or she can follow the order of all the periodicals\r\nas they are arranged on stands, tables or racks. Anything missing should\r\nbe noted on a separate slip of paper, and entered in the work-book. The\r\ninitials of the checker should also be written in the work-book in the\r\nspace provided. (See Section 89.) The librarian should receive the check\r\nslip if anything is missing. In similar fashion the assistant who\r\nexamines the periodical check cards for overdues should notify the\r\nlibrarian of any numbers not promptly received.\r\n\r\nThe filing of magazines and newspapers may be done in a variety of ways.\r\nNewspapers should be kept in order on special racks, in piles, with a\r\nsuitable board underneath to act as a runner and support, and a sheet of\r\ncardboard or glazed casing paper above to prevent the settling of dust.\r\nPeriodicals and magazines may either be kept in special cloth-covered\r\nboxes made to take a whole or half-year’s numbers, as the case may be,\r\nor kept on boards in the same manner as newspapers. In both cases\r\nalphabetical order of titles will be found a suitable arrangement. The\r\nplan of placing the numbers of a periodical as done at the Mitchell\r\nLibrary, Glasgow, seems a simple and effective manner of dealing with a\r\nlarge number of files. This is illustrated in Fig. 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n=477.= It is not advisable to reserve anything, either for binding, or\r\npreservation for a time, and it is wise to make up a list of periodicals\r\nand newspapers which it is intended to keep, file them, and give all\r\nthe remainder away to poorhouses, asylums or similar institutions.\r\nSometimes they can be sold at half-price as withdrawn from the tables,\r\nbut in most cases all matter of this kind has to be sold as waste-paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n=478.= The only satisfactory method of counting the attendances in\r\ngeneral reading rooms is by means of a recording turnstile. All other\r\nmethods of occasional counts and the striking of averages are\r\nunreliable. The demand for statistics is sometimes so strong,\r\nunfortunately, that librarians are driven to satisfy their committees as\r\nto the use made of reading rooms, and in the absence of a turnstile the\r\nbest thing to do is to take whole-day counts as follows: on a Monday in\r\nJanuary; Tuesday in February; Wednesday in March, etc.; divide the total\r\nby twelve, and multiply the average thus obtained by the number of days\r\nopen. Every individual who enters or re-enters must be counted. This\r\ngives a mere approximation to the actual attendance, but is a better and\r\nmore reasonable plan than counting the readers present in the rooms\r\nevery hour or half-hour, adding the totals together, and reckoning the\r\nresult as the day’s attendance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 174.--Periodicals File (Section 476).]\r\n\r\nAs an aid in keeping order in public newsrooms it is a good plan to\r\nframe a few copies of the 1898 “Act to provide for the Punishment of\r\nOffences in Libraries,” and to hang them in conspicuous places, along\r\nwith the admonitory notices regarding “Silence,” etc. The official\r\nappearance of a framed Act of Parliament has a daunting effect upon a\r\ncertain type of mind, and has been found to act as a check upon sporting\r\nand loafing individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n=479. Women’s Rooms.=--About eighty public libraries in Britain have\r\nprovided separate rooms for the use of women, but it is doubtful if such\r\naccommodation is really necessary, and they have not been uniformly\r\nsuccessful. To a certain extent the matter depends upon the locality. If\r\nthere is plenty of room in the building there is no harm in making this\r\nextra provision, if the room can be properly overlooked, but in cases\r\nwhere space is limited, it is a mistake to cramp the rest of the\r\nbuilding for the sake of a somewhat sentimental idea. A few extra women\r\nof a fidgety or timid sort may be attracted to the library because of\r\nthis exclusive accommodation, but the great majority of women prefer to\r\nuse the ordinary departments of a public library on the same footing and\r\nconditions as men, and resent distinctions, such as the room implies. If\r\nwomen can use the crowded spaces in front of restricted lending\r\nlibraries, and can mix with men in open lending libraries, they can\r\nsurely use the other public rooms without harm or inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n=480. Public Lavatory Accommodation.=--This is perhaps a convenient\r\nplace to mention lavatory accommodation for the public. It should not be\r\nprovided by public library authorities at all, unless to a limited\r\nextent for the use of reference library readers, or for social meetings\r\nin connexion with lecture rooms. It is the duty of the sanitary or\r\npublic health authorities to provide this kind of public accommodation,\r\nand not library boards with painfully limited funds. Somewhere adjacent\r\nto the library building provision of this kind can be made by the local\r\nauthority, and it will be found a convenience to the public and a relief\r\nto the library funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=481.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  No monograph.

General Considerations.=--The declaration of the Library\r\nAssociation that library work with children is the foundation of all\r\nother library work represents, so far as Great Britain is concerned, an\r\nideal rather than an accomplished fact. The will to make provision for\r\nthe child has not been lacking, but the means at the disposal of library\r\ncommittees have hitherto been insufficient for other activities, and the\r\nchild has necessarily been dealt with in a parsimonious manner.\r\nUndoubtedly, in circumstances hitherto prevailing, the axiom that to\r\npursue work for children at the expense of the efficiency of the library\r\nas a whole is to defeat its very purpose, is true. But from\r\ncomparatively early times the book needs of the children have been\r\nrecognized. So long ago as 1882 Nottingham possessed a reading room for\r\nchildren, and, with intervals, such departments have been multiplied,\r\nand there is now hardly a town of any size which does not make _some_\r\nprovision for young readers. The object of the children’s department is\r\nto provide the intellectual workshop for the use of the child. He is\r\ntaught to use intellectual tools in the school, but the library provides\r\nhim with the material upon which they may be exercised. Usually the\r\ndepartment serves children from the age of six to the age of fourteen.\r\nIn a completely organized department there are library, reading\r\ndepartment, and study corners; and such activities as story hours,\r\nlectures, reading circles, and the keeping of festivals are maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n=483. What has been Done.=--Separate, distinctive children’s departments\r\nare a quite modern institution. Hitherto, in the majority of libraries,\r\nan alcove, or a number of shelves, have been set aside for children’s\r\nbooks in the adult lending department, and no provision has definitely,\r\nbeen made for newspapers, magazines and other reading material for the\r\nyoung. Many difficulties have arisen from this arrangement. The age of\r\nadmission to libraries is usually fourteen, and children under this age,\r\nexcept in special circumstances, have been limited to books in the\r\nshelves allocated to children. But children of eleven or twelve\r\nfrequently require books which cannot by any ordinary reasoning be\r\nregarded as juvenile works; and on every such occasion special\r\nconcessions have been made, the requiring and the granting of which are\r\nirritating both to the child and the librarian, however liberal-minded\r\nthe latter may be, and therefore subversive of the best results. More\r\nrecently the age of fourteen has been regarded as too high, and in some\r\ntowns twelve, or even ten, years has been regarded as a suitable age at\r\nwhich children may be given the freedom of the whole lending department.\r\nThis seems better, and where such low age limits have been set the\r\nresults have been good. It is obvious, however, that the limited\r\nprovision we have described in this section is not calculated to prove\r\nthe “foundation of all library work.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=484. Children’s Libraries.=--From these considerations has developed\r\nthe modern children’s department as an entirely separate part of the\r\nlibrary, equivalent in rank and importance to the adult lending or\r\nreference departments. In England the most elaborate system of such\r\nlibraries is that at Cardiff, but many other towns, including Glasgow,\r\nLiverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Islington, Chelsea, Hampstead, Coventry,\r\nSt Helens, and Nottingham, have such separate departments, and every\r\nmodern librarian in planning a library system provides for them. The\r\nlimits of this _Manual_ do not permit of an exhaustive study of the many\r\nvarieties of children’s libraries and their manifold activities, but an\r\noutline of the methods most commonly in vogue here and in America (where\r\nthe work is far more highly developed than here) are an integral part of\r\nour work.\r\n\r\nThe children’s department, then, should be an apartment as effective in\r\narchitectural character as any other department: well-lighted, spacious,\r\nlofty, and decorated tastefully. These factors are overlooked at times,\r\nsometimes, unfortunately, of necessity; but we insist upon them,\r\nbecause the atmosphere induced by a handsome and suitable library is\r\nnecessary if we are, first, to avoid ruffling the sensitiveness of\r\nchildren who are as jealous of their rights in the public libraries as\r\nare adults; and, second, to create that feeling of reverence and respect\r\nfor books which is a factor in obtaining discipline in the apartment. An\r\nill-lighted, crudely-decorated basement is sometimes devoted to the\r\npurpose, and this may have its uses, but it is certain to fall short\r\nlamentably of the full possibilities of a children’s library. The\r\napartment being provided, several problems have to be settled. The\r\nsystems in existence differ in different places. In some towns the\r\nchildren’s department is a reading room and reference library merely,\r\nand books are not lent for home reading. It is thought, in such cases,\r\nthat the children can best be provided with books for home reading\r\nthrough a system of school libraries, such as we describe in the next\r\nchapter. This, however, seems to ignore the fact that such school\r\nlibraries are usually restricted to public and council schools, that\r\nthere are other kinds of schools in every town, and large numbers of\r\nchildren, therefore, who have not access to school libraries; and their\r\nclaims to library facilities are as strong as those of public and\r\ncouncil school children. Such is the system in vogue, we believe, at\r\nCardiff. In other towns the department embraces lending library, reading\r\nroom, and reference library, and good examples of these are to be seen\r\nat Islington. Here the room is divided into two parts, the smaller part\r\nbeing an open access lending library, and the greater part a reading\r\nroom, with special tables set apart for quiet study, and containing a\r\ncarefully-chosen collection of reference books. These methods have both\r\ngreat advantages, and are worthy of rather more detailed consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.--Children’s Hall, Cathays Branch Library,\r\nCardiff (Section 485).]\r\n\r\n\r\n=485. The Reference-Reading Method.=--We have used this name for want of\r\na better to indicate the system which limits the use of the contents of\r\nthe room to the room itself---a system, we may add, which has been\r\napproved by the Conference of Librarians held at Manchester in 1918, as\r\nthe better of the two described. The library is usually a large room\r\nwith wall-cases for books upon two or three sides of the room, but with\r\none wall left blank and whitened for use as a lantern screen, and\r\nintervals of the walls covered with baize screens upon which pictures,\r\nbulletins, lists, etc., can be displayed. Part of the room is reserved\r\nfor children who desire to do home lessons, or make special study, or\r\nwho wish (as is more frequently the case than is generally supposed) to\r\nbecome authors. For these, small desks, separate if possible, are\r\nprovided, and the use of ink is permitted. Another set of tables is\r\nallocated to such newspapers and periodicals as are suitable for\r\nchildren. The selection of the latter is a matter requiring special\r\ncare. Good daily newspapers may be provided--_The Daily Graphic_, for\r\ninstance, is interesting to most children--but there is a real need for\r\na definitely children’s _newspaper_, one that presents in a manner\r\nattractive to the child mind a selection of the matter occurring in the\r\nordinary newspaper; the recognized children’s periodicals in English and\r\nFrench, and in other languages where circumstances warrant it; such\r\n“instructive” periodicals as those teaching shorthand, languages, how to\r\nmake things, and simple “trade” periodicals; as well as a selection of\r\nsuch weekly journals as _The Illustrated London News_ and _The Graphic_.\r\nChildren are more virile mentally than is sometimes supposed, and many\r\nostensibly adult periodicals are quite suitable for them. The remainder\r\nof the room may be devoted to tables or desks for the reading of the\r\nbooks from the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n=486. Lending Library.=--All the features enumerated in the foregoing\r\nsection should be found in the department which has also a lending\r\nlibrary, except that the number of books to be provided for reading in\r\nthe room will probably be smaller, and fewer book-cases will in that\r\ncase be necessary. The lending section will be conducted on principles\r\nsimilar to those governing the adult lending library, with such\r\nadaptations as experience suggests to be desirable. Simplicity is the\r\nkeynote of the work, and the regulations governing the issue of readers’\r\ntickets and the lending of books should be made as easy and unambiguous\r\nas possible. A few of these may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n  1. Children should be permitted to borrow books upon the\r\n  recommendation of the head teacher of the school they attend. In some\r\n  libraries a more definite guarantee is required to prevent possible\r\n  loss and to recover the cost of loss or damages, as it is obvious that\r\n  the teacher cannot be expected to accept financial responsibility in\r\n  this connexion and would undoubtedly refuse to do so; and these\r\n  require the children to be guaranteed by burgesses in the same manner\r\n  as adult readers. It will be found, however, that children have\r\n  frequently some difficulty in finding a guarantor; even parents at\r\n  times refuse to bind themselves in this way; and, with careful\r\n  supervision, the teacher’s recommendation will be found to be\r\n  effective.

In this case the householder may be\r\n  expected to assume the responsibilities of any ordinary guarantor.\r\n\r\n  3. In ordinary circumstances a child should be permitted to borrow one\r\n  book only at a time, and should not be permitted to change it for\r\n  another more frequently than once a week.\r\n\r\n  We desire to avoid controversial matter in this _Manual_, and this\r\n  provision, we expect, is open to criticism; indeed, when it was\r\n  suggested elsewhere an American librarian remarked that it “seemed\r\n  unnecessary.” British librarians, however, have actually been\r\n  requested by teachers to make these restrictions on the arguments that\r\n  few children do any comparative reading, and that still fewer can\r\n  read more than one book in a week and at the same time do their home\r\n  lessons and spend as much time in outdoor recreation as is needful for\r\n  their health. Another less satisfactory reason is that some librarians\r\n  have found the child population, when not so restricted, crowding the\r\n  lending library to such an extent that their staffs have been unable\r\n  to maintain the discipline without which effective work is impossible,\r\n  or to meet the demands of the children. Such librarians have divided\r\n  their register of children alphabetically, and children whose names\r\n  begin with certain letters are admitted to the lending library only on\r\n  certain days.\r\n\r\n  4. The rules should embody simple provisions governing the duration of\r\n  loan (usually fourteen days are allowed, but circumstances may warrant\r\n  an extension of this time), cleanliness, care of books, and the\r\n  disposal of books in cases where the child or any member of the\r\n  household is in contact with infection.\r\n\r\nA difficult matter is what, if any, penalties should be inflicted upon\r\nchildren in the case of undue detention of books or for other offences.\r\nFines are sometimes imposed, as in the adult library, but often they\r\ncannot be recovered without great trouble, and they should usually be\r\nremitted when any reasonable excuse can be offered. Many children cannot\r\nobtain the necessary pence, except from their parents, and to press for\r\nfines frequently means that the child will be forbidden the use of the\r\nlibrary by the parents. In this matter the librarian should have the\r\nfullest discretion. Persistent offenders are effectively dealt with by\r\nthe suspending of their tickets for a time; but we do not wish to insist\r\nupon this method, as the librarian naturally desires to have books used\r\nrather than to prevent their use. Lost books must be replaced by parents\r\nas a matter of course whenever it is possible to get at them; and the\r\nteacher will often lend his powerful assistance in securing the return\r\nor replacing of missing volumes, and, indeed, in seeing that the library\r\nrules generally are observed by his pupils. Co-operation and sympathy\r\nbetween librarian and teacher are first essentials of successful work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=487. Furniture and Fittings.=--The furnishing of the children’s room\r\nis governed by the considerations explained in Division V., but again\r\nwith adaptations dictated by the fact that the furniture is for children\r\nand not for adults. Desks, tables, chairs, reading slopes, etc., should\r\nbe of such heights that they can be used with comfort. In regard to\r\ntables and chairs, 25¼ inches is a suitable height for the former and\r\n14¼ inches for the latter. Book-cases should be approximately 6½ feet in\r\nheight as against 7 feet for adults. Such rigid furnishing as that which\r\nprovides long narrow desks resembling school forms for the children, so\r\narranged that the children all face one way, is to be deprecated. Tables\r\nwhich provide the maximum of space, comfort and seclusion are as\r\ndesirable for this room as for any other. Each periodical and reader\r\nrequires three feet of lateral space, and there should be three feet\r\nbetween each table, or four where the space is a gangway. Screens of\r\nsome soft wood, covered with baize, should be placed on the walls, at\r\nintervals; and a blackboard and an optical lantern are valuable parts of\r\nthe equipment. Any space that may remain on the walls may be devoted to\r\npictures, which need not be many, but should be large, deal with\r\ndefinite subjects, and be good of their kind. These are the more obvious\r\ndifferences between the children’s and the adult departments, except\r\nthat in some libraries lavatory accommodation is provided in order that\r\nchildren may wash their hands before entering the library proper. Such\r\naccommodation has distinct advantages, as many children come into the\r\ndepartment straight from playing in the street, and it is rather hard to\r\nrefuse them admission because their hands are not in a suitable state\r\nfor the using of books. On the other hand, strict supervision of such\r\naccommodation is necessary, and this is difficult to provide on account\r\nof the increased cost involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n=488. Book Selection.=--A few principles governing the selection of\r\nbooks for children may be given here, drawn from an immense mass of\r\nwritten material upon the subject. In a general way it may be asserted\r\nthat the child is the best judge of its own literature, and the classics\r\nfor children survive as such simply because they receive the continued\r\nsuffrages of children. Excellent bibliographies and lists exist,\r\nespecially American ones, and many libraries have issued catalogues of\r\ntheir children’s libraries. A comparison of these is a necessary\r\npreliminary to stocking the department. Catholicity and a not too rigid\r\ninsistence upon high literary merit are proper attitudes, because there\r\nis no exact definition of a children’s book, and any book likely to be\r\nused by children should be regarded as suitable; and the variations in\r\ntaste and capability of children are so great that if there is too\r\npronounced insistence upon high literary quality many children will\r\nneglect the books provided. It is better to commence with a lower\r\naverage of merit and attract children, and then, by placing better books\r\nin their way, to improve their tastes without too much obtruding of the\r\nfact upon them. By this it is not meant that worthless books are to be\r\nincluded, but there are undoubtedly books having no claim to high rank\r\nwhich are wholesome and harmless. A preponderating part of the lending\r\nstock will be of fiction--perhaps twenty per cent. of it--and here the\r\nlibrarian has the accumulated experience of other librarians to assist\r\nhis selection, and, with regard to contemporary writings, they are not\r\nso numerous that the characteristics of any given author cannot easily\r\nbe tested. Books of classic rank should be available in such numbers\r\nthat there are always enough copies to meet the current demand and at\r\nthe same time to leave a copy on the shelves. A librarian should never\r\nbe compelled to reply to a child that _Ivanhoe_, _The Last of the\r\nMohicans_, _Alice in Wonderland_, _Robinson Crusoe_, or _The Jungle\r\nBook_, for example, is “out.” It is questionable whether abridged or\r\nadapted versions or extracts from classics should be stocked; they often\r\ngive children an entirely false impression of the work they represent,\r\nand as a general rule works that may be “extracted” for children should\r\nbe provided in their original form. A “Bowdlerized” Shakespeare is an\r\nobjectionable work; the more virile or doubtful parts of the complete\r\nplays rarely touch children or are understood by them. In other classes\r\nof literature great discretion must be exercised. A balanced selection\r\ncovering the whole field of knowledge should be the aim, and although\r\nthere are still many blank spaces in this field, there are fortunately\r\nthousands of works on the arts, sciences, history, biography, and,\r\nindeed, upon most subjects, eminently adapted to children. Mere\r\nsimplicity is not the first essential of such books. Children of quite\r\ntender years can make use of many books which are not intended primarily\r\nfor them, and these may frequently be admitted with great advantage.\r\nThe intrinsic side of selection may be summarized briefly: Admit all\r\nbooks which appeal to children so long as they are in good English, have\r\nno immoral tendency, do not bring the sanctities of life into ridicule,\r\nare accurate, and have a worthy quality of humour. This last condition\r\nis important. The average child has not a very refined sense of humour,\r\nhe prefers it of a concrete quality, without irony or sarcasm, and too\r\noften founded upon human depravity, deformity and misfortune; this taste\r\nmust be counteracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=489.= The physical side of books is only less important than the\r\nliterary, a fact frequently overlooked. Good, legible, well-inked type,\r\ngood paper, well-drawn, coloured and accurately-registered illustrations\r\nshould always be sought. There is an æsthetic value in books which\r\nshould not be neglected, and this is absent from ill-produced works; and\r\nthe eyesight of children should be guarded from small or illegible\r\nprint. Bindings should be strong and durable, an almost impossible\r\ncondition at the present day when cheap machine-made cases are the rule.\r\nThe life of the book of to-day in continual use is at best only a few\r\nmonths. Before the European War publishers were gradually introducing\r\nreinforced and other strong bindings for children’s books, and it is to\r\nbe hoped that this desirable practice will in due course be resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=490.= Recent events have so affected the book-market that any rigid\r\nestimate of the average cost of books would be futile, as being subject\r\nto probable immense fluctuations. Five years ago 3s. 6d. was a fair\r\naverage price for a lending library book for young readers; at the time\r\nof writing 5s. would be nearer the sum that would have to be paid. It\r\ncan only be assumed that a considerable time will elapse before books\r\nwill return to their original prices. Any other assumption would be\r\nunwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=491. Administration.=--Primary factors in successful work are freedom\r\nof access, the maintenance of proper but not oppressive discipline, and\r\nthe administration of the department by a specially trained and\r\nqualified staff. Ruskin’s theory that a child should be let loose in a\r\ngood library to choose or reject as he wills has proved to be\r\nsatisfactory in practice, and to promote that sense of personal\r\nproprietorship in the library which it is desirable that he should\r\npossess. Other reasons for the open access system are the opportunities\r\nit gives for close contact between the child and the librarian, of the\r\nopportunities it gives the child of learning what treasures are at his\r\ndisposal, in addition to every other advantage which may be said to\r\naccrue to the system when used for adult readers. The hours of opening\r\nshould be governed by the school hours; that is to say, it is hardly\r\never necessary to open during school hours; and the library should close\r\nat a reasonable hour in order that children may not be induced to remain\r\nthere at times when they ought to be in their homes. These hours differ\r\nin different localities. At holiday times, however, the library should\r\nbe accessible during the greater part of the daytime.\r\n\r\n\r\n=492.= Discipline, it has been well remarked, is the problem of the\r\nchildren’s department. While the dragooning methods of the parish beadle\r\nwould be deplorably out of place, it is impossible to agree with the\r\nAmerican librarian who declares that “children usually do not mind noise\r\nand crowding,” because, even if in theory they do not, it is impossible\r\nto carry on effective work in conditions of congestion and noise. Too\r\nprecise a method would defeat its object, but it would seem wise to\r\nlimit the admissions at any time to such numbers as may be controlled\r\neasily by the librarian. Mr L. Stanley Jast has gone so far as to affirm\r\nthat the children should not be more than can easily be “contacted by\r\nthe librarian,” on the ground that more efficient work can thus be done.\r\nIt is a matter upon which a decision can only be made from a knowledge\r\nof the conditions and the character of the child population. Clearly,\r\nhowever, a qualification in a successful children’s librarian is the\r\npower to keep order, to prevent practical joking, loud conversation and\r\nlaughter in the reading room. Firmness displayed with kindness, but with\r\ndecision, and the excluding of unrepentant offenders have been found to\r\nbe effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n=493.= The training of the children’s librarian is special and\r\nnecessary. In England it has not been developed in any degree\r\ncommensurate with the need, and our ideals in this matter must be drawn\r\nfrom our American cousins. They require a sound preliminary education in\r\nthe candidate, a knowledge of the broader lines of general library\r\nadministration, and, added to these, a study of the child mind,\r\npractical social service work, the study of the bibliography of juvenile\r\nliterature, and practice--usually gained by actual work in children’s\r\nrooms--in story-telling, subject-hunting, bulletin-making, and similar\r\nmatters. Cataloguing, classification, the preparing of attractive lists,\r\netc., for children are all somewhat modified from the forms in use in\r\nthe grown people’s departments, and all are treated specially. All these\r\nstudies premise that the librarian has the requisite “personality,” and\r\nthis is a matter of natural inheritance rather than of training. In\r\nEurope this special training can only be gained in the children’s room,\r\nand, as a matter of fact, is not always gained. Too often librarians\r\nhave perforce been obliged to hand the conduct of the department to any\r\nmember of the staff who might be available at the time. This state of\r\naffairs must receive attention if the children’s department is to\r\naccomplish its purpose. Probably the ordinary training of the Froebel\r\nsystem superadded to general library training is the best preparation\r\nthat can be given to the British children’s librarian at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n=494. Activities of the Department.=--To bring the child into contact\r\nwith the proper book is the aim of the department. Free choice amongst\r\nbooks will suffice in a number of instances; but such passive methods\r\nwill not always secure good results. The assistant in charge must win\r\nthe confidence of the children and guide them in the most unobtrusive\r\nmanner possible to the books likely to be of interest and use. Various\r\nactive methods are in use to gain this end. The most popular of these is\r\nthe Story Hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n=495.= It has been premised that children from six to fourteen years of\r\nage will frequent the department, and there is a vast range of ability\r\nand taste in children in the various years between these ages. Little\r\nchildren require simple large-print books with plenty of illustrations,\r\nand may be drawn to them if story-telling forms part of the librarian’s\r\nactivities. Story hours, indeed, are most attractive to children of all\r\nages. They are given informally, the children usually being grouped\r\nround the librarian in a half-circle while she tells them a fairy story,\r\nor stories drawn from the greater writers, from history, poetry, or what\r\nnot. The connexion between the story hour and the after reading of the\r\nbooks which contain the stories is clear. Such story-telling requires\r\nspecial and intelligent study, good elocution, fluency and the sense of\r\nthe dramatic. The objection frequently offered to the work is that it is\r\nharmful to children for them to hear a story by a great writer delivered\r\nin inferior language and brokenly by an indifferent librarian. This,\r\nhowever, is purely a matter of experience and training, and there are\r\nadmirable manuals of story-telling method by Miss Marie Shedlock, Miss\r\nL. M. Olcott, and others which may help in this matter. Otherwise the\r\nvalue of the work is undoubted. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh sets\r\nthe standard which has general approval. There it is found that groups\r\nof thirty children are convenient in size, although it is often\r\nnecessary to have larger groups. “To the younger children miscellaneous\r\nstories are told, selected chiefly from the folk-tales of various\r\ncountries, legends, myths, fables, modern realistic stories and Bible\r\nstories. Two stories are usually told to each group, and whenever\r\npossible variety is given by the selection of stories of different\r\ntypes. Poems and nursery rhymes are occasionally included in these\r\nprogrammes. Special days are celebrated if stories can be found which\r\nexpress the spirit of the holiday and are sufficiently dramatic in form.\r\nThe same stories are sometimes repeated during the year because of the\r\ndeeper impression made through repetition, and the value to children of\r\nan intimate acquaintance with a few of the best things in literature\r\nappropriate for them. If something new is given each time, the\r\nimpressions are confused and dissipated, and material which is either\r\nbeyond a child’s appreciation or unsuitable for story-telling must\r\nfinally be used. When an additional story is told, and the children are\r\nallowed a choice, the story requested is almost without exception a very\r\nold and well-known one. To the older children some of the great cycle\r\nstories are presented by telling one story each week. High adventure and\r\nromance, as depicted in these hero tales, have a special appeal to the\r\nboy and girl from ten to fifteen, and at this age interest is easily\r\nsustained.”[17]\r\n\r\n  [17] Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. _Stories to Tell to Children._\r\n       See List at end of this division.\r\n\r\n\r\n=496.= More formal lectures prove entirely successful with children,\r\nthe difficulty as a rule being to find accommodation for the numbers who\r\ndesire to attend them. They differ from lectures given to adults\r\nprincipally in the fact that they are simpler, but not always even in\r\nthis particular. Lecturing to children demands a freedom of manner and\r\nfrom mannerisms, decision and fluency; and it will be found that the\r\naudience is one of the most critical a lecturer can encounter. All the\r\nconditions of definite, clear and accurate subject-matter, refined\r\nhumour, etc., which are required in books are also required in the\r\nlecture. Such subjects as the history of inventions and historical\r\nepisodes appeal strongly to boys, but perhaps not so greatly to girls,\r\nwho find nature, literary and similar lectures more to their\r\ntaste--although dogmatic statement on this point is entirely unwise. The\r\njudicious use of lantern slides, pictures and exhibits enhances these\r\nlectures, but many subjects are better treated without them. Pictures of\r\ncharacters in works of imagination, for example, often destroy the\r\nchild’s own, and therefore more valuable, conception of the characters.\r\nGood discipline is essential to successful lectures, and this depends\r\nupon the lecturer; uneasiness in the audience usually means that it is\r\nbored, and the lecturer is wise to consider it thus.\r\n\r\n\r\n=497.= Reading clubs and circles often form part of the activities of\r\nthe department. In these the members, who are admitted to them formally,\r\nundertake to read through some special book under the guidance of a\r\nleader who, of course, may be a member of the library staff, although an\r\nolder child may be induced to become leader. Usually the children read\r\nthe prescribed portion of the book privately, and at the circle they go\r\nover it, talk about it, ask questions, and look at pictures, maps and\r\nother books that may throw more light on their reading or increase its\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=498.= A valuable auxiliary of story hours, lectures and reading circles\r\nis a collection of illustrations. Such collections are becoming a\r\nfeature of some British, and have long been used in American, libraries.\r\nThe collection is made up of illustrations abstracted from all suitable\r\nsources, worn-out books, periodicals, catalogues, advertisements, etc.,\r\nin addition to pictures separately published. Each picture is mounted\r\nindividually upon a mount of standard size--12½ inches by 10½ inches for\r\nthe greater number, and 17 inches by 13½ inches for larger pictures\r\nhave been proved to be quite suitable--of manila, art paper, or some\r\nsimilar stiff material; and the pictures are minutely classified, and\r\nmay be filed in closed pamphlet boxes, or, better, vertically in a\r\nfiling cabinet. Systematic abstracting of such illustrations for the\r\navailable sources of an ordinary library will soon produce a large\r\ncollection. The rule to be observed is that the pictures must illustrate\r\nsome fact, scene or object. Pictures from the average modern novel,\r\nviews of scenes which may be found in any country, “pretty” pictures,\r\netc., have practically no value. An exception may be made in favour of\r\nillustrations of classic works by distinguished artists, but for the\r\nreasons advanced against lantern slides in illustrating such works even\r\nthis is doubtful. The collection should be available not only in the\r\ndepartment, they should also be lent to teachers for use in class work\r\nin school and to reading circles and other people who may desire to use\r\nthem. Such pictures may form the basis of what is called bulletin work.\r\nOn suitable occasions, holidays, birthdays of great men, anniversaries\r\nof all kinds, and as illustrating current events, pictures should be\r\ndisplayed on screens in the room in conjunction with brief lists of\r\nillustrative books. Sometimes bulletins are specially made for such\r\noccasions if an assistant with the necessary artistic ability is\r\navailable; attractive borders, small appropriate sketches and similar\r\nembellishments are added to the pictures and lists. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that the bulletin may exercise too great a fascination over its\r\nmaker and too much time be spent upon it; but within limits the bulletin\r\nis an excellent device for drawing the attention of children.\r\n\r\n\r\n=499.= At all seasonable times additional activities recommend\r\nthemselves, but extravagance should be avoided. Exhibits of many kinds,\r\nwild flowers in their seasons, and the common objects and fauna of the\r\ndistrict, are frequently displayed with satisfactory results; and,\r\nindeed, on every opportunity the librarian should make the room of\r\ncurrent living interest to the children.\r\n\r\n\r\n=500.= In almost all these activities voluntary help from interested\r\npeople may be had and should be welcomed. Large picture collections have\r\nin some places been provided almost entirely by this means, and every\r\ntown has people in it who would help as lecturers, leaders of circles,\r\ncollectors and arrangers of exhibits. The wider the lay interest taken\r\nin the department, provided it is directed judiciously, the greater its\r\nsuccess is likely to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n=501. Library Lessons.=--Library lessons may form a useful part of the\r\nactivities of the department. Teachers may bring their classes to the\r\nlibraries in school hours and give lessons on subjects in connexion with\r\nthe ordinary school lessons. Such lessons are frequently given in the\r\nCardiff children’s rooms, and in giving them the teachers use the books,\r\nillustrations, maps and other material in the rooms, and are able to\r\nreinforce these with books or materials from the adult departments.\r\nThere is a novelty in lessons given in such conditions which removes\r\nthem in the child’s mind from ordinary lessons and gives them emphasis.\r\nA pleasure is added to them if the children are allowed a space at their\r\nconclusion in which they may indulge in individual reading according to\r\ntheir own choice from the shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=502.= The library is perhaps more directly concerned with lessons in\r\nwhich the library itself is the subject taught, and these lessons fall\r\nto the staff. A preliminary lesson may consist of a simple demonstration\r\nof the purpose and means of access to the library--its divisions,\r\ncataloguing and classification, and an exercise in finding books; and\r\nthis may be followed by other lessons on the making, use and care of\r\nbooks; and other lessons may follow on reference work, subject-hunting,\r\nthe use of periodical indexes, bibliographical aids, dictionaries, maps,\r\netc. They must be purely objective to succeed, and everything described\r\nshould be placed before the children. These lessons are also given as a\r\nrule in school hours, and inspectors have shown themselves willing to\r\nregard them as part of the school curriculum. Their value both to the\r\nchildren and to the libraries is very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n=503. Classification and Cataloguing.=--The classification and catalogue\r\nmethods of the department should be preliminary to those of the adult\r\ndepartments; but they may be simpler with advantage. Young children\r\nwould probably find the decimal classification in its orthodox form too\r\nintricate. At the same time the system that they use should be in its\r\nessentials the main classification of the library. The following\r\nsimplified form of the decimal system may be suggestive; it is not meant\r\nto be more than that:\r\n\r\n  0 General Works\r\n\r\n  01   Bibliographies. Aids to Reading, Catalogues, etc.\r\n  03   Encyclopædias\r\n  05   Children’s magazines\r\n  07   Newspapers\r\n\r\n  1 Philosophy\r\n\r\n  10   General\r\n  17   Temperance\r\n  19   Conduct\r\n\r\n  2 Religion\r\n\r\n  20   General\r\n  22   The Bible and Bible Stories\r\n  29   Mythology.

America\r\n  99   History of Australasia and Isolated Islands\r\n\r\nThis outline can be expanded as desired without difficulty or\r\ndislocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=504.= Similar principles may well govern the cataloguing of the\r\nchildren’s library. It is well that youngsters should become familiar\r\nwith the arrangement and use of sheaf and card as well as of printed\r\ncatalogues. Moreover, the Anglo-American code is here the best basis\r\nupon which to do the cataloguing. It should be remembered that the\r\nchildren use the catalogue, or ought to use it, and not adults. All\r\nrecondite bibliographical terms, and abbreviations except the simplest,\r\nshould be avoided; and explanatory notes should be written in language\r\nsuch as the children may be expected to understand. Indeed, a rule that\r\nall cataloguing should be expressed in such language--we mean all that\r\nis added to the title--would be a safe one to follow. Some extended\r\nrules, with examples, which may prove helpful in this matter are given\r\nin Berwick Sayers’s _The Children’s Library_, chapter iii. It will be\r\nseen that no particular _form_ of catalogue is recommended; librarians\r\ndiffer widely upon this question. Perhaps the best printed catalogue is\r\nthat issued for schools by the Pittsburgh Library: a catalogue in\r\ndivisions corresponding to the grades in the schools, in which each\r\ndivision contains books which are thought to make appeal to the children\r\nin the grade it represents.\r\n\r\n\r\n=505.= Reading lists follow the same rules. These, to make any useful\r\nappeal, should be presented simply, attractively, and be rigidly\r\nselective. A few titles, well presented, are likely to have more effect\r\nthan lists so long that they frighten the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY AND THE SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\n=506.= If libraries are an integral part of the educational system, it\r\nis clear that their relations with schools and with the teachers must be\r\nclose. This is perhaps more cordially recognized in America than here,\r\nbut there are few librarians who do not endeavour to establish a\r\nconnexion between their libraries and the official teaching system of\r\ntheir towns. In the simplest instance special privileges are offered to\r\nteachers enabling them to borrow from five to twelve or more books at a\r\ntime for class work. In some towns meetings of teachers and library\r\nstaffs are held in order that mutual work may be discussed and arranged.\r\nIn a few places there are special libraries for teachers; and in some\r\nAmerican libraries not only are there these special libraries, but the\r\nteachers are provided with keys which give them access when other parts\r\nof the libraries are closed. One of the privileges of the public library\r\nis to encourage teachers to make the fullest use of books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=507.= It is gradually becoming recognized that a school without a\r\nlibrary lacks an important part of its equipment. In colleges and high\r\nschools this has been recognized practically for some years past, but in\r\nfew but the largest schools have separate rooms been assigned for\r\nlibrary purposes, in the care of an assistant trained in the work. A\r\nteacher whose principal business is teaching has usually been thought to\r\nbe a person sufficiently qualified for the work, with the result that\r\nrarely have the libraries been exploited to anything like the full\r\nmeasure of their possibilities. They are places where books are read or\r\nfrom which books are lent, not places where readers are created,\r\ninformation disseminated, or the practical use of books taught. In fact,\r\none of the absurd gaps in our higher school curriculum is the want of\r\nteaching in the book, in the elements of bibliography; and until this is\r\nfilled our school system must be pronounced to be incomplete. American\r\nmethods deserve study, with a view to their adaptability to British\r\nconditions; and such works as Gilbert O. Ward’s _The High School\r\nLibrary_, in the _A. L. A. Manual of Library Economy_ (as showing the\r\nfield and its possibilities), and Florence M. Hopkins’s _Reference\r\nGuides that Should be Known, and How to Use Them_ (as showing a\r\npractical method in one part of library teaching), will repay such\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=508.= In council and similar elementary schools the municipal library\r\nhas one of its best fields of work. Under the present restricted\r\nfinancial conditions of libraries, however, it is necessary to say that\r\nthe provision of reading matter in the schools should be a charge\r\nagainst educational funds and not against those of the library, which\r\nare already altogether insufficient for ordinary work. It is at the same\r\ntime probable that this work, in so far as book-selection and purchase,\r\ncataloguing and classification, binding, and other details of\r\norganization and administration are concerned, can be done better and\r\nmore economically by the librarian than by the teacher, and should\r\naccordingly be directed by the library committee. The theory of the work\r\nis that while the librarian is the best person to organize the school\r\nlibrary, the teacher is the best person to bring books and children\r\ntogether. Some education authorities make special grants for this work,\r\nvarying from a few to several hundreds of pounds yearly; but before we\r\ndescribe the methods most generally approved, we may make mention of the\r\nvarious unaided efforts that librarians have made to meet the needs of\r\nschools. One is to invite the teacher to obtain, upon his own signature,\r\na ticket for every child whom he considers to be of reading age; to\r\npermit him to borrow the number of books represented by such tickets;\r\nand to retain them so long as he thinks necessary for their due\r\ncirculation. Three months is an average loan period. A second is to\r\nwaive the ticket-taking preliminary and to lend the teacher a number of\r\nbooks for a few weeks or months for lending as he thinks good amongst\r\nthe scholars. There have been many variations of these two methods, but\r\nthey are obviously one in principle; and, useful as they no doubt are,\r\nthey are also obviously limited, as few British libraries have a large\r\nenough stock of books of the right kind to lend in this way to all the\r\nschools in the town which might require the privilege. School libraries\r\nto be lastingly effective require a separate stock with many duplicates,\r\nand these no ordinary public library can, in present circumstances,\r\nprovide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=509.= Co-operation between library and education committees seems to be\r\nthe best method of achieving satisfactory school libraries. By this\r\nmethod the education committee provides the funds, the libraries the\r\nadministration, and the teachers the actual service amongst the\r\nchildren. Wherever there is a children’s department at the public\r\nlibrary it ought to be the centre from which all the libraries in the\r\ntown should be organized, supplied and co-ordinated. Again, to secure\r\nany success, the closest co-operation is necessary between teachers and\r\nlibrarians. This is generally forthcoming, but frequently is not, for\r\nreasons made clear to the editor of this _Manual_ by a prominent\r\nteacher, who writes: “I do not like the circulating of libraries from\r\nschool to school--it is most unsatisfactory. I know the need of the\r\nchildren in my school more exactly than anyone else, and I do not want\r\nbooks dumped on me that my children will not read.” Moreover, it was\r\naffirmed that the books chosen by librarians were unsuitable as being\r\n“too adult.” It is clear, however, that the only real difficulty raised\r\nhere is that to the exchange of the collections between the schools. All\r\nthe other difficulties can be, and are, overcome by the co-operation\r\nwhich is postulated for the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=510.= The control of such school libraries takes several forms. In the\r\nsimplest the education authority grants a certain sum yearly to the\r\nlibrary committee for children’s work, making only the condition that\r\nlibrary service on their behalf shall be efficient. In other cases the\r\neducation authority desires to take a more definite part in the work,\r\nand it has been found that a sub-committee, consisting of members of the\r\nlibrary and education committees and of representatives of the head\r\nteachers, with the librarian as executive officer, will work\r\nsatisfactorily. Such a sub-committee should be free from the limitations\r\nimposed upon subordinate bodies, and although it should report its\r\nactivities, it should not be expected to submit them to the respective\r\ncommittees. Friction is soon generated if the sub-committee’s\r\nbook-selection, or indeed any other feature of its work, is liable to\r\namendment by another body, and we have known really good library schemes\r\nto come to grief through such interference.\r\n\r\n\r\n=511.= A grant for school libraries should consist of an initial capital\r\nsum for equipment and stock, and an annual sum for additions and\r\nmaintenance. Grants vary from about £500 to £25 per annum, and the\r\namounts, of course, are conditioned by the size of the town and the\r\nnumber of schools to be served, as also by the current cost of\r\nfurniture, books and service, all of which are at present in a state of\r\ngreat fluctuation. A good arrangement is that in operation at Cardiff,\r\nwhere the Education Committee grants £2, 10s. yearly for every hundred\r\nchildren permanently on the school registers. The work of preparing,\r\ncataloguing and classifying the books is carried out by the library\r\nstaff as a whole in small libraries, or by the children’s library staff\r\nwhere one exists, or by a special school libraries assistant. In\r\nproviding the commencing stock, a few decisions must be made upon which\r\nthe future usefulness of the libraries will largely depend: (1) the\r\nperiod for which books are to remain at each school; (2) the\r\ndesirability of an unchanging deposit collection at each school; (3) the\r\nmethod of charging at the schools; (4) the methods of recording the\r\nwhereabouts of each book. And there are other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=512.= The period of loan to each school varies from three to twelve\r\nmonths, and the smaller the available stocks of books, the more frequent\r\nshould be the changing of them. Frequent changes, however, involve much\r\nlabour, and it is well that the collections should be as large as\r\npossible at the outset in order that they may serve efficiently for\r\nlonger periods than three months. They should not remain longer than a\r\nyear, as by that time the interest of the collection will be much\r\nreduced and the books themselves will probably be in need of\r\noverhauling. It is a good thing to have a basic, unchanging collection\r\nat each school, consisting of the books which by common consent are\r\nchildren’s classics. These will naturally be duplicated in most of the\r\nschools, as the list of such books is by no means a long one. Their\r\nexistence gives assurance that every child has access to the best of\r\nchildren’s books during his school career. The ultimate aim should be to\r\nincrease the school collections so that periodical interchange between\r\nthe schools becomes unnecessary, except in so far as additions of new\r\nbooks are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n=513. Cataloguing.=--The accession and cataloguing methods may resemble\r\nthose described for Rural Libraries (Sections 546-47). One\r\nsuggestions-slip may serve for any number of copies, the accession\r\nnumbers being added to the card; this forms an inventory of the stock.\r\nFor each copy another catalogue card, in very brief form, should be\r\nwritten, which may be placed behind a guide card bearing the name of the\r\nschool at which the copy is located. A printed catalogue of the whole of\r\nthe school library system is a very useful thing, but is difficult to\r\nmaintain. In any case a list of the books sent to the school should\r\naccompany each dispatch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=514. Charging.=--The head teacher usually appoints a school librarian,\r\nwho may be a teacher, but is more often a senior scholar, and to the\r\nschool librarian is entrusted the issuing of books and the keeping of\r\nthe necessary records. The charging system will be some simplified form\r\nof that in use at the public library. A card-charging system has been\r\nfound to be satisfactory. Trays, pockets, and properly-written\r\nbook-cards are provided by the library staff, and a supply of readers’\r\ntickets which are made out by the school librarian as required. Another\r\nmethod is that described in Section 547, which can be adapted readily to\r\nschool libraries. Scholars are usually allowed to change books once a\r\nweek, during a special “library hour,” which is recognized officially as\r\npart of school time; but this is a matter of local arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n=515.= Usually the work of book-selection is performed by the School\r\nLibraries Committee. It has a drawback in the fact that teachers do not\r\nalways receive the exact books that they wish to have for their schools,\r\nand a better method, at least in theory, is for the librarian to submit\r\na list of the books available for purchase to the teachers, and to\r\ninvite them to requisition those which they think suitable. This would\r\nforestall a very frequent criticism made by teachers; nor would the\r\nlibrarian experience any great difficulty in meeting the demands so\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n=516.= The period for which a collection should remain at a school is\r\nconveniently governed by the school holidays. The summer vacation\r\npresents the best opportunity for overhauling the whole system, and\r\nwhere there is accommodation at the central library, and other\r\ncircumstances permit, it is well to have all the collections returned\r\nthere, where they may be weeded of defective and dirty books, repairs\r\nmay be executed, binding arranged for, stock may be taken, and the new\r\nlocation of the collections determined, so that every school may\r\nrecommence with a new library. But in the intervals between holidays\r\nperiodical visits to the schools should be made by the schools\r\nlibrarian to see that the books are in order, to advise where necessary,\r\nand in other ways to maintain relations between the school and the\r\npublic library. Sometimes the librarian addresses the children in the\r\nschools, upon reading or other library subjects. This visiting work\r\nshould be done with tact and unobtrusively. Frequently teachers prefer\r\nto be allowed to work without the intervention of the librarian, and\r\nsuch preferences must be respected. The business of the librarian is to\r\nsupply books, and _not_ necessarily to exploit them--so far, at least,\r\nas schools are concerned.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  | SUPPLIES WANTED:--               |                     +-------+   |\r\n  |     Book Pockets.............    |                     |       |   |\r\n  |     Borrowers’ Tickets.......    |                     | PENNY |   |\r\n  |     Tags...........              |                     | STAMP |   |\r\n  | Voucher Cards................    |                     |       |   |\r\n  |                                  |                     +-------+   |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  +----------------------------------+                                 |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  | REPAIRS dealt with........vols.  |      CHIEF LIBRARIAN,           |\r\n  | REPAIRS put aside.........vols.  |                                 |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  +----------------------------------+        CENTRAL PUBLIC LIBRARY,  |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  | _Signed_,                        |                                 |\r\n  |     .........................    |                  NEWTON.        |\r\n  |         _School Librarian_.      |                                 |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  |                                  |                                 |\r\n  +----------------------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 177A.--School Libraries Return--front (Section 517).\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |          .............................SCHOOL LIBRARY.              |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |       ISSUES for the month of....................19.......         |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |             |00|10|20|30|40|50|60|70|80|90|  Fiction.  |  Totals.  |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |  1st week.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |            |           |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |  2nd week.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |            |           |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |  3rd week.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |            |           |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |  4th week.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |            |           |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |  5th week.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |            |           |\r\n  +-------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+------------+-----------+\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |     Number of Borrowers.....................                       |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 177B.--School Libraries Return--back (Section 517).\r\n\r\n\r\n=517.= Returns of the circulation are regarded as necessary by most\r\nlibrarians, and have a variety of uses, as every librarian recognizes.\r\nThese are usually made monthly to the librarian. The card shown has\r\nproved satisfactory in practice.\r\n\r\nTeachers, it must be added, do not always see the values of these\r\nreturns, and may consider them an irritating and unnecessary\r\nsuperfluity. If they could be made in the form of an estimate once a\r\nyear the purpose might be served.\r\n\r\n\r\n=518.= The head teacher should not be held responsible in a financial\r\nsense for lost books, nor should he be expected or permitted to replace\r\nthem. He would, however, be expected to take reasonable steps to recover\r\nthem, and in case of loss, a penalty of some kind, however small, is\r\ngenerally inflicted upon the loser. Books which have been in contact\r\nwith infectious disease are sent from the home to the Public Health\r\nDepartment, where they are disinfected, or, in some places, destroyed,\r\nat the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health. Some sanitary\r\nauthorities themselves replace the books which are destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=519.= At what time in the history of school libraries the collections\r\nshould cease to circulate between the schools and become permanent\r\nlibraries in individual schools is a matter upon which opinion differs.\r\nAt Cardiff this stage was reached when there were 600 volumes in the\r\nlarge school, and no school with less than 200. Allowing the average\r\ntime in which a child will use the library, to be four years, the lesser\r\nof these figures provides that each child may read at least one volume a\r\nweek throughout that time; but it is impossible to allow the child a\r\nchoice of books in these circumstances, and this is a very grave defect.\r\nIt can only be affirmed that there should be at least one book for every\r\nchild of reading age, and that this minimum should be increased as\r\nrapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n=520.= Other fields for the public library presented by the schools may\r\nbe indicated briefly. They may be used as deposit stations for adult\r\nreaders in anticipation of the establishment of permanent branch\r\nlibraries; and this method has met with success. The head teacher, too,\r\nshould be allowed the right of requisitioning temporarily any books in\r\nthe public lending libraries which may be desirable for the use of the\r\nscholars in connexion with their class studies; and a generous policy in\r\nlending works from the reference library for use in the school building\r\nis a natural corollary of this.\r\n\r\n\r\n=521. Sunday School Libraries= have not received much attention from\r\nBritish public librarians. They present a useful field of work, in which\r\nthe municipal library may suggest books and methods and offer simple\r\ntraining in library practice to the teachers. As is the case with all\r\nother teachers, the stores of the public library should be made\r\navailable for their use in the widest sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n=522.= Finally, the teachers themselves are entitled to the most careful\r\nattention. At training schools there should be special libraries of\r\npedagogy; and at the public library an effort should be made to place a\r\ncatholic and fully representative collection of works on all branches of\r\nteaching, theory and practice at the disposal of teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=523.= All these matters lead up to the ultimate object of the\r\nlibrarian, which is to establish a natural pathway from the schools to\r\nthe public library. Vouchers of admission should be placed at the\r\ndisposal of the schools, and the recommendation of the head teacher may\r\nprocure readers’ tickets for all children leaving school. Fortunately\r\nmost teachers see the importance of the matter, and a properly\r\nsystematized connexion is therefore made for the child between the\r\nschool library and the much larger and more permanently useful stores of\r\nthe municipal library.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY (CHAPTERS XXXII.-XXXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\n=524.

Students new to the subject should be made aware that much\r\nof the writing upon it is too sentimental, and too concerned with\r\nbypaths, to be of great value; but this criticism does not apply to any\r\nof the works in the list given above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION XIV\r\n\r\nLIBRARY DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE LECTURE ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\n=526. Lecture Room and Platform.=--Library development is a somewhat\r\nelastic term covering the various active measures taken by librarians to\r\nattract readers. It is now a commonplace that while the prime purpose of\r\nthe library is to supply and circulate literature--that is to say,\r\neverything in literary form from books to news-cuttings--modern\r\nlibrarians increasingly adopt the point of view that it is part of their\r\nduty and privilege to create readers. Of the various ways in which this\r\nis done lecture and similar work stands prominent. In the design of\r\nlibraries provision should always be made for a lecture room with\r\nadequate accommodation for an audience, chaired comfortably, equipped\r\nwith lantern and screen, a platform, and blackboard and similar\r\naccessories. The platform deserves care in its design; it should have an\r\nelectric lantern signal communicating with the lanternist, and for\r\nscientific and technical demonstrations, water, gas, and a movable\r\nelectric light should be brought to it. The platform is better for being\r\nlarge enough to accommodate a number of persons for dramatic readings,\r\nmusical parties, etc.; should be approached by a door from the back; and\r\ncurtain arrangements for it are desirable. The construction should be\r\nsolid, and the platform floor should be covered with a thick cork or\r\nother matting to deaden the distracting sound of shuffling feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=527. Lectures and Lecture Societies.=--Lectures of two kinds may be\r\ngiven--those provided by societies who merely use the library, and those\r\narranged by the library itself. Of the former kind many can be arranged\r\nby placing the lecture-room at the disposal of local scientific\r\nsocieties, branches of University Extension, the Workers’ Educational\r\nAssociation, and similar bodies, non-sectarian and non-political, which\r\nhave an educational or partly educational purpose. These should not\r\ninvolve the staff in much labour, or the library in much expense,\r\nalthough there are cases where the librarian or a member of his staff\r\nacts as organizing secretary to such societies. Every effort to centre\r\nthese activities in the library can be justified; the object is to make\r\nthe library the intellectual centre of the town; but it should be\r\nunderstood that the staff cannot develop into mere lecture agents, or\r\nconduct such work at the expense of the main purpose of the library.\r\nWhere the staff is sufficient this objection does not apply, although it\r\nis perhaps well to say that the library should not duplicate work of\r\nthis kind which other institutions in the town are doing efficiently. A\r\ndiscriminating use of voluntary workers, who are frequently forthcoming,\r\nis a solution of many difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n=528.= It is doubtful whether it is legal for library committees to\r\narrange lectures; certainly expenditure upon them has been questioned at\r\ntimes of audit; but various ways of overcoming this difficulty have been\r\ndiscovered. One is to form a lecture society which is a separate\r\norganization using the lecture-room, and this raises subscriptions,\r\nsells programmes, etc., and so defrays expenses; this has been done at\r\nWalthamstow and Newark-upon-Trent. The more frequent way is to obtain\r\nvoluntary lecturers and to keep the running expenses at a negligible\r\nfigure; most towns have acceptable lecturers who are willing to serve\r\nthe public in this way. In some towns, not subject to Government audit,\r\nas in Liverpool, great miscellaneous series of lectures are arranged by\r\nthe libraries, not because they are regarded as a library activity, but\r\nbecause the Libraries Committee is regarded as the most convenient\r\ncommittee for doing this desirable public work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=529.= Librarians differ as to the value of courses of lectures as\r\ncompared with individual miscellaneous lectures. The course certainly\r\nprovides information more or less exhaustive, and is of more benefit to\r\nthe fewer people who attend it; but they are few; and on the other hand\r\nit is argued that it is no part of the function of the library to teach\r\nin the manner implied in a set course, but rather to stimulate interest\r\nin various subjects with direct reference to books. This latter object\r\nshould influence all such activities as those we are considering; there\r\nseems to be little justification for lectures or exhibitions organized\r\nby the library which do not definitely lead to the use of libraries.\r\nRandom lectures have a value of their own, but they are not our\r\nprovince. When, therefore, a syllabus of lectures is drawn up, it should\r\nbe accompanied by brief reading lists on the subjects chosen. In this\r\nway lectures on topography (there are usually too many of these,\r\nhowever), art, science, literature, or indeed any subject, may be a\r\ndirect incentive to reading, and in some places this is emphasized by\r\nthe use of lantern slides and “privilege” issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n=530. Organization.=--Much labour can be saved by the use of a few\r\nsimple methods in organizing lectures. Invitations to lecturers should\r\nnever be on stereotyped circular forms, but should be individual\r\npersonal letters, especially where the lecturer is not to receive a fee,\r\nbut he may be asked to reply on a definite memorandum (see Fig. 178, p.\r\n470).\r\n\r\nA circular of information should also be enclosed describing the\r\nconditions of the lectures, the library at which they are held, the way\r\nto reach it, and, in particular, drawing attention to their purpose of\r\ncalling notice to books, and inviting suggestions as to the best books\r\non the subjects. A stamped addressed envelope for reply, which the\r\nlibrarian may apologize for enclosing on the ground that it will save\r\nthe lecturer’s time, should not be forgotten. The memoranda, when\r\nreturned, can be filed for reference, and their use enables the needs of\r\nthe lecturers to be met completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n=531.= The syllabus should give the list of lectures, conditions of\r\nadmission, the hour and place of their delivery, and contain the reading\r\nlists. These last, as indicated already, should be brief; a long list of\r\nreferences defeats its own object, because readers are frightened by it.\r\nHalf a dozen carefully-selected titles are usually enough. Syllabuses\r\nshould be distributed free to readers in the library; and little other\r\nadvertisement is necessary. A small poster giving the programme, of such\r\nsize that tradesmen will place it in their shops, clergy and ministers\r\nin church porches, and may be displayed in other places, has its uses;\r\nand sometimes an advertisement in the local papers has a good effect.\r\nFor special lectures, for which an attendance larger than the\r\nlecture-room will hold is expected, tickets of admission may be used,\r\nwhich can be distributed free. The back of these tickets can be used for\r\nreading lists.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  |                        LECTURER’S MEMORANDUM.                      |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  | Name (as you desire it to be printed)............................. |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  | Title of lecture.................................................. |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  | Library........................................................... |\r\n  |                                                                    |\r\n  | Date...........................

Lantern Slides.=--The lantern is used at many lectures, and is a\r\nvaluable auxiliary. All lists of books should be transferred to lantern\r\nslides, and displayed at the beginning or end of the lecture, and--this\r\nis the important point--the lecturer should be persuaded to comment upon\r\nthem. Clear glass-slides with a surface prepared to take pen writing in\r\nindia or even ordinary ink can be obtained at any photographic chemist;\r\nbut if expense is a consideration, a simple method is to obtain lantern\r\nslide cover-glasses, which cost a few pence the dozen, make a solution\r\nwith one per cent. of Nelson’s photographic gelatine in warm water,\r\napply this to the cover-glasses with a sponge or soft cloth, and in a\r\nfew minutes they will be dry and will take pen-writing admirably. The\r\ncover-glasses can be cleaned after use, re-coated, and used again as\r\noften as necessary. For general illustrative lantern slides it is very\r\nuseful to take out a subscription with one of the circulating\r\ncollections of lantern slides, as E. G. Wood’s in Cheapside. These issue\r\ncatalogues which may be lent to prospective lecturers, who may then draw\r\nupon these collections. The accessibility of slides often secures a\r\nlecturer. Librarians can use slides in a number of ways, to illustrate\r\ncontents of books, the differing character and scope of works of\r\nreference, and bring home the use of books in a way that no other method\r\ncan be made to do. So far we do not know of a library that has a\r\ncinematograph installation; but some libraries already collect films,\r\nand the uses of the cinematograph will one day be recognized. The most\r\nvaluable projection apparatus of all is the epidiascope, which projects\r\nillustrations, pages of books, and solid objects from these actual\r\nthings, and does not require lantern slides. It is, however, rather\r\nexpensive, and requires skill in manipulation, but it would be an\r\nexcellent investment for any large library.\r\n\r\n\r\n=533. Privilege Issues.=--In order to bring readers to the books on any\r\nsubject while it is fresh in mind Mr Jast initiated a method of\r\nprivilege issue. The books on the subject of the lecture are displayed\r\non tables in the lecture-room, so that the audience may examine them\r\nbefore the lecture. On the tables is the following announcement:\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                 |\r\n  |              PRIVILEGE ISSUE.                   |\r\n  |                                                 |\r\n  | Any one of these books may be BORROWED WITHOUT  |\r\n  | A TICKET by any resident whose name appears in  |\r\n  | the local directory.                            |\r\n  |                                                 |\r\n  | To obtain a book, all that is necessary is that |\r\n  | the borrower shall sign his (or her) name and   |\r\n  | address on the slip provided.

The slip mentioned\r\nis of ordinary paper of a size suitable to be used in orthodox\r\ncard-charging, and plays the same part in the charge as a borrower’s\r\npermanent ticket. The book is stamped and issued to the applicant in the\r\nusual way, and a long narrow slip bearing the following text is\r\ninserted:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  |                   PRIVILEGE ISSUE.                   |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  | This book is issued on the distinct understanding    |\r\n  | that it is returned to one of the Lending Libraries  |\r\n  | within 15 days. Or, if kept longer, the Library fine |\r\n  | of 1d. per week (or portion of a week) for such      |\r\n  | detention will be paid, together with any cost of    |\r\n  | notification; also that any damage or loss will be   |\r\n  | made good.                                           |\r\n  |                                                      |\r\n  | This being a “privilege” issue, it does not entitle  |\r\n  | the reader to another book in exchange.

The charges when\r\nmade are inserted into the ordinary sequence of the day’s issues, and\r\nthere is no distinction between them and the card charges made for\r\nregular borrowers’ books. This privilege service was extended to\r\naccredited societies in the town, who undertook to issue and to secure\r\nthe due return of the books. So far we know of only two libraries that\r\nhave adopted the system of privilege issues; but it has been successful,\r\nand has not, so far, entailed any loss of books.\r\n\r\n\r\n=534. General.=--Lecturers should be reminded of their engagement a few\r\ndays before each lecture. Nothing should be taken for granted. The\r\nlecturer’s instructions should be gone over carefully, and the state of\r\nthe lantern screen, lantern, platform, signals and other accessories\r\nexamined in time for any fault to be corrected. Attention to such\r\ndetails makes for success, while nothing is more annoying to lecturer\r\nand audience than a fault in such things.\r\n\r\n\r\n=535. Library Readings.=--Library readings revive, in a manner, the once\r\nfamous popular penny readings; but in their new form such readings are\r\nfree and are of subjects chosen because of their value and not primarily\r\nbecause they entertain. It is found that audiences are not only ready to\r\nlisten to lectures about books, they are also ready to listen to\r\nreadings from the books themselves. For some years at Southwark Mr R. W.\r\nMould read _The Christmas Carol_ and other famous works aloud to large\r\naudiences of library people. There is scarcely any limit to books that\r\nmay be read aloud in this way--nearly all the novelists, poets,\r\nletter-writers, essayists, humorists, diarists can be used; and these\r\nare fairly easy for a good reader to deal with. But the reader must be a\r\ngood one; poor reading is worse than none. It is usual for the reader to\r\ngive a brief introductory sketch of his author, and to link the readings\r\nby connecting remarks. It is really remarkable to note the willingness\r\nof audiences to listen to readings of books which “everybody has read”;\r\nperhaps because they revive pleasant memories; probably, too, because\r\nthe reading reveals unsuspected qualities in the book read. A more\r\ndifficult, but even more interesting, type of reading may be made upon a\r\nsubject, which is explained and illustrated from various authors; for\r\nexample, on “Volcanoes, the genesis and development of scientific theory\r\nregarding them.” In this case an extract was read from Judd’s\r\n_Volcanoes_ defining a volcano and presenting the ideas of the Greeks\r\nupon the subject; then extracts from the two Plinys; then the mediæval\r\nviews were drawn from Pietro Toledo; Sir William Hamilton afforded an\r\naccount of Vesuvius in eruption in 1767; and later matter was drawn from\r\nElié de Beaumont, Scrope, Dana, Judd, Bonney, Anderson and Flint, and\r\nHeilprintz. Such a reading has proved most successful. These, too, can\r\nbe illustrated with lantern slides, and the obvious value of slides\r\nshowing titles, extracts, maps, etc., from books from which the readings\r\nare drawn need not be emphasized. The programme of a reading, given\r\nwith slides, may be subjoined to show another treatment of a subject:\r\n\r\n  THE ENGLISHMAN IN THE ALPS.\r\n\r\n  _Early Views._\r\n\r\n  1.

In it a party of readers, each taking a\r\ncharacter, read a play without scenery, costume, or action other than is\r\nnecessary to make clear a movement which the scene requires and the text\r\ndoes not convey. Such plays as Hardy’s _Dynasts_, most of Shakespeare’s\r\nplays, etc., have been dealt with in this manner; but the peculiar value\r\nof the dramatic reading is to draw attention to great plays, which are\r\nseldom read or performed, such as the miracle plays, the Elizabethans\r\nother than Shakespeare, and Browning’s various plays (for example); and\r\nseries by well-known writers who in individual manner deal with\r\nthe same subject, such as was done in a sequence of Cleopatra\r\nplays--Shakespeare’s _Antony and Cleopatra_, Dryden’s _All for Love_ and\r\nBernard Shaw’s _Cæsar and Cleopatra_--which were given in three\r\nsuccessive weeks with great success. All that has been said of the\r\nnecessity of focussing the work on the actual authors, plays, and works\r\nabout them by means of lists, applies as strongly here as elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n=537. Exhibitions.=---A few simple arrangements make the lecture-room\r\nconvenient for exhibitions of books, prints or other matter which it is\r\ndesirable to bring particularly to public notice. Stands on the model of\r\nthe standard newspaper slope illustrated in Fig. 166, but lighter, and\r\nmade in parts or collapsible, with a projecting bottom edge to support\r\nbooks or prints, and a wire stretched near the top to keep them in\r\nposition, have been used; and the walls can have run along them a narrow\r\nmoulding grooved to take the prints, with a taut wire, which can be made\r\nadjustable to any height, above them as on the slopes. With such an\r\narrangement a modest but effective exhibition can be made in a very\r\nshort time. It is thought by some that an open access library is itself\r\na book exhibition, but even with this system, and certainly with the\r\nindicator system, there are many things that can be exhibited with\r\nadvantage. Such works as Williams’s _History of the Art of Writing_, the\r\nfacsimiles published by the British Museum, and other large treasure\r\nhouses; photographic surveys; connected series of rare or interesting\r\nbooks; books on subjects of immediate interest, and so on, can all be\r\nexhibited to good result. Simple but careful guiding is desirable, and\r\nevery method of connecting the exhibition with the reading facilities of\r\nthe library must be brought into play. Usually the exhibitions can be\r\narranged from material in the library’s stock, but they may often be\r\nborrowed from national institutions, other libraries, and private\r\ncollectors. Whenever material is borrowed an insurance policy should be\r\narranged covering loss or damage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=538.= The warning is perhaps not unnecessary that the library is\r\nneither museum nor art gallery; and exhibitions which trespass upon the\r\nfield of these institutions should only be arranged in towns where they\r\ndo not exist; and even then a certain restraint should be observed; but\r\ncircumstances will determine this question. If the exhibition leads to\r\nthe use of books, it is justified; if not, the library is doing work\r\nwhich is not properly in its province.\r\n\r\n\r\n=539. Reading Circles, etc.=--Reading circles in connexion with the\r\nNational Home Reading Union and similar bodies, or arranged locally,\r\npresent special opportunities for libraries, and are to be encouraged.\r\nGood leaders can be obtained in most towns; books on the subjects\r\ndiscussed can be made available in the room where the circle meets, and\r\nin various ways the library can help effectively. One or two libraries\r\nhave literary societies of the debating kind; but these are more\r\ndifficult to arrange.\r\n\r\n\r\n=540. General.=--The statement made in the last edition that all the\r\nwork described in this chapter is secondary to the main purpose of the\r\nlibrary is repeated. Its value has been proved and is indisputable, but\r\nit is easy for the enthusiastic librarian to involve himself and the\r\nlibrary in more of these activities than his own time, his staff, or his\r\nmeans justify. Only local circumstances and common sense can fix the\r\nlimits beyond which they ought not to be carried. Voluntary assistance,\r\nif it is forthcoming of sufficient and satisfactory quality, should be\r\nencouraged; but even here discretion is required. Moreover, certain good\r\nstandards for lectures, readings, etc., should be fixed; bad lectures\r\nand readings may do more harm than good, and only towns with many good\r\nreaders amongst the people should attempt work so full of chance as\r\ndramatic readings. Excellent and much to be desired in their right\r\nmeasure and kind, all extension activities should be pursued with\r\nconsidered moderation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=541.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  No monograph.

The Need, and Earlier Schemes.=--Until recently a rural dweller in\r\nCanada, the United States, and some parts of Australia was better\r\nprovided with literature than the villager in the United Kingdom. It is\r\ntrue that private generosity had established village libraries and\r\ncirculating collections of books in several counties; and honourable\r\nmention may be made of the schemes of the Union of Lancashire and\r\nCheshire Institutes, 1847; the Yorkshire Union of Educational\r\nInstitutes, 1854; the Central Circulating Library, 1888; the Bishop of\r\nHereford, 1906; the Dorset Book-Lending Association, 1908; and the\r\nextensive scheme for the Highlands and Hebrides of Mr James Coats of\r\nPaisley; as also Sir Charles Seeley’s scheme for the Isle of Wight, and\r\nthe Westmorland scheme, which are both, however, public ventures worked\r\nthrough the County Council in the first case, and, in the second,\r\nthrough the Kendal Public Library. All of these (except the Coats\r\nscheme) work on the sound method of dispatching to selected (and, in\r\nsome of the private instances, subscribing) centres boxes of books which\r\nare changed twice or thrice yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=543.= The private schemes, effective as they are, are unable to supply\r\nthat co-ordinated service which may be expected from a state, or rate,\r\nmaintained service; and as a whole the rural population is unprovided as\r\nyet. Although the need for general library provision has been abundantly\r\nrecognized, the imagination of British legislators seems to have been\r\nunable to compass anything practical towards meeting it. The reasons for\r\nlack of village libraries turn upon the small product of the penny rate,\r\nwhich in an average population of 400--a frequent population figure for\r\na village--rarely exceeds £10 yearly, a sum manifestly inadequate to\r\nprovide or maintain a library. Ignorance of even this possibility and\r\nthe traditional apathy or actual hostility of squire and parson, at\r\nleast until lately, to any scheme of rural enlightenment may also have\r\nbeen factors; but, however that may be, in 1915 only seventy-six out of\r\nall the parishes of the kingdom had libraries working under the Acts.\r\nCo-operation alone can produce for these scattered populations the\r\nbenefits of a sound service; but although the Libraries Acts (1892,\r\nSections 9-10; 1893, Section 4) permit the co-operation of neighbouring\r\nurban districts or parishes for the provision of libraries, the method\r\nhas been resorted to only occasionally, as at Workington and Harrington\r\nin Cumberland, where some such combination exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n=544. The County Council as Library Authority.=--The obvious authority\r\nto establish and administer rural libraries is the County Council; but\r\nthere is no explicit legislative instruction, or even permission, for\r\nthem to do so. The Carnegie United Kingdom Trust has given careful and\r\nsympathetic attention to this problem, and to this body the recent rapid\r\ndevelopment of rural libraries is due. Acting on a recommendation of\r\nProfessor W. G. S. Adams, in his valuable _Report on Library Provision\r\nand Policy_, 1915, that experimental library systems should be\r\nestablished in five selected areas in different parts of the kingdom,\r\nthe Trustees invited certain County Councils through their education\r\ncommittees, and certain towns well placed in regard to surrounding rural\r\ndistricts, to accept grants for such work. Professor Adams advised the\r\nprovision of (1) a central library, from which the books could be\r\ndistributed at regular intervals, and from which also there should be\r\nsupervision of the whole area; (2) village libraries, usually placed in\r\na school, with the schoolmaster as librarian, and consisting of a\r\npermanent collection of important reference and standard works, and a\r\ncirculating library which would be exchanged at three-monthly or other\r\nsuitable intervals. The first areas chosen were Staffordshire as a\r\ncounty; Worksop, Nottinghamshire, as a town centred amongst villages;\r\nand the Trustees themselves established at the public library of their\r\nown centre, Dunfermline, a system to deal with the Orkneys, Shetland and\r\nthe island of Lewis, and to reinforce by circulating collections the\r\nCoats libraries in other districts. The scheme has developed rapidly,\r\nand at the time of writing the counties of Dorset, Gloucester, Lincoln,\r\nNottingham, Somerset, Stafford, Warwick, Westmorland, Wilts, York,\r\nMontgomery, Brecon, Buckingham, Cardigan, Carnarvon, Forfar, Lewis,\r\nOrkney and Shetland, Perth, Kerry and Limerick are all administering, or\r\nhave accepted, grants for rural libraries. The grants range in amount\r\nfrom about £3000 to £7000 each, and are initial and experimental; that\r\nis to say, the sum provided is intended to establish and maintain the\r\nlibrary system for a space of five years, after which it is expected\r\nthat they will be administered entirely from county funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n=545. The Methods of Carnegie Rural Libraries.=--It is too early yet to\r\nassess the results of these schemes or to expatiate with any certainty\r\nupon their methods; but an account of the administration of the Trust’s\r\nown scheme for the North of Scotland may be taken as typical, because,\r\nwith the necessary variations imposed, or considered desirable, in the\r\nvarious county schemes, it is the standard for them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n=546. The Central Repository.=--At the central repository the books are\r\ncollected, classified, catalogued, dispatched and received; and\r\naccommodation sufficient for these purposes is provided. The extent of\r\nthe initial stock, which is intended later to be fully representative of\r\nEnglish and translated foreign literature, literature in Gaelic, local\r\nindustries, science, history and topography, is such as to provide a\r\ncollection of about seventy-five books for each centre to be served; and\r\nthe travelling collections consist in equal proportions of general\r\nworks, fiction for adult readers, and literature for children. Later,\r\nhowever, the selection will be influenced largely by the demands made by\r\nthe local librarians. In the first case collections were exchanged twice\r\nyearly. Certain current periodicals, not returnable, were also sent out\r\nin boxes.\r\n\r\nACCESSION.--A slip suggestions record is used, one slip being written\r\nfor each title; and from this the order list is compiled. Both order and\r\nslips are stamped with the date of the order, and when the books are\r\nreceived and found to be correct the slips are stamped with the date of\r\nreceipt. The slips are then filed to form a continuous catalogue of\r\naccessions. Accessioning is done the ordinary way; all books are stamped\r\nthroughout with a rubber-stamp impression of the name of the Trust; and\r\nthe board label reads thus:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                        |\r\n  |            RURAL LIBRARIES.            |\r\n  |                                        |\r\n  | Readers are requested to take great    |\r\n  | care of the books while in their       |\r\n  | possession, and to point out any       |\r\n  | defect they may notice in them to the  |\r\n  | librarian.                             |\r\n  |                                        |\r\n  | All books should be returned to the    |\r\n  | Library within 14 days from date of    |\r\n  | issue; but an extension of the period  |\r\n  | of loan will be granted when desired.  |\r\n  |                                        |\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nFIG. 181.--Rural Library Board Label (Section 546).\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.--The Decimal classification is used, to two places for\r\ngeneral works, and to four places for works on specific subjects; this\r\nenables a fairly minute arrangement. The common adjustments are made of\r\nremoving Fiction and Biography from 900, and arranging the former in\r\nalphabetical-author order, and the latter alphabetically by persons\r\nbiographed.\r\n\r\nCATALOGUING.--A simple form of classified catalogue, with author and\r\nsubject indexes, is used; and the date of publication is omitted from\r\nthe bibliographical particulars, as the latest editions are always to be\r\npresumed. Complete catalogues in this form are eventually to be sent to\r\nall centres, but meanwhile separate typed lists, covering each\r\ncollection, are sent out with the collection.\r\n\r\nCENTRAL CHARGING.--The method of charging books to the various centres\r\nis simple. A card index in the usual form is drawn upon, the cards for\r\neach consignment of books being abstracted and placed behind a guide\r\nbearing the name of the centre. A date guide is inserted when the\r\ndispatch is made, and the “deliveries index” thus made forms a\r\nconvenient guide to the books at any given centre, and, of course, is a\r\nmeans by which returned books are checked.\r\n\r\nDISPATCHES.--Books are dispatched in boxes, specially constructed in\r\ndeal, 18 × 12 × 12 inches inside measurements, which hold about\r\nforty-five volumes. They are banded with hoop iron, which is secured by\r\nscrew-in iron bolts, and iron bars, screwing with nuts to the bolts,\r\nsecure the lid. The interior is lined with waterproof paper; and flush\r\nhandles are fitted to each box. The design is intended to meet the very\r\nrough usage probable in transit to remote districts. In ordinary rural\r\nservice a much lighter box, of three-ply wood, has been found to be\r\nquite suitable. It is probably better, too, to have smaller boxes, as\r\nthe handling of heavy boxes of books is a difficulty for both carrier\r\nand librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n=547. The Village Centres.=--LOCAL ADMINISTRATION.--The local\r\nadministration of the libraries is in the hands of central committees\r\nformed of members of secondary education and library committees, and\r\nother interested people, with the librarians of the towns in the area as\r\nsecretaries. These committees cover each a number of parishes, and for\r\nthe immediate supervision of the parishes local sub-committees of\r\nmembers of school boards, teachers, etc., have been formed, and of these\r\nthe schoolmaster is generally the secretary and local custodian of the\r\nbooks. These committees advise on book requirements and on such matters\r\nas shelving, etc.; central committees are also expected to raise the\r\nsmall funds for the conveyance of the books. The average library finds\r\naccommodation in the schools, and permanent collections, which include\r\nthe more expensive and general reference books, are deposited in village\r\ninstitutes and existing Carnegie public libraries. Schools requiring\r\nshelves are supplied with deal cases, having five adjustable shelves,\r\nand a book-capacity of 150 volumes.\r\n\r\nCHARGING.--The record of stock in use at the centres is on cards which\r\nare sent out in their card-case from the central repository. These\r\ncard-cases are of cloth over strawboard, hold approximately 150 cards,\r\nare 8 × 5½ inches in size, and are made in the shape of an ordinary\r\nsquare-backed book-cover, with eyelet holes below the hinge through\r\nwhich cords are laced on which the cards are secured. Inside these cases\r\nthe cards for each consignment of books are arranged in classified\r\norder. The card used is as shown on page 482 (Figs. 182 and 183).\r\n\r\nWhen books are received at the local centre the librarian checks them\r\nwith the cards and arranges them in the order of the cards on the\r\nshelves. The charging method is obvious. The charge is made under the\r\nname of the author, particulars of readers and date of issue and return\r\nbeing entered in the appropriate columns, the word “adult” being written\r\nin the age column for readers obviously over twenty-one. The charges are\r\nreturned to the repository at the exchange periods, and these enable\r\nstatistics to be made.\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | Library ..............................

Museum of Rural Library Appliances.=--The above are, in brief, the\r\nchief features of the North of Scotland scheme, which seems to be\r\nserving its purpose admirably; and in connexion with it the Trust is\r\nbuilding up at Dunfermline a small museum of rural library appliances,\r\nto include different types of boxes, forms, and other machinery tried in\r\nthe various centres. This valuable work will in time furnish librarians\r\nwith a considerable amount of important and useful data.\r\n\r\n\r\n=549. Other Schemes=.--As the North of Scotland scheme is continuing in\r\nthe control of the Carnegie Trust, it is on a rather different footing\r\nfrom the county schemes, which are in the control of the county\r\neducation committee. In general, however, the methods are the same.\r\nThere is a central repository where books are selected, catalogued,\r\ndispatched, and overhauled on return, and where reading courses, special\r\ncatalogues, etc., may be prepared; indeed, whence skilled advice and\r\nassistance may be drawn by all the village centres. And, as recommended\r\nby Professor Adams, local village schools are the deposit centres, with\r\nschoolmasters as a rule for librarians. The smaller towns have in some\r\nplaces made arrangements by which they amalgamate or co-operate with\r\ncounty schemes, but the larger towns usually work independently.\r\n\r\nA rough estimate of the cost of an actual rural library scheme founded\r\non a Carnegie grant may be given:\r\n\r\n  Capital expenditure:\r\n      Repository, building          £800\r\n      Books                         2100\r\n      Boxes                          140\r\n      Accessories                    100\r\n      Initial clerical labour        100\r\n                                    ----\r\n                                           £3240\r\n                                           =====\r\n\r\n  Annual expenditure:\r\n      Salary of librarian           £180\r\n      Clerical assistance             50\r\n      Heating, lighting, cleaning     50\r\n      Rates and taxes                 25\r\n      Carriage of books              100\r\n      Repairs, etc.                   25\r\n                                    ----    £430\r\n  Ultimate additional annual cost:\r\n    Repairs and renewals             160\r\n                                    ----     160\r\n                                            ----\r\n                                            £590\r\n                                            ====\r\n\r\nThus the annual cost of the scheme after the initial expenses have been\r\nmet is reckoned at £590, but the salary allowed here is inadequate. It\r\nis at this point that the legal powers of the County Councils may be\r\ntested. It is difficult to imagine the Local Government Board auditor\r\nruling that they cannot provide such library maintenance out of\r\neducation funds because the Education Act of 1918 does not mention it\r\n(although the Scottish Act of 1918 does, and permits it), but the matter\r\nhas not been questioned yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=550. General Considerations.=--Every librarian will see the\r\npotentialities of this work, as completing in a large measure the public\r\nlibrary system of the country; moreover, its rapid and successful\r\ndevelopment is an earnest of the immense future of libraries as a whole.\r\nBy co-ordinating this village work with such educational agencies as\r\nUniversity Extension, and the Workers’ Educational Association, it will\r\nbe possible to give to rural life many of the intellectual advantages\r\nhitherto exclusively the possession, for the non-wealthy classes, of\r\ntown life, and this at a time when settlement on the land is proceeding\r\napace. Meanwhile the supervising rural librarian may make regular visits\r\nthroughout his area, in which he will give advice on reading,\r\ndemonstrations in the use and care of books, and exercise the undoubted\r\nopportunities he will have of bringing people of like intellectual\r\npursuits, but in different villages, into touch with one another. All\r\nthis presupposes the existence of a professional librarian in control\r\nof the entire scheme. An initial mistake has been made in some counties\r\nin appointing teachers to this position, on the theory, no doubt, that\r\nthe training of teachers is a very suitable basis for work with\r\nlibraries which are locally administered by teachers. It may be so--the\r\nevidence is not yet forthcoming--but we do not think so. Library\r\norganization, especially at the outset, demands the specialist, and the\r\nlibrarian differs radically in training and mental attitude from the\r\nteacher. Further, the salaries hitherto offered have ranged from £150 to\r\n£300 per annum--have in only one case reached the higher figure--and\r\nthese sums must be augmented considerably if the rural libraries are to\r\nattract and retain the librarians they really need.\r\n\r\n\r\n=551.= BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n  Adams, W.

The British Museum was at one time a\r\nuniversal collection, but since it was divided into art, ethnological,\r\nnatural history and industrial departments, it no longer forms a general\r\ncollection under one roof. Soane’s Museum in Lincoln’s Inn Fields,\r\nLondon, is a general museum, and there are many others in the provinces.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MUSEUMS.--Collections illustrative of the arts, manufactures,\r\nantiquities, literature and history of a nation. These range in extent\r\nfrom the great German, Hungarian and French museums, down to museums of\r\nnational antiquities, like those of the Societies of Antiquaries of\r\nEngland, Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE MUSEUMS.--Comprising Anatomical, Botanical, Geological,\r\nChemical, Physical, General Natural History, Astronomical, Ethnological\r\nand other varieties. Typical examples are the Hunterian Museum of\r\nAnatomy at the Royal College of Surgeons, London; the Herbarium at Kew;\r\nthe Museum of Practical Geology; the Pharmaceutical Society; the Natural\r\nHistory Museum at South Kensington; the United Service Museum (Naval and\r\nMilitary) at Whitehall; and the historical collections of the British\r\nMuseum which include Ethnology.\r\n\r\nLOCAL MUSEUMS.--These are to be found in all parts of the country, and\r\nthey usually serve to illustrate and preserve the natural history and\r\nantiquities of a particular district; and they differ from national\r\nmuseums, in being restricted to a particular locality.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MUSEUMS.--Of these there is practically no end. They have been\r\nformed to illustrate certain restricted departments of science, art or\r\nhistory, such as Hygiene, Numismatics, Watch-making, Heraldry, Costume,\r\netc., and they resemble exhibitions of a special kind, save that they\r\nare permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=553.= Generally speaking, a museum is a collection of the objects which\r\ngo towards the formation of a subject, just as a library is a collection\r\nof the literature connected with a subject or subjects. The museum is\r\nnecessary to the material conception of a subject, just as literature is\r\nessential as the permanent record of the subject. For example, in\r\ntracing the evolution of the printed book from its manuscript forms, one\r\ncan form an idea of the appearance of such books by reading up the\r\nrelative literature, and examining a few facsimiles, and so on; but, in\r\norder to realize in a perfect way the aspect, atmosphere and details of\r\nearly writing and printing, one must go to the great exhibitions or\r\nmuseums of such books at the British Museum or John Rylands Library,\r\nManchester. It is the same with machinery. While a diagram of a machine\r\nas it appears in a book may be comprehensible to a few specially\r\neducated minds, it would be a mere puzzle to an ordinary human being\r\nunless he could go to a museum like that at South Kensington and see a\r\nworking model of the machine in operation. He could then realize in a\r\npractical and concrete way the merely graphic or theoretical view\r\nafforded by the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n=554.= All the great State museums in the country have been established\r\nunder the provisions of special Acts of Parliament. Some of these, like\r\nthe various acts establishing the British Museum, date from the\r\neighteenth century, while others are much more recent. It is not\r\nproposed to deal with the legislation and history of the State museums,\r\nnor is it necessary to do more than describe, later on, their relations\r\nwith the municipal museums which may now be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=555.= In 1845 was passed the first Museums Act (8 & 9 Vict., c. 43)\r\n“for encouraging the establishment of museums in large towns,” under\r\nwhich the local authorities of towns over 10,000 of population were\r\npermitted to erect museums and levy a halfpenny rate. No specimens could\r\nbe bought, but an entrance fee of 1d. could be charged. This Act was\r\npractically inoperative, as only Canterbury, Warrington, Leicester,\r\nDover, Salford and a few other places adopted it, and in 1850 it was\r\nincorporated in the first Public Libraries Act, 1850 (13 & 14 Vict., c.\r\n65), which repealed it and added the permissive clauses which existed\r\ntill 1893. This Act in its turn was repealed by that of 1855, and again\r\nthis was repealed by the Public Library Act of 1892 and subsequent\r\namendments, which remain the leading Acts under which libraries may be\r\nestablished, with such subsidiary departments as museums and art\r\ngalleries. A digest of the powers conferred on local authorities by\r\nthose various Acts appears in Section 4 of this _Manual_. The\r\nauthorities seem to have become aware of the difficulty of supporting so\r\nmany institutions out of one restricted rate, because in 1891 was passed\r\n“An Act to enable Urban Authorities to provide and maintain Museums and\r\nGymnasiums.” Under this Act, which did not apply to Scotland or the\r\nCounty of London, but only to England and Ireland, local authorities\r\nwere enabled to levy a special rate of ½d. per pound for museum\r\npurposes, and a rate of ½d. per pound for gymnasium purposes, and to\r\nmake regulations for the purposes of both kinds of institutions. In 1901\r\nthis Act was extended to the County of London by the “Public Libraries\r\nAct, 1901.” A resolution of the local authority is sufficient for the\r\npurpose of adopting this Act, and the regulations for adoption are\r\nsimilar to those prescribed for the Public Libraries Acts. The principal\r\nclauses of the Act are as follows:\r\n\r\n_Clause 4._--“An urban authority may provide and maintain museums for\r\nthe reception of local antiquities or other objects of interest, and\r\ngymnasiums with all the apparatus ordinarily used therewith, and may\r\nerect any buildings, and generally do all things necessary for the\r\nprovision and maintenance of such museums and gymnasiums.”\r\n\r\n_Clause 5._--“A museum provided under this Act shall be open to the\r\npublic not less than three days in every week free of charge, but\r\nsubject thereto an urban authority may admit any person or class of\r\npersons thereto as they think fit, and may charge fees for such\r\nadmission, or may grant the use of the same or of any room therein,\r\neither gratuitously or for payment, to any person for any lecture or\r\nexhibition or for any purpose of education or instruction. . . .”\r\n\r\nFull power is given by other clauses to make all necessary regulations\r\nas to hours, staff, order, etc., in both museums and gymnasiums, and for\r\nborrowing money for buildings or other purposes.\r\n\r\nSeparate accounts are to be kept, and “The amount expended by an urban\r\nauthority under this Act shall not in any year exceed the amount\r\nproduced by a rate of a halfpenny in the pound for a museum, and the\r\nlike amount for a gymnasium established under this Act.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=556.= A new provision in legislation of this kind is contained in\r\nClause 12, which empowers an urban authority to _sell_ a museum or\r\ngymnasium after seven years’ trial, if it is deemed unnecessary or too\r\nexpensive, but only with the consent of the Local Government Board. Any\r\nmoneys received from such sale are to be applied, in the first instance,\r\nto the repayment of loans, and if not all required for such a purpose,\r\nmay, with the approval of the Local Government Board, “be applied to any\r\npurpose to which capital moneys are properly applicable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=557.= It is further provided (Clause 13) that the powers given to urban\r\nauthorities under the Act “shall be deemed to be in addition to and not\r\nin derogation of any other powers conferred by Act of Parliament, law,\r\nor custom, and such other powers may be exercised in the same manner as\r\nif this Act had not been passed.” In other words, the powers conferred\r\nby the “Public Libraries Acts,” for example, with regard to museums,\r\nstill hold good, and the new powers created by the “Museums and\r\nGymnasiums Act” can be exercised as an addition to them. It should be\r\nnoted that, in addition to the general legislation contained in the\r\nPublic Libraries and Museums Acts, many private or local Acts have been\r\npassed, under which different localities have obtained power to spend\r\nmoney on the provision of museums and art galleries, greatly in excess\r\nof the limits imposed by the general Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=558.= This represents practically the whole of the legislation\r\nconnected with municipal museums, and it may be inferred, from the\r\nfinancial provision allowed by Parliament, that no museum which depends\r\nentirely upon the halfpenny rate can be in a very flourishing condition.\r\nThe deficiencies of the rate-income are in many cases made up by the\r\ndonations and bequests of private donors; occasionally public bodies\r\nrender valuable aid; not infrequently the closely restricted library\r\nrate is nibbled at and diverted from its real purpose; and very often\r\nthe State, represented by the Victoria and Albert Museums at South\r\nKensington, circulates useful and valuable loan collections. In these\r\nvarious ways museums are helped, and within the past few years, or since\r\nthe Museums Association was established in 1890, the organization,\r\nscientific value and equipment of museums have improved in a very marked\r\ndegree. No doubt in some localities can still be seen the old-fashioned\r\nhotch-potch collection of miscellaneous lumber styled a museum, wherein\r\na stuffed walrus jostles a suit of armour, and local fossils and\r\nmeteorites are beautifully mixed up with birds’ eggs, flint implements\r\nand coins. Such collections only require an alligator, and a canoe from\r\nFiji on the walls, to be perfect specimens of the Wardour Street kind of\r\nmuseum. Happily this kind of omnium-gatherum museum is rapidly dying out\r\nbefore the advance of rational classification, and in some cases where\r\ncollections are small and contained in one room, yet by means of\r\nintelligent arrangement incongruous objects are kept apart, and the\r\nlittle museum is made an instructive nucleus, instead of a high-class\r\nmarine-store.\r\n\r\n=559.= This leads to such questions as the elements of museum\r\nclassification and description, which are the most important points in\r\nthe relations between libraries and schools and museums. Without\r\nclassification a general or even special museum is comparatively\r\nuseless. Without effective arrangement and descriptive labelling the\r\nspecimens remain uninstructive and misleading. On these two points\r\nmuseums resemble libraries, and it is only when they agree in the\r\nessentials of classification and description that the institutions\r\nbecome mutually beneficial. A well-classified and arranged cabinet of\r\nminerals, with a full set of descriptive labels, is simply invaluable to\r\nthe student of mineralogy and geology. When, therefore, a student is\r\nreferred from the literature to the objects described in the text-books,\r\nhe is educated to the extent of being able to appreciate the fact that\r\nobjects are grouped together in respect of certain resemblances, and\r\nthat classification into related groups is the basis of the science he\r\nis studying. On going to a museum of specimens, such a student, if he\r\nwere an entomologist, would naturally expect to find together all the\r\nbutterflies, bees, beetles, flies and other objects properly classified\r\naccording to order, genera and species. If he found all the moths, bugs,\r\nflies and beetles mingled in one huge jumble, and labelled Insects, the\r\ncollection would be uninstructive and would throw no light on his\r\nprevious reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n=560.= Whatever set of concrete objects a student sets out to examine in\r\na museum, after being referred from his books, he expects to find some\r\nrelationship between the literature he has studied and the objects he\r\nmeans to compare and examine. On this principle all the large museums of\r\nthe world are arranged, and the result is that no student who has\r\npreviously acquired an elementary knowledge of an art or science from\r\ntext-books should experience any difficulty in finding his way about a\r\nmuseum. It is true that, for purposes of popular display and to tickle\r\nup juvenile interest in natural history, some museums exhibit fine\r\nspecimens of birds or mammals out of their order, where they will\r\nattract notice, but the bulk of the collection will be found in strictly\r\nclassified order. In many important museums it has been found useful to\r\nillustrate animal structure and comparative anatomy by means of key or\r\ntype collections, which are kept apart from the genera classification,\r\nyet serve to illustrate important points in comparative zoology, which\r\nit would be difficult to do on a very extensive scale. There are many\r\ntext-books written exactly on the same principle. One author takes a\r\nrabbit, another a crayfish, and from these bases teach the main facts of\r\nanimal structure which apply all round. So in a museum. While it would\r\nbe absolutely impossible to repeat at every centre such a fine\r\ncollection of minerals as has been gathered together at the Natural\r\nHistory Museum at South Kensington, yet it is possible to illustrate the\r\nmain facts and classification of mineralogy by means of a selection of\r\nactual specimens or models. Similarly at the British Museum, the student\r\nof early printing does not find himself confronted with a complete\r\nchronological sequence of all the books printed in the fifteenth century\r\nto illustrate the incunabula, but he finds a selection, or type\r\ncollection, which in the most effectual way traces the development and\r\nevolution of the printed book. The more these type collections are\r\nadopted and utilized, the greater will become the value of museums for\r\nelementary science teaching, and as most museums are unable to collect\r\nand display specimens of _everything_ in the world, it is obvious that\r\nthey must do as libraries have to do--select only what is best, most\r\ntypical and instructive, and leave indiscriminate collecting to the\r\ngreat universal museums supported by the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n=561.= A well-arranged and classified museum, whether of a general\r\ncharacter, or which is confined to local botany, zoology, geology and\r\narchæology, has great bearing on the educational work of public\r\nlibraries. It enables a reader to _realize_ the material side of his\r\nstudies, and by showing him related objects in a definite order,\r\nbroadens his outlook on the subject, and brings home to him the reality\r\nof the matter. As object-lessons are to school-children, so are museums\r\nto library readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=562.= Art galleries are divisible into three classes--1. Those\r\nmaintained or assisted by the State=the National Gallery; Scottish\r\nNational Art Gallery, etc. 2. Those endowed by private munificence or by\r\npublic bodies=the Wallace Collection; Tate Gallery; the Walker Art\r\nGallery, Liverpool, the Harris Art Gallery, Preston, etc. 3. Those\r\nmaintained from local rates levied under special Acts of Parliament; or,\r\nunder the Public Libraries Acts, which empower local authorities to\r\nsupport art galleries out of the penny rate. There is no special Act for\r\nthe establishment of art galleries similar to the Museums Act already\r\ndescribed, and apart from special Acts, the Public Libraries Acts are\r\nthe only ones which empower the establishment of art galleries. Needless\r\nto say, such powers are rarely exercised unless other sources of\r\nendowment or income are forthcoming. So many single pictures cost more\r\nthan the produce of a penny rate in most towns, that it is, on the face\r\nof it, absurd to think of art galleries only as departments of public\r\nlibraries. In some cases part of the library rate is no doubt used to\r\ndefray part of the expenses of art galleries, particularly buildings,\r\nbut it is very unusual to purchase pictures from such a meagre fund. Art\r\ngalleries are greatly assisted by loan exhibitions contributed to by\r\nartists, picture owners, both public and private, and the national art\r\nauthorities acting through the Victoria and Albert Museum at South\r\nKensington. Annually the South Kensington authorities lend to over 400\r\nmuseums, exhibitions, schools of art and science, etc., no fewer than\r\n47,000 objects, of which 46,000 are works of art, including pictures,\r\nembroideries, photographs, metal-work, pottery, etc. But for these\r\ncirculating collections, comparatively few of the smaller art galleries\r\nof the country could keep alive interest simply by means of their own\r\npermanent collections. It is only in large towns, like London,\r\nEdinburgh, Dublin, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, etc., where great and\r\nrepresentative collections are kept illustrating the leading schools of\r\nart, that any direct educational value can be said to attach to art\r\ngalleries. So far as educational value is concerned, an art gallery\r\ncannot for a moment be compared to a museum or a library. Its appeal on\r\nthe educational side is to a very small section of the public, and even\r\nto this section such appeal is limited by the size and character of the\r\ncollection. The student of early Italian or Flemish painting can learn\r\nnothing in a little provincial art gallery, containing fifty or sixty\r\nmodern landscapes and figure subjects; and the student of Impressionist\r\npainting will not find much to help him in a gallery composed of\r\nexamples of old Dutch and French masters. The value of an art gallery\r\ndepends, therefore, on its size and representative nature so far as art\r\nstudents are concerned, and on the appeal which fine paintings make to\r\nthe higher feelings and perceptions of mankind for its influence as a\r\ncreator of taste and stimulator of a love of the beautiful. When an art\r\ncollection takes the form of a special exhibition illustrative of a\r\nsubject, rather than a particular school of painting, its value and\r\ninterest are enormously increased. Suppose, for example, that an art\r\ngallery is devoted to an exhibition illustrative of some great\r\nhistorical subject, like the career of Napoleon I. The value of the\r\npictorial side of the subject at once stands forth with great\r\nprominence, and one can realize the educational value of art in the\r\nexposition of history. But in a mere random collection of pictures, on\r\nall kinds of subjects, by all kinds of painters, there is no kind of\r\nconsecutive teaching or definite connexion with the art literature\r\ncontained in a library, and, therefore, such a miscellaneous selection\r\nof pictures is chiefly valuable as a kind of vague appeal to the\r\næsthetic feelings of the casual observer. Only great collections like\r\nthose of the National Gallery in London, and the Louvre at Paris, can be\r\nsaid to illustrate the literature of art, and it is chiefly in regard to\r\nsuch art galleries that some direct connexion can be traced between art\r\ncollections and libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n=563.

Stanley Jast and W. C. Berwick Sayers\r\n       to the Congrès International des Archivistes et des\r\n       Bibliothécaires, Bruxelles, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n=564.= It will be difficult but it is desirable to attempt to resolve\r\nsome order out of the terminological chaos at present existing.\r\n\r\nThe British Government has many library positions in its control, but\r\nthe term librarian is only sparingly recognized. There are “librarians”\r\nof the two Houses of Parliament, the British Museum, the Board of\r\nEducation, Admiralty, Patent Office and other Government departments,\r\nbut only in the Houses of Parliament are there any assistant-librarians\r\nso-named. The heads of departments in the British Museum are called\r\n“keepers,” a traditional term, and the assistant librarians “Assistants\r\nin the Department of Printed Books” or “Manuscripts,” as the case may\r\nbe, which as a term in no way connects them with librarianship. In the\r\nPatent Office the term “Custodian” was formerly employed, but was\r\ndropped some eight years ago for “Assistant in the Library.” In the\r\nother Government or Civil Service libraries the assistant librarian is\r\nusually rated and named as a first- or second-class clerk, as the case\r\nmay be. It would be greatly to the advantage of librarianship if a\r\nproper Government recognition of the term librarian as representing a\r\nspecially trained type of man rather than the occupant of a certain\r\nposition could be obtained. At present it seems that clerks in any\r\nGovernment office possessing a library can be moved from the office\r\nproper to the library, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=565.= In municipal and similar public libraries the chaos is even more\r\npronounced. The principal officer calls himself Chief, Principal, Head,\r\nBorough or City Librarian, or merely Librarian. Often the term Chief\r\nLibrarian is adopted where the owner of the name is the only librarian\r\non the staff, and the term “Chief” in these circumstances is\r\nmeaningless.\r\n\r\n\r\n=567.= In the nomenclature of assistant librarians the confusion is\r\nworse still. The principal assistant to the librarian is called the\r\nDeputy, Chief Assistant, Assistant- or Sub-Librarian in large libraries;\r\nbut the terminology is imitated by the smaller libraries, and it is no\r\nuncommon matter to hear of an assistant with a salary of £30 per annum\r\ncalled a “sub-librarian,” and “chief assistant” and similar terms are\r\nused very loosely to the bewilderment of library authorities, who find\r\nthat the Deputy Librarian of a great library like Birmingham holds\r\napparently the same position as the untrained lad in a village library.\r\n\r\n\r\n=568.= It is undoubtedly desirable to formulate a series of definitions\r\nwhich should govern the application of names to library positions. The\r\nresulting nomenclature if generally adopted would prevent the anomalies\r\nreferred to. No librarian should call himself a chief librarian unless\r\nhe directs the work of librarians; the adjective is distinctly a\r\nrelative term. Similarly a deputy- or a sub-librarian should be clearly\r\na librarian of some technical equipment and training though he does not\r\nhappen to hold an independent position. To apply this name to a young or\r\nboy assistant is undignified and is bound to cause confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n=569.= The following definitions are therefore tentatively recommended\r\nfor general adoption as solving the difficulties under consideration. At\r\nthe same time, human nature being what it is, we shall probably never do\r\naway altogether with a meaningless and inflated use of official terms in\r\nsmall libraries, and anything like a general adoption of our proposed\r\ndefinitions in the larger libraries is perhaps unlikely. Even so, the\r\nadoption of these or other definitions for all general statistical\r\npurposes would be of great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTED NOMENCLATURE AND DEFINITIONS OF LIBRARY POSITIONS\r\n\r\n_Chief Librarian._--The head librarian of a number of libraries, or a\r\nlibrary system, under the charge of “librarians.” In the case of a\r\nsingle large library (_e.g._ the British Museum), where the departmental\r\nchiefs may fitly be styled librarians, the term Chief Librarian may be\r\nused to designate the head; with such exception the term should never be\r\nemployed for the head of a single library.\r\n\r\n_Deputy Librarian._--The principal assistant to a Chief Librarian, whose\r\nwork belongs strictly to the general administration of a system. Not to\r\nbe confused with Sub-Librarian.\r\n\r\n_Librarian._--The head of a library. Not to be confused with Chief\r\nLibrarian, the head of a system of libraries.\r\n\r\n_Sub-Librarian._--The principal assistant to a librarian, whose work is\r\nindependent of departments, but not independent of a building. Not to be\r\nconfused with Deputy Librarian.\r\n\r\n_Librarian-in-Charge._--The officer in charge of a district or branch\r\nlibrary, or one of the departments of a central library, in a system\r\nunder the control of a Chief Librarian. Not to be confused with\r\nLibrarian.\r\n\r\n_Branch Librarian._--Term not to be used. See Librarian-in-Charge.\r\n\r\n_Chief Assistant._--An officer in charge of a department, subordinate to\r\na Sub-Librarian. If subordinate to a Deputy Librarian the corresponding\r\noffice would be Librarian-in-Charge.\r\n\r\n_Senior Assistant._--A higher grade of library assistant.\r\n\r\n_Junior Assistant._--A lower grade of library assistant.\r\n\r\n_Attendant._--A person who carries books, and performs other mechanical\r\nunskilled routine. If a youth, the term “page” may be used.\r\n\r\n_Janitor._--An officer (generally in uniform) whose principal duty is to\r\nmaintain order in the building.\r\n\r\n_Clerk._--A person employed in general clerking work, not a part of the\r\nprofessional library staff.\r\n\r\n_Probationer._--An assistant “on trial,” or not permanently appointed,\r\nwho may or may not be paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARIAN’S LIBRARY\r\n\r\n\r\n=570.= The following is a classified list of the principal books which a\r\nlibrarian will require as the chief tools of his profession. It does not\r\nclaim to be a complete bibliography, many valuable pamphlets and\r\npublications of institutions being omitted owing to limited space.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the works mentioned should be available for the benefit\r\nof the staff of the larger libraries, while two suggestive selections\r\nare indicated by asterisks as follows:\r\n\r\n** selection for a small library, income less than £1500.\r\n\r\n* selection for a medium library, income less than £3000.\r\n\r\n  Richard Wright.\r\n\r\n\r\n=571.= LIBRARY SCIENCE: BIBLIOGRAPHIES\r\n\r\n  **BROWN, J.
