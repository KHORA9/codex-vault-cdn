A piece will\r\nbe forwarded to Professor Brush, of Yale College, for analysis, and a\r\ndescription of the mass published in the Proceedings of the Academy, as\r\nsoon as the returns of the analysis have been received.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Reports of the officers of the Society for the past year\r\n(1862) were received, and the following is an abstract of their contents:\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Treasurer was read, and referred to the Finance\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Palæontology reported, that the number of specimens in\r\nthe collection is 1,007, exclusive of numerous duplicates. They are\r\nprincipally from the cretaceous and tertiary formations of the Pacific\r\ncoast. The collection has been rearranged in the course of the past year,\r\nand is now in as good condition as the accommodations of the Society will\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Botany reported, that 2,160 specimens were added to the\r\ncollection during the year 1862, making a total of 6,160 specimens in\r\nthe Academy’s herbarium. About twenty new specimens have been described\r\nin the Proceedings during the past year, and specimens and drawings of\r\nall of them have been placed in the collection. The herbarium is in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Entomology made a verbal report, to the effect that the\r\ncollections in his department, although small, are in good order; but\r\nthat few additions had been made during the year.\r\n\r\nIn the Zoological department, the Curator stated, that a few valuable\r\nadditions had been made to the collection during the year 1862; but that\r\nmuch difficulty was experienced in arranging them, from the limited\r\nspace and means of the Academy. The alcoholic specimens have not been\r\nrearranged during the year; some are in bad condition. All has been done\r\nwhich could be, towards preserving the specimens in this department, with\r\nthe means at the command of the Curator.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Curator of Conchology (Dr. Trask) it was stated,\r\nthat the collection of shells had been arranged, and labeled, and placed\r\nin cases during the year; the accommodations of the Academy, however, do\r\nnot admit of their being displayed.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Mineralogy (Mr. Hanks) has removed from the city since the\r\nlast annual meeting; but previous to removing, he had made considerable\r\nprogress in rearranging and labeling the collection of minerals and ores,\r\nand it is now in better order than it has ever before been.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian reported that valuable additions had been made to the\r\nLibrary during the past year; chiefly through the instrumentality of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. The books are in good order; but many of them\r\nneed binding, and the want of room renders it impossible to place them\r\nwhere they can be easily got at by the members.\r\n\r\nThe committee on nominations reported the following list of officers for\r\nthe year 1863, which was duly elected:\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n  COL. L. RANSOM.\r\n\r\nVICE PRESIDENTS.\r\n\r\n  J. N. ECKEL, M.D., J. B. TRASK, M.D.\r\n\r\nCORRESPONDING SECRETARY.\r\n\r\n  W. O. AYRES, M.D.\r\n\r\nRECORDING SECRETARY.\r\n\r\n  Prof. W. H.

BEHR, M.D.           Entomology.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet were received as follows:\r\n\r\nBy Dr. Cooper—Specimens of _Purpura septentrionalis_, from San Francisco,\r\nand others from Oakland, of larger size—the latter not being natives of\r\nthis Bay, but brought from Shoalwater Bay, W. T., in cargoes of oysters.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Bloomer—A collection of specimens of wood.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper exhibited a specimen of coral, of the genus _Porites_,\r\nprobably an undescribed species. This mass of coral was drawn up by a\r\nfisherman, from a depth of four fathoms, at the Farallones, and deposited\r\nin the office of the Geological Survey by Mr. Lawson, of the Coast\r\nSurvey. The same species had been previously obtained by Dr. Cooper in\r\nthe Bay of Monterey, but it had never been found so far north before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JANUARY 19TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nVice President, Dr. Trask, in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, eleven members.\r\n\r\nDr. W.

Cooper.\r\n\r\nThe Publishing Committee laid volume two of the Proceedings of the\r\nAcademy, for the years 1858-62, upon the table: it was ordered by the\r\nAcademy that one hundred copies be sold to the members at one dollar per\r\ncopy, and that fifty copies be presented to the Smithsonian Institution\r\nfor foreign distribution.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney read the following communication:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Inaccuracy of the Eighth Census, so far as it Relates to the\r\nMetallic and Mineral Statistics of the United States.\r\n\r\nBY J. D. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n    It has, for a long time, been a subject of regret, that our\r\n    United States Census returns are so imperfect; and that, in all\r\n    that relates to mining and metallurgy, they are especially and\r\n    extraordinarily unreliable. Mr. Kennedy’s “Preliminary Report\r\n    on the Eighth Census,” (1860), recently issued, is at hand,\r\n    and some remarks may here be made in reference to what appears\r\n    in it, which is connected with our mineral interests. It will\r\n    soon appear, from an examination of this public document, that\r\n    the same unfortunate ignorance in regard to one of the most\r\n    important of the sources of our national wealth, which has\r\n    characterized previous Census Reports, still prevails among\r\n    our officials at Washington; and that all which Mr. Kennedy’s\r\n    Report contains must be taken with many grains of allowance. It\r\n    is certainly the duty of those who are better posted to give\r\n    notice of these deficiencies, and to call public attention to\r\n    them again and again, in the hope that something may be done,\r\n    hereafter, to make this department of the Government less\r\n    ridiculous in the eyes of those who are acquainted with such\r\n    matters, and less liable to mislead those who look on a Census\r\n    Report as something to be blindly quoted, and relied on as a\r\n    document which must necessarily be correct.\r\n\r\n    The only metals in regard to which anything is stated in Mr.\r\n    Kennedy’s report are iron, nickel, lead, zinc, and copper; thus\r\n    omitting gold, silver, and quicksilver, of each of which we are\r\n    large producers. Of the mineral productions, coal is the only\r\n    one noticed.\r\n\r\n    The first metal mentioned in the text accompanying the tables\r\n    compiled from the Census returns is iron, and the quantity of\r\n    pig iron produced in 1860 is given at 884,474 tuns, valued at\r\n    $19,487,790, and this is stated to be an increase in the value\r\n    returned by the Census of 1850, of 44·4 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Here the question arises, how far are these figures to be\r\n    relied on as accurate? This can only be decided by comparison\r\n    with returns known to be approximately accurate, and of these\r\n    we have none later than the year 1856, in which year the make\r\n    of pig iron was ascertained, by the Iron-Makers’ Association,\r\n    to be 812,917 tuns. Either the Census returns of 1860 are too\r\n    low, as they were in 1850, or else the increase in this branch\r\n    of our industry has been very slight since 1849, when the make\r\n    of iron was ascertained by the Pennsylvania Iron-Masters to be\r\n    800,000 tuns. On the other hand, assuming the Census returns\r\n    of 1860 to be correct, there is no ground for making the\r\n    statement, as is done by Mr. Kennedy, that there has been an\r\n    increase of 44·4 per cent. in the value of the iron produced\r\n    in 1860 over that of 1850; it is evident that the increase\r\n    has been very slight, since 1846 or 1847 even, in which years\r\n    the make of this metal, on reliable authority, reached nearly\r\n    800,000 tuns.\r\n\r\n    But what shall we say of Mr. Kennedy’s method of arriving at\r\n    the production of iron, as related to the amount of population\r\n    in the United States, or the number of pounds produced per\r\n    head? To obtain this, he adds together the amount of pig iron\r\n    and the amount of bar and other wrought iron produced, and\r\n    thus obtains a result of 92 pounds of iron produced for each\r\n    inhabitant of the United States; which, as he says, “speaks\r\n    volumes for the progress of the nation in all its industrial\r\n    and material interests.” It speaks a volume or two for his own\r\n    ignorance of the elements of metallurgy; since, as everybody,\r\n    except the Superintendent of the United States Census, knows,\r\n    the bar and rolled iron is nearly all converted from the pig,\r\n    and only a small proportion made direct from the ore; so that\r\n    his method of computation is as near correct as it would\r\n    be, for instance, to estimate the amount of beef consumed\r\n    per head in San Francisco, by adding the weight of all the\r\n    cattle slaughtered in the city to that of the beef produced by\r\n    said slaughtering. As, in 1856, only 28,433 tuns of bar iron\r\n    were made directly from the ore, to 812,917 of pig produced;\r\n    so, allowing that 28,000 tuns were made direct in 1860, the\r\n    amount, per head, of all the iron made in that year would be\r\n    65 pounds, instead of 92, as Mr. Kennedy calculates.[1] Taking\r\n    the population of the United States at 23,000,000, in 1850, and\r\n    the make of iron at 800,000 tuns, as given by the returns of\r\n    the Commission of the Iron-Masters of Pennsylvania, the amount\r\n    produced, per head, in that year, would be 78 pounds; so that\r\n    all Mr. Kennedy’s glorification goes for naught, unless we\r\n    admit that his returns for 1860 are wrong.\r\n\r\n    In regard to the statistics of the other metals mentioned\r\n    in the Census Report, it may be said, with truth, that they\r\n    are very defective. No mention is made of gold, silver, or\r\n    mercury, the value of the first-named of which produced in\r\n    this country is nearly double that of all the other metals.\r\n    Under zinc, there is no mention made of New Jersey, the great\r\n    zinc-producing State. The yield of lead in the Mississippi\r\n    Valley is put down at considerably less than its real amount.\r\n\r\n    But the most important remark to be made, in this connection,\r\n    is in reference to the mode of reporting the results adopted by\r\n    Mr. Kennedy. Instead of giving the amount of _metal_ produced,\r\n    the number of tuns of _ore_ is stated, and no clue given to the\r\n    yield of the ore. This is something as an assessor’s report\r\n    would be, which should give the valuation of the individuals he\r\n    might be called on to appraise, in _pieces of money_, leaving\r\n    it uncertain whether five cent or twenty dollar pieces were\r\n    intended.\r\n\r\n    The table given by Mr. Kennedy does not state what amounts\r\n    of each metal are produced; and, if we attempt to arrive at\r\n    them by examining the columns of values, it is found to be\r\n    impossible to decide whether these values are those of the ore\r\n    as mined before being smelted, or of the metals produced from\r\n    them. In short, the whole matter is left in such obscurity,\r\n    that it is much to be wished that the table could be expunged\r\n    from the Report, as it can only serve to mislead and confuse\r\n    those who resort to Government documents for information in\r\n    regard to our metallic and mineral productions.\r\n\r\n    [1] In point of fact, the amount of bar iron made in the\r\n    bloomery furnaces direct from the ore is growing less every\r\n    year, and must be now reduced to a very small figure.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper remarked that, since the publication of his paper on\r\nCalifornian Mollusca, read before the Academy November 3d, 1862, (see\r\nProceedings, vol. II, p. 202) he finds the generic name STRATEGUS\r\npreoccupied, and he now proposes, in its place, the name NAVARCHUS.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited a magnificent specimen of auriferous quartz,\r\nin which the gold was associated with _Mispickel_, (Arsenical Pyrites.)\r\nThe weight of the mass was about five pounds, and the value of the gold\r\nestimated at $1,500. It was obtained from the celebrated “Fellows Lode,”\r\non the Middle Yuba, in Sierra County. It is stated, on what is believed\r\nto be reliable authority, that from $200,000 to $250,000 has been taken\r\nfrom an excavation on the lode only ten feet long and four feet wide,\r\nby crushing in hand-mortars. The occurrence of gold in connection with\r\nmispickel, in the California mines, seems to be rare, at least in the\r\nsouthern counties. In the specimen presented, the gold formed a coherent,\r\nsponge-like mass, when the mispickel was dissolved.\r\n\r\nBaron Richthofen remarked, that gold occurs associated with mispickel in\r\nSilesia.\r\n\r\nMr. R. L. Harris made some remarks on the comparative friction of\r\ncar-wheels, on an iron track, when rolling and sliding, as shown by\r\nexperiments made on the street-railroad in Washington street. Here the\r\ngreatest grade is five hundred and twenty-eight feet per mile, or one in\r\nten, and it is found that, on a wet day, if the wheels are stopped by the\r\nbrakes, they will slide on the track; while, if the brakes are not put\r\ndown so hard but that the wheels can revolve, the car is entirely under\r\ncontrol. This is not the popular opinion, and the authorities generally\r\nstate, that the sliding friction is the greatest; but experience shows,\r\nthat the friction is really greatest when the sliding and rolling motions\r\nare combined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, FEBRUARY 16TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourteen members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet were received as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom J.

Heads solitary and terminal, homochromous and\r\n    many-flowered. Leaves alternate, crowded near the base,\r\n    oblanceolate, very acute, quite entire, three-nerved; the\r\n    reticulate veins and nerves prominent, sub-petiolate (half\r\n    to one inch in length, by about one-fourth in breadth); the\r\n    lowermost leaves more distinctly petiolate, spatulate, obtuse,\r\n    or sub-acute; upper cauline leaves few or solitary, lanceolate,\r\n    very acute or acuminate, three-nerved.\r\n\r\n    Involucre campanulate, the greenish somewhat foliaceous scales\r\n    rigid, many-nerved, (chiefly three to five) margins scarious,\r\n    cleft-ciliate, or somewhat fimbriate, oblanceolate, acute, in\r\n    three series, often one or two bractoid scales at the base.\r\n\r\n    Receptacle flat, alveolate; alveoli toothed, naked. Rays (about\r\n    eight) orange-yellow, oblong-oval, two or three-toothed,\r\n    pistillate, fertile, tube slender, about as long as the\r\n    achenia, or one-third to half the length of the ligule.\r\n\r\n    Disk corolla cylindrical, slightly expanding, five-toothed,\r\n    erect, glabrous. The achenia (about twenty, including the ray)\r\n    angular, oblong, somewhat compressed; base cuneate, satiny\r\n    appressed pubescent (with white hairs); pappus of unequal\r\n    capillary scabrous bristles, rigid and fragile, or deciduous.\r\n\r\n    Appendages of the style much longer than the stigmatic portion,\r\n    lance-subulate, hispid, much exsert, erect-spreading.\r\n\r\n    This plant was brought from Nevada Territory by Mr. Herbert C.\r\n    Dorr.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MIRABILIS L.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _M. Californica_ Gray, Var. _villosa_ Kellogg.\r\n\r\n    Stem about a foot in height, somewhat ascending, flexuous,\r\n    divaricately branching, nodose, internodes slightly curved;\r\n    minutely villous throughout. Leaves rounded-cordate, obtuse,\r\n    entire, three to five-nerved; the uppermost ovate-cordate,\r\n    petioles short, (one-fourth to one-sixth the length of the\r\n    lamina).\r\n\r\n    Flowers pedicellate, in loose terminal dichotomous panicles,\r\n    with a solitary flower in the axils; perigonium pink, pedicels\r\n    recurved in fruit.\r\n\r\n    This plant, from the interior—Devil’s Gate and Carson\r\n    River—differs much from the plate of the coast plant of the\r\n    Mexican Boundary Report. It is not at all “glabrous,” nor are\r\n    the flowers “sub-sessile;” the pairs of leaves are remote,\r\n    with a much more open and spreading aspect; the flowers are\r\n    pentandrous and deciduous.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris exhibited a section of a pile, from a wharf at Rincon Point,\r\nwhich fell a few days since, having been destroyed by the boring of the\r\n_Teredo_, (properly a _Xylotrya_.) The material of the pile is Oregon\r\npine; it had been in the water less than six years, but is now completely\r\nperforated in all directions. The subject of the best means of protection\r\nfor piles, against attacks of the _Teredo_, was discussed at some length\r\nby various members.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres stated that, as yet, no reliable preventive had been\r\ndiscovered, except that of sheathing the pile with metal. Several years\r\nago the same subject came before the Academy, and Drs. Ayres and Trask\r\nwere appointed a Committee to investigate the subject. All external\r\napplications which have been proposed fail in practice, from the wearing\r\naway of the surface by the waves, and they are but little better than the\r\nnatural bark. It has not appeared that the saving in time was equal to\r\nthe expense incurred by thus protecting the piles. At Boston, where there\r\nare two species destructive of timber, they find no preventive, short of\r\nsheathing the piles with copper.\r\n\r\nIn the French works on this subject, it has been stated that the bark\r\naffords no protection; but, on the contrary, aids the young animals in\r\nintroducing themselves into the wood. This has not been found to be\r\nthe case in this bay, where the bark does, on the contrary, assist in\r\npreserving the timber.\r\n\r\nThe fact was also stated, by one of the members, that the piles of the\r\nwharfs in the southern part of the city suffer much from attacks of the\r\n_Teredo_; while those of the northern portion are comparatively exempt.\r\nThe fact was mentioned, that piles have been entirely destroyed here in\r\nsix months from the time they were placed in the water.\r\n\r\nProf. Brewer made some remarks on the method of calculating altitudes by\r\nobservation with a single barometer. He gave an account of the methods\r\nadopted by the Geological Survey for computation, in cases where there\r\nwas no station barometer nearer than the bay, or the valley of the\r\nSacramento.\r\n\r\nDr. Trask mentioned that the weight of the Honcut meteoric iron presented\r\nby him to the Academy, at the meeting of March 17th, 1862, was six\r\nounces, one hundred and twenty-eight grains, troy.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney called attention to the curious errors in a paper\r\npublished in Petermann’s Mittheilungen, 1861, page 133, which purports\r\nto be a translation into German of a portion of a work published by Mr.\r\nJ. Xantus, describing his journey in Lower California. He describes a\r\nquicksilver mine of great importance as being worked at Marques; but the\r\ndescription which he gives of it shows that it is the New Almaden mine\r\nwhich, in reality, he visited, and which, by some confusion of his notes,\r\nhe has located in Lower, instead of Upper California. No mercury mine is\r\nworked on the California peninsula, so far as can be ascertained. It is\r\nevident that Mr. Xantus’s notice of rich gold, lead and copper mines on\r\nthe peninsula must be taken with many grains of allowance.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Dr. Ayres, it was ordered, that twenty-five copies of\r\nthe second volume of the Proceedings be placed at the disposal of the\r\nPublishing Committee for distribution to learned societies, public\r\nlibraries, and distinguished scientific men in the Atlantic States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 2D, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, fifteen members.\r\n\r\nDr. J. P. Kirtland, of Cleveland, Ohio, was elected a corresponding\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Rowlandson, specimen of the wool of the Alpacca and Vicuña,\r\nbrought from Peru by Capt. Bissell, of the United States sloop-of-war\r\n_Cyane_.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library.\r\n\r\nThe American Journal of Science, for January, 1863, from the editors.\r\n\r\nMr. Gabb communicated two papers by Mr. Rémond, containing descriptions\r\nof new fossils from California.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of two New Species of Bivalve Shells, from the Tertiaries of\r\nContra Costa County.\r\n\r\nBY AUGUSTE RÉMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CARDIUM Brug.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. Gabbii_ Rémond.\r\n\r\n    Shell cordate, ventricose, nearly equilateral; posterior\r\n    side truncated, direct; anterior side slightly depressed;\r\n    height and length nearly equal. Umbones very prominent; beaks\r\n    incurved, approximate; lunule well marked, carinated; surface\r\n    even, with fine imbricated lines of growth. Hinge (of the left\r\n    valve) comparatively narrow; anterior fosset small, shallow,\r\n    triangular; cartilage pit large, deep, long; lateral teeth\r\n    heavy, thick, prominent.\r\n\r\n    Locality: vicinity of Kirker’s Pass, south of New York (of the\r\n    Pacific) Plain from a late tertiary deposit.\r\n\r\n    The _C. Gabbii_ will easily be distinguished from any other\r\n    species yet discovered, from its heavy hinge and enormous\r\n    lateral teeth. I take great pleasure in dedicating this\r\n    beautiful fossil to Mr. W. M. Gabb, to whom I am indebted for\r\n    repeated assistance in my palæontological studies.\r\n\r\n    This species occurs in shelly sands, together with _Tapes\r\n    regularis_ Gabb and _Murex ponderosus_ Gabb, two other extinct\r\n    species. The specimens are in the collection of Mr. W. M. Gabb\r\n    and my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OSTREA L.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _O. Bourgeoisii_ Rémond.\r\n\r\n    The description is from two lower valves, from the collections\r\n    of Mr. l’Abbé Bourgeois (Pont-Levoy, France) and Mr. Pioche,\r\n    (San Francisco.)\r\n\r\n    Shell sub-oval, higher than long, strongly contracted near the\r\n    cardinal area, sub-rounded on the ventral margin; inferior\r\n    valve comparatively thin, convex, irregular exteriorly, with\r\n    remote, somewhat rugose, plaits of growth. Ligament fosset\r\n    long, profound, minutely wrinkled and finely striated, oblique\r\n    and turned downwards; muscular impression very large, oblique,\r\n    and sub-central, somewhat prominent.\r\n\r\n    Locality: vicinity of Kirker’s Pass, from a late tertiary bed.\r\n\r\n    I dedicate this new species to Mr. Bourgeois, Professor of\r\n    Natural History at the School of Pont-Levoy, (Loir-et-Cher,\r\n    France) who was my first teacher in geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of two Species of Scutella.\r\n\r\nBY AUGUSTE RÉMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCUTELLA Lam.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _S. Gibbsii_ Rémond.\r\n\r\n    Disk oblong-sub-oval, rounded before and truncated behind,\r\n    posteriorly convex above, slightly depressed in front;\r\n    inferior surface flat, somewhat concave about the mouth.\r\n    Apex about midway between the center and posterior margin;\r\n    ambulacral star non-symmetrical; petals unequal, open at their\r\n    extremities. Anterior petal straight, longer than the others;\r\n    the lateral ones nearly straight, diverging from the apex with\r\n    an angle of about eighty degrees; posterior petals very short,\r\n    sub-oval, having the anterior side most curved. Four rows of\r\n    pores in each petal; the inner pores transverse, the outer\r\n    ones pointed obliquely inwards. Mouth posteriorly sub-central;\r\n    anal-aperture small, submarginal. Ambulacral furrows double,\r\n    nearly symmetrical, slightly ramified. Each ambulacral and\r\n    inter-ambulacral space is occupied by two rows of irregular\r\n    plates, either pentagonal or hexagonal. Tubercles numerous,\r\n    crowded in the ambulacral furrows, but much worn off in the\r\n    specimens examined.\r\n\r\n    Locality: Kern Lake, Buena Vista County.\r\n\r\n    The specimens described are in the collection of the Academy;\r\n    they were found by Dr. Gibbs, to whom the species is dedicated.\r\n\r\n    Obs.—This species, considered by Mr. Gabb as of probably\r\n    miocene age, is closely allied to the _S. striatula_, which is\r\n    found living on the Californian coast, and occurs fossil in\r\n    the _faluns_ (miocene formation) of Bordeaux, France; but it\r\n    differs from it in the outlines and the size of the shell, the\r\n    former being comparatively small and longer than broad, while\r\n    the latter is broader than long. Besides, the apex of the _S.\r\n    Gibbsii_ is situated more posteriorly, and the lateral petals,\r\n    in the _S. striatula_, diverge from the apex, with an angle of\r\n    from one hundred and ten to one hundred and fifteen degrees;\r\n    this latter has also its ambulacral furrows more ramified at\r\n    their extremities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _S. interlineata_ W. P. Blake.\r\n\r\n    Disk sub-circular, broad, upper surface convex towards the\r\n    middle, depressed on the margins, plane beneath; apex central;\r\n    ambulacral star symmetrical; petals long, equal, closed at\r\n    their extremities, nearly reaching from the apex to the margin\r\n    of the shell, terminated by five or six irregular hexagonal\r\n    plates. The petals are longitudinally divided into four rows,\r\n    which are connected by numerous and regular transverse lines\r\n    of pores. Mouth central; anus submarginal; ambulacral furrows\r\n    symmetrical, not much ramified. Inter-ambulacral areas occupied\r\n    by two rows of pentagonal plates, convex, of equal length,\r\n    increasing in size until they unite with the ambulacral plates;\r\n    hexagonal from that point and decreasing towards the margin.\r\n\r\n    Two sorts of appendages; spinous processes numerous and\r\n    crowded, above and beneath. Spines of the superior surface\r\n    short, striated, pyriform, irregularly pentagonal or hexagonal;\r\n    inferior spines slender, comparatively long, dentaliform,\r\n    striated longitudinally, tubular and round.\r\n\r\n    Obs.—Water-worn fragments of this fine fossil occur in\r\n    abundance on the beach, between Merced Lake and the Pacific,\r\n    south of Point Lobos, in San Francisco County. It was made\r\n    known to science by Mr. W. P. Blake, Geologist of the Railroad\r\n    Survey, who found it in 1853, among the shingles thrown up\r\n    by the surf, and first described by Mr. W. Stimpson. At\r\n    that time the locality whence the scutellæ were derived had\r\n    not been discovered, so that the specimens obtained being\r\n    imperfect, no complete description could be made; this is\r\n    the reason why I offer a new and complete description of\r\n    the _Scutella interlineata_, from specimens procured _in\r\n    situ_. As was suggested by Mr. W. P. Blake, the rocks bearing\r\n    these fossils are found a few miles southward, north of the\r\n    boundary line between San Mateo and San Francisco Counties,\r\n    where the scutellæ stick out from conglomeratic sandstones,\r\n    which Mr. Gabb considers as belonging to the _pliocene_ or\r\n    _post-pliocene_ formation; we find them in a fine state of\r\n    preservation, with their spines retained.\r\n\r\n    The _S. interlineata_ is figured in the Railroad Reports;\r\n    see vol. V, Geological Report, plate IV, fig. 30; and for\r\n    Mr. Blake’s remarks and Mr. Stimpson’s description, the same\r\n    Report, chap. XII, p. 153.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Blake made some remarks on specimens, presented by him, of\r\ninfusoria, found in the sand-hills, south of Point Lobos, and which form\r\na kind of concretions, fixing the sand in its place.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres made the following remarks in relation to the genus\r\nNOTORHYNCHUS:\r\n\r\n    This genus was defined by me in 1855 (Proc. Cal. Acad. Nat.\r\n    Sci., vol. I, p. 72) to include a species occurring in the Bay\r\n    of San Francisco. In 1858 Girard refers to the species (P. R.\r\n    R. Rep., vol. X, p. 367) under the generic name HEPTANCHUS, of\r\n    which he considers NOTORHYNCHUS a synonym. In 1861, Mr. Gill\r\n    refers it to Rafinesque’s genus HEPTRANCHIAS. (Annals of the\r\n    Lyc. Nat. Hist., N. Y., vol. VIII, Dec.) In a more recent paper\r\n    (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci., Phil., Oct., 1862) Mr. Gill restores my\r\n    species to the name under which it was originally described.\r\n    He says: “This generic name of NOTORHYNCHUS was proposed by\r\n    Dr. Ayres under a misapprehension.” My “misapprehension”\r\n    was that I regarded the species as the type of a new genus;\r\n    a conclusion at which Mr. Gill himself has, after several\r\n    changes, also arrived. He gives as a synonym of NOTORHYNCHUS\r\n    only “HEPTANCHUS, Sp. Müller and Henle, Gray, Girard, Gill,”\r\n    whereas it is necessary to include also “HEPTRANCHIAS, Gill,”\r\n    as above indicated.\r\n\r\n    I may remark that the description given by Mr. Gill of the\r\n    teeth of _Notorhynchus maculatus_, (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci.,\r\n    Phil., Oct., 1862, p. 495) will not bear examination. It\r\n    represents the individual specimen on which it was founded; but\r\n    the species is quite common here, and I find that the number\r\n    and the forms of the teeth vary so much, that my original\r\n    description, which Mr. Gill says is “equally applicable to any\r\n    species of the family,” is fully as close as nature will allow\r\n    us to draw. I am at a loss to understand how it is possible\r\n    for him to refer the jaws of a shark, collected at a point\r\n    so far removed from us as Nisqually, to my species, when my\r\n    description is so extremely indefinite.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney gave an account of an interesting collection of\r\nJapanese minerals and fossils, in the possession of J. H. Van Reed, Esq.,\r\nof this city.\r\n\r\n    This collection comprises over one thousand specimens of rocks,\r\n    ores, fossils, and miscellaneous objects of natural history.\r\n    It is supposed that they are chiefly of Japanese origin; but,\r\n    as there is among them a fragment of a Dutch tobacco-pipe,\r\n    carefully labeled, there may be other objects in the collection\r\n    from foreign countries. The articles are all labeled, in the\r\n    Japanese language: they are carefully fastened to the cases in\r\n    which they are arranged, with exquisite Japanese neatness. The\r\n    small crystals are inclosed in glass receptacles, having nearly\r\n    the form of two large watch-crystals, attached to each other by\r\n    the edges.\r\n\r\n    In the general character of the specimens in this collection,\r\n    a singular resemblance was noticed to the productions of\r\n    California, especially in the fossils and silicified woods, of\r\n    which latter there are a number of beautiful specimens. There\r\n    are several bivalve shells of pliocene or miocene tertiary\r\n    age, and some casts of gasteropods, exquisitely formed in\r\n    chalcedony. A number of sharks’ teeth, of the genus _Lamna_,\r\n    were also noticed. Among the fossils is a single shell of\r\n    palæozoic age, a _Spirifer_; it is not impossible, however,\r\n    that this may have been carried from China to Japan; at all\r\n    events, a _Spirifer_ from that country resembling this, and\r\n    of Devonian age, has been described in the Proceedings of the\r\n    Geological Society of London.\r\n\r\n    There are quite a number of specimens of copper ore in the\r\n    collection; they are all of the common yellow sulphuret,\r\n    (chalcopyrite) except one or two of erubescite. This would\r\n    indicate that the principal ore of this metal in Japan, as in\r\n    other countries, is the sulphuret of copper and iron.\r\n\r\n    Native gold in quartz is also present in the collection;\r\n    but no ores of silver were noticed, except one specimen of\r\n    steel-grained galena, which is probably argentiferous. There\r\n    are several specimens of realgar. Among the other minerals\r\n    noticed were: calcite, adularia, chalybite, in the form of\r\n    _flos ferri_, garnets, small crystals of pyroxene, crystals\r\n    of mica, pectolite, and another zeolitic mineral resembling\r\n    Thomsonite, as also native sulphur, obsidian, and a variety of\r\n    volcanic rocks and lavas.\r\n\r\n    The collection is quite interesting, and would be more so if\r\n    the labels could be read. The principal inference to be drawn\r\n    from it, is the predominance of volcanic formations, and of the\r\n    later tertiary strata, in the region in which this collection\r\n    was made.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres called attention to a remarkable turtle, in the possession\r\nof Mr. Van Reed, known as the “Sacred Turtle” of the Japanese. It is a\r\nspecies of Emys, closely allied to _E. terrapin_. Its marked peculiarity\r\nis, that its back is covered by a growth of _conferva_, which is often\r\nseveral inches long, and which gives the animal its sacred character\r\namong the Japanese, who believe this growth to be _hair_. The species is\r\nallied to _C. rivularis_; but the cells are more elongated. Dr. Ayres\r\nstated that he had observed a growth of _conferva_ on various aquatic\r\nand amphibious animals in New England, and that, in these, it was always\r\nattended by disease, with more or less ulcerated at the roots. He was\r\nsatisfied that this was always the case with fishes exhibiting this\r\ngrowth. The turtle in question, however, does not show any evidence of\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres made some further remarks on the similarity of the fishes of\r\nMr. Van Reed’s collection to species found in California.\r\n\r\nMr. Gabb noticed a resemblance in the fossils to those of this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 16TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine members present.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Academy was called to the fact that the names of\r\nDr. W. Newcomb, of Oakland, and of Mr. H. C. Bennett, of Columbia, both\r\nCorresponding Members of several years’ standing, had been omitted from\r\nthe published list.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet were received as follows:\r\n\r\nSpecimen of tree cotton, from near Mazatlan, Mexico; presented by Dr.\r\nTrask.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library:\r\n\r\nAlternate generation of Annelids, by A.

Leaves opposite, lower pair\r\n    oblong-spatulate obtuse, lamina slightly decurrent down the\r\n    petioles; those above, lanceolate, petiolate, acute, or\r\n    acuminate, mucronate, one-nerved, quite entire.\r\n\r\n    The minute yellow flowers crowded at the summit in pairs,\r\n    from the axils of the much abbreviated branchlets, short,\r\n    pedicellate; and with the long, narrowly lanceolate, acuminate,\r\n    bractoid leaves aggregated into a somewhat dense, subsessile\r\n    head. Calyx obconic, membranaceously diaphanous at the base;\r\n    segments green, cup prismatic (or pentangular); also with five\r\n    prominent processes, or folds, at the clefts, the semi-lanced\r\n    segments acute, or acuminate, subulate pointed, three-nerved.\r\n\r\n    The filiform flowers twice the length of the calyx, border\r\n    spreading, tube contracted below, stamens equal, or sub-equal,\r\n    inserted into the throat; capsule obovate, emarginate.\r\n\r\n    A very diminutive species from the western slope of the Sierra\r\n    Nevada Mountains, found by Mr. Herbert C. Dorr. The plant\r\n    yields a beautiful yellow dye, hence the specific name.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. micrantha_ Kellogg.

Capsule oval, compressed\r\n    (?), about three-seeded, seeds oblong, cuneate, flattened.\r\n\r\n    A plant four to six inches in height, found by Mr. G. W. Dunn,\r\n    in the vicinity of Silver City, Nevada Territory. In one of\r\n    the specimens the first pair of leaves appears to manifest a\r\n    serrate tendency.\r\n\r\nDr. Trask stated, that the tree cotton presented by him was said to be\r\nthe produce of a shrub from four to fifteen feet high. It is described as\r\ngrowing in a pod like a banana, the shrub forming a high chaparral. The\r\nstaple is long and fine; but nothing is known of its commercial value.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr remarked that it closely resembled species of BOMBAX and\r\nERIODENDRON, abundant in South America and the East Indies, but not there\r\nconsidered as of value as a substitute for cotton.\r\n\r\nDr. Trask made some remarks in regard to certain species of CONFERVA,\r\nwhich appear to be sensitive, like the species of SCHRANKIA.\r\n\r\nProf. Brewer stated that he had recently received a communication from\r\nProfessor Planchon, of South France, in regard to suitable forage plants\r\nfor dry regions. In that country the _Medicago sativa_, or Lucerne, was\r\nconsidered the most valuable, and next to it the Sainfoin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 5TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, ten members; and Mr. W.

KELLOGG, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PTEROSTEPHANUS Kellogg.\r\n\r\n    Involucre obconically-companulate; scales loosely imbricated in\r\n    about two to three series; the exterior unequal, calyculate,\r\n    suborbicular, oval, or oblong, obtuse; the inner series (of\r\n    about eight) sub-equal, oblong-lanceolate, obtuse; scarious\r\n    margins entire; (a broad, diffusely green line marks the\r\n    centre). Receptacle naked, alveolate, alveoli, toothed. Achenia\r\n    (mature wanting), oblong, sub-cuneate, or sub-obovate, somewhat\r\n    compressed (?), slightly contracted at the crown, smooth,\r\n    sub-pubescent above, on a short stipe. Pappus double; the\r\n    exterior coroniform, persistent—a hyaline crateriform cup, with\r\n    an even but minutely crenulate edge; interior of five (white)\r\n    plumose, glabrous bristles, gradually dilating towards the base.\r\n\r\n    Californian herbs, with runcinately, pinnatifid, radical\r\n    leaves, and numerous naked scapes, bearing solitary,\r\n    tigulate, yellow flowers; closely allied to _Malacothrix_ and\r\n    _Calycoseris_, but with a plumose pappus.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _P. runcinatus_ Kellogg. [FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n    Acaulescent, several naked scapes, two to four inches high,\r\n    sub-glabrous, (rarely a few scattering glandular hairs); leaves\r\n    radical, runcinately pinnatifid, lobes spinulose, frosty, or\r\n    sub-wooly, pubescent, three to seven-nerved, short petioles\r\n    winged, dilated at the base; rosulate, from a simple perennial\r\n    somewhat fusiform root.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited a new mass of meteoric iron, found near La\r\nPaz, on the Colorado River, in New Mexico, by Hermann Ehrenberg, Esq. A\r\ndescription and analysis will be furnished at a future meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 20TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nVice President, Dr. Trask, in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, seven members.\r\n\r\nPhilip Lutley Sclater, Esq., of London, England, was elected a\r\nCorresponding Member.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet:\r\n\r\nThree species of Reptiles from San Mateo, and one from Marin County,\r\ncollected and presented by Mr. Bolander.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper communicated the following description of a new Californian\r\nMollusc, discovered by Rev. Joseph Rowell, at Marysville, in the waters\r\nof Feather River.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GUNDLACHIA Pfeiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _G. Californica_ Rowell. [FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n    Shell with the aperture sub-oval, obliquely expanded towards\r\n    the left, posteriorly ronaded, and wider anteriorly. Internal\r\n    shelf reaching forward about one-fifth the length of the shell,\r\n    its margin slightly concave and oblique.\r\n\r\n    Dorsal surface convex, becoming somewhat keel-shaped towards\r\n    the apex, which is strongly and obliquely deflected so as\r\n    to make the right border nearly a straight line, while the\r\n    expansion on the left projects nearly as far back as the apex,\r\n    at an obtuse angle. Structure corneous, with strong concentric\r\n    lines of growth, and faint radiating striæ. Color dark brown,\r\n    opaque; inner surface shining and purplish, the plate white\r\n    towards the edge, and in some specimens showing a thickened,\r\n    white semicircle continuous with its margin across the arch of\r\n    the shell.\r\n\r\n    Length about sixteen one-hundredths, breadth eight\r\n    one-hundredths, and height six one-hundredths of an English\r\n    inch.\r\n\r\n    More than fifty specimens were found on water plants in clear\r\n    stagnant ponds, two or more often sticking on the back of a\r\n    larger one.\r\n\r\n    The discovery of this little shell in California is of great\r\n    interest, the only species hitherto known being found in Cuba.\r\n    The generic characters of this shell are strictly parallel\r\n    with that species, while those mentioned as specific easily\r\n    distinguish it. The Cuban shell is more elongated, regularly\r\n    oval, the apex projecting considerably beyond the margin of\r\n    the aperture, which is not obliquely expanded posteriorly. Its\r\n    size is about one-fifth larger than that of ours. According to\r\n    Bourguignat, the young shell is a simple obtuse cone, with a\r\n    semicircular aperture formed by the edge of the shelf, and the\r\n    thickened dorsal margin; but as it grows, the animal changes\r\n    the form of the aperture until the opening beneath the shelf\r\n    becomes like the small end of a broad funnel, which in some of\r\n    our specimens is still shown by the white semicircular ring.\r\n\r\n    The shell much resembles that of the marine _Crypta_\r\n    (_Crepidula_), and also _Navicella_ of tropical estuaries; but\r\n    the animal is quite different in the Cuban species, and will\r\n    undoubtedly prove so in the Californian.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanks mentioned that he had collected about two hundred specimens of\r\nminerals for the Academy in Owen’s Lake Valley, and that there were also\r\nsome bones with them from a well thirty feet deep, presented by Mr. H. M.\r\nMcCormick; all of which would be forwarded to San Francisco as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MAY 4TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, eleven members.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet were received as follows:\r\n\r\nA collection of pine cones, from H. G. Bloomer. A specimen of rock,\r\ncontaining cretaceous fossils, from the vicinity of Fort Tejon (?), by E.\r\nT. Schenck. Two specimens of _Monocentris Japonicus_ Cuv. from Dr. Ayres.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library:\r\n\r\nCommercial Relations of the United States for the year ending Sept.\r\n30th, 1861, from the Department of the Interior. Classification of the\r\nColeoptera of North America, by John Le Conte, M.D., Part I. Smithsonian\r\nInstructions for collecting eggs and nests of North American birds.\r\nSmithsonian Directions for collecting, preserving, and transporting\r\nspecimens of Natural History: the three last-named volumes were presented\r\nby Dr. Ayres.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney read the following communication in regard to the\r\nprogress of the State Geological Survey of California.\r\n\r\n    The Act of the Legislature authorizing a geological survey of\r\n    this State was approved April 21st, 1860; but operations were\r\n    not commenced until about the first of December of that year,\r\n    consequently the work has been in progress for a little more\r\n    than two years.\r\n\r\n    The plan of the survey, according to the requirements of\r\n    the act by which it was organized, demands “an accurate\r\n    and complete geological survey of the State,” and a report\r\n    containing “a full and scientific description of its rocks,\r\n    fossils, soils, and minerals, and of its botanical and\r\n    zoological productions.” Provision is also made for the\r\n    collection of specimens in all departments of geology and\r\n    natural history, which specimens are to be deposited “in such\r\n    place as shall be hereafter provided for that purpose by the\r\n    Legislature.”\r\n\r\n    The following persons have been employed on the survey since\r\n    it was commenced: Professor W. H. Brewer, as Principal\r\n    Assistant, and specially in charge of the department of Botany\r\n    and Agricultural Geology. Professor Brewer, however, up to\r\n    the present time, has been chiefly engaged in the geological\r\n    field work of the Survey. Mr. William Ashburner was employed\r\n    from the commencement of the work, up to the spring of 1862,\r\n    in the field; and, for a considerable portion of the time, in\r\n    examining the gold-quartz mines and machinery in the principal\r\n    mining counties of the Sierra Nevada. Mr. A. Rémond served as\r\n    volunteer, in the field work, during the season of 1862. Mr. W.\r\n    M. Gabb took the place of Palæontologist to the Survey at the\r\n    beginning of the year 1862, which position he still continues\r\n    to hold. Mr. C. Averill was connected with the Survey from\r\n    its commencement up to the month of February last, as Clerk,\r\n    Commissary, and Barometrical Observer. Dr. J. G. Cooper has\r\n    been in charge of the department of Zoology, and has been\r\n    employed, at intervals, as the financial condition of the\r\n    Survey permitted, since July 1st, 1861. In the topographical\r\n    department, Mr. C. F. Hoffmann has been employed constantly\r\n    since March, 1861; and Mr. V. Wackenreuder, at intervals,\r\n    during the past year.\r\n\r\n    The uncertainty peculiar to all undertakings of this kind in\r\n    the United States, arising from the necessity of appealing\r\n    to each successive Legislature for the means of carrying\r\n    on the work, and the disturbed state of the country during\r\n    the whole time since we commenced operations, as also the\r\n    unfortunate condition of the finances of the State, which has\r\n    kept the treasury from one to two years behind in the payment\r\n    of the legislative appropriations, have combined to render\r\n    it difficult to arrange and carry out as systematic a plan\r\n    for the conduct of the work as would, under more favorable\r\n    circumstances, have been practicable.\r\n\r\n    Two ideas have, however, as far as possible, governed the\r\n    survey in its operations: the first was, to make, as rapidly as\r\n    could be done, a reconnoissance of the State, with the view\r\n    of acquiring a knowledge of its general geological structure,\r\n    the age of the various formations which occur in it, and as\r\n    complete a general idea as possible of their range and extent,\r\n    so that a foundation might be laid for the detailed work which\r\n    would follow the preliminary examination; the second idea was,\r\n    at the same time that the general examination was going on, to\r\n    work up in detail certain more important districts, so that the\r\n    public might have light on questions of economical interest,\r\n    and at the same time be able to form an idea of what the work\r\n    might be if ever carried to completion. Besides this, the\r\n    natural history part of the survey was to be carried on, in\r\n    connection with the geological work, as rapidly as possible,\r\n    progress in all departments being necessarily proportioned to\r\n    the varying amounts of the annual appropriations.\r\n\r\n    California is covered by a vast net-work of mountain ranges,\r\n    separated by comparatively narrow valleys, with the exception\r\n    of those of the Sacramento and San Joaquin, which do not,\r\n    together, cover more than one-fifteenth of the area of the\r\n    State. The remaining fourteen-fifteenths may be called\r\n    mountainous, as the valleys include but a small portion of its\r\n    surface. Into this mountainous region no accurate surveys have\r\n    ever been carried; even the General Land Office work stops at\r\n    the base of the mountains. A few ranch lines have been run\r\n    among the moderately elevated portions of the Coast Ranges;\r\n    but, as a general thing, the genuine Mexican grants were\r\n    limited to the plains.\r\n\r\n    Without considerable topographical work in connection with the\r\n    geological survey we should, then, be entirely unable to carry\r\n    on our geological work with any pretense to accuracy, as we\r\n    could neither locate our observations nor make our descriptions\r\n    of the country intelligible. The authority for doing something\r\n    for the increase of the geographical knowledge of the State is\r\n    found in the clause of the act authorizing the survey, which\r\n    requires “proper maps” to accompany the reports.\r\n\r\n    What has been done, up to the present time, in this department\r\n    may be briefly recapitulated as follows:\r\n\r\n    A series of maps, forty-nine in number, has been compiled by\r\n    Mr. Hoffmann from the original documents at the United States\r\n    Surveyor-General’s Office; the scale of these is half an inch\r\n    to the mile. They contain a compilation of nearly all that is\r\n    known at that office in regard to the geography of the State.\r\n    The maps, as thus blocked out, have been used by us in the\r\n    field, by filling in the topography wherever our route has laid.\r\n\r\n    The maps which have been or are now being prepared for\r\n    publication are:\r\n\r\n    1st. A map of the vicinity of the Bay of San Francisco, on\r\n    a scale of half an inch to the mile, four feet by three; it\r\n    extends from near Santa Cruz on the south to Napa on the north,\r\n    and from the Pacific to Corral Hollow, east and west. The area\r\n    of land which it covers is 4,248 square miles, which is just\r\n    twice that of the State of Delaware, and only lacks two hundred\r\n    square miles of equaling that of Connecticut. As near as can\r\n    be ascertained, it contains one-third of the population of the\r\n    State, and has about thirty inhabitants to the square mile—the\r\n    average density of the population of California being but\r\n    little over two to the square mile. This map, on which all the\r\n    details of the topography are given, as minutely as the scale\r\n    allows, is nearly completed, and will be soon ready for the\r\n    engraver.\r\n\r\n    2d. A detailed map, on a scale of two inches to the mile, of\r\n    the vicinity of Mount Diablo; this is about two and one-half by\r\n    three feet in dimensions, and includes the most important coal\r\n    mining district yet known to exist in the State. The map can be\r\n    made ready for the engraver in a few days.\r\n\r\n    3d. A map of the Coast Ranges, from the Bay of Monterey south\r\n    to Santa Barbara. It is about three feet by two and one-half\r\n    in dimensions, is on a scale of six miles to the inch, and\r\n    embraces about 16,000 square miles of territory. To complete it\r\n    will require about another year’s work in the field with two\r\n    sub-parties.\r\n\r\n    4th. Map of the Washoe silver-mining region—three and one-half\r\n    by two and one-half feet in dimensions, on a scale of two\r\n    inches to the mile—and extending over all the important\r\n    mining ground of the district. This map is from an accurate\r\n    trigonometrical survey by V. Wackenreuder; it is nearly\r\n    completed.\r\n\r\n    5th. Map of the Comstock Lode, on a scale of four hundred feet\r\n    to the inch, completed.\r\n\r\n    6th. Map of the central portion of the Sierra Nevada; scale\r\n    not yet determined on. Extensive surveys have been made by\r\n    Mr. Wackenreuder for this part of the work, and these will be\r\n    continued during the present season.\r\n\r\n    Of the above mentioned maps, Nos. 1 and 2 will accompany the\r\n    first volume of the Report. Nos. 4, 5, and probably 6, the\r\n    second volume.\r\n\r\n    It is intended, if the survey is carried to completion, to\r\n    construct a final map of the State on a scale of six miles to\r\n    the inch, in nine sheets, each about three feet square.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the regular topographical work, an extensive\r\n    series of barometrical observation has been made, for the\r\n    determination of altitudes, some two hundred and fifty\r\n    important points having been ascended and measured. The most\r\n    interesting operation in this department was the determination\r\n    of the height of Mount Shasta, which, by an elaborate series of\r\n    observations, we found to be 14,440 feet above the sea level.\r\n    This is the first of the lofty volcanic peaks of the Sierra\r\n    Nevada which has been accurately measured.\r\n\r\n    In the department of geology proper, our explorations have\r\n    extended over portions of forty of the forty-six counties into\r\n    which the State is divided; and when it is remembered that the\r\n    average size of a county is equal to half that of the State of\r\n    Massachusetts, (California having just twenty-four times the\r\n    area of that State,) some idea of the magnitude of our work may\r\n    be obtained. The chain of the Sierra Nevada may be parallelized\r\n    with that of the Alps for extent and average elevation; while\r\n    the Coast Ranges are nearly as extensive as the Appalachian\r\n    chain of mountains.\r\n\r\n    We have obtained a pretty clear idea of the general structure\r\n    of the Coast Ranges from Los Angeles to Clear Lake; the\r\n    vicinity of the Bay of San Francisco has been worked out in\r\n    considerable detail, including all of San Francisco, San Mateo,\r\n    Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and Marin Counties, with\r\n    portions of Santa Cruz, Solano, Napa, and Sonoma. Considerable\r\n    field-work has been done in the Sierra Nevada, chiefly in\r\n    the lower portion of the range between Mariposa and Shasta\r\n    Counties. Our observations have also been extended to the\r\n    Washoe Region, and we have received considerable collections of\r\n    fossils from the Humboldt Mining District, (known by this name\r\n    on the Pacific Coast, but designated on Warren’s Map as the\r\n    “West Humboldt River Range,” and in longitude 180°) by which we\r\n    have been able to fix the age of the formations in that region.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Gabb has been chiefly occupied, the past year, in figuring\r\n    and describing the cretaceous fossils of the Coast Ranges\r\n    and the foot-hills of the Sierra, of which he has nearly\r\n    two hundred new species ready for publication. He has also\r\n    described the triassic fossils, collected by the Survey at\r\n    Washoe, and by Gorham Blake, Esq., in the Humboldt Range. The\r\n    fossils older than the Trias have been referred to Mr. Meek for\r\n    investigation. A portion of the fossil plants have been placed\r\n    in the hands of Dr. J. S. Newberry for description.\r\n\r\n    It is to the department of General Geology that, up to the\r\n    present time, by far the greater portion of our attention has\r\n    been given, since the first thing required in a geological\r\n    survey is a knowledge of the general geological structure of\r\n    the State, the age of the various formations which occur in it,\r\n    and their range and extent, or the position which they occupy\r\n    on the surface, and their relations to each other. Each group\r\n    of strata, thus determined by its lithological peculiarities,\r\n    and by the fossils which it contains, is then to be laid down\r\n    upon the map, in the position in which its outcrop occupies on\r\n    the surface. The general character of the minerals and ores\r\n    which occur in each formation or group of strata having been\r\n    thus determined, the details of their mode of occurrence, their\r\n    relative abundance, and the facilities which may exist in\r\n    each separate district for making them economically available\r\n    must, after the preliminary general work has been done, be\r\n    the object of more special and detailed examinations. It is\r\n    not, however, the business of a geological surveying corps to\r\n    act, to any considerable extent, as a prospecting party; to do\r\n    this, would require that we should confine our operations to a\r\n    very limited area; the labors of the whole corps for an entire\r\n    season would not suffice to thoroughly prospect more than a\r\n    few hundred square miles in a very rich mineral region, and\r\n    we should have often to engage in expensive mining operations\r\n    to decide what was really of permanent value. It is our task,\r\n    rather, to limit the field of research, and to show to others\r\n    where their labors will be best bestowed, preventing foolish\r\n    expenditures of time and money in searching for what our\r\n    general geological investigations have determined not to exist\r\n    in sufficient quantity, in certain formations, to be worth\r\n    working. Especially in the first years of our work, in a State\r\n    of such an immense area as California, our labors have more the\r\n    character of a geological reconnoissance than of a detailed\r\n    survey.\r\n\r\n    Already, however, during the progress of our work, a large\r\n    amount of information has been collected in regard to the\r\n    mode of occurrence and abundance of the useful ores and\r\n    minerals of this State and the adjoining Territories. The\r\n    principal deposits of coal have been carefully examined, and\r\n    their geological position ascertained. Most of the important\r\n    quartz mines of the State have been visited by Mr. Ashburner,\r\n    and a large amount of information has been collected by him,\r\n    preparatory to an elaborate investigation and report on\r\n    this important branch of the industry of the Pacific Coast.\r\n    Considerable work has been done, preliminary to a full report\r\n    on the geology, mineralogy, and metallurgy of the Washoe region.\r\n\r\n    In the department of botany and agricultural geology, the work\r\n    has thus far been chiefly confined to collecting the plants of\r\n    the State.\r\n\r\n    Extensive duplicate suites have been preserved both for study\r\n    and exchange, the specimens now collected amounting to not\r\n    less than twelve thousand or fifteen thousand in number, and\r\n    embracing probably half of all the species described from the\r\n    State, besides many new and undescribed ones. The collections\r\n    have been made by Professor Brewer while engaged in geological\r\n    explorations, at a very trifling expenditure of time and money.\r\n\r\n    In the department of Agriculture proper, less has been done,\r\n    owing to limited means. Partial preparation was made for\r\n    investigating the subject of grape culture, and the production\r\n    of wines; but discontinued from the same cause. Especial\r\n    attention has been paid to our native forage plants, to aid in\r\n    devising some means of arresting the rapid decrease of forage\r\n    in this State, and correspondence entered into to obtain all\r\n    possible information on this subject from other regions whose\r\n    climates are similar to our own.\r\n\r\n    In the zoölogical department—in charge of Dr. J. G. Cooper,\r\n    who has been employed about half the time since the Survey was\r\n    commenced—the annexed table gives a succinct idea of what had\r\n    been accomplished, up to the close of the year 1862, in the way\r\n    of collecting.\r\n\r\n    f========+=================================================\r\n             |Number of species in the collection.\r\n             |     +-------------------------------------------\r\n             |     |Of which there are new to California.\r\n             |     |     +-------------------------------------\r\n             |     |     |Believed to be new, or undescribed.\r\n             |     |     |       +-----------------------------\r\n     Class.  |     |     |       |Other Californian species\r\n             |     |     |       |not yet collected.\r\n             |     |     |       |     +-----------------------\r\n             |     |     |       |     |Total number credited\r\n             |     |     |       |     |to California.\r\n             |     |     |       |     |     +-----------------\r\n             |     |     |       |     |     |Of which there\r\n             |     |     |       |     |     |are found east\r\n             |     |     |       |     |     |the Mississippi.\r\n    ---------+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----------------\r\n    Mammalia |  32 |  10 |   3   |  45 |  77 |  14\r\n    Birds    | 170 |  28 |   4(?)| 150 | 320 | 141\r\n    Reptiles |  36 |   6 |   3   |   9 |  45 |   0\r\n    Fishes   |  58 |  16 |  16   |  75 | 133 |   0\r\n    Mollusca | 335 | 123 | 123   |  65 | 400 |   0(?)\r\n    ---------+-----+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----------------\r\n\r\n    Of Articulata and Radiata no statistics can be given for want\r\n    of works especially devoted to the California species.\r\n\r\n    From this it appears that, notwithstanding the large\r\n    collections made by Government expeditions and by individuals,\r\n    during the last ten years, which have been elaborately\r\n    described in the Pacific Railroad and Mexican Boundary Reports,\r\n    the Smithsonian publications, and various other works, we have\r\n    been able to add materially to the known Fauna of California,\r\n    and of the country at large, even among the highest and best\r\n    known classes.\r\n\r\n    Arrangements have been made for having the collections in\r\n    natural history referred to the highest authorities in each\r\n    branch, and portions of our materials have already been placed\r\n    at the disposition of eminent men in Europe and the United\r\n    States for examination and description.\r\n\r\n    Deferring the fitting up of a laboratory, and the engaging\r\n    of a special assistant in the chemical department, until a\r\n    suitable permanent place could be provided in the State Museum\r\n    building, Mr. Ashburner went East in the spring of 1862 and\r\n    commenced the examination of some of the ores and minerals of\r\n    the State in the laboratory of the Sheffield Scientific School\r\n    of Yale College, under the direction of Professor Brush, who\r\n    has charge of the metallurgical department of that institution.\r\n    The reduction of the appropriation to fifteen thousand (15,000)\r\n    dollars for the year, made it necessary to suspend this work\r\n    soon after it was commenced, in order that the whole force of\r\n    the Survey might be concentrated on the field operations.\r\n\r\n    A small sum has been allowed to Mr. F. H. Storer, of Boston,\r\n    for a chemical investigation of the bituminous substances\r\n    found in different parts of the State. His researches will\r\n    probably be embodied in the first or second volume of the\r\n    annual reports. Qualitative examinations, as well as a few\r\n    quantitative ones, have been made at the office of the Survey,\r\n    of specimens which have been collected. A considerable number\r\n    of coals have been analyzed. Information in regard to ores and\r\n    minerals has been given to a large number of persons who have\r\n    applied for the same by letter or otherwise, as will always be\r\n    done when practicable.\r\n\r\n    If the survey is continued, it will be necessary to fit up\r\n    a complete laboratory, in which the important questions\r\n    constantly arising, both in regard to the composition and\r\n    metallurgic treatment of our ores, may be carefully and\r\n    systematically investigated.\r\n\r\n    No provision has yet been made by the Legislature for the\r\n    arrangement and exhibition of the collections made by the\r\n    Survey. These are already quite extensive, embracing many\r\n    thousand specimens of rocks, fossils, minerals, ores, all of\r\n    which are of importance in illustrating the Natural History,\r\n    the geological structure and the mineral resources of the\r\n    State. Such as have not been required for study remain packed\r\n    in boxes, and are stored at the office of the Survey in\r\n    Montgomery Block, San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    Of course it is highly desirable that a permanent, fire-proof\r\n    building should be provided for the State collections, the\r\n    proper disposition of which is a subject of great interest, not\r\n    only as connected with the welfare and progress of the survey,\r\n    but as influencing the educational and material progress of the\r\n    State.\r\n\r\n    The only official step thus far taken in this matter is the\r\n    appointment, by the last Legislature, of the State Geologist,\r\n    the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the State\r\n    Surveyor-General as a Board of Commissioners “to report to\r\n    the Legislature, on or before the second Monday of December,\r\n    1863, upon the feasibility of establishing a State University,\r\n    embracing an Agricultural College, a School of Mines, and a\r\n    Museum, _including the geological collections of the State_.”\r\n\r\n    A considerable number of specimens, some of them of value, have\r\n    been already given to the State by individuals; and there can\r\n    be no doubt that many interesting and valuable articles would\r\n    be contributed, provided it were demonstrated that they would\r\n    be properly exhibited, and well taken care of. It is believed,\r\n    that when the State Museum is once established, and a suitable\r\n    building provided, the value and importance of it to the\r\n    people will soon be made so clear, that it will be sustained\r\n    and fostered by the Legislature.\r\n\r\n    By the terms of the Act of the Legislature authorizing a\r\n    Geological Survey of the State of California, it was made\r\n    the duty of the State Geologist to present to the Governor,\r\n    to be laid before the Legislature, as near as may be to the\r\n    beginning of each session, a “Report of Progress,” in which\r\n    the operations of the Survey during the preceding year should\r\n    be set forth, and its more important practical results made\r\n    public. He is also required to communicate an account of the\r\n    expenditures, and to furnish estimates for the continuance of\r\n    the Survey.\r\n\r\n    By an Act of the Legislature of 1862, however, the State\r\n    Geologist was authorized to combine his first and second annual\r\n    reports into one volume, to be printed during the winter of\r\n    1862 and 1863, and an appropriation of $3,000 was made to pay\r\n    the expenses of printing, engraving, etc., while the size,\r\n    form, and style of the report, and the place of printing, were\r\n    left to the discretion of the State Geologist, under the advice\r\n    and with the approval of the Governor.\r\n\r\n    According to this, there is a report now due the State; but, as\r\n    no part of the appropriation of last year for the continuance\r\n    of the Survey has been yet received, or is likely to be, for\r\n    months to come, and as the appropriation for printing is in\r\n    the same condition, the work has been necessarily delayed. As\r\n    it is presumed that the amount due the Survey from last year\r\n    will be available some time next winter, it is not anticipated\r\n    that there will be any difficulty in issuing the first volume;\r\n    and, if the Legislature takes the necessary steps early in the\r\n    session, two, or perhaps three, volumes can be published in\r\n    1864. It is intended that they shall be of royal octavo size,\r\n    in the best style of typography, and illustrated with maps,\r\n    sections, plates of fossils, etc. The maps will be engraved on\r\n    copper and printed from transfers, in order the original plates\r\n    may be preserved, to be used, after necessary corrections and\r\n    revisions, in the final report, or otherwise, as may be found\r\n    desirable. The maps will be sold separately, with or without\r\n    the geological coloring, as desired. The first volume will\r\n    be chiefly devoted to the geology of the Coast Ranges; the\r\n    second to that of the Sierra Nevada and the mining districts\r\n    of the eastern slope. If my plans are not thwarted by the\r\n    Legislature, both these volumes will be issued together next\r\n    year, and will form a “Report of a Geological Reconnoissance\r\n    of the State of California.” By the law, as it now stands, the\r\n    publications of the Survey are required to be copy-righted,\r\n    and sold for the benefit of the Common School Fund; hence, it\r\n    has been impossible to communicate to the public, from time\r\n    to time, through the medium of the Academy’s publications,\r\n    the results which have been obtained. It is proper to say, in\r\n    this connection, that the extent of territory to be examined,\r\n    the complexity of the phenomena, and the bearing which our\r\n    investigations will have on important questions of economical\r\n    interest, make it eminently proper that there should not be an\r\n    undue haste exhibited, on the part of the Survey, to place its\r\n    results before the world. We can only hope to influence the\r\n    mining public, in this State, by degrees; and it is necessary,\r\n    first of all, that it should be made clearly to appear, with\r\n    the lapse of time, that our statements are to be relied on as\r\n    closely approximating to the truth.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney communicated the following letter from Professor Brush,\r\ngiving the results of a chemical investigation of the meteoric iron\r\npresented to the city of San Francisco, by General Carleton:\r\n\r\n                              SHEFFIELD LABORATORY OF YALE COLLEGE,\r\n                                       NEW HAVEN, March 30th, 1863.\r\n\r\n    _Professor J. D. Whitney, State Geologist, San Francisco, Cal._\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR:—I have examined the specimen of meteoric iron\r\n    from Tucson, which you sent me for analysis, and herewith\r\n    communicate to you my results.\r\n\r\n    The density of the mass is 7.29. When a fragment of it is\r\n    placed in a solution of neutral sulphate of copper, it quickly\r\n    becomes coated with metallic copper, proving the iron to be\r\n    “active.” An inspection of the specimen with a lens showed it\r\n    to be dotted with little cavities, which on the fresh fracture\r\n    were lined with a white silicious mineral, giving the surface a\r\n    porphyritic, or pseudo-porphyritic, appearance.\r\n\r\n    When a fragment was attacked with an acid, a portion of the\r\n    iron was dissolved, leaving the silicious mineral projecting\r\n    from the surface of the specimen; and with a magnifier, black\r\n    particles of Schreibersite could be seen. After complete\r\n    solution of the iron, a careful microscopic examination was\r\n    made of the insoluble residue. With a magnifying power of 25\r\n    diameters, it appeared to consist chiefly of two substances:\r\n    one a milk-white to transparent mineral, having a fused,\r\n    rounded surface, occurring in little globules, or elongated,\r\n    rounded particles; while the other constituent was black\r\n    and angular, and attractable by the magnet. The first named\r\n    substance, when observed with a magnifying power of 100\r\n    diameters, proved to contain minute specks of the black mineral\r\n    disseminated through it; some of the silicious fragments were\r\n    translucent and of a milk-white color, and others colorless\r\n    and transparent; a large number, however, were transparent at\r\n    one end, shading into milk-white at the other, thus seeming to\r\n    indicate that the transparent and translucent portions were not\r\n    two distinct minerals. A blowpipe examination of the silicious\r\n    mineral showed it to have characters very much resembling\r\n    _olivine_. The black mineral proved to be _Schreibersite_. A\r\n    minute trace of chromium was also observed in the insoluble\r\n    residue.\r\n\r\n    The qualitative analysis of the portion soluble in nitric\r\n    acid indicated the presence of iron, nickel, cobalt, copper,\r\n    phosphorus, lime, and magnesia with unweighable traces\r\n    of chlorine, sulphur, and alumina. For the quantitative\r\n    examination of the meteorite a fragment weighing 4.3767\r\n    grammes was treated with nitro-chlorohydric acid (aqua regia),\r\n    and after solution of the iron the whole was evaporated; on\r\n    approaching dryness, gelatinous silica separated, showing that\r\n    the silicate had been partially, at least, decomposed by the\r\n    acid. After heating until the silica was rendered insoluble,\r\n    it was repeatedly treated with acid and evaporated, so as to\r\n    insure the oxydation of all the Schreibersite, and finally\r\n    the soluble part was taken up with chlorohydric acid, and on\r\n    dilution separated by filtration from the silica and insoluble\r\n    residue.\r\n\r\n    The filtrate, or _soluble_ part, was accurately measured and\r\n    divided into four portions for analysis—two portions were used\r\n    for the determination of the iron, nickel, cobalt, phosphorus,\r\n    and alkaline earths; a third portion was employed to estimate\r\n    the copper, and the fourth portion was reserved to answer in\r\n    case of accident.\r\n\r\n    Two methods were used for the separation of the iron from the\r\n    nickel and cobalt—one by precipitation of the iron as basic\r\n    acetate, and the other by precipitation with carbonate of\r\n    baryta in the presence of an excess of chloride of ammonium;\r\n    but in neither case was the separation perfected on the first\r\n    precipitation, and traces of nickel remained with the iron\r\n    even after the second precipitation. The nickel and cobalt\r\n    were separated by means of nitrite of potash, and the cobalt\r\n    was subsequently converted into sulphate and as such weighed.\r\n    The lime and magnesia were separated by oxalate of ammonia,\r\n    care being taken to redissolve and reprecipitate the lime to\r\n    insure its being free from traces of magnesia. On spectroscopic\r\n    examination of the precipitate, it proved to be lime, free from\r\n    other alkaline earths.\r\n\r\n    The precipitate of iron, after being weighed, was fused with\r\n    carbonate of soda; the product of the fusion was dissolved in\r\n    chlorohydric acid, and the phosphoric acid precipitated with\r\n    molybdate of ammonia. This phospho-molybdic precipitate was\r\n    dissolved in ammonia to free it from possible traces of silica\r\n    and other impurities, and the phosphoric acid precipitated from\r\n    this solution by an ammoniacal mixture of sulphate of magnesia\r\n    and chloride of ammonium.\r\n\r\n    The copper was precipitated as sulphide by sulphuretted\r\n    hydrogen gas, redissolved in nitric acid, and determined as\r\n    oxyd.\r\n\r\n    The _insoluble residue_, containing free silica and\r\n    undecomposed silicate, was perfectly white, and free from all\r\n    traces of Schreibersite. It weighed 0.1855 grm. equal to 4.24\r\n    per cent. of the specimen analyzed. It was fused with carbonate\r\n    of soda, and the silica and bases determined in the usual\r\n    manner. It contained 0.159 grm. silica; 0.0054 protoxyd of\r\n    iron, with a minute trace of alumina; 0.0028 lime, and 0.0168\r\n    magnesia.\r\n\r\n    The soluble and insoluble portions gave in the analysis the\r\n    following per centage composition:\r\n\r\n                                        Considering the silica\r\n                                         to exist as olivine.\r\n\r\n    Iron                 81.56                         79.44\r\n    Nickel                9.17                          9.17\r\n    Cobalt                0.44                          0.44\r\n    Copper                0.08                          0.08\r\n    Phosphorus            0.49                          0.49\r\n    Silica                3.63 } Combined with 2.73  }\r\n    Protoxyd of Iron with      }   Protoxyd of Iron, } 10.07\r\n      trace of Alumina    0.12 }   making Olivine    }\r\n    Lime                  1.16 }\r\n    Magnesia              2.43 }\r\n    Chlorine, }\r\n    Sulphur,  }    minute traces                      traces\r\n    Chromium, }\r\n                         -----                         -----\r\n                         99.08                         99.69\r\n\r\n    If the silica found in this analysis be considered to exist in\r\n    combination with lime, magnesia, and iron, in the proportions\r\n    to form olivine, it will be necessary to deduct 2.12 per cent.\r\n    from the amount of metallic iron (equal to 2.73 per cent. of\r\n    protoxyd of iron), in order to give the silicate the olivine\r\n    formula, (3 R O, Si O₃). Admitting this to be the correct view,\r\n    the mass analyzed contains 10.07 per cent. of olivine, and by\r\n    the addition of the oxygen of the protoxyd of iron the analysis\r\n    adds up 99.69 instead of 99.08.\r\n\r\n    The variable composition of Schreibersite in different\r\n    specimens of meteoric iron, and the peculiar character of the\r\n    insoluble residue of this meteorite, together with the small\r\n    amount of material in my possession, rendered it impracticable\r\n    to determine the exact amount of this substance contained in\r\n    the specimen.\r\n\r\n    The composition of this meteorite corresponds very closely\r\n    with another meteoric-iron from Tucson, discovered by Mr.\r\n    Bartlett, and described by Prof. J. Lawrence Smith, in the\r\n    _American Journal of Science_, vol. XIX, page 161. Dr. Smith’s\r\n    analysis gives Iron 85.54, Nickel 8.55, Cobalt 0.61, Copper\r\n    0.03, Phosphorus 0.12, Chromic-oxyd 0.21, Magnesia 2.04, Silica\r\n    3.02, Alumina, trace = 100.18. He considers it to correspond to\r\n    Nickeliferous Iron 93.81, Chrome Iron 0.41, Schreibersite 0.84,\r\n    Olivine 5.06 = 100.18. By an evident inadvertence Dr. Smith\r\n    adds the magnesia and silica together, and gives the sum as\r\n    olivine; these substances are obviously not in the proportions\r\n    to form the silicate 3 R O, Si O₃, and if we consider the\r\n    silicate to be olivine, we must reckon the excess of silica\r\n    as combined with protoxyd of iron. To do this, we must deduct\r\n    2.78 from the amount of metallic iron (equal to 2.58 protoxyd\r\n    of iron), necessary to be combined with the silica and magnesia\r\n    to give the olivine formula. The amount of olivine contained\r\n    in the Bartlett meteoric-iron will then be 8.64 per cent. Thus\r\n    the two masses of iron will be seen to agree very nearly in\r\n    composition, the only trifling difference being, that Dr. Smith\r\n    has determined quantitatively the small amount of chromium\r\n    contained in the Bartlett meteorite, while I have found a\r\n    little lime and traces of sulphur and chlorine in the specimen\r\n    you sent to me. The specific gravity I have stated to be 7.39;\r\n    this was taken on about 12.5 grammes of the iron, and probably\r\n    is somewhat higher than the portion which I analyzed, as the\r\n    two surfaces of the larger mass had been rubbed down, and as\r\n    thus a considerable portion of the exposed silicate would be\r\n    mechanically removed, it would make the density correspondingly\r\n    higher.\r\n\r\n    I regret that I had not more of this interesting meteorite at\r\n    my command, in order to have determined more definitely and\r\n    satisfactorily the character of the insoluble residue. I shall\r\n    be glad to make a further investigation of this point if you\r\n    will supply me with more material.\r\n\r\n                     Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     GEO. J. BRUSH.\r\n\r\nAfter reading the above letter, Professor Whitney added some remarks on\r\nthe form and locality of the meteoric iron analyzed by Professor Brush,\r\nstating the circumstances under which it came in possession of the city\r\nof San Francisco.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fourth of November, 1862, the Board of Supervisors of this\r\ncity received, through Mayor Teschemacher, a letter from General George\r\nWright, commanding the Department of the Pacific, stating that he had\r\nreceived a mass of meteoric iron from General Carleton, commanding the\r\n“Column from California,” and which mass he, in accordance with General\r\nCarleton’s request, placed at the disposal of the city authorities.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carleton’s letter is here appended:\r\n\r\n                              HEAD QUARTERS COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA,\r\n                                  Tucson, Arizona, June 30th, 1862.\r\n\r\n    _TO GENERAL GEORGE WRIGHT, U. S. Army, Commander Dep. of the\r\n    Pacific, San Francisco, Cal._\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR GENERAL:—Soon after my arrival at this place I sent\r\n    by a train to Fort Yuma, to be shipped to your address at San\r\n    Francisco, a very large and beautiful AEROLITE, which I found\r\n    here and which I had heard and read of for many years. In\r\n    _Bartlett’s Explorations_, vol. 2, page 297, it is described\r\n    as follows: “In the afternoon,” July 18th, 1853, “I called to\r\n    take leave of General Blanco, and at the same time examine\r\n    a remarkable _meteorite_, which is used for an anvil in a\r\n    blacksmith’s shop. This mass resembles native iron, and weighs\r\n    about six hundred pounds. Its greatest length is five feet. Its\r\n    exterior is quite smooth, while the lower part which projects\r\n    from the larger leg is very jagged and rough. It was found\r\n    about twenty miles distant on the road towards Tubac and about\r\n    eight miles from the road.”\r\n\r\n    I desire that you present this aerolite to the City of San\r\n    Francisco, to be placed upon the PLAZA, there to remain for the\r\n    inspection of the people and for examination by the youth of\r\n    the city forever. It will be a durable memento of the march of\r\n    the _Column from California_.\r\n\r\n    I am, General, sincerely and respectfully,\r\n\r\n                     Your friend and servant,\r\n\r\n                                            JAMES H. CARLETON,\r\n                                       _Brigadier General U. S. A._\r\n\r\nSoon after this mass of meteoric iron came into the possession of the\r\ncity, I obtained permission from the Board of Supervisors to have sawn\r\nfrom it a small piece for analysis and for distribution to a few of\r\nthe principal public institutions in this country and Europe having\r\ncollections of aerolites; this has been done, and also a fine photograph\r\nof it taken by Mr. C. E. Watkins, of which copies will be forwarded, with\r\nthe specimens of the mass itself, as convenient opportunity offers.\r\n\r\nThe piece intended for analytical examination was sent to Professor\r\nBrush of Yale College, and a letter has just been received from him\r\ngiving the results, which will be found in the preceding pages, and which\r\nmay appropriately be followed by a few remarks on the size and general\r\nappearance of the mass, with such other facts in regard to it as may be\r\nof general interest.\r\n\r\n    The weight of the mass of which the analysis is given above\r\n    was six hundred and thirty-two pounds, when it arrived in this\r\n    city, and about two pounds have been since cut from it.\r\n\r\n    Its shape is irregular, but in general it is that of a\r\n    flattened elongated slab, having a length of four feet one inch\r\n    and an average breadth of about eighteen inches; its thickness\r\n    is irregular, varying from two to five inches. It has evidently\r\n    been long used as an anvil, having been partly buried in the\r\n    ground in an upright position, having a flat face of about\r\n    four inches square on the top, with two holes drilled in the\r\n    projecting edge for adding to the convenience of its use as a\r\n    blacksmith’s anvil.\r\n\r\n    The mass is now placed in the Mayor’s office, it having been\r\n    deemed inadvisable to expose it on the Plaza, as desired by\r\n    the donor, on account of its liability to rust in the damp\r\n    atmosphere of San Francisco, and the difficulty of securing it\r\n    from injury by careless or mischievous handling.\r\n\r\n    Professor Brush remarks that “the composition of this meteorite\r\n    corresponds very closely with that of _another_ meteoric\r\n    iron from Tucson” discovered by Mr. Bartlett and analyzed by\r\n    Professor J. Lawrence Smith. A comparison of the analyses of\r\n    Professors Brush and Smith and a reference to Mr. Bartlett’s\r\n    work seem to render it highly probable, to say the least, that\r\n    the two analyses were of pieces cut from the same mass.\r\n\r\n    In this connection I will add to General Carleton’s quotation\r\n    from Mr. Bartlett’s book a few lines which complete what is\r\n    said in regard to the meteorites seen by him at Tucson. Mr.\r\n    Bartlett adds, after stating that the mass was found about\r\n    twenty miles distant towards Tubac and about eight miles from\r\n    the road, “where we were told are many larger masses. The\r\n    annexed drawing gives the appearance of this singular mass.\r\n    There is another large mass within the garrison grounds, of\r\n    which I did not take a sketch. With much labor Dr. Webb broke\r\n    off a fragment of this meteorite, for the purpose of analysis.”\r\n\r\n    The wood cut which Mr. Bartlett gives of the meteoric iron,\r\n    which he notices as having been used as an anvil, shows at\r\n    once, as does also the description, that, contrary to General\r\n    Carleton’s idea, this mass and the one which is now in San\r\n    Francisco, are not the same. The mass figured by Mr. Bartlett\r\n    is of a very peculiar shape, well adapting it to use as a\r\n    common blacksmith’s anvil, as it has a broad, flat top, and is\r\n    supported by two legs.\r\n\r\n    In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable\r\n    to suppose that the mass forwarded by General Carleton is the\r\n    one spoken of by Mr. Bartlett as “another larger mass,” and of\r\n    which no drawing was made; while, on the other hand, a piece\r\n    was taken for analysis. This piece is almost certainly the one\r\n    analyzed by Dr. Smith, and hence the close agreement in the two\r\n    analyses—this chemist, however, not having apparently made so\r\n    complete a separation of the nickel as Prof. Brush has done.\r\n    Still it is possible, of course, that different portions of the\r\n    mass may differ slightly in composition.\r\n\r\nDr. Blake read the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nInfusoria from the Moving Sands in the Neighborhood of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n    The infusoria to which I would call the attention of the\r\n    Society, were collected from the sands in the neighborhood of\r\n    Point Lobos. These sands form a moving surface, which in dry\r\n    weather is drifted by the prevailing winds from the shore of\r\n    the ocean landwards, and are entirely devoid of any signs of\r\n    vegetation for some distance from the shore. On walking over\r\n    these sands when a strong north-west wind was blowing, a wind\r\n    that does not bring up any fresh sand from the ocean beach at\r\n    that part of the sand field, I noticed a number of small sized\r\n    bodies projecting above the surface of the sand as it was being\r\n    carried onwards by the wind. A closer examination showed that\r\n    these bodies were formed of particles of sand, agglutinated\r\n    together by some substance which rendered them almost black,\r\n    and where dried possessing considerable tenacity. Some of\r\n    these bodies projected as much as an inch and a half above\r\n    the surface of the sand, with which however they all remained\r\n    connected, forming generally small ridges. On examining a\r\n    portion of this agglutinated sand under the microscope, the\r\n    water with which I had moistened it was found to be full of\r\n    infusoria, which commenced moving about as soon as the sand\r\n    was moistened, although it had been quite dry for some days\r\n    before being examined. These infusoria probably belong to the\r\n    genus Monas, but they are so extremely minute that it was\r\n    impossible to resolve them; they were, in fact, the smallest\r\n    living infusoria I had ever examined. With a quarter-inch\r\n    object glass of Powell and Lelands, they appeared as small\r\n    globular moving bodies, although occasionally a movement would\r\n    present one of them with apparently a narrow edge. Nothing\r\n    much more definite could be made out with the microscope\r\n    of my friend, Dr. Trask, when using an eighth object glass\r\n    of Smith and Beck, as they could not be resolved into any\r\n    form sufficiently definite to classify them. They appeared\r\n    mostly as globular bodies moving about slowly, and presenting\r\n    sometimes a longer axis, one end being larger than the other,\r\n    and offering the appearance as if there was a semi-transparent\r\n    mass attached to the larger end. The size was estimated at\r\n    from a fifteenth to the twenty-thousandth of an inch. After a\r\n    careful examination I was unable to detect any vegetable or\r\n    organic nucleus which might have served as a nidus for these\r\n    masses of infusoria. They would seem to become developed in the\r\n    pure sand, or at least in the sand as it was blown up from the\r\n    beach, after the salt had been washed out of it by the rain.\r\n    [I would remark that it had been raining some days before I\r\n    collected them.] Subsequent researches have shown that these\r\n    infusoria are very generally diffused through the sands that\r\n    form our drifting sand-hills around the city; and on examining\r\n    some sand taken at a depth of fourteen feet from the surface,\r\n    where the hills were being cut through, I found it full of\r\n    well developed infusoria on placing it under the microscope\r\n    a few minutes after it had been collected, so that there can\r\n    be no doubt but that these infusoria were present in the sand\r\n    at the time it was collected, where they had probably been in\r\n    a torpid state for ages. It is possible that they might have\r\n    been carried there by the infiltrating water during the rains;\r\n    but I am inclined to think that they had been torpid there, as\r\n    the circumstances in which they were placed were not favorable\r\n    for propagation except by fission, a process that cannot be\r\n    carried on indefinitely, even in these lower organisms. In\r\n    fact, these infusoria, taken from the deep sands, copulated\r\n    most extensively the moment they were placed in water. I am\r\n    not aware that analogous observations have been made as to the\r\n    office of these lower infusoria in fixing the moving sands, and\r\n    thus initiating that series of changes by which they eventually\r\n    become clothed with verdure; the first germs of organic life\r\n    being generally supposed to be established by the lower\r\n    vegetable organisms.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg presented the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of Two New Species of Plants.\r\n\r\nBY A.

It is a vast geological\r\n    process of which we are the actual spectators, offering us\r\n    the most imposing terrestrial phenomenon of which we can be\r\n    cognizant, and at the same time affording us some tangible\r\n    idea of the vast periods that have been required for bringing\r\n    the surface of the earth to its present shape. It is the\r\n    general opinion of geologists that the western shore of our\r\n    continent is gradually rising. This has been proved to be the\r\n    case as regards the southern portion of the continent; but the\r\n    following facts, observed in the neighborhood of this city,\r\n    afford undoubted evidence that at least this portion of the\r\n    northern continent is being gradually elevated above the level\r\n    of the ocean.\r\n\r\n    On the northern bank of Lobos Creek, a small stream running\r\n    from Mountain Lake to the ocean, muscle shells and rolled\r\n    pebbles are found at an elevation of from eighty to one hundred\r\n    feet above the present level of the ocean, and probably at\r\n    the distance of half a mile from the present beach. These\r\n    shells and pebbles are exactly analogous to those now being\r\n    deposited at the mouth of the creek, and were undoubtedly\r\n    placed there when the spots at which they are found formed\r\n    the beach of the ocean. The surface of the country is so much\r\n    covered by drifting sands, that it is only in spots that\r\n    these shore remains show themselves. The deposits first seen\r\n    contain remains of shells considerably weathered—lower down\r\n    the creek, shells and larger pebbles are seen; still lower\r\n    down I found the same materials mixed with smaller pebbles,\r\n    and at an elevation of about fifty feet small bands of black\r\n    peat earth were found interstratified with the sand and gravel.\r\n    These small bands of vegetable earth were evidently formed near\r\n    the level of the ocean by the waves throwing up a barrier of\r\n    sand which dammed up the waters of the creek, so as to form a\r\n    pond in which a layer of vegetable matter was deposited. This\r\n    process is going on at the present time, a dam having been\r\n    thrown up by the heavy storms of the winter of 1861-1862.\r\n\r\n    Another evidence of the recent elevation of the country is\r\n    seen near the western end of the Puerta Suelo, at a distance\r\n    of about eight miles from the city. Here there is a depression\r\n    in the hills, extending from the bay to the ocean, and forming\r\n    a narrow neck to the peninsula on which San Francisco stands.\r\n    Even at present, the distance from the waters of the bay to the\r\n    ocean is not more than two or three miles at this point, and\r\n    it is evident that at no very distant period this depression\r\n    formed a channel of communication between them. Near the\r\n    western end of this former channel, and at about a mile inland\r\n    from the present sea beach, the skeleton of the head of a whale\r\n    is found on the surface of the ground. The specimen measures\r\n    about six feet across, and must have belonged to an animal\r\n    fifty or sixty feet long. The bones, which are not at all\r\n    mineralised, are in a good state of preservation. At the time\r\n    they were carried there, there must have been eight or ten feet\r\n    of water over the surface, and as the place is at present from\r\n    ten to fifteen feet above the level of the ocean, a rise of\r\n    twenty-five or thirty feet must have taken place at this spot\r\n    since the animal was washed there.\r\n\r\n    Another locality at which evidence of the gradual elevation of\r\n    the land can be obtained is found to the west of Black Point,\r\n    where abundant remains of our present bay shells are found at\r\n    a considerable elevation above the level of the sea; and, were\r\n    not the surface of the country, particularly the lower levels,\r\n    so completely covered in by the drifting sands, no doubt many\r\n    analogous deposits could be found. To the south and west of\r\n    the Mission, and in all the lower levels between there and the\r\n    range of hills overlooking the Puerta Suelo, the surface is\r\n    covered by these recent post tertiary deposits, through which\r\n    the older rocks protrude in many places as isolated masses,\r\n    the recent argillaceous sandstone being deposited in nearly\r\n    horizontal strata around their base. These sandstones have\r\n    given rise, by their decomposition, to the extensive surfaces\r\n    of yellow sandy loam seen between the Mission and the Ocean\r\n    House. I think the highest of these beds does not attain a\r\n    greater elevation than one hundred feet above the present level\r\n    of the ocean.\r\n\r\n    More recent evidence of the gradual elevation of the land is\r\n    furnished by the holes made by the marine worms in the rocks\r\n    on the shores of the bay, many of these holes being found at\r\n    elevations which the highest tides do not at present reach.\r\n\r\n    On the age of these deposits it is useless at present to\r\n    speculate. All that we know for certain is, that geologically\r\n    speaking, they are recent; but whether it is five hundred, or\r\n    five thousand, or fifty thousand years since the present site\r\n    of Mountain Lake was on a level with the ocean, our present\r\n    data do not enable us to form an opinion. All that the facts\r\n    prove is that this portion of the continent is being gradually\r\n    raised en masse.\r\n\r\n    From observations I have made on the main range of the Sierra,\r\n    I am inclined to think that this process of gradual elevation\r\n    is not confined to the land bordering the sea coast, but\r\n    extends far into the interior. The undisturbed position of the\r\n    post tertiary strata on the western slope of the Sierra, would\r\n    indicate that the same process of gradual elevation must have\r\n    been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, so that the\r\n    original beach of the earlier post tertiary ocean is now at\r\n    an elevation of four or five thousand feet above the present\r\n    level of the sea. Should subsequent observations confirm the\r\n    truth of this supposition, this country would afford a more\r\n    striking example of the action of existing causes in modifying\r\n    the surface of the earth, than is to be found in any other\r\n    portion of the globe. It is desirable that some means should be\r\n    taken to ascertain and record accurately the present relative\r\n    level of the sea and land, as, after a few years, such a\r\n    determination might furnish some very useful geological data.\r\n    I have no doubt that it will be found that every shock of an\r\n    earthquake is accompanied by an elevation of the land.\r\n\r\n    SAN FRANCISCO, July 6th, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JULY 20TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Bayerque, Esq., was elected a Life Member.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Cabinet: A number of birds and quadrupeds were deposited\r\nby Mr. W. W. Holder.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library:\r\n\r\nAscent of Pike’s Peak by Dr. C. C. Parry. Biennial Report of the Chicago\r\nHistorical Society to the Governor of Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe Corresponding Secretary read a letter from Samuel H. Scudder, Esq.,\r\nto Dr. Behr, from which the following extracts are taken:\r\n\r\n    “Through the kindness of Mr. Edwards, I have had the\r\n    opportunity of looking at your two recent papers on\r\n    _Argynnides_ and on _Danais_, and have been much interested\r\n    therein. Reading the latter article, I instantly had recalled\r\n    to me some statements in regard to localization of the species\r\n    at the Sandwich Islands by the sons of one or two American\r\n    missionaries long resident there—gentlemen in every way to be\r\n    depended on for common accuracy—by those statements I was led\r\n    to an opposite conclusion from yours in regard to the means\r\n    by which it was introduced; and since I have read your paper\r\n    I have met with Dr. Gulick, for some time a missionary at\r\n    Ascension Island, one of the Micronesian group, now in America\r\n    for his health, from whom I have received some additional\r\n    facts. They all concur in stating that this butterfly was\r\n    formerly wanting at the Sandwich Islands, and spread over the\r\n    Islands just as fast as did the milk-weed upon which they\r\n    feed—the two keeping pace with one another. Dr. Gulick makes\r\n    some more definite statements; he says that a gentleman in\r\n    Hawaii sent him on Ascension Island (2,000 or 3,000 miles\r\n    distant) a large box of plants under glass; that when they\r\n    reached Ascension Island he found among them the milk-weed,\r\n    which was set out with others; in five or six weeks they\r\n    reached maturity, and then they discovered upon them the\r\n    larvæ of _Danais_ which nearly destroyed them—the natives\r\n    have never before seen them and the butterfly was altogether\r\n    unknown, indeed, no such large and showy butterfly exists\r\n    there. Subsequently and purposely, as an experiment, he took\r\n    some seeds to the opposite side of the Island, twenty-five\r\n    miles distant, and sowed them, and was absent some four or five\r\n    months; when he returned the larvæ were there. A gentleman\r\n    and the natives had been put upon the watch by him for the\r\n    butterflies but none had been seen, and these larvæ changing\r\n    produced the first they had any of them seen.\r\n\r\n    “It seems to me that the appearance of the larvæ on the\r\n    transported plant in its early growth leaves but little room to\r\n    doubt that the eggs of the insect were transported also in the\r\n    Wardian case.”\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney read the following notice of the large mass of meteoric\r\niron now in this city, on its way to the Smithsonian Institution:\r\n\r\n    By a singular coincidence, we have now the pleasure of seeing\r\n    in this city the two great masses of meteoric iron which\r\n    have been so often spoken of as being at Tucson, in Arizona,\r\n    one of which was brought here and presented to the city by\r\n    General Carleton, in November last, a notice of which, with an\r\n    analysis, has already appeared in our proceedings. This mass\r\n    may properly be designated as the “Carleton (Tucson) Meteoric\r\n    Iron,” while the one which is destined for the Smithsonian\r\n    Institution may be called the “Ainsa (Tucson) Meteoric Iron,”\r\n    as it has been rendered accessible for scientific investigation\r\n    by Mr. Jesus M. Ainsa, as will be seen by the following\r\n    memorandum of the circumstance kindly furnished by his brother,\r\n    Mr. James M. Ainsa:\r\n\r\n    “This aerolite was first discovered by the early Jesuit\r\n    Missionaries in the mountains called the ‘Sierra de la Madera,’\r\n    near Tucson.\r\n\r\n    “In 1735, El Capitan de las Provincias del Occidente, Don Juan\r\n    Bautista Anza, induced by the accounts of the science-loving\r\n    Jesuits, ordered the aerolite to be removed from the mountains,\r\n    with the intention of sending it to Spain. However, through the\r\n    want of wagon roads and the proper means of conveyance at that\r\n    time, to take it to San Blas, then the nearest port of entry,\r\n    the attempt was entirely abandoned.\r\n\r\n    “The aerolite was left at Tucson, where it continued to attract\r\n    the attention of the scientific men who visited that country\r\n    for more than a hundred years. Since the acquisition of\r\n    Arizona by the United States, greater notice has been taken of\r\n    this aerolite, it having been mentioned several times in the\r\n    official reports of the Government agents.\r\n\r\n    “By a singular coincidence, Augustin Ainsa, the great-grandson\r\n    of Don Juan Bautista Anza, undertook, in 1860, to transport the\r\n    aerolite and present it to the Smithsonian Institution. With\r\n    great difficulty it was brought as far as the Yñigo hacienda,\r\n    where it remained until May, 1863, when Jesus M. Ainsa, in\r\n    his late visit to Sonora, brought it to this city, with the\r\n    intention of forwarding it to the Smithsonian Institution at\r\n    Washington, where it will soon be sent.”\r\n\r\n    At present the mass in question lies upon the steps of the\r\n    Custom House, where it has been most admirably photographed by\r\n    Mr. Watkins.[2]\r\n\r\n    It was said by Mr. Ainsa to weigh 1,600 pounds.\r\n\r\n    The shape of this meteoric mass is very peculiar; and, at\r\n    first, it would hardly be recognized as the identical specimen\r\n    figured by Mr. Bartlett at Tucson, especially as this gentleman\r\n    estimated its weight at 600 pounds only. Instead of being, as\r\n    Mr. Bartlett supposed, a mass supported on two legs, it is,\r\n    in reality, a ring of metal, of very irregular dimensions, of\r\n    which about one-quarter was buried in the ground, in order to\r\n    support it in a convenient position for use as an anvil, when\r\n    it was seen by him at Tucson.\r\n\r\n    The dimensions of this ring are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Greatest exterior diameter                           49  inches.\r\n    Least exterior diameter                              38   ”\r\n    Greatest width of central opening                    26½  ”\r\n    Least width of central opening                       23   ”\r\n    Greatest thickness at right angles to plane of ring  10   ”\r\n    Width of thickest part of the ring                   17½  ”\r\n    Width of narrowest part                               2¾  ”\r\n\r\n    The weight of the mass corresponds, taking the specific gravity\r\n    at 7.2, with a circle-ring, having an average width of one\r\n    foot, and a thickness of a small fraction less than eight\r\n    inches—the diameter of the circle represented by the exterior\r\n    of the ring being assumed as four feet.\r\n\r\n    On examining with a magnifying glass a fractured surface of\r\n    the mass, it was seen at once to be different in composition\r\n    from the Carleton Meteoric Iron, and my conjecture that Prof.\r\n    Smith was mistaken in supposing that he analyzed a fragment\r\n    from the mass figured by Mr. Bartlett, was confirmed.[3] It is\r\n    now almost certain that Messrs. Brush and Smith did analyze\r\n    fragments of the same meteoric iron.\r\n\r\n    The Ainsa Meteoric Iron contains a large per centage of a\r\n    white—almost transparent—silicious mineral, having a vitreous\r\n    lustre, which may be olivine; but the amount seems larger than\r\n    that in the Carleton mass. The Smithsonian Institution will\r\n    undoubtedly cause a chemical investigation to be made of this\r\n    superb meteoric mass, and it will be interesting to compare its\r\n    composition with that of the Carleton meteorite, as the two\r\n    were found so near each other that they may be supposed to have\r\n    formed portions of the same body, and to have fallen at the\r\n    same time.\r\n\r\n    The photograph was taken by Mr. Watkins, at my request,\r\n    partly to be sent abroad as a specimen of the high degree of\r\n    perfection which has been attained by this gentleman in this\r\n    department of art, and partly that an exact representation\r\n    might be secured of this very remarkable body, in case it\r\n    should be lost or captured on its way to Washington.\r\n\r\n    In concluding this notice, the following statement is given of\r\n    all that is known of the size and position of the masses of\r\n    meteoric iron which have been noticed by various travelers in\r\n    Arizona and the adjacent portions of Mexico and New Mexico.\r\n\r\n    _In the Madera range_, “Sierra de la Madera,” between Tucson\r\n    and Tubac, “enormous masses of pure iron, some of which were\r\n    transported to Tucson, and for many years were to be seen in\r\n    the Plaza of that Presidio.” Francisco Velasco, in W. F. Nye’s\r\n    Translation of his work on Sonora, p. 146, published at San\r\n    Francisco in 1861.—Two of these masses have been brought to\r\n    this city, the one weighing 1,600, the other 632 pounds; the\r\n    question arises, how many more are left in the Sierra Madera?\r\n    To this, no answer can be given at present.\r\n\r\n    “At the _Hacienda de Concepcion_, on the road from Chihuahua to\r\n    Rio Florida,” a mass of meteoric iron estimated to weigh 3,853\r\n    lbs.—Bartlett. The exact locality of this hacienda I have not\r\n    been able to ascertain.\r\n\r\n    “_Ninety miles north-west of Santa Rosa_,” supposed to be\r\n    the Santa Rosa in the province of Coahuila, in Mexico, lat.\r\n    28°, long. 101° 30’; Ass’t A. Schott, of the Mexican Boundary\r\n    Survey, reports a large number of masses of meteoric iron; see\r\n    page 34, Part II, of Major Emory’s Report. This statement needs\r\n    confirmation.\r\n\r\n    “_Sancha Estate, some fifty or sixty miles from Santa Rosa, in\r\n    the north of Coahuila._” This is the locality of the mass of\r\n    meteoric iron, weighing 252 pounds, and now in the collection\r\n    of the Smithsonian Institution, figured, described and analyzed\r\n    by Professor Smith; see Smithsonian Report for 1855, p. 154,\r\n    and Silliman’s Journal, (2) XIX, 160. Professor Smith says,\r\n    “various accounts were given of the precise locality, but none\r\n    seemed very satisfactory.” It is not unlikely that this mass is\r\n    from the same locality mentioned by Mr. Schott.\r\n\r\n    “_Near the South-western edge of the Balson de Mapimi, on the\r\n    route to the Mines of Parral_, there is a meteorite, near the\r\n    road, of not less than a ton weight;” on the authority of Mr.\r\n    Weidner, of the mines of Freiberg, as stated by Professor Smith\r\n    (Smithsonian Report for 1855, page 155), Mapimi is in lon. 103°\r\n    30’; lat. 25° 45’ nearly.\r\n\r\n    “_At the Hacienda of Venagas_, there was (1827) a piece of iron\r\n    that would make a cylinder, one yard in length, with a diameter\r\n    of ten inches. It was said to have been brought from the\r\n    mountains near the Hacienda.” Professor Smith, on the authority\r\n    of Dr. Berlandier (Smithsonian Report for 1855, p. 155), makes\r\n    the above statement; the exact locality of the Hacienda I have\r\n    been unable to ascertain; it is probably nearly in lat. 24°,\r\n    lon. 101°.\r\n\r\n    _La Paz, New Mexico_, near the Colorado River, about lat. 33°\r\n    30’. A mass of meteoric iron, weighing 10 pounds, was brought\r\n    from that locality, in 1862, by Mr. H. Ehrenberg.\r\n\r\n    A number of other localities of meteoric iron might be added\r\n    from more southern and central portions of Mexico; but as that\r\n    is a region to which the attention of Californian explorers\r\n    and capitalists has not yet been much directed, it will not be\r\n    necessary to cite them here. It is hoped that the circulation\r\n    of the above list may be the means of procuring further\r\n    information in regard to the masses of iron noticed; and that,\r\n    possibly, more of them may be brought to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    [2] The mass was shipped on the Panama steamer, which sailed\r\n    from San Francisco on the 3d of August.\r\n\r\n    [3] See page 34, of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 3D, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, eleven members.\r\n\r\nF.

G. COOPER, M.D.\r\n\r\n    The following species were collected while exploring for the\r\n    State Geological Survey, along the main land and islands\r\n    bordering Santa Barbara channel, in May, June, and July last.\r\n    Besides those described as new, I obtained additional specimens\r\n    of some of those described in 1862, confirming the specific\r\n    characters then given, and to some extent establishing the\r\n    generic more accurately.\r\n\r\n    Careful notes and drawings from living specimens furnish the\r\n    basis of most of the descriptions, together with examination of\r\n    the specimens in alcohol.\r\n\r\n    With regard to localities, it must be noticed that “Santa\r\n    Barbara” and “Santa Barbara Island” are very distinct both in\r\n    local characteristics and the groups of animals inhabiting\r\n    them. The island is about seventy-five miles from the town,\r\n    and thirty-five from the nearest main land. Catalina Island is\r\n    twenty-four miles from the main land, and very different in\r\n    its molluscous animals from both the main land and the other\r\n    islands, being the richest locality on our shores.\r\n\r\n    I have not been able to compare these species with those from\r\n    South America described by D’Orbigny and others; but, like\r\n    our other littoral mollusca, they are probably distinct.\r\n    I have, however, found the pelagic species _Ommastrephes\r\n    giganteus_ D’Orb in large numbers, and “hundreds” of a species\r\n    of _Argonauta_ washed ashore last spring as far north as Santa\r\n    Cruz Island, as I was informed by Dr. Shaw, who presented\r\n    specimens to the State collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n    APLYSIA Linn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A. californica_ Cooper. State Collection, species 1045.\r\n\r\n    Form and external appearance as usual in the genus. Length\r\n    fifteen inches, breadth five, height about the same. Color\r\n    pale gray or greenish, becoming purplish on the side, folds of\r\n    mantle with scattered white specks, from which an irregular\r\n    network of brown lines extends over the rest of the body,\r\n    interspersed with large brown blotches. Inner surface of mantle\r\n    varied with alternating painted bars of white and dark brown\r\n    interlocking together. Sole of foot black. Eyes very minute and\r\n    black.\r\n\r\n    _Shell_ contained in the substance of the mantle cartilaginous,\r\n    translucent, trapezoidal or hatchet-shaped, margins rounded,\r\n    slightly convex above, the nucleus or centre in old specimens\r\n    distant from the posterior end or apex. Faint radiating lines\r\n    diverging from the nucleus, crossed by an irregular network of\r\n    darker lines, all ending abruptly at some distance from the\r\n    margin, which has thus a wide, nearly transparent border. An\r\n    accessory plate arises on the inner surface from the nucleus,\r\n    spatulate in form and slightly raised.\r\n\r\n    The two younger specimens have the clear border and accessory\r\n    plate less developed, and very young ones do not probably show\r\n    these characters at all, but resemble the typical _Aplysia_\r\n    in the form of the shell. On this account I am unwilling to\r\n    constitute it a new genus, but propose to call it a sub-genus\r\n    under the name of NEAPLYSIA.\r\n\r\n    There was no appearance of a multiplication of shells, said\r\n    to occur in old specimens of _Aplysia_. Not having any full\r\n    description of the internal anatomy of _Aplysia_, I cannot at\r\n    present determine whether there are many other differences in\r\n    structure.\r\n\r\n    The stomach was full of large fragments of _Algæ_. I found\r\n    three specimens only, on the beach at San Pedro, July 25th,\r\n    just after a heavy blow which occurred at the lowest summer\r\n    tides. Kept in water for some time, they were very slow and\r\n    uninteresting in movements, showing no evidence of any means of\r\n    defence except the exudation of a beautiful purple fluid from\r\n    the mantle when handled. This fluid, common to the Aplysiæ,\r\n    though formerly supposed to be poisonous and indelible,\r\n    possesses no such properties, though it may be a defence\r\n    against marine animals which attack them.\r\n\r\n    The figure, taken from a tracing of the shell, and electrotyped\r\n    by Dr. A. Kellogg, represent the inner surface of the most\r\n    developed specimen, of the natural size.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    NAVARCHUS, Cooper, Proc. Cal. Acad.

The tentacles are club-shaped, the branchial 7-8 parted,\r\n    bipinnate and from one opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Doris sanguinea_ Cooper, loc. cit. (_Asteronotus._)\r\n\r\n    Four specimens found with the last, differ from the type only\r\n    in having the black spots very small. The tentacles are acute,\r\n    cylindro-conic, retractile into a cavity bordered by a toothed\r\n    membrane. The branchiæ form an erect chimney-shaped expansion.\r\n    I cannot discover the stellate valvular structure of the\r\n    branchial opening, which characterises the genus _Asteronotus_,\r\n    in these specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Doris Sandiegensis_ Cooper, loc. cit.\r\n\r\n    Two found with the last agree exactly with specimens from\r\n    San Diego. The tentacles are conical and acute. The\r\n    branchial orifice does not present the peculiar characters\r\n    of _Actinocyclus_. Although all these species differ to some\r\n    extent, they have no characters to distinguish them generically\r\n    from the typical _Doris_, unless anatomical or microscopical\r\n    examination should reveal them, or the characters of that genus\r\n    should be more closely limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRIOPA Johnston, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _T. catalinæ_ Cooper.

Length of largest specimens 3, breadth 0.50 inch.\r\n\r\n    Several found on the beach at Santa Barbara, May 5th, having\r\n    been washed ashore by an unusually heavy sea, occurring at a\r\n    very low stage of the tide. One, also, dredged on seaweed, from\r\n    a depth of 28 fathoms, two miles off shore.\r\n\r\n    This species seems more variable in color than the other\r\n    _nudibranchiata_ of this coast, but I saw no reason for\r\n    considering them of more than one species. Those washed ashore\r\n    being somewhat injured, although still alive, I made no drawing\r\n    of them, and the more perfect one dredged was too small for\r\n    this purpose.\r\n\r\n    In the “Mollusca and Shells,” of the U. S. Exploring Expedition\r\n    under Commodore Wilkes, Dr. Gould mentions a species of\r\n    Dendronotus collected at Puget Sound, but does not name it or\r\n    give any clue to its characters, except that the _branchiæ_\r\n    have white tips, unlike our specimens. It is very probable,\r\n    however, that it belongs to the same species, as so many of the\r\n    Mollusca of this coast have an equally wide range.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ÆOLIS Cuvier, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Æ. barbarensis_ Cooper.

Species 988.\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Animal dark lead-colored, with black\r\n    reticulations, and a wide brown stripe along the median\r\n    line, extending from the mantle to the front of head, about\r\n    one-fourth of the total length.\r\n\r\n    Shell with a pale brown, smooth and shining epidermis,\r\n    extending beyond the margin, translucent when young, becoming\r\n    thickened by an opaque white deposit on the interior when old.\r\n    First whorl or nucleus ornamented with about thirty delicate\r\n    parallel revolving ribs, not concealed by the epidermis, and\r\n    ending abruptly at the commencement of the transverse lines of\r\n    growth in the body whorl.\r\n\r\n    Length 0.46, breadth 0.34, height 0.12 inch.\r\n\r\n    This genus resembles _Limax_ in its shield-like mantle, but in\r\n    the more essential characters of the lingual teeth, appears to\r\n    belong undoubtedly to the _Helicidæ_. It approaches nearest to\r\n    the subfamily _Vitrininæ_, in having the mantle in front of the\r\n    shell, approaching nearest to the _Daudebardia_ of Europe; but\r\n    differs in the form and opacity of the shell, which resembles\r\n    some of the _Succininæ_, especially _Omalonyx_ of South\r\n    America, etc. It differs from these very much in the form of\r\n    the animal, and the shell being wholly external, forming one of\r\n    those connecting links which make it difficult or impossible to\r\n    divide the _Helicidæ_ into distinct groups.\r\n\r\n    _Habitat._ So far this animal has been found only in Santa\r\n    Barbara Island, one of the group within this State. It there\r\n    inhabits but one station, so far as I could discover after\r\n    very careful search. That is the head of a ravine facing the\r\n    south-east and about two hundred and fifty feet above the sea.\r\n    During the wet season there may be a little water springing\r\n    from this place, but for at least five months it is not even\r\n    damp, while the remainder of the island is entirely destitute\r\n    of water. Myriads of _Helix kelletii_ and two other species\r\n    (probably new) inhabit it, but during the dry season retire\r\n    into a torpid æstivation, not disturbed by the fogs and mists\r\n    of summer. The _Binneya_, the rarest of all, and not protected\r\n    from drought by its shell, burrows down to the under surface\r\n    of thick succulent roots, and contracting to about twice the\r\n    size of its shell, covers the rest of its body with a white\r\n    mucous secretion, which appears to be impervious to the\r\n    moisture within, and dries into a tough leathery shell.[5] When\r\n    moistened for a few hours, the animal separates the edge of\r\n    this box from that of its true shell, and becomes active.\r\n\r\n    The figures [Fig. 15] represent three positions of the shell,\r\n    the animal æstivating and also crawling.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n    I found but three alive, and eighteen dead shells.\r\n\r\n    [4] To all those who have seen the splendid works on the\r\n    “Terrestrial Mollusks of the United States,” by the late Dr.\r\n    Amos Binney, so ably continued by his son W. G. Binney, the\r\n    appropriateness of the name will be at once evident.\r\n\r\n    [5] In this it resembles the _Testacellæ_ of Europe, which\r\n    are otherwise very different.\r\n\r\nDr. Trask presented, in the name of Mr. Garrett, the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of New Species of Fishes.\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW GARRETT, OF HONOLULU, S. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JULIS Cuv.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Julis ornatissimus_ Garrett.\r\n\r\n    D. 9-13; A. 2-13; V. 1-5; P. 12; C. 2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 2.\r\n\r\n    The body of this _Julis_ is rich green, which gradually passes\r\n    into light blue on the breast and belly. The scales on the\r\n    green ground are margined with vermillion red, and there is\r\n    a slight tinge of the latter color on the abdominal scales.\r\n    Four alternate oblique light red and blue vittæ pass from the\r\n    middle of the gill-opening, and gradually fade away beneath the\r\n    anterior portion of the abdomen. The head, which is emerald\r\n    green, is ornamented with vermillion red stripes, which have\r\n    their margins shaded off with brilliant blue. The stripes are\r\n    disposed as follows: one traverses the upper line of profile,\r\n    two extend from the upper lip to the eye, one follows the lower\r\n    line of the head, passing up the hinder margin of the gill\r\n    covers; two horizontal ones on the cheek, and, posteriously\r\n    to the eye they assume reticulations. Irides golden yellow,\r\n    with shades of light red; cornea dusky green. The dorsal, anal\r\n    and caudal fins are carmine red, margined with pale blue. The\r\n    former with a basal row of large spots, and an intramarginal\r\n    band, dark green. Two similar bands mark the outer half of\r\n    the anal fin, and spots of the same color may be observed on\r\n    the caudal. The ventrals are pale, straw-yellow, with blue,\r\n    anterior margins. Pectorals have a pale, yellow tinge at their\r\n    base.\r\n\r\n    The greatest depth of the body, as compared to the entire\r\n    length of the fish, is about one to four. The scales are rather\r\n    large. The head constitutes a little less than a fourth of the\r\n    total length. In addition to the usual teeth which characterize\r\n    the genus, we observe a spiniform tooth projecting obliquely\r\n    forward from the posterior portion of the branches of the\r\n    upper jaw. The caudal fin is posteriorly rounded off, and the\r\n    ventrals are long and pointed.\r\n\r\n    Length, 4½ inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—We have observed only a single example of this very\r\n    rare and beautiful fish, which was captured at the island of\r\n    Hawaii in 1856. Its peculiar markings will readily distinguish\r\n    it from any of the numerous species inhabiting our coasts. In\r\n    shape and markings of the head it resembles _Julis pæcila_,\r\n    figured in the Zoology of the Voyage of the “Blossom,” but the\r\n    colors of the body and fins are widely different.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHIRONECTES Cuv.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Chironectes rubro-fuscus_ Garrett.\r\n\r\n    D. 3-13; A. 9; V. 6; P. 11; C. 9.\r\n\r\n    A single example of this species now before me has been\r\n    preserved in spirits several years. It is in fine condition,\r\n    though the colors are much faded. The general shape is\r\n    oblong-oval, and much compressed. The thickness at the base\r\n    of the head enters about five and a half times in the total\r\n    length. The whole surface is covered with crowded minute hispid\r\n    asperities, and very small, remote, cutaneous, tuft-like\r\n    appendages. The head, as viewed in profile, is irregularly\r\n    rounded, the chin forming the anterior end, being slightly\r\n    in advance of the mouth. The eyes are exceedingly small,\r\n    elliptically oval in shape, their greatest diameter being only\r\n    three-twentieths of an inch. Their distance from the margin\r\n    of the upper jaw is five times their own length. The mouth is\r\n    vertical. On the top of the snout, midway between the eyes\r\n    and the end of the upper jaw, is a long setaceous appendage,\r\n    articulated to a tubercle, and tufted at the end. On the\r\n    cranium there are two stout, curved processes, which project\r\n    posteriorly, the hind one the largest, and both enveloped in\r\n    the integuments. The dorsal fin takes its origin at a point\r\n    corresponding to the middle of the total length of the fish,\r\n    caudal exclusive. Its height equals the length of its own base.\r\n    The caudal trunk and fin are slightly oblique to the horizontal\r\n    axis of the body. The anal fin is small and rounded off along\r\n    its outer margin. The rays in all the fins have their ends\r\n    slightly prolonged in little fleshy points. The color, as noted\r\n    from the living fish, is dark red, with irregular, cloud-like\r\n    markings and spots, dusky gray. Everywhere maculated with\r\n    small, irregular, dusky spots, which are the most numerous on\r\n    the belly. A few deep black maculations on the vertical fins\r\n    and scattering ones on the body. The interior of the mouth and\r\n    tongue are mottled with red and white. Irides pale flesh color;\r\n    cornea black. The smooth inner surfaces of the pectoral and\r\n    ventral fins are intensely red.\r\n\r\n    Length, 8½ inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—This fine large species is very rare. As compared with\r\n    the _C. leprosus_ from the same location, it is much larger,\r\n    more compressed, the eyes much smaller and the ground color is\r\n    quite different. In the _leporina_ the eyes are less than twice\r\n    their own diameter distant from the anterior margin of the\r\n    upper jaw. In our fish they are five diameters distant from the\r\n    same point.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHÆTODON L.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Chætodon multicinctus_ Garrett.\r\n\r\n    D. 13-24; A. 3-19; V. 1-5; P. 14; C. 3, 1, 8, 7, 1, 2.\r\n\r\n    Form oval. The head enters about four and a half times in the\r\n    total length. The upper line of profile from the snout to the\r\n    dorsal fin is nearly straight, rising at an angle of 60°.\r\n    The snout is short. The eye is large, circular, its diameter\r\n    one-third of the length of the head, and placed just midway\r\n    between the opercular corner and the end of the snout. The\r\n    preopercular margin exhibits a few small dentations. The scales\r\n    are moderate size.\r\n\r\n    The dorsal and anal fins are posteriorly rounded off. The\r\n    hinder margin of the caudal is truncate. The anterior soft ray\r\n    of the ventrals is slightly prolonged beyond the margin of the\r\n    fin.\r\n\r\n    Color creamy-yellow. The sides are marked with five vertical,\r\n    yellowish-brown, diffuse stripes, the two anterior ones\r\n    terminate on the side of the belly, and the others at the base\r\n    of the anal fin. There is a slight indication of a sixth one\r\n    along the basal half of the soft portion of the dorsal fin.\r\n    Each scale is marked with a faint, yellowish-brown dot. A\r\n    yellow line starts from a point above the base of the ventral,\r\n    follows the line of the belly, and unites with a black one\r\n    which traverses the anal fin. A blue black spot in front of\r\n    the dorsal fin gradually passes into the ocular fascia, the\r\n    latter being brown above and yellow beneath the eye. Irides\r\n    chrome-yellow. Upper lip brown. A vertical black stripe, shaded\r\n    off anteriorly with vermillion, marks the middle of the caudal\r\n    trunk. The dorsal spines and filaments are orange-yellow, the\r\n    inter-radial membrane is colorless. The soft portion of the\r\n    dorsal and anal are ochre-yellow along their middle-third, the\r\n    former with a broad yellow and the latter with a pale greenish\r\n    margin. The two colors on either fin separated by a narrow\r\n    black and white line. The caudal is colorless, with a basal\r\n    vertical luniform bar, its convex margin anterior. The ventrals\r\n    are whitish, and the pectorals colorless.\r\n\r\n    Length, 3½ inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—Two examples of this species were procured in Honolulu\r\n    market.\r\n\r\n\r\n    OPHISURUS Lac.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Ophisurus Californiensis_ Garrett.\r\n\r\n    This _Ophisurus_ is more robust than usual in species of this\r\n    genus. The head is large, swollen beneath, and comprises about\r\n    one-twelfth of the entire length. The depth, taken at the\r\n    origin of the anal fin, enters about twenty-eight times in the\r\n    total length, or twice in the length of the head. The pectorals\r\n    are large, elliptical in shape, their tips reaching posteriorly\r\n    nearly as far as the origin of the dorsal fin. The dorsal and\r\n    anal fins are well developed, the latter passing over a base\r\n    considerably more than half the length of the fish.\r\n\r\n    The color in spirits is brown, paler on the lower half of\r\n    the head, and cinereous along the throat and belly. A dorsal\r\n    row of large, roundish, brownish-black spots extends from\r\n    the occipital region to the end of the tail; the spots being\r\n    intersected by the fin, and the two anterior ones are saddle\r\n    shaped. A second row, disposed alternately to the first,\r\n    occupies the upper half of the flanks. The head is irregularly\r\n    maculated, the spots becoming paler beneath. The fins are\r\n    light, brownish-grey; the dorsal and anal with a narrow darker\r\n    margin, which is articulated with dark brown.\r\n\r\n    Length, 19½ inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Lower California.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—The specimen described above, was captured at\r\n    Margarita Bay, by Mr. White, of the whaler Rambler, to whom I\r\n    am indebted for a valuable collection of objects of natural\r\n    history.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres remarked that he had recently received from Tomales Bay\r\nspecimens of an ichthyic type, new to this coast, and probably new to\r\nscience. The species is closely allied to _Scomberesox_, though the\r\njaws are but moderately elongated. It is judged worthy of record, even\r\nprevious to any description, since no fish of that group has hitherto\r\nbeen found in the waters of California. The specimens exhibited to the\r\nAcademy were from five to eight inches in length. He also gave notice\r\nof the acquisition of a specimen of Thrasher, taken in the Bay of San\r\nFrancisco. The species is a very close representative of the Atlantic\r\nform _Alopias vulpes_, differing, however, in the proportions of the\r\ndorsal and anal fins, and in the position of the branchial apertures;\r\nthe tail constitutes decidedly more than half of the entire length. The\r\nspecimen is about five feet in length.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres presented a specimen of Barnacles, found floating at sea in\r\nlat. 33° 8´ N., lon. 129° 35´ W., by Capt. Geo. Goodrum of San Francisco.\r\nThey were of the _Anatifa_ type, but exhibited the remarkable feature\r\nof being attached, not to some extraneous substance, as a fragment of\r\nwreck, for instance, but to a spherical, fleshy receptacle, apparently a\r\nportion of their own system. This receptacle was of a light, yellowish\r\ncolor, about the size of a small orange, which it somewhat resembled in\r\naspect. To it were attached, by the usual flexible pedicles, about a\r\ndozen Barnacles, allied to _Anatifa_, as above indicated, but differing\r\nfrom it in the breadth of the dorsal plate, and in the projection of a\r\nstrong keel at the base of both dorsal and lateral plates. When this\r\nspecimen was procured, myriads like it covered the sea for miles in the\r\ntrack of the vessel. Barnacles aggregated in this manner of growth do not\r\nappear to have been hitherto reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, October 5th, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven members present.\r\n\r\nA donation to the cabinet of several species of fishes from the Sandwich\r\nIslands was received from Mr. Andrew Garrett.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Library:\r\n\r\nFragmenta Phytographiæ Australiæ, by Ferdinand Mueller, Vol. III, from\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander stated that he had recently collected two grasses believed\r\nnot to have been before found on this coast, though common in the\r\nAtlantic States, viz.: _Paspalum distichum_ (L.) along the shores of\r\nClear Lake, covering large patches of ground, and _Leersia oryzoides_\r\n(Swartz), along Cache Creek, of much larger size than he had met with in\r\nthe East. He believed _Gastridium australe_, which covers almost every\r\ndry hill in the interior, to be indigenous.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr made some remarks on the date of introduction of some foreign\r\nplants, now becoming very common in this vicinity, which he intends to\r\nmake the subject of a future article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.\r\n\r\nMIRABILIS CALIFORNICA.

He remarked that this rare\r\nanimal lived about the limits of perpetual snow, and was so rarely seen\r\nthat residents for several years near its resorts had never seen it.\r\nHe found it quite common in a very limited district, though difficult\r\nto obtain, from its extreme shyness. Though before found in the Rocky\r\nMountains near South Pass, and Salt Lake, where it is called “Coney,”\r\nthis was the first record of its occurrence so far to the west and south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, November 2d, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nMr. W.

COOPER, M.D.\r\n\r\n    The fishes described in the following articles were collected\r\n    by me for the State Geological Survey, along the Southern Coast\r\n    of this State and among the adjoining islands. While it is\r\n    possible that some of them may have been described in works not\r\n    now accessible to us, the probabilities are entirely in favor\r\n    of their being new, as we have very recent lists of all the\r\n    species described as inhabitants of this Coast since the report\r\n    on fishes collected by the Pacific Rail Road Surveys.\r\n\r\n    For much information and assistance in their determination, I\r\n    am indebted to Dr. W. O. Ayres, and also to Dr. George Hewston,\r\n    for the use of books not contained in any public library in the\r\n    city.\r\n\r\n    The outline illustrations, reduced from accurate measurements,\r\n    were electrotyped and presented by our industrious\r\n    collaborator, Dr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\n    The colors described are in all cases those of the living fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEKAYA, n. g.[6]\r\n\r\n    _Generic characters._—General shape elongated and fusiform,\r\n    head small and short, premaxillaries slightly protractile, eye\r\n    large, situated above the level of mouth, profile moderately\r\n    sloping, snout broad and obtuse.\r\n\r\n    Preoperculum serrated behind, operculum with one obtuse spine;\r\n    branchiostegal rays five on each side. Opercular openings\r\n    connected below.\r\n\r\n    Front rows of teeth on premaxillaries small, conical, acute,\r\n    and slightly recurved; those of upper jaw largest, their size\r\n    decreasing from the middle towards each angle, where there are\r\n    one or two large canines; those below hidden by the upper jaw.\r\n    Behind this row in both jaws, a band of velvet teeth in about\r\n    six irregular rows near the symphysis, but ending entirely\r\n    near the middle of each ramus. Tongue and vomer toothless.\r\n    Pharyngeal bones and branchial arches densely crowded with\r\n    large velvet teeth.\r\n\r\n    Infraorbital bone short, curving up under posterior border of\r\n    orbit, and not connected with the operculum.\r\n\r\n    Nostrils double, anterior opening smaller, lips rather thick\r\n    and fleshy.\r\n\r\n    Scales small, numerous, oblong, subquadrangular, finely\r\n    pectinated, covering the whole body and head as far as front of\r\n    orbit, but leaving a bare space around the eye.\r\n\r\n    Fins scaleless, as well as caudal rays. Dorsal and anal fins\r\n    very long at base; spinous rays few. Lateral line normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DEKAYA ANOMALA, Cooper, n. sp., State coll. No. 618. [FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Length of head contained five times in\r\n    total length. Distance from end of snout to orbit one-third\r\n    the length of head, and greater than width of orbit. Height\r\n    of head just behind orbit about equal to distance from tip of\r\n    snout to edge of preoperculum; breadth one-third to one-half of\r\n    its length. Skin on occiput elevated from the bone by a thick\r\n    layer of fat, not by any bony expansions.\r\n\r\n    Height of pectoral fin less than length of head; its width\r\n    about one-third of its height, middle rays longest.\r\n\r\n    Dorsal arising above pectoral joint, its length one-third that\r\n    of the fish; first spine one-ninth the length of the fin;\r\n    the other spines lengthening to the commencement of the soft\r\n    portion, of which the longest ray is one-fifth the length of\r\n    the fin, and the last ray one-fifteenth; the entire fin having\r\n    a gradually arching outline.\r\n\r\n    Caudal moderately broad, deeply forked, and acutely pointed;\r\n    the upper lobe slightly the largest.\r\n\r\n    Anal similar in form to dorsal, arising opposite its\r\n    eighth soft ray and prolonged a little farther back. It is\r\n    three-fifths as long as dorsal, its height about one-fourth its\r\n    length, the first (spinous) ray and the last each half as long\r\n    as the longest.\r\n\r\n    Ventrals four-fifths the height of pectorals, arising\r\n    immediately behind them; their width one-third of their length.\r\n\r\n    D. VII, 23-2, C 3-1-6-6-1-3, A I-2-21-2, P 6-1-11, V, I-1-1-3.\r\n    Scales 175, 13/32-10/10.\r\n\r\n    _Colors._—Pale silvery brown, white below; an obscure row of\r\n    brown spots and mottlings on sides; fins and tail olive near\r\n    base; iris dark brown and gilt.\r\n\r\n    _Remarks._—This fish seems to be a very aberrant form of the\r\n    Percoid family, having many of the characters of other orders.\r\n    Its general form and dentition are those of some Sciaenoids,\r\n    while its entire dorsal, opercular armature and only five\r\n    branchiostegals separate it both from them and the Percoids.\r\n    The very long anal is another character found in few if any\r\n    members of these families. I can find nothing in the pharyngeal\r\n    bones to indicate its affinities, these being closely like\r\n    those of both the above families as shown in _Seriphus politus_\r\n    and _Paralabrax clathratus_, which on comparison have them\r\n    almost exactly similar.\r\n\r\n    The genus _Heterognathodon_, of Bleeker, has several of the\r\n    most peculiar characters of this one; but not having a full\r\n    description of it, I cannot compare them. There are generic\r\n    differences at least, and the habitat is widely different,\r\n    being the East Indies. Richardson places it with other aberrant\r\n    genera in the family _Theraponidae_—(_Datninae_, of Swainson,)\r\n    which is probably a mixture of several.\r\n\r\n    The outline figure represents the fish one-third the natural\r\n    size; 22 inches.\r\n\r\n    This fish is caught rather plentifully in autumn at Catalina\r\n    Island, where I obtained the one here described, in October,\r\n    1861. During my late visit there, in June and July, none would\r\n    bite, and I have not yet obtained any duplicates. It is called\r\n    by the very vague name of “White-fish.”\r\n\r\n    The figure being made from a skin may be a little inaccurate in\r\n    proportions; but I hope to be able to present a better one in\r\n    the Report of the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n    This white-fish is not remarkable for excellence as food.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AYRESIA, n. g.[7]\r\n\r\n    _Generic characters._—Form elongated, suboval; the outline\r\n    more curved above than below. Scales large, finely pectinated,\r\n    completely covering the body and head, except in front of\r\n    orbit; smaller on head, and becoming very small where they\r\n    extend over parts of the fins and tail.\r\n\r\n    Teeth numerous, acute, entire, the anterior row largest; those\r\n    below larger than above, and flattened posteriorly. A few\r\n    smaller ones crowded behind these near symphysis. Pharyngeals\r\n    villiform.\r\n\r\n    Premaxillars protractile, the upper arched, twice as high as\r\n    wide, the lower shutting within it.\r\n\r\n    Preoperculum entire, a very small obtuse spine at angle of\r\n    operculum.\r\n\r\n    Pectorals rather long and pointed. Caudal deeply forked, the\r\n    lobes acute. Dorsal long, anal moderate.\r\n\r\n    Differs from _Pomacentrus_ (Lacepede) chiefly in a more arched\r\n    dorsal outline, armed operculum and unarmed preoperculum,\r\n    pointed fins and tail, proportions of fins.\r\n\r\n    The dorsal outline appears to become much more convex with age,\r\n    chiefly from deposit of fat on the occiput, as is the case\r\n    in some Labroids, as for instance, _L. pulcher_ (Ayres) and\r\n    _Julis modestus_ (Girard), the latter also growing higher in\r\n    proportion to its length throughout. The dotted line represents\r\n    the dorsal outline of a specimen one-fourth larger than that\r\n    figured, but otherwise closely like it.\r\n\r\n\r\n    AYRESIA PUNCTIPINNIS, Cooper, n. sp., State coll. No. 596.\r\n    [FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Head forming less than a fourth of total\r\n    length (0.18), eyes less than one-third the length of head, and\r\n    less than its own diameter from end of snout, height of head\r\n    behind orbit about equal to its length. Greatest thickness of\r\n    body about one-eighth of total length.\r\n\r\n    Height of pectoral equal to one-fourth the distance from snout\r\n    to fork of tail (0.21). Dorsal commencing above pectoral joint,\r\n    its spinous portion nearly one-third of its total length, and\r\n    one-sixth of its height, the first spine shortest. Soft rays\r\n    becoming three times as high, forming an obtuse point behind;\r\n    the last ray about as long as the spines (the first dorsal\r\n    spine should be one-fourth longer than in the figure). Caudal\r\n    peduncle slightly contracted, shorter than caudal rays. Fork of\r\n    tail extending half-way to its base, the upper lobe longest,\r\n    being one-fifth of the total length. Anal commencing beneath\r\n    the tenth dorsal spine, and ending a little anterior to end\r\n    of soft dorsal, its base less than one-sixth of total length\r\n    (0.17).\r\n\r\n    Br.

Beneath whitish in young, all the hues\r\n    darker in the old fish. Some are also spotted on the body\r\n    posteriorly.\r\n\r\n    In the winter of 1861-2, I caught several in San Diego Bay,\r\n    which bit freely at the usual baits. I did not hear any\r\n    peculiar name applied, but they are confounded with “Perch,”\r\n    which they little resemble. Also found at San Pedro.\r\n\r\n    A larger one, taken in a net at Santa Barbara Island, in May,\r\n    1863, has the different characters supposed to indicate an\r\n    older fish, and is much fatter; its head is also shorter in\r\n    proportion, but as I find a similar difference in specimens of\r\n    _Girella nigricans_ Ayres, as well as in the Labroids before\r\n    mentioned, I must consider these as sexual differences, or in\r\n    part depending on age and condition. They do not differ more\r\n    than some specimens of _Embiotoca jacksoni_ from each other,\r\n    and agree closely in the number of spines and rays of their\r\n    fins.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ORCYNUS, Cuvier, 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ORCYNUS PACIFICUS, Cooper, n. sp., State collection, species\r\n    1033. [FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—General profile elliptical, height of\r\n    body nearly one-quarter its length, breadth about half the\r\n    height.\r\n\r\n    Head laterally compressed, somewhat flattened on top, the nose\r\n    horizontally rounded, but laterally pointed. Base of tail\r\n    vertically compressed, one-third broader than it is high. Head\r\n    half the length of body, its height behind orbit equal to half\r\n    its length. Diameter of orbit one-sixth the length of head, its\r\n    form obliquely oval. Jaws equal, gape of mouth one-third the\r\n    length of head.\r\n\r\n    Pectoral fin, arising at middle of vertical of side, nearly\r\n    half the total length, its width at base one-eighth of its\r\n    length, but suddenly narrowing to one-fifteenth, which width it\r\n    retains nearly to the end, its outer third curving gradually\r\n    downward, and becoming pointed. First dorsal commencing\r\n    directly above pectoral, its length nearly one-fourth of total\r\n    length, and its height in front two-fifths of its length.\r\n    Spines rapidly decreasing in length from the first to the\r\n    eighth, the next six about equal, and a third of the first, the\r\n    last one very short. Second dorsal immediately behind the first\r\n    and a little higher, triangular, nearly one-third higher than\r\n    long, its base lengthened posteriorly, and one-third the length\r\n    of the first dorsal. Finlets eight above and eight below,\r\n    acutely triangular, those near the middle a little larger.\r\n\r\n    Caudal large, its lobes equal, their length three times their\r\n    width, and one-third that of the pectoral; posterior outline\r\n    arcuately concave, with slightly widened lobes near the middle.\r\n\r\n    Anal opposite end of second dorsal, similar to it in form, but\r\n    smaller, and about twice as high as long, its position half way\r\n    between the ventrals and caudal. Its first spine is only about\r\n    one-third as long as the second, which is two-thirds the height\r\n    of fin; both concealed by the skin.\r\n\r\n    Ventrals arising opposite second dorsal spine, about twice as\r\n    high as wide, their inner margin with a small pointed lobe.\r\n\r\n    Cartilaginous ridge on side of caudal peduncle moderate,\r\n    highest anteriorly, its length half that of caudal lobe. Two\r\n    slight oblique ridges behind the median ridge.\r\n\r\n    Lateral line imperceptible in front of fourth dorsal spine,\r\n    parallel with outline of back. No scales on head. Thoracic\r\n    corselet of very large consolidated scales above pectoral,\r\n    bordered by six rows of large distinct scales, which grow\r\n    smaller from before backwards. Scales underneath ventrals and\r\n    around other fins, similarly consolidated, and depressed under\r\n    pectoral and ventral. Rest of scales nearly uniform in size.\r\n\r\n    Teeth numerous, very small, in one row, the palatine dense and\r\n    velvety. Rays of second dorsal and anal fins nearly hidden by\r\n    adipose skin.\r\n\r\n    Br. VI-VI D.XIV-12-|-8, P 32, V, I-8 A.II-8,-|-8\r\n    C.11-1-6-6-1-12.\r\n\r\n    _Colors._—Above blackish, sides steel-blue, below silvery\r\n    white, fins smoky, iris brown, finlets yellow edged with blue.\r\n\r\n    The largest I saw measured thirty-three inches to fork of tail,\r\n    and weighed twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\n    Numerous in summer among the islands off the southern coast\r\n    of this State, and is said to occur as far north as San Luis\r\n    Obispo. It affords excellent sport, being caught by trolling\r\n    while sailing very rapidly, biting voraciously at a white rag.\r\n    It is in my opinion the best fish for the table that is caught\r\n    on this coast, but it is said to be sometimes poisonous.\r\n\r\n    It belongs to the typical _Orcynus_ of Cuvier, distinguished\r\n    from _Thynnus_, by the very long pectoral, eight pairs of\r\n    finlets, small corselet, etc. The type of _Orcynus_ (Scomber\r\n    alatunga, Linn., or O. alalonga, Duhamel), is called “Ala\r\n    longa” (Long-wing) in the Mediterranean and resembles this\r\n    species closely, but is figured as less high and with a smaller\r\n    pectoral fin.\r\n\r\n    This species is one of several confounded by sailors under\r\n    the Spanish names of Albicore and Bonito. The English name\r\n    Tunny is applied to an allied species on the coast of Europe,\r\n    the _Thynnus vulgaris_, Cuv., and to its near representative\r\n    the _T. secundi-dorsalis_, Storer, of the eastern American\r\n    coast. These, however, are evidently of a different genus, and\r\n    as _Thynnus_ is preoccupied in insects, the name _Orcynus_,\r\n    applied by Gill to the same type, may perhaps be retained,\r\n    although _founded on a mistake_. _O. coretta_, Cuv. and Val.,\r\n    probably represents our species in the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n    [6] Named in memory of the distinguished author of the\r\n    Zoological portions of the “Natural History of New York,”\r\n    Dr. James E.

S. Taylor, now of Santa Barbara,\r\ncomplaining that his name had been omitted from the list of corresponding\r\nmembers, though he was elected several years since. It was resolved that\r\nhis name be restored, having been omitted on account of his new address\r\nbeing unknown to the Secretary.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander read the following article:\r\n\r\n\r\nEnumeration of Shrubs and Trees growing in the vicinity of the mouth of\r\nSan Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY N. BOLANDER.\r\n\r\n    The territory in question is divided naturally into three parts:\r\n\r\n    1. The northern part of the peninsula of San Francisco, with an\r\n    undulating and hilly surface, consists of drifting sand, with a\r\n    small per centage of humus mingled with it.\r\n\r\n    2. The Oakland Hills, running N. 54° W. mag., from the Bay of\r\n    San Pablo to San Leandro, a distance of twenty-three miles,\r\n    with the adjacent slopes and valleys. Heavy clayey soil\r\n    predominates; but where shrubs and trees grow it is mostly a\r\n    loose, light, and slightly sandy soil.\r\n\r\n    3. That part of Marin County between San Rafael, the head of\r\n    Tomales Bay and Bolinas Bay, forming a triangle, with a hilly\r\n    surface, the ridges running N. 54° W. mag. Soil a heavy clay,\r\n    in the valleys and on bare hills; or a light, slightly sandy\r\n    loam among shrubs and trees.\r\n\r\n    In all parts a metamorphic sand-stone underlies the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Berberis (Mahonia) Aquifolium_ Pursh.\r\n\r\n    A low evergreen shrub, three to four feet high, not gregarious;\r\n    in clay soil on the hill sides; rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Dendromecon rigidum_ Benth.\r\n\r\n    A shrub with slender upright branchlets, four to six feet high,\r\n    rare; on white sand-stone, Oakland hills, third range eastward,\r\n    not gregarious.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Rhus diversiloba_ Torr. and Gray. POISON OAK.\r\n\r\n    Everywhere, deciduous, exceedingly variable, three to eight\r\n    feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Negundo Aceroides_ Mœnch.

BEHR, M. D.\r\n\r\n    The following species of butterflies were mostly collected by\r\n    the members of the State Geological Survey, among the higher\r\n    regions of the Sierra Nevada; but some of them are from other\r\n    portions of California.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DANAIS, Latr.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _Danais Archippus_, Cramer.\r\n\r\n    This species was found everywhere, both on the plains and at\r\n    the highest elevations, up to the limits of Lepidopterous life,\r\n    10,500 feet above the level of the sea. The specimens caught in\r\n    the Sierra were in a poor condition, and differed remarkably\r\n    in habits from those found near San Francisco Bay. Like most\r\n    Danaids, ours is rather a lazy and heavy butterfly, gifted\r\n    it is true with great power of flight, which is shown not by\r\n    swiftness, but by perseverance. It is however quite easily\r\n    caught. But according to the statement of Mr. Hoffman, of the\r\n    Geological Survey, this same Danais was on the mountain summits\r\n    so restless and active that although very common, only two\r\n    specimens could be obtained.\r\n\r\n    We consider these specimens as something like “enfans perdus,”\r\n    of an otherwise respectable family, led away by an innate\r\n    desire to strive against the current. Thus they struggle\r\n    against the mountain breeze until finally they reach the bleak\r\n    heights of the Sierra, where such tropical forms contrast\r\n    strikingly with the alpine flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ARGYNNIS, Fabr.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _Argynnis montivaga_, Behr, n. sp. [Argynnis, No. 4. Proc.\r\n    Cal. Acad. II, 1862, p. 174.]\r\n\r\n    If, as I strongly suspect, this species is still undescribed, I\r\n    propose for it the above name. It is not found near this bay,\r\n    but seems to be widely spread through the Sierra from whence\r\n    I have specimens collected at different localities. Those\r\n    obtained by the Geological Survey are from an elevation of\r\n    10,500 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _Argynnis rupestris_, Behr, n. sp. [No. 6 of former article.]\r\n\r\n    To the diagnosis formerly given I add the following character:\r\n\r\n    Margo anterior alarum anteriorum subtus quam disco pallidior.\r\n\r\n    The saturated coloration of the radical half of the hind wings,\r\n    is not always equal in its extent beyond the middle macular\r\n    fascia, so that the diagnosis of No. 9 is in some respects\r\n    near enough to cause confusion, if it were not that in No.\r\n    9 the anterior margin of the forewings is always decidedly\r\n    darker than the disk, furnishing a good diagnostic character.\r\n    In general aspect they differ enough to be recognized at the\r\n    first glance, but it is very difficult to describe the other\r\n    differences.\r\n\r\n    The name I propose for No. 6, is derived from its inhabiting\r\n    the steep rocky declivities characterizing the lower part of\r\n    the Sierra. The specimens were collected by Prof. Brewer at a\r\n    moderate elevation above the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. _Argynnis monticola_, Behr, n. sp. [No. 8 of the former\r\n    article.]\r\n\r\n    This species was found in Yosemite Valley and some other\r\n    localities, being apparently not rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. _Argynnis Antithore_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    One specimen only from Yosemite Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MELITÆA, Fabr.\r\n\r\n    It will be necessary to give a monograph of this genus before\r\n    we go on with the enumeration of the mountain species.\r\n\r\n    We have in California _eleven_ well-marked species, a number\r\n    far exceeding those of the Atlantic Slope, and about equal\r\n    to those of the whole of Europe. In the “Synopsis of North\r\n    American Lepidoptera,” written for the Smithsonian Institution\r\n    by John G. Morris, I find only two Californian species\r\n    mentioned and described, viz.: _M. Editha_ and _M. Palla_, the\r\n    “_M. Zerene_” of the same work being without doubt an Argynnis.\r\n    In a catalogue published by the same author in 1860, I find\r\n    besides those just mentioned another, viz; _M. Chalcedon_.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Boisduval names several Melitæa in his letters to me, but\r\n    gives no diagnosis.\r\n\r\n    Our Californian Melitæa belong to four types.\r\n\r\n    TYPE I. The first is that of _M. Tharos_, represented by four\r\n    distinct species in California. This type is peculiar to the\r\n    American Continent, occurring also in the Atlantic States, and\r\n    in the tropics.\r\n\r\n    TYPE II. That of _M. Athalia_, represented by _M. Palla_, and\r\n    several others. It is also abundantly represented in Europe,\r\n    but seems to be wanting in the Atlantic States.\r\n\r\n    TYPE III. That of _M. Phaeton_, corresponding exactly to the\r\n    European, _M. Maturna_, _M. Artemis_, etc., is represented in\r\n    California by _M. Editha_, _M. Chalcedon_, and others.\r\n\r\n    TYPE IV. That of _M. Leanira_ is numerous in the tropics of\r\n    America but seems to be wanting everywhere else except in\r\n    California.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MELITÆA, Type I.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _M. montana_, Behr. Syn? _M. Pyrrha_, Doubleday.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra aurantiacae, nigro clathratae, inter secundam et\r\n    tertiam fasciam nigram magis dilutae; posticae inter primam et\r\n    secundam fasciam, serie punctorum nigrorum signatae, fascia\r\n    prima ab angulo anteriori interrupta, et costam versus quintam\r\n    tantum denuo cursum ad angulum posteriorem recipiente.\r\n\r\n    Alae anticae subtus aurantiacae, disco fere concolori,\r\n    nec maculis pallidiouibus nec fasciis obscurioribus bene\r\n    distinctis, apicem versus flavidae, maculls fasciisque fuscis,\r\n    et prope angulum posteriorem macula nigra signatae. Alae\r\n    posticae flavidae signaturis plus minus obscurioribus, in\r\n    morem Argynnidum undulatis, serie punctorum brunneorum inter\r\n    primam et secundam fasciam ut supra pertranseunte. Insuper\r\n    inter costam quintam et sextam exstat lunula submarginalis\r\n    pallidior, interdum candida pruinaque argentea induta, quam\r\n    umbra amplectitur obscurior. Altera umbra a margine anteriori\r\n    prope apicem extenditur.\r\n\r\n    This species is very variable as to the markings of the\r\n    underside of the hind wings. Two specimens, which I received\r\n    through the kindness of Mr. Lorquin, have scarcely any markings\r\n    there. These were collected in the neighborhood of Los\r\n    Angeles. The others, received from the gentlemen of the survey,\r\n    were mostly collected at the headwaters of Tuolumne River, but\r\n    some from Yosemite Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _M. collina_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae omnes supra fulvae, nigro clathratae, posticae inter\r\n    fasciam primam et secundam serie punctorum nigrorum instructae.\r\n\r\n    Alae anticae subtus fulvae apicem versus gilvescentes, ubique\r\n    signaturis fuscis, marginemque versus aliquot maculis nigris\r\n    obsitae.\r\n\r\n    Alae posticae subtus gilvae, hinc pruina argentea indutae,\r\n    signaturis fuscis in morem Argynnidum undulatis, binis semper\r\n    per umbram quandam connexis, hinc et illinc confluentibus,\r\n    serie punctorum nigrorum halone amplexorum ut supra inter\r\n    fasciam primam et secundam pertranseunte. Lunula submarginalis\r\n    inter costam quintam et sextam major quam reliquae lunulae\r\n    submarginales, et umbra brunnea amplexa.\r\n\r\n    This species is not rare in the vicinity of San Francisco, and\r\n    the hills of Contra Costa, especially on the grassy valleys,\r\n    along creeks, and on hillsides with a varied vegetation of\r\n    herbaceous plants. There must be many generations of these\r\n    annually, for the perfect insect is found from spring to autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _M. campestris_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra nigrae fasciis macularibus ochraceis et aurantiacis\r\n    alternantibus. Series punctorum nigrorum in alis posticis in\r\n    fascia aurantiaca submarginali.\r\n\r\n    Alae anticae subtus aurantiacae apicem versus luteae. Macula\r\n    disci et fascia intermedia infracta luteae, haec intus nigro\r\n    marginata. Alae posticae subtus luteae, linea transversa\r\n    undulata divisae; A radice usque ad lineam transversam brunneo\r\n    signatae et prope mediam lineam transversam umbra obscura\r\n    indutae; quae umbra extenditur usque ad seriem punctorum.\r\n    Lunula inter quintam costam et sextam candida, aucta et umbra\r\n    amplexa.\r\n\r\n    This species is very common in different localities, especially\r\n    on marshy places, where Hemizonia abounds. Seems to be peculiar\r\n    to the lower regions, and produces several annual generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. _M. pratensis_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra nigrae fasciis macularibus fulvis instructae.\r\n    Maculae fasciae submarginalis alarum posticarum singulae\r\n    singula puncta nigra gerentes.\r\n\r\n    Alae anticae subtus ochraceae maculis pallidioribus hinc et\r\n    illinc signatae. Marginem versus posticam extant aliquot\r\n    maculae nigrae. Alae posticae subtus hepaticae lineis\r\n    undulatis, maculis, umbris serieque punctorum cunctis aeque\r\n    brunneis instructae. Lunula submarginalis vix pallidior et\r\n    umbra amplectente tantum e reliqua ala discerni potest.\r\n\r\n    This species is found on grassy hillsides and is common enough\r\n    in some localities near San Francisco. Several generations are\r\n    found from spring to the beginning of the rainy season.\r\n\r\n    Before I had a sufficient series of these nearly allied species\r\n    in my possession, I considered them local varieties of one\r\n    single species. Afterwards I had an idea that two of them,\r\n    _M. collina_ and _pratensis_ might be seasonal varieties or\r\n    alternating generations, like for instance _Arachnia Prorsa_,\r\n    whose vernal generation _A. Levana_ was for a long time\r\n    considered another species. But according to my observations\r\n    continued through several years, these species are not confined\r\n    to certain seasons, but are to be found throughout the dry\r\n    season. If they were alternating generations of the same insect\r\n    the different forms would be found only at certain seasons; but\r\n    such is not the case.\r\n\r\n    _M. montana_ is very variable but never approaches to the\r\n    characters of the other three species. The rest are as constant\r\n    as a species can be, and in a long series of duplicates\r\n    from different localities I do not find anything like an\r\n    intermediate form.\r\n\r\n    The four species of this type agree in the following points:\r\n\r\n    1. A row of dots between the first and second transverse lines\r\n    of the hindwings, in the space that represents in these species\r\n    the submarginal fascia. This row is clearly visible on both\r\n    sides.\r\n\r\n    2. The marginal lunula between the fifth and sixth vein is\r\n    perceptibly augmented on both sides, and on the other side is\r\n    frequently of lighter color and always surrounded by a deeper\r\n    shade.\r\n\r\n    The most positive characters distinguishing the species is\r\n    found on the disc of the underside of forewings.\r\n\r\n    1. _M. montana_, has the disc uniform fulvous the markings of\r\n    the upper-side shining through the coloration of the disc.\r\n\r\n    2. _M. collina_, has the disc orange color; markings very\r\n    perceptible and towards the exterior margin bordered by a\r\n    series of black spots.\r\n\r\n    3. _M. campestris_, has the disc with a yellow spot between the\r\n    first and second primary costa, and is bordered towards the\r\n    exterior margin by an angular row of yellow spots, which are\r\n    themselves bordered at the inner side by deep black.\r\n\r\n    4. _M. pratensis_, has the disc ochre yellow with irregularly\r\n    diluted spots and some black marks near the _posterior_ margin.\r\n\r\n    There are plenty of other points of difference, as may be\r\n    seen by comparing the diagnoses. But for recognition of any\r\n    of the species it is sufficient to examine the disc. The\r\n    other differences are difficult to describe, as all those who\r\n    know by their own experience the difficulties of analyzing\r\n    the complicated markings of the underside of the hindwings\r\n    in this group will testify. As to the larval state of these\r\n    insects nothing is known, and this want of facts regarding\r\n    their metamorphosis, is the more to be lamented as the natural\r\n    affinities of this type are by no means very clear or simple.\r\n    It seems to constitute a kind of intermediate group between\r\n    the true _Melitæae_ and the Arctic type of _Argynnides_. The\r\n    eyes are more prominent than in the typical species of Melitæa,\r\n    and I find a similar conformation of the head in _M. Tharos_\r\n    from the Atlantic States. At the same time the underside of\r\n    the hindwings of all these species does not represent the\r\n    well-defined alternate bands of the typical _Melitæae_, but\r\n    the intricate undulations and undefined lights and shadows\r\n    of the underside of the Arctic type of _Argynnis_. In fact\r\n    _M. montana_ approaches in this respect very closely to _A.\r\n    Aphirape_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TYPE II.\r\n\r\n    This type corresponds to the European type of _M. Athalia_,\r\n    and even in the differential characters of the four species\r\n    known to me there is a striking parallelism to those of\r\n    four European species, so that each of them looks as if it\r\n    was the transposition of a foreign species separated by a\r\n    peculiarly Californian character, afterwards to be pointed out,\r\n    from its European congener, and separated amongst themselves\r\n    by the very same characters that separate the four European\r\n    parallel species from each other. Their analogies are as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    _California._    _Europe._\r\n\r\n    M. PALLA,        M. DICTYNNA,\r\n    M. WHITNEYI,     M. ATHALIA,\r\n    M. GABBII,       M. PARTHENIE,\r\n    M. HOFFMANNI,    M. ASTERIA.\r\n\r\n    The Californians differ from their European analogues in the\r\n    orange color that fills the space between the margin and the\r\n    marginal line on the underside. In the European species this\r\n    space always has the same pale tint that forms the ground color.\r\n\r\n    Then the two waving lines that inclose the submarginal band on\r\n    the underside of the hind wings, are not entirely filled by the\r\n    orange or fulvous spots as in the European, but have an empty\r\n    space between the first and second, and the second and third\r\n    veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _Melitæa Palla_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    Alae maris supra fulvae nigro clathratae, feminae nigrae\r\n    nonnullis fasciis macularibus gilvis instructae.\r\n\r\n    Alae posticae subtus gilvae lineis nigris et maculis\r\n    aurantiacis ordinariis instructae, necnon serie lunularum\r\n    fasciae submarginalis fulvarum a vena tertia inchoantium usque\r\n    ad ultimam decurrentium. _Quaeque lunula continet ocellum._\r\n\r\n    I repeat the diagnosis for the purpose of adding a character\r\n    that has been hitherto overlooked but is essential for\r\n    separating this species from the following. It is the\r\n    eye-spot contained in each of the orange-colored spots of the\r\n    submarginal band. It is true that these spots are not in every\r\n    specimen equally visible, and often require the help of the\r\n    glass to make them visible, but still they are never wanting as\r\n    in the following species.\r\n\r\n    _M. Palla_ is the only one of this type found in the vicinity\r\n    of San Francisco, where it is rather common. Nevertheless I\r\n    have not yet succeeded in finding the caterpillar, but have\r\n    heard from our celebrated entomologist, Mr. Lorquin, that he\r\n    has raised this butterfly from a caterpillar found on a species\r\n    of _Plantago_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _Melitæa Whitneyi_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae maris supra rubricantes nigro clathratae feminae, fere\r\n    eædem, colore tantum dilutiori hinc et illinc paululum\r\n    alternantes.\r\n\r\n    Alae posticae subtus iis _M. Pallae_ similes sed _lunulae\r\n    fasciae submarginalis ocellis omnino destitutae_.\r\n\r\n    At the first look the difference between this species and _M.\r\n    Palla_ is striking enough, for the coloration of the upperside\r\n    is quite different and the reticulate black marking runs in\r\n    much thinner lines and is more regular than in _M. Palla_,\r\n    where towards the margin the black markings unite more or less\r\n    and cover the ground color. The striking alteration in the\r\n    colors of the upper side in the series of _M. Palla_ does not\r\n    exist here and the female is sometimes quite like the male.\r\n    Sometimes the ground color alternates transversely with a\r\n    slightly diluted tint, and for the female this character would\r\n    be sufficient. But both sexes differ in the constant absence of\r\n    the eye-spots of the submarginal band.\r\n\r\n    I received this species from the headwaters of the Tuolumne\r\n    River where it was collected during the stay of the State\r\n    Geological Survey in the elevated and uninhabited regions. I\r\n    take this opportunity of showing my respect for Prof. Whitney\r\n    and the other members of that learned party, to all of whom I\r\n    am under obligations for the kindness with which, under all\r\n    kinds of hardships, they collected materials for a Fauna of our\r\n    Californian Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _M. Gabbii_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae maris supra ut in _M. Palla_, feminae fasciis transversis\r\n    alternantibus luteis et fulvis totae nigro clathratae.\r\n\r\n    Alae inferiores ut in _M. Palla_, sed maculae radicales\r\n    candidae pruinaque argentea renitentes ita ut fascia intermedia\r\n    lunulaeque marginales. Fasciae, maculae, et margo aurantiacae\r\n    ordinariae. Fasciae submarginalis spatium, quae non occupatur\r\n    lunulis aurantiacis, sulphureum.\r\n\r\n    I received this species from the mountains near Los Angeles\r\n    and have seen a series of specimens constantly showing the\r\n    same characters. This description I made from a pair kindly\r\n    communicated to me by Mr. Lorquin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. _M.

Palla_, sed fascia\r\n    submarginalis inter lineas undulatas nigras, non lunulis sed\r\n    punctis omnino rotundis constituta.\r\n\r\n    This species is less rare than the two preceding. Nevertheless\r\n    it has not yet been found near San Francisco and seems peculiar\r\n    to the higher regions of California.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MELITÆA, Type III.\r\n\r\n    Of this type, we know already as many Californian as European\r\n    species, but except _M. Phaeton_, I do not know any Eastern\r\n    representative of this type. The most robust and gaily\r\n    colored species belong to this type and it is one of the most\r\n    predominant of the diurnal types in California, not only from\r\n    the number of its species but also of its individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _Melitæa Chalcedon_, Doubleday.\r\n\r\n    This showy species is very common around the Bay of San\r\n    Francisco. The caterpillar is somewhat of the coloration of\r\n    that of _Vanessa Antiopa_, but short and thick like all the\r\n    _Melitæa_ caterpillars and beset with short fleshy thorns. The\r\n    dorsal row of spines is brick red and so is the lateral stripe\r\n    above the feet. All other parts, both of the body and spines,\r\n    are black, which tint, being thickly sprinkled with white dots\r\n    has a bluish luster like the same tint in the caterpillar of\r\n    _V. Antiopa_.\r\n\r\n    Most commonly this caterpillar is found on _Scrophularia_,\r\n    but I have found it also on _Diplacus glutinosus_ and on a\r\n    _Lonicera_, related to _L. Caprifolium_. The chrysalis is\r\n    white with black and yellow dots. The butterfly is developed\r\n    towards the end of April and is found until the end of June.\r\n    There exists only one generation. The caterpillars grow very\r\n    slowly through the summer. They are social and weave a kind of\r\n    nest, in which they also hibernate. In spring their growth is\r\n    quick enough, but they seem to be subject to much disease, and\r\n    even in their natural state are frequently found half dried up.\r\n    The butterfly also is often caught with crippled wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _M. Cooperi_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra ut _M. Chalcedontis_, subtus inferiores sulphureae\r\n    fasciis et maculis ordinariis fuscis, maculis fasciae\r\n    submarginalis _fuscis concoloribus, neque ullo halone\r\n    cicumdatae_.\r\n\r\n    This species is very similar to _M. Chalcedon_, but the want\r\n    of the yellowish halo around the lunulae of the brown band on\r\n    the underside, is a very positive diagnostic character. The\r\n    brown color of the bands also is always of the same somber\r\n    hue as that of the underside of the forewings, and never of\r\n    the fiery brick red that colors this fascia on the underside\r\n    of _M. Chalcedon_, forming a perceptible contrast to the\r\n    somber coloring of the underside of the forewings, which is\r\n    the same in _M. Chalcedon_ and _M. Cooperi_. With all these\r\n    well-marked differences, the two species look so much alike,\r\n    that it would have been a long time before _M. Cooperi_ would\r\n    have been recognized as a distinct species, if it had not\r\n    been for the striking difference of its caterpillar, which\r\n    was discovered by Mr. Lorquin near Clear Lake on a species of\r\n    _Scrophularia_. This caterpillar is much more elongated than\r\n    that of _Chalcedon_. It is nearly of the shape and coloration\r\n    of that of the European _M. Artemis_, brimstone yellow, with\r\n    a dorsal and a lateral black stripe. We were quite justified\r\n    in expecting from such a caterpillar something strikingly\r\n    different from the very common type of _Chalcedon_. But to\r\n    our surprise our chrysalids gave us a series of crippled\r\n    butterflies, which could scarcely be distinguished from _M.\r\n    Chalcedon_. Since that time I have received a well-developed\r\n    specimen through the kindness of Baron Koels, who caught it\r\n    with several other insects on an excursion to Mount Tamal Pais.\r\n\r\n    It is pretty certain that _M. Cooperi_ will be found in many\r\n    other localities, as it is only its similarity to our most\r\n    common vernal butterfly, the _M. Chalcedon_, that makes it\r\n    escape our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _M. Quino_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    _M. Chalcedonti_ similis sed antennae clava discolor, fusca nec\r\n    concolor antennae reliquae aurantiacae.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra ut in _M. Chalcedonte_ sed series macularum\r\n    submarginalium in anticis rubra et marginalium in posticis\r\n    flava rubro tincta. Series quarta in anticis bifida, fere tota\r\n    rubra, tertia in posticis omnino rubra.\r\n\r\n    Alae inferiores subtus ut in _M. Chalcedonte_ sed fascia flava\r\n    prope radicem in maculas sex dissecta maculaque flava discalis\r\n    puncto ejusdem coloris extus aucta.\r\n\r\n    _Melitæa Quino_ may at once be distinguished by the entirely\r\n    different and much gayer coloration of the upper side, which\r\n    much more resembles that of _M. Anicia_ than _M. Chalcedon_.\r\n    To the latter species it comes the nearest in the peculiar\r\n    shape of the wings, so characteristically different in the\r\n    two sexes. In _M. Anicia_ this difference exists but not to\r\n    the same degree. The yellow part of the underside of the\r\n    hindwings is much paler than in _M. Chalcedon_ and _M. Anicia_.\r\n    The yellow radical band is dissolved into six distinct but\r\n    nearly connected maculae. In _M. Chalcedon_ the band is not\r\n    interrupted and only the sixth macula is separated, making part\r\n    of the yellow coloration of the anal side of the wing. From _M.\r\n    Anicia_ it differs besides, in the underside of the forewings\r\n    being nearly all of a reddish-brown color with scarcely any\r\n    indication of the markings of the upperside, closely resembling\r\n    _M. Chalcedon_. From both species _M. Quino_ differs in the\r\n    coloration of the club of the antenna.\r\n\r\n    This species I received from Dr. Cooper, formerly of the State\r\n    Geological Survey, who collected several specimens near San\r\n    Diego. I have called it Quino in remembrance of the California\r\n    Pioneer, Padre Quino, the first European that ever succeeded in\r\n    erecting a permanent settlement in California, and at the same\r\n    time contributed very considerably by his learned writings to a\r\n    more exact knowledge of these then scarcely discovered regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. _M. Anicia_, Doubleday.\r\n\r\n    This species seems to be restricted to the eastern and more\r\n    elevated part of the State. Most of my specimens are from\r\n    Mariposa.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. _M. nubigena_, Behr, n. sp.\r\n\r\n    _M. Aniciae_ similis sed antennarum clava nigrescens, et subtus\r\n    in alis posticis fasciae pallidae intermediae bipartitae pars\r\n    exterior aurantiaca, ut fascia lunularum quae sequitur eam.\r\n\r\n    This species was caught in considerable numbers by Mr. Hoffman\r\n    at the headwaters of the Tuolumne River and beyond, up to\r\n    elevations of 11,500 feet. It evidently stands in the same\r\n    relation to _M. Anicia_ as in Europe _M. Merope_ does to _M.\r\n    Artemis_. I am not certain if _M. nubigena_ is to be considered\r\n    an alpine variety of _M. Anicia_ or an independent species, nor\r\n    as far as I know is the question yet decided as to the right\r\n    to distinction of _M. Merope_, a long-known alpine insect of\r\n    Europe. Nevertheless, considering the different coloration\r\n    of the antenna club, I am very much inclined to think _M.\r\n    nubigena_ more than a mere alpine variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. _M. Editha_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    This species is found in different localities near San\r\n    Francisco and Contra Costa. Nevertheless, it is much rarer than\r\n    _M. Chalcedon_ and of a more restless disposition. It makes its\r\n    appearance before _M. Chalcedon_ and is one of our first vernal\r\n    butterflies. About the caterpillar I have not yet succeeded in\r\n    ascertaining anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MELITÆA, Type IV.\r\n\r\n    Of this type only one Californian species is yet known, but\r\n    there may be perhaps some other species in the southern parts\r\n    of the State, as the subtropical territory of New Mexico seems\r\n    rather to abound in this type.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _M. Leanira_, Boisd. (In litteris.)\r\n\r\n    Antennae totae fulvae.\r\n\r\n    Alae supra nigrae, fasciis macularibus duabus et radicem\r\n    versus maculis tribus quadrangularibus omnibus gilvescentibus\r\n    instructae. Alae anticae prope marginem anticam, apicem versus\r\n    et ad marginem externam mediam, e nigro rubescentes.\r\n\r\n    Alae anticae subtus rubrae iisdem maculis ut supra ornatae.\r\n    Fascia macularis externa extus nigro marginata. Alae posticae\r\n    subtus gilvescentes nigro venosae, et nigro marginatae, radicem\r\n    versus nigro signatae; supra medium fascia nigra instructae,\r\n    catenam moniliformem continente punctorum gilvorum.\r\n\r\n    Limbus ubique et supra et subtus nigro alboque variegatus.\r\n\r\n    _M. Leanira_ is so distinct from all other _Melitæae_, that it\r\n    is impossible to make any error in reference to its diagnosis.\r\n    It is found in June and July in valleys of the Contra Costa\r\n    hills, where I collected it myself. I received other specimens\r\n    from Yosemite Valley. I have not succeeded in finding the\r\n    caterpillar.\r\n\r\n    I have to add a few observations regarding the geographical\r\n    distribution of the genus _Melitæa_ in general and of its\r\n    different types separately.\r\n\r\n    The genus _Melitæa_ spreads from the Arctic zone to the tropic\r\n    of Cancer and some mountain species even farther. Unlike the\r\n    genus _Argynnis_ in its geographical distribution _Melitæa_ has\r\n    no Antarctic species. It has its center of abundance in the\r\n    temperate zone and decreases towards the tropics as well as the\r\n    arctic zone. According to that peculiarity of the western slope\r\n    of continents by which the temperate zone is more developed in\r\n    extent and quality, than in the eastern slopes, the greatest\r\n    number of species are found in Europe and on our coast. Eastern\r\n    Asia has very few species, but the genus is better represented\r\n    on the Atlantic side of this continent, where however, it\r\n    appears in the aberrant forms of _M. Tharos_, _M. Pyrrha_, etc,\r\n    whose real nature seems still doubtful and which are at least\r\n    intermediate between _Argynnis_ and _Melitæa_.\r\n\r\n    The genuine type is very uniform, and therefore the diagnosis\r\n    of the Californian as well as the European species is enveloped\r\n    in many difficulties, so that even in regard to many European\r\n    species known and described for more than a century, the limits\r\n    of the species are frequently more or less doubtful and nearly\r\n    every Catalogue gives the series of closely allied species in a\r\n    different form.\r\n\r\n    California possesses two types wanting to the European Fauna;\r\n    Europe one type wanting to California. To us the type of _M.\r\n    Cinxia_ is wanting, to Europe that most characteristic form of\r\n    _M. Leanira_, which is a very natural transition to the genus\r\n    _Synchloe_. The other wanting to the old world is that of _M.\r\n    Pyrrha_, an osculant form peculiar to the new world where it\r\n    extends nearly as far as the equator.\r\n\r\n    As regards the development of the genus in size and brilliancy\r\n    of color, the Californians have a decided advantage. The giants\r\n    of the genus are all Californian and the coloration more bright\r\n    and more distinct than the somber hues of their less-developed\r\n    European allies.\r\n\r\n    Like the Argynnides the Melitæae are essentially local. There\r\n    is no Amphigeic species, and even the Polar species (which in\r\n    Argynnis are sometimes Amphigeic) are always different in this\r\n    genus, never occurring both in Europe and America. In the same\r\n    way the Atlantic and Pacific species seem always to differ.\r\n\r\n    These butterflies not having a very powerful flight are\r\n    generally confined to circumscribed localities, in which\r\n    they are generally plentiful and easily collected. Their\r\n    caterpillars are frequently social like those of the\r\n    _Vanessæ_, preferring the family of Scrophalarineous plants,\r\n    (_Scrophularia_ in California, _Linaria_ and _Veronica_ in\r\n    Europe), but inclined more to polyphagy than the Argynnides,\r\n    in their predilection for the Violarineae. Besides the\r\n    Scrophalarineae the _Melitæae_ live on _Plantago_, _Lonicera_,\r\n    _Scabiosa_, and some even are found on shrubby trees of\r\n    _Salix_, _Populus_, and _Fagus_.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper presented a continuation of his descriptions of fishes:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn new Genera and Species of Californian Fishes—No. II.\r\n\r\nBY J. G. COOPER, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    EXOCŒTUS, ARTEDI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    E. CALIFORNICUS, Cooper, Californian Flying-Fish, State\r\n    collection, species 1012. [FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Height of body one eighth of its length\r\n    from tip of nose to fork of tail, length of head almost one\r\n    fifth of the same (0·19). Width of forehead in front of eyes\r\n    more than five eighths the length of head (0·69); diameter of\r\n    eye less than one third of same length (0·30). Scale between\r\n    eyes equilateral, and a little less than half of the width\r\n    of head. No granulated area in front of orbit, and but a\r\n    very narrow one behind it. Preoperculum rounded rectangular.\r\n    Pectoral fin extending to halfway between end of dorsal and\r\n    base of caudal, 0·60 of total length. Ventrals inserted nearer\r\n    operculum than base of caudal, and extending to middle of anal.\r\n    Dorsal commencing over 36th scale and extending to 48th.\r\n\r\n    D. 12, P. 14, V. 6, A. 10, C. 3-1-4-5-1-6. Scales 58-7/1.\r\n\r\n    _Colors._—Steel-blue, fins smoky, below silvery, iris gilt.\r\n\r\n    _General form_ much elongated, subcylindrical. Top of head\r\n    perfectly flat, its width equal to its depth. Anterior half of\r\n    body nearly as broad as high, compressed above. Posterior half\r\n    compressed laterally, tapering to tail, the caudal peduncle\r\n    three times as high as it is broad. A slight ridge along\r\n    insertion of dorsal. Lateral line prominent, running close to\r\n    insertion of ventrals. Proportions of fins to total length, as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    Length of dorsal                  0·11\r\n    Height of ventrals                0·23\r\n    Length of anal                    0·07\r\n    Length of caudal, upper lobe      0·15\r\n    Length of caudal, lower lobe      0·22\r\n    Height of pectoral                0·60\r\n\r\n    Length of specimen fifteen inches, the figure representing it\r\n    half the natural size. One specimen obtained at Catalina Island.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—In the preceding diagnosis I have followed the\r\n    arrangement of specific characters adopted by Gill in his\r\n    description of two new species of _Exocœtus_ from the Pacific\r\n    Coast of Central America. (Proc. Acad. Phil., June, 1863, p.\r\n    167.) By comparison it will be seen that our species is very\r\n    distinct.\r\n\r\n    This large species of Flying-Fish is found in great numbers\r\n    during the summer south of Point Conception, and some wander as\r\n    far north as Santa Cruz at least. They can only be taken when\r\n    they happen to alight on board of a vessel or in gill-nets,\r\n    which I was not provided with during my late voyage among the\r\n    islands. Their flight is rarely higher than ten feet above the\r\n    water, but sometimes extends nearly a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n    UROLOPHUS, Müller and Henle.\r\n\r\n\r\n    UROLOPHUS HALLERI, Cooper, State collection, species 522. [FIG.\r\n    21.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Disk suborbicular, obtusely pointed\r\n    in front, and with the pectoral fins rounded behind. Length\r\n    anterior to anus a little greater than that of the tail\r\n    behind it. Posterior outline of ventral fins projecting a\r\n    little behind that of disk. Claspers as long as ventrals and\r\n    projecting entirely behind them. Tail 0·47 of total length,\r\n    gradually tapering from a cylindrical base to the spine, thence\r\n    becoming flattened laterally expanding into a fin, which\r\n    commences opposite the base of spine below, and ends opposite\r\n    to its end above, broadest near its end, where its width is\r\n    0·10 the length of tail. Spiracles a little larger than orbits\r\n    and farther apart, the distance between them equal to that from\r\n    snout to orbits. Ventrals forming nearly equilateral triangles,\r\n    their basal length one fifth that of head and body. Caudal\r\n    spine arising at 0·48 of the length of tail, and not quite one\r\n    third as long. Female more elongated than male but tail and\r\n    spine shorter; the ventrals a fourth longer and more acute.\r\n\r\n    _Colors._—Reddish speckled with yellow, below white. In some\r\n    specimens the dark and light colors above are about equally\r\n    distributed, the spots having a somewhat marbled arrangement.\r\n    In others the light spots are very few and widely separated.\r\n    Popular name “Round Stingray.” The figure is half the natural\r\n    size. The dots show the principal outlines of the cartilaginous\r\n    skeleton.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—While this fish has the nearly orbicular outline of\r\n    _Urotrygon_ (_mundus_), Gill, from Panama (Proc. Phil. Acad.,\r\n    June, 1863, p. 173), it differs generically in having obtusely\r\n    triangular teeth (equilateral), tail shorter than body, spine\r\n    nearest to its base, smooth skin, etc.\r\n\r\n    It differs from _Urolophus_, as described by Richardson, in the\r\n    upper velum of mouth being entire, and in having about twenty\r\n    small tubercles on the surface of lower velum. These however\r\n    can scarcely be considered generic differences.\r\n\r\n    Found abundantly in muddy creeks at San Pedro and San Diego,\r\n    those from the former place being more uniform in color.\r\n\r\n    While I was at San Diego the little son of Major G. O. Haller,\r\n    U. S. A. was wounded in the foot, probably by one of these\r\n    fish, while wading along a muddy shore of the bay. The wound\r\n    was very painful for some hours, though small. Another large\r\n    rhomboidal species also abundant there but apparently still\r\n    undescribed, inflicts very severe and dangerous wounds, of\r\n    which I may have more to say hereafter.\r\n\r\n    This fish has great muscular power and can dart very rapidly\r\n    through the water by lateral vibrations of its tail, at the\r\n    same time quickly flapping the edge of its disk, to keep its\r\n    level in the water and to regulate its direction.\r\n\r\n    It frequently buries itself slightly under the mud, and if\r\n    disturbed obscures the water by stirring the mud, vanishing\r\n    in the cloud thus raised to hide itself again. It will allow\r\n    a boat to pass over its place of concealment, and may, if\r\n    detected, be easily killed by a blow with the end of an oar.\r\n    Many are also caught in the seines of the fishermen.\r\n\r\n    Their food consists of small mollusca, crustacea and such other\r\n    animals, alive or dead, as they can obtain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 7TH, 1863.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent, ten members.\r\n\r\nDonations to Cabinet:\r\n\r\nRock Salt, from the Upper Colorado River, by F.

Mathewson, Esq., of Martinez, was elected resident member.\r\n\r\nThe following is an abstract of the Annual Reports of the officers of the\r\nSociety, for the past year (1863):\r\n\r\nThe Financial Report of the Trustees was received and accepted. During\r\nthe year, $815.35 have been received from various sources, besides the\r\nbalance on hand from 1862, of $141.22; $903.75 expended; and $52.82\r\nremains in the hands of the Treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian (Prof. Whitney) reported verbally, that about fifty\r\nvolumes have been added to the Library, mostly the publications of other\r\nSocieties; that some sets of Journals have been rendered complete, by his\r\nown donations, and that the volumes of the “American Journal of Science”\r\nhave been bound.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Mineralogy (Mr. Moore) reports, that the collection is\r\nin nearly the same condition that it was at the commencement of the\r\nlast year, that but few additions have been made, and that the work of\r\ncataloguing and classifying the specimens is in progress.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Palæontology (Mr. Gabb) made no report.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Botany (Dr. Kellogg) reports, that some additions have\r\nbeen made; that the collections are not in good condition for want of\r\nsuitable cases, and recommends that new cases be procured, and that a\r\nsuite of the specimens described by members of the Society be sent East,\r\nfor comparison with specimens in those herbariums to which we have no\r\naccess.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Zoology (Dr. Cooper) made a verbal report, that he has\r\nbeen absent the most of the year, and that the collection has not\r\nmaterially changed since the last report, with the exception of an\r\ninteresting collection of Birds deposited by Mr. Holder.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Conchology (Dr. Trask) reported verbally, that about three\r\nhundred species of shells have been added to the collection during the\r\nyear. Also, that he had received from Mr. Andrew Garrett, a collection of\r\none hundred and fifteen species of Hawaiian Fishes, for the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe Curator of Entomology (Dr. Behr) reported verbally, that there\r\nhave been no contributions, but that he will contribute from his own\r\ncollection, and other persons have expressed their desire to do likewise,\r\nwhen the Society shall possess the means of accommodating and preserving\r\nthe specimens.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the preceding year were reëlected, with the exception of\r\nTreasurer—S. Hubbard being elected in the place of Wm. Heffley, resigned.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution, prepared by Dr. Ayres, was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n    _Resolved_, That hereafter the Proceedings of the Academy be\r\n    distributed gratuitously only to resident members and to such\r\n    Societies and individuals as the Academy shall direct; and\r\n    that the price of subscription to others be regulated by the\r\n    Publishing Committee.\r\n\r\nThe Society authorized the publication of the following Constitutional\r\namendments, adopted at the annual meeting, January 6th, 1862, the\r\npublication of which was accidentally omitted in the Proceedings of that\r\nyear:\r\n\r\n    Amendment to Art. II, Sec. 4—That the Membership Fee, to be\r\n    paid by an applicant for Resident membership, shall be two\r\n    dollars, etc.—the remainder of the section remaining as before.\r\n\r\n    Amendment to Art. III, Sec. 2—This Association shall hold\r\n    meetings on the First and Third Monday evenings of each month,\r\n    for the investigation of Natural History, etc.—the remainder of\r\n    the section remaining as before.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres read extracts from letters containing inquiries in regard to\r\nthe first volume of the Proceedings of the Society, which terminated\r\nabruptly, and was never finished. The supply has long been exhausted,\r\nand the republication has been frequently discussed; but as yet this is\r\nbeyond the means of the Society.\r\n\r\nProf. Brewer communicated the following paper by Prof. Gray, giving\r\nthe first installment of a series of descriptions of new plants from\r\nthe botanical collections made by himself, while engaged in the State\r\nGeological Survey. These are a portion of the new species collected\r\nprevious to 1863. The remainder will be described in future papers, along\r\nwith those from the collection made after that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of New Californian Plants—No. I.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. ASA GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    STREPTANTHUS Nutt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _S. Breweri_, n. sp. [§ Euclisia.]\r\n\r\n    Wholly glabrous and glaucous, annual, branched from near\r\n    the base; cauline leaves (except the lowest) strongly\r\n    cordate-clasping, with a closed sinus, entire or denticulate,\r\n    the uppermost sagittate; flowers purple, on very short\r\n    ascending pedicels, the lowest often leafy-bracted; the buds\r\n    often a quarter of an inch long, obtuse, or barely acute;\r\n    the sepals with scarious but blunt recurved tips; siliques\r\n    narrowly linear, ascending or erect, straight or slightly\r\n    incurved (1½-2½ inches long, less than a line wide,) compressed\r\n    but torulose, the nerve of the valves obscure; seeds wholly\r\n    marginless.\r\n\r\n    This most resembles _S. tortuosus Kellogg_ (which is S.\r\n    _cordatus Torr._, in _Bot. Pacif. R. R. Whipple’s Rep._ but\r\n    evidently not of _Nuttall_), from which the above character\r\n    indicates the differences.\r\n\r\n    There are three forms in the collection: 1. A dwarf state, in\r\n    flower only, from Mt. Shasta, at an altitude of 8,000 feet. 2.\r\n    A very glaucous form, with more numerous and rather smaller\r\n    flowers, and with fruit, from the top of a dry mountain of\r\n    the Mt. Diablo Range, near head of Arroyo del Puerto, at an\r\n    altitude of 3,200 feet. 3. Another, in flower and fruit, with\r\n    more naked and virgate branches, a foot or two in height, from\r\n    San Carlos Mountain, near New Idria, 5,000 feet altitude. This\r\n    is remarkable for having the calyx hoary-downy, but the plant\r\n    is otherwise glabrous and glaucous.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _S. hispidus_, n. sp. (§ Euclisia.)\r\n\r\n    Very dwarf, (2-3 inches high, from an annual root,)\r\n    hispid throughout, even to the siliques; leaves cuneate\r\n    or obovate-oblong, coarsely toothed or incised, the\r\n    cauline-sessile but hardly at all clasping; raceme short and\r\n    loosely flowered; pedicels spreading or at length recurved in\r\n    flower (which is red or red-violet) but the linear compressed\r\n    siliques (1½ inch long, a line wide,) are erect; stigma almost\r\n    sessile; immature seeds winged.\r\n\r\n    Mt.

Valves of the capsule entire. Filaments\r\n    opposite and twice the length of the sepals, more dilated\r\n    and glandular at the base. Seeds minute, minutely muricate,\r\n    turgid. The fruit and seed are known only from Frémont’s\r\n    specimens communicated to Dr. Torrey (No. 284 of Coll. 1846,)\r\n    from California, a taller and less diffuse form than that\r\n    now collected by Prof. Brewer, and more like Nuttall’s, from\r\n    Tatnall County, Georgia. But my original specimen of the\r\n    latter little-known plant is too incomplete to make certain\r\n    the identity; and the two are widely sundered in geographical\r\n    station. Still no adequate characters yet appear to distinguish\r\n    specifically. Prof. Brewer collected his plant April 18th, in\r\n    the valleys among high ridges in Sonoma, where it abounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CALANDRINIA H. B. & K.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C.

Garrett, and presented the following\r\npaper:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of New Species of Fishes—No. II.\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW GARRETT, OF HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHEILODACTYLUS Lacep. 1803.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. vittatus_ Garrett.\r\n\r\n    B. 6; D. 17-30; A. 3-8; V. 1-5; P. 8-6; C. 5, 1, 7, 6, 1, 4.\r\n\r\n    The height of the body is a trifle less than one-third of\r\n    the total length. The upper profile rises in a convex line\r\n    from the snout to the occipital region, whence it suddenly\r\n    ascends in a nearly vertical curve, giving that portion of the\r\n    fish a strongly gibbous appearance. The body rapidly tapers\r\n    posteriorly, though preserving a slightly convex outline. The\r\n    head enters nearly four and a half times in the entire length.\r\n    The eyes are large, sub-circular in shape, even with the line\r\n    of profile, and their greatest diameter is nearly one-third the\r\n    length of the head. They are placed nearer the origin of the\r\n    lateral line than the end of the snout. The small maxillary\r\n    bone extends as far back as the anterior margin of the eye.\r\n\r\n    The dorsal fin takes its origin immediately above the posterior\r\n    limb of the orbit and terminates within one diameter of the eye\r\n    of the caudal fin. Its three anterior rays are very small, and\r\n    the fourth, which is the tallest, is one-third as long as the\r\n    base of the whole fin, or equal to two-thirds the height of the\r\n    body. Posteriorly the spiny rays rapidly diminish in altitude\r\n    so that the last one is shorter than the succeeding soft rays.\r\n    The soft portion of the fin is comparatively low, gently convex\r\n    along its upper edge, and is equally as long as the spiny part.\r\n    The anal fin is small, being inserted just in advance of the\r\n    middle of the soft portion of the dorsal. Its extreme margin\r\n    is slightly concave and the rays rapidly diminish in length\r\n    posteriorly. The ventrals when laid back reach as far as the\r\n    anal fin. The second simple pectoral ray extends as far back\r\n    as the vent. The caudal, which is deeply forked, has its lobes\r\n    rounded off.\r\n\r\n    Color greyish-silvery, and ornamented with five oblique\r\n    blackish-brown bands which are disposed as follows: one extends\r\n    from the snout to the preopercular margin, the second starts\r\n    from the eye and terminates on the pectoral base, the third,\r\n    which passes over the occipital region, extends below the\r\n    pectoral axilla; the fourth, which is much broader, starts from\r\n    the origin of the dorsal fin, curves downward and backward,\r\n    becoming wider in its descent, and passes beneath the abdomen;\r\n    the fifth one commences on the upper anterior half of the spiny\r\n    dorsal, extending along the back to near the termination of\r\n    that fin. Three irregular, pale spots may be observed in the\r\n    dorsal band, and three large blackish-brown spots on the caudal\r\n    trunk. The opercular flap and snout tinged with orange-red. The\r\n    interorbital space is marked with two transverse brownish-red\r\n    bands. Irides yellowish-silvery. That portion of the dorsal fin\r\n    anterior to the fifth band is white, the remainder, together\r\n    with the anal and caudal, light-yellowish, the latter tipped\r\n    with blackish-brown. The pectorals are orange-red, and the\r\n    ventrals are deep blackish-brown.\r\n\r\n    Length, 7 inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—An extremely rare fish, of which the solitary specimen\r\n    now before me is the only example that has come to my notice.\r\n    It is the more interesting in a geographical point of view, as\r\n    being the only species—as near as I can ascertain—recorded from\r\n    the Polynesian Seas. Sir John Richardson, in his interesting\r\n    “Notices of Australian Fish,” published in the “Proceedings\r\n    of the Zoological Society of London,” describes, and gives a\r\n    list of thirteen species. Nine of those occur in the Australian\r\n    Seas, one from China and Japan, two from the Cape of Good Hope,\r\n    and one from Tristan d’Acunha. In the number and arrangement\r\n    of the fasciae, our fish closely resembles the _C. gibbosus_,\r\n    Sol., (_Chætodon_) from Van Diemen’s Land. The latter species\r\n    is less gibbous, the eyes smaller, the soft portion of the\r\n    dorsal fin shorter, and the caudal forks are more pointed than\r\n    in the _C. vittatus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    APOGON Lacep. 1802.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A. maculiferus_, Garrett.\r\n\r\n    B. 7; D. 7-1-9; A. 2-8 V. 1-5; P. 13; C. 4, 1, 8, 7, 1, 3.\r\n\r\n    The upper profile of the head is slightly concave; otherwise\r\n    the general shape of the fish closely resembles the _Apogon\r\n    fraenatus_, Val. The greatest depth of the body, taken at the\r\n    commencement of the anterior dorsal fin, equals the length of\r\n    the head, or two-sevenths of the entire length of the fish. The\r\n    eye is large, sub-circular in shape, even with the upper line\r\n    of profile, and its diameter nearly one-third as long as the\r\n    head. The upper jaw is slightly the longest, and the hinder\r\n    termination of the maxillary is on a line with the posterior\r\n    border of the pupil. The margin of the preopercle is finely and\r\n    regularly dentated, and its anterior crest or ridge exhibits\r\n    but few irregular teeth. The lateral line may be traced over\r\n    twenty-four scales.\r\n\r\n    The first and second dorsal fin are of equal length along their\r\n    base, both being higher than long, and the altitude of the\r\n    latter, which exceeds that of the former, is, as compared to\r\n    the entire length of the fish, one to five. The anal fin is\r\n    inserted a trifle more posterior than the fin above. The large\r\n    ventrals, when laid back, cover the vent with their tips. The\r\n    caudal is sub-bifurcate.\r\n\r\n    Color brilliant silvery, with an iridescent reflection in which\r\n    carnation predominates. The upper two-thirds of the body is\r\n    ornamented with longitudinal rows of small olivaceous spots,\r\n    one on each scale, and those above the lateral line more or\r\n    less coalescing, forming broken bands. The head, which is more\r\n    or less tinged with diluted carmine-red, is marked by a diffuse\r\n    olivaceous band, which extends from the end of the snout,\r\n    passing through the eye and terminating on the opercle. Irides\r\n    silvery white; cornea black. The membranes of all the fins are\r\n    tinged with orange-yellow, and their rays are red.\r\n\r\n    Length, 5½ inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    Vernacular, “Upapalu.”\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—The longitudinal series of maculations will readily\r\n    determine this species. Under the lens the spots assume the\r\n    appearance of clusters of minute dots, some of which have blue\r\n    central points.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SCORPÆNA Artedi, (L.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _S. parvipinnis_, Garrett.\r\n\r\n    D. 13·10; A. 3-5; V. 1-5; P. 7-9; C. 5, 1, 6, 5, 1, 3.\r\n\r\n    In this species the upper and lower outlines are quite\r\n    similar, being gently arched. The greatest depth of the body\r\n    falls slightly short of one-third of the total length, and\r\n    the greatest thickness at the base of the head, is a little\r\n    more than two-thirds of the above mentioned depth. The head\r\n    constitutes just one-third of the whole fish. The eye is large,\r\n    circular, its diameter being nearly one-fourth of the length\r\n    of the head. Four spines may be seen along the upper edge of\r\n    the orbit, and the same number on each side of the occipital\r\n    region and nape, the posterior one the larger. Two intraorbital\r\n    spines, one on the nasal bone, and a longitudinal row of four\r\n    along the supratympanic region. Two on the opercle, the lower\r\n    one long and projecting posterior to the margin of that bone.\r\n    A stout one may be observed on the humeral region, one on the\r\n    infra-orbital, three on the margin of the preopercle, and a\r\n    longitudinal row of irregularly disposed ones along the cheek.\r\n    The lower jaw is slightly longer than the upper, and the tip\r\n    of the maxillary extends as far back as the hinder border of\r\n    the eye. Fine scales envelop the basal portions of all the fins\r\n    except the ventrals, and cover all parts of the head except the\r\n    jaws and the lower half of the maxillary bone. Minute filaments\r\n    are observed on all parts of the fish, being more numerous on\r\n    the upper anterior third of the body. The dorsal and anal fins\r\n    are small, the former commencing above the origin of the latter\r\n    line. The spiny portion of the dorsal is very low, gently\r\n    arched, and constitutes nearly two-thirds of the fin. The soft\r\n    portion of the anal fin is very narrow and rounded off.\r\n\r\n    The head and anterior half of the body is greyish, passing into\r\n    light carnation beneath, and obscurely clouded with dusky.\r\n    The posterior half of the body is dusky black, which fades\r\n    into pink beneath, maculated with small darker spots. Caudal\r\n    trunk, pink. Two large dusky black spots on the anterior dorsal\r\n    region. Irides greenish-yellow. Fins pinky-red, the spiny\r\n    dorsal mottled with dusky, and the other fins dotted with\r\n    pinky-brown, and a bar of the same color on the caudal base.\r\n\r\n    Length, 4 inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—The scaly head, small dorsal and anal fin will readily\r\n    distinguish this beautiful species.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CRENILABRUS, Cuv.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. modestus_, Garrett.\r\n\r\n    B. 6; D. 12-10; A. 3-12; V. 1-5; P. 17; C. 2, 1, 6, 6, 1, 2.\r\n\r\n    The greatest depth, which occurs beneath the origin of the\r\n    dorsal fin, is about one-fourth of the total length, and the\r\n    greatest thickness is just half of the above mentioned depth.\r\n    The head, which comprises a little more than one-fourth of the\r\n    whole fish, presents a slight concave depression above the\r\n    eyes. The preopercular serrations are very small. The eyes\r\n    are sub-circular, their greatest diameter entering nearly six\r\n    times in the length of the head, and twice in advance of their\r\n    own orbit. The hinder tip of the maxillary reaches a vertical,\r\n    passing through the center of the eye. Twelve longitudinal\r\n    rows of scales may be enumerated between the lateral line and\r\n    the vent, ten rows on the side of the caudal trunk, and the\r\n    median longitudinal row on the body contains thirty scales. The\r\n    lateral line, which passes over thirty-three scales, consists\r\n    of slightly branched tubes.\r\n\r\n    The dorsal fin extends over a base equal to half the length of\r\n    the fish, caudal fin excluded. Its soft portion falls slightly\r\n    short of one-third of the whole fin. The anal fin, which is\r\n    nearly half as long as the dorsal, has its hinder termination\r\n    slightly more posterior. The acuminately pointed ventrals,\r\n    when closely appressed to the abdomen nearly reach the anal\r\n    fin. The large caudal has its posterior upper and lower angles\r\n    considerably prolonged and pointed.\r\n\r\n    Color purplish-brown, passing into bluish grey beneath, and\r\n    obsoletely lineated longitudinally with darker. A large oblong\r\n    pale diffuse spot beneath the posterior end of the dorsal\r\n    fin, which is directed obliquely downward and forward. Irides\r\n    silvery, tinged with yellow. The dorsal fin is pale greyish,\r\n    marked anteriorly with a large diffuse blue-black spot, its\r\n    soft portion being tinged with reddish and margined above with\r\n    yellow. The anal, ventrals and caudal are bluish-grey, the\r\n    former posteriorly tinged with faded red and edged with yellow.\r\n    Pectorals nearly colorless.\r\n\r\n    Length, 18 inches.\r\n\r\n    Habitat, Sandwich Islands.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—We have obtained only two individuals of this large\r\n    species, both of which were exposed for sale in the Honolulu\r\n    fish-market. The colors, which are no doubt considerably\r\n    changed, were taken from the dead fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHIRONECTES Cuv. 1817.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. niger_, Garrett.\r\n\r\n    D. 3-12; A. 6; V. 5; P. 10; C. 1, 7. 1.\r\n\r\n    The head constitutes about one-third of the total length,\r\n    caudal excluded. The eyes are elliptically-oval, and inserted\r\n    just once their greatest diameter distant from the margin\r\n    of the upper jaw. The skin is covered with fine closely set\r\n    prickly asperities, which gives it a velvety appearance. The\r\n    general outline is ovate, and the greatest thickness equals\r\n    one-sixth of the entire length. A range of conspicuous pores\r\n    commences on the upper part of the gill covers, curving\r\n    downward and upward to the symphysis of the lower jaw. Another\r\n    row follows the margin of the upper jaw, passing over the\r\n    snout, where it branches off posteriorly, curving over the\r\n    eye and disappearing on the posterior portion of the body.\r\n    Each pore is encircled with brush-like appendages, which gives\r\n    them a tufted appearance. The dorsal fin extends over a base\r\n    equal to one-third the length of the fish. Its upper margin is\r\n    arched, and its height as compared to length is as one to two.\r\n    The height and length of the anal fin are about equal.\r\n\r\n    Color deep black and obsoletely maculated with rather small\r\n    roundish darker spots. On the basal portion of the dorsal and\r\n    anal fins may be observed two large ocellations, with deep\r\n    black pupils and paler areolae.

[FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Form elongated, high and narrow, the\r\n    head wider than the thickest part of body. Length of snout\r\n    equal to diameter of eye, lower jaw very slightly longest.\r\n    Total length a little more than four and a half times that\r\n    of head, which is equal to the greatest height of body. Head\r\n    moderately arched, rounded above, the width between eyes a\r\n    little less than the width of orbit. Orbit circular, contained\r\n    four and a half times in length of head. Anterior lobe of\r\n    dorsal commencing just behind head, triangular, one-twentieth\r\n    of the length of fin, equal to the middle lobe in height;\r\n    middle lobe gradually arched, its spines more slender than\r\n    those of the first lobe; posterior lobe with soft rays only,\r\n    about equal to the first, in size and form, extending nearly to\r\n    the tail. Caudal fin quadrangular, its end obtusely truncate,\r\n    nearly twice as long as wide. Anal commencing opposite\r\n    seventeenth dorsal spine, nearly straight, its height one-fifth\r\n    its length, and ending a little anterior to end of dorsal.\r\n    Ventrals narrow, the middle ray longest. Pectorals arising\r\n    opposite third dorsal spine, nearly as wide as long.\r\n\r\n    D.

The fins have alternating\r\n    bands, and in all the specimens the membrane between the third\r\n    and fourth dorsal spine is as clear as glass, as if intended\r\n    to be seen through, but probably shines in the water as a sort\r\n    of signal. When fresh the colors of those from San Diego were\r\n    as follows: 1st, dark brown, a purple lateral stripe, sides\r\n    with dark and light brown bars, having silvery blotches between\r\n    them; below yellowish, top and sides of head blotched with\r\n    yellow, a bright red ring with a green centre near pectorals,\r\n    and another near caudal. Dorsal with alternating bars of olive\r\n    and yellow; pectoral yellow at base, its rays reddish, barred\r\n    with purple, ventrals and anal smoky.\r\n\r\n    Another was striped and cross-barred with brown, and mingled\r\n    with this pattern were blotches of olive-brown, yellowish and\r\n    purple, but no rings. Fins marked like the body, but paler.\r\n\r\n    It is possible that the rings observed in the first one, and\r\n    not seen in any other, were caused by the growth of vegetable\r\n    parasites, which are often found on fish of similar habits.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—This is the first instance of a _Myxodes_ being found\r\n    on our coast north of the equator, though a nearly allied\r\n    genus, the _Heterostichus_, has been long known. I was in some\r\n    doubt whether to refer the fish to _Myxodes_ on account of the\r\n    meagre descriptions of the genus accessible, but having sent a\r\n    copy of the outline to Mr. Gill, I have been confirmed in the\r\n    correctness of the diagnosis. The following are some of the\r\n    most important generic characters not shown in the outline of\r\n    our species:\r\n\r\n    Branchiæ VI-VI, the apertures freely connected below. Teeth\r\n    uniserial in each jaw, those of lower jaw largest, some of\r\n    those along sides larger than the rest. No teeth on vomer.\r\n    Scales minute, entire, cycloid, closely adherent—none on head\r\n    or fins.\r\n\r\n    The two-lobed form of the spinous dorsal does not apparently\r\n    exist in some of the species. Suspecting that some of the\r\n    other characters will be found sufficient to distinguish it, I\r\n    propose for it provisionally the name GIBBONSIA, in honor of\r\n    Dr. W. P. Gibbons, of Alameda County, whose descriptions of our\r\n    viviparous fishes, published in 1854, by the Academy, have only\r\n    of late been awarded the credit they deserve.\r\n\r\n    These beautiful little fish are found at low water in holes\r\n    among rocks along our coast south of Point Conception, and at\r\n    the adjoining islands. Their varied and elegant coloration\r\n    would make them beautiful objects for a marine aquarium, but\r\n    I had nothing suitable for the purpose, in which I could keep\r\n    them alive long enough to study their habits.\r\n\r\n    I obtained three at Pt. Loma, San Diego, three at Catalina\r\n    I., and two at Santa Barbara I., all manifestly of the same\r\n    species, though differing individually in color, as above\r\n    mentioned. They have no popular name.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GILLICHTYHS, n. g.[8]\r\n\r\n    _Generic characters._—Form moderately elongated, laterally\r\n    compressed. Head depressed, broader than body, forming more\r\n    than one-fourth of total length. Eyes small, situated far\r\n    forward, and obliquely turned upward. Mouth moderate, its gape\r\n    extending to the vertical of the posterior rim of orbit, but\r\n    the angle of lower jaw half way to branchial aperture. Upper\r\n    maxillaries extending back the same distance, thence prolonged\r\n    by a cartilaginous expansion which reaches as far back as the\r\n    opercular opening, and being there connected to an expansion\r\n    of the skin of the lower jaw, forms a channel running back\r\n    from the mouth and as long as the gape of the mouth itself.\r\n    This channel is entirely free from the side of head, but only\r\n    slightly movable forwards, so that it cannot serve to widen the\r\n    mouth when opened.\r\n\r\n    Premaxillaries not protractile, movable at their symphysis, and\r\n    only half as long as maxillaries, with which they are connected\r\n    by a thin membrane, ending below orbit.\r\n\r\n    Villiform teeth on premaxillaries throughout, also on lower\r\n    maxillaries to angle of mouth, and on pharyngeals; none on\r\n    upper maxillaries, vomer or palate. A minute nasal aperture\r\n    close behind maxillary and another opening just in front of\r\n    anterior rim of orbit.\r\n\r\n    Preoperculum covered by the skin of the head.\r\n\r\n    Branchiæ four, all double, and free, opercular apertures small,\r\n    as wide as base of pectorals, and separated by the whole width\r\n    of the base of head.\r\n\r\n    Tongue broad and thick. Air-bladder small, liver very large and\r\n    alimentary canal short.\r\n\r\n    Scales small, cycloid and thin, imbedded in the skin so as to\r\n    be scarcely perceptible anterior to dorsal fin, or on back.\r\n    None on ventral surface.\r\n\r\n    No lateral line perceptible. Dorsal fins two, situated far\r\n    back, and rather large. Caudal small, obtusely rounded. Anal\r\n    opposite to second dorsal. Ventrals united into a funnel-shaped\r\n    disk opposite base of pectorals. Pectorals large and rounded.\r\n    Fin rays all soft, dividing into three or four branches toward\r\n    their ends. A small “_papilla genitalis_” in front of anal fin.\r\n\r\n    Whole fish covered with thick mucous secretion. Skin of head\r\n    rather loose and soft, and perfectly smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GILLICHTHYS MIRABILIS Cooper, State Coll. No. 627.

In alcohol black, pale below, and\r\n    scales below middle of sides finely punctate each with 8-10\r\n    dots, only visible under a microscope.\r\n\r\n    _Hab._—I found these remarkable fish only in San Diego Bay, and\r\n    in but one station, which was among seaweed growing on small\r\n    stones at the wharf of Newtown the military post, in November,\r\n    1861. They were left by the receding of the tide, and must have\r\n    been out of the water from three to six hours daily, though\r\n    kept moist by the seaweed. The four obtained were all females\r\n    containing large masses of ova, and may have come to the spot\r\n    in order to deposit them.\r\n\r\n    I could not obtain a glass vessel suitable for an aquarium, so\r\n    as to keep them alive and observe their habits. The use of the\r\n    strange maxillary processes or channels is obscure, nothing\r\n    analogous being known in other fishes, the nearest approach\r\n    to them being apparently the lengthened maxillaries of some\r\n    _Salmonidæ_ and _Clupeidæ_, fish of entirely different habits\r\n    and affinities, this one being evidently one of the _Gobidæ_.\r\n    The stomach contained small crabs, apparently swallowed whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PTEROPLATEA Müller and Henle, 1837.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _P. marmorata_, Cooper, State Collection, Species 674. [FIG.\r\n    25.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._—Outline of disk rhomboidal, the anterior\r\n    borders forming an obtuse angle in front, nearly straight in\r\n    their course to the lateral angles, which are sub-acute; the\r\n    posterior borders rounded.\r\n\r\n    Ventrals small, oblong, obtuse-angled, projecting a little\r\n    behind the disk. Tail nearly twice the length of ventrals,\r\n    slender and pointed, flattened laterally behind the spine, and\r\n    bordered by a very narrow membrane, commencing opposite the end\r\n    of the spine below, and ending a little farther back above.\r\n\r\n    Spine arising at a point one-third the length of the tail from\r\n    its base, one-sixteenth of its length, and less than a fourth\r\n    as wide as it is long.\r\n\r\n    Both surfaces are nearly flat.\r\n\r\n    Proportional measurements:\r\n\r\n    Total length of specimen, 9½ in.      100.\r\n    From median line to tip of pectoral      .80\r\n    From anterior angle to eyes              .13\r\n    From anterior angle to ventrals          .70\r\n    Antero-posterior length of ventrals      .10\r\n    Length of claspers                       .04\r\n    Length of tail beyond ventrals           .25\r\n    Length of caudal spine                   .04\r\n    Distance between eyes                    .15\r\n\r\n    _Colors._—Thickly marbled with blackish and grayish mottlings\r\n    equal in size; ventrals and tail with a few scattered white\r\n    spots; below, white. It is probable that the colors are\r\n    variable, as in the allied _Urolophus_.\r\n\r\n    I was doubtful at first whether to consider this fish a\r\n    _Pteroplatea_, as that genus is described by Richardson as\r\n    having the mouth curved, and the dental plate extending to its\r\n    corners, also the teeth lobed. These characters, however, may\r\n    change with its growth, this being evidently a young specimen.\r\n    Mr. Gill, of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D. C., to\r\n    whom I sent a figure of it, agrees with me in referring it to\r\n    this genus.\r\n\r\n    Compared with the _P. Maclura_ (Lesueur), of the Atlantic\r\n    coast, described and figured by Dekay in the Nat. History\r\n    of New York, this species is less wide in proportion to its\r\n    length, the difference being as 10 to 16. There is also some\r\n    difference in the markings. The _P. Maclura_ is said to attain\r\n    the enormous width of 18 feet.\r\n\r\n    I found but one specimen of this fish at San Diego, where it\r\n    was caught in a seine. I have also seen one, when the steamer\r\n    was lying at anchor, at San Pedro, swimming near the surface\r\n    of the water, apparently supporting itself by flapping its\r\n    wing-like expansions, while it progressed slowly by lateral\r\n    motions of its tail.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—By an oversight of the printer, the proper references to\r\n    the figures on page 110 were left out. The reader will however\r\n    understand from the descriptions that the right hand figure is\r\n    the _Myxodes_ (Fig. 23), and the others the _Gillichthys_ (Fig.\r\n    24).\r\n\r\n    TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE.—This oversight has been addressed!\r\n    Illustrations were relabelled correctly and placed next to the\r\n    text describing them.\r\n\r\n    [8] Named in honor of Mr. THEODORE GILL, of the Smithsonian\r\n    Institution, Washington D.

WM. H. BREWER, OF THE STATE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.\r\n\r\n    More than two years ago I laid before this Society some facts\r\n    in regard to the growth of plants in the thermal waters of this\r\n    State. Since that time we have more observations, and some of\r\n    the facts are worthy of record, although the fact is not new\r\n    that plants will grow in hot water.\r\n\r\n    At the Geysers in Lake County, there are numerous hot springs\r\n    and steam jets, in and around which there is an abundant growth\r\n    of a low form of vegetation (_Nostoc_?) growing on the soil and\r\n    covering it with a bright green coating. In some of the warm\r\n    springs and streams it accumulates in considerable quantities\r\n    in the water. The highest temperature of water observed at the\r\n    time of our visit, in 1861, was 207° F.; the water of many of\r\n    the springs boiling violently at temperatures ranging from\r\n    196° to that stated. This vegetable flourished in waters of\r\n    the temperature of 200° F., but was most abundant where the\r\n    temperature ranged from 125° to 140° F. It coated the soil\r\n    around the steam jets, where it would be alternately exposed to\r\n    the jets of steam issuing at a higher temperature than that of\r\n    boiling water, and of the cooler air.\r\n\r\n    In water of the temperatures of 100° to 125° there are\r\n    filamentons algæ.\r\n\r\n    At the Little Geysers similar facts were observed.\r\n\r\n    In Plumas County, near Lassens Peak, there are three groups\r\n    of hot springs, at all of which the same form of vegetation\r\n    is abundant under similar conditions, especially around steam\r\n    jets. Various gases, especially sulphohydric and sulphurous\r\n    acids, accompanying the steam in all of these localities,\r\n    and the soil is generally impregnated with various saline\r\n    substances. All the specimens of the plants were unfortunately\r\n    lost, so that no microscopic examination has been made, further\r\n    than could be done on the spot with a pocket lens.\r\n\r\n    Near all of these springs, the _Panicum thermale_ Bolander,\r\n    grows on the saline soils, sometimes where the soil is warm\r\n    and the grass is subjected to steam; but its station appears\r\n    to depend more upon the saline character of the soil than upon\r\n    its temperature. It was frequently found on soil saturated\r\n    with sulphates of soda, lime, etc., and having a strongly acid\r\n    reaction.\r\n\r\n    None of these forms are universally found about all the hot\r\n    springs of the State; many springs have been visited where\r\n    neither of them occur, but where one is found the other is\r\n    generally found also.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper presented the following paper for Dr. Newcomb, corresponding\r\nmember:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of a New Species of Pedicularia.\r\n\r\nBY W.

VANESSIDÆ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GRAPTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Grapta Comma_ Harris.\r\n\r\n    I possess but one specimen of this Grapta. It was collected by\r\n    Dr. Hillebrand, in Yosemite Valley, during his late visit to\r\n    California. It agrees in all essential points with two other\r\n    specimens which I obtained through the kindness of Mr. W. H.\r\n    Edwards, of New York. The California specimen differs by a\r\n    somewhat lighter coloration on both sides, especially below\r\n    where the ground color passes into a yellowish brown, while in\r\n    the Eastern specimen it becomes a bluish gray. On the upper\r\n    side, also, the bluish coloration of the edge of the angulated\r\n    wings of the Eastern form is replaced by a yellowish tint.\r\n\r\n    I would be inclined to take _G. Comma_ for a local variety of\r\n    _G. C-album_, were it not for the caterpillar, which, according\r\n    to Mr. Harris, resembles that of _G. interrogationis_, and\r\n    is entirely without that strangely dimidiate coloration so\r\n    characteristic in _G. C-album_.\r\n\r\n    In _G. C-album_ I cannot find any difference between my\r\n    Californian and European specimens. Our vernal generation is\r\n    larger and somewhat lighter colored than any European specimens\r\n    I have ever seen. The caterpillar has a curious dimidiate\r\n    coloration, which I have never seen except in this species: the\r\n    fore part being white, the abdominal part yellow. I found it\r\n    on Urtica, but it will probably be found on other Urticaceous\r\n    plants, herbaceous as well as arborescent. _G. C-album_ is not\r\n    common in the immediate neighborhood of San Francisco, but it\r\n    is rather abundant in woody and mountainous districts.\r\n\r\n    The Atlantic States are richer in species of this genus than\r\n    either Europe or California, the two latter of which possess\r\n    the same number of species.\r\n\r\n      Europe.

Urticæ_ L., from which it differs\r\n    very little. It is of a velvety black, and the spines which\r\n    cover it are also black.\r\n\r\n    _V. Californica_ is remarkable from its being one of the few\r\n    wandering Lepidoptera yet known. The first migration I observed\r\n    was on November 15th, 1856, when numbers of this butterfly flew\r\n    over San Francisco in a general direction of south-south-east.\r\n    They flew singly, and never crowded into swarms. Most of these\r\n    butterflies passed over our streets at too great a height\r\n    to permit close inspection—a few alighting here and there\r\n    on lamp-posts, sign-boards, or in the more rural parts, on\r\n    flowers. It was from these that I obtained the specimens in\r\n    my collection. They nearly all looked worn and shattered, and\r\n    there were no fresh specimens among them: clearly indicating\r\n    that they were not raised in the neighborhood of the city,\r\n    but had come from distant parts. On the 18th some of the\r\n    stragglers were still to be seen, but on the 19th they had\r\n    all disappeared. The second migration took place last fall,\r\n    but did not reach San Francisco. I received a series of\r\n    specimens, caught by Dr. Cooper, on the road to Lake Taho.\r\n    Others I received from Oregon, where they were collected by\r\n    Mr. Gabb, during his geological examination of those northern\r\n    regions. Neither Dr. Cooper nor Mr. Gabb observed any marked\r\n    direction in the flight of these butterflies; they agree that\r\n    the species was strikingly numerous. Mr. Gabb represents it\r\n    as settling on the ground in dry arroyos, very shy, and when\r\n    frightened, always returning to the same spot—a behavior which\r\n    pretty nearly corresponds with that of the nearest relative,\r\n    the European _V. Polychloros_. Both of these authorities prove\r\n    merely an unusual number of this butterfly at an unusual time\r\n    of the year. The description of the habits of the insect, as\r\n    observed by Mr. Gabb in the Umpqua Valley, show clearly that\r\n    there it felt at home. By comparing notes received from Mr.\r\n    Johnson, of Marin County, I have come to the conclusion that\r\n    the country to the northward, crowded with this Vanessa, must\r\n    have sent at least one colony south; and I was told by the\r\n    above-mentioned gentleman, the statement being confirmed by\r\n    several intelligent farmers of the same neighborhood, that\r\n    large numbers of a brown butterfly had come from San Quentin,\r\n    and crossed over that part of the bay which stretches between\r\n    San Rafael and Saucelito. About the same time, great numbers of\r\n    the same insect were observed in Lagunita Valley, at the base\r\n    of Tamal Pais, where the swarms gathered in a great crowd, and\r\n    disappeared as suddenly as they came.\r\n\r\n    I trust that my loquacity in regard to the habits of this\r\n    species will be pardoned. I consider the observation of facts\r\n    touching the migration of animals, of the highest importance,\r\n    and think it desirable that all observations on these points\r\n    should be put on record: so that hereafter, when a sufficient\r\n    number of instances may have been collected, conclusions may\r\n    be drawn, and perhaps many hitherto inexplicable points in the\r\n    geographical distribution of insects, and of organic life in\r\n    general, may be explained.\r\n\r\n    This butterfly is rather rare in common years, and is, perhaps,\r\n    notwithstanding its name, _V. Californica_, not exactly an\r\n    indigenous species, at least not in the middle counties of our\r\n    State. Unlike all other _Vanessidæ_ known to me, it has but one\r\n    generation, at least in California, where the imago is always\r\n    found late in the season. I do not venture to decide whether\r\n    _V. Californica_ requires a longer time for development in the\r\n    larva state than the other _Vanessidæ_, or whether it has\r\n    its vernal generations somewhere else in adjacent countries.\r\n    I have found but one colony of caterpillars. It was in July,\r\n    and most of the individuals were nearly full grown; they were\r\n    rather delicate, the majority died in the larva state, seven\r\n    transformed about the end of the month, and a single chrysalis\r\n    produced a crippled butterfly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Vanessa Milberti_ Godt.\r\n\r\n    This species is common in woody localities. The caterpillar\r\n    is very much like that of _V. Californica_, and only a few\r\n    individuals show a distinguishing mark in the shape of a\r\n    longitudinal, lateral stripe of sulphur yellow. It feeds on\r\n    _Urtica_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Vanessa Antiopa_ L.\r\n\r\n    There is nothing to add in regard to this long and well-known\r\n    species. The caterpillar feeds here, as everywhere else, on\r\n    willows.\r\n\r\n    The true Vanessæ have about the same geographical distribution\r\n    as the Graptæ. They also have a predilection for Urticaceous\r\n    plants. Only the most northern species is amphigeic.\r\n\r\n     Europe.             California.         Atlantic Slope.\r\n\r\n    _V.

C-album._\r\n\r\n    There is a balance in favor of the Old World—the beautiful type\r\n    of _V. Io_ not being represented on this continent—and also the\r\n    type of _V. Polychloros_, containing a few species, as, for\r\n    instance, _V. Xanthomelas_, that make it appear more numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PYRAMEIS Hubn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Pyrameis Atalanta_ L.\r\n\r\n    Larva feeds on Urtica.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Pyrameis Carye._\r\n\r\n    This species is by far the most common butterfly in California.\r\n    The caterpillar is very variable in its coloration, and is\r\n    so like that of _P. Atalanta_, in company with which it is\r\n    frequently found, that I have never succeeded in finding any\r\n    distinguishing characters. It feeds throughout the year on\r\n    _Urtica_ and on several malvaceous plants, and has the habit of\r\n    all its congeners, of hiding itself in a rolled up leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Pyrameis Cardui_ L.\r\n\r\n    This most cosmopolitan of all diurnals, affects here, in its\r\n    larva state, several malvaceous plants, and also the genus\r\n    _Gnaphalium_, and its relations; but the plant for which it\r\n    shows the greatest predilection is _Silybum Marianum_, a\r\n    plant which formerly did not exist here, and has only spread\r\n    since 1852. It now forms thickets in the neighborhood of San\r\n    Francisco, as well as near most of our inland towns, but has\r\n    never spread to a great distance from settlements. _P. Cardui_\r\n    frequents the same localities, and I found the same species in\r\n    Australia in the same relation to the same immigrated plant,\r\n    _Silybum Marianum_. I know very well that _P. Cardui_ existed\r\n    here, as well as in Australia, before the immigration of this\r\n    Mediterranean plant; but still, it is a remarkable fact that\r\n    this cosmopolitan butterfly, notwithstanding its ability to\r\n    adapt itself to plants of the most different families, still\r\n    clings with such tenacity to a cosmopolitan plant, to whose\r\n    universal distribution it is perhaps much indebted for the wide\r\n    range which it itself attains.\r\n\r\n    Next to the cosmopolitan character of this plant, _P. Cardui_\r\n    owes its great extent probably to its many generations and\r\n    certain irregularities in the time of the appearance of the\r\n    perfect insect; so that small colonies of the species are\r\n    not so liable to be destroyed by inclemency of climate or\r\n    exceptional atmospheric agencies; for a being that exists at\r\n    the same time in the four stages of the egg, larva, chrysalis,\r\n    and imago, has more chances of escaping cataclysms and deluge\r\n    than others that are all at one time in the same stage of\r\n    existence. The extent of the influence exerted by the number\r\n    of generations, and the irregularity of period, can be very\r\n    clearly recognized by the circumstance that species with one\r\n    generation are always the most local; for instance, certain\r\n    _Meliteæ_, _Argynnidæ_, _Theclæ_, most of _Sphingidæ_, etc.;\r\n    that also the cosmopolitanism develops in proportion to the\r\n    number of generations, and attains its maximum in certain\r\n    _Vanessidæ_, _Danaidæ_, _Pyrameis_, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Pyrameis Hunteri_ Fab.\r\n\r\n    This species seems to have, in California, but one generation.\r\n    It is not common. I have found it only in the latter part\r\n    of the season, and have not yet succeeded in finding the\r\n    caterpillar. The genus _Pyrameis_ has the widest range of all\r\n    the genera of this family. It extends through all latitudes\r\n    from the Arctic regions to the Cape of Good Hope and Cape\r\n    Horn. On the northern hemispheres it is best represented in\r\n    California, which country possesses one peculiar species in\r\n    addition to all three of Europe and the Eastern Slope of the\r\n    United States.\r\n\r\n     California.

Californica_, there is not yet\r\n    found any species of this group peculiar to our State, for even\r\n    _P. Carye_ exists as well in Chili as here, and is also said to\r\n    have been found in Brazil. This circumstance is more striking\r\n    since our _Argynnidæ_ and _Meliteæ_ prove altogether local;\r\n    none of them being identical with Eastern species, unless a\r\n    _Melitæa_, of the type of _Mylitta_, should be found identical\r\n    with a form found in Texas. 2. The genera of this group,\r\n    north of the Tropic of Cancer, are essentially amphigeic, the\r\n    European _Arachnia_ being almost the sole exception. But, as\r\n    it were, to compensate this, the tropical amphigeic genus\r\n    _Junonia_, wanting in Europe, extends, on our continent, to\r\n    high latitudes. 3. As regards the number of specks, the genus\r\n    _Grapta_ predominates at the Eastern Slope, _Vanessa_ in\r\n    Europe, _Pyrameis_ in California, and our own _Junonia_ is\r\n    counterbalanced in Europe by our _Arachnia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FAM.

TRASK, M.D.\r\n\r\n    During the year 1863 we have had but five earthquakes, and as\r\n    in former years they have been marked by no serious event, if\r\n    we except the light degree of fright induced at the time among\r\n    our people.\r\n\r\n    January 25th.—A severe shock was experienced at San Diego at\r\n    2h. 20m. M., which lasted five to eight seconds. There was no\r\n    undulation in this case, it consisting of a series of sharp\r\n    jars. It was preceded by a deep rumbling noise.\r\n\r\n    February 1st.—A very smart shock at the Mission San Juan,\r\n    Monterey County, at 4h. 1m. P.M. This shock was felt at Gilroys\r\n    at 4h. 15m. This town is twelve miles east of the former. At\r\n    both places the shock was marked by the undulatory motion. It\r\n    was not observed at Monterey, which is nearly twelve miles west\r\n    of the Mission.\r\n\r\n    June——A smart shock at midnight at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    August 1st.—Two light shocks at San Francisco, at 10h. 48m.\r\n    P.M., and at 11h. 6m. P.M., another shock.\r\n\r\n    December 19th.—At 2h. 38m. P.M. a smart shock was felt\r\n    throughout the city; directly afterwards another and more\r\n    severe one occurred. The first was a short, sudden jar, while\r\n    the second was undulatory. The accuracy of the telegraph\r\n    operator at Santa Clara has enabled us to form a correct idea\r\n    of the course of this shock, and to correct to some extent the\r\n    popular errors relating to the direction of the seismic wave.\r\n    His time was 2h. 44m. 31s., being within 29 seconds of true\r\n    time, which would then be 2.45. This gives us only 6½ minutes\r\n    difference in elapsed time, and gives for the direction of the\r\n    wave an east course in place of north and south, as reported,\r\n    which corresponds to our measured observations here. I take\r\n    this opportunity of expressing the thanks of the Academy to\r\n    this operator for his accuracy and kindness in furnishing us\r\n    data in this and other phenomena of scientific and public\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    February and March, 1864.\r\n\r\n    During the present year, 1864, we have had two smart\r\n    earthquakes at the date of writing this report.\r\n\r\n    February 26th.—At San Francisco a light shock at 0h. 40m.\r\n    M., and another at 2h. 10m. M. These were reported to me by\r\n    persons who were up in the south and west parts of the city.\r\n    At 5h. 47m. a very smart shock occurred, having three distinct\r\n    vibrations, which induced many to rise somewhat earlier than\r\n    was usual. This earthquake was preceded by a strong _electric\r\n    storm_ (so called here), between this city and Visalia; the\r\n    particulars of which have not as yet all come to hand. It was\r\n    followed next day by one of those severe “northers” with which\r\n    the people of this State are very familiar. Barometer very low.\r\n    This fact is mentioned only on account of the unseasonable\r\n    period at which the gale occurred.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake was felt more severe at San José and Santa\r\n    Clara than at this place, and occurred at nearly the same hour.\r\n\r\n    March 5th.—A severe shock of earthquake at San Francisco at\r\n    8h. 49m. M. The first wave had a north and south direction\r\n    and continued 1¾ seconds; nearly 1¾ seconds elapsed before\r\n    the second shock, which was at 8h. 49m. 3s., and continued 1½\r\n    seconds. The second shock was rotatory; the pendulum swinging\r\n    north and south from the first shock, began and continued to\r\n    describe a short oval or nearly a circle from the effects of\r\n    the second shock, and continued thus for more than half an\r\n    hour, until stopped and brought to rest. Magnetism was not\r\n    suspended in this earthquake, nor any other that has occurred\r\n    since my instrument was suspended. These observations were made\r\n    at the height of twenty feet four inches from the ground. The\r\n    total of time included in the shock was nearly five seconds.\r\n    The farthest point south to which I have been able to trace\r\n    its effects is the Mission San Juan, and north to Sacramento,\r\n    a distance inclusive of 177 miles. In an easterly direction\r\n    we have not traced it east of Stockton, about 60 miles. It\r\n    was felt at Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Gilroys, south of San\r\n    Francisco, and at Santa Rosa and Petaluma to the north.\r\n\r\n    Since the above was in type, advices have been received from\r\n    Visalia. At that locality the shock was very smart. The first\r\n    shock took place at 8h. 45m. M., being four minutes earlier\r\n    than that at San Francisco. This gives for the entire distance,\r\n    north and south (over which the earthquake extended), 257\r\n    miles. This extent of latitude, and the almost simultaneous\r\n    period of time at which it was observed along the entire line\r\n    of distance so far as heard from, leads to the conclusion that\r\n    its probable centre was south of San Francisco and nearly in\r\n    the same longitude. From the violence of its action I feel\r\n    inclined to the belief that its centre was in the neighborhood\r\n    of San José, for all accounts agree in this one point, that\r\n    more turbulence of the earth’s surface occurred in this region\r\n    during its continuance than at any other place yet known. At\r\n    Visalia the first shock was a mere tremor, but was followed by\r\n    an undulatory movement when the second shock occurred, which\r\n    was some three or four seconds later. This wave moved in an\r\n    east and west direction at that place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 21ST, 1864.\r\n\r\nDr. Trask in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs.

TRASK.\r\n\r\n    As the subject of earthquakes for some years past has engrossed\r\n    much of the attention of scientific observers, I have, at the\r\n    request of several members of the Academy, made out a complete\r\n    report upon the occurrence of those phenomena upon this coast,\r\n    as far as personal observation is concerned, and also so far\r\n    only as we have authentic records prior to the occupancy of the\r\n    present State of California by the American Government.\r\n\r\n    The present paper contains, probably, all that can be verified,\r\n    and places the subject in a form to which future reference\r\n    may be made by other observers abroad; thus enabling them and\r\n    ourselves also, to bring together the statistical facts which,\r\n    it may be hoped, will help to form some rational theory in\r\n    future years relating to the causal agency of those phenomena,\r\n    as well as the physical laws governing their action.\r\n\r\n    In this paper I have reduced the periods of their occurrence\r\n    for the thirteen years past to astronomical time, in all\r\n    instances where the hour on which the shocks occurred have been\r\n    known with certainty, and, without attempting to combat any\r\n    theory that has been advanced, or the suggestion of another\r\n    relating to their origin, their history has been left as a\r\n    record of facts, which will become useful when others of like\r\n    character accompany them. Our record, in this State alone has\r\n    reached a little more than one-tenth of the number on which M.\r\n    Mallet has founded his theory of their origin, and which were\r\n    drawn from all parts of the world, and although this may seem a\r\n    large proportion for this district of country alone since 1850,\r\n    it is not to be presumed that a greater frequency of shocks\r\n    have occurred here than elsewhere, but that the same attention\r\n    has not been bestowed in recording their occurrence in other\r\n    countries where they are known to be much more frequent and\r\n    severe than upon our coast.\r\n\r\n    It might be asked why, if such unquestionable frequency\r\n    occurs within the limits of this State we are not subject\r\n    to momentary destruction from their effects; the answer to\r\n    this is found in the preceding paragraph, from which cause it\r\n    will be seen that our experience is more apparent than real,\r\n    relatively, and farther still, we should find a much greater\r\n    frequency of shocks, beyond all doubt, if the instruments\r\n    for their registry in different parts of the State were more\r\n    plentiful than at present.\r\n\r\n    There is no good reason for the supposition that we are in more\r\n    danger from these phenomena than upon the Atlantic border,\r\n    for the reason that we are so far removed from the centers of\r\n    immediate and violent volcanic action, that it would require\r\n    dangerous tension of the imagination to place California within\r\n    the range of those physical causes which are so conducive to\r\n    violent, repeated, and destructive earthquakes. This State\r\n    cannot be considered more subject to earthquakes than it is to\r\n    volcanoes, relatively, and this is said too in the face of our\r\n    own records relating to the former. We need have little fear\r\n    from these disturbances so long as we are so far removed on\r\n    either hand from the great centers, and even from the terminal\r\n    points of those centers of volcanic disturbance, from the\r\n    action of which such disastrous consequences have, and will\r\n    again follow to their immediate districts.\r\n\r\n    A moment’s consideration will convince the most sceptical of\r\n    the prevailing fallacy relating to this subject. In the first\r\n    place, we are situated between two great termini of active\r\n    volcanic ranges, the nearest being Colima, 1,200 miles south,\r\n    the other on the coast of Alaska, more than 1,300 miles to the\r\n    north; the distance inclusive between the points being nearly\r\n    or perhaps quite 2,600 miles, in which NO active volcanic vents\r\n    abound, unless we make an exception of Mounts Hood and St.\r\n    Helen in Oregon, of which the testimony is somewhat dubious,\r\n    and the nearest of which is 700 miles. To the east there are no\r\n    volcanoes for a distance of 2,500 miles, and to the west for a\r\n    much greater distance than in either of the other directions.\r\n    This, certainly, should be sufficient to palliate the fears of\r\n    the timid, in some degree at least, and to silence in part also\r\n    the sensational articles which appear from time to time in the\r\n    press of this and the eastern States, as to California being an\r\n    oven within the range of active volcanic action, and a volcanic\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    In preparing this paper I have endeavored to obtain, as far as\r\n    possible, the most correct information relating to the history\r\n    of these phenomena in former years. It is my desire also to\r\n    correct some of the misrepresentations and statements current\r\n    relating to the severity of earthquake shocks in this country\r\n    during the earlier periods of its history.\r\n\r\n    I have at the present time some additional information relating\r\n    to the great earthquake of 1812, which did not appear in my\r\n    first paper on this subject, and which must now be placed on\r\n    record. These facts relate more to the phenomena occurring\r\n    during that year, rather than to the destruction of the\r\n    missions, all of which will be found in their proper place\r\n    below.\r\n\r\n    From careful inquiry of the early settlers and residents I\r\n    cannot learn that any more than one earthquake has occurred\r\n    which was in any considerable degree of a serious character,\r\n    and but one which has caused the destruction of either life or\r\n    property to any extent.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake occurred in the month of September, 1812, and\r\n    destroyed the Mission San Juan Capistrano, in Los Angeles\r\n    County, and the Mission Purissima (Viejo) in the County of\r\n    Santa Barbara. The following is the history of that event\r\n    as obtained from the older native inhabitants and foreign\r\n    residents on the coast at that time.\r\n\r\n    The day was clear and uncommonly warm; it being Sunday the\r\n    people had assembled at San Juan Capistrano for evening\r\n    service. About half an hour after the opening of service,\r\n    an unusual loud, but distant rushing sound was heard in the\r\n    atmosphere to the east and also over the water, which resembled\r\n    the sound of strong wind, but as it approached no perceptible\r\n    breeze accompanied it. _The sea was smooth and the air was\r\n    calm._ So distant and loud was this atmospheric sound that\r\n    several left the building attracted by its noise.\r\n\r\n    Immediately following the sound, the first and heaviest shock\r\n    of the earthquake occurred, which was sufficiently severe\r\n    to prostrate the Mission Church of San Capistrano almost in\r\n    a body, burying in its ruins the most of those who remained\r\n    behind, after the first indication of its approach was heard.\r\n\r\n    The shock was very sudden and almost without warning, save from\r\n    the rushing sound above noted, and to the severity of the first\r\n    shock at that moment is to be attributed the loss of life that\r\n    followed.\r\n\r\n    The number reported to have been killed outright, is variously\r\n    estimated from thirty to forty-five (the largest number of\r\n    persons agree on the smallest number of deaths given), but\r\n    in the absence of records such statements should be received\r\n    with many grains of allowance, where memory alone is the only\r\n    means left, and the term of forty-three years has elapsed\r\n    before the period at which this account was placed on paper. A\r\n    considerable number are reported to have been badly injured.\r\n\r\n    There is a universal agreement on this point with those from\r\n    whom these facts were derived, viz.: _that the first shock\r\n    threw down the entire building, and that a large number of\r\n    persons were in it at that moment_, and under the circumstances\r\n    it would be most singular if no deaths were caused by such an\r\n    event.\r\n\r\n    It is now nine years since the above facts were published,\r\n    and in March, 1864, a writer to me unknown, corroborates this\r\n    statement relating to that Mission in these words. “The church\r\n    thrown down at San Juan Capistrano by an earthquake in 1812,\r\n    was a well built-affair of stone and cement. The cupola or\r\n    short steeple falling over the church completely destroying the\r\n    building.”\r\n\r\n    The motion of the earth is described as having _lifted\r\n    vertically_, attended by a rotatory movement. _No undulatory_\r\n    motion is described by any one. Dizziness and _nausea_ seized\r\n    almost every person in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n    A heavy, loud, deep rumbling, accompanied the successive shocks\r\n    that followed, which were five in number, all having the motion\r\n    above described, though comparatively light in their effects to\r\n    the first. The sounds attending the phenomena came apparently\r\n    from the South and East.\r\n\r\n    In the valley of San Inez, to the south and west of Santa\r\n    Barbara, the church now known as the “Mission Viejo” (La\r\n    Purissima), was also completely destroyed. At this locality\r\n    there were also a number of lives lost, but what number is as\r\n    yet very uncertain. The distance between Capistrano and San\r\n    Inez is about one hundred and seventy miles. The shock which\r\n    destroyed this building occurred about one hour after the\r\n    former, and the greater portion of the inhabitants had left\r\n    the building but a few minutes before it fell, service having\r\n    closed. The first shock felt here prostrated the building, as\r\n    in the preceding case.\r\n\r\n    A Spanish ship which lay at anchor off San Buenaventura,\r\n    thirty-eight miles from Santa Barbara, was much injured by the\r\n    shock, and leaked to that extent, that it became necessary to\r\n    beach her, and remove the most of her cargo.\r\n\r\n    The writer above quoted corroborates the fact of a ship having\r\n    been in this vicinity at the time. The distance of this ship\r\n    from Santa Barbara is nearly the same as in my original\r\n    statement but in a different direction. From the circumstantial\r\n    details of the writer as to the ship “Charan,” _alias_, “Thomas\r\n    Newland,” I am inclined to the belief that his statements are\r\n    more entitled to adoption than my own; I therefore present his\r\n    statement also and leave the reader to adopt either, so far as\r\n    regards the ship and her position. “At the same time a Boston\r\n    ship the Thomas Newland, known before as the Charan, commanded\r\n    by Capt. Isaac Whitmore, was lying off the anchorage not far\r\n    from the Gaviota Pass, Santa Barbara County.”\r\n\r\n    It is an interesting fact, and at the same time somewhat\r\n    remarkable, that the time which elapsed between the advent of\r\n    the shocks at Capistrano and San Inez is widely variant from\r\n    what we should look for, when the distance apart and velocity\r\n    of motion in earthquakes are taken into consideration. If the\r\n    velocity of the seismic wave in this earthquake was uniform\r\n    with those of more recent times, it should have reached La\r\n    Purissima in twenty-eight minutes and fifty seconds in lieu of\r\n    an hour; but all due allowances must be made for a question of\r\n    time in an event of this nature, and also for errors in memory\r\n    of persons after the lapse of so many years.\r\n\r\n    The effect of this earthquake on the sea, in the Bay of Santa\r\n    Barbara, is described as follows: “The sea was observed to\r\n    recede from the shore during the continuance of the shocks,\r\n    and left the latter dry for a considerable distance, when it\r\n    returned in five or six heavy rollers, which overflowed the\r\n    plain on which Santa Barbara is built. The inhabitants saw the\r\n    recession of the sea, and being aware of the danger on its\r\n    return, fled to the adjoining hills near the town to escape the\r\n    probable deluge.”\r\n\r\n    The sea on its return flowed inland a little more than half a\r\n    mile, and reached the lower part of the town, doing but little\r\n    damage, destroying only three small adobe buildings.\r\n\r\n    Here again I take the liberty of quoting the late writer above\r\n    noticed, in corroboration of its effects upon the sea. “The sea\r\n    was seen to retire all at once, and to return in an immense\r\n    wave, which came roaring and plunging back, over the beach.\r\n    This wave penetrated the low lands and gulches a mile from the\r\n    shore, forming one of the most terrific sights possible to\r\n    conceive.”\r\n\r\n    Very little damage was done to the houses in town from the\r\n    effects of the shocks, while the Mission at San Inez was\r\n    prostrated almost instantly. There is no evidence that I can\r\n    find, that this earthquake was felt in San Luis Obispo, though\r\n    such has been the report.\r\n\r\n    In addition to my former paper I will now add some information\r\n    relating to this and other earthquakes, touching more\r\n    particularly a series continuing through a long period for such\r\n    phenomena, but preceding the great event of September of that\r\n    year.\r\n\r\n    So far as the archives of the old missions assist us, it is\r\n    found that from the foundation of the first mission in 1769, up\r\n    to the year 1800, a period of thirty-one years, not an entry\r\n    was made of these phenomena. In the latter year an earthquake\r\n    is recorded as occurring at San Juan Bautista, on the eleventh\r\n    of October. On the eighteenth of the same month, at supper\r\n    time another shock was felt, and another still at about eleven\r\n    o’clock on the same night. From the records of the Presidio\r\n    of San Francisco, we are able to glean the fact, that between\r\n    the twenty-first of June and seventeenth of July, 1808, there\r\n    occurred twenty-one shocks of earthquakes at this post.\r\n\r\n    I will here correct the popular error relating to this\r\n    earthquake or series of earthquakes during that year. It\r\n    is generally stated that this was contemporaneous with\r\n    the earthquake which destroyed San Juan Capistrano and La\r\n    Purissima; by reference to the dates it will be seen that the\r\n    destruction of those missions did not occur until four years\r\n    later.\r\n\r\n    The above are the only records of these phenomena that have\r\n    as yet made their appearance in the archives of the province\r\n    during the existence of the Mexican Government; and, from the\r\n    fact that these archives are all in our possession, there is no\r\n    hazard in stating that they constitute all, of which we have\r\n    any positive knowledge. As they stand, they are a sufficient\r\n    rebuke to the mendacity of sensational itemizers of the public\r\n    press; they will find in those records, no basis on which to\r\n    indite column articles of such doleful prophecies as the public\r\n    of late have been surfeited with.\r\n\r\n    During a period of thirty-nine years the records of the country\r\n    exhibit the fact, that there were but twenty-three days on\r\n    which earthquakes occurred and were deemed worthy of record.\r\n    If we compare these figures with those recorded from 1850 to\r\n    the close of 1863, we shall find much more ground for prophecy\r\n    during the latter period than for the eighty-two years of which\r\n    records were kept on this coast previous to that time.\r\n\r\n    From the above extracts from the archives we are left to infer\r\n    one of two facts; either that earthquakes were entirely unknown\r\n    during the intervals of the record dates, or that they were of\r\n    so trivial a character as not to merit the notice of the early\r\n    padres during this time; the latter is the probability, for we\r\n    can scarcely conceive that nothing of this nature had taken\r\n    place. If, however, such be the fact, it cannot be looked upon\r\n    in any other light than a manifest anomaly in the history of\r\n    this or any other country.\r\n\r\n    It appears from all the testimony on the subject, that in May,\r\n    1812, the south part of the State was frequently agitated with\r\n    shocks of greater or less severity, and their continuance was\r\n    literally incessant for about four and one-half months. Their\r\n    frequency was not less than one each day or two; four days\r\n    seldom elapsing without a shock. As many as thirty shocks\r\n    occurred in a single day on more than one occasion. So frequent\r\n    were they, that the inhabitants abandoned their houses for the\r\n    greater part of this period, and lived under trees, etc., and\r\n    slept out of doors at Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\n    This period of time seems analogous in some respects to the\r\n    year 1852, and was one of very marked severity on this coast,\r\n    as was also the latter year; it was analogous to other periods\r\n    of subterranean disturbance in other parts of the earth since\r\n    the historic era began, and there is no good reason why we may\r\n    not look for the recurrence of similar events in future time.\r\n    But we must not lay too much stress on the destruction of the\r\n    two mission churches in 1812, to guide us in an estimate of\r\n    the force of this earthquake, for the construction of those\r\n    buildings had but little relation to similar structures of\r\n    modern date, either in strength or material.\r\n\r\n    From 1812 to 1850, the archives are silent on this subject. In\r\n    the latter year our record began and has continued with little\r\n    interruption to 1863, a period of thirteen years. Within that\r\n    period there are but few earthquakes occurring north of the\r\n    thirty-ninth parallel which have escaped notice and have not\r\n    been made matter of record.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1850.\r\n\r\n    During this year the following earthquakes were recorded:\r\n\r\n    March 12th.—A light shock was felt in San José.\r\n\r\n    May 13th.—A light shock in San Francisco. An eruption of Mauna\r\n    Loa, S. I., and shock same day.\r\n\r\n    June 28th.—A light shock in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    August 4th.—A smart shock was felt in Stockton and Sacramento.\r\n\r\n    September 14th.—Smart shock at San Francisco and San José.\r\n    Total number recorded in 1850, five.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1851.\r\n\r\n    May 15th.—Three severe shocks in San Francisco. During this\r\n    earthquake windows were broken and buildings severely shaken.\r\n    A large amount of merchandize was thrown down in a store on\r\n    California Street. The shipping in the harbor rolled heavily.\r\n    An eruption of Mauna Loa and shock in the Sandwich Islands same\r\n    day.\r\n\r\n    May 17th.—A light shock in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    May 28th.—A light shock on the Salinas.\r\n\r\n    June 13th.—A smart shock at San Francisco. This was felt at San\r\n    Luis Obispo and San Fernando.\r\n\r\n    December 2d.—A shock at Downieville.\r\n\r\n    December 31st.—A smart shock at Downieville. Total recorded in\r\n    1851, six.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1852.\r\n\r\n    From the beginning of this year until the middle of its last\r\n    quarter, no disturbances of the coast was noted until the month\r\n    of November. In this month the southern portion of the State\r\n    was violently disturbed.\r\n\r\n    November 26th.—The number of shocks on this day at San Simeon\r\n    was eleven, and at Los Angeles and San Gabriel the same number.\r\n    Nearly or quite the same number was also observed by parties\r\n    having in charge a Government train in transit from Fort Yuma\r\n    to San Diego.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake or the series was experienced over the entire\r\n    country, east and south of Luis Obispo to San Diego and the\r\n    Colorado River, covering a line of country about three hundred\r\n    miles in extent.\r\n\r\n    From subsequent accounts we learn that it also reached as far\r\n    as Guaymas, in the province of Sonora, Mexico.\r\n\r\n    For a period of six days subsequent to the twenty-sixth of\r\n    November, the whole of this region to the Colorado, was\r\n    convulsed, with slight intermissions. During this time a _mud\r\n    volcano_ opened on the Colorado Desert, and another south of\r\n    the river; one of these was visited by a portion of the United\r\n    States command under Col. Hientzelman.\r\n\r\n    December 17th.—Two smart shocks at San Luis Obispo, which\r\n    fractured the walls of two adobe buildings, and threw down a\r\n    part of the wall of a house belonging to, and occupied by Don\r\n    Jesus Pico and family.\r\n\r\n    During the months of November and December, the southern\r\n    particularly, and middle portions of California were much\r\n    disturbed; shocks were experienced in those sections for\r\n    sixty-five days, with variable intermissions; they were noticed\r\n    as far north as the thirty-seventh parallel, but generally\r\n    light in their nature. The latest date of this series was to\r\n    the fifth of January, 1853, on the valley of the San Joaquin.\r\n\r\n    The period of time inclusive between the sixteenth of November\r\n    (the date of the terrible earthquake at Banda Neira in the\r\n    Moluccas), and the twenty-sixth of January, 1853, must be\r\n    regarded as one of the most remarkable and portentious periods\r\n    of the earth’s history during modern times. For in that period\r\n    a greater proportion of the earth’s surface was convulsed by\r\n    subterranean forces than has been known for many scores of\r\n    years, in the same length of time.\r\n\r\n    The area most severely affected by these phenomena is included\r\n    between the parallels of forty degrees south latitude and\r\n    thirty-seven degrees north latitude, and extending from one\r\n    hundred and twenty degrees east to the forty-fifth degree\r\n    west longitude, being nearly equal to three-fifths of the\r\n    equatorial, and a little more than one-half the polar\r\n    circumference of the earth.\r\n\r\n    At this time the coast of eastern Asia, the Islands of the\r\n    South Indian Ocean, Singapore, the fated Moluccas, the east\r\n    coast of China, the north, east, and south coasts of Australia,\r\n    the coast of California, Mexico (west coast,) South America,\r\n    with portions of the Atlantic coast of the United States\r\n    south of the thirty-fourth parallel, north latitude, shared\r\n    in the general disturbance which prevailed on our own shores\r\n    during this time. With the twenty-sixth of January ceased the\r\n    vibrations on this coast at that time, but we have positive\r\n    intelligence that they continued much later on the east coast\r\n    of China and Australia, in which countries they did not\r\n    cease until the month of February. With these facts before\r\n    us we cannot but believe the period included one of the most\r\n    turbulent in the earth’s career during modern times.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1853.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 2d.—A shock of earthquake was felt in Mariposa; this was\r\n    observed in San Francisco, Bodega, and at Shasta City.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 5th.—A shock at Corte Madeira.\r\n\r\n    Feb. 14th.—A light shock at San Luis Obispo.\r\n\r\n    March 1st.—A smart shock at San Francisco, which was felt at\r\n    San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\n    April 24th.—A light shock at Humboldt Bay.\r\n\r\n    April 25th.—Three shocks in quick succession at Weaverville,\r\n    Trinity County.\r\n\r\n    June 2d.—Two smart shocks on the plains of the San Joaquin.\r\n\r\n    July 12th.—A light shock at Yreka, Siskiyou County.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 3d.—Four shocks on the Salinas and San Joaquin Plains.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 23d.—Three heavy shocks at Humboldt Bay.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 25th.—A light shock at Humboldt Bay.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 16th.—A light shock at San José.\r\n\r\n    Nov. 21st.—A shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 11th.—A light shock at San Francisco and Mission Dolores.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 23d.—A light shock at Shasta.\r\n\r\n    Total in 1853, 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1854.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 3d.—Two smart shocks in Mariposa, felt also in Shasta.\r\n\r\n    March 2d.—A light shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    March 20th.—A shock at Stockton.\r\n\r\n    April 29th.—A light shock at Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\n    May 23d.—A shock at Crescent City.\r\n\r\n    May 31st.—An earthquake at Santa Barbara at 5h. 10m. In this\r\n    earthquake there were three distinct waves. The first was\r\n    accompanied by profound rumbling; the second shock was preceded\r\n    by a loud, rushing noise like the approach of a strong wind.\r\n    About four or five seconds elapsed between each shock. The sea\r\n    was much disturbed, and a heavy surf swell came in soon after\r\n    the second shock passed. This surf-wave rolled inland some\r\n    thirty feet beyond the old wreck at the embarcadero. I saw the\r\n    effect of this wave in July following. The inhabitants were\r\n    much frightened and left their beds for the open air. Very\r\n    little damage was sustained.\r\n\r\n    June 26th.—Two light shocks in Placer County.\r\n\r\n    July 10th.—One shock at Georgetown.\r\n\r\n    July 14th.—A shock at Georgetown.\r\n\r\n    Sept. 14th.—A light shock at Nevada.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 21st.—A light shock at Monterey.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 26th.—A smart shock at San Francisco, near midnight. It\r\n    was felt at Benicia. This shock was followed by a swell in the\r\n    bay, as vessels at the wharfs swayed heavily on their hawsers.\r\n\r\n    Total in 1854, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1855.\r\n\r\n    The following is the record of earthquakes for this year, in\r\n    the State of California, with the date and hour of the day at\r\n    which they were observed:\r\n\r\n    Jan. 13th, 18h. 30m.—A smart shock occurred at San Benito and\r\n    San Miguel. It was felt at San Luis Obispo.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 24th, 22h.—A heavy shock of earthquake was felt at\r\n    Downieville, which lasted seven seconds.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake was quite severe at Gibsonville on the north,\r\n    at Forrest City, Minnesota, in Sierra County, and at Orleans\r\n    Flat, Eureka, in Nevada County, at Georgetown and Nashville\r\n    in El Dorado County on the south, and at Keystone Ranch,\r\n    in Yuba County, on the west. The entire distance north and\r\n    south affected was ninety-four miles, and in a westerly line,\r\n    thirty miles. The shock was preceded by a deep rumbling, and\r\n    the rushing sound of wind in the distance. It shook buildings\r\n    severely. A large pinnacle of rocks on the summit of the\r\n    Downieville Buttes was thrown down, and some of the large\r\n    fragments reached the south branch of the North Yuba, at the\r\n    base of the mountain.\r\n\r\n    Feb 5th, 22h.—A light shock was felt at Wolf Creek and the\r\n    north-east part of Nevada County.\r\n\r\n    April 7th, 18h.—A light shock was felt at Gibb’s Ferry, Trinity\r\n    County, and was experienced as far north as Callahan’s Ranch,\r\n    at the head of Scott’s Valley, Siskiyou County.\r\n\r\n    June 25th, 14h.—A smart shock was felt at Santa Barbara, and\r\n    extended northward as far as the valley of Santa Maria. This\r\n    shock was cotemporaneous with one that occurred in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n    July 10th, 9h. 30m.—A light shock was felt in Georgetown, El\r\n    Dorado County, which lasted about four seconds.\r\n\r\n    July 10th, 20h. 15m.—A severe shock at Los Angeles, which did\r\n    considerable damage.\r\n\r\n    There were four distinct shocks during the earthquake, with\r\n    a period of about two or three seconds elapsing between each\r\n    vibration. During their continuance the ground opened in\r\n    several places, in fissures of one or two inches, the marks of\r\n    which remained for several days afterwards. There were some\r\n    twenty-six buildings in the city more or less injured, which\r\n    I personally examined, and among them the church, the west\r\n    wall of which was split from top to bottom in two places, the\r\n    fissures being from one to two and a half inches in breadth,\r\n    running entirely through. The east wall split at a slight angle\r\n    from the perpendicular, and had but one fissure. The walls of\r\n    the Star Hotel were split in several places, and on the west\r\n    side there appears to have been a decided horizontal motion,\r\n    as the wall was displaced on that side horizontally to the\r\n    depth of about one inch, and some eight or nine feet in length.\r\n    The amount of displacement decreased from the west end of the\r\n    building towards the center. It is a fact worthy of note,\r\n    that none of the _thin_ adobe walls of the buildings suffered\r\n    injury, while most of the _thick_-walled buildings were injured\r\n    to a greater or less extent.\r\n\r\n    During the earthquake, many articles were thrown down; those\r\n    that were standing on shelves against the east end of the\r\n    buildings were thrown westward on to the floor, and those\r\n    on the opposite end of the buildings were thrown back in an\r\n    inclined position against the walls. These features were\r\n    noticed in the drug stores of Doctors Winston and Hope,\r\n    situated on the main street, and a short distance west of the\r\n    church.\r\n\r\n    The meteorological condition of the atmosphere was rather\r\n    unusual, and is described as follows: The day was unusually\r\n    warm and sultry, attended with a little rain, (the latter very\r\n    unusual) and a sudden change of temperature to unpleasant\r\n    coldness. At Point San Juan there was observed considerable\r\n    commotion in the water, attended with a strong rushing sound,\r\n    and two unusually heavy surf swells, immediately _following the\r\n    last shock_.\r\n\r\n    This shock was felt distinctly at the saw-mill, some eight\r\n    miles east of San Bernardino, about seventy miles east of Los\r\n    Angeles, and at Santa Barbara, about one hundred miles in a\r\n    westerly direction.\r\n\r\n    Aug 12th, 9h. 30m.—A light shock of an earthquake was felt at\r\n    Georgetown, which lasted about three seconds. The vibration\r\n    apparently came from the north. Between this date and the tenth\r\n    July there were four other light shocks, the dates of which are\r\n    not recorded.\r\n\r\n    Oct. 21st, 19h. 45m.—A smart shock of an earthquake was felt\r\n    in San Francisco. The buildings situated over the water were\r\n    violently shaken. There was much commotion in the water of the\r\n    harbor a few minutes preceding the shock, which caused several\r\n    vessels to heave heavily at their hawsers and cables.\r\n\r\n    Oct 27th, 15h.—A light shock was felt in the valley of Clear\r\n    Lake. On the same day a shock was felt at Downieville, which\r\n    lasted about five seconds. At Goodyear’s Bar it was more severe\r\n    than at the preceding locality.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 5th, 11h. 20m.—The shock of an earthquake was felt at\r\n    Humboldt Bay, which lasted about three seconds. There were two\r\n    vibrations, the last being the most severe.\r\n\r\n    Dec. 11th, 4h.—A shock was felt in San Francisco and at the\r\n    Mission Dolores; at the latter place it is represented as being\r\n    quite severe.\r\n\r\n    The whole number of which I have a record for 1855, amounts\r\n    to twelve only; but there may be others which have escaped my\r\n    notice on account of absence from the city.\r\n\r\n    The following table will show the number of shocks for each\r\n    year, and each month of the year, for six years from 1850 to\r\n    1855, inclusive.\r\n\r\n    ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |No. for\r\n                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |each\r\n                    |1850 |1851 |1852 |1853 |1854 |1855 |month\r\n                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |in six\r\n                    |     |     |     |     |     |     |years.\r\n    ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n    January,        |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2  |  1  |  2  |   5\r\n    February,       |  —  |  —  |  —  |  1  |  —  |  1  |   2\r\n    March,          |  1  |  —  |  —  |  1  |  2  |  —  |   4\r\n    April,          |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2  |  1  |  1  |   4\r\n    May,            |  1  |  3  |  —  |  —  |  2  |  —  |   6\r\n    June,           |  1  |  1  |  —  |  1  |  1  |  1  |   5\r\n    July,           |  —  |  —  |  —  |  1  |  2  |  1  |   3\r\n    August,         |  1  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  1  |   2\r\n    September,      |  1  |  —  |  —  |  1  |  1  |  —  |   3\r\n    October,        |  —  |  —  |  —  |  2  |  2  |  2  |   6\r\n    November,       |  —  |  —  | 11  |  2  |  —  |  —  |  13\r\n    December,       |  —  |  2  |  1  |  2  |  —  |  2  |   8\r\n    ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n    Total each year,|  5  |  6  | 12  | 14  | 12  | 11  |= 59\r\n    ----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------\r\n\r\n    From the above it will be seen that of the total number of\r\n    shocks in six years in this State, forty-eight have occurred\r\n    during the spring, summer, and autumn months, and eleven during\r\n    the winter months.\r\n\r\n    Of the total number noted, twenty-seven have occurred from San\r\n    Luis Obispo south, and of the thirty-two remaining, nine have\r\n    been felt in San Francisco at the same time they were observed\r\n    at San Luis Obispo, while the remaining twenty-three were felt\r\n    at San Francisco and north of that point.\r\n\r\n    Notwithstanding we have had, what may, perhaps, be considered\r\n    a frequency in the recurrence of these phenomena, still there\r\n    are but a _very few_ of the total number that would merit a\r\n    moment’s consideration south of the twenty-fifth parallel of\r\n    north latitude, for there they would be regarded as minor\r\n    affairs entirely.\r\n\r\n    From all the facts in our possession relating to the phenomena\r\n    on our coast, it appears that the greatest preponderance in\r\n    action and severity of effects, is exerted, for the most part,\r\n    south of Point Conception, for, from this place, east, south\r\n    and north, to near the Colorado, the most conclusive evidence\r\n    exists of very recent volcanic action having been exerted on\r\n    rather an extensive scale, and is also still persistent in\r\n    several localities within the area named, though in a minor\r\n    degree.\r\n\r\n    It would be interesting to examine the changes of level that\r\n    have evidently taken place in this State within the last five\r\n    years; but as more extended observations would greatly assist\r\n    us in forming conclusions on this subject, I will defer that\r\n    portion until a future day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1856.\r\n\r\n    At the close of 1855, I presented to the Academy a statement of\r\n    the occurrence of earthquakes in this State for that year and a\r\n    term of years preceding.\r\n\r\n    During the year just passed, I have kept a careful record\r\n    of these phenomena, which have been noticed in this city,\r\n    and other parts of the State, and which will be found below,\r\n    with their date, and the hour of the day on which they took\r\n    place; they comprise all that have occurred, with perhaps two\r\n    exceptions, the dates for which were so obscure as to render\r\n    it impossible to determine with accuracy the precise period\r\n    of their occurrence. So far as I am informed, those shocks\r\n    that have taken place in this State during the past year have\r\n    not been marked with more severity than has been usual in\r\n    years preceding, frequently amounting to a slight tremor, and\r\n    at other times to more distinct movements; three only have\r\n    possessed sufficient intensity as to command general attention\r\n    during the busy hours of day.\r\n\r\n    Very few have been noticed by persons who were standing upon\r\n    the earth at the period of their occurrence. By far the greater\r\n    proportion were observed in high situations from the ground,\r\n    and in the more retired parts of the city, or on the alluvial\r\n    covering of the country to the west and south.\r\n\r\n    The total number for the past year is sixteen, and of this\r\n    number thirteen were observed between sunset and sunrise.\r\n\r\n    By reference to the statistics below, it will be seen that even\r\n    mountain districts, where during the day there is much less of\r\n    turmoil and noise arising from business than in the populous\r\n    city, that of all those noticed, none have been of sufficient\r\n    intensity to attract the attention of the inhabitants during\r\n    the hours of daylight. These facts, though few in themselves,\r\n    are of importance, to disabuse the public mind in relation\r\n    to the danger to be apprehended from the occurrence of these\r\n    phenomena. The character which we sustain both at home and\r\n    abroad, as being in constant danger of being swallowed up\r\n    by these occurrences, and that our country is but a bed of\r\n    latent volcanoes ready to burst forth at any moment, spreading\r\n    devastation over the land, is one of the greatest fallacies\r\n    that ever obtained possession of the human brain. Our State is\r\n    as primitive as Massachusetts or New Hampshire, and the dangers\r\n    that surround us from the sources above mentioned, are equally\r\n    great as in the States just named.\r\n\r\n    We should remember that when speaking of California as a\r\n    State, that we include a line of territory equaling that of\r\n    the seaboard lying between Cape Hatteras on the south and the\r\n    British Possessions on the north, and including eleven of the\r\n    seaboard States of the Union; and when we place our comparative\r\n    estimates on this basis in matters of this character, it will\r\n    become at once evident that the danger of annihilation from the\r\n    causes under consideration, are not of that magnitude which at\r\n    first sight would appear.\r\n\r\n    Along the coast of Mexico and Central America, to the south\r\n    of California from all the records that are obtainable here\r\n    there appears to have been a much greater exemption from those\r\n    phenomena than has been usual in former years; this seems to\r\n    have been the fact, also, throughout the Pacific, Oceanic, and\r\n    most of the Continental Islands along the coast of China, while\r\n    to the north and north-west, beyond the fifty-fifth parallel,\r\n    both volcanic and earthquake phenomena appear to have been\r\n    greater than usual. This has been observable, for the most\r\n    part, in the neighborhood of the Aleutian Archipelago, along\r\n    the north-east coast of Japan, and in the British and Russian\r\n    Possessions of North America on the Pacific, and islands of the\r\n    Ochotsk Sea.\r\n\r\n    It would be interesting to know more of the predominance of\r\n    these phenomena in those regions, and such information could be\r\n    easily obtained from the commanders of the whaling fleet, if\r\n    the proper measures were adopted to secure it.\r\n\r\n    Below will be found some interesting matter upon this subject,\r\n    which took place during the past year near the Straits of\r\n    Ourinach.\r\n\r\n    The earthquakes which have occurred in this State during 1856,\r\n    and the period of their occurrence, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    January 2d, 10h. 15m.—This morning, a smart shock of an\r\n    earthquake was felt in San Francisco. The motion of the earth\r\n    was undulatory, and came apparently from the northward. A\r\n    pendulum indicated a motion of about five and a half inches.\r\n\r\n    January 21st, 16h.—Quite a smart shock occurred; it was quite\r\n    sharp in the south-west part of the city.\r\n\r\n    January 28th, 3h.—At the town of Petaluma, Sonoma County, a\r\n    shock of an earthquake occurred. It was sufficiently heavy to\r\n    awake persons from their sleep.\r\n\r\n    January 29th, 0h. 45m.—A slight shock was felt in San\r\n    Francisco. It was observed also at the Mission Dolores. There\r\n    were three distinct tremors, with short intervals elapsing\r\n    between. The motion was apparently from the westward.\r\n\r\n    February 15th, 5h. 25m.—A severe shock of an earthquake was\r\n    felt in San Francisco, the duration of which was about eight\r\n    seconds. Persons sleeping were aroused, and many persons left\r\n    their beds and sought the street. There were two distinct\r\n    shocks, the second very light and scarcely perceptible. The\r\n    motion was _undulatory_ and _vertical_, and at the end of the\r\n    first shock a very strong, profound jar, with which it ceased.\r\n\r\n    The upper part of a building on Battery Street, for seventy\r\n    feet in length, was thrown down, the whole of which was above\r\n    the cornice, very thin, and the mortar with which it was\r\n    constructed had not become hardened, being easily removed by\r\n    the fingers—it more resembled wet sand than a firm mortar.\r\n\r\n    There appears to have been but little difference in the\r\n    sensation of persons situated either in upper or basement\r\n    stories.\r\n\r\n    It was preceded by a deep, heavy rumbling, and the motion\r\n    apparently came from the north-west. A distinct shock was felt\r\n    at eight minutes past two o’clock the same morning, by persons\r\n    who were awake and up at the time.\r\n\r\n    The rotatory movement was shown in the fact that small square\r\n    bottles and boxes that stood upon a line, were moved from their\r\n    position horizontally, describing an arc of thirty degrees and\r\n    upwards, as shown by the dust upon the shelves on which they\r\n    stood.\r\n\r\n    The first wave came with a force sufficient to project small\r\n    articles three or four feet on the floor, from shelves on which\r\n    they were placed; they were apparently all thrown in the same\r\n    direction. Several clocks were stopped at precisely 5 hours 25\r\n    minutes.\r\n\r\n    All the cracks in walls and ceilings had a direction nearly\r\n    north-west and south-east, and most of them had the appearance\r\n    of having been produced at the moment of elevation.\r\n\r\n    The earthquake was felt heavily at Monterey, at five hours\r\n    twenty minutes; it was also felt at Bodega, but no time is\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n    The vessels on the coast, and ranging from San Pedro on the\r\n    south to Southern Oregon, and at distances varying from eight\r\n    to one hundred miles from land, did not experience any shock.\r\n    They were twenty-two in number.\r\n\r\n    Up to the present date the most northern point of which we have\r\n    any record of its having been felt, is at Santa Rosa, which\r\n    is fifty-three miles north of San Francisco, and at Monterey,\r\n    ninety miles south of the latter place; to the east of this\r\n    city we have no record beyond Stockton. This would give for\r\n    its length one hundred and forty-three miles, and its breadth\r\n    sixty-six miles.\r\n\r\n    Inquiry was made through the State line Telegraph at El Dorado,\r\n    Nevada, Downieville, Placerville, Marysville, Sacramento,\r\n    Stockton, and San José; it was not felt in any of the\r\n    localities named, excepting the two last, and at Stockton it\r\n    was quite light.\r\n\r\n    If the time as given at Monterey was the same as at this city\r\n    (San Francisco), the velocity of the earth-wave must have been\r\n    much slower than that of the great earthquake at Simoda.\r\n\r\n    March 24th, 22h. 20m.—A slight shock was felt at Canal Gulch,\r\n    Siskiyou County, also at Yreka. The motion is described as\r\n    being horizontal.\r\n\r\n    March 31st, 13h. 25m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco.\r\n    It consisted of three light but distinct tremors.\r\n\r\n    April 6th, 23h. 30m.—A smart shock was felt at Los Angeles and\r\n    the Monte, people were aroused from their beds.\r\n\r\n    May 10th, 21h. 10m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco.\r\n    The shock was accompanied by a loud report, like the discharge\r\n    of a cannon; people mistook it for the signal gun of the mail\r\n    steamer. This was felt at Monterey, and in Contra Costa County.\r\n\r\n    May 2d, 0h. 10m.—A severe shock was felt at Los Angeles. It\r\n    caused much trembling among the buildings, and considerable\r\n    alarm among the people, many leaving their beds. The shock was\r\n    preceded by two loud reports like the blasting of rock; it\r\n    apparently came from the north-west; no damage was done.\r\n\r\n    August 2d, 5h. 20m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco.\r\n    It was sufficiently strong to awaken persons in bed; it was\r\n    evidently more severe in Stockton.\r\n\r\n    August 27th, 21h. 15m.—An earthquake was felt at Mission San\r\n    Juan, Monterey County. There were two distinct shocks with\r\n    short intervals elapsing, the second being the heaviest. The\r\n    motion is described as undulatory and coming from the west. It\r\n    was felt at Monterey and at Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\n    September 6th, 3h.—A smart shock felt at Santa Cruz. It created\r\n    considerable consternation and many persons left their beds.\r\n\r\n    September 20th, 23h. 30m.—A very severe shock was felt in\r\n    different parts of San Diego County, and at that town. At\r\n    Santa Isabel the ceilings of the dwellings were shaken down;\r\n    the cattle stampeded and ran bellowing in all directions, and\r\n    the Indians seemed equally terrified. The walls of the adobe\r\n    buildings were many of them cracked. The motion is described\r\n    as oscillatory. A light shock occurred on the following Monday\r\n    morning.\r\n\r\n    November 12th, 4h.—A smart shock occurred at Humboldt Bay.\r\n    Another shock was reported but no date given.\r\n\r\n    From the record before us it will be seen that of fifteen,\r\n    the total number of earthquakes recorded during 1856, seven\r\n    have been felt in San Francisco in common with other parts\r\n    of the State; seven have occurred south of this locality\r\n    that were not observed here, and four north of it. Of the\r\n    seven shocks noticed here five only were not observed in any\r\n    adjacent district, and may be considered as strictly local.\r\n    The periods of the year at which the shocks have occurred, are\r\n    as follows: During the winter months, five; during the autumn,\r\n    three; during the spring and summer, six. None have taken place\r\n    between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\r\n\r\n    We have records of considerable and violent volcanic phenomena\r\n    throughout the northern seas, and islands both to the east and\r\n    west of Alaska. The Russian frigate _Dwina_, while lying at\r\n    Shuam Shu, brings intelligence of the outburst of a volcano\r\n    in that vicinity about the twenty-second of June, and on\r\n    the twenty-fifth of the same month passed through fields of\r\n    floating pumice; the latitude by observation being fifty\r\n    degrees fifty-three minutes, and longitude one hundred and\r\n    fifty-eight degrees thirty-two minutes east, per chronometer.\r\n\r\n    An interesting account of a submarine volcano was reported by\r\n    the Captain of the bark _Alice Frazer_, in latitude fifty-four\r\n    degrees thirty-six minutes, longitude one hundred and\r\n    thirty-five degrees west, which is as follows: A portion of the\r\n    whaling fleet, four in number, were running through the Straits\r\n    of Ourinack, on the twenty-sixth of July last; while passing\r\n    the straits a submarine volcano burst out, sending a column of\r\n    water several hundred feet upward; immediately following this,\r\n    immense masses of lava were projected into the air, and the sea\r\n    for miles and for days afterward, was covered with floating\r\n    fragments of pumice. The ships _Scotland_ and _Enterprise_ were\r\n    nearer the volcano than the ships _Frazer_ and _Wm. Thomson_;\r\n    on the decks of the two former considerable pumice, lava, and\r\n    ashes fell. There were seven vessels in the straits at the time\r\n    of the occurrence, three of which names I could not learn.\r\n\r\n    The outburst was accompanied with violent shocks of earthquake.\r\n    It is the opinion of Captain Newell, of the _Alice Frazer_,\r\n    that considerable shoaling has been the result of this\r\n    submarine action.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ON THE DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF THE EARTHQUAKE IN CALIFORNIA,\r\n    JANUARY 9, 1857—BY DR. JOHN B. TRASK.\r\n\r\n    The earthquake which occurred in various parts of this State,\r\n    on the morning of the ninth January last excited at the time\r\n    considerable attention. This arose from two causes. First,\r\n    from the varied reports that appeared on the following day\r\n    through the press of the city, detailing its occurrence in\r\n    remote mountain towns, and for which there was no foundation.\r\n    Secondly, from the great extent over which the commotion was\r\n    felt, as was subsequently proved.\r\n\r\n    Immediately following the occurrence of the phenomenon, letters\r\n    were addressed to all the principal towns between Mariposa and\r\n    Downieville, east of the valleys, for the purpose of learning\r\n    how far the shocks may have extended eastward of this city.\r\n    These letters were forwarded by the Pacific Express Company\r\n    to their agents, and through them answers were returned in\r\n    every case but two through the same source. From the facts\r\n    thus obtained, it was found that in no locality east of the\r\n    foothills, _was any shock felt on that day or night_.\r\n\r\n    Another report, equally unfounded, reached us on the arrival of\r\n    the steamer from the southern coast, to the effect that several\r\n    houses had been demolished in San Diego from its violence,\r\n    while the facts in the case are _that the steamer left that\r\n    port twenty-four hours before the shock occurred there_.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake, or more properly speaking the series of shocks\r\n    that began on the night of the eighth in this city, and which\r\n    continued in the south part of the State during the following\r\n    day and night of the ninth, was probably the most extensive of\r\n    any on record on this portion of the Pacific coast, excepting,\r\n    perhaps, that of the wave of the Simoda earthquake in December,\r\n    1854. The linear distance over which we are able to trace its\r\n    course, amounts to six hundred and two miles, and its breadth,\r\n    so far as now ascertained, is two hundred and ninety miles. It\r\n    has all the appearance of having been the terminal movement of\r\n    some more violent commotion at a distance from our coast.\r\n\r\n    From the best evidence obtainable at present, it seems to\r\n    have had its origin to the west and traveled in an easterly\r\n    direction. This is conclusively proved from the fact that it\r\n    was felt earlier at San Francisco than at any other locality\r\n    east of this city within the State. We have no record as yet of\r\n    its occurrence along the coast of Mexico or of Oregon.\r\n\r\n    I have been able to determine with considerable accuracy the\r\n    period of time at which the shock between eight and nine\r\n    o’clock on the morning of the ninth took place, at four\r\n    localities east of the City of San Francisco, in this State;\r\n    as the shock at that hour seems to have been more generally\r\n    noticed than those which either preceded or followed it here\r\n    or elsewhere, though at this city it was much less marked than\r\n    the shocks at 1h. 33m., 4h. 15m., and 7h., these three latter\r\n    occurring at those hours of the morning when most persons are\r\n    sleeping. The shock at 7h., produced a circular motion in the\r\n    pendulum, the diameter of which was about five inches. The\r\n    oscillations of the pendulum in all the others were in an\r\n    easterly and westerly direction.\r\n\r\n    The precise period of time at which the shock took place at San\r\n    Francisco, between eight and nine o’clock, is determined by\r\n    the stopping of a time-piece belonging to J. W. Tucker, whose\r\n    rate of error was three seconds fast. The time at San Diego was\r\n    furnished by Mr. Cassidy, of the army, and that of the Tejon\r\n    Reserve is by persons at that post. To private gentlemen at\r\n    Sacramento and Stockton we are indebted for the time at those\r\n    places. The accompanying table of latitudes and longitudes\r\n    of localities named, gives the hour at which the shock took\r\n    place at each; the difference or elapsed time, from which\r\n    the velocity was deduced, are the mean times corrected for\r\n    the places named, the time as given above being taken as the\r\n    standard at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    It is proper to state that three minutes four seconds, was the\r\n    greatest error in time found, and the least was twenty-two\r\n    seconds:\r\n\r\n    --------------+-------+--------+----------+---------+----------\r\n    LOCALITY.     |  Lat. |  Lon.  | Time of  | Elapsed | Velocity.\r\n                  |       |        |  shock.  |  Time.  |\r\n    --------------+-------+--------+----------+---------+----------\r\n                  |  °  ´ |   °  ´ | h. m. s. |   m. s. |  miles.\r\n    San Francisco | 37 48 | 122 25 | 8 13 30  |   0 00  |   0 0\r\n    Sacramento    | 38 32 | 121 23 | 8 20 00  |   7 30  |   6 6\r\n    Stockton      | 37 52 | 121 34 | 8 23 00  |   9 30  |   6 5\r\n    Tejon         | 35 00 | 118 46 | 8 45 00  |  32 30  |   6 0\r\n    San Diego     | 32 42 | 117 13 | 8 50 00  |  36 30  |   7 0\r\n    --------------+-------+--------+----------+---------+----------\r\n\r\n    The velocity is given in miles per minute, and by dividing the\r\n    sum of the same by their number, it will be found that the\r\n    movement of the wave at that time averages a fraction over 6.2\r\n    miles per minute.\r\n\r\n    The results obtained from the above data approximate closely\r\n    the deductions of Prof. Bache on the wave which reached our\r\n    shores and resulting from the earthquake at Simoda on the\r\n    twenty-third December, 1854, and which will be found in a\r\n    paper read by that gentleman at the meeting of the American\r\n    Association for the Advancement of Science, during the early\r\n    part of last year.\r\n\r\n    From the facts before us, there can be but little doubt of the\r\n    direction of the commotion, and that it proceeded from the\r\n    west, or a little south of that point. The motion of the earth,\r\n    as described at the different localities at which it was felt,\r\n    with the motion of the pendulum—which was slightly south of\r\n    a west line—leads to that conclusion. Time is an important\r\n    element in aiding us to form correct conclusions regarding\r\n    these phenomena, and it is to be hoped that our friends in\r\n    different parts of the State, in reporting the same, will be\r\n    precise in this particular. Of the incidents attending the\r\n    shocks, many and varied reports have reached us; it seems to\r\n    have acted with greater violence in the vicinity of the Tejon\r\n    Reserve and upper Tulare County than at any other place. It is\r\n    most remarkable that so small an amount of intensity of force\r\n    was manifested when the area over which it extended is taken\r\n    into consideration.\r\n\r\n    The effects were felt in San Francisco several hours before\r\n    they are reported to have been observed at any other place\r\n    north or south. They began here at twenty minutes past eleven,\r\n    on the night of the eighth, and continued till thirteen minutes\r\n    past eight the following morning—six shocks occurring in the\r\n    interval; while to the south, the first shock noticed at the\r\n    Tejon, was at six hours thirty minutes, on the ninth. In Los\r\n    Angeles they continued at long intervals through the day until\r\n    twenty-three hours thirty minutes of the same date. I have\r\n    learned from persons who were present in Los Angeles at this\r\n    time, and also at the shock of the fourteenth July, 1855, that\r\n    the severity of the latter exceeded that of the ninth January\r\n    last past.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1857.\r\n\r\n    During the past year there has been rather a frequency in the\r\n    occurrence of the phenomena of earthquakes; and, with the\r\n    exception of two, there have been none that were particularly\r\n    remarkable either for extent of surface affected or severity\r\n    of action. In one, that of the ninth of January, the greatest\r\n    extent of surface, and greatest intensity of action was\r\n    manifest. Its principal force seems to have been expended in\r\n    the more southerly portions of our State, and in the immediate\r\n    vicinity of those volcanic (?) vents found at different\r\n    localities upon the Colorado Desert. It is manifest, however,\r\n    that this shock and those which preceded it on the night of the\r\n    eighth, had their origin to the west of our coast, as the times\r\n    of occurrence of the shock at different localities most fully\r\n    prove. This matter was fully discussed in my previous paper,\r\n    “On the direction and velocity of the earthquake of January\r\n    9th, 1857,” read before this Society March 30th, which will be\r\n    found in their proceedings.\r\n\r\n    The other shock of greatest extent, on the second of September,\r\n    extended over an area of about two hundred miles, but was\r\n    marked by no particular severity or injury, except that of\r\n    fright to those who experienced it.\r\n\r\n    The whole number that can be authenticated as occurring during\r\n    1857, amounts to seventeen, being greater than the number\r\n    recorded in 1853 and 1856; and it would seem probable from\r\n    our records that this number is the maximum to which we shall\r\n    probably be subjected in this State.\r\n\r\n    From the Sandwich Islands we have no news of earthquakes save\r\n    one, which is here inserted: “A very severe shock of earthquake\r\n    was felt at Kawaihae, Hawaii, on the twenty-fourth of February,\r\n    the most severe that the residents there have had for many\r\n    years.”\r\n\r\n    The arrival of the whaling fleet from the Northern seas brings\r\n    no intelligence of the occurrence of these phenomena, as was\r\n    the case of the preceding year; hence, the presumption is,\r\n    that subterranean action has not been violent in those distant\r\n    regions during the year just passed.\r\n\r\n    On the coast of Mexico, and inclusive between the twenty-fifth\r\n    and thirty-second parallels, we have received intelligence of\r\n    the occurrence of one earthquake, which appears to have been\r\n    felt on both shores of the Gulf of California for a distance\r\n    of nearly two hundred miles, both north and south. We have no\r\n    records south of that point.\r\n\r\n    The shocks which we can authenticate within the limits of our\r\n    own State, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    January 9th.—This shock was felt from Sacramento to the\r\n    southern boundary of the State. It was preceded by three smart\r\n    shocks the night and morning previous. At Santa Barbara water\r\n    was thrown over the surface from a shoal well, seven feet deep,\r\n    the water in which was less than three feet in depth.\r\n\r\n    January 18th, 9h.—A light shock at Martinez and Benicia.\r\n\r\n    January 20th, 8h. 30m.—A smart shock was felt at Santa Cruz and\r\n    Mission San Juan.\r\n\r\n    January 21st, 23h.—On the evening of this day a smart shock\r\n    was felt at Mariposa. The wave and sound seemed to travel from\r\n    north-west to south-east. It was accompanied with a report like\r\n    that of a distant gun.\r\n\r\n    February 5th, 7h.—A smart shock was felt in San Francisco,\r\n    which shook the buildings that are situated on made-ground very\r\n    severely, while those situated on firmer bottoms were affected.\r\n    This shock was felt at Oakland and Stockton, but was not felt\r\n    at San José or Sacramento, as reported at the time.\r\n\r\n    March 14th, 15h.—A severe shock was felt at Santa Barbara and\r\n    Montecito. It was momentary in duration, attended with a loud\r\n    report.\r\n\r\n    March 23d, 12h. 27m.—A light shock in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    May 3d, 22h.—A smart shock at Los Angeles and the Monte.\r\n\r\n    May 23d.—A light shock at Los Angeles; a report also that a\r\n    severe shock had been felt at Fort Tejon.\r\n\r\n    June 14th.—A shock was felt at Humboldt Bay. On the same day\r\n    several severe shocks were experienced at the Penal Island\r\n    (Carmen), Gulf of California, and which extended almost ninety\r\n    miles north and south of the island.\r\n\r\n    August 8th, 11h.—A smart shock was felt at Rabbit Creek, Sierra\r\n    County.\r\n\r\n    August 29.—A severe shock at the Tejon Reserve. No time is\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n    September 2d, 19h. 45m.—A light shock at San Francisco. This\r\n    shock was felt at Sacramento, Marysville, Nevada, San Juan,\r\n    Downieville, and Camptonville.\r\n\r\n    September 14th, 2 P.M.—A light shock in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    October 19th, 18h. 30m.—A severe shock of an earthquake in San\r\n    Francisco.\r\n\r\n    October 20th, 12h. 8m., 12h. 35m., and 13h. 15m.—Three other\r\n    shocks occurred; the last was equally severe with that of\r\n    January 9th, at 8 A.M. People were much frightened, and left\r\n    their beds. The shock was felt at San José, but not at Oakland.\r\n\r\n    November 8th, 8h. 45m.—A shock at San Francisco, which was felt\r\n    at Oakland and Bodega. December 23d, 7h.—A light shock at San\r\n    Francisco.\r\n\r\n    Of the whole number which have occurred during the year, two\r\n    only have been felt at San Francisco that were not experienced\r\n    at other localities, and four others have occurred which have\r\n    been felt in common at other portions of the State—thus making\r\n    about one-third of the whole number that were in common here\r\n    and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n    Eight of the aggregate have occurred between the summer and\r\n    winter solstices.\r\n\r\n    Seven have occurred during the spring and summer months, and\r\n    ten during the winter and autumn.\r\n\r\n    Eight have occurred between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1858.\r\n\r\n    During the past year we have had occasion to note the\r\n    occurrence of eight shocks of earthquake in this State. This\r\n    number is one-half less than that in 1857, and one-third less\r\n    the number in 1856. The shocks, with one exception, have been\r\n    unmarked by anything like violence, being little else than mere\r\n    vibrations or tremors, not noticeable by the great majority of\r\n    the people. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n    February 10th.—A smart shock at Kanaka Flat, Sierra County. No\r\n    time noted.\r\n\r\n    February 15th, 4h. 20m.—A light shock in San Francisco. Was\r\n    observed in the County of San Mateo ten miles south of the city.\r\n\r\n    August 19th, 22h. 10m.—A light shock in San Francisco. The\r\n    motion was east to west, and was undulatory.\r\n\r\n    September 2d.—A smart shock at Santa Barbara, no time given.\r\n\r\n    September 3d, 0h. 40m.—A smart shock in San José. This shock\r\n    was felt at Santa Cruz, twenty-five miles west, and was\r\n    evidently more marked in strength at that locality. No damage.\r\n\r\n    September 12th, 19h. 40m.—A smart shock at San Francisco. The\r\n    motion was from north to south. There were two vibrations with\r\n    undulatory movements lasting about fifteen seconds.\r\n\r\n    September 26th, 1h. 26m.—A light shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    November 26th, 0h. 24m.—A heavy shock at San Francisco. This\r\n    shock was by far the heaviest during the year, it awoke most\r\n    people from slumber and created no little alarm; persons left\r\n    their beds and sought cooler situations with less attire\r\n    than is usually worn. The iron pillars in the second story\r\n    of the custom house have separated from the ceiling above\r\n    about half an inch, and are supposed to have settled from the\r\n    effects of the shock; I much doubt the alleged cause of this\r\n    displacement, as the pillars below present no indication of\r\n    similar disturbance. This shock was felt at Oakland ten miles\r\n    east of the city, but was not felt at Stockton, Sacramento,\r\n    nor Marysville. It was evidently confined to an area of ten or\r\n    twelve miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1859.\r\n\r\n    January 25th, 20h. 20m.—A heavy shock of earthquake was felt\r\n    in Trinity and Shasta counties. It was felt at Weaverville,\r\n    Shasta, and Horsetown.\r\n\r\n    April 4th, 13h.—Quite a severe shock was felt at San José.\r\n    There were several vibrations, apparently from north to south.\r\n\r\n    August 10th, 22h. 35m.—A smart shock was felt in this city (San\r\n    Francisco).\r\n\r\n    September 26th, 6h. 10m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    October 5th, 13h. 18m.—A very smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    November 27th, 19h. 15m.—A light shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    December 1st, 0h. 50m.—A smart shock at San Francisco. Felt at\r\n    Oakland and Benicia.\r\n\r\n    December 1st, 14h. 10m.—Several successive shocks were felt at\r\n    San Bernardino; several of them were quite heavy, causing much\r\n    alarm. No damage was done.\r\n\r\n    Whole number of shocks during this year was eight.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1860.\r\n\r\n    During the year last past this portion of the Pacific coast has\r\n    been but little disturbed by earthquakes. There have been but\r\n    three during this period that can be well authenticated, and\r\n    one, viz.: December 21st, whose character is somewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\n    The shocks that have occurred are as follows:\r\n\r\n    March 27th.—A severe shock was experienced at Los Angeles and\r\n    vicinity, which was not productive of any damage to person or\r\n    property. No time is given in the account.\r\n\r\n    March 15th, 11h.—A violent shock was experienced at Sacramento;\r\n    the wave passed through the counties of Placer, Nevada, El\r\n    Dorado and Plumas. At Iowa Hill the church bells were rung,\r\n    also at Sacramento. At the latter place and at Forest City,\r\n    clocks, in many of the buildings, were stopped. This earthquake\r\n    extended to the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada. At Carson\r\n    City it occurred at 10h. 45m. and very violent; goods were\r\n    shaken off the shelves in many of the stores, and a general\r\n    panic and stampede prevailed.\r\n\r\n    November 12th.—A smart shock was felt at Humboldt Bay and its\r\n    vicinity, but no damage was done.\r\n\r\n    December 21st, 6h. 30m.—At San Francisco a series of light\r\n    vibrations of the earth occurred, which continued with but two\r\n    remissions for the space of half an hour. These vibrations\r\n    were not perceptible to persons in the building otherwise than\r\n    by mercurial column, which was equal to seven inches of the\r\n    barometer, and was the mercury gauge of an air pump that had\r\n    remained stationary at twenty-four inches for the space of four\r\n    hours. At this time the column in the gauge began to show much\r\n    disturbance by oscillating up and down in a very rapid manner\r\n    without any apparent cause; the stop screws (Faraday’s) were\r\n    all tried at the moment and found perfectly tight as they had\r\n    remained for hours previous.\r\n\r\n    The oscillations were watched carefully by Mr. J. Roach and\r\n    myself for half an hour, at which time they ceased. The maximum\r\n    of the mercury column was a fraction over an inch, which was\r\n    attained through vibrations of one-fourth to one-eighth of\r\n    an inch rapidly repeated and continuous, and as gradually,\r\n    through a series of lighter vibrations, the displacement would\r\n    diminish and the column subside to its former level; this was\r\n    three times repeated, the column at no time being at rest. The\r\n    period of time occupied by the column in reaching its maximum\r\n    of disturbance each time was from eight to twelve minutes.\r\n    There was no apparent cause for this disturbance, unless it\r\n    be attributable to a series of light vibrations of the earth\r\n    occurring in a vertical direction, and to that cause I am\r\n    disposed to assign it.\r\n\r\n    The passing of carriages on the street did not affect these\r\n    vibrations of the column, for they continued in the same manner\r\n    when those vehicles were not passing. While the oscillations\r\n    were going on, I took a sledge and struck some half a dozen\r\n    blows on an anvil block in the workshop, which did not make any\r\n    perceptible difference in the movements of the column; after\r\n    it had come to rest, the same experiment was repeated, but\r\n    the column did not in any manner react to the concussion thus\r\n    produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1861.\r\n\r\n    During 1861 there has been but one earthquake recorded in the\r\n    State.\r\n\r\n    July 4th, 16h. 11m.—A severe shock of earthquake occurred at\r\n    San Francisco. It consisted of three distinct waves following\r\n    each other in very rapid succession. Its effects to the east\r\n    of the city in the San Ramon Valley were more severe. Near the\r\n    house of Mr. Larabie it opened a large fissure in the earth. In\r\n    the vicinity of Mr. Porter’s it opened a new spring of water,\r\n    and a small running stream was also caused near Mr. Hunt’s. For\r\n    several days after, light shocks were repeated at intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1862.\r\n\r\n    September 29th, 15h. 5m.—A very smart shock of earthquake at\r\n    San Francisco. This was felt at Petaluma.\r\n\r\n    December 23d, 20h. 19m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1863.\r\n\r\n    During the year 1863 we have had five earthquakes, and unmarked\r\n    by any serious event.\r\n\r\n    January 25th, 2h. 20m.—A severe shock was experienced at San\r\n    Diego, continuing from five to eight seconds. There was no\r\n    undulation in this instance, the shock consisting of a series\r\n    of sharp jars. It was preceded by a profound rumbling sound.\r\n\r\n    February 1st, 16h. 1m.—A very smart shock at the Mission San\r\n    Juan, Monterey County. At Gilroys the shock was felt (or\r\n    another) fifteen minutes later. The latter town is near twelve\r\n    miles east of the Mission. At both localities the motion was\r\n    undulatory. The shock was not felt at Monterey, twelve miles\r\n    west of San Juan.\r\n\r\n    June.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    July 15th, 10h. 19m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    August 1st, 11h. 6m.—Two light shocks at San Francisco about\r\n    one hour apart.\r\n\r\n    December 19th, 12h. 38m.—A very smart shock was felt throughout\r\n    the city; directly afterwards another and more severe one\r\n    occurred. The first was a sharp, sudden jar, the second\r\n    undulatory. The accuracy of the telegraph operator at Santa\r\n    Clara enables us to form a correct idea of the course of this\r\n    wave. His time was 14h. 44m. 31s., and within twenty-nine\r\n    seconds of true time. The elapsed time is 7m. 31s., and gives\r\n    for the direction of the seismic wave a course north and south\r\n    (in lieu of east and west in my first notice which was thus\r\n    in error.) I take this opportunity to express the thanks of\r\n    the Academy to this operator for his accuracy and kindness in\r\n    furnishing us dates in this and other phenomena of scientific\r\n    and public interest.\r\n\r\n    The figures derived from our statistics furnish us the\r\n    following interesting results as to the frequency of shocks in\r\n    one season of the year more than in another. The tables below\r\n    furnish the details.\r\n\r\n    It is found from these figures that during the thirteen years\r\n    ending December, 1863:\r\n\r\n    _First._ The number of days on which earthquakes have occurred,\r\n    is one hundred and ten.\r\n\r\n    _Second._ The month in which the greatest number have occurred\r\n    is January, being sixteen; and the months in which the least\r\n    number have occurred, is April and February, the sum of each\r\n    being six.\r\n\r\n    _Third._ The winter months have given the largest number in\r\n    the aggregate, the sum being thirty-four.

M. GABB.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Rémond announced in a letter to me, the discovery of\r\n    fossiliferous rocks about a league and a half east of Arivechi,\r\n    Sahuaripa Valley, Sonora, Mexico. The fossils occur in a clay\r\n    slate, and are in a fine state of preservation. He says: “The\r\n    shales rest on sandstones, barren of fossils; feldspathic\r\n    porphyries protrude through them, but no alteration of the beds\r\n    were observed at the points of contact. Even the lamination of\r\n    the fossiliferous strata has not been disturbed, and shells\r\n    are found but a few millimetres from the porphyry.” He adds\r\n    that the fossil bearing strata may attain a thickness of four\r\n    or five hundred feet. The shales are overlaid by thick strata\r\n    of compact blueish limestone. The strata dip to the south-east\r\n    with an inclination of from thirty to fifty degrees, and form\r\n    the first range of foot-bills of the Sierra Madre.\r\n\r\n    I have identified the following species on a hasty examination,\r\n    proving conclusively the cretaceous age of the formation.\r\n    It is an interesting fact, that the fossils indicate a\r\n    closer relationship to the eastern deposits than to those of\r\n    California.\r\n\r\n    Turritella seriatim-granulata Roem.

Ross Browne and another gentleman, he had learned that no\r\ncoal occurs in the locality near the Colorado River then mentioned, and\r\nthat the specimens were English coal carried up the river by speculators\r\nfor the purpose of swindling the public by selling stock in a fictitious\r\ncoal mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JUNE 6TH, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: A piece of sandstone resembling in shape a\r\nhuman foot, by Mr. Ed.

This is one of\r\n    the many instances in which the North Pacific fauna carries out\r\n    the ideas of the English crag. Unfortunately, the name appears\r\n    in Add. Gen. I, 431, for a subgenus of _Monilea_, with which\r\n    these shells have only a limited affinity; and, accordingly,\r\n    the true _Solariellæ_ have been reconstituted as part of\r\n    _Minolia_, A. Ad. That gentleman, however, fully accords with\r\n    the present arrangement. The _Solariellæ_ are known from\r\n    _Trochiscus_, and from all forms of _Solariadæ_, by the normal\r\n    (not inverted) nuclear whirls; and from the Solarids, by the\r\n    nacreous texture.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Cooper’s very lovely species of a very lovely group may\r\n    possibly prove to be a variety of the Japanese “_Minolia\r\n    aspecta_ A. Ad.” ms. in Mus. Cuming; but, until more specimens\r\n    from each district have been compared, it is more prudent to\r\n    keep them separate. It seems to have exhausted the powers of\r\n    sculpture on its graceful habitation. Under the microscope,\r\n    the sharp transverse lirulæ, mounting over the keels, dividing\r\n    the interspaces, and even ascending the wide umbilicus, are\r\n    eminently beautiful. Even the operculum is sculptured with\r\n    delicate waved radiating lines. It has the aspect of an\r\n    extremely thin _Torinia_, with a funnel-shaped umbilicus.\r\n    This is not only bounded by a granular keel, but has three\r\n    other distant spiral lines crossing the lirulæ.

The name of the fish\r\nmust therefore be changed to CHROMIS PUNCTIPINNIS, Cooper.\r\n\r\nCol. Ransom presented, on behalf of Mr. John Wilson of this city, some\r\nIndian relics, from the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, accompanied by a\r\nletter of which the following is an abstract:\r\n\r\n    The relics consist of part of a foot and hair from different\r\n    mummies, a string of beads made of bone, with a few of blue\r\n    stone, also part of a belt and tassel, and a piece of very\r\n    strong cloth of vegetable material. These were found by Mr.\r\n    Wilson in a cave situated on the western slope of a very high\r\n    mountain of the Sierra Madre, which seems almost to hang over\r\n    the ancient Pueblo of Chiricahui—a name signifying the Mountain\r\n    of Bones. This Pueblo was occupied by the Spaniards soon after\r\n    the conquest by Cortez; and from previous traditions it is\r\n    supposed by the inhabitants that this cave, and another on the\r\n    opposite side of the valley, had been used as a place of burial\r\n    by the natives for several hundred years. It is supposed that\r\n    no bodies have been deposited there for the past hundred and\r\n    fifty years, and perhaps longer.\r\n\r\n    On visiting the cave, Mr. Wilson found an excavation in the\r\n    floor made three or four years since by some persons digging\r\n    for saltpetre-earth, partly filled in, but still several\r\n    feet deep; and exposed at the sides of this pit were several\r\n    rows of bodies placed in regular order one above another, in\r\n    a remarkable state of preservation. They were in a compact\r\n    position, the knees bent up to the chin, and the face drawn\r\n    back close to the buttocks, then securely sewed up in the\r\n    remarkably strong and well-woven cloth here presented, which,\r\n    on all of the four or five bodies examined, showed the same\r\n    degree of strength and perfection. Over this was another\r\n    covering of palm-leaves also sewn closely together. The\r\n    bodies were dried and shrunken, but retained their form and\r\n    integuments. Under each body were two small sticks, on which\r\n    the body was laid on its back, the feet towards the mouth of\r\n    the cave.\r\n\r\n    The circumference of the cave was about a hundred feet, and the\r\n    height above the floor, thirty or forty feet.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wilson and his companions “came to the very decided\r\n    conclusion,” that the floor of the cave, for a depth of twenty\r\n    feet or more, was formed of bodies similarly arranged in\r\n    layers which had been placed there from time to time, as they\r\n    died, and covered with earth and pebbles from the sides of the\r\n    mountains. There can be no doubt that a thorough exploration\r\n    of these relics would reveal very much of the lost history\r\n    of the Indian tribes of Mexico, and richly reward the labors\r\n    of the antiquarian. The excellent material of the cloth in\r\n    which the bodies were sewn up, surpassing in texture and\r\n    strength anything now manufactured in Mexico, is worthy of\r\n    investigation, as it may still be found valuable for making\r\n    bags, sails, etc. There was no sign of any embalming substance\r\n    by which the bodies and cloth could have been preserved, and\r\n    the only explanation suggested by Mr. Wilson is that it is due\r\n    to the dryness of the atmosphere, and the saltpetre contained\r\n    in the earth. He also suggested that the fibres of the cloth\r\n    may have been derived from the “Maguey,” (Agave Americana) or\r\n    some allied plant.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper remarked that the condition of the foot was very similar to\r\nthose of the Indian Mummy presented to the Academy by Dr. J. B. Stout,\r\nJanuary 21st, 1856, and which had been dried by the action of the air,\r\nwhile protected from the weather by a cedar canoe inverted over another\r\ncontaining the body. That was in the moist climate of Shoalwater Bay,\r\nnorth of the Columbia river, and Dr. Cooper who was present at the time\r\nthe body was removed by Capt. Russell in 1854, was a witness of the fact\r\nthat no preservatives had been found with it. He also stated that the\r\nIndians of the vicinity could not tell how long it had been there, though\r\ncertainly not a hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 1ST, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: A box of fossils from Eureka, Humboldt Bay, by\r\nDr. Chamberlin.

A collection of plants from Washoe, by Mr.\r\nBloomer.\r\n\r\nProf. B. Silliman remarked that in his recent visit to Arizona, east\r\nof the Mohave, he had seen what he presumed were the morains of former\r\nglaciers on the eastern flanks of some of the mountain ranges. They\r\nconsist of rudely stratified materials both angular and round, mingled\r\nconfusedly together and forming terrace-like spurs or embankments\r\nradiating outwards from the curved range and appearing to have been\r\nleft there by glaciers, though no glacial polishing and scratching of\r\nthe rocks could be seen as in the Sierra Nevada opposite Mono Lake and\r\nelsewhere. These evidences of glaciers in Arizona were nearly under the\r\n35th parallel of latitude, and he believed that no evidence of glacial\r\naction had before been observed on the Pacific slope at a point so far\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nProf. W. P. Blake observed that this was certainly the first observation\r\nupon glacial phenomena in Arizona, and that he had noted evidences of\r\nformer glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, as far south as the Tejon Pass,\r\nlat. 35°, where there were large blocks of granite deposited for miles\r\nbeyond the opening of the valley.\r\n\r\nProf. Silliman described the peculiar character of the outcrops of the\r\nveins in the regions of the El Dorado Cañon. He found that nearly all\r\nvestiges of the sulphurets were removed from the outcrops, while they\r\nabounded below. The outcrops gave little indication of the metal-bearing\r\ncharacter of the veins. He had observed as he believed, at least three\r\ndistinct periods of volcanic activity in that region of the Colorado and\r\nMohave, two of which periods were sub-aqueous, and the last sub-aerial.\r\nThe lava-streams generally appeared to have been poured out after the\r\nface of the country had already assumed its present form. The volcanic\r\noutflows though extensive had not materially modified the topography of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nMr. Ehrenberg stated that the copper ores in the vicinity of La Paz, and\r\nMineral City, Arizona, were generally argentiferous, sometimes giving\r\nresults by assay as high as $200 per ton. The ores beyond that district\r\ndid not appear to contain much. The quicksilver ore at the Eugenie vein\r\ncontained both silver and copper.\r\n\r\nDoctor Behr presented the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on Californian Satyrides.\r\n\r\nBY HERMAN BEHR, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHIONOBAS NEVADENSIS. Boisduval, _in litteris_.\r\n\r\n    A few specimens of this new and as yet undescribed _Chionobas_,\r\n    were caught by Mr. Lorquin, the discoverer of the species,\r\n    and named by Dr. Boisduval. Not possessing a single specimen\r\n    of this rare species, I am not able to give a diagnosis,\r\n    and have only an indistinct recollection, that the species\r\n    bore most resemblance to the _Gerontogeic_, Ch. Tarpeja, a\r\n    Siberian species that has also been found on the summit of the\r\n    Appenines, in Italy, but that in size it is superior to any\r\n    _Chionobas_ known to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SATYRUS STHENELE Boisd.\r\n\r\n    Is rather common near San Francisco, where it is found in June.\r\n    Only one generation annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SATYRUS SYLVESTRIS Edwards.\r\n\r\n    Edwards’ description shows very clearly the marks by which _S.\r\n    Sylvestris_ can be recognized from _S. Sthenele_. This species\r\n    is found on grassy hills thinly covered with live-oak, where\r\n    its habits show a very marked difference from those of its\r\n    relations, by preferring the underside of oak branches to any\r\n    other seat, while _Sthenele_ and _Boopis_ almost exclusively\r\n    settle on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SATYRUS BOOPIS Behr.\r\n\r\n    Sthenele similis at limbus non tesselatus, sed linea transversa\r\n    distincte partitus et fœminæ ocelli alarum superiorum in fascia\r\n    dilutiori positi. Alae subtusdimidiatæ pars radicalis brunnea,\r\n    marginalis grisea, marginem versus brunnescens. Utraque\r\n    marmorata, halone ocellorum in alis anticis solo excepto\r\n    dilutiori et concolori.\r\n\r\n    This _Satyrus_ is the biggest of our Californian species,\r\n    the male being nearly double the size of the female of _S.\r\n    Sylvestris_. I find this _Satyrus_ in July in Contra Costa, on\r\n    the hills as well as on the plains. In regard to the diagnosis\r\n    of these three closely allied species, I would mention, that\r\n    the presence or absence of one or two more or less distinct\r\n    eye-marks, on the upper or under side near the anal angle of\r\n    the hind wings, is of no diagnostic importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n    S. ARIANE Boisd.\r\n\r\n    I confess I can not find any constant mark of difference\r\n    between this species and _S. Alope_, _Nephele_, and _Pegala_,\r\n    however different at first glance their forms may appear. I\r\n    am very much inclined to consider them local aberrations of\r\n    one far spread species, that gradually slopes from _S. Pegala_\r\n    Fabr., through _S. Ariane_ Boisd. to _S. Nephele_ and _S.\r\n    Alope_ Fabr., in a similar way as the Gerontogeic _P. Egeria_\r\n    L. looks very different from its African form _P. Xiphia_\r\n    Fabr., with which, nevertheless, it is insensibly united by its\r\n    intermediate form _P. Meone_.\r\n\r\n    All my Californian specimens agree perfectly with Dr.\r\n    Boisduval’s diagnosis of _S. Ariane_; with the exception of one\r\n    that approaches to _S. Pegala_, by its having only one eye-mark\r\n    on the upper side of the anterior wings, but differs by the\r\n    entire absence of the wide rusty band on the same. The specimen\r\n    was among several undoubted _S. Ariane_, caught near Mono Lake,\r\n    by Prof. Brewer, of the State Geological Survey. Besides the\r\n    above mentioned locality, I received specimens from San Diego\r\n    and Santa Cruz. Near San Francisco the species is wanting.\r\n\r\n    As to _S. Sthenele_ and _S. Sylvestris_, I entertain no doubts\r\n    regarding their rights as distinct species, but _S. Boopis_\r\n    being only distinguished by the absence of the series of eyes\r\n    on the under side of the hind wings from _S. Nephele_, may,\r\n    perhaps, prove a local variety or aberration of that most\r\n    polymorphous and far spread species _S. Alope_. In the mean\r\n    time, until the connecting forms are found, I consider it to be\r\n    specifically distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n    COENONYMPHA Hubner.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _C. Galactina_. Boisd.\r\n\r\n    I consider this species as identical with _C. Californica_\r\n    Dbld. At least I find in a long series of specimens, no\r\n    point where _Californica_ ends and _Galactina_ begins. _C.\r\n    Galactina_, according to Boisduval, exists also in Kamtschatka.\r\n    In California it is one of the commonest species of Diurnals,\r\n    and is found in the most different localities, in several\r\n    generations throughout the year. There exists a second\r\n    _Cœnonympha_ in some sequestered valleys of the Northern\r\n    Sierra, that approaches in its coloration, the European _C.\r\n    Pamphilas_. I have only seen one pair of this species, and not\r\n    possessing it, I can not give a diagnosis. It may be that it is\r\n    identical with _C. Inornata_, Edw., or _C. Ochracea_, Edw., or\r\n    some other Northern species.\r\n\r\n    Extratropical America is not rich in _Satyrides_, if compared\r\n    to the same latitudes in Europe or Asia, and California is\r\n    especially poor.\r\n\r\n    EUROPE.        CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n    _Arge_,             ——\r\n    _Erebia_,           ——\r\n    _Chionobas_,    _Chionabas_,\r\n    _Satyrus_,      _Satyrus_,\r\n    _Pararga_,          ——\r\n    _Epinephele_,       ——\r\n    _Cœnonympha_,   _Cœnonympha_.\r\n\r\n    There are seven European genera, each of them represented\r\n    by a whole series of species connecting different types. In\r\n    California there are only three of which none is known to\r\n    contain more than four species.\r\n\r\n    The Atlantic States add some tropical genera to the three\r\n    genera already obtained in California, viz.: _Neonympha_\r\n    Hubner, _Hyphthima_ Hubner, _Debis_ Dbld., and _Calisto_\r\n    Hubner. The genus _Calisto_ seems to be confined to subtropical\r\n    North America; the genus _Neonympha_ spreads in numerous\r\n    species through the tropics of America, and trespasses only\r\n    in a few species the _Cancer_; _Hyphthima_ is found in many\r\n    species in the tropics of the Old World, and it is a very\r\n    curious circumstance, that one species of this essentially\r\n    Gerontogeic genus should be found in the Southern States. But\r\n    the two American species of the genus _Debis_, are even more\r\n    interesting, for all other species of this genus, are confined\r\n    to the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\n    The metamorphoses of the _Satyrides_, are only with difficulty\r\n    to be investigated.\r\n\r\n    They feed as far as they are known, on Monocotyledoneous\r\n    plants, the extra-tropical ones, with one exception perhaps,\r\n    exclusively on Graminaceous plants. The Caterpillars shun the\r\n    sunlight and hide themselves in the grass. Some of them bury\r\n    themselves in the daytime in the ground and feed only at night.\r\n    The tropical species feeding on Scitaminaceous, Aroideous\r\n    plants, palms, and arborescent grasses, sport the shady\r\n    thickets of tropical forests, in whose twilight depths, most\r\n    of the species are also found in their imago state. Other ones\r\n    like some of the _Morphonides_, and even some _Nymphalides_\r\n    of the tropics, spend their days hidden under the luxuriant\r\n    foliage of primeval forests and begin their flight only after\r\n    sunset.\r\n\r\n    In a most interesting treatise on the characteristics of\r\n    the insect fauna of the “White Mountains,” by Samuel H.\r\n    Scudder, (Boston Journal, Vol. VII, Part IV), I find the\r\n    description of the Caterpillar of _Chionobas Semidea_, Edw.,\r\n    with a notice that it was found on Lichen. This would prove\r\n    a most remarkable exception, as all the other _Satyrides_\r\n    feed on Monocotyledoneous plants. Nevertheless, larvæ of\r\n    Artic types are generally polyphagous, and adapted to some\r\n    degree, to accommodate themselves to circumstances, and so\r\n    I would not entertain any doubts about the feeding plant of\r\n    the _Chionobas_, if it were not for the circumstance that\r\n    Mr. Scudder confesses that he did not succeed in bringing\r\n    the Caterpillar, with Lichen, to perfection. Perhaps the\r\n    Caterpillar fed on grass, or perhaps some _Carex_, and\r\n    was only, by some accident, compelled to crawl to the\r\n    lichen-covered stone, where that gentleman found it. I hope\r\n    to hear very soon about this most interesting object, for I\r\n    consider the discovery of the metamorphoses of one insect, a\r\n    more valuable fact than the diagnoses of ten new species, of\r\n    which we do not know more than the external appearance.\r\n\r\nProf. Wm. P. Blake presented the following papers:\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on a large lump of Gold found on the Middle fork of the American\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    In July last, a mass of gold nearly free from quartz, was taken\r\n    out of a placer on the Middle Fork of the American River, about\r\n    two miles above Michegan Bluffs. It weighed, as taken out, 187\r\n    ounces troy, and sold for $17.50 per ounce, netting the finder\r\n    $3,272.50. In melting, a loss of six ounces was experienced.\r\n    There was a further loss to the purchaser, from the poor\r\n    quality of the gold, the assay return of which I have not yet\r\n    been able to obtain. The ordinary gold of the claim is worth\r\n    $17.50. It is a singular fact, often remarked by dealers, that\r\n    the large lumps of gold are almost always poorer in quality\r\n    than the smaller ordinary grains from the same placers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on the Fossil remains of the Horse and Elephant, mingled, at Mare\r\nIsland, San Francisco Bay.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    The entire lower jaw and teeth of a horse, the fragments of\r\n    which I exhibit to the Academy, were taken by me from the face\r\n    of the shore cliff of Mare Island, together with broken pieces\r\n    of bones of other large quadrupeds. The teeth of an _Elephas_\r\n    had been found in the same place, a few weeks before, by Mr.\r\n    Brown, the Naval Engineer, by whom my attention was directed\r\n    to the place. The fossils occur in a stiff sandy loam, which\r\n    rests on the eroded surface of the Tertiary or Cretaceous beds\r\n    below. Near the surface is a layer of oyster shells, apparently\r\n    an upraised bed, most of the shells being entire. The fact\r\n    that the Horse and Elephant roamed together over our hills\r\n    and plains, at the dawn of, or before the human period, is\r\n    certainly not without interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmmonites or Ceratites from Oregon Bar, Middle Fork of the American River.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    The specimen which I exhibit to the Society this evening, is\r\n    from the collection of J. J. Spear, of this city. It was kindly\r\n    loaned to me by that gentleman for examination. Not wishing to\r\n    risk the specimen, by sending it to a paleontologist at the\r\n    East, I had it photographed, and sent a copy to F. B. Meek,\r\n    Esq., of Washington. It is not possible to determine from\r\n    the specimen, whether these fossils are new or not, or even,\r\n    whether they are _Ammonites_ or _Ceratites_. They appear to be\r\n    not unlike the fossils described by Dr. Trask, under the name\r\n    of _A. Chiceonsis_, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Cal.; but it is not\r\n    safe to identify them, without the septæ can be clearly made\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    There are several casts in an argillaceous, somewhat micaceous\r\n    slate. This locality is about 15 miles from Coloma. It is not\r\n    certain, whether the specimen was taken from the slates in\r\n    place, or broken from a loose mass.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore presented the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Brushite, a new mineral occurring in Phosphatic Guano.\r\n\r\nBY GIDEON E. MOORE, PH. B.\r\n\r\n    In the spring of the present year, I received through the\r\n    kindness of Wm. E. Brown, Esq., of Mare Island, in this\r\n    State, a specimen of a mineral discovered by him in a cargo\r\n    of phosphatic guano, at Camden, N. J. The locality from which\r\n    it was derived, is not known, and though letters of enquiry\r\n    have been sent to the parties to whom the cargo was originally\r\n    consigned, no reply has been received up to this date. The\r\n    texture and appearance of the guano would, however, point to\r\n    some one of the Caribbean Islands, and more particularly,\r\n    to the Island of Sombrero, as its probable source. It is\r\n    very probable that the mineral may be recognized among the\r\n    crystallized products occurring in other guano deposits.\r\n\r\n    In the specimen in my possession, the mineral occurs filling\r\n    seams in the guano, varying from ⅛ to ¼ of an inch in width.\r\n    The matrix itself is of the variety known as rock guano. It\r\n    possesses an oolitic structure and a brownish white color,\r\n    interspersed with small spots of pure white.\r\n\r\n    The mineral is in the form of small but very perfect and\r\n    brilliant crystals with a cleavage in the direction of their\r\n    greatest length, nearly equal to that of selenite; the laminæ,\r\n    being also slightly flexible, as in the case of the latter\r\n    species. Hardness, 2.25 (Moh’s scale). Specific gravity,\r\n    2.208, (mean of two determinations). Color, yellowish white.\r\n    Transparent. Lustre, vitreous splendent, inclining to pearly on\r\n    the cleavage faces.\r\n\r\n    When heated in a closed tube before the blowpipe, it whitens\r\n    and gives off water, at an incipient red heat. In the platina\r\n    forceps, it fuses with intumescence, at about 2. of Von\r\n    Kobbell’s scale, tinging the flame with the peculiar green\r\n    characteristic of phosphoric acid. The button formed by fusion,\r\n    crystallizes on cooling, showing numerous brilliant facets.\r\n    Readily soluble, even in coarse crystals, in dilute nitric and\r\n    hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\n    A qualitative analysis, revealed the presence of Lime,\r\n    Phosphoric acid, and water, with barely discernable traces of\r\n    Magnesia and Alumina.\r\n\r\n    The quantity of mineral at my disposal was very small, scarcely\r\n    exceeding one gramme in weight. In each of the following\r\n    analyses, the water was determined in 0.2 grammes, the\r\n    remaining 0.3 grammes being employed in the determination of\r\n    the Lime and Phosphoric acid. The results were as follows:\r\n\r\n                        1.      2.\r\n\r\n    Lime              32.65   32.73\r\n    Phosphoric acid   41.50   41.32\r\n    Water             26.33   26.40\r\n                     ------  ------\r\n                     100.48  100.45\r\n\r\n\r\n    These figures agree exactly with the composition of the neutral\r\n    tri-basic phosphate of lime (2 CaO., H O, P O₅), with the\r\n    addition of four equivalents of water of crystallization, (2\r\n    CaO, H O, P O₅ + 4 aq.) viz.:\r\n\r\n    2 CaO          56.26   =  32.59\r\n    P O₅           71.36   =  41.34\r\n    H O             9.00 } =  26.07\r\n    4 Aq           36.00 }\r\n                  ------     ------\r\n                  172.62     100.00\r\n\r\n    In the polarizing microscope, the mineral shows a vivid\r\n    succession of colors.

BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    During a recent visit to the Mariposa Estate, Mariposa\r\n    County, my attention was called to some organic remains in\r\n    the slates, near Bear Valley, by Miss Errington, a lady who\r\n    takes an enthusiastic interest in the sciences of geology\r\n    and mineralogy, and has for some time past, been seeking for\r\n    fossils in the gold formation of that neighborhood. One of the\r\n    specimens was the cast of a bivalve shell, and appeared to\r\n    me to be a _Plagiostoma_. On further search, we found other\r\n    specimens, some of which much resemble _Inoceramus_, to which\r\n    I am inclined to refer them. Certain long tubular cavities in\r\n    the slates, marked with heavy lines, and slightly converging,\r\n    seemed to be casts of long, nearly cylindrical shells, possibly\r\n    _Nerinæa_. These forms would indicate a Jurassic or Cretaceous\r\n    age for the formation. I propose to submit these specimens to a\r\n    competent Palæontologist, at the East, for examination, and to\r\n    dedicate one of the species, if new, to Miss Errington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, OCT. 17TH, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet; A fossil tooth of Elephant, and several fossil\r\nteeth of Horse, from Wellington’s Station, on the road from Carson Valley\r\nto Aurora, by Mr. Clayton.

All donated by Dr. Ferdinand Mueller, Director of the Botanical\r\nGarden at Melbourne.\r\n\r\nMr. Clayton made the following remarks in regard to his donations above\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\nThe teeth were found near Walkers River, about one mile below the\r\nresidence of Mr. G. E. Wellington, on the Carson River and Aurora Road.\r\nThis river cuts through a high range of hills immediately west of\r\nWellington’s, and enters a large basin or valley, which is some thirty\r\nmiles long, from north to south, by twenty miles wide, from west to east.\r\nAfter passing through this valley to the eastward, the river enters\r\nanother cañon of considerable extent, and then empties into Walkers Lake,\r\nin the southwest portion of the great basin.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river are formed of gravel, sand, and clay cement,\r\ncontaining soda and calcareous matter, which forms a white crust on the\r\nsurface of the stones and pebbles. The cement bluffs along the river, are\r\nfrom 6 or 8 to 20 feet high, and are cut out by changes in the channel\r\nduring high water.\r\n\r\nIn one of these recent cuttings, the large tooth was found, with part\r\nof the upper jaw and other portions of the skeleton. There has been no\r\nexcavation made, as yet, to uncover other portions of the skeleton, but\r\nMr. Wellington has promised to have it done, and to secure as much of the\r\nskeleton as possible, for the Society’s collections.\r\n\r\nThe small teeth were found about five feet below the surface in the solid\r\ncement, by some parties that were digging a grave. Quite a number of\r\nteeth were found, but with the exception of the two just presented to the\r\nSociety, they were not preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOV. 21ST, 1864.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven members present.\r\n\r\nRev.

M. GABB.\r\n\r\n    Through the kindness of Miss Errington, of Bear Valley,\r\n    Mariposa County, I have had the opportunity of examining a\r\n    series of fossils, discovered by that lady on the Mariposa\r\n    Estate. The shells appear to be of Jurassic age. The genera so\r\n    far recognized, are Belemnites, Nucula or Leda, Lima, Pecten,\r\n    and Pholadomya. The following are sufficiently perfect for\r\n    description. Fuller descriptions and figures will be published\r\n    hereafter in the Geological Report of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LIMA, Brug.\r\n\r\n    _L. Erringtoni_ G. Shell very oblique, sides subparallel;\r\n    beaks small; anterior end prominently rounded, sloping with a\r\n    broad curve below to the base; posterior side nearly straight,\r\n    continuing upwards in a long narrow ear; anterior ear obsolete\r\n    (?).\r\n\r\n    Surface marked by strong concentric undulations, crossed on the\r\n    upper and posterior portions by fine radiating lines.\r\n\r\n    Length, 2.25 inches; width, 1 inch.\r\n\r\n    The specimens are all very much compressed, and may be somewhat\r\n    distorted in form, though the outlines are very nearly uniform\r\n    in all of the specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PHOLADOMYA, Sow.\r\n\r\n    _P. orbiculata_ G. Compressed, sub-circular; beaks rather\r\n    prominent, nearly central; anterior end and base regularly\r\n    rounded; posterior end slightly produced, more prominent below\r\n    than above. Surface ornamented by concentric ribs, irregular in\r\n    size, crossed by undulating, radiating lines on the anterior\r\n    half of the shell. These lines become gradually obsolete and\r\n    disappear on or about the middle of all of the specimens,\r\n    although more perfect examples might show them continuing\r\n    further.\r\n\r\n    Height, from a slightly distorted specimen, 1.1 inch; width,\r\n    1.3 inch.\r\n\r\n    Like the preceding species, all of the specimens have suffered\r\n    considerably by compression; and had we perfect specimens, the\r\n    shell would be found to be quite convex.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BELEMNITES.\r\n\r\n    _B.

Section, sub-elliptical;\r\n    alveolus deep and narrow.\r\n\r\n    A specimen 3 inches long, measures .35 in. in diameter in the\r\n    middle. One cast has been found with a diameter of .9 inch at\r\n    the broadest part.\r\n\r\n    I first discovered this species, as imperfect casts, in the\r\n    slates near Spanish Flat, El Dorado County. Since then,\r\n    numerous fragments and casts have been found at Mariposa, by\r\n    Mr. C. R.

GABB.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Attwood has recently presented to the collection of the\r\n    State Geological Survey, a series of Fossils collected by\r\n    himself, in the formation in which the San Luis Obispo cinnabar\r\n    deposits occur.\r\n\r\n    Through the kindness of Prof. B. Silliman, Jr. I have had the\r\n    opportunity of examining another small collection, made by\r\n    that gentleman, at the same locality. I consider the result of\r\n    sufficient interest to warrant a special communication on the\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    The Fossils, though few in number of species, point\r\n    unequivocally to the Miocene formation, the species being among\r\n    the most familiar forms in the middle deposit of that formation\r\n    in California.\r\n\r\n    They were: Dosinia ponderosa, Saxidomus aratus, Conus ravus\r\n    = _C. Californicus_ Reeve, Turritella Ocoyana Con., Natica,\r\n    probably N. Recluziana, Pecten Pabloensis Con., Pallium\r\n    Estrellanum Con., Carcharodon rectus Agas. a Balanus and one or\r\n    two small shells too imperfect for determination.\r\n\r\nMr. Moore presented on behalf of Prof. Dana, the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Crystallization of Brushite.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES D. DANA, L.L.D., PROFESSOR OF MINERALOGY IN YALE COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n    The specimens of the mineral Brushite, which I have had under\r\n    crystallographic examination, were received from Mr. G. E.\r\n    Moore, the discoverer of the species.\r\n\r\n    The crystals are slender prisms, not over a third of an inch\r\n    in length. A common form (containing all the observed planes),\r\n    is shown in the annexed figure. The prisms are monoclinic, and\r\n    are often flattened, parallel to the clinodiagonal, as here\r\n    represented.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n    Cleavage is perfect, parallel of the clinodiagonal section, or\r\n    the plane _iì_; also distinct parallel to the line _cl_, as\r\n    apparent often in the cross fractures of the crystals, and by\r\n    occasional striæ. This plane of cleavage may be taken as the\r\n    basal plane _O_.\r\n\r\n    The planes _I_ and l are brilliant, especially the former.\r\n    The oblique plane situated on the back side in the figure,\r\n    and which may be called _r_, is quite rough, owing to the\r\n    oscillatory combination between two hemi-octahedral planes. In\r\n    many of the crystals, only the right one of the two planes _I_\r\n    is present, and also only the left one of the two planes l. The\r\n    prisms frequently terminate above in an irregular edge, made by\r\n    the meeting of the one, or two, planes _I_, and the rough plane\r\n    _r_, and this edge is sometimes cut off, more or less deeply,\r\n    by a single oblique plane, which is one of the planes l.\r\n\r\n    According to measurements with the reflective goniometer;\r\n\r\n    _I_ : _I_   =  142° 26’\r\n    _I_ : _iì_  =  108° 47’\r\n     l  : _iì_  =  101° 40’\r\n     I  :  l    =  156° 20’ (approximately.)\r\n\r\n    The inclination of the I on l could not be accurately measured,\r\n    on account of the minuteness of the planes in the crystals,\r\n    in which both planes occur, and the want of perfection in the\r\n    reflection. The angle obtained for l:_iì_ would give, for l:l,\r\n    156° 40’.\r\n\r\n    By measurement with a goniometer attached to a compound\r\n    microscope, the plane angle between the lines of cross\r\n    cleavage, or _cl_, and the edge _I_:_I_ (which equals the\r\n    inclination of _O_ on the orthodiagonal section, or a plane\r\n    _ii_) was found to be 117-117½°; and that between edge _I_:_I_\r\n    and edge l:l (which equals _ii_ on l_i_, both unobserved\r\n    planes) 95°-95½°: whence _O_:l_i_ would equal approximately\r\n    147° 30’. The inclination of the rough plane _r_ on the edge\r\n    l:l is about 110°, but varies much.\r\n\r\n    The results of calculation, taking as data the above mentioned\r\n    angles _I_:_I_ and l:_ii_, along with the inclination of _O_ to\r\n    _ii_ = 117° 15’, and that of the edge l:l (or l_ì_) to _ii_ =\r\n    95° 15’ are as follows:\r\n\r\n    C (= O : _iì_) = 117° 15’ and 62° 45’\r\n\r\n    _a_ (vert. axis) : _O_ (clinodiag.) : _c_ = 0.5396 : 1 : 2.614\r\n\r\n    l : l = 156° 46’        -l : -l (unobserved planes) = 164° 22’\r\n\r\n    The species is related in form to Vivianite, in which\r\n\r\n    _a_ : _b_ : 2_c_ = 1.0792 : 1 : 2.614.\r\n\r\n    The crystals of the two species are also alike in the perfect\r\n    and pearly clinodiagonal cleavage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn new Californian Marine Shells. No. II.\r\n\r\nBY PHILIP P. CARPENTER, PH. D., OF WARRINGTON, ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Genus COLLONIA, _Gray_, 1852.\r\n\r\n    This genus was established (in English) by Dr. Gray, for\r\n    Turbinate shells having an “operculum circular, with many\r\n    gradually enlarged whirls, with a convex external rib and\r\n    central pit.” The type (still appearing as such in the B. M.\r\n    Col.) is a smooth fossil from Grignon, = Delphinula marginata,\r\n    Lam., with a keeled and crenated umbilicus, like Phillippia.\r\n    Another (African) shell is joined to the diagnosis, with the\r\n    following brief description: “C. striata, _Gray_. Shell red,\r\n    white marbled, striated.” It is quoted by Phillippi, Handb.\r\n    Conch. p. 206, who assigns as a type T. sanguineus, _Linn._\r\n    For this species and its congeners, we now propose a subgenus\r\n    LEPTONYX, as they do not agree with the type. The genus was\r\n    reconstituted by Messrs. Adams, Gen. i. 396 for shells with\r\n    “imperforate axis and contracted aperture:” the description\r\n    of the operculum being copied from Gray. The type is now “C.\r\n    marginata, _Nutt._” pl. 44, f. 2, the operculum of which is\r\n    figured as with _few_ whirls. The same description and figure\r\n    are given in Chenu, Manuel i. 348, f. 2560. The error seems\r\n    to have arisen thus. Mr. H. Adams (who acted for the ‘firm’\r\n    during his brother’s long absence in Japan,) probably took\r\n    Gray’s C. marginata to be the ‘Turbo marginatus, Nutt.’ of\r\n    Reeve, and from this species as type, described the genus to\r\n    be imperforate, etc. Unfortunately, Dr. Gray did not observe\r\n    the error, which had arisen from confounding two different\r\n    shells called marginatus; and in his guide to Mollusca (in\r\n    loco) he adopts the description of Messrs. Adams; so that\r\n    Collonia, _Gray_, (hodie) = Collonia, _Add._, but not Collonia,\r\n    _Gray_, (olim). Of the species arranged by Mr. H. Adams under\r\n    Collonia, some may belong to the original genus: some are\r\n    included under Cynisca, _A. Ad._; and one (Turbo phasianella,\r\n    _C. B. Ad._) appears to be Eucosmia. They appear in the Br.\r\n    Mus. Col. distributed between Gibbula and Photinula. The true\r\n    Turbo marginatus of Nutt. is the ordinary black Californian\r\n    Chlorostoma, like mœstus, and well named from its frilled\r\n    margin near the suture. But the label having become affixed to\r\n    the T. marginatus _Rve._ (which must stand as Reeve’s species\r\n    and not Nuttall’s) the Californian shell was left without\r\n    name, and was described by Mr. A. Adams as Chl. funebrale,\r\n    under which name it must stand as Nuttal’s prior name was\r\n    (unfortunately) in MS. only. The name Collonia marginata must\r\n    stand for the original fossil of Lamarck. It is probable that\r\n    Reeve’s shell belongs to another group; else it must, according\r\n    to the usual custom of honoring error, be called C. Reevei. For\r\n    the Californian species, which are imperforate and have a thin,\r\n    smooth operculum, Mr. A. Adams and I propose to form a subgenus\r\n    _Leptonyx_; a diagnosis of which will appear in the next paper,\r\n    after the foreign species have been examined. The following are\r\n    the Californian forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Leptonyx sanguineus_, Linn.\r\n\r\n    H. t. parvâ, solidâ, rubrâ, anfr. V. subtumentibus, suturis\r\n    plus minusve impressis; costulis spiralibus plus minusve\r\n    rotundatis cinctâ, quarum iv.-viii. in spirâ monstrantur;\r\n    aperturâ subcirculari; columellâ t. adolescente foveâ basali et\r\n    dente ut in ‘Modulo’ munitâ; adultâ, callositate tenui labiali,\r\n    foveam tegente, obscure bidentatâ; labio tenui, continuo;\r\n    umbilico nullo.\r\n\r\n    _Hab_. Mediterranean, _Phillippi_, _Hanley_. Japan, _A. Adams_.\r\n    Monterey, _Jewett_, _Taylor_, _Cooper_. Neeah Bay, W.T., _Swan_.\r\n\r\n    = Turbo sanguineus, Ln. Syst. Nat. Ed. 12, p. 1235:—Phil. Moll.\r\n    Sic. in loco: Hanl. Ips. Lin. Conch, in loco.\r\n\r\n    = T. Belliæi, Michaud in Mus. Paris: teste Hanl.\r\n\r\n    Non “Turbo sanguineus, Linn.” Rve. Conch. Ic. sp. 55: = T.\r\n    coccineus, _Desh._ = Globulus roseus, Chem. teste Rve. Nec\r\n    (Gibbula) sanguinea, _Risso_.\r\n\r\n    Reeve says of his shell. “I am not quite sure that this is the\r\n    T. sanguineus of Linnæus, but _have every reason_ to believe\r\n    it is.” That is, every reason except the one only convincing\r\n    proof, which was so easy to a London naturalist, an inspection\r\n    of the original type in the Linnæan Collection. A mere glance\r\n    at this would have exposed his error. Reeve’s shell is whitish,\r\n    with blood-red spots, and is probably a S. African species.\r\n    Whether Linnæus described from Mediterranean or Japanese\r\n    specimens, cannot be told from his rubbed shells; nor as yet\r\n    have sufficiently perfect specimens been compared from the\r\n    two oceans; but no character has been observed by which they\r\n    can be separated. The great author obtained his Algerine and\r\n    his Philippine shells from the Swedish consuls; and Japanese\r\n    species may have been mixed with the latter. It is very rare in\r\n    the Mediterranean; common in Japan; common also at Vancouver;\r\n    but rare further south. It is, we believe, the only Californian\r\n    shell described by the father of modern Natural History. The\r\n    specimens vary very greatly in strength of sculpture. There is\r\n    also a purple variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Leptonyx_ (_sanguineus_, var.) _purpureum_.\r\n\r\n    H. t. ‘H. sanguineo’ simili, sed purpureo fuscâ; lirulis\r\n    spiralibus crebioribus, interstitiis parvis, labio obsoleto.\r\n\r\n    _Hab._ Sta.

It differs from L. sanguineus in its small\r\n    size, ashy color, flattened sutures, and nearly obsolete\r\n    sculpture. A groove in the somewhat callous columella,\r\n    continued slightly round the labrum, seems intended for the\r\n    broad-margined operculum of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL MEETING, JAN. 9TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident, Col.

In the male the black color is more\r\n    predominating, in the female the fulvous coloration.\r\n\r\n    For the sake of completing this series of diagnoses, I give\r\n    here the description of a third species, that I received, by\r\n    the kindness of Dr. Dinklage, from the Sierra Madre, in the\r\n    neighborhood of Mazatlan. I think it indispensable to give the\r\n    marks of this closely allied Nemeobius, as I am of the opinion\r\n    that thus errors will most effectually be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _N. Mejicanus_, Behr.\r\n\r\n    Alæ supra fulvæ, marginem versus brunneæ, fasciis maculisque\r\n    ordinariis omnibus albis nigro marginatis instructæ.

Alæ posteriores grisescentes, macalis albis\r\n    et nigro marginatis et confluentibus cum colore universali\r\n    irregulariter variegatæ.\r\n\r\n    The most positive and striking points of difference would be\r\n    thus:\r\n\r\n    1. _N. Dumeti._ Fore wings alone show a fulvous coloration on\r\n    the upperside. Bands and spots perfectly white.\r\n\r\n    2. _N. Mejicanus._ All wings are occupied with it, till beyond\r\n    the second band, where the brownish coloration of the margin\r\n    begins. Bands and spots perfectly white.\r\n\r\n    3. _N. Virgulti._ Extension of the fulvous as in the preceding,\r\n    but all the space more or less occupied by black. Middle band\r\n    nearly altogether fulvous, other bands and spots white.\r\n\r\n    As much as we know, the type of this genus _N. Lucina_ L, was\r\n    the only species known heretofore, and it is another proof of\r\n    the various repetition of types on occidental coasts, that we\r\n    have to add three Pacific representatives of a genus first\r\n    discerned in a single European species.\r\n\r\n    The group of the _Erycinides_ belongs essentially to tropical\r\n    America. The beforementioned _Nemeobius Lucina_ is the only\r\n    European representative of this numerous and polymorphous\r\n    group. Besides this, there exist some few Asiatic members of\r\n    this family, very aberrant in their type, scarcely known and\r\n    insufficiently examined, so that possibly they may belong\r\n    somewhere else. In America the tropical genera _Nymphidia_ and\r\n    _Lemonias_, extend beyond the Cancer on the Atlantic side; but\r\n    on the Pacific side reappears the European genus _Nemeobius_,\r\n    extending into the Tropics, and seems to find here its very\r\n    centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of New Species of Land Shells.\r\n\r\nBY W.

Insula Niphon—Japan, (teste Blake).\r\n\r\n    Shell uniformly yellowish white, rounded, half globular,\r\n    shining, translucent; umbilicus large, deep and slightly\r\n    covered; apex obtuse; whorls six, convex, the three first\r\n    nearly on the same plane, the balance rapidly increasing, the\r\n    last swollen; suture well marked; aperture roundly lunar; lip\r\n    thin, flatly reflected, at the columella broadly dilated but\r\n    not adherent.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—In general form and color, this species makes a nearer\r\n    approach to _H. candida_, Moricand, than to any species with\r\n    which I am acquainted. It varies in the less elevation, in\r\n    the form of the spire, and in some other respects. Professor\r\n    Blake had remarkable facilities for collecting in Japan, but\r\n    unfortunately the mice proved so destructive to his terrestrial\r\n    shells, as to leave him but few specimens as the result of his\r\n    labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Helix declivis_, Newc.\r\n\r\n    Hel. testa perspectivo-umbilicata, lenticulare, oblique\r\n    striata, tenue, pallide-cornea; anfr.

Insula Niphon, (Japan).\r\n\r\n    Shell perspectively umbilicate, lenticular, obliquely striate,\r\n    thin, pale horn color; whorls four, planulate, the last\r\n    shelving down to the centre, which is obscurely keeled; suture\r\n    channelled; lip fragile, simple; aperture oblique, almost round.\r\n\r\n    REMARKS.—Bears some resemblance to _H. ruderata_, Stud.,\r\n    a species common in Europe, from which it may readily be\r\n    distinguished by comparison.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—The Japanese species herein described, were collected by\r\n    Professor Blake, in the interior of the Island of Niphon, out\r\n    of the range permitted to foreign travel.\r\n\r\n    The Professor, who was employed by the Japanese Government as a\r\n    special geologist, had the privilege of penetrating districts\r\n    not before visited by any scientific or mercantile foreigner.\r\n    The following species of Helices were also among those\r\n    collected:\r\n\r\n    _Helix peliomphala_, Pfr., (Mon. Hel. viv. Vol. 4, Sp. 1764).\r\n    _H. quesita_, Deshayes, (Reeve’s Mon. fig. 1355).\r\n    _H. Perryi_, Jay, (Perry’s Exped. Vol. 2, page 294, Plate 5,\r\n      fig. 7, 8, 9).\r\n    _H. Simoda_, Jay, (do. fig. 1 to 6).\r\n\r\n    Some doubt may exist as to the _H. quesita_ being identical\r\n    with _H. Perryi_. But one specimen was preserved, and this\r\n    fully agrees with the description and figure of the first\r\n    named, but the locality for the species is given as the\r\n    “_Moluccas_.”\r\n\r\n    It also agrees (except in colour) with Dr. Jay’s description,\r\n    and also in the very poor figures illustrating the species of\r\n    _H. Perryi_. The only question in my mind is one regarding\r\n    locality.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Helix Cronkhitei_, Newc.\r\n\r\n    Hel. testa aperta umbilicata, depressa, luteo-cornea sub-lente\r\n    regulariter costulato-striata; spira depressa-convexa; sutura\r\n    excavata; anfractibus quatuor, sub-cylindraceis; umbilica\r\n    ampla, sub-perspectiva; apertura rotundata; peristomate\r\n    simplici, acuto, marginibus conniventibus.\r\n\r\n    Alt. ·15 pol., Diam. maj. ·2 pol., min. ·15 pol.\r\n\r\n    Hab.

(See addenda to “Remarks\r\n    on Classification, etc.,” 1863). This species is certainly\r\n    distinct from _striatella_, by its smaller size, rib-like\r\n    costa, and almost channelled suture.\r\n\r\n    A few specimens were obtained by Mr. Gabb, of the State\r\n    Geological Survey, in Klamath Valley, which were collected\r\n    jointly by himself and Dr. Cronkhite, U.

The statement that the shell was _hirsute_, was\r\n    founded upon the cicatrices observed upon the surface, Mr.\r\n    Gabb, who has recently returned from a trip to Mariposa, was\r\n    successful in finding a few specimens, by which the diagnosis\r\n    may be enlarged, and conjecture resolved into certainty. The\r\n    whole surface is covered with an epidermis, of a yellowish\r\n    brown colour, thickly studded with slightly curved rigid\r\n    hairs about one-twentieth of an inch in length. The animal\r\n    is of a reddish brown color, with the tentacles of a smoky\r\n    hue; tentacular sheaths darker than the body, which is small,\r\n    slender, finely granulated and unusually long and tapering\r\n    behind.\r\n\r\n    The shell bears the same relations to _H. Dupetit Thouarsi_,\r\n    Deshayes, that _Helix infumata_, Gould, bear to _H. fidelis_,\r\n    Gray. In the description of _infumata_, an important omission\r\n    occurs, owing doubtless to the imperfect condition of the type\r\n    specimen. In good specimens, all of the last whirl, except a\r\n    circle round the umbilicus, is covered with _very short_ and\r\n    thickly studded soft hairs, feeling harsh when dry, but velvety\r\n    to the touch when moistened.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Achatinella Alexandri_, Newc.\r\n\r\n    Ach. testa perforata, sinistrorsa, elongato sub-cylindracea,\r\n    nitida, rufo-brunnea, nigro-elongato-venulato-inosculante\r\n    picta; anfr.

Renyi_, Newc., which is longer, not\r\n    umbilicate, more pointed at the apex, with a twisted, not\r\n    truncate columella.\r\n\r\n    From _venusta_ and _citrina_, Mighels, it varies both in\r\n    form and color. With some varieties of _picta_ it claims\r\n    analogy only in the general plan of painting. Its striking\r\n    characteristics are its blunt apex, slightly rounded whorls,\r\n    small aperture, short and white columella, umbilicus, and\r\n    general plan of coloring.\r\n\r\n    A few specimens were collected at an elevation of 7,500 feet,\r\n    on West Maui, by the Rev.

JOHN B. TRASK.\r\n\r\n    FEB. 26TH, 0 h. 40 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco. At 5 h. 45 m. a smart shock, having three distinct\r\n    vibrations. On the day previous, an “_Electric Storm_”\r\n    prevailed between Visalia, Tulare Co., and Los Angeles, which\r\n    was very violent in its effects on the telegraph lines.\r\n\r\n    On the 27th, a heavy “Norther” commenced and continued till the\r\n    eve of the 28th. This earthquake was felt at San José, fifty\r\n    miles south, at the same hour, and was marked by two very smart\r\n    shocks following each other in quick succession.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 5TH, 8 h. 49 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco. The earthquake began at the above hour. The first\r\n    wave was in a direction north and south, and lasted one and\r\n    three-fourths seconds. Nearly one and a half seconds elapsed\r\n    before the second shock, which occurred at forty-nine minutes,\r\n    three seconds past eight o’clock, and had a duration of one and\r\n    one-half seconds. The motion in this shock was rotatory.\r\n\r\n    Magnetism was _not_ suspended in this nor either of the other\r\n    shocks, this year. The total length of time included in this\r\n    earthquake, was nearly 5 seconds. These observations were made\r\n    at the height of 20 feet 4 inches above the ground, but persons\r\n    situated at a greater height felt the vibrations longer and\r\n    more severely.\r\n\r\n    We have brief details of this earthquake from Santa Rosa, at\r\n    the north, to Santa Cruz at the south, and from Stockton at the\r\n    east, for which we acknowledge our obligations to the Telegraph\r\n    Company. At Santa Rosa it occurred at 8 h. 50 m. the shock was\r\n    light. At Petaluma 8 h. 50 m., also light. At Stockton _about_\r\n    9 h., shock was severe. At Santa Clara 8 h. 40 m., the shocks\r\n    were very severe. The church spires waved to and fro, and the\r\n    earthquake is reported to have continued over two minutes, with\r\n    light vibrations between the heavier waves. At Santa Cruz no\r\n    time is given.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 10TH, 14 h. 8 m.—A light shock was felt in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    ” ” 16 h. 30 m.—Another shock at San Francisco, marked by two\r\n    distinct vibrations and lasting three and one-half seconds.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 20TH, 23 h. 45 m.—A light shock of earthquake having\r\n    four distinct tremors, and occupying a little more than three\r\n    seconds.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 22D, 13 h. 0 m.—A smart shock was felt at Stockton,\r\n    causing some little commotion.\r\n\r\n    MAY 20TH, 18 h. 1 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco. At Stockton the shock was quite severe and occurred\r\n    nine minutes later. At San José it also was very sharp. At Napa\r\n    the earthquake, which was quite severe at this place, occurred\r\n    at 18 h. 57 m. At Sacramento the shocks occurred at 18 h.: and\r\n    was very severe. There were two distinct waves felt at this\r\n    locality. This earthquake was felt as far north as Long Valley,\r\n    in Mendocino County, and was followed by two loud reports like\r\n    artillery, almost instantly.\r\n\r\n    JUNE 6TH, 11 h. 7 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco.\r\n\r\n    JUNE 22D, 20 h. 53 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco, consisting of three distinct waves and a profound\r\n    low rumbling sound. Each of the shocks were marked by a\r\n    peculiar abruptness, like sudden sharp jolts. They were\r\n    followed by a series of lessening tremors which gradually died\r\n    away.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake was felt as far north as Healdsburg, (about 80\r\n    miles distant), at Napa, at Pacheco, at Stockton, and at San\r\n    José, south of this city fifty-two miles, making a distance of\r\n    one hundred and thirty-two miles, north and south, over which\r\n    its influence was well marked.\r\n\r\n    JULY 5TH, 20 h. 3 m.—An earthquake at San Francisco, not\r\n    severe; this consisted of four distinct vibrations occurring\r\n    during a period of seven minutes. The second vibration and the\r\n    longest lasted nineteen seconds. The shortest vibration was six\r\n    seconds in length. The elapsed time between the waves varied\r\n    from forty seconds to one and one-fourth minutes.\r\n\r\n    JULY 21ST, 2 h. 7 m.—A smart shock was felt at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    ” ” 22 h. 40 m. 38 s.—A very smart shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco, consisting of two waves at four seconds apart. The\r\n    direction of the motion was north thirteen degrees east. The\r\n    displacement was one and a fourth inches, at twenty feet four\r\n    inches from the ground. Pendulum suspension eighteen inches.\r\n\r\n    The earthquake was experienced at San José at the same hour,\r\n    and consisted of four strong shocks. At Stockton the earthquake\r\n    was severe, and took place twelve minutes later than at this\r\n    city. The earthquake was felt at Los Angeles, but was not very\r\n    heavy. No time is given from this latter locality.\r\n\r\n    JULY 25TH, 23 h. 56 m.—A shock of earthquake at Los Angeles.\r\n\r\n    AUG. 17TH, 22 h. 39 m.—A light shock of earthquake at Nevada\r\n    and vicinity.\r\n\r\n    AUG. 18TH, 5 h. 18 m.—A very strong shock of earthquake was\r\n    experienced at Grass Valley and Nevada, which threw down a wall\r\n    of stone and brick in the well of Dr. Fellows. This earthquake\r\n    was felt at Gibsonville at the north and at Marysville to the\r\n    west; at the latter locality it was twelve minutes later than\r\n    at Grass Valley.\r\n\r\n    SEPT. 6TH, 10 h. 3 m.—A shock of earthquake at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    SEPT. 20TH, 11 h. 0 m.—A light shock of earthquake at San José;\r\n    it was observed at the Mission Dolores.\r\n\r\n    SEPT. 27TH, 10 h. 32 m.—A heavy shock at Mission San Juan,\r\n    Monterey Co.\r\n\r\n    OCT. 6TH, 21 h. 9 m.—A smart shock of earthquake at San\r\n    Francisco.\r\n\r\n    OCT. 14TH, 1 h. 8 m.—Two heavy shocks of earthquake were felt\r\n    at Mission San Juan, and another severe shock at 10 h. 25 m.,\r\n    the movement was from west to east.\r\n\r\n    DEC. 11TH, 20 h. 52 m.—A shock of earthquake at San Francisco.\r\n    This shock was felt at San José at 20 h. 51 m., and was\r\n    evidently more severe there than at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    During 1864, we have had twenty-one days on which earthquakes\r\n    have occurred, and of at number there have been two days,\r\n    (March 10th and July 21st) in which more than one shock has\r\n    taken place within the twenty-four hours of each day.\r\n\r\n    The _British Colonist_, of Victoria, Vancouver Island,\r\n    furnishes the following statement:\r\n\r\n    From a gentleman who has resided on Vancouver Island for 15\r\n    years, we learn that slight earthquakes have occurred annually,\r\n    with one or two exceptions, during the entire period. Only on\r\n    one occasion (1858) does he remember experiencing a shock at\r\n    all approaching in severity that of Saturday morning, October\r\n    29th 1864. The oscillation, as on this last occasion, has\r\n    almost invariably been from west to east: and he accounts\r\n    for this, by supposing that the internal convulsion of the\r\n    earth beneath, has to find vent in the crater of Mount Baker,\r\n    situated to the east of us. This volcano has not had any\r\n    visible eruption for several years. On the last occasion, it\r\n    sent up a dense volume of smoke, and occasionally a bright\r\n    flame was seen to issue from the fiery furnace. Another old\r\n    resident informs us, that the appearance of the summit of Mount\r\n    Baker has undergone a material change within late years, giving\r\n    room for the conjecture that large portions have crumbled away\r\n    and descended into the yawning abyss of the crater which lies\r\n    between the two highest peaks.\r\n\r\n    Relating to earthquakes at San Francisco and its immediate\r\n    vicinity, we have an item of interesting information relating\r\n    to their effects at the Farrallones Islands, situated some\r\n    fifteen miles to the west of the city. It appears, upon the\r\n    testimony of the lighthouse-keeper at these Islands, and who\r\n    has resided there for several years, (seven or eight), that but\r\n    _two_ of the whole number occurring at this city, have been\r\n    felt at the Islands, and of these he made an official record.\r\n    The first was the shock of Dec. 23d, 1862, and that of June\r\n    22d, 1864.\r\n\r\n    From 1857 to date, we have seven years, during which time\r\n    twenty-five shocks have been authenticated at San Francisco,\r\n    while two only of the number have been felt at the above\r\n    locality west of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JAN. 16TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nMr. Melville Attwood was elected a resident member.\r\n\r\nA communication was read from Rev.

Blake communicated the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Mineral Oil Regions in the Tulare Valley.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    Recent examinations of prospecting parties, have added largely\r\n    to the well-known oil-bearing portions of the State. A district\r\n    some sixty miles in length, on the inner slopes of the Coast\r\n    mountains, towards the Tulare Valley, has been found to abound\r\n    in oil springs, or indications of oil. Oil exudes from the\r\n    surface in large quantities, and collects rapidly in small pits\r\n    sunk by prospectors. The soil about these pits is very black\r\n    and saturated with oil. The gases escaping from this soil are\r\n    inflammable, and many of the prospectors have been startled to\r\n    see flames spreading over the ground, beyond their camp fires.\r\n    In digging pits about these springs, large quantities of bones\r\n    of various kinds have been thrown out, and all are wonderfully\r\n    well preserved. These bones appear chiefly those of the horse,\r\n    deer, and elk, though there are many others which I have not\r\n    been able to recognize. The teeth of the horse, sent to me,\r\n    are of unusual size, and induce the question, whether they are\r\n    not of greater antiquity than the present race of horses. I am\r\n    assured that the variety of bones and teeth of many kinds is\r\n    very great.\r\n\r\n    The oil found gives an excellent article for lubricating\r\n    purposes, and must be very similar to the oil found near\r\n    Zanesville, Ohio, according to the descriptions given of the\r\n    latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote upon the occurrence of Sphene in the Granite of the Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    Sphene, in small hair-brown or amber-colored crystals, appears\r\n    to be abundantly distributed in the granite of the Sierra\r\n    Nevada. It may be found at the sources of the American River,\r\n    in the exposures of granite about Slippery Ford, and other\r\n    points, and upon the Mokelumne River, further south. The\r\n    crystals are seldom more than the thirty second part of an\r\n    inch in diameter, and are not conspicuous, but may be found in\r\n    almost any specimen of the rocks.\r\n\r\n    It appears, that this mineral is also of common occurrence\r\n    in the granite of the British Islands. In a report to the\r\n    British Association, (1863) upon the composition of the granite\r\n    of Donegal, it is stated, that the rock contains, almost\r\n    universally, small crystals of sphene, in some varieties so\r\n    abundantly, as to induce the authors of the Report to term it\r\n    “sphene granite.” It is also observed that this mineral has\r\n    long been known to exist in the granite of parts of Scotland,\r\n    and in that of Galway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, FEBRUARY 20TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen members present.\r\n\r\nDiscussion as to various matters pertaining to Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 6TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nWilliam Hillebrand, M.

Catalogue of the College of\r\nCalifornia, 1864-5; Proceedings of the Essex Institute, Vol. 4, No.\r\n4; Supplementary Catalogue of the Library Company at Philadelphia;\r\nProceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, for\r\nSeptember and October, 1864.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr read the following letters from Major Preiss, of Mazatlan, as\r\nto the efficacy of the _Euphorbia prostrata_, as a remedy for the bite of\r\nthe rattlesnake and venomous insects:\r\n\r\n\r\nEuphorbia Prostrata as a remedy for the bite of venomous animals.\r\n\r\nBY MAJOR EDWARD PREISS.\r\n\r\n                                       Mazatlan, January 7th, 1865.\r\n\r\n    ...I send you herewith a sample of Gollindrinera, (Spanish,)\r\n    _Euphorbia prostrata_, (Linn.) It is found growing in the\r\n    territories of New Mexico and Arizona, in the United States,\r\n    and the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa, in Mexico. In Jalisco\r\n    this plant is more scarce, and occurs mostly in a poor\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\n    It thrives in hard, sandy or stony soil, and therefore is most\r\n    frequently found on roadsides, in the streets of villages and\r\n    in house-yards. In Mazatlan I found a plant with branches,\r\n    measuring two feet.\r\n\r\n    It is a remedy against the bites of snakes and other venomous\r\n    animals.\r\n\r\n    During my voyage in New Mexico, I camped on the 5th of June,\r\n    1864, at noon, between Cubera and Pawate, near a waterhole. A\r\n    Pueblo-Indian approached me, and entered into a conversation.\r\n    He could read and write Spanish, and was very well versed on\r\n    the map of the country. Noticing a snake in the waterhole, I\r\n    asked him whether there were many rattlesnakes in those parts,\r\n    to which he gave an affirmative answer. On questioning him\r\n    whether Indians frequently died from snake-bites, he answered:\r\n    “No, as they have an antidote against the poison.” At my\r\n    request, accompanied by a gift of some cigarritos, he brought\r\n    me a plant, which he gathered from the roadside, and which he\r\n    called “Gollindrinera.” He told me that nobody ever died, not\r\n    even from the bite of a rattlesnake, if this plant was applied\r\n    in time. At the same time he told how it was used.\r\n\r\n    In Mexico I also found the country people well acquainted with\r\n    the property of this plant. They apply it when their domestic\r\n    animals are injured by venomous amphibia or insects.\r\n\r\n    The branches and roots of this plant contain a quantity of\r\n    a milky sap. This is obtained by pounding and squeezing the\r\n    plant, and is given to the patient in doses of about one\r\n    drachm. The remaining fibres of the pressed-out plant are\r\n    externally applied on the wound. The dose is repeated every\r\n    hour,—or in aggravated cases, every half hour,—until the\r\n    patient feels relieved; which will occur in a few hours. The\r\n    external application must be frequently renewed.\r\n\r\n    I ascertained from reliable authority, that two dogs, being\r\n    bitten by rattlesnakes, were cured, one after four, and the\r\n    other after six repetitions of the dose. The poultice was\r\n    frequently changed. Both dogs were perfectly restored within\r\n    twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n                                           Tepic, March 28th, 1865.\r\n\r\n    ...Myself and companion arrived on the 14th of March, 1865,\r\n    at 3 o’clock P. M., at San Blas. In the evening, our faces,\r\n    necks and hands were badly bitten by myriads of sandflies. The\r\n    sting of these flies is exceedingly painful, and the effects of\r\n    them last for several days. Every person visiting San Blas will\r\n    not easily forget these insects; each sting produces a reddish\r\n    swelling, which hardens after awhile, and sometimes remains for\r\n    eight days and more. We left San Blas on the 15th of March, at\r\n    1.30 A. M., and arrived at 5 P. M. at Tepic. The fly-bites were\r\n    excruciatingly painful. On the 16th we used liquid ammoniac to\r\n    allay our suffering, but without result. In the forenoon of\r\n    the 17th I found two small Gollindrinera plants in the streets\r\n    of Tepic; I pulled it, roots and all, from the ground, broke\r\n    them into several parts, and rubbed the milky juice over my\r\n    sores. In half an hour all the pain had left. Not being able\r\n    to find any more of the plants, my companion had to suffer for\r\n    several days longer; which proves, however, that my relief from\r\n    the tormenting pain was directly to be credited to the medical\r\n    virtue of the Gollindrinera.\r\n\r\n    During my lengthened stay among the natives of Australia,\r\n    I observed that no black man ever died from the bite of\r\n    a venomous reptile,—excepting always the dead-adder,\r\n    (bothrops)—while a white man seldom escaped death. The remedy\r\n    of the blacks is very simple, consisting merely in sucking\r\n    out the wound, and in keeping awake the patient for at least\r\n    twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The dead adder (bothrops)\r\n    of Australia is probably the most poisonous reptile. A black\r\n    man, if bitten by this snake, will be abandoned to death by his\r\n    friends, they being sure that help is out of the question. I\r\n    witnessed once the death of a victim of the dead-adder.\r\n\r\n    I read in an Australian paper, that a white boy, who was bitten\r\n    in the finger by a dead-adder, had so much presence of mind, as\r\n    to chop it off with his pocket-knife. The finger had afterwards\r\n    to be regularly amputated, but the boy’s life was saved.\r\n\r\nAn interesting discussion occurred as to the characteristics of various\r\nspecies of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 3D, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: Col.

I.\r\n\r\n    Having read an interesting paper by Dr. Blake, in a late number\r\n    of the _Proceedings California Academy_, on the proofs of a\r\n    recent elevation of the coast of California, it occurred to\r\n    me that I had in my note book, information unpublished on the\r\n    same subject. As it lies within the field occupied by your\r\n    Academy, I furnish it herewith for publication. My information\r\n    was gathered from a Journal kept by Lieut. Griswold,[11] (a\r\n    young gentleman of scientific taste, and a close and accurate\r\n    observer,) during a cruise off the west coast of Mexico, in\r\n    search of guano. Among the islands visited, was “Clipperton\r\n    Rock,” which is the locality I refer to.\r\n\r\n    Before giving any extract, I will state what was known of the\r\n    island.\r\n\r\n    It is situated in Lat. 10° 17’ N., Long. 109° 19’ W., and was\r\n    discovered by Capt. Clipperton, in 1705. He appears to have\r\n    sighted only the tall volcanic rock, which stands near the\r\n    south end of the island, and passed on without learning of the\r\n    existence of the island. It appears not to have been noticed\r\n    again for more than a century, so that its position, and even\r\n    its existence was doubted.\r\n\r\n    The only published account of its having been visited\r\n    since, are those by Capt. Benj. Morrell[12] and Sir Edward\r\n    Belcher.[13] The former called there during a sealing voyage,\r\n    in 1825, and gives a meagre account of it in a few lines,\r\n    remarking, that “it produces a little shrubbery and some coarse\r\n    grass, among which, I think, fresh water might be found by\r\n    digging. Among the few vegetable productions of this island,\r\n    we found a plant resembling sarsaparilla, which badly poisoned\r\n    several of the crew who handled it.”\r\n\r\n    Sir Edward Belcher, during his surveying expedition, wishing\r\n    to verify the existence and position of the island, searched\r\n    and found it. He did not land, but gives the result of his\r\n    examination from the mast-head. With other remarks, he states\r\n    that “it is a coral lagoon island, three miles long N. and\r\n    S., and the same E. and W. There are two entrances, both on\r\n    the weather side, which at high-water may be safe, but at the\r\n    moment we passed, the surf was too heavy and the reflux showed\r\n    the rocks bare. On the beach several large trees were observed,\r\n    but no living trees were seen.” (May 8, 1839.)\r\n\r\n    Lieutenant Griswold notes in his journal, as follows: “On the\r\n    6th of August, 1861, we lay on our oars, just outside the\r\n    breakers on the N. E. side. At half past six we were ashore,\r\n    shooting in on a high roller, which left us high and dry upon\r\n    the beach, with a hole stove in our bow. The beach was covered\r\n    with drift wood, and while the crew were collecting it, I\r\n    started to examine the island.\r\n\r\n    “Upon every side it is girdled by a broad barrier of coral,\r\n    about fifteen feet above the level of the ocean. There is no\r\n    entrance to the lagoon, neither does it communicate with the\r\n    ocean by subterranean passages, as the water inside is _fresh_\r\n    and _potable_. It is slightly brackish, but will appease\r\n    thirst. The ‘ROCK’ is a ragged pile of volcanic formation, on\r\n    the south end of the island, gray and splashed over with the\r\n    deposit of the birds. It is cracked and split in every possible\r\n    direction, here and there shooting into tottering pinnacles.\r\n    As you wander through the caverns and clefts, with which it is\r\n    perforated, there is an incessant splashing and dropping of\r\n    water. On the very topmost pinnacle, which I reached after\r\n    a hard climb, I found a little basin containing a couple of\r\n    buckets full. The caverns were dreary looking places, dark and\r\n    wet, and echoing to the hoarse cries of the sea-birds. The\r\n    rock, on its sides, is rounded and smoothed by the action of\r\n    the waves, at some long past time, and in many places ‘_the\r\n    walls are crusted with coral_.’\r\n\r\n    “The highest pinnacle of the rock is about 120 feet high, and\r\n    it covers, I should think, about two acres. It stands on the\r\n    edge of the lagoon, or rather within it, being connected with\r\n    the coral barrier only by a narrow isthmus of coral clinker.\r\n    Between this rock and the sea, however, the barrier, instead of\r\n    being as elsewhere, a solid platform of coral, is only a heap\r\n    of fragments, piled in winrows by the waves, 250 or 300 yards\r\n    in width. The lagoon is a quiet fresh water pond, two miles\r\n    long and about one broad, with a long spit of mud running out\r\n    into the middle of it, but elsewhere of a light green color,\r\n    which seemed to indicate a considerable depth. Its shores are\r\n    abrupt, the coral platform in most places projecting out over\r\n    water of a considerable depth. I did not find the least sign of\r\n    vegetable life upon the island.\r\n\r\n    “The only plant[14] seen, grew in considerable quantities in\r\n    the lagoon, which I pulled out of the water, where it was\r\n    growing. There is nothing but a coral platform, coral clinker\r\n    and coral sand. We found nothing to detain us and left the\r\n    island on the afternoon of the day on which we landed.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Darwin, on his remarks on the geographical distribution of\r\n    reef-building corals, states that he could find no evidence\r\n    of their living on or near the west coast of America, and\r\n    consequently discredits the statement made by Sir Edward\r\n    Belcher; for after examining a Ms. chart of Clipperton Rock,\r\n    at the Admiralty Office, drawn by Sir Edward, came to the\r\n    conclusion that it was more of the shape of a crater. The\r\n    Island is, however, a true Atoll and has been elevated at least\r\n    100 feet.\r\n\r\n    It must have been closed since 1839, and the freshening of the\r\n    water has probably been caused by rain.\r\n\r\n    We may also add, that it stands within the limits of reef\r\n    building corals, as deduced by Mr. Dana, from tables of the\r\n    temperature of the sea, and consequently is confirmatory of his\r\n    opinion.\r\n\r\n    We might add other facts in support of Mr. Dana’s theory, but\r\n    from other parts of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n    [11] Lieut.

Dr. Behr stated that the Esquimaux could\r\nbe considered only as a kind of Indians, their language being of the same\r\nstructure, and their different habits were owing to physical influences.\r\nHe further stated, that the Esquimaux lived formerly farther south. Mr.\r\nKennicott remarked, that from his observations and information derived\r\nfrom Madam Roshkin and from St. Zagoshins’ Report, he believed the\r\nnatives, for some hundreds of miles up the Kvichpak or Yonkon River, were\r\nEsquimaux rather than Indians.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey stated, that he found on a trip to the Yosemite Valley, a\r\nplant that he described twenty years ago, and which he had not since seen\r\nin the collections examined by him. He named the plant, finding it to\r\nbe a new genus _Kelloggia_; the plant is quite common in the valley and\r\nvicinity, and belongs to the family of Rubiaceæ; the aspect of the plant\r\nis, in regard to its ramification, much like that of a _Galium_, while\r\nits leaves and their arrangement resemble an _Epilobium_. It was first\r\ndiscovered by some member of Com. Wilke’s Expedition, somewhere along or\r\nnear the Sacramento River.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey also stated that he found _Sarcodes Sanguinea_, (Torrey), the\r\nSnow-plant of the Californians, to be apparently indifferent as to what\r\nplant it fixes itself or derives its nourishment from; he found its fibre\r\npenetrating into the root of a _Rumex_, and not as has been supposed into\r\nthe roots of _Sequoia gigantea_. He also spoke of the great beauty and\r\nfragrance of the California White Lily, (_Lilium Washingtonianum_,) and\r\nof its being quite common in the vicinity of the Yosemite Valley. Its\r\nhabits are much like that of the common white lily, (_Lilium candidum_).\r\n\r\nThis evening, at 7 o’clock, a magnificent rainbow was observed, the\r\ncolors of which were unusually vivid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JULY 17TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen members present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 7TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine members present: Dr. C.

The highland Grama, growing\r\n    upon the sand “mesas,” or highlands, seems to differ but\r\n    little, if any, from that found in some portions of California.\r\n\r\n    No. 3. (_Muhlenbergia pungeus_, Thurb.) Black Grama, or, “Grama\r\n    China,” as vulgarly called by the natives, is the most valuable\r\n    as feed; upon it animals will fatten. It grows on the highlands\r\n    in sandy arid soil. I have never met any of this variety in the\r\n    valley of the Colorado, and but very little in the territory of\r\n    New Mexico. At this post we have had as many as 700 animals,\r\n    and the scarcity of forage required us to herd our stock upon\r\n    this grass during the winter. We were often obliged to make\r\n    rapid and distant marches in pursuit of Indians, over a country\r\n    almost impassable, yet our horses stood it well, fed only upon\r\n    this grass. Our cavalry here had no grain during the entire\r\n    winter. This Grama, like the other species, grows in bunches\r\n    several feet apart, and the lower stalks are green during the\r\n    winter season.\r\n\r\n    No. 4. (_Sporobolus airoides_, Trin.) This grows in the\r\n    valleys. A great portion of the Gila Valley is covered with it.\r\n    Animals eat it readily when green; it is however a powerful\r\n    diuretic. As a winter grass it is of no account.\r\n\r\n    Besides these four enumerated grasses, the letter contained\r\n    three others from the same locality:\r\n\r\n    1. _Panicum capillare_, L.\r\n\r\n    2. _Tricuspis pulchella_, Kunth.\r\n\r\n    3. _A Poa_, much of the habitat of _Poa sudetica_. Vivid\r\n    green; leaves plane, rather large; spikelets four-flowered,\r\n    oval; lower glume one, and the upper three nerved; lower palea\r\n    distinctly three-nerved, scabrous on the Red nerve. The nerves\r\n    of the glumes, as well as of the lower palea, are of a vivid\r\n    green color, and exceedingly prominent. The whole aspect of the\r\n    plant sent, would rather suggest that it is not indigenous to\r\n    that section of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, SEPTEMBER 4TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Minns in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: A paper on the origin and formation of\r\nPrairies, by Leo Lesquereux; Report of the Vancouver Island Exploration,\r\n1864; Review of American Birds, by Prof. S.

P. Blake:\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on the abundance of Iron Ore in Northern Arizona.\r\n\r\nBY WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    In 1863 I observed an iron formation of considerable extent\r\n    and interest upon and near the William’s Fork of the Colorado,\r\n    near its mouth. The ore is chiefly the micaceous variety of\r\n    Hematite, or “specular iron,” and occurs in thick beds and in\r\n    thin sheets, in a ferruginous limestone or dolomite, evidently\r\n    metamorphic, and tilted up at a high angle.\r\n\r\n    It forms a belt of peculiar appearance, that may be traced\r\n    by the eye for miles across the country, in a direction\r\n    a few degrees south of west. This rock and iron ore is\r\n    inter-stratified with chloritic and talcose slates and granite,\r\n    and the series also bears copper ores and gold.\r\n\r\n    From the collections made by Lieut. Whipple’s party, in 1853,\r\n    in the mountains north, it would appear, that similar rocks\r\n    exist in the Cerbat and Aquarius Mountains, the extreme\r\n    geological antiquity of which, was commented on by me in the\r\n    Pacific R. R. Reports, Vol. III, p. 59. It is possible that\r\n    this ferriferous formation is connected with the extensive iron\r\n    formation of the coast of Mexico, south of Acapulco, described\r\n    by Mr. Manross, (Am. Journ. Sci., XXXIX, 358,) and it may be of\r\n    pre-Silurian date.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescriptions of New Marine Shells from the Coast of California.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nBY PHILIP P. CARPENTER, B. A., PH.

BOLANDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—Localities given with two !! I have not visited myself. I\r\n    would also further remark that I am by no means sure of having\r\n    correctly determined the two oaks—_Quercus Douglasii_ and\r\n    _Garryana_.\r\n\r\n    It may not be altogether amiss to offer some observations on\r\n    the distribution and value, as specimens, of some of our trees\r\n    which I have met with on my various trips over a portion of\r\n    this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _Pinus Sabiniana_, Dougl. (Digger Pine.)\r\n\r\n    Invariably disposed over south-hillsides of the interior,\r\n    occupying the driest expositions—Mount Diablo! Russian River\r\n    Valley! Geysers! Auburn and Forest Hill! San José Valley! Near\r\n    Mission San Antonio!! Mountains east of San Diego!!\r\n\r\n    As to its value there are a great many contradictory assertions\r\n    made by farmers; some assert it yields an excellent wood for\r\n    yokes and similar objects, while others denounce it as entirely\r\n    useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _Pinus Lambertiana_, Dougl. (Sugar Pine.)\r\n\r\n    Pine Mountains near Geysers! Near Cloverdale! Forest Hill!\r\n    Mountains east of San Diego!! Generally with _Pinus ponderosa_\r\n    in groves, occupying the damper localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _Pinus ponderosa_, Dougl. (Yellow Pine.)\r\n\r\n    Russian River Valley! south of Clear Lake! Geysers! Auburn and\r\n    Forest Hill! San José Valley! Blue Mountains!! (Mr. Dunn) Rocky\r\n    Mountains!! New Mexico!!\r\n\r\n\r\n    4. _Pinus insignis_. Dougl. (Monterey Pine.)\r\n\r\n    Monterey! Carmelo Valley!\r\n\r\n    This species covers many thousand acres of land near and by\r\n    Monterey and Carmelo, forming quite an extensive forest along\r\n    the coast between these two places. Height, sixty to one\r\n    hundred feet, and one to three feet diameter; outline very\r\n    irregular, consisting often of only a few rigid spreading\r\n    branches; foliage dense and of a vivid green color; cones\r\n    persistent, often from ten to nineteen whorls; bark very thick\r\n    and rimose. Wood extremely resinous and rather coarse-grained;\r\n    excellent for street planks, bridges, and floors. At present it\r\n    is no more in the market as lumber; the good timber has been\r\n    all cut, and the saw-mill removed.\r\n\r\n    Considering that there is, besides this species, only _Pinus\r\n    muricata_ growing in that forest, which could not be confounded\r\n    with the species in question—it is certainly most singular\r\n    to meet with so many synonyms for it. _Pinus radiata_, Don.;\r\n    _Pinus Sinclairii_ and _Pinus tuberculata_, provided this\r\n    last should not prove to be a good species. It is the more\r\n    astonishing since trees and cones are of great conformity\r\n    throughout the entire forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. _Pinus tuberculata_, Don.\r\n\r\n    Santa Cruz! Ukiah! Oakland hills! Forest Hill! Eureka!!\r\n\r\n    In all these localities, it is a small tree, from twenty to\r\n    thirty feet high, and from six to fourteen inches in diameter.\r\n    It retains its lowest branches, which spread generally very\r\n    much, often horizontally. The foliage seems to me less dense\r\n    and less vivid-green, than that of the preceding. Young\r\n    trees raised here, side by side, show the same differential\r\n    characters. The cones from all these different localities are\r\n    very uniform, and differ essentially from those of _Pinus\r\n    insignis_ at Monterey. The seeds, however, resemble each\r\n    other very much. Both species grow near the coast, but on\r\n    different soil. _Pinus insignis_, on a soil produced by the\r\n    disintegration of a bituminous slate and granite; _Pinus\r\n    tuberculata_, in all the above-mentioned localities, on a\r\n    soil derived from metamorphosed sandstone. Should these two\r\n    species be definitely united, after a thorough investigation,\r\n    they would afford a most striking example of the influence\r\n    of a different soil. It is certainly singular to find such a\r\n    well-characterized form restricted to one locality only. This\r\n    fact, however, would not stand isolated with us here; _Abies\r\n    bracteata_, we find similarly confined to one locality only in\r\n    California. Isolation is more or less a characteristic feature\r\n    with all our trees, and there is probably no country where the\r\n    influences of soil, climate, and exposition are so well and\r\n    abruptly marked and unmistakably defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. _Pinus muricata_, Don.\r\n\r\n    Monterey! Mendocino City!\r\n\r\n    In a moist depression at Monterey, I found a small group of\r\n    this species, averaging about fifteen feet in height, and five\r\n    to six inches in diameter. Bark reddish and nearly smooth;\r\n    branches almost at a right angle with the main axis and\r\n    generally from five to seven in a whorl; leaves of a darker\r\n    vivid green, and more succulent and longer, than those of\r\n    _Pinus insignis_, of which there were trees of the same size by\r\n    the side of it; cones from three to seven, in a whorl very much\r\n    aggregated and clustered. I counted seventeen whorls on a tree\r\n    fifteen feet high. The lower portion of the trunk was clad with\r\n    dead leaves.\r\n\r\n    At the same distance (about two miles) from the ocean, and\r\n    scarcely a mile from the above-mentioned depression, I found\r\n    another group (mixed with _Cupressus macrocarpa_) in a deeper\r\n    but drier locality. Here the tree was altogether of a different\r\n    aspect, inferior in all its parts. This very transition\r\n    suggested strongly, that this pine and the one previously seen\r\n    on the plains near Mendocino City, on a similar soil, might be\r\n    of the same species.\r\n\r\n    Near Mendocino City, on the so-called plains, I found in great\r\n    abundance a small pine tree, which I refer for the present to\r\n    this species.\r\n\r\n    Height, five to twenty feet, but the greater number averaged\r\n    only from five to fifteen feet. Only one tree which I noticed\r\n    which was fifty-five inches in circumference, and twenty to\r\n    twenty-five feet in height. It had a flattish top with the\r\n    branches very much imbricated and so completely covered with\r\n    cones, that it was really difficult to discover its foliage.\r\n    But this tree was very exceptional, compared with the mass of\r\n    little trees covering the plains. These had in general upright\r\n    branches with numerous and slender branchlets; leaves shorter,\r\n    denser, and of a darker green than _Pinus contorta_? which\r\n    grows with it and is a larger tree altogether; bark reddish,\r\n    very thin, exhaling a strong resinous odor, and but slightly\r\n    rimose; cones two to four inches long (curved when long) and\r\n    scarcely an inch thick, mostly in pairs, but sometimes in\r\n    threes, reflexed. I counted fifteen sets of cones on a tree\r\n    fifteen feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n    7. _Pinus contorta_, Dougl.?\r\n\r\n    Head of Tomales Bay! Mendocino City!\r\n\r\n    Its manner of growth resembles that of _Pinus insignis_ very\r\n    much. It attains the same height, has the same irregular\r\n    spreading branches, the same thick rimose bark and very\r\n    resinous wood. The leaves are invariably in pairs and slightly\r\n    silvery on the lower surface. The cones are scarcely two inches\r\n    long with mostly reflex pedicles (umbo) on the slightly gibbous\r\n    side and persistent for a great number of years.\r\n\r\n    From the River Albin to Mendocino City, it grows quite near\r\n    the coast on a fertile and undulating plain, gently descending\r\n    towards the ocean. At Mendocino City I found it to extend all\r\n    over the plains about eight miles eastward.\r\n\r\n    Whether this species is identical with _Pinus contorta_ or\r\n    not I am unable to decide. Observations made by Mr. Geo. Wm.\r\n    Dunn, on his recent travels through the Blue and Siskiyou\r\n    mountains, have rather a tendency to show that _Pinus contorta_\r\n    is altogether a different tree. I can state, however, most\r\n    positively that this species cannot be confounded with _Pinus\r\n    muricata_. Both species are two-leaved, but in every other\r\n    respect they differ widely. The object of these remarks is\r\n    only to point out the different species, met in my travels,\r\n    and not to decide which name should have precedence. Murray’s\r\n    discussion on the distribution of our Pines, in his “Notes\r\n    on California Trees,” has not “struck” me as being so very\r\n    correct. Endlicher, in his Synopsis Coniferarum, makes _Pinus\r\n    muricata_ a Taeda, which is also incorrect; it is a true\r\n    Pinaster. It remains to decide only, whether the species at\r\n    Mendocino City is _P. contorta_, or _P. Murrayana_, Balf.\r\n\r\n\r\n    8. _Libocedrus decurrens_, Torr. (California White Cedar.)\r\n\r\n    Forest Hill! (forming quite a large woods there). Rancheria\r\n    Creek! Mendocino County. East of Salinas River, Monterey\r\n    County. Dr. Canfield. East of San Diego!!\r\n\r\n    On the banks of Rancheria Creek, in the south-western part of\r\n    Mendocino County, I found a small colony of this handsome tree.\r\n    The largest were about forty to sixty feet high and two to\r\n    three feet in diameter. Judging from the young after-growth,\r\n    the tree seems likely to spread. I was informed that this\r\n    is the only place in the county where it is to be found. In\r\n    the latter part of September (1865) the tree had its aments\r\n    strongly developed. Cones decidedly pendulous.\r\n\r\n\r\n    9. _Cupressus macrocarpa_, Hartw. (Monterey Cypress.)\r\n\r\n    Monterey! Tamal Pais (2,700 feet)! Mendocino City! and\r\n    south-east of Clear Lake!\r\n\r\n    This species seems to be extremely variable. At Monterey, about\r\n    two miles from the coast, I saw, upon exposed granite rocks,\r\n    but slightly disintegrated, specimens only six inches high,\r\n    bearing perfect cones. Going westward, at the same distance\r\n    from the ocean, I found specimens in a depression associated\r\n    with _Pinus muricata_, from ten to fifteen feet high, full with\r\n    cones; and extending my walk to Cypress Point, a distance of\r\n    three to four miles, I was surprised to find a large grove of\r\n    this species, containing mostly large trees of great beauty\r\n    and perfection. The average height may be from forty to sixty\r\n    feet, and as they were (right at the point) almost all alike in\r\n    thickness, I measured but three, finding their circumference\r\n    to be one hundred and nineteen, one hundred and four, and one\r\n    hundred and twenty inches, about four feet above the ground.\r\n    At this point these trees are almost daily enveloped in a\r\n    dense fog. Their branches are very densely imbricated and\r\n    depressed, retaining the moisture to such an extent that the\r\n    thick clusters of cones are quite mouldy. Between the cones and\r\n    little dense branchlets settles a great deal of rubbish, which\r\n    is almost dripping wet. It is undoubtedly owing to this very\r\n    fact that so many seeds of this species, collected there, prove\r\n    abortive.\r\n\r\n    Seeing so great a variation at Monterey, I do not hesitate to\r\n    refer all specimens, seen at the other localities mentioned\r\n    above, to this species at present.\r\n\r\n    On the plain near Mendocino City, that species exhibited about\r\n    the same gradations, although not so strikingly as at Monterey.\r\n\r\n\r\n    10. _Torreya Californica_, Torr. (California Nutmeg.)\r\n\r\n    Paper Mill! Marin County. Ukiah! Mendocino City! Forest Hill!\r\n\r\n    Generally dispersed, only at Ukiah I found quite a group of\r\n    this species. Wood valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    11. _Taxus brevifolia_, Nutt. (California Yew-Tree.)\r\n\r\n    Devil’s Cañon, near Forest Hill! A handsome tree, twenty to\r\n    thirty feet high, with extremely slender and drooping branches.\r\n    Dispersed but plenty.\r\n\r\n    Wood valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n    12. _Quercus agrifolia_, Nées. (Live Oak.)\r\n\r\n    Oakland! Banks of Sacramento River! Clear Lake! Russian River\r\n    Valley! Anderson Valley! Monterey!\r\n\r\n    Foliage extremely variable. On river banks and in expositions\r\n    close to the coast, where it is almost daily enveloped in\r\n    fogs, this species exhibits quite a uniformity; the figure of\r\n    _Quercus oxyadenia_ in Sitgreaves’ Report represents this form\r\n    of it very well. In the valleys of the interior the shape of\r\n    the leaves of one and the same tree is very different. Some\r\n    have entire margins, while others have them pretty deeply\r\n    dentated, often one side is entire and the other dentate.\r\n    Some trees occur of which the young shoots have the leaves\r\n    “coarsely sinuate-toothed, or obliquely sinuate-toothed;\r\n    teeth very sharply acute with a broad base, cuspidate-awned,”\r\n    and thus agree with Dr. Kellogg’s _Quercus Morehus_—while\r\n    the older branches have much smaller and entire leaves. In\r\n    Anderson Valley I saw several trees whose entire foliage agrees\r\n    admirably with Dr. Kellogg’s. Had I not seen that tree on the\r\n    shore of Borax Lake exhibiting both forms, I should be inclined\r\n    to call it a good species. The cups of the acorns of these\r\n    trees have the scales long and loosely imbricated, and the\r\n    acorn is almost entirely immerged; but this is also the case\r\n    with those of some trees that have a far different foliage.\r\n    Thus far I have not been able to find good, distinctive,\r\n    reliable characters. There are transitions in all parts, even\r\n    on the same tree. As the tree has the habit of growing in\r\n    groups, one might suppose that trees of one group, at least,\r\n    should show a uniformity in botanical characters; this is not\r\n    so: just the very extremes may be found in one and the same\r\n    group. This phenomenon I observed throughout the whole length\r\n    of Anderson Valley, a distance of some eighteen miles. On dry\r\n    gravelly hillsides in the interior this tree presents still\r\n    another form: _Quercus Wislizeni_, Englm.\r\n\r\n    The acorns ripen annually and differ also essentially in shape\r\n    and size. Soil, climate, and exposition, offer in this case\r\n    no satisfactory explanation for so great a variation in one\r\n    species. Should it not be attributed to intrinsic peculiarities?\r\n\r\n\r\n    13. _Quercus Garryana_, Hook. (White Oak.)\r\n\r\n    On dry easterly hillsides and in valleys on a poor buff-colored\r\n    clay. Santa Rosa Valley! Clear Lake! Searsville! Anderson\r\n    Valley! San José Valley!\r\n\r\n    Exposition and soil agree in all these localities.\r\n\r\n    The bark of this tree is rather thin, whitish, and less\r\n    coarsely rimose than any other of the Californian oaks. It is\r\n    always a flat-topped, middle-sized tree, apparently of a very\r\n    slow, almost stunted, growth. The whitish bark of trunk and\r\n    branches, the glaucous foliage, and the light-green color of\r\n    the acorns, which it yields, however, quite sparingly, give\r\n    this tree, compared with other oaks especially, quite a pale\r\n    and hoary appearance.\r\n\r\n    Farmers consider the fine-grained wood of this oak very\r\n    valuable for many farming implements. It ranks highest among\r\n    our oaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n    14. _Quercus Douglasii_, Hook. (Pale Oak.)\r\n\r\n    Anderson Valley!\r\n\r\n    The general aspect and habit of this tree resembles very much\r\n    that of _Quercus lobata_, with which it grows in the low, flat\r\n    portions of Anderson Valley. Its branchlets, however, are\r\n    short, rigid, and erect, while those of _Qu. lobata_ are mostly\r\n    drooping. In fall, when laden with acorns, it presents a very\r\n    striking difference by having its rather pale acorns densely\r\n    aggregated and clustered at the extremities of the branchlets,\r\n    resting, as it were, on the dark-green leaves. At a distance\r\n    it may be mistaken for a full-bearing apple tree. It increases\r\n    rapidly in number in Anderson Valley from south to north,\r\n    outnumbering almost every other oak at the lower end of the\r\n    valley. Its wood ranks next to that of _Quercus Douglasii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    15. _Quercus lobata_, Nées. (Burr-Oak.)\r\n\r\n    The most common and largest oak in all the valleys of\r\n    the interior of California. Thus far, I never found it\r\n    on a hillside. It is this mighty oak, with its peculiar,\r\n    gracefully-drooping branchlets, that gives character to the\r\n    landscape of the Californian valleys. It is especially noted\r\n    for its very long acorns; but they do not always attain that\r\n    large size, and are never so conspicuously arranged as those\r\n    of _Qu. Garryana_; they are usually in pairs. It may also be\r\n    stated that this tree forms, on an average, about the longest\r\n    trunk of Californian foliaceous trees. The acorns of this\r\n    species form a principal part of the food of the Indians. On\r\n    the Coast Range they seem to give, however, preference to those\r\n    of _Quercus Sonomensis_. The wood ranks next to that of the\r\n    preceding species.\r\n\r\n    These above-mentioned three species of oaks, belonging to\r\n    the section of white oaks, are surely distinct. I met with\r\n    no transitions thus far. They may be distinguished at a\r\n    distance; every farmer distinguishes them, for there is quite a\r\n    difference in the quality of the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n    16. _Quercus Sonomensis_, Benth. (Black Oak.)\r\n\r\n    San Diego!! Anderson Valley! Auburn!\r\n\r\n    Eastern and northern hillsides in the Coast Ranges. It also\r\n    occupies the more easterly-situated flats, among the redwoods,\r\n    wherever they are too dry for redwood. Very seldom it is found\r\n    in the valley; and when found, it occupies that portion of it\r\n    which is adjacent to the hillsides, where there is generally\r\n    a gravelly soil. It is always a middle-sized tree, having\r\n    mostly numerous erect branches arranged like those of _Acer\r\n    saccharinum_. In fall it sheds its leaves, which become\r\n    buff-colored, before any other of our deciduous oaks. The wood\r\n    of this tree is of a poor quality; used for fuel only.\r\n\r\n\r\n    17. _Quercus chrysolepis_, Liebm. (Drooping Live Oak.)\r\n\r\n    The most rare of all our oaks; it bears acorns but seldom,\r\n    and even then very sparingly. I have not been able to satisfy\r\n    myself whether they are biannual or not, but I am rather\r\n    inclined to believe they are. Northern slopes near Cloverdale!\r\n    in Anderson Valley! and near Forest Hill! Tree 30-40 feet high,\r\n    with a rather smooth whitish bark, and mostly long, slender,\r\n    drooping branches; evergreen. Of the quality of its wood I\r\n    could not learn anything from settlers. The tree being rare,\r\n    and occupying always moist slopes along gulches, it is not\r\n    often cut down.\r\n\r\n\r\n    18. _Quercus densiflora_, Hook. (Chestnut Oak.)\r\n\r\n    Along the Coast Range, associated with the redwood, increasing\r\n    northwards; from Santa Cruz to Mendocino City, at least, it\r\n    occurs only in or close by the redwoods. This tree attains\r\n    rather a large height in dense woods, and is then but sparingly\r\n    branched. Leaves and acorns very considerable. Its wood is\r\n    absolutely useless; it is very coarse grained, and like the\r\n    redwood wet like a sponge when cut; it is extremely perishable.\r\n    At Mendocino City log-men call it Water Oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n    19. _Castanea chrysophylla_, Dougl. (Chestnut.)\r\n\r\n    On the Oakland hills this species is but 3-6 feet high;\r\n    blooms about the fourth of July, like the Eastern _Castanea\r\n    vesca_, and bears perfect fruit. On the so-called plains at\r\n    Mendocino City, however, it is a large tree, averaging from\r\n    50-125 feet in height, and 2-3 feet in diameter. Those trees\r\n    were completely covered with blossoms on the twenty-third of\r\n    September, 1865; settlers say they never found its fruit. Here,\r\n    on the Oakland hills, it grows only on the outcropping of a\r\n    white friable slate, destitute of all vegetable remains; at the\r\n    Mendocino plains it is found to grow on a cemented gravel, upon\r\n    which the water rests for some months after the rainy season.\r\n    The supply of an aerial moisture during the dry season is in\r\n    favor of the Oakland hills, judging by the lichenose vegetation\r\n    of the two localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    20. _Sequoia sempervirens_, Endl. (Redwood.)\r\n\r\n    This mighty tree belongs exclusively to the foggy regions of\r\n    the Coast Ranges and the underlying metamorphic sandstone,\r\n    for wherever either of these conditions is wanting, this tree\r\n    does not exist. From the northern boundary line of the State\r\n    down to the head of Tomales Bay it forms a continual forest,\r\n    increasing in width northward. At Tomales Bay the chain is\r\n    interrupted by a small bed of lime-rock. The interruption\r\n    extending from the lower foot-hills of Tamalpais down to\r\n    Belmont, is undoubtedly owing to the lowness of the hills. A\r\n    connecting link is found, however, on the Oakland hills. That\r\n    grove of redwoods, now almost entirely destroyed, affords the\r\n    strongest evidences of the dependency of that species on the\r\n    prevalence of heavy mists. From Belmont to a few miles below\r\n    Santa Cruz is another narrow continuous chain, occupying\r\n    mainly the leesides of the most western ranges and the deeper\r\n    gulches eastward. From near the mouth of Salinas River to the\r\n    head of Carmelo Valley, another long interruption is caused\r\n    by a bituminous slate. The absence of redwood in this long\r\n    interval can hardly be ascribed to any other cause, for it is\r\n    known that Monterey and the adjacent regions are subject to\r\n    heavier fogs than Santa Cruz. _Pinus insignis_ and _Cupressus\r\n    macrocarpa_ occupy here those portions naturally belonging to\r\n    the redwood and _Tsuga Douglasii_. Further south, from the head\r\n    of Carmelo Valley to San Luis Obispo, the most southern limit,\r\n    redwood occurs but sparingly, forming nowhere extensive groves.\r\n    Associated with the redwood we find _Tsuga Douglasii_, a tree\r\n    of a wide range, _Torreya Californica_, _Arbutus Menziesii_,\r\n    _Quercus densiflora_, and in Mendocino County _Abies grandis_\r\n    Dougl. There are also some shrubs and herbaceous plants truly\r\n    characteristic to them, the shrubs increasing as underwood\r\n    northward, belong mostly to the Ericaceous family. It is a\r\n    noteworthy fact that the arborescent growth of the leeside\r\n    of the first range of hills generally consists, almost\r\n    exclusively, of _Tsuga Douglasii_, and that this tree forms the\r\n    outskirt east and particularly westward. In Mendocino County\r\n    _Abies grandis_ unites with it for the same cause; there both\r\n    trees form a dense belt, facing the ocean, and are encroaching\r\n    fast on the redwood. In fact, the western portion of those\r\n    redwoods show this encroachment most strikingly by a total\r\n    absence of young redwood, and a dense, almost impenetrable,\r\n    undergrowth of the two-mentioned species. The order of things\r\n    is, however, reversed wherever the redwood has been cut.\r\n    Its roots are imperishable, and as soon as the tree is cut\r\n    they sprout and cover the soil rapidly to the exclusion of\r\n    every other species—none being of so rapid a growth. The\r\n    indestructibility of the roots prevents the clearing of such\r\n    land; even large trunks cut down cover themselves, within\r\n    two or three years, so completely with sprouts that they are\r\n    hardly seen. The entire after growth now found on the Oakland\r\n    hills, is owing solely to the indestructibility of its roots\r\n    and stumps. The tenacity of life in this species, which is\r\n    rather of rare occurrence in coniferous trees, shows itself\r\n    also in the resistance it offers to fire, so frequent in\r\n    those woods. Trees that have been bereft completely of their\r\n    branches by fire, covered themselves in a few years entirely\r\n    with young sprouts, giving the trunks the appearance of a\r\n    pillar, or remind one of those old trunks covered with _Rhus\r\n    toxicodendron_ in the East. Fire is destructive to the young\r\n    trees only; after they have obtained a thickness of two or\r\n    three feet they are not liable to perish.\r\n\r\n    Another great beneficial feature in this species is the great\r\n    power it possesses in condensing fogs and mists. A heavy fog\r\n    is always turned into a rain, wetting the soil and supplying\r\n    springs with water during the dry season. Springs in and near\r\n    the redwoods are never in want of a good supply of water, and\r\n    crops on the Coast Ranges are not liable to fail. The year\r\n    of 1864 has proved my assertion beyond doubt; this fact is\r\n    generally known—a great deal of land has been taken up since.\r\n    It is my firm conviction that if the redwoods are destroyed—and\r\n    they necessarily will be, if not protected by a wise action\r\n    of our Government—California will become a desert, in the\r\n    true sense of the word. In their safety depends the future\r\n    welfare of the State; they are our safeguard. It remains to\r\n    be seen whether we shall be benefited or not by the horrible\r\n    experience such countries as Asia Minor, Greece, Spain, and\r\n    France have made, by having barbarously destroyed their woods\r\n    and forests. But with us here it is even of a more serious\r\n    nature; wise governments would be able to replace them in those\r\n    countries, but no power on earth can restore the woods of\r\n    California when once completely destroyed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOVEMBER 6TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: Specimen of _Pinus ponderosa_, _Abies\r\nDouglasii_, _Taxus brevifolia_, _Larix occidentalis_, _Pteris aquilina_,\r\nand _Abies Menziesii_; presented by Mr. Dunn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 4TH, 1865.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven members present, and Mr. W.

BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    I am not aware that any notice has yet been taken by scientific\r\n    chemists of a peculiar substance, apparently a gum, which\r\n    accompanies the seeds of the great trees, and may be shaken\r\n    out of the dried cones. About twenty cones yielded me an ounce\r\n    of the material. It does not adhere to either the seeds or the\r\n    cone, but appears to have shrunk from both in drying. It falls\r\n    out in loose broken grains with brilliant conchoidal fractured\r\n    surfaces, and looks a little like dried blood. The color is\r\n    purplish-red, nearly black by reflected light, and a brilliant\r\n    carmine-red by transmitted.\r\n\r\n    The taste is strongly astringent, and suggests tannin; it is\r\n    somewhat bitter, and is similar also to that of very strong\r\n    black tea. It softens and becomes gummy between the teeth. It\r\n    dissolves completely in water and in ordinary alcohol, giving\r\n    a brilliant claret-colored solution which gradually darkens by\r\n    exposure to the air. The addition of carbonate of soda darkens\r\n    the solution and lime-water turns it black, giving a black\r\n    scaly precipitate. Dilute sulphuric acid reddens the solution\r\n    and causes a red precipitate.\r\n\r\n    It is in many respects similar to the _kino_ of the shops,\r\n    but has a brighter colored powder and streaks. The kino that\r\n    I have seen has a brownish-red streak; this substance gives a\r\n    purplish-red.\r\n\r\n    The reactions with alkalies and acids in respect to color are\r\n    similar to those of green redwood boards, which may be stained\r\n    as dark as rosewood by alkalies and red by acids.\r\n\r\n    This substance may be found to have some peculiar value in\r\n    pharmacy, or as a coloring matter for tinctures or wine. I hope\r\n    that this notice will induce a thorough investigation of its\r\n    nature and properties. If it proves to be new, I suggest that\r\n    it shall be known as _Sequonin_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmmonites in the Auriferous Slates of California.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM P.

Sci.\r\n\r\nBY W. H. DALL, ACTING DIRECTOR SCI. CORPS, W. U. T. EX.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bridges was born at Lilly in Hertfordshire, England, on the\r\n    twenty-second of May, 1807.\r\n\r\n    At an early age he became interested in Natural History, and\r\n    when about nineteen or twenty—having previously studied for\r\n    some three years under Sir William Hooker, at Kew Gardens—he\r\n    sailed for Valparaiso. He remained here or passed the time in\r\n    some of the adjoining provinces, from 1827 to 1844, when he\r\n    returned to England on a short visit. On again reaching South\r\n    America, he undertook the explorations in Bolivia, so well\r\n    known to naturalists, through their magnificent results. During\r\n    the course of this journey, in June, 1845, he discovered and\r\n    obtained seeds of the great South American Water Lily, the\r\n    _Victoria Regia_, Lindley. Although the plant had previously\r\n    been detected, to Mr. Bridges belonged the honor of first\r\n    introducing it into the old world, by transporting seeds which\r\n    subsequently germinated at Kew.\r\n\r\n    In 1846, he returned to England, where for many months he\r\n    was prostrated by severe illness contracted in his arduous\r\n    explorations.\r\n\r\n    In 1847, he was married to Miss Mary Benson, of Bristol,\r\n    England, a niece of the eminent collector, the late Hugh\r\n    Cuming. Soon after he proceeded again to Valparaiso.\r\n\r\n    In 1851, he visited and explored the island of Juan Fernandez.\r\n\r\n    In the report of Lieut. Herndon, U. S. N., on his explorations\r\n    of the Amazon, he acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Bridges,\r\n    for invaluable information furnished, in regard to the\r\n    head-waters of that river.\r\n\r\n    In 1855, he proceeded to Panama, remaining there some six\r\n    months; and from thence to England, subsequently to France, and\r\n    finally to California, where he arrived in November, 1856.\r\n\r\n    About 1857, he went to British Columbia, and remained nearly\r\n    two years, collecting and exploring. In the winter of 1858,\r\n    his family, hitherto in Europe, rejoined him. Since then San\r\n    Francisco has been his home, though travelling in many parts of\r\n    California.\r\n\r\n    In April, 1865, he undertook his ill-starred journey to\r\n    Nicaragua. His explorations here were limited principally to\r\n    the lake country, where he passed some five months exploring\r\n    the dense and tangled jungles of the vicinity; ascending the\r\n    volcanoes of Mombacho and Ometepec, and visiting Leon and\r\n    Granada. In June, he met at San Juan del Sur, our well-known\r\n    botanist, Dr. Torry, on his way to San Francisco. These two\r\n    kindred spirits passed several pleasant days together.\r\n\r\n    He left Nicaragua on the steamship Moses Taylor, Capt Blethen,\r\n    on the third of September, 1865, apparently in perfect\r\n    health. On the fifth, the effects of the insidious malaria\r\n    of the country were evident. On the ninth, he died; being\r\n    fifty-eight years old. On the seventeenth, the body arrived in\r\n    San Francisco, and was afterwards interred at Lone Mountain\r\n    Cemetery. He leaves a widow, two daughters, and three sons.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bridges was of a singularly retiring and modest\r\n    disposition, and very few publications of his own remain to\r\n    attest his devotion to Natural Science. But works in every\r\n    branch of study, particularly of Professor Lindley, and Sir\r\n    William Hooker, in the department of Botany, bear abundant\r\n    evidence of his untiring industry and unusual success.\r\n\r\n    That he died a martyr to his love for Natural History, there is\r\n    no room for doubt; and his most appropriate memorials are the\r\n    magnificent evergreens now adorning, through his agency, the\r\n    groves and avenues of the old world.\r\n\r\n    With all impartial naturalists, Mr. Bridges and such as he,\r\n    “who bear the burden and heat of the day,” are entitled to\r\n    honors; if not precisely of the same character as those due to\r\n    the students who in their comfortable libraries work up the\r\n    results of the collector, still to honors quite as high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JANUARY 15TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight members present.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander presented his report, as Curator of Botany, for the year\r\n1865, as follows.\r\n\r\n    During the past year the Herbarium of the Academy has been\r\n    increased—\r\n\r\n    1st.

C. A. CANFIELD, OF MONTEREY.\r\n\r\n    The following notes were taken from 1855 to 1858, in Monterey\r\n    County, California, and were communicated to Prof. Baird in\r\n    1859.\r\n\r\n    About the first of January the old bucks all shed their\r\n    horns. A few days after, one was shot, with two hairy stumps\r\n    or horn-cores, several inches long, just tipped with growing\r\n    horn. This was observed to spread upward and downward till\r\n    the whole of the process of the frontal bone was covered with\r\n    horn. The “prong” commenced the same process at its tip, and\r\n    gradually coalesced with the main horn, leaving no suture. As\r\n    the horn increases in length it curves forward and inward.\r\n    It takes several months to perfect the new horn. The females\r\n    possess small curved horns, one to three inches long, sometimes\r\n    recurving to the skull, which were not _proved_ to be deciduous.\r\n\r\n    The horn, when shed, leaves a process of the frontal bone,\r\n    covered with hair, soon replaced as above by horn at the tip.\r\n    These facts were more minutely observed in two young bucks,\r\n    reared by hand to the age respectively of one and two years.\r\n\r\n    These facts would tend to separate the genus _Antilocapra_ from\r\n    the family _Cavicornia_, and it may possibly form a family by\r\n    itself.\r\n\r\nProf. W. P. Blake read a portion of a letter from Dr. C. T. Jackson of\r\nBoston, containing a notice of a remarkable spider brought from Georgia\r\nby Dr. Wilder, an account of which has been published in the Proceedings\r\nof the American Academy and of the Boston Natural History Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, FEBRUARY 19TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNine members present.\r\n\r\nDr. Colbert A.

TRASK.\r\n\r\n    As in the preceding year we have had much frequency in shocks\r\n    of earthquake, with but trifling damage.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY 9th, 7 h.—A smart shock at Santa Rosa, Sonoma County.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY 19th, 8 h. 8 m.—A light shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 5th, 8 h. 45 m.—A light shock at Visalia, consisting of a\r\n    tremulous motion, succeeded by a roll or wave after an interval\r\n    of about four seconds.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 7th, 23 h.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 8th, 6 h. 22 m.—A smart shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    MARCH 30th, 7 h. 28 m.—A very smart shock at San Francisco;\r\n    this was felt at Oakland.\r\n\r\n    APRIL 15th, 0 h. 40 m.—A severe shock occurred at San Diego,\r\n    consisting of three waves, following each other in quick\r\n    succession; the shock was preceded with a loud rushing sound.\r\n\r\n    APRIL 18th, 13 h. 31 m.—A light shock at San Francisco, and\r\n    noticed at Angel Island and Oakland. This shock was severe at\r\n    San Juan (south), and felt at precisely the same hour.\r\n\r\n    APRIL 27th, 15 h. 56 m.—A shock at San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    MAY 24th, 3 h. 21 m.—A smart shock at San Francisco, consisting\r\n    of a single wave. At San Juan (south) the earthquake consisted\r\n    of two sharp shocks, and at Santa Cruz of one only. At the\r\n    latter localities it was three and four minutes later than at\r\n    this city.\r\n\r\n    SEPTEMBER 22d (no hour).—A smart shock occurred at Yreka.\r\n\r\n    OCTOBER 1st, 9 h. 15 m.—A very smart shock was felt at Fort\r\n    Humboldt, and throughout the district of Humboldt Bay.\r\n\r\n    OCTOBER 8th, 12 h. 46 m.—A severe shock at San Francisco.\r\n    This earthquake was the most violent of any occurring on\r\n    this peninsula since the American occupancy, but was not\r\n    sufficiently heavy to do serious damage; all the injuries\r\n    sustained to property were of a trivial nature, the principal\r\n    being the demolition of parts of the parapet walls erected\r\n    above the roofs, to shield the latter in cases of fire in\r\n    adjoining buildings; the fracture of walls in every instance\r\n    occurred in insecure buildings, and heavy buildings erected on\r\n    the made lands of the city front.\r\n\r\n    At San José, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz, the earthquake\r\n    appears to have been equally severe as in this city. At\r\n    Petaluma, on the north, it was also quite severe. At Sacramento\r\n    the shock was not marked by the same severity as at the other\r\n    localities mentioned. At Stockton the shock was heavy, but no\r\n    damage done, nor was there any damage at Sacramento. The shock\r\n    was severe at Grass Valley.\r\n\r\n    The direction of the wave in this earthquake was north fifty\r\n    degrees west; the limited area over which it extended has not\r\n    furnished sufficient data to calculate its velocity.\r\n\r\n    This earthquake differs from all others that have occurred\r\n    in this locality in this particular: the earth continued to\r\n    vibrate with increasing and again decreasing degrees of force\r\n    for ten hours, at no time entirely ceasing during this period.\r\n\r\n    22 h. 1 m., another light shock, consisting of a single\r\n    vibration.\r\n\r\n    23 h. 50 m., another shock.

This plate, together with\r\nan elaborate article describing the appearance and structure of this\r\nmeteorite, is published in the proceedings of the Vienna Academy of\r\nScience, Vol. XLVIII, page 301.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney also made some remarks on the nature and distribution\r\nof the meteorites which have, up to the present time, been discovered on\r\nthe Pacific Coast and in Mexico; of these remarks the following is an\r\nabstract.\r\n\r\n    It is remarkable that no meteoric stones have ever been\r\n    discovered, either near the Pacific coast or, indeed, so far as\r\n    we know, anywhere on this side of the Rocky Mountains. Masses\r\n    of meteoric iron, on the other hand, are known to exist in\r\n    quite a number of localities, and many of these masses are of\r\n    very large size.\r\n\r\n    On page eleven, of the third volume of the Academy’s\r\n    Proceedings, I have given a list of the localities of meteoric\r\n    iron known in Arizona and Northern Mexico. This was done in\r\n    order to attract the attention of explorers and prospectors\r\n    to these remarkable masses, and in the hope of getting more\r\n    definite information in regard to some of them. Indeed, some\r\n    additional items have already been obtained in reference to the\r\n    masses there noticed.\r\n\r\n    It is stated by several persons who have visited Southern\r\n    Arizona, among whom Dr. Horn may especially be mentioned, that\r\n    it is universally believed, and vouched for by apparently\r\n    trustworthy explorers, that there are many large masses of\r\n    iron near the summit of the range next east of Tucson. This is\r\n    called on the latest map of Arizona, (that published by Mr.\r\n    Gird) the “Sierra de la Santa Caterina.” Whether this is the\r\n    same as the “Sierra de la Madera,” mentioned by Velasco, as the\r\n    locality of “enormous masses of pure iron, between Tucson and\r\n    Tubac,” I have been unable to ascertain.\r\n\r\n    Dr. J. B. Trask saw, in August, 1849, a large mass of meteoric\r\n    iron, at the village of Rio Florida, partly buried in the\r\n    ground at the corner of the plaza. This may, perhaps, be the\r\n    same mass mentioned by Mr. Bartlett, as existing “at the\r\n    Hacienda de Concepcion, on the road from Chihuahua to Rio\r\n    Florida.” Dr. Trask, however, has a distinct recollection that\r\n    the mass he saw was at the village of Rio Florida, and not at\r\n    the Hacienda.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Veatch saw, in 1849, a large mass of iron at Santa Rosa,\r\n    Coahuila, which was then in use as an anvil, at a blacksmith’s\r\n    shop, and was informed that many pieces of native iron had been\r\n    used there for various purposes. The mass which Dr. Veatch saw,\r\n    was of about the size of an ordinary anvil. It was said to have\r\n    been brought from the mountains northwest of the town. This\r\n    statement corroborates that of Schott, in the Mexican Boundary\r\n    Report. (Vol. I, Part 2, page 34.)\r\n\r\n    It is a remarkable fact, considering the abundance of meteoric\r\n    iron near our borders, that no meteorite, either stony or\r\n    metallic, has yet been found within the limits of California.\r\n    The piece of iron from Honcut Creek, found by Dr. Trask,\r\n    and supposed to be of celestial origin, proved, on careful\r\n    examination, to be ordinary cast iron. A fragment of the mass\r\n    was referred to Professor Brush, and pronounced by him not to\r\n    be meteoric. The existence of a piece of cast iron, in the\r\n    locality where this was discovered, is not easily explained.\r\n    In connection with what has just been said of the existence of\r\n    meteoric iron in California, it should be added, that Dr. J. G.\r\n    Cooper thinks that he observed some small pieces of native iron\r\n    on the Mohave River, a little above its sink. By accident no\r\n    specimen of this supposed meteorite were saved, so that it is\r\n    not possible to say that Dr. Cooper may not have been mistaken.\r\n    The attention of explorers in that region is invited to this\r\n    supposed locality.\r\n\r\n    An additional reason for believing Dr. Cooper’s observations to\r\n    be correct is, that the locality lies in the prolongation of\r\n    the path or belt in which a considerable number of masses of\r\n    meteoric iron have already been found. It is certainly either a\r\n    very interesting fact, or else a remarkable coincidence, that\r\n    the localities of meteoric iron in Arizona and northern Mexico,\r\n    lie nearly in a straight line with each other, which line\r\n    extends from northwest to southeast, for a distance of twelve\r\n    hundred and fifty miles, or from the Colorado River, at La\r\n    Paz, to the province of San Luis Potosi, in Mexico. Along this\r\n    line, at points from two hundred to two hundred and fifty miles\r\n    apart, in some places one mass of iron, and in others quite a\r\n    number of them, have fallen, indicating very strongly a common\r\n    origin for the whole, or that they may all be fragments of one\r\n    immense meteor which passed diagonally across the continent,\r\n    throwing off masses in its progress. The large mass of iron\r\n    discovered by Dr. Evans, on Bald Mountain, near Port Orford, in\r\n    Oregon, is in a locality not far distant from the path of the\r\n    supposed meteor.\r\n\r\n    The belt of meteoric iron masses may also be prolonged much\r\n    farther to the south, through Mexico, and in the same general\r\n    southeasterly direction, as far as the province of Oaxaca. The\r\n    localities in the provinces of Durango, Zacatecas, Mexico,\r\n    and Oaxaca lie very nearly in the same northwest-southeast\r\n    direction from each other; but are in a line a little to\r\n    the west of the main belt which has been traced down from\r\n    the Colorado River. It is certain that the central part of\r\n    Mexico has been highly favored in respect to the distribution\r\n    of meteoric iron masses, which are not only of frequent\r\n    occurrence, but often of large size. Perhaps it may be not too\r\n    wild a speculation to suggest, that the grand disruption of\r\n    the meteor may have taken place in this part of its course,\r\n    and that the fragments were scattered far and wide in all\r\n    directions. It certainly seems difficult to account for the\r\n    peculiar position of the masses of iron found on the Pacific\r\n    side of the continent, and their great abundance in central\r\n    Mexico, on any other theory than the one which has here been\r\n    suggested.\r\n\r\n    Authorities are not at hand for comparing the chemical\r\n    composition of all the masses belonging to this series, or\r\n    belt, which have been analyzed; but it is my impression that\r\n    those meteoric irons which have been examined do resemble\r\n    each other sufficiently, in the nature and proportion of the\r\n    ingredients they contain, to add to the probability of their\r\n    having had a common origin. The specimens thus far analyzed do\r\n    not represent more than half the localities known to exist.\r\n    A farther and more complete investigation of the physical\r\n    and chemical character of all the meteoric masses of Arizona\r\n    and Mexico, with reference to the possibility of their being\r\n    originally parts of one body, is suggested as an interesting\r\n    subject for those specially devoted to this class of researches.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution, introduced by Professor Whitney, at a previous\r\nmeeting, in accordance with the Constitution, was adopted.\r\n\r\n    _Resolved_, That any Corresponding Member who may take up\r\n    his residence in this city, may become a Resident Member, on\r\n    notifying the Recording Secretary that such is his wish.\r\n\r\nMr. W.

RÉMOND.\r\n\r\n    [Compiled from his notes, and prepared for publication, by J.\r\n    D. Whitney.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. PRELIMINARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n    The mountainous region comprising the central and western\r\n    portion of Northern Mexico, belongs to the four States of\r\n    Durango, Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and Sonora. Considering how\r\n    celebrated this portion of Mexico has become for its mines and\r\n    metalliferous veins, and how much has been written about it,\r\n    it is surprising how little exact information has hitherto\r\n    been obtained with regard to either its geography or geology.\r\n    On comparing the principal published maps[21] of the region in\r\n    question, it will be seen at once how much they differ from\r\n    each other in their delineations of even its main topographical\r\n    features, while the details are entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n    The name of the “Sierra Madre” is usually applied to the main\r\n    range of mountains of this country, or the western border of\r\n    the plateau which stretches north through the territories\r\n    of the United States, forming what may be called the great\r\n    orographical feature of the continent. In Northwestern\r\n    Mexico this crumpled border of the great plateau comprises\r\n    an extensive mountainous region, by no means forming a\r\n    continuous single chain, but rather several central ranges,\r\n    with associated groups of parallel ridges, all having the\r\n    same general course, which is approximately north-northwest,\r\n    and south-southeast. As the breadth of the chain widens as we\r\n    go towards the north, so, too, that of the valleys increases\r\n    in that direction, the whole system of mountains and valleys\r\n    spreading out in something like a fan shape.\r\n\r\n    Going north, the chain appears to sink gradually, although\r\n    determinations of altitude in Northern Mexico are extremely\r\n    few in number. It is certain that there is, in about latitude\r\n    32°, a depression of the mountain ranges which extends entirely\r\n    across the continent, and which would enable the traveler to\r\n    cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific, without necessarily\r\n    surmounting any elevation greater than four thousand feet.[22]\r\n    The southeastern range is the highest, and the culminating\r\n    point is said to be the Cerro de Cuiteco, sixty leagues\r\n    northeast of Jesus Maria, on the western border of Chihuahua.\r\n    The approximate altitude of the Cumbre de Basascachic is\r\n    seven thousand four hundred and twenty-nine feet, and that of\r\n    Guadalupe y Calvo, seven thousand eight hundred and twenty-five\r\n    feet. To the north, the ranges east of Sahuaripa are also very\r\n    high; but they have never been measured. No peaks or ridges,\r\n    however, in this portion of Mexico attain anything like the\r\n    elevation of the higher portion of the Sierra Nevada, few if\r\n    any points exceeding ten thousand feet in altitude.\r\n\r\n    The direction of the sierra is nearly that of a line connecting\r\n    some of the best mining districts in Mexico, which are situated\r\n    on or very near the summit of the mountains. These districts\r\n    are the following, enumerating them in their geographical order\r\n    from the south towards the north: In Durango, San Antonio de\r\n    las Ventanas, Guarisamey, and San Dimas, remarkable for their\r\n    auriferous silver ores, and sixty-two Mexican leagues northeast\r\n    of Mazatlan; in Chihuahua, Guadalupe y Calvo, and San Pedro\r\n    de Batopilas, yielding fine specimens of native silver; also,\r\n    Jesus Maria, in the same State, and the Real del la Cieneguita,\r\n    Sonora, with silver and gold mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. GENERAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The geological structure of the occidental slope of the Sierra\r\n    Madre, as well as that of the other parts of this great chain,\r\n    is exceedingly interesting, and, as yet but very little known,\r\n    notwithstanding the valuable investigations of Humboldt and\r\n    other eminent men; for, up to the present time, the age\r\n    of the different formations has never been fixed with any\r\n    degree of accuracy, from want of materials and of sufficient\r\n    observations. In 1863, 1864, and 1865, however, I explored\r\n    quite a number of localities in northwestern Mexico, and was\r\n    thus enabled to obtain a pretty good general idea of the\r\n    geology of that region; and, in Sonora, to which my attention\r\n    was especially devoted, I succeeded in finding fossils in\r\n    sufficient quantity to allow of the determination of the age\r\n    of the principal formations of the northern Sierra Madre. By\r\n    tracing the connection of these rocks with those of Central\r\n    Mexico, additional light will be thrown on those districts of\r\n    which, at present, but little is definitely known.\r\n\r\n    The igneous rocks, which occur more abundantly on the Pacific\r\n    slope, are granites, either fine or very coarse-grained;\r\n    porphyries, more or less feldspathic; and greenstones, all of\r\n    which are cut by numerous dykes of extremely varied character.\r\n    The granites, however, are very poor in veins of the precious\r\n    metals, while the porphyries are highly metalliferous. In\r\n    Sinaloa (Candelero) and Durango (San Dimas) we see that the\r\n    granites underlie the metalliferous porphyries, and that the\r\n    greenstones, in Sonora, (near Hermosillo and in the vicinity of\r\n    La Haciendita) penetrate through them.\r\n\r\n    The oldest sedimentary rocks, which I have observed, belong to\r\n    the Carboniferous series; this is represented in the eastern\r\n    part of Sonora, by heavy masses of limestone, forming very\r\n    high and rugged ridges, running a little west of north. The\r\n    upturned strata are seen, in many places, to rest on granite.\r\n    Argentiferous veins occur throughout this formation.\r\n\r\n    The next group of sedimentary rocks, in order, is the Triassic;\r\n    this forms isolated mountain groups in Sonora, and offers an\r\n    interesting field for investigation. Instead of limestones,\r\n    it is made up of heavy beds of quartzites and conglomerates,\r\n    with coal-bearing clay shales; all of these are disturbed and\r\n    elevated, and rest on greenstones, feldspathic porphyries,\r\n    or granite. Wherever metamorphosed, the Triassic rocks are\r\n    auriferous and contain veins of silver ores. The metamorphic\r\n    slates and limestones of the Altar and Magdalena districts,\r\n    which include the richest gold placers of Sonora, may possibly\r\n    be of Triassic age; but the fossils collected are too imperfect\r\n    to admit of this being determined. There are some reasons for\r\n    believing those rocks to be rather of Jurassic than of Triassic\r\n    age, as they differ in lithological characters from both the\r\n    Triassic and Carboniferous of Northern Mexico, resembling,\r\n    rather, the Jurassic gold-bearing slates of the Sierra Nevada,\r\n    in California; besides, they lie outside and to the west of\r\n    the Sierra Madre. It may also be noticed that the gold which\r\n    they furnish does not resemble that obtained from the Triassic\r\n    strata.\r\n\r\n    The Cretaceous period is also represented at the foot of the\r\n    Sierra Madre, at Arivechi, in Sonora. The strata belonging to\r\n    this series are chiefly argillaceous shales, and they rest\r\n    upon porphyries and Carboniferous limestone. They have been\r\n    disturbed and elevated since their deposition. The fossils,\r\n    which they contain in great number and in a fine state of\r\n    preservation, will be noticed farther on.\r\n\r\n    All the above mentioned formations were already in existence\r\n    before the first eruption of the volcanic rocks took place.\r\n    These latter are found scattered along the whole Pacific coast,\r\n    and extend from the Gulf of California up to the very summit\r\n    of the sierra. It is very interesting to see the volcanic\r\n    formations spread over so extensive a region, especially as\r\n    there are no active volcanoes known in Northern Mexico, and not\r\n    even any indications of ancient craters or vents.\r\n\r\n    The lithological character of the eruptive materials is\r\n    extremely varied, and there seem to have been several periods\r\n    of igneous action preceded by as many disturbances of the\r\n    strata, all of which took place after the close of the\r\n    Cretaceous epoch. Three different series of volcanic rocks may\r\n    be observed in Sinaloa and Sonora, unconformable with each\r\n    other; and these may again be subdivided into groups, after\r\n    a thorough examination has been made of the extensive suite\r\n    of specimens which has been collected. The lower, or oldest\r\n    series, affords several hundred varieties of porphyries,\r\n    characterized by crystals of feldspar or augite. There are\r\n    also very peculiar trachytic rocks, resembling granite in\r\n    appearance. These volcanic materials occur in beds or in\r\n    masses, and are frequently cut by dykes; but they are quite\r\n    destitute of veins containing gold or silver, the only\r\n    metalliferous ores they contain being those of copper (?) and\r\n    iron, and these in small quantity. Various volcanic ridges in\r\n    Sonora belong to this class. The second series consists of\r\n    extensive beds of micaceous, trachytic tufas, and breccias,\r\n    all more or less uplifted since their deposition, and covering\r\n    the different igneous and sedimentary formations as well as\r\n    the older volcanic porphyries. These attain a great thickness,\r\n    between San Dimas and San Ignacio, in Durango and Sinaloa.\r\n\r\n    Above these formations occur ancient alluvial deposits, with\r\n    bones of extinct animals (elephants) at two localities; near La\r\n    Noria, northeast of Mazatlan, and in the Arroya de la Palma,\r\n    two leagues east of La Casita, in Sonora.\r\n\r\n    Sheets of basaltic lavas, somewhat similar to those of\r\n    California, and probably of the same age, forming with tufas\r\n    the upper volcanic series, overlie the other formations,\r\n    occupying a nearly horizontal position.\r\n\r\n    The most recent formation is that of the terrace deposits of\r\n    sand and gravel, which occur in Sonora.\r\n\r\n    Having thus given a general sketch of the principal groups of\r\n    rocks developed in the region in question, I pass to a more\r\n    detailed description of the different formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GRANITES.\r\n\r\n    Underlying all the rocks in Durango and Sinaloa, and probably\r\n    posterior to the Carboniferous limestones, which they have\r\n    in places extensively metamorphosed, are masses of granite.\r\n    These may be seen in many places between the coast and San\r\n    Dimas, either occupying the bottoms of the valleys, or forming\r\n    independent hills. There are two well-marked varieties: Of\r\n    these the first are syenites, more or less fine-grained,\r\n    and consisting of a mixture of feldspar, variously colored,\r\n    quartz, black or green hornblende, and black or brown mica,\r\n    the latter usually in hexagonal plates. Localities of this\r\n    variety are: Haval, Las Higueras, San Ignacio, Santa Apolonia,\r\n    Candelero, La Noria, Zaragoza, etc., in Sinaloa; San Marcial\r\n    and Tecoripa valleys, Hermosillo, in Sonora. The other variety\r\n    is either very coarse-grained, consisting of white feldspar,\r\n    gray quartz, and plates of silvery mica, or else finer\r\n    grained, and chiefly made up of feldspar; these occur, forming\r\n    mountains and ridges in Sonora, in the Sierra del Amolé, near\r\n    La Magdalena, Sierra del Espinaso Prieto, near Hermosillo,\r\n    and the Sierra de Mazatan, south of Ures. The fine-grained\r\n    granites contain argentiferous veins at Zaragoza, in Sinaloa,\r\n    and east of Topisco, in Sonora. These are traversed by numerous\r\n    intersecting dykes of diorite, feldspar, and quartziferous and\r\n    feldspathic porphyries, especially well seen near Hermosillo,\r\n    and the Cajon de los Carrisos, east of San Antonio de la\r\n    Huerta. There are no metalliferous veins where the granite is\r\n    thus intersected by dykes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    METALLIFEROUS PORPHYRIES.\r\n\r\n    These may be divided into two groups. The first consists of a\r\n    rock occurring in large irregular masses or beds, and having a\r\n    dark colored argillaceous base, through which are disseminated\r\n    small crystals of whitish feldspar. This variety, which is\r\n    probably older than the granites, includes some of the richest\r\n    mines of the Sierra Madre; as those of Candelaria, Bolaños,\r\n    Cinco Señores, etc., near San Dimas, in Durango; and which\r\n    have yielded over $20,000,000. There are also rich veins in\r\n    this kind of rock at Candelero, fifty-two leagues northeast\r\n    of Mazatlan, in Sinaloa. All these veins run northeast and\r\n    southwest, and are cut at right angles by dykes. The second\r\n    variety of porphyry is a gray feldspathic rock, apparently made\r\n    up of labradorite and magnetic iron ore; this overlies the\r\n    greenstones, and is covered by the Triassic beds at Los Bronces\r\n    and San Javier, where there are three systems of argentiferous\r\n    veins. The Nahuila mine, one of the best in Sonora, is in this\r\n    rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n    METAMORPHIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    Heavy masses of metamorphic rocks may be seen at various\r\n    localities in Sinaloa and Durango (Tecomate, Tenchoquelite,\r\n    Arroyo del Ciruelo, Arroyo de San Vincente) resting either\r\n    on the granites or the metalliferous porphyries. These rocks\r\n    occur in masses or beds, sometimes distinctly stratified, and\r\n    sometimes without any traces of the original bedding. They\r\n    are always much altered and broken up. Their lithological\r\n    characters are not well marked, although the series is easily\r\n    recognized. The rocks referred to in this division, are usually\r\n    fine-grained, of a greenish or bluish color, when not too much\r\n    decomposed, and somewhat argillaceous in composition. At the\r\n    base they pass into porphyries. The argentiferous veins cut\r\n    both the metamorphic and the porphyritic rocks at Tecomate,\r\n    on the Rio de San Ignacio, where the dip of the formation is\r\n    to the northeast, at an angle of 70°. Between La Puerta and\r\n    El Pilar, Arroyo de San Dimas, they occur in jaspery layers,\r\n    ribboned with green and brown hues, and resemble some of the\r\n    metamorphic Triassic rocks of Sonora. Near Candelero, the\r\n    metamorphic rocks are associated with whitish, semi-crystalline\r\n    limestone. The formation in question may be observed in many\r\n    other localities in Sinaloa, always resting on granite and\r\n    passing into porphyry; it is also sometimes associated with\r\n    metamorphic slates.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GREENSTONES.\r\n\r\n    These rocks occur in heavy masses or in beds, and are made\r\n    up of a fine-grained, compact mixture of hornblende and\r\n    feldspar, often containing mica, and having a greenish color.\r\n    The greenstone underlies the Triassic rocks, and in many\r\n    places it protrudes through the granite. This rock is highly\r\n    metalliferous at Copála, Sinaloa, and also at Los Bronces and\r\n    San Javier, in Sonora. The greenstones or diorites which occur\r\n    in the granite, appear to be anterior to the metalliferous\r\n    greenstones, and the latter are posterior to the Triassic.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CARBONIFEROUS LIMESTONES.\r\n\r\n    The Carboniferous limestones form high ridges parallel with the\r\n    general course of the Sierra Madre, from Hermosillo, north of\r\n    Guaymas, east of Sahuaripa. These ridges become more elevated\r\n    as we approach the crest of the Sierra. The rocks of this\r\n    formation are fine-grained and bluish in color, and form heavy\r\n    beds with intercalated schistose layers; they contain nodules\r\n    and beds of flint. There are some clay slates at the base of\r\n    the formation. The thickness of the whole series is probably\r\n    over five thousand feet. The principal localities where these\r\n    Carboniferous rocks may be observed are as follows, naming them\r\n    in order from west to east:\r\n\r\n    1st. Hermosillo, where they rest on syenitic granite and are\r\n    highly metamorphosed, the limestones being converted into\r\n    white saccharoidal marble, and the slates into garnet and\r\n    epidote rock. Dykes of green porphyry cut through the beds of\r\n    sedimentary rock, which beds have a strike of about N. 65° W.,\r\n    and stand nearly vertical.\r\n\r\n    2d. Five leagues from Hermosillo, at La Cruz; in the Cerro de\r\n    Santa Teresa on the south, and the Sierra de Las Animas on the\r\n    north. Here the limestones contain crinoids.\r\n\r\n    3d. Four leagues farther on, between La Noria and El Aguajito;\r\n    here are high granite ridges with a granite axis.\r\n\r\n    4th. Twenty leagues from Hermosillo, south of Ures;\r\n    Carboniferous rocks upheaved on the southwest side of the\r\n    granitic Sierra de Mazatan. The direction of this range is from\r\n    northwest to southeast, and its height sixteen hundred varas,\r\n    according to M. De Fleury; here are a few silver mines.\r\n\r\n    5th. Haciendita, nine leagues farther northeast. The beds here\r\n    are metamorphosed and much disturbed, dipping northeast; these\r\n    outcrops form low hills.\r\n\r\n    6th. Between Mátape and Batuco; a very high ridge of granite,\r\n    running in a northerly direction, with limestone resting upon\r\n    it. To the north and east of Topisco the limestones attain a\r\n    great thickness and afford fine fossils. At the Cerro de la\r\n    Bonacina, one of the highest points of the range, a variety of\r\n    corals, crinoids, and brachiopods may be seen weathered out\r\n    from the surface of several beds of hard, compact limestone,\r\n    of various colors; these beds are near the summit of the\r\n    mountain. This locality was first discovered by Don Antonio\r\n    Moreno, Engineer of the Bronces mine. The strata here are much\r\n    disturbed, and appear to have been folded into a mass with a\r\n    synclinal structure.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n    TRIASSIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    This formation is usually highly metamorphosed, and passes\r\n    into porphyries at its base. The strata are more or less\r\n    inclined, and the lower beds are very much contorted and\r\n    disturbed. The rocks referred to the Trias extend from Soyopa\r\n    to San Javier; but they are developed on a more extensive scale\r\n    between San Antonio de la Huerta and Los Bronces, forty-two\r\n    leagues northeast of Guaymas. The Triassic rocks form a chain\r\n    of high and rugged mountains extending from south-southeast to\r\n    north-northwest. The isolated mining districts of Tecoripa and\r\n    San Marcial (between Los Bronces and Guaymas) are in the same\r\n    formation; it also crops out from under the stratified volcanic\r\n    rocks at the Punta de Agua, between San Marcial and Guaymas.\r\n    The metalliferous greenstones and porphyries, previously\r\n    noticed, form the nucleus around which the Triassic beds have\r\n    been upheaved. These beds are seen near San Javier and Los\r\n    Bronces, two mining towns which are situated on greenstone, but\r\n    which skirt the foot of a small ridge of feldspathic porphyry,\r\n    much less elevated than the metamorphic rocks themselves. They\r\n    are also seen overlying granite, near the Cerro Colorado,\r\n    between Soyopa and Los Bronces, and south of Tecoripa.\r\n    The Cerro de la Nahuila, the highest point but one in the\r\n    district, lies southeast of the Sierra de Mazatan. There are\r\n    three principal divisions of the Triassic, which occur in the\r\n    following order, the first mentioned being the lowest:\r\n\r\n      { { Quartzites and clay slates;\r\n      { { Black, jaspery schistose layers;\r\n      {\r\n    1.{    or, where the rocks are less altered:\r\n      {\r\n      { { Black clay shales with beds of coal;\r\n      { { Argillaceous sandstones.\r\n\r\n    2. Quartzites, in great thickness.\r\n\r\n    3. Heavy beds of conglomerate.\r\n\r\n    The interstratified clay shales and grits of the lower member,\r\n    crop out in several places along the Cañada de Santa Maria, at\r\n    the bottom of the ravines below Los Bronces. Here, there are\r\n    three or four beds of good anthracite coal, with a considerable\r\n    number of well-preserved plants occurring in the associated\r\n    clay shales, both above and below the coal.\r\n\r\n    [A portion of these plants were referred by me to Dr. Newberry\r\n    for examination, and he has given the following list of them.\r\n    1. _Strangerites magnifolia_, Rogers; Trans. Assoc. Am.\r\n    Geologists, p. 306, Pl. xiv. A species occurring in the Trias\r\n    (?) of Virginia and North Carolina. 2. _Pecopteris falcatus_,\r\n    Emmons; Geol. of N. Car., Pl. iv, fig. 9. The specimens are\r\n    too imperfect to decide on the identity of this plant with\r\n    _Saccopteris germinans_. ?3. _Pecopteris bullatus_, Bunbury;\r\n    only in fruit; nervation obscure; identity not certain, but\r\n    very probable. 4. _Otozamites Macombii_, Newb. At top of “red\r\n    beds” or “gypsum formation,” at the base of the Cretaceous\r\n    rocks, copper mines near Abiquiu, New Mexico. There is no\r\n    doubt about this species, and it forms an important connecting\r\n    link. ?5. _Pterozamites decussatus_, Emmons; specimens very\r\n    imperfect. 6. _Pecopteris_, n. sp.; a very neat and peculiar\r\n    species as yet undescribed. It may be the same as one badly\r\n    figured by Emmons (Pl. II, fig. 1.) 7. _Alethopteris_, n.\r\n    sp.; small fragments of the frond of a splendid new species.\r\n    From this enumeration it will be seen that there can be but\r\n    little doubt of the Triassic age of the formation in which\r\n    these plants occur. A large lot of these plants, collected\r\n    by M. Rémond, has been recently received, and among them are\r\n    much better specimens of some of the species noticed by Dr.\r\n    Newberry, and several quite new ones. These will also be\r\n    examined, described, and figured within a short time. J. D. W.]\r\n\r\n    The strike and dip of the clay shales in the different ravines\r\n    vary considerably, but the dip is usually to the southeast.\r\n    The superincumbent quartzites are more regular in their\r\n    inclination. There are dykes of feldspathic rock cutting\r\n    through both the coal and the shales.\r\n\r\n    The following section represents, in an ascending order, the\r\n    position of the coal-bearing strata in the Cañon del Retiro,\r\n    near Los Bronces.\r\n\r\n     1. Coarse quartzites with conglomerates.\r\n     2. Conglomerate, 8 feet.\r\n     3. Argillaceous and schistose grits, 3 feet.\r\n     4. Clay shales, with impressions of plants, 8 feet.\r\n     5. Gray grits, 4 feet.\r\n     6. Bluish clay shales with ferns, 12 feet.\r\n     7. Coal, 2 feet.\r\n     8. Compact black clay shales, 5 inches.\r\n     9. Coal, 2 feet 6 inches.\r\n    10. Clay shales with leaves, several feet.\r\n    11. Coarse grits.\r\n\r\n    Another section, measured at the foot of the Cerro de la Aguja,\r\n    was as follows.\r\n\r\n     1. Compact gray grits.\r\n     2. Gray clay shales with seams of coal and plants, 4 feet 6\r\n          inches.\r\n     3. Bluish argillaceous grits, 2 feet 6 inches.\r\n     4. Contorted black clay shales, with seams of coal, 5 feet\r\n          6 inches.\r\n     5. Coal, 2 feet 6 inches.\r\n     6. Black, compact clay shales, 3 feet.\r\n     7. Coal, 7 inches.\r\n     8. Carbonaceous clay shales, 8 inches.\r\n     9. Coal, 3 inches.\r\n    10. Clay shales and argillaceous grits.\r\n\r\n    [Specimens of the coal brought to San Francisco by M. Rémond,\r\n    are anthracite, evidently of superior quality. J. D. W.]\r\n\r\n    The middle member of the Triassic series consists of\r\n    quartzites, or metamorphic sandstones; these are both coarse\r\n    and fine grained, and sometimes brecciated. They vary in color,\r\n    from white to red, and are often much altered in the vicinity\r\n    of the metalliferous veins. The upper member of the series,\r\n    as seen in the Cañada de la Tinta, is made up of rounded\r\n    pebbles of black jasper and gray quartzite; in the Cañada\r\n    de los Mimbres, below Los Bronces pebbles of specular iron\r\n    are included in the mass. The dip of the formation is very\r\n    irregular, both in direction and amount.\r\n\r\n    At San Antonio de la Huerta, Tecoripa, and San Marcial,\r\n    argentiferous veins of various ages occur in the lower and\r\n    middle members of the Trias. At San Marcial, marine (?)\r\n    shells are found in the clay slates, near the silver mines;\r\n    [but those which have been obtained, are too imperfect for\r\n    recognition; they were referred to Mr. Meek for examination. J.\r\n    D. W.]\r\n\r\n    At San Marcos, between San Antonio de la Huerta and the Real\r\n    Viejo, metamorphic jaspery slates occur in connection with the\r\n    carboniferous limestones; they are probably of Triassic age.\r\n    Gold is found in the gulches between the quartzite ridges, as\r\n    in the Cañada de la Higuera, near Los Bronces in the Cañada\r\n    de la Iglesia, between the latter place and San Antonio de la\r\n    Huerta, and generally where the quartzites occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n    JURASSIC (?) ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    In the eastern part of the Magdalena and Altar districts, are\r\n    valleys with low hills and ridges of auriferous clay slates,\r\n    with interstratified beds of porphyry and diorite. Localities\r\n    of these rocks are Cerros de la Barajita, between Querobabi and\r\n    Santa Ana; Cerritos de la Tierra Colorada, where the formation\r\n    contains beds of variously colored limestones, entirely made\r\n    up of fossils, South of La Magdalena this formation rests on\r\n    metamorphic sandstones and shales. [The reasons for referring\r\n    these rocks, with doubt, to the Jurassic formation, have been\r\n    already given; see page 246.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    CRETACEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    In the Sahuaripa Valley, four miles east of Arivechi, and\r\n    seventy-two leagues northeast of Guaymas, is a locality of\r\n    Cretaceous Fossils of great interest. The hill in which they\r\n    occur is called “Cerro de las Conchas,” or “Shell Mountain.”\r\n    The rocks exposed are unfossiliferous strata of coarse-grained\r\n    sandstone at the base, overlain by clay shales and argillaceous\r\n    limestone filled with fossils. The exposure is very limited in\r\n    extent: the shales are a few hundred feet thick, and they dip\r\n    to the east, as do also the beds of carboniferous limestone on\r\n    which the Cretaceous deposits rest. Masses of porphyry crop\r\n    out from under the shales, without there being any peculiar\r\n    indication of metamorphism or disturbance in their vicinity.\r\n    Other patches of shelly rock are said to occur in the valley\r\n    on the eastern side, at the foot of the sierra. [A small\r\n    lot of fossils collected here by M. Rémond were referred to\r\n    Mr. Gabb for examination; and since that, a considerable\r\n    number of additional specimens have been received, but have\r\n    not yet been investigated. Several species were identified\r\n    as already described from Texas, and figured by Roemer in\r\n    “Die Kreidebildungen von Texas;” these are, _Ammonites\r\n    pedernalis_, von Buch; _Natica pedernalis_, Roem.; _Turritella\r\n    seriatim-granulata_, Roem.; _Gryphæa navis_, Hall; _Cyphosoma\r\n    Texanum_, Roem.; _Eulima Texana_, Roem. Besides these, two\r\n    other species are identified, namely; _Cardium multistriatum_,\r\n    Shum., and _Turbinolia Texana_, Con.\r\n\r\n    There is a considerable number of new species among the\r\n    specimens from this locality, among which the following genera\r\n    are represented: _Turritella_, _Chemnitzia_, _Avellana_,\r\n    _Cardium_, _Trigonia_, _Panopæa_, _Pinna_, _Cucullæa_, etc.\r\n    These will be described and figured by Mr. Gabb, who also\r\n    remarks that the character of the fossils indicates a closer\r\n    relationship of the formation to the eastern Cretaceous than to\r\n    that of California.—J. D. W.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    VOLCANIC ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    Stratified volcanic deposits cover a broad area of the surface\r\n    between San Ignacio and San Dimas (Sinaloa and Durango); they\r\n    dip to the west. On the other side of Durango they dip in the\r\n    opposite direction. The serrated edges of the strata may be\r\n    seen from a great distance, and are extremely picturesque,\r\n    towering up like old ruins, their peculiar forms being due to\r\n    erosion. They are well seen in the Cerro de los Frayles, near\r\n    Guarisamey, in Durango; visible from Mazatlan. These belong to\r\n    the second series of volcanic rocks. In Sonora there are three\r\n    different series of volcanic deposits which form serrated,\r\n    picturesque, parallel ridges, running north from Guaymas as far\r\n    as La Magdalena, or over eighty leagues in a straight line.\r\n    The three main ridges, enumerated from west to east, are, 1,\r\n    Las Tetas de Cabra; 2, Guaymas de Zaragosa; 3, Range north of\r\n    the mouth of the Yaqui River. The description of the various\r\n    volcanic deposits of Northern Mexico may be reserved for a\r\n    separate memoir, as the number of them is very great.\r\n\r\n\r\n    MINES.\r\n\r\n    The richest and widest veins are those northeast of Mazatlan,\r\n    near San Dimas, Guarisamey, etc., in Durango. These veins cut\r\n    all the rocks older than the Cretaceous, whether igneous or\r\n    sedimentary. The mines of Sinaloa are richer than those of\r\n    Sonora. In the former State the ore-bearing portion of the\r\n    veins is from a few feet to several yards in width: in the\r\n    latter, generally from one to two feet. In Durango and Sinaloa\r\n    gold, native silver, and sulphuret of silver occur associated\r\n    with galena, yellow blende, and iron pyrites. In Sonora the\r\n    principal ores are argentiferous gray copper, with galena,\r\n    black blende, copper pyrites, arsenical pyrites, carbonate of\r\n    lead, ruby silver, arsenical silver, and gold. Each mining\r\n    district is characterized by a peculiar system of veins; in\r\n    all as many as twenty different systems have been observed.\r\n    The most abundant vein stones are quartz, either chalcedonic,\r\n    crystalline, or massive; brown spar; heavy spar; oxide of\r\n    iron. The veins occurring in the metamorphic Triassic rocks,\r\n    are usually parallel with the stratification, so that they\r\n    lie nearly horizontal where the formation has been but little\r\n    disturbed. As to the yield of the silver ores, it varies\r\n    extremely, and it would be necessary to enter into a full\r\n    description of all the different districts to give an idea of\r\n    it. It may be noticed, however, that the arsenical pyrites,\r\n    which is auriferous in the Sierra Nevada, becomes argentiferous\r\n    in the Sierra Madre. The veins vary in their direction from\r\n    a little east to a little west of north; the richest ores\r\n    near San Dimas run northeast and southwest. There are but few\r\n    rich mines in Sonora, a state of which the mineral wealth has\r\n    been much exaggerated. There are, however, some deposits of\r\n    variegated copper, and veins of magnetic and specular iron.\r\n\r\n    The annexed tabular statement will give the principal facts\r\n    obtained with regard to the mines examined in Northern Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TABULAR STATEMENT, SHOWING THE POSITION AND CHARACTER OF THE\r\n    PRINCIPAL MINES OF NORTHERN MEXICO.\r\n\r\n    BY A.

================+======================================+===============\r\n\r\n    [21] The best map of Northern Mexico is that of M. de Fleury,\r\n    published in San Francisco, in 1864; but this makes little\r\n    pretense to a delineation of the topography; the courses of\r\n    the principal streams and the position of the larger mining\r\n    towns are often very far from being correct, as must be\r\n    expected on a map constructed without a basis of instrumental\r\n    surveys. J. D. W.\r\n\r\n    [22] See Emory, in Mexican Boundary Report, vol. 1, page 41.\r\n\r\n    [23] Only a few specimens of the Carboniferous fossils\r\n    collected by M. Rémond have ever been received, owing to\r\n    circumstances connected with the present political condition\r\n    of Mexico. It is hoped, however, that they are not lost, and\r\n    that they may yet be recovered. Among the few specimens\r\n    received is a coral, not to be distinguished from the\r\n    _Lithostrotion_ (_L. mamillare_) found near Bass’s Ranch,\r\n    in Shasta County, California. J. D. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 19TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: Sections of the _Sequoia gigantea_ and a roll\r\nshowing the annual growth of the “Old Maid,” one of the trees in the\r\nCalaveras grove of Big Trees; from Mr. Henry Hentsch.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall stated that Dr. Cooper had discovered, in the vicinity of\r\nSanta Cruz, _Helix redemita_, _H. Vancouverensis_, _H. Columbiana_, and\r\n_H. arrosa_; also, in the small rivulets near the town, _Margaritana\r\nfalcata_, besides several univalves, and also an undetermined _Helix_,\r\nwhich may prove to be new. Mr. Dall also remarked that Rev. J. Rowell had\r\nobtained at Hayward’s, Alameda County, a number of specimens of _Helix\r\nCronkhitei_, which is a new locality for that species.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall remarked that in dissecting a specimen of _Trochiscus\r\nNorrissii_, the position of which has for some time been doubtful,\r\nsufficient evidence was obtained to decide that it did not belong with\r\nthe Proboscidians, to which group it had been doubtfully referred by\r\nseveral naturalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 2D, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive members present.\r\n\r\nMr. Bloomer presented some Diatoms, from the coast of California,\r\nsupposed to belong to the genera _Melissa_ and _Meridion_; they were both\r\nfound growing upon calcareous sea weeds. The genus _Meridion_ has not\r\nheretofore been recorded as occurring in California.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall presented, in the name of Dr. Cooper, the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of a new California Helix, with notes on others already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nBY J. G. COOPER, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n    HELIX (Arianta) SEQUOICOLA, Cooper.\r\n\r\n    Sp. ch. _H. testa_ rotundata, umbilicata, spira depressa, anfr.\r\n    ult. nonnunquam subangulata; anfr. vi ad vii et dimidium,\r\n    perist. obliqua superne parum deflecta; labio tenui, reflexo,\r\n    infra crassiore, acuta. Colore atrobrunnea, vel olivacea, zona\r\n    nigra, lata, inter duabus ochraceis sita, in spira semicelata,\r\n    labio albo; intus læte purpureo, zonis duabus albis. Epidermide\r\n    nitente, infra polita, striis incrementis læve perspicuis,\r\n    interdum tenuissime malleata, rugis spiralibus; supra punctis\r\n    piliferis creberrime induta; pilis brevissimis junioris\r\n    deciduis.\r\n\r\n    _Animal_ schisto-colore; corpore cylindraceo rugosa, tentaculis\r\n    longis, pede postice elongata, cuneata.\r\n\r\n    _Testæ_ lat., major, 0.93 ad 1.20; minor 0.76 ad 0.96; alt.\r\n    0.42 ad 0.54 poll. Angl.\r\n\r\n    _Hab._ Santa Cruz, California, in ligno carioso, locis\r\n    humidissimis.\r\n\r\n    _Specific characters._ Shell rounded, umbilicate, spire\r\n    depressed, last whorl sometimes subangulate, whorls 6 to\r\n    6½, peristome oblique, little deflected above; labium\r\n    thin, reflexed, thickest below; acute. Color dark brown or\r\n    olivaceous, with a broad black band between two yellow ones,\r\n    half hidden on the spire, lips white; within a fine purple with\r\n    two white bands. Epidermis shining, polished below, the lines\r\n    of growth faintly visible, sometimes very lightly malleated,\r\n    and with spiral ridges; above with crowded scars bearing very\r\n    short bristles in the young shell which fall off in the adult.\r\n\r\n    _Animal_ slate colored, body cylindrical, rugose, tentacles\r\n    moderate; foot elongated, behind wedge-shaped.\r\n\r\n    _Shell_—large diameter 0.96 to 1.20; smaller diameter 0.76 to\r\n    0.96; height 0.42 to 0.54 hundredths of an inch.\r\n\r\n    _Hab._ Santa Cruz, Cal., among decayed trees in the dampest\r\n    places.\r\n\r\n    This beautiful species is quite rare, only three adult and\r\n    twelve young specimens having been found after long searching.\r\n    It will probably occur more commonly in some part of the\r\n    redwood forests which I have been unable to explore. It\r\n    approaches nearest to _H. Dupetithouarsi_ and _H. fidelis_,\r\n    being between them in form and size as well as colors, but\r\n    the pilosity at once distinguishes it. Its distinct bands\r\n    and rounded whorls separate it from _H. infumata_ and\r\n    _Hillebrandii_, the latter when perfect having also much\r\n    longer hairs. The animal is lighter colored than those of _H.\r\n    arrosa_, _Nickliniana_, _redimita_, _ramentosa_, _tudiculata_,\r\n    (which are all very similar) but much darker than that\r\n    of _Dupetithouarsi_, and I believe also of _fidelis_ and\r\n    _infumata_. The form of the shell is a link connecting these\r\n    with _Mormonum_.\r\n\r\n    In the tabular arrangement adopted in my State Survey Report,\r\n    it would come in as the pilose analogue of _H. Dupetithouarsi_,\r\n    and _H. exarata_, which are also its nearest geographical\r\n    neighbors, as follows:\r\n\r\n    =====================+====================+====================\r\n       § =A.= Shining;   |   § =B.= Dark;     | § =C.= Brown;\r\n         band triple,    |     hirsute in     |   band single,\r\n         not rugose,     |     the young,     | rugose, sculptured,\r\n      l. whorls 6 to 8.  | l. whorls 6 to 6½. | l. whorls 6 to 7.\r\n    ---------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n      H. fidelis.        | H. infumata.[24]   | H. arrosa.\r\n      H. Traskii.[25]    | H. sequoicola.     | H. exarata.\r\n      H. Dupetithouarsi. | H. Hillebrandii.   | H. Ayresiana.\r\n    ---------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\n    Judging from the form of _H. Mormonum_, it is possible that the\r\n    young will be found to be hirsute.\r\n\r\n    The table referred to includes twelve other banded species of\r\n    California, arranged under the same headings. It is interesting\r\n    to observe that the § A 1 and B 1 groups inhabit coniferous\r\n    forests, and probably feed chiefly on fungi found in decaying\r\n    wood while § C, including also H. _Nickliniana_, _Bridgesii_,\r\n    _redimita_, _ramentosa_, _tudiculata_, _Californiensis_ (and\r\n    _Carpenteri_?) are found in woods of oak, etc. Another group\r\n    which I place in § A (as not being rugose) are found in dry,\r\n    treeless localities where they seem to represent those last\r\n    mentioned, the size, form, and number of whorls furnishing\r\n    parallels, but being usually less in size, as might be expected\r\n    of species from arid regions, and often with the band single\r\n    or obscured; these are H. _Tryoni_[25], _rufocincta_,\r\n    _Kellettii_, _crebristriata_, _Gabbii_, _facta_.[25]\r\n\r\n    The bandless species, of which there are few on this coast,\r\n    present analogous sections as to surface characters, and\r\n    exhibit much greater varieties in the form of their apertures,\r\n    by which they can be arranged in groups, having a greater\r\n    development of species in the Atlantic States and more\r\n    distinguishable by form than by surface.\r\n\r\n    _H. Townsendiana_ alone approaches § C in its rugose sculpture,\r\n    but otherwise differs greatly from the usual types of\r\n    California.\r\n\r\n    From the shells alone, five subgenera may be established out of\r\n    the banded group, which I will describe in a future article.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.—There is a single specimen of Helix in the State\r\n    Collection, supposed to have been obtained in the Mount Diablo\r\n    range by Prof. Brewer, which closely resembles the small form\r\n    of _H. Sequoicola_ in shape, but being nearly bleached is\r\n    too imperfect to describe minutely, though very likely a new\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    It is remarkable for having seven whorls, while the former\r\n    and _H. Mormonum_ of the same size have but six; it is also\r\n    less compressed than the latter, and the umbilicus is less\r\n    covered. The color where remaining is shining gamboge yellow\r\n    (faded?) with a _single_ very narrow band _above_ the middle,\r\n    not showing the pale band on each side of it that is so marked\r\n    in others of the group. The sculpture seems to have been very\r\n    _slightly_ malleated, and with the faint lines of growth\r\n    cut by smooth depressed waved grooves transversely, and thus\r\n    obliquely to the sutures (while those of _H. Traskii_ are\r\n    parallel).\r\n\r\n    Diam. maj. 0.95; alt. 0.40 inch.\r\n\r\n    A region so near San Francisco ought to furnish more and better\r\n    specimens.\r\n\r\n    There is a form referred to _H. fidelis_, from Humboldt Bay,\r\n    which may also prove a new species. It is entirely purplish\r\n    black, _without bands_, the lips white inside, and differs from\r\n    _infumata_ chiefly in great elevation and thicker lips, having\r\n    even the subcarinate body whorl of the latter, and the same\r\n    number of whorls (6½). There is, however, no trace of bristle\r\n    marks, and some specimens appear to connect it with _fidelis_,\r\n    suggesting a possibility of its being a hybrid.\r\n\r\n    The State Collection contains one specimen, obtained from the\r\n    late Dr. Frick.\r\n\r\n    Diam. maj. 1.24; min. 1.09; alt. 0.70 inch.\r\n\r\n    [24] In this the band seems obscured in the general blackness\r\n    of the shell; occasional varieties of several others are found\r\n    without the band, as if from disease, as in _H. anachoreta_.\r\n\r\n    [25] These species have parallel spiral grooves, not _rugæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 16TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFive members present.\r\n\r\nMr. Horace F. Cutter was elected a Resident Member.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on rooms reported that two rooms had been hired for the\r\nAcademy on the southeast corner of Montgomery and Sacramento streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MAY 7TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEight members present.\r\n\r\nMr. Harford presented some ivory nuts from Panama.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons made some remarks explanatory of a series of tables which\r\nhe exhibited, showing the variations of rain fall at San Francisco, and\r\ntheir relation to the phases of the moon. He showed that the greatest\r\namount of rain fell immediately before the time of full moon, and that,\r\nfollowing the day of the full, the diminution in quantity was very rapid.\r\nThe series of observations from which the tables were prepared extended\r\nover a period of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons remarked that he proposed continuing the investigation of the\r\nsubject of the connection of the moon’s phases with the fall of rain, and\r\nthat he would prepare a paper on the subject.\r\n\r\nConsiderable discussion followed on the subject of the weather of this\r\ncoast, in which nearly all the members present took part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MAY 21ST, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Academy met for the first time in its new rooms on the corner of\r\nMontgomery and Sacramento streets; twelve members were present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the cabinet: Two boxes of shells, from the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: Bulletins de l’Académie Royale des Sciences\r\nde Belgique (2) XVIII, XIX, 1864-5.

H. DALL, ACTING DIRECTOR SCI. CORPS, W. U. T. EX.\r\n\r\n    A paper was read by Dr. Isaac Lea, before the Philadelphia\r\n    Academy of Natural Sciences, April 1st, 1856, in which he\r\n    described a new genus (_Pompholyx_) and species (_P. effusa_,\r\n    Lea) of fluviatile mollusca, from California. He placed it in\r\n    the _Family_ LYMNÆANA without remark.\r\n\r\n    In the “_Genera of Recent mollusca_,” by H. & A. Adams, it\r\n    is referred to (Vol. II, p. 645, Pl. CXXXVIII, fig. 11) as\r\n    the only species of the genus and is placed in the _Family_\r\n    LIMNÆIDÆ.\r\n\r\n    It is not mentioned by Chenu, in the “_Manuel de\r\n    Conchyliologie_.”\r\n\r\n    In the “_Supplementary Report to the British Association_,” by\r\n    Dr. P. P. Carpenter (page 674), are given the views of Mr. W.\r\n    G. Binney, one of the most eminent of American conchologists\r\n    and particularly devoted to the Pulmonates. He places the\r\n    mollusk in question, between the genera _Limnæa_ and _Physa_,\r\n    in the _Subfamily_ LIMNÆINÆ, of the _Family_ LIMNÆIDÆ.\r\n\r\n    Investigations as to the animal, however, suggest the propriety\r\n    of separating it, if not (as a _Family Pompholidæ_) entirely\r\n    from the _Family_ LIMNÆIDÆ, at least in a subfamily by itself.\r\n\r\n    In the few specimens which I have been able to examine with\r\n    regard to the dentition, the dried animal has not yielded very\r\n    satisfactory results, and I do not, therefore, feel justified\r\n    in entirely separating it until more is known.\r\n\r\n    In the following table, a West Coast species is given as a type\r\n    of each genus:\r\n\r\n    CLASS PULMONATA.\r\n\r\n    _Family_ LIMNÆIDÆ, H. & A.

E. Clayton, the\r\n    examination of which has added considerably to our scanty stock\r\n    of information in regard to the geology of an extensive region\r\n    comprised between the meridians of 115° and 120°, and the\r\n    parallels of 38° and 41°, I take this occasion to set forth, in\r\n    a very concise manner, the information which I have collected,\r\n    up to the present time, in regard to the age of the sedimentary\r\n    formations of the regions in question.\r\n\r\n    The State of Nevada occupies a portion of the continent which,\r\n    during the last few years, has received a large share of\r\n    attention from the public and excited the greatest interest\r\n    among scientific men; but where, up to the present time,\r\n    detailed geological work has been impossible, owing to the\r\n    absence of any geographical map of the State approaching even\r\n    to accuracy.\r\n\r\n    The U. S. Pacific Railroad Surveys furnished no geological\r\n    information whatever in regard to the territory embraced\r\n    within the present area of the State of Nevada. The route\r\n    from Salt Lake to Humboldt River, at Lassen’s Meadows, was\r\n    hastily explored by Captain Beckwith, in May, 1854, and he was\r\n    accompanied by Mr. Schiel as Geologist; but no information\r\n    of any value is given in regard to the geological structure\r\n    of the region traversed by the party, nor were any fossils\r\n    discovered, although portions of the rocks along their route\r\n    have since been proved to be prolific in organic remains.\r\n\r\n    On all the geological maps of the whole territory of the United\r\n    States which have been published up to the present time, the\r\n    region west of the Rocky Mountains has been so misrepresented\r\n    that it is quite impossible to trace any approximation,\r\n    or first hinting, at either the age or the outline of the\r\n    principal formations. On these maps the region lying between\r\n    the Salt Lake and the Sierra Nevada is usually left uncolored,\r\n    or vaguely designated as “metamorphic” with patches of\r\n    “volcanic” and “desert quaternary” scattered through it at\r\n    random.[26]\r\n\r\n    The first paper or publication issued, in which any\r\n    definite information in regard to the geology of Nevada was\r\n    given, was that of Messrs. Meek and Engelmann, published\r\n    in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural\r\n    Sciences, for April, 1860. This paper gives the results of\r\n    the examination by Mr. Meek, of the fossils obtained by\r\n    Mr. H. Engelmann, who accompanied Capt. J. H. Simpson on\r\n    his explorations of 1858-59, or what is generally known as\r\n    “Simpson’s Wagon Road Expedition.” As the full report of\r\n    this expedition has never been published, we have no other\r\n    information in regard to the geology of the region traversed\r\n    by Capt. Simpson’s party than that given in the paper above\r\n    alluded to. The route followed on this survey was one near\r\n    the present Overland Stage Road, passing through a region\r\n    then entirely uninhabited by white men, but now dotted with\r\n    mining camps and even towns of considerable size—a region which\r\n    has been proved to contain a large number of argentiferous\r\n    veins, and where mining operations have been carried on most\r\n    energetically and extensively during the last two or three\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    The localities of fossils mentioned by Messrs. Meek and\r\n    Engelmann, and included within the limits of Nevada, are\r\n    as follows: Long. 114° 45´, Lat 39° 45´, near what is now\r\n    called Egan Cañon, fragments of Trilobites, either of Upper\r\n    Silurian or Devonian Age, and “closely resembling Hamilton\r\n    Group Forms:”—Long. 115° 58´, Lat. 39° 33´, and Long. 115°\r\n    36´, Lat. 39° 30´; at these two localities, situated in what\r\n    are now the Eureka and White Pine Mining Districts, a “group\r\n    of fossils of decided Devonian type” was found. This group\r\n    consisted of _Atrypa reticularis_, _A. aspera_, or a closely\r\n    allied species, a small _Productus_, and three new species of\r\n    _Spirifer_. This is the most westerly point, on our territory,\r\n    at which any fossils belonging to formations older than the\r\n    Carboniferous have, up to the present time, been discovered,\r\n    so far at least as any published record shows. Between Lon.\r\n    115° and 115° 30´ and Lat. 40° 10´ and 39° 20´, is a group or\r\n    series of hills, trending nearly north and south, and made\r\n    up “of light yellowish gray, more or less argillaceous and\r\n    arenaceous subcrystalline limestones and slates.” From these\r\n    hills fossils were collected which are referred by Mr. Meek\r\n    to the Upper Carboniferous series. Most of the species were\r\n    new; among them were three species of _Productus_, two new\r\n    species of _Spirifer_, and another apparently identical with\r\n    _S. cameratus_; also, _Athyris subtilita_ and a new species\r\n    of _Chonetes_ closely allied to _C. Verneuiliana_; these\r\n    localities are near what is now known as Ruby Valley and Fort\r\n    Ruby.\r\n\r\n    The above are all the localities of fossils, in Nevada, known\r\n    to have been published up to this time, excepting those\r\n    which have been described or noticed in the publications\r\n    of the Geological Survey of California. Messrs. Meek and\r\n    Engelmann state, at the end of their paper, that igneous rocks\r\n    predominate west of the 116th degree of longitude as far as\r\n    the Sierra Nevada, and that only a few traces of stratified\r\n    rock were found in that district in none of which any organic\r\n    remains were observed. The exploration of this region, supposed\r\n    to be destitute of fossiliferous rocks, has proved, however,\r\n    that it contains immense ranges of stratified beds which, in a\r\n    considerable number of localities at least, are highly prolific\r\n    in well preserved fossils.\r\n\r\n    As soon as the Humboldt mining region began to be resorted to\r\n    by miners, which was in 1861 and 1862, fossils were discovered\r\n    by several persons, who about the same time furnished us\r\n    with collections of value and interest. The most important\r\n    of these collections were those of Mr. Gorham Blake and of\r\n    Mr. R. Homfray. The specimens obtained by these gentlemen, as\r\n    well as others of the same age obtained by the Survey, near\r\n    Dayton, Nevada, and also in Genesee Valley, California, were\r\n    figured and described by Mr. Gabb in the first volume of the\r\n    Palæontology of California, forming a part of the series of\r\n    publications of the Geological Survey. The geological age\r\n    of the formation is that of the Hallstadt Limestone of the\r\n    Austrian Alps, or the Upper Trias, there being several species\r\n    at the above cited localities which are identical with European\r\n    species from this geological position, as determined by Mr.\r\n    Gabb, and confirmed by Von Hauer, the eminent palæontologist of\r\n    the Austrian Geological Survey.[27]\r\n\r\n    Since the publication of the Palæontology of California, Vol.\r\n    I, our stock of information with regard to the range and extent\r\n    of the Upper Trias, in Nevada, has been considerably increased\r\n    by the explorations of members of the Survey, and other persons\r\n    who have furnished us with specimens from their collections, or\r\n    given us information as to the character of the rocks noticed\r\n    by them on their lines of travel. We now know that the Triassic\r\n    rocks occupy a broad belt of country extending from the 117th\r\n    meridian west to the line dividing the States of Nevada and\r\n    California, and lying between the parallels of 38° and 40°.\r\n    Within the area thus designated, Triassic fossils have been\r\n    found at several localities, some of which are remarkable\r\n    for the number and good state of preservation of the various\r\n    species. Among these localities that of the Volcano District\r\n    is remarkable for the size and beauty of the Ammonites found\r\n    there. This is about thirty miles east of the south end of\r\n    Walker’s Lake. New Pass District, twenty miles west of Austin,\r\n    is also a rich locality of Triassic fossils At two or three\r\n    points within this Triassic area there are indications of the\r\n    existence of fossiliferous rocks occupying a higher position\r\n    than the Trias, and perhaps of Liassic Age; but the collections\r\n    have not yet been sufficiently studied to justify a positive\r\n    opinion on this point.\r\n\r\n    The sedimentary strata in this region are much broken up and\r\n    metamorphosed by intrusive rocks, of which there is a great\r\n    variety, granite being one of the most abundant. In the\r\n    southern portion of the area designated above as including\r\n    stratified rocks of Triassic age, a very large part of the\r\n    surface is occupied by volcanic materials, apparently a\r\n    continuation of the very recent volcanic masses near Mono Lake.\r\n    Lava is said to be the predominating rock over the region to\r\n    the southeast of Walker’s Lake, and as far in that direction\r\n    as the State line between Nevada and Arizona. The same is true\r\n    of the region to the north and northwest of Humboldt River,\r\n    where granitic and volcanic rocks are reported as occurring,\r\n    and where, so far as known, no fossils have yet been obtained.\r\n    This, however, is a region as yet but little explored, on\r\n    account of the number and warlike disposition of the Indians.\r\n\r\n    Between the 116th and 117th meridians is a region of granitic\r\n    and volcanic rocks, including two principal north and south\r\n    ranges, and many spurs and side ranges. The Toiyabe range,\r\n    in which are the mines of Austin, or the Reese River mines,\r\n    and which is a little east of the 117th meridian, is mostly\r\n    granitic. Stratified but highly metamorphosed rocks are said\r\n    by Mr. Blatchley to occur on its east flank, a few miles south\r\n    of Austin; these rocks contain fossils, which, however, are\r\n    nearly obliterated by metamorphism. A box of these, forwarded\r\n    some time since, has never been received, so that no positive\r\n    statement can be made as to the age of the formation. From Mr.\r\n    Blatchley’s description of the forms observed by him, it would\r\n    appear that we may have here rocks older than the Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n    East of the 116th meridian, our collections indicate the\r\n    existence of a broad area covered chiefly by rocks of\r\n    Carboniferous age, which seem to occupy most of the space\r\n    between the 115th and 116th meridians. The most western\r\n    locality of Carboniferous fossils known to us is that on the\r\n    west side of Diamond Valley, about 70 miles east of Austin, and\r\n    in lon. 116°. Here, in a dark, crystalline limestone, a variety\r\n    of species have been obtained by Mr. Clayton, all in a poor\r\n    state of preservation, but of which the Carboniferous age may\r\n    be without difficulty made out. Among the genera represented\r\n    at this locality are _Productus_—two species, one of which\r\n    is _P. semireticulatus_—_Spirifer_, and _Fusulina_, probably\r\n    _F. gracilis_, besides some indistinctly marked corals. The\r\n    indications are that these beds are of Lower Carboniferous age.\r\n    On the east side of Diamond Valley some imperfectly preserved\r\n    corals have been found, probably Devonian, or possibly\r\n    belonging to a still older group. The collections from the\r\n    region included between the 115th and 116th meridians indicate\r\n    the association of rocks of both Devonian and Carboniferous\r\n    age in the outcrops. Here our collections do not enable us to\r\n    do anything more than to corroborate the previously published\r\n    statements of Messrs. Meek and Engelmann in regard to the age\r\n    of the formations.\r\n\r\n    From the Silver Peak District, near lon. 117° 20´, and lat.\r\n    38°, an interesting collection of fossils has been brought\r\n    by Mr. Clayton. The specimens are unfortunately in a very\r\n    imperfect and fragmentary condition, but they contain the first\r\n    trilobites which have been brought to our office from any of\r\n    the Pacific States or Territories. The rock in which they occur\r\n    is a dark yellowish brown limestone, with intercalated layers\r\n    of light grey argillaceous shales. Some of them appear to\r\n    belong to the genus _Dalmania_, and, if so, the formation is\r\n    probably of Upper Silurian age, although possibly Devonian. The\r\n    careful examination of the corals which have been obtained in\r\n    this district by Mr. Clayton, and also by Mr. Blatchley, will\r\n    probably throw some additional light on the geological position\r\n    of these rocks.\r\n\r\n    [26] On Professor Hall’s Map “illustrating the general\r\n    geological features of the country west of the Mississippi\r\n    River,” which accompanied Emory’s Mexican Boundary Report,\r\n    and was published in 1857, all of a broad central strip\r\n    running along the parallel of 40° through the center of\r\n    Nevada, is colored as “lava and other igneous rocks,” while\r\n    the western portion of the State has several broad belts of\r\n    “Upper Carboniferous Limestone,” running north and south\r\n    across it from Walker’s Lake to Goose Lake. So far as I know,\r\n    no Carboniferous fossils have yet been found in that part of\r\n    Nevada.\r\n\r\n    [27] See Jahrbuch der K. K.

That it does not migrate is\r\n    proved by the fact that, living in nooks and crevices of the\r\n    rocks, it grows into the very form of the hole in which it\r\n    lives.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dall also mentioned that, having visited and thoroughly\r\n    searched the original locality for _Helix Californiensis_, a\r\n    small island off Point Cypress, accessible only at low tide,\r\n    this species was found to be nearly exterminated. A letter\r\n    received from Dr. Canfield of Monterey since the visit of Mr.\r\n    Dall, confirms the fact of the extinction. This has been caused\r\n    apparently by a large millipede, which exists in great numbers,\r\n    and is extremely voracious.\r\n\r\n    Several of the shells found commonly at Monterey, are identical\r\n    with others collected during the past season on the coast of\r\n    Russian North America.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney made some remarks on the absence of the Northern Drift\r\nformation from the western coast of North America and from the interior\r\nof the continent, throughout the region to the southwest of the Missouri\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n    The term “Northern Drift” is understood to include the masses\r\n    of unstratified detrital materials and boulders which have been\r\n    transported and distributed by some general cause independent,\r\n    in a great degree, of the present conformation of the surface\r\n    and of the direction of the existing river courses. The\r\n    investigations of geologists have shown that the surface of\r\n    Canada, New England, and the States north of the Ohio and\r\n    north of the parallel of 39°, as far west as the Mississippi,\r\n    and even for some distance beyond it in that direction, are\r\n    covered by detrital materials which have been carried from the\r\n    North towards the South, and often for a great distance and in\r\n    immense masses.\r\n\r\n    The explorations of the Geological Survey of California have\r\n    demonstrated however, that there is no true Northern Drift\r\n    within the limits of this State. Our detrital materials,\r\n    which often form deposits of great extent and thickness, are\r\n    invariably found to have been dependent for their origin and\r\n    present position on causes similar to those now in action, and\r\n    to have been deposited on the flanks and at the bases of the\r\n    nearest mountain ranges by currents of water rushing down their\r\n    slopes. While we have abundant evidence of the former existence\r\n    of extensive glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, there is no reason\r\n    to suppose that this ice was to any extent an effective agent\r\n    in the transportation of the superficial detritus now resting\r\n    on the flanks of the mountains. The glaciers were confined\r\n    to the most elevated portions of the mountains, and although\r\n    the moraines which they have left as evidences of their\r\n    former extension are often large and conspicuous, they are\r\n    insignificant in comparison with the detrital masses formed\r\n    by aqueous erosion. There is nothing anywhere in California\r\n    which indicates a general glacial epoch during which ice\r\n    covered the whole country and moved bodies of detritus over the\r\n    surface, independently of its present configuration, as is seen\r\n    throughout the Northeastern States.\r\n\r\n    The same condition of things prevails in Nevada and through\r\n    Oregon, as far as explored by the members of the Survey. The\r\n    detritus seems always to be accumulated at the base of the\r\n    mountains—gravel, boulders, and sand lying below and not far\r\n    distant from the beds of rock of which these materials once\r\n    formed a part, and from which they appear to have been detached\r\n    by weathering and aqueous erosion.\r\n\r\n    From the observations of Messrs. Ashburner and Dall, it would\r\n    appear that no evidences of Northern Drift have yet been\r\n    detected on this Coast, even as far north as British Columbia\r\n    or Russian America. Neither of these gentlemen has observed\r\n    any indication of a transportation of drift materials from the\r\n    north towards the south, or of any condition of things similar\r\n    to that which must have existed in the Eastern States during\r\n    the diluvial epoch.\r\n\r\n    On examining the published records of explorers in the central\r\n    portion of the Continent, it will be noticed that there is\r\n    strong reason to believe that the absence of the Northern drift\r\n    formation is not peculiar to the States along the Pacific\r\n    Coast; but that the whole region west of the Rocky Mountains is\r\n    also destitute of any indications of a detrital formation moved\r\n    over the surface in one direction by any great general cause.\r\n    Judging from our present stock of evidence, I am inclined to\r\n    draw the line which limits the Northern Drift formation on the\r\n    south and west approximately from the mouth of the Ohio to the\r\n    headwaters of the Saskatchewan River.\r\n\r\n    It is evident that these facts should be taken into account\r\n    in theorizing on the origin and cause of the drift. If, as\r\n    stated above, the transporting agent has been limited in its\r\n    field of action to the eastern and northeastern portion of our\r\n    Continent, the phenomenon is seen at once to have become, in a\r\n    measure, a local one—at least much more local than has hitherto\r\n    been usually assumed by those geologists who have adopted the\r\n    glacier theory of the drift.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney remarked that he was particularly desirous of\r\nintroducing the subject on this occasion, in order that he might have\r\nan opportunity of impressing on Mr. Dall, who is about to leave for the\r\nNorthern Coast, on the Telegraph Expedition, the importance of making a\r\nthorough examination of the detrital formations and surface geology of\r\nthe country he may traverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JUNE 18TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirteen members present.\r\n\r\nThe following named gentlemen were elected Resident Members: Baron F. von\r\nRichthofen, E.

E. C. STEARNS, CURATOR OF CONCHOLOGY, CAB. ACAD. NAT. SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n    The comparative scantiness of molluscan life in the immediate\r\n    vicinity of San Francisco, and of the coast for many miles in\r\n    a southerly direction, led me to believe that an exploration\r\n    of the small bays to the north of the Golden Gate would reveal\r\n    a very considerable increase both of species and individuals;\r\n    accordingly, upon the 14th, 23d, and 24th of last June, I\r\n    visited the small inlet known as Baulines Bay, and made an\r\n    examination of the sandspit which makes out from its southerly\r\n    shore, also the beach inside of and as far north as Duxbury\r\n    reef, which latter connects with the coast at a point about a\r\n    mile above the entrance to the bay. The unfavorable condition\r\n    of the tides prevented an exploration of the reef; as most of\r\n    the specimens were obtained from the drift, without doubt the\r\n    following list can be largely increased by a more thorough\r\n    examination of the locality, especially the reef, at extreme\r\n    low water and at different seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n    All of the specimens were in a condition sufficiently perfect\r\n    to make identification easy; a few forms, of which I had some\r\n    doubt, were submitted to Dr. J.

He read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of a Human Skull, recently taken from a Shaft near Angel’s,\r\nCalaveras County.\r\n\r\nBY J. D. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n    This skull was taken from a shaft sunk on a mining claim at\r\n    Altaville, near Angel’s, in Calaveras County, by Mr. James\r\n    Matson. By him it was given to Mr. Scribner, of Angel’s, and\r\n    by Mr. Scribner to Dr. Jones. Mr. Matson states that the skull\r\n    was found at a depth of about one hundred and thirty feet, in\r\n    a bed of gravel five feet in thickness, above which are four\r\n    beds of consolidated volcanic ash, locally known as “lava”;\r\n    these volcanic beds are separated from each other by layers of\r\n    gravel, and Mr. Matson gives the following as the section of\r\n    the various deposits passed through in sinking the shaft, which\r\n    is one hundred and fifty-three feet deep, to the bed rock:\r\n\r\n     1. Black lava         40 feet.\r\n     2. Gravel              3  ”\r\n     3. Light lava         30  ”\r\n     4. Gravel              5  ”\r\n     5. Light lava         15  ”\r\n     6. Gravel             25  ”\r\n     7. Dark brown lava     9  ”\r\n     8. Gravel              5  ”\r\n     9. Red lava            4  ”\r\n    10. Red Gravel         17  ”\r\n                          ---\r\n                          153 feet.\r\n\r\n    The skull was found, according to Mr. Matson, in bed number\r\n    8, just above the lowest stratum of lava. With the skull were\r\n    found fragments of silicified wood, the whole being covered and\r\n    partly incrusted with stony matter, so that the fact of its\r\n    being a skull was not recognized until after it had passed into\r\n    Mr. Scribner’s hands, by whom it was cleaned and presented to\r\n    Dr. Jones.\r\n\r\n    The skull is said by Mr. Matson to have been taken from the\r\n    shaft February 25th, 1866, and it came into my hands in the\r\n    July following, when I immediately proceeded to the locality;\r\n    but found the shaft temporarily abandoned and partly filled\r\n    with water, so that it was impossible at that time to make any\r\n    farther search in the bed from which the skull was procured.\r\n    A careful inquiry into all the circumstances of the alleged\r\n    discovery, and an interview with all the persons who had been\r\n    in any way connected with it, impressed upon my mind the\r\n    conviction that the facts were as stated above, and that there\r\n    was every reason to believe that the skull really came from\r\n    the position assigned to it by Mr. Matson. Still, as it is\r\n    evidently highly desirable that as large an amount of evidence\r\n    as possible should be accumulated in regard to a discovery\r\n    of so much importance, I made arrangements that I should be\r\n    notified whenever the shaft was reopened and the water taken\r\n    out, and hope at a future meeting to be able to lay before\r\n    the Academy the results of a personal examination of this\r\n    interesting locality, and of further excavations in the bed\r\n    from which the skull was taken.\r\n\r\n    Assuming the correctness of Mr. Matson’s statements, this relic\r\n    of human antiquity is easily seen to be an object of the\r\n    greatest interest to the ethnologist as well as the geologist.\r\n    The previous investigations of the Geological Survey have\r\n    clearly demonstrated the fact that man was contemporaneous\r\n    with the mastodon and elephant, since the works of his hands\r\n    have been repeatedly found in such connection with the bones\r\n    of these animals that it would be impossible to account for\r\n    the facts observed on any other theory. (See Geology of\r\n    California, Vol. I, p. 252.) But in the case of the skull now\r\n    laid before the Academy, the geological position to which it\r\n    must be assigned is, apparently, still lower than that of the\r\n    mastodon, since the remains of this animal, as well as the\r\n    elephant, which are so abundantly scattered over this State,\r\n    are always (so far as our observations yet extend) limited in\r\n    their position to the superficial deposits, and have never been\r\n    found at any considerable depth below the surface. There is\r\n    every reason to believe that these great proboscidians lived at\r\n    a very recent date, (geologically speaking) and posterior to\r\n    the epoch of the existence of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada,\r\n    and also after the close of the period of activity of the now\r\n    extinct volcanoes of that great chain. In fact, they belong to\r\n    the present epoch. The bed, on the other hand, in which this\r\n    skull was found, must have been deposited at a time when the\r\n    volcanoes of the Sierra were still in vigorous action, and, as\r\n    seems to us highly probable from a careful consideration of the\r\n    geological structure of the region, previous to the glacial\r\n    epoch of the Sierra, and also previous to the erosion of the\r\n    cañons of the present rivers. No pains will be spared, however,\r\n    to investigate all the conditions of the occurrence of this\r\n    skull, and they will be fully reported on at a future time.\r\n\r\n    The portions of the skull which are preserved are, the frontal\r\n    bone, the nasal bone, the superior maxillary bone of the right\r\n    side, the malar bones, a part of the temporal bone of the left\r\n    side, with the mastoid process and the zygomatic process,\r\n    and the whole of the orbits of both eyes. The base of the\r\n    skull is embedded in a mass of bone breccia and small pebbles\r\n    of volcanic rock, incrusted with a thin layer of carbonate\r\n    of lime, which appears once to have extended over the whole\r\n    surface of the skull and of which a considerable portion still\r\n    remains, the rest having been removed apparently in the process\r\n    of cleaning. Under the malar bone of the left side, a snail\r\n    shell is lodged, and partly concealed by the breccia of bone\r\n    wedged in the cavity. This shell is the _Helix Mormonum_,\r\n    according to Dr. Cooper, a species now living in the region\r\n    where the skull was obtained. Although not competent to express\r\n    a decided opinion on the subject of the ethnological relations\r\n    of this skull, I should suppose that it belonged to the type\r\n    of the Indians now inhabiting the foot-hills of the Sierra. It\r\n    is certain that the facial angle is not one indicating a low\r\n    order of intellect. The skull, however, seems to have been very\r\n    thick and solid. It will be placed in the hands of competent\r\n    craniologists for examination and description, as soon as\r\n    reliable information has been obtained with regard to its\r\n    occurrence, or whenever all has been ascertained that can be.\r\n\r\nDr. Macgowan made some remarks on the occurrence of earthquakes on the\r\ncoast of China. He stated that, since the historic period, no great\r\ndamage has been done by them.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg stated, that on a trip from San Rafael to Baulines Bay he had\r\ndiscovered a species of oak said to be equal to the live-oak for ship\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 6TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty members present.\r\n\r\nDr. D. J. Macgowan was elected a Corresponding Member.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr presented the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nEnumeration of the Californian species of Lycæna.\r\n\r\nBY H. BEHR, M.D.\r\n\r\n    The genus _Lycæna_ is much more extensively represented in\r\n    California than in the Atlantic States, where, with the\r\n    exception of a few Arctic species, only the most cosmopolitan\r\n    types are represented, such as that of _Argiolus_ and that of\r\n    _Amyntas_.\r\n\r\n    California has about the same number of species as a\r\n    corresponding area in the Mediterranean basin. The species are\r\n    never identical with gerontogeic forms; but there is scarcely\r\n    a single European type that does not find its analogue on\r\n    the Pacific coast: a circumstance of which the celebrated\r\n    lepidopterologist, Dr. Boisduval, has made good use in naming\r\n    many Californian species with reference to the best known\r\n    European species of the same type, thus:\r\n\r\n    _Europe._   _California._\r\n\r\n    Pheretes,    Pheres,\r\n    Acis,        Antiacis,\r\n    Aegon,       Antægon,\r\n    Icarius,     Icarioides.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1. _Lycæna Pardalis_, Behr.\r\n\r\n    Alæ ♂ ris superne omnes cæruleæ, marginem versus fuscescentes,\r\n    limbo albido cinctæ.\r\n\r\n    Alæ ♀ næ superne omnino fuscæ, marginem versus magis obscuræ,\r\n    anticæ linea discoidali instructae.\r\n\r\n    Alæ subtus cinereæ, linea discoidali serieque punctorum\r\n    atrorum, halone parum distincto cinctorum signatæ. Posticæ\r\n    marginem versus lunulas exhibent pallidiores quam puncta seriei\r\n    et lineæ discoidalis.\r\n\r\n    This species is the only Californian yet known that approaches\r\n    the type of the European species _L. Arion_, _L. Euphemus_, _L.\r\n    Iolas_, _L. Alcon_, _L. Erebus_. It approaches most nearly to\r\n    _L. Alcon_ of Europe, and is intermediate between that and the\r\n    European _L. Acis_.\r\n\r\n    The only habitat of this species yet known to me, is in the\r\n    Contra Costa Coast Range, in the vicinity of San Antonio, where\r\n    it frequents steep, grassy hill-sides. It is found at the end\r\n    of May and beginning of June, and is rather rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n    2. _L. Antiacis_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    May. Different localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n    3. _L.

Piasus_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    Very common throughout middle California. It replaces the\r\n    Atlantic _L. Pseudargiolus_, and _L. neglecta_, Edw., as well\r\n    as the European _L. Argiolus_; and belongs to one of the most\r\n    cosmopolitan types of the genus. The caterpillar feeds on the\r\n    flowers of the _Pavia_, unlike its European representative,\r\n    which feeds on the leaves of _Rhamnus frangula_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    5. _L.

May and June. Likes to repose on\r\n    _Eriogonum_, and is only to be found where some species of this\r\n    genus is abundant. Probably the caterpillar feeds on the flower\r\n    of this plant.

It was\r\n    found at an elevation of 11,000 feet and over, on the snowy\r\n    heights surrounding the headwaters of the Tuolumne River. It\r\n    belongs to the type of the European _Orbitulus_, which is found\r\n    in similar regions of the Alps.\r\n\r\n\r\n    13. _L.

Pars radicalis anticarum\r\n    concolor, posticarum nonnullis punctis minimis sed distincte\r\n    halone cinctis signata; lunularum series marginalium duplex\r\n    sed parum distincta, spatia fulva amplectens, quæ tamen non\r\n    semper distingui possunt, in posticis lunulæ exteriores seriei\r\n    splendore metallico micantes.\r\n\r\n    Alæ ♀ næ subtus magis distincte signatæ; spatia fulva\r\n    submarginalia nec non splendor metallicus lunularum distinctius\r\n    videtur.\r\n\r\n    This species is found in the Sierra Nevada. It is very similar\r\n    to _L. Scudderi_ of the Atlantic coast, and may prove to be\r\n    only a local variety of that species, from which it differs\r\n    chiefly in the shape and arrangement of the submarginal\r\n    markings, which, however, in the Atlantic coast specimens, are\r\n    much more distinct than in those from California.\r\n\r\n\r\n    14. _L.

Lunulas marginales in posticis\r\n    metallice micant.\r\n\r\n    Of this species I possess only one specimen; but this differs\r\n    so much from the other California Lycænæ, that I consider\r\n    myself justified in giving a diagnosis of it, although, as a\r\n    rule, descriptions of Lepidoptera belonging to complicated and\r\n    difficult groups should not be given without ample material on\r\n    which to base them.\r\n\r\n    This specimen is from Mono Lake, and was collected by the\r\n    Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n    15. _L.

It represents the European _L. Battus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    16. _L. Enoptes_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    Hills near the Mission Dolores, and in the San Bruno Hills.\r\n    This species is rather rare. It represents the European _L.\r\n    Aegon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    17. _L. Antægon_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    The most common species near San Francisco, and found nearly\r\n    everywhere through Central California. There are several\r\n    generations succeeding each other through the year. A specimen\r\n    I received from the head-waters of the San Joaquin River\r\n    differs somewhat from this; but as I have only one of this\r\n    variety, I will not venture to express a decided opinion\r\n    in regard to it. It is, perhaps, an Alpine variety, and\r\n    corresponding with a similar one of _L. Sæpiolus_, of which I\r\n    received several specimens forming a series of transitions from\r\n    the common type.\r\n\r\n\r\n    18.\r\n\r\n    There is a species approaching the European _L. Agestis_,\r\n    and which I received from the head-waters of the San Joaquin\r\n    River; but the specimens in my possession are too imperfect to\r\n    allow of an accurate description being given.\r\n\r\n\r\n    19. _L. Amyntula_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    From the Contra Costa hills, where, in May and June, it\r\n    frequents the flowers of the Pavia, on which the caterpillar\r\n    probably feeds, as does that of _L. Piasus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    20. _L. exilis_, Boisd.\r\n\r\n    This species is rare, and so small that it might easily be\r\n    overlooked. It frequents low meadows and salt marshes, where it\r\n    loves to repose on the succulent stems of Salicornia, and on\r\n    the flowers of Frankenia. At present it seems to be the only\r\n    Californian representative of _L. Telicanus_ and _Boeticus_\r\n    of Europe; but I think that several species of this type will\r\n    be found in Southern California, when that part of the State\r\n    has been better examined. I have a specimen of _L. exilis_,\r\n    collected by Baron de Terloo, in the Sierra Madre, between\r\n    Mazatlan and Durango; and I received, from the same gentleman,\r\n    several species of the same type from that locality.\r\n\r\n    It is this type which is so numerously represented in the\r\n    tropical regions of the old world, and also in extra-tropical\r\n    Australia. Our depauperated species, _L. exilis_, with its two\r\n    European congeners, are, so far as I know, the only ones of\r\n    this type which are found in the northern hemisphere beyond the\r\n    tropics.\r\n\r\n    All the other Californian species belong to types of the\r\n    temperate zone, and are such as are rarely met with in tropical\r\n    countries, or in the southern hemisphere even out of the\r\n    tropics. The type of _Amyntula_ is the only one which has a\r\n    series of species in tropical Asia; but, as far as I know,\r\n    none in tropical America. The type of _Piasus_, also, has some\r\n    representatives in the tropics of both continents, one of them\r\n    being even identified with a species of Southern Europe.\r\n\r\n    As to the other types, these species are essentially endemic;\r\n    and even among the Arctic species there seems not to be any\r\n    amphigeic one. As the males vary very little, and the females\r\n    only on their upper side, there is little difficulty in\r\n    transcribing and recognizing them. If among our species there\r\n    is any one which is identical with an Atlantic one, it is\r\n    probably Argyrotoxus, which may be a local modification of _L.\r\n    Scudderi_, Edw.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Shells collected at Santa Barbara and San Diego by Mr. J.\r\nHepburn, in February-March, 1866.\r\n\r\nWITH REMARKS UPON SOME OF THE SPECIES,\r\n\r\nBY ROBT.

WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n    Among some specimens brought from the vicinity of La Paz,\r\n    Lower California, by Mr. Rémond, about three years since, was\r\n    one which attracted my attention, as it seemed to contain an\r\n    undescribed mineral. I therefore made an analysis of it and\r\n    found it to consist of tungstic acid, oxide of copper, and\r\n    lime, with a small quantity of water, probably not essential to\r\n    its composition. The results of the analysis were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Tungstic Acid        79.69\r\n    Oxide of Copper       6.77\r\n    Lime                 10.95\r\n    Protoxide of Iron      .31\r\n    Water                 1.40\r\n                         -----\r\n                         99.12\r\n\r\n    On examining to ascertain if there was any known mineral having\r\n    a composition similar to this, I found that a tungstate of lime\r\n    containing copper had been described by Domeyko as occurring\r\n    in the copper mines of Llamuco, near Chuapa, in the province\r\n    of Coquimbo, in Chili, where it was discovered by M. Gay\r\n    (Annales des Mines (4) iii, 15). That mineral, however, only\r\n    contained 3.3 per cent. of oxide of copper, while the one of\r\n    which the analysis is given above contains 6.77 per cent. of\r\n    that substance. M. Domeyko calls the mineral analyzed by him\r\n    “Scheelin calcaire cuivreux,” but does not attempt to give a\r\n    formula for it, or to decide whether it is entitled to rank as\r\n    a distinct species.\r\n\r\n    The Lower California mineral, of which the analysis is given\r\n    above, occurs in a red metamorphic rock, associated with black\r\n    tourmaline. It is crystalline-granular in structure, with a\r\n    distinct cleavage in one direction, and seems to be homogeneous\r\n    throughout. Its hardness is about that of Scheelite; luster,\r\n    highly vitreous; streak, very light greenish-gray; color,\r\n    pistachio green, passing to olive and leek green. Before the\r\n    blowpipe in the glass tube it blackens, and gives off a little\r\n    water. On charcoal it blackens instantly, becomes rounded on\r\n    the edges, with a little intumescence, and gradually acquires\r\n    the appearance of a slag, in which numerous fine points\r\n    of metallic copper are seen. With the fluxes it gives the\r\n    reactions of tungstic acid and copper. It is easily dissolved\r\n    by chlorohydric acid, with separation of tungstic acid.\r\n\r\n    From the appearance of the mineral, I am inclined to regard it\r\n    as having a definite composition, represented by the formula\r\n    CuO WO₃+2 (CaO WO₃); this formula would require the following\r\n    composition:\r\n\r\n    Tungstic Acid       78.43\r\n    Oxide of Copper      8.95\r\n    Lime                12.62\r\n                       ------\r\n                       100.00\r\n\r\n    This agrees pretty well with the results of the analysis,\r\n    although it is desirable that more specimens should be\r\n    examined, and if possible from other localities. I am informed\r\n    by Mr. Ashburner that he has noticed this mineral at more than\r\n    one mine in Lower California.\r\n\r\n    At all events, I would suggest for the mineral in question the\r\n    name of _Cuproscheelite_, as convenient for designating it, and\r\n    as expressing its chemical and mineralogical relations, whether\r\n    it be considered as a mineral substance having a distinct\r\n    and fixed composition, or only as a variety of Scheelite,\r\n    containing a large but uncertain amount of oxide of copper.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres called attention to the fact that a carcase of a Black fish\r\ncould be procured at the Potrero, at a small expense, and a subscription\r\nwas raised for its purchase.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited a branch of _Sequoia sempervirens_, taken\r\nfrom a small tree growing near San Rafael, of which the leaves are\r\nentirely white. The tree presents a very singular appearance, surrounded\r\nas it is by other redwoods of the usual color. The fact was elicited that\r\nsimilar blanched redwoods exist in other localities in the Coast Ranges;\r\nbut no explanation or theory was offered to account for this curious,\r\nabnormal blanching of the foliage of a single species—a similar condition\r\nof things not having been noticed, so far as known, in any other species\r\nthan the redwood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 20TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs.

Coll. of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. NEW LOCALITY OF FOSSILS IN THE GOLD-BEARING ROCKS OF\r\n    CALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\n    I have obtained specimens of _Ammonites_ from the cut in the\r\n    rocks on the line of the Central Pacific Railroad, about two\r\n    miles below Colfax, and in the heart of the main gold belt of\r\n    the State.\r\n\r\n    The rock is a compact argillite, somewhat altered and much\r\n    discolored by the peroxydation of iron. The strata are boldly\r\n    flexed and are interstratified with coarse grits and a thick\r\n    bed of conglomerate, so much altered that the pebbles are\r\n    homogeneously cemented.\r\n\r\n    The substance of the fossils has been removed by percolating\r\n    waters, but very perfect casts of them remain and show the\r\n    details of the external form, but do not permit the septæ to\r\n    be seen. It is thus not possible, perhaps, to determine the\r\n    specific characters; and considering, also, the absence of a\r\n    typical collection and works of reference, I do not attempt\r\n    a minute description, preferring to refer the specimens to a\r\n    palæontologist. It may, however, be observed that the fossils\r\n    are undoubtedly of the secondary period; and that they are\r\n    apparently specifically identical with those from the American\r\n    river, in the same vicinity, of which I sent photographs to Mr.\r\n    Meek, at the Smithsonian Institution, in 1863, and afterwards\r\n    noticed at one of the meetings of this Academy, in September,\r\n    1864. They are, also, apparently identical with the species\r\n    found in the Bear Valley, Mariposa, slates. If this species\r\n    has not been already named, I desire to connect with it the\r\n    name of Mr. Spear, in whose cabinet at Georgetown, the earliest\r\n    specimen was carefully preserved. I obtained one specimen at\r\n    the locality, and another was presented to me by Mr. Richard\r\n    Carroll, it having been saved by the quarry-men, under the\r\n    impression that it was a petrified rattlesnake. It is about six\r\n    inches in its longest diameter, being elliptical and evidently\r\n    distorted by lateral pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. TOOTH OF THE EXTINCT ELEPHANT, PLACER COUNTY.\r\n\r\n    I have received from Mr. Baker and Mr. Thompson, through the\r\n    hands of Mr. E. Tyler, all of Placer County, a single molar\r\n    tooth of _Elephas_ found in the auriferous gravel near Michigan\r\n    Bluffs, thus adding another locality to the list showing the\r\n    former general distribution of the ancient elephants over this\r\n    coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. SHARK TEETH AND OTHER MARINE REMAINS, TULARE COUNTY.\r\n\r\n    When at Ocoya or Posa Creek, in 1853, I collected a great\r\n    number of shark teeth from the tops of the hills, at the\r\n    base of the Sierra Nevada, on the east side of the Tulare\r\n    Lake. These were described and figured in my Report to the\r\n    U. S. Government. Having recently revisited that region,\r\n    I found other localities, and made another collection, a\r\n    part of which I now exhibit to the Academy. The following\r\n    genera and species are represented: _Oxyrhina plana_, _O.\r\n    tumula_, _Lamna clavata_, _Galeocerdo productus_, _Prionodon\r\n    antiquus_, _Hemipristis heteropleurus_, _Notidanus_, (Nov.\r\n    Sp.?) and _Zygobates_, a genus of the family of Skates, having\r\n    pavement-like teeth. Vertebratæ, apparently of the whale, are\r\n    abundant, and some fragments of the head. These remains are\r\n    now at least twelve hundred feet above the sea, and being in\r\n    unbroken horizontal strata, show a very great and general\r\n    uplift of the region in comparative late times. The strata were\r\n    referred to the Miocene in my Report, but I am now inclined to\r\n    regard them as Post-Pliocene. It is interesting to note that\r\n    these strata rest undisturbed upon granite, which is traversed\r\n    by gold-bearing veins, not over five miles from the point where\r\n    the fossils are found, and so low that the veins must have been\r\n    covered by the sea prior to the elevation of the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV. QUARRY OF GOLD-BEARING ROCK.\r\n\r\n    The Baker or Whiskey Hill Mine of Placer County, a few miles\r\n    from Lincoln, presents the novelty of profitable gold mining\r\n    from a _quarry_ in the slates without any well defined quartz\r\n    vein. A hill with a rounded outline is covered with rough\r\n    outcrops of rusty slate, over a breadth of two hundred feet\r\n    or more. A quarry at one end exposes the slate, with a great\r\n    variety of colors, from white to brown and red and black, the\r\n    whole of it being soft and ochraceous, and in places stained\r\n    green and blue with carbonate of copper. These variegated\r\n    slates are like those commonly known, among California copper\r\n    prospectors, as “calico rocks,” and the ground was first\r\n    located and prospected for copper.\r\n\r\n    It is evident that the formation consists of beds of iron\r\n    pyrites (mundic) with a small but variable portion of copper\r\n    pyrites, and that the rusty, upper portions are due to the\r\n    gradual decomposition of the sulphurets above the permanent\r\n    water-line, or where the atmosphere has had access. Below the\r\n    water-line we may not expect to find the rusty ochrey slates.\r\n    This is shown, also, at a shaft which has reached the water.\r\n    Blocks of mundic, taken out of that shaft, are interstratified\r\n    with talcose slate. At one point, in the bottom of the quarry,\r\n    a layer of green and blue carbonate of copper is found, and\r\n    this is evidently the result of a gradual concentration of the\r\n    copper from the decomposed ground above. The soft slate, as\r\n    quarried, is trammed to a five-stamp mill, with very coarse\r\n    grates, and nearly forty tons are run through it daily. The pay\r\n    is said to vary from two to twenty dollars, but the average is\r\n    reported to be from five to six dollars per ton.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following:\r\n\r\n    Since my communication to the Academy of date July 16th last,\r\n    on the Shells of Baulines Bay, additional specimens (4) of\r\n    _Haliotis rufescens_ have been found by Mr. Harford and Dr.\r\n    Kellogg; also many specimens of _Katherina tunicata_, and one\r\n    of _Mopalia Hindsii_; from between the umbos of very large\r\n    specimens of _Mytilus Californianus_, collected by the same\r\n    gentlemen, several specimens of _Barleia? subtenuis_ Carp.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the above marine forms, the following species\r\n    were found by the same parties in a gulch at Belvidere Ranch,\r\n    not far from Capt. Morgan’s house, south side of Baulines\r\n    Bay: _Helix Nickliniana_, _H. arrosa_, _H. infumata_, _H.\r\n    Columbiana_ (hirsute var.) and _H. Vancouverensis_. Also,\r\n    near a small stream on the same ranch, _Bythinella Binneyi_,\r\n    Tryon. The last named species had previously been found in this\r\n    neighborhood by Rev. J. Rowell.\r\n\r\nProf. Blake mentioned that a tooth of a mastodon had been found about\r\nthree miles from Antioch, near Monte Diablo, by Capt. Stevens.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns gave an account of the Helix, its anatomy, geographical\r\ndistribution, and use as an article of food and for medicinal purposes,\r\nin both ancient and modern times.\r\n\r\nProf. Blake stated that he had in his possession a portion of a human\r\nskull said to have been taken from a depth of 250 feet below the surface,\r\nnear Columbia, in Tuolumne County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, SEPTEMBER 3D, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present, and Mr. A. Wood as a visitor.\r\n\r\nMr. John Swett was elected a Resident Member.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: Two specimens of fishes from Dr. Kellogg and\r\nDr. Behr; specimen of a fungus, _Polyporus igniarius_, from Dr. Kellogg.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg called the attention of the Academy to the remarkable\r\nspecimen of fungus presented by him, _Polyporus igniarius_, which was\r\nfound growing upon the Bay tree, _Oreodaphne Californica_; and gave\r\na description of _Fungi_ in general; alluding particularly to the\r\ndestructive effect of many species, some producing the dry rot in ships,\r\nothers destroying buildings, producing the disintegration of mortar in\r\nmasonry, and seriously affecting the health, or destroying animal life.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg also remarked on the use of some species of Fungi for food,\r\nparticularly by the natives of Australia, who regard them with especial\r\nfavor for that purpose. The rapid growth and poisonous effect of certain\r\nspecies of Fungi were mentioned, also the use made of some species in the\r\narts.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Wood, who has recently returned from a botanical exploration of\r\nOregon, being present as a visitor, was invited to speak, and gave the\r\nfollowing narrative of the recent ascent of Mount Hood, by himself and a\r\nparty of gentlemen:\r\n\r\n    On the 20th of August last, in company with Dr. Atkinson,\r\n    of Portland, and the Rev. J. Deardorff, of Walla Walla, and\r\n    three others, I stood upon the summit of Mount Hood in Oregon.\r\n    From our last camp on the summit of the Cascade Range to this\r\n    point, the summit of Mount Hood is eleven miles of constant and\r\n    weary ascent, at angles about as follows: Five miles in the\r\n    first, 12 to 15°; two miles to eternal snow, 25 to 30°; one\r\n    and one-half miles to the gap in the rim of the crater, about\r\n    45°; the remaining ascent traversing the ancient crater, nearly\r\n    or quite 60°! The day was cloudless; a strong, warm wind from\r\n    the southeast softened the surface of the snow and favored our\r\n    ascent, although it gave us much anxiety lest it should loosen\r\n    some of the tremendous acclivities of snow and overhanging\r\n    drifts from above us.\r\n\r\n    Starting from camp at daylight, on horseback four miles, we\r\n    arrived at the top at a quarter past two P.M., in nine and a\r\n    half hours.\r\n\r\n    Our apparatus for measuring the heights consisted of two\r\n    barometers, (aneroid) a thermometer, a tin cup, and a spirit\r\n    lamp. Both barometers failed us, the index ceasing to turn\r\n    after something more than a complete revolution on the dial.\r\n    They were not made for such heights. But we made good use of\r\n    our thermometer.\r\n\r\n    The ascent was exceedingly difficult, and not without danger.\r\n    The long summer heat had undermined the snows, causing their\r\n    surface to conform more to the ruggedness of the mountains,\r\n    and the slides had opened chasms of invisible depths across\r\n    our path. We looked down into several of these chasms and saw\r\n    that the massive walls below consisted of solid, blue ice, and\r\n    terminated at length in the blackness of darkness. We could\r\n    hear the noise of running water, apparently in torrents. One\r\n    of these chasms was unavoidable—_and must be crossed_. Its\r\n    transverse length was nearly a mile, and its width from ten\r\n    to one hundred feet. By the aid of a rope, forty-five yards\r\n    in length, and five pike-poles, each eight feet, we crossed,\r\n    (of course at the narrowest place) and afterward by rope and\r\n    poles, tugging, panting, dizzy, we dragged ourselves up to the\r\n    terrific crest of this Mountain Monarch.\r\n\r\n    The summit area is of very limited dimensions—a crescent in\r\n    shape, half a mile in length, and _three_ to forty or fifty\r\n    feet in width. It is a fearful place, as it is the imminent\r\n    brow of a precipice on the north, sheer down not less than a\r\n    vertical mile of bare columnar rock!\r\n\r\n    This height is lifted so far above all other heights (except\r\n    the four distant snow-clad peaks to the north and Mount\r\n    Jefferson on the south) that the country beneath seemed\r\n    depressed to a uniform level, and the horizon retreated to the\r\n    distance of more than two hundred miles, including nearly all\r\n    Oregon and Washington Territory. The sublimity and grandeur\r\n    of that view I must leave to the imagination of the reader. A\r\n    cañon of enormous depth plunges down along the southeast flank,\r\n    and is filled in part by a glacier evidently in motion, and\r\n    having below a very abrupt termination. Terminal and lateral\r\n    _moraines_ mark its course, and a torrent of water issues from\r\n    beneath. While we delayed here, an avalanche of rocks, an\r\n    immense mass, started by the wind, thundered down the left wall\r\n    of this cañon several thousand feet, and its track was marked\r\n    by a trail of white smoke.\r\n\r\n    On the west side of the ancient crater, at the base of a vast\r\n    craggy pinnacle of rocks, (a portion of the ancient rim of the\r\n    crater) is still an open abyss, whence issue constantly volumes\r\n    of a strongly sulphurous smoke. That there is also heat there\r\n    is evident from the immense depression of the snow about this\r\n    place—depressed not less than a thousand feet below the snows\r\n    which fill to the _brim_ other portions of the ancient crater.\r\n\r\n    As I have already stated, we found our barometers useless\r\n    in these vast heights, and were reduced to the use of the\r\n    thermometer alone. By this we learned the boiling point of\r\n    water at four several stations, as follows: At the camp, the\r\n    summit of the Cascade Range, it stood in boiling water at 204°\r\n    Fah. At the upper verge of the forest, it indicated 195½°.\r\n    At the highest reach of all apparent vegetation, 192°; and\r\n    finally at the summit, where, after the most persevering and\r\n    determined efforts, (on account of the violence of the wind)\r\n    we at length, by means of a spirit lamp, changed a portion of\r\n    snow to a cup of boiling water, the mercury stood firm in the\r\n    cup at 180°! These several results being changed to _feet of\r\n    elevation_, according to the rule universally approved in such\r\n    cases, indicate heights as follows, viz: At the summit of the\r\n    Cascade Range, and foot of Mt. Hood proper, 4,400 feet; at the\r\n    limit of forest trees, about 9,000 feet; at the highest limit\r\n    of vegetation, 11,000 feet; at the summit of the mountain,\r\n    17,600 feet.\r\n\r\n    We earnestly hope that these results may be hereafter tested by\r\n    the barometer; and by triangulation. Until then, we must adopt\r\n    the estimate here made, as the height of that sublime peak,\r\n    and accord to Mount Hood the distinction of being the highest\r\n    land in the United States, if not the highest upon the North\r\n    American continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, SEPTEMBER 17TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. B. P. Avery, James Spiers, and B. R.

I supposed them to\r\n    be _P. brata Binn_, but they are nearly three times as large,\r\n    not lirate, etc. That species is catalogued by Carpenter as\r\n    among the collections from San Diego, in the Supp. Rep. etc.,\r\n    1863, pp. 612, 647, 673, but I do not find it in the State\r\n    collection. Those described are fresh and shining in the\r\n    mouth—dull, but not much worn, outside.\r\n\r\n    This is a very interesting shell, being one of the links\r\n    between the land and marine mollusca—the species of the genus\r\n    being chiefly tropical, occurring at Cape St. Lucas, Panama,\r\n    West Indies, Africa, and Isle of France, according to Binney,\r\n    who says that they inhabit crevices of rocks, especially those\r\n    exposed to the full force of the tide; but being pulmonate,\r\n    they can probably live long with but little moisture. On the\r\n    rocks the living shell would be mistaken for a _Lacuna_ or\r\n    _Littorina_, and the form of our species reminds one strongly\r\n    of _Succinea Oregonensis_.\r\n\r\nA communication was received from Dr. Canfield of Monterey, giving an\r\naccount of the discovery in Monterey Bay, of a fish, pronounced by\r\nthe naturalists of the Smithsonian Institution to be a new species of\r\n_Bdellostoma_, a genus not previously known to exist nearer than the\r\ncoast of Chili.\r\n\r\nMr. Falkenau made some remarks on the use and value of the spectroscope\r\nin chemical analysis and in other scientific investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, OCTOBER 1ST, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourteen members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. A. Winslow Boynton, and T. C. Leonard were elected Resident\r\nMembers.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Royal Fisk, Resident Member, was received and accepted.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: A specimen of black oxide of manganese from Red\r\nRock, by Mr. Stearns; fossils from near Nanaimo, by Dr. Comrie.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr made some remarks upon the _Lepidoptera_ and the four different\r\nstages of their development, noticing the fact that the length of time\r\nof the egg state in some species, for instance the Chinese silkworm,\r\nadmits of the transportation of the same to foreign countries, while in\r\nthe Californian silkworm, _Saturnia ceanothi_, the period of the egg\r\nstate is so brief as to render it impossible to transport the eggs either\r\nto New York or Europe. Dr. Behr also explained the difference between\r\nthe larva state in the _Lepidoptera_ and other classes of insects, and\r\nreferred to the importance of the larva condition in insects as a basis\r\nfor classification, and mentioned many interesting proofs of the tenacity\r\nof life during the _chrysalis_ or _pupa_ state; alluding to the different\r\nclasses of moths in which wingless females occur, a peculiarity that is\r\nunknown to the butterflies.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander stated that in his “Remarks on California Trees,” made at\r\nthe meeting of October 16th, 1865, and published in the current volume,\r\n(p. 225) he had referred a small pine growing on the plains between\r\nMendocino City and Noyo, to _Pinus murcata_; but he could now state\r\npositively that it is the true _Pinus contorta_ of Douglas. He stated\r\nalso, that No. 7, noticed on page 227 of that article, is _P. muricata_.\r\nFarther, on page 229, _Quercus Wislizeni_, Englm. is wrongfully referred\r\nto _Q. agrifolia_. _Q. Wislizeni_ is a well characterized species with\r\nbiennial fruit; the fruit of _Q. agrifolia_, on the other hand, is\r\nannual. These two oaks differ also materially in their distribution.\r\n_Q. Wislizeni_ is found chiefly in the lower Sierra, and in the small\r\nvalleys east of the redwoods in Mendocino County. _Q. agrifolia_ occurs\r\nalmost exclusively in the vicinity of San Francisco Bay, and on the banks\r\nof streams emptying into it. It extends also southward, approaching the\r\ncoast more nearly as we reach Monterey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, OCTOBER 15TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nEleven members present.\r\n\r\nMr. A. L. Bancroft was elected a Resident Member.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library:\r\n\r\nBodemann and Kerl’s Treatise on Assaying, translated by W. A. Goodyear,\r\npresented by the translator.\r\n\r\nProf. W. P. Blake read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nMineralogical Notices.—No. II.\r\n\r\nBY WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    _Kerargyrite._—Chloride of silver in remarkably fine specimens\r\n    occurs in the “Poorman lode,” Idaho, associated with Proustite\r\n    (light red silver ore), native silver and native gold. Sheets\r\n    of the chloride are taken out of the soft clay of the vein, and\r\n    are from one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch in thickness. It\r\n    is also found in irregular massive aggregations of crystals, in\r\n    cubes, without any modification, and over an eighth of an inch\r\n    square. The color of my specimens is brown, passing into violet\r\n    blue in some portions.\r\n\r\n    _Proustite._—The “ruby silver” which occurs with the chloride\r\n    in the Poorman lode, as above, is often in masses of several\r\n    ounces, or even pounds, in weight, and it is reported to be\r\n    occasionally seen in beautiful crystals, but none have yet come\r\n    under my observation.\r\n\r\n    _Copper Glance_, _Red Oxide of Copper_, _Native Copper_.—These\r\n    species are found together in the “Red Cap claim,” Klamath\r\n    County, California, in serpentine. The metallic copper is seen\r\n    in points throughout the massive sulphuret, and is sometimes\r\n    enveloped in red oxide. Both copper and oxide are most abundant\r\n    in the outer portions of the ore, as found, and they are\r\n    apparently formed by the gradual decomposition of the sulphuret.\r\n\r\n    _Danaite._—A cobaltic variety of mispickel is found associated\r\n    with iron and copper pyrites at Meadow Lake, Nevada County,\r\n    California. It is in distinct, well formed, brilliant crystals,\r\n    of a tin-white color, and about a quarter of an inch in\r\n    diameter. They are modified nearly as in fig. 289, Dana’s\r\n    Min. This mineral gives cobalt reactions before the blowpipe,\r\n    and appears to contain a large per centage of this metal. The\r\n    ore is said to contain _nickel_, also, and is being mined for\r\n    shipment.\r\n\r\n    _Cinnabar in Calcite._—Cinnabar of a beautiful vermilion color\r\n    is found in an unusual form in Idaho, being abundantly spread\r\n    through a gangue of massive, compact limestone or marble. It\r\n    is so compact and homogeneous that specimens may be cut and\r\n    polished like marble. There are no evidences in the ore that I\r\n    have received of the presence of other minerals, not even of\r\n    quartz.\r\n\r\n    COLLEGE OF CALIFORNIA, Nov. 17, 1866.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following:\r\n\r\n    It is my painful duty to inform the Academy of the decease of\r\n    Robert Kennicott. The meager information received furnishes no\r\n    particulars, further than that he died suddenly, in the month\r\n    of May last, at Nulato Bay, in Russian America.\r\n\r\n    The services rendered to science by Mr. Kennicott are worthy\r\n    of something more than a passing notice. In the month of\r\n    May, in the year 1859, we find him starting upon a prolonged\r\n    exploration of Russian America, under the auspices of the\r\n    Smithsonian Institute, assisted by the University of Michigan,\r\n    the Audubon Club of Chicago, and the Academy of Sciences of\r\n    the same city. This exploration, including also a portion of\r\n    the territory held by the Hudson’s Bay Company, extended from\r\n    May, 1859, to the date of his return in October, 1862. From the\r\n    Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institute we learn that “the\r\n    route traversed by Mr. Kennicott was from Lake Superior along\r\n    the Kamenistiquoy River and Rainy and Winnipeg Lakes, up the\r\n    Saskatchewan River to Cumberland House; thence nearly north\r\n    to Fort Churchill, on English River, up the latter to Methy\r\n    portage, at which point he first reached the head waters of the\r\n    streams flowing into the Arctic ocean; thence along the Clear\r\n    Water River and Athabasca Lake, down Peace River into Great\r\n    Slave Lake, and along the Mackenzie River to Fort Simpson. At\r\n    this place Mr. Kennicott spent a part of the first winter,\r\n    making excursions up the Liard River to Fort Liard in autumn,\r\n    and again on snowshoes in January. Before the close of the\r\n    same winter he went up the Mackenzie to Big Island, and thence\r\n    northwest to Fort Rae, near the site of old Fort Providence.\r\n    From this point he traveled on the ice across Great Slave Lake\r\n    to Fort Resolution, at the mouth of Peace River, where he spent\r\n    the summer of 1860. He next descended the Mackenzie to Peel’s\r\n    River, and thence proceeded westward across the Rocky Mountains\r\n    and down the Porcupine River to the Youkon, in the vicinity\r\n    of which he spent the winter of 1860-61 and the summer of the\r\n    latter year. The winter of 1861-2 was spent at Peel’s River\r\n    and LaPierre’s house in the Rocky Mountains, and in traveling\r\n    from this point to Fort Simpson and back to Fort Good Hope, on\r\n    the Mackenzie. He left the last mentioned place on the first\r\n    of June, 1862, and reached home in October. This enterprise\r\n    terminated favorably, the explorer having returned richly laden\r\n    with specimens, after making a series of observations on the\r\n    physical geography, ethnology, and the habits of animals of\r\n    the regions visited, furnishing materials of great interest to\r\n    science.”\r\n\r\n    Aside from the extensive collections in every department of\r\n    natural history, the geographical information acquired by Mr.\r\n    Kennicott was of the greatest importance.\r\n\r\n    In 1865, the Western Union Telegraph Company having determined\r\n    to extend their wires so as to connect the old world and the\r\n    new by an overland line passing through Russian America across\r\n    Behring’s Sea to Russia in Asia, and thence to the central\r\n    cities of Europe, Mr. Kennicott’s knowledge of the territory\r\n    through which the proposed line was to pass made his services\r\n    indispensable to the Company. He was sought out, and his\r\n    cooperation at once secured. He entered upon this new labor,\r\n    hoping not only to do whatever lay in his power to make this\r\n    enterprise a success, but hoping also still further to serve\r\n    the great cause that was so dear to him; and while thus engaged\r\n    in the enthusiastic performance of this self-imposed duty, in\r\n    the prime of life, he has passed away.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons made some remarks on the relations of our climate to that of\r\nthe Great Basin, and the Eastern States.\r\n\r\nHe also made some observations on _Zirphea crispata_, living in the bay\r\nnear Alameda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOVEMBER 5TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFourteen members present.\r\n\r\nRev. S. D. Simonds and Dr. J. Morrison were elected Resident Members, and\r\nDr. W. P. Gibbons, of Alameda, a Corresponding Member.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander presented a curiously fruited specimen of _Quercus\r\ndensiflora_, the acorns being only about one-third of the ordinary\r\ndiameter, although nearly the usual length, and having a peculiar\r\nconstriction near the apex. It was collected by Mr. Wertheman, near\r\nCoarse Gold Gulch, Fresno County.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns exhibited a specimen of an _Astrophyton_, caught in the\r\nOchotsk Sea, off Cape Lepatka, Kamschatka, by the crew of the fishing\r\nbrig Angenette.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Gibbons called the attention of the Academy to the near approach\r\nof the season during which we might look for the recurrence of the\r\n“meteoric shower,” which he witnessed in the year 1833.\r\n\r\nSome remarks were made by Messrs. Gibbons, Keyes, Kellogg and others\r\nin reference to the phenomena of meteors, and considerable discussion\r\nfollowed as to the various ideas and theories advanced in regard to them\r\nby different authors.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns exhibited several specimens of _Acmæa asmi_, Midd., collected\r\nby him at Baulines Bay; remarking that upon a recent trip to the\r\nlocality named, he found this species exceedingly numerous, attached\r\nto _Chlorostoma funebrale_, A. Ad.; that he had not seen in a single\r\ninstance this Acmæa upon the rocks. Mr. Stearns further submitted for\r\nthe inspection of the Academy, a specimen of _Haliotis Cracherodii_,\r\nwhich he had collected alive last month, on the rocks near the outlet\r\nof Lobitas Creek into the ocean. The Haliotis had been attacked by a\r\npholad, probably _Navea Newcombii_, and had defended itself by adding\r\ncoating upon coating of nacre, as the Navea progressed, until a large\r\nknob or protuberance had been created in the interior of the shell. From\r\na partial examination of the borer, a specimen of which he had dug out\r\nfrom another portion of the same Haliotis, he believed it to belong to\r\nthe species recently described by Mr. Tryon, viz: _Navea Newcombii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOVEMBER 19TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirteen members present.\r\n\r\nMr. J.

Jacobs.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Library: On the Corals and Polyps of Panama, with\r\ndescriptions of new species, by A. E. Verrill, 8vo. pamphlet.\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney presented the following communication from Wm. M. Gabb:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Subdivisions of the Cretaceous Formation in California.\r\n\r\nBY WM. M. GABB.\r\n\r\n    The recent appearance of a check list published by the\r\n    Smithsonian Institute, and entitled “Check List of the\r\n    Invertebrate Fossils of North America—Eocene and Oligocene—by\r\n    T. A. Conrad,” renders it necessary that I should state more\r\n    clearly than has been done heretofore, the relations between\r\n    the two members of the Californian Cretaceous rocks; and should\r\n    give all of the proofs that have yet presented themselves, in\r\n    support of my views.\r\n\r\n    In 1856, Mr. Conrad published a paper in Vol. 5, Pacific\r\n    Railroad Reports, pages 320, _et seq._, in which he described\r\n    fifteen shells from the “Eocene” rocks of the Cañada de las\r\n    Uvas, near the present site of Fort Tejon. Of these, eleven\r\n    were considered by that author as being new to science. The\r\n    other four were referred to previously described Eocene forms.\r\n\r\n    These specimens were procured by Mr. Wm. P. Blake, geologist of\r\n    the expedition. They were obtained from a single boulder, the\r\n    only one found by that gentleman.\r\n\r\n    In consideration of the scanty material, it is by no means\r\n    surprising that Mr. Conrad should have made the determination\r\n    that he did. The fossils of this locality, and, in fact, of\r\n    this member of our Californian rocks, have a marked Tertiary\r\n    aspect. This holds good, both as applied to the appearance\r\n    of the specimens and also to the grouping of the genera. Mr.\r\n    Conrad’s reference of these fossils to an Eocene age was\r\n    perfectly justified by the light that he then possessed. Any\r\n    other palæontologist, with the same specimens, would no doubt\r\n    have done as he did. But I propose to prove that, after having\r\n    studied this formation for five years, both in the field and in\r\n    the closet—both palæontologically and stratigraphically—after\r\n    having traced it upwards of four hundred miles, and after\r\n    having collected fossils from it at a dozen localities, I, on\r\n    the other hand, am perfectly justified in pronouncing it most\r\n    unequivocally Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n    It is, to use a mild term, rather surprising that Mr. Blake,\r\n    from whom Mr. Conrad obtained his material, should not have\r\n    collected more specimens. According to his report, Mr. Blake\r\n    reached the depôt camp at Tejon, on the third of September,\r\n    1853, and did not leave that vicinity until October 10th.\r\n    During that time he traversed the distance between Tejon and\r\n    the Cañada de las Uvas, four times. I am familiar with every\r\n    foot of the ground on which he camped or on which he travelled;\r\n    and I speak from personal observation, when I say that in\r\n    going from one point to the other he could not avoid passing\r\n    thousands of boulders and pebbles, full of fossils, similar to\r\n    the single one sent to Mr. Conrad. In riding from the Ranch\r\n    house of Tejon to Fort Tejon, on Mr. Blake’s trail, Professor\r\n    Brewer and myself collected upward of _forty_ species of\r\n    mollusca in less than one hour, and without diverging ten feet\r\n    from our route!\r\n\r\n    The Californian Cretaceous formation is easily separable\r\n    into two main divisions. The older of these, designated in\r\n    the Report as “Division A,” is the equivalent of the upper\r\n    portions, Nos. 4 and 5, of Meek and Hayden’s section in\r\n    Nebraska, and the later beds of New Jersey and the Gulf States.\r\n    It is possible that this group may be separated hereafter\r\n    into two sub-groups; but that has no bearing on the question\r\n    at issue. The upper or more modern member, found overlying\r\n    the lower one conformably in various places, as about Monte\r\n    Diablo and at Martinez, has no apparent equivalent in America.\r\n    It is probably, however, the American representative of the\r\n    Maestricht beds, the ‘Danien’ of French authors. It is _not_ a\r\n    transition from Cretaceous to Tertiary, but is the most modern\r\n    member of the former formation.\r\n\r\n    It has many points in common with the Maestricht beds of\r\n    Europe. It contains but a single species, so far as known,\r\n    of the complex-chambered group of Cephalopods. A solitary\r\n    ammonite, represented by half a dozen specimens, has been found\r\n    by myself, in place, even to the very top of the formation.\r\n\r\n    Of 280 species of fossils recognized and named in the\r\n    Californian Cretaceous rocks, 107 are found in this upper\r\n    member. Of these, 84 are peculiar, and 23 are found in common\r\n    between undoubted members of this group and undoubted members\r\n    of the older group. Besides this, I was fortunate enough\r\n    to discover a locality near Clear Lake, this fall, where,\r\n    within a space of two feet, I found an admixture of upper and\r\n    lower forms, proving the existence of a transitionary bed or\r\n    perhaps group of beds. The following table will exhibit at\r\n    a glance the grouping of species at each of the principal\r\n    localities; showing at the same time which species are found\r\n    in the intermediate deposit, and which exist in common in both\r\n    the upper and lower divisions. The various localities are\r\n    designated by letters, as follows: M, Martinez; C, Clayton to\r\n    Marsh’s; T, vicinity of Fort Tejon; G, a locality 10 miles west\r\n    of Griswold’s near New Idria; I, New Idria; D, San Diego; LL,\r\n    Lower Lake Village, 1 mile S.E. of the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n    TABLE OF SUBDIVISIONS OF CRETACEOUS FORMATION.\r\n\r\n    ===========================+==============+=======+===================\r\n                               |              | Inter-|\r\n                               |    Upper     |mediate| Lower Division,\r\n                               |  Division.   | Beds. | and Remarks.\r\n    ---------------------------+--------------+-------+-------------------\r\n    Callianassa Stimpsonii     |C.

The same grouping of species extends to the\r\n    extreme upper limits of the fossiliferous rocks, which are\r\n    everywhere overlain by an immense deposit of non-fossiliferous\r\n    sandstones. Another objection, which has already been raised,\r\n    that the acknowledged Cretaceous fossils have become mixed\r\n    with more modern species by the breaking up and re-cementing\r\n    of an older formation, I shall not even attempt to refute. Had\r\n    such been the case, I would ere this, in common honesty, have\r\n    acknowledged it.\r\n\r\n    In support of the two conclusions arrived at above, we have the\r\n    following synopsis of the table:\r\n\r\n    Of the 107 species of fossils found in Division B, 44 are found\r\n    at Clayton, 67 at Tejon, 54 at Martinez, 22 at San Diego, 18\r\n    near Griswold’s, and 7 near New Idria. It is not intended\r\n    to be understood that these are all of the species found at\r\n    these localities; but that, up to the present time, these are\r\n    all that have been identified or described. Future work will\r\n    undoubtedly change the above figures.\r\n\r\n    Of the species found at the above localities, 50 are peculiar\r\n    to one or another locality; 29 are found at two localities\r\n    only, 14 at three localities, and 14 at four localities or more.\r\n\r\n    Taking the three typical localities, Martinez, Clayton and\r\n    Tejon, 21 species are common to Martinez and Clayton, 30 to\r\n    Martinez and Tejon, 25 to Clayton and Tejon, and 20 are found\r\n    at all three localities.\r\n\r\n    Now, having given what I believe ought to be considered\r\n    proof conclusive to any candid mind in support of my first\r\n    proposition, I shall endeavor to establish the second.\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that 16 species, found in the upper member,\r\n    also extend into the older group, Division A. In addition to\r\n    this, at the locality near Lower Lake Village, Lake County,\r\n    besides several species encountered for the first time, I\r\n    found 15 species in the same bed, within a superficial area\r\n    of two feet. Of these, 3 were previously known to be common\r\n    to the upper and lower division. Besides these 3, 7 of them\r\n    were common to this locality, and localities of Division B,\r\n    and the remaining 5 were, before this discovery, considered\r\n    peculiar to the lower member. One of these 5 is found in the\r\n    Mississippi Valley, in the “Ripley Group,” and another belongs\r\n    to a peculiarly Cretaceous genus.\r\n\r\n    As to the species found at the several typical localities,\r\n    independent of each other, and which would serve to show\r\n    their individual relations to the older formation without\r\n    corroborative evidence, Clayton has 10 species in common with\r\n    Division A, Tejon has 7, and Martinez 11. With the Lower Lake\r\n    bed, Clayton has 5 species in common, Tejon 5, and Martinez 6.\r\n\r\n    In glancing over Mr. Conrad’s “check list,” I find that out\r\n    of the 107 species found in his “Older Eocene of California,”\r\n    he has only included 74 in his enumeration. He has omitted\r\n    Callianassa Stimpsonii, Ammonites n. s., Nautilus Texanus,\r\n    Cylichna costata, Mactra Ashburnerii, Cucullæa Mathewsonii,\r\n    Nucula truncata, and Leda protexta; eight species, which\r\n    I mentioned in the Journal of Conchology, (Vol. 2, p. 88)\r\n    as being found in common in the two members of the Cal.\r\n    cretaceous, stating distinctly the localities in which they had\r\n    been found. At the same time he includes five other species,\r\n    from the same list, in his Eocene catalogue. Whether this\r\n    be carelessness, or an unfair avoidance of a difficulty, I\r\n    leave to others to decide. It is far easier to ignore such a\r\n    difficulty than it is to explain it away.\r\n\r\n    In regard to the distribution of the genera and species in\r\n    this and the associated rocks. All of the species are peculiar\r\n    to this group, or to this and _underlying_ rocks; _not one_\r\n    has been found associated either with living forms, or with\r\n    species known to occur in the recognized Tertiaries of\r\n    California. Five of the genera are peculiar to the Secondary.\r\n    An Ammonite ranges entirely through the group to the top of\r\n    the highest fossiliferous strata. The genera Perissolax,\r\n    Gyrodes, Margaritella, and the sub-genus Anchura, of the genus\r\n    Aporrhais, are all recognized as strictly characteristic of\r\n    the Cretaceous; so much so, that the presence of a single\r\n    undoubted representative of either of these genera would be\r\n    strong presumptive evidence of the Cretaceous age of any rocks\r\n    in which it might be found. On the other hand, the presence of\r\n    such genera as those in the list given below, would point to a\r\n    very modern era in the Cretaceous, to say the least.\r\n\r\n    It must be borne in mind that we have much to learn yet in\r\n    palæontology, especially in the matter of the vertical range\r\n    of genera. Every year we find genera, nay, whole families,\r\n    extending themselves beyond what had been fixed by previous\r\n    authors as their limits. A few years ago, the presence of\r\n    mammalian remains was considered characteristic of the\r\n    Tertiaries. Now we know of Marsupials in the Trias, and who\r\n    dare say that we cannot find mammals in palæozoic rocks? I\r\n    therefore maintain, that though we have here such genera as\r\n    Aturia, Typhis, Cordiera, Pseudoliva, Nassa, Mitra, Ficus,\r\n    Morio, Cerithiopsis, Cypræa and Galerus, still, the only\r\n    inference that can be drawn is, that the group is on or near\r\n    the verge of the formation, a sort of prophetic member,\r\n    presaging by some of its genera the formations to come, but\r\n    indissolubly bound by specific ties with the eras preceding.\r\n\r\n    [29] This species was referred by inadvertence to Div. B.\r\n    instead of A. This is the first time it has been found beyond\r\n    the limits of the lower member.\r\n\r\nProf. Blake stated that he considered the collections made by him, in and\r\nnear the Cañada de las Uvas, as not meager. There was a sufficient number\r\nof species to make a quarto plate of figures.\r\n\r\nProf. Blake read the following notice:\r\n\r\n\r\nFossil Fish in the Great Basin, Nevada.\r\n\r\nBY WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    Fossilized fish are found in a light-colored clay shale, in\r\n    the mountains a few miles north of Silver Peak, a mining\r\n    district in the Red Mountain or Salt Basin region, about\r\n    one hundred and fifty miles south of Austin. The vertebral\r\n    columns, ribs and fins are very distinctly shown, and the\r\n    specimens are exceedingly interesting. They remind me of the\r\n    specimens from the famous locality of Mount Bolca, in Europe.\r\n    The specimen that I have here, does not appear to belong to an\r\n    ancient period, but I will not venture to refer it without\r\n    an opportunity of making comparisons, or submitting it to a\r\n    competent ichthyologist, which I propose to do.\r\n\r\n    COLLEGE OF CALIFORNIA, Nov. 19. 1866.\r\n\r\nProf. Blake also directed the attention of the Academy to specimens of\r\nfossil vertebræ, collected by him in Tulare County. These specimens are\r\nabout twenty in number, and are from two to six inches in length, and\r\ntwo to three inches in diameter. He believed them to belong to large\r\nmarine saurians, like crocodiles, but wished to make further study and\r\ncomparison previous to making a more formal communication to the Academy.\r\nIf correct in his opinion, it was, he believed, the first instance of the\r\ndiscovery of saurian remains on the Pacific Coast of the United States,\r\nand the discovery will be rendered still more interesting by the fact\r\nthat the remains occur in strata reputed to be miocene, associated with\r\nsharks’ teeth and numerous marine remains, at least fifteen hundred feet\r\nabove the present ocean level.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney remarked that the remains of the crocodile, and\r\nichthyosaurus had been discovered on this coast by the Geological Survey,\r\nand the fact published a year ago.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney read the following communication:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of the occurrence of the Silurian Series in Nevada.\r\n\r\nBY J. D. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n    At a meeting of the Academy in May last, I gave some account\r\n    of the geology of the State of Nevada, with particular\r\n    reference to the age of the stratified deposits occurring\r\n    there, as determined from the collections of fossils brought\r\n    from that region to the office of the Geological Survey, by\r\n    J. E. Clayton, and various members of our corps. In that\r\n    communication I spoke of the probable future discovery of rocks\r\n    older than the Carboniferous or Devonian, in the mountain\r\n    ranges near Austin. This expectation has been realized, and\r\n    we are now in possession of a very interesting collection of\r\n    fossils, obtained by Mr. A. Blatchley, in the vicinity of the\r\n    Hot Creek Mining District about one hundred miles southeast of\r\n    Austin. This collection enables us to state positively that\r\n    both Upper and Lower Silurian rocks occur in that district, and\r\n    that they are well filled with fossils; not less so indeed,\r\n    to judge from the specimens received, than the strata of the\r\n    same age in New York, Ohio, Iowa, and Wisconsin, which they\r\n    resemble in a most marked degree, both lithologically and\r\n    palæontologically.\r\n\r\n    The fossils from the Hot Creek District are mostly weathered\r\n    out on the surfaces of thin slabs of bluish-gray argillaceous\r\n    limestones, and are crowded together in the same profusion with\r\n    which they have often been noticed by myself and others as\r\n    occurring in the Lower Silurian shales and limestones of the\r\n    Wisconsin Lead Region, around Big Bay des Noquets, and in many\r\n    other localities in the country bordering on the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n    Both the upper and lower divisions of the Silurian appear to be\r\n    represented by the fossils of the Hot Creek District; but the\r\n    lower Silurian seems to be much the most prolific in fossils,\r\n    as is the case in Wisconsin and Iowa. The particular period\r\n    to which these lower Silurian forms may be referred is the\r\n    Trenton, including the Chazy, Birdseye, Black River and Trenton\r\n    limestones of the New York Geologists, and the Buff and Blue\r\n    limestones of the Western surveys. Nearly all the prevailing\r\n    types of the Eastern rocks of this age, are represented in\r\n    the Hot Creek collection, namely: Brachiopods, Gasteropods,\r\n    Cephalopods, Crinoids, Trilobites, and Corals; and there are\r\n    among them several of the most widely-distributed and most\r\n    characteristic species of the Lower Silurian. The following\r\n    have been identified: _Maclurea magna_, a characteristic Chazy\r\n    species, and _Pleurotoma lenticularis_, _Orthis testudinaria_\r\n    and _Chætetes lycoperdon_, all of which are abundant in the\r\n    Trenton limestone of New York, and the rocks of the same age\r\n    farther West. Among the fragments of Trilobites, two or three\r\n    different genera may be recognized, especially _Asaphus_, which\r\n    is represented by a species apparently new. There are also\r\n    fragments of crinoids or cystids closely resembling the species\r\n    figured by Hall, in the Palæontology of New York, Vol. I, as\r\n    _Echino-encrinites anatiformis_.\r\n\r\n    The rocks containing the above mentioned fossils crop out\r\n    in the sides of a deep cañon; and overlying them, at a\r\n    perpendicular distance of about a thousand feet, is a series\r\n    of beds containing numerous fragments of corals and crinoids,\r\n    silicified and weathered out from the surface of a bluish-gray\r\n    limestone, which I refer without much doubt to the age of the\r\n    Niagara limestone of New York. Among the corals, _Heliolites\r\n    spinipora_ and _Syringopora_ are recognizable; and among\r\n    the crinoidal fragments are stems of what appears to be\r\n    _Caryocrinus ornatus_.\r\n\r\n    With the exception of the Potsdam sandstone fossils,\r\n    described by Meek and Hayden as occurring at the base of the\r\n    fossiliferous series, in the Black Hills, no recognizable\r\n    Silurian forms have been observed by geologists, in the Rocky\r\n    Mountains, or anywhere to the west of them, unless possibly in\r\n    New Mexico. The Silurian Series, with the possible exception\r\n    of the Potsdam sandstone, seems to be entirely wanting in\r\n    the Rocky Mountains proper, the Black Hills being a sort of\r\n    outlier of the main ranges, and lying as far east as the one\r\n    hundred and third to the one hundred and fifth meridian. Dr.\r\n    Hayden says, in his paper, on the Geology and Natural History\r\n    of the Upper Missouri, published in 1862, that “hitherto no\r\n    indications of the existence of any other member (than the\r\n    Potsdam sandstone) of the Silurian period has been discovered\r\n    along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains within the\r\n    boundary of the United States.” He considers it probable that\r\n    the Potsdam sandstone is represented in the Rocky Mountains,\r\n    although no fossils of that member of the series has been as\r\n    yet discovered anywhere to the west of the Black Hills.\r\n\r\n    On the Mexican Boundary Survey, a few fragments of fossils were\r\n    found in the superficial detritus, near El Paso, (Longitude,\r\n    one hundred and six degrees) which indicated the existence of\r\n    Silurian rocks in that vicinity; but none appear to have been\r\n    found in place. Professor Hall remarks that “the specimens\r\n    referable to strata of this age (Devonian and Silurian)\r\n    are few, and they are in such condition as to give little\r\n    satisfactory information regarding the rocks in place.” The\r\n    specimens obtained are figured in the Mexican Boundary Report,\r\n    but not described, nor is their locality accurately stated.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Newberry, in his Report in the Geology of the Colorado\r\n    River region, refers the lower portion of the strata exposed\r\n    in the grand cañons of that river to the Devonian and Silurian\r\n    Series; but as no recognizable fossils were discovered by the\r\n    Ives’ Expedition from any rocks lower than the Carboniferous,\r\n    this reference can only be taken as expressing a conviction\r\n    based on lithological characters and stratigraphical\r\n    considerations.\r\n\r\n    In view of the above cited facts, it will be seen at once how\r\n    interesting this discovery is of undoubted Silurian rocks\r\n    west of the Rocky Mountains; and the more so, since we have\r\n    in this remote region a recurrence of conditions and forms\r\n    of animal life so closely allied to those with which we are\r\n    familiar in the States east of the Mississippi. It is a very\r\n    remarkable fact that these rocks have not been discovered in\r\n    the Rocky Mountains; and should farther explorations fail\r\n    to reveal their presence, it will throw a new light on the\r\n    history of the physical development of the central and western\r\n    portions of this continent. Taking into view what has now\r\n    been communicated, and what was stated in my previous paper\r\n    in regard to the existence of the older stratified rocks in\r\n    the Silver Peak District, it will appear that Dr. Newberry’s\r\n    generalizations were, in all probability, correct, and that\r\n    we may expect to find in southern and southwestern Nevada the\r\n    outcropping fossiliferous edges of the strata underlying the\r\n    Carboniferous of the great Arizona or Colorado plateau, and\r\n    that they will be proved to occupy an extensive area, and to\r\n    yield a profusion of organic remains.\r\n\r\n    Among the specimens collected by Mr. Blatchley, as also by Mr.\r\n    Clayton, Mr. Melville Attwood, and Dr. C. L. Anderson, and now\r\n    at our office, there is a considerable number which demonstrate\r\n    the existence of an extensive fresh-water Tertiary deposit in\r\n    Nevada. This formation, which belongs to a very late Tertiary\r\n    epoch, evidently occupies a considerable area, as our specimens\r\n    come from localities hundreds of miles distant from each\r\n    other. The existence of any marine formation more recent than\r\n    the Jurassic, in Nevada, has not yet been proved; but, as Mr.\r\n    Gabb obtained evidence, in 1864, of the occurrence of rocks of\r\n    Cretaceous age on Crooked River, in Oregon, east of the Cascade\r\n    Range, it is possible that this member of the series may yet be\r\n    discovered in Nevada.\r\n\r\n    All the fossils referred to in this and my previous\r\n    communication on the geology of Nevada, will receive, in due\r\n    time, thorough investigation at the hands of Messrs. Meek and\r\n    Gabb, or other competent palæontologists; and we expect that\r\n    our collections from that State will be largely increased\r\n    during the present year.\r\n\r\nThe death of the eminent naturalist, Dr. A. A. Gould, of Boston, was\r\nannounced by Dr. Gibbons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 3D, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteen members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library:\r\n\r\nSechster Bericht des Offenbacher Vereins für Naturkunde, 8vo., 1865.\r\nJahrbuch der k. k. geologischen Reichsanstalt, xvi Band, No. 1.,\r\n8vo., Wien, 1866.

Mr. Rémond has obtained a suite of plants from the coal-bearing\r\nformation of Northern Chile, sufficient in number to fix its age as\r\nTriassic. Two species, one a _Pecopteris_, the other a _Pterophyllum_,\r\nare apparently identical with those found with the coal near Los Bronces,\r\nin Sonora, Mexico, by Mr. Rémond. Above the coal-bearing conglomerates\r\nand sandstones, there are stratified porphyries, and above these,\r\nfossiliferous limestones of Liassic age. The fossils in this last\r\nmentioned formation are, in general, similar to those found by Domeyko\r\nand Darwin, at Las Juntas and Tres Cruces; but Mr. Rémond obtained\r\nseveral new species. He also collected a large number of species in the\r\nTertiaries of Coquimbo and Caldera. Farther, he obtained fossils in\r\nsufficient numbers from the rocks in which are the famous silver mines of\r\nChañarcillo and Tres Puntas, to fix their age as belonging to the Lower\r\nCretaceous.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney commented on the importance of these investigations,\r\nespecially that concerning the age of the Chile coal. It is very\r\ninteresting to know that the same formation carries coal in Chile which\r\nhas been found to bear that indispensable material in Northern Mexico.\r\nThe vast extent over which Triassic rocks occur in Arizona, New Mexico,\r\nand Nevada, gives a peculiar interest to every discovery of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 17TH, 1866.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nDr. F.

He remarked that\r\nit might be mistaken for _Sanicula_, (Sanicle) or possibly for _Conium\r\nmaculatum_ (Poison Hemlock).\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg also presented specimens of a beautiful Alpine willow-herb\r\ncollected by Mr. Blanchard, of Brooklyn, Alameda County; it was found\r\nin the mountains west of Owen’s Lake, near the Kearsarge mines, at\r\nan altitude of 8,000 feet. He considered it a variety of _Epilobium\r\nobcordatum_, Gray. This plant is described in the Proc. Am. Acad. of Arts\r\nand Sciences for May, 1865.\r\n\r\nDr. James Blake read the following communication:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Nourishment of the Fœtus in the Embiotocoid Fishes.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n    I am not aware that the process by which the embryo of the\r\n    Embiotocoid fishes receive the nourishment necessary for its\r\n    growth, has ever been pointed out. It certainly differs from\r\n    the three most common forms in which the embryo of other\r\n    animals is nourished, as there is nothing like a placenta by\r\n    which they can receive nourishment from the mother; there is\r\n    no supply of nutriment surrounding the embryo, as in the case\r\n    of most oviparous animals, nor is the embryo brought into\r\n    direct contact with the water, so as to derive nourishment\r\n    by absorption from the surrounding medium, as is the case in\r\n    oviparous fishes generally and in most of the lower forms of\r\n    animal life. The young fish is contained in a uterus which,\r\n    in the undeveloped state, resembles very much the ovaries of\r\n    the common oviparous fishes, except that its walls are thicker,\r\n    and that the number of ova it contains is very much smaller.\r\n    In the interior of the uterus, projecting from its sides, are\r\n    a number of processes analogous to those to which the ova are\r\n    usually attached. These processes vary in number in different\r\n    examples, but they are so arranged that each fœtal fish is in\r\n    contact on every side with a surface of one of these processes.\r\n    They consist apparently of a membrane composed of a cellular\r\n    tissue, and scattered over their surface are a number of small\r\n    mammillary elevations with an orifice in the center, and which\r\n    are probably the organs by which the peculiar secretion of the\r\n    uterus, to be hereafter noticed, is poured out. In an example\r\n    I examined, in which impregnation had apparently just taken\r\n    place, numerous ova were found adhering to these processes,\r\n    although not at all in such numbers as in the ordinary fishes.\r\n    I counted thirty-eight in about the space of an inch; of these,\r\n    however, but few can be developed, as the number of fœtuses\r\n    seldom exceeds forty, and sometimes is only eight. In the whole\r\n    of the uterus there probably were from one hundred to one\r\n    hundred and fifty ova. Of the earlier stages of development,\r\n    however, it is not my object to treat in the present memoir,\r\n    as I did not commence my investigations sufficiently early\r\n    to be able fully to make it out. As soon, however, as the\r\n    embryo has advanced sufficiently for the fins to be formed,\r\n    these appendages are found to be terminated by a number of\r\n    digitations, which project from the free edges of the fin, and\r\n    are usually found situated, one between each ray or spine. They\r\n    are composed almost entirely of fine capillary blood-vessels,\r\n    united apparently by a very delicate and structureless\r\n    membrane. They are so delicate that unless great care is taken\r\n    in removing the specimen from the uterus, they are destroyed;\r\n    nor have I ever been able to discover them in specimens that\r\n    have been preserved in alcohol. These processes seem continuous\r\n    with the membrane extended between the rays of the fins, but\r\n    are much more delicate; they project from the free edge of the\r\n    fin, sometimes as much as the eighth of an inch, and are, in\r\n    the fully developed embryo, the fifteenth of an inch broad.\r\n    On the free margin of each digitation, a larger capillary can\r\n    be observed, which appears to be continuous all around; it is\r\n    about the .003 in. in diameter, the intermediate space being\r\n    filled with a net-work of smaller capillaries. This system\r\n    of digitations projects from the entire edge of the dorsal,\r\n    ventral and caudal fins, but not from the pectorals. They in\r\n    fact form a fringe round the entire body, with the exception of\r\n    the head and that part of the abdomen in front of the anus.\r\n\r\n    Such is the structure of the organ that evidently has some\r\n    connection with the nourishment of the fœtus, resembling\r\n    as it does so closely the early formation of the vascular\r\n    villi and the placental tufts that proceed from the chorion\r\n    of the mammiferous embryo, and through which it derives its\r\n    nourishment before the placenta is fully formed.\r\n\r\n    The question now presents itself as to how nourishment is\r\n    conveyed from the parent to the fœtus through these tufts? As\r\n    before stated, the lining membrane of the uterus sends off\r\n    processes which surround each fœtus, without however forming\r\n    sheet sacks; but although these processes are very freely\r\n    supplied with blood-vessels, yet the finest injection failed\r\n    to show any more vascular spots where the fœtal digitations\r\n    might have been brought into more immediate contact with the\r\n    blood of the parent. I however was fortunate enough to obtain\r\n    a fish, in the uterus of which I discovered a considerable\r\n    quantity of fluid, and on collecting it, and submitting\r\n    it to chemical tests, I found that this fluid contained a\r\n    considerable quantity of an animal substance, resembling, to\r\n    a certain extent, some of the compounds that are formed from\r\n    albumen during the process of digestion. The fluid was of\r\n    yellowish color, translucent, deposited on standing some small\r\n    globules which under the microscope strongly refracted the\r\n    light, were not altered by acetic acid, but dissolved in ether;\r\n    probably fat globules; when heated, there was no coagulation,\r\n    although the fluid was not quite so clear; solution of Hg Cl₂\r\n    caused no precipitate; tannin in solution caused a yellowish\r\n    precipitate. In adding ether to a portion of the fluid, there\r\n    was a free disengagement of gas, a white flocculent precipitate\r\n    was formed, and on allowing the vessel to stand, the fluid\r\n    separated itself into three portions: the upper portion\r\n    consisting of pure ether apparently, then a layer containing\r\n    white flocculi, which occupied about the fourth part of the\r\n    fluid, and below this the remains of the original fluid, but\r\n    little altered in appearance. There can, I think, be little\r\n    doubt but that it is through the medium of this fluid that the\r\n    fœtus obtains its nourishment. The considerable portion of\r\n    animal matter it contains, and that too in a state particularly\r\n    fitted for absorption and for conversion into tissue, fits it\r\n    for furnishing the fœtus with the elements necessary for its\r\n    growth by absorption through the large surface of capillary\r\n    vessels which are found in the vascular digitations that\r\n    surround the fœtus, and which are constantly bathed in the\r\n    fluid. The difficulty that up to the present time has attended\r\n    every attempt to trace the connection between the parent and\r\n    fœtus in these embiotocoid fishes, is owing, in the first\r\n    place, to the extreme delicacy of the vascular digitations of\r\n    the fœtus, which prevents their being observed in preserved\r\n    specimens, and also to the fact that in almost every case\r\n    the fluid secreted by the uterus is entirely expelled by the\r\n    violent struggles of the fish when removed from the water,\r\n    so that it was almost by a rare accident that I succeeded in\r\n    obtaining any. I hope, however, during the coming season, to be\r\n    able more fully to carry out these researches.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FIG. 30.

There are twenty synonyms\r\n    for these species, which have created some confusion as to\r\n    their real name and number. The correct names of all, with\r\n    the popular characteristics of the most striking, and their\r\n    distribution, are given herewith. The names marked thus * are\r\n    those of trees having persistent cones, which they retain from\r\n    ten to twenty years in some instances. Those marked thus †\r\n    retain their cones but two years. Those marked thus ‡ retain\r\n    them but one year:\r\n\r\n    _Pinus insignis._*—Well known as the ornamental Monterey pine,\r\n    which is much cultivated in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    _P. muricata._*—Not remarkable.\r\n\r\n    _P. contorta._*—Small and bushy, but valuable as shelter\r\n    against wind. Grows abundantly near Fort Bragg, in the\r\n    Mendocino country, where it makes the stoutest wind-proof hedge\r\n    known. Ought to be tried in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n    _P. tuberculata._*—Always small, seldom higher than 15 to 30\r\n    feet.\r\n\r\n    _P. ponderosa._‡—The well known yellow pine. Attains a height\r\n    of 225 feet and more, and a circumference of 23 or 24 feet.\r\n\r\n    _P. Lambertiana._*—The equally well known, larger and handsome\r\n    “sugar pine,” or “long-cone pine” of Frémont. Usually grows at\r\n    great altitudes; exceedingly valuable for timber, and affords\r\n    the principal supplies.\r\n\r\n    _P. Coulteri._†—Found in the lower eastern slope of the Coast\r\n    Range. Not very large; sometimes attains a height of 75 feet;\r\n    knotty, but ornamental. It is remarkable for having the largest\r\n    cone of all the pines, and specimens of its cone, when first\r\n    known, brought five guineas in England.\r\n\r\n    _P. Sabiniana._†—This is the nut pine of the foothills,\r\n    sometimes called the “scrub pine,” or “silver pine.” The Digger\r\n    Indians gather the nuts from its cone as a favorite article of\r\n    food. It is found on the foothills of both Coast Ranges and\r\n    Sierra Nevada.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bolander mentioned several species in the group of coast\r\n    pines which he had not seen, viz: _P. Llaveana_, east of San\r\n    Diego; _P. deflexa_, on the summit of the California Mountains;\r\n    _P.

D. WHITNEY.\r\n\r\n    The microscopic discoveries of the last few years have\r\n    immensely extended the range and importance of the minute,\r\n    and, to the naked eye, invisible organisms, which, under the\r\n    general designation of “Infusoria,” are recognized as a part of\r\n    the kingdom of nature. It is especially to Ehrenberg that we\r\n    are indebted for a demonstration of the geological importance\r\n    of the Diatoms, those microscopic organisms which so long\r\n    puzzled naturalists to decide whether they were animal or\r\n    vegetable in their nature, but which are now, by the majority\r\n    of zoölogists, referred to as plants. In Ehrenberg’s great\r\n    work, the “Mikrogeologie,” or geology in little, this eminent\r\n    naturalist has given the results of the examination, by\r\n    himself, of specimens of infusorial rocks, soils, ashes, dust,\r\n    and other accumulations or masses of matter from every quarter\r\n    of the globe: these investigations show most conclusively\r\n    that deposits of vast extent—of such magnitude, indeed, as to\r\n    form no inconsiderable portion of the earth’s crust—are the\r\n    result of organic agencies, and that what seems to the eye an\r\n    unorganized mass, may in reality be made up of the delicately\r\n    wrought and almost infinitely minute remains of plant or animal\r\n    life.\r\n\r\n    That animals, or plants, so minute that a hundred millions of\r\n    distinct individuals will scarcely weigh a single grain, should\r\n    form accumulations hundreds of feet in thickness and extending\r\n    over thousands of square miles, seems a hardly credible\r\n    statement; but a fact still more difficult to believe and\r\n    comprehend is one which is thoroughly established by abundant\r\n    evidence, namely: that immense deposits of volcanic materials,\r\n    or, at least, of materials closely connected in their origin\r\n    and nature with volcanic action, and spread over vast tracts of\r\n    country in different parts of the world, are also, to a large\r\n    extent, made up of these microscopic organisms, the existence\r\n    of which seems dependent on the presence of water, and so\r\n    utterly at variance with a condition of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\n    Throughout this volcanic region of California, Oregon, Nevada,\r\n    and probably as far north as the igneous masses extend, which\r\n    are well known to cover a vast area on the western side of our\r\n    continent, there are found deposits, which are usually called\r\n    “fire-clay,” “kaolin,” “pipe-clay,” or simply “clay;”[30] these\r\n    masses are, however, not at all of the nature of kaolin, nor\r\n    are they proper clay, although they may, in places, pass into\r\n    clay or shale.\r\n\r\n    The material of which this deposit is made up is exceedingly\r\n    fine-grained, seemingly an impalpable powder, usually perfectly\r\n    white and more or less distinctly stratified. It is extremely\r\n    light, and resembles commercial magnesia more than anything\r\n    else. In its geological position, it is found underlying the\r\n    basaltic masses, or the products of the last great eruptive\r\n    action of the Sierra Nevada. It is often associated with, or\r\n    intercalated among beds of gravel, fine or coarse-grained\r\n    sandstone and shales, and bears the evident marks of being a\r\n    sedimentary deposit made along the sides of a gently-descending\r\n    broad valley, or lake-like expansion of a valley. This is\r\n    its character in the Sierra Nevada; but as we go north and\r\n    northeast, and come on to the great volcanic table lands\r\n    of Northern California and Southern and Eastern Oregon, we\r\n    find the thickness of the deposits of this kind of material\r\n    increasing, and the area occupied by them more considerable.\r\n    The following localities are especially worthy of notice: North\r\n    of Virginia City, Nevada; Surprise Valley; Pit River, near\r\n    mouth of Canoe Creek; Klamath Basin, or in the vicinity of\r\n    Wright, Rhett and Klamath Lakes; the Des Chutes Basin.\r\n\r\n    Of all the localities, the last mentioned would seem to be the\r\n    most remarkable for the extent and thickness of the deposits in\r\n    question. It was from here that the first specimens examined by\r\n    Ehrenberg, in 1849, were brought by Frémont, who represented\r\n    the deposit as 500 feet thick. This region has since been\r\n    examined by Dr. Newberry, who describes the cañons of the\r\n    tributaries of the Des Chutes as in places 2,000 feet deep, the\r\n    plateaux between which cañons are covered by basaltic lava,\r\n    and this is seen, in the magnificent sections thus presented,\r\n    to rest on a thickness of hundreds of feet of tufaceous\r\n    strata interstratified with a variety of beds of volcanic\r\n    conglomerates, pumice sand, ashes, etc. Dr. Newberry speaks of\r\n    tufaceous strata 1,200 feet in thickness, in the cañon near the\r\n    mouth of the Mptolyas River.\r\n\r\n    The white material, of which some of the more prominent\r\n    localities have been indicated above, and which is well known\r\n    to explorers under so many names, as already mentioned, is\r\n    in reality chiefly of a silicious character, and made up, to\r\n    a large extent, of organic bodies of microscopic dimensions,\r\n    infusoria, or _Diatomaceæ_. This fact was first recognized\r\n    in the case of the specimens collected by Frémont on the Des\r\n    Chutes River, and examined by Bailey and Ehrenberg. Specimens\r\n    collected by Dr. Newberry, on the Pacific Railroad Survey, were\r\n    also examined by Professor Bailey, but I am not aware that any\r\n    detailed description of the results was ever published.\r\n\r\n    Among the collection of the Geological Survey are a large\r\n    number of specimens of the white infusorial deposit, underlying\r\n    the lava at various localities. Of these a preliminary\r\n    examination has been made by Professor Brewer, and a large\r\n    supply of material is now in the hands of Mr. A. M. Edwards,\r\n    of New York, for a detailed examination and report. The fact\r\n    has been already well demonstrated that all or nearly all these\r\n    fine, white, light masses are made up, to a large extent, of\r\n    the silicious remains of the _diatomaceæ_, and in all cases of\r\n    forms peculiar to fresh water. The geological position of these\r\n    beds is extremely recent. They extend from the latter portion\r\n    of the Pliocene into the Post-pliocene epoch, and seem to have\r\n    continued their existence nearly, if not quite, down to the\r\n    present day.\r\n\r\n    So far the facts are very simple, and the principal results\r\n    of our detailed microscopic examination of these infusorial\r\n    deposits will be, the knowledge of the range of the different\r\n    species which occur in them, and the relations of the various\r\n    forms to those now living, either in this region or in other\r\n    parts of the world. This the extent of our collections will\r\n    give us better opportunities to do than others have yet had.\r\n\r\n    There is a point, however, of great interest connected with\r\n    these deposits, in regard to which I desire to make some\r\n    remarks at this present time, and on which I consider that our\r\n    explorations are capable of throwing some light.\r\n\r\n    Ehrenberg has recently[31] examined a specimen collected\r\n    many years ago, in the Toluca Valley, Mexico, by the\r\n    well-known mining engineer Burkart, of what he denominates\r\n    a “Phytolitharien Tuff” or phytolithic tufa, and which came\r\n    to him labeled “Trachytic Tufa, from Toluca Valley, _quere_,\r\n    whether pumice-like or infusorial.” Of this, Ehrenberg says:\r\n    “It is a silver-gray, easily crumbled, gritty tufa, which does\r\n    not effervesce with acids, and which, when heated, becomes\r\n    darker, but not black, and then assumes a light-brownish\r\n    color.” The microscopic analysis of it showed that it was made\r\n    up to a large extent of phytolitharia, which probably belong\r\n    chiefly to the grasses, and between them lie scattered a\r\n    comparatively small number of bacillaria. All are fresh-water\r\n    forms.\r\n\r\n    In his remarks on this material, Ehrenberg recalls the other\r\n    specimens of infusorial tufas, which have been examined by\r\n    him, at various times, since 1839. He mentions particularly\r\n    the rock from the Des Chutes River, collected by Frémont; also\r\n    trachytic tufa, with organic remains, from Honduras; trachytic\r\n    tufa from the volcano Maibu, in Chile; the mud-ejections (?)\r\n    of the volcanoes near Quito; the ejections (?) of the volcano\r\n    Imbabaru, as well as those from the island of Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\n    In regard to the Des Chutes River deposit, it may be\r\n    incidentally remarked that the eminent microscopist seems to\r\n    assign to it a much greater geological age than it really\r\n    deserves; it is, unquestionably, as recent as the latter part\r\n    of the Pliocene.\r\n\r\n    It would appear from what Ehrenberg has published, that he\r\n    considers this occurrence of organic forms, in connection with\r\n    reputed volcanic masses, to be something extremely difficult\r\n    to explain, as indeed it is, if we adopt the view taken by\r\n    him, namely, that these so-called tufaceous materials are the\r\n    direct products of volcanic action; that is to say, that they\r\n    have been ejected from craters, either in the form of showers\r\n    of ashes or of mud out-flows. It would be, indeed, to my\r\n    comprehension, something entirely inexplicable, that such vast\r\n    masses of matter, made up to a large extent of organic forms,\r\n    should be poured forth from the interior of the earth. This\r\n    would be the case, as it appears to me, no matter what theory\r\n    of volcanic action one might choose to adopt; since, whatever\r\n    may be the cause, no one will deny that a high temperature is,\r\n    at least, one of the results. That Ehrenberg really considers\r\n    these infusorial deposits to be of eruptive origin, is evident\r\n    from a remark in his last communication, (that in reference\r\n    to the specimen from the Toluca Valley) to the effect that\r\n    the occurrence of fresh-water forms, exclusively, in these\r\n    infusorial masses is evidence that volcanic phenomena are not\r\n    dependent on, or connected with, the presence of sea-water,\r\n    as is generally supposed, from the fact that volcanoes are\r\n    situated, in most cases, near the sea coast.\r\n\r\n    Not having the necessary works of reference at hand to be able\r\n    to see, in all the cases cited by Ehrenberg, exactly what\r\n    the evidence is, on which his theory of the origin of these\r\n    infusorial deposits is founded, I will not attempt to give an\r\n    authoritative statement in regard to any others than those\r\n    which belong to this coast; but I cannot avoid drawing the\r\n    inference, that the same conditions which are so easily traced\r\n    here will, on future examination, be found existing in all the\r\n    other localities cited by him.\r\n\r\n    The mode of occurrence of these fresh-water infusorial deposits\r\n    in California, and on the Pacific coast in general, is very\r\n    simple. They are accumulations of organisms which have been\r\n    collected at the bottom of the lakes, or in the lake-like\r\n    shallow expansions of rivers, in which they grew. This growth\r\n    took place at a time when volcanic agencies were busily at\r\n    work, giving rise to accumulations of ashes, pumice, and\r\n    other materials. The rapidity with which these infusorial\r\n    deposits form, at the present time even, the vast extent over\r\n    which they are distributed, and the general importance in the\r\n    geological history of the earth, are now matters which are well\r\n    understood, of the masses thus accumulated and in regard to\r\n    which the store of facts has been rapidly growing in magnitude\r\n    during the past few years. The mud deposits and deltas of\r\n    rivers, the bottoms of lakes and swamps, and the bed of the\r\n    ocean itself, are the repositories of these forms. Heat and\r\n    stagnant water seem to be what is required for their rapid\r\n    reproduction and the consequent rapid accumulation of their\r\n    remains.\r\n\r\n    The infusorial deposits of Central California—I refer now\r\n    to those of fresh water origin, and connected with volcanic\r\n    masses—are all situated in such positions as to show, that\r\n    they were formed and deposited in shallow water; that, through\r\n    the various alternations of calm and convulsion in the Sierra,\r\n    they were at one time allowed to accumulate in quiet, then\r\n    swept over by masses of gravel and sand, indicating a furious\r\n    rush of water, then covered with a shower of ashes and pumice\r\n    from the neighboring volcanoes of the Sierra then in active\r\n    operation; and finally, at the grand finale of the basaltic\r\n    lava overflow of the chain, capped with this indestructible\r\n    material, which has effectually prevented the washing away of\r\n    the otherwise easily removed infusorial deposits. This is the\r\n    connection between the volcanic and the infusorial masses; by\r\n    their absolute indestructibility the former have protected the\r\n    latter from denudation, and consequently we see them always\r\n    accompanying each other: for where the cover did not exist,\r\n    there the denuding forces have swept away every vestige of\r\n    the soft and easily yielding material, or else it remains\r\n    concealed under the water. To form an idea of the extent of\r\n    the erosion which has taken place since these infusorial beds\r\n    were deposited, and the consequent change in the configuration\r\n    of the country, we must bear in mind that the whole of the\r\n    present river cañons on the west slope of the Sierra have been\r\n    excavated since that time, and that, in many places, the\r\n    strata have been removed to a vertical depth of between two and\r\n    three thousand feet.\r\n\r\n    Everything shows that the surface covered by fresh water in\r\n    the region east of the crest of the Sierra was, at a not very\r\n    distant epoch, much greater in extent than it now is. There\r\n    existed, probably during or immediately after the glacial\r\n    epoch, a chain of great lakes occupying a large portion of the\r\n    country from Walker’s Lake to the Des Chutes River, a distance\r\n    of about four hundred miles, and extending over a breadth of\r\n    not less than one hundred. A large portion of this region is\r\n    now a volcanic plateau; and, where cut into by the force of\r\n    running water, the deposits of infusorial strata may be seen,\r\n    sometimes thin and unimportant, but often of great thickness.\r\n    Observations and measurements of terraces and determination of\r\n    the altitude of all these old lake deposits will enable us at\r\n    some future time to indicate on the map the area once occupied\r\n    by this great chain of inland seas. The vast extent of the\r\n    lacustrine infusorial formations on the east side of the Sierra\r\n    is thus accounted for, as well as the comparatively small area\r\n    which they cover on the western slope.\r\n\r\n    In addition to the stratigraphical reason given above why\r\n    the infusorial strata should occur connected with eruptive\r\n    masses, there may be a chemical one which shall, in part,\r\n    account for the apparent great development of the _diatomaceæ_\r\n    in volcanic regions. These organisms require an amount of\r\n    silica, infinitesimally small for each individual, but in\r\n    reality enormous for the number of organisms required to\r\n    develop themselves over the vast area and with the thickness\r\n    which they occupy. That a volcanic region should supply a\r\n    larger amount of silica in the state in which it can be\r\n    appropriated by the _diatomaceæ_, is extremely probable. We\r\n    know that silicification of all organic matters occurring in\r\n    these volcanic regions of our coast proceeds with the greatest\r\n    rapidity, and has taken place on an extensive scale. The\r\n    thermal springs contain a great amount of free silica, and\r\n    it is in the vicinity of such springs that large infusorial\r\n    deposits are frequently found. It seems that it could only\r\n    be in regions particularly favorable for the secretion of\r\n    their silicious coverings, that these infusoria could be\r\n    accumulated with such rapidity as to form what may be called,\r\n    without exaggeration, mountain masses. It is also possible\r\n    that temperature may have something to do with this rapid\r\n    development, and that volcanic regions may on this account be\r\n    favorable to it.\r\n\r\n    To my apprehension, the phenomena of infusorial deposits in\r\n    connection with volcanic masses admit of an easy explanation\r\n    on this coast, at least; and I can hardly believe that any of\r\n    the localities of _diatomaceæ_, if closely examined, would\r\n    present any such difficulties as to make the assumption\r\n    necessary that they have been ejected from the interior of the\r\n    earth. In cases where infusoria seem to have been actually\r\n    ejected from craters, as is said to have been the case in\r\n    some of the South American volcanoes, it is not difficult to\r\n    understand that an ancient crater may have become filled up and\r\n    temporarily converted into a lake; and that, after the growth\r\n    and deposition of an infusorial deposit at the bottom, a new\r\n    eruption may have broken out in the same place as a previous\r\n    one, or in its immediate neighborhood. In such a case, among\r\n    the ejected material, a large quantity of the infusoria would\r\n    be found mingled with the ashes, which must pass through the\r\n    material collected in the bottom of the crater as they rise\r\n    from the interior of the earth. The bursting of lakes at the\r\n    bases of volcanic cones, caused by the rapid melting of the\r\n    snows above them, have often given rise to torrents of volcanic\r\n    mud, called “Moya” in South America, in which both animal and\r\n    vegetable remains are often inclosed in great quantity; but the\r\n    connection between the organic and inorganic phenomena, in such\r\n    cases, is perfectly evident.\r\n\r\n    In fact, I see no reason for suspecting any connection between\r\n    the infusorial deposits and the volcanic masses of this coast,\r\n    or of any other part of the world, which should influence the\r\n    geologist in forming an opinion with regard to the cause or the\r\n    locality of volcanic action.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, it may be remarked that the marine infusorial\r\n    rocks of the Pacific coast, and especially of California,\r\n    are of great extent and importance. They occur in the Coast\r\n    Ranges, from Clear Lake to Los Angeles. They are of no little\r\n    economical, as well as scientific, interest; since, as I\r\n    conceive, the existence of bituminous materials in this State,\r\n    in all their forms, from the most liquid to the most dense, is\r\n    due to the presence of infusoria—the proofs of which statement\r\n    I will, at some future time, endeavor to set before the Academy.\r\n\r\n    [30] They are also frequently called “magnesia,” and have been\r\n    repeatedly stated by “assayers” in San Francisco to be made up\r\n    of that earth.\r\n\r\n    [31] See Monatsbericht der Kön.

Blake read the following communication:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of Fossil Elephants’ Teeth from the Northwest Coast.\r\n\r\nBY W. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    The two molar teeth of the extinct elephant which I\r\n    exhibit this evening were presented to me by Col. Bulkley,\r\n    Superintendent of the American and Russian Telegraph. One is\r\n    from the mouth of the Yukon River, and the other from St.\r\n    Paul’s Island, near the middle of Behring’s Sea. The remains\r\n    of elephants are abundant in both places. Tusks are sometimes\r\n    found, and one has been sent by Col. Bulkley to the Smithsonian\r\n    Institution. These new localities may be regarded as forming\r\n    a connecting link between those of Siberia and America, and\r\n    indicate the former continuous distribution of the ancient\r\n    elephant upon the two continents.\r\n\r\n    The following list of localities, known to me, of similar\r\n    fossils in California, will show that the elephant must have\r\n    been frequently seen here in very early times: At Mare Island;\r\n    in Placer County, near Forest Hill; in Tuolumne County, at\r\n    Columbia, Shaw’s Flat, Texas Flat and near Sonora; in Calaveras\r\n    County, at Knight’s Ferry; in Los Angeles County, at San Pedro.\r\n    The last is, I believe, the most southern point at which such\r\n    remains have been found in this State.\r\n\r\nMr. Falkenau read a paper on Peat, in which he gave an account of the\r\norigin, distribution and uses of this material. In the discussion which\r\nfollowed the reading of this communication, it was stated by Mr. Bolander\r\nthat no valuable beds of peat had yet been discovered on this coast.\r\nMessrs. Keyes and Behr also commented on supposed discoveries of this\r\nmaterial in California. The peculiar climate of this region was noticed\r\nas unfavorable to the development of this material.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Gibbon made some remarks on the simultaneity of storms on both\r\nsides of this continent.\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney made some remarks supplementary to his communication to the\r\nAcademy in 1862, on the question—“Which is the highest mountain in the\r\nUnited States, and which in North America?”\r\n\r\n    He remarked that but little had been done, outside of\r\n    California, during the last five years, towards improving\r\n    our knowledge of the topography of the western part of our\r\n    continent. Some valuable contributions to the physical\r\n    geography of the central portion of the eastern edge of the\r\n    Rocky Mountains, have been published by Drs. C. C. Parry\r\n    and Engelmann in the Transactions of the St. Louis Academy,\r\n    (1863 and 1866) and several peaks were measured by Dr.\r\n    Parry; but of these only two are located on any map, namely:\r\n    Long’s and Pike’s. Of these Long’s Peak is 13,456 feet, and\r\n    Pike’s, 14,215; this latter being the highest summit in the\r\n    Rocky Mountain range, at least within the borders of our own\r\n    territory. Of the continuation of the Rocky Mountains north\r\n    into British Columbia, but little is known. Some peaks are\r\n    said to be 16,000 feet and over in height; but it is believed\r\n    that no accurate measurements have been made in that region;\r\n    and, further, it is not at all in accordance with what we\r\n    have learned of the relation of peaks to passes in other\r\n    mountain chains, to suppose that when the passes are as low\r\n    as 5,000 feet, the mountains on either hand should rise to an\r\n    altitude of 16,000 feet. This would be more probable were the\r\n    high points volcanic cones; but this they are not supposed to\r\n    be. Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle’s book, recently published,\r\n    gives no information as to the height of the peaks near the\r\n    pass traversed by their party, (the Leather Head Pass) except\r\n    a statement that one point, far exceeding all others in\r\n    elevation, was “from 10,000 to 15,000 feet high.”\r\n\r\n    Professor Whitney referred again to the fact that the height\r\n    of Mt. St. Elias, as given on the British Admiralty charts,\r\n    and probably from Sir Edward Belcher’s measurement, namely,\r\n    14,970 feet, was still ignored by all compilers of gazetteers\r\n    and geographies, even down to Ansted’s latest work, published\r\n    in 1867. The old figures, 17,854 feet, obtained from an old\r\n    Spanish document found in Mexico by Humboldt, have been shown\r\n    to be grossly exaggerated by two separate measurements of more\r\n    modern times.\r\n\r\n    The recent measurement of Mt. Hood by Mr. A. Wood, was\r\n    mentioned, and several reasons given why little weight should\r\n    be attached to it. If Mr. Wood’s measurement were correct, the\r\n    height of Mt. Hood must be nearly 4,000 feet greater than that\r\n    of Mt. Shasta, and so notable a fact would have been clearly\r\n    recognized by explorers, as it always has been that Mt. Shasta\r\n    itself is nearly that much higher than Lassen’s Peak. But, on\r\n    the other hand, experienced observers have stated that Mt.\r\n    Hood was not as high as Mt. Shasta, nor as Mt. Adams, or Mt.\r\n    Rainier, this last-named peak being, according to Wilkes,\r\n    only 12,300 feet. Again, Mt. Hood was roughly measured by Dr.\r\n    Vansant, and his result (11,934 feet) gives the height of that\r\n    mountain as less than that of Mt. Adams, also measured by him\r\n    with the same instrument, and this instrument could hardly have\r\n    been so rough and liable to error as the one employed by Mr.\r\n    Wood. Further, this last-named gentleman gives the limit of\r\n    forest vegetation on Mt. Hood as 9,000 feet, while our careful\r\n    observations on Mt. Shasta place it on that mountain, at 8,000\r\n    feet. It is certainly contrary to what we have everywhere\r\n    on this coast observed, to suppose that the limit to which\r\n    arboreal growth reaches, should not fall considerably in going\r\n    north three hundred miles, rather than rise 1,000 feet, as\r\n    would be the case if Mr. Wood’s measurements were correct.\r\n    Finally, that Mr. Wood’s figures are not very reliable is\r\n    shown by the fact, that on plotting his estimates of distances\r\n    traveled and the angles of the slopes as given by him, it was\r\n    found that, to correspond with his statements, the mountain\r\n    must be no less than 33,400 feet high.\r\n\r\n    Finally, Professor Whitney concluded that we have as yet no\r\n    satisfactory evidence to invalidate the statement previously\r\n    made by him, that we have in California the highest mountains\r\n    in the United States, and the grandest and largest mountain\r\n    mass in North America, although one or two of the volcanic\r\n    cones of Mexico rise to higher altitudes than any of our peaks.\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney also exhibited one of the short barometers made for the\r\nGeological Survey, by James Green, of New York. Having had occasion to\r\nwork at high elevations—the party being sometimes, for weeks together,\r\ncamped at from 8,000 to 10,000 feet above the sea—it has been found that\r\nthe vacuum in the ordinary barometer tubes soon becomes deteriorated, and\r\nthe mercury dirty from the constant lowering and raising of the column,\r\nwhich is required when a large number of observations are taken at so\r\ngreat an elevation. By having the barometer tube made only long enough to\r\ncommence the reading at about twenty-four inches, or at an elevation of\r\n6,000 or 7,000 feet, the difficulty above specified is to a great degree\r\navoided, and the instrument made much more portable and convenient to\r\ncarry, especially on peaks so steep that both hands are needed to aid\r\nin climbing. Two of these short barometers have been used in the high\r\nmountain work of the California Survey, and found extremely convenient.\r\nOf course the short barometer must be compared with a long one at some\r\nstation camp of sufficiently great elevation to allow this to be done.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons made some remarks on the inferior quality of the macadamizing\r\nmaterial employed in this city. He inquired if any person knew of the\r\nexistence of any better stone for this purpose, in the vicinity of San\r\nFrancisco. Prof. Whitney replied that an excellent basaltic rock was\r\nto be had in great abundance near Petaluma, at a point convenient for\r\nshipment, and that there was no really valuable rock for macadamizing to\r\nbe had nearer than this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 4TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. J. M. Sibley, William Norris, Henry Pickel, John W. Nystrom,\r\nRoss E. Brown, Cornelius B. Miller and Theodore P.

P. Woodward, pp. 18 and 19,\r\n    reference is made to certain genera and species of land shells,\r\n    and several instances are cited proving the remarkable vitality\r\n    of these comparatively insignificant animals, and their ability\r\n    to exist for great lengths of time without food.\r\n\r\n    Particular mention is made of a specimen of the snail _Helix\r\n    desertorum_, which was affixed to a tablet in the British\r\n    Museum, March 25th, 1846, and upon the 7th of March, 1850, it\r\n    was observed that the animal must have come out of the shell,\r\n    as the paper was discolored in the attempt to get away, but\r\n    finding escape impossible, it had withdrawn inside of the shell\r\n    and closed the aperture with the usual glistening film, which\r\n    led to its immersion in tepid water and marvelous recovery. It\r\n    will be noticed that this period embraced nearly four years.\r\n\r\n    A more remarkable case has come under my observation, which is\r\n    worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Veatch, a member of this Academy, visited Cerros or Cedros\r\n    Island, opposite the west coast of Lower California, and upon\r\n    his return, in the year 1859, brought home, among other\r\n    shells, a species of Helix, supposed to be new, described by\r\n    Dr. Newcomb, of Oakland, and to which the latter gave the\r\n    name of _Helix Veatchii_; many specimens of this species were\r\n    obtained, and some of them were given by Dr. Veatch to the late\r\n    Thomas Bridges. Mr. Bridges died in September, 1865, and in\r\n    December of the same year a portion of his collection passed\r\n    into my hands, including the same specimens of _Helix Veatchii_\r\n    to which I have before alluded. Judge of my surprise, when one\r\n    day, upon a careful examination, I detected a living specimen,\r\n    which, after being placed in a box of moist earth, in a short\r\n    time commenced crawling about, apparently as well as ever.\r\n    Fearing from its activity that by some accident it might crawl\r\n    away, and I might thus lose it, after a fortnight’s furlough\r\n    from its long imprisonment, I placed it in a pill-box, marking\r\n    the date of its reimprisonment upon the cover, in order that\r\n    at some future time I may examine it, and ascertain possibly,\r\n    if it does not outlive _me_, how long a snail can live without\r\n    rations.\r\n\r\n    Here is an instance of a snail living at least six years—in\r\n    Californian parlance, without a single “square meal.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander made some remarks in regard to the botanical collections of\r\nMr. Alphonso Wood, in California and Oregon, in 1866.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wood claims to have collected in five months, in\r\n    California, 1,490 species of flowering plants, as appears by a\r\n    letter over his own signature in the San Francisco Bulletin;\r\n    furthermore, he also asserts, that during his whole journey\r\n    in California and Oregon he collected 15,000 specimens,\r\n    representing 2,794 species of plants. This journey occupied\r\n    about eleven months, including the time spent in coming from\r\n    and returning to the East. The route of Mr. Wood was from\r\n    San Diego north, through the regions which have been most\r\n    thoroughly collected over and studied by botanists, namely,\r\n    along the stage road to Los Angeles and San Bernardino, then to\r\n    San Louis Obispo, Santa Cruz, and north through the Sacramento\r\n    Valley, past the base of Mount Shasta, and along the stage road\r\n    to the Columbia River. Mr. Bolander considered it probable that\r\n    there were not over 500 species of flowering plants actually\r\n    existing in that part of California explored by Mr. Wood,\r\n    and in which he professes to have collected 1,490 species.\r\n    According to Professor Brewer’s careful investigations, it\r\n    appears that over fifty botanists have collected in California\r\n    and Oregon, during a period extending back for more than\r\n    seventy years. Some of these collectors were engaged for years\r\n    in the business, and had far greater facilities at their\r\n    command than those enjoyed by Mr. Wood, and they have jointly\r\n    thoroughly explored a far greater area than that even hastily\r\n    passed over by him. Yet, the sum total of all the species\r\n    obtained, up to the time of Mr. Wood’s visit, is only about\r\n    1,800 species, while he claims to have found 2,794; that is to\r\n    say, nearly 1,000 species more than had been brought to light\r\n    by fifty persons in seventy years. The absurdity of Mr. Wood’s\r\n    claims is self-evident. But, a comparison of his figures with\r\n    those of Eastern botanists will throw still further light\r\n    on this subject. Professor Gray enumerates, in his manual,\r\n    only 2,426 species of plants as occurring in the eighteen\r\n    Northern United States and Canada East, embracing an area of\r\n    no less than 600,000 square miles. The whole of California and\r\n    Oregon includes only about 250,000 square miles, only a very\r\n    small portion of which could have been thoroughly explored by\r\n    Mr. Wood; how unlikely, then, that he should have actually\r\n    obtained, in nine months, 368 species more on 250,000 square\r\n    miles, than all the botanists of the East have found on more\r\n    than double that area. Mr. Bolander also brought forward\r\n    ample evidence to show that Mr. Wood was not competent to\r\n    determine how many new species he had collected, proving by the\r\n    written statements of Dr. Kellogg, and others, that he was not\r\n    acquainted with some of the most common and easily recognized\r\n    genera of this coast.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons made some remarks on the rain-fall of this region during the\r\nlast seventeen years.\r\n\r\nMr. Gutzkow exhibited a sheet of metallic silver of three feet in\r\ndiameter, and about three ounces Troy weight, which had the appearance\r\nand consistency of white writing paper. It was taken from the surface\r\nof a lead-lined tank, in which a solution of protoxide of iron was\r\nsaturated, near the boiling point, with sulphate of silver. If the\r\ntemperature of the solution is maintained at a certain height, sheet\r\nafter sheet can be stripped off from the surface. The silver thus\r\nobtained, is, after washing with muriatic acid to free it from the iron\r\nsolution, chemically pure, and by its peculiar shape and purity, well\r\nadapted to serve as proof silver for assaying purposes. The experiment\r\nwill work only when operating on a rather large scale, so as to prevent\r\nthe too sudden cooling of the solution. The chemical action to which it\r\nis due is the oxydation of the protoxide of iron into sesquioxide at the\r\nexpense of the oxygen combined with the silver. This oxydation, which\r\nis known to precipitate the silver as a whitish powder, begins to take\r\nplace only at a certain temperature below the boiling point, and is made,\r\nin the above experiment, to act on the crystals of sulphate of silver\r\nseparating on the surface of the slowly cooling solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MARCH 18TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-six members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs.

G. COOPER, M.D.\r\n\r\n    In the article on p. 259, Vol. III, of these Proceedings for\r\n    April 2d, 1866, I suggested a division of the Californian\r\n    Banded Helices into five subgenera, founded on the shells\r\n    alone. Since then, Mr. G. W. Tryon has published a synopsis of\r\n    all of them except _H. facta_ in his “Journal of Conchology,”\r\n    Vol. II, Part 4, for October, 1866, arranging them in the\r\n    “genera” _Aglaia_, _Arianta_ and _Polymita_, but differing\r\n    essentially from Albers and other authors in the species he\r\n    assigns to these groups. The types of these subgenera, however,\r\n    differ so much from our species that it is easy to separate\r\n    the shells by good subgeneric characters; and as they inhabit\r\n    respectively South America, Europe, and Cuba, it is very\r\n    probable that the animals differ still more. Until these have\r\n    been compared, we may well hesitate in referring ours to the\r\n    same groups, and must for the present be guided by the shells\r\n    alone.\r\n\r\n    In examining these, the most striking and almost universal\r\n    character we find is the presence of a dark band, generally\r\n    pale margined, on one or both sides, and situated at or close\r\n    to the breathing aperture in the animal’s mantle, apparently\r\n    having some physiological connection with this opening. It is\r\n    too uniform and general to be merely an ornamental marking,\r\n    such as we find in many species, especially the tropical, which\r\n    usually show no uniformity in the arrangement of their bands.\r\n\r\n    The next most constant characters are those derived from the\r\n    nature of the surface, whether hirsute, with revolving grooves,\r\n    smooth or variously sculptured, with wrinkles, zigzag or\r\n    oblique patterns.\r\n\r\n    Although colors alone are usually unreliable as subgeneric\r\n    characters, I am inclined to consider them as such in the\r\n    case of these and some allied species, from their apparent\r\n    connection with important organs. In fact the band, so\r\n    constant in this large series of species, takes precedence of\r\n    considerable variety of form, for the variations in outline,\r\n    umbilicus, and peristome, though great in the extremes, are\r\n    so gradually shaded and blended together in the whole series\r\n    that no well-defined generic divisions can be founded on them,\r\n    though useful for the minor grouping. The umbilicus especially\r\n    is variable even in specimens of the same species, those from\r\n    southern and arid regions being often nearly imperforate, and\r\n    more conical than others.\r\n\r\n    Several Mexican species belong to the same series, such as H.\r\n    REMONDII _Tryon_, H. GRISEOLA _Pfeiff_, and H. BERLANDIERIANA\r\n    _Moric._, the two last extending to Texas. Others, as H.\r\n    HUMBOLDTIANA _Val._, scarcely differ from the typical _Pomatia_\r\n    in form. I would, however, exclude the true _Hygromias_\r\n    associated with these by Tryon. I would also exclude the plain\r\n    or variegated species of Lower California, which approach\r\n    nearer to _Polymita_. It must be observed that many of our\r\n    species approach in form to others of allied groups, so that\r\n    if we overlook characters of color and surface, we will be\r\n    inclined to place in the same groups, Nos. 40 and 52, 24\r\n    and 32, 29 and 47, etc. Even in color Nos. 32 to 35 show an\r\n    approach to the group of Lower California, but seem more\r\n    closely allied to our series, having merely a geographical\r\n    affinity to the former. Size is of little value, even as a\r\n    specific character among the land shells, nearly all the\r\n    species furnishing specimens twice as large as others of the\r\n    same kind. The proportions of height to breadth are more\r\n    reliable, but not constant.\r\n\r\n    The subgenus or division characterized by the band is scarcely\r\n    distinguishable as a whole from the typical _Helix_, (type\r\n    _pomatia_) of Europe, though the extremes vary greatly,\r\n    simulating the three or more foreign genera to which various\r\n    authors have attached them.[32]\r\n\r\n    Our species are distinct enough among themselves when the true\r\n    specific characters here given are noted, though occasionally\r\n    hybrids undoubtedly occur. Dr. W. Newcomb has raised many\r\n    specimens in his garden in Oakland, combining the characters\r\n    of Nos. 24, 25, 29, 31, and 43, in such manner that it is\r\n    often impossible to determine which they belong to. Yet their\r\n    natural locations are usually so widely separated that only\r\n    occasionally can hybrids occur in a state of nature, and where\r\n    several do inhabit one locality, as 24, 27, 28, 46 do at Santa\r\n    Cruz, though nearly allied, intermediate forms are not found.\r\n    Some of the so-called species are, however, scarcely more than\r\n    hybrids or varieties, but the names are retained as indicating\r\n    their differences, though almost every species is divisible\r\n    into varieties as well marked or better. Thus the specimen\r\n    described on p. 260 of this volume (from Mount Diablo) seems to\r\n    be a hybrid between _mormonum_ and _ramentosa_, and we also\r\n    find specimens connecting the latter with 25, 26, and perhaps\r\n    others.\r\n\r\n    Occasional links also occur, connecting many others of the\r\n    banded species together.\r\n\r\n    A similar intermixing of species, where nearly allied, occurs\r\n    among our marine shells wherever two or more encroach on each\r\n    other’s limits; but the comparative rarity of the intermediate\r\n    forms seems to indicate hybridity rather than specific identity\r\n    of their allies.\r\n\r\n    It is probable that groups X and XI and XIII and XIV should be\r\n    united, as the distinctive characters between them are not of\r\n    first importance, and species of each are very closely similar\r\n    otherwise. Parallel columns may be formed, as indicated on p.\r\n    260, in which close resemblances in form, number of whorls,\r\n    etc., between species of the different groups may be shown,\r\n    and this may be extended so as to show analogous parallels\r\n    with those of other sub-families, or even families, but these\r\n    resemblances do not indicate affinity, though very likely to\r\n    mislead. A geographical arrangement of some groups is also\r\n    indicated, though imperfectly, as there are no impassable\r\n    limits between them. For special localities of many species,\r\n    see vol. III, pp. 62, 115, 180, 259, and II, 91, 103.[33]\r\n\r\n    The Darwinian theory of development might be very beautifully\r\n    illustrated by these banded snails, if we could find evidence\r\n    that their various forms had all originated from a common\r\n    stock (which might be the _ramentosa_, as that species now\r\n    occupies a nearly central locality). But though fossil forms\r\n    have been found differing considerably from their present\r\n    representatives, there are others apparently as old, which show\r\n    no such differences, and none of them show a tendency towards\r\n    any common original type. The one referred to by Professor\r\n    Whitney on p. 278, as found with the human skull of supposed\r\n    pliocene (?) age, does not differ perceptibly from specimens\r\n    of _mormonum_, now living near the locality. It retains even\r\n    its band of color, which is soon lost in specimens imbedded\r\n    near the surface, and this (if not preserved by its deep burial\r\n    or incrustation) is strong evidence against a great antiquity\r\n    of the skull. All other fossil Helicoids are considered\r\n    postpliocene, at least so far as known in this State, though\r\n    extinct species occur in Europe as far back as the Eocene.\r\n\r\n    The bandless species of the west coast slope, from lat. 33°\r\n    to 49°, are added to the synopsis, to show their relations\r\n    and analogies with the banded. The arrangement followed is\r\n    essentially that of Tryon, except the addition of some he has\r\n    omitted, or not yet published. The generic divisions are also\r\n    reduced to groups, as the true generic characters are not yet\r\n    settled. The lip is entirely wanting in the first family,\r\n    but in the bandless _Helicidæ_ of this coast, it becomes of\r\n    great importance for grouping of species, (49 to 55) of which\r\n    we have very few, while east of the Rocky Mountains there\r\n    are more than fifty. Group III is also largely developed on\r\n    the Atlantic slopes. The tendency now is to divide too much,\r\n    which is as unnatural as to unite all under genus HELIX, as\r\n    many still do. It is probable that the divisions here called\r\n    subfamilies, answer more nearly to the true genera than any\r\n    others, though they require modification, and the selection\r\n    of names applicable to them as genera, is a difficult task. To\r\n    undertake to distinguish genera by the lingual teeth, mucous\r\n    pores, or any other single character of the soft parts, is\r\n    less practicable than to do it by the shells alone, and little\r\n    if any more reliable. There may, however, be foreign shells\r\n    closely resembling ours in form, which must still be separated\r\n    on account of the animal.\r\n\r\n    I have omitted most of the compound terms used by authors to\r\n    describe the forms or shells, as they are not used with any\r\n    uniform system, and do not well define the differences between\r\n    the various species of the same group. The dimensions are\r\n    more reliable for separating allied forms. “Striæ” is also an\r\n    indefinite term, used by various authors for lines of growth,\r\n    revolving grooves or stripes of color, and is therefore never\r\n    used alone in this article.\r\n\r\n    It is remarkable that no _reversed_ species or variety has yet\r\n    been found west of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Order PULMONIFERA.\r\n\r\n    Mollusca with or without shells, breathing by lungs, inhabiting\r\n    the land, fresh or salt waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Subord.

Though not offered\r\n    as a final arrangement of the species, it is hoped that this\r\n    synopsis may aid in their determination, and thus make a step\r\n    towards a correct systematizing of this difficult series.\r\n\r\n    There are four or five other subgenera among the 50 species\r\n    of this family in the Atlantic States, divided by Bland into\r\n    fifteen groups. He places Nos. 51, 54, and 53 in his 8th, 9th,\r\n    and 15th groups respectively.—(Ann. N. Y. Lyc. N.

(A genus _Pomatia_ has also been founded on this\r\n    type of the Linnæan genus _Helix_.)\r\n\r\n    _Aglaia_ was used by Escholtz, 1825, in Acalephæ, by Swainson,\r\n    1827, in Birds, and by Renier Philinidæ, before Albers adopted\r\n    it in this order!!\r\n\r\n    [33] See, also, the “Geographical Catalogue of West Coast\r\n    Mollusca,” published by the State Geological Survey, April,\r\n    1867.\r\n\r\n    [34] The west slope specimens may be all of species 20.\r\n\r\n    [35] A specimen figured by Mr. Tryon in the last number of the\r\n    “Journal” just received, (May, 1867), as “var. _minor_,” from\r\n    Idaho and Nebraska, seems to have an obscure band, which,\r\n    together with its form and want of wrinkles, indicate entire\r\n    distinctness from _Townsendiana_. The small form of the latter\r\n    found by me in Montana has no band, and seems close to Binney’s\r\n    _anachoreta_, of which supposed specimens from “Oregon” are\r\n    in Mr. Rowell’s collection. The Eastern _Mesodon clausa_,\r\n    _elevata_ and perhaps others, have been found banded\r\n    occasionally, but without the paler margins, and only\r\n    as an exception.\r\n\r\nProf. W. P. Blake read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Submerged Forests in the Columbia River, Oregon.\r\n\r\nBY WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    The submerged forests of fir trees, extending about twenty-five\r\n    miles along the Columbia River, above the Cascades, have long\r\n    excited the curiosity of travelers upon that stream. The trees\r\n    stand erect as they grew, but the tops have decayed and broken\r\n    off, leaving only those portions of the trees that have been\r\n    protected from the air by the covering of water. At extreme\r\n    high-water very few of these old trunks can be seen, but at\r\n    low-water they appear in great numbers, and project a few\r\n    inches or feet above the surface, and in some places they\r\n    extend far out into the stream.\r\n\r\n    These trees are not petrified, as is supposed by many. The\r\n    outer portions are much softened and partly decayed, but\r\n    towards the heart the wood is sound, and appears to be\r\n    identical in character with the fir which covers the mountains\r\n    around. Some cedar stumps are also found.\r\n\r\n    It is well known that fir trees will not grow below the\r\n    high-water mark of our streams, or where the roots would be\r\n    subject to overflows. Flooding the roots of the fir even for a\r\n    few days is sufficient to destroy its life. It is thus clear\r\n    that there has been a change in the level of the water since\r\n    the forests grew. Either the land has sunk or the water has\r\n    been raised: the latter appears to have been the fact.\r\n\r\n    The river at the Cascades, just below the submerged forests,\r\n    plunges over great masses of a hard volcanic conglomerate,\r\n    which forms the base of the cliffs on each side. This\r\n    conglomerate, which is 150 to 200 feet thick, rests upon a\r\n    stratum of sandy clay. This stratum is much softer than the\r\n    conglomerate, and yields more rapidly to the action of running\r\n    water. It may be seen when the water is low, at the foot of the\r\n    Cascades, with the hard conglomerate overhanging it in large\r\n    masses.\r\n\r\n    From all these facts, it appears that the river, in cutting\r\n    its way downwards through the Cascade Range, reached this soft\r\n    substratum, and for a long time flowed in a comparatively\r\n    unobstructed channel at a much lower level than now, thus\r\n    permitting the forests to grow along its banks. The extensive\r\n    undermining of the conglomerate caused it at length to fall\r\n    into the stream, and this, together with the sliding in of\r\n    the banks upon this soft foundation, I regard as forming the\r\n    obstruction which dammed the waters and caused the overflow of\r\n    the forests above.\r\n\r\n    The mountains rise on each side to a height of 2,500 or 3,000\r\n    feet, and are composed of nearly horizontal beds of lava. One\r\n    of these mountains on the right bank, or Washington Territory\r\n    side, presents vertical cliffs towards the Cascades, and these\r\n    cliffs have a _freshly broken_ appearance, as if a large part\r\n    of the mountain had _broken off_ at no very remote period. The\r\n    surface of the country between this cliff and the Cascades is\r\n    very much broken, and the railroad which traverses it, exposes\r\n    enormous masses of the conglomerate, piled confusedly together\r\n    as if they had been hurled down by a land-slide. Mr. Brazee,\r\n    the engineer of the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, informs\r\n    me that the ground is in constant motion toward the river, and\r\n    it has necessitated the relaying of the track within the past\r\n    year. The same phenomena have been observed on the left bank,\r\n    or Oregon side. The bank is in constant motion there, and at\r\n    low-water a fine blue clay may be seen rising in the channel,\r\n    as if crowded out by the pressure of the rocks above. As there\r\n    has not been any perceptible change of level in the stream for\r\n    years past, we may conclude that the erosive action of the\r\n    current is fully equal to the encroachment of the banks.\r\n\r\n    The Indians of the Columbia have a tradition of a great\r\n    convulsion at the Cascades. They assert that the Chinook canoes\r\n    formerly ascended the river as far as a water-fall at the\r\n    Dalles, passing, at the Cascades, _under a bridge of rock_.\r\n    This bridge, or arch of rock, they say, fell in at the time of\r\n    a quarrel between the two mountains, Mt. Hood and St. Helen’s,\r\n    and at the same time the waterfall at the Dalles was destroyed,\r\n    so that salmon could ascend to the Upper Columbia. Before that\r\n    the fall was so high that salmon could not get up, and all the\r\n    upper country Indians were obliged to go to the Dalles for\r\n    their supply.\r\n\r\n    The general accuracy of this tradition seems highly probable.\r\n    The Dalles are now a succession of rapids and low falls, in a\r\n    narrow channel, between vertical walls of basaltic lava. There\r\n    is very little fall or current in the river below the Dalles to\r\n    the Cascades, and the elevation of the water by an obstruction\r\n    at the latter point would in all probability affect the height\r\n    of the lower fall at the Dalles.\r\n\r\n    The sandy substratum of the coarse conglomerate at the Cascades\r\n    is evidently an old river or beach deposit. It is accompanied\r\n    by layers of round water-worn rocks, and is filled with trunks\r\n    of trees lying prostrate. These trees are fossilized. Some\r\n    of them are half coal and half stone. The central portions\r\n    are usually coal-like or carbonized, and the outer parts\r\n    silicified. They vary in size, from a few inches to six feet\r\n    in diameter, and are nearly all flattened by pressure. This\r\n    stratum is evidently the source of the great quantities of\r\n    silicified wood which are found about the Cascades.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following note on a large specimen of _Orthagoriscus\r\nanalis_, Ayres:\r\n\r\n    In passing through the Italian Fish Market in this City, in\r\n    the month of October, 1866, I noticed an unusually large\r\n    specimen of _Orthagoriscus analis_, commonly called “Sun Fish,”\r\n    described by Dr. Ayres on page 31 of Vol. II of the Academy\r\n    Proceedings. Curiosity led me to make a measurement, which I\r\n    find in my note-book as follows: length from snout to extreme\r\n    caudal point, 5 feet 8¼ inches; from tip of dorsal to tip of\r\n    anal fin, 7 feet 6 inches. I found the anal and dorsal fins to\r\n    be nearly the same length, measuring from the tip to junction\r\n    with body 23 inches. Weight, as stated by the fishermen, 632\r\n    pounds. It will be seen that the measurement from tip to tip of\r\n    fins as above, exceeds the length by 21¾ inches.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns made the following remarks as to the true habitat of _Helix\r\nAyresiana_, Newc.:\r\n\r\n    On page 103, Vol. II, of the Academy’s Proceedings, may be\r\n    found, under date of March 18th, 1861, the description by Dr.\r\n    W. Newcomb of a _Helix H. Ayresiana_, the habitat of which was,\r\n    as I learn from Dr. N., doubtfully assigned at that time to\r\n    “Northern Oregon.” Recently Dr. Newcomb has himself detected it\r\n    on Santa Cruz Island, off the Coast of California, near Santa\r\n    Barbara.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited a sample of the coal used at Salt Lake City,\r\ntaken by Mr. Ives, chief of one of the Central Pacific Railroad surveying\r\nparties, from a wagon on its way from the mines to the city. The locality\r\nfrom which it was obtained is in Webber Cañon, and the geological age of\r\nthe deposit is supposed to be cretaceous. The quality of the coal seems\r\nto be good; but nothing very definite could be communicated in regard to\r\nthe extent or geological position of the bed.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney also exhibited a specimen of very pure rock salt,\r\nobtained from the Salt Mountain on the Muddy River, a branch of the\r\nVirgin, nearly a hundred miles south of Pahranagat, by Major S. S. Lyon,\r\nformerly of the Kentucky Geological Survey. Major Lyon being present,\r\nat the request of the President, gave an account of this interesting\r\nlocality, which is one long known to explorers. He stated that the Salt\r\nMountain lies on both sides of the Muddy River, and rises 400 feet above\r\nthat stream. The locality is about thirty miles northeast of Colville,\r\nand twenty from the Colorado. Major Lyon also gave some facts in regard\r\nto the geology of the vicinity of Pahranagat, where he had been residing\r\nfor some months past.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney presented two analyses of ores from the Comstock Lode,\r\nVirginia City, Nevada, made by Professor Domeyko, of Santiago, Chile, and\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Rémond, who is now residing in that place. They are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                     I.

A discussion ensued, in the course of which Professor Whitney\r\nand Mr. Ashburner expressed their doubts as to the possibility of the\r\nlocality of any extensive mining operations being long concealed, and\r\ntheir disbelief in the truth of newspaper statements to this effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 1ST, 1867.\r\n\r\nProf. W.

SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n    “Purissima” and “Lobitas” are the names of two creeks situated\r\n    a few miles south of Spanish Town, in San Mateo County. Near\r\n    the points where these streams empty into the ocean are small\r\n    beaches and groups of flat rocks left bare at low tide,\r\n    limited, however, in extent, as the shore in the neighborhood\r\n    is for the most part exceedingly bold and precipitous, the\r\n    ocean at ordinary high water beating against the base of the\r\n    cliffs.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Newcomb and myself visited the localities at the period\r\n    above mentioned, and collected the following species from among\r\n    the drift or upon the rocks:\r\n\r\n      1.

P. Blake read the following communications:\r\n\r\n\r\nNote upon the Brown Coal Formation of Washington Territory and Oregon.\r\n\r\nBY WM. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    Openings recently made in the coal formations along the Cowlitz\r\n    River have shown the existence of several seams of brown\r\n    coal, ranging from two to seven feet in thickness. They are\r\n    separated by layers of sandstone, and are underlaid by a pebbly\r\n    conglomerate.\r\n\r\n    The seven-foot seam contains a few partings of clay about\r\n    six inches thick, but is chiefly a very compact coal, which\r\n    breaks out in large blocks with a conchoidal fracture. It is\r\n    very tough, and is not easily broken. It has the appearance of\r\n    cannel or splint coal. Exposure to the sun and air causes it to\r\n    shrink and crack.\r\n\r\n    It burns freely, giving a luminous flame, and a light smoke,\r\n    similar to that from wood. The ignited coals hold fire in a\r\n    remarkable manner, and with a strong draught or blast give an\r\n    intense heat. A single fragment, when ignited, will continue to\r\n    burn slowly to the center under an envelope of ash. A sun-dried\r\n    sample gave me 50.8 per cent. of volatile matter, chiefly gas.\r\n    The residue was a brilliant coke, the fragments of which were\r\n    slightly adherent, thus showing a tendency to cake. Trials\r\n    of the coal in quantity in open grates failed, however, to\r\n    show any caking qualities. Some portions of the coal expand\r\n    when burning and give a porous coke, which in many respects\r\n    resembles ordinary charcoal.\r\n\r\n    This deposit appears to be formed in great part of trunks of\r\n    exogenous trees. One trunk has been cut through that was over\r\n    four feet in thickness: a part of this was compact coal, and\r\n    another portion was in a half silicified state. Lines of annual\r\n    growth may be seen in some of the samples. This combustible\r\n    partakes of the characters of both coal and wood, and is in\r\n    fact a highly condensed wood, carbonized, without the loss of\r\n    its volatile portions.\r\n\r\n    Fossil plants are found in abundance in the adjoining sandy\r\n    beds. They are chiefly leaves of deciduous trees, but there are\r\n    some very distinct impressions of palms. This is significant of\r\n    a warmer climate.\r\n\r\n    The same formation of brown coal appears to extend along the\r\n    Columbia, back of St. Helen’s, where it is in close proximity\r\n    to beds of iron ore, and the coal may perhaps be used to great\r\n    advantage in the production of that metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Mt. Diablo (California) Coal.\r\n\r\nBY W. P. BLAKE.\r\n\r\n    A sample of Mt. Diablo coal, from the Pittsburg mine, was\r\n    analyzed by me in January last, with the following results:\r\n\r\n    Water                     3.28\r\n    Bituminous substances    47.05\r\n    Fixed carbon             44.90\r\n    Ash                       4.71\r\n\r\n    The sample was very pure, and apparently free from sulphur.\r\n    Color black. Fracture sub-conchoidal, giving brilliant shining\r\n    surfaces. It is very brittle, and is easily reduced to powder\r\n    in a mortar. Streak, dark brown.\r\n\r\n    This coal does not fuse so as to cake and make a compact\r\n    mass of coke. It is not therefore an economical coal for gas\r\n    production. It gives a long flame in burning; parts with\r\n    its gas rapidly and breaks up into small fragments, thus\r\n    necessitating the use of grate-bars with narrow openings. The\r\n    above analysis differs from those hitherto published, chiefly\r\n    in the amount of water and gas. Former analyses give from\r\n    thirteen to fourteen per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nMr. Hanks presented an analysis of the rock-salt collected by Major Lyon\r\non the Muddy River, as mentioned in the proceedings of the last meeting.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 6th, the Academy made a field excursion to Angel\r\nIsland, about fifteen members participating in the meeting. Facilities\r\nwere afforded for the excursion by Major James T. Hoyt and General John\r\nA. King; and to these gentlemen the thanks of the Academy were ordered to\r\nbe returned by the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, APRIL 15TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-three members present.\r\n\r\nThe collections made during the field meeting on Angel Island were\r\nexhibited and commented on.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman read the following paper:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of a peculiar mode of the occurrence of Gold and Silver in the\r\nFoot-Hills of the Sierra Nevada, and especially at Whisky Hill, in Placer\r\nCounty, and Quail Hill, in Calaveras County, California.\r\n\r\nBY B. SILLIMAN.\r\n\r\n    In the search for ores of copper which occurred in California\r\n    in what is now known as the “Copper Belt” of the Lower Sierras,\r\n    deposits of “Iron Rust,” as they were called by the miners,\r\n    were observed at numerous points far below the range of the\r\n    main gold belt of the Sierras. Several of these ochraceous\r\n    deposits had been previously “located” by prospecting miners\r\n    for gold, before there was any knowledge, or suspicion even,\r\n    of the existence of ores of copper in connection with them. It\r\n    was a matter of common observation that certain gulches, or\r\n    watercourses in the neighborhood of these rusty deposits, were\r\n    rich in placer gold, having been worked for gold from an early\r\n    date. The search for copper in this kind of deposit was not\r\n    commercially successful, although there were shipments of green\r\n    and blue carbonates of copper, red oxide and metallic copper,\r\n    to a limited extent from both the localities here referred to,\r\n    the metal from which was known to contain a notable value of\r\n    gold and silver, stated to be about fifty dollars to the ton\r\n    of ore. This search for copper has, however, opened up these\r\n    deposits so as to display their character in a conspicuous\r\n    manner.\r\n\r\n    The rocks appear to have been originally talcose and chloritic\r\n    schists, sometimes micaceous, inclosing masses of argillite,\r\n    and of quartz which appears to have been massive enough at\r\n    certain points to assume the character of a vein, and parallel\r\n    to the stratification which has the usual north-western strike\r\n    and easterly dip of the region. All this mass of material\r\n    which at Quail Hill is certainly three hundred feet wide, and\r\n    possibly twice that, and with a linear extent exceeding one\r\n    thousand feet, appears to have been very highly impregnated or\r\n    mineralized by sulphurets, chiefly of iron, with a portion of\r\n    copper, zinc and lead. The sulphurets have undergone almost\r\n    total decomposition throughout the entire mass, leaving soft\r\n    ochraceous deposits of a rusty red and yellow color, and\r\n    staining the rocks with brilliant colors, a peculiarity which\r\n    the miners have characterized by the name of “Calico rocks.”\r\n    This decomposition or oxidation of the sulphurets, has extended\r\n    to a point as low as atmospheric influences extend, or probably\r\n    to a point where water is permanently found, which at Quail\r\n    Hill is assumed to be about 170 feet below the outcrop of the\r\n    mass, or crest of the hill. Dykes of porphyry and of other\r\n    rocks, commonly called intrusive, are seen dividing these\r\n    great ore channels in a direction conformable to the line of\r\n    strike. But the decomposition which has affected other portions\r\n    of the ore channel, appears also to have changed them, for\r\n    they are found to be reduced completely to the condition of\r\n    kaolin and lithomarge, or kindred alterations of feldspathic\r\n    rocks. The outlines of the feldspar crystals are still easily\r\n    distinguished, although the mass of the dykes is completely\r\n    friable.\r\n\r\n    The zinc blende which is found in small quantities at Whisky\r\n    Hill, and the vitreous copper also to some extent, appear to\r\n    have escaped decomposition. The copper ores appear to have\r\n    been confined to a portion of the deposit, as is indicated\r\n    in the section exhibited, while the auriferous sulphuret of\r\n    iron has been co-extensive with the ore channel, the cubical\r\n    cavities left by the decay of its crystals being found in all\r\n    the outcrops both in the quartz and in the ‘calico rocks,’\r\n    resulting from the decomposition of feldspathic and talcose or\r\n    chloritic constituents.\r\n\r\n    Accompanying the entire mass of decomposition at both\r\n    localities, occur both gold and silver, disseminated with\r\n    remarkable uniformity in all parts of the orey ground. At\r\n    Whisky Hill, films of metallic silver are visible upon the\r\n    talcose masses stained green by malachite or chrysocolla; the\r\n    gold is rarely seen in situ, being mostly obscured by the very\r\n    rusty and highly-stained character of the associated materials.\r\n    But it is rare that on washing a small quantity of any of the\r\n    contents of these great deposits, gold is not found in angular\r\n    grains or small ragged masses, from the size of a few grains’\r\n    weight, to impalpable dust. Nuggets of several pennyweights\r\n    occur occasionally. This gold has evidently accompanied the\r\n    sulphurets and been left in its present position and condition\r\n    by their decomposition. There can be little doubt that the gold\r\n    of the gulches adjoining these deposits has been derived from\r\n    them. At Whisky Hill, the gulch gold ceases to be found as\r\n    soon as the limits of this deposit are passed, and the same is\r\n    true at Quail Hill. The occurrence of deposits of this nature\r\n    throughout the range of the foot-hills, seems to offer the best\r\n    solution which has suggested itself of the origin of the placer\r\n    gold which is found in situations so far removed from the\r\n    gold belt of the upper Sierras, and away from sources usually\r\n    recognized as those to which placer gold may be referred.\r\n\r\n    Experiments made by myself and by others on a considerable\r\n    scale, the details of which will appear elsewhere, show that\r\n    the amount of the precious metals disseminated in the average\r\n    mass of vein stuff and decomposed materials of every name at\r\n    Quail Hill, is considerably in excess of the general average\r\n    tenor of gold veins in California. The mean of my own trials\r\n    gave to the ton of 2,000 lbs. by assay:\r\n\r\n    Gold   $35.14\r\n    Silver  15.08\r\n           ------\r\n           $50.22\r\n\r\n    While from the working of carefully prepared averages in\r\n    considerable quantity by milling process, the tenor of the\r\n    precious metals was:\r\n\r\n    Gold   $29.18\r\n    Silver   5.91\r\n           ------\r\n           $35.09\r\n\r\n    The extremely friable condition of the entire mass of these\r\n    auriferous materials renders their extraction and treatment\r\n    easy and comparatively inexpensive.\r\n\r\n    At Whisky Hill, a mill of forty stamps has been set up which is\r\n    now running with satisfactory returns. The cost by contract of\r\n    delivery of the ores to the mill, being stated at forty cents\r\n    (40c.) per ton, the cost of mining and treatment in mill being\r\n    considerably less, it is said, than one dollar per ton, the\r\n    amount treated being five tons to each stamp.\r\n\r\n    The chemical results of the extensive decomposition of\r\n    metallic sulphids which has in former times occurred at\r\n    these localities, offer an interesting problem in chemical\r\n    geology. The sulphur has been removed chiefly as sulphuric\r\n    acid beyond doubt, which has combined with iron and copper to\r\n    form sulphates of these metals. These have for the most part\r\n    disappeared, being washed out by the atmospheric waters, and\r\n    have followed the drainage of the country. At Whisky Hill I\r\n    found the sulphate of iron, (Coquimbite) sulphate of copper,\r\n    (Cyanosite) and alum. The water of the shaft contains copper\r\n    enough to redden the iron tools. At Quail Hill considerable\r\n    masses of heavy spar are found, formed probably from the action\r\n    of soluble sulphates upon witherite. No gypsum was observed at\r\n    either locality.\r\n\r\n    The mineral species observed at Whisky Hill, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Metallic Gold.\r\n    Metallic Copper.\r\n    Metallic Silver.\r\n    Red Copper.\r\n    Malachite (Green Carbonate of Copper).\r\n    Azurite (Blue Carbonate of Copper).\r\n    Chrysocolla (Silicate of Copper).\r\n    Cyanosite (Blue Vitriol).\r\n    Copper Glance (Vitreous Copper).\r\n    Zinc blende.\r\n    Galena.\r\n    Iron pyrites.\r\n    Alum.\r\n    Coquimbite.\r\n    Heavy Spar.\r\n    Hematite (chiefly the earthy varieties).\r\n    Kaolin.\r\n    Lithomarge and various aluminous and magnesian silicates\r\n      resulting from the decomposition of the chloritic and\r\n      talcose rocks.\r\n\r\n    The list of species is about the same for the deposit at Quail\r\n    Hill.\r\n\r\n    The line of division between the ore-bearing ground in these\r\n    great ore channels, and the country rock is quite distinctly\r\n    seen on both the eastern and western outcrop at Quail Hill, and\r\n    on the western at Whisky Hill. At the former place it is a dark\r\n    bluish porphyritic rock, probably metamorphic, of a sandstone\r\n    or silicious sediment. The outcroppings resemble those of many\r\n    quartz veins, and I find the moss-covered portions of this\r\n    quartzose matter full of cavities, resulting from the decay of\r\n    pyrites, and yielding, by assay, three to five dollars to the\r\n    ton in bullion.\r\n\r\n    From all the evidence presented, we seem justified in regarding\r\n    these remarkable metallic deposits as segregated veins, holding\r\n    a pretty uniform and high tenor of gold and silver, associated\r\n    with and derived from the decomposition of extended masses\r\n    of metallic sulphurets and quartzose matter, and carrying\r\n    at times, ores of copper, the commercial value of which is,\r\n    however, entirely subordinate to that of the precious metals\r\n    which are found to characterize these veins or ore channels.\r\n\r\n    SAN FRANCISCO, April 15th, 1867.\r\n\r\nMr. Falkenau read a communication “On the Spirit of the Age and its\r\nInfluence in the Department of the Natural Sciences.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander exhibited specimens of the _Apocynum_ found in Round Valley,\r\non moist land subject to overflow. The Indians make extensive use of it\r\nfor fish-lines and other purposes. The specimens presented were collected\r\nby Mr. J. S.

(of largest) 2 mill., Lat. 1.5 mill.; Diam. 1 mill.\r\n\r\n    _Habitat_: Angel Island.\r\n\r\n    Of California species, it is most like _P. abditum_, but\r\n    differs in its sculpture, its less prominent beaks and its\r\n    more globular and equilateral form. Most specimens are covered\r\n    by an exceedingly persistent coat of jet black mud, making\r\n    examination of them very difficult; but some are perfectly\r\n    clean.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following note upon a recent\r\n\r\n\r\nExhibition of Parhelia.\r\n\r\n    On Wednesday, the 17th day of (April) last month, at about 5\r\n    o’clock in the afternoon, my attention was attracted towards\r\n    the heavens by an exhibition of the rather unusual phenomena\r\n    (unusual in this latitude) known as _Parhelia_.\r\n\r\n    The sky in the west at the time was somewhat cloudy, and the\r\n    atmosphere hazy. I was unable to determine the exact position\r\n    of the sun, but its altitude was approximately 22° above\r\n    the horizon; the diameter of the circle or halo was about\r\n    24°. A horizontal line, drawn through the sun and projected\r\n    sufficiently in a northerly and southerly direction to\r\n    intersect the halo, displayed at each point of intersection, a\r\n    _parhelion_ or mock sun of very considerable brilliancy, and\r\n    continued for upwards of half an hour.\r\n\r\n    A much more extensive display of these phenomena was witnessed\r\n    by me in the month of April, 1858, while residing near Boston,\r\n    Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n    The sun was not far from the zenith, surrounded by a single\r\n    broad halo, which latter was in turn inclosed by an outer\r\n    circle of many halos all intersecting with each other and with\r\n    the central halo—each of the numerous points of intersection\r\n    gemmed with a _parhelion_. So extensive was the display, owing\r\n    to the number of halos and the attendant _parhelia_, that the\r\n    whole heavens from the zenith to within apparently 30° of the\r\n    horizon, seemed covered with brilliant circles or rings, and\r\n    resplendent with numberless suns. The sky, at the time, was\r\n    obscured by a haze of considerable density, and a chilling wind\r\n    was blowing from the south.\r\n\r\nSome remarks followed upon sun and moon halos, during which Dr. Gibbons\r\ncombated the popular notion that halos about the moon were infallible\r\nsigns of rain. His observations proved that, in some seasons, these signs\r\ninvariably failed in California, and at the East; he thought no rule\r\ncould be established on the subject.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodyear presented the following paper in behalf of Professor\r\nSilliman:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of New Localities of Diamonds in California.\r\n\r\nBY B. SILLIMAN.\r\n\r\n    Every well-authenticated instance of the existence of the\r\n    diamond in the United States is of interest, since it serves\r\n    to enlarge our knowledge of the geographical and geological\r\n    distribution of this much esteemed gem.\r\n\r\n    I have the pleasure of exhibiting to the Academy four diamonds,\r\n    obtained from separate localities in this State. Three of them\r\n    are crystals, having the form of an icositetrahedron; the other\r\n    has been cut, and is set as a ring stone.\r\n\r\n    _The First Specimen_—Is from Forest Hill, in El Dorado County.\r\n    Its weight is 0.369 gramme, or 5.673 grains—equal to rather\r\n    less than 1½ carats. Its color is good, but it has a small\r\n    cavity and discoloration on one of the solid angles, and it is\r\n    less symmetrical than the second specimen. This crystal was\r\n    found at a great depth from the surface in a tunnel run into\r\n    the auriferous gravel at Forest Hill. I procured this stone\r\n    from Mr. Tucker, the well-known jeweler.\r\n\r\n    _The Second Specimen_—Is from French Corral, in Nevada County.\r\n    It weighs 0.3375 grammes, or 5.114 grains—equal to about 1⅓\r\n    carats. Its form is symmetrical, color slightly yellowish.\r\n    Its lustre has been dimmed slightly by having been subjected\r\n    to a red heat as a test of its authenticity. The _auto da fé_\r\n    is hardly the test a chemist would select for pure carbon!\r\n    It is remarkably destitute of flaws. This crystal was washed\r\n    out from the cement in the deep gravel washings for gold at\r\n    French Corral, and was found in the sluice boxes. It belongs to\r\n    Mr. Egbert Judson, of San Francisco, from whom I derive this\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n    _The Third Specimen_—Is smaller and less perfect than either\r\n    of the preceding. It was found at Fiddletown, in Amador\r\n    County. It weighs 0.2345 gramme, or 3.619 grains—a little less\r\n    than one carat. This crystal is distorted, and has several\r\n    reëntering angles and cavities. Mr. M. W. Belshaw, to whom it\r\n    belongs, informs me that since 1855, five diamonds have, to his\r\n    knowledge, been found at Fiddletown, where he then resided;\r\n    none of them weighing much over one carat. All these specimens\r\n    were found in a gray cemented gravel underlying a stratum of\r\n    “lava” or compact volcanic ashes, and were found in searching\r\n    for gold.\r\n\r\n    _The Fourth Specimen_—Is from Cherokee Flat, in Butte County,\r\n    and has been cut and set in a ring. Mr. Geo. E. Smith, of 605\r\n    Montgomery Street, San Francisco, who is an expert in diamonds\r\n    and owns the specimen exhibited, informs me that he has seen\r\n    fifteen crystals from this locality, and has authentic advices\r\n    of at least forty, all of which have been found in deep gravel\r\n    washings, and are believed to come from a stratum of about\r\n    three feet thick, forming part of a mass of twenty-five to\r\n    fifty feet of superincumbent material. When this special\r\n    stratum of sandy materials is washed, the diamonds have been\r\n    found. I have taken steps to obtain an authentic crystal from\r\n    this place, which appears to be the most prolific locality of\r\n    the diamond yet observed in California.\r\n\r\n    In the first volume of the Geology of California, page 276, Mr.\r\n    Rémond is quoted as authority for the existence of diamonds at\r\n    Volcano. If this locality is distinct from that at Fiddletown,\r\n    near Volcano, we have at present, five authenticated localities\r\n    of the diamond in California, from which specimens have been\r\n    identified by mineralogists.\r\n\r\n    If a knowledge of the characteristics of this remarkable\r\n    species was more common among the miners who work in the deep\r\n    gravel diggings, no doubt this gem would be found to be more\r\n    abundant and in more numerous places than is now suspected.\r\n\r\n    SAN FRANCISCO, May 6th, 1867.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney, in reply to various inquiries made by members,\r\nremarked that there were probably some fifteen or twenty different\r\nlocalities in California where diamonds had been found; but these were\r\nall of small size, the largest which had come under his notice weighing\r\nonly 7¼ grains: this was found at French Corral, near San Juan North. It\r\nwas difficult to give any directions by which miners could infallibly\r\nrecognize the diamond when they happened to meet with this gem. The\r\ncrystalline form is very different from that of quartz, which is now,\r\nhowever, much less frequently mistaken for the diamond than it was\r\nformerly. Most of the crystals found in California, up to this time,\r\nhave been twenty-four sided. The fact that the faces of the crystals are\r\nusually curved instead of being plane surfaces, is also characteristic\r\nof the gem in question. The hardness and specific gravity are also\r\nsure guides; but miners rarely have the means of getting at either of\r\nthese characters accurately. It is commonly believed that the diamond\r\ncan be struck a heavy blow, on an anvil, without breaking; but this is\r\na mistake, resulting from confounding toughness with hardness. It is\r\nextremely doubtful whether washing the gravel for diamonds in California\r\nwould pay, under any circumstances; and it is believed that such washings\r\nare not remunerative anywhere, except when performed by slave or convict\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney read a paper on the geological position of coal. The\r\nobject of this paper was to show how completely the results of modern\r\ngeological explorations and discoveries had done away with the old idea\r\nthat valuable beds of coal are confined to any one member of the series\r\nof geological formations. The recent investigations of geologists in\r\nIndia, China, Australia, New Zealand, South America, and on the Pacific\r\ncoast of North America, were noticed and commented on. It was shown that\r\nwhile the important coal fields of Eastern Europe and the Eastern United\r\nStates are of palæozoic age, those of India, China and Australia, on\r\nthe other hand, belong to the mesozoic series chiefly, although there\r\nare important deposits even as recent as the cainozoic or tertiary.\r\nProfessor Whitney remarked on the distribution of the principal coal\r\nfields of the world into two great groups, on opposite sides of the\r\nglobe: one of these is of palæozoic, and the other of mesozoic age. He\r\nreferred particularly to the coal of the Pacific coast of North America,\r\nand gave a brief account of its geographical distribution and geological\r\nage, noticing particularly the fact that most of the valuable fields\r\nof that region belong to the cretaceous series, a geological formation\r\nwhich, in other parts of the world, has been found to be one of the most\r\nbarren in combustible materials. In conclusion, the importance of coal\r\ndiscoveries in the region between the Rocky Mountains and California to\r\nthe successful operation of the Pacific Railroad was explained, and the\r\nhope expressed that the geological expedition recently set on foot by\r\nthe General Government, at the head of which is Mr. King, late of the\r\nCalifornia Survey, might be the means of giving to the world reliable\r\ninformation in regard to the coal resources of that region, of which we\r\nnow know so little.\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney presented an elaborate paper “On the Natural System of the\r\nIgneous Rocks,” by Baron Richthofen; he advised its reference to the\r\nPublication Committee, and that it should be made one of the “Memoirs”\r\nwhich the Academy contemplates publishing. It was so referred, and the\r\ncommittee was instructed to report on the feasibility of commencing the\r\npublication of a series of quarto Memoirs.\r\n\r\nProf. Whitney exhibited a canine tooth, obtained from the deep gravel\r\ndeposits at Douglas Flat, near Murphy’s, in Calaveras County; it appears\r\nto be different from the teeth of any animal yet found on this coast,\r\neither living or fossil. He considered it as probably belonging to the\r\nhyæna; if so, this was the first notice of the occurrence of this animal\r\non the American continent.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper stated that Mr. Ridgeway, the zoölogist appointed to accompany\r\nthe Government exploration of Russian America, when on that coast, a few\r\nyears since, had found birds nearly identical with living species in\r\nAsia—a fact of much interest, since none of the same species are found\r\non the eastern coast of America. There is here another suggestion of the\r\nformer intimate relations between Western America and Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, MAY 20TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs.

Yale.\r\n\r\nMr. Gabb presented a communication on the “Geology of Lower California,”\r\nwhich was referred to the Publication Committee, and ordered printed as\r\none of the Memoirs of the Academy.\r\n\r\nMr. Gabb also communicated the following translation of part of a letter\r\nreceived by him from Sr. Don Antonio Raimondi, of Lima, Peru, with\r\nreference to some geological features of that country:\r\n\r\n    I have just received a letter from Professor Raimondi,\r\n    accompanying a very interesting collection of fossils, sent\r\n    through my lamented friend Mr. Rémond, but which I have\r\n    not yet received. After remarking that he had not time to\r\n    write a detailed account of the country to assist me in my\r\n    determinations of the geological ages, he gives the following\r\n    condensed but interesting description of the country, which I\r\n    have considered of sufficient value to warrant its immediate\r\n    publication. I translate this portion of the letter in full.\r\n\r\n    “Peru, or at least the great chain of the Cordillera which\r\n    divides the whole of America into two parts, comprises various\r\n    smaller chains, often very high, and here consisting of four,\r\n    nearly parallel. The principal of these are two, one of which\r\n    is the dividing line between the waters emptying into the\r\n    Pacific on one side, and the tributaries of the Amazon on the\r\n    other. This is what is properly called the Cordillera of the\r\n    Andes, or the Western Cordillera. The other chain is called the\r\n    Eastern Cordillera, and in some points is as elevated or even\r\n    surpasses in height the true Cordillera. In the southern part\r\n    of Peru, for example, it is entirely covered with perpetual\r\n    snow, and contains very elevated peaks, including, in that part\r\n    which is prolonged into Bolivia, the two colossi called Sorata,\r\n    or Illampu and Illimani. The Eastern Cordillera is of the\r\n    greater geological age, appearing to be entirely composed of\r\n    micaceous and talcose schists which have been metamorphosed by\r\n    the elevation of the granites, those which have also introduced\r\n    into these schists numerous veins of quartz, which in some\r\n    places are quite rich in gold. This elevated chain has been cut\r\n    very deeply by numerous rivers, which, taking their origin in\r\n    the Western Cordillera, traverse these immense formations of\r\n    schists and granite through narrow gorges, and unite to form\r\n    the large affluents of the Amazon.\r\n\r\n    “The Western Cordillera or true chain of the Andes is made\r\n    up in nearly the whole of its length of rocks of a much more\r\n    recent age. The principal formations are Cretaceous, Jurassic,\r\n    Lias and Trias. Another group of rocks, probably Carboniferous,\r\n    form the great basin of Lake Titicaca and a small spot on the\r\n    heights of Huanta. This Cordillera has been metamorphosed by\r\n    various eruptive rocks, the principal of which are porphyries\r\n    and diorites. These have introduced innumerable metalliferous\r\n    veins, rich in lead, copper and silver, and which have been\r\n    worked in many places.\r\n\r\n    “The volcanic rocks are strongly developed in Peru, especially\r\n    in the southern part, and have never been well studied.\r\n    According to my opinion, they once formed an extensive chain,\r\n    which, from its being composed of rocks easily disintegrated,\r\n    has been in great part destroyed by the action of water, so\r\n    that it is separated mostly by isolated hills; but from all\r\n    that I have been able to see, it must have formed at one\r\n    time an uninterrupted chain, as it appears in the central\r\n    part of Peru, at a little distance from the Pacific Ocean,\r\n    and afterwards it approaches almost insensibly the true\r\n    Cordilleras; so that, near Arequipa, it is more than twenty\r\n    leagues from the sea, but in following it to the south it nears\r\n    the Cordillera, extending to Cruzalia, in the broken country of\r\n    Moqueque and Tacna.\r\n\r\n    “Along the whole length of the coast, at a distance of one or\r\n    two leagues from the margin of the ocean, rises a small chain\r\n    of hills formed of granite, syenites and porphyries. This chain\r\n    is called ‘the Hills’ (Lomas) and contains in places scattered\r\n    spots of copper and a very little gold. On the same coast and\r\n    on the adjacent islands, sedimentary rocks are rare, though\r\n    they are nevertheless found at rare intervals. To the north,\r\n    sedimentary rocks extend from Tumbes to the south of Payta,\r\n    at the little cove of Tortugas, where there are many springs\r\n    of fresh water in a hardened claystone, alternating with\r\n    calcareous strata, which contain little seams of coal.\r\n\r\n    “From Secharra, to near Lima there is no sedimentary formation.\r\n    Near the port of Ancon, five leagues from Lima, in the island\r\n    of San Lorenzo, near Callao, and in Chorillo, three leagues\r\n    south of Lima, there are some stratified sandstones with a\r\n    very few fossils. These formations appear to us to be either\r\n    Jurassic or Liassic, but the study of the few fossils found\r\n    will determine better their age.\r\n\r\n    “Near Arica, and three leagues to the interior from Iquique,\r\n    where are the celebrated silver mines of Huantapaya, there have\r\n    also been noticed sedimentary rocks belonging to the Oolite and\r\n    Lias.\r\n\r\n    “In the elevated regions of the Cordillera are many traces\r\n    of stone coal which, unlike those in the formation about\r\n    Lake Titicaca, which I have already said belong to the true\r\n    Carboniferous, are all of more recent age, belonging to the\r\n    Jurassic and Liassic, as you will see by specimens from the\r\n    Springs of Pariatambo.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JULY 1ST, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: Native oysters, (_O. laticaudata_), also\r\nvarieties of _Purpura lactuca_, from Dr. Cooper; cone of _Pinus\r\ncontorta_, and branch and fruit of _Garrya elliptica_ from Port Trinidad;\r\neggs, cocoon, and animal of the California silkworm, (_Saturnia\r\nCalifornica_) by Dr. Lanszweert; _Aristolochia Californica_, from Angel\r\nIsland, by Mr. E. Brooks.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read a note from Professor W. P. Blake, stating that the\r\nfossil vertebræ which he exhibited at the meeting of November 18th, 1866,\r\nwere not those of saurians, as he had supposed, but of one of the larger\r\nforms of _Delphinidæ_.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns exhibited specimens of _Haliotis_ from Monterey, which\r\nwere evidently hybrid forms. Some remarks on the peculiarities and\r\ngeographical distribution of these mollusks were made by Messrs. Stearns\r\nand Cooper.\r\n\r\nDr. W. P. Gibbons made some additional remarks, supplementary to his\r\ncommunication, at a previous meeting, on the extinct redwood forests of\r\nthe Coast Ranges on the east side of the Bay of San Francisco. These\r\nremarks were followed by a discussion in which Messrs. Cooper, Kellogg,\r\nBolander, Veatch, and Stearns took part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, JULY 15TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-five members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. W. A. S. Nicholson, A. B. Stout, M.D., and C. W. McCormick, M.D.,\r\nwere elected Resident Members.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Cabinet: Specimen of asbestos, from L. Ransom, Esq.\r\n\r\nA collection of the shells of California, comprising in part the\r\nspecimens belonging to the Academy and which had been sent to Mr.\r\nCarpenter to be named, was exhibited by Dr. Cooper, by whom they had been\r\narranged for the Museum.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons made some remarks on the effects of the earthquake of\r\nOctober 6th, at Watsonville. He also spoke of the absence of worms from\r\nCalifornia fruit; and his remarks were followed by a discussion of the\r\nsubject, in which Drs. Cooper and Behr took part.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Stearns and Yale made some remarks on the ancient mines of the\r\nLake Superior region, and the race by which they had probably been worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 5TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-three members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: A specimen of a Sole, from Dr. Behr; four\r\nhundred specimens of Chilean Plants, from Mr. Bolander.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander gave an account of a recent visit made by himself to\r\nHumboldt County, and of his botanical observations in that region. The\r\nsubject of the geographical range of the forest trees on this coast was\r\ndiscussed by Messrs. Behr, Cooper, Yale, Bloomer, and Williamson.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons called attention to the meteoric display to be expected about\r\nthe tenth of the current month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, AUGUST 19TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: Fossils from Purissima, by Mr. Yale.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences,\r\nVol. I, 4to, Washington, 1866, and Annuals of the same for 1863, 1864,\r\n1865, and 1866.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the distribution of forest vegetation was discussed by\r\nMessrs. Bloomer and Cooper.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Gibbons made some remarks on the distribution of clear and cloudy\r\ndays throughout the year at San Francisco.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns exhibited a species of Pholas, and made some remarks on its\r\nmethods of boring. Dr. Cooper made some observations on the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, SEPTEMBER 2D, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty members present.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: Washington Astronomical Observations for 1864,\r\n4to, Washington, 1867. Report on Interoceanic Canals and Railroads\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 8vo, 1867. Speech of Hon.\r\nCharles Sumner on the Cession of Russian America.\r\n\r\nA letter from George Gibbs, Esq., transmitted through the Smithsonian,\r\nand urging the importance of collecting Indian crania on this coast, was\r\nread and commented on by Professor Whitney. He also exhibited a part of a\r\njaw of _Oreodon_, sent from Montana, by Mr. Keyes. The precise locality\r\nwhere it was said to have been found is about twenty miles northeast of\r\nBannock City, on Rattlesnake Creek, a branch of the Beaver Head. If there\r\nis no mistake in the locality, this is a very interesting occurrence,\r\nas the existence of these tertiary deposits characterized by bones of\r\nextinct mammalia (the White River beds) was not before known as far west,\r\nor at as high an elevation, as this.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney gave an account of his recent visit to Oregon,\r\nWashington Territory, Vancouver Island, and British Columbia. He spoke\r\nparticularly of the volcanoes of that region, and remarked that he had\r\nascertained, by rough trigonometrical measurements, that Mount Hood\r\nwas at least two thousand feet lower than Mount Shasta. He was about\r\nto ascend the first-named peak, in order to measure it barometrically;\r\nbut, on learning that Colonel Williamson was intending to do the same\r\nthing, during the present season, he proposed to await that gentleman’s\r\nmeasurement, the result of which could not fail to be accepted by\r\nall as eminently trustworthy. Professor Whitney remarked that his\r\njourney had been undertaken chiefly with a view to the study of the\r\n“surface-geology,” and that he would, on a future occasion, bring before\r\nthe Academy the results of his observations.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander made some remarks on the distribution of the redwoods and\r\nBig Trees in California, and exhibited a map, prepared at the office of\r\nthe Geological Survey, on which the extent and position of the regions\r\noccupied by these two species of Sequoia were shown by colors.\r\n\r\nDr. Ayres remarked on explosive sounds heard by him recently, during\r\nperfectly clear weather, in the vicinity of Borax Lake. They seemed to\r\ncome from beneath the surface, and recalled the subterranean explosions\r\nor noises mentioned in the Geology of California, Vol. I, as having been\r\nheard in the vicinity of Mount Helena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, SEPTEMBER 16TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwelve members present.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Cabinet: Twenty-eight mineralogical specimens from Dr.\r\nA. B. Stout; mineralogical specimens from Mount Hood, by Col. R. S.\r\nWilliamson.\r\n\r\nThe following paper was read:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Height of Mt. Hood.\r\n\r\nBY R. S. WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\n    Having recently formed a party and visited Mt. Hood for the\r\n    purpose of ascertaining its altitude, and as my determination\r\n    of its height is much less than previous parties have made it,\r\n    I think it proper to state somewhat in detail the nature of the\r\n    observations and the method I have pursued to arrive at the\r\n    number I adopt as a close approximation to its true height.\r\n\r\n    By the kindness of Gen. F. Steele, commanding the Department\r\n    of the Columbia, the necessary transportation was furnished\r\n    for the party, consisting of twelve persons, of whom my two\r\n    assistants, Lieut. W. H. Heuer, U. S. Engineers, and Mr. John\r\n    T. Best, were specially charged with the observations on the\r\n    summit. We left Portland, Oregon, August 20th, and on the\r\n    evening of the twenty-second arrived at a place on the slope of\r\n    the mountain, where we camped, and from which, the next day,\r\n    the ascent was made; seven of the party attempting to reach,\r\n    and six reaching, the summit, where they remained from one and\r\n    a-half to three hours.\r\n\r\n    From this camp to the summit and back ten hours were occupied,\r\n    starting at 7:30, A.M. The weather was clear and pleasant, and\r\n    had been so for several days before, and was so for several\r\n    days after.\r\n\r\n    The instruments used at all the stations were made by James\r\n    Green, of New York, were in perfect order, and most of them\r\n    new. They consisted of cistern barometers reading to two\r\n    thousandths of an inch, with attached thermometer, and open air\r\n    thermometer, (dry and wet) with large divisions, so that they\r\n    were easily read to tenths of a degree. All the barometers\r\n    had been adjusted to or compared with the standard, and all\r\n    agreed with it except the one at Astoria, which required a plus\r\n    correction of three thousandths of an inch.\r\n\r\n    The stations used were Astoria, Fort Vancouver, Fort Dalles,\r\n    camp on slope of Mt. Hood, and summit of Mt. Hood. Observations\r\n    had been taken for several years at Astoria for me by Louis\r\n    Wilson, U. S. Tidal Observer, at 7, A.M., 2, P.M., and 9, P.M.,\r\n    of every day, besides hourly observations for ten days or more\r\n    of each month. The cistern of this barometer is fifty-three\r\n    feet above mean low tide.\r\n\r\n    At Fort Vancouver observations of the same character were\r\n    commenced July 1st of this year, and are still going on. At\r\n    Fort Dalles similar observations have been made since July 10th.\r\n\r\n    The observations at the camp on the mountain slope were\r\n    commenced at 7, P.M., on August 22d, and continued hourly\r\n    (with few omissions) until 8, A.M., on the twenty-fourth.\r\n    The barometer at the summit was hung up at 1:30, P.M., and\r\n    allowed to stand a half hour in free air, but protected from\r\n    the direct rays of the sun. It was then adjusted and observed\r\n    at 2, P.M., 2:15, P.M., and 2:30, P.M., by Mr. Heuer and Mr.\r\n    Best, independently, and the two records as shown to me were\r\n    essentially the same. The mean reading of the barometer reduced\r\n    to 32° Fahrenheit, was 19,941 inches, with an _observed_ air\r\n    temperature of 41°.7, and wet bulb of 31°.3. The height of\r\n    Fort Vancouver above Astoria was computed from the mean of\r\n    the simultaneous observations taken during the months of July\r\n    and August. The height of the Dalles above Fort Vancouver was\r\n    deduced from the corresponding observations during twenty-one\r\n    days in July, together with those for the month of August. The\r\n    height of the camp on the mountain slope above Fort Vancouver,\r\n    and also the height of that camp above Fort Dalles, were then\r\n    separately computed from the daily means of the observations\r\n    taken at the three stations during August 23d. The difference\r\n    between the two should give the same result as by the direct\r\n    calculations between Fort Vancouver and Fort Dalles; but on\r\n    account of the short period observed on the mountain camp, a\r\n    plus correction of a little over eight feet was found necessary\r\n    to the estimated height of that camp to make the three results\r\n    agree.\r\n\r\n    It then remained only to calculate the height of the summit\r\n    of Mount Hood above the mountain camp. The mean of the three\r\n    observations of the barometer was assumed as the nearest\r\n    approximation we can have to the mean pressure for that day, as\r\n    the horary oscillation at the summit is unknown. With regard to\r\n    the mean temperature for that day, we have no positive data to\r\n    determine it. We cannot take the observed temperature, as the\r\n    observations were taken during the hottest part of the day.\r\n\r\n    By consulting the hourly observations of the thermometer at\r\n    the camp, I find the range there is between 63° and 43°.7,\r\n    or nearly 20°; and supposing nearly as great a range of\r\n    temperature on the summit, I have assumed the mean temperature\r\n    then for that day to be 34°.\r\n\r\n    The following is the final result of the computations:\r\n\r\n          STATIONS.               INTER. ALTS.   SEA LINE.\r\n\r\n    Sea level at mean low tide         —              0\r\n    Astoria                           53             53\r\n    Fort Vancouver                    79            132\r\n    Camp on mountain slope         5,820          5,952\r\n    Summit of Mount Hood           5,273         11,225\r\n\r\n    The computations are made with new tables which will shortly\r\n    be published, and which give results similar to Plantamour’s\r\n    formula, based on Regnault’s constants. They give results\r\n    somewhat higher than if Guyot’s tables had been used, the\r\n    latter giving the height of the summit, 11,185 feet.\r\n\r\n    On our return I took a single observation at what is called\r\n    “Government Camp,” about four miles below the camp on the\r\n    mountain slope, and another at a place called Stumpville, some\r\n    eight miles further on the road towards Portland. The results\r\n    give for the former place 3,864 feet, and for the latter 1,830\r\n    feet above the sea level.\r\n\r\n    The instruments used on the mountain have been returned in\r\n    excellent order, and compared with the one at Fort Vancouver\r\n    with most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n    It may be asked: Why is it that the results here given differ\r\n    so widely from some previous estimates? Mount Hood is said to\r\n    be, by Mitchell’s School Atlas, 18,361 feet, and the Rev. Geo.\r\n    H. Atkinson with a party, ascended to the summit in August of\r\n    last year, boiled water with a spirit-lamp, found that the\r\n    thermometer read 180°, and therefore concludes the mountain\r\n    is 17,600 feet, and Government Camp 4,400 feet above the sea.\r\n    The reason is, that the instruments used are unreliable,\r\n    and this method of computing the altitude defective. With a\r\n    boiling point apparatus (or thermo-barometer as it is called)\r\n    of the most approved kind, the results by boiling water are\r\n    far inferior to those by the cistern barometer; but if the\r\n    observations are made with a common thermometer, with small\r\n    spaces for degrees, as was the case in this instance, and the\r\n    instrument not protected from drafts of air, the results are\r\n    utterly unreliable, and therefore worse than worthless.\r\n\r\n    Apart from the observations here described, there are other\r\n    evidences to show that the determination of the height of this\r\n    mountain here given is not underestimated. Col. B. C. Smith,\r\n    one of our party who reached the summit, had this year ascended\r\n    Mount Shasta, a mountain measured by Prof. Whitney to be 14,440\r\n    feet. The Colonel states that he feels confident, from the\r\n    comparative ease with which he ascended Mount Hood, that it is\r\n    of much less altitude than Mount Shasta.\r\n\r\n    On Mount Hood butterflies were found within a thousand feet\r\n    of the summit. Finally, Prof. Whitney and others, from rough\r\n    triangulations, have estimated it be about 12,000 feet.\r\n\r\n    It is to be hoped that other parties with good instruments\r\n    will take further observations on this mountain. As the height\r\n    of Fort Vancouver and Fort Dalles are known, and as these are\r\n    now permanent meteorological stations, further observations on\r\n    Mount Hood can be referred to one of these stations as a base,\r\n    and good results obtained.\r\n\r\n    While another set of such observations may produce slightly\r\n    different results, I think they will not differ one hundred\r\n    feet from the estimate here given.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons exhibited a specimen of _Euphorbia lathyris_, and remarked\r\nupon its distinguishing characters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, OCTOBER 7TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nDr. J.

The following are some extracts\r\nfrom these letters:\r\n\r\n    “I have traveled on snow shoes, with the thermometer from 8°\r\n    to 40° below zero, about four hundred miles. I have paddled\r\n    in open canoes up stream six hundred and fifty miles, and\r\n    down 1,300 miles. I have obtained 4,550 specimens, including\r\n    a set of the rocks from Fort Youkon to the sea, sufficient to\r\n    determine the geological formations for 1,300 miles. The only\r\n    fossiliferous beds are on the Youkon, and they extend about\r\n    sixty miles. They are brown sandstones, containing bivalve\r\n    mollusca and vegetable remains. There is a small seam of coal\r\n    thirty miles below the bend, and thin shale above and below.\r\n    The coal is of good quality; but there is so little of it that\r\n    it is worthless. These are the only fossiliferous strata I have\r\n    thus far found. The rocks above and below are all azoic and\r\n    nonstratified, excepting a little hard blue or black slate.\r\n    Granite, and especially mica, are very rare. I found a pebble\r\n    containing the well known fossils of the Niagara limestone on\r\n    the beach near Fort Youkon. Fossil wood and bones and teeth of\r\n    _Elephas_ and _Ovibos moschatus_ are common over the country.\r\n    There is a broad patch of volcanic eruptive rock on the river\r\n    near the lower bend, and it extends to the sea. The islands\r\n    of St. Michael and Stuart are formed of it, and it is roughly\r\n    columnar on the former near the Fort.”\r\n\r\n    “I have looked carefully for glacial traces, and so far have\r\n    found absolutely none.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dall adds that it is his intention to spend another year in Russian\r\nAmerica, working at his own expense, in order to finish the explorations\r\ncommenced by himself, and which the failure of the Telegraph Company\r\nrendered it impossible for him to continue officially.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper and Professor Whitney discussed the question whether the\r\nvolcanoes of Oregon and Washington Territory were to be classed as\r\nactive. The evidence on this point seemed very conflicting, so far as\r\nshowers of ashes are concerned. There is no doubt, however, of the\r\nexistence of solfataric action on Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and\r\nprobably on Rainier and Baker.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited some photographs and stereographs, taken for\r\nthe Geological Survey by Mr. W. Harris, in the Upper Tuolumne Valley,\r\nnear Soda Springs, Mount Dana, Mount Hoffmann, and Mount Lyell. He also\r\npresented the following account of a remarkable portion of the Tuolumne\r\nValley, which forms almost an exact counterpart of the Yosemite. It is by\r\nMr. Hoffmann, the head of a party of the Geological Survey, by which it\r\nwas explored last summer:\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on Hetch-Hetchy Valley.\r\n\r\nBY C. F. HOFFMANN.\r\n\r\n    Tuolumne Valley, or Hetch-Hetchy, as it is called by the\r\n    Indians (the meaning of this word I was unable to ascertain) is\r\n    situated on Tuolumne River about fifteen miles in a straight\r\n    line below Tuolumne Meadows and Soda Springs, and about twelve\r\n    miles north of Yosemite Valley. Its elevation above the sea is\r\n    from 3,800 to 3,900 feet, a little less than that of Yosemite.\r\n    The valley is three miles long running nearly east and west,\r\n    with but little fall in this distance. Near its center it is\r\n    cut in two by a low spur of shelving granite coming from the\r\n    south. The lower part forms a large open meadow with excellent\r\n    grass, one mile in length, and gradually increasing from ten\r\n    chains to a little over half a mile in width, and only timbered\r\n    along the edges. The lower part of this meadow terminates in\r\n    a very narrow cañon, the hills sloping down to the river at\r\n    an angle of from 40° to 60°, only leaving a channel from six\r\n    to ten feet wide; the river in the valley having an average\r\n    width of about fifty feet. This is the principal cause of the\r\n    overflow in spring time of the lower part of the valley, and\r\n    probably also has given rise to the report of there being a\r\n    large lake in the valley. Below this cañon is another small\r\n    meadow, with a pond. The upper part of Hetch-Hetchy, east of\r\n    the granite spur, forms a meadow one and three-fourths miles\r\n    in length, varying from ten to thirty chains in width, well\r\n    timbered and affording good grazing. The scenery resembles very\r\n    much that of the Yosemite, although the bluffs are not as high,\r\n    nor do they extend as far. On the north side of the valley,\r\n    opposite the granite spur we first have a perpendicular bluff,\r\n    the top of which is 1,800 feet above the valley; the talus at\r\n    the base is about five hundred feet above the valley, leaving a\r\n    precipice of about 1,300 feet. In the spring when the snows are\r\n    melting a large creek precipitates itself over the western part\r\n    of this bluff. I was told that this fall is one of the grandest\r\n    features of the valley, sending its spray all over its lower\r\n    portion. It was dry, however, at the time of my visit. The\r\n    fall is 1,000 feet perpendicular, after which it strikes the\r\n    debris and loses itself among the rocks. About thirty chains\r\n    further east we come to the Hetch-Hetchy fall; its height above\r\n    the valley is 1,700 feet. This fall is not perpendicular,\r\n    although it appears so from the front, as may be seen from the\r\n    photograph by Mr. Harris. It falls in a series of cascades at\r\n    an angle of about 70°. At the time of my visit the volume of\r\n    water was much greater than that of Yosemite fall, and I was\r\n    told that in the spring its roarings can be heard for miles.\r\n\r\n    Still further east we have two peaks, shaped very much like\r\n    “The Three Brothers,” in the Yosemite. Their base forms a\r\n    large, naked and sloping granite wall on the north side of the\r\n    valley, broken by two timbered shelves, which run horizontally\r\n    the whole length of the wall. Up to the lower shelf or bend,\r\n    about eight hundred feet high, the wall, which slopes at an\r\n    angle of from 45° to 70°, is polished by glaciers, and probably\r\n    these markings extend still higher up, as on entering the\r\n    valley the trail followed back of and along a moraine for\r\n    several miles, the height of which was about 1,200 feet above\r\n    the valley. The same polish shows itself in places all along\r\n    the bluffs on both sides, and particularly fine on the granite\r\n    spur crossing the valley. There is no doubt that the largest\r\n    branch of the great glacier which originated near Mt. Dana and\r\n    Mount Lyell, made its way by Soda Springs to this valley. A\r\n    singular feature of this valley is the total absence of talus\r\n    or debris at the base of the bluffs, excepting at one place in\r\n    front of the falls. Another remarkable rock, corresponding with\r\n    Cathedral Rock in the Yosemite, stands on the south side of\r\n    the valley, directly opposite Hetch-Hetchy fall; its height is\r\n    2,270 feet above the valley. The photograph by Mr. Harris will\r\n    give some idea of this rock.\r\n\r\n    At the upper end of the valley the river forks, one branch,\r\n    nearly as large as the main river, coming from near Castle\r\n    Peak, the main river itself from Soda Springs. About half a\r\n    mile up the main cañon, the river forms some cascades, the\r\n    highest being about thirty feet.\r\n\r\n    The valley was first visited, in 1850, by Mr. Joseph Screech, a\r\n    mountaineer of this region, who found it occupied by Indians.\r\n    This gentleman informed me that, up to a very recent date, this\r\n    valley was disputed ground between the Pah Utah Indians from\r\n    the eastern slope and the Big Creek Indians from the western\r\n    slope of the Sierras; they had several fights, in which the\r\n    Pah Utahs proved victorious. The latter still visit the valley\r\n    every fall to gather acorns, which abound in this locality.\r\n    Here I may also mention that the Indians speak of a lake of\r\n    very salt water on their trail from here to Castle Peak. Mr.\r\n    Screech also informed me of the existence of a fall, about a\r\n    hundred feet high, on the Tuolumne River, about four miles\r\n    below this valley, and which prevents fish from coming up any\r\n    higher. The climate is said to be milder in winter than that of\r\n    the Yosemite Valley, as is also indicated by a larger number\r\n    of oaks and a great number of _Pinus Sabiniana_. The principal\r\n    tree of the valley is _Pinus ponderosa_; besides this we have\r\n    _P. Sabiniana_, Cedar, _Q. Sonomensis_, _Q. crassipocula_; also\r\n    poplar and cottonwood.\r\n\r\n    The valley can be reached easily from Big Oak Flat by taking\r\n    the regular Yosemite trail, by Sprague’s Ranch and Big Flume,\r\n    as far as Mr. Hardin’s fence, between south and middle fork of\r\n    Tuolumne River, about eighteen miles from Big Oak Flat. Here\r\n    the trail turns off to the left, going to Wade’s Meadows or\r\n    Big Meadows, sometimes called Reservoir Meadows, the distance\r\n    being about seven miles. From Wade’s Ranch the trail crosses\r\n    the middle fork of Tuolumne and goes to the Hog Ranch, five\r\n    miles; thence up divide between the middle fork and main river,\r\n    about two miles, to another little ranch called “The Cañon.”\r\n    From here the trail winds down through rocks for six miles to\r\n    Tuolumne Cañon. This trail is well blazed, and was made by\r\n    Mr. Screech and others, for the purpose of driving sheep and\r\n    cattle to the valley. The whole distance from Big Oak Flat is\r\n    thirty-eight miles.\r\n\r\n    Another trail equally good, but a little longer, leaves the\r\n    Yosemite trail about half a mile beyond the crossing of the\r\n    south fork, thence crosses the middle fork within about one and\r\n    a half miles of the south fork crossing, and follows up the\r\n    divide between the middle fork and the main river, joining the\r\n    first-named trail at the Hog Ranch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOVEMBER 4TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty members present.\r\n\r\nGeorge C.

Blake read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Organs of Copulation in the Male of the Embiotocoid Fishes.\r\n\r\nBY JAMES BLAKE, M.D., F.R.C.S.\r\n\r\n    Some months since I presented a communication to the Academy\r\n    pointing out the manner in which the fœtus of the embiotocoid\r\n    fishes was nourished whilst it was being developed within\r\n    the ovisac. (See p. 314.) I there stated that the ingress of\r\n    water into the ovisac would not take place at all freely, as\r\n    the organ communicated with the surface by a narrow canal\r\n    surrounded by muscular fibres. This structure of the oviduct\r\n    would evidently oppose an obstacle to the entrance of the semen\r\n    into the ovisac for the purpose of impregnation, unless some\r\n    means exist by which the ventral surfaces of the fish can be\r\n    maintained in contact during the act of copulation, as the\r\n    penis consists of a slightly developed tubercle which cannot\r\n    penetrate for any distance into the oviduct. From the direction\r\n    of the orifices of the penis and oviduct it is evident that\r\n    anything like a perfect contact of these organs can only be\r\n    maintained whilst the fishes are in a reversed position, so\r\n    that the head of one fish is towards the tail of the other. In\r\n    order that contact may be maintained whilst in this position,\r\n    we find the caudal fin of the male fish furnished with certain\r\n    appendages which enable it to give a firm hold to the ventral\r\n    fins of the female, so that close contact of the ventral\r\n    surfaces can be maintained. These appendages are of two kinds.\r\n    In _Embiotoca_, _Damolichthys_ and some other genera, we find\r\n    a well developed mammary elevation situated near the anterior\r\n    part of the anal fin on both sides, terminating in front by\r\n    a teat-like process. In _Amphisticus_, _Holconotus_ and some\r\n    other genera, this mammary appendage is wanting; but its place\r\n    is supplied by a bony transverse plate with serrated edges,\r\n    inserted in the fin some distance farther back and parallel to\r\n    the fin rays. In addition to these plates there are also found\r\n    cartilaginous ridges with roughened borders, placed in front of\r\n    the plates, and running parallel with the edge of the fin. I\r\n    think there can be no doubt but that these fin appendages serve\r\n    the purpose I have assigned to them, for on placing the fish\r\n    in the reversed position, with the orifice of the oviduct and\r\n    penis in contact, it will be seen that they enable the ventral\r\n    fins of the female to secure a firm hold on the anal fin of the\r\n    male, so as to keep the fish in contact during the process of\r\n    copulation. At the season of copulation, the anterior surface\r\n    of the anal fin in the male becomes covered with a thick layer\r\n    of firm epithelium. As this commences at a short distance from\r\n    the ventral attachment of the fin, a well marked groove is\r\n    formed at the base of the fin, which affords an additional\r\n    hold for the ventral fin of the female. After the season of\r\n    copulation is over, and the testicles regain their quiescent\r\n    state, this epithelium almost disappears. At the same time the\r\n    mammary sack diminishes very much in size, so that when the\r\n    testicles are reduced to their smallest size, hardly a trace of\r\n    the sack remains. One or the other of these forms of appendages\r\n    have been found on the anal fin of the male in all the species\r\n    of embiotocoid fishes I have examined.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns exhibited some fossils collected by Mr. Schmidt near Orleans\r\nBar, Klamath County.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney exhibited some peculiar ores from Nevada and Mexico.\r\nThose from Nevada were antimoniate of lead, containing considerable\r\nsilver. This occurs in Humboldt County, and in sufficiently large\r\nquantities to be mined and smelted, with success as is stated, the value\r\nof the silver being about $100 per ton. The Mexican ore is a pure oxide\r\nof antimony, which will be more fully described hereafter. It occurs in\r\nseveral mines in the northern provinces.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney made some remarks on the mineral species occurring in\r\nCalifornia and on the Pacific Coast of America in general. The following\r\nis an abstract of these remarks:\r\n\r\n    He stated that the number of minerals occurring in California,\r\n    and on the Pacific coast in general, taking the country from\r\n    Northern Mexico to British Columbia, was quite small in\r\n    proportion to the area of the region. Especially among the\r\n    silicates is there a great deficiency in species, and very\r\n    few of those which do occur are found of sufficiently well\r\n    crystallized form to be valuable as cabinet specimens.\r\n\r\n    The total number of species (following the fourth edition of\r\n    Dana’s Mineralogy for names, etc.) believed to exist on the\r\n    Pacific coast, including Northern Mexico, Arizona, California,\r\n    Nevada and Oregon, is one hundred and ten, of which, however,\r\n    thirteen are somewhat doubtful. Of the one hundred and ten,\r\n    there are eighty-nine which occur in California. Some of the\r\n    mineral species most common in other parts of the world, and\r\n    especially in mining regions, are either entirely unknown here,\r\n    or else exceedingly rare. Thus _barytes_, which is so abundant\r\n    a veinstone in England and Germany, is almost unknown in the\r\n    Sierra Nevada, having been only found in one or two localities,\r\n    and there in small quantity. Fluor is entirely wanting in the\r\n    Sierra Nevada, although found in some quantity in Arizona and\r\n    Nevada. Not a trace of this elsewhere so common mineral has\r\n    been found, so far as known, in California.\r\n\r\n    Among the silicates most universally diffused, but which are\r\n    up to this time entirely unknown in California, the following\r\n    may be mentioned as some of the most prominent: beryl, topaz,\r\n    zircon, Wollastonite, scapolite, spodumene, Allanite, iolite,\r\n    staurotide, kyanite, spinel, nepheline, datholite and all the\r\n    zeolites, in other countries so abundant where volcanic rocks\r\n    occur. Not a well defined specimen of a zeolite has yet been\r\n    found within the borders of California.\r\n\r\n    Another curious fact in the mineralogy of California is the\r\n    occurrence of some mineral species which are common as ores in\r\n    other mining countries, and which in California, or at least\r\n    in the mining region of the Sierra Nevada, are disseminated\r\n    through a great number of localities, but nowhere exist in\r\n    workable quantity. Galena and blende may be particularly\r\n    referred to as occurring in this way. There is hardly a\r\n    gold-bearing vein in the Sierra which has not some galena\r\n    and blende in fine particles in the veinstone; but not a\r\n    locality is known where the quantity of either of these ores\r\n    is anything like sufficient to justify mining, even were the\r\n    other conditions as favorable as in the Eastern States or in\r\n    Europe. Galena occurs in considerable quantity in the extreme\r\n    south-eastern portion of the State, or just over the borders,\r\n    in Arizona and Nevada; but no considerable deposit of zinc\r\n    blende has yet been made known anywhere in the Pacific States\r\n    or Territories; nor is any other ore of zinc known to occur in\r\n    workable quantity on this coast.\r\n\r\n    The mineral region with which ours most nearly agrees, in the\r\n    character of its ores and mineral substances, is that of the\r\n    South American Andes, especially of Chile. In Mr. David Forbes’\r\n    recent catalogue of the Chilean minerals, there are about two\r\n    hundred species enumerated, of which about sixty have hitherto\r\n    been discovered in California and the other Pacific States and\r\n    Territories. The Chilean mineral list, like that of California,\r\n    is remarkable for the absence of many of the almost universally\r\n    distributed silicates mentioned above as wanting in the Pacific\r\n    States, namely: beryl, topaz, zircon, Wollastonite, Allanite,\r\n    iolite, staurotide, kyanite, spodumene, spinel and datholite.\r\n    Many other silicates, abundantly distributed throughout other\r\n    portions of the world, might be mentioned as entirely wanting\r\n    along the whole Pacific Coast. Several of the more common\r\n    zeolites are found in the Chilean list, which are wanting in\r\n    California; while several others are equally wanting in both\r\n    countries. Among the common zeolites found in Chile which\r\n    have not yet been discovered in California are Prehnite,\r\n    stilbite, Laumontite and scolecite; while analcime, harmotome,\r\n    Thomsonite, natrolite and Heulandite are wanting there as well\r\n    as here.\r\n\r\n    It is evident, from a comparison of the mineral lists of the\r\n    States situated along the Pacific Coast of North and South\r\n    America, that there has been a most remarkable resemblance\r\n    in the conditions which have influenced the formation and\r\n    segregation of the accidental minerals now found accompanying\r\n    the stratified and eruptive masses throughout the whole vast\r\n    extent of the regions in question. This is another of the facts\r\n    which go to show the unity of the Cordilleras of North and\r\n    South America as a geological result.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander stated that the absence of many mineral species from this\r\ncoast found its parallel in a similar absence of many botanical groups.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper did not think there was any poverty with respect to animal\r\nspecies on this coast, and suggested that the absence of certain groups\r\nof plants might be due to the absence of certain appropriate mineral\r\nconstituents from the soil.\r\n\r\nDr. Behr thought that the Californian lepidoptera more nearly conformed\r\nto European and Mexican types than to those of the Eastern States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, NOVEMBER 18TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-six members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. R. H. Stretch and Gustav Holland, M.D., were elected Resident\r\nMembers, and Mr. L. C. Schmidt of Eureka, Humboldt County, a\r\nCorresponding Member.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Cabinet: A specimen of Coral from Mr. Eckley.\r\n\r\nDonation to the Library: Mining Claims and Water Rights, 8vo, San\r\nFrancisco, 1867, by Gregory Yale.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney read the following communication, supplementary to the\r\none presented at the previous meeting.\r\n\r\n    The subject of the relation of the accidental minerals\r\n    occurring on the Pacific coast was brought forward by me at the\r\n    last meeting, and I wish now to add a few words in regard to\r\n    the elementary substances occurring in California, an inquiry\r\n    which will also afford us some interesting data for comparing\r\n    the geological and chemical conditions prevailing through the\r\n    great chain of the Cordilleras of North and South America.\r\n\r\n    I find on carefully tabulating the facts observed by the\r\n    Geological Survey, in regard to the mineral combinations\r\n    existing on the coast, that of the sixty-four elementary\r\n    substances existing in nature, so far as yet known to chemists,\r\n    there are only thirty-six which have been proven to occur in\r\n    California, in mineral combinations.\r\n\r\n    Those which are wanting here are the following: bromine,\r\n    glucinum, cadmium, cæsium, cerium, didymium, erbium, fluorine,\r\n    iodine, indium, lanthanum, lithium, niobium, norium, palladium,\r\n    ruthenium, rubidium, strontium, tantalum, terbium, thallium,\r\n    thorium, uranium, vanadium, bismuth, tungsten, yttrium,\r\n    zirconium (28.)\r\n\r\n    Of elementary substances occurring in the adjacent States,\r\n    and not yet detected in California, there are, so far as I\r\n    know, only three, namely: bismuth, fluorine and tungsten.\r\n    This would make twenty-three elements wanting on the Pacific\r\n    Coast of North America. Of these a few are extremely rare, in\r\n    general, and would hardly be expected to occur here. Among\r\n    these are didymium, erbium, indium, lanthanum, norium, thorium.\r\n    But there are others, the absence of which is indeed quite\r\n    surprising. Fluorine, for instance, is an element of extremely\r\n    wide distribution, and one which occurs in great quantity in\r\n    most mineral countries. Here it will probably hereafter be\r\n    detected in our micas, and perhaps in other combinations, and\r\n    also in mineral and sea water; but its most abundant source,\r\n    fluor-spar, seems entirely wanting in this State.\r\n\r\n    Bismuth is another element of common occurrence in various\r\n    combinations, but it has not yet been detected in California.\r\n    A few minute scales of a mineral that I determined to be\r\n    bismuth-silver, from the Twin Ophir mine, Nevada, is the only\r\n    authentic instance I know of thus far, of the occurrence of\r\n    this element on the Pacific coast. Tungsten, uranium and\r\n    vanadium, are tolerably widely disseminated; the latter,\r\n    however, less so than the former. No trace of either has\r\n    yet been found on this coast north of Mexico; of strontium,\r\n    zirconium, and glucinum, the same may be said. If we now\r\n    compare the distribution of the elements in the South American\r\n    Andes with that on this coast, we shall find some striking\r\n    points of resemblance; and to a large extent, either the\r\n    absence, or else the great rarity of several of the elementary\r\n    substances not seen in other mineral regions, is a fact which\r\n    holds good along the whole extent of the American Continent on\r\n    the Pacific side. Fluorine, in combination with calcium, is\r\n    almost as rare in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile, as on this coast.\r\n    Indeed, it was formerly supposed by Domeyko not to occur at\r\n    all in Chile, but recently one or two localities, where it is\r\n    found in small quantity, have been made known. Tungsten occurs\r\n    in Peru at one locality in the form of wolfram, and in Chile\r\n    in one or two localities, also in Lower California, but its\r\n    combinations are extremely rare along the whole coast. The same\r\n    may be said of uranium. Strontium and zirconium have not yet\r\n    been discovered in Chile or Peru, although the former occurs\r\n    in one locality in New Grenada, and glucinum has only recently\r\n    been found in Chile in very minute quantity in one locality. No\r\n    combination of lithium is yet known on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\n    Among the leading facts connected with the occurrence of\r\n    mineral substances and the elementary bodies on the Pacific\r\n    coast, and especially in the Cordilleras of North and South\r\n    America, the following may be mentioned as generally applicable\r\n    to the whole of the vast region extending from British Columbia\r\n    to Chile:\r\n\r\n    1st. The paucity of species considering the extent of the\r\n    region as compared with other parts of the world, and\r\n    especially with other mineral regions.\r\n\r\n    2d. The remarkable absence of the prominent silicates, and\r\n    especially of the zeolites.\r\n\r\n    3d. The absence of a large number of the elementary substances,\r\n    and the paucity of several others of very common occurrence in\r\n    other mineral regions.\r\n\r\n    4th. The very wide spread and abundant occurrence of the\r\n    precious metals, gold and silver, and the not uncommon\r\n    occurrence of platina.\r\n\r\n    5th. The great abundance of ores of copper, and the comparative\r\n    absence of tin, lead, and zinc.\r\n\r\n    6th. The similarity in the mineralized condition of the\r\n    silver—antimony and chlorine being prominent mineralizers of\r\n    this metal—while in Chile the rarer combinations of iodine,\r\n    bromine, and selenium occur, these latter being as yet unknown\r\n    north of Mexico.\r\n\r\n    7th. The absence or paucity as veinstone, or gangue, of one\r\n    of the most prominent minerals occurring as such in other\r\n    mineral regions, namely, fluor; to which it may be added, that\r\n    both calcite and barytes are extremely rare as veinstones in\r\n    California, and to judge from all the Mexican and Chilean\r\n    collections that I have seen, well crystallized specimens are\r\n    very rare in those countries.\r\n\r\n    8th. There is no elementary substance, and but few mineral\r\n    species peculiar to the Pacific coast, so far as yet\r\n    ascertained.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney remarked on the depression of Death Valley, the sink\r\nof the Amargosa River, below the level of the sea. Recently it has been\r\nrepeatedly stated in the newspapers that no such depression really\r\nexisted, and that, in point of fact, the valley in question was several\r\nthousand feet above the sea level, Mr. Gabb being cited as authority.\r\n\r\nThe valley visited by Mr. Gabb, however, was not, it appears, the real\r\nDeath Valley, but one to which that name was given by an explorer by\r\nmistake. The true Death Valley is the sink of the Amargosa, while the\r\none visited by Mr. Gabb is near the head of that river. The barometrical\r\nobservations on which the statement of the depression of the real Death\r\nValley is based were taken, in 1861, by a party of the California\r\nBoundary Survey. The observations were made with a barometer, which\r\nwas compared before and after being used, with a standard, by Colonel\r\nR. S. Williamson, by whom also the computations and reductions of the\r\nobservations were made; there was also a station barometer at the time\r\non the Colorado, at no great distance, and this instrument was in good\r\norder. Thus it will be seen that the conditions were, in most respects,\r\nexceptionably favorable for a correct measure of the altitude of the\r\nvalley, and it may be safely assumed that its depression below the sea\r\nlevel is not far from one hundred and seventy-five feet, as stated on\r\nColonel Williamson’s authority, in the Geology of California, Vol. I.\r\nTo secure a more reliable result, it would be necessary to have a long\r\nseries of observations taken there with a well-adjusted instrument, and\r\nit would be desirable also to have a station barometer on the Colorado,\r\nor at some other not too distant point. It will probably be a long time\r\nbefore these favorable conditions are secured; and, in the meantime, Col.\r\nWilliamson’s result must be received as a close approximation to the\r\nactual amount of the depression of this very remarkable locality.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolander, referring to a previous enumeration of pine species in\r\nCalifornia, submitted by him, stated that he must now reduce the number\r\nof true species by one, leaving the total at only fifteen. He also\r\nremarked upon the species of fir in this State, enumerating four only as\r\nbeing strongly marked. He showed the leaves and seeds of two species,\r\nand commented upon the mistake of Murray in asserting that there is a\r\nfifth species, which he calls _Picea magnifica_, but which is really\r\n_Picea amabilis_. Mr. Bolander thought the tendency to multiply species\r\nerroneously was attributable to a desire to make a market for seeds,\r\nthose of new species being always in demand at good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MEETING, NOVEMBER 27th, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis meeting was called for the purpose of hearing from Mr. George\r\nDavidson, Assistant U. S. Coast Survey, an account of his recent trip\r\nto Alaska, at the head of a party organized by Professor Peirce,\r\nSuperintendent U. S. Coast Survey, to make a partial scientific\r\nreconnoissance of that region. Mr. Davidson gave an interesting account\r\nof the operations of the party, and a synopsis of their observations.\r\nThese will be found at length in his official report, to be printed by\r\norder of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of Mr. Davidson’s remarks, the Academy passed a vote of\r\nthanks to Mr. Davidson and Professor Peirce, Superintendent of the Coast\r\nSurvey, for the opportunity which had thus been afforded of hearing the\r\nresults of an expedition of so much interest to the scientific world.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg, who accompanied the party as botanist, added some remarks on\r\nthe Flora of the northwestern coast of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 2D, 1867.\r\n\r\nPresident in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-five members present.\r\n\r\nMessrs. S. W. Holladay, Henry R. Goddard, and Henry K. Moore, were\r\nelected resident members.\r\n\r\nDonations to the Library: Bulletin de la Société Imperial des\r\nNaturalistes de Moscow, 8vo., Moscow, 1866.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman read the following notices:\r\n\r\n\r\nNote on three new Localities of Tellurium Minerals in California, and on\r\nsome Mineralogical Features of the Mother Vein.\r\n\r\nBY B. SILLIMAN.\r\n\r\n    (_a._) TELLURIUM MINERALS.—It is well known to mineralogists\r\n    and others that in the Melones Mine, on Carson Hill, there\r\n    occurs, in considerable abundance, a tellurium compound which\r\n    has been called Sylvanite by some mineralogists, but apparently\r\n    without sufficient authority. It occurs in one of the veins\r\n    on the Melones property, associated with Dolomite and quartz,\r\n    in what appears to be a gneissic rock; but the mine being\r\n    under water I am dependent on the specimens kindly furnished\r\n    me by the intelligent proprietor, Mr. G. K. STEVENOT, for my\r\n    knowledge of the gangue.\r\n\r\n    At the “Golden Rule” Mine, on the mother lode near Poverty\r\n    Hill, in Tuolumne County, I detected in August last the same\r\n    tellurium minerals which are found at Carson Hill in the\r\n    Melones. The veinstone here is an argillite, with thread-like\r\n    veins of quartz crossing the cleavages of the slate, and in\r\n    these _filons_ of quartz gold is seen in beautiful specimens.\r\n    It was in this association that I detected two or three small\r\n    groups of brilliant crystalline plates, identical in appearance\r\n    and physical characters with the Melones mineral, which\r\n    has been called Sylvanite, and affording the same blowpipe\r\n    reactions.\r\n\r\n    At the Rawhide Rancho, a mine near Jamestown, on the mother\r\n    lode, of which I have had occasion to make a careful study,\r\n    there occurs a deposit or shoot of very rich sulphides\r\n    containing copper, antimony, iron, arsenic, with gold, silver\r\n    and tellurium. This ore has in general a bronzy, blackish\r\n    appearance; shows often free gold in scales of a blackish\r\n    yellow color, and appears to be a kind of fahlerz, or\r\n    gray-copper ore, the value of which in silver and gold rises\r\n    to one thousand dollars per ton, (2,000 lbs.) or even higher.\r\n    Associated with this ore are brilliant sectile, flexible scales\r\n    of the same tellurium compound which occurs at Stanislaus and\r\n    Golden Rule, but in the Rawhide Mine intimately blended with\r\n    the blackish sulphides before-named—occasionally in nests\r\n    or small bunches with metallic gold. The blowpipe readily\r\n    detects in this ore antimony, arsenic, tellurium, copper,\r\n    iron, manganese, lime, magnesia, chromium, aluminum, gold and\r\n    silver. It is only in portions containing dolomite and the\r\n    peculiar greenish mineral, so characteristic of the mother\r\n    lode, that lime, magnesia, alumina, and chromium are detected.\r\n    In portions of the fahlerz-like mineral which appear nearly\r\n    pure, the blowpipe detects only antimony, arsenic, copper,\r\n    iron, and manganese.\r\n\r\n    Having transmitted characteristic specimens of these ores,\r\n    with other interesting California species, to Professors Dana\r\n    and Brush, at New Haven, these mineralogists inform me, by\r\n    letter just received, that the tellurids above-named appear\r\n    to be referable to a new species hitherto undescribed, and\r\n    Prof. Brush proposes to undertake an analysis of it upon the\r\n    specimens transmitted by me, which are barely sufficient for\r\n    the purpose. It is a tellurid of silver and gold, containing\r\n    more silver than gold. Associated with it is a white cleavable\r\n    mineral which Prof. Brush thinks may prove to be native\r\n    tellurium; this is in the Melones and Golden Rule specimens.\r\n\r\n    _Hessite._ I obtained from the Reist Mine, on the northeasterly\r\n    end of Whisky Hill, Tuolumne County, a very small crystal\r\n    corresponding in its physical characters to the extremely rare\r\n    telluric silver, known to mineralogists as _Hessite_. It occurs\r\n    in the auriferous slates to the east of the main vein; the\r\n    slates being opened here for a width of seventy-five feet as\r\n    an open cut. My attention was called to the existence of this\r\n    species at the Reist Mine by Mr. D. T. Hughes, of Tuolumne\r\n    County, who informed me that there was an interesting mineral\r\n    species there containing, as he believed, tellurium, and that\r\n    masses of it, half an ounce in weight, had been obtained some\r\n    years since. Unfortunately these specimens fell into ignorant\r\n    hands, and were destroyed in idle attempts to determine the\r\n    nature of the substance. On visiting the locality, which is\r\n    within one mile of the Rawhide Rancho, and on the opposite side\r\n    of Table Mountain, I found that the proprietor was exploring\r\n    in a different part of the open cut from that where this\r\n    species was found, the place being under water. Fortunately\r\n    in a collection of minerals from Whisky Hill, formed by Mr.\r\n    Williams, one of the proprietors, and preserved in his house\r\n    there, I was able to detect one small mass of the Hessite which\r\n    Mr. Williams divided with me. This Mr. Hughes recognized as\r\n    identical with the larger masses he had obtained at this mine\r\n    some years since.\r\n\r\n    Prof. Bush, in his letter to Prof. Silliman, of October 29th,\r\n    recognizes this species as Hessite. The specimen was associated\r\n    with native gold which had been amalgamated and heated, but the\r\n    constitution of the Hessite did not seem to be affected thereby.\r\n\r\n    “_Tellurid of Silver_” is mentioned by Blake, in his list of\r\n    California species, as found by him near Georgetown, in El\r\n    Dorado County, in 1854, washed from the gold drift, but the\r\n    parent vein had never been found.—Ross Browne’s Report, 1867,\r\n    p. 209.\r\n\r\n    It appears therefore, from the present state of our knowledge,\r\n    that a compound of gold and silver tellurium belonging probably\r\n    to a new species has been detected in three localities upon\r\n    the mother vein, and associated with it in two of these,\r\n    probably also native tellurium; and that Hessite (the tellurid\r\n    of silver) has been found in place in one locality and in\r\n    the drift in another. I have also detected the foliated\r\n    tellurium in extremely minute quantity in one of the mines\r\n    at Angels, and I mentioned in a publication, in 1864, its\r\n    probable occurrence among the ores of the Josephine and Pine\r\n    Tree Mines of Mariposa. A careful scrutiny will probably\r\n    detect those compounds of tellurium at other points when the\r\n    mother vein is opened, as at Blue Gulch, Quartz Mountain, and\r\n    Whisky Hill. I have already recognized the blackish antimonial\r\n    copper sulphides at the App Mine and Silver’s Mine, and in the\r\n    croppings on the surface of Whisky Hill. Indeed it may not\r\n    be too much to state that these ores appear to be somewhat\r\n    characteristic of those portions of the mother vein occurring\r\n    south of Angels, and especially wherever it is inclosed in\r\n    magnesian rocks.\r\n\r\n    Genth has named a species _Melonite_, from Melones Mine, which\r\n    he says is a tellurid of nickel. I have not been able to\r\n    recognize this compound among those ores of the Melones, which\r\n    I have seen.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) SOME MINERALOGICAL FEATURES OF THE MOTHER VEIN.—From the\r\n    opportunity I have had of studying the mother vein, I arrive at\r\n    the general conclusion that its mineralogical characteristics\r\n    vary greatly with the chemical constitution of the rocks which\r\n    inclose it. Wherever the serpentine or talcose and calcareous\r\n    rocks from the inclosing walls, or are near it, the mineral\r\n    contents of the vein are essentially different from those\r\n    observed where the inclosing rocks are argillites, or syenites\r\n    and diorites.\r\n\r\n    These we find at Mariposa, in the Josephine and Pine Tree\r\n    Mines, at Peñon Blanco, Maxwell Creek, Blue Gulch, Quartz\r\n    Mountain, Silver’s, Whisky Hill, Rawhide, Chapavele Hill,\r\n    Carson Hill, Angels, and Placerville—at all which places I have\r\n    examined the mother lode with more or less care—a peculiar\r\n    light apple-green mineral, occurring in scales, associated with\r\n    iron pyrites in small and brilliant pentagonal dodecahedrons\r\n    and implanted in a gangue of dolomite mingled with quartz.\r\n    The dolomite is of the variety known as ankerite, and by its\r\n    decomposition, which seems hastened by the oxidation of the\r\n    associated pyrites, gives origin to those highly characteristic\r\n    masses of brown and reddish-yellow iron gossan which form the\r\n    characteristic feature of the outcroppings of those portions of\r\n    the mother vein just enumerated. These gossans always retain\r\n    the bright green mineral before alluded to unchanged, as also\r\n    cellular quartz which discloses in its rhombic cavities the\r\n    form of the decomposed crystals of dolomite or ankerite whose\r\n    removal has left the vacant spaces. Before decomposition this\r\n    triple carbonate of lime, magnesia, and iron is brilliantly\r\n    white, and its real chemical character would never be suspected.\r\n\r\n    The green mineral, so far as I can ascertain, has never been\r\n    described, although it has often been noticed. It has been\r\n    called by some, _nickel gymnite_, and I have once distinguished\r\n    it by this name in a mining report. But this is a misnomer\r\n    which I take this occasion to correct; nickel gymnite of Genth,\r\n    found at Texas, Penna., is a hydrous silicate of magnesia,\r\n    lime, and nickel. The species so characteristic of certain\r\n    portions of the mother vein is anhydrous, and contains no\r\n    nickel.\r\n\r\n    MARIPOSITE (Provisional Name). Before the blowpipe it yields\r\n    evidence of the presence of the protoxides of iron, lime,\r\n    magnesia, and potassium; of the sesquioxides of chromium and\r\n    aluminum with carbonic, silicic, and sulphuric acids. The\r\n    oxide of manganese and sulphuric acid exist only as traces.\r\n    The mineral is probably new, and must be referred to the\r\n    mica section of an hydrous silicate. Should it, on a careful\r\n    chemical examination, prove to be new, I would suggest the name\r\n    _Mariposite_ as an appropriate name for it, as it was on the\r\n    Mariposa estate that it first attracted my attention, and where\r\n    it exists in great abundance.\r\n\r\n    This species which is so characteristic of the mother vein, in\r\n    connection with magnesian or chloritic rocks, occurs nowhere\r\n    so far as I have observed in this vein when it is inclosed in\r\n    argillites or syenites.\r\n\r\n    Of sulphides occurring in the mother lode there are two classes\r\n    which deserve special mention, beside the ordinarily occurring\r\n    pyrites of iron and copper.\r\n\r\n    These are the (1) antimonial copper sulphides, and the (2)\r\n    antimonial lead sulphides; both are arsenical and are rich in\r\n    both gold and silver.\r\n\r\n    To the first class allusion has already been made in the former\r\n    part of this paper. Besides the Rawhide Mine, they are found\r\n    in most of the openings on Whisky Hill, in Tuolumne County, in\r\n    the Silver, App and Josephine, and Pine Tree Mines. The lively\r\n    stains of blue malachite, seen at Williams’ Mine, on Whisky\r\n    Hill, and occasionally elsewhere, are derived from atmospheric\r\n    decomposition of the antimonial copper sulphides. The blowpipe\r\n    detects the presence of iron, antimony, arsenic, copper,\r\n    sulphur, tellurium (in certain cases) sulphur, gold and silver.\r\n    The vein is so abundant as to give to the raw ore, in some\r\n    cases, magnetic properties; and the button from the blowpipe\r\n    assay becomes strongly magnetic.\r\n\r\n    The antimonial lead sulphides occur in considerable abundance\r\n    at the Trio Claims, on Whisky Hill. The appearance of this ore\r\n    recalls that of granular galena. The gold and silver value of\r\n    this ore is very high, but no portion of it can be saved by\r\n    the ordinary mechanical treatment with mercury. The blowpipe\r\n    detects the presence of antimony, lead, iron, arsenic, sulphur,\r\n    gold and silver. There is no trace of copper, and the quantity\r\n    of arsenic present is slight. The ore is therefore essentially\r\n    an antimonial lead sulphide, rich in gold and silver.\r\n\r\n    There is good reason to believe, that as this remarkable vein\r\n    becomes more thoroughly explored, it will disclose other new or\r\n    rare compounds containing gold, and that these already noticed\r\n    will be found to be more widely diffused when proper care is\r\n    applied to the study of the mineralogy of the lode.\r\n\r\n    In Amador County the mother lode is found in connection with\r\n    argillaceous slates and syenite. Thus at the Eureka Mine, of\r\n    Hayward, known as the Amador Mining Co., the vein has a soft,\r\n    black slate for its foot wall and a heavy, firm syenite or\r\n    greenstone (called _granite_ by the miners) for the hanging\r\n    wall. The mineralogy of the vein is extremely simple, being\r\n    in fact nothing more than iron and copper sulphurets, chiefly\r\n    the former, with rarely galena or blende. I sought in vain\r\n    for any of the species mentioned in the former part of this\r\n    paper. There are no magnesian minerals, and the _Mariposite_\r\n    is entirely absent. The other mines of that range, as far\r\n    as I examined them, all partake of the same simplicity in\r\n    mineralogical character. There can be but little doubt, as it\r\n    appears to me, that the inclosing rocks in each case exercise\r\n    an important influence on the mineral contents of the vein.\r\n\r\n    SAN FRANCISCO, December 2d, 1867.\r\n\r\nMr. Stearns read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nList of Shells collected at Bodega Bay, California, June, 1867.\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT E.

STEARNS.\r\n\r\n    In pursuance of the idea mentioned in my paper on the shells\r\n    of Baulines Bay, of examining the bays and coast to the north\r\n    of San Francisco, I made a brief trip to Bodega Bay in company\r\n    with my friend Dr. Newcomb, on the thirteenth of June, 1867.\r\n    Most of the species enumerated were collected within a very\r\n    limited area, between tide marks, at the extreme point of\r\n    Bodega Head, as the arm of land is called, which extending\r\n    in a southerly direction from the general line of the coast,\r\n    incloses what is known as Bodega Bay. The bay itself is, for\r\n    the greater part, left bare at low tide, and the flats then\r\n    exposed, composed of sandy mud, contain abundance of the common\r\n    bivalves of the coast, principally _Macoma_, (two species)\r\n    and _Tapes_, in all its varieties: _Saxidomus gracilis_ may\r\n    also be found here in considerable quantities, and is at\r\n    certain seasons dug by the Indians, together with the other\r\n    so called “clams.” At the spot where the principal portion of\r\n    this collection was made, the outcropping rock is a coarse\r\n    granite, upon which _Litorina planaxis_ is found in great\r\n    numbers. The limited time at my disposal, at the season when\r\n    the trip was made, was only sufficient to admit of a brief,\r\n    and therefore unsatisfactory reconnoissance; nevertheless, at\r\n    least seventeen species were detected which have not heretofore\r\n    been found (or reported) so far to the north. Many of these\r\n    species I failed to find at Baulines, and some of them have\r\n    not been reported north of the Bay of Monterey. At Baulines,\r\n    the rocks are principally shales, and contain many species of\r\n    pholads, which as will be seen by a glance at this list, if not\r\n    entirely absent, must be rare at Bodega; the various “nestlers”\r\n    which are found associated with the borers are also wanting;\r\n    _Haliotis rufescens_ is abundant upon the rocky islets off the\r\n    coast, but not even a fragment of _H. Cracherodii_ was met with.\r\n\r\n     1. Cryptomya Californica, Conr.\r\n     2. Schizothærus Nuttalli, Conr.\r\n     3. Entodesma saxicola, Baird.\r\n     4. Mytilimeria Nuttalli, Conr.\r\n     5.

The statement\r\nmade was in the main identical with that contained in the biennial\r\nletter of the State Geologist to the Governor, published by order of the\r\nLegislature then in session.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Gibbons exhibited a piece of pork erroneously supposed to contain\r\ntrichinæ; he believed the entozoa in question were really _Cysticerci_.\r\nThey have the appearance of soaked peas, and are not injurious when\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\nMr. R. L. Harris mentioned the fact that the railroad surveys conducted\r\nby himself, for connecting Vallejo and Sacramento, indicated that the\r\nlatter place was not so much above the sea level as had generally been\r\nassumed from barometrical observations, and he believed that the top of\r\nthe present levee at Sacramento was about twenty-one feet above mean high\r\ntide at Vallejo, instead of fifty-six, as previously supposed. If this\r\nwas true, then the lowlands in the vicinity of Sacramento were in fact,\r\nonly about one and a half feet above the sea level. The surveys of the\r\ncoming season would probably enable him to fix this important point with\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nDr. Gibbons suggested that if the Tule lands in the Sacramento and San\r\nJoaquin Valleys were permitted to undergo the natural processes of growth\r\nand decay, instead of being annually burned over, the land in question\r\nmight in time become sufficiently elevated to be inhabited.\r\n\r\nMr. Goodale, who had recently visited Russian America, exhibited a number\r\nof implements and weapons of the natives of that region, and gave an\r\naccount of their use. He also remarked on some of the topographical and\r\ngeological features of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULAR MEETING, DECEMBER 16TH, 1867.\r\n\r\nVice President Ransom in the Chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty-seven members present.\r\n\r\nThe following gentlemen were elected Resident Members: Messrs. William\r\nHamel, P. B. Cornwall, Horace D. Dunn and W. B.

A. GOODYEAR.\r\n\r\n    Having spent some time during the past summer in Copperopolis,\r\n    and the region lying west and northwest from it, I offer the\r\n    following observations respecting its topography and geology. I\r\n    will first notice the\r\n\r\n\r\n    TOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n    For a general description of the topography, etc., of Calaveras\r\n    County, including the main features of the region in question,\r\n    reference may be made to Prof. J. D. Whitney’s Report upon the\r\n    Geology of California, Vol. I, p. 253. In addition, however,\r\n    to what is there stated, I will say that Copperopolis lies at\r\n    the _southwestern_ base of Bear Mountain, the summits of which\r\n    rise to an altitude of something more than 2,000 feet above the\r\n    sea. The Gopher Hills, also mentioned in the report, form a\r\n    well defined and connected, though subordinate range, lying to\r\n    the southwest of, and nearly parallel with the general course\r\n    of Bear Mountain. This range forms a prominent feature in the\r\n    topography of the region for a distance of at least fifteen\r\n    or eighteen miles southeasterly from the Calaveras river. Its\r\n    summits are probably 1,400 feet above the sea, and the lowest\r\n    break or gap within the distance named is that through which\r\n    Rock Creek finds its way to the plains below. The valley or\r\n    depression between the Gopher Hills and Bear Mountain, whose\r\n    average width is four to six miles, has received the name of\r\n    Salt Spring Valley. Its general altitude is little less than\r\n    1,000 feet above the sea, that of the town of Copperopolis\r\n    being nine hundred feet according to H. P. Handy’s survey of a\r\n    railroad route from Copperopolis to Stockton. I should mention\r\n    that for several miles northwesterly from Copperopolis, Bear\r\n    Mountain has an outlier along its southwestern base, in the\r\n    form of a low but tolerably well marked hilly ridge, between\r\n    which and the base of the mountain is a narrow but continuous\r\n    valley; and it is in this valley that the copper-bearing\r\n    belt of Copperopolis is found. Southwest of this outlier,\r\n    and for a distance of three or four miles northwesterly from\r\n    Copperopolis, Salt Spring Valley consists mainly of a region\r\n    of low hills, traversed by a net-work of steep and narrow\r\n    gulches. Farther northwest the surface of the valley for three\r\n    or four miles is more uniform, and here we find the nearly\r\n    level area of “Tower’s Ranch,” and the gently sloping basin of\r\n    the “Salt Spring Valley reservoir.” Beyond this, the country\r\n    is again hilly to the Calaveras river. Southeast and south of\r\n    Copperopolis, the surface is everywhere hilly. The slope of the\r\n    Gopher Hills towards the southwest is rapid until we reach the\r\n    low rolling country which forms the border of the San Joaquin\r\n    Valley.\r\n\r\n    Black Creek debouches from Bear Mountain a mile or so southeast\r\n    of Copperopolis, and flows to the Stanislaus. Littlejohn’s\r\n    Creek takes its rise in the hilly regions of the valley west of\r\n    Copperopolis, and flowing southwesterly, finds its way through\r\n    the hills into Rock Creek. The latter rises in Bear Mountain,\r\n    five or six miles northwesterly from Copperopolis, and flowing\r\n    southwest across Salt Spring Valley, breaks through the Gopher\r\n    Hills, and continues its course through the lower country to\r\n    French Camp Slough, a branch of the San Joaquin. All these\r\n    creeks become dry in the summer, though in winter they often\r\n    carry very large volumes of water. At the point where Rock\r\n    Creek breaks through the Gopher Hills is the substantial dam of\r\n    the Salt Spring Valley Reservoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The strike and dip of the rocks are more or less variable;\r\n    but, so far as my observations extend in the region described,\r\n    they have everywhere the same general northwesterly trend\r\n    and high northeasterly dip which characterize so large a\r\n    portion of the gold-bearing slates of central California. The\r\n    strike is usually from N. 50° W. to N. 70° W., (magnetic) and\r\n    the dip from 50° northeast to vertical. I have seen no case\r\n    here of a decided southwesterly dip, nor of a low one to the\r\n    northeast. It is somewhat remarkable, by the way, that this\r\n    high northeasterly dip should be so general as it is in the\r\n    great mass of auriferous slates which forms the southwestern\r\n    flank of the Sierra Nevada. It is _towards_ the granite axis of\r\n    the chain, instead of _from_ it, as would seem more natural.\r\n    The causes of this are by no means as yet fully explained.\r\n    It is a circumstance, however, which would lose none of its\r\n    interest in the future, if, as certain facts mentioned in the\r\n    Geological Report, Vol. I, p. 286, might possibly seem to\r\n    indicate, further explorations should prove it to be in general\r\n    a great inversion of the strata—their upper portions having\r\n    been “forced back by immense pressure from above, producing a\r\n    condition of things similar to that so often observed in the\r\n    Alps, which is known as the ‘fan structure,’ and has so much\r\n    perplexed geologists.” When we take into account the enormous\r\n    denudation, amounting to thousands of feet in perpendicular\r\n    depth, which is known to have taken place in the Sierras\r\n    within the most recent geological periods, and the whole of\r\n    which, in this case, must also have belonged to the inverted\r\n    portion of the strata—unless indeed the inversion were produced\r\n    by a peculiar sliding and bending of the strata by their\r\n    own weight, the upper flexure having been since entirely\r\n    removed—and when, in addition to this we consider the hundreds\r\n    of miles in length, and the great thickness of the strata in\r\n    question, we can perhaps begin to appreciate the magnitude of\r\n    the movements and forces which would be involved in producing\r\n    such an effect. It would indeed, if true, be a striking\r\n    illustration of the grandeur of the scale upon which many\r\n    of the physical features of this country have been cast, as\r\n    compared with those of other and better known regions. But it\r\n    is hardly worth while to speculate further upon probabilities\r\n    like this in the present state of our knowledge, and I return\r\n    to my subject.\r\n\r\n    In Salt Spring Valley, the rocks consist almost entirely\r\n    of slates, with little variety of character, generally\r\n    thin-bedded, fine-grained and argillaceous, sometimes magnesian\r\n    or chloritic, and often splitting with facility into very thin\r\n    sheets. The thinnest bedded varieties are usually fragile,\r\n    and the structure is often wavy; but sometimes the cleavage\r\n    is regular and thin enough, and the rock possesses sufficient\r\n    strength to furnish a tolerable material for roofing purposes;\r\n    although no attempts have been made, so far as I know, to\r\n    thus apply it;—and, in fact, the expense attendant upon its\r\n    excavation and transportation would preclude any extensive use\r\n    of it, even if its quality were unsurpassed, which it is not.\r\n\r\n    The earthy covering of the rocks throughout the valley is\r\n    usually very shallow and the soil poor, (Tower’s ranch is,\r\n    however, an exception) and in many places the thin sharp edges\r\n    of the slates project in such a way as to form an exceedingly\r\n    jagged surface, though the projections are low, generally not\r\n    exceeding two or three feet in height. Much of the surface is\r\n    strewn with float quartz, usually in the shape of small but\r\n    partially rounded pebbles. Quartz veins of small or moderate\r\n    size, parallel with the stratification, are not uncommon. Iron\r\n    pyrites is of frequent occurrence, with a little gold in the\r\n    quartz. Some of the veins have been more or less worked, but\r\n    none of them to any great extent. About three or four miles\r\n    westerly from Copperopolis, in the hilly portion of the valley,\r\n    is a ten-stamp quartz mill, and a short distance from this,\r\n    on Littlejohn’s Creek, is the site of an older one, which was\r\n    burned down. Neither of these mills ever yielded much profit,\r\n    so far as I can learn, nor does the present one seem likely to\r\n    do so.\r\n\r\n    Several of the gulches in this vicinity are said to have\r\n    yielded gold enough in the past to pay for working, although\r\n    the diggings were not rich or extensive. It is stated also that\r\n    some years since, in one of these gulches, a quartz boulder\r\n    was found, weighing about one hundred pounds, which yielded\r\n    between two and three thousand dollars’ worth of gold. There\r\n    are three or four quartz veins near here, from which more or\r\n    less rock has been crushed. Portions of the rock from one of\r\n    these veins, the Winnemucca, a prettily-shaped vein of three\r\n    to four feet in thickness, are very cellular in structure, and\r\n    some of it shows fine gold quite freely to the naked eye. The\r\n    metal however, must be very irregular in its distribution, or\r\n    the ore would have paid better in the mill than the three or\r\n    four dollars per ton which I am told it yielded; and in fact,\r\n    the general character of the float quartz of the region, when\r\n    taken in connection with the probable origin of the valley\r\n    itself, and the fact that no important placer “diggings” have\r\n    been found here, does not seem to favor the probability that\r\n    these quartz veins will ever prove of much value. Between the\r\n    present mill and the site of the old one, as well as certain\r\n    other localities in the valley, are springs containing various\r\n    alkaline salts, from which the name “Salt Spring Valley” is\r\n    derived.\r\n\r\n    Accompanying the copper formation of Copperopolis, and just\r\n    west of it, is an immense body of serpentine, lying parallel\r\n    with the general stratification of the slates, and traceable\r\n    for miles along the valley by the openings made in it in the\r\n    workings for copper. Opposite a point 1,000 or 1,200 feet\r\n    northwest of the upper shaft of the Keystone claim, but on\r\n    the southwest flank of the outlier of Bear Mountain, already\r\n    noticed, is another heavy mass of serpentine. How far this\r\n    extends in a northwest and a southeast direction I do not know,\r\n    as I have not followed its line of outcrop, but it is certainly\r\n    not less than 1,000 feet in length.\r\n\r\n    The lithological character of the Gopher Hills is entirely\r\n    different from that of Salt Spring Valley. They consist mainly\r\n    of a pretty hard and tough, more or less coarsely crystalline,\r\n    and dark-colored hornblendic or pyroxenic rock, which is\r\n    evidently metamorphic, probably of a grit or sandstone. Epidote\r\n    is not uncommon in this rock, and calcite is occasionally\r\n    found, though rare. Through most of this region the original\r\n    stratification has been largely obscured, or nearly\r\n    obliterated. Its general course, however, can still be traced\r\n    without difficulty in the more or less elongated and flattened\r\n    form, and the general trend which the rocky outcrops frequently\r\n    assume when viewed from a little distance.\r\n\r\n    The texture of the rock varies considerably. In general it\r\n    is rather coarsely crystalline; but not unfrequently it is\r\n    much finer, or even compact; sometimes it is jointed. At\r\n    one locality, in particular, (“Goodwin’s,” or “Sheep Ranch”\r\n    Gulch) I noticed this jointed structure so well developed\r\n    that a compact and very tough, almost imperishable rock could\r\n    be quarried with facility, if desired, in nearly rectangular\r\n    blocks and slabs.\r\n\r\n    It is not uncommon to find among these hills those peculiar\r\n    holes in the rock which were hollowed out and used by the\r\n    Indians as mortars in which to grind their food. I observed\r\n    a number of similar holes in the hard rock, precisely in the\r\n    bed of Rock Creek, in the ravine a short distance below the\r\n    dam of the Salt Spring Valley Reservoir. It may be a question\r\n    here, whether they owe their origin to the Indians or to the\r\n    action of the stream, though from the peculiar deep and narrow\r\n    form, I am inclined to ascribe them to the former. Heavy\r\n    masses of flinty rock or hornstone also occur, particularly\r\n    upon the southwest flanks of the range. This rock usually\r\n    exhibits a much more distinct bedding than the ordinary mass\r\n    of the hills. Its stratification is often perfectly regular,\r\n    and sometimes the layers are beautifully thin and delicate.\r\n    There is a very heavy outcrop of this finely banded rock in\r\n    the ravine a short distance below the dam at Rock Creek.\r\n    Higher up the hill, upon the road known as “Black’s Grade,”\r\n    another outcrop of the same formation has been cut across\r\n    in building the road, and here a portion of the same flinty\r\n    rock is thickly filled with _fossils_, which appear to belong\r\n    either to some species of crinoids or fucoids, though the\r\n    structure is too much obliterated, and the specimens too much\r\n    distorted to admit of definite recognition. They are apparently\r\n    flattened in a direction parallel with the banding of the\r\n    rock. From the general mode of occurrence of this hornstone,\r\n    and from the frequent sharp and distinct lines of demarcation\r\n    between it and the adjacent hornblendic rock, it might be\r\n    inferred that the former traversed the latter as veins, and\r\n    the delicate banding of the rock, although parallel to the\r\n    general stratification of the country, would not preclude\r\n    such an assumption. But the fossils speak decidedly against\r\n    it, and it is probable that the hornstone is a metamorphic\r\n    form of fine sedimentary deposits, and that the banding is\r\n    the result of the original stratification. Quartz veins occur\r\n    here occasionally, and some of them at least are auriferous,\r\n    though I know of none having been worked with profit hitherto.\r\n    It is not improbable, however, that some of them may be found\r\n    remunerative in the future, since many of the gulches among\r\n    the hills here, in the early days of mining, were rich in\r\n    placer gold. The degree of metamorphism throughout these\r\n    hills has been very high; but I have seen no evidence of any\r\n    direct igneous action—at least no rock that I could identify\r\n    as eruptive, with the single exception, perhaps, of a small\r\n    and apparently completely isolated body of well characterized\r\n    _granite_, which occurs near the base of the Gopher Range, and\r\n    between its highly metamorphosed rocks and the San Joaquin\r\n    Valley, which is overlaid with tertiary and other recent\r\n    formations. The occurrence of this patch of granite here,\r\n    isolated as it seems from any other similar rock, is certainly\r\n    a point of much interest; but I have not been able to study its\r\n    relations. Its stratigraphical and topographical position is\r\n    similar to that of the Folsom granite, and it may be connected\r\n    with it in origin. If it should hereafter appear that there\r\n    is a well characterized, though more or less interrupted line\r\n    of granitic outcrops traceable throughout central California,\r\n    along the lower foothills of the mountains, and _west_ of\r\n    the great belt of auriferous slates, it would have a most\r\n    important bearing upon the theory of the general structure of\r\n    the Sierra Nevada. The existence of such a line, indeed, might\r\n    point to a very different, and perhaps more probable, _modus\r\n    operandi_ than that already suggested, by which the auriferous\r\n    slates themselves may have reached their present position, and\r\n    received their easterly dip.\r\n\r\n    One of the most interesting points connected with the geology\r\n    of the Gopher Hills, is the auriferous belt in which occurs the\r\n    “Quail Hill” Mine, and of which I shall speak further presently.\r\n\r\n    Of the geology of Bear Mountain I know but little, having\r\n    crossed it by but a single route. Where I have seen it,\r\n    however, it consists largely of a similar rock to that which\r\n    forms the mass of the Gopher Hills. Chromic iron is said to\r\n    occur in considerable quantity at a certain locality in Bear\r\n    Mountain, the exact whereabouts of which I could not learn. The\r\n    slates of the valley extend, in general, completely up to the\r\n    base of the Gopher and Bear Mountain ranges on either side,\r\n    and sometimes a short distance up their flanks; but here the\r\n    transition to the harder crystalline rock is usually quick and\r\n    well marked.\r\n\r\n    Salt Spring Valley probably owes its existence, as such,\r\n    entirely to inequality of denudation; the comparatively friable\r\n    slates yielding much more readily to mechanical action than the\r\n    harder and more highly metamorphosed rock on either side, which\r\n    has thus been left in the form of mountain ridges, projecting\r\n    many hundreds of feet above the adjacent region, while the\r\n    intervening and surrounding rock has been swept away to the\r\n    plains below.\r\n\r\n    A partial description of the copper mines of Copperopolis\r\n    will be found in the “Geology of California,” Vol. I, pp.\r\n    254-257. The depth of the main shaft in the “Union” is now\r\n    stated to be a little over five hundred feet, and the greatest\r\n    depth reached in the “Keystone,” is said to be five hundred\r\n    and sixty feet. All the deposits of ore here worked lie\r\n    parallel with the strike and dip of the inclosing strata.\r\n    The great ore mass of the “Union” Mine forks or divides into\r\n    two branches towards the northwest; and at the lowest depth\r\n    now reached, its width or thickness, after having reached a\r\n    maximum, is again diminishing. In the “Keystone” Mine there\r\n    have been two separate and nearly parallel bodies of ore\r\n    worked to a considerable extent, and a third one was struck\r\n    last spring previous to the suspension of work in the mine.\r\n    The two main bodies of ore in this mine have “pinched out” or\r\n    disappeared in various directions in their lines of strike\r\n    and dip. They seem to have an irregular lenticular form, and\r\n    together with the great mass of the “Union” appear to lie in\r\n    what are called “shoots,” which pitch at an angle of 50° or\r\n    60° in the direction of the strike towards the northwest. The\r\n    northwesterly prolongation of the strike of the great “Union”\r\n    deposit does not coincide with either of the “Keystone”\r\n    deposits, but passes east of them. There have been other and\r\n    smaller deposits in the “Union” ground, more or less worked,\r\n    lying west of the main body, some of which may possibly connect\r\n    with the “Keystone” shoots, though the best information I\r\n    could obtain leads me to think otherwise, and that they were\r\n    probably isolated lenticular masses. The mass of the great\r\n    deposit in the “Union” Mine consists of an intimate mixture of\r\n    chalcopyrite and iron pyrites, containing on an average sixteen\r\n    to seventeen per cent. of copper. Well defined selvages are not\r\n    to be seen at Copperopolis, and the country rock is impregnated\r\n    in all directions, sometimes to a considerable distance from\r\n    the purer ore, with more or less finely disseminated copper and\r\n    iron pyrites. In Europe it would pay to crush and work much of\r\n    the wall rock itself for the copper which it contains; but here\r\n    it is entirely worthless, as even ten to twelve per cent. ore\r\n    is not worth mining and shipping at present prices.\r\n\r\n    It will be seen that the more recent and deeper developements\r\n    in the Copperopolis mines have only served to confirm the\r\n    opinion expressed two years ago by the State Geologist (Geol.\r\n    Vol. I, p. 225) that “the deposits of copper ore in this\r\n    region, like nearly all the others in California, do not\r\n    appear to be included in regular fissure veins, but rather to\r\n    form _independent masses_ [the italics are mine] lying in the\r\n    direction of the strike of the inclosing rocks, and dipping\r\n    with them.” It seems, further, that they are here arranged\r\n    in some sort _en échelon_. There is no evidence whatever of\r\n    the existence here of a regular and continuous vein of copper\r\n    ore, stretching for miles through the country, as some have\r\n    supposed. (See Ross Browne’s Report, p. 144.)\r\n\r\n    The finding of “copper indications,” _i.e._, of small and\r\n    isolated bodies of ore, distributed with some constancy\r\n    through a narrow belt of country, for no matter how many\r\n    miles in length, is anything but conclusive evidence of the\r\n    existence beneath of a _regular vein_ of corresponding length\r\n    (which, by the way, if it existed, would be an anomaly in the\r\n    mining world)—especially when all the developments of the\r\n    most extensive workings hitherto made point so decidedly and\r\n    strongly to the opinion that there is no _true vein_ at all.\r\n    Such “indications” are however evidences, so far as they go\r\n    (and they go a good way in this direction) of the probable\r\n    existence of other large bodies of ore distributed here and\r\n    there along the belt in question. It is not improbable that\r\n    such may be found in the future, and it would not be strange\r\n    even if some of them should surpass in magnitude and value the\r\n    great deposit of the “Union,” which has already yielded such\r\n    enormous quantities of copper, and is yet far from being worked\r\n    out.\r\n\r\n    A description of the auriferous deposit of Quail Hill, in\r\n    the Gopher Range, together with a similar one at Whisky Hill\r\n    (called also the “Harpending Mine”) in Placer County, by\r\n    Prof. B. Silliman, was read before the California Academy of\r\n    Natural Sciences, at their meeting of April 15th, 1867, and\r\n    will be found in their published “Proceedings,” Vol. III, pp.\r\n    349-351. This paper describes well the particular deposits in\r\n    question, as well as the general appearance and character of\r\n    the formation in which they occur. Such deposits, however, are\r\n    not confined to one or two localities; but there are other\r\n    points in Calaveras County at which gold is known to exist in\r\n    considerable quantity, and with similar mode of occurrence.\r\n    Among these I may mention Quail Hill No. 2, near the Napoleon\r\n    Copper Mine, two or three miles southeast of Quail Hill No. 1,\r\n    and the “Plymouth Rock,” or “Austin and Hathaway” claim, at\r\n    Rich Gulch, near the Calaveras River. Moreover, the geological\r\n    causes and the peculiar chemical decomposition of the rock,\r\n    which have been involved in the formation of the deposits in\r\n    question, are by no means confined to the localities where\r\n    gold is known to occur. On the contrary, they may be traced\r\n    with considerable constancy through a narrow belt of country\r\n    along the southwest flank of the Gopher Hills, and stretching\r\n    from the Calaveras River southeast for a distance of at least\r\n    fifteen miles, and perhaps farther. Towards the northwest,\r\n    the same belt crosses the Calaveras; but how much farther it\r\n    extends in this direction I have no present means of knowing.\r\n    It is not unlikely that a similar formation may be found to\r\n    exist, here and there at least, in the same general line of\r\n    strike, nearly parallel with the stratification of the country,\r\n    through Amador and El Dorado Counties to Placer, and perhaps\r\n    beyond. The possibility of this at least is worth remembering.\r\n    Throughout this belt, in the Gopher Range, surface cuts and\r\n    shafts, of greater or less depth, made and sunk in prospecting\r\n    for copper, are of frequent occurrence. In fact, this is the\r\n    same belt that has been so often mentioned as “the second\r\n    important copper-bearing belt of Calaveras County,” and located\r\n    some six or seven miles southwest of the main copper belt\r\n    of Copperopolis. The “importance” of this belt, on account\r\n    of the copper ores which it contains, has been most grossly\r\n    exaggerated. An amusing illustration of this fact is to be\r\n    seen in a “map of the copper mines in Calaveras County,”\r\n    published a few years since, which represents the whole region\r\n    in question as literally covered for miles with highly colored\r\n    “locations” or “copper claims,” the whole of which, with\r\n    few exceptions—and these due not to copper but to gold—have\r\n    served no further end than that of rendering their locators\r\n    and owners sadder and wiser men. At one locality, indeed, viz,\r\n    the “Napoleon Mine,” a body of copper ore was found which in\r\n    many countries would have been remunerative, and was worked\r\n    to a considerable extent; but the working here was attended\r\n    only with loss, and was some time since entirely discontinued.\r\n    It should be remembered, however, in speaking of the copper\r\n    mines of California, that not only have they had to contend\r\n    with the general ignorance of copper mining, and especially\r\n    of copper metallurgy which has existed throughout the State,\r\n    and with extremely high prices for labor and transportation;\r\n    but also that, for a year or two past, the largely increased\r\n    supply of ore from the mines of Chili in South America, and\r\n    elsewhere—together with the diminished demand and consequent\r\n    low price for metallic copper, reacting with increased effect\r\n    upon the value of the ore—have told with crushing weight\r\n    even upon the best mines. There are certainly not more than\r\n    one or two, perhaps not even a single deposit of copper ore\r\n    in the known world, which surpasses or equals, in magnitude\r\n    and intrinsic richness combined, that of the “Union” Mine of\r\n    Copperopolis; and yet it is said that even the “Union” itself,\r\n    which is the only mine now active at Copperopolis, is hardly\r\n    more than paying expenses at present rates. So far then as my\r\n    observations extend, there is simply nothing whatever in this\r\n    “second copper belt” which can for some time to come justify\r\n    the expenditure of money in searching for copper here; though\r\n    it is not impossible that, besides the “Napoleon” Mine, other\r\n    deposits of ore may exist within the belt, which at some future\r\n    time, and under more favorable circumstances of labor, fuel,\r\n    and transportation, may become of value for the copper which\r\n    they contain.\r\n\r\n    It has been already remarked that the zone or belt of surface\r\n    decomposition in which the “Quail Hill” and other similar mines\r\n    occur, may be traced with considerable constancy for at least\r\n    fifteen or eighteen miles, and that it is not improbable that\r\n    it is much longer than this. We cannot, however, infer from\r\n    our present knowledge that the decomposed or “calico” rock is\r\n    continuous throughout the belt, or even for any considerable\r\n    portion of its length. On the contrary, its distribution\r\n    within the belt appears capricious and local, _i.e._, it\r\n    seems to occur in more or less detached and isolated masses,\r\n    which vary largely in form and size, and are irregular and\r\n    indefinite in outline; so that little more can be predicated\r\n    of their occurrence in general, than that they are mostly\r\n    confined within a comparatively narrow belt, and that their\r\n    longest dimension exhibits a general tendency to approximate\r\n    parallelism with the axis of the belt, and the stratification\r\n    of the inclosing country. Sometimes, as for instance, along the\r\n    northeastern side of the Quail Hill formation, this tendency is\r\n    so strongly developed, and the passage from the decomposed to\r\n    the undecomposed rock is so rapid, as to form for some little\r\n    distance a tolerably straight and well defined “wall” or line\r\n    of demarcation, parallel, or nearly so, with the stratification\r\n    of the country. But the change or passage from the decomposed\r\n    or “calico” rock to the surrounding undecomposed country,\r\n    though sometimes rapid is always gradual, so far as I have\r\n    seen; and though we cannot yet speak much from underground\r\n    explorations, the surface appearances throughout the country\r\n    would indicate decidedly that so regular a line of demarcation\r\n    as this at Quail Hill is the exception, and not the rule.\r\n    The southwestern limit of the decomposed mass of Quail Hill\r\n    has been found at several points; but here the change from\r\n    the decomposed to the undecomposed rock is not so rapid; and\r\n    though the explorations here, being shallow and limited, are\r\n    insufficient to determine this point with certainty, it is\r\n    not probable that any such regularity of demarcation exists\r\n    here as upon the opposite side. Most of the “calico rock”\r\n    of this belt still retains distinctly the structure of the\r\n    undecomposed rock from which it was formed. The crystalline\r\n    hornblendic rock is thus seen to have been largely altered by\r\n    the decomposing agency, and even the hornstone, which lay in\r\n    its track, seems to have been more or less affected by it. The\r\n    decomposition has been purely an oxidation, accompanied by such\r\n    mechanical and chemical changes as filtering mineral waters\r\n    might produce. It is probably superficial, both in origin and\r\n    character, extending to no great depth, although the main level\r\n    at Quail Hill is nearly one hundred and twenty feet beneath the\r\n    summit of the hill, and the decomposition of most of the rock\r\n    at this depth, so far as exploration has gone, is as perfect\r\n    as at any higher level. It is certainly long subsequent in\r\n    date to the metamorphism of the surrounding country, and is\r\n    unquestionably largely due to the action of the products of the\r\n    oxidation of metallic sulphurets (chiefly those of iron and\r\n    copper) which were originally distributed through the rock. At\r\n    the same time it is not easy to account for the whole of it\r\n    in this way alone, since at certain localities undecomposed\r\n    sulphurets are seen near the surface, and in rock which is\r\n    apparently much more permeable to atmospheric influences than\r\n    was much of that which has been more deeply decomposed; and\r\n    again, much of the decomposed rock, though retaining well its\r\n    original structure, shows far too little traces of sulphurets\r\n    to readily account for so general and thorough a decomposition\r\n    as has taken place. It is all indeed more or less colored by\r\n    oxide of iron, but much of it is not deeply colored, and the\r\n    undecomposed hornblendic rock itself, in the absence of all\r\n    sulphurets, contains sufficient iron in the state of protoxide\r\n    to impart a strong coloring when the rock is decomposed and\r\n    the iron passes to the state of sesquioxide. Much of the iron\r\n    originally present has undoubtedly been removed in a soluble\r\n    form, as sulphate, etc. But in rock which preserves its\r\n    original structure, as well as most of this does, pyrites, if\r\n    originally present, would have left traces of its existence in\r\n    the form of casts or cavities in the decomposed mass, which\r\n    might or might not have been filled with ferric oxide or other\r\n    matter. In certain localities the decomposed rock is in fact\r\n    filled with such cavities, often cubical in form, attesting the\r\n    former presence of large quantities of disseminated sulphurets.\r\n    But in other localities they are few and far between, and here\r\n    accordingly the decomposition can hardly be supposed to have\r\n    been due to the local presence of sulphurets alone.\r\n\r\n    The exact methods by which the general and local decomposition\r\n    has been effected, and those by which the rock was originally\r\n    impregnated with metallic ores—as well as the manner in which\r\n    certain substances, as barytes, now found as sulphate, and\r\n    true porphyry, now found as kaoline or lithomarge, have found\r\n    their present situation in the belt in question—all these would\r\n    possess both interest and importance in a high degree, could\r\n    they be more definitely known. Such questions, however, cannot\r\n    be answered with certainty, and their discussion here would\r\n    lead us too far into the doubtful realm of chemical geology.\r\n\r\n    But whatever may have been the agencies at work, it is evident\r\n    that there is nothing in all this to remind us of a true vein\r\n    formation. It appears that the zone in question is neither a\r\n    vein, nor generally speaking a system of veins. On the other\r\n    hand, it possesses emphatically in general the characteristics\r\n    of what the Germans style an impregnation—an impregnation\r\n    indeed which exhibits a certain regularity as being mostly\r\n    confined within a narrow zone, and stretching through a\r\n    considerable extent of country, but which within these limits\r\n    shows the greatest irregularity of form, and much variety of\r\n    character. Veins of quartz occur here and there within the\r\n    belt; but they are not more frequent here than elsewhere, and\r\n    their occurrence has probably little or no direct connection\r\n    with the peculiar character of the belt itself. There is\r\n    very little that deserves the name of quartz at Quail Hill,\r\n    though much of the surface rock is pretty highly silicious in\r\n    character.\r\n\r\n    The impregnation of the rock with metallic sulphurets,\r\n    particularly with sulphurets containing copper, has in certain\r\n    localities been sufficiently powerful and concentrated to\r\n    assume, in greater or less degree, the characteristics of\r\n    segregated veins of limited extent. This has been the case\r\n    at the Napoleon mine, and also at Quail Hill, where there\r\n    is, or was, a band of oxidized ores of copper traversing the\r\n    decomposed rock in a direction parallel with the general\r\n    stratification. This band consisted chiefly of the green and\r\n    blue carbonates of copper, mingled with ferruginous and earthy\r\n    matter, and accompanied by barytes. The last named mineral, so\r\n    common a veinstone in other parts of the world, but hitherto\r\n    so rare in California, occurs here in considerable quantity.\r\n    Its form is granular compact, sometimes quite pure, but usually\r\n    contaminated and intermingled with other matters. Crystallized\r\n    specimens of it have not been found here to my knowledge. It is\r\n    hardly probable that the barytes itself contains either gold\r\n    or silver; yet it certainly occurs here in the most intimate\r\n    contact with both, as I have seen respectable particles of\r\n    gold in place upon the immediate surface of compact specimens\r\n    of barytes—and a sample of heavy concentrated barytic sand\r\n    from the tailings of the mill, of sufficient fineness to pass\r\n    through a sieve of one hundred holes to the linear inch,\r\n    yielded to the assay over eleven dollars per ton in gold and\r\n    silver.\r\n\r\n    The thickness of the copper band varied from one to three or\r\n    four feet. Its outlines were indefinite, and its original\r\n    characteristics of form, etc., much obscured by the complete\r\n    decomposition both of itself and the surrounding rock. It was\r\n    without doubt originally a segregated mass of sulphurets;\r\n    and though it seems now to have nearly or quite run out and\r\n    disappeared, it may be found to come in again as such, in\r\n    depth, unaltered below the line of surface decomposition.\r\n\r\n    Other bands of similar character may perhaps exist in the\r\n    yet undeveloped portions of the mine. But the great mass\r\n    of decomposed material which forms Quail Hill as a whole,\r\n    retaining as it does to so great an extent the original\r\n    structure of the country rock from which it was formed, can in\r\n    no proper sense be called a vein; although its extent, when\r\n    considered as a repository of the precious metals, is something\r\n    far transcending the size of ordinary veins.\r\n\r\n    The gold and silver of these formations which have recently\r\n    attracted so much attention, and have become the object\r\n    of extensive mining operations at Quail Hill, seem to be\r\n    distributed at the latter place, to a greater or less extent,\r\n    throughout the whole mass of the decomposed rock. The surface\r\n    earth of the hill, also, everywhere contains gold, which may be\r\n    discovered by washing it in the pan; but this ceases to be the\r\n    case on the hillsides as soon as the limits of the decomposed\r\n    rock are passed. Some of the gold, as stated by Prof. Silliman\r\n    in his communication to the California Academy, already\r\n    referred to, is quite coarse; but much of it is exceedingly\r\n    fine and difficult to save in the mill. It is a noticeable\r\n    fact in the distribution of the precious metals at Quail Hill,\r\n    that the cupreous ores and the material in their vicinity have\r\n    hitherto been found to be always rich in gold and silver, and\r\n    to contain chiefly, if not exclusively, the coarsest gold.\r\n\r\n    The distribution of the gold at Quail Hill is not uniform, the\r\n    more slaty and ferruginous portion of the decomposed rock being\r\n    generally the richest in ore, while the compact porphyritic\r\n    kaoline contains but traces of gold, if any, and some of the\r\n    other and more compact rock is comparatively poor. The original\r\n    distribution of the sulphurets here seems also to have followed\r\n    approximately the same law—the kaoline containing in general\r\n    but little trace of their existence, while the more slaty rock\r\n    is often full of their cavities. Hematite, as well as the\r\n    hydrated sesquioxide of iron, occurs here in small quantities;\r\n    and a curious point in this connection is the fact that, while\r\n    much of the best ore is very highly charged with the hydrated\r\n    sesquioxide, the hematite has been found hitherto to contain\r\n    little or no gold. The origin of the decomposed porphyry\r\n    at Quail Hill is a point of much interest, and it may be a\r\n    question whether it is not the remnant of an intrusive igneous\r\n    dyke. The arguments in favor of this supposition consist in\r\n    the entire dissimilarity in character and structure between\r\n    it and the surrounding material, as well as in the rarity of\r\n    porphyry in the region round about. In fact, I have nowhere\r\n    else in this portion of the country seen anything deserving of\r\n    the name, while the whole texture and appearance of this mass\r\n    at Quail Hill are precisely such as would have resulted from\r\n    the decomposition in place of a true feldspathic porphyry.\r\n    But however strongly these facts may seem to argue in favor\r\n    of an igneous origin, it is not easy to reconcile such a\r\n    supposition with its mode of occurrence here. Other masses of\r\n    similar character may exist within the hill; but so far as\r\n    existing developments have cut or uncovered the one of which\r\n    I speak, the indications are that it is irregular in outline,\r\n    quite limited in extent, and of approximate lenticular shape.\r\n    Moreover, in certain places, it seems to pass gradually\r\n    into the eastern country rock, without any distinct line of\r\n    demarcation, the change in the texture of the rock being\r\n    even more gradual than the passage from the decomposed to\r\n    undecomposed material. At certain points, but a few feet from\r\n    the eastern “wall,” the kaoline is as perfectly porphyritic in\r\n    its texture and appearance as in any portion of the mass, while\r\n    between the two is every grade of passage from the one to the\r\n    other—the country rock being neither distinctly porphyritic in\r\n    texture, nor chiefly feldspathic in composition. I am strongly\r\n    inclined to think, therefore, in spite of its peculiar and\r\n    distinctive character, that this porphyritic mass is but a\r\n    local result of the metamorphism of sedimentary strata, which,\r\n    in many portions of this region, seems to have been as varied\r\n    in character as it has been high in degree.\r\n\r\n    The degradation of such formations as this at Quail Hill, has\r\n    undoubtedly furnished some of the placer gold of the region;\r\n    but the evidence does not by any means justify us in supposing\r\n    that it has furnished the whole of it. Gopher Gulch, which runs\r\n    at the foot of Quail Hill, and its branches, for a mile above\r\n    this point, or nearly to the summit of the Gopher Range, and\r\n    hundreds of feet above the level of the Quail Hill formation,\r\n    were in early days rich in placer gold, much of which was very\r\n    coarse. Other gulches in the vicinity have also furnished more\r\n    or less gold high up towards the summit of the range. Moreover,\r\n    the quartz veins, which here and there occur in the hard\r\n    metamorphic rock, are known, some of them at least, to contain\r\n    gold, and such have probably played their part in the formation\r\n    of the placers.\r\n\r\n    I have already mentioned the fact of the prominent association\r\n    of the precious metals with ores of copper at the Quail Hill\r\n    mine; but this fact derives still further interest from what\r\n    follows. As far as my observations have extended in Calaveras\r\n    County, and also at Whisky Hill, in Placer County, wherever\r\n    gold and silver have yet been found in paying quantities in the\r\n    decomposed rock formation, there also, or close at hand, are\r\n    found the oxidized ores of copper, carbonates and silicates;\r\n    and conversely, I have nowhere seen oxidized ores of copper\r\n    in this decomposed rock which were not, comparatively at\r\n    least, rich in gold and silver. It is true that sufficient\r\n    developments have not yet been made to enable us to state\r\n    whether this is the general fact or not. It is possible\r\n    that the association of these ores may be to a certain\r\n    extent accidental; but it is not unlikely that it may be\r\n    otherwise;—and at all events this is a point well worthy of\r\n    attention and further investigation.\r\n\r\n    As this finishes my remarks upon the “calico rock” formation. I\r\n    will close by simply mentioning a point relating to the lower\r\n    country of Calaveras County, that I have not yet seen publicly\r\n    noticed elsewhere. The low, rolling hills which form the\r\n    eastern border of the San Joaquin plain between the Stanislaus\r\n    and Calaveras Rivers, contain extensive beds of horizontally\r\n    stratified material, which is probably sedimentary-volcanic\r\n    in origin. The color of these beds is usually varying shades\r\n    of gray. They contain no pebbles, so far as I have seen; they\r\n    generally crumble easily, and resemble in appearance a friable\r\n    sandstone. But their grain or grit, which is pretty fine, is\r\n    also quite clean and sharp as well as hard, and rough-polishes\r\n    rapidly the hardest steel when rubbed upon it.\r\n\r\n    These beds are of considerable thickness, and cover many square\r\n    miles of country. Their stratification has evidently not been\r\n    disturbed since they were deposited, though they have been\r\n    largely eroded. The frequent flat tops of the hills, and the\r\n    level benches, which these beds have produced along their\r\n    sides, by irregularities of wear, impart a peculiar aspect to\r\n    the scenery.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Occurrence of Glauberite at Borax Lake, California.\r\n\r\nBY B. SILLIMAN.\r\n\r\n    Glauberite, a species not before recognised as occurring in\r\n    North America occurs at Borax Lake, where it has lately been\r\n    obtained in blue clay, brought up from a depth of forty feet by\r\n    an artesian boring. No other crystallized, species was detected\r\n    in the masses of clay examined.\r\n\r\n    Glauberite is a sulphate of lime and soda, half an atom of\r\n    each base in combination with an atom of sulphuric acid. It\r\n    is usually associated with rock salt, as at Villa Rubia, in\r\n    New Castile, and also at Ausee, in Bavaria, and in the salt\r\n    mines of Vic, in France. In the Atacama desert in Peru, it is\r\n    associated with a fibrous borate of lime called Hagesine. Mr.\r\n    Stretch, the State Mineralogist of Nevada, in his catalogue\r\n    of minerals found in that State, mentions borate of lime\r\n    (Hagesine) as occurring in globular masses and in layers from\r\n    two to five inches thick, alternating with layers of salt in a\r\n    salt marsh in the Columbus mining District, Esmeralda County.\r\n    It is quite possible that a careful scrutiny would detect\r\n    glauberite also in this association so analagous to that of\r\n    Atacama.\r\n\r\n    Reference was also made to the occurrence of the species\r\n    laghassite detected by Prof. S. in 1864, at the little Salt\r\n    Lake near Rag Town in Nevada, as illustrating in an interesting\r\n    manner, the chemistry of these bodies of saline water. The\r\n    latter species is a hydrous, carbonate of lime and sodium,\r\n    while glauberite is a sulphate of the same bases. Both salts\r\n    undoubtedly result from the reaction of the respective elements\r\n    pre-existing in solution in the saline waters.\r\n\r\n    The crystals of glauberite from Borax Lake occur in very thin\r\n    flattened tables, derived apparently from the great extension\r\n    of the faces _O_ of the Monactinic prism.\r\n\r\nMr Bloomer read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Scientific Name of the “Big Trees.”\r\n\r\nBY H. G. BLOOMER, CURATOR OF BOTANY.\r\n\r\n    Early in 1853, specimens of the “Big Trees” were presented\r\n    to this Academy; Dr. Kellogg and other botanists, members of\r\n    the Academy, at once pronounced them to belong to the genus\r\n    _Taxodium_, to which the common “Redwood” of California was\r\n    referred at that time. Endlicher’s work upon the Coniferæ, in\r\n    which the genus _Sequoia_ (named after an Indian Chief) was\r\n    instituted, had not at that time reached us. Our California\r\n    Redwood, _Taxodium sempervirens_ was included in the new genus\r\n    of Endlicher. So then, the true scientific position of the\r\n    Big Trees was first determined by members of the California\r\n    Academy of Natural Sciences. At the time of the presentation\r\n    of these specimens, an English collector of plants and seeds,\r\n    Mr. William Lobb, saw them, and having experience enough to\r\n    know that they belonged to a species new to the gardeners,\r\n    immediately started for the grove and obtained cones, wood\r\n    and foliage, which he carried with him to England in the fall\r\n    of 1853. Dr. Lindley hastily described these as _Wellingtonia\r\n    gigantea_ in the _Gardener’s Chronicle_ for December 1853.\r\n\r\n    In the meantime Drs. Kellogg and Behr pursued their studies of\r\n    the great tree, and at length being convinced that there was no\r\n    generic difference between it and the _Taxodium sempervirens_\r\n    (now _Sequoia sempervirens_) instituted the species _Taxodium\r\n    giganteum_, described in the Proceedings of the Cal. Acad. Nat.\r\n    Sciences, May 7th, 1855, Vol. I, page 53.\r\n\r\n    Previous to this, however, Seemann, in Bonplandia, 3, p. 27,\r\n    January 15th, 1855, described it under the term of _Sequoia\r\n    Wellingtonia_. Mr. Seemann gives his reasons at length in the\r\n    Magazine of Natural History, 3d Series, Vol. 3, p. 164, for\r\n    discarding the genus _Wellingtonia_ of Lindley, and says:\r\n    “Dr. Torrey was undoubtedly the first who determined the true\r\n    systematic position of the tree.” Now this is an error, for Dr.\r\n    Torrey’s publication is dated in August, 1855; whereas Drs.\r\n    Kellogg and Behr’s appeared May 7th, 1855.\r\n\r\n    The principal thing to be determined in this matter now is, as\r\n    to the name and author, for these must accompany each other;\r\n    shall it be:\r\n\r\n    _Sequoia gigantea_ Endlicher, May, 1847;\r\n    _Wellingtonia gigantea_ Lindley, December, 1853;\r\n    _Sequoia Wellingtonia_ Seemann, January 15th, 1855;\r\n    _Taxodium giganteum_ Kellogg and Behr, May 7th, 1855; or\r\n    _Sequoia gigantea_ Torrey, August, 1855?\r\n\r\n    There are a number of other names made use of and referred to\r\n    by Seemann, Murray and others; but as they come to us without\r\n    the least scientific authority, they ought not to be considered.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Lindley’s genus falls to the ground almost by common\r\n    consent. I will refer here to a communication from Prof.\r\n    Brewer, late of the geological survey of this State. Before he\r\n    left San Francisco, he sent Dr. W. J. Hooker one of the large\r\n    photographs of the “Grizzly Giant,” one of the big trees in the\r\n    Mariposa grove; he had written to Prof. Brewer, asking about\r\n    “the Wellingtonia, Washingtonia, I care not what you call it.”\r\n    In Prof. Brewer’s answer, he told him that he (the Prof.) did\r\n    care what he called it, and also that it was not a new genus,\r\n    but a _Sequoia_. Dr. Hooker, in his answer to this, says: “I\r\n    heartily agree with you in all you say about the big tree; it\r\n    has now produced good fruit in our gardens, and is as true a\r\n    _Sequoia_ as can be, and should have no other name.” So here we\r\n    have high authority for discarding Lindley’s _Wellingtonia_.\r\n    Yet this only settles the question as to the generic term; Dr.\r\n    Hooker’s opinion thus far has only given us _Sequoia_.\r\n\r\n    The next claimant in point of priority is Dr. Seemann, who\r\n    rightly refers it to _Sequoia_, and adds the specific term\r\n    _Wellingtonia_, giving sufficient reasons for discarding\r\n    Endlicher’s specific term _gigantea_, as that was shown by\r\n    Hooker to be founded upon _Abies_ (Picea) _bracteata_.\r\n\r\n    In recent publications of American botanists, we find the term\r\n    _Sequoia gigantea_ of Torrey used to designate the species;\r\n    to show that this is not the true nomenclature, I need but\r\n    to say that Dr. Torrey never described it at all in any book\r\n    or proceedings. The reference is to the American Journal of\r\n    Science and Art, Vol. 18, p. 286, August, 1855, where it\r\n    says: “Dr. Torrey made to the American Association for the\r\n    Advancement of Science a communication in reference to the Big\r\n    Tree of California;” also Vol. 17, p. 443, but no description.\r\n    Now here is no sufficient ground for Dr. Torrey’s _Sequoia\r\n    gigantea_, for there is absolutely no description at all,\r\n    but a mere reference; and this reference is published three\r\n    months after Drs. Kellogg and Behr have described the tree as\r\n    _Taxodium giganteum_.\r\n\r\n    I think now that Endlicher’s, Lindley’s, and Torrey’s claims\r\n    have been refuted; the controversy is narrowed down as between\r\n    Seemann and Drs. Kellogg and Behr. By strict usage, and without\r\n    the usual courtesy of scientific men, the nomenclature of\r\n    the “Big Tree” should be _Sequoia Wellingtonia_ of Seemann.\r\n    But if courtesy is to be shown at all, it should be to those\r\n    students who are entitled to it; that Drs. Kellogg and Behr are\r\n    justly entitled to this honor, I cannot for one moment doubt.\r\n    Specimens of this gigantic tree were in their possession many\r\n    months before any other botanist had directed his attention to\r\n    the subject; studying indeed under every disadvantage, for our\r\n    botanical literature at that time was very meagre, not even\r\n    Endlicher’s work on the Coniferæ, in which was to be found the\r\n    then newly instituted _Sequoia_, to which was referred our\r\n    common _Taxodium sempervirens_ of Lambert, being available.\r\n    Had they access to this work they would have given us _Sequoia\r\n    gigantea_; mark, that this was three months before Torrey’s\r\n    reference.\r\n\r\n    They therefore are in truth and reality, if not technically,\r\n    the first scientific discoverers of the true position of the\r\n    great tree. The terms they used were _Taxodium giganteum_,\r\n    meaning by this that it was a congener with _Taxodium\r\n    sempervirens_, which it was.\r\n\r\n    If Seemann’s technical claims are set aside, then by courtesy\r\n    _Sequoia gigantea_ Kellogg and Behr, ought to be written as the\r\n    true name of the “Big Tree.”\r\n\r\n    For the advancement of science, we hope the final closing of\r\n    this and other questions pertaining to the Coniferæ of this\r\n    coast will be left to the able monographer of this order, Dr.\r\n    George Engelmann, of St. Louis, who is now in Europe, having\r\n    the notes and observations of recent botanists, and who will\r\n    there have access to all the literature and material necessary\r\n    to establish scientific accuracy and unity in this important\r\n    family of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF AUTHORS.—1863-1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AYRES, DR.
