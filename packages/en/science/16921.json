The small\r\ncabin was thickly redolent with spicy odors and Rip sniffed\r\nappreciatively.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure going to be about the best smelling Terran who ever set boot\r\non Sargol's soil,\" his soft slur of speech ended in a rich chuckle.\r\n\r\nDane snorted and tried to estimate progress over one shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"The things we have to do for Trade!\" his comment carried a hint of\r\npresent embarrassment. \"Get it well in--this stuff's supposed to hold for\r\nhours. It'd better. According to Van those Salariki can talk your ears\r\nright off your head and say nothing worth hearing. And we have to sit and\r\nlisten until we get a straight answer out of them. Phew!\" He shook his\r\nhead. In such close quarters the scent, pleasing as it was, was also\r\noverpowering. \"We would have to pick a world such as this--\"\r\n\r\nRip's dark fingers halted their circular motion. \"Dane,\" he warned,\r\n\"don't you go talking against this venture. We got it soft and we're\r\ngoing to be credit-happy--if it works out--\"\r\n\r\nBut, perversely, Dane held to a gloomier view of the immediate future.\r\n\"_If_,\" he repeated. \"There's a galaxy of 'ifs' in this Sargol\r\nproposition. All very well for you to rest easy on your fins--you don't\r\nhave to run about smelling like a spice works before you can get the time\r\nof day from one of the natives!\"\r\n\r\nRip put down the jar of cream. \"Different worlds, different customs,\" he\r\niterated the old tag of the Service. \"Be glad this one is so easy to\r\nconform to. There are some I can think of--There,\" he ended his massage\r\nwith a stinging slap. \"You're all evenly greased. Good thing you don't\r\nhave Van's bulk to cover. It takes him a good hour to get his cream\r\non--even with Frank helping to spread. Your clothes ought to be steamed\r\nup and ready, too, by now--\"\r\n\r\nHe opened a tight wall cabinet, originally intended to sterilize clothing\r\nwhich might be contaminated by contact with organisms inimical to\r\nTerrans. A cloud of steam fragrant with the same spicy scent poured out.\r\n\r\nDane gingerly tugged loose his Trade uniform, its brown silky fabric damp\r\non his skin as he dressed. Luckily Sargol was warm. When he stepped out\r\non its ruby tinted soil this morning no lingering taint of his off-world\r\norigin must remain to disgust the sensitive nostrils of the Salariki. He\r\nsupposed he would get used to this process. After all this was the first\r\ntime he had undergone the ritual. But he couldn't lose the secret\r\nconviction that it was all very silly. Only what Rip had pointed out was\r\nthe truth--one adjusted to the customs of aliens or one didn't trade and\r\nthere were other things he might have had to do on other worlds which\r\nwould have been far more upsetting to that core of private fastidiousness\r\nwhich few would have suspected existed in his tall, lanky frame.\r\n\r\n\"Whew--out in the open with you--!\" Ali Kamil apprentice Engineer,\r\nscrewed his too regular features into an expression of extreme distaste\r\nand waved Dane by him in the corridor.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of his shipmates' olfactory nerves, Dane hurried on to the\r\nport which gave on the ramp now tying the Queen to Sargol's crust. But\r\nthere he lingered, waiting for Van Rycke, the Cargo-master of the spacer\r\nand his immediate superior. It was early morning and now that he was out\r\nof the confinement of the ship the fresh morning winds cut about him,\r\nrippling through the blue-green grass forest beyond, to take much of his\r\nmomentary irritation with them.\r\n\r\nThere were no mountains in this section of Sargol--the highest elevations\r\nbeing rounded hills tightly clothed with the same ten-foot grass which\r\ncovered the plains. From the Queen's observation ports, one could watch\r\nthe constant ripple of the grass so that the planet appeared to be\r\nlargely clothed in a shimmering, flowing carpet. To the west were the\r\nseas--stretches of shallow water so cut up by strings of islands that\r\nthey more resembled a series of salty lakes. And it was what was to be\r\nfound in those seas which had lured the Solar Queen to Sargol.\r\n\r\nThough, by rights, the discovery was that of another Trader--Traxt\r\nCam--who had bid for trading rights to Sargol, hoping to make a\r\ncomfortable fortune--or at least expenses with a slight profit--in the\r\nperfume trade, exporting from the scented planet some of its most\r\nfragrant products. But once on Sargol he had discovered the Koros\r\nstones--gems of a new type--a handful of which offered across the board\r\nin one of the inner planet trading marts had nearly caused a riot among\r\nbidding gem merchants. And Cam had been well on the way to becoming one\r\nof the princes of Trade when he had been drawn into the vicious net of\r\nthe Limbian pirates and finished off.\r\n\r\nBecause they, too, had stumbled into the trap which was Limbo, and had\r\nhad a very definite part in breaking up that devilish installation, the\r\ncrew of the Solar Queen had claimed as their reward the trading rights of\r\nTraxt Cam in default of legal heirs. And so here they were on Sargol with\r\nthe notes left by Cam as their guide, and as much lore concerning the\r\nSalariki as was known crammed into their minds.\r\n\r\nDane sat down on the end of the ramp, his feet on Sargolian soil, thin,\r\nred soil with glittering bits of gold flake in it. He did not doubt that\r\nhe was under observation from hidden eyes, but he tried to show no sign\r\nthat he guessed it. The adult Salariki maintained at all times an\r\nattitude of aloof and complete indifference toward the Traders, but the\r\njuvenile population were as curious as their elders were contemptuous.\r\nPerhaps there was a method of approach in that. Dane considered the idea.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke and Captain Jellico had handled the first negotiations--and the\r\nprocess had taken most of a day--the result totaling exactly nothing. In\r\ntheir contacts with the off world men the feline ancestered Salariki were\r\nceremonious, wary, and completely detached. But Cam had gotten to them\r\nsomehow--or he would not have returned from his first trip with that\r\npouch of Koros stones. Only, among his records, salvaged on Limbo, he had\r\nleft absolutely no clue as to how he had beaten down native sales\r\nresistance. It was baffling. But patience had to be the middle name of\r\nevery Trader and Dane had complete faith in Van. Sooner or later the\r\nCargo-master would find a key to unlock the Salariki.\r\n\r\nAs if the thought of Dane's chief had summoned him, Van Rycke, his\r\nscented tunic sealed to his bull's neck in unaccustomed trimness, his\r\ncap on his blond head, strode down the ramp, broadcasting waves of\r\nfragrance as he moved. He sniffed vigorously as he approached his\r\nassistant and then nodded in approval.\r\n\r\n\"So you're all greased and ready--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the Captain coming too, sir?\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke shook his head. \"This is our headache. Patience, my boy,\r\npatience--\" He led the way through a thin screen of the grass on the\r\nother side of the scorched landing field to a well-packed earth road.\r\n\r\nAgain Dane felt eyes, knew that they were being watched. But no Salarik\r\nstepped out of concealment. At least they had nothing to fear in the way\r\nof attack. Traders were immune, taboo, and the trading stations were set\r\nup under the white diamond shield of peace, a peace guaranteed on blood\r\noath by every clan chieftain in the district. Even in the midst of\r\ninterclan feuding deadly enemies met in amity under that shield and would\r\nnot turn claw knife against each other within a two mile radius of its\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe grass forests rustled betrayingly, but the Terrans displayed no\r\ninterest in those who spied upon them. An insect with wings of brilliant\r\ngreen gauze detached itself from the stalk of a grass tree and fluttered\r\nahead of the Traders as if it were an official herald. From the red soil\r\ncrushed by their boots arose a pungent odor which fought with the scent\r\nthey carried with them. Dane swallowed three or four times and hoped that\r\nhis superior officer had not noticed that sign of discomfort. Though Van\r\nRycke, in spite of his general air of sleepy benevolence and careless\r\ngoodwill, noticed everything, no matter how trivial, which might have a\r\nbearing on the delicate negotiations of Galactic Trade. He had not\r\nclimbed to his present status of expert Cargo-master by overlooking\r\nanything at all. Now he gave an order:\r\n\r\n\"Take an equalizer--\"\r\n\r\nDane reached for his belt pouch, flushing, fiercely determined inside\r\nhimself, that no matter how smells warred about him that day, he was not\r\ngoing to let it bother him. He swallowed the tiny pellet Medic Tau had\r\nprepared for just such trials and tried to occupy his mind with the work\r\nto come. If there would be any work--or would another long day be wasted\r\nin futile speeches of mutual esteem which gave formal lip service to\r\nTrade and its manifest benefits?\r\n\r\n\"Houuuu--\" The cry which was half wail, half arrogant warning, sounded\r\nalong the road behind them.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke's stride did not vary. He did not turn his head, show any sign\r\nhe had heard that heralding fanfare for a clan chieftain. And he\r\ncontinued to keep to the exact center of the road, Dane the regulation\r\none pace to the rear and left as befitted his lower rank.\r\n\r\n\"Houuu--\" that blast from the throat of a Salarik especially chosen for\r\nhis lung power was accompanied now by the hollow drum of many feet. The\r\nTerrans neither looked around nor withdrew from the center, nor did their\r\npace quicken.\r\n\r\nThat, too, was in order, Dane knew. To the rank conscious Salariki\r\nclansmen you did not yield precedence unless you wanted at once to\r\nacknowledge your inferiority--and if you did that by some slip of\r\nadmission or omission, there was no use in trying to treat face to face\r\nwith their chieftains again.\r\n\r\n\"Houuu--!\" The blast behind was a scream as the retinue it announced\r\nswept around the bend in the road to catch sight of the two Traders\r\noblivious of it. Dane longed to be able to turn his head, just enough to\r\nsee which one of the local lordlings they blocked.\r\n\r\n\"Houu--\" there was a questioning note in the cry now and the heavy\r\nthud-thud of feet was slacking. The clan party had seen them, were\r\nhesitant about the wisdom of trying to shove them aside.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke marched steadily onward and Dane matched his pace. They might\r\nnot possess a leather-lunged herald to clear their road, but they gave\r\nevery indication of having the right to occupy as much of it as they\r\nwished. And that unruffled poise had its affect upon those behind. The\r\npound of feet slowed to a walk, a walk which would keep a careful\r\ndistance behind the two Terrans. It had worked--the Salariki--or these\r\nSalariki--were accepting them at their own valuation--a good omen for the\r\nday's business. Dane's spirits rose, but he schooled his features into a\r\nmask as wooden as his superior's. After all this was a very minor victory\r\nand they had ten or twelve hours of polite, and hidden, maneuvering\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nThe Solar Queen had set down as closely as possible to the trading center\r\nmarked on Traxt Cam's private map and the Terrans now had another five\r\nminutes march, in the middle of the road, ahead of the chieftain who must\r\nbe inwardly boiling at their presence, before they came out in the\r\nclearing containing the roofless, circular erection which served the\r\nSalariki of the district as a market place and a common meeting ground\r\nfor truce talks and the mending of private clan alliances. Erect on a\r\npole in the middle, towering well above the nodding fronds of the grass\r\ntrees, was the pole bearing the trade shield which promised not only\r\npeace to those under it, but a three day sanctuary to any feuder or\r\nduelist who managed to win to it and lay hands upon its weathered\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\nThey were not the first to arrive, which was also a good thing. Gathered\r\nin small groups about the walls of the council place were the personal\r\nattendants, liege warriors, and younger relatives of at least four or\r\nfive clan chieftains. But, Dane noted at once, there was not a single\r\ncurtained litter or riding orgel to be seen. None of the feminine part of\r\nthe Salariki species had arrived. Nor would they until the final trade\r\ntreaty was concluded and established by their fathers, husbands, or sons.\r\n\r\nWith the assurance of one who was master in his own clan, Van Rycke,\r\ndisplaying no interest at all in the shifting mass of lower rank\r\nSalariki, marched straight on to the door of the enclosure. Two or three\r\nof the younger warriors got to their feet, their brilliant cloaks\r\nflicking out like spreading wings. But when Van Rycke did not even lift\r\nan eyelid in their direction, they made no move to block his path.\r\n\r\nAs fighting men, Dane thought, trying to study the specimens before him\r\nwith a totally impersonal stare, the Salariki were an impressive lot.\r\nTheir average height was close to six feet, their distant feline ancestry\r\napparent only in small vestiges. A Salarik's nails on both hands and feet\r\nwere retractile, his skin was gray, his thick hair, close to the texture\r\nof plushy fur, extended down his backbone and along the outside of his\r\nwell muscled arms and legs, and was tawny-yellow, blue-gray or white. To\r\nTerran eyes the broad faces, now all turned in their direction, lacked\r\nreadable expression. The eyes were large and set slightly aslant in the\r\nskull, being startlingly orange-red or a brilliant turquoise green-blue.\r\nThey wore loin cloths of brightly dyed fabrics with wide sashes forming\r\ncorselets about their slender middles, from which gleamed the gem-set\r\nhilts of their claw knives, the possession of which proved their\r\nadulthood. Cloaks as flamboyant as their other garments hung in bat wing\r\nfolds from their shoulders and each and every one moved in an invisible\r\ncloud of perfume.\r\n\r\nBrilliant as the assemblage of liege men without had been, the gathering\r\nof clan leaders and their upper officers within the council place was a\r\nriot of color--and odor. The chieftains were installed on the wooden\r\nstools, each with a small table before him on which rested a goblet\r\nbearing his own clan sign, a folded strip of patterned cloth--his \"trade\r\nshield\"--and a gemmed box containing the scented paste he would use for\r\nrefreshment during the ordeal of conference.\r\n\r\nA breeze fluttered sash ends and tugged at cloaks, otherwise the assembly\r\nwas motionless and awesomely quiet. Still making no overtures Van Rycke\r\ncrossed to a stool and table which stood a little apart and seated\r\nhimself. Dane went into the action required of him. Before his superior\r\nhe set out a plastic pocket flask, its color as alive in the sunlight as\r\nthe crudely cut gems which the Salariki sported, a fine silk\r\nhandkerchief, and, last of all, a bottle of Terran smelling salts\r\nprovided by Medic Tau as a necessary restorative after some hours\r\ncombination of Salariki oratory and Salariki perfumes. Having thus done\r\nthe duty of liege man, Dane was at liberty to seat himself, cross-legged\r\non the ground behind his chief, as the other sons, heirs, and advisors\r\nhad gathered behind their lords.\r\n\r\nThe chieftain whose arrival they had in a manner delayed came in after\r\nthem and Dane saw that it was Fashdor--another piece of luck--since that\r\nclan was a small one and the chieftain had little influence. Had they so\r\nslowed Halfer or Paft it might be a different matter altogether.\r\n\r\nFashdor was established at his seat, his belongings spread out, and Dane,\r\ncounting unobtrusively, was certain that the council was now complete.\r\nSeven clans Traxt Cam had recorded divided the sea coast territory and\r\nthere were seven chieftains here--indicative of the importance of this\r\nmeeting since some of these clans beyond the radius of the shield peace,\r\nmust be fighting a vicious blood feud at that very moment. Yes, seven\r\nwere here. Yet there still remained a single stool, directly across the\r\ncircle from Van Rycke. An empty stool--who was the late comer?\r\n\r\nThat question was answered almost as it flashed into Dane's mind. But no\r\nSalariki lordling came through the door. Dane's self-control kept him in\r\nhis place, even after he caught the meaning of the insignia emblazoned\r\nacross the newcomer's tunic. Trader--and not only a Trader but a Company\r\nman! But why--and how? The Companies only went after big game--this was a\r\nplanet thrown open to Free Traders, the independents of the star lanes.\r\nBy law and right no Company man had any place here. Unless--behind a face\r\nDane strove to keep as impassive as Van's his thoughts raced. Traxt Cam\r\nas a Free Trader had bid for the right to exploit Sargol when its sole\r\nexportable product was deemed to be perfume--a small, unimportant trade\r\nas far as the Companies were concerned. And then the Koros stones had\r\nbeen found and the importance of Sargol must have boomed as far as the\r\nbig boys could see. They probably knew of Traxt Cam's death as soon as\r\nthe Patrol report on Limbo had been sent to Headquarters. The Companies\r\nall maintained their private information and espionage services. And,\r\nwith Traxt Cam dead without an heir, they had seen their chance and moved\r\nin. Only, Dane's teeth set firmly, they didn't have the ghost of a chance\r\nnow. Legally there was only one Trader on Sargol and that was the Solar\r\nQueen, Captain Jellico had his records signed by the Patrol to prove\r\nthat. And all this Inter-Solar man would do now was to bow out and try\r\npoaching elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut the I-S man appeared to be in no haste to follow that only possible\r\ncourse. He was seating himself with arrogant dignity on that unoccupied\r\nstool, and a younger man in I-S uniform was putting before him the same\r\ntype of equipment Dane had produced for Van Rycke. The Cargo-master of\r\nthe Solar Queen showed no surprise, if the Eysies' appearance had been\r\nsuch to him.\r\n\r\nOne of the younger warriors in Paft's train got to his feet and brought\r\nhis hands together with a clap which echoed across the silent gathering\r\nwith the force of an archaic solid projectal shot. A Salarik, wearing the\r\nrich dress of the upper ranks, but also the collar forced upon a captive\r\ntaken in combat, came into the enclosure carrying a jug in both hands.\r\nPreceded by Paft's son he made the rounds of the assembly pouring a\r\npurple liquid from his jug into the goblet before each chieftain, a\r\ngoblet which Paft's heirs tasted ceremoniously before it was presented to\r\nthe visiting clan leader. When they paused before Van Rycke the Salarik\r\nnobleman touched the side of the plasta flask in token. It was recognized\r\nthat off world men must be cautious over the sampling of local products\r\nand that when they joined in the Taking of the First Cup of Peace, they\r\ndid so symbolically.\r\n\r\nPaft raised his cup, his gesture copied by everyone around the circle. In\r\nthe harsh tongue of his race he repeated a formula so archaic that few of\r\nthe Salariki could now translate the sing-song words. They drank and the\r\nmeeting was formally opened.\r\n\r\nBut it was an elderly Salarik seated to the right of Halfer, a man who\r\nwore no claw knife and whose dusky yellow cloak and sash made a subdued\r\nnote amid the splendor of his fellows, who spoke first, using the\r\nclick-clack of the Trade Lingo his nation had learned from Cam.\r\n\r\n\"Under the white,\" he pointed to the shield aloft, \"we assemble to hear\r\nmany things. But now come two tongues to speak where once there was but\r\none father of a clan. Tell us, outlanders, which of you must we now hark\r\nto in truth?\" He looked from Van Rycke to the I-S representative.\r\n\r\nThe Cargo-master from the Queen did not reply. He stared across the\r\ncircle at the Company man. Dane waited eagerly. What _was_ the I-S going\r\nto say to that?\r\n\r\nBut the fellow did have an answer, ready and waiting. \"It is true,\r\nfathers of clans, that here are two voices, where by right and custom\r\nthere should only be one. But this is a matter which can be decided\r\nbetween us. Give us leave to withdraw from your sight and speak privately\r\ntogether. Then he who returns to you will be the true voice and there\r\nshall be no more division--\"\r\n\r\nIt was Paft who broke in before Halfer's spokesman could reply.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been better to have spoken together before you came to us.\r\nGo then until the shadow of the shield is not, then return hither and\r\nspeak truly. We do not wait upon the pleasure of outlanders--\"\r\n\r\nA murmur approved that tart comment. \"Until the shadow of the shield is\r\nnot.\" They had until noon. Van Rycke arose and Dane gathered up his\r\nchief's possessions. With the same superiority to his surroundings he had\r\nshown upon entering, the Cargo-master left the enclosure, the Eysies\r\nfollowing. But they were away from the clearing, out upon the road back\r\nto the Queen before the two from the Company caught up with them.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Grange will see you right away--\" the Eysie Cargo-master was\r\nbeginning when Van Rycke met him with a quelling stare.\r\n\r\n\"If you poachers have anything to say--you say it at the Queen and to\r\nCaptain Jellico,\" he stated flatly and started on.\r\n\r\nAbove his tight tunic collar the other's face flushed, his teeth flashed\r\nas he caught his lower lip between them as if to forcibly restrain an\r\nanswer he longed to make. For a second he hesitated and then he vanished\r\ndown a side path with his assistant. Van Rycke had gone a quarter of the\r\ndistance back to the ship before he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was too easy,\" he muttered. \"Now we're in for it--maybe\r\nright up the rockets! By the Spiked Tail of Exol, this is certainly _not_\r\nour lucky day!\" He quickened pace until they were close to trotting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nRIVALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That's far enough, Eysie!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Traders by law and tradition carried no more potent personal\r\nweapons--except in times of great crisis--than hand sleep rods, the\r\nresultant shot from the latter was just as unpleasant for temporary\r\nperiods as a more forceful beam--and the threat of it was enough to halt\r\nthe three men who had come to the foot of the Queen's ramp and who could\r\nsee the rod held rather negligently by Ali. Ali's eyes were anything but\r\nnegligent, however, and Free Traders had reputations to be respected by\r\ntheir rivals of the Companies. The very nature of their roving lives\r\ntaught them savage lessons--which they either learned or died.\r\n\r\nDane, glancing down over the Engineer-apprentice's shoulder, saw that Van\r\nRycke's assumption of confidence had indeed paid off. They had left the\r\ntrade enclosure of the Salariki barely three-quarters of an hour ago. But\r\nbelow now stood the bebadged Captain of the I-S ship and his\r\nCargo-master.\r\n\r\n\"I want to speak to your Captain--\" snarled the Eysie officer.\r\n\r\nAli registered faint amusement, an expression which tended to rouse the\r\nworst in the spectator, as Dane knew of old when that same mocking\r\nappraisal had been turned on him as the rawest of the Queen's crew.\r\n\r\n\"But does _he_ wish to speak to you?\" countered Kamil. \"Just stay where\r\nyou are, Eysie, until we are sure about that fact.\"\r\n\r\nThat was his cue to act as messenger. Dane retreated into the ship and\r\nswung up the ladder to the command section. As he passed Captain\r\nJellico's private cabin he heard the muffled squall of the commander's\r\nunpleasant pet--Queex, the Hoobat--a nightmare combination of crab,\r\nparrot and toad, wearing a blue feather coating and inclined to scream\r\nand spit at all comers. Since Queex would not be howling in that fashion\r\nif its master was present, Dane kept on to the control cabin where he\r\nblundered in upon an executive level conference of Captain, Cargo-master\r\nand Astrogator.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" Jellico's blaster scarred left cheek twitched as he snapped that\r\nimpatient inquiry at the messenger.\r\n\r\n\"Eysie Captain below, sir. With his Cargo-master. They want to see you--\"\r\n\r\nJellico's mouth was a straight line, his eyes very hard. By instinct\r\nDane's hand went to the grip of the sleep rod slung at his belt. When the\r\nOld Man put on his fighting face--look out! Here we go again, he told\r\nhimself, speculating as to just what type of action lay before them now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they do, do they!\" Jellico began and then throttled down the temper\r\nhe could put under iron control when and if it were necessary. \"Very\r\nwell, tell them to stay where they are. Van, we'll go down--\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the Cargo-master hesitated, his heavy-lidded eyes looked\r\nsleepy, he seemed almost disinterested in the suggestion. And when he\r\nnodded it was with the air of someone about to perform some boring duty.\r\n\r\n\"Right, sir.\" He wriggled his heavy body from behind the small table,\r\nresealed his tunic, and settled his cap with as much precision as if he\r\nwere about to represent the Queen before the assembled nobility of\r\nSargol.\r\n\r\nDane hurried down the ladders, coming to a halt beside Ali. It was the\r\nturn of the man at the foot of the ramp to bark an impatient demand:\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" (Was that the theme word of every Captain's vocabulary?)\r\n\r\n\"You wait,\" Dane replied with no inclination to give the Eysie officer\r\nany courtesy address. Close to a Terran year aboard the Solar Queen had\r\ninoculated him with pride in his own section of Service. A Free Trader\r\nwas answerable to his own officers and to no one else on earth--or among\r\nthe stars--no matter how much discipline and official etiquette the\r\nCompanies used to enhance their power.\r\n\r\nHe half expected the I-S officers to leave after an answer such as that.\r\nFor a Company Captain to be forced to wait upon the convenience of a Free\r\nTrader must be galling in the extreme. And the fact that this one was\r\ndoing just that was an indication that the Queen's crew did, perhaps,\r\nhave the edge of advantage in any coming bargain. In the meantime the\r\nEysie contingent fumed below while Ali lounged whistling against the exit\r\nport, playing with his sleep rod and Dane studied the grass forest. His\r\nboot nudged a packet just inside the port casing and he glanced\r\ninquiringly from it to Ali.\r\n\r\n\"Cat ransom,\" the other answered his unspoken question.\r\n\r\nSo that was it--the fee for Sinbad's return. \"What is it today?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sugar--about a tablespoon full,\" the Engineer-assistant returned, \"and\r\ntwo colored steelos. So far they haven't run up the price on us. I think\r\nthey're sharing out the spoil evenly, a new cub brings him back every\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nAs did all Terran ships, the Solar Queen carried a cat as an important\r\nmember of the regular crew. And the portly Sinbad, before their landing\r\non Sargol, had never presented any problem. He had done his duty of\r\nridding the ship of unusual and usual pests and cargo despoilers with\r\ndispatch, neatness and energy. And when in port on alien worlds had never\r\nshown any inclination to go a-roving.\r\n\r\nBut the scents of Sargol had apparently intoxicated him, shearing away\r\nhis solid dignity and middle-aged dependability. Now Sinbad flashed out\r\nof the Queen at the opening of her port in the early morning and was\r\nbrought back, protesting with both voice and claws, at the end of the day\r\nby that member of the juvenile population whose turn it was to collect\r\nthe standing reward for his forceful delivery. Within three days it had\r\nbecome an accepted business transaction which satisfied everyone but\r\nSinbad.\r\n\r\nThe scrape of metal boot soles on ladder rungs warned of the arrival of\r\ntheir officers. Ali and Dane withdrew down the corridor, leaving the\r\nentrance open for Jellico and Van Rycke. Then they drifted back to\r\nwitness the meeting with the Eysies.\r\n\r\nThere were no prolonged greetings between the two parties, no offer of\r\nhospitality as might have been expected between Terrans on an alien\r\nplanet a quarter of the Galaxy away from the earth which had given them a\r\ncommon heritage.\r\n\r\nJellico, with Van Rycke at his shoulder, halted before he stepped from\r\nthe ramp so that the three Inter-Solar men, Captain, Cargo-master and\r\nescort, whether they wished or no, were put in the disadvantageous\r\nposition of having to look up to a Captain whom they, as members of one\r\nof the powerful Companies, affected to despise. The lean, well muscled,\r\ntrim figure of the Queen's commander gave the impression of hard bitten\r\nforce held in check by will control, just as his face under its thick\r\nlayer of space burn was that of an adventurer accustomed to make split\r\nsecond decisions--an estimate underlined by that seam of blaster burn\r\nacross one flat cheek.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke, with a slight change of dress, could have been a Company man\r\nin the higher ranks--or so the casual observer would have placed him,\r\nuntil an observer marked the eyes behind those sleepy drooping lids, or\r\ncaught a certain note in the calm, unhurried drawl of his voice. To look\r\nat the two senior officers of the Free Trading spacer were the antithesis\r\nof each other--in action they were each half of a powerful, steamroller\r\nwhole--as a good many men in the Service--scattered over a half dozen or\r\nso planets--had discovered to their cost in the past.\r\n\r\nNow Jellico brought the heels of his space boots together with an\r\nextravagant click and his hand flourished at the fore of his helmet in a\r\ngesture which was better suited to the Patrol hero of a slightly\r\nout-of-date Video serial.\r\n\r\n\"Jellico, Solar Queen, Free Trader,\" he identified himself brusquely, and\r\nadded, \"this is Van Rycke, our Cargo-master.\"\r\n\r\nNot all the flush had faded from the face of the I-S Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Grange of the Dart,\" he did not even sketch a salute. \"Inter-Solar.\r\nKallee, Cargo-master--\" And he did not name the hovering third member of\r\nhis party.\r\n\r\nJellico stood waiting and after a long moment of silence Grange was\r\nforced to state his business.\r\n\r\n\"We have until noon--\"\r\n\r\nJellico, his fingers hooked in his belt, simply waited. And under his\r\nlevel gaze the Eysie Captain began to find the going hard.\r\n\r\n\"They have given us until noon,\" he started once more, \"to get\r\ntogether--\"\r\n\r\nJellico's voice came, coldly remote. \"There is no reason for any 'getting\r\ntogether,' Grange. By rights I can have you up before the Trade Board for\r\npoaching. The Solar Queen has sole trading rights here. If you up-ship\r\nwithin a reasonable amount of time, I'll be inclined to let it pass.\r\nAfter all I've no desire to run all the way to the nearest Patrol post to\r\nreport you--\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't expect to buck Inter-Solar. We'll make you an offer--\" That\r\nwas Kallee's contribution, made probably because his commanding officer\r\ncouldn't find words explosive enough.\r\n\r\nJellico, whose fortÃ© was more direct action, took an excursion into\r\nheavy-handed sarcasm. \"You Eysies have certainly been given excellent\r\nbriefing. I would advise a little closer study of the Code--and not the\r\nsections in small symbols at the end of the tape, either! _We're_ not\r\nbucking anyone. You'll find our registration for Sargol down on tapes at\r\nthe Center. And I suggest that the sooner you withdraw the better--before\r\nwe cite you for illegal planeting.\"\r\n\r\nGrange had gained control of his emotions. \"We're pretty far from Center\r\nhere,\" he remarked. It was a statement of fact, but it carried over-tones\r\nwhich they were able to assess correctly. The Solar Queen was a Free\r\nTrader, alone on an alien world. But the I-S ship might be cruising in\r\ncompany, ready to summon aid, men and supplies. Dane drew a deep breath,\r\nthe Eysies _must_ be sure of themselves, not only that, but they must\r\nwant what Sargol had to offer to the point of being willing to step\r\noutside the law to get it.\r\n\r\nThe I-S Captain took a step forward. \"I think we understand each other\r\nnow,\" he said, his confidence restored.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke answered him, his deep voice cutting across the sighing of the\r\nwind in the grass forest.\r\n\r\n\"Your proposition?\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this return to their implied threat bolstered their belief in the\r\ninfallibility of the Company, their conviction that no independent dared\r\nstand up against the might and power of Inter-Solar. Kallee replied:\r\n\r\n\"We'll take up your contract, at a profit to you, and you up-ship before\r\nthe Salariki are confused over whom they are to deal with--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the amount of profit?\" Van Rycke bored in.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" Kallee shrugged, \"say ten percent of Cam's last shipment--\"\r\n\r\nJellico laughed. \"Generous, aren't you, Eysie? Ten percent of a cargo\r\nwhich can't be assessed--the gang on Limbo kept no records of what they\r\nplundered.\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know what he was carrying when he crashed on Limbo,\" countered\r\nKallee swiftly. \"We'll base our offer on what he carried to Axal.\"\r\n\r\nNow Van Rycke chucked. \"I wonder who figured that one out?\" he inquired\r\nof the scented winds. \"He must save the Company a fair amount of credits\r\none way or another. Interesting offer--\"\r\n\r\nBy the bland satisfaction to be read on the three faces below the I-S men\r\nwere assured of their victory. The Solar Queen would be paid off with a\r\npittance, under the vague threat of Company retaliation she would\r\nup-ship from Sargol, and they would be left in possession of the rich\r\nKoros trade--to be commended and rewarded by their superiors. Had they,\r\nDane speculated, ever had any dealings with Free Traders before--at least\r\nwith the brand of independent adventurers such as manned the Solar Queen?\r\n\r\nVan Rycke burrowed in his belt pouch and then held out his hand. On the\r\nbroad palm lay a flat disc of metal. \"Very interesting--\" he repeated. \"I\r\nshall treasure this recording--\"\r\n\r\nThe sight of that disc wiped all satisfaction from the Eysie faces.\r\nGrange's purplish flush spread up from his tight tunic collar, Kallee\r\nblinked, and the unknown third's hand dropped to his sleep rod. An action\r\nwhich was not overlooked by either Dane or Ali.\r\n\r\n\"A smooth set down to you,\" Jellico gave the conventional leave taking of\r\nthe Service.\r\n\r\n\"You'd better--\" the Eysie Captain began hotly, and then seeing the disc\r\nVan Rycke held--that sensitive bit of metal and plastic which was\r\nrecording this interview for future reference, he shut his mouth tight.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" the Queen's Cargo-master prompted politely. But Kallee had taken\r\nhis Captain's arm and was urging Grange away from the spacer.\r\n\r\n\"You have until noon to lift,\" was Jellico's parting shot as the three in\r\nCompany livery started toward the road.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that they will,\" he added to Van Rycke.\r\n\r\nThe Cargo-master nodded. \"You wouldn't in their place,\" he pointed out\r\nreasonably. \"On the other hand they've had a bit of a blast they weren't\r\nexpecting. It's been a long time since Grange heard anyone say 'no.'\"\r\n\r\n\"A shock which is going to wear off,\" Jellico's habitual distrust of the\r\nfuture gathered force.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" Van Rycke tucked the disc back into his pouch, \"sent them off\r\nvector a parsec or two. Grange is not one of the strong arm blaster\r\nboys. Suppose Tang Ya does a little listening in--and maybe we can rig\r\nanother surprise if Grange does try to ask advice of someone off world.\r\nIn the meantime I don't think they are going to meddle with the Salariki.\r\nThey don't want to have to answer awkward questions if _we_ turn up a\r\nPatrol ship to ask them. So--\" he stretched and beckoned to Dane, \"we\r\nshall go to work once more.\"\r\n\r\nAgain two paces behind Van Rycke Dane tramped to the trade circle of the\r\nSalariki clansmen. They might have walked out only five or six minutes of\r\nship time before, and the natives betrayed no particular interest in\r\ntheir return. But, Dane noted, there was only one empty stool, one\r\nceremonial table in evidence. The Salariki had expected only one Terran\r\nTrader to join them.\r\n\r\nWhat followed was a dreary round of ceremony, an exchange of platitudes\r\nand empty good wishes and greetings. No one mentioned Koros stones--or\r\neven perfume bark--that he was willing to offer the off-world traders.\r\nNone lifted so much as a corner of his trade cloth, under which, if he\r\nwere ready to deal seriously, his hidden hand would meet that of the\r\nbuyer, so that by finger pressure alone they could agree or disagree on\r\nprice. But such boring sessions were part of Trade and Dane, keeping a\r\nfraction of attention on the speeches and \"drinkings-together,\" watched\r\nthose around him with an eye which tried to assess and classify what he\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of the Salariki character was a wary independence. The only\r\nform of government they would tolerate was a family-clan organization.\r\nFeuds and deadly duels between individuals and clans were the accepted\r\nway of life and every male who reached adulthood went armed and ready for\r\ncombat until he became a \"Speaker for the past\"--too old to bear arms in\r\nthe field. Due to the nature of their battling lives, relatively few of\r\nthe Salariki ever reached that retirement. Short-lived alliances between\r\nfamilies sometimes occurred, usually when they were to face a common\r\nenemy greater than either. But a quarrel between chieftains, a fancied\r\ninsult would rip that open in an instant. Only under the Trade Shield\r\ncould seven clans sit this way without their warriors being at one\r\nanother's furred throats.\r\n\r\nAn hour before sunset Paft turned his goblet upside down on his table, a\r\nmove followed speedily by every chieftain in the circle. The conference\r\nwas at an end for that day. And as far as Dane could see it had\r\naccomplished exactly nothing--except to bring the Eysies into the open.\r\nWhat _had_ Traxt Cam discovered which had given him the trading contract\r\nwith these suspicious aliens? Unless the men from the Queen learned it,\r\nthey could go on talking until the contract ran out and get no farther\r\nthan they had today.\r\n\r\nFrom his training Dane knew that ofttimes contact with an alien race did\r\nrequire long and patient handling. But between study and experiencing the\r\nsituation himself there was a gulf, and he thought somewhat ruefully that\r\nhe had much to learn before he could meet such a situation with Van\r\nRycke's unfailing patience and aplomb. The Cargo-master seemed in nowise\r\ntired by his wasted day and Dane knew that Van would probably sit up half\r\nthe night, going over for the hundredth time Traxt Cam's sketchy\r\nrecordings in another painstaking attempt to discover why and how the\r\nother Free Trader had succeeded where the Queen's men were up against a\r\nstone wall.\r\n\r\nThe harvesting of Koros stones was, as Dane and all those who had been\r\nbriefed from Cam's records knew, a perilous job. Though the rule of the\r\nSalariki was undisputed on the land masses of Sargol, it was another\r\nmatter in the watery world of the shallow seas. There the Gorp were in\r\ncommand of the territory and one had to be constantly alert for attack\r\nfrom the sly, reptilian intelligence, so alien to the thinking processes\r\nof both Salariki and Terran that there was, or seemed to be, no point of\r\npossible contact. One went gathering Koros gems after balancing life\r\nagainst gain. And perhaps the Salariki did not see any profit in that\r\noperation. Yet Traxt Cam had brought back his bag of gems--somehow he had\r\nmanaged to secure them in trade.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke climbed the ramp, hurrying on into the Queen as if he would not\r\nget back to his records soon enough. But Dane paused and looked back at\r\nthe grass jungle a little wistfully. To his mind these early morning\r\nhours were the best time on Sargol. The light was golden, the night winds\r\nhad not yet arisen. He disliked exchanging the freedom of the open for\r\nthe confinement of the spacer.\r\n\r\nAnd, as he hesitated there, two of the juvenile population of Sargol came\r\nout of the forest. Between them they carried one of their hunting nets, a\r\nnet which now enclosed a quiet but baneful eyed captive--Sinbad being\r\ndelivered for nightly ransom. Dane was reaching for the pay to give the\r\ncaptors when, to his real astonishment, one of them advanced and pointed\r\nwith an extended forefinger claw to the open port.\r\n\r\n\"Go in,\" he formed the Trade Lingo words with care. And Dane's surprise\r\nmust have been plain to read for the cub followed his speech with a\r\nvigorous nod and set one foot on the ramp to underline his desire.\r\n\r\nFor one of the Salariki, who had continually manifested their belief that\r\nTerrans and their ship were an offence to the nostrils of all right\r\nliving \"men,\" to wish to enter the spacer was an astonishing about-face.\r\nBut any advantage no matter how small, which might bring about a closer\r\nunderstanding, must be seized at once.\r\n\r\nDane accepted the growling Sinbad and beckoned, knowing better than to\r\ntouch the boy. \"Come--\"\r\n\r\nOnly one of the junior clansmen obeyed that invitation. The other\r\nwatched, big-eyed, and then scuttled back to the forest when his fellow\r\ncalled out some suggestion. _He_ was not going to be trapped.\r\n\r\nDane led the way up the ramp, paying no visible attention to the young\r\nSalarik, nor did he urge the other on when he lingered for a long moment\r\nor two at the port. In his mind the Cargo-master apprentice was\r\nfeverishly running over the list of general trade goods. What _did_ they\r\ncarry which would make a suitable and intriguing gift for a small alien\r\nwith such a promising bump of curiosity? If he had only time to get Van\r\nRycke!\r\n\r\nThe Salarik was inside the corridor now, his nostrils spread, assaying\r\neach and every odor in this strange place. Suddenly his head jerked as if\r\ntugged by one of his own net ropes. His interest had been riveted by some\r\nscent his sensitive senses had detected. His eyes met Dane's in appeal.\r\nSwiftly the Terran nodded and then followed with a lengthened stride as\r\nthe Salarik sped down into the lower reaches of the Queen, obviously in\r\nquest of something of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nCONTACT AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What in\"--Frank Mura, steward, storekeeper, and cook of the Queen,\r\nretreated into the nearest cabin doorway as the young Salarik flashed\r\ndown the ladder into his section.\r\n\r\nDane, with the now resigned Sinbad in the crook of his arm, had tailed\r\nhis guest and arrived just in time to see the native come to an abrupt\r\nhalt before one of the most important doors in the spacer--the portal of\r\nthe hydro garden which renewed the ship's oxygen and supplied them with\r\nfresh fruit and vegetables to vary their diet of concentrates.\r\n\r\nThe Salarik laid one hand on the smooth surface of the sealed compartment\r\nand looked back over his shoulder at Dane with an inquiry to which was\r\nadded something of a plea. Guided by his instinct--that this was\r\nimportant to them all--Dane spoke to Mura:\r\n\r\n\"Can you let him in there, Frank?\"\r\n\r\nIt was not sensible, it might even be dangerous. But every member of the\r\ncrew knew the necessity for making some sort of contact with the natives.\r\nMura did not even nod, but squeezed by the Salarik and pressed the lock.\r\nThere was a sign of air, and the crisp smell of growing things, lacking\r\nthe languorous perfumes of the world outside, puffed into the faces.\r\n\r\nThe cub remained where he was, his head up, his wide nostrils visibly\r\ndrinking in that smell. Then he moved with the silent, uncanny speed\r\nwhich was the heritage of his race, darting down the narrow aisle toward\r\na mass of greenery at the far end.\r\n\r\nSinbad kicked and growled. This was his private hunting ground--the\r\npreserve he kept free of invaders. Dane put the cat down. The Salarik had\r\nfound what he was seeking. He stood on tiptoe to sniff at a plant, his\r\nyellow eyes half closed, his whole stance spelling ecstasy. Dane looked\r\nto the steward for enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\"What's he so interested in, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Catnip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catnip?\" Dane repeated. The word meant nothing to him, but Mura had a\r\nhabit of picking up strange plants and cultivating them for study. \"What\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of the Terran mints--an herb,\" Mura gave a short explanation as he\r\nmoved down the aisle toward the alien. He broke off a leaf and crushed it\r\nbetween his fingers.\r\n\r\nDane, his sense of smell largely deadened by the pungency with which he\r\nhad been surrounded by most of that day, could distinguish no new odor.\r\nBut the young Salarik swung around to face the steward his eyes wide, his\r\nnose questing. And Sinbad gave a whining yowl and made a spring to push\r\nhis head against the steward's now aromatic hand.\r\n\r\nSo--now they had it--an opening wedge. Dane came up to the three.\r\n\r\n\"All right to take a leaf or two?\" he asked Mura.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I grow it for Sinbad. To a cat it is like heemel smoke or a\r\ntankard of lackibod.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by Sinbad's actions Dane guessed that the plant did hold for the cat\r\nthe same attraction those stimulants produced in human beings. He\r\ncarefully broke off a small stem supporting three leaves and presented it\r\nto the Salarik, who stared at him and then, snatching the twig, raced\r\nfrom the hydro garden as if pursued by feuding clansmen.\r\n\r\nDane heard the pad of his feet on the ladder--apparently the cub was\r\nmaking sure of escape with his precious find. But the Cargo-master\r\napprentice was frowning. As far as he could see there were only five of\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\n\"That's all the catnip you have?\"\r\n\r\nMura tucked Sinbad under his arm and shooed Dane before him out of the\r\nhydro. \"There was no need to grow more. A small portion of the herb goes\r\na long way with this one,\" he put the cat down in the corridor. \"The\r\nleaves may be preserved by drying. I believe that there is a small box of\r\nthem in the galley.\"\r\n\r\nA strictly limited supply. Suppose this was the key which would unlock\r\nthe Koros trade? And yet it was to be summed up in five plants and a few\r\ndried leaves! However, Van Rycke must know of this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBut to Dane's growing discomfiture the Cargo-master showed no elation as\r\nhis junior poured out the particulars of his discovery. Instead there\r\nwere definite signs of displeasure to be read by those who knew Van Rycke\r\nwell. He heard Dane out and then got to his feet. Tolling the younger man\r\nwith him by a crooked finger, he went out of his combined office-living\r\nquarters to the domain of Medic Craig Tau.\r\n\r\n\"Problem for you, Craig.\" Van Rycke seated his bulk on the wall jump seat\r\nTau pulled down for him. Dane was left standing just within the door,\r\nvery sure now that instead of being commended for his discovery of a few\r\nminutes before, he was about to suffer some reprimand. And the reason for\r\nit still eluded him.\r\n\r\n\"What do you know about that plant Mura grows in the hydro--the one\r\ncalled 'catnip'?\"\r\n\r\nTau did not appear surprised at that demand--the Medic of a Free Trading\r\nspacer was never surprised at anything. He had his surfeit of shocks\r\nduring his first years of service and after that accepted any occurrence,\r\nno matter how weird, as matter-of-fact. In addition Tau's hobby was\r\n\"magic,\" the hidden knowledge possessed and used by witch doctors and\r\nmedicine men on alien worlds. He had a library of recordings, odd scraps\r\nof information, of certified results of certain very peculiar\r\nexperiments. Now and then he wrote a report which was sent into Central\r\nService, read with raised eyebrows by perhaps half a dozen incredulous\r\ndesk warmers, and filed away to be safely forgotten. But even that had\r\nceased to frustrate him.\r\n\r\n\"It's an herb of the mint family from Terra,\" he replied. \"Mura grows it\r\nfor Sinbad--has quite a marked influence on cats. Frank's been trying to\r\nkeep him anchored to the ship by allowing him to roll in fresh leaves. He\r\ndoes it--then continues to sneak out whenever he can--\"\r\n\r\nThat explained something for Dane--why the Salariki cub wished to enter\r\nthe Queen tonight. Some of the scent of the plant had clung to Sinbad's\r\nfur, had been detected, and the Salarik had wanted to trace it to its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a drug?\" Van Rycke prodded.\r\n\r\n\"In the way that all herbs are drugs. Human beings have dosed themselves\r\nin the past with a tea made of the dried leaves. It has no great\r\nmedicinal properties. To felines it is a stimulation--and they get the\r\nsame satisfaction from rolling in and eating the leaves as we do from\r\ndrinking--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Salariki are, in a manner of speaking, felines--\" Van Rycke mused.\r\n\r\nTau straightened. \"The Salariki have discovered catnip, I take it?\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke nodded at Dane and for the second time the Cargo-master\r\napprentice made his report. When he was done Van Rycke asked a direct\r\nquestion of the medical officer:\r\n\r\n\"What effect would catnip have on a Salarik?\"\r\n\r\nIt was only then that Dane grasped the enormity of what he had done. They\r\nhad no way of gauging the influence of an off-world plant on alien\r\nmetabolism. What if he had introduced to the natives of Sargol a\r\ndangerous drug--started that cub on some path of addiction. He was cold\r\ninside. Why, he might even have poisoned the child!\r\n\r\nTau picked up his cap, and after a second's hesitation, his emergency\r\nmedical kit. He had only one question for Dane.\r\n\r\n\"Any idea of who the cub is--what clan he belongs to?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Dane, chill with real fear, was forced to answer in the negative.\r\nWhat _had_ he done!\r\n\r\n\"Can you find him?\" Van Rycke, ignoring Dane, spoke to Tau.\r\n\r\nThe Medic shrugged. \"I can try. I was out scouting this morning--met one\r\nof the storm priests who handles their medical work. But I wasn't\r\nwelcomed. However, under the circumstances, we have to try something--\"\r\n\r\nIn the corridor Van Rycke had an order for Dane. \"I suggest that you keep\r\nto quarters, Thorson, until we know how matters stand.\"\r\n\r\nDane saluted. That note in his superior's voice was like a whip\r\nlash--much worse to take than the abuse of a lesser man. He swallowed as\r\nhe shut himself into his own cramped cubby. This might be the end of\r\ntheir venture. And they would be lucky if their charter was not\r\nwithdrawn. Let I-S get an inkling of his rash action and the Company\r\nwould have them up before the Board to be stripped of all their rights\r\nin the Service. Just because of his own stupidity--his pride in being\r\nable to break through where Van Rycke and the Captain had faced a stone\r\nwall. And, worse than the future which could face the Queen, was the\r\nthought that he might have introduced some dangerous drug into Sargol\r\nwith his gift of those few leaves. When would he learn? He threw himself\r\nface down on his bunk and despondently pictured the string of calamities\r\nwhich could and maybe would stem from his thoughtless and hasty action.\r\n\r\nWithin the Queen night and day were mechanical--the lighting in the\r\ncabins did not vary much. Dane did not know how long he lay there forcing\r\nhis mind to consider his stupid action, making himself face that in the\r\nService there were no short cuts which endangered others--not unless\r\nthose taking the risks were Terrans.\r\n\r\n\"Dane--!\" Rip Shannon's voice cut through his self-imposed nightmare. But\r\nhe refused to answer. \"Dane--Van wants you on the double!\"\r\n\r\nWhy? To bring him up before Jellico probably. Dane schooled his\r\nexpression, got up, pulling his tunic straight, still unable to meet\r\nRip's eyes. Shannon was just one of those he had let down so badly. But\r\nthe other did not notice his mood. \"Wait 'til you see them--! Half Sargol\r\nmust be here yelling for trade!\"\r\n\r\nThat comment was so far from what he had been expecting that Dane was\r\nstartled out of his own gloomy thoughts. Rip's brown face was one wide\r\nsmile, his black eyes danced--it was plain he was honestly elated.\r\n\r\n\"Get a move on, fire rockets,\" he urged, \"or Van will blast you for\r\nfair!\"\r\n\r\nDane did move, up the ladder to the next level and out on the port ramp.\r\nWhat he saw below brought him up short. Evening had come to Sargol but\r\nthe scene immediately below was not in darkness. Blazing torches\r\nadvanced in lines from the grass forest and the portable flood light of\r\nthe spacer added to the general glare, turning night into noonday.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke and Jellico sat on stools facing at least five of the seven\r\nmajor chieftains with whom they had conferred to no purpose earlier. And\r\nbehind these leaders milled a throng of lesser Salariki. Yes, there was\r\nat least one carrying chair--and also an orgel from the back of which a\r\nveiled noblewoman was being assisted to dismount by two retainers. The\r\nwomen of the clans were coming--which could mean only that trade was at\r\nlast in progress. But trade for what?\r\n\r\nDane strode down the ramp. He saw Paft, his hand carefully covered by his\r\ntrade cloth, advance to Van Rycke, whose own fingers were decently veiled\r\nby a handkerchief. Under the folds of fabric their hands touched. The\r\nbargaining was in the first stages. And it was important enough for the\r\nclan leaders to conduct themselves. Where, according to Cam's records, it\r\nhad been usual to delegate that power to a favored liege man.\r\n\r\nCatching the light from the ship's beam and from the softer flares of the\r\nSalariki torches was a small pile of stones resting on a stool to one\r\nside. Dane drew a deep breath. He had heard the Koros stones described,\r\nhad seen the tri-dee print of one found among Cam's recordings but the\r\nreality was beyond his expectations. He knew the technical analysis of\r\nthe gems--that they were, as the amber of Terra, the fossilized resin\r\nexuded by ancient plants (maybe the ancestors of the grass trees) long\r\nburied in the saline deposits of the shallow seas where chemical changes\r\nhad taken place to produce the wonder jewels. In color they shaded from a\r\nrosy apricot to a rich mauve, but in their depths other colors, silver,\r\nfiery gold, spun sparks which seemed to move as the gem was turned.\r\nAnd--which was what first endeared them to the Salariki--when worn\r\nagainst the skin and warmed by body heat they gave off a perfume which\r\nenchanted not only the Sargolian natives but all in the Galaxy wealthy\r\nenough to own one.\r\n\r\nOn another stool placed at Van Rycke's right hand, as that bearing the\r\nKoros stones was at Paft's, was a transparent plastic box containing some\r\nwrinkled brownish leaves. Dane moved as unobtrusively as he could to his\r\nproper place at such a trading session, behind Van Rycke. More Salariki\r\nwere tramping out of the forest, torch bearing retainers and cloaked\r\nwarriors. A little to one side was a third party Dane had not seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThey were clustered about a staff which had been driven into the ground,\r\na staff topped with a white streamer marking a temporary trading ground.\r\nThese were Salariki right enough but they did not wear the colorful garb\r\nof those about them, instead they were all clad alike in muffling,\r\nsleeved robes of a drab green--the storm priests--their robes denoting\r\nthe color of the Sargolian sky just before the onslaught of their worst\r\ntempests. Cam had not left many clues concerning the religion of the\r\nSalariki, but the storm priests had, in narrowly defined limits, power,\r\nand their recognition of the Terran Traders would add to good feeling.\r\n\r\nIn the knot of storm priests a Terran stood--Medic Tau--and he was\r\ntalking earnestly with the leader of the religious party. Dane would have\r\ngiven much to have been free to cross and ask Tau a question or two. Was\r\nall this assembly the result of the discovery in the hydro? But even as\r\nhe asked himself that, the trade cloths were shaken from the hands of the\r\nbargainers and Van Rycke gave an order over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Measure out two spoonsful of the dried leaves into a box--\" he pointed\r\nto a tiny plastic container.\r\n\r\nWith painstaking care Dane followed directions. At the same time a\r\nservant of the Salarik chief swept the handful of gems from the other\r\nstool and dropped them in a heap before Van Rycke, who transferred them\r\nto a strong box resting between his feet. Paft arose--but he had hardly\r\nquitted the trading seat before one of the lesser clan leaders had taken\r\nhis place, the bargaining cloth ready looped loosely about his wrist.\r\n\r\nIt was at that point that the proceedings were interrupted. A new party\r\ncame into the open, their utilitarian Trade tunics made a drab blot as\r\nthey threaded their way in a compact group through the throng of\r\nSalariki. I-S men! So they had not lifted from Sargol.\r\n\r\nThey showed no signs of uneasiness--it was as if _their_ rights were\r\nbeing infringed by the Free Traders. And Kallee, their Cargo-master,\r\nswaggered straight to the bargaining point. The chatter of Salariki\r\nvoices was stilled, the Sargolians withdrew a little, letting one party\r\nof Terrans face the other, sensing drama to come. Neither Van Rycke nor\r\nJellico spoke, it was left to Kallee to state his case.\r\n\r\n\"You've crooked your orbit this time, bright boys,\" his jeer was a paean\r\nof triumph. \"Code Three--Article six--or can't you absorb rules tapes\r\nwith your thick heads?\"\r\n\r\nCode Three--Article six, Dane searched his memory for that law of the\r\nService. The words flashed into his mind as the auto-learner had planted\r\nthem during his first year of training back in the Pool.\r\n\r\n\"To no alien race shall any Trader introduce any drug, food, or drink\r\nfrom off world, until such a substance has been certified as nonharmful\r\nto the aliens.\"\r\n\r\nThere it was! I-S had them and it was all his fault. But if he had been\r\nso wrong, why in the world did Van Rycke sit there trading, condoning the\r\nerror and making it into a crime for which they could be summoned before\r\nthe Board and struck off the rolls of the Service?\r\n\r\nVan Rycke smiled gently. \"Code Four--Article two,\" he quoted with the\r\ngenial air of one playing gift-giver at a Forkidan feasting.\r\n\r\nCode Four, Article two: Any organic substance offered for trade must be\r\nexamined by a committee of trained medical experts, an equal\r\nrepresentation of Terrans and aliens.\r\n\r\nKallee's sneering smile did not vanish. \"Well,\" he challenged, \"where's\r\nyour board of experts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tau!\" Van Rycke called to the Medic with the storm priests. \"Will you\r\nask your colleague to be so kind as to allow the Cargo-master Kallee to\r\nbe presented?\"\r\n\r\nThe tall, dark young Terran Medic spoke to the priest beside him and\r\ntogether they came across the clearing. Van Rycke and Jellico both arose\r\nand inclined their heads in honor to the priests, as did the chief with\r\nwhom they had been about to deal.\r\n\r\n\"Reader of clouds and master of many winds,\" Tau's voice flowed with the\r\nmany voweled titles of the Sargolian, \"may I bring before your face\r\nCargo-master Kallee, a servant of Inter-Solar in the realm of Trade?\"\r\n\r\nThe storm priest's shaven skull and body gleamed steel gray in the light.\r\nHis eyes, of that startling blue-green, regarded the I-S party with\r\ncynical detachment.\r\n\r\n\"You wish of me?\" Plainly he was one who believed in getting down to\r\nessentials at once.\r\n\r\nKallee could not be overawed. \"These Free Traders have introduced among\r\nyour people a powerful drug which will bring much evil,\" he spoke slowly\r\nin simple words as if he were addressing a cub.\r\n\r\n\"You have evidence of such evil?\" countered the storm priest. \"In what\r\nmanner is this new plant evil?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kallee was disconcerted. But he rallied quickly. \"It has\r\nnot been tested--you do not know how it will affect your people--\"\r\n\r\nThe storm priest shook his head impatiently. \"We are not lacking in\r\nintelligence, Trader. This plant _has_ been tested, both by your master\r\nof life secrets and ours. There is no harm in it--rather it is a good\r\nthing, to be highly prized--so highly that we shall give thanks that it\r\nwas brought unto us. This speech-together is finished.\" He pulled the\r\nloose folds of his robe closer about him and walked away.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Van Rycke addressed the I-S party, \"I must ask you to withdraw.\r\nUnder the rules of Trade your presence here can be actively resented--\"\r\n\r\nBut Kallee had lost little of his assurance. \"You haven't heard the last\r\nof this. A tape of the whole proceedings goes to the Board--\"\r\n\r\n\"As you wish. But in the meantime--\" Van Rycke gestured to the waiting\r\nSalariki who were beginning to mutter impatiently. Kallee glanced around,\r\nheard those mutters, and made the only move possible, away from the\r\nQueen. He was not quite so cocky, but neither had he surrendered.\r\n\r\nDane caught at Tau's sleeve and asked the question which had been burning\r\nin him since he had come upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\"What happened--about the catnip?\"\r\n\r\nThere was lightening of the serious expression on Tau's face.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately for you that child took the leaves to the storm priest. They\r\ntested and approved it. And I can't see that it has any ill effects. But\r\nyou were just lucky, Thorson--it might have gone another way.\"\r\n\r\nDane sighed. \"I know that, sir,\" he confessed. \"I'm not trying to rocket\r\nout--\"\r\n\r\nTau gave a half-smile. \"We all off-fire our tubes at times,\" he\r\nconceded. \"Only next time--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not need to complete that warning as Dane caught him up:\r\n\r\n\"There isn't going to be a next time like this, sir--ever!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nGORP HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the interruption had disturbed the tenor of trading. The small chief\r\nwho had so eagerly taken Paft's place had only two Koros stones to offer\r\nand even to Dane's inexperienced eyes they were inferior in size and\r\ncolor to those the other clan leader had tendered. The Terrans were aware\r\nthat Koros mining was a dangerous business but they had not known that\r\nthe stock of available stones was so very small. Within ten minutes the\r\nlast of the serious bargaining was concluded and the clansmen were\r\ndrifting away from the burned over space about the Queen's standing fins.\r\n\r\nDane folded up the bargain cloth, glad for a task. He sensed that he was\r\nfar from being back in Van Rycke's good graces. The fact that his\r\nsuperior did not discuss any of the aspects of the deals with him was a\r\nbad sign.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jellico stretched. Although his was not, or never, what might be\r\ntermed a good-humored face, he was at peace with his world. \"That would\r\nseem to be all. What's the haul, Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten first class stones, about fifty second grade, and twenty or so of\r\nthird. The chiefs will go to the fisheries tomorrow. _Then_ we'll be in\r\nto see the really good stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how's the herbs holding out?\" That interested Dane too. Surely the\r\nfew plants in the hydro and the dried leaves could not be stretched too\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n\"As well as we could expect.\" Van Rycke frowned. \"But Craig thinks he's\r\non the trail of something to help--\"\r\n\r\nThe storm priests had uprooted the staff marking the trading station and\r\nwere wrapping the white streamer about it. Their leader had already gone\r\nand now Tau came up to the group by the ramp.\r\n\r\n\"Van says you have an idea,\" the Captain hailed him.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't tried it yet. And we can't unless the priests give it a clear\r\nlane--\"\r\n\r\n\"That goes without saying--\" Jellico agreed.\r\n\r\nThe Captain had not addressed that remark to him personally, but Dane was\r\nsure it had been directed at him. Well, they needn't worry--never again\r\nwas he going to make that mistake, they could be very sure of that.\r\n\r\nHe was part of the conference which followed in the mess cabin only\r\nbecause he was a member of the crew. How far the reason for his disgrace\r\nhad spread he had no way of telling, but he made no overtures, even to\r\nRip.\r\n\r\nTau had the floor with Mura as an efficient lieutenant. He discussed the\r\nproperties of catnip and gave information on the limited supply the Queen\r\ncarried. Then he launched into a new suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"Felines of Terra, in fact a great many other of our native mammals, have\r\na similar affinity for this.\"\r\n\r\nMura produced a small flask and Tau opened it, passing it to Captain\r\nJellico and so from hand to hand about the room. Each crewman sniffed at\r\nthe strong aroma. It was a heavier scent than that given off by the\r\ncrushed catnip--Dane was not sure he liked it. But a moment later Sinbad\r\nstreaked in from the corridor and committed the unpardonable sin of\r\nleaping to the table top just before Mura who had taken the flask from\r\nDane. He miaowed plaintively and clawed at the steward's cuff. Mura\r\nstoppered the flask and put the cat down on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Jellico wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Anisette, a liquor made from the oil of anise--from seeds of the anise\r\nplant. It is a stimulant, but we use it mainly as a condiment. If it is\r\nharmless for the Salariki it ought to be a bigger bargaining point than\r\nany perfumes or spices, I-S can import. And remember, with their\r\nunlimited capital, they can flood the market with products we can't\r\ntouch, selling at a loss if need be to cut us out. Because their ship is\r\nnot going to lift from Sargol just because she has no legal right here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's this point,\" Van Rycke added to the lecture. \"The Eysies are\r\ntrading or want to trade perfumes. But they stock only manufactured\r\nproducts, exotic stuff, but synthetic.\" He took from his belt pouch two\r\ntiny boxes.\r\n\r\nBefore he caught the rich scent of the paste inside them Dane had already\r\nidentified each as luxury items from Casper--chemical products which sold\r\nwell and at high prices in the civilized ports of the Galaxy. The\r\nCargo-master turned the boxes over, exposing the symbol on their\r\nundersides--the mark of I-S.\r\n\r\n\"These were offered to me in trade by a Salarik. I took them, just to\r\nhave proof that the Eysies are operating here. But--note--they were\r\noffered to me in trade, along with two top Koros for what? One spoonful\r\nof dried catnip leaves. Does that suggest anything?\"\r\n\r\nMura answered first. \"The Salariki prefer natural products to synthetic.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'you suppose that was Cam's secret?\" speculated Astrogator Steen\r\nWilcox.\r\n\r\n\"If it was,\" Jellico cut in, \"he certainly kept it! If we had only known\r\nthis earlier--\"\r\n\r\nThey were all thinking of that, of their storage space carefully packed\r\nwith useless trade goods. Where, if they had known, the same space could\r\nhave carried herbs with five or twenty-five times as much buying power.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe now that their sales' resistance is broken, we _can_ switch to\r\nsome of the other stuff,\" Tang Ya, torn away from his beloved\r\ncommunicators for the conference, said wistfully. \"They like color--how\r\nabout breaking out some rolls of Harlinian moth silk?\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke sighed wearily. \"Oh, we'll try. We'll bring out everything and\r\nanything. But we could have done so much better--\" he brooded over the\r\ntricks of fate which had landed them on a planet wild for trade with no\r\nproper trade goods in either of their holds.\r\n\r\nThere was a nervous little sound of a throat being apologetically\r\ncleared. Jasper Weeks, the small wiper from the engine room detail, the\r\nthird generation Venusian colonist whom the more vocal members of the\r\nQueen's complement were apt to forget upon occasion, seeing all eyes upon\r\nhim, spoke though his voice was hardly above a hoarse whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Cedar--lacquel bark--forsh weed--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cinnamon,\" Mura added to the list. \"Imported in small quantities--\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally! Only the problem now is--how much cedar, lacquel bark, forsh\r\nweed, cinnamon do we have on board?\" demanded Van Rycke.\r\n\r\nHis sarcasm did not register with Weeks for the little man pushed by Dane\r\nand left the cabin to their surprise. In the quiet which followed they\r\ncould hear the clatter of his boots on ladder rungs as he descended to\r\nthe quarters of the engine room staff. Tang turned to his neighbor,\r\nJohan Stotz, the Queen's Engineer.\r\n\r\n\"What's he going for?\"\r\n\r\nStotz shrugged. Weeks was a self-effacing man--so much so that even in\r\nthe cramped quarters of the spacer very little about him as an individual\r\nimpressed his mates--a fact which was slowly dawning on them all now.\r\nThen they heard the scramble of feet hurrying back and Weeks burst in\r\nwith energy which carried him across to the table behind which the\r\nCaptain and Van Rycke now sat.\r\n\r\nIn the wiper's hands was a plasta-steel box--the treasure chest of a\r\nspaceman. Its tough exterior was guaranteed to protect the contents\r\nagainst everything but outright disintegration. Weeks put it down on the\r\ntable and snapped up the lid.\r\n\r\nA new aroma, or aromas, was added to the scents now at war in the cabin.\r\nWeeks pulled out a handful of fluffy white stuff which frothed up about\r\nhis fingers like soap lather. Then with more care he lifted up a tray\r\ndivided into many small compartments, each with a separate sealing lid of\r\nits own. The men of the Queen moved in, their curiosity aroused, until\r\nthey were jostling one another.\r\n\r\nBeing tall Dane had an advantage, though Van Rycke's bulk and the wide\r\nshoulders of the Captain were between him and the object they were so\r\nintent upon. In each division of the tray, easily seen through the\r\ntransparent lids, was a carved figure. The weird denizens of the Venusian\r\npolar swamps were there, along with lifelike effigies of Terran animals,\r\na Martian sand-mouse in all its monstrous ferocity, and the native animal\r\nand reptile life of half a hundred different worlds. Weeks put down a\r\nsecond tray beside the first, again displaying a menagerie of strange\r\nlife forms. But when he clicked open one of the compartments and handed\r\nthe figurine it contained to the Captain, Dane understood the reason for\r\nnow bringing forward the carvings.\r\n\r\nThe majority of them were fashioned from a dull blue-gray wood and Dane\r\nknew that if he picked one up he would discover that it weighed close to\r\nnothing in his hand. That was lacquel bark--the aromatic product of a\r\nVenusian vine. And each little animal or reptile lay encased in a soft\r\ndab of frothy white--frosh weed--the perfumed seed casing of the Martian\r\ncanal plants. One or two figures on the second tray were of a red-brown\r\nwood and these Van Rycke sniffed at appreciatively.\r\n\r\n\"Cedar--Terran cedar,\" he murmured.\r\n\r\nWeeks nodded eagerly, his eyes alight. \"I am waiting now for\r\nsandalwood--it is also good for carving--\"\r\n\r\nJellico stared at the array in puzzled wonder. \"You have made these?\"\r\n\r\nBeing an amateur xenobiologist of no small standing himself, the shapes\r\nof the carvings more than the material from which they fashioned held his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAll those on board the Queen had their own hobbies. The monotony of\r\nvoyaging through hyper-space had long ago impressed upon men the need for\r\noccupying both hands and mind during the sterile days while they were\r\nforced into close companionship with few duties to keep them alert.\r\nJellico's cabin was papered with tri-dee pictures of the rare animals and\r\nalien creatures he had studied in their native haunts or of which he kept\r\ncareful and painstaking records. Tau had his magic, Mura not only his\r\nplants but the delicate miniature landscapes he fashioned, to be\r\nimprisoned forever in the hearts of protecting plasta balls. But Weeks\r\nhad never shown his work before and now he had an artist's supreme\r\npleasure of completely confounding his shipmates.\r\n\r\nThe Cargo-master returned to the business on hand first. \"You're willing\r\nto transfer these to 'cargo'?\" he asked briskly. \"How many do you have?\"\r\n\r\nWeeks, now lifting a third and then a fourth tray from the box, replied\r\nwithout looking up.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred. Yes, I'll transfer, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain was turning about in his fingers the beautifully shaped\r\nfigure of an Astran duocorn. \"Pity to trade these here,\" he mused aloud.\r\n\"Will Paft or Halfer appreciate more than just their scent?\"\r\n\r\nWeeks smiled shyly. \"I've filled this case, sir. I was going to offer\r\nthem to Mr. Van Rycke on a venture. I can always make another set. And\r\nright now--well, maybe they'll be worth more to the Queen, seeing as how\r\nthey're made out of aromatic woods, then they'd be elsewhere. Leastwise\r\nthe Eysies aren't going to have anything like them to show!\" he ended in\r\na burst of honest pride.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed they aren't!\" Van Rycke gave honor where it was due.\r\n\r\nSo they made plans and then separated to sleep out the rest of the night.\r\nDane knew that his lapse was not forgotten nor forgiven, but now he was\r\nhonestly too tired to care and slept as well as if his conscience were\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nBut morning brought only a trickle of lower class clansmen for trading\r\nand none of them had much but news to offer. The storm priests, as\r\nneutral arbitrators, had divided up the Koros grounds. And the clansmen,\r\nunder the personal supervision of their chieftains were busy hunting the\r\nstones. The Terrans gathered from scraps of information that gem seeking\r\non such a large scale had never been attempted before.\r\n\r\nBefore night there came other news, and much more chilling. Paft, one of\r\nthe two major chieftains of this section of Sargol--while supervising the\r\nefforts of his liege men on a newly discovered and richly strewn length\r\nof shoal water--had been attacked and killed by gorp. The unusual\r\nactivity of the Salariki in the shallows had in turn drawn to the spot\r\nbattalions of the intelligent, malignant reptiles who had struck in\r\nstrength, slaying and escaping before the Salariki could form an adequate\r\ndefense, having killed the land dwellers' sentries silently and\r\neffectively before advancing on the laboring main bodies of gem hunters.\r\n\r\nA loss of a certain number of miners or fishers had been preseen as the\r\nprice one paid for Koros in quantity. But the death of a chieftain was\r\nanother thing altogether, having repercussions which carried far beyond\r\nthe fact of his death. When the news reached the Salariki about the Queen\r\nthey melted away into the grass forest and for the first time the Terrans\r\nfelt free of spying eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What happens now?\" Ali inquired. \"Do they declare all deals off?\"\r\n\r\n\"That might just be the unfortunate answer,\" agreed Van Rycke.\r\n\r\n\"Could be,\" Rip commented to Dane, \"that they'd think we were in some way\r\nresponsible--\"\r\n\r\nBut Dane's conscience, sensitive over the whole matter of Salariki trade,\r\nhad already reached that conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe Terran party, unsure of what were the best tactics, wisely decided to\r\ndo nothing at all for the time being. But, when the Salariki seemed to\r\nhave completely vanished on the morning of the second day, the men were\r\nrestless. Had Paft's death resulted in some interclan quarrel over the\r\nheirship and the other clans withdrawn to let the various contendents for\r\nthat honor fight it out? Or--what was more probable and dangerous--had\r\nthe aliens come to the point of view that the Queen was in the main\r\nresponsible for the catastrophe and were engaged in preparing too warm a\r\nwelcome for any Traders who dared to visit them?\r\n\r\nWith the latter idea in mind they did not stray far from the ship. And\r\nthe limit to their traveling was the edge of the forest from which they\r\ncould be covered and so they did not learn much.\r\n\r\nIt was well into the morning before they were dramatically appraised\r\nthat, far from being considered in any way an enemy, they were about to\r\nbe accepted in a tie as close as clan to clan during one of the temporary\r\nbut binding truces.\r\n\r\nThe messenger came in state, a young Salarik warrior, his splendid cloak\r\nrent and hanging in tattered pieces from his shoulders as a sign of his\r\nofficial grief. He carried in one hand a burned out torch, and in the\r\nother an unsheathed claw knife, its blade reflecting the sunlight with a\r\nwicked glitter. Behind him trotted three couples of retainers, their\r\ncloaks also ragged fringes, their knives drawn.\r\n\r\nStanding up on the ramp to receive what could only be a formal deputation\r\nwere Captain, Astrogator, Cargo-master and Engineer, the senior officers\r\nof the spacer.\r\n\r\nIn the rolling periods of the Trade Lingo the torch bearer identified\r\nhimself as Groft, son and heir of the late lamented Paft. Until his\r\nchieftain father was avenged in blood he could not assume the high seat\r\nof his clan nor the leadership of the family. And now, following custom,\r\nhe was inviting the friends and sometimes allies of the dead Paft to a\r\ngorp hunt. Such a gorp hunt, Dane gathered from amidst the flowers of\r\nceremonial Salariki speech, as had never been planned before on the face\r\nof Sargol. Salariki without number in the past had died beneath the\r\nripping talons of the water reptiles, but it was seldom that a chieftain\r\nhad so fallen and his clan were firm in their determination to take a\r\nfull blood price from the killers.\r\n\r\n\"--and so, sky lords,\" Groft brought his oration to a close, \"we come to\r\nask that you send your young men to this hunting so that they may know\r\nthe joy of plunging knives into the scaled death and see the horned ones\r\ndie bathed in their own vile blood!\"\r\n\r\nDane needed no hint from the Queen's officers that this invitation was a\r\nsharp departure from custom. By joining with the natives in such a foray\r\nthe Terrans were being admitted to kinship of a sort, cementing relations\r\nby a tie which the I-S, or any other interloper from off-world, would\r\nfind hard to break. It was a piece of such excellent good fortune as they\r\nwould not have dreamed of three days earlier.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke replied, his voice properly sonorous, sounding out the rounded\r\nperiods of the rolling tongue which they had all been taught during the\r\nvoyage, using Cam's recording. Yes, the Terrans would join with pleasure\r\nin so good and great a cause. They would lend the force of their arms to\r\nthe defeat of all gorp they had the good fortune to meet. Groft need only\r\nname the hour for them to join him--\r\n\r\nIt was not needful, the young Salariki chieftain-to-be hastened to tell\r\nthe Cargo-master, that the senior sky lords concern themselves in this\r\nmatter. In fact it would be against custom, for it was meet that such a\r\nhunt be left to warriors of few years, that they might earn glory and be\r\nable to stand before the fires at the Naming as men. Therefore--the thumb\r\nclaw of Groft was extended to its greatest length as he used it to single\r\nout the Terrans he had been eyeing--let this one, and that, and that, and\r\nthe fourth be ready to join with the Salariki party an hour after nooning\r\non this very day and they would indeed teach the slimy, treacherous\r\nlurkers in the depths a well needed lesson.\r\n\r\nThe Salarik's choice with one exception had unerringly fallen upon the\r\nyoungest members of the crew, Ali, Rip, and Dane in that order. But his\r\nfourth addition had been Jasper Weeks. Perhaps because of his native\r\npallor of skin and slightness of body the oiler had seemed, to the alien,\r\nto be younger than his years. At any rate Groft had made it very plain\r\nthat he chose these men and Dane knew that the Queen's officers would\r\nraise no objection which might upset the delicate balance of favorable\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke did ask for one concession which was reluctantly granted. He\r\nreceived permission for the spacer's men to carry their sleep rods.\r\nThough the Salariki, apparently for some reason of binding and hoary\r\ncustom, were totally opposed to hunting their age-old enemy with anything\r\nother than their duelists' weapons of net and claw knife.\r\n\r\n\"Go along with them,\" Captain Jellico gave his final orders to the four,\r\n\"as long as it doesn't mean your own necks--understand? On the other hand\r\ndead heroes have never helped to lift a ship. And these gorp are tough\r\nfrom all accounts. You'll just have to use your own judgment about\r\nspringing your rods on them--\" He looked distinctly unhappy at that\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nAli was grinning and little Weeks tightened his weapon belt with a touch\r\nof swagger he had never shown before. Rip was his usual soft voiced self,\r\ndependable as a rock and a good base for the rest of them--taking command\r\nwithout question as they marched off to join Groft's company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nTHE PERILOUS SEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gorp hunters straggled through the grass forest in family groups, and\r\nthe Terrans saw that the enterprise had forced another uneasy truce upon\r\nthe district, for there were representatives from more than just Paft's\r\nown clan. All the Salariki were young and the parties babbled together in\r\nexcitement. It was plain that this hunt, staged upon a large scale, was\r\nnot only a means of revenge upon a hated enemy but, also, a sporting\r\nevent of outstanding prestige.\r\n\r\nNow the grass trees began to show ragged gaps, open spaces between their\r\nclumps, until the forest was only scattered groups and the party the\r\nTerrans had joined walked along a trail cloaked in knee-high, yellow-red\r\nfern growth. Most of the Salariki carried unlit torches, some having four\r\nor five bundled together, as if gorp hunting must be done after\r\nnightfall. And it _was_ fairly late in the afternoon before they topped a\r\nrise of ground and looked out upon one of Sargol's seas.\r\n\r\nThe water was a dull-metallic gray, broken by great swaths of purple as\r\nif an artist had slapped a brush of color across it in a hit or miss\r\nfashion. Sand of the red grit, lightened by the golden flecks which\r\nglittered in the sun, stretched to the edge of the wavelets breaking with\r\nonly languor on the curve of earth. The bulk of islands arose in serried\r\nranks farther out--crowned with grass trees all rippling under the sea\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThey came out upon the beach where one of the purple patches touched the\r\nshore and Dane noted that it left a scummy deposit there. The Terrans\r\nwent on to the water's edge. Where it was clear of the purple stuff they\r\ncould get a murky glimpse of the bottom, but the scum hid long stretches\r\nof shoreline and outer wave, and Dane wondered if the gorp used it as a\r\nprotective covering.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the Salariki made no move toward the sea which was to be\r\ntheir hunting ground. Instead the youngest members of the party, some of\r\nwhom were adolescents not yet entitled to wear the claw knife of manhood,\r\nspread out along the shore and set industriously to gathering driftwood,\r\nwhich they brought back to heap on the sand. Dane, watching that harvest,\r\ncaught sight of a smoothly polished length. He called Weeks' attention\r\nto the water rounded cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe oiler's eyes lighted and he stooped to pick it up. Where the other\r\nsticks were from grass trees this was something else. And among the\r\nbleached pile it had the vividness of flame. For it was a strident\r\nscarlet. Weeks turned it over in his hands, running his fingers lovingly\r\nacross its perfect grain. Even in this crude state it had beauty. He\r\nstopped the Salarik who had just brought in another armload of wood.\r\n\r\n\"This is what?\" he spoke the Trade Lingo haltingly.\r\n\r\nThe native gazed somewhat indifferently at the branch. \"Tansil,\" he\r\nanswered. \"It grows on the islands--\" He made a vague gesture to include\r\na good section of the western sea before he hurried away.\r\n\r\nWeeks now went along the tide line on his own quest, Dane trailing him.\r\nAt the end of a quarter hour when a hail summoned them back to the site\r\nof the now lighted fire, they had some ten pieces of the tansil wood\r\nbetween them. The finds ranged from a three foot section some four\r\ninches in diameter, to some slender twigs no larger than a writing\r\nsteelo--but all with high polish, the warm flame coloring. Weeks lashed\r\nthem together before he joined the group where Groft was outlining the\r\ntechnique of gorp hunting for the benefit of the Terrans.\r\n\r\nSome two hundred feet away a reef, often awash and stained with the\r\npurple scum, angled out into the sea in a long curve which formed a\r\nnatural breakwater. This was the point of attack. But first the purple\r\nfilm must be removed so that land and sea dwellers could meet on common\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nThe fire blazed up, eating hungrily into the driftwood. And from it ran\r\nthe young Salariki with lighted brands, which at the water's edge they\r\nwhirled about their heads and then hurled out onto the purple patches.\r\nFire arose from the water and ran with frantic speed across the crests of\r\nthe low waves, while the Salariki coughed and buried their noses in their\r\nperfume boxes, for the wind drove shoreward an overpowering stench.\r\n\r\nWhere the cleansing fire had run on the water there was now only the\r\nnatural metallic gray of the liquid, the cover was gone. Older Salariki\r\nwarriors were choosing torches from those they had brought, doing it with\r\ncare. Groft approached the Terrans carrying four.\r\n\r\n\"These you use now--\"\r\n\r\nWhat for? Dane wondered. The sky was still sunlit. He held the torch\r\nwatching to see how the Salariki made use of them.\r\n\r\nGroft led the advance--running lightly out along the reef with agile and\r\ngraceful leaps to cross the breaks where the sea hurled in over the rock.\r\nAnd after him followed the other natives, each with a lighted torch in\r\nhand--the torch they hunkered down to plant firmly in some crevice of the\r\nrock before taking a stand beside that beacon.\r\n\r\nThe Terrans, less surefooted in the space boots, picked their way along\r\nthe same path, wet with spray, wrinkling their noses against the\r\nlingering puffs of the stench from the water.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the Salariki they faced seaward--but Dane did\r\nnot know what to watch for. Cam had left only the vaguest general\r\ndescriptions of gorp and beyond the fact that they were reptilian,\r\nintelligent and dangerous, the Terrans had not been briefed.\r\n\r\nOnce the warriors had taken up their stand along the reef, the younger\r\nSalariki went into action once more. Lighting more torches at the fire,\r\nthey ran out along the line of their elders and flung their torches as\r\nfar as they could hurl them into the sea outside the reef.\r\n\r\nThe gray steel of the water was now yellow with the reflection of the\r\nsinking sun. But that ocher and gold became more brilliant yet as the\r\ntorches of the Salariki set blazing up far floating patches of scum. Dane\r\nshielded his eyes against the glare and tried to watch the water, with\r\nsome idea that this move must be provocation and what they hunted would\r\nso be driven into view.\r\n\r\nHe held his sleep rod ready, just as the Salarik on his right had claw\r\nknife in one hand and in the other, open and waiting, the net intended to\r\nentangle and hold fast a victim, binding him for the kill.\r\n\r\nBut it was at the far tip of the barrier--the post of greatest honor\r\nwhich Groft had jealously claimed as his, that the gorp struck first. At\r\na wild shout of defiance Dane half turned to see the Salarik noble cast\r\nhis net at sea level and then stab viciously with a well practiced blow.\r\nWhen he raised his arm for a second thrust, greenish ichor ran from the\r\nblade down his wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Dane!\"\r\n\r\nThorson's head jerked around. He saw the vee of ripples headed straight\r\nfor the rocks where he balanced.\r\n\r\nBut he'd have to wait for a better target than a moving wedge of water.\r\nInstinctively he half crouched in the stance of an embattled spaceman,\r\nwishing now that he did have a blaster.\r\n\r\nNeither of the Salariki stationed on either side of him made any move and\r\nhe guessed that was hunt etiquette. Each man was supposed to face and\r\nkill the monster that challenged him--without assistance. And upon his\r\nskill during the next few minutes might rest the reputation of all\r\nTerrans as far as the natives were concerned.\r\n\r\nThere was a shadow outline beneath the surface of the metallic water now,\r\nbut he could not see well because of the distortion of the murky waves.\r\nHe must wait until he was sure.\r\n\r\nThen the thing gave a spurt and, only inches beyond the toes of his\r\nboots, a nightmare creature sprang halfway out of the water, pincher\r\nclaws as long as his own arms snapping at him. Without being conscious of\r\nhis act, he pressed the stud of the sleep rod, aiming in the general\r\ndirection of that horror from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut to his utter amazement the creature did not fall supinely back into\r\nwatery world from which it had emerged. Instead those claws snapped\r\nagain, this time scrapping across the top of Dane's foot, leaving a\r\nfurrow in material the keenest of knives could not have scored.\r\n\r\n\"Give it to him!\" That was Rip shouting encouragement from his own place\r\nfarther along the reef.\r\n\r\nDane pressed the firing stud again and again. The claws waved as the\r\nmonstrosity slavered from a gaping frog's mouth, a mouth which was fanged\r\nwith a shark's vicious teeth. It was almost wholly out of the water,\r\ncreeping on a crab's many legs, with a clawed upper limb reaching for\r\nhim, when suddenly it stopped, its huge head turning from side to side in\r\nthe sheltering carapace of scaled natural armor. It settled back as if\r\ncrouching for a final spring--a spring which would push Dane into the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nBut that attack never came. Instead the gorp drew in upon itself until it\r\nresembled an unwieldy ball of indestructible armor and there it remained.\r\n\r\nThe Salariki on either side of Dane let out cries of triumph and edged\r\ncloser. One of them twirled his net suggestively, seeing that the Terran\r\nlacked what was to him an essential piece of hunting equipment. Dane\r\nnodded vigorously in agreement and the tough strands swung out in a\r\nskillful cast which engulfed the motionless creature on the reef. But it\r\nwas so protected by its scales that there was no opening for the claw\r\nknife. They had made a capture but they could not make a kill.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Salariki were highly delighted. And several abandoned their\r\nposts to help the boys drag the monster ashore where it was pinned down\r\nto the beach by stakes driven through the edges of the net.\r\n\r\nBut the hunting party was given little time to gloat over this stroke of\r\nfortune. The gorp killed by Groft and the one stunned by Dane were only\r\nthe van of an army and within moments the hunters on the reef were\r\nconfronted by trouble armed with slashing claws and diabolic fighting\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThe battle was anything but one-sided. Dane whirled, as the air was rent\r\nby a shriek of agony, just in time to see one of the Salariki, already\r\ntorn by the claws of a gorp, being drawn under the water. It was too late\r\nto save the hunter, though Dane, balanced on the very edge of the reef,\r\naimed a beam into the bloody waves. If the gorp was affected by this\r\nattack he could not tell, for both attacker and victim could no longer be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBut Ali had better luck in rescuing the Salarik who shared his particular\r\nsection of reef, and the native, gashed and spurting blood from a wound\r\nin his thigh, was hauled to safety. While the gorp, coiling too slowly\r\nunder the Terran ray, was literally hewn to pieces by the revengeful\r\nknives of the hunter's kin.\r\n\r\nThe fight broke into a series of individual duels carried on now by the\r\nlight of the torches as the evening closed in. The last of the purple\r\npatches had burned away to nothing. Dane crouched by his standard torch,\r\nhis eyes fastened on the sea, watching for an ominous vee of ripples\r\nbetraying another gorp on its way to launch against the rock barrier.\r\n\r\nThere was such wild confusion along that line of water sprayed rocks\r\nthat he had no idea of how the engagement was going. But so far the\r\ngorp showed no signs of having had enough.\r\n\r\nDane was shaken out of his absorption by another scream. One, he was\r\nsure, which had not come from any Salariki throat. He got to his\r\nfeet. Rip was stationed four men beyond him. Yes, the tall\r\nAstrogator-apprentice was there, outlined against torch flare. Ali?\r\nNo--there was the assistant Engineer. Weeks? But Weeks was picking his\r\nway back along the reef toward the shore, haste expressed in every line\r\nof his figure. The scream sounded for a second time, freezing the\r\nTerrans.\r\n\r\n\"Come back--!\" That was Weeks gesturing violently at the shore and\r\nsomething floundering in the protecting circle of the reef. The younger\r\nSalariki who had been feeding the fire were now clustered at the water's\r\nedge.\r\n\r\nAli ran and with a leap covered the last few feet, landing reckless knee\r\ndeep in the waves. Dane saw light strike on his rod as he swung it in a\r\nwide arc to center on the struggle churning the water into foam. A third\r\nscream died to a moan and then the Salariki dashed into the sea, their\r\nnets spread, drawing back with them through the surf a dark and now quiet\r\nmass.\r\n\r\nThe fact that at least one gorp had managed to get on the inner side of\r\nthe reef made an impression on the rest of the native hunters. After an\r\nuncertain minute or two Groft gave the signal to withdraw--which they did\r\nwith grisly trophies. Dane counted seven gorp bodies--which did not\r\ninclude the prisoner ashore. And more might have slid into the sea to\r\ndie. On the other hand two Salariki were dead--one had been drawn into\r\nthe sea before Dane's eyes--and at least one was badly wounded. But who\r\nhad been pulled down in the shallows--some one sent out from the Queen\r\nwith a message?\r\n\r\nDane raced back along the reef, not waiting to pull up his torch, and\r\nbefore he reached the shore Rip was overtaking him. But the man who lay\r\ngroaning on the sand was not from the Queen. The torn and bloodstained\r\ntunic covering his lacerated shoulders had the I-S badge. Ali was already\r\nat work on his wounds, giving temporary first aid from his belt kit. To\r\nall their questions he was stubbornly silent--either he couldn't or\r\nwouldn't answer.\r\n\r\nIn the end they helped the Salariki rig three stretchers. On one the\r\nlargest, the captive gorp, still curled in a round carapace protected\r\nball, was bound with the net. The second supported the wounded Salarik\r\nclansman and onto the third the Terrans lifted the I-S man.\r\n\r\n\"We'll deliver him to his own ship,\" Rip decided. \"He must have tailed us\r\nhere as a spy--\" He asked a passing Salarik as to where they could find\r\nthe Company spacer.\r\n\r\n\"They might just think we are responsible,\" Ali pointed out. \"But I see\r\nyour point. If we do pack him back to the Queen and he doesn't make it,\r\nthey might say that we fired his rockets for him. All right, boys, let's\r\nup-ship--he doesn't look too good to me.\"\r\n\r\nWith a torch-bearing Salarik boy as a guide, they hurried along a path\r\ntaking in turns the burden of the stretcher. Luckily the I-S ship was\r\neven closer to the sea than the Queen and as they crossed the slagged\r\nground, congealed by the break fire, they were trotting.\r\n\r\nThough the Company ship was probably one of the smallest Inter-Solar\r\ncarried on her rosters, it was a third again as large as the Queen--with\r\npart of that third undoubtedly dedicated to extra cargo space. Beside her\r\ntheir own spacer would seem not only smaller, but battered and worn. But\r\nno Free Trader would have willingly assumed the badges of a Company man,\r\nnot even for the command of such a ship fresh from the cradles of a\r\nbuilder.\r\n\r\nWhen a man went up from the training Pool for his first assignment, he\r\nwas sent to the ship where his temperament, training and abilities best\r\nfitted. And those who were designated as Free Traders would never fit\r\ninto the pattern of Company men. Of late years the breech between those\r\nwho lived under the strict parental control of one of the five great\r\ngalaxy wide organizations and those still too much of an individual to\r\nlive any life but that of a half-explorer-half-pioneer which was the Free\r\nTrader's, had widened alarmingly. Antagonism flared, rivalry was strong.\r\nBut as yet the great Companies themselves were at polite cold war with\r\none another for the big plums of the scattered systems. The Free Traders\r\ntook the crumbs and there was not much disputing--save in cases such as\r\nhad arisen on Sargol, when suddenly crumbs assumed the guise of very rich\r\ncake, rich and large enough to attract a giant.\r\n\r\nThe party from the Queen was given a peremptory challenge as they reached\r\nthe other ship's ramp. Rip demanded to see the officer of the watch and\r\nthen told the story of the wounded man as far as they knew it. The Eysie\r\nwas hurried aboard--nor did his shipmates give a word of thanks.\r\n\r\n\"That's that.\" Rip shrugged. \"Let's go before they slam the hatch so hard\r\nthey'll rock their ship off her fins!\"\r\n\r\n\"Polite, aren't they?\" asked Weeks mildly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you expect of Eysies?\" Ali wanted to know. \"To them Free Traders\r\nare just rim planet trash. Let's report back where we are appreciated.\"\r\n\r\nThey took a short cut which brought them back to the Queen and they filed\r\nup her ramp to make their report to the Captain.\r\n\r\nBut they were not yet satisfied with Groft and his gorp slayers. No\r\nSalarik appeared for trade in the morning--surprising the Terrans.\r\nInstead a second delegation, this time of older men and a storm priest,\r\nvisited the spacer with an invitation to attend Paft's funeral feast, a\r\nrite which would be followed by the formal elevation of Groft to his\r\nfather's position, now that he had revenged that parent. And from remarks\r\ndropped by members of the delegation it was plain that the bearing of the\r\nTerrans who had joined the hunting party was esteemed to have been in\r\nhighest accord with Salariki tradition.\r\n\r\nThey drew lots to decide which two must remain with the ship and the rest\r\nperfumed themselves so as to give no offense which might upset their now\r\ncordial relations. Again it was mid-afternoon when the Salariki escort\r\nsent to do them honor waited at the edge of the wood and Mura and Tang\r\nsaw them off. With a herald booming before them, they traveled the beaten\r\nearth road in the opposite direction from the trading center, off through\r\nthe forest until they came to a wide section of several miles which had\r\nbeen rigorously cleared of any vegetation which might give cover to a\r\nlurking enemy. In the center of this was a twelve-foot-high stockade of\r\nthe bright red, burnished wood which had attracted Weeks on the shore.\r\nEach paling was the trunk of a tree and it had been sharpened at the top\r\nto a wicked point. On the field side was a wide ditch, crossed at the\r\ngate by a bridge, the planking of which might be removed at will. And as\r\nDane passed over he looked down into the moat that was dry. The Salariki\r\ndid not depend upon water for a defense--but on something else which his\r\nexperience of the previous night had taught him to respect. There was no\r\nmistaking that shade of purple. The highly inflammable scum the hunters\r\nhad burnt from the top of the waves had been brought inland and lay a\r\ngreasy blanket some eight feet below. It would only be necessary to toss\r\na torch on that and the defenders of the stockade would create a wall of\r\nfire to baffle any attackers. The Salariki knew how to make the most of\r\ntheir world's natural resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nDUELIST'S CHALLENGE\r\n\r\n\r\nInside the red stockade there was a crowded community. The Salariki\r\ndemanded privacy of a kind, and even the unmarried warriors did not share\r\nbarracks, but each had a small cubicle of his own. So that the mud brick\r\nand timber erections of one of their clan cities resembled nothing so\r\nmuch as the comb cells of a busy beehive. Although Paft's was considered\r\na large clan, it numbered only about two hundred fighting men and their\r\nnumerous wives, children and captive servants. Not all of them normally\r\nlived at this center, but for the funeral feasting they had\r\nassembled--which meant a lot of doubling up and tenting out under\r\nmakeshift cover between the regular buildings of the town. So that the\r\nTerrans were glad to be guided through this crowded maze to the Great\r\nHall which was its heart.\r\n\r\nAs the trading center had been, the hall was a circular enclosure open to\r\nthe sky above but divided in wheel-spoke fashion with posts of the red\r\nwood, each supporting a metal basket filled with imflammable material.\r\nHere were no lowly stools or trading tables. One vast circular board,\r\nbroken only by a gap at the foot, ran completely around the wall. At the\r\nend opposite the entrance was the high chair of the chieftain, set on a\r\ntwo step dais. Though the feast had not yet officially begun, the Terrans\r\nsaw that the majority of the places were already occupied.\r\n\r\nThey were led around the perimeter of the enclosure to places not far\r\nfrom the high seat. Van Rycke settled down with a grunt of satisfaction.\r\nIt was plain that the Free Traders were numbered among the nobility. They\r\ncould be sure of good trade in the days to come.\r\n\r\nDelegations from neighboring clans arrived in close companies of ten or\r\ntwelve and were granted seats, as had been the Terrans, in groups. Dane\r\nnoted that there was no intermingling of clan with clan. And, as they\r\nwere to understand later that night, there was a very good reason for\r\nthat precaution.\r\n\r\n\"Hope all our adaption shots work,\" Ali murmured, eyeing with no pleasure\r\nat all the succession of platters now being borne through the inner\r\nopening of the table.\r\n\r\nWhile the Traders had learned long ago that the wisest part of valor was\r\nnot to sample alien strong drinks, ceremony often required that they\r\nbreak bread (or its other world equivalent) on strange planets. And so\r\nscience served expediency and now a Trader bound for any Galactic banquet\r\nwas immunized, as far as was medically possible, against the evil\r\nconsequences of consuming food not originally intended for Terran\r\nstomachs. One of the results being that Traders acquired a far flung\r\nreputation of possessing bird-like appetites--since it was always better\r\nto nibble and live, than to gorge and die.\r\n\r\nGroft had not yet taken his place in the vacant chieftain's chair. For\r\nthe present he stood in the center of the table circle, directing the\r\ncaptive slaves who circulated with the food. Until the magic moment when\r\nthe clan themselves would proclaim their overlord, he remained merely the\r\neldest son of the house, relatively without power.\r\n\r\nAs the endless rows of platters made their way about the table the basket\r\nlights on the tops of the pillars were ignited, dispelling the dusk of\r\nevening. And there was an attendant stationed by each to throw on\r\nhandsful of aromatic bark which burned with puffs of lavender smoke,\r\nadding to the many warring scents. The Terrans had recourse at intervals\r\nto their own pungent smelling bottles, merely to clear their heads of the\r\ndrugging fumes.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Dane thought as the feast proceeded, that smoke from the\r\nbraziers went straight up. Had they been in a roofed space they might\r\nhave been overcome. As it was--were they entirely conscious of all that\r\nwas going on around them?\r\n\r\nHis reason for that speculation was the dance now being performed in the\r\ncenter of the hall--their fight with the gorp being enacted in a series\r\nof bounds and stabbings. He was sure that he could no longer trust his\r\neyes when the claw knife of the victorious dancer-hunter apparently\r\npassed completely through the chest of another wearing a grotesque\r\nmonster mask.\r\n\r\nAs a fitting climax to their horrific display, three of the men who had\r\nbeen with them on the reef entered, dragging behind them--still enmeshed\r\nin the hunting net--the gorp which Dane had stunned. It was uncurled now\r\nand very much alive, but the pincer claws which might have cut its way\r\nto safety were encased in balls of hard substance.\r\n\r\nFreed from the net, suspended by its sealed claws, the gorp swung back\r\nand forth from a standard set up before the high seat. Its murderous jaws\r\nsnapped futilely, and from it came an enraged snake's vicious hissing.\r\nThough totally in the power of its enemies it gave an impression of\r\nterrifying strength and menace.\r\n\r\nThe sight of their ancient foe aroused the Salariki, inflaming warriors\r\nwho leaned across the table to hurl tongue-twisting invective at the\r\ncaptive monster. Dane gathered that seldom had a living gorp been\r\ndelivered helpless into their hands and they proposed to make the most of\r\nthis wonderful opportunity. And the Terran suddenly wished the\r\nmonstrosity had fallen back into the sea. He had no soft thoughts for the\r\ngorp after what he had seen at the reef and the tales he had heard, but\r\nneither did he like what he saw now expressed in gestures, heard in the\r\ntones of voices about them.\r\n\r\nA storm priest put an end to the outcries. His dun cloak making a spot of\r\ndarkness amid all the flashing color, he came straight to the place where\r\nthe gorp swung. As he took his stand before the wriggling creature the\r\ndin gradually faded, the warriors settled back into their seats, a pool\r\nof quiet spread through the enclosure.\r\n\r\nGroft came up to take his position beside the priest. With both hands he\r\ncarried a two handled cup. It was not the ornamented goblet which stood\r\nbefore each diner, but a manifestly older artifact, fashioned of some\r\ndull black substance and having the appearance of being even older than\r\nthe hall or town.\r\n\r\nOne of the warriors who had helped to bring in the gorp now made a quick\r\nand accurate cast with a looped rope, snaring the monster's head and\r\npulling back almost at a right angle. With deliberation the storm priest\r\nproduced a knife--the first straight bladed weapon Dane had seen on\r\nSargol. He made a single thrust in the soft underpart of the gorp's\r\nthroat, catching in the cup he took from Groft some of the ichor which\r\nspurted from the wound.\r\n\r\nThe gorp thrashed madly, spattering table and surrounding Salariki with\r\nits life fluid, but the attention of the crowd was riveted elsewhere.\r\nInto the old cup the priest poured another substance from a flask brought\r\nby an underling. He shook the cup back and forth, as if to mix its\r\ncontents thoroughly and then handed it to Groft.\r\n\r\nHolding it before him the young chieftain leaped to the table top and so\r\nto stand before the high seat. There was a hush throughout the enclosure.\r\nNow even the gorp had ceased its wild struggles and hung limp in its\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\nGroft raised the cup above his head and gave a loud shout in the archaic\r\nlanguage of his clan. He was answered by a chant from the warriors who\r\nwould in battle follow his banner, chant punctuated with the clinking\r\nslap of knife blades brought down forcibly on the board.\r\n\r\nThree times he recited some formula and was answered by the others. Then,\r\nin another period of sudden quiet, he raised the cup to his lips and\r\ndrank off its contents in a single draught, turning the goblet upside\r\ndown when he had done to prove that not a drop remained within. A shout\r\ntore through the great hall. The Salariki were all on their feet, waving\r\ntheir knives over their heads in honor to their new ruler. And Groft for\r\nthe first time seated himself in the high seat. The clan was no longer\r\nwithout a chieftain. Groft held his father's place.\r\n\r\n\"Show over?\" Dane heard Stotz murmur and Van Rycke's disappointing reply:\r\n\r\n\"Not yet. They'll probably make a night of it. Here comes another round\r\nof drinks--\"\r\n\r\n\"And trouble with them,\"--that was Captain Jellico being prophetic.\r\n\r\n\"By the Coalsack's Ripcord!\" That exclamation had been jolted out of Rip\r\nand Dane turned to see what had so jarred the usually serene\r\nAstrogator-apprentice. He was just in time to witness an important piece\r\nof Sargolian social practice.\r\n\r\nA young warrior, surely only within a year or so of receiving his knife,\r\nwas facing an older Salarik, both on their feet. The head and shoulder\r\nfur of the older fighter was dripping wet and an empty goblet rolled\r\nacross the table to bump to the floor. A hush had fallen on the immediate\r\nneighbors of the pair, and there was an air of expectancy about the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n\"Threw his drink all over the other fellow,\" Rip's soft whisper\r\nexplained. \"That means a duel--\"\r\n\r\n\"Here and now?\" Dane had heard of the personal combat proclivities of the\r\nSalariki.\r\n\r\n\"Should be to the death for an insult such as that,\" Ali remarked, as\r\nusual surveying the scene from his chosen role as bystander. As a child\r\nhe had survived the unspeakable massacres of the Crater War, nothing had\r\nbeen able to crack his surface armor since.\r\n\r\n\"The young fool!\" that was Steen Wilcox sizing up the situation from the\r\nangle of a naturally cautious nature and some fifteen years of experience\r\non a great many different worlds. \"He'll be mustered out for good before\r\nhe knows what happened to him!\"\r\n\r\nThe younger Salarik had barked a question at his elder and had been\r\npromptly answered by that dripping warrior. Now their neighbors came to\r\nlife with an efficiency which suggested that they had been waiting for\r\nsuch a move, it had happened so many times that every man knew just the\r\nright procedure from that point on.\r\n\r\nIn order for a Sargolian feast to be a success, the Terrans gathered from\r\noverheard remarks, at least one duel must be staged sometime during the\r\nfestivities. And those not actively engaged did a lot of brisk betting in\r\nthe background.\r\n\r\n\"Look there--at that fellow in the violet cloak,\" Rip directed Dane. \"See\r\nwhat he just laid down?\"\r\n\r\nThe nobleman in the violet cloak was not one of Groft's liege men, but a\r\nmember of the delegation from another clan. And what he had laid down on\r\nthe table--indicating as he did so his choice as winner in the coming\r\ncombat, the elder warrior--was a small piece of white material on which\r\nreposed a slightly withered but familiar leaf. The neighbor he wagered\r\nwith, eyed the stake narrowly, bending over to sniff at it, before he\r\npiled up two gem set armlets, a personal scent box and a thumb ring to\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nAt this practical indication of just how much the Terran herb was\r\nesteemed Dane regretted anew their earlier ignorance. He glanced along\r\nthe board and saw that Van Rycke had noted that stake and was calling\r\ntheir Captain's attention to it.\r\n\r\nBut such side issues were forgotten as the duelists vaulted into the\r\ncircle rimmed by the table, a space now vacated for their action. They\r\nwere stripped to their loin cloths, their cloaks thrown aside. Each\r\ncarried his net in his right hand, his claw knife ready in his left. As\r\nyet the Traders had not seen Salarik against Salarik in action and in\r\nspite of themselves they edged forward in their seats, as intent as the\r\nnatives upon what was to come. The finer points of the combat were lost\r\non them, and they did not understand the drilled casts of the net, which\r\nhad become as formalized through the centuries as the ancient and now\r\nalmost forgotten sword play of their own world. The young Salarik had\r\ngreater agility and speed, but the veteran who faced him had the\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nTo Terran eyes the duel had some of the weaving, sweeping movements of\r\nthe earlier ritual dance. The swift evasions of the nets were graceful\r\nand so timed that many times the meshes grazed the skin of the fighter\r\nwho fled entrapment.\r\n\r\nDane believed that the elder man was tiring, and the youngster must have\r\nshared that opinion. There was a leap to the right, a sudden flurry of\r\ndart and retreat, and then a net curled high and fell, enfolding flailing\r\narms and kicking legs. When the clutch rope was jerked tight, the\r\ncaptured youth was thrown off balance. He rolled frenziedly, but there\r\nwas no escaping the imprisoning strands.\r\n\r\nA shout applauded the victor. He stood now above his captive who lay\r\nsupine, his throat or breast ready for either stroke of the knife his\r\ncaptor wished to deliver. But it appeared that the winner was not minded\r\nto end the encounter with blood. Instead he reached out a long, befurred\r\narm, took up a filled goblet from the table and with serious\r\ndeliberation, poured its contents onto the upturned face of the loser.\r\n\r\nFor a moment there was a dead silence around the feast board and then a\r\nsecond roar, to which the honestly relieved Terrans added spurts of\r\nlaughter. The sputtering youth was shaken free of the net and went down\r\non his knees, tendering his opponent his knife, which the other thrust\r\nalong with his own into his sash belt. Dane gathered from overheard\r\nremarks that the younger man was, for a period of time, to be determined\r\nby clan council, now the servant-slave of his overthrower and that since\r\nthey were closely united by blood ties, this solution was considered\r\neminently suitable--though had the elder killed his opponent, no one\r\nwould have thought the worse of him for that deed.\r\n\r\nIt was the Queen's men who were to provide the next center of attraction.\r\nGroft climbed down from his high seat and came to face across the board\r\nthose who had accompanied him on the hunt. This time there was no\r\nescaping the sipping of the potent drink which the new chieftain slopped\r\nfrom his own goblet into each of theirs.\r\n\r\nThe fiery mouthful almost gagged Dane, but he swallowed manfully and\r\nhoped for the best as it burned like acid down his throat into his\r\nmiddle, there to mix uncomfortably with the viands he had eaten. Weeks'\r\nthin face looked very white, and Dane noticed with malicious enjoyment,\r\nthat Ali had an unobtrusive grip on the table which made his knuckles\r\nstand out in polished knobs--proving that there _were_ things which could\r\nupset the imperturbable Kamil.\r\n\r\nFortunately they were _not_ required to empty that flowing bowl in one\r\ngulp as Groft had done. The ceremonial mouthful was deemed enough and\r\nDane sat down thankfully--but with uneasy fears for the future.\r\n\r\nGroft had started back to his high seat when there was an interruption\r\nwhich had not been foreseen. A messenger threaded his way among the\r\nserving men and spoke to the chieftain, who glanced at the Terrans and\r\nthen nodded.\r\n\r\nDane, his queasiness growing every second, was not attending until he\r\nheard a bitten off word from Rip's direction and looked up to see a party\r\nof I-S men coming into the open space before the high seat. The men from\r\nthe Queen stiffened--there was something in the attitude of the newcomers\r\nwhich hinted at trouble.\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish, sky lords?\" That was Groft using the Trade Lingo, his\r\neyes half closed as he lolled in his chair of state, almost as if he were\r\nabout to witness some entertainment provided for his pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to offer you the good fortune desires of our hearts--\" That was\r\nKallee, the flowery words rolling with the proper accent from his tongue.\r\n\"And that you shall not forget us--we also offer gifts--\"\r\n\r\nAt a gesture from their Cargo-master, the I-S men set down a small chest.\r\nGroft, his chin resting on a clenched fist, lost none of his lazy air.\r\n\r\n\"They are received,\" he retorted with the formal acceptance. \"And no one\r\ncan have too much good fortune. The Howlers of the Black Winds know\r\nthat.\" But he tendered no invitation to join the feast.\r\n\r\nKallee did not appear to be disconcerted. His next move was one which\r\ntook his rivals by surprise, in spite of their suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"Under the laws of the Fellowship, O, Groft,\" he clung to the formal\r\nspeech, \"I claim redress--\"\r\n\r\nAli's hand moved. Through his growing distress Dane saw Van Rycke's jaw\r\ntighten, the fighting mask snap back on Captain Jellico's face. Whatever\r\ncame now was real trouble.\r\n\r\nGroft's eyes flickered over the party from the Queen. Though he had just\r\npledged cup friendship with four of them, he had the malicious humor of\r\nhis race. He would make no move to head off what might be coming.\r\n\r\n\"By the right of the knife and the net,\" he intoned, \"you have the power\r\nto claim personal satisfaction. Where is your enemy?\"\r\n\r\nKallee turned to face the Free Traders. \"I hereby challenge a champion to\r\nbe set out from these off-worlders to meet by the blood and by the water\r\nmy champion--\"\r\n\r\nThe Salariki were getting excited. This was superb entertainment, an\r\nengagement such as they had never hoped to see--alien against alien. The\r\nrising murmur of their voices was like the growl of a hunting beast.\r\n\r\nGroft smiled and the pleasure that expression displayed was neither\r\nTerran--nor human. But then the clan leader was not either, Dane reminded\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"Four of these warriors are clan-bound,\" he said. \"But the others may\r\nproduce a champion--\"\r\n\r\nDane looked along the line of his comrades--Ali, Rip, Weeks and himself\r\nhad just been ruled out. That left Jellico, Van Rycke, Karl Kosti, the\r\ngiant jetman whose strength they had to rely upon before, Stotz the\r\nEngineer, Medic Tau and Steen Wilcox. If it were strength alone he would\r\nhave chosen Kosti, but the big man was not too quick a thinker--\r\n\r\nJellico got to his feet, the embodiment of a star lane fighting man. In\r\nthe flickering light the scar on his cheek seemed to ripple. \"Who's your\r\nchampion?\" he asked Kallee.\r\n\r\nThe Eysie Cargo-master was grinning. He was confident he had pushed them\r\ninto a position from which they could not extricate themselves.\r\n\r\n\"You accept challenge?\" he countered.\r\n\r\nJellico merely repeated his question and Kallee beckoned forward one of\r\nhis men.\r\n\r\nThe Eysie who stepped up was no match for Kosti. He was a slender, almost\r\nwand-slim young man, whose pleased smirk said that he, too, was about to\r\nput something over on the notorious Free Traders. Jellico studied him for\r\na couple of long seconds during which the hum of Salariki voices was the\r\nthreatening buzz of a disturbed wasps' nest. There was no way out of\r\nthis--to refuse conflict was to lose all they had won with the clansmen.\r\nAnd they did not doubt that Kallee had, in some way, triggered the scales\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nJellico made the best of it. \"We accept challenge,\" his voice was level.\r\n\"We, being guesting in Groft's holding, will fight after the manner of\r\nthe Salariki who are proven warriors--\" He paused as roars of pleased\r\nacknowledgment arose around the board.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore let us follow the custom of warriors and take up the net and\r\nthe knife--\"\r\n\r\nWas there a shade of dismay on Kallee's face?\r\n\r\n\"And the time?\" Groft leaned forward to ask--but his satisfaction at such\r\na fine ending for his feast was apparent. This would be talked over by\r\nevery Sargolian for many storm seasons to come!\r\n\r\nJellico glanced up at the sky. \"Say an hour after dawn, chieftain. With\r\nyour leave, we shall confer concerning a champion.\"\r\n\r\n\"My council room is yours,\" Groft signed for a liege man to guide them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nBARRING ACCIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning winds rustled through the grass forest and, closer to hand,\r\nit pulled at the cloaks of the Salariki. Clan nobles sat on stools,\r\nlesser folk squatted on the trampled stubble of the cleared ground\r\noutside the stockade. In their many colored splendor the drab tunics of\r\nthe Terrans were a blot of darkness at either end of the makeshift arena\r\nwhich had been marked out for them.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of their conference the Queen's men had been forced\r\ninto a course Jellico had urged from the first. He, and he alone, would\r\nrepresent the Free Traders in the coming duel. And now he stood there in\r\nthe early morning, stripped down to shorts and boots, wearing nothing on\r\nwhich a net could catch and so trap him. The Free Traders were certain\r\nthat the I-S men having any advantage would press it to the ultimate\r\nlimit and the death of Captain Jellico would make a great impression on\r\nthe Salariki.\r\n\r\nJellico was taller than the Eysie who faced him, but almost as lean. Hard\r\nmuscles moved under his skin, pale where space tan had not burned in the\r\nyears of his star voyaging. And his every movement was with the liquid\r\ngrace of a man who, in his time, had been a master of the force blade.\r\nNow he gripped in his left hand the claw knife given him by Groft himself\r\nand in the other he looped the throwing rope of the net.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the field, the Eysie man was industriously moving his\r\nbootsoles back and forth across the ground, intent upon coating them with\r\nas much of the gritty sand as would adhere. And he displayed the supreme\r\nconfidence in himself which he had shown at the moment of challenge in\r\nthe Great Hall.\r\n\r\nNone of the Free Trading party made the mistake of trying to give Jellico\r\nadvice. The Captain had not risen to his command without learning his\r\nduties. And the duties of a Free Trader covered a wide range of knowledge\r\nand practice. One had to be equally expert with a blaster and a slingshot\r\nwhen the occasion demanded. Though Jellico had not fought a Salariki duel\r\nwith net and knife before, he had a deep memory of other weapons, other\r\ntactics which could be drawn upon and adapted to his present need.\r\n\r\nThere was none of the casual atmosphere which had surrounded the affair\r\nbetween the Salariki clansmen in the hall. Here was ceremony. The storm\r\npriests invoked their own particular grim Providence, and there was an\r\noath taken over the weapons of battle. When the actual engagement began\r\nthe betting among the spectators had reached, Dane decided, epic\r\nproportions. Large sections of Sargolian personal property were due to\r\nchange hands as a result of this encounter.\r\n\r\nAs the chief priest gave the order to engage both Terrans advanced from\r\ntheir respective ends of the fighting space with the half crouching,\r\nlight footed tread of spacemen. Jellico had pulled his net into as close\r\na resemblance to rope as its bulk would allow. The very type of weapon,\r\nso far removed from any the Traders knew, made it a disadvantage rather\r\nthan an asset.\r\n\r\nBut it was when the Eysie moved out to meet the Captain that Rip's\r\nfingers closed about Dane's upper arm in an almost paralyzing grip.\r\n\r\n\"He knows--\"\r\n\r\nDane had not needed that bad news to be made vocal. Having seen the\r\nexploits of the Salariki duelists earlier, he had already caught the\r\nsignificance of that glide, of the way the I-S champion carried his net.\r\nThe Eysie had not had any last minute instruction in the use of Sargolian\r\nweapons--he had practiced and, by his stance, knew enough to make him a\r\nformidable menace. The clamor about the Queen's party rose as the\r\nbattle-wise eyes of the clansmen noted that and the odds against Jellico\r\nreached fantastic heights while the hearts of his crew sank.\r\n\r\nOnly Van Rycke was not disturbed. Now and then he raised his smelling\r\nbottle to his nose with an elegant gesture which matched those of the\r\nbefurred nobility around him, as if not a thought of care ruffled his\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe Eysie feinted in a opening which was a rather ragged copy of the\r\nyoung Salarik's more fluid moves some hours before. But, when the net\r\nsettled, Jellico was simply not there, his quick drop to one knee had\r\nsent the mesh flailing in an arc over his bowed shoulders with a good six\r\ninches to spare. And a cry of approval came not only from his comrades,\r\nbut from those natives who had been gamblers enough to venture their\r\nwagers on his performance.\r\n\r\nDane watched the field and the fighters through a watery film. The\r\ndiscomfort he had experienced since downing that mouthful of the cup of\r\nfriendship had tightened into a fist of pain clutching his middle in a\r\ntorturing grip. But he knew he must stick it out until Jellico's ordeal\r\nwas over. Someone stumbled against him and he glanced up to see Ali's\r\nface, a horrible gray-green under the tan, close to his own. For a moment\r\nthe Engineer-apprentice caught at his arm for support and then with a\r\nvisible effort straightened up. So he wasn't the only one--He looked for\r\nRip and Weeks and saw that they, too, were ill.\r\n\r\nBut for a moment all that mattered was the stretch of trampled earth and\r\nthe two men facing each other. The Eysie made another cast and this time,\r\nalthough Jellico was not caught, the slap of the mesh raised a red welt\r\non his forearm. So far the Captain had been content to play the defensive\r\nrole of retreat, studying his enemy, planning ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Eysie plainly thought the game his, that he had only to wait for a\r\nfavorable moment and cinch the victory. Dane began to think it had gone\r\non for weary hours. And he was dimly aware that the Salariki were also\r\nrestless. One or two shouted angrily at Jellico in their own tongue.\r\n\r\nThe end came suddenly. Jellico lost his footing, stumbled, and went down.\r\nBut before his men could move, the Eysie champion bounded forward, his\r\nnet whirling out. Only he never reached the Captain. In the very act of\r\nfalling Jellico had pulled his legs under him so that he was not supine\r\nbut crouched, and his net swept but at ground level, clipping the I-S man\r\nabout the shins, entangling his feet so that he crashed heavily to the\r\nsod and lay still.\r\n\r\n\"The whip--that Lalox whip trick!\" Wilcox's voice rose triumphantly above\r\nthe babble of the crowd. Using his net as if it had been a thong, Jellico\r\nhad brought down the Eysie with a move the other had not foreseen.\r\n\r\nBreathing hard, sweat running down his shoulders and making tracks\r\nthrough the powdery red dust which streaked him, Jellico got to his feet\r\nand walked over to the I-S champion who had not moved or made a sound\r\nsince his fall. The Captain went down on one knee to examine him.\r\n\r\n\"Kill! Kill!\" That was the Salariki, all their instinctive savagery\r\naroused.\r\n\r\nBut Jellico spoke to Groft. \"By our customs we do not kill the conquered.\r\nLet his friends bear him hence.\" He took the claw knife the Eysie still\r\nclutched in his hand and thrust it into his own belt. Then he faced the\r\nI-S party and Kallee.\r\n\r\n\"Take your man and get out!\" The rein he had kept on his temper these\r\npast days was growing very thin. \"You've made your last play here.\"\r\n\r\nKallee's thick lips drew back in something close to a Salarik snarl. But\r\nneither he nor his men made any reply. They bundled up their unconscious\r\nfighter and disappeared.\r\n\r\nOf their own return to the sanctuary of the Queen Dane had only the\r\ndimmest of memories afterwards. He had made the privacy of the forest\r\nroad before he yielded to the demands of his outraged interior. And after\r\nthat he had stumbled along with Van Rycke's hand under his arm, knowing\r\nfrom other miserable sounds that he was not alone in his torment.\r\n\r\nIt was some time later, months he thought when he first roused, that he\r\nfound himself lying in his bunk, feeling very weak and empty as if a\r\nlarge section of his middle had been removed, but also at peace with his\r\nworld. As he levered himself up the cabin had a nasty tendency to move\r\nslowly to the right as if he were a pivot on which it swung, and he had\r\nall the sensations of being in free fall though the Queen was still\r\nfirmly planeted. But that was only a minor discomfort compared to the\r\ndisturbance he remembered.\r\n\r\nFed the semi-liquid diet prescribed by Tau and served up by Mura to him\r\nand his fellow sufferers, he speedily got back his strength. But it had\r\nbeen a close call, he did not need Tau's explanation to underline that.\r\nWeeks had suffered the least of the four, he the most--though none of\r\nthem had had an easy time. And they had been out of circulation three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"The Eysie blasted last night,\" Rip informed him as they lounged in the\r\nsun on the ramp, sharing the blessed lazy hours of invalidism.\r\n\r\nBut somehow that news gave Dane no lift of spirit. \"I didn't think they'd\r\ngive up--\"\r\n\r\nRip shrugged. \"They may be off to make a dust-off before the Board. Only,\r\nthanks to Van and the Old Man, we're covered all along the line. There's\r\nnothing they can use against us to break our contract. And now we're in\r\nso solid they can't cut us out with the Salariki. Groft asked the Captain\r\nto teach him that trick with the net. I didn't know the Old Man knew\r\nLalox whip fighting--it's about one of the nastiest ways to get cut to\r\npieces in this universe--\"\r\n\r\n\"How's trade going?\"\r\n\r\nRip's sunniness clouded. \"Supplies have given out. Weeks had an\r\nidea--but it won't bring in Koros. That red wood he's so mad about, he's\r\npersuaded Van to stow some in the cargo holds since we have enough Koros\r\nstones to cover the voyage. Luckily the clansmen will take ordinary trade\r\ngoods in exchange for that and Weeks thinks it will sell on Terra. It's\r\ntough enough to turn a steel knife blade and yet it is light and easy to\r\nhandle when it's cured. Queer stuff and the color's interesting. That\r\nstockade of it planted around Groft's town has been up close to a hundred\r\nyears and not a sign of rot in a log of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"The storm priests sent for him. Some kind of a gabble-fest on the\r\nstar-star level, I gather. Otherwise we're almost ready to blast. And we\r\nknow what kind of cargo to bring next time.\"\r\n\r\nThey certainly did, Dane agreed. But he was not to idle away his morning.\r\nAn hour later a caravan came out of the forest, a line of complaining,\r\nburdened orgels, their tiny heads hanging low as they moaned their woes,\r\nthe hard life which sent them on their sluggish way with piles of red\r\nlogs lashed to their broad toads' backs. Weeks was in charge of the\r\nprocession and Dane went to work with the cargo plan Van had left, seeing\r\nthat the brilliant scarlet lengths were hoist into the lower cargo hatch\r\nand stacked according to the science of stowage. He discovered that Rip\r\nhad been right, the wood for all its incredible hardness was light of\r\nweight. Weak as he still was he could lift and stow a full sized log with\r\nno great difficulty. And he thought Weeks was correct in thinking that it\r\nwould sell on their home world. The color was novel, the durability an\r\nasset--it would not make fortunes as the Koros stones might, but every\r\nbit of profit helped and this cargo might cover their fielding fees on\r\nTerra.\r\n\r\nSinbad was in the cargo space when the first of the logs came in. With\r\nhis usual curiosity the striped tom cat prowled along the wood, sniffing\r\nindustriously. Suddenly he stopped short, spat and backed away, his spine\r\nfur a roughened crest. Having backed as far as the inner door he turned\r\nand slunk out. Puzzled, Dane gave the wood a swift inspection. There were\r\nno cracks or crevices in the smooth surfaces, but as he stopped over the\r\nlogs he became conscious of a sharp odor. So this was one scent of the\r\nperfumed planet Sinbad did not like. Dane laughed. Maybe they had better\r\nhave Weeks make a gate of the stuff and slip it across the ramp, keeping\r\nSinbad on ship board. Odd--it wasn't an unpleasant odor--at least to him\r\nit wasn't--just sharp and pungent. He sniffed again and was vaguely\r\nsurprised to discover that it was less noticeable now. Perhaps the wood\r\nwhen taken out of the sunlight lost its scent.\r\n\r\nThey packed the lower hold solid in accordance with the rules of stowage\r\nand locked the hatch before Van Rycke returned from his meeting with the\r\nstorm priests. When the Cargo-master came back he was followed by two\r\nservants bearing between them a chest.\r\n\r\nBut there was something in Van Rycke's attitude, apparent to those who\r\nknew him best, that proclaimed he was not too well pleased with his\r\nmorning's work. Sparing the feelings of the accompanying storm priests\r\nabout the offensiveness of the spacer Captain Jellico and Steen Wilcox\r\nwent out to receive them in the open. Dane watched from the hatch, aware\r\nthat in his present pariah-hood it would not be wise to venture closer.\r\n\r\nThe Terran Traders were protesting some course of action that the\r\nSalariki were firmly insistent upon. In the end the natives won and Kosti\r\nwas summoned to carry on board the chest which the servants had brought.\r\nHaving seen it carried safely inside the spacer, the aliens departed,\r\nbut Van Rycke was frowning and Jellico's fingers were beating a tattoo on\r\nhis belt as they came up the ramp.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" Jellico stated as he entered.\r\n\r\n\"It was none of my doing,\" Van Rycke snapped. \"I'll take risks if I have\r\nto--but there's something about this one--\" he broke off, two deep lines\r\nshowing between his thick brows. \"Well, you can't teach a sasseral to\r\nspit,\" he ended philosophically. \"We'll have to do the best we can.\"\r\n\r\nBut Jellico did not look at all happy as he climbed to the control\r\nsection. And before the hour was out the reason for the Captain's\r\nuneasiness was common property throughout the ship.\r\n\r\nHaving sampled the delights of off-world herbs, the Salariki were\r\ndetermined to not be cut off from their source of supply. Six Terran\r\nmonths from the present Sargolian date would come the great yearly feast\r\nof the Fifty Storms, and the priests were agreed that this year their\r\ninfluence and power would be doubled if they could offer the devout\r\ncertain privileges in the form of Terran plants. Consequently they had\r\nproduced and forced upon the reluctant Van Rycke the Koros collection of\r\ntheir order, with instructions that it be sold on Terra and the price\r\nreturned to them in the precious seeds and plants. In vain the\r\nCargo-master and Captain had pointed out that Galactic trade was a chancy\r\nthing at the best, that accident might prevent return of the Queen to\r\nSargol. But the priests had remained adamant and saw in all such\r\narguments only a devious attempt to raise prices. They quoted in their\r\nturn the information they had levered out of the Company men--that\r\nTraders had their code and that once pay had been given in advance the\r\ncontract _must_ be fulfilled. They, and they alone, wanted the full cargo\r\nof the Queen on her next voyage, and they were taking the one way they\r\nwere sure of achieving that result.\r\n\r\nSo a fortune in Koros stones which as yet did not rightfully belong to\r\nthe Traders was now in the Queen's strong-room and her crew were pledged\r\nby the strongest possible tie known in their Service to set down on\r\nSargol once more before the allotted time had passed. The Free Traders\r\ndid not like it, there was even a vaguely superstitious feeling that such\r\na bargain would inevitably draw ill luck to them. But they were left with\r\nno choice if they wanted to retain their influence with the Salariki.\r\n\r\n\"Cutting orbit pretty fine, aren't we?\" Ali asked Rip across the mess\r\ntable. \"I saw your two star man sweating it out before he came down to\r\nshoot the breeze with us rocket monkeys--\"\r\n\r\nRip nodded. \"Steen's double checked every computation and some he's done\r\nfour times.\" He ran his hands over his close cropped head with a weary\r\ngesture. As a semi-invalid he had been herded down with his fellows to\r\nswallow the builder Mura had concocted and Tau insisted that they take,\r\nbut he had been doing a half a night's work on the plotter under his\r\nchief's exacting eye before he came. \"The latest news is that, barring\r\naccident, we can make it with about three weeks' grace, give or take a\r\nday or two--\"\r\n\r\n\"Barring accident--\" the words rang in the air. Here on the frontiers of\r\nthe star lanes there were so many accidents, so many delays which could\r\nput a ship behind schedule. Only on the main star trails did the huge\r\nliners or Company ships attempt to keep on regularly timed trips. A Free\r\nTrader did not really dare to have an inelastic contract.\r\n\r\n\"What does Stotz say?\" Dane asked Ali.\r\n\r\n\"He says he can deliver. We don't have the headache about setting a\r\ncourse--you point the nose and we only give her the boost to send her\r\nalong.\"\r\n\r\nRip sighed. \"Yes--point her nose.\" He inspected his nails. \"Goodbye,\" he\r\nadded gravely. \"These won't be here by the time we planet here again.\r\nI'll have my fingers gnawed off to the first knuckle. Well, we lift at\r\nsix hours. Pleasant strap down.\" He drank the last of the stuff in his\r\nmug, made a face at the flavor, and got to his feet, due back at his post\r\nin control.\r\n\r\nDane, free of duty until the ship earthed, drifted back to his own cabin,\r\nsure of part of a night's undisturbed rest before they blasted off.\r\nSinbad was curled on his bunk. For some reason the cat had not been\r\nprowling the ship before take-off as he usually did. First he had sat on\r\nVan's desk and now he was here, almost as if he wanted human company.\r\nDane picked him up and Sinbad rumbled a purr, arching his head so that it\r\nrubbed against the young man's chin in an extremely uncharacteristic show\r\nof affection. Smoothing the fur along the cat's jaw line Dane carried him\r\nback to the Cargo-master's cabin.\r\n\r\nWith some hesitation he knocked at the panel and did not step in until he\r\nhad Van Rycke's muffled invitation. The Cargo-master was stretched on the\r\nbunk, two of the take off straps already fastened across his bulk as if\r\nhe intended to sleep through the blast-off.\r\n\r\n\"Sinbad, sir. Shall I stow him?\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke grunted an assent and Dane dropped the cat in the small hammock\r\nwhich was his particular station, fastening the safety cords. For once\r\nSinbad made no protest but rolled into a ball and was promptly fast\r\nasleep. For a moment or two Dane thought about this unnatural behavior\r\nand wondered if he should call it to the Cargo-master's attention.\r\nPerhaps on Sargol Sinbad had had _his_ equivalent of a friendship cup\r\nand needed a check-up by Tau.\r\n\r\n\"Stowage correct?\" the question, coming from Van Rycke, was also unusual.\r\nThe seal would not have been put across the hold lock had its contents\r\nnot been checked and rechecked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Dane replied woodenly, knowing he was still in the outer\r\ndarkness. \"There was just the wood--we stowed it according to chart.\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke grunted once more. \"Feeling top-layer again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. Any orders, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Blast-off's at six.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" Dane left the cabin, closing the panel carefully behind him.\r\nWould he--or could he--he thought drearily, get back in Van Rycke's\r\nprofit column again? Sargol had been unlucky as far as he was concerned.\r\nFirst he had made that stupid mistake and then he got sick and now--And\r\nnow--what _was_ the matter? Was it just the general attack of nerves over\r\ntheir voyage and the commitments which forced their haste, or was it\r\nsomething else? He could not rid himself of a vague sense that the Queen\r\nwas about to take off into real trouble. And he did not like the\r\nsensation at all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nHEADACHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThey lifted from Sargol on schedule and went into Hyper also on schedule.\r\nFrom that point on there was nothing to do but wait out the usual dull\r\ntime of flight between systems and hope that Steen Wilcox had plotted a\r\ncourse which would cut that flight time to a minimum. But this voyage\r\nthere was little relaxation once they were in Hyper. No matter when Dane\r\ndropped into the mess cabin, which was the common meeting place of the\r\nspacer, he was apt to find others there before him, usually with a mug of\r\none of Mura's special brews close at hand, speculating about their\r\nlanding date.\r\n\r\nDane, himself, once he had thrown off the lingering effects of his\r\nSargolian illness, applied time to his studies. When he had first joined\r\nthe Queen as a recruit straight out of the training Pool, he had speedily\r\nlearned that all the ten years of intensive study then behind him had\r\nonly been an introduction to the amount he still had to absorb before he\r\ncould take his place as an equal with such a trader as Van Rycke--if he\r\nhad the stuff which would raise him in time to that exalted level. While\r\nhe had still had his superior's favor he had dared to treat him as an\r\ninstructor, going to him with perplexing problems of stowage or barter.\r\nBut now he had no desire to intrude upon the Cargo-master, and doggedly\r\nwrestled with the microtapes of old records on his own, painfully\r\nworking out the why and wherefor for any departure from the regular\r\nprocedure. He had no inkling of his own future status--whether the return\r\nto Terra would find him permanently earthed. And he would ask no\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThey had been four days of ship's time in Hyper when Dane walked into the\r\nmess cabin, tired after his work with old records, to discover no Mura\r\nbusy in the galley beyond, no brew steaming on the heat coil. Rip sat at\r\nthe table, his long legs stuck out, his usually happy face very sober.\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Dane reached for a mug, then seeing no pot of drink, put\r\nit back in place.\r\n\r\n\"Frank's sick--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Dane turned. Illness such as they had run into on Sargol had a\r\nlogical base. But illness on board ship was something else.\r\n\r\n\"Tau has him isolated. He has a bad headache and he blacked out when he\r\ntried to sit up. Tau's running tests.\"\r\n\r\nDane sat down. \"Could be something he ate--\"\r\n\r\nRip shook his head. \"He wasn't at the feast--remember? And he didn't eat\r\nanything from outside, he swore that to Tau. In fact he didn't go dirt\r\nmuch while we were down--\"\r\n\r\nThat was only too true as Dane could now recall. And the fact that the\r\nsteward had not been at the feast, had not sampled native food products,\r\nwiped out the simplest and most comforting reasons for his present\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n\"What's this about Frank?\" Ali stood in the doorway. \"He said yesterday\r\nthat he had a headache. But now Tau has him shut off--\"\r\n\r\n\"But he wasn't at that feast.\" Ali stopped short as the implications of\r\nthat struck him. \"How's Tang feeling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine--why?\" The Com-tech had come up behind Kamil and was answering for\r\nhimself. \"Why this interest in the state of my health?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank's down with something--in isolation,\" Rip replied bluntly. \"Did he\r\ndo anything out of the ordinary when we were off ship?\"\r\n\r\nFor a long moment the other stared at Shannon and then he shook his head.\r\n\"No. And he wasn't dirt-side to any extent either. So Tau's running\r\ntests--\" He lapsed into silence. None of them wished to put their\r\nthoughts into words.\r\n\r\nDane picked up the microtape he had brought with him and went on down the\r\ncorridor to return it. The panel of the cargo office was ajar and to his\r\nrelief he found Van Rycke out. He shoved the tape back in its case and\r\npulled out the next one. Sinbad was there, not in his own private\r\nhammock, but sprawled out on the Cargo-master's bunk. He watched Dane\r\nlazily, mouthing a silent mew of welcome. For some reason since they had\r\nblasted from Sargol the cat had been lazy--as if his adventures afield\r\nthere had sapped much of his vitality.\r\n\r\n\"Why aren't you out working?\" Dane asked as he leaned over to scratch\r\nunder a furry chin raised for the benefit of such a caress. \"You inspect\r\nthe hold lately, boy?\"\r\n\r\nSinbad merely blinked and after the manner of his species looked\r\ninfinitely bored. As Dane turned to go the Cargo-master came in. He\r\nshowed no surprise at Dane's presence. Instead he reached out and\r\nfingered the label of the tape Dane had just chosen. After a glance at\r\nthe identifying symbol he took it out of his assistant's hand, plopped it\r\nback in its case, and stood for a moment eyeing the selection of past\r\nvoyage records. With a tongue-click of satisfaction he pulled out another\r\nand tossed it across the desk to Dane.\r\n\r\n\"See what you can make out of this tangle,\" he ordered. But Dane's\r\nshoulders went back as if some weight had been lifted from them. The old\r\neasiness was still lacking, but he was no longer exiled to the outer\r\ndarkness of Van Rycke's displeasure.\r\n\r\nHolding the microtape as if it were a first grade Koros stone Dane went\r\nback to his own cabin, snapped the tape into his reader, adjusted the ear\r\nbuttons and lay back on his bunk to listen.\r\n\r\nHe was deep in the intricacy of a deal so complicated that he was lost\r\nafter the first two moves, when he opened his eyes to see Ali at the door\r\npanel. The Engineer-apprentice made an emphatic beckoning wave and Dane\r\nslipped off the ear buttons.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" His question lacked a cordial note.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to have help.\" Ali was terse. \"Kosti's blacked out!\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Dane sat up and dropped his feet to the deck in almost one\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\"I can't shift him alone,\" Ali stated the obvious. The giant jetman was\r\nalmost double his size. \"We must get him to his quarters. And I won't ask\r\nStotz--\"\r\n\r\nFor a perfectly good reason Dane knew. An assistant--two of the\r\napprentices--could go sick, but their officers' continued good health\r\nmeant the most to the Queen. If some infection were aboard it would be\r\nbetter for Ali and himself to be exposed, than to have Johan Stotz with\r\nall his encyclopedic knowledge of the ship's engines contract any\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThey found the jetman half sitting, half lying in the short foot or so of\r\ncorridor which led to his own cubby. He had been making for his quarters\r\nwhen the seizure had taken him. And by the time the two reached his side,\r\nhe was beginning to come around, moaning, his hands going to his head.\r\n\r\nTogether they got him on his feet and guided him to his bunk where he\r\ncollapsed again, dead weight they had to push into place. Dane looked at\r\nAli--\r\n\r\n\"Tau?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't had time to call him yet.\" Ali was jerking at the thigh straps\r\nwhich fastened Kosti's space boots.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go.\" Glad for the task Dane sped up the ladder to the next section\r\nand threaded the narrow side hall to the Medic's cabin where he knocked\r\non the panel.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause before Craig Tau looked out, deep lines of weariness\r\nbracketing his mouth, etched between his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Kosti, sir,\" Dane gave his bad news quickly. \"He's collapsed. We got him\r\nto his cabin--\"\r\n\r\nTau showed no sign of surprise. His hand shot out for his kit.\r\n\r\n\"You touched him?\" At the other's nod he added an order. \"Stay in your\r\nquarters until I have a chance to look you over--understand?\"\r\n\r\nDane had no chance to answer, the Medic was already on his way. He went\r\nto his own cabin, understanding the reason for his imprisonment, but\r\ninwardly rebelling against it. Rather than sit idle he snapped on the\r\nreader--but, although facts and figures were dunned into his ears--he\r\nreally heard very little. He couldn't apply himself--not with a new\r\nspecter leering at him from the bulkhead.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the space lanes were not to be numbered, death walked\r\namong the stars a familiar companion of all spacemen. And to the Free\r\nTrader it was the extra and invisible crewman on every ship that raised.\r\nBut there were deaths and deaths--And Dane could not forget the gruesome\r\nlegends Van Rycke collected avidly as his hobby--had recorded in his\r\nprivate library of the folk lore of space.\r\n\r\nStories such as that of the ghostly \"New Hope\" carrying refugees from the\r\nfirst Martian Rebellion--the ship which had lifted for the stars but had\r\nnever arrived, which wandered for a timeless eternity, a derelict in free\r\nfall, its port closed but the warning \"dead\" lights on at its nose--a\r\nship which through five centuries had been sighted only by a spacer in\r\nsimilar distress. Such stories were numerous. There were other tales of\r\n\"plague\" ships wandering free with their dead crews, or discovered and\r\nshot into some sun by a patrol cruiser so that they might not carry their\r\ninfection farther. Plague--the nebulous \"worst\" the Traders had to face.\r\nDane screwed his eyes shut, tried to concentrate upon the droning voice\r\nin his ears, but he could not control his thoughts nor--his fears.\r\n\r\nAt a touch on his arm he started so wildly that he jerked the cord loose\r\nfrom the reader and sat up, somewhat shamefaced, to greet Tau. At the\r\nMedic's orders he stripped for one of the most complete examinations he\r\nhad ever undergone outside a quarantine port. It included an almost\r\nmicroscopic inspection of the skin on his neck and shoulders, but when\r\nTau had done he gave a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you haven't got it--at least you don't show any signs yet,\" he\r\namended his first statement almost before the words were out of his\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"What were you looking for?\"\r\n\r\nTau took time out to explain. \"Here,\" his fingers touched the small\r\nhollow at the base of Dane's throat and then swung him around and\r\nindicated two places on the back of his neck and under his shoulder\r\nblades. \"Kosti and Mura both have red eruptions here. It's as if they\r\nhave been given an injection of some narcotic.\" Tau sat down on the jump\r\nseat while Dane dressed. \"Kosti was dirt-side--he might have picked up\r\nsomething--\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mura--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" Tau brought his fist down on the edge of the bunk. \"Frank\r\nhardly left the ship--yet he showed the first signs. On the other hand\r\nyou are all right so far and you were off ship. And Ali's clean and he\r\nwas with you on the hunt. We'll just have to wait and see.\" He got up\r\nwearily. \"If your head begins to ache,\" he told Dane, \"you get back here\r\nin a hurry and stay put--understand?\"\r\n\r\nAs Dane learned all the other members of the crew were given the same\r\ntype of inspection. But none of them showed the characteristic marks\r\nwhich meant trouble. They were on course for Terra--but--and that but\r\nmust have loomed large in all their minds--once there would they be\r\nallowed to land? Could they even hope for a hearing? Plague ship--Tau\r\nmust find the answer before they came into normal space about their own\r\nsolar system or they were in for such trouble as made a broken contract\r\nseem the simplest of mishaps.\r\n\r\nKosti and Mura were in isolation. There were volunteers for nursing and\r\nTau, unable to be in two places at once, finally picked Weeks to look\r\nafter his crewmate in the engineering section.\r\n\r\nThere was doubling up of duties. Tau could no longer share with Mura the\r\ncare of the hydro garden so Van Rycke took over. While Dane found himself\r\nin charge of the galley and, while he did not have Mura's deft hand at\r\ndisguising the monotonous concentrates to the point they resembled fresh\r\nfood, after a day or two he began to experiment cautiously and produced a\r\nstew which brought some short words of appreciation from Captain Jellico.\r\n\r\nThey all breathed a sigh of relief when, after three days, no more signs\r\nof the mysterious illness showed on new members of the crew. It became\r\nroutine to parade before Tau stripped to the waist each morning for the\r\ninspection of the danger points, and the Medic's vigilance did not\r\nrelax.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime neither Mura nor Kosti appeared to suffer. Once the\r\ninitial stages of headaches and blackouts were passed, the patients\r\nlapsed into a semi-conscious state as if they were under sedation of some\r\ntype. They would eat, if the food was placed in their mouths, but they\r\ndid not seem to know what was going on about them, nor did they answer\r\nwhen spoken to.\r\n\r\nTau, between visits to them, worked feverishly in his tiny lab, analyzing\r\nblood samples, reading the records of obscure diseases, trying to find\r\nthe reason for their attacks. But as yet his discoveries were exactly\r\nnothing. He had come out of his quarters and sat in limp exhaustion at\r\nthe mess table while Dane placed before him a mug of stimulating caf-hag.\r\n\r\n\"I don't get it!\" The Medic addressed the table top rather than the\r\namateur cook. \"It's a poison of some kind. Kosti went dirt-side--Mura\r\ndidn't. Yet Mura came down with it first. And we didn't ship any food\r\nfrom Sargol. Neither did he eat any while we were there. Unless he did\r\nand we didn't know about it. If I could just bring him to long enough to\r\nanswer a couple of questions!\" Sighing he dropped his weary head on his\r\nfolded arms and within seconds was asleep.\r\n\r\nDane put the mug back on the heating unit and sat down at the other end\r\nof the table. He did not have the heart to shake Tau into\r\nwakefulness--let the poor devil get a slice of bunk time, he certainly\r\nneeded it after the fatigues of the past four days.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke passed along the corridor on his way to the hydro, Sinbad at\r\nhis heels. But in a moment the cat was back, leaping up on Dane's knee.\r\nHe did not curl up, but rubbed against the young man's arm, finally\r\nreaching up with a paw to touch Dane's chin, uttering one of the\r\nsoundless, mews which were his bid for attention.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter, boy?\" Dane fondled the cat's ears. \"You haven't got\r\na headache--have you?\" In that second a wild surmise came into his mind.\r\nSinbad had been planet-side on Sargol as much as he could, and on ship\r\nboard he was equally at home in all their cabins--could he be the carrier\r\nof the disease?\r\n\r\nA good idea--only if it were true, then logically the second victim\r\nshould have been Van, or Dane--whereas Sinbad lingered most of the time\r\nin their cabins--not Kosti. The cat, as far as he knew, had never shown\r\nany particular fondness for the jetman and certainly did not sleep in\r\nKarl's quarters. No--that point did not fit. But he would mention it to\r\nTau--no use overlooking anything--no matter how wild.\r\n\r\nIt was the sequence of victims which puzzled them all. As far as Tau had\r\nbeen able to discover Mura and Kosti had nothing much in common except\r\nthat they were crewmates on the same spacer. They did not bunk in the\r\nsame section, their fields of labor were totally different, they had no\r\nspecial food or drink tastes in common, they were not even of the same\r\nrace. Frank Mura was one of the few descendants of a mysterious (or now\r\nmysterious) people who had had their home on a series of islands in one\r\nof Terra's seas, islands which almost a hundred years before had been\r\nswallowed up in a series of world-rending quakes--Japan was the ancient\r\nname of that nation. While Karl Kosti had come from the once thickly\r\npopulated land masses half the planet away which had borne the\r\ngeographical name of \"Europe.\" No, all the way along the two victims had\r\nonly very general meeting points--they both shipped on the Solar Queen\r\nand they were both of Terran birth.\r\n\r\nTau stirred and sat up, blinking bemusedly at Dane, then pushed back his\r\nwiry black hair and assumed a measure of alertness. Dane dropped the now\r\npurring cat in the Medic's lap and in a few sentences outlined his\r\nsuspicion. Tau's hands closed about Sinbad.\r\n\r\n\"There's a chance in that--\" He looked a little less beat and he drank\r\nthirstily from the mug Dane gave him for the second time. Then he hurried\r\nout with Sinbad under one arm--bound for his lab.\r\n\r\nDane slicked up the galley, trying to put things away as neatly as Mura\r\nkept them. He didn't have much faith in the Sinbad lead, but in this case\r\neverything must be checked out.\r\n\r\nWhen the Medic did not appear during the rest of the ship's day Dane was\r\nnot greatly concerned. But he was alerted to trouble when Ali came in\r\nwith an inquiry and a complaint.\r\n\r\n\"Seen anything of Craig?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's in the lab,\" Dane answered.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't answer my knock,\" Ali protested. \"And Weeks says he hasn't\r\nbeen in to see Karl all day--\"\r\n\r\nThat did catch Dane's attention. Had his half hunch been right? Was Tau\r\non the trail of a discovery which had kept him chained to the lab? But it\r\nwasn't like the Medic not to look in on his patients.\r\n\r\n\"You're sure he isn't in the lab?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you that he didn't answer my knock. I didn't open the panel--\"\r\nBut now Ali was already in the corridor heading back the way he had come,\r\nwith Dane on his heels, an unwelcome explanation for that silence in both\r\ntheir minds. And their fears were reinforced by what they heard as they\r\napproached the panel--a low moan wrung out of unbearable pain. Dane\r\nthrust the sliding door open.\r\n\r\nTau had slipped from his stool to the floor. His hands were at his head\r\nwhich rolled from side to side as if he were trying to quiet some agony.\r\nDane stripped down the Medic's under tunic. There was no need to make a\r\ncareful examination, in the hollow of Craig Tau's throat was the\r\ntell-tale red blotch.\r\n\r\n\"Sinbad!\" Dane glanced about the cabin. \"Did Sinbad get out past you?\" he\r\ndemanded of the puzzled Ali.\r\n\r\n\"No--I haven't seen him all day--\"\r\n\r\nYet the cat was nowhere in the tiny cabin and it had no concealed hiding\r\nplace. To make doubly sure Dane secured the panel before they carried Tau\r\nto his bunk. The Medic had blacked out again, passed into the lethargic\r\nsecond stage of the malady. At least he was out of the pain which\r\nappeared to be the worst symptom of the disease.\r\n\r\n\"It must be Sinbad!\" Dane said as he made his report directly to Captain\r\nJellico. \"And yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he's been staying in Van's cabin,\" the Captain mused. \"And you've\r\nhandled him, he slept on your bunk. Yet you and Van are all right. I\r\ndon't understand that. Anyway--to be on the safe side--we'd better find\r\nand isolate him before--\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't have to underline any words for the grim-faced men who\r\nlistened. With Tau--their one hope of fighting the disease gone--they had\r\na black future facing them.\r\n\r\nThey did not have to search for Sinbad. Dane coming down to his own\r\nsection found the cat crouched before the panel of Van Rycke's cabin, his\r\neyes glued to the thin crack of the door. Dane scooped him up and took\r\nhim to the small cargo space intended for the safeguarding of choice\r\nitems of commerce. To his vast surprise Sinbad began fighting wildly as\r\nhe opened the hatch, kicking and then slashing with ready claws. The cat\r\nseemed to go mad and Dane had all he could do to shut him in. When he\r\nsnapped the panel he heard Sinbad launch himself against the barrier as\r\nif to batter his way out. Dane, blood welling in several deep scratches,\r\nwent in search of first aid. But some suspicion led him to pause as he\r\npassed Van Rycke's door. And when his knock brought no answer he pushed\r\nthe panel open.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke lay on his bunk, his eyes half closed in a way which had become\r\nonly too familiar to the crew of the Solar Queen. And Dane knew that when\r\nhe looked for it he would find the mark of the strange plague on the\r\nCargo-master's body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nPLAGUE!\r\n\r\n\r\nJellico and Steen Wilcox pored over the few notes Tau had made before he\r\nwas stricken. But apparently the Medic had found nothing to indicate that\r\nSinbad was the carrier of any disease. Meanwhile the Captain gave orders\r\nfor the cat to be confined. A difficult task--since Sinbad crouched close\r\nto the door of the storage cabin and was ready to dart out when food was\r\ntaken in for him. Once he got a good way down the corridor before Dane\r\nwas able to corner and return him to keeping.\r\n\r\nDane, Ali and Weeks took on the full care of the four sick men, leaving\r\nthe few regular duties of the ship to the senior officers, while Rip was\r\ninstalled in charge of the hydro garden.\r\n\r\nMura, the first to be taken ill, showed no change. He was semi-conscious,\r\nhe swallowed food if it were put in his mouth, he responded to nothing\r\naround him. And Kosti, Tau, and Van Rycke followed the same pattern.\r\nThey still held morning inspection of those on their feet for signs of a\r\nnew outbreak, but when no one else went down during the next two days,\r\nthey regained a faint spark of hope.\r\n\r\nHope which was snapped out when Ali brought the news that Stotz could not\r\nbe roused and must have taken ill during a sleep period. One more inert\r\npatient was added to the list--and nothing learned about how he was\r\ninfected. Except that they could eliminate Sinbad, since the cat had been\r\nin custody during the time Stotz had apparently contracted the disease.\r\n\r\nWeeks, Ali and Dane, though they were in constant contact with the sick\r\nmen, and though Dane had repeatedly handled Sinbad, continued to be\r\nimmune. A fact, Dane thought more than once, which must have\r\nsignificance--if someone with Tau's medical knowledge had been able to\r\nstudy it. By all rights they should be the most susceptible--but the\r\nopposite seemed true. And Wilcox duly noted that fact among the data they\r\nhad recorded.\r\n\r\nIt became a matter of watching each other, waiting for another collapse.\r\nAnd they were not surprised when Tang Ya reeled into the mess, his face\r\nlivid and drawn with pain. Rip and Dane got him to his cabin before he\r\nblacked out. But all they could learn from him during the interval before\r\nhe lost consciousness was that his head was bursting and he couldn't\r\nstand it. Over his limp body they stared at one another bleakly.\r\n\r\n\"Six down,\" Ali observed, \"and six to go. How do you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tired, that's all. What I don't understand is that once they go into\r\nthis stupor they just stay. They don't get any worse, they have no rise\r\nin temperature--it's as if they are in a modified form of cold sleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Tang?\" Rip asked from the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Usual pattern,\" Ali answered, \"He's sleeping. Got a pain, Fella?\"\r\n\r\nRip shook his head. \"Right as a Com-unit. I don't get it. Why does it\r\nstrike Tang who didn't even hit dirt much--and yet you keep on--?\"\r\n\r\nDane grimaced. \"If we had an answer to that, maybe we'd know what caused\r\nthe whole thing--\"\r\n\r\nAli's eyes narrowed. He was staring straight at the unconscious Com-tech\r\nas if he did not see that supine body at all. \"I wonder if we've been\r\nsalted--\" he said slowly.\r\n\r\n\"We've been _what?_\" Dane demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, we three--with Weeks--drank that brew of the Salariki, didn't\r\nwe? And we--\"\r\n\r\n\"Were as sick as Venusian gobblers afterwards,\" agreed Rip.\r\n\r\nLight dawned. \"Do you mean--\" began Dane.\r\n\r\n\"So that's it!\" flashed Rip.\r\n\r\n\"It might just be,\" Ali said. \"Do you remember how the settlers on\r\nCamblyne brought their Terran cattle through the first year? They fed\r\nthem salt mixed with fansel grass. The result was that the herds didn't\r\ntake the fansel grass fever when they turned them out to pasture in the\r\ndry season. All right, maybe we had our 'salt' in that drink. The\r\nfansel-salt makes the cattle filthy sick when it's forced down their\r\nthroats, but after they recover they're immune to the fever. And nobody\r\non Camblyne buys unsalted cattle now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds logical,\" admitted Rip. \"But how are we going to prove it?\"\r\n\r\nAli's face was black once more. \"Probably by elimination,\" he said\r\nmorosely. \"If we keep our feet and all the rest go down--that's our\r\nproof.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we ought to be able to do something--\" protested Shannon.\r\n\r\n\"Just how?\" Ali's slender brows arched. \"Do you have a gallon of that\r\nSalariki brew on board you can serve out? We don't know what was in it.\r\nNor are we sure that this whole idea has any value.\"\r\n\r\nAll of them had had first aid and basic preventive medicine as part of\r\ntheir training, but the more advanced laboratory experimentation was\r\nbeyond their knowledge and skill. Had Tau still been on his feet perhaps\r\nhe could have traced that lead and brought order out of the chaos which\r\nwas closing in upon the Solar Queen. But, though they reported their\r\nsuggestion to the Captain, Jellico was powerless to do anything about it.\r\nIf the four who had shared that upsetting friendship cup were immune to\r\nthe doom which now overhung the ship, there was no possible way for them\r\nto discover why or how.\r\n\r\nShip's time came to have little meaning. And they were not surprised when\r\nSteen Wilcox slipped from his seat before the computer--to be stowed away\r\nwith what had become a familiar procedure. Only Jellico withstood the\r\ncontagion apart from the younger four, taking his turn at caring for the\r\nhelpless men. There was no change in their condition. They neither roused\r\nnor grew worse as the hours and then the days sped by. But each of those\r\nunits of time in passing brought them nearer to greater danger. Sooner or\r\nlater they must make the transition out of Hyper into system space, and\r\nthe jump out of warp was something not even a veteran took lightly. Rip's\r\nround face thinned while they watched. Jellico was still functioning. But\r\nif the Captain collapsed the whole responsibility for the snap-out would\r\nfall directly on Shannon. An infinitesimal error would condemn them to\r\nalmost hopeless wandering--perhaps for ever.\r\n\r\nDane and Ali relieved Rip of all duty but that which kept him chained in\r\nWilcox's chair before the computers. He went over and over the data of\r\nthe course the Astrogator had set. And Captain Jellico, his eyes sunk in\r\ndark pits, checked and rechecked.\r\n\r\nWhen the fatal moment came Ali manned the engine room with Weeks at his\r\nelbow to tend the controls the acting-Engineer could not reach. And Dane,\r\nhaving seen the sick all safely stowed in crash webbing, came up to the\r\ncontrol cabin, riding out the transfer in Tang Ya's place.\r\n\r\nRip's voice hoarsened into a croak, calling out the data. Dane, though he\r\nhad had basic theory, was completely lost before Shannon had finished the\r\nfirst set of co-ordinates. But Jellico replied, hands playing across the\r\npilot's board.\r\n\r\n\"Stand-by for snap-out--\" the croak went down to the engines where Ali\r\nnow held Stotz's post.\r\n\r\n\"Engines ready!\" The voice came back, thinned by its journey from the\r\nQueen's interior.\r\n\r\n\"Ought-five-nine--\" That was Jellico.\r\n\r\nDane found himself suddenly unable to watch. He shut his eyes and braced\r\nhimself against the vertigo of snap-out. It came and he whirled\r\nsickeningly through unstable space. Then he was sitting in the laced\r\nCom-tech's seat looking at Rip.\r\n\r\nRunnels of sweat streaked Shannon's brown face. There was a damp patch\r\ndarkening his tunic between his shoulder blades, a patch which it would\r\ntake both of Dane's hands to cover.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he did not raise his head to look at the vision plate which\r\nwould tell him whether or not they had made it. But when he did familiar\r\nconstellations made the patterns they knew. They were out--and they\r\ncouldn't be too far off the course Wilcox had plotted. There was still\r\nthe system run to make--but snap-out was behind them. Rip gave a deep\r\nsigh and buried his head in his hands.\r\n\r\nWith a throb of fear Dane unhooked his safety belt and hurried over to\r\nhim. When he clutched at Shannon's shoulder the Astrogator-apprentice's\r\nhead rolled limply. Was Rip down with the illness too? But the other\r\nmuttered and opened his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Does your head ache?\" Dane shook him.\r\n\r\n\"Head? No--\" Rip's words came drowsily. \"Jus' sleepy--so sleepy--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not seem to be in pain. But Dane's hands were shaking as he\r\nhoisted the other out of his seat and half carried-half led him to his\r\ncabin, praying as he went that it was only fatigue and not the disease.\r\nThe ship was on auto now until Jellico as pilot set a course--\r\n\r\nDane got Rip down on the bunk and stripped off his tunic. The fine-drawn\r\nface of the sleeper looked wan against the foam rest, and he snuggled\r\ninto the softness like a child as he turned over and curled up. But his\r\nskin was clear--it was real sleep and not the plague which had claimed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nImpulse sent Dane back to the control cabin. He was not an experienced\r\npilot officer, but there might be some assistance he could offer the\r\nCaptain now that Rip was washed out, perhaps for hours.\r\n\r\nJellico hunched before the smaller computer, feeding pilot tape into its\r\nslot. His face was a skull under a thin coating of skin, the bones\r\nmarking it sharply at jaw, nose and eye socket.\r\n\r\n\"Shannon down?\" His voice was a mere whisper of its powerful self, he did\r\nnot turn his head.\r\n\r\n\"He's just worn out, sir,\" Dane hastened to give reassurance. \"The marks\r\naren't on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"When he comes around tell him the co-ords are in,\" Jellico murmured.\r\n\"See he checks course in ten hours--\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir--\" Dane's protest failed as he watched the Captain struggle to\r\nhis feet, pulling himself up with shaking hands. As Thorson reached\r\nforward to steady the other, one of those hands tore at tunic collar,\r\nripping loose the sealing--\r\n\r\nThere was no need for explanation--the red splotch signaled from\r\nJellico's sweating throat. He kept his feet, holding out against the\r\nwaves of pain by sheer will power. Then Dane had a grip on him, got him\r\naway from the computer, hoping he could keep him going until they reached\r\nJellico's cabin.\r\n\r\nSomehow they made that journey, being greeted with raucous screams from\r\nthe Hoobat. Furiously Dane slapped the cage, setting it to swinging and\r\nso silencing the creature which stared at him with round, malignant eyes\r\nas he got the Captain to bed.\r\n\r\nOnly four of them on their feet now, Dane thought bleakly as he left the\r\ncabin. If Rip came out of it in time they could land--Dane's breath\r\ncaught as he made himself face up to the fact that Shannon might be ill,\r\nthat it might be up to him to bring the Queen in for a landing. And in\r\nwhere? The Terra quarantine was Luna City on the Moon. But let them\r\nsignal for a set-down there--let them describe what had happened and they\r\nmight face death as a plague ship.\r\n\r\nWearily he climbed down to the mess cabin to discover Weeks and Ali there\r\nbefore him. They did not look up as he entered.\r\n\r\n\"Old Man's got it,\" he reported.\r\n\r\n\"Rip?\" was Ali's crossing question.\r\n\r\n\"Asleep. He passed out--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" Weeks swung around.\r\n\r\n\"Worn out,\" Dane amended. \"Captain fed in a pilot tape before he gave\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"So--now we are three,\" was Ali's comment. \"Where do we set down--Luna\r\nCity?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they let us,\" Dane hinted at the worst.\r\n\r\n\"But they've got to let us!\" Weeks exclaimed. \"We can't just wander\r\naround out here--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's been done,\" Ali reminded them brutally and that silenced Weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Did the Old Man set Luna?\" After a long pause Ali inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't check,\" Dane confessed. \"He was giving out and I had to get him\r\nto his bunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be well to know.\" The Engineer-apprentice got up, his movements\r\nlacking much of the elastic spring which was normally his. When he\r\nclimbed to control both the others followed him.\r\n\r\nAli's slender fingers played across a set of keys and in the small screen\r\nmounting on the computer a set of figures appeared. Dane took up the\r\nmaster course book, read the connotation and blinked.\r\n\r\n\"Not Luna?\" Ali asked.\r\n\r\n\"No. But I don't understand. This must be for somewhere in the asteroid\r\nbelt.\"\r\n\r\nAli's lips stretched into a pale caricature of a smile. \"Good for the Old\r\nMan, he still had his wits about him, even after the bug bit him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why are we going to the asteroids?\" Weeks asked reasonably enough.\r\n\"There're Medics at Luna City--they can help us--\"\r\n\r\n\"They can handle known diseases,\" Ali pointed out. \"But what of the\r\nCode?\"\r\n\r\nWeeks dropped into the Com-tech's place as if some of the stiffening had\r\nvanished from his thin but sturdy legs. \"They wouldn't do that--\" he\r\nprotested, but his eyes said that he knew that they might--they well\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no? Face the facts, man,\" Ali sounded almost savage. \"We come from a\r\nfrontier planet, we're a plague ship--\"\r\n\r\nHe did not have to underline that. They all knew too well the danger in\r\nwhich they now stood.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody's died yet,\" Weeks tried to find an opening in the net being\r\ndrawn about them.\r\n\r\n\"And nobody's recovered,\" Ali crushed that thread of hope. \"We don't know\r\nwhat it is, how it is contracted--anything about it. Let us make a report\r\nsaying that and you know what will happen--don't you?\"\r\n\r\nThey weren't sure of the details, but they could guess.\r\n\r\n\"So I say,\" Ali continued, \"the Old Man was right when he set us on an\r\nevasion course. If we can stay out until we really know what is the\r\nmatter we'll have some chance of talking over the high brass at Luna when\r\nwe do planet--\"\r\n\r\nIn the end they decided not to interfere with the course the Captain had\r\nset. It would take them into the fringes of solar civilization, but give\r\nthem a fighting chance at solving their problem before they had to report\r\nto the authorities. In the meantime they tended their charges, let Rip\r\nsleep, and watched each other with desperate but hidden intentness, ready\r\nfor another to be stricken. However, they remained, although almost\r\nstupid with fatigue at times, reasonably healthy. Time was proving that\r\ntheir guess had been correct--they had been somehow inoculated against\r\nthe germ or virus which had struck the ship.\r\n\r\nRip slept for twenty-four hours, ship time, and then came into the mess\r\ncabin ravenously hungry, to catch up on both food and news. And he\r\nrefused to join with the prevailing pessimistic view of the future.\r\nInstead he was sure that their own immunity having been proven, they had\r\na talking point to use with the medical officials at Luna and he was\r\neager to alter course directly for the quarantine station. Only the\r\ncombined arguments of the other three made him, unwillingly, agree to a\r\nshort delay.\r\n\r\nAnd how grateful they should be for Captain Jellico's foresight they\r\nlearned within the next day. Ali was at the com-unit, trying to pick up\r\nSolarian news reports. When the red alert flashed on throughout the ship\r\nit brought the others hurrying to the control cabin. The code squeaks\r\nwere magnified as Ali switched on the receiver full strength, to be\r\ntranslated as he pressed a second button.\r\n\r\n\"Repeat, repeat, repeat. Free Trader, Solar Queen, Terra Registry\r\n65-724910-Jk, suspected plague ship--took off from infected planet. Warn\r\noff--warn off--report such ship to Luna Station. Solar Queen from\r\ninfected planet--to be warned off and reported.\" The same message was\r\nrepeated three times before going off ether.\r\n\r\nThe four in the control cabin looked at each other blankly.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Dane broke the silence, \"how did they know? We haven't reported\r\nin--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Eysies!\" Ali had the answer ready. \"That I-S ship must be having the\r\nsame sort of trouble and reported to her Company. They would include us\r\nin their report and believe that we were infected too--or it would be\r\neasy to convince the authorities that we were.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" Rip's eyes were narrowed slits as he leaned back against the\r\nwall. \"Look at the facts. The Survey ship which charted Sargol--they were\r\ndirt-side there about three-four months. Yet they gave it a clean bill of\r\nhealth and put it up for trading rights auction. Then Cam bought those\r\nrights--he made at least two trips in and out before he was blasted on\r\nLimbo. No infection bothered him or Survey--\"\r\n\r\n\"But you've got to admit it hit us,\" Weeks protested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and the Eysie ship was able to foresee it--report us before we\r\nsnapped out of Hyper. Sounds almost as if they expected us to carry\r\nplague, doesn't it?\" Shannon wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"Planted?\" Ali frowned at the banks of controls. \"But how--no Eysie came\r\non board--no Salarik either, except for the cub who showed us what they\r\nthought of catnip.\"\r\n\r\nRip shrugged. \"How would I know how they did--\" he was beginning when\r\nDane cut in:\r\n\r\n\"If they didn't know about our immunity the Queen might stay in Hyper and\r\nnever come out--there wouldn't be anyone to set the snap-out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right enough. But on the chance that somebody did keep on his feet and\r\nbring her home, they were ready with a cover. If no one raises a howl\r\nSargol will be written off the charts as infected, I-S sits on her tail\r\nfins a year or so and then she promotes an investigation before the\r\nBoard. The Survey records are trotted out--no infection recorded. So they\r\nsend in a Patrol Probe. Everything is all right--so it wasn't the planet\r\nafter all--it was that dirty old Free Trader. And she's out of the way.\r\nI-S gets the Koros trade all square and legal and we're no longer around\r\nto worry about! Neat as a Salariki net-cast--and right around our\r\ncollective throats, my friends!\"\r\n\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Weeks wanted to know.\r\n\r\n\"We keep on the Old Man's course, get lost in the asteroids until we can\r\ndo some heavy thinking and see a way out. But if I-S gave us this prize\r\npackage, some trace of its origin is still aboard. And if we can find\r\nthat--why, then we have something to start from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mura went down first--and then Karl. Nothing in common,\" the old problem\r\nfaced Dane for the hundredth time.\r\n\r\n\"No. But,\" Ali arose from his place at the com-unit. \"I'd suggest a real\r\nsearch of first Frank's and then Karl's quarters. A regular turn out\r\ndown to the bare walls of their cabins. Are you with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly boy, we're ahead of you!\" Rip contributed, already at the door\r\npanel. \"Down to the bare walls it is.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nE-STAT LANDING\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Mura was in the isolation of ship sick bay the stripping of his\r\ncabin was a relatively simple job. But, though Rip and Dane went over it\r\nliterally by inches, they found nothing unusual--in fact nothing from\r\nSargol except a small twig of the red wood which lay on the steward's\r\nworktable where he had been fashioning something to incorporate in one of\r\nhis miniature fairy landscapes, to be imprisoned for all time in a\r\nplasta-bubble. Dane turned this around in his fingers. Because it was the\r\nonly link with the perfumed planet he couldn't help but feel that it had\r\nsome importance.\r\n\r\nBut Kosti had not shown any interest in the wood. And he, himself, and\r\nWeeks had handled it freely _before_ they had tasted Graft's friendship\r\ncup and had no ill effects--so it couldn't be the wood. Dane put the twig\r\nback on the work table and snapped the protecting cover over the delicate\r\ntools--never realizing until days later how very close he had been in\r\nthat moment to the solution of their problem.\r\n\r\nAfter two hours of shifting every one of the steward's belongings, of\r\ncrawling on hands and knees about the deck and climbing to inspect\r\nperfectly bare walls, they had found exactly nothing. Rip sat down on the\r\nend of the denuded bunk.\r\n\r\n\"There's the hydro--Frank spent a lot of time in there--and the\r\nstoreroom,\" he told the places off on his fingers. \"The galley and the\r\nmess cabin.\"\r\n\r\nThose had been the extent of Mura's world. They could search the\r\nstoreroom, the galley and the mess cabin--but to interfere with the hydro\r\nwould endanger their air supply. It was for that very reason that they\r\nnow looked at each other in startled surmise.\r\n\r\n\"The perfect place to plant something!\" Dane spoke first.\r\n\r\nRip's teeth caught his underlip. The hydro--something planted there could\r\nnot be routed out unless they made a landing on a port field and had the\r\nwhole section stripped.\r\n\r\n\"Devilish--\" Rip's mobile lips drew tight. \"But how could they do it?\"\r\n\r\nDane didn't see how it could have been done either. No one but the\r\nQueen's own crew had been on board the ship during their entire stay on\r\nSargol, except for the young Salarik. Could that cub have brought\r\nsomething? But he and Mura had been with the youngster every minute that\r\nhe had been in the hydro. To the best of Dane's memory the cub had\r\ntouched nothing and had been there only for a few moments. That had been\r\nbefore the feast also--\r\n\r\nRip got to his feet. \"We can't strip the hydro in space,\" he pointed out\r\nthe obvious quietly.\r\n\r\nDane had the answer. \"Then we've got to earth!\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard that warn-off. If we try it--\"\r\n\r\n\"What about an Emergency station?\"\r\n\r\nRip stood very still, his big hands locked about the buckle of his arms\r\nbelt. Then, without another word, he went out of the cabin and at a\r\npounding pace up the ladder, bound for the Captain's cabin and the\r\nrecords Jellico kept there. It was such a slim chance--but it was better\r\nthan none at all.\r\n\r\nDane shouldered into the small space in his wake to find Rip making a\r\nselection from the astrogation tapes. There were E-Stats among the\r\nasteroids--points prospectors or small traders in sudden difficulties\r\nmight contact for supplies or repairs. The big Companies maintained their\r\nown--the Patrol had several for independents.\r\n\r\n\"No Patrol one--\"\r\n\r\nRip managed a smile. \"I haven't gone space whirly yet,\" was his comment.\r\nHe was feeding a tape into the reader on the Captain's desk. In the cage\r\nover his head the blue Hoobat squatted watching him intently--for the\r\nfirst time since Dane could remember showing no sign of resentment by\r\nweird screams or wild spitting.\r\n\r\n\"Patrol E-Stat A-54--\" the reader squeaked. Rip hit a key and the wire\r\nclicked to the next entry. \"Combine E-Stat--\" Another punch and click.\r\n\"Patrol E-Stat A-55--\" punch-click. \"Inter-Solar--\" this time Rip's hand\r\ndid not hit the key and the squeak continued--\"Co-ordinates--\" Rip\r\nreached for a steelo and jotted down the list of figures.\r\n\r\n\"Got to compare this with our present course--\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's an I-S Stat,\" began Dane and then he laughed as the justice\r\nof such a move struck him. They did not dare set the Queen down at any\r\nPatrol Station. But a Company one which would be manned by only two or\r\nthree men and not expecting any but their own people--and I-S owed them\r\nhelp now!\r\n\r\n\"There may be trouble,\" he said, not that he would have any regrets if\r\nthere was. If the Eysies were responsible for the present plight of the\r\nQueen he would welcome trouble, the kind which would plant his fists on\r\nsome sneering Eysie face.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that when we come to it,\" Rip went on to the control\r\ncabin with his figures. Carefully he punched the combination on the\r\nplotter and watched it be compared with the course Jellico had set before\r\nhis collapse.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough,\" he commented as the result flashed on. \"We can make it\r\nwithout using too much fuel--\"\r\n\r\n\"Make what?\" That was Ali up from the search of Kosti's quarters.\r\n\"Nothing,\" he gave his report of what he had found there and then\r\nreturned to the earlier question. \"Make what?\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly Dane outlined their suspicions--that the seat of the trouble lay\r\nin the hydro and that they should clean out that section, drawing upon\r\nemergency materials at the I-S E-Stat.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds all right. But you know what they do to pirates?\" inquired the\r\nEngineer-apprentice.\r\n\r\nSpace law came into Dane's field, he needed no prompting. \"Any ship in\r\nemergency,\" he recited automatically, \"may claim supplies from the\r\nnearest E-Stat--paying for them when the voyage is completed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That means any Patrol E-Stat. The Companies' are private property.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Dane pointed out triumphantly, \"the law doesn't say so--there is\r\nnothing about any difference between Company and Patrol E-Stat in the\r\nlaw--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's right,\" Rip agreed. \"That law was framed when only the Patrol had\r\nsuch stations. Companies put them in later to save tax--remember? Legally\r\nwe're all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless the agents on duty raise a howl,\" Ali amended. \"Oh, don't give me\r\nthat look, Rip. I'm not sounding any warn-off on this, but I just want\r\nyou to be prepared to find a cruiser riding our fins and giving us the\r\nhot flash as bandits. If you want to spoil the Eysies, I'm all for it.\r\nGot a stat of theirs pinpointed?\"\r\n\r\nRip pointed to the figures on the computer. \"There she is. We can set\r\ndown in about five hours' ship time. How long will it take to strip the\r\nhydro and re-install?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I tell?\" Ali sounded irritable. \"I can give you oxgy for\r\nquarters for about two hours. Depends upon how fast we can move. No\r\ntelling until we make a start.\"\r\n\r\nHe started for the corridor and then added over his shoulder: \"You'll\r\nhave to answer a com challenge--thought about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Rip asked. \"It might be com repairs bringing us in. They won't be\r\nexpecting trouble and we will--we'll have the advantage.\"\r\n\r\nBut Ali was not to be shaken out of his usual dim view of the future.\r\n\"All right--so we land, blaster in hand, and take the place. And they get\r\noff one little squeak to the Patrol. Well, a short life but an\r\ninteresting one. And we'll make all the Video channels for sure when we\r\ngo out with rockets blasting. Nothing like having a little excitement to\r\nbreak the dull routine of a voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"We aren't going to, are we--\" Dane protested, \"land armed, I mean?\"\r\n\r\nAli stared at him and Rip, to Dane's surprise, did not immediately\r\nrepudiate that thought.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep rods certainly,\" the Astrogator-apprentice said after a pause.\r\n\"We'll have to be prepared for the moment when they find out who we are.\r\nAnd you can't re-set a hydro in a few minutes, not when we have to keep\r\noxgy on for the others. If we were able to turn that off and work in\r\nsuits it'd be a quicker job--we could dump before we set down and then\r\npile it in at once. But this way it's going to be piece work. And it all\r\ndepends on the agents at the Stat whether we have trouble or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better break out the suits now,\" Ali added to Rip's estimate of\r\nthe situation. \"If we set down and pile out wearing suits at once it will\r\nbuild up our tale of being poor wrecked spacemen--\"\r\n\r\nSleep rods or not, Dane thought to himself, the whole plan was one born\r\nof desperation. It would depend upon who manned the E-Stat and how fast\r\nthe Free Traders could move once the Queen touched her fins to earth.\r\n\r\n\"Knock out their coms,\" that was Ali continuing to plan. \"Do that first\r\nand then we don't have to worry about someone calling in the Patrol.\"\r\n\r\nRip stretched. For the first time in hours he seemed to have returned to\r\nhis usual placid self. \"Good thing somebody in this spacer watches Video\r\nserials--Ali, you can brief us on all the latest tricks of space pirates.\r\nNothing is so wildly improbable that you can't make use of it sometime\r\nduring a checkered career.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced over the board before he brought his hand down on a single key\r\nset a distance apart from the other controls. \"Put some local color into\r\nit,\" was his comment.\r\n\r\nDane understood. Rip had turned on the distress signal at the Queen's\r\nnose. When she set down on the Stat field she would be flaming a banner\r\nof trouble. Next to the wan dead lights, set only when a ship had no hope\r\nof ever reaching port at all, that signal was one every spacer dreaded\r\nhaving to flash. But it was _not_ the dead lights--not yet for the Queen.\r\n\r\nWorking together they brought out the space suits and readied them at the\r\nhatch. Then Weeks and Dane took up the task of tending their unconscious\r\ncharges while Rip and Ali prepared for landing.\r\n\r\nThere was no change in the sleepers. And in Jellico's cabin even Queex\r\nappeared to be influenced by the plight of its master, for instead of\r\ngreeting Dane with its normal aspect of rage, the Hoobat stayed quiescent\r\non the floor of its cage, its top claws hooked about two of the wires,\r\nits protruding eyes staring out into the room with what seemed closed to\r\na malignant intelligence. It did not even spit as Dane passed under its\r\nabode to pour thin soup into his patient.\r\n\r\nAs for Sinbad, the cat had retreated to Dane's cabin and steadily refused\r\nto leave the quarters he had chosen, resisting with tooth and claw the\r\none time Dane had tried to take him back to Van Rycke's office and his\r\nown hammock there. Afterwards the Cargo-apprentice did not try to evict\r\nhim--there was comfort in seeing that plump gray body curled on the bunk\r\nhe had little chance to use.\r\n\r\nHis nursing duties performed for the moment, Dane ventured into the\r\nhydro. He was practiced in tending this vital heart of the ship's air\r\nsupply. But outfitting a hydro was something else again. In his cadet\r\nyears he had aided in such a program at least twice as a matter of\r\nlearning the basic training of the Service. But then they had had\r\nunlimited supplies to draw on and the action had taken place under no\r\nmore pressure than that exerted by the instructors. Now it was going to\r\nbe a far more tricky job--\r\n\r\nHe went slowly down the aisle between the banks of green things. Plants\r\nfrom all over the Galaxy, grown for their contribution to the air\r\nrenewal--as well as side products such as fresh fruit and vegetables,\r\nwere banked there. The sweet odor of their verdant life was strong. But\r\nhow could any of the four now on duty tell what was rightfully there and\r\nwhat might have been brought in? And could they be sure anything _had_\r\nbeen introduced?\r\n\r\nDane stood there, his eyes searching those lines of greens--such a\r\nmixture of greens from the familiar shade of Terra's fields to greens\r\ntinged with shades first bestowed by other suns on other worlds--looking\r\nfor one which was alien enough to be noticeable. Only Mura, who knew\r\nthis garden as he knew his own cabin, could have differentiated between\r\nthem. They would just dump everything and trust to luck--\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly aware of a slight movement in the banks--a shivering of\r\nstem, quiver of leaf. The mere act of his passing had set some sensitive\r\nplant to register his presence. A lacy, fern-like thing was contracting\r\nits fronds into balls. He should not stay--disturbing the peace of the\r\nhydro. But it made little difference now--within a matter of hours all\r\nthis luxuriance would be thrust out to die and they would have to depend\r\nupon canned oxgy and algae tanks. Too bad--the hydro represented much\r\ntime and labor on Mura's part and Tau had medical plants growing there he\r\nhad been observing for a long time.\r\n\r\nAs Dane closed the door behind him, seeing the line of balled fern which\r\nhad marked his passage, he heard a faint rustling, a sound as if a wind\r\nhad swept across the green room within. The imagination which was a\r\nTrader's asset (when it was kept within bounds) suggested that the plants\r\ninside guessed--With a frown for his own sentimentality, Dane strode down\r\nthe corridor and climbed to check with Rip in control.\r\n\r\nThe Astrogator-apprentice had his own problems. To bring the Queen down\r\non the circumscribed field of an E-Stat--without a guide beam to ride\r\nin--since if they contacted the Stat they must reveal their _own_ com was\r\nworking and they would have to answer questions--was the sort of test\r\neven a seasoned pilot would tense over. Yet Rip was sitting now in the\r\nCaptain's place, his broad hands spread out on the edge of the control\r\nboard waiting. And below in the engine room Ali was in Stotz's place\r\nready to fire and cut rockets at order. Of course they were both several\r\nyears ahead of him in Service, Dane knew. But he wondered at their quick\r\nassumption of responsibility and whether he himself could ever reach\r\nthat point of self-confidence--his memory turning to the bad mistake he\r\nhad made on Sargol.\r\n\r\nThere was the sharp note of a warning gong, the flash of red light on the\r\ncontrol board. They were off automatic, from here on in it was all Kip's\r\nwork. Dane strapped down at the silent com-unit and was startled a moment\r\nlater when it spat words at him, translated from space code.\r\n\r\n\"Identify--identify--I-S E-Stat calling spacer--identify--\"\r\n\r\nSo compelling was that demand that Dane's fingers went to the answer key\r\nbefore he remembered and snatched them back, to fold his hands in his\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n\"Identify--\" the expressionless voice of the translator droned over their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nRip's hands were on the control board, playing the buttons there with the\r\nprecision of a musician creating some symphonic masterpiece. And the\r\nQueen was alive, now quivering through her stout plates, coming into a\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nDane watched the visa plate. The E-Stat asteroid was of a reasonable\r\nsize, but in their eyes it was a bleak, torn mote of stuff swimming\r\nthrough vast emptiness.\r\n\r\n\"Identify--\" the drone heightened in pitch.\r\n\r\nRip's lips were compressed, he made quick calculations. And Dane saw\r\nthat, though Jellico was the master, Rip was fully fit to follow in the\r\nCaptain's boot prints.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden silence in the cabin--the demand had stopped. The\r\nagents below must now have realized that the ship with the distress\r\nsignals blazing on her nose was not going to reply. Dane found he could\r\nnot watch the visa plate now, Rip's hands about their task filled his\r\nwhole range of sight.\r\n\r\nHe knew that Shannon was using every bit of his skill and knowledge to\r\njockey them into the position where they could ride their tail rockets\r\ndown to the scorched rock of the E-Stat field. Perhaps it wasn't as\r\nsmooth a landing as Jellico could have made. But they did it. Rip's hands\r\nwere quiet, again that patch of darkness showed on the back of his tunic.\r\nHe made no move from his seat.\r\n\r\n\"Secure--\" Ali's voice floated up to them.\r\n\r\nDane unbuckled his safety webbing and got up, looking to Shannon for\r\norders. This was Rip's plan they were to carry through. Then something\r\nmoved him to give honor where it was due. He touched that bowed shoulder\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"Fin landing, brother! Four points and down!\"\r\n\r\nRip glanced up, a grin made him look his old self. \"Ought to have a\r\nrecording of that for the Board when I go up for my pass-through.\"\r\n\r\nDane matched his smile. \"Too bad we didn't have someone out there with a\r\ntri-dee machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely it'd be evidence at our trial for piracy--\" their words must\r\nhave reached Ali on the ship's inter-com, for his deflating reply came\r\nback, to remind them of why they had made that particular landing. \"Do we\r\nmove now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Check first,\" Rip said into the mike.\r\n\r\nDane looked at the visa-plate. Against a background of jagged rock teeth\r\nwas the bubble of the E-Stat housing--more than three-quarters of it\r\nbeing in the hollowed out sections below the surface of the miniature\r\nworld which supported it, as Dane knew. But a beam of light shown from\r\nthe dome to center on the grounded Queen. They had not caught the Stat\r\nagents napping.\r\n\r\nThey made the rounds of the spacer, checking on each of the\r\nsemi-conscious men. Ali had ready the artificial oxgy tanks--they must\r\nmove fast once they began the actual task of clearing and restocking the\r\nhydro.\r\n\r\n\"Hope you have a good story ready,\" he commented as the other three\r\njoined him by the hatch to don the suits which would enable them to cross\r\nthe airless, heatless surface of the asteroid.\r\n\r\n\"We have a poisoned hydro,\" Dane said.\r\n\r\n\"One look at the plants we dump will give you the lie. They won't accept\r\nour story without investigation.\"\r\n\r\nDane was aroused. Did Ali think he was a stupid as all that? \"If you'd\r\ntake a look in there now you'd believe me,\" he snapped.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\" Ali sounded genuinely interested.\r\n\r\n\"Chucked a heated can of lacoil over a good section. It's wilting down\r\nfast in big patches.\"\r\n\r\nRip snorted. \"Good old lacoil. You drink it, you wash in it, and now you\r\nkill off the Hydro with it. Maybe we can give the company an extra\r\ntestimonial for the official jabber and collect when we hit Terra. All\r\nright--Weeks,\" he spoke to the little man, \"you listen in on the\r\ncom--it's tuned to our helmet units. We'll climb into these pipe suits\r\nand see how many tears we can wring out of the Eysies with our sad, sad\r\ntale.\"\r\n\r\nThey got into the awkward, bulky suits and squeezed into the hatch while\r\nWeeks slammed the lock door at their backs and operated the outer\r\nopening. Then they were looking out across the ground, still showing\r\nsigns of the heat of their landing, and lighted by the dome beam.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody hurrying out with an aid and comfort kit,\" Rip's voice sounded in\r\nDane's earphones. \"A little slack aren't they?\"\r\n\r\nSlack--or was it that the Eysies had recognized the Queen and was\r\npreparing the sort of welcome the remnant of her crew could not\r\nwithstand? Dane, wanting very much in his heart to be elsewhere, climbed\r\ndown the ladder in Rip's wake, both of them spotlighted by the immovable\r\nbeam from the Stat dome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nDESPERATE MEASURES\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasured in distance and time that rough walk in the ponderous suits\r\nacross the broken terrain of the asteroid was a short one, measured by\r\nthe beating of his own heart, Dane thought it much too long. There was no\r\nsign of life by the air lock of the bubble--no move on the part of the\r\nmen stationed there to come to their assistance.\r\n\r\n\"D'you suppose we're invisible?\" Ali's disembodied voice clicked in the\r\nhelmet earphones.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we'll wish we were,\" Dane could not forego that return.\r\n\r\nRip was almost to the air lock door now. His massively suited arm was\r\noutstretched toward the control bar when the com-unit in all three\r\nhelmets caught the same demand:\r\n\r\n\"Identify!\" The crisp order had enough snap to warn them that an answer\r\nwas the best policy.\r\n\r\n\"Shannon--A-A of the Polestar,\" Rip gave the required information. \"We\r\nclaim E rights--\"\r\n\r\nBut would they get them? Dane wondered. There was a click loud in his\r\nears. The metal door was yielding to Rip's hand. At least those on the\r\ninside had taken off the lock. Dane quickened pace to join his leader.\r\n\r\nTogether the three from the Queen crowded through the lock door, saw that\r\nswing shut and seal behind them, as they stood waiting for the moment\r\nthey could discard the suits and enter the dome. The odds against them\r\ncould not be too high, this was a small Stat. It would not house more\r\nthan four agents at the most. And they were familiar enough with the\r\nbasic architecture of such stations to know just what move to make. Ali\r\nwas to go to the com room where he could take over if they did meet with\r\ntrouble. Dane and Rip would have to handle any dissenters in the main\r\nsection. But they still hoped that luck might ride their fins and they\r\ncould put over a story which would keep them out of active conflict with\r\nthe Eysies.\r\n\r\nThe gauge on the wall registered safety and they unfastened the\r\nprotective clasps of the suits. Standing the cumbersome things against\r\nthe wall as the inner door to the lock rolled back, they walked into\r\nEysie territory.\r\n\r\nAs Free Traders they had the advantage of being uniformly tunicked--with\r\nno Company badge to betray their ship or status. So that could well _be_\r\nthe \"Polestar\" standing needle slim behind them--and not the notorious\r\n\"Solar Queen.\" But each, as he passed through the inner lock, gave a\r\nhitch to his belt which brought the butt of his sleep rod closer to hand.\r\nInnocuous as that weapon was, in close quarters its effects, if only\r\ntemporary, was to some purpose. And since they were prepared for trouble,\r\nthey might have a slight edge over the Eysies in attack.\r\n\r\nA Company man, his tunic shabby and open in a negligent fashion at his\r\nthick throat, stood waiting for them. His unhelmeted head was grizzled,\r\nhis coarse, tanned face with heavy jowls bristly enough to suggest he had\r\nnot bothered to use smooth-cream for some days. An under officer of some\r\nspacer, retired to finish out the few years before pension in this\r\nnominal duty--fast letting down the standards of personal regime he had\r\nhad to maintain on ship board. But he wasn't all fat and soft living,\r\nthe glance with which he measured them was shrewdly appraising.\r\n\r\n\"What's your trouble?\" he demanded without greeting. \"You didn't I-dent\r\ncoming in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coms are out,\" Rip replied as shortly. \"We need E-Hydro--\"\r\n\r\n\"First time I ever heard it that the coms were wired in with the grass,\"\r\nthe Eysies's hands were on his hips--in close proximity to something\r\nwhich made Dane's eyes narrow. The fellow was wearing a flare-blaster!\r\nThat might be regulation equipment for an E-Stat agent on a lonely\r\nasteroid--but he didn't quite believe it. And probably the other was\r\nquick on the draw too.\r\n\r\n\"The coms are something else,\" Rip answered readily. \"Our tech is working\r\non them. But the hydro's bad all though. We'll have to dump and restock.\r\nGive you a voucher on Terra for the stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eysie agent continued to block the doorway into the station. \"This is\r\nprivate--I-S property. You should hit the Patrol post--they cater to you\r\nF-Ts.\"\r\n\r\n\"We hit the nearest E-Stat when we discovered that we were contaminated,\"\r\nRip spoke with an assumption of patience. \"That's the law, and you know\r\nit. You have to supply us and take a voucher--\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know that your voucher is worth the film it's recorded on?\"\r\nasked the agent reasonably.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Rip shrugged. \"If we have to do it the hard way, we'll cargo\r\ndump to cover your bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on this field.\" The other shook his head. \"I'll flash in your\r\nvoucher first.\"\r\n\r\nHe had them, Dane thought bitterly. Their luck had run out. Because what\r\nhe was going to do was a move they dared not protest. It was one any\r\ncanny agent would make in the present situation. And if they were what\r\nthey said they were, they must readily agree to let him flash their\r\nvoucher of payment to I-S headquarters, to be checked and okayed before\r\nthey took the hydro stock.\r\n\r\nBut Rip merely registered a mild resignation. \"You the Com-tech? Where's\r\nyour unit? I'll indit at once if you want it that way.\"\r\n\r\nWhether their readiness to co-operate allayed some of the agent's\r\nsuspicion or not, he relaxed some, giving them one more stare all around\r\nbefore he turned on his heel. \"This way.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed him down the narrow hall, Rip on his heels, the others\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\"Lonely post,\" Rip commented. \"I'd think you boys'd get space-whirly out\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nThe other snorted. \"We're not star lovers. And the pay's worth a three\r\nmonth stretch. They take us down for Terra leave before we start talking\r\nto the Whisperers.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many of you here at a time?\" Rip edged the question in casually.\r\n\r\nBut the other might have been expecting it by the way he avoided giving a\r\ndirect answer. \"Enough to run the place--and not enough to help you clean\r\nout your wagon,\" he was short about it. \"Any dumping you do is strictly\r\non your own. You've enough hands on a spacer that size to manage--\"\r\n\r\nRip laughed. \"Far be it from me to ask an Eysie to do any real work,\" was\r\nhis counter. \"We know all about you Company men--\"\r\n\r\nBut the agent did not take fire at that jib. Instead he pushed back a\r\npanel and they were looking into com-unit room where another man in the\r\ntunic of the I-S lounged on what was by law twenty-four hour duty,\r\ndivided into three watches.\r\n\r\n\"These F-Ts want to flash a voucher request through,\" their guide\r\ninformed the tech. The other, interested, gave them a searching\r\nonce-over before he pushed a small scriber toward Rip.\r\n\r\n\"It's all yours--clear ether,\" he reported.\r\n\r\nAli stood with his back to the wall and Dane still lingered in the\r\nportal. Both of them fixed their attention on Rip's left hand. If he gave\r\nthe agreed upon signal! Their fingers were linked loosely in their belts\r\nonly an inch or so from their sleep rods.\r\n\r\nWith his right hand Rip scooped up the scribbler while the Com-tech half\r\nturned to make adjustments to the controls, picking up a speaker to call\r\nthe I-S headquarters.\r\n\r\nRip's left index finger snapped across his thumb to form a circle. Ali's\r\nrod did not even leave his belt, it tilted up and the invisible deadening\r\nstream from it centered upon the seated tech. At the same instant Dane\r\nshot at the agent who had guided them there. The latter had time for a\r\nsurprised grunt and his hand was at his blaster as he sagged to his knees\r\nand then relaxed on the floor. The Tech slumped across the call board as\r\nif sleep had overtaken him at his post.\r\n\r\nRip crossed the room and snapped off the switch which opened the wire for\r\nbroadcasting. While Ali, with Dane's help, quietly and effectively\r\nimmobilized the Eysies with their own belts.\r\n\r\n\"There should be at least three men here,\" Rip waited by the door. \"We\r\nhave to get them all under control before we start work.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the interior of the bubble, extending as it did on levels\r\nbeneath the outer crust of the asteroid, was not an easy place to search.\r\nAn enemy, warned of the invasion, could easily keep ahead of the party\r\nfrom the Queen, spying on them at his leisure or preparing traps for\r\nthem. In the end, afraid of wasting time, they contented themselves with\r\nlocking the doors of the corridor leading to the lower levels, making\r\nready to raid the storeroom they had discovered during their search.\r\n\r\nEmergency hydro supplies consisted mainly of algae which could be stored\r\nin tanks and hastily put to use--as the plants now in the Queen took much\r\nlonger to grow even under forcing methods. Dane volunteered to remain\r\ninside the E-Stat and assemble the necessary containers at the air lock\r\nwhile the other two, having had more experience, went back to the spacer\r\nto strip the hydro and prepare to switch contents.\r\n\r\nBut, when Rip and Ali left, the younger Cargo-apprentice began to find\r\nthe bubble a haunted place. He took the sealed containers out of their\r\nstorage racks, stood them on a small hand truck, and pushed them to the\r\nfoot of the stairs, up which he then climbed carrying two of the\r\ncylinders at a time.\r\n\r\nThe swish of the air current through the narrow corridors made a constant\r\nmurmur of sound, but he found himself listening for something else, for a\r\nfootfall other than his own, for the betraying rasp of clothing against a\r\nwall--for even a whisper of voice. And time and time again he paused\r\nsuddenly to listen--sure that the faintest hint of such a sound had\r\nreached his ears. He had a dozen containers lined up when the welcome\r\nsignal reached him by the com-unit of his field helmet. To transfer the\r\ncylinders to the lock, get out, and then open the outer door, did not\r\ntake long. But as he waited he still listened for a sound which did not\r\ncome--the notice, that someone besides himself was free to move about the\r\nStat.\r\n\r\nNot knowing just how many of the supply tins were needed, he worked on\r\ntransferring all there were in the storage racks to the upper corridor\r\nand the lock. But he still had half a dozen left to pass through when Rip\r\nsent a message that he was coming in.\r\n\r\nOut of his pressure suit, the Astrogator-apprentice stepped lightly into\r\nthe corridor, looked at the array of containers and shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"We don't need all those. No, leave them--\" he added as Dane, with a\r\nsigh, started to pick up two for a return trip. \"There's something more\r\nimportant just now--\" He turned into the side hall which led to the com\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nBoth the I-S men had awakened. The Com-tech appeared to accept his bonds\r\nphilosophically. He was quiet and flat on his back, staring pensively at\r\nthe ceiling. But the other agent had made a worm's progress half across\r\nthe room and Rip had to halt in haste to prevent stepping on him.\r\n\r\nShannon stooped and, hooking his fingers in the other's tunic, heaved him\r\nback while the helpless man favored them with some of the ripest\r\nspeech--and NOT Trade Lingo--Dane had ever heard. Rip waited until the\r\nman began to run down and then he broke in with his pleasant soft drawl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sure, we're all that. But time runs on, Eysie, and I'd like a couple\r\nof answers which may mean something to you. First--when do you expect\r\nyour relief?\"\r\n\r\nThat set the agent off again. And his remarks--edited--were that no\r\nsomething, something F-T was going to get any something, something\r\ninformation out of him!\r\n\r\nBut it was his companion in misfortune--the Com-tech--who guessed the\r\nreason behind Rip's question.\r\n\r\n\"Cut jets!\" he advised the other. \"They're just being soft-hearted. I\r\ntake it,\" he spoke over the other agent's sputtering to Rip, \"that you're\r\nworried about leaving us fin down--That's it, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nRip nodded. \"In spite of what you think about us,\" he replied, \"We're not\r\nPatrol Posted outlaws--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you're just from a plague ship,\" the Com-tech remarked calmly. And\r\nhis words struck his comrade dumb. \"Solar Queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"You got the warn-off then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who didn't? You really have plague on board?\" The thought did not appear\r\nto alarm the Com-tech unduly. But his fellow suddenly heaved his bound\r\nbody some distance away from the Free Traders and his face displayed\r\nmixed emotions--most of them fearful.\r\n\r\n\"We have something--probably supplied,\" Rip straightened. \"Might pass\r\nalong to your bosses that we know that. Now suppose you tell me about\r\nyour relief. When is it due?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not until after we take off on the long orbit if you leave us like this.\r\nOn the other hand,\" the other added coolly, \"I don't see how you can do\r\notherwise. We've still got those--\" with his chin he pointed to the\r\ncom-unit.\r\n\r\n\"After a few alterations,\" Rip amended. The bulk of the com was in a\r\ntightly sealed case which they would need a flamer to open. But he could\r\nand did wreak havoc with the exposed portions. The tech watching this\r\ndestruction spouted at least two expressions his companion had not used.\r\nBut when Rip finished he was his unruffled self again.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Rip drew his sleep rod. \"A little rest and when you wake it will\r\nall be a bad dream.\" He carefully beamed each man into slumber and helped\r\nDane strip off their bonds. But before he left the room he placed on the\r\nrecorder the voucher for the supplies they had taken. The Queen was not\r\nstealing--under the law she still had some shadow of rights.\r\n\r\nSuited they crossed the rough rock to the ship. And there about the fins,\r\nalready frozen into brittle spikes was a tangle of plants--the rich\r\nresult of years of collecting.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find anything?\" Dane asked as they rounded that mess on their\r\nway to the ladder.\r\n\r\nRip's voice came back through the helmet com. \"Nothing we know how to\r\ninterpret. I wish Frank or Craig had had a chance to check. We took\r\ntri-dees of everything before we dumped. Maybe they can learn something\r\nfrom these when--\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off leaving that \"when\" to ring in both their minds. It\r\nwas such an important \"when.\" When _would_ either the steward or the\r\nMedic recover enough to view those tri-dee shots? Or was that \"when\"\r\nreally an ominous \"if?\"\r\n\r\nBack in the Queen, sealed once more for blast-off, they took their\r\nstations. Dane speculated as to the course Rip had set--were they just\r\ngoing to wander about the system hoping to escape notice until they had\r\nsomehow solved their problem? Or did Shannon have some definite port in\r\nmind? He did not have time to ask before they lifted. But once they were\r\nspace borne again he voiced his question.\r\n\r\nRip's face was serious. \"Frankly--\" he began and then hesitated for a\r\nlong moment before he added, \"I don't know. If we can only get the\r\nCaptain or Craig on their feet again--\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing,\" Ali materialized to join them, \"Sinbad's back in the hydro.\r\nAnd this morning you couldn't get him inside the door. It's not a very\r\ngood piece of evidence--\"\r\n\r\nNo, it wasn't but they clung to it as backing for their actions of the\r\npast few hours. The cat that had shown such a marked distaste for the\r\ncompany of the stricken, and then for the hydro, was now content to visit\r\nthe latter as if some evil he has sensed there had been cleansed with the\r\ndumping of the garden. They had not yet solved their mystery but another\r\nclue had come into their hands.\r\n\r\nBut now the care of the sick occupied hours and Rip insisted that a watch\r\nbe maintained by the com--listening in for news which might concern the\r\nQueen. They had done a good job at silencing the E-Stat, for they had\r\nbeen almost six hours in space before the news of their raid was beamed\r\nto the nearest Patrol post.\r\n\r\nAli laughed. \"Told you we'd be pirates,\" he said when he listened to that\r\naccount of their descent upon the I-S station. \"Though I didn't see all\r\nthat blaster work they're now raving about. You'd think we fought a major\r\nbattle there!\"\r\n\r\nWeeks growled. \"The Eysies are trying to make it look good. Make us into\r\noutlaws--\"\r\n\r\nBut Rip did not share in the general amusement at the wild extravagation\r\nof the report from the ether. \"I notice they didn't say anything about\r\nthe voucher we left.\"\r\n\r\nAli's cynical smile curled. \"Did you expect them to? The Eysies think\r\nthey have us by the tail fins now--why should they give us any benefit of\r\nthe doubt? We junked all our boosters behind us on this take-off, and\r\ndon't forget that, my friends.\"\r\n\r\nWeeks looked confused. \"But I thought you said we could do this legal,\"\r\nhe appealed to Rip. \"If we're Patrol Posted as outlaws--\"\r\n\r\n\"They can't do any more to us than they can for running in a plague\r\nship,\" Ali pointed out. \"Either will get us blasted if we happen into the\r\nwrong vector now. So--what do we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We find out what the plague really is,\" Dane said and meant every word\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" Ali inquired. \"Through some of Craig's magic?\"\r\n\r\nDane was forced to answer with the truth. \"I don't know yet--but it's our\r\nonly chance.\"\r\n\r\nRip rubbed his eyes wearily. \"Don't think I'm disagreeing--but just\r\nwhere do we start? We've already combed Frank's quarters and Kosti's--we\r\ncleaned out the hydro--\"\r\n\r\n\"Those tri-dee shots of the hydro--have you checked them yet?\" Dane\r\ncountered.\r\n\r\nWithout a word Ali arose and left the cabin. He came back with a\r\nmicrofilm roll. Fitting it into the large projector he focused it on the\r\nwall and snapped the button.\r\n\r\nThey were looking at the hydro--down the length of space so accurately\r\nrecorded that it seemed they might walk straight into it. The greenery of\r\nthe plants was so vivid and alive Dane felt that he could reach out and\r\npluck a leaf. Inch by inch he examined those ranks, looking for something\r\nwhich was not in order, had no right to be there.\r\n\r\nThe long shot of the hydro as it had been merged into a series of\r\nsectional groupings. In silence they studied it intently, using all their\r\nfield lore in an attempt to spot what each one was certain must be there\r\nsomewhere. But they were all handicapped by their lack of intimate\r\nknowledge of the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Weeks' voice scaled up. \"Left hand corner--there!\" His pointing\r\nhand broke and shadowed the portion he was calling to their attention.\r\nAli jumped to the projector and made a quick adjustment.\r\n\r\nPlants four and five times life size glowed green on the wall. What Weeks\r\nhad caught they all saw now--ragged leaves, stripped stems.\r\n\r\n\"Chewed!\" Dane supplied the answer.\r\n\r\nIt was only one species of plant which had been so mangled. Other\r\nvarieties in the same bank showed no signs of disturbance. But all of\r\nthat one type had at least one stripped branch and two were virtual\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\n\"A pest!\" said Rip.\r\n\r\n\"But Sinbad,\" Dane began a protest before the memory of the cat's\r\npeculiar actions of the past weeks stopped him. Sinbad had slipped up,\r\nthe hunter who had kept the Queen free of the outrÃ© alien life which came\r\naboard from time to time with cargo, had not attacked that which had\r\nravaged the hydro plants. Or if he had done so, he had not, after his\r\nusual custom, presented the bodies of the slain to any crew member.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if we have something at last,\" Ali observed and someone\r\nechoed that with a sigh of heartdeep relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nSTRANGE BEHAVIOR OF A HOOBAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All right, so we think we know a little more,\" Ali added a moment later.\r\n\"Just what are we going to do? We can't stay in space forever--there're\r\nthe small items of fuel and supplies and--\"\r\n\r\nRip had come to a decision. \"We're not going to remain space borne,\" he\r\nstated with the confidence of one who now saw an open road before him.\r\n\r\n\"Luna--\" Weeks was plainly doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"No. Not after that warn-off. Terra!\"\r\n\r\nFor a second or two the other three stared at Rip agape. The audacity and\r\ndanger of what he suggested was a little stunning. Since men had taken\r\nregularly to space no ship had made a direct landing on their home\r\nplanet--all had passed through the quarantine on Luna. It was not only\r\nrisky--it was so unheard of that for some minutes they did not understand\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"We try to set down at Terraport,\" Dane found his tongue first, \"and they\r\nflame us out--\"\r\n\r\nRip was smiling. \"The trouble with you,\" he addressed them all, \"is that\r\nyou think of earth only in terms of Terraport--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there _is_ the Patrol field at Stella,\" Weeks agreed doubtfully.\r\n\"But we'd be right in the middle of trouble there--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did we have a regular port on Sargol--on Limbo--on fifty others I can\r\nname out of our log?\" Rip wanted to know.\r\n\r\nAli voiced a new objection. \"So--we have the luck of Jones and we set\r\ndown somewhere out of sight. Then what do we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We seal ship until we find the pest--then we bring in a Medic and get to\r\nthe bottom of the whole thing,\" Rip's confidence was contagious. Dane\r\nalmost believed that it _could_ be done that way.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever think,\" Ali cut in, \"what would happen if we were wrong--if\r\nthe Queen really is a plague carrier?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said--we seal the ship--tight,\" countered Shannon. \"And when we earth\r\nit'll be where we won't have visitors to infect--\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is where?\" Ali, who knew the deserts of Mars better than he did\r\nthe greener planet from which his stock had sprung, pursued the question.\r\n\r\n\"Right in the middle of the Big Burn!\"\r\n\r\nDane, Terra born and bred, realized first what Rip was planning and what\r\nit meant. Sealed off was right--the Queen would be amply protected from\r\ninvestigation. Whether her crew would survive was another matter--whether\r\nshe could even make a landing there was also to be considered.\r\n\r\nThe Big Burn was the horrible scar left by the last of the Atomic Wars--a\r\nsection of radiation poisoned land comprising hundreds of square\r\nmiles--land which generations had never dared to penetrate. Originally\r\nthe survivors of that war had shunned the whole continent which it\r\ndisfigured. It had been close to two centuries before men had gone into\r\nthe still wholesome land laying to the far west and the south. And\r\nthrough the years, the avoidance of the Big Burn had become part of their\r\nracial instinct as they shrank from it. It was a symbol of something no\r\nTerran wanted to remember.\r\n\r\nBut Ali now had only one question to ask. \"Can we do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll never know until we try,\" was Rip's reply.\r\n\r\n\"The Patrol'll be watching--\" that was Weeks. With his Venusian\r\nbackground he had less respect for the dangers of the Big Burn than he\r\ndid for the forces of Law and order which ranged the star lanes.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be watching the route lanes,\" Rip pointed out. \"They won't\r\nexpect a ship to come in on that vector, steering away from the ports.\r\nWhy should they? As far as I know it's never been tried since Terraport\r\nwas laid out. It'll be tricky--\" And he himself would have to bear most\r\nof the responsibility for it. \"But I believe that it can be done. And we\r\ncan't just roam around out here. With I-S out for our blood and a Patrol\r\nwarn-off it won't do us any good to head for Luna--\"\r\n\r\nNone of his listeners could argue with that. And, Dane's spirits began to\r\nrise, after all they knew so little about the Big Burn--it might afford\r\nthem just the temporary sanctuary they needed. In the end they agreed to\r\ntry it, mainly because none of them could see any alternative, except the\r\ntoo dangerous one of trying to contact the authorities and being\r\nsummarily treated as a plague ship before they could defend themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd their decision was ably endorsed not long afterwards by a sardonic\r\nwarning on the com--a warning which Ali who had been tending the machine\r\npassed along to them.\r\n\r\n\"Greetings, pirates--\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Dane was heating broth to feed to Captain Jellico.\r\n\r\n\"The word has gone out--our raid on the E-Stat is now a matter of history\r\nand Patrol record--we've been Posted!\"\r\n\r\nDane felt a cold finger drawn along his backbone. Now they were fair game\r\nfor the whole system. Any Patrol ship that wanted could shoot them down\r\nwith no questions asked. Of course that had always been a possibility\r\nfrom the first after their raid on the E-Stat. But to realize that it was\r\nnow true was a different matter altogether. This was one occasion when\r\nrealization was worse than anticipation. He tried to keep his voice level\r\nas he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope we can pull off Rip's plan--\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better. What about the Big Burn anyway, Thorson? Is it as tough as\r\nthe stories say?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know what it's like. It's never been explored--or at least\r\nthose who tried to explore its interior never reported in afterwards. As\r\nfar as I know it's left strictly alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it still all 'hot'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Parts of it must be. But all--we don't know.\"\r\n\r\nWith the bottle of soup in his hand Dane climbed to Jellico's cabin. And\r\nhe was so occupied with the problem at hand that at first he did not see\r\nwhat was happening in the small room. He had braced the Captain up into a\r\nhalf-sitting position and was patiently ladling the liquid into his\r\nmouth a spoonful at a time when a thin squeak drew his attention to the\r\ntop of Jellico's desk.\r\n\r\nFrom the half open lid of a microtape compartment something long and dark\r\nprojected, beating the air feebly. Dane, easing the Captain back on the\r\nbunk, was going to investigate when the Hoobat broke its unnatural quiet\r\nof the past few days with an ear-splitting screech of fury. Dane struck\r\nat the bottom of its cage--the move its master always used to silence\r\nit--But this time the results were spectacular.\r\n\r\nThe cage bounced up and down on the spring which secured it to the\r\nceiling of the cabin and the blue feathered horror slammed against the\r\nwires. Either its clawing had weakened them, or some fault had developed,\r\nfor they parted and the Hoobat came through them to land with a sullen\r\nplop on the desk. Its screams stopped as suddenly as they had begun and\r\nit scuttled on its spider-toad legs to the microtape compartment, acting\r\nwith purposeful dispatch and paying no attention to Dane.\r\n\r\nIts claws shot out and with ease it extracted from the compartment a\r\ncreature as weird as itself--one which came fighting and of which Dane\r\ncould not get a very clear idea. Struggling they battled across the\r\nsurface of the desk and flopped to the floor. There the hunted broke\r\nloose from the hunter and fled with fantastic speed into the corridor.\r\nAnd before Dane could move the Hoobat was after it.\r\n\r\nHe gained the passage just in time to see Queex disappear down the\r\nladder, clinging with the aid of its pincher claws, apparently grimly\r\ndetermined to catch up with the thing it pursued. And Dane went after\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of the creature who fled on the next level. But Dane\r\nmade no move to recapture the blue hunter who squatted at the foot of the\r\nladder staring unblinkingly into space. Dane waited, afraid to disturb\r\nthe Hoobat. He had not had a good look at the thing which had run from\r\nQueex--but he knew it was something which had no business aboard the\r\nQueen. And it might be the disturbing factor they were searching for. If\r\nthe Hoobat would only lead him to it--\r\n\r\nThe Hoobat moved, rearing up on the tips of its six legs, its neckless\r\nhead slowly revolving on its puffy shoulders. Along the ridge of its\r\nbackbone its blue feathers were rising into a crest much as Sinbad's fur\r\nrose when the cat was afraid or angry. Then, without any sign of haste,\r\nit crawled over and began descending the ladder once more, heading toward\r\nthe lower section which housed the Hydro.\r\n\r\nDane remained where he was until it had almost reached the deck of the\r\nnext level and then he followed, one step at a time. He was sure that the\r\nHoobat's peculiar construction of body prevented it from looking\r\nup--unless it turned upon its back--but he did not want to do anything\r\nwhich would alarm it or deter Queex from what he was sure was a\r\nmethodical chase.\r\n\r\nQueex stopped again at the foot of the second descent and sat in its toad\r\nstance, apparently brooding, a round blue blot. Dane clung to the ladder\r\nand prayed that no one would happen along to frighten it. Then, just as\r\nhe was beginning to wonder if it had lost contact with its prey, once\r\nmore it arose and with the same speed it had displayed in the Captain's\r\ncabin it shot along the corridor to the hydro.\r\n\r\nTo Dane's knowledge the door of the garden was not only shut but sealed.\r\nAnd how either the stranger or Queex could get through it he did not see.\r\n\r\n\"What the--?\" Ali clattered down the ladder to halt abruptly as Dane waved\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n\"Queex,\" the Cargo-apprentice kept his voice to a half whisper, \"it got\r\nloose and chased something out of the Old Man's cabin down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Queex--!\" Ali began and then shut his mouth, moving noiselessly up to\r\njoin Dane.\r\n\r\nThe short corridor ended at the hydro entrance. And Dane had been right,\r\nthere they found the Hoobat, crouched at the closed panel, its claws\r\nclicking against the metal as it picked away useless at the portal which\r\nwould not admit it.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it's after must be in there,\" Dane said softly.\r\n\r\nAnd the hydro, stripped of its luxuriance of plant life, occupied now by\r\nthe tanks of green scum, would not afford too many hiding places. They\r\nhad only to let Queex in and keep watch.\r\n\r\nAs they came up the Hoobat flattened to the floor and shrilled its war\r\ncry, spitting at their boots and then flashing claws against the stout\r\nmetal enforced hide. However, though it was prepared to fight them, it\r\nshowed no signs of wishing to retreat, and for that Dane was thankful. He\r\nquickly pressed the release and tugged open the panel.\r\n\r\nAt the first crack of its opening Queex turned with one of those bursts\r\nof astounding speed and clawed for admittance, its protest against the\r\nmen forgotten. And it squeezed through a space Dane would have thought\r\ntoo narrow to accommodate its bloated body. Both men slipped around the\r\ndoor behind it and closed the panel tight.\r\n\r\nThe air was not as fresh as it had been when the plants were there. And\r\nthe vats which had taken the places of the banked greenery were certainly\r\nnothing to look at. Queex humped itself into a clod of blue, immovable,\r\nhalfway down the aisle.\r\n\r\nDane tried to subdue his breathing, to listen. The Hoobat's actions\r\ncertainly argued that the alien thing had taken refuge here, though how\r\nit had gotten through--? But if it were in the hydro it was well hidden.\r\n\r\nHe had just begun to wonder how long they must wait when Queex again went\r\ninto action. Its clawed front legs upraised, it brought the pinchers\r\ndeliberately together and sawed one across the other, producing a rasping\r\nsound which was almost a vibration in the air. Back and forth, back and\r\nforth, moved the claws. Watching them produced almost a hypnotic effect,\r\nand the reason for such a maneuver was totally beyond the human watchers.\r\n\r\nBut Queex knew what it was doing all right, Ali's fingers closed on\r\nDane's arm in a pincher grip as painful as if he had been equipped with\r\nthe horny armament of the Hoobat.\r\n\r\nSomething, a flitting shadow, had rounded one vat and was that much\r\ncloser to the industrious fiddler on the floor. By some weird magic of\r\nits own the Hoobat was calling its prey to it.\r\n\r\nScrape, scrape--the unmusical performance continued with monotonous\r\nregularity. Again the shadow flashed--one vat closer. The Hoobat now\r\npresented the appearance of one charmed by its own art--sunk in a\r\nlethargy of weird music making.\r\n\r\nAt last the enchanted came into full view, though lingering at the round\r\nside of a container, very apparently longing to flee again, but under\r\nsome compulsion to approach its enchanter. Dane blinked, not quite sure\r\nthat his eyes were not playing tricks on him. He had seen the almost\r\ntransparent globe \"bogies\" of Limbo, had been fascinated by the weird and\r\nugly pictures in Captain Jellico's collection of tri-dee prints. But this\r\ncreature was as impossible in its way as the horrific blue thing dragging\r\nit out of concealment.\r\n\r\nIt walked erect on two threads of legs, with four knobby joints easily\r\ndetected. A bulging abdomen sheathed in the horny substance of a beetle's\r\nshell ended in a sharp point. Two pairs of small legs, folded close to\r\nthe much smaller upper portion of its body, were equipped with thorn\r\nshack terminations. The head, which constantly turned back and forth on\r\nthe armor plated shoulders, was long and narrow and split for half its\r\nlength by a mouth above which were deep pits which must harbor eyes,\r\nthough actual organs were not visible to the watching men. It was a\r\npalish gray in color--which surprised Dane a little. His memory of the\r\nfew seconds he had seen it on the Captain's desk had suggested that it\r\nwas much darker. And erect as it was, it stood about eighteen inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nWith head turning rapidly, it still hesitated by the side of the vat, so\r\nnearly the color of the metal that unless it moved it was difficult to\r\ndistinguish. As far as Dane could see the Hoobat was paying it no\r\nattention. Queex might be lost in a happy dream, the result of its own\r\nfiddling. Nor did the rhythm of that scraping vary.\r\n\r\nThe nightmare thing made the last foot in a rush of speed which reduced\r\nit to a blur, coming to a halt before the Hoobat. Its front legs whipped\r\nout to strike at its enemy. But Queex was no longer dreaming. This was\r\nthe moment the Hoobat had been awaiting. One of the sawing claws opened\r\nand closed, separating the head of the lurker from its body. And before\r\neither of the men could interfere Queex had dismembered the prey with\r\ndispatch.\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" Dane pointed.\r\n\r\nThe Hoobat held close the body of the stranger and where the ashy corpse\r\ncame into contact with Queex's blue feathered skin it was slowly changing\r\nhue--as if some of the color of its hunter had rubbed off it.\r\n\r\n\"Chameleon!\" Ali went down on one knee the better to view the grisly\r\nfeast now in progress. \"Watch out!\" he added sharply as Dane came to join\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOne of the thin upper limbs lay where Queex had discarded it. And from\r\nthe needle tip was oozing some colorless drops of fluid. Poison?\r\n\r\nDane looked around for something which he could use to pick up the still\r\njerking appendage. But before he could find anything Queex had\r\nappropriated it. And in the end they had to allow the Hoobat its victim\r\nin its entirety. But once Queex had consumed its prey it lapsed into its\r\nusual hunched immobility. Dane went for the cage and working gingerly he\r\nand Ali got the creature back in captivity. But all the evidence now left\r\nwere some smears on the floor of the hydro, smears which Ali blotted up\r\nfor future research in the lab.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the four who now comprised the crew of the Queen gathered\r\nin the mess for a conference. Queex was in its cage on the table before\r\nthem, asleep after all its untoward activity.\r\n\r\n\"There must be more than just one,\" Weeks said. \"But how are we going to\r\nhunt them down? With Sinbad?\"\r\n\r\nDane shook his head. Once the Hoobat had been caged and the more\r\nprominent evidence of the battle scraped from the floor, he had brought\r\nthe cat into the hydro and forced him to sniff at the site of the\r\nengagement. The result was that Sinbad had gone raving mad and Dane's\r\nhands were now covered with claw tears which ran viciously deep. It was\r\nplain that the ship's cat was having none of the intruders, alive or\r\ndead. He had fled to Dane's cabin where he had taken refuge on the bunk\r\nand snarled wild eyed when anyone looked in from the corridor.\r\n\r\n\"Queex has to do it,\" Rip said. \"But will it hunt unless it is hungry?\"\r\n\r\nHe surveyed the now comatose creature skeptically. They had never seen\r\nthe Captain's pet eat anything except some pellets which Jellico kept in\r\nhis desk, and they were aware that the intervals between such feedings\r\nwere quite lengthy. If they had to wait the usual time for Queex to feel\r\nhunger pangs once more, they might have to wait a long time.\r\n\r\n\"We should catch one alive,\" Ali remarked thoughtfully. \"If we could get\r\nQueex to fiddle it out to where we could net it--\"\r\n\r\nWeeks nodded eagerly. \"A small net like those the Salariki use. Drop it\r\nover the thing--\"\r\n\r\nWhile Queex still drowsed in its cage, Weeks went to work with fine cord.\r\nHolding the color changing abilities of the enemy in mind they could not\r\ntell how many of the creatures might be roaming the ship. It could only\r\nbe proved where they weren't by where Sinbad would consent to stay. So\r\nthey made plans which included both the cat and the Hoobat.\r\n\r\nSinbad, much against his will, was buckled into an improvised harness by\r\nwhich he could be controlled without the handler losing too much valuable\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nAnd then the hunt started at the top of the ship, proceeding downward\r\nsection by section. Sinbad raised no protest in the control cabin, nor in\r\nthe private cabins of the officers' thereabouts. If they could interpret\r\nhis reactions the center section was free of the invaders. So with Dane\r\nin control of the cat and Ali carrying the caged Hoobat, they descended\r\nonce more to the level which housed the hydro galley, steward's quarters\r\nand ship's sick bay.\r\n\r\nSinbad proceeded on his own four feet into the galley and the mess. He\r\nwas not uneasy in the sick bay, nor in Mura's cabin, and this time he\r\neven paced the hydro without being dragged--much to their surprise as\r\nthey had thought that the headquarters of the stowaways.\r\n\r\n\"Could there only have been one?\" Weeks wanted to know as he stood by\r\nready with the net in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Either that--or else we're wrong about the hydro being their main\r\nhideout. If they're afraid of Queex now they may have withdrawn to the\r\nplace they feel the safest,\" Rip said.\r\n\r\nIt was when they were on the ladder leading to the cargo level that\r\nSinbad balked. He planted himself firmly and yowled against further\r\nprogress until Dane, with the harness, pulled him along.\r\n\r\n\"Look at Queex!\"\r\n\r\nThey followed Weeks' order. The Hoobat was no longer lethargic. It was\r\nraising itself, leaning forward to clasp the bars of its cage, and now it\r\nuttered one of its screams of rage. And as Ali went on down the ladder it\r\nrattled the bars in a determined effort for freedom. Sinbad, spitting and\r\nyowling refused to walk. Rip nodded to Ali.\r\n\r\n\"Let it out.\"\r\n\r\nTipped out of its cage the Hoobat scuttled forward, straight for the\r\npanel which opened on the large cargo space and there waited, as if for\r\nthem to open the portal and admit the hunter to its hunting territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nOFF THE MAP\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the lock of the panel was the seal set in place by Van Rycke\r\nbefore the spacer had lifted from Sargol. Under Dane's inspection it\r\nshowed no crack. To all evidence the hatch had not been opened since they\r\nleft the perfumed planet. And yet the hunting Hoobat was sure that the\r\ninvading pests were within.\r\n\r\nIt took only a second for Dane to commit an act which, if he could not\r\ndefend it later, would blacklist him out of space. He twisted off the\r\nofficial seal which should remain there while the freighter was space\r\nborne.\r\n\r\nWith Ali's help he shouldered aside the heavy sliding panel and they\r\nlooked into the cargo space, now filled with the red wood from Sargol.\r\nThe redwood! When he saw it Dane was struck with their stupidity. Aside\r\nfrom the Koros stones in the stone box, only the wood had come from the\r\nSalariki world. What if the pests had not been planted by I-S agents, but\r\nwere natives of Sargol being brought in with the wood?\r\n\r\nThe men remained at the hatch to allow the Hoobat freedom in its hunt.\r\nAnd Sinbad crouched behind them, snarling and giving voice to a rumbling\r\ngrowl which was his negative opinion of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThey were conscious of an odor--the sharp, unidentifiable scent Dane had\r\nnoticed during the loading of the wood. It was not unpleasant--merely\r\ndifferent. And it--or something--had an electrifying effect upon Queex.\r\nThe blue hunter climbed with the aid of its claws to the top of the\r\nnearest pile of wood and there settled down. For a space it was\r\napparently contemplating the area about it.\r\n\r\nThen it raised its claws and began the scraping fiddle which once before\r\nhad drawn its prey out of hiding. Oddly enough that dry rasp of sound had\r\na quieting effect upon Sinbad and Dane felt the drag of the harness\r\nlessen as the cat moved, not toward escape, but to the scene of action,\r\nhumping himself at last in the open panel, his round eyes fixed upon the\r\nHoobat with a fascinated stare.\r\n\r\nScrape-scrape--the monotonous noise bit into the ears of the men, gnawed\r\nat their nerves.\r\n\r\n\"Ahhh--\" Ali kept his voice to a whisper, but his hand jerked to draw\r\ntheir attention to the right at deck level. Dane saw that flicker along a\r\nlog. The stowaway pest was now the same brilliant color as the wood,\r\nindistinguishable until it moved, which probably explained how it had\r\ncome on board.\r\n\r\nBut that was only the first arrival. A second flash of movement and a\r\nthird followed. Then the hunted remained stationary, able to resist for a\r\nperiod the insidious summoning of Queex. The Hoobat maintained an\r\nattitude of indifference, of being so wrapped in its music that nothing\r\nelse existed. Rip whispered to Weeks:\r\n\r\n\"There's one to the left--on the very end of that log. Can you net it?\"\r\n\r\nThe small oiler slipped the coiled mesh through his calloused hands. He\r\nedged around Ali, keeping his eyes on the protruding bump of red upon red\r\nwhich was his quarry.\r\n\r\n\"--two--three--four--five--\" Ali was counting under his breath but Dane\r\ncould not see that many. He was sure of only four, and those because he\r\nhad seen them move.\r\n\r\nThe things were ringing in the pile of wood where the Hoobat fiddled, and\r\ntwo had ascended the first logs toward their doom. Weeks went down on one\r\nknee, ready to cast his net, when Dane had his first inspiration. He drew\r\nhis sleep rod, easing it out of its holster, set the lever on \"spray\" and\r\nbeamed it at three of those humps.\r\n\r\nRip seeing what he was doing, dropped a hand on Weeks' shoulder, holding\r\nthe oiler in check. A hump moved, slid down the rounded side of the log\r\ninto the narrow aisle of deck between two piles of wood. It lay quiet, a\r\nbright scarlet blot against the gray.\r\n\r\nThen Weeks did move, throwing his net over it and jerking the draw string\r\ntight, at the same time pulling the captive toward him over the deck.\r\nBut, even as it came, the scarlet of the thing's body was fast fading to\r\nan ashy pink and at last taking on a gray as dull as the metal on which\r\nit lay--the complete camouflage. Had they not had it enmeshed they might\r\nhave lost it altogether, so well did it now blend with the surface.\r\n\r\nThe other two in the path of the ray had not lost their grip upon the\r\nlogs, and the men could not advance to scoop them up. Not while there\r\nwere others not affected, free to flee back into hiding. Weeks bound the\r\nnet about the captive and looked to Rip for orders.\r\n\r\n\"Deep freeze,\" the acting-commander of the Queen said succinctly. \"Let me\r\nsee it get out of that!\"\r\n\r\nSurely the cold of the deep freeze, united to the sleep ray, would keep\r\nthe creature under control until they had a chance to study it. But, as\r\nWeeks passed Sinbad on his errand, the cat was so frantic to avoid him,\r\nthat he reared up on his hind legs, almost turning a somersault, snarling\r\nand spitting until Weeks was up the ladder to the next level. It was\r\nvery evident that the ship's cat was having none of this pest.\r\n\r\nThey might have been invisible and their actions non-existent as far as\r\nQueex was concerned. For the Hoobat continued its siren concert. The\r\nlured became more reckless, mounting the logs to Queex's post in sudden\r\ndarts. Dane wondered how the Hoobat proposed handling four of the\r\ncreatures at once. For, although the other two which had been in the path\r\nof the ray had not moved, he now counted four climbing.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to ray--\" that was Rip.\r\n\r\nBut it would have been interesting to see how Queex was prepared to\r\nhandle the four. And, though Rip had given the order to stand by, he had\r\nnot ordered the ray to be used. Was he, too, interested in that?\r\n\r\nThe first red projection was within a foot of the Hoobat now and its\r\nfellows had frozen as if to allow it the honor of battle with the\r\nfeathered enemy. To all appearances Queex did not see it, but when it\r\nsprang with a whir of speed which would baffle a human, the Hoobat was\r\nready and its claws, halting their rasp, met around the wasp-thin waist\r\nof the pest, speedily cutting it in two. Only this time the Hoobat made\r\nno move to unjoint and consume the victim. Instead it squatted in utter\r\nsilence, as motionless as a tri-dee print.\r\n\r\nThe heavy lower half of the creature rolled down the pile of logs to the\r\ndeck and there paled to the gray of its background. None of its kind\r\nappeared to be interested in its fate. The two which had been in the path\r\nof the ray, continued to be humps on the wood, the others faced the\r\nHoobat.\r\n\r\nBut Rip was ready to waste no more time. \"Ray them!\" he snapped.\r\n\r\nAll three of their sleep rods sprayed the pile, catching in passing the\r\nHoobat. Queex's pop eyes closed, but it showed no other sign of falling\r\nunder the spell of the beam.\r\n\r\nCertain that all the creatures in sight were now relatively harmless, the\r\nthree approached the logs. But it was necessary to get into touching\r\ndistance before they could even make out the outlines of the nightmare\r\nthings, so well did their protective coloring conceal them. Wearing\r\ngloves Ali detached the little monsters from their holds on the wood and\r\nput them for temporary safekeeping--during a transfer to the deep\r\nfreeze--into the Hoobat's cage. Queex, they decided to leave where it was\r\nfor a space, to awaken and trap any survivor which had been too wary to\r\nemerge at the first siren song. As far as they could tell the Hoobat was\r\ntheir only possible protection against the pest and to leave it in the\r\ncenter of infection was the wisest course.\r\n\r\nHaving dumped the now metal colored catch into the freeze, they held a\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n\"No plague--\" Weeks breathed a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n\"No proof of that yet,\" Ali caught him up short. \"We have to prove it\r\npast any reasonable doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how are we going to do--?\" Dane began when he saw what the other had\r\nbrought in from Tau's stores. A lancet and the upper half of the creature\r\nQueex had killed in the cargo hold.\r\n\r\nThe needle pointed front feet of the thing were curled up in its death\r\nthroes and it was now a dirty white shade as if the ability to change\r\ncolor had been lost before it matched the cotton on which it lay. With\r\nthe lancet Ali forced a claw away from the body. It was oozing the watery\r\nliquid which they had seen on the one in the hydro.\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" he said slowly, his eyes on the mangled creature rather\r\nthan on his shipmates, \"that we might have escaped being attacked because\r\nthey sheered off from us. But if we were clawed we might take it too.\r\nRemember those marks on the throats and backs of the rest? That might be\r\nthe entry point of this poison--if poison it is--\"\r\n\r\nDane could see the end of that line of reasoning. Rip and Ali--they\r\ncouldn't be spared. The knowledge they had would bring the Queen to\r\nearth. But a Cargo-master was excess baggage when there was no reason for\r\ntrade. It was his place to try out the truth of Ali's surmise.\r\n\r\nBut while he thought another acted. Weeks leaned over and twitched the\r\nlancet out of Ali's fingers. Then, before any of them could move, he\r\nthrust its contaminated point into the back of his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\"\r\n\r\nBoth Dane's cry and Rip's hand came too late. It had been done. And Weeks\r\nsat there, looking alone and frightened, studying the drop of blood which\r\nmarked the dig of the surgeon's keen knife. But when he spoke his voice\r\nsounded perfectly natural.\r\n\r\n\"Headache first, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\nOnly Ali was outwardly unaffected by what the little man had just done.\r\n\"Just be sure you have a real one,\" he warned with what Dane privately\r\nconsidered real callousness.\r\n\r\nWeeks nodded. \"Don't let my imagination work,\" he answered shrewdly. \"I\r\nknow. It has to be real. How long do you suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" Rip sounded tired, beaten. \"Meanwhile,\" he got to his\r\nfeet, \"we'd better set a course home--\"\r\n\r\n\"Home,\" Weeks repeated. To him Terra was not his own home--he had been\r\nborn in the polar swamps of Venus. But to All Solarians--no matter which\r\nplanet had nurtured them--Terra was home.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" Rip's big hand fell gently on the little oiler's shoulder, \"stay\r\nhere with Thorson--\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Weeks shook his head. \"Unless I black out, I'm riding station in\r\nthe engine room. Maybe the bug won't work on me anyway.\"\r\n\r\nAnd because he had done what he had done they could not deny him the\r\nright to ride his station as long as he could during the grueling hours\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nDane visited the cargo hold once more. To be greeted by an irate scream\r\nwhich assured him that Queex was again awake and on guard. Although the\r\nHoobat was ready enough to give tongue, it still squatted in its chosen\r\nposition on top of the log stack and he did not try to dislodge it.\r\nPerhaps with Queex planted in the enemies' territory they would have\r\nnothing to fear from any pests not now confined in the deep freeze.\r\n\r\nRip set his course for Terra--for that plague spot on their native world\r\nwhere they might hide out the Queen until they could prove their\r\npoint--that the spacer was not a disease ridden ship to be feared. He\r\nkept to the control cabin, shifting only between the Astrogator's and the\r\npilot's station. Upon him alone rested the responsibility of bringing in\r\nthe ship along a vector which crossed no well traveled space lane where\r\nthe Patrol might challenge them. Dane rode out the orbiting in the\r\nCom-tech's seat, listening in for the first warning of danger--that they\r\nhad been detected.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical repetition of their list of crimes was now stale news and\r\nlargely off-ether. And from all traces he could pick up, they were lost\r\nas far as the authorities were concerned. On the other hand, the Patrol\r\nmight indeed be as far knowing as its propaganda stated and the Queen was\r\nrunning headlong into a trap. Only they had no choice in the matter.\r\n\r\nIt was the ship's inter-com bringing Ali's voice from the engine room\r\nwhich broke the concentration in the control cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Weeks' down!\"\r\n\r\nRip barked into the mike. \"How bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"He hasn't blacked out yet. The pains in his head are pretty bad and his\r\nhand is swelling--\"\r\n\r\n\"He's given us our proof. Tell him to report off--\"\r\n\r\nBut the disembodied voice which answered that was Weeks'.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't got it as bad as the others. I'll ride this out.\"\r\n\r\nRip shook his head. But short-handed as they were he could not argue\r\nWeeks away from his post if the man insisted upon staying. He had other,\r\nand for the time being, more important matters before him.\r\n\r\nHow long they sweated out that descent upon their native world Dane could\r\nnever afterwards have testified. He only knew that hours must have\r\npassed, until he thought groggily that he could not remember a time he\r\nwas not glued in the seat which had been Tang's, the earphones pressing\r\nagainst his sweating skull, his fatigue-drugged mind being held with\r\ndifficulty to the duty at hand.\r\n\r\nSometime during that haze they made their landing. He had a dim memory of\r\nRip sprawled across the pilot's control board and then utter exhaustion\r\nclaimed him also and the darkness closed in. When he roused it was to\r\nlook about a cabin tilted to one side. Rip was still slumped in a muscle\r\ncramping posture, breathing heavily. Dane bit out a forceful word born of\r\ntwinges of his own, and then snapped on the visa-plate.\r\n\r\nFor a long moment he was sure that he was not yet awake. And then, as his\r\ndazed mind supplied names for what he saw, he knew that Rip had failed.\r\nFar from being in the center--or at least well within the perimeter of\r\nthe dread Big Burn--they must have landed in some civic park or national\r\nforest. For the massed green outside, the bright flowers, the bird he\r\nsighted as a brilliant flash of wind coasting color--those were not to\r\nbe found in the twisted horror left by man's last attempt to impress his\r\nwill upon his resisting kind.\r\n\r\nWell, it had been a good try, but there was no use expecting luck to ride\r\ntheir fins all the way, and they had had more than their share in the\r\nE-Stat affair. How long would it be before the Law arrived to collect\r\nthem? Would they have time to state their case?\r\n\r\nThe faint hope that they might aroused him. He reached for the com key\r\nand a second later tore the headphones from his appalled ears. The\r\ncrackle of static he knew--and the numerous strange noises which broke in\r\nupon the lanes of communication in space--but this solid, paralyzing roar\r\nwas something totally new--new, and frightening.\r\n\r\nAnd because it was new and he could not account for it, he turned back to\r\nregard the scene on the viewer with a more critical eye. The foliage\r\nwhich grew in riotous profusion was green right enough, and Terra green\r\ninto the bargain--there was no mistaking that. But--Dane caught at the\r\nedge of Com-unit for support. But--What was that liver-red blossom which\r\nhad just reached out to engulf a small flying thing?\r\n\r\nFeverishly he tried to remember the little natural history he knew. Sure\r\nthat what he had just witnessed was unnatural--un-Terran--and to be\r\nsuspect!\r\n\r\nHe started the spy lens on its slow revolution in the Queen's nose, to\r\nget a full picture of their immediate surroundings. It was tilted at an\r\nangle--apparently they had not made a fin-point landing this time--and\r\nsometimes it merely reflected slices of sky. But when it swept earthward\r\nhe saw enough to make him believe that wherever the spacer had set down\r\nit was not on the Terra he knew.\r\n\r\nSubconsciously he had expected the Big Burn to be barren land--curdled\r\nrock with rivers of frozen quartz, substances boiled up through the crust\r\nof the planet by the action of the atomic explosives. That was the way it\r\nhad been on Limbo--on the other \"burned-off\" worlds they had discovered\r\nwhere those who had preceded mankind into the Galaxy--the mysterious,\r\nlong vanished \"Forerunners\"--had fought their grim and totally\r\nannihilating wars.\r\n\r\nBut it would seem that the Big Burn was altogether different--at least\r\nhere it was. There was no rock sterile of life outside--in fact there\r\nwould appear to be too much life. What Dane could sight on his limited\r\nfield of vision was a teeming jungle. And the thrill of that discovery\r\nalmost made him forget their present circumstances. He was still staring\r\nbemused at the screen when Rip muttered, turned his head on his folded\r\narms and opened his sunken eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Did we make it?\" he asked dully.\r\n\r\nDane, not taking his eyes from that fascinating scene without, answered:\r\n\"You brought us down. But I don't know where--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless our instruments were 'way off, we're near to the heart of the\r\nBurn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it look like?\" Rip sounded too tired to cross the cabin and\r\nsee for himself. \"Barren as Limbo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly! Rip, did you ever see a tomato as big as a melon--At least it\r\nlooks like a tomato,\" Dane halted the spy lens as it focused upon this\r\nnew phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"A what?\" There was a note of concern in Shannon's voice. \"What's the\r\nmatter with you, Dane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come and see,\" Dane willingly yielded his place to Rip but he did not\r\nstep out of range of the screen. Surely that did have the likeness to a\r\ngood, old fashioned earth-side tomato--but it was melon size and it hung\r\nfrom a bush which was close to a ten foot tree!\r\n\r\nRip stumbled across to drop into the Com-tech's place. But his expression\r\nof worry changed to one of simple astonishment as he saw that picture.\r\n\r\n\"Where are we?\"\r\n\r\n\"You name it,\" Dane had had longer to adjust, the excitement of an\r\nexplorer sighting virgin territory worked in his veins, banishing\r\nfatigue. \"It must be the Big Burn!\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" Rip shook his head slowly as if with that gesture to deny the\r\nevidence before his eyes, \"that country's all bare rock. I've seen\r\npictures--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the outer rim,\" Dane corrected, having already solved that problem\r\nfor himself. \"This must be farther in than any survey ship ever came.\r\nGreat Spirit of Outer Space, what has happened here?\"\r\n\r\nRip had enough technical training to know how to get part of the answer.\r\nHe leaned halfway across the com, and was able to flick down a lever with\r\nthe very tip of his longest finger. Instantly the cabin was filled with a\r\nclicking so loud as to make an almost continuous drone of sound.\r\n\r\nDane knew that danger signal, he didn't need Rip's words to underline it\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\n\"That's what's happened. This country is pile 'hot' out there!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MISSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThat click, the dial beneath the counter, warned them that they were as\r\ncut off from the luxuriance outside as if they were viewing a scene on\r\nMars or Sargol from their present position. To go beyond the shielding\r\nwalls of the spacer into that riotous green world would sentence them to\r\ndeath as surely as if the Patrol was without, with a flamer trained on\r\ntheir hatch. There was no escape from that radiation--it would be in the\r\nair one breathed, strike though one's skin. And yet the wilderness\r\nflourished and beckoned.\r\n\r\n\"Mutations--\" Rip mused. \"Space, Tau'd go wild if he could see it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd that mention of the Medic brought them back to the problem which had\r\nearthed them. Dane leaned back against the slanting wall of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"We have to have a Medic--\"\r\n\r\nRip nodded without looking away from the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Can one of the flitters be shielded?\" The Cargo-apprentice persisted.\r\n\r\n\"That's a thought! Ali should know--\" Rip reached for the inter-com mike.\r\n\"Engines!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you _are alive_?\" Ali's voice had a bite in it. \"About time you're\r\ncontacting. Where are we? Besides being lopsided from a recruit's\r\nscrambled set-down, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Big Burn. Come top-side. Wait--how's Weeks?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a devil's own headache, but he hasn't blacked out yet. Looks like\r\nhis immunity holds in part. I've sent him bunkside for a while with a\r\ncouple of pain pills. So we've made it--\"\r\n\r\nHe must have left to join them for when Rip answered: \"After a fashion,\"\r\ninto the mike there was no reply.\r\n\r\nAnd the clang of his boot plates on the ladder heralded his arrival at\r\ntheir post. There was an interval for him to view the outer world and\r\naccept the verdict of the counter and then Rip voiced Dane's question:\r\n\r\n\"Can we shield one of the flitters well enough to cross that? I can't\r\ntake the Queen up and earth her again--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you can't!\" the acting-engineer cut in. \"Maybe you could get her\r\noff world, but you'll come close to blasting out when you try for another\r\nlanding. Fuel doesn't go on forever--though some of you space jockeys\r\nseem to think it does. The flitter? Well, we've some spare rocket\r\nlinings. But it's going to be a job and a half to get those beaten out\r\nand reassembled. And, frankly, the space whirly one who flies her had\r\nbetter be suited and praying loudly when he takes off. We can always\r\ntry--\" He was frowning, already busied with the problem which was one for\r\nhis department.\r\n\r\nSo with intervals of snatched sleep, hurried meals and the time which\r\nmust be given to tending their unconscious charges, Rip and Dane became\r\nonly hands to be directed by Ali's brain and garnered knowledge. Weeks\r\nslept off the worst of his pain and, though he complained of weakness, he\r\ntottered back on duty to help.\r\n\r\nThe flitter--an air sled intended to hold three men and supplies for\r\nexploring trips on strange-worlds--was first stripped of all\r\nnon-essentials until what remained was not much more than the pilot's\r\nseat and the motor. Then they labored to build up a shielding of the\r\ntough radiation dulling alloy which was used to line rocket tubes. And\r\nthey could only praise the foresight of Stotz who carried such a full\r\nsupply of spare parts and tools. It was a task over which they often\r\ndespaired, and Ali improvised frantically, performing weird adjustments\r\nof engineering structure. He was still unsatisfied when they had done.\r\n\r\n\"She'll fly,\" he admitted. \"And she's the best we can do. But it'll\r\ndepend a lot on how far she has to go over 'hot' country. Which way do we\r\nhead her?\"\r\n\r\nRip had been busy with a map of Terra--a small thing he had discovered in\r\none of the travel recordings carried for crew entertainment.\r\n\r\n\"The Big Burn covers three quarters of this continent. There's no use\r\ngoing north--the devastated area extends into the arctic regions. I'd say\r\nwest--there's some fringe settlements on the sea coast and we need to\r\ncontact a frontier territory. Now do we have it straight--? I take the\r\nflitter, get a Medic and bring him back?\"\r\n\r\nDane cut in at that point. \"Correct course! You stay here. If the Queen\r\nhas to lift, you're the only one who can take her off world. And the\r\nsame's true for Ali. I can't ride out a blast-off in either the pilot's\r\nor the engineer's seat. And Weeks is on the sick list. So I'm elected to\r\ndo the Medic hunting--\"\r\n\r\nThey were forced to agree to that. He was no hero, Dane thought, as he\r\ngave a last glance about his cabin early the next morning. The small\r\ncubby, utilitarian and bare as it was, never looked more inviting or\r\nsecure. No, no hero, it was merely a matter of common sense. And although\r\nhis imagination--that deeply hidden imagination with which few of his\r\nfellows credited him--shrank from the ordeal ahead, he had not the\r\nslightest intention of allowing that to deter him.\r\n\r\nThe space suit, which had been bulky and clumsy enough on the E-Stat\r\nasteroid under limited gravity, was almost twice as poorly adapted to\r\nprogression on earth. But he climbed into it with Rip's aid, while Ali\r\nlashed a second suit under the seat--ready to encase the man Dane must\r\nbring back with him. Before he closed the helmet, Rip had one last order\r\nto give, along with an unexpected piece of equipment. And, when Dane saw\r\nthat, he knew just how desperate Shannon considered their situation to\r\nbe. For only on life or death terms would the Astrogator-apprentice have\r\nused Jellico's private key, opened the forbidden arms cabinet, and\r\nwithdrawn that blaster.\r\n\r\n\"If you need it--use this--\" Rip's face was very sober.\r\n\r\nAli arose from fastening the extra suit in place. \"It's ready--\"\r\n\r\nHe came back into the corridor and Dane clanked out in his place,\r\nsettling himself behind the controls. When they saw him there, the inner\r\nhatch closed and he was alone in the bay.\r\n\r\nWith tantalizing slowness the outer wall of the spacer slid back. His\r\nhands blundering with the metallic claws of the gloves, Dane buckled two\r\nsafety belts about him. Then the skeleton flitter moved to the left--out\r\ninto the glare of the early day, a light too bright, even through the\r\nshielded viewplates of his helmet.\r\n\r\nFor some dangerous moments the machine creaked out and down on the landing\r\ncranes, the warning counter on its control panel going into a mad whirl\r\nof color as it tried to record the radiation. There came a jar as it\r\ntouched the scorched earth at the foot of the Queen's fins.\r\n\r\nDane pressed the release and watched the lines whip up and the hatch\r\nabove snap shut. Then he opened the controls. He used too much energy and\r\nshot into the air, tearing a wide gap through what was luckily a thin\r\nscreen of the matted foliage, before he gained complete mastery.\r\n\r\nThen he was able to level out and bore westward, the rising sun at his\r\nback, the sea of deadly green beneath him, and somewhere far ahead the\r\nfaint promise of clean, radiation free land holding the help they needed.\r\n\r\nMile after mile of the green jungle swept under the flitter, and the\r\nflash of the counter's light continued to record a land unfit for\r\nmankind. Even with the equipment used on distant worlds to protect what\r\nspacemen had come to recognize was a reasonably tough human frame, no\r\nground force could hope to explore that wilderness in person. And flying\r\nabove it, as well insulated as he was, Dane knew that he could be\r\ndangerously exposed. If the contaminated territory extended more than a\r\nthousand miles, his danger was no longer problematical--it was an\r\nestablished fact.\r\n\r\nHe had only the vague directions from the scrap of map Rip had uncovered.\r\nTo the west--he had no idea how far away--there stretched a length of\r\ncoastline, far enough from the radiation blasted area to allow small\r\nsettlements. For generations the population of Terra, decimated by the\r\natomic wars, and then drained by first system and then Galactic\r\nexploration and colonization, had been decreasing. But within the past\r\nhundred years it was again on the upswing. Men retiring from space were\r\nreturning to their native planet to live out their remaining years. The\r\ndescendants of far-flung colonists, coming home on visits, found the\r\nsparsely populated mother world appealed to some basic instinct so that\r\nthey remained. And now the settlements of mankind were on the march,\r\nspreading out from the well established sections which had not been\r\nblighted by ancient wars.\r\n\r\nIt was mid-afternoon when Dane noted that the green carpet beneath the\r\nflitter was displaying holes--that small breaks in the vegetation became\r\nsizable stretches of rocky waste. He kept one eye on the counter and\r\nwhat, when he left the spacer, had been an almost steady beam of warning\r\nlight was now a well defined succession of blinks. The land below was\r\ncooling off--perhaps he had passed the worst of the journey. But in that\r\npassing how much had he and the flitter become contaminated? Ali had\r\ndevised a method of protection for the empty suit the Medic would\r\nwear--had that held? There were an alarming number of dark ifs in the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\nThe mutant growths were now only thin patches of stunted and yellowish\r\ngreen. Had man penetrated only this far into the Burn, the knowledge of\r\nwhat lay beyond would be totally false. This effect of dreary waste might\r\nwell discourage exploration.\r\n\r\nNow the blink of the counter was deliberate, with whole seconds of pause\r\nbetween the flashes. Cooling off--? It was getting cold fast! He wished\r\nthat he had a com-unit. Because of the interference in the Burn he had\r\nleft it behind--but with one he might be able now to locate some\r\nsettlement. All that remained was to find the seashore and, with it as a\r\nguide, flit south towards the center of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nHe laid no plans of action--this whole exploit must depend upon\r\nimprovisation. And, as a Free Trader, spur-of-the-moment action was a\r\nnecessary way of life. On the frontier Rim of the Galaxy, where the\r\nindependent spacers traced the star trails, fast thinking and the ability\r\nto change plans on an instant were as important as skill in aiming a\r\nblaster. And it was very often proven that the tongue--and the brain\r\nbehind it--were more deadly than a flamer.\r\n\r\nThe sun was in Dane's face now and he caught sight of patches of\r\nuncontaminated earth with honest vegetation--in place of the \"hot\" jungle\r\nnow miles behind. That night he camped out on the edge of rough pasturage\r\nwhere the counter no longer flashed its warning and he was able to shed\r\nthe suit and sleep under the stars with the fresh air of early summer\r\nagainst his cheek and the smell of honest growing things replacing the\r\ndry scent of the spacer and the languorous perfumes of Sargol.\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back, flat against the earth of which he was truly a part,\r\nstaring up into the dark, inverted bowl of the heavens. It was so hard to\r\nconnect those distant points of icy light making the well remembered\r\npatterns overhead with the suns whose rays had added to the brown stain\r\non his skin. Sargol's sun--the one which gave such limited light to dead\r\nLimbo--the sun under which Naxos, his first Galactic port, grew its food.\r\nHe could not pick them out--was not even sure that any could be sighted\r\nfrom Terra. Strange suns, red, orange, blue green, white--yet here all\r\nlooked alike--points of glitter.\r\n\r\nTomorrow at dawn he must go on. He turned his head away from the sky and\r\ngrass, green Terran grass, was soft beneath his cheek. Yet unless he was\r\nsuccessful tomorrow or the next day--he might never have the right to\r\nfeel that grass again. Resolutely Dane willed that thought out of his\r\nmind, tried to fix upon something more lulling which would bring with it\r\nthe sleep he must have before he went on. And in the end he did sleep,\r\ndeeply, dreamlessly, as if the touch of Terra's soil was in itself the\r\nsedative his tautly strung nerves needed.\r\n\r\nIt was before sunrise that he awoke, stiff, and chilled. The dryness of\r\npre-dawn gave partial light and somewhere a bird was twittering. There\r\nhad been birds--or things whose far off ancestors had been birds--in the\r\n\"hot\" forest. Did they also sing to greet the dawn?\r\n\r\nDane went over the flitter with his small counter and was relieved to\r\nfind that they had done a good job of shielding under Ali's supervision.\r\nOnce the suit he had worn was stored, he could sit at the controls\r\nwithout danger and in comfort. And it was good to be free of that metal\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThis time he took to the air with ease, the salt taste of food\r\nconcentrate on his tongue as he sucked a cube. And his confidence arose\r\nwith the flitter. This was the day, somehow he knew it. He was going to\r\nfind what he sought.\r\n\r\nIt was less than two hours after sunrise that he did so. A village which\r\nwas a cluster of perhaps fifty or so house units strung along into the\r\nland. He skimmed across it and brought the flitter down in a rock cliff\r\nwalled sand pocket with surf booming some yards away, where he would be\r\nreasonably sure of safe hiding.\r\n\r\nAll right, he had found a village. Now what? A Medic--A stranger\r\nappearing on the lane which served the town, a stranger in a distinctive\r\nuniform of Trade, would only incite conjecture and betrayal. He had to\r\nplan now--\r\n\r\nDane unsealed his tunic. He should, by rights, shed his space boots too.\r\nBut perhaps he could use those to color his story. He thrust the blaster\r\ninto hiding at his waist. A rip or two in his undertunic, a shallow cut\r\nfrom his bush knife allowed to bleed messily. He could not see himself to\r\njudge the general effect, but had to hope it was the right one.\r\n\r\nHis chance to test his acting powers came sooner than he had anticipated.\r\nLuckily he had climbed out of the hidden cove before he was spotted by\r\nthe boy who came whistling along the path, a fishing pole over his\r\nshoulder, a basket swinging from his hand. Dane assumed an expression\r\nwhich he thought would suggest fatigue, pain, and bewilderment and\r\nlurched forward as if, in sighting the oncoming boy, he had also sighted\r\nhope.\r\n\r\n\"Help--!\" Perhaps it was excitement which gave his utterance that\r\nconvincing croak.\r\n\r\nRod and basket fell to the ground as the boy, after one astounded stare,\r\nran forward.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter!\" His eyes were on those space boots and he added a\r\n\"sir\" which had the ring of hero worship.\r\n\r\n\"Escape boat--\" Dane waved toward the sea's general direction.\r\n\"Medic--must get to Medic--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" the boy's basic Terran sounded good. \"Can you walk if I help\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nDane managed a weak nod, but contrived that he did not lean too heavily\r\non his avidly helpful guide.\r\n\r\n\"The Medic's my father, sir. We're right down this slope--third house.\r\nAnd father hasn't left--he's supposed to go on a northern inspection tour\r\ntoday--\"\r\n\r\nDane felt a stab of distaste for the role being forced upon him. When he\r\nhad visualized the Medic he must abduct to serve the Queen in her need,\r\nhe had not expected to have to kidnap a family man. Only the knowledge\r\nthat he did have the extra suit, and that he had made the outward trip\r\nwithout dangerous exposure, bolstered up his determination to see the\r\nplan through.\r\n\r\nWhen they came out at the end of the single long lane which tied the\r\nhouses of the village together, Dane was puzzled to see the place so\r\ndeserted. But, since it was not within his role of dazed sufferer to ask\r\nquestions, he did not do so. It was his young guide who volunteered the\r\ninformation he wanted.\r\n\r\n\"Most everyone is out with the fleet. There's a run of red-backs--\"\r\n\r\nDane understood. Within recent times the \"red-backs\" of the north had\r\nbecome a desirable luxury item for Terran tables. If a school of them\r\nwere to be found in the vicinity no wonder this village was now deserted\r\nas its fleet went out to garner in the elusive but highly succulent fish.\r\n\r\n\"In here, sir--\" Dane found himself being led to a house on the right.\r\n\"Are you in Trade--?\"\r\n\r\nHe suppressed a start, shedding his uniform tunic had not done much in\r\nthe way of disguise. It would be nice, he thought a little bitterly, if\r\nhe could flash an I-S badge now to completely confuse the issue. But he\r\nanswered with the partial truth and did not enlarge.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\"\r\n\r\nThe boy was flushed with excitement. \"I'm trying for Trade Service\r\nMedic,\" he confided. \"Passed the Directive exam last month. But I still\r\nhave to go up for Prelim psycho--\"\r\n\r\nDane had a flash of memory. Not too many months before not the Prelim\r\npsycho, but the big machine at the Assignment Center had decided his own\r\nfuture arbitrarily, fitting him into the crew of the Solar Queen as the\r\nship where _his_ abilities, knowledge and potentialities could best work\r\nto the good of the Service. At the time he had resented, had even been\r\nslightly ashamed of being relegated to a Free Trading spacer while Artur\r\nSands and other classmates from the Pool had walked off with Company\r\nassignments. Now he knew that he would not trade the smallest and most\r\nrusty bolt from the Solar Queen for the newest scout ship in I-S or\r\nCombine registry. And this boy from the frontier village might be himself\r\nas he was five years earlier. Though he had never known a real home or\r\nfamily, scrapping into the Pool from one of the children's Depots.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck!\" He meant that and the boy's flush deepened.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir. Around here--Father's treatment room has this other\r\ndoor--\"\r\n\r\nDane allowed himself to be helped into the treatment room and sat down in\r\na chair while the boy hurried off to locate the Medic. The Trader's hand\r\nwent to the butt of his concealed blaster. It was a job he had to do--one\r\nhe had volunteered for--and there was no backing out. But his mouth had a\r\nwry twist as he drew out the blaster and made ready to point it at the\r\ninner door. Or--his mind leaped to another idea--could he get the Medic\r\nsafely out of the village? A story about another man badly\r\ninjured--perhaps pinned in the wreckage of an escape boat--He could try\r\nit. He thrust the blaster back inside his torn undertunic, hoping the\r\nbulge would pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"My son says--\"\r\n\r\nDane looked up. The man who came through the inner door was in early\r\nmiddle age, thin, wiry, with a hard, fined-down look about him. He could\r\nalmost be Tau's elder brother. He crossed the room with a brisk stride\r\nand came to stand over Dane, his hand reaching to pull aside the bloody\r\ncloth covering the Trader's breast. But Dane fended off that examination.\r\n\r\n\"My partner,\" he said. \"Back there--pinned in--\" he jerked his hand\r\nsouthward. \"Needs help--\"\r\n\r\nThe Medic frowned. \"Most of the men are out with the fleet. Jorge,\" he\r\nspoke to the boy who had followed him, \"go and get Lex and Hartog. Here,\"\r\nhe tried to push Dane back into the chair as the Trader got up, \"let me\r\nlook at that cut--\"\r\n\r\nDane shook his head. \"No time now, sir. My partner's hurt bad. Can you\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\" The Medic reached for the emergency kit on the shelf behind\r\nhim. \"You able to make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Dane was exultant. It was going to work! He could toll the Medic\r\naway from the village. Once out among the rocks on the shoreline he could\r\npull the blaster and herd the man to the flitter. His luck was going to\r\nhold after all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nMEDIC HOVAN REPORTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFortunately the path out of the straggling town was a twisted one and in\r\na very short space they were hidden from view. Dane paused as if the pace\r\nwas too much for an injured man. The Medic put out a steadying hand, only\r\nto drop it quickly when he saw the weapon which had appeared in Dane's\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\n\"What--?\" His mouth snapped shut, his jaw tightened.\r\n\r\n\"You will march ahead of me,\" Dane's low voice was steady. \"Beyond that\r\nrock spur to the left you'll find a place where it is possible to climb\r\ndown to sea level. Do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I shouldn't ask why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now. We haven't much time. Get moving!\"\r\n\r\nThe Medic mastered his surprise and without further protest obeyed\r\norders. It was only when they were standing by the flitter and he saw the\r\nsuits that his eyes widened and he said:\r\n\r\n\"The Big Burn!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I'm desperate--\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be--or mad--\" The Medic stared at Dane for a long moment and\r\nthen shook his head. \"What is it? A plague ship?\"\r\n\r\nDane bit his lip. The other was too astute. But he did not ask why or how\r\nhe had been able to guess so shrewdly. Instead he gestured to the suit\r\nAli had lashed beneath the seat in the flitter. \"Get into that and be\r\nquick about it!\"\r\n\r\nThe Medic rubbed his hand across his jaw. \"I think that you might just be\r\ndesperate enough to use that thing you're brandishing about so\r\nmelodramatically if I don't,\" he remarked in a calmly conversational\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"I won't kill. But a blaster burn--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can be pretty painful. Yes, I know that, young man. And,\" suddenly he\r\nshrugged, put down his kit and started donning the suit. \"I wouldn't put\r\nit past you to knock me out and load me aboard if I did say no. All\r\nright--\"\r\n\r\nSuited, he took his place on the seat as Dane directed, and then the\r\nTrader followed the additional precaution of lashing the Medic's metal\r\nencased arms to his body before he climbed into his own protective\r\ncovering. Now they could only communicate by sight through the vision\r\nplates of their helmets.\r\n\r\nDane triggered the controls and they arose out of the sand and rock\r\nhollow just as a party of two men and a boy came hurrying along the top\r\nof the cliff--Jorge and the rescuers arriving too late. The flitter\r\nspiraled up into the sunlight and Dane wondered how long it would be\r\nbefore this outrage was reported to the nearest Plant Police base. But\r\nwould any Police cruiser have the hardihood to follow him into the Big\r\nBurn? He hoped that the radiation would hold them back.\r\n\r\nThere was no navigation to be done. The flitter's \"memory\" should deposit\r\nthem at the Queen. Dane wondered at what his silent companion was now\r\nthinking. The Medic had accepted his kidnapping with such docility that\r\nthe very ease of their departure began to bother Dane. Was the other\r\nexpecting a trailer? Had exploration into the Big Burn from the seaside\r\nvillages been more extensive than reported officially?\r\n\r\nHe stepped up the power of the flitter to the top notch and saw with some\r\nrelief that the ground beneath them was now the rocky waste bordering the\r\ndevastated area. The metal encased figure that shared his seat had not\r\nmoved, but now the bubble head turned as if the Medic were intent upon\r\nthe ground flowing beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe flicker of the counter began and Dane realized that nightfall would\r\nfind them still air borne. But so far he had not been aware of any\r\npursuit. Again he wished he had the use of a com--only here the radiation\r\nwould blanket sound with that continuous roar.\r\n\r\nPatches of the radiation vegetation showed now and something in the lines\r\nof the Medic's tense figure suggested that these were new to him.\r\nAfternoon waned as the patches united, spread into the beginning of the\r\njungle as the counter was once more an almost steady light. When evening\r\nclosed in they were not caught in darkness--for below trees, looping\r\nvines, brush, had a pale, evil glow of their own, proclaiming their\r\ntoxicity with bluish halos. Sometimes pockets of these made a core of\r\nlight which pulsed, sending warning fingers at the flitter which sped\r\nacross it.\r\n\r\nThe hour was close on midnight before Dane sighted the other light, the\r\npink-red of which winked through the ghastly blue-white with a natural\r\nand comforting promise, even though it had been meant for an entirely\r\ndifferent purpose. The Queen had earthed with her distress lights on and\r\nno one had remembered to snap them off. Now they acted as a beacon to\r\ndraw the flitter to its berth.\r\n\r\nDane brought the stripped flyer down on the fused ground as close to the\r\nspot from which he had taken off as he could remember. Now--if those on\r\nthe spacer would only move fast enough--!\r\n\r\nBut he need not have worried, his arrival had been anticipated. Above,\r\nthe rounded side of the spacer bulged as the hatch opened. Lines swung\r\ndown to fasten their magnetic clamps on the flitter. Then once more they\r\nwere air borne, swinging up to be warped into the side of the ship. As\r\nthe outer port of the flitter berth closed Dane reached over and pulled\r\nloose the lashing which immobilized his companion. The Medic stood up, a\r\nlittle awkwardly as might any man who wore space armor the first time.\r\n\r\nThe inner hatch now opened and Dane waved his captive into the small\r\nsection which must serve them as a decontamination space. Free at last of\r\nthe suits, they went through one more improvised hatch to the main\r\ncorridor of the Queen where Rip and Ali stood waiting, their weary faces\r\nlighting as they saw the Medic.\r\n\r\nIt was the latter who spoke first. \"This _is_ a plague ship--\"\r\n\r\nRip shook his head. \"It is _not_, sir. And you're the one who is going to\r\nhelp us prove that.\"\r\n\r\nThe man leaned back against the wall, his face expressionless. \"You take\r\na rather tough way of trying to get help.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the only way left us. I'll be frank,\" Rip continued, \"we're\r\nPatrol Posted.\"\r\n\r\nThe Medic's shrewd eyes went from one drawn young face to the next. \"You\r\ndon't look like desperate criminals,\" was his comment. \"This your full\r\ncrew?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the rest are your concern. That is--if you will take the job--\"\r\nRip's shoulders slumped a little.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't left me much choice, have you? If there is illness on board,\r\nI'm under the Oath--whether you are Patrol Posted or not. What's the\r\ntrouble?\"\r\n\r\nThey got him down to Tau's laboratory and told him their story. From a\r\nslight incredulity his expression changed to an alert interest and he\r\ndemanded to see, first the patients and then the pests now immured in a\r\ndeep freeze. Sometime in the middle of this, Dane, overcome by fatigue\r\nwhich was partly relief from tension, sought his cabin and the bunk from\r\nwhich he wearily disposed Sinbad, only to have the purring cat crawl back\r\nonce more when he had lain down.\r\n\r\nAnd when he awoke, renewed in body and spirit, it was in a new Queen, a\r\nship in which hope and confidence now ruled.\r\n\r\n\"Hovan's already got it!\" Rip told him exultantly. \"It's that poison from\r\nthe little devils' claws right enough! A narcotic--produces some of the\r\naffects of deep sleep. In fact--it may have a medical use. He's excited\r\nabout it--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Dane waved aside information which under other\r\ncircumstances, promising as it did a chance for future trade, would have\r\nengrossed him, to ask a question which at the moment seemed far more to\r\nthe point. \"Can he get our men back on their feet?\"\r\n\r\nA little of Rip's exuberance faded. \"Not right away. He's given them all\r\nshots. But he thinks they'll have to sleep it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we have no idea how long that is going to take,\" Ali contributed.\r\n\r\nTime--for the first time in days Dane was struck by that--time! Because\r\nof his training a fact he had forgotten in the past weeks of worry now\r\ncame to mind--their contract with the storm priests. Even if they were\r\nable to clear themselves of the plague charge, even if the rest of the\r\ncrew were speedily restored to health, he was sure that they could not\r\nhope to return to Sargol with the promised cargo, the pay for which was\r\nalready on board the Queen. They would have broken their pledge and there\r\ncould be no hope of holding to their trading rights on that world--if\r\nthey were not blacklisted for breaking contract into the bargain. I-S\r\nwould be able to move in and clean up and probably they could never prove\r\nthat the Company was behind their misfortunes--though the men of the\r\nQueen would always be convinced that that fact was the truth.\r\n\r\n\"We're going to break contract--\" he said aloud and that shook the other\r\ntwo, knocked some of their assurance out of them.\r\n\r\n\"How about that?\" Rip asked Ali.\r\n\r\nThe acting-engineer nodded. \"We have fuel enough to lift from here and\r\nmaybe set down at Terraport--if we take it careful and cut vectors. We\r\ncan't lift from there without refueling--and of course the Patrol are\r\ngoing to sit on their hands while we do that--with us Posted! No, put out\r\nof your heads any plan for getting back to Sargol within the time limit.\r\nThorson's right--that way we're flamed out!\"\r\n\r\nRip slumped in his seat. \"So the Eysies can take over after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I see it,\" Dane cut in, \"let's just take one thing at a time. We may\r\nhave to argue a broken contract out before the Board. But first we have\r\nto get off the Posted hook with the Patrol. Have you any idea about how\r\nwe are going to handle that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hovan's on our side. In fact if we let him have the bugs to play with\r\nhe'll back us all the way. He can swear us a clean bill of health before\r\nthe Medic Control Center.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much will that count after we've broken all their regs?\" Ali wanted\r\nto know. \"If we surrender now we're not going to have much chance, no\r\nmatter what Hovan does or does not swear to. Hovan's a frontier Medic--I\r\nwon't say that he's not a member in good standing of their\r\nassociation--but he doesn't have top star rating. And with the Eysies and\r\nthe Patrol on our necks, we'll need more than one medic's word--\"\r\n\r\nBut Rip looked from the pessimistic Kamil to Dane. Now he asked a\r\nquestion which was more than half statement.\r\n\r\n\"You've thought of something?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've remembered something,\" the Cargo-apprentice corrected. \"Recall the\r\ntrick Van pulled on Limbo when the Patrol was trying to ease us out of\r\nour rights there after they took over the outlaw hold?\"\r\n\r\nAli was impatient. \"He threatened to talk to the Video people and\r\nbroadcast--tell everyone about the ships wrecked by the Forerunner\r\ninstallation and left lying about full of treasure. But what has that to\r\ndo with us now--? We bargained away our rights on Limbo for the rest of\r\nCam's monopoly on Sargol--not that it's done us much good--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Video,\" Dane fastened on the important point, \"Van threatened\r\npublicity which would embarrass the Patrol and he was legally within his\r\nrights. We're outside the law now--but publicity might help again. How\r\nmany earth-side people know of the unwritten law about open war on plague\r\nships? How many who aren't spacemen know that we could be legally pushed\r\ninto the sun and fried without any chance to prove we're innocent of\r\ncarrying a new disease? If we could talk loud and clear to the people at\r\nlarge maybe we'd have a chance for a real hearing--\"\r\n\r\n\"Right from the Terraport broadcast station, I suppose?\" Ali taunted.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the cabin as the other two chewed upon that and he\r\nbroke it again:\r\n\r\n\"We set down here when it had never been done before.\"\r\n\r\nWith one brown forefinger Rip traced some pattern known only to himself\r\non the top of the table. Ali stared at the opposite wall as if it were a\r\nbank of machinery he must master.\r\n\r\n\"It just might be whirly enough to work--\" Kamil commented softly. \"Or\r\nmaybe we've been spaced too long and the Whisperers have been chattering\r\ninto our ears. What about it, Rip, could you set us down close enough to\r\nCenter Block there?\"\r\n\r\n\"We can try anything once. But we might crash the old girl bringing her\r\nin. There's that apron between the Companies' Launching cradles and the\r\nCenter--. It's clear there and we could give an E signal coming down\r\nwhich would make them stay rid of it. But I won't try it except as a last\r\nresort.\"\r\n\r\nDane noticed that after that discouraging statement Rip made straight for\r\nJellico's record tapes and routed out the one which dealt with Terraport\r\nand the landing instructions for that metropolis of the star ships. To\r\nland unbidden there would certainly bring them publicity--and to get the\r\nVideo broadcast and tell their story would grant them not only world\r\nwide, but system wide hearing. News from Terraport was broadcast on every\r\nchannel every hour of the day and night and not a single viewer could\r\nmiss their appeal.\r\n\r\nBut first there was Hovan to be consulted. Would he be willing to back\r\nthem with his professional knowledge and assurance? Or would their\r\nhigh-handed method of recruiting his services operate against them now?\r\nThey decided to let Rip ask such questions of the Medic.\r\n\r\n\"So you're going to set us down in the center of the big jump-off?\" was\r\nhis first comment, as the acting-Captain of the Queen stated their case.\r\n\"Then you want me to fire my rockets to certify you are harmless. You\r\ndon't ask for very much, do you, son?\"\r\n\r\nRip spread his hands. \"I can understand how it looks to you, sir. We\r\ngrabbed you and brought you here by force. We can't make you testify for\r\nus if you decide not to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you?\" The Medic cocked an eyebrow at him. \"What about this bully\r\nboy of yours with his little blaster? He could herd me right up to the\r\ntelecast, couldn't he? There's a lot of persuasion in one of those nasty\r\nlittle arms. On the other hand, I've a son who's set on taking out on one\r\nof these tin pots to go star hunting. If I handed you over to the Patrol\r\nhe might make some remarks to me in private. You may be Posted, but you\r\ndon't look like very hardened criminals to me. It seems that you've been\r\nhanded a bad situation and handled it as best you know. And I'm willing\r\nto ride along the rest of the way on your tail blast. Let me see how many\r\npieces you land us in at Terraport and I'll give you my final answer. If\r\nluck holds we may have a couple more of your crew present by that time,\r\nalso--\"\r\n\r\nThey had had no indication that the Queen had been located, that any\r\nposse hunting the kidnapped Medic had followed them into the Big Burn. And\r\nthey could only hope that they would continue to remain unsighted as they\r\nupped-ship once more and cruised into a regular traffic lane for earthing\r\nat the port. It would be a chancy thing and Ali and Rip spent hours\r\nchecking the mechanics of that flight, while Dane and the recovering\r\nWeeks worked with Hovan in an effort to restore the sleeping crew.\r\n\r\nAfter three visits to the hold and the discovery that the Hoobat had\r\nuncovered no more of the pests, Dane caged the angry blue horror and\r\nreturned it to its usual stand in Jellico's cabin, certain that the ship\r\nwas clean for Sinbad now confidently prowled the corridors and went into\r\nevery cabin of storage space Dane opened for him.\r\n\r\nAnd on the morning of the day they had planned for take-off, Hovan at\r\nlast had a definite response to his treatment. Craig Tau roused, stared\r\ndazedly around, and asked a vague question. The fact he immediately\r\nrelapsed once more into semi-coma did not discourage the other Medic.\r\nProgress had been made and he was now sure that he knew the proper\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nThey strapped down at zero hour and blasted out of the weird green\r\nwilderness they had not dared to explore, lifting into the arch of the\r\nsky, depending upon Rip's knowledge to put them safely down again.\r\n\r\nDane once more rode out the take-off at the com-unit, waiting for the\r\nblast of radiation born static to fade so that he could catch any\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\n\"--turned back last night. The high level of radiation makes it almost\r\ncertain that the outlaws could not have headed into the dangerous central\r\nportion. Search is now spreading north. Authorities are inclined to\r\nbelieve that this last outrage may be a clew to the vanished 'Solar\r\nQueen,' a plague ship, warned off and Patrol Posted after her crew\r\nplundered an E-Stat belonging to the Inter-Solar Corporation. Anyone\r\nhaving any information concerning this ship--or any strange\r\nspacer--report at once to the nearest Terrapolice or Patrol station. Do\r\nnot take chances--report any contact at once to the nearest Terrapolice\r\nor Patrol station!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's putting it strongly,\" Dane commented as he relayed the message.\r\n\"Good as giving orders for us to be flamed down at sight--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if we set down in the right spot,\" Rip replied, \"they can't flame\r\nus out without blasting the larger part of Terraport field with us. And I\r\ndon't think they are going to do that in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nDane hoped Shannon was correct in that belief. It would be more chancy\r\nthan landing at the E-Stat or in the Big Burn--to gauge it just right and\r\nput them down on the Terraport apron where they could not be flamed out\r\nwithout destroying too much, where their very position would give them a\r\nbargaining point, was going to be a top star job. If Rip could only pull\r\nit off!\r\n\r\nHe could not evaluate the niceties of that flight, he did not understand\r\nall Rip was doing. But he did know enough to remain quietly in his place,\r\nask no questions, and await results with a dry mouth and a wildly beating\r\nheart. There came a moment when Rip glanced up at him, one hand poised\r\nover the control board. The pilot's voice came tersely, thin and queer:\r\n\r\n\"Pray it out, Dane--here we go!\"\r\n\r\nDane heard the shrill of a riding beam, so tearing he had to move his\r\nearphones. They must be almost on top of the control tower to get it like\r\nthat! Rip was planning on a set down where the Queen would block things\r\nneatly. He brought his own fingers down on the E-E-Red button to give the\r\nlast and most powerful warning. That, to be used only when a ship landing\r\nwas out of control, should clear the ground below. They could only pray\r\nit would vacate the port they were still far from seeing.\r\n\r\n\"Make it a fin-point, Rip,\" he couldn't repress that one bit of advice.\r\nAnd was glad he had given it when he saw a ghost grin tug for a moment at\r\nRip's full lips.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough for a check-ride?\"\r\n\r\nThey were riding her flaming jets down as they would on a strange world.\r\nBelow the port must be wild. Dane counted off the seconds.\r\nTwo--three--four--five--just a few more and they would be too low to\r\nintercept--without endangering innocent coasters and groundhuggers. When\r\nthe last minute during which they were still vulnerable passed, he gave a\r\nsigh of relief. That was one more point on their side. In the earphones\r\nwas a crackle of frantic questions, a gabble of orders screaming at him.\r\nLet them rave, they'd know soon enough what it was all about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE VIDEO\r\n\r\n\r\nOddly enough, in spite of the tension which must have boiled within him,\r\nRip brought them in with a perfect four fin-point landing--one which,\r\nunder the circumstances, must win him the respect of master star-star\r\npilots from the Rim. Though Dane doubted whether if they lost, that skill\r\nwould bring Shannon anything but a long term in the moon mines. The\r\nactual jar of their landing contact was mostly absorbed by the webbing of\r\ntheir shock seats and they were on their feet, ready to move almost at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe next operation had been planned. Dane gave a glance at the screen.\r\nRinged now about the Queen were the buildings of Terraport. Yes, any\r\nattempt to attack the ship would endanger too much of the permanent\r\nstructure of the field itself. Rip had brought them down--not on the\r\nrocket scarred outer landing space--but on the concrete apron between the\r\nAssignment Center and the control tower--a smooth strip usually sacred to\r\nthe parking of officials' ground scooters. He speculated as to whether\r\nany of the latter had been converted to molten metal by the exhausts of\r\nthe Queen's descent.\r\n\r\nLike the team they had come to be the four active members of the crew\r\nwent into action. Ali and Weeks were waiting by an inner hatch, Medic\r\nHovan with them. The Engineer-apprentice was bulky in a space suit, and\r\ntwo more of the unwieldy body coverings waited beside him for Rip and\r\nDane. With fingers which were inclined to act like thumbs they were\r\nsealed into what would provide some protection against any blaster or\r\nsleep ray. Then with Hovan, conspicuously wearing no such armor, they\r\nclimbed into one of the ship's crawlers.\r\n\r\nWeeks activated the outer hatch and the crane lines plucked the small\r\nvehicle out of the Queen, swinging it dizzily down to the blast scored\r\napron.\r\n\r\n\"Make for the tower--\" Rip's voice was thin in the helmet coms.\r\n\r\nDane at the controls of the crawler pulled on as Ali cast off the lines\r\nwhich anchored them to the spacer.\r\n\r\nThrough the bubble helmet he could see the frenzied activity in the\r\naroused port. An ant hill into which some idle investigator had thrust a\r\nstick and given it a turn or two was nothing compared with Terraport\r\nafter the unorthodox arrival of the Solar Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Patrol mobile coming in on southeast vector,\" Ali announced calmly.\r\n\"Looks like she mounts a portable flamer on her nose--\"\r\n\r\n\"So.\" Dane changed direction, putting behind him a customs check point,\r\naware as he ground by that stand, of a line of faces at its vision ports.\r\nEvasive action--and he'd have to get the top speed from the clumsy\r\ncrawler.\r\n\r\n\"Police 'copter over us--\" that was Rip reporting.\r\n\r\nWell, they couldn't very well avoid _that_. But at the same time Dane\r\nwas reasonably sure that its attack would not be an overt one--not with\r\nthe unarmed, unprotected Hovan prominently displayed in their midst.\r\n\r\nBut there he was too sanguine. A muffled exclamation from Rip made him\r\nglance at the Medic beside him. Just in time to see Hovan slump limply\r\nforward, about to tumble from the crawler when Shannon caught him from\r\nbehind. Dane was too familiar with the results of sleep rays to have any\r\ndoubts as to what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe P-copter had sprayed them with its most harmless weapon. Only the\r\nsuits, insulated to the best of their makers' ability against most of the\r\ndangers of space, real and anticipated, had kept the three Traders from\r\nbeing overcome as well. Dane suspected that his own responses were a\r\ntrifle sluggish, that while he had not succumbed to that attack, he had\r\nbeen slowed. But with Rip holding the unconscious Medic in his seat,\r\nThorson continued to head the crawler for the tower and its promise of a\r\nsystem wide hearing for their appeal.\r\n\r\n\"There's a P-mobile coming in ahead--\"\r\n\r\nDane was irritated by that warning from Rip. He had already sighted that\r\nblack and silver ground car himself. And he was only too keenly conscious\r\nof the nasty threat of the snub nosed weapon mounted on its hood, now\r\npointed straight at the oncoming, too deliberate Traders' crawler. Then\r\nhe saw what he believed would be their only chance--to play once more the\r\nsame type of trick as Rip had used to earth them safely.\r\n\r\n\"Get Hovan under cover,\" he ordered. \"I'm going to crash the tower door!\"\r\n\r\nHasty movements answered that as the Medic's limp body was thrust under\r\nthe cover offered by the upper framework of the crawler. Luckily the\r\nmachine had been built for heavy duty on rugged worlds where roadways\r\nwere unknown. Dane was sure he could build up the power and speed\r\nnecessary to take them into the lower floor of the tower--no matter if\r\nits door was now barred against them.\r\n\r\nWhether his audacity daunted the P-mobile, or whether they held off from\r\nan all out attack because of Hovan, Dane could not guess. But he was glad\r\nfor a few minutes of grace as he raced the protesting engine of the heavy\r\nmachine to its last and greatest effort. The treads of the crawler bit on\r\nthe steps leading up to the impressive entrance of the tower. There was a\r\nsecond or two before traction caught and then the driver's heart snapped\r\nback into place as the machine tilted its nose up and headed straight for\r\nthe portal.\r\n\r\nThey struck the closed doors with a shock which almost hurled them from\r\ntheir seats. But that engraved bronze expanse had not been cast to\r\nwithstand a head-on blow from a heavy duty off-world vehicle and the\r\nleaves tore apart letting them into the wide hall beyond.\r\n\r\n\"Take Hovan and make for the riser!\" For the second time it was Dane who\r\ngave the orders. \"I have a blocking job to do here.\" He expected every\r\nsecond to feel the bit of a police blaster somewhere along his shrinking\r\nbody--could even a space suit protect him now?\r\n\r\nAt the far end of the corridor were the attendants and visitors, trapped\r\nin the building, who had fled in an attempt to find safety at the\r\ncrashing entrance of the crawler. These flung themselves flat at the\r\nsteady advance of the two space-suited Traders who supported the\r\nunconscious Medic between them, using the low-powered anti-grav units on\r\ntheir belts to take most of his weight so each had one hand free to hold\r\na sleep rod. And they did not hesitate to use those weapons--spraying the\r\nrightful inhabitants of the tower until all lay unmoving.\r\n\r\nHaving seen that Ali and Rip appeared to have the situation in hand, Dane\r\nturned to his own self-appointed job. He jammed the machine on reverse,\r\nmaneuvering it with an ease learned by practice on the rough terrain of\r\nLimbo, until the gate doors were pushed shut again. Then he swung the\r\nmachine around so that its bulk would afford an effective bar to keep the\r\ndoor locked for some very precious moments to come. Short of using a\r\nflamer full power to cut their way in, no one was going to force an\r\nentrance now.\r\n\r\nHe climbed out of the machine, to discover, when he turned, that the trio\r\nfrom the Queen had disappeared--leaving all possible opposition asleep on\r\nthe floor. Dane clanked on to join them, carrying in plated fingers their\r\nmost important weapon to awake public opinion--an improvised cage in\r\nwhich was housed one of the pests from the cargo hold--the proof of their\r\nplague-free state which they intended Hovan to present, via the telecast,\r\nto the whole system.\r\n\r\nDane reached the shaft of the riser--to find the platform gone. Would\r\neither Rip or Ali have presence of mind enough to send it down to him on\r\nautomatic?\r\n\r\n\"Rip--return the riser,\" he spoke urgently into the throat mike of his\r\nhelmet com.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your rockets straight,\" Ali's cool voice was in his earphones,\r\n\"It's on its way down. Did _you_ remember to bring Exhibit A?\"\r\n\r\nDane did not answer. For he was very much occupied with another problem.\r\nOn the bronze doors he had been at such pains to seal shut there had come\r\ninto being a round circle of dull red which was speedily changing into a\r\ncoruscating incandescence. They _had_ brought a flamer to bear! It would\r\nbe a very short time now before the Police could come through. That\r\nriser--\r\n\r\nAfraid of overbalancing in the bulky suit Dane did not lean forward to\r\nstare up into the shaft. But, as his uncertainty reached a fever pitch,\r\nthe platform descended and he took two steps forward into temporary\r\nsafety, still clutching the cage. At the first try the thick fingers of\r\nhis gloved hand slipped from the lever and he hit it again, harder than\r\nhe intended, so that he found himself being wafted upward with a speed\r\nwhich did not agree with a stomach, even one long accustomed to space\r\nflight. And he almost lost his balance when it came to a stop many floors\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nBut he had not lost his wits. Before he stepped from the platform he set\r\nthe dial on a point which would lift the riser to the top of the shaft\r\nand hold it there. That might trap the Traders on the broadcasting floor,\r\nbut it would also insure them time before the forces of the law could\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\nDane located the rest of his party in the circular core chamber of the\r\nbroadcasting section. He recognized a backdrop he had seen thousands of\r\ntimes behind the announcer who introduced the news-casts. In one corner\r\nRip, his suit off, was working over the still relaxed form of the Medic.\r\nWhile Ali, a grim set to his mouth, was standing with a man who wore the\r\ninsignia of a Com-tech.\r\n\r\n\"All set?\" Rip looked up from his futile ministrations.\r\n\r\nDane put down the cage and began the business of unhooking his own\r\nprotective covering. \"They were burning through the outer doors of the\r\nentrance hall when I took off.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to get away with this--\" that was the Com-tech.\r\n\r\nAli smiled wearily, a stretch of lips in which there was little or no\r\nmirth. \"Listen, my friend. Since I started to ride rockets I've been told\r\nI wasn't going to get away with this or that. Why not be more original?\r\nUse what is between those outsize ears of yours. We fought our way in\r\nhere--we landed at Terraport against orders--we're Patrol Posted. Do you\r\nthink that one man, one lone man, is going to keep us now from doing what\r\nwe came to do? And don't look around for any reinforcements. We sprayed\r\nboth those rooms. You can run the emergency hook-up singlehanded and\r\nyou're going to. We're Free Traders--Ha,\" the man had lost some of his\r\nassurance as he stared from one drawn young face to another, \"I see you\r\nbegin to realize what that means. Out on the Rim we play rough, and we\r\nplay for keeps. I know half a hundred ways to set you screaming in three\r\nminutes and at least ten of them will not even leave a mark on your skin!\r\nNow do we get Service--or don't we?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll go to the Chamber for this--!\" snarled the tech.\r\n\r\n\"All right. But first we broadcast. Then maybe someday a ship that's run\r\ninto bad luck'll have a straighter deal than we've had. You get on your\r\npost. And we'll have the play back on--remember that. If you don't give\r\nus a clear channel we'll know it. How about it, Rip--how's Hovan?\"\r\n\r\nRip's face was a mask of worry. \"He must have had a full dose. I can't\r\nbring him around.\"\r\n\r\nWas this the end of their bold bid? Let each or all of them go before the\r\nscreen to plead their case, let them show the caged pest. But without the\r\nprofessional testimony of the Medic, the weight of an expert opinion on\r\ntheir side, they were licked. Well, sometimes luck did not ride a man's\r\nfins all the way in.\r\n\r\nBut some stubborn core within Dane refused to let him believe that they\r\nhad lost. He went over to the Medic huddled in a chair. To all\r\nappearances Hovan was deeply asleep, sunk in the semi-coma the sleep ray\r\nproduced. And the frustrating thing was that the man himself could have\r\nsupplied the counter to his condition, given them the instructions how to\r\nbring him around. How many hours away was a natural awaking? Long before\r\nthat their hold on the station would be broken--they would be in the\r\ncustody of either Police or Patrol.\r\n\r\n\"He's sunk--\" Dane voiced the belief which put an end to their hopes. But\r\nAli did not seem concerned.\r\n\r\nKamil was standing with their captive, an odd expression on his handsome\r\nface as if he were striving to recall some dim memory. When he spoke it\r\nwas to the Com-tech. \"You have an HD OS here?\"\r\n\r\nThe other registered surprise. \"I think so--\"\r\n\r\nAli made an abrupt gesture. \"Make sure,\" he ordered, following the man\r\ninto another room. Dane looked to Rip for enlightenment.\r\n\r\n\"What in the Great Nebula is an HD OS?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm no engineer. It may be some gadget to get us out of here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Such as a pair of wings?\" Dane was inclined to be sarcastic. The memory\r\nof that incandescent circle on the door some twenty floors below stayed\r\nwith him. Tempers of Police and Patrol were not going to be improved by\r\nfighting their way around or over the obstacles the Traders had arranged\r\nto delay them. If they caught up to the outlaws before the latter had\r\ntheir chance for an impartial hearing, the result was not going to be a\r\nhappy one as far as the Queen's men were concerned.\r\n\r\nAli appeared in the doorway. \"Bring Hovan in here.\" Together Rip and Dane\r\ncarried the Medic into a smaller chamber where they found Ali and the\r\ntech busy lashing a small, lightweight tube chair to a machine which, to\r\ntheir untutored eyes, had the semblance of a collection of bars. Obeying\r\ninstructions they seated Hovan in that chair, fastening him in, while the\r\nMedic continued to slumber peacefully. Uncomprehendingly Rip and Dane\r\nstepped back while, under Ali's watchful eye, the Com-tech made\r\nadjustments and finally snapped some hidden switch.\r\n\r\nDane discovered that he dared not watch too closely what followed. Inured\r\nas he thought he was to the tricks of Hyperspace, to acceleration and\r\nanti-gravity, the oscillation of that swinging seat, the weird swaying of\r\nthe half-recumbent figure, did things to his sight and to his sense of\r\nbalance which seemed perilous in the extreme. But when the groan broke\r\nthrough the hum of Ali's mysterious machine, all of them knew that the\r\nEngineer-apprentice had found the answer to their problem, that Hovan was\r\nwaking.\r\n\r\nThe Medic was bleary-eyed and inclined to stagger when they freed him.\r\nAnd for several minutes he seemed unable to grasp either his surroundings\r\nor the train of events which had brought him there.\r\n\r\nLong since the Police must have broken into the entrance corridor below.\r\nPerhaps they had by now secured a riser which would bring them up. Ali\r\nhad forced the Com-tech to throw the emergency control which was designed\r\nto seal off from the outer world the entire unit in which they now were.\r\nBut whether that protective device would continue to hold now, none of\r\nthe three were certain. Time was running out fast.\r\n\r\nSupporting the wobbling Hovan, they went back into the panel room and\r\nunder Ali's supervision the Com-tech took his place at the control board.\r\nDane put the cage with the pest well to the fore on the table of the\r\nannouncer and waited for Rip to take his place there with the trembling\r\nMedic. When Shannon did not move Dane glanced up in surprise--this was no\r\ntime to hesitate. But he discovered that the attention of both his\r\nshipmates was now centered on him. Rip pointed to the seat.\r\n\r\n\"You're the talk merchant, aren't you?\" the acting commander of the Queen\r\nasked crisply. \"Now's the time to shout the Lingo--\"\r\n\r\nThey couldn't mean--! But it was very evident that they did. Of course,\r\na Cargo-master was supposed to be the spokesman of a ship. But that was\r\nin matters of trade. And how could _he_ stand there and argue the case\r\nfor the Queen? He was the newest joined, the greenest member of her crew.\r\nAlready his mouth was dry and his nerves tense. But Dane didn't know that\r\nnone of that was revealed by his face or manner. The usual impassiveness\r\nwhich had masked his inner conflicts since his first days at the Pool\r\nserved him now. And the others never noted the hesitation with which he\r\napproached the announcer's place.\r\n\r\nDane had scarcely seated himself, one hand resting on the cage of the\r\npest, before Ali brought down two fingers in the sharp sweep which\r\nsignaled the Com-tech to duty. Far above them there was a whisper of\r\nsound which signified the opening of the play-back. They would be able to\r\ncheck on whether the broadcast was going out or not. Although Dane could\r\nsee nothing of the system wide audience which he currently faced, he\r\nrealized that the room and those in it were now visible on every tuned-in\r\nvideo set. Instead of the factual cast, the listeners were about to be\r\ntreated to a melodrama which was as wild as their favorite romances. It\r\nonly needed the break-in of the Patrol to complete the illusion of\r\naction-fiction--crime variety.\r\n\r\nA second finger moved in his direction and Dane leaned forward. He faced\r\nonly the folds of a wall wide curtain, but he must keep in mind that in\r\ntruth there was a sea of faces before him, the faces of those whom he and\r\nHovan, working together, must convince if he were to save the Queen and\r\nher crew.\r\n\r\nHe found his voice and it was steady and even, he might have been\r\noutlining some stowage problem for Van Rycke's approval.\r\n\r\n\"People of Terra--\"\r\n\r\nMartian, Venusian, Asteroid colonist--inwardly they were still all Terran\r\nand on that point he would rest. He was a Terran appealing to his own\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"People of Terra, we come before you to ask justice--\" from somewhere the\r\nwords came easily, flowing from his lips to center on a patch of light\r\nahead. And that \"justice\" rang with a kind of reassurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nIN CUSTODY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To those of you who do not travel the star trails our case may seem\r\npuzzling--\" the words were coming easily. Dane gathered confidence as he\r\nspoke, intent on making those others out there know what it meant to be\r\noutlawed.\r\n\r\n\"We are Patrol Posted, outlawed as a plague ship,\" he confessed frankly.\r\n\"But this is our true story--\"\r\n\r\nSwiftly, with a flow of language he had not known he could command, Dane\r\nswung into the story of Sargol, of the pest they had carried away from\r\nthat world. And at the proper moment he thrust a gloved hand into the\r\ncage and brought out the wriggling thing which struck vainly with its\r\npoisoned talons, holding it above the dark table so that those unseen\r\nwatchers could witness the dramatic change of color which made it such a\r\nmenace. Dane continued the story of the Queen's ill-fated voyage--of\r\ntheir forced descent upon the E-Stat.\r\n\r\n\"Ask the truth of Inter-Solar,\" he demanded of the audience beyond those\r\nwalls. \"We were no pirates. They will discover in their records the\r\nvouchers we left.\" Then Dane described the weird hunt when, led by the\r\nHoobat, they had finally found and isolated the menace, and their landing\r\nin the heart of the Big Burn. He followed that with his own quest for\r\nmedical aid, the kidnapping of Hovan. At that point he turned to the\r\nMedic.\r\n\r\n\"This is Medic Hovan. He has consented to appear in our behalf and to\r\ntestify to the truth--that the Solar Queen has not been stricken by some\r\nunknown plague, but infested with a living organism we now have under\r\ncontrol--\" For a suspenseful second or two he wondered if Hovan was going\r\nto make it. The man looked shaken and sick, as if the drastic awaking\r\nthey had subjected him to had left him too dazed to pull himself\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nBut out of some hidden reservoir of strength the Medic summoned the\r\nenergy he needed. And his testimony was all they had hoped it would be.\r\nThough now and then he strayed into technical terms. But, Dane thought,\r\ntheir use only enhanced the authority of his description of what he had\r\ndiscovered on board the spacer and what he had done to counteract the\r\npower of the poison. When he had done Dane added a few last words.\r\n\r\n\"We have broken the law,\" he admitted forthrightly, \"but we were fighting\r\nin self-defense. All we ask now is the privilege of an impartial\r\ninvestigation, a chance to defend ourselves--such as any of you take for\r\ngranted on Terra--before the courts of this planet--\" But he was not to\r\nfinish without interruption.\r\n\r\nFrom the play-back over their heads another voice blared, breaking across\r\nhis last words:\r\n\r\n\"Surrender! This is the Patrol. Surrender or take the consequences!\" And\r\nthat faint sighing which signaled their open contact with the outer world\r\nwas cut off. The Com-tech turned away from the control board, a sneering\r\nhalf smile on his face.\r\n\r\n\"They've reached the circuit and cut you off. You're done!\"\r\n\r\nDane stared into the cage where the now almost invisible thing sat humped\r\ntogether. He had done his best--they had all done their best. He felt\r\nnothing but a vast fatigue, an overwhelming weariness, not so much of\r\nbody, but of nerve and spirit too.\r\n\r\nRip broke the silence with a question aimed at the tech. \"Can you signal\r\nbelow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to give up?\" The fellow brightened. \"Yes, there's an inter-com I\r\ncan cut in.\"\r\n\r\nRip stood up. He unbuckled the belt about his waist and laid it on the\r\ntable--disarming himself. Without words Ali and Dane followed his\r\nexample. They had played their hand--to prolong the struggle would mean\r\nnothing. The acting Captain of the Queen gave a last order:\r\n\r\n\"Tell them we are coming down unarmed--to surrender.\" He paused in front\r\nof Hovan. \"You'd better stay here. If there's any trouble--no reason for\r\nyou to be caught in the middle.\"\r\n\r\nHovan nodded as the three left the room. Dane, remembering the trick he\r\nhad pulled with the riser, made a comment:\r\n\r\n\"We may be marooned here--\"\r\n\r\nAli shrugged. \"Then we can just wait and let them collect us.\" He yawned,\r\nhis dark eyes set in smudges. \"I don't care if they'll just let us sleep\r\nthe clock around afterwards. D'you really think,\" he addressed Rip, \"that\r\nwe've done ourselves any good?\"\r\n\r\nRip neither denied nor confirmed. \"We took our only chance. Now it's up\r\nto them--\" He pointed to the wall and the teeming world which lay beyond\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAli grinned wryly. \"I note you left the what-you-call-it with Hovan.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wanted one to experiment with,\" Dane replied. \"I thought he'd earned\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now here comes what we've earned--\" Rip cut in as the hum of the\r\nriser came to their ears.\r\n\r\n\"Should we take to cover?\" Ali's mobile eyebrows underlined his demand.\r\n\"The forces of law and order may erupt with blasters blazing.\"\r\n\r\nBut Rip did not move. He faced the riser door squarely and, drawn by\r\nsomething in that stance of his, the other two stepped in on either side\r\nso that they fronted the dubious future as a united group. Whatever came\r\nnow, the Queen's men would meet it together.\r\n\r\nIn a way Ali was right. The four men who emerged all had their blasters\r\nor riot stun-rifles at ready, and the sights of those weapons were\r\ntrained at the middles of the Free Traders. As Dane's empty hands, palm\r\nout, went up on a line with his shoulders, he estimated the opposition.\r\nTwo were in the silver and black of the Patrol, two wore the forest green\r\nof the Terrapolice. But they all looked like men with whom it was better\r\nnot to play games.\r\n\r\nAnd it was clear they were prepared to take no chances with the outlaws.\r\nIn spite of the passiveness of the Queen's men, their hands were locked\r\nbehind them with force bars about their wrists. When a quick search\r\nrevealed that the three were unarmed, they were herded onto the riser by\r\ntwo of their captors, while the other pair remained behind, presumably to\r\nuncover any damage they had done to the Tower installations.\r\n\r\nThe police did not speak except for a few terse words among themselves\r\nand a barked order to march, delivered to the prisoners. Very shortly\r\nthey were in the entrance hall facing the wreckage of the crawler and\r\ndoors through which a ragged gap had been burned. Ali viewed the scene\r\nwith his usual detachment.\r\n\r\n\"Nice job,\" he commended Dane's enterprise. \"They'll have a moving--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get going!\" A heavy hand between his shoulder blades urged him on.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer-apprentice whirled, his eyes blazing. \"Keep your hands to\r\nyourself! We aren't mine fodder yet. I think that the little matter of a\r\ntrial comes first--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're Posted,\" the Patrolman was openly contemptuous.\r\n\r\nDane was chilled. For the first time that aspect of their predicament\r\nreally registered. Posted outlaws might, within reason, be shot on sight\r\nwithout further recourse to the law. If that label stuck on the crew of\r\nthe Queen, they had practically no chance at all. And when he saw that\r\nAli was no longer inclined to retort, he knew that fact had dawned upon\r\nKamil also. It would all depend upon how big an impression their\r\nbroadcast had made. If public opinion veered to their side--then they\r\ncould defend themselves legally. Otherwise the moon mines might be the\r\nbest sentence they dare hope for.\r\n\r\nThey were pushed out into the brilliant sunlight. There stood the Queen,\r\nher meteor scarred side reflecting the light of her native sun. And\r\nringed around her at a safe distance was what seemed to be a small\r\nmechanized army corps. The authorities were making very sure that no more\r\nrebels would burst from her interior.\r\n\r\nDane thought that they would be loaded into a mobile or 'copter and taken\r\naway. But instead they were marched down, through the ranks of portable\r\nflamers, scramblers, and other equipment, to an open space where anyone\r\non duty at the visa-screen within the control cabin of the spacer could\r\nsee them. An officer of the Patrol, the sun making an eye-blinding flash\r\nof his lightning sword breast badge, stood behind a loud speaker. When\r\nhe perceived that the three prisoners were present, he picked up a hand\r\nmike and spoke into it--his voice so being relayed over the field as\r\nclearly as it must be reaching Weeks inside the sealed freighter.\r\n\r\n\"You have five minutes to open hatch. Your men have been taken. Five\r\nminutes to open hatch and surrender.\"\r\n\r\nAli chuckled. \"And how does he think he's going to enforce that?\" he\r\ninquired of the air and incidentally of the guards now forming a square\r\nabout the three. \"He'll need more than a flamer to unlatch the old girl\r\nif she doesn't care for his offer.\"\r\n\r\nPrivately Dane agreed with that. He hoped that Weeks would decide to hold\r\nout--at least until they had a better idea of what the future would be.\r\nNo tool or weapon he saw in the assembly about them was forceful enough\r\nto penetrate the shell of the Queen. And there were sufficient supplies\r\non board to keep Weeks and his charges going for at least a week. Since\r\nTau had shown signs of coming out of his coma, it might even be that the\r\ncrew of the ship would arouse to their own defense in that time. It all\r\ndepended upon Weeks' present decision.\r\n\r\nNo hatch yawned in the ship's sleek sides. She might have been an inert\r\nderelict for all response to that demand. Dane's confidence began to\r\nrise. Weeks had picked up the challenge, he would continue to baffle\r\npolice and Patrol.\r\n\r\nJust how long that stalemate would have lasted they were not to know for\r\nanother player came on the board. Through the lines of besiegers Hovan,\r\nescorted by the Patrolmen, made his way up to the officer at the mike\r\nstation. There was something in his air which suggested that he was about\r\nto give battle. And the conversation at the mike was relayed across the\r\nfield, a fact of which they were not at once aware.\r\n\r\n\"There are sick men in there--\" Hovan's voice boomed out. \"I demand the\r\nright to return to duty--\"\r\n\r\n\"If and when they surrender they shall all be accorded necessary aid,\"\r\nthat was the officer. But he made no impression on the Medic from the\r\nfrontier. Dane, by chance, had chosen better support than he had guessed.\r\n\r\n\"Pro Bono Publico--\" Hovan invoked the battle cry of his own Service.\r\n\"For the Public Good--\"\r\n\r\n\"A plague ship--\" the officer was beginning. Hovan waved that aside\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" His voice scaled up across the field. \"There is no plague\r\naboard. I am willing to certify that before the Council. And if you\r\nrefuse these men medical attention--which they need--I shall cite the\r\ncase all the way to my Board!\"\r\n\r\nDane drew a deep breath. That _was_ taking off on their orbit! Not being\r\none of the Queen's crew, in fact having good reason to be angry over his\r\ntreatment at their hands, Hovan's present attitude would or should carry\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe Patrol officer who was not yet ready to concede all points had an\r\nanswer: \"If you are able to get on board--go.\"\r\n\r\nHovan snatched the mike from the astonished officer. \"Weeks!\" His voice\r\nwas imperative. \"I'm coming aboard--alone!\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were on the ship and for a short period it would seem that Weeks\r\ndid not trust the Medic. Then, high in her needle nose, one of the escape\r\nports, not intended for use except in dire emergency opened and allowed a\r\nplastic link ladder to fall link by link.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of his eye Dane caught a flash of movement to his left.\r\nManacled as he was he threw himself on the policeman who was aiming a\r\nstun rifle into the port. His shoulder struck the fellow waist high and\r\nhis weight carried them both with a bruising crash to the concrete\r\npavement as Rip shouted and hands clutched roughly at the now helpless\r\nCargo-apprentice.\r\n\r\nHe was pulled to his feet, tasting the flat sweetness of blood where a\r\nflailing blow from the surprised and frightened policeman had cut his lip\r\nagainst his teeth. He spat red and glowered at the ring of angry men.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you kick him?\" Ali inquired, a vast and blistering contempt\r\nsawtoothing his voice. \"He's got his hands cuffed so he's fair game--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's going on here?\" An officer broke through the ring. The policeman,\r\non his feet once more, snatched up the rifle Dane's attack had knocked\r\nout of his hold.\r\n\r\n\"Your boy here,\" Ali was ready with an answer, \"tried to find a target\r\ninside the hatch. Is this the usual way you conduct a truce, sir?\"\r\n\r\nHe was answered by a glare and the rifleman was abruptly ordered to the\r\nrear. Dane, his head clearing, looked at the Queen. Hovan was climbing\r\nthe ladder--he was within arm's length of that half open hatch. The very\r\nfact that the Medic had managed to make his point stick was, in a faint\r\nway, encouraging. But the three were not allowed to enjoy that small\r\nvictory for long. They were marched from the field, loaded into a mobile\r\nand taken to the city several miles away. It was the Patrol who held them\r\nin custody--not the Terrapolice. Dane was not sure whether that was to be\r\nreckoned favorable or not. As a Free Trader he had a grudging respect for\r\nthe organization he had seen in action on Limbo.\r\n\r\nSometime later they found themselves, freed of the force bars, alone in a\r\nroom which, bare walled as it was, did have a bench on which all three\r\nsank thankfully. Dane caught the warning gesture from Ali--they were\r\nunder unseen observation and they must have a listening audience\r\ntoo--located somewhere in the maze of offices.\r\n\r\n\"They can't make up their minds,\" the Engineer-apprentice settled his\r\nshoulders against the wall. \"Either we're desperate criminals, or we're\r\nheroes. They're going to let time decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we're heroes,\" Dane asked a little querulously, \"what are we doing\r\nlocked up here? I'd like a few earth-side comforts--beginning with a full\r\nmeal--\"\r\n\r\n\"No thumb printing, no psycho testing,\" Rip mused. \"Yes, they haven't put\r\nus through the system yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we decidedly aren't the forgotten men. Wipe your face, child,\" Ali\r\nsaid to Dane, \"you're still dribbling.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cargo-apprentice smeared his hand across his chin and brought it away\r\nred and sticky. Luckily his teeth remained intact.\r\n\r\n\"We need Hovan to read them more law,\" observed Kamil. \"You should have\r\nmedical attention.\"\r\n\r\nDane dabbed at his mouth. He didn't need all that solicitude, but he\r\nguessed that Ali was talking for the benefit of those who now kept them\r\nunder surveillance.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of Hovan--I wonder what became of that pest he was supposed to\r\nhave under control. He didn't bring the cage with him when he came out of\r\nthe Tower, did he?\" asked Rip.\r\n\r\n\"If it gets loose in that building,\" Dane decided to give the powers who\r\nheld them in custody something to think about, \"they'll have trouble.\r\nPractically invisible and poisonous. And maybe it can reproduce its kind,\r\ntoo. We don't know anything about it--\"\r\n\r\nAli laughed. \"Such fun and games! Imagine a hundred of the dear creatures\r\nflitting in and out of the broadcasting section. And Captain Jellico has\r\nthe only Hoobat on Terra! He can name his own terms for rounding up the\r\nplague. The whole place will be filled with sleepers before they're\r\nthrough--\"\r\n\r\nWould that scrap of information send some Patrolmen hurtling off to the\r\nTower in search of the caged creature? The thought of such an expedition\r\nwas, in a small way, comforting to the captives.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so later they were fed, noiselessly and without visible\r\nattendants, when three trays slid through a slit in the wall at floor\r\nlevel. Rip's nose wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\"Now I get the vector! We're plague-ridden--keep aloof and watch to see\r\nif we break out in purple spots!\"\r\n\r\nAli was lifting thermo lids from the containers and now he suddenly arose\r\nand bowed in the direction of the blank wall. \"Many, many thanks,\" he\r\nintoned. \"Nothing but the best--a sub-commander's rations at least! We\r\nshall deliver top star rating to this thoughtfulness when we are\r\nquestioned by the powers that shine.\"\r\n\r\nIt _was_ good food. Dane ate cautiously because of his torn lip, but the\r\nwhole adventure took on a more rose-colored hue. The lapse of time before\r\nthey were put through the usual procedure followed with criminals, this\r\nexcellent dinner--it was all promising. The Patrol could not yet be sure\r\nhow they were to be handled.\r\n\r\n\"They've fed us,\" Ali observed as he clanged the last dish back on a\r\ntray. \"Now you'd think they'd bed us. I could do with several days--and\r\nnights--of bunk time right about now.\"\r\n\r\nBut that hint was not taken up and they continued to sit on the bench as\r\ntime limped by. According to Dane's watch it must be night now, though\r\nthe steady light in the windowless room did not vary. What had Hovan\r\ndiscovered in the Queen? Had he been able to rouse any of the crew? And\r\nwas the spacer still inviolate, or had the Terrapolice and the Patrol\r\nmanaged to take her over?\r\n\r\nHe was so very tired, his eyes felt as if hot sand had been poured\r\nbeneath the lids, his body ached. And at last he nodded into naps from\r\nwhich he awoke with jerks of the neck. Rip was frankly asleep, his\r\nshoulders and head resting against the wall, while Ali lounged with\r\nclosed eyes. Though the Cargo-apprentice was sure that Kamil was more\r\nalert than his comrades, as if he waited for something he thought was\r\nsoon to occur.\r\n\r\nDane dreamed. Once more he trod the reef rising out of Sargol's shallow\r\nsea. But he held no weapon and beneath the surface of the water a gorp\r\nlurked. When he reached the break in the water-washed rock just ahead,\r\nthe spidery horror would strike and against its attack he was\r\ndefenseless. Yet he must march on for he had no control over his own\r\nactions!\r\n\r\n\"Wake up!\" Ali's hand was on his shoulder, shaking him back and forth\r\nwith something close to gentleness. \"Must you give an imitation of a\r\nspace-whirly moonbat?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gorp--\" Dane came back to the present and flushed. He dreaded\r\nadmitting to a nightmare--especially to Ali whose poise he had always\r\nfound disconcerting.\r\n\r\n\"No gorps here. Nothing but--\"\r\n\r\nKamil's words were lost in the escape of metal against metal as a panel\r\nslid back in the wall. But no guard wearing the black and silver of the\r\nPatrol stepped through to summon them to trial. Van Rycke stood in the\r\nopening, half smiling at them with his customary sleepy benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, and here's our missing ones,\" his purring voice was the most\r\nbeautiful sound Dane thought he had ever heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nBARGAIN CONCLUDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\"--and so we landed here, sir,\" Rip concluded his report in the\r\nmatter-of-fact tone he might have used in describing a perfectly ordinary\r\nvoyage, say between Terraport and Luna City, a run of no incident and\r\ndull cargo carrying.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the Solar Queen, save for Tau, were assembled in a room\r\nsomewhere in the vastness of Patrol Headquarters. Since the room seemed a\r\ncomfortable conference chamber, Dane thought that their status must now\r\nbe on a higher level than that of Patrol Posted outlaws. But he was also\r\nsure that if they attempted to walk out of the building that effort would\r\nnot be successful.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke sat stolidly in his chosen seat, fingers of both hands laced\r\nacross his substantial middle. He had sat as impassively as the Captain\r\nwhile Rip had outlined their adventures since they had all been stricken.\r\nThough the other listeners had betrayed interest in the story, the senior\r\nofficers made no comments. Now Jellico turned to his Cargo-master.\r\n\r\n\"How about it, Van?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's done is done--\"\r\n\r\nDane's elation vanished as if ripped away by a Sargolian storm wind. The\r\nCargo-master didn't approve. So there must have been another way to\r\nachieve their ends--one the younger members of the crew had been too\r\ninexperienced or too dense to see--\r\n\r\n\"If we blasted off today we might just make cargo contract.\"\r\n\r\nDane started. That was it! The point they had lost sight of during their\r\nstruggles to get aid. There was no possible chance of upping the ship\r\ntoday--probably not for days to come--or ever, if the case went against\r\nthem. So they had broken contract--and the Board would be down on them\r\nfor that. Dane shivered inside. He could try to fight back against the\r\nPatrol--there had always been a slight feeling of rivalry between the\r\nFree Traders and the space police. But you couldn't buck the Board--and\r\nkeep your license and so have a means of staying in space. A broken\r\ncontract could cut one off from the stars forever. Captain Jellico looked\r\nvery bleak at that reminder.\r\n\r\n\"The Eysies will be all ready to step in. I'd like to know why they were\r\nso sure we had the plague on board--\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke snorted. \"I can supply you five answers to that--for one they\r\nmay have known the affinity of those creatures for the wood, and it would\r\nbe easy to predict as a result of our taking a load on board--or again\r\nthey may have deliberately planted the things on us through the\r\nSalariki--But we can't ever prove it. It remains that they are going to\r\nget for themselves the Sargolian contract unless--\" He stopped short,\r\nstaring straight ahead of him at the wall between Rip and Dane. And his\r\nassistant knew that Van was exploring a fresh idea. Van's ideas were\r\nnever to be despised and Jellico did not now disturb the Cargo-master\r\nwith questions.\r\n\r\nIt was Rip who spoke next and directly to the Captain. \"Do you know what\r\nthey plan to do about us, sir?\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Jellico grunted and there was a sardonic twist to his mouth as\r\nhe replied, \"It's my opinion that they're now busy adding up the list of\r\ncrimes you four have committed--maybe they had to turn the big HG\r\ncomputer loose on the problem. The tally isn't in yet. We gave them our\r\nautomat flight record and that ought to give them more food for thought.\"\r\n\r\nDane speculated as to what the experts _would_ make of the mechanical\r\nrecord of the Queen's past few weeks--the section dealing with their\r\nlanding in the Big Burn ought to be a little surprising. Van Rycke got to\r\nhis feet and marched to the door of the conference room. It was opened\r\nfrom without so quickly Dane was sure that they had been under constant\r\nsurveillance.\r\n\r\n\"Trade business,\" snapped the Cargo-master, \"contract deal. Take me to a\r\nsealed com booth!\"\r\n\r\nContracts might not be as sacred to the protective Service as they were\r\nto Trade, but Trade had its powers and since Van Rycke, an innocent\r\nbystander of the Queen's troubles, could not legally be charged with any\r\ncrime, he was escorted out of the room. But the door panel was sealed\r\nbehind him, shutting in the rest with the unspoken warning that they were\r\nnot free agents. Jellico leaned back in his chair and stretched. Long\r\nyears of close friendship had taught him that his Cargo-master was to be\r\ntrusted with not only the actual trading and cargo tending, but could\r\nalso think them out of some of the tangles which could not be solved by\r\nhis own direct action methods. Direct action had been applied to their\r\npresent problem--now the rest was up to Van, and he was willing to\r\ndelegate all responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut they were not left long to themselves. The door opened once more to\r\nadmit star rank Patrolmen. None of the Free Traders arose. As members of\r\nanother Service they considered themselves equals. And it was their\r\nprivate boast that the interests of Galactic civilization, as\r\nrepresented by the black and silver, often followed, not preceded the\r\nbrown tunics into new quarters of the universe.\r\n\r\nHowever, Rip, Ali, Dane, and Weeks answered as fully as they could the\r\nflood of questions which engulfed them. They explained in detail their\r\nvisit to the E-Stat, the landing in the Big Burn, the kidnapping of Hovan.\r\nDane's stubborn feeling of being in the right grew in opposition to the\r\nquestioning. Under the same set of circumstances how would that\r\nCommander--that Wing Officer--that Senior Scout--now all seated\r\nthere--have acted? And every time they inferred that his part in the\r\naffair had been illegal he stiffened.\r\n\r\nSure, there had to be law and order out on the Rim--and doubly sure it\r\nhad to cover and protect life on the softer planets of the inner systems.\r\nHe wasn't denying that on Limbo, he, for one, had been very glad to see\r\nthe Patrol blast their way into the headquarters of the pirates holed up\r\non that half-dead world. And he was never contemptuous of the men in the\r\nfield. But like all Free Traders he was influenced by a belief that too\r\noften the laws as enforced by the Patrol favored the wealth and might of\r\nthe Companies, that law could be twisted and the Patrol sent to push\r\nthrough actions which, though legal, were inherently unfair to those who\r\nhad not the funds to fight it out in the far off Council courts. Just as\r\nnow he was certain that the Eysies were bringing all the influence they\r\nhad to bear here against the Queen's men. And Inter-Solar had a lot of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of their ordeal their statements were read back to them from\r\nthe recording tape and they thumb signed them. Were these statements or\r\nconfessions, Dane mused. Perhaps in their honest reports they had just\r\nsigned their way into the moon mines. Only there was no move to lead them\r\nout and book them. And when Weeks pressed his thumb at the bottom of the\r\ntape, Captain Jellico took a hand. He looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"It is now ten hours,\" he observed. \"My men need rest, and we all want\r\nfood. Are you through with us?\"\r\n\r\nThe Commander was spokesman for the other group. \"You are to remain in\r\nquarantine, Captain. Your ship has not yet been passed as port-free. But\r\nyou will be assigned quarters--\"\r\n\r\nOnce again they were marched through blank halls to the other section of\r\nthe sprawling Patrol Headquarters. No windows looked upon the outer\r\nworld, but there were bunks and a small mess alcove. Ali, Dane, and Rip\r\nturned in, more interested in sleep than food. And the last thing the\r\nCargo-apprentice remembered was seeing Jellico talking earnestly with\r\nSteen Wilcox as they both sipped steaming mugs of real Terran coffee.\r\n\r\nBut with twelve hours of sleep behind them the three were less contented\r\nin confinement. No one had come near them and Van Rycke had not returned.\r\nWhich fact the crew clung to as a ray of hope. Somewhere the Cargo-master\r\nmust be fighting their battle. And all Van's vast store of Trade\r\nknowledge, all his knack of cutting corners and driving a shrewd bargain,\r\nenlisted on their behalf, must win them some concessions.\r\n\r\nMedic Tau came in, bringing Hovan with him. Both looked tired but\r\ntriumphant. And their report was a shot in the arm for the now uneasy\r\nTraders.\r\n\r\n\"We've rammed it down their throats,\" Tau announced. \"They're willing to\r\nadmit that it was those poison bugs and not a plague. Incidentally,\" he\r\ngrinned at Jellico and then looked around expectantly, \"where's Van? This\r\ncomes in his department. We're going to cash in on those the kids dumped\r\nin the deep freeze. Terra-Lab is bidding on them. I said to see Van--he\r\ncan arrange the best deal for us. Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone to see about our contract,\" Jellico reported. \"What's the news\r\nabout our status now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they've got to wipe out the plague ship listing. Also--we're big\r\nnews. There're about twenty video men rocketing around out in the offices\r\ntrying to get in and have us do some spot broadcasts. Seems that the\r\nchildren here,\" he jerked his thumb at the three apprentices, \"started\r\nsomething. An inter-solar invasion couldn't be bigger news! Human\r\ninterest by the tankful. I've been on Video twice and they're trying to\r\nsign up Hovan almost steady--\"\r\n\r\nThe Medic from the frontier nodded. \"Wanted me to appear on a three week\r\nschedule,\" he chuckled. \"I was asked to come in on 'Our Heroes of the\r\nStarlines' and two Quiz programs. As for you, you young criminal,\" he\r\nswung to Dane, \"you're going to be fair game for about three networks. It\r\nseems you transmit well,\" he uttered the last as if it were an accusation\r\nand Dane squirmed. \"Anyway you did something with your crazy stunt. And,\r\nCaptain, three men want to buy your Hoobat. I gather they are planning a\r\nshowing of how it captures those pests. So be prepared--\"\r\n\r\nDane tried to visualize a scene in which he shared top billing with Queex\r\nand shuddered. All he wanted now was to get free of Terra for a nice,\r\nquiet, uncomplicated world where problems could be settled with a sleep\r\nrod or a blaster and the Video screen was unknown.\r\n\r\nHaving heard of what awaited them without, the men of the Queen were more\r\ncontent to be incarcerated in the quarantine section. But as time wore on\r\nand the Cargo-master did not return, their anxieties awoke. They were\r\nfairly sure by now that any penalty the Patrol or the Terrapolice would\r\nimpose would not be too drastic. But a broken contract was another and\r\nmore serious affair--a matter which might ground them more effectively\r\nthan any rule of the law enforcement bodies. And Jellico took to pacing\r\nthe room, while Tang and Wilcox who had started a game of four\r\ndimensional chess made countless errors of move, and Stotz glared moodily\r\nat the wall, apparently too sunk in his own gloomy thoughts to rise from\r\nthe mess table in the alcove.\r\n\r\nThough time had ceased to have much meaning for them except as an\r\nirritating reminder of the now sure failure of their Sargolian venture,\r\nthey marked the hours into a second full day of detention before Van\r\nRycke finally put in appearance. The Cargo-master was plainly tired, but\r\nhe showed no signs of discomposure. In fact as he came in he was humming\r\nwhat he fondly imagined was a popular tune.\r\n\r\nJellico asked no questions, he merely regarded his trusted officer with a\r\nquizzically raised eyebrow. But the others drew around. It was so\r\napparent that Van Rycke was pleased with himself. Which could only mean\r\nthat in some fantastic way he had managed to bring their venture down in\r\na full fin landing, that somehow he had argued the Queen out of danger\r\ninto a position where he could control the situation.\r\n\r\nHe halted just within the doorway and eyed Dane, Ali, and Rip with mock\r\nseverity. \"You're baaaad boys,\" he told them with a shake of the head and\r\na drawl of the adjective. \"You've been demoted ten files each on the\r\nlist.\"\r\n\r\nWhich must put him on the bottom rung once more, Dane calculated swiftly.\r\nOr even below--though he didn't see how he could fall beneath the rank he\r\nheld at assignment. However, he found the news heartening instead of\r\ndiscouraging. Compared to a bleak sentence at the moon mines such\r\ndemotion was absolutely nothing and he knew that Van Rycke was breaking\r\nthe worst news first.\r\n\r\n\"You also forfeit all pay for this voyage,\" the Cargo-master was\r\ncontinuing. But Jellico broke in.\r\n\r\n\"Board fine?\"\r\n\r\nAt the Cargo-master's nod, Jellico added. \"Ship pays that.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I told them,\" Van Rycke agreed. \"The Queen's warned off Terra for ten\r\nsolar years--\"\r\n\r\nThey could take that, too. Other Free Traders got back to their home\r\nports perhaps once in a quarter century. It was so much less than they\r\nhad expected that the sentence was greeted with a concentrated sigh of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n\"No earth-side leave--\"\r\n\r\nAll right--no leave. They were not, after their late experiences so\r\nentranced with Terraport that they wanted to linger in its environs any\r\nlonger than they had to.\r\n\r\n\"We lose the Sargol contract--\"\r\n\r\nThat did hurt. But they had resigned themselves to it since the hour when\r\nthey had realized that they could not make it back to the perfumed\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n\"To Inter-Solar?\" Wilcox asked the important question.\r\n\r\nVan Rycke was smiling broadly, as if the loss he had just announced was\r\nin some way a gain. \"No--to Combine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Combine?\" the Captain echoed and his puzzlement was duplicated around\r\nthe circle. How did Inter-Solar's principal rival come into it?\r\n\r\n\"We've made a deal with Combine,\" Van Rycke informed them. \"I wasn't\r\ngoing to let I-S cash in on our loss. So I went to Vickers at Combine and\r\ntold him the situation. He understands that we were in solid with the\r\nSalariki and that the Eysies are not. And a chance to point a blaster at\r\nI-S's tail is just what he has been waiting for. The shipment will go out\r\nto the storm priests tomorrow on a light cruiser--it'll make it on time.\"\r\n\r\nYes, a light cruiser, one of the fast ships maintained by the big\r\nCompanies, could make the transition to Sargol with a slight margin to\r\nspare. Stotz nodded his approval at this practical solution.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going with it--\" That did jerk them all up short. For Van Rycke to\r\nleave the Queen--_that_ was as unthinkable as if Captain Jellico had\r\nsuddenly announced that he was about to retire and become a kelp farmer.\r\n\"Just for the one trip,\" the Cargo-master hastened to assure them. \"I\r\nsmooth their vector with the storm priests and hand over so the Eysies\r\nwill be frozen out--\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Jellico interrupted at that point. \"D'you mean that Combine is\r\n_buying_ us out--not just taking over? What kind of a deal--\"\r\n\r\nBut Van Rycke, his smile a brilliant stretch across his plump face, was\r\nnodding in agreement. \"They're taking over our contract and our place\r\nwith the Salariki.\"\r\n\r\n\"In return for what?\" Steen Wilcox asked for them all.\r\n\r\n\"For twenty-five thousand credits and a mail run between Xecho and\r\nTrewsworld--frontier planets. They're far enough from Terra to get around\r\nthe exile ruling. The Patrol will escort us out and see that we get down\r\nto work like good little space men. We'll have two years of a nice, quiet\r\nrun on regular pay. Then, when all the powers that shine have forgotten\r\nabout us, we can cut in on the trade routes again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the pay?\" \"First or second class mail?\" \"When do we start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Standard pay on the completion of each run--Board rates,\" he made\r\nreplies in order. \"First, second and third class mail--anything that\r\nbears the government seal and out in those quarters it is apt to be\r\n_anything_! And you start as soon as you can get to Xecho and relieve the\r\nCombine scout which has been holding down the run.\"\r\n\r\n\"While you go to Sargol--\" commented Jellico.\r\n\r\n\"While I make one voyage to Sargol. You can spare me,\" he dropped one of\r\nhis big hands on Dane's shoulder and gave the flesh beneath it a quick\r\nsqueeze. \"Seeing as how our juniors helped pull us out of this last\r\nmix-up we can trust them about an inch farther than we did before.\r\nAnyway--Cargo-master on a mail run is more or less a thumb-twiddling job\r\nat the best. And you can trust Thorson on stowage--that's one thing he\r\n_does_ know.\" Which dubious ending left Dane wondering as to whether he\r\nhad been complimented or warned. \"I'll be on board again before you know\r\nit--the Combine will ship me out to Trewsworld on your second trip across\r\nand I'll join ship there. For once we won't have to worry for awhile.\r\nNothing can happen on a mail run.\" He shook his head at the three\r\nyoungest members of the crew. \"You're in for a very dull time--and it\r\nwill serve you right. Give you a chance to learn your jobs so that when\r\nyou come up for reassignment you can pick up some of those files you were\r\njust demoted. Now,\" he started briskly for the door, \"I'll tranship to\r\nthe Combine cruiser. I take it that you _don't_ want to meet the Video\r\npeople?\"\r\n\r\nAt their hasty agreement to that, he laughed. \"Well, the Patrol doesn't\r\nwant the Video spouting about 'high-handed official news suppression' so\r\nabout an hour or so from now you'll be let out the back way. They put the\r\nQueen in a cradle and a field scooter will take you to her. You'll find\r\nher serviced for a take-off to Luna City. You can refit there for deep\r\nspace. Frankly the sooner you get off-world the happier all ranks are\r\ngoing to be--both here and on the Board. It will be better for us to walk\r\nsoftly for a while and let them forget that the Solar Queen and her crazy\r\ncrew exists. Separately and together you've managed to break--or at least\r\nbend--half the laws in the books and they'd like to have us out of their\r\nminds.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Jellico stood up. \"They aren't any more anxious to see us go\r\nthan we are to get out of here. You've pulled it off for us again, Van,\r\nand we're lucky to get out of it this easy--\"\r\n\r\nVan Rycke rolled his eyes ceilingward. \"You'll never know how lucky! Be\r\nglad Combine hates the space I-S blasts through. We were able to use that\r\nto our advantage. Get the big fellows at each others' throats and they'll\r\nstop annoying us--simple proposition but it works. Anyway we're set in\r\nblessed and peaceful obscurity now. Thank the Spirit of Free Space\r\nthere's practically no trouble one can get into on a safe and sane mail\r\nroute!\"\r\n\r\nBut Cargo-master Van Rycke, in spite of knowing the Solar Queen and the\r\ntemper of her crew, was exceedingly over-optimistic when he made that\r\nemphatic statement.",
