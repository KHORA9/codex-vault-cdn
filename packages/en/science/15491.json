And though it comes accompany’d with two _disadvantages_, the\r\n_meanness_ of the _Author_, and of the _Subject_; yet in both I am\r\n_incouraged_ by the _greatness_ of your _Mercy_ and your _Knowledge_. By\r\nthe _one_ I am taught, that you can _forgive_ the most _presumptuous\r\nOffendors_: And by the _other_, that you will not _esteem_ the least work\r\nof _Nature_, or _Art_, unworthy your _Observation_. Amidst the many\r\n_felicities_ that have accompani’d _your Majesties_ happy _Restauration_\r\nand _Government_, it is none of the least considerable that _Philosophy_\r\nand _Experimental Learning_ have _prosper’d_ under your _Royal Patronage_.\r\nAnd as the calm prosperity of your Reign has given us the _leisure_ to\r\nfollow these _Studies_ of _quiet_ and _retirement_, so it is just, that the\r\n_Fruits_ of them should, by way of _acknowledgement_, be return’d to _your\r\nMajesty_. There are, Sir, several other of your Subjects, of your _Royal\r\nSociety_, now busie about _Nobler_ matters: The _Improvement_ of\r\n_Manufactures_ and _Agriculture_, the _Increase_ of _Commerce_, the\r\n_Advantage_ of _Navigation_: In all which they are _assisted_ by _your\r\nMajesties Incouragement_ and _Example_. Amidst all those _greater_ Designs,\r\nI here presume to bring in that which is more _proportionable_ to the\r\n_smalness_ of my Abilities, and to offer some of the _least_ of all\r\n_visible things_, to that _Mighty King_, that has _establisht an Empire_\r\nover the best of all _Invisible things_ of this World, the _Minds_ of Men.\r\n\r\nYour Majesties most humble\r\nand most obedient\r\nSubject and Servant,\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOKE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAfter my _Address_ to our _Great Founder_ and _Patron_, I could not but\r\nthink my self oblig’d, in consideration of those _many Ingagements_ you\r\nhave laid upon me, to offer these my _poor Labours_ to this MOST\r\nILLUSTRIOUS ASSEMBLY. YOU have been pleas’d formerly to accept of these\r\nrude _Draughts_. I have since added to them some _Descriptions_, and some\r\n_Conjectures_ of my own. And therefore, together with YOUR _Acceptance_, I\r\nmust also beg YOUR _pardon_. The Rules YOU have prescrib’d YOUR selves in\r\nYOUR Philosophical Progress do seem the best that have ever yet been\r\npractis’d. And particularly that of avoiding _Dogmatizing_, and the\r\n_espousal_ of any _Hypothesis_ not sufficiently grounded and confirm’d by\r\n_Experiments_. This way seems the most excellent, and may preserve both\r\n_Philosophy_ and _Natural History_ from its former _Corruptions_. In saying\r\nwhich, I may seem to condemn my own Course in this Treatise; in which there\r\nmay perhaps be some _Expressions_, which may seem more _positive_ then YOUR\r\nPrescriptions will permit: And though I desire to have them understood only\r\nas _Conjectures_ and _Quæries_ (which YOUR Method does not altogether\r\ndisallow) yet if even in those I have exceeded, ’tis fit that I should\r\ndeclare, that it was not done by YOUR Directions. For it is most\r\nunreasonable, that YOU should undergo the _imputation_ of the _faults_ of\r\nmy _Conjectures_, seeing YOU can receive so _small advantage_ of reputation\r\nby the _sleight Observations_ of\r\n\r\nYOUR most humble and\r\nmost faithful Servant\r\n\r\nROBERT HOOKE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nIt is the great prerogative of Mankind above other Creatures, that we are\r\nnot only able to _behold_ the works of Nature, or barely to _sustein_ our\r\nlives by them, but we have also the power of _considering_, _comparing_,\r\n_altering_, _assisting_, and _improving_ them to various uses. And as this\r\nis the peculiar priviledge of humane Nature in general, so is it capable of\r\nbeing so far advanced by the helps of Art, and Experience, as to make some\r\nMen excel others in their Observations, and Deductions, almost as much as\r\nthey do Beasts. By the addition of such _artificial Instruments_ and\r\n_methods_, there may be, in some manner, a reparation made for the\r\nmischiefs, and imperfection, mankind has drawn upon it self, by negligence,\r\nand intemperance, and a wilful and superstitious deserting the Prescripts\r\nand Rules of Nature, whereby every man, both from a deriv’d corruption,\r\ninnate and born with him, and from his breeding and converse with men, is\r\nvery subject to slip into all sorts of errors.\r\n\r\nThe only way which now remains for us to recover some degree of those\r\nformer perfections, seems to be, by rectifying the operations of the\r\n_Sense_, the _Memory_, and _Reason_, since upon the evidence, the\r\n_strength_, the _integrity_, and the _right correspondence_ of all these,\r\nall the light, by which our actions are to be guided is to be renewed, and\r\nall our command over things is to be establisht.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore most worthy of our consideration, to recollect their\r\nseveral defects, that so we may the better understand how to supply them,\r\nand by what assistances we may _inlarge_ their power, and _secure_ them in\r\nperforming their particular duties.\r\n\r\nAs for the actions of our _Senses_, we cannot but observe them to be in\r\nmany particulars much outdone by those of other Creatures, and when at\r\nbest, to be far short of the perfection they seem capable of: And these\r\ninfirmities of the Senses arise from a double cause, either from the\r\n_disproportion of the Object to the Organ_, whereby an infinite number of\r\nthings can never enter into them, or else from _error in the Perception_,\r\nthat many things, which come within their reach, are not received in a\r\nright manner.\r\n\r\nThe like frailties are to be found in the _Memory;_ we often let many\r\nthings _slip away_ from us, which deserve to be retain’d, and of those\r\nwhich we treasure up, a great part is either _frivolous_ or _false_; and if\r\ngood, and substantial, either in tract of time _obliterated_, or at best so\r\n_overwhelmed_ and buried under more frothy notions, that when there is need\r\nof them, they are in vain sought for.\r\n\r\nThe two main foundations being so deceivable, it is no wonder, that all\r\nthe succeeding works which we build upon them, of arguing, concluding,\r\ndefining, judging, and all the other degrees of Reason, are lyable to the\r\nsame imperfection, being, at best, either vain, or uncertain: So that the\r\nerrors of the _understanding_ are answerable to the two other, being\r\ndefective both in the quantity and goodness of its knowledge; for the\r\nlimits, to which our thoughts are confin’d, are small in respect of the\r\nvast extent of Nature it self; some parts of it are _too large_ to be\r\ncomprehended, and some _too little_ to be perceived. And from thence it\r\nmust follow, that not having a full sensation of the Object, we must be\r\nvery lame and imperfect in our conceptions about it, and in all the\r\nproportions which we build upon it; hence, we often take the _shadow_ of\r\nthings for the _substance_, small _appearances_ for good _similitudes_,\r\n_similitudes_ for _definitions;_ and even many of those, which we think, to\r\nbe the most solid definitions, are rather expressions of our own misguided\r\napprehensions then of the true nature of the things themselves.\r\n\r\nThe effects of these imperfections are manifested in different ways,\r\naccording to the temper and disposition of the several minds of men, some\r\nthey incline to _gross ignorance_ and stupidity, and others to a\r\n_presumptuous imposing_ on other mens Opinions, and a _confident\r\ndogmatizing_ on matters, whereof there is no assurance to be given.\r\n\r\nThus all the uncertainty, and mistakes of humane actions, proceed either\r\nfrom the narrowness and wandring of our _Senses_, from the slipperiness or\r\ndelusion of our _Memory_, from the confinement or rashness of our\r\n_Understanding_, so that ’tis no wonder, that our power over natural causes\r\nand effects is so slowly improv’d, seeing we are not only to contend with\r\nthe obscurity and _difficulty of the things_ whereon we work and think, but\r\neven the _forces of our own minds_ conspire to betray us.\r\n\r\nThese being the dangers in the process of humane Reason, the remedies of\r\nthem all can only proceed from the _real_, the _mechanical_, the\r\n_experimental_ Philosophy, which has this advantage over the Philosophy of\r\n_discourse_ and _disputation_, that whereas that chiefly aims at the\r\nsubtilty of its Deductions and Conclusions, without much regard to the\r\nfirst ground-work, which ought to be well laid on the Sense and Memory; so\r\nthis intends the right ordering of them all, and the making them\r\nserviceable to each other.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be undertaken in this weighty work, is a _watchfulness\r\nover the failings_ and an _inlargement of the dominion_, of the Senses.\r\n\r\nTo which end it is requisite, first, That there should be a _scrupulous_\r\nchoice, and a _strict examination_, of the reality, constancy, and\r\ncertainty of the Particulars that we admit: This is the first rise whereon\r\ntruth is to begin, and here the most severe, and most impartial diligence,\r\nmust be imployed; the storing up of all, without any regard to evidence or\r\nuse, will only tend to darkness and confusion. We must not therefore esteem\r\nthe riches of our Philosophical treasure by the _number_ only, but chiefly\r\nby the _weight_; the most _vulgar_ Instances are not to be neglected, but\r\nabove all, the most _instructive_ are to be entertain’d; the footsteps of\r\nNature are to be trac’d, not only in her _ordinary course_, but when she\r\nseems to be put to her shifts, to make many _doublings_ and _turnings_, and\r\nto use some kind of art in indeavouring to avoid our discovery.\r\n\r\nThe next care to be taken, in respect of the Senses, is a supplying of\r\ntheir infirmities with _Instruments_, and, as it were, the adding of\r\n_artificial Organs_ to the _natural_; this in one of them has been of late\r\nyears accomplisht with prodigious benefit to all sorts of useful knowledge,\r\nby the invention of Optical Glasses. By the means of _Telescopes_, there is\r\nnothing so _far distant_ but may be represented to our view; and by the\r\nhelp of _Microscopes_, there is nothing so _small_, as to escape our\r\ninquiry; hence there is a new visible World discovered to the\r\nunderstanding. By this means the Heavens are open’d, and a vast number of\r\nnew Stars, and new Motions, and new Productions appear in them, to which\r\nall the antient Astronomers were utterly Strangers. By this the Earth it\r\nself, which lyes so neer us, under our feet, shews quite a new thing to us,\r\nand in every _little particle_ of its matter; we now behold almost as great\r\na variety of Creatures, as we were able before to reckon up in the whole\r\n_Universe_ it self.\r\n\r\nIt seems not improbable, but that by these helps the subtilty of the\r\ncomposition of Bodies, the structure of their parts, the various texture of\r\ntheir matter, the instruments and manner of their inward motions, and all\r\nthe other possible appearances of things, may come to be more fully\r\ndiscovered; all which the antient _Peripateticks_ were content to\r\ncomprehend in two general and (unless further explain’d) useless words of\r\n_Matter_ and _Form_. From whence there may arise many admirable advantages,\r\ntowards the increase of the _Operative_, and the _Mechanick_ Knowledge, to\r\nwhich this Age seems so much inclined, because we may perhaps be inabled to\r\ndiscern all the secret workings of Nature, almost in the same manner as we\r\ndo those that are the productions of Art, and are manag’d by Wheels, and\r\nEngines, and Springs, that were devised by humane Wit.\r\n\r\nIn this kind I here present to the World my imperfect Indeavours; which\r\nthough they shall prove no other way considerable, yet, I hope, they may be\r\nin some measure useful to the main Design of a _reformation_ in Philosophy,\r\nif it be only by shewing, that there it not so much requir’d towards it,\r\nany strength of _Imagination_, or exactness of _Method_, or depth of\r\n_Contemplation_ (though the addition of these, where they can be had, must\r\nneeds produce a much more perfect composure) as a sincere _Hand_, and a\r\n_faithful_ Eye, to examine, and to record, the things themselves as they\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nAnd I beg my Reader, to let me take the boldness to assure him, that in\r\nthis present condition of knowledge, a man so qualified, as I have\r\nindeavoured to be, only with resolution, and integrity, and plain\r\nintentions of imploying his _Senses_ aright, may venture to compare the\r\nreality and the usefulness of his services, towards the true Philosophy,\r\nwith those of other men, that are of much stronger, and more acute\r\n_speculations_, that shall not make use of the same method by the Senses.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the Science of Nature has been already too long made only a\r\nwork of the _Brain_ and the _Fancy_: It is now high time that it should\r\nreturn to the plainness and soundness of _Observations_ on _material_ and\r\n_obvious_ things. It is said of great Empires, That _the best way to\r\npreserve them from decay, is to bring them back to the first Principles,\r\nand Arts, on which they did begin_. The same is undoubtedly true in\r\nPhilosophy, that by wandring far away into _invisible Notions_, has almost\r\nquite destroy’d it self, and it can never be recovered, or continued, but\r\nby returning into the same _sensible paths_, in which it did at first\r\nproceed.\r\n\r\nIf therefore the Reader expects from me any infallible Deductions, or\r\ncertainty of _Axioms_, I am to say for my self, that those stronger Works\r\nof Wit and Imagination are above my weak Abilities; or if they had not been\r\nso, I would not have made use of them in this present Subject before me:\r\nWhenever he finds that I have ventur’d at any small Conjectures, at the\r\ncauses of the things that I have observed, I beseech him to look upon them\r\nonly as _doubtful Problems_, and _uncertain ghesses_, and not as\r\nunquestionable Conclusions, or matters of unconfutable Science; I have\r\nproduced nothing here, with intent to bind his understanding to an\r\n_implicit_ consent; I am so far from that, that I desire him, not\r\nabsolutely to rely upon these Observations of my eyes, if he finds them\r\ncontradicted by the future Ocular Experiments of sober and impartial\r\nDiscoverers.\r\n\r\nAs for my part, I have obtained my end, if these my small Labours shall be\r\nthought fit to take up some place in the large stock of _natural\r\nObservations_, which so many hands are busie in providing. If I have\r\ncontributed the _meanest foundations_ whereon others may raise nobler\r\n_Superstructures_, I am abundantly satisfied; and all my ambition is, that\r\nI may serve to the great Philosophers of this Age, as the makers and the\r\ngrinders of my Glasses did to me; that I may prepare and furnish them with\r\nsome _Materials_, which they may afterwards _order_ and _manage_ with\r\nbetter skill, and to far greater advantage.\r\n\r\nThe next remedies in this universal cure of the Mind are to be applied to\r\nthe _Memory_, and they are to consist of such Directions as may inform us,\r\nwhat things are best to be _stor’d up_ for our purpose, and which is the\r\nbest way of so _disposing_ them, that they may not only be _kept in\r\nsafety_, but ready and convenient, to be at any time _produc’d_ for use, as\r\noccasion shall require. But I will not here prevent my self in what I may\r\nsay in another Discourse, wherein I shall make an attempt to propose some\r\nConsiderations of the manner of compiling a Natural and Artificial History,\r\nand of so ranging and registring its Particulars into Philosophical Tables,\r\nas may make them most useful for the raising of _Axioms_ and _Theories_.\r\n\r\nThe last indeed is the most _hazardous_ Enterprize, and yet the most\r\n_necessary_; and that is, to take such care that the _Judgment_ and the\r\n_Reason_ of Man (which is the third Faculty to be repair’d and improv’d)\r\nshould receive such assistance, as to avoid the dangers to which it is by\r\nnature most subject. The Imperfections, which I have already mention’d, to\r\nwhich it is lyable, do either belong to the _extent_, or the _goodness_ of\r\nits knowledge; and here the difficulty is the greater, least that which may\r\nbe thought a _remedy_ for the one should prove _destructive_ to the other,\r\nleast by seeking to inlarge our Knowledge, we should render it weak and\r\nuncertain; and least by being too scrupulous and exact about every\r\nCircumstance of it, we should confine and streighten it too much.\r\n\r\nIn both these the middle wayes are to be taken, nothing is to be_\r\nomitted_, and yet every thing to pass a _mature deliberation_: No\r\n_Intelligence_ from Men of all Professions, and quarters of the World, to\r\nbe _slighted_, and yet all to be so _severely examin’d_, that there remain\r\nno room for doubt or instability; much _rigour_ in admitting, much\r\n_strictness_ in comparing, and above all, much _slowness_ in debating, and\r\n_shyness_ in determining, is to be practised. The _Understanding_ is to\r\n_order_ all the inferiour services of the lower Faculties; but yet it is to\r\ndo this only as a _lawful Master_, and not as a _Tyrant._ It must not\r\n_incroach_ upon their Offices, nor take upon it self the employments which\r\nbelong to either of them. It must _watch_ the irregularities of the Senses,\r\nbut it must not go before them, or _prevent_ their information. It must\r\n_examine_, _range_, and _dispose_ of the bank which is laid up in the\r\nMemory: but it must be sure to make _distinction_ between the _sober_ and\r\n_well collected heap_, and the _extravagant Ideas_, and _mistaken Images_,\r\nwhich there it may sometimes light upon. So many are the _links_, upon\r\nwhich the true Philosophy depends, of which, if any one be _loose_, or\r\n_weak_, the whole _chain_ is in danger of being dissolv’d; it is to _begin_\r\nwith the Hands and Eyes, and to _proceed_ on through the Memory, to be\r\n_continued_ by the Reason; nor is it to stop there, but to _come about_ to\r\nthe Hands and Eyes again, and so, by a _continual passage round_ from one\r\nFaculty to another, it is to be maintained in life and strength, as much as\r\nthe body of man is by the _circulation_ of the blood through the several\r\nparts of the body, the Arms, the Feet, the Lungs, the Heart, and the Head.\r\n\r\nIf once this method were followed with diligence and attention, there is\r\nnothing that lyes within the power of human Wit (or which is far more\r\neffectual) of human Industry, which we might not compass; we might not only\r\nhope for Inventions to equalize those of _Copernicus_, _Galileo_,\r\n_Gilbert_, _Harvy_, and of others, whose Names are almost lost, that were\r\nthe Inventors of _Gun-powder_, the _Seamans Compass_, _Printing_,\r\n_Etching_, _Graving_, _Microscopes_, &c. but multitudes that may far exceed\r\nthem: for even those discoveries seem to have been the products of some\r\nsuch method, though but imperfect; What may not be therefore expected from\r\nit if thoroughly prosecuted? _Talking_ and _contention of Arguments_ would\r\nsoon be turn’d into _labours_; all the fine _dreams_ of Opinions, and\r\n_universal metaphysical natures_, which the luxury of subtil Brains has\r\ndevis’d, would quickly vanish, and give place to _solid Histories_,\r\n_Experiments_ and _Works._ And as at first, mankind _fell_ by _tasting_ of\r\nthe forbidden Tree of Knowledge, so we, their Posterity, may be in part\r\n_restor’d_ by the same way, not only by _beholding_ and _contemplating_,\r\nbut by _tasting_ too those fruits of Natural knowledge, that were never yet\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nFrom hence the World may be assisted with _variety_ of Inventions, _new_\r\nmatter for Sciences may be _collected_, the _old improv’d_, and their\r\n_rust_ rubb’d away; and as it is by the benefit of Senses that we receive\r\nall our Skill in the works of Nature, so they also may be wonderfully\r\nbenefited by it, and may be guided to an easier and more exact performance\r\nof their Offices; ’tis not unlikely, but that we may find out wherein our\r\nSenses are deficient, and as easily find wayes of repairing them.\r\n\r\nThe Indeavours of Skilful men have been most conversant about the\r\nassistance of the Eye, and many noble Productions have followed upon it;\r\nand from hence we may conclude, that there is a way open’d for advancing\r\nthe operations, not only of all the other Senses, but even of the Eye it\r\nself; that which has been already done ought not to content us, but rather\r\nto incourage us to proceed further, and to attempt greater things in the\r\nsame and different wayes.\r\n\r\n’Tis not unlikely, but that there may be yet invented several other helps\r\nfor the eye, at much exceeding those already found, as those do the bare\r\neye, such as by which we may perhaps be able to discover _living Creatures_\r\nin the Moon, or other Planets, the _figures_ of the compounding Particles\r\nof matter, and the particular _Schematisms_ and _Textures_ of Bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd as _Glasses_ have highly promoted our _seeing_, so ’tis not\r\nimprobable, but that there may be found many _Mechanical Inventions_ to\r\nimprove our other Senses, of _hearing_, _smelling_, _tasting_, _touching._\r\n’Tis not impossible to hear a _whisper_ a _furlongs_ distance, it having\r\nbeen already done; and perhaps the nature of the thing would not make it\r\nmore impossible, though that furlong should be ten times multiply’d. And\r\nthough some famous Authors have affirm’d it impossible to hear through the\r\n_thinnest plate_ of _Muscovy-glass_; yet I know a way, by which ’tis easie\r\nenough to hear one speak through a _wall a yard thick_. It has not been yet\r\nthoroughly examin’d, how far _Otocousticons_ may be improv’d, nor what\r\nother wayes there may be of _quickning_ our hearing, or _conveying_ sound\r\nthrough _other bodies_ then the _Air_: for that that is not the only\r\n_medium_, I can assure the Reader, that I have, by the help of a _distended\r\nwire_, propagated the sound to a very considerable distance in an\r\n_instant_, or with as seemingly quick a motion as that of light, at least,\r\nincomparably swifter then that, which at the same time was propagated\r\nthrough the Air; and this not only in a straight line, or direct, but in\r\none bended in many angles.\r\n\r\nNor are the other three so perfect, but that _diligence_, _attention_, and\r\nmany _mechanical contrivances_, may also highly improve them. For since the\r\nsense of _smelling_ seems to be made by the _swift passage_ of the _Air_\r\n(_impregnated_ with the steams and _effluvia_ of several odorous Bodies)\r\nthrough the grisly _meanders_ of the Nose whose surfaces are _cover’d_ with\r\na very sensible _nerve_, and _moistned_ by a _transudation_ from the\r\n_processus mamillares_ of the Brain, and some adjoyning _glandules_, and by\r\nthe moist _steam_ of the _Lungs_, with a Liquor convenient for the\r\nreception of those _effluvia_ and by the adhesion and mixing of those\r\nsteams with that liquor, and thereby affecting the nerve, or perhaps by\r\ninsinuating themselves into the juices of the brain, after the same manner,\r\nas I have in the following Observations intimated, the parts of Salt to\r\npass through the skins of Effs, and Frogs. Since, I say, smelling seems to\r\nbe made by some such way, ’tis not improbable, but that some contrivance,\r\nfor making a great quantity of Air pass quick through the Nose, might as\r\nmuch promote the sense of smelling, as the any wayes hindring that passage\r\ndoes dull and destroy it. Several tryals I have made, both of hindring and\r\npromoting this sense, and have succeeded in some according to expectation;\r\nand indeed to me it seems capable of being improv’d, for the judging of the\r\nconstitutions of many Bodies. Perhaps we may thereby also judge (as other\r\nCreatures seem to do) what is wholsome, what poyson; and in a word, what\r\nare the specifick properties of Bodies.\r\n\r\nThere may be also some other mechanical wayes found out, of sensibly\r\nperceiving the _effluvia_ of Bodies; several Instances of which, were it\r\nhere proper, I could give of Mineral steams and exhalations; and it seems\r\nnot impossible, but that by some such wayes improved, may be discovered,\r\nwhat Minerals lye buried under the Earth, without the trouble to dig for\r\nthem; some things to confirm this Conjecture may be found in _Agricola_,\r\nand other Writers of Minerals, speaking of the Vegetables that are apt to\r\nthrive, or pine, in those steams.\r\n\r\nWhether also those steams, which seem to issue out of the Earth, and mix\r\nwith the Air (and so to precipitate some _aqueous_ Exhalations, wherewith\r\n’tis impregnated) may not be by some way detected before they produce the\r\neffect, seems hard to determine; yet something of this kind I am able to\r\ndiscover, by an Instrument I contriv’d to shew all the minute variations in\r\nthe pressure of the Air; by which I constantly find, that before, and\r\nduring the time of rainy weather, the pressure of the Air is less, and in\r\n_dry weather_, but especially when an _Eastern Wind_ (which having past\r\nover vast tracts of Land is heavy with Earthy Particles) blows, it is much\r\nmore, though these changes are varied according to very odd Laws.\r\n\r\n    The Instrument is this. I prepare a pretty capacious Bolt-head AB, with\r\n    a small stem about two foot and a half long DC; upon the end of this D\r\n    I put on a small bended Glass, or brazen _syphon_ DEF (open at D, E and\r\n    F, but to be closed with cement at F and E, as occasion serves) whose\r\n    stem F should be about six or eight inches long, but the bore of it not\r\n    above half an inch diameter, and very even; these I fix very strongly\r\n    together by the help of very hard Cement, and then fit the whole Glass\r\n    ABCDEF into a long Board, or Frame, in such manner, that almost half\r\n    the head AB may lye buried in a concave Hemisphere cut into the Board\r\n    RS; then I place it so on the Board RS, as is exprest in the first\r\n    figure of the first Scheme; and fix it very firm and steady in that\r\n    posture, so as that the weight of the _Mercury_ that is afterwards to\r\n    be put into it, may not in the least shake or stir it; then drawing a\r\n    line XY on the Frame RT, so that it may divide the ball into two equal\r\n    parts, or that it may pass, as ’twere, through the center of the ball.\r\n    I begin from that, and divide all the rest of the Board towards UT into\r\n    inches, and the inches between the 25 and the end E (which need not be\r\n    above two or three and thirty inches distant from the line XY) I\r\n    subdivide into Decimals; then stopping the end F with soft Cement, or\r\n    soft Wax, I invert the Frame, placing the head downwards, and the\r\n    Orifice E upwards; and by it, with a small Funnel, I fill the whole\r\n    Glass with Quicksilver; then by stopping the small Orifice E with my\r\n    finger, I oftentimes erect and invert the whole Glass and Frame, and\r\n    thereby free the Quicksilver and Glass from all the bubbles or parcels\r\n    of lurking Air; then inverting it as before, I fill it top full with\r\n    clear and well strain’d Quicksilver, and having made ready a small ball\r\n    of pretty hard Cement, by heat made very soft, I press it into the hole\r\n    E, and thereby stop it very fast; and to secure this Cement from flying\r\n    out afterward, I bind over it a piece of Leather, that is spread over\r\n    in the inside with Cement, and wound about it while the Cement is hot:\r\n    Having thus fastned it, I gently erect again the Glass after this\r\n    manner: I first let the Frame down edge-wayes, till the edge RV touch\r\n    the Floor, or ly horizontal; and then in that edging posture raise the\r\n    end RS; this I do, that if there chance to be any Air hidden in the\r\n    small Pipe E, it may ascend into the Pipe F, and not into the Pipe DC:\r\n    Having thus erected it, and hung it by the hole Q, or fixt it\r\n    perpendicularly by any other means, I open the end F, and by a small\r\n    _Syphon_ I draw out the _Mercury_ so long, till I find the surface of\r\n    it AB in the head to touch exactly the line XY; at which time I\r\n    immediately take away the _Syphon_, and if by chance it be run somewhat\r\n    below the line XY, by pouring in gently a little _Mercury_ at F, I\r\n    raise it again to its desired height, by this contrivance I make all\r\n    the sensible rising and falling of the _Mercury_ to be visible in the\r\n    surface of the _Mercury_ in the Pipe F, and scarce any in the head AB.\r\n    But because there really is some small change of the upper surface\r\n    also, I find by several Observations how much it rises in the Ball, and\r\n    falls in the Pipe F, to make the distance between the two surfaces an\r\n    inch greater then it was before; and the measure that it falls in the\r\n    Pipe is the length of the inch by which I am to mark the parts of the\r\n    Tube F, or the Board on which it lyes, into inches and Decimals: Having\r\n    thus justned and divided it, I have a large Wheel MNOP, whose outmost\r\n    limb is divided into two hundred equal parts; this by certain small\r\n    Pillars is fixt on the Frame RT, in the manner exprest in the Figure.\r\n    In the middle of this, on the back side, in a convenient frame, is\r\n    placed a small Cylinder, whose circumference is equal to twice the\r\n    length of one of those divisions, which I find answer to an inch of\r\n    ascent, or descent, of _Mercury_: This Cylinder I, is movable on a very\r\n    small Needle, on the end of which is fixt a very light Index KL, all\r\n    which are so pois’d on the Axis, or Needle, that no part is heavier\r\n    then another: Then about this Cylinder is wound a small Clew of Silk,\r\n    with two small steel Bullets at each end of it GH; one of these, which\r\n    is somewhat the heavier, ought to be so big, as freely to move to and\r\n    fro in the Pipe F; by means of which contrivance, every the least\r\n    variation of the height of the _Mercury_ will be made exceeding visible\r\n    by the motion to and fro of the small Index KL.\r\n\r\nBut this is but one way of discovering the _effluvia_ of the Earth mixt\r\nwith the Air; there may be perhaps many others, witness the _Hygroscope_,\r\nan Instrument whereby the watery steams volatile in the Air are discerned,\r\nwhich the Nose it self is not able to find. This I have describ’d in the\r\nfollowing Tract in the Description of the Beard of a wild Oat. Others\r\nthere are, may be discovered both by the Nose, and by other wayes also.\r\nThus the _smoak_ of burning _Wood_ is _smelt_, _seen_, and sufficiently\r\n_felt_ by the eyes: The _fumes_ of burning _Brimstone_ are _smelt_ and\r\ndiscovered also by the destroying the Colours of Bodies, as by the\r\n_whitening of a red Rose_: And who knows, but that the Industry of man,\r\nfollowing this method, may find out wayes of improving this sense to as\r\ngreat a degree of perfection at it is in any Animal, and perhaps yet\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\n’Tis not improbable also, but that our _taste_ may be very much improv’d,\r\neither by _preparing_ our taste for the Body, as, after eating _bitter_\r\nthings, _Wine_, or other _Vinous liquors_, are more sensibly tasted; or\r\nelse by _preparing_ Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with\r\nacid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid;\r\nthus _Lead_ becomes _sweeter_ then Sugar, and _Silver_ more _bitter_ then\r\nGall, _Copper_ and _Iron_ of most _loathsome_ tasts. And indeed the\r\nbusiness of this sense being to discover the presence of dissolved Bodies\r\nin Liquors put on the Tongue, or in general to discover that a fluid body\r\nhas some solid body dissolv’d in it, and what they are; whatever\r\ncontrivance makes this discovery improves this sense. In this kind the\r\nmixtures of Chymical Liquors afford many Instances; as the sweet Vinegar\r\nthat is impregnated with Lead may be discovered to be so by the affusion of\r\na little of an _Alcalizate solution_: The bitter liquor of _Aqua fortis_\r\nand _Silver_ may be discover’d to be charg’d with that Metal, by laying in\r\nit some plates of Copper: ’Tis not improbable also, but there may be\r\nmultitudes of other wayes of discovering the parts dissolv’d, or dissoluble\r\nin liquors; and what is this discovery but a kind of _secundary tasting_.\r\n\r\n’Tis not improbable also, but that the sense of _feeling_ may be highly\r\nimprov’d, for that being a sense that judges of the more _gross_ and\r\n_robust motions_ of the _Particles_ of _Bodies_, seems capable of being\r\nimprov’d and assisted very many wayes. Thus for the distinguishing of\r\n_Heat_ and _Cold_, the _Weather-glass_ and _Thermometer_, which I have\r\ndescrib’d in this following Treatise, do exceedingly perfect it; by each of\r\nwhich the least variations of heat or cold, which the most Acute sense is\r\nnot able to distinguish, are manifested. This is oftentimes further\r\npromoted also by the help of _Burning-glasses_, and the like, which collect\r\nand unite the radiating heat. Thus the _roughness_ and _smoothness_ of a\r\nBody is made much more sensible by the help of a _Microscope_, then by the\r\nmost _tender_ and _delicate Hand_. Perhaps, a Physitian might, by several\r\nother _tangible_ proprieties, discover the constitution of a Body as well\r\nas by the _Pulse_. I do but instance in these, to shew what possibility\r\nthere may be of many others, and what probability and hopes there were of\r\nfinding them, if this method were followed; for the Offices of the five\r\nSenses being to detect either the _subtil_ and _curious Motions_ propagated\r\nthrough all _pellucid_ or perfectly _homogeneous_ Bodies; Or the more\r\n_gross_ and _vibrative Pulse_ communicated through the _Air_ and all other\r\nconvenient _mediums_, whether fluid or solid: Or the _effluvia_ of Bodies\r\n_dissolv’d_ in the _Air_; Or the _particles_ of bodies _dissolv’d_ or\r\n_dissoluble_ in _Liquors_, or the more _quick_ and _violent shaking motion_\r\nof _heat_ in all or any of these: whatsoever does any wayes promote any of\r\nthese kinds of _criteria_, does afford a way of improving some one sense.\r\nAnd what a multitude of these would a diligent Man meet with in his\r\ninquiries? And this for the helping and promoting the _sensitive faculty_\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nNext, as for the _Memory_, or _retentive faculty_, we may be sufficiently\r\ninstructed from the _written Histories_ of _civil actions_, what great\r\nassistance may be afforded the Memory, in the committing to writing things\r\nobservable in _natural operations_. If a Physitian be therefore accounted\r\nthe more able in his Faculty, because he has had long experience and\r\npractice, the remembrance of which, though perhaps very imperfect, does\r\nregulate all his after actions: What ought to be thought of that man, that\r\nhas not only a perfect _register_ of his own experience, but is grown _old_\r\nwith the experience of many hundreds of years, and many thousands of men.\r\n\r\nAnd though of late, men, beginning to be sensible of this convenience,\r\nhave here and there registred and printed some few _Centuries_, yet for the\r\nmost part they are set down very lamely and imperfectly, and, I fear, many\r\ntimes not so truly, they seeming, several of them, to be design’d more for\r\n_Ostentation_ then _publique use_: For, not to instance, that they do, for\r\nthe most part, omit those Experiences they have made, wherein their\r\nPatients have miscarried, it is very easie to be perceiv’d, that they do\r\nall along _hyperbolically extol_ their own Prescriptions, and vilifie those\r\nof others. Notwithstanding all which, these kinds of Histories are\r\ngenerally esteem’d useful, even to the ablest Physitian.\r\n\r\nWhat may not be expected from the _rational_ or _deductive Faculty_ that\r\nis furnisht with such _Materials_, and those so readily _adapted_, and\r\nrang’d for use, that in a moment, as ’twere, thousands of Instances,\r\nserving for the _illustration_, _determination_, or _invention_, of almost\r\nany inquiry, may be _represented_ even to the sight? How neer the nature of\r\n_Axioms_ must all those _Propositions_ be which are examin’d before so many\r\n_Witnesses_? And how difficult will it be for any, though never so subtil\r\nan error in Philosophy, to _scape_ from being discover’d, after it has\r\nindur’d the _touch_, and so many other _tryals_?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of mechanical way, and physical invention also is there requir’d\r\nthat might not this way be found out? The _Invention_ of a way to find the\r\n_Longitude_ of places is easily perform’d, and that to as great\r\n_perfection_ as is desir’d, or to at great an _accurateness_ as the\r\n_Latitude_ of places can be found at Sea; and perhaps yet also to a greater\r\ncertainty then that has been hitherto found, as I shall very speedily\r\nfreely manifest to the world. The way of _flying_ in the Air seems\r\nprincipally unpracticable, by reason of the _want of strength_ in _humane\r\nmuscles_; if therefore that could be suppli’d, it were, I think, easie to\r\nmake twenty contrivances to perform the office of _Wings_: What Attempts\r\nalso I have made for the supplying that Defect, and my successes therein,\r\nwhich, I think, are wholly new, and not inconsiderable, I shall in another\r\nplace relate.\r\n\r\n’Tis not unlikely also, but that _Chymists_, if they followed this method,\r\nmight find out their so much sought for _Alkahest_. What an _universal\r\nMenstruum_, which dissolves all sorts of _Sulphureous Bodies_, I have\r\ndiscover’d (which has not been before taken notice of as such) I have shewn\r\nin the sixteenth Observation.\r\n\r\nWhat a prodigious variety of Inventions in _Anatomy_ has this latter Age\r\nafforded, even in our own Bodies in the very _Heart_, by which we live, and\r\nthe Brain, which is the seat of our knowledge of other things? witness all\r\nthe excellent Works of _Pecquet_, _Bartholinus_, _Billius_, and many\r\nothers; and at home, of Doctor _Harvy_, Doctor _Ent_, Doctor _Willis_,\r\nDoctor _Glisson_. In _Celestial Observations_ we have far exceeded all the\r\nAntients, even the _Chaldeans_ and _Egyptians_ themselves, whose _vast\r\nPlains_, _high Towers_, and _clear Air_, did not give them so great\r\nadvantages over us, as have over them by our _Glasses_. By the help of\r\nwhich, they have been very much outdone by the famous _Galileo_,\r\n_Hevelius_, _Zulichem_; and our own Countrymen, Mr. _Rook_, Doctor _Wren_,\r\nand the great Ornament of our Church and Nation, the _Lord Bishop of\r\nExeter_. And to say no more in _Aerial Discoveries_, there has been a\r\nwonderful progress made by the _Noble Engine_ of _the most Illustrious Mr.\r\nBoyle_, whom it becomes me to mention with all honour, not only as my\r\nparticular Patron, but as the _Patron_ of _Philosophy_ it self; which he\r\nevery day _increases_ by his _Labours_, and _adorns_ by his _Example_.\r\n\r\nThe good success of all these _great Men_, and many others, and the now\r\nseemingly great _obviousness_ of most of their and divers other Inventions,\r\nwhich from the beginning of the world have been, as ’twere, trod on, and\r\nyet not minded till these last _inquisitive_ Ages (an Argument that there\r\nmay be yet behind multitudes of the like) puts me in mind to recommend such\r\nStudies, and the prosecution of them by such methods, to the _Gentlemen_ of\r\nour Nation, whose _leisure_ makes them fit to _undertake_, and the _plenty_\r\nof their fortunes _to accomplish_, extraordinary things in this way. And I\r\ndo not only propose this kind of _Experimental Philosophy_ as a matter of\r\nhigh _rapture_ and _delight_ of the mind, but even as a _material_ and\r\n_sensible Pleasure_. So vast it the _variety of Objects_ which will come\r\nunder their Inspections, so many _different wayes_ there are _of handling_\r\nthem, so great is the _satisfaction_ of _finding_ out _new things_, that I\r\ndare compare the _contentment_ which they will injoy, not only to that of\r\n_contemplation_, but even to that which most men prefer of _the very Senses\r\nthemselves_.\r\n\r\nAnd if they will please to take any incouragement from so mean and so\r\nimperfect endeavours as mine, upon my own experience, I can assure them,\r\nwithout arrogance, That there has not been any inquiry or Problem in\r\n_Mechanicks_, that I have hitherto propounded to my self, but by a certain\r\nmethod (which I may on some other opportunity explain) I have been able\r\npresently to examine the possibility of it; and if so, as easily to\r\nexcogitate divers wayes of performing it: And indeed it is possible to do\r\nas much by _this method_ in _Mechanicks_, as by _Algebra_ can be perform’d\r\nin _Geometry_. Nor can I at all doubt, but that the same method is as\r\napplicable to _Physical Enquiries_, and as likely to find and reap thence\r\nas plentiful a crop of Inventions; and indeed there seems to be no subject\r\nso barren, but may with this good husbandry be highly improv’d.\r\n\r\nToward the prosecution of this method in _Physical Inquiries_, I have here\r\nand there _gleaned_ up an _handful_ of Observations, in the collection of\r\nmost of which I made use of _Microscopes_, and some other _Glasses_ and\r\n_Instruments_ that improve the sense; which way I have herein taken, not\r\nthat there are not multitudes of useful and pleasant Observables, yet\r\nuncollected, obvious enough without the helps of Art, but only to promote\r\nthe use of Mechanical helps for the Senses, both in the surveying the\r\nalready visible World, and for the discovery of many others hitherto\r\nunknown, and to make us, with the great Conqueror, to be affected that we\r\nhave not yet overcome one World when there are so many others to be\r\ndiscovered, every considerable improvement of _Telescopes_ or _Microscopes_\r\nproducing new Worlds and _Terra-Incognita’s_ to our view.\r\n\r\nThe Glasses I used were of our English make, but though very good of the\r\nkind, yet far short of what might be expected, could we once find a way of\r\nmaking Glasses Elliptical, or of some more true shape; for though both\r\n_Microscopes_, and _Telescopes_, as they now are, will magnifie an Object\r\nabout a thousand thousand times bigger then it appears to the naked eye;\r\nyet the Apertures of the Object glasses are so very small, that very few\r\nRays are admitted, and even of those few there are so many false, that the\r\nObject appears _dark_ and _indistinct_: And indeed these inconveniences are\r\nsuch, as seem inseparable from Spherical Glasses, even when most exactly\r\nmade; but the way we have hitherto made use of for that purpose is so\r\nimperfect, that there may be perhaps ten wrought before one be made\r\ntolerably good, and most of those ten perhaps every one differing in\r\ngoodness one from another, which is an Argument, that the way hitherto used\r\nis, at least, very uncertain. So that these Glasses have a double defect;\r\nthe one, that very few of them are exactly true wrought; the other, that\r\neven of those that are best among them, none will admit a sufficient number\r\nof Rayes to magnifie the Object beyond a determinate bigness. Against which\r\nInconveniences the only Remedies I have hitherto met with are these.\r\n\r\n    First, for _Microscopes_ (where the Object we view is near and within\r\n    our power) the best way of making it appear bright in the Glass, is to\r\n    cast a great quantity of light on it by means of _convex glasses_, for\r\n    thereby, though the aperture be very small, yet there will throng in\r\n    through it such multitudes, that an Object will by this means indure to\r\n    be magnifi’d as much again as it would be without it. The way for doing\r\n    which is this. I make choice of some Room that has only one window open\r\n    to the South, and at about three or four foot distance from this\r\n    Window, on a Table, I place my _Microscope_, and then so place either a\r\n    round Globe of Water, or a very deep clear_ plano convex_ Glass (whose\r\n    convex side is turn’d towards the Window) that there is a great\r\n    quantity of Rayes collected and thrown upon the Object: Or if the Sun\r\n    shine, I place a small piece of oyly Paper very near the Object,\r\n    between that and the light; then with a good large Burning-Glass I so\r\n    collect and throw the Rayes on the Paper, that there may be a very\r\n    great quantity of light pass through it to the Object; yet I so\r\n    proportion that light, that it may not singe or burn the Paper. Instead\r\n    of which Paper there may be made use of a small piece of Looking-glass\r\n    plate, one of whose sides is made rough by being rubb’d on a flat Tool\r\n    with very fine sand, this will, if the heat be leisurely cast on it,\r\n    indure a much greater degree of heat, and consequently very much\r\n    augment a convenient light. By all which means the light of the Sun, or\r\n    of a Window, may be so cast on an Object, as to make it twice as light\r\n    as it would otherwise be without it, and that without any inconvenience\r\n    of glaring, which the immediate light of the Sun is very apt to create\r\n    in most Objects; for by this means the light is so equally diffused,\r\n    that all parts are alike inlightned; but when the immediate light of\r\n    the Sun falls on it, the reflexions from some few parts are so vivid,\r\n    that they drown the appearance of all the other, and are themselves\r\n    also, by reason of the inequality of light, indistinct, and appear only\r\n    radiant spots.\r\n\r\n    But because the light of the Sun, and also that of a Window, is in a\r\n    continual variation, and so many Objects cannot be view’d long enough\r\n    by them to be throughly examin’d; besides that, oftentimes the Weather\r\n    is so dark and cloudy, that for many dayes together nothing can be\r\n    view’d: And because also there are many Objects to be met with in the\r\n    night, which cannot so conveniently be kept perhaps till the day,\r\n    therefore to procure and cast a sufficient quantity of light on an\r\n    Object in the night, I thought of, and often used this, Expedient.\r\n\r\n    I procur’d me a small Pedestal, such as is describ’d in the fifth\r\n    Figure of the first _Scheme_ on the small Pillar AB, of which were two\r\n    movable Armes CD, which by means of the Screws EF, I could fix in any\r\n    part of the Pillar; on the undermost of these I plac’d a pretty large\r\n    Globe of Glass G, fill’d with exceeding clear Brine, stopt, inverted,\r\n    and fixt in the manner visible in the Figure; out of the side of which\r\n    Arm proceeded another Arm H, with many joynts; to the end of which was\r\n    fastned a deep plain _Convex glass_ I, which by means of this Arm could\r\n    be moved to and fro, and fixt in any posture. On the upper Arm was\r\n    placed a small Lamp K, which could be so mov’d upon the end of the Arm,\r\n    as to be set in a fit posture to give light through the Ball: By means\r\n    of this Instrument duly plac’d, as is exprest in the Figure, with the\r\n    small flame of a Lamp may be cast as great and convenient a light on\r\n    the Object as it will well indure; and being always constant, and to be\r\n    had at any time, I found most proper for drawing the representations of\r\n    those small Objects I had occasion to observe.\r\n\r\n    None of all which ways (though much beyond any other hitherto made use\r\n    of by any I know) do afford a sufficient help, but after a certain\r\n    degree of magnifying, they leave us again in the lurch. Hence it were\r\n    very desirable, that some way were thought of for making the\r\n    Object-glass of such a Figure as would conveniently bear a large\r\n    Aperture.\r\n\r\nAs for _Telescopes_, the only improvement they seem capable of, is the\r\nincreasing of their length; for the Object being remote, there is no\r\nthought of giving it a greater light then it has; and therefore to augment\r\nthe Aperture, the Glass must be ground of a very large sphere; for, by\r\nthat means, the longer the Glass be, the bigger aperture will it bear, if\r\nthe Glasses be of an equal goodness in their kind. Therefore a six will\r\nindure a much larger Aperture then a three foot Glass, and a sixty foot\r\nGlass will proportionably bear a greater Aperture then a thirty, and will\r\nas much excel it also as a six foot does a three foot, as I have\r\nexperimentally observ’d in one of that length made by Mr. _Richard Reives_\r\nhere at _London_, which will bear an Aperture above three inches over, and\r\nyet make the Object proportionably big and distinct; whereas there are very\r\nfew thirty foot Glasses that will indure an Aperture of more then two\r\ninches over. So that for _Telescopes_, supposing we had a very ready way of\r\nmaking their Object Glasses of exactly spherical Surfaces, we might, by\r\nincreasing the length of the Glass, magnifie the Object to any assignable\r\nbigness. And for performing both these, I cannot imagine any way more\r\neasie, and more exact, then by this following Engine, by means of which,\r\nany Glasses, of what length soever, may be speedily made. It seems the most\r\neasie, because with one and the same Tool may be with care ground an Object\r\nGlass, of any length or breadth requisite, and that with very little or no\r\ntrouble in fitting the Engine, and without much skill in the Grinder. It\r\nseems to be the most exact, for to the very last stroke the Glass does\r\nregulate and rectifie the Tool to its exact Figure; and the longer or more\r\nthe Tool and Glass are wrought together, the more exact will both of them\r\nbe of the desir’d Figure. Further, the motions of the Glass and Tool do so\r\ncross each other, that there is not one point of eithers Surface, but has\r\nthousands of cross motions thwarting it, so that there can be no kind of\r\nRings or Gutters made either in the Tool or Glass.\r\n\r\n    The contrivance of the Engine is, only to make the ends of two large\r\n    _Mandrils_ so to move, that the Centers of them may be at any\r\n    convenient distance asunder, and that the _Axis_ of the _Mandrils_\r\n    lying both in the same plain produc’d, may meet each other in any\r\n    assignable Angle; both which requisites may be very well perform’d by\r\n    the Engine describ’d in the third Figure of the first _Scheme_: where\r\n    AB signifies the Beam of a Lath fixt perpendicularly or Horizontally,\r\n    CD the two Poppet heads, fixt at about two foot distance, EF an Iron\r\n    _Mandril_, whose tapering neck F runs in an adapted tapering brass\r\n    Collar; the other end E runs on the point of a Screw G; in a convenient\r\n    place of this is fastned H a pully Wheel, and into the end of it, that\r\n    comes through the Poppet head C, is screwed a Ring of a hollow\r\n    _Cylinder_ K, or some other conveniently shap’d Tool, of what wideness\r\n    shall be thought most proper for the cize of Glasses, about which it is\r\n    to be imploy’d: As, for Object glasses, between twelve foot and an\r\n    hundred foot long, the Ring may be about six inches over, or indeed\r\n    somewhat more for those longer Glasses. It would be convenient also, and\r\n    not very chargeable, to have four or five several Tools; as one for all\r\n    Glasses between an inch and a foot, one for all Glasses between a foot\r\n    and ten foot long, another for all between ten and an hundred, a fourth\r\n    for all between a hundred and a thousand foot long; and if Curiosity\r\n    shall ever proceed so far, one for all lengths between a thousand and\r\n    ten thousand foot long; for indeed the principle is such, that\r\n    supposing the _Mandrils_ well made, and of a good length, and supposing\r\n    great care be used in working and polishing them, I see no reason, but\r\n    that a Glass of a thousand, nay of ten thousand foot long, may be as\r\n    well made as one of ten; for the reason is the same, supposing the\r\n    _Mandrils_ and Tools be made sufficiently strong, so that they cannot\r\n    bend; and supposing the Glass, out of which they are wrought, be\r\n    capable of so great a regularity in its parts as to refraction: this\r\n    hollow _Cylinder_ K is to contain the Sand, and by being drove round\r\n    very quick to and fro by means of a small Wheel, which may be mov’d\r\n    with ones foot, serves to grind the Glass: The other _Mandril_ is\r\n    shap’d like this, but it has an even neck instead of a taper one, and\r\n    runs in a Collar, that by the help of a Screw and a joynt made like M\r\n    in the Figure, it can be still adjustned to the wearing or wasting\r\n    neck: into the end of this _Mandril_ is screwed a Chock N on which with\r\n    Cement or Glew is fastned the piece of Glass Q that is to be form’d;\r\n    the middle of which Glass is to be plac’d just on the edge of the Ring,\r\n    and the Lath OP is to be set and fixt (by means of certain pieces and\r\n    screws, the manner whereof will be sufficiently evidenc’d by the Figure)\r\n    in such an Angle as is requisite to the forming of such a Sphere as the\r\n    Glass is design’d to be of; the geometrical ground of which being\r\n    sufficiently plain, though not heeded before, I shall, for brevities\r\n    sake, pass over. This last _Mandril_ to be made (by means of the\r\n    former, or some other Wheel) to run round very swift also, by which two\r\n    cross motions the Glass cannot chuse (if care be us’d) but be wrought\r\n    into a most exactly spherical Surface.\r\n\r\nBut because we are certain, from the _Laws of refraction_ (which I I have\r\nexperimentally found to be so, by an Instrument I shall presently describe)\r\nthat _the lines of the angles of Incidence are proportionate to the lines\r\nof the angles of Refraction_, therefore if Glasses could be made of those\r\nkind of Figures, or some other, such as the most incomparable _Des Cartes_\r\nhas invented, and demonstrated in his Philosophical and Mathematical Works,\r\nwe might hope for a much greater perfection of Opticks then can be\r\nrationally expected from spherical ones; for though, _cæteris paribus_, we\r\nfind, that the larger the _Telescope_ Object Glasses are, and the shorter\r\nthose of the _Microscope_, the better they magnifie, yet both of them,\r\nbeside such determinate dimensions, are by certain inconveniences rendred\r\nunuseful; for it will be exceeding _difficult_ to make and _manage_ a Tube\r\nabove an _hundred foot long_, and it will be as difficult to _inlighten_ an\r\nObject less then an hundred part of an inch distant from the Object Glass.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet made any attempts of that kind, though I know two or\r\nthree wayes, which, as far as I have yet considered, seem very probable,\r\nand may invite me to make a tryal as soon as I have an opportunity, of\r\nwhich I may hereafter perhaps acquaint the world. In the Interim, I shall\r\ndescribe the Instrument I even now mention’d, by which the _refraction_ of\r\nall kinds of Liquors may be most exactly measur’d, thereby to give the\r\ncurious an opportunity of making what further tryals of that kind they\r\nshall think requisite to any of their intended tryals; and to let them see\r\nthat the laws of Refraction are not only notional.\r\n\r\n    The Instrument consisted of five Rulers, or long pieces placed\r\n    together, after the manner exprest in the second Figure of the first\r\n    _Scheme_, where AB denotes a straight piece of wood about six foot and\r\n    two inches long, about three inches over, and an inch and half thick,\r\n    on the back side of which was hung a small plummet by a line stretcht\r\n    from top to bottom, by which this piece was set exactly upright, and so\r\n    very firmly fixt; in the middle of this was made a hole or center, into\r\n    which one end of a hollow cylindrical brass Box CC, fashion’d as I\r\n    shall by and by describe, was plac’d, and could very easily and truly\r\n    be mov’d to and fro; the other end of this Box being put into, and\r\n    moving in, a hole made in a small arm DD; into this box was fastned the\r\n    long Ruler EF, about three foot and three or four inches long, and at\r\n    three foot from the above mention’d Centers PP was a hole E, cut\r\n    through, and cross’d with two small threads, and at the end of it was\r\n    fixt a small sight G, and on the back side of it was fixt a small Arm\r\n    H, with a Screw to fix it in any place on the Ruler LM; this Ruler LM\r\n    was mov’d on the Center B (which was exactly three foot distance from\r\n    the middle Center P) and a line drawn through the middle of it LM, was\r\n    divided by a Line of cords into some sixty degrees, and each degree was\r\n    subdivided into minutes, so that putting the cross of the threads in E\r\n    upon any part of this divided line, I presently knew what Angle the two\r\n    Rules AB and EF made with each other, and by turning the Screw in H, I\r\n    could fix them in any position. The other Ruler also RS was made much\r\n    after the same manner, only it was not fixt to the hollow cylindrical\r\n    Box, but, by means of two small brass Armes or Ears, it mov’d on the\r\n    Centers of it; this also, by means of the cross threads in the hole S,\r\n    and by a Screw in K, could be fastned on any division of another line\r\n    of cords of the same radius drawn on NO. And so by that means, the\r\n    Angle made by the two Rulers, AB and RS, was also known. The Brass box\r\n    CC in the middle was shap’d very much like the Figure X, that is, it\r\n    was a cylindrical Box stopp’d close at either end, off of which a part\r\n    both of the sides and bottomes was cut out, so that the Box, when the\r\n    Pipe and that was joyned to it, would contain the Water when fill’d\r\n    half full, and would likewise, without running over, indure to be\r\n    inclin’d to an Angle, equal to that of the greatest refraction of\r\n    Water, and no more, without running over. The Ruler EF was fixt very\r\n    fast to the Pipe V, so that the Pipe V directed the length of the Ruler\r\n    EF, and the Box and Ruler were mov’d on the Pin TT, so as to make any\r\n    desirable Angle with the Ruler AB. The bottom of this Pipe V was stop’d\r\n    with a small piece of exactly plain Glass, which was plac’d exactly\r\n    perpendicular to the Line of direction, or _Axis_ of the Ruler EF. The\r\n    Pins also TT were drill’d with small holes through the _Axis_, and\r\n    through those holes was stretcht and fastned a small Wire. There was\r\n    likewise a small Pipe of Tin loosly put on upon the end of V, and\r\n    reaching down to the sight G; the use of which was only to keep any\r\n    false Rayes of light from passing through the bottom of V, and only\r\n    admitting such to pass as pierced through the sight G: All things being\r\n    placed together in the manner describ’d in the Figure; that is, the\r\n    Ruler AB being fixt perpendicular, I fill’d the Box CC with Water, or\r\n    any other Liquor, whose refraction I intended to try, till the Wire\r\n    passing through the middle of it were just covered: then I moved and\r\n    fixt the Ruler FE at any assignable Angle, and placed the flame of a\r\n    Candle just against the sight G; and looking through the sight I, I\r\n    moved the Ruler RS to and fro, till I perceived the light passing\r\n    through G to be covered, as ’twere, or divided by the dark Wire passing\r\n    through PP: then turning the Screw in K, I fixt it in that posture: And\r\n    through the hole S, I observed what degree and part of it was cut by\r\n    the cross threads in S. And this gave me the Angle of Inclination, APS\r\n    answering to the Angle of Refraction BPE: for the surface of the Liquor\r\n    in the Box will be alwayes horizontal, and consequently AB will be a\r\n    perpendicular to it; the Angle therefore APS will measure, or be the\r\n    Angle of Inclination in the Liquor; next EPB must be the Angle of\r\n    Refraction, for the Ray that passes through the sight G, passes also\r\n    perpendicularly through the Glass _Diaphragme_ at F, and consequently\r\n    also perpendicularly through the lower surface of the Liquor contiguous\r\n    to the Glass, and therefore suffers no refraction till it meet with the\r\n    horizontal surface of the Liquor in CC, which is determined by the two\r\n    Angles.\r\n\r\nBy means of this Instrument I can with _little trouble_, and a very small\r\nquantity of any _Liquor_, examine, most accurately, the _refraction_ of it\r\nnot only for one inclination, but for all; and thereby am inabled to make\r\nvery accurate Tables; several of which I have also experimentally made, and\r\nfind, that _Oyl of Turpentine_ has a much greater Refraction then _Spirit\r\nof Wine_, though it be _lighter_; and that _Spirit of Wine_ has a greater\r\nRefraction then _Water_, though it be lighter also; but that _salt Water_\r\nalso has a greater Refraction then _fresh_, though it be _heavier_: but\r\n_Alum water_ has a less refraction then common _Water_, though heavier\r\nalso. So that it seems, as to the _refraction_ made in a Liquor, the\r\n_specifick gravity_ is of no efficacy. By this I have also found that look\r\nwhat _proportion _the _Sine_ of the Angle of _one Inclination_ has to the\r\n_Sine_ of the Angle of _Refraction_, correspondent to it, the same\r\n_proportion_ have all the _Sines_ of other Inclinations to the _Sines_ of\r\ntheir appropriate Refractions.\r\n\r\n    My way for measuring how much a Glass magnifies an Object, plac’d at a\r\n    convenient distance from my eye, is this. Having rectifi’d the\r\n    _Microscope_, to see the desir’d Object through it very distinctly, at\r\n    the same time that I look upon the Object through the Glass with one\r\n    eye, I look upon other Objects at the same distance with my other bare\r\n    eye; by which means I am able, by the help of a _Ruler_ divided into\r\n    inches and small parts, and laid on the _Pedestal_ of the _Microscope_,\r\n    to cast, as it were, the magnifi’d appearance of the Object upon the\r\n    Ruler, and thereby exactly to measure the Diameter it appears of\r\n    through the Glass, which being compar’d with the Diameter it appears of\r\n    to the naked eye, will easily afford the quantity of its magnifying.\r\n\r\n    The _Microscope_, which for the most part I made use of, was shap’d\r\n    much like that in the sixth Figure of the first _Scheme_, the Tube\r\n    being for the most part not above six or seven inches long, though, by\r\n    reason it had four Drawers, it could very much be lengthened, as\r\n    occasion required; this was contriv’d with three Glasses; a small\r\n    Object Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one\r\n    about C: this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an\r\n    Object at once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of\r\n    radiating Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon\r\n    the deep Eye Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small\r\n    parts of a Body more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only\r\n    made use of one Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer\r\n    the Refractions are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And\r\n    therefore ’tis not to be doubted, but could we make a_ Microscope _to\r\n    have one only refraction, it would, _cæteris paribus_, far excel any\r\n    other that had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a\r\n    very clear piece of a broken _Venice_ Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out\r\n    into very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these\r\n    threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul,\r\n    or drop, which will hang at the end of the thread; and if further you\r\n    stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing\r\n    Wax, so as that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone\r\n    first grind off a good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal\r\n    plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very\r\n    smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft Wax against a small\r\n    needle hole, prick’d through a thin Plate of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or\r\n    any other Metal, and an Object, plac’d very near, be look’d at through\r\n    it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more distinct then any\r\n    of the great _Microscopes_. But because these, though exceeding easily\r\n    made, are yet very troublesome to be us’d, because of their smalness,\r\n    and the nearness of the Object; therefore to prevent both these, and\r\n    yet have only two Refractions, I provided me a Tube of Brass, shap’d\r\n    much like that in the fourth Figure of the first _Scheme_; into the\r\n    smaller end of this I fixt with Wax a good _plano convex_ Object Glass,\r\n    with the convex side towards the Object, and into the bigger end I fixt\r\n    also with wax a pretty large plano _Convex_ Glass, with the _convex_\r\n    side towards my eye, then by means of the small hole by the side, I\r\n    fill’d the intermediate space between these two Glasses with very clear\r\n    Water, and with a Screw stopp’d it in; then putting on a Cell for the\r\n    Eye, I could perceive an Object more bright then I could when the\r\n    intermediate space was only fill’d with Air, but this, for other\r\n    inconveniences, I made but little use of.\r\n\r\n    My way for fixing both the Glass and Object to the Pedestal most\r\n    conveniently was thus: Upon one side of a round Pedestal AB, in the\r\n    sixth Figure of the first _Scheme_, was fixt a small Pillar CC, on this\r\n    was fitted a small Iron Arm D, which could be mov’d up and down, and\r\n    fixt in any part of the Pillar, by means of a small Screw E; on the end\r\n    of this Arm was a small Ball fitted into a kind of socket F, made in\r\n    the side of the Brass Ring G, through which the small end of the Tube\r\n    was screw’d; by means of which contrivance I could place and fix the\r\n    Tube in what posture I desir’d (which for many Observations was\r\n    exceeding necessary) and adjusten it most exactly to any Object.\r\n\r\n    For placing the Object, I made this contrivance; upon the end of a\r\n    small brass Link or Staple HH, I so fastned a round Plate II, that it\r\n    might be turn’d round upon its Center K, and going pretty stiff, would\r\n    stand fixt in any posture it was set; on the side of this was fixt a\r\n    small Pillar P, about three quarters of an inch high, and through the\r\n    top of this was thrust a small Iron pin M, whose top just stood over\r\n    the Center of the Plate; on this top I fixt a small Object, and by\r\n    means of these contrivances I was able to turn it into all kind of\r\n    positions, both to my Eye and the Light; for by moving round the small\r\n    Plate on its center, could move it one way, and by turning the Pin M, I\r\n    could move it another way, and this without stirring the Glass at all,\r\n    or at least but very little; the Plate likewise I could move to and fro\r\n    to any part of the Pedestal (which in many cases was very convenient)\r\n    and fix it also in any Position, by means of a Nut N, which was screw’d\r\n    on upon the lower part of the Pillar CC. All the other Contrivances are\r\n    obvious enough from the draught, and will need no description.\r\n\r\nNow though this were the Instrument I made most use of, yet I have made\r\nseveral other Tryals with other kinds of Microscopes, which both for\r\n_matter_ and _form_ were very different from common spherical Glasses. I\r\nhave made a _Microscope_ with one piece of Glass, both whose surfaces were\r\n_plains_. I have made another only with a _plano concave_, without any kind\r\nof reflection, divers also by means of _reflection_. I have made others of\r\n_Waters_, _Gums_, _Resins_, _Salts_, _Arsenick_, _Oyls_, and with divers\r\nother _mixtures of watery_ and _oyly Liquors_. And indeed the subject is\r\ncapable of a great variety; but I find generally none more useful then that\r\nwhich is made with _two Glasses_, such as I have already describ’d.\r\n\r\nWhat the things are I observ’d, the following descriptions will manifest;\r\nin brief, they were either _exceeding small Bodies_, or _exceeding small\r\nPores_, or _exceeding small Motions_, some of each of which the Reader will\r\nfind in the following Notes, and such, as I presume, (many of them at\r\nleast) will be _new_, and perhaps not less _strange_: Some _specimen_ of\r\neach of which Heads the Reader will find in the subsequent delineations,\r\nand indeed of some more then I was willing there should be; which was\r\noccasioned by my first Intentions to print a much greater number then I\r\nhave since found time to compleat. Of such therefore as I had, I selected\r\nonly some few of every Head, which for some particulars seem’d most\r\nobservable, rejecting the rest as superfluous to the present Design.\r\n\r\nWhat each of the delineated Subjects are, the following descriptions\r\nannext to each will inform, of which I shall here, only once for all, add,\r\nThat in divers of them the Gravers have pretty well follow’d my directions\r\nand draughts; and that in making of them, I indeavoured (as far as I was\r\nable) first to discover the true appearance, and next to make a plain\r\nrepresentation of it. This I mention the rather, because of these kind of\r\nObjects there is much more difficulty to discover the true shape, then of\r\nthose visible to the naked eye, the same Object seeming quite differing, in\r\none position to the Light, from what it really is, and may be discover’d in\r\nanother. And therefore I never began to make any draught before by many\r\nexaminations in several lights, and in several positions to those lights, I\r\nhad discover’d the true form. For it is exceeding difficult in some\r\nObjects, to distinguish between a _prominency_ and a _depression_, between\r\na _shadow_ and a _black stain_, or a _reflection_ and a _whiteness in the\r\ncolour_. Besides, the transparency of most Objects renders them yet much\r\nmore difficult then if they were _opacous_. The Eyes of a Fly in one kind\r\nof light appear almost like a Lattice, drill’d through with abundance of\r\nsmall holes; which probably may be the Reason, why the Ingenious _Dr.\r\nPower_ seems to suppose them such. In the Sunshine they look like a Surface\r\ncover’d with golden Nails; in another posture, like a Surface cover’d with\r\nPyramids; in another with Cones; and in other postures of quite other\r\nshapes; but that which exhibits the best, is the Light collected on the\r\nObject, by those means I have already describ’d.\r\n\r\nAnd this was undertaken in prosecution of the Design which the _ROYAL\r\nSOCIETY_ has propos’d to it self. For the Members of the Assembly having\r\nbefore their eys so many _fatal_ Instances of the errors and falshoods, in\r\nwhich the greatest part of mankind has so long wandred, because they rely’d\r\nupon the strength of humane Reason alone, have begun anew to correct all\r\n_Hypotheses_ by sense, as Seamen do their _dead Reckonings_ by _Cœlestial\r\nObservations_; and to this purpose it has been their principal indeavour to\r\n_enlarge & strengthen_ the _Senses_ by _Medicine_, and by such _outward\r\nInstruments_ as are proper for their particular works. By this means they\r\nfind some reason to suspect, that those effects of Bodies, which have been\r\ncommonly attributed to _Qualities_, and those confess’d to be _occult_, are\r\nperform’d by the small _Machines_ of Nature, which are not to be discern’d\r\nwithout these helps, seeming the meer products of _Motion_, _Figure_, and\r\n_Magnitude_; and that the _Natural Textures_, which some call the _Plastick\r\nfaculty_, may be made in _Looms_, which a greater perfection of Opticks may\r\nmake discernable by these Glasses; so as now they are no more puzzled about\r\nthem, then the vulgar are to conceive, how _Tapestry_ or _flowred Stuffs_\r\nare woven. And the ends of all these Inquiries they intend to be the\r\n_Pleasure_ of Contemplative minds, but above all, the _ease and dispatch_\r\nof the labours of mens hands. They do indeed neglect no opportunity to\r\nbring all the _rare_ things of Remote Countries within the compass of their\r\nknowledge and practice. But they still acknowledg their _most useful_\r\nInformations to arise from _common_ things, and from _diversifying_ their\r\nmost _ordinary_ operations upon them. They do not wholly reject Experiments\r\nof meer _light_ and _theory_; but they principally aim at such, whose\r\nApplications will _improve and facilitate_ the present way of _Manual\r\nArts_. And though some men, who are perhaps taken up about less honourable\r\nEmployments, are pleas’d to censure their proceedings, yet they can shew\r\nmore _fruits_ of their first three years, wherein they have assembled, then\r\nany other _Society_ in _Europe_ can for a much larger space of time. ’Tis\r\ntrue, such undertakings as theirs do commonly meet with small\r\nincouragement, because men are generally rather taken with the _plausible_\r\nand _discursive_, then the _real_ and the solid part of Philosophy; yet by\r\nthe good fortune of their institution, in an Age of all others the most\r\n_inquisitive_, they have been assisted by the _contribution_ and _presence_\r\nof very many of the chief _Nobility_ and _Gentry_, and others who are some\r\nof the _most considerable_ in their several Professions. But that that yet\r\nfarther convinces me of the _Real esteem_ that the more _serious_ part of\r\nmen have of this _Society_, is, that several _Merchants_, men who act in\r\nearnest (whose Object is _meum & tuum_, that great _Rudder_ of humane\r\naffairs) have adventur’d considerable sums of _Money_, to put in practice\r\nwhat some of our Members have contrived, and have continued _stedfast_ in\r\ntheir good opinions of such Indeavours, when not one of a hundred of the\r\nvulgar have believed their undertakings feasable. And it is also fit to be\r\nadded, that they have one advantage peculiar to themselves, that very many\r\nof their number are _men of Converse and Traffick_; which is a good Omen,\r\nthat their attempts will bring Philosophy from _words_ to _action_, seeing\r\nthe men of Business have had so great a share in their first foundation.\r\n\r\nAnd of this kind I ought not to conceal one particular _Generosity_, which\r\nmore nearly concerns my self. It is the _munificence_ of _Sir John Cutler_,\r\nin endowing a Lecture for the promotion of _Mechanick Arts_, to be governed\r\nand directed by This _Society._This _Bounty_ I mention for the\r\n_Honourableness_ of the thing it self, and for the expectation which I have\r\nof the _efficacy_ of the _Example_; for it cannot now be objected to them,\r\nthat their Designs will be esteemed _frivolous_ and _vain_, when they have\r\nsuch a _real Testimony_ of the _Approbation_ of a _Man_ that is such an\r\n_eminent Ornament_ of this renowned City, and one, who, by the _Variety_,\r\nand the _happy Success_, of his negotiations, has given evident proofs,\r\nthat he is not easie to be deceiv’d. This Gentleman has well observ’d, that\r\nthe _Arts_ of life have been too long _imprison’d_ in the dark shops of\r\nMechanicks themselves, & there _hindred from growth_, either by ignorance,\r\nor self-interest: and he has bravely _freed_ them from these\r\n_inconveniences_: He hath not only obliged _Tradesmen_, but _Trade_ it\r\nself: He has done a work that is worthy of _London_, and has taught the\r\nchief City of Commerce in the world the right way how Commerce is to be\r\nimprov’d. We have already seen many other great signs of Liberality and a\r\nlarge mind, from the same hand: For by his _diligence_ about the\r\n_Corporation for the Poor_; by his honorable _Subscriptions_ for the\r\nrebuilding of St. Paul’s; by his chearful _Disbursment_ for the replanting\r\nof _Ireland_, and by many other such _publick works_, he has shewn by what\r\nmeans he indeavours to _establish_ his Memory; and now by this last gift he\r\nhas done that, which became one of the _wisest Citizens_ of our Nation to\r\naccomplish, seeing one of the _wisest of our Statesmen, the Lord Verulam_,\r\nfirst propounded it.\r\n\r\nBut to return to my Subject, from a digression, which, I hope, my Reader\r\nwill pardon me, seeing the Example is so rare that I can make no more such\r\ndigressions. If these my first Labours shall be any wayes useful to\r\ninquiring men, I must attribute the incouragement and promotion of them to\r\na very _Reverend_ and _Learned Person_, of whom this ought in justice to be\r\nsaid, _That there is scarce any one Invention, which this Nation has\r\nproduc’d in our Age, but it has some way or other been set forward by his\r\nassistance_. My Reader, I believe, will quickly ghess, that it is _Dr.\r\nWilkins_ that I mean. He is indeed a man born for the _good_ of _mankind_,\r\nand for the _honour_ of his _Country_. In the _sweetness_ of whose\r\n_behaviour_, in the _calmness_ of his _mind_, in the _unbounded goodness_\r\nof his _heart_, we have an evident Instance, what the true and the\r\n_primitive unpassionate Religion_ was, before it was _sowred_ by particular\r\n_Factions._ In a word, his _Zeal_ has been so _constant_ and _effectual_ in\r\nadvancing all good and profitable _Arts, that_ as one of the Antient\r\n_Romans_ said of _Scipio_, _That he thanked God that he was a _Roman_;\r\nbecause whereever _Scipio_ had been born, there had been the seat of the\r\nEmpire of the world_: So may I thank God, that _Dr. Wilkins_ was an\r\n_Englishman_, for whereever he had lived, there had been the chief Seat of\r\n_generous Knowledge_ and _true Philosophy_. To the truth of this, there are\r\nso many worthy men living that will subscribe, that I am confident, what I\r\nhave here said, will not be looked upon, by any ingenious Reader, as a\r\n_Panegyrick_, but only as a _real testimony_.\r\n\r\nBy the Advice of this _Excellent man_ I first set upon this Enterprise,\r\nyet still came to it with much _Reluctancy_, because I was to follow the\r\nfootsteps of so eminent a Person as _Dr. Wren_, who was the first that\r\nattempted any thing of this nature; whose original draughts do now make one\r\nof the Ornaments of that great Collection of Rarities in the _Kings\r\nCloset_. This _Honor_, which his first beginnings of this kind have\r\nreceiv’d, to be admitted into the most famous place of the world, did not\r\nso much _incourage_, as the _hazard_ of coming after _Dr. Wren_ did\r\n_affright_ me; for of him I must affirm, that, since the time of\r\n_Archimedes_, there scarce ever met in one man, in so great a perfection,\r\nsuch a _Mechanical Hand_, and so _Philosophical_ a _Mind_.\r\n\r\nBut at last, being assured both by _Dr. Wilkins_, and _Dr. Wren_ himself,\r\nthat he had given over his intentions of prosecuting it, and not finding\r\nthat there was any else design’d the pursuing of it, I set upon this\r\nundertaking, and was not a little incourag’d to proceed in it, by the\r\nHonour the _Royal Society_ was pleas’d to favour me with, in approving of\r\nthose draughts (which from time to time as I had an opportunity of\r\ndescribing) I presented to them. And particularly by the Incitements of\r\ndivers of those Noble and excellent Persons of it, which were my more\r\nespecial Friends, who were not less urgent with me for the publishing, then\r\nfor the prosecution of them.\r\n\r\nAfter I had almost compleated these Pictures and Observations (having had\r\ndivers of them engraven, and was ready to send them to the Press) I was\r\ninform’d, that the Ingenious Physitian _Dr. Henry Power_ had made several\r\n_Microscopical_ Observations, which had I not afterwards, upon our\r\ninterchangably viewing each others Papers, found that they were for the\r\nmost part differing from mine, either in the Subject it self, or in the\r\nparticulars taken notice of; and that his design was only to print\r\nObservations without Pictures, I had even then _suppressed_ what I had so\r\nfar proceeded in. But being further _excited_ by several of my Friends, in\r\ncompliance with their opinions, that it would not be unacceptable to\r\nseveral inquisitive Men, and hoping also, that I should thereby discover\r\nsomething New to the World, I have at length cast in my Mite, into the vast\r\nTreasury of _A Philosophical History_. And it is my _hope_, as well as\r\n_belief_, that these my _Labours_ will be no more comparable to the\r\n_Productions_ of many other _Natural Philosophers_, who are now every where\r\nbusie about _greater_ things; then my _little Objects_ are to be compar’d\r\nto the greater and more beautiful _Works of Nature_, A Flea, a Mite, a\r\nGnat, to an Horse, an Elephant, or a Lyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROGRAPHIA,\r\n\r\nOR SOME\r\n\r\nPhysiological Descriptions\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nMINUTE BODIES,\r\n\r\nMADE BY\r\n\r\nMAGNIFYING GLASSES;\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS and INQUIRIES thereupon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. I. _Of the Point of a sharp small Needle._\r\n\r\nAs in _Geometry_, the most natural way of beginning is from a Mathematical\r\n_point_; so is the same method in Observations and _Natural history_ the\r\nmost genuine, simple, and instructive. We must first endevour to make\r\n_letters_, and draw _single_ strokes true, before we venture to write whole\r\n_Sentences_, or to draw large _Pictures_. And in _Physical_ Enquiries, we\r\nmust endevour to follow Nature in the more _plain_ and _easie_ ways she\r\ntreads in the most _simple_ and _uncompounded bodies_, to trace her steps,\r\nand be acquainted with her manner of walking there, before we venture our\r\nselves into the multitude of _meanders_ she has in _bodies of a more\r\ncomplicated_ nature; lest, being unable to distinguish and judge of our\r\nway, we quickly lose both _Nature_ our Guide, and _our selves_ too, and are\r\nleft to wander in the _labyrinth_ of groundless opinions; wanting both\r\n_judgment_, that _light_, and _experience_, that _clew_, which should\r\ndirect our proceedings.\r\n\r\nWe will begin these our Inquiries therefore with the Observations of Bodies\r\nof the most _simple nature_ first, and so gradually proceed to those of a\r\nmore _compounded_ one. In prosecution of which method, we shall begin with\r\na _Physical point_; of which kind the _Point of a Needle_ is commonly\r\nreckon’d for one; and is indeed, for the most part, made so sharp, that the\r\nnaked eye cannot distinguish any parts of it: It very easily pierces, and\r\nmakes its way through all kind of bodies softer then it self: But if view’d\r\nwith a very good _Microscope_, we may find that the _top_ of a Needle\r\n(though as to the sense very _sharp_) appears a _broad_, _blunt_, and very\r\n_irregular_ end; not resembling a Cone, as is imagin’d, but onely a piece\r\nof a tapering body, with a great part of the top remov’d, or deficient. The\r\nPoints of Pins are yet more blunt, and the Points of the most curious\r\nMathematical Instruments do very seldome arrive at so great a sharpness;\r\nhow much therefore can be built upon demonstrations made onely by the\r\nproductions of the Ruler and Compasses, he will be better able to consider\r\nthat shall but view those _points_ and _lines_ with a _Microscope_.\r\n\r\nNow though this point be commonly accounted the sharpest (whence when we\r\nwould express the sharpness of a point the most _superlatively_, we say, As\r\nsharp as a Needle) yet the _Microscope_ can afford us hundreds of Instances\r\nof Points many thousand times sharper: such as those of the _hairs_, and\r\n_bristles_, and _claws_ of multitudes of _Insects_; the _thorns_, or\r\n_crooks_, or _hairs_ of _leaves_, and other small vegetables; nay, the ends\r\nof the _stiriæ_ or small _parallelipipeds_ of _Amianthus_, and _alumen\r\nplumosum_; of many of which, though the Points are so sharp as not to be\r\nvisible, though view’d with a _Microscope_ (which magnifies the Object, in\r\nbulk, above a million of times) yet I doubt not, but were we able\r\n_practically_ to make _Microscopes_ according to the _theory_ of them, we\r\nmight find hills, and dales, and pores, and a sufficient bredth, or\r\nexpansion, to give all those parts elbow-room, even in the blunt top of the\r\nvery Point of any of these so very sharp bodies. For certainly the\r\n_quantity_ or extension of any body may be _Divisible in infinitum_, though\r\nperhaps not the _matter_.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed: The Image we have here exhibited in the first\r\nFigure[1], was the top of a small and very sharp Needle, whose point\r\n_aa_ nevertheless appear’d through the _Microscope_ above a quarter\r\nof an inch broad, not round nor flat, but _irregular_ and _uneven_;\r\nso that it seem’d to have been big enough to have afforded a hundred\r\narmed Mites room enough to be rang’d by each other without endangering\r\nthe breaking one anothers necks, by being thrust off on either side.\r\nThe surface of which, though appearing to the naked eye very smooth,\r\ncould not nevertheless hide a multitude of holes and scratches and\r\nruggednesses from being discover’d by the _Microscope_ to invest it,\r\nseveral of which inequalities (as A, B, C, seem’d _holes_ made by some\r\nsmall specks of _Rust_; and D some _adventitious body_, that stuck very\r\nclose to it) were _casual_. All the rest that roughen the surface,\r\nwere onely so many marks of the rudeness and bungling of _Art_. So\r\nunaccurate is it, in all its productions, even in those which seem most\r\nneat, that if examin’d with an organ more acute then that by which\r\nthey were made, the more we see of their _shape_, the less appearance\r\nwill there be of their _beauty_: whereas in the works of _Nature_,\r\nthe deepest Discoveries shew us the greatest Excellencies. An evident\r\nArgument, that he that was the Author of all these things, was no other\r\nthen _Omnipotent_; being able to include as great a variety of parts\r\nand contrivances in the yet smallest Discernable Point, as in those\r\nvaster bodies (which comparatively are called also Points) such as the\r\n_Earth_, _Sun_, or _Planets_. Nor need it seem strange that the Earth\r\nit self may be by an _Analogie_ call’d a Physical Point: For as its\r\nbody, though now so near us as to fill our eys and fancies with a sense\r\nof the vastness of it, may by a little Distance, and some convenient\r\n_Diminishing_ Glasses, be made vanish into a scarce visible Speck, or\r\nPoint (as I have often try’d on the _Moon_, and (when not too bright)\r\non the _Sun_ it self.) So, could a Mechanical contrivance succesfully\r\nanswer our _Theory_, we might see the least spot as big as the Earth\r\nit self; and Discover, as _Des Cartes_[2] also conjectures, as great a\r\nvariety of bodies in the _Moon_, or _Planets_, as in the _Earth_.\r\n\r\nBut leaving these Discoveries to future Industries, we shall proceed to add\r\none Observation more of a _point_ commonly so call’d, that is, the mark of\r\na _full stop_, or _period_. And for this purpose I observed many both\r\n_printed_ ones and _written_; and among multitudes I found _few_ of them\r\nmore _round_ or _regular_ then this which I have delineated in the third\r\nfigure of the second Scheme, but _very many_ abundantly _more disfigur’d_;\r\nand for the most part if they seem’d equally round to the eye, I found\r\nthose points that had been made by a _Copper-plate_, and Roll-press, to be\r\nas misshapen as those which had been made with _Types_, the most curious\r\nand smothly _engraven strokes_ and _points_, looking but as so many\r\n_furrows_ and _holes_, and their _printed impressions_, but like _smutty\r\ndaubings_ on a matt or uneven floor with a blunt extinguisht brand or\r\nstick’s end. And as for _points_ made with a _pen_ they were much _more\r\nragged_ and _deformed_. Nay, having view’d certain pieces of exceeding\r\ncurious writing of the kind (one of which in the bredth of a _two-pence_\r\ncompris’d _the Lords prayer, the Apostles Creed, the ten Commandments, and\r\nabout half a dozen verses besides of the Bible_, whose _lines_ were _so\r\nsmall_ and _near together_, that I was unable to _number_ them with my\r\n_naked eye_,) a very ordinary _Microscope_, I had then about me, inabled me\r\nto see that what the Writer of it had asserted was _true_, but withall\r\ndiscover’d of what pitifull _bungling scribbles_ and _scrawls_ it was\r\ncompos’d, _Arabian_ and _China characters_ being almost as well shap’d, yet\r\nthus much I must say for the Man, that it was for the most part _legible_\r\nenough, though in some places there wanted a good _fantsy_ well _preposest_\r\nto help one through. If this manner _of small writing_ were made _easie_\r\nand _practicable_ (and I think I know such a one, but have never yet made\r\ntryal of it, whereby one might be inabled to write _a great deale_ with\r\n_much ease_, and _accurately_ enough in a very _little roome_) it might be\r\nof very good use to convey _secret Intelligence_ without any danger of\r\n_Discovery_ or _mistrusting_. But to come again to the point. The\r\n_Irregularities_ of it are caused by three or four _coadjutors_, one of\r\nwhich is, the _uneven surface_ of the _paper_, which at best appears no\r\nsmother then a very course piece of _shag’d cloth_, next the _irregularity\r\nof the Type_ or _Ingraving_, and a third is the _rough Daubing_ of the\r\n_Printing-Ink_ that lies upon the instrument that makes the impression, to\r\nall which, add the _variation_ made by the Different _lights_ and\r\n_shadows_, and you may have sufficient reason to ghess that a _point_ may\r\nappear much more _ugly_ then _this_, which I have here presented, which\r\nthough it appear’d through the _Microscope_ _gray_, like a great splatch of\r\n_London_ dirt, about three inches over; yet to the _naked eye_ it was\r\n_black_ and no bigger then that in the midst of the Circle A. And could I\r\nhave found Room in this Plate to have inserted an O you should have seen\r\nthat the _letters_ were not more distinct then the _points_ of Distinction,\r\nnor a _drawn circle_ more exactly _so_, then we have now shown a _point_ to\r\nbe a _point_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. II. _Of the Edge of a Razor._\r\n\r\nThe sharpest _Edge_ hath the same kind of affinity to the sharpest _Point_\r\nin Physicks, as a _line_ hath to a _point_ in Mathematicks; and therefore\r\nthe Treaty concerning this, may very properly be annexed to the former. A\r\nRazor doth appear to be a Body of a very neat and curious aspect, till more\r\nclosely viewed by the _Microscope_, and there we may observe its very Edge\r\nto be of all kind of shapes, except what it should be. For examining that\r\nof a very sharp one, I could not find that any part of it had any thing of\r\nsharpness in it; but it appeared a rough surface of a very considerable\r\nbredth from side to side, the narrowest part not seeming thinner then the\r\nback of a pretty thick Knife. Nor is’t likely that it should appear any\r\notherwise, since as we just now shew’d that a _point_ appear’d a _circle_,\r\n’tis rational a _line_ should be a _parallelogram_.\r\n\r\nNow for the drawing this second Figure[3] (which represents a part of the\r\nEdge about half a quarter of an inch long of a Razor well set) I so plac’d\r\nit between the Object-glass & the light, that there appear’d a reflection\r\nfrom the very Edge, represented by the white line abcdef. In which you may\r\nperceive it to be somewhat sharper then elsewhere about d, to be indented\r\nor pitted about b, to be broader and thicker about c, and unequal and\r\nrugged about e, and pretty even between ab and ef. Nor was that part of the\r\nEdge ghik so smooth as one would imagine so smooth bodies as a Hone and Oyl\r\nshould leave it; for besides those multitudes of scratches, which appear to\r\nhave raz’d the surface ghik, and to cross each other every way which are\r\nnot half of them exprest in the Figure, there were several great and deep\r\nscratches, or furrows, such as gh and ik, which made the surface yet more\r\nrugged, caus’d perhaps by some small Dust casually falling on the Hone, or\r\nsome harder or more flinty part of the Hone it self. The other part of the\r\nRazor ll, which is polish’d on a grinding-stone, appear’d much rougher then\r\nthe other, looking almost like a plow’d field, with many parallels, ridges,\r\nand furrows, and a cloddy, as ’twere, or an uneven surface: nor shall we\r\nwonder at the roughnesses of those surfaces, since even in the most curious\r\nwrought Glasses for _Microscopes_, and other Optical uses, I have, when the\r\nSun has shone well on them, discover’d their surface to be variously raz’d\r\nor scratched, and to consist of an infinite of small broken surfaces, which\r\nreflect the light of very various and differing colours. And indeed it\r\nseems impossible by Art to cut the surface of any hard and brittle body\r\nsmooth, since _Putte_, or even the most curious _Powder_ that can be made\r\nuse of, to polish such a body, must consist of little hard rough particles,\r\nand each of them must cut its way, and consequently leave some kind of\r\ngutter or furrow behind it. And though Nature does seem to do it very\r\nreadily in all kinds of fluid bodies, yet perhaps future observators may\r\ndiscover even these also rugged; it being very probable, as I elsewhere\r\nshew, that fluid bodies are made up of small solid particles variously and\r\nstrongly mov’d, and may find reason to think there is scarce a surface _in\r\nrerum naturâ_ perfectly smooth. The black spot mn, I ghess to be some small\r\nspeck of rust, for that I have oft observ’d to be the manner of the working\r\nof Corrosive Juyces. To conclude, this Edge and piece of a Razor, if it had\r\nbeen really such as it appear’d through the _Microscope_, would scarcely\r\nhave serv’d to cleave wood, much less to have cut off the hair of beards,\r\nunless it were after the manner that _Lucian_ merrily relates _Charon_ to\r\nhave made use of, when with a Carpenters Axe he chop’d off the beard of a\r\nsage Philosopher, whose gravity he very cautiously fear’d would indanger\r\nthe oversetting of his Wherry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. III. _Of fine Lawn, or Linnen Cloth._\r\n\r\nThis is another product of Art, A piece of the finest Lawn I was able to\r\nget, so curious that the threads were scarce discernable by the naked eye,\r\nand yet through an ordinary _Microscope_ you may perceive[4] what a goodly\r\npiece of _coarse Matting_ it is; what proportionable cords each of its\r\nthreads are, being not unlike, both in shape and size, the bigger and\r\ncoarser kind of _single Rope-yarn_, wherewith they usually make _Cables_.\r\nThat which makes the Lawn so transparent, is by the _Microscope_, nay by\r\nthe naked eye, if attentively viewed, plainly enough evidenced to be the\r\nmultitude of square holes which are left between the threads, appearing to\r\nhave much more hole in respect of the intercurrent parts then is for the\r\nmost part left in a _lattice-window_, which it does a little resemble,\r\nonely the crossing parts are round and not flat.\r\n\r\nThese threads that compose this fine contexture, though they are as small\r\nas those that constitute the finer sorts of Silks, have notwithstanding\r\nnothing of their glossie, pleasant, and lively reflection. Nay, I have been\r\ninformed both by the Inventor himself, and several other eye-witnesses,\r\nthat though the flax, out of which it is made, has been (by a singular art,\r\nof that excellent Person, and Noble Virtuoso, M. _Charls Howard_, brother\r\nto the _Duke of Norfolk_) so curiously dress’d and prepar’d, as to appear\r\nboth to the eye and the touch, full as _fine_ and as _glossie_, and to\r\nreceive all kinds of colours, as well as Sleave-Silk; yet when this Silken\r\nFlax is twisted into threads, it quite loseth its former luster, and\r\nbecomes as plain and base a thread to look on, as one of the same bigness,\r\nmade of common Flax.\r\n\r\nThe reason of which odd _Phenomenon_ seems no other then this; that though\r\nthe curiously drest Flax has its parts so exceedingly small, as to\r\nequallize, if not to be much smaller then the clew of the Silk-worm,\r\nespecially in thinness, yet the differences between the figures of the\r\nconstituting filaments are so great, and their substances so various, that\r\nwhereas those of the _Silk_ are _small_, _round_, _hard_, _transparent_,\r\nand to their bigness proportionably _stiff_, so as each filament preserves\r\nits proper _Figure_, and consequently its vivid _reflection_ intire, though\r\ntwisted into a thread, if not too hard; those of Flax are _flat_, _limber_,\r\n_softer_, and _less transparent_, and in twisting into a thread they joyn,\r\nand lie so close together, as to lose their own, and destroy each others\r\nparticular reflections. There seems therefore three Particulars very\r\nrequisite to make the so drest Flax appear Silk also when spun into\r\nthreads. First, that the substance of it should be made more _clear_ and\r\n_transparent_, Flax retaining in it a kind of opacating brown, or yellow;\r\nand the parts of the whitest kind I have yet observ’d with the _Microscope_\r\nappearing white, like flaw’d Horn or Glass, rather then clear, like clear\r\nHorn or Glass. Next that, the filaments should each of them be _rounded_,\r\nif that could be done, which yet is not so very necessary, if the first be\r\nperform’d, and this third, which is, that each of the small filaments be\r\n_stifned_; for though they be square, or flat, provided they be\r\n_transparent_ and stiff, much the same appearances must necessarily follow.\r\nNow, though I have not yet made trial, yet I doubt not, but that both these\r\nproprieties may be also induc’d upon the Flax, and perhaps too by one and\r\nthe same Expedient, which some trials may quickly inform any ingenious\r\nattempter of, who from the use and profit of such an Invention, may find\r\nsufficient argument to be prompted to such Inquiries. As for the _tenacity_\r\nof the substance of Flax, out of which the thread is made, it seems much\r\ninferiour to that of Silk, the one being a _vegetable_, the other an\r\n_animal_ substance. And whether it proceed from the better concoction, or\r\nthe more homogeneous constitution of _animal_ substances above those of\r\n_vegetables_, I do not here determine; yet since I generally find, that\r\n_vegetable_ substances do not equalize the _tenacity_ of _animal_, nor\r\nthese the _tenacity_ of some purified _mineral_ substances; I am very apt\r\nto think, that the _tenacity_ of bodies does not proceed from the _hamous_,\r\nor _hooked_ particles, as the _Epicureans_ and some modern _Philosophers_\r\nhave imagin’d; but from the more exact _congruity_ of the constituent\r\nparts, which are contiguous to each other, and so bulky, as not to be\r\neasily separated, or shatter’d, by any small pulls or concussion of heat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. IV. _Of fine waled Silk, or Taffety._\r\n\r\nThis[5] is the appearance of a piece of very fine Taffety-riband in the\r\nbigger magnifying Glass, which you see exhibits it like a very convenient\r\nsubstance to make Bed-matts, or Door-matts of, or to serve for Beehives,\r\nCorn-scuttles, Chairs, or Corn-tubs, it being not unlike that kind of work,\r\nwherewith in many parts in _England_, they make such Utensils of Straw, a\r\nlittle wreathed, and bound together with thongs of Brambles. For in this\r\nContexture, each little filament, fiber, or clew of the Silk-worm, seem’d\r\nabout the bigness of an ordinary Straw, as appears by the little irregular\r\npieces, ab, cd, and ef; The _Warp_, or the thread that ran crossing the\r\nRiband, appear’d like a single Rope of an Inch Diameter; but the _Woof_, or\r\nthe thread that ran the length of the Riband, appear’d not half so big.\r\nEach Inch of six-peny-broad Riband appearing no less then a piece of\r\nMatting Inch and half thick, and twelve foot square, a few yards of this,\r\nwould be enough to floor the long Gallery of the _Loure_ at _Paris_. But to\r\nreturn to our piece of Riband: It affords us a not unpleasant object,\r\nappearing like a bundle, or wreath, of very clear and transparent\r\n_Cylinders_, if the Silk be white, and curiously ting’d; if it be colour’d,\r\neach of those small horney _Cylinders_ affording in some place or other of\r\nthem, as vivid a reflection, as if it had been sent from a _Cylinder_ of\r\nGlass or Horn. Insomuch, that the reflections of Red, appear’d as if\r\ncoming from so many _Granates_, or _Rubies_. The loveliness of the colours\r\nof Silks above those of hairy Stuffs, or Linnen, consisting, as I\r\nelse-where intimate, chiefly in the transparency, and vivid reflections\r\nfrom the _Concave_, or inner surface of the _transparent Cylinder_, as are\r\nalso the colours of Precious Stones; for most of the reflections from each\r\nof these _Cylinders_, come from the _Concave_ surface of the air, which is\r\nas ’twere the foil that incompasses the _Cylinder_. The colours with which\r\neach of these _Cylinders_ are ting’d, seem partly to be superficial, and\r\nsticking to the out-sides of them; and partly, to be imbib’d, or sunck into\r\nthe substance of them: for Silk, seeming to be little else then a dried\r\nthread of Glew, may be suppos’d to be very easily relaxt, and softened, by\r\nbeing steeped in warm, nay in cold, if penetrant, juyces or liquors. And\r\nthereby those tinctures, though they tinge perhaps but a small part of the\r\nsubstance, yet being so highly impregnated with the colour, as to be almost\r\nblack with it, may leave an impression strong enough to exhibite the\r\ndesir’d colour. A pretty kinde of artificial Stuff I have seen, looking\r\nalmost like transparent Parchment, Horn, or Ising-glass, and perhaps some\r\nsuch thing it may be made of, which being transparent, and of a glutinous\r\nnature, and easily mollified by keeping in water, as I found upon trial,\r\nhad imbib’d, and did remain ting’d with a great variety of very vivid\r\ncolours, and to the naked eye, it look’d very like the substance of the\r\nSilk. And I have often thought, that probably there might be a way found\r\nout, to make an artificial glutinous composition, much resembling, if not\r\nfull as good, nay better, then that Excrement, or whatever other substance\r\nit be out of which, the Silk-worm wire-draws his clew. If such a\r\ncomposition were found, it were certainly an easie matter to find very\r\nquick ways of drawing it out into small wires for use. I need not mention\r\nthe use of such an Invention, nor the benefit that is likely to accrue to\r\nthe finder, they being sufficiently obvious. This hint therefore, may, I\r\nhope, give some Ingenious inquisitive Person an occasion of making some\r\ntrials, which if successfull, I have my aim, and I suppose he will have no\r\noccasion to be displeas’d.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. V. _Of watered Silks, or Stuffs._\r\n\r\nThere are but few _Artificial_ things that are worth observing with a\r\n_Microscope_, and therefore I shall speak but briefly concerning them. For\r\nthe Productions of art are such rude mis-shapen things, that when view’d\r\nwith a _Microscope_, is little else observable, but their deformity. The\r\nmost curious Carvings appearing no better then those rude _Russian_ Images\r\nwe find mention’d in _Purchas_, where three notches at the end of a Stick,\r\nstood for a face. And the most smooth and burnish’d surfaces appear most\r\nrough and unpolisht: So that my first Reason why I shall add but a few\r\nobservations of them, is, their mis-shapen form; and the next, is their\r\nuselessness. For why should we trouble our selves in the examination of\r\nthat form or shape (which is all we are able to reach with a _Microscope_)\r\nwhich we know was design’d for no higher a use, then what we were able to\r\nview with our naked eye? Why should we endeavour to discover mysteries in\r\nthat which has no such thing in it? And like _Rabbins_ find out\r\n_Caballisms_, and _ænigmâs_ in the Figure, and placing of Letters, where no\r\nsuch thing lies hid: whereas in _natural_ forms there are some so small,\r\nand so curious, and their design’d business so far remov’d beyond the reach\r\nof our sight, that the more we magnify the object, the more excellencies\r\nand mysteries do appear; And the more we discover the imperfections of our\r\nsenses; and the Omnipotency and Infinite perfections of the great Creatour.\r\nI shall therefore onely add one or two Observations more _artificial_\r\nthings, and then come to the Treaty concerning such matters as are the\r\nProductions of a more curious Workman. One of these, shall be that of a\r\npiece of water’d Silk, represented in the second Figure of the third\r\n_Scheme_,[6] as it appear’d through the least magnifying Glass. _AB_\r\nsignifying the long way of the Stuff, and _CD_ the broad way. This Stuff,\r\nif the right side of it be looked upon, appears to the naked eye, all over\r\nso waved, undulated, or grain’d, with a curious, though irregular variety\r\nof brighter and darker parts, that it adds no small gracefulness to the\r\nGloss of it. It is so known a propriety, that it needs but little\r\nexplication, but it is observable, which perhaps everyone has not\r\nconsidered, that those parts which appear the darker part of the wave, in\r\none position to the light, in another appears the lighter, and the\r\ncontrary; and by this means the undulations become transient, and in a\r\ncontinual change, according as the position of the parts in respect of the\r\nincident beams of light is varied. The reason of which odd _phænomena_, to\r\none that has but diligently examin’d it even with his naked eye, will be\r\nobvious enough. But he that observes it with a _Microscope_, may more\r\neasily perceive what this _Proteus_ is, and how it comes to change its\r\nshape. He may very easily perceive, that it proceeds onely from the variety\r\nof the _Reflections_ of light, which is caus’d by the various _shape of the\r\nParticles_, or little protuberant parts of the thread that compose the\r\nsurface; and that those parts of the waves that appear the brighter, throw\r\ntowards the eye a multitude of small reflections of light, whereas the\r\ndarker scarce afford any. The reason of which reflection, the _Microscope_\r\nplainly discovers, as appears by the Figure. In which you may perceive,\r\nthat the brighter parts of the surface consist of an abundance of large and\r\nstrong reflections, denoted by a, a, a, a, a, &c. for the surfaces of those\r\nthreads that run the _long way_, are by the Mechanical process of watering,\r\n_creas’d_ or _angled_ in another kind of posture then they were by the\r\nweaving: for by the weaving they are onely _bent round_ the warping\r\nthreads; but by the watering, they are _bent with an angle, or elbow_, that\r\nis in stead of lying, or being bent _round_ the threads, as in the third\r\nFigure, a, a, a, a, a, are about b, b, b (b, b, b representing the ends, as\r\n’twere, of the cross threads, they are bent about) they are creas’d on the\r\ntop of those threads, with an _angle_, as in the fourth Figure, and that\r\nwith all imaginable variety; so that, whereas before they reflected the\r\nlight onely from one point of the round surface, as about c, c, c, they now\r\nwhen water’d, reflect the beams from more then half the whole surface, as\r\nde, de, de, and in other postures they return no reflections at all from\r\nthose surfaces. Hence in one posture they compose the brighter parts of the\r\nwaves, in another the darker. And these reflections are also varied,\r\naccording as the particular parts are variously bent. The reason of which\r\ncreasing we shall next examine; and here we must fetch our information from\r\nthe Mechanism or manner of proceeding in this operation; which, as I have\r\nbeen inform’d, is no other then this.\r\n\r\nThey double all the Stuff that is to be water’d, that is, they crease it\r\njust through the middle of it, the whole length of the piece, leaving the\r\nright side of the Stuff inward, and placing the two edges, or silvages just\r\nupon one another, and, as near as they can, place the wale so in the\r\ndoubling of it, that the wale of the one side may lie very near parallel,\r\nor even with the wale of the other; for the nearer that posture they lie,\r\nthe greater will the watering appear; and the more obliquely, or across to\r\neach other they lie, the smaller are the waves. Their way for folding it\r\nfor a great wale is thus: they take a Pin, and begin at one side of the\r\npiece in any wale, and so moving it towards the other side, thereby direct\r\ntheir hands to the opposite ends of the wale, and then, as near as they\r\ncan, place the two opposite ends of the same wale together, and so double,\r\nor fold the whole piece, repeating this enquiry with a Pin at every yard or\r\ntwo’s distance through the whole length; then they sprinkle it with water,\r\nand fold it the long-ways, placing between every fold a piece of Pastboard,\r\nby which means all the wrong side of the water’d Stuff becomes flat, and\r\nwith little wales, and the wales on the other side become the more\r\nprotuberant; whence the creasings or angular bendings of the wales become\r\nthe more perspicuous. Having folded it in this manner, they place it with\r\nan interjacent Pastboard into an hot Press, where it is kept very violently\r\nprest, till it be dry and stiff; by which means, the wales of either\r\ncontiguous sides leave their own impressions upon each other, as is very\r\nmanifest by the second Figure, where ’tis obvious enough, that the wale of\r\nthe piece ABCD runs parallel between the pricked lines ef, ef, ef, and as\r\nmanifest to discern the impressions upon these wales, left by those that\r\nwere prest upon them, which lying not exactly parallel with them, but a\r\nlittle athwart them, as is denoted by the lines of, oooo, gh, gh, gh,\r\nbetween which the other wales did lie parallel; they are so variously, and\r\nirregularly creas’d that being put into that shape when wet, and kept so\r\ntill they be drie, they so let each others threads, that the Moldings\r\nremain almost as long as the Stuff lasts.\r\n\r\nHence it may appear to any one that attentively considers the Figure, why\r\nthe parts of the wale a, a, a, a, a, a, should appear bright; and why the\r\nparts b, b, b, b, b, b, b, should appear shadowed, or dark; why some, as d,\r\nd, d, d, d, d, should appear partly light, and partly dark: the varieties\r\nof which reflections and shadows are the only cause of the appearance of\r\nwatering in Silks, or any other kind of Stuffs.\r\n\r\nFrom the variety of reflection, may also be deduc’d the cause why a small\r\nbreez or gale of wind ruffling the surface of a smooth water, makes it\r\nappear black; as also, on the other side, why the smoothing or burnishing\r\nthe surface of whitened Silver makes it look black; and multitudes of other\r\nphænomena might hereby be solv’d, which are too many to be here insisted\r\non.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. VI. _Of Small Glass Canes._\r\n\r\nThat I might be satisfi’d, whether it were not possible to make an\r\n_Artificial_ pore as _small_ as any _Natural_ I had yet found, I made\r\nseveral attempts with small _glass pipes_, melted in the flame of a Lamp,\r\nand then very _suddenly_ drawn out into a great length. And, by _that\r\nmeans_, without much difficulty, I was able to draw some almost as small as\r\na _Cobweb_, which yet, with the _Microscope_, I could plainly perceive[7]\r\nto be _perforated_, both by looking on the _ends_ of it, and by looking on\r\nit _against the light_ which was much the _easier way_ to determine whether\r\nit were solid or perforated; for, taking a small pipe of glass, and closing\r\none end of it, then filling it _half full_ of water, and holding it\r\n_against the light_, I could, by this means, very easily find what was the\r\n_differing aspect_ of a _solid_ and a _perforated_ piece of glass; and so\r\neasily distinguish, without seeing either end, whether any _Cylinder_ of\r\nglass I look’d on, were a _solid stick_, or a _hollow cane_. And by this\r\nmeans, I could also presently judge of any small _filament_ of glass,\r\nwhether it were _hollow_ or _not_, which would have been exceeding tedious\r\nto examine by looking on the end. And many such like ways I was fain to\r\nmake use of, in the examining of divers other particulars related in this\r\nBook, which would have been no easie task to have determined meerly by the\r\nmore common way of looking on, or viewing the Object. For, if we consider\r\nfirst, the very _faint light_ wherewith the object is enlightened, whence\r\nmany particles appear _opacous_, which when more enlightned, appear very\r\n_transparent_, so that I was fain to _determine_ its _transparency_ by one\r\nglass, and its _texture_ by another. Next, the _unmanageableness_ of most\r\n_Objects_, by reason of their _smalness_, 3. The _difficulty of finding_\r\nthe desired point, and of _placing_ it so, as to reflect the _light\r\nconveniently_ for the Inquiry. Lastly, ones being able to view it but with\r\n_one eye_ at once, they will appear no small _obstructions_, nor are they\r\neasily _remov’d_ without many _contrivances_. But to proceed, I could not\r\nfind that water, or some _deeply ting’d_ liquors would in small ones rise\r\nso high as one would expect; and the _highest_ I have found it yet rise in\r\nany of the pipes I have try’d, was to 21 _inches_ above the level of the\r\nwater in the vessel: for though I found that in the small pipes it would\r\n_nimbly enter_ at first, and run about 6 or 7 _inches_ upwards; yet I found\r\nit then to move upwards _so slow_, that I have not yet had the _patience_\r\nto observe it above that height of 21 _inches_ (and that was in a pretty\r\n_large Pipe_, in comparison of those I formerly mentioned; for I could\r\nobserve the _progress_ of a _very deep ting’d liquor_ in it with my _naked\r\neye_, without much trouble; whereas many of the _other pipes_ were so _very\r\nsmall_, that unless in a _convenient posture_ to the light, I could not\r\nperceive _them_:) But ’tis very probable, that a greater _patience_ and\r\n_assiduity_ may discover the liquors to _rise_, at least to remain\r\n_suspended_, at heights that I should be loath now even to _ghess_ at, if\r\nat least there be any _proportion_ kept between the height of the ascending\r\nliquor, and the _bigness of the holes_ of the pipes.\r\n\r\n_AN ATTEMPT FOR THE EXPLICATION OF THIS EXPERIMENT._\r\n\r\nMy Conjecture, _That the unequal height of the surfaces of the water,\r\nproceeded from the greater pressure made upon the water by the Air without\r\nthe Pipes_ ABC, _then by that within them_[8]; I shall endeavour to confirm\r\nfrom the truth of the two following _Propositions_:\r\n\r\nThe first of which is, _That an unequal pressure of the incumbent Air, will\r\ncause an unequal height in the water’s Surfaces_.\r\n\r\nAnd the second is, _That in this experiment there is such an unequal\r\npressure_.\r\n\r\nThat the first is true, the following _Experiment_ will evince. For if you\r\ntake any Vessel so contrived, as that you can at pleasure either _increase_\r\nor _diminish_ the _pressure_ of the Air upon this or that part of the\r\n_Superficies_ of the _water_, the _equality_ of the height of those parts\r\nwill presently be _lost_; and that part of the _Superficies_ that sustains\r\nthe _greater pressure_, will be _inferior_ to that which undergoes the\r\n_less_. A fit Vessel for this purpose, will be an inverted Glass _Syphon_,\r\nsuch an one as is described in the _Sixth Figure_. For if into it you put\r\nWater enough to fill it as high as _AB_, and gently blow in at _D_, you\r\nshall _depress_ the Superficies _B_, and thereby _raise_ the opposite\r\nSuperficies _A_ to a _considerable height_, and by gently _sucking_ you may\r\nproduce clean _contrary_ effects.\r\n\r\nNext, That there is such an _unequal pressure_, I shall prove from this,\r\n_That there is a much greater incongruity of Air to Glass, and some other\r\nBodies, then there is of Water to the same_.\r\n\r\nBy _Congruity, I mean a property of a fluid Body, whereby any part of it is\r\nreadily united with any other part, either of itself, or of any other\r\nSimilar, fluid, or solid body: And by Incongruity a property of a fluid, by\r\nwhich it is hindred from uniting with any dissimilar, fluid, or solid\r\nBody._\r\n\r\nThis last property, any one that hath been observingly conversant about\r\nfluid Bodies, cannot be ignorant of. For (not now to mention several\r\n_Chymical Spirits_ and _Oyls_, which will _very hardly_, if at _all_, be\r\nbrought to _mix_ with one another; insomuch that there may be found some 8\r\nor 9, or more, several distinct Liquors, which _swimming_ one upon another,\r\nwill not presently _mix_) we need seek no further for Examples of this kind\r\nin _fluids_, then to observe the _drops of rain_ falling through the _air_\r\nand the _bubbles of air_ which are by any means conveyed under the surface\r\nof the _water_; or a drop of common _Sallet-Oyl_ swimming upon water. In\r\nall which, and many more examples of this kind that might be enumerated,\r\nthe _incongruity_ of two _fluids_ is easily discernable. And as for the\r\n_Congruity_ or _Incongruity_ of Liquids, with several kinds of _firm_\r\nBodies, they have long since been taken notice of, and called by the Names\r\nof _Driness_ and _Moisture_ (though these two names are not comprehensive\r\nenough, being commonly used to signifie only the adhering or not adhering\r\nof _water_ to some other _solid Bodies_) of this kind we may observe that\r\n_water_ will more readily _wet some woods_ then _others_; and that _water_,\r\nlet fall upon a _Feather_, the whiter side of a _Colwort_, and some other\r\nleaves, or upon almost any _dusty_, _unctuous_, or _resinous_ superficies,\r\nwill not _at all adhere_ to them, but easily _tumble off_ from them, like a\r\nsolid _Bowl_; whereas, if dropt upon _Linnen_, _Paper_, _Clay_, _green\r\nWood_, &c. it will not be taken off, without leaving some part of it behind\r\n_adhering_ to them. So _Quick-silver_, which will very _hardly_ be brought\r\nto _stick_ to any _vegetable body_, will _readily adhere_ to, and _mingle_\r\nwith, several clean _metalline bodies_.\r\n\r\nAnd that we may the better finde what the _cause_ of _Congruity_ and\r\n_Incongruity_ in bodies is, it will be requisite to consider, First, what\r\nis the _cause_ of _fluidness_; And this, _I conceive_, to be nothing else\r\nbut a certain _pulse_ or _shake_ of _heat_; for Heat being nothing else but\r\na very _brisk_ and _vehement agitation_ of the parts of a body (as I have\r\nelswhere made _probable_) the parts of a body are thereby made so _loose_\r\nfrom one another, that they easily _move any way_, and become _fluid_. That\r\nI may explain this a little by a gross Similitude, let us suppose a dish of\r\nsand set upon some body that is very much _agitated_, and shaken with some\r\n_quick_ and _strong vibrating motion_, as on a _Milstone_ turn’d round upon\r\nthe under stone very violently whilst it is empty; or on a very stiff\r\n_Drum_-head, which is vehemently or very nimbly beaten with the Drumsticks.\r\nBy this means, the sand in the dish, which before lay like a _dull_ and\r\nunactive body, becomes a perfect _fluid_; and ye can no sooner make a\r\n_hole_ in it with your finger, but it is immediately _filled up again_, and\r\nthe upper surface of it _levell’d_. Nor can you _bury_ a _light body_, as a\r\npiece of Cork under it, but it presently _emerges_ or _swims_ as ’twere on\r\nthe top; nor can you lay a _heavier_ on the top of it, as a piece of Lead,\r\nbut it is immediately _buried_ in Sand, and (as ’twere) sinks to the\r\nbottom. Nor can you make a _hole_ in the side of the Dish, but the sand\r\nshall _run out_ of it to a _level_, not an _obvious property_ of a fluid\r\nbody, as such, but this dos _imitate_; and all this meerly caused by the\r\nvehement _agitation_ of the conteining vessel; for by this means, _each_\r\nsand becomes to have a _vibrative_ or _dancing_ motion, so as no other\r\nheavier body can _rest_ on it, unless _sustein’d_ by some other on either\r\nside: Nor will it suffer any Body to be _beneath_ it, unless it be a\r\n_heavier_ then it self. Another Instance of the strange _loosening_ nature\r\nof a violent jarring Motion, or a strong and nimble vibrative one, we may\r\nhave from a piece of _iron_ grated on very strongly with a _file_: for if\r\ninto that a pin _screw’d_ so firm and hard, that though it has a convenient\r\nhead to it, yet it can by no means be _unscrew’d_ by the fingers; if, I\r\nsay, you attempt to unscrew this whilst _grated on by the file_, it will be\r\nfound to undoe and turn very _easily_. The first of these Examples\r\nmanifests, how a body actually _divided_ into small parts, becomes a\r\n_fluid_. And the latter manifests by what means the agitation of heat so\r\neasily _loosens_ and _unties_ the parts of _solid_ and _firm_ bodies. Nor\r\nneed we suppose heat to be any thing else, besides such a motion; for\r\nsupposing we could _Mechanically_ produce such a one _quick_ and _strong_\r\nenough, we need not spend _fuel_ to _melt_ a body. Now, that I do not speak\r\nthis altogether groundless, I must refer the Reader to the Observations I\r\nhave made upon the shining sparks of Steel, for there he shall find that\r\n_the same_ effects are produced upon small chips or parcels of Steel by the\r\n_flame_, and by _a quick and violent motion_; and if the body of _steel_\r\nmay be thus melted (as I there shew it may) I think we have little reason\r\nto doubt that almost _any other_ may not also. Every Smith can inform one\r\nhow quickly both his _File_ and the _Iron_ grows _hot_ with _filing_, and\r\nif you _rub_ almost any two _hard_ bodies together, they will do the same:\r\nAnd we know, that a sufficient degree of heat causes _fluidity_, in some\r\nbodies much sooner, and in others later; that is, the parts of the body of\r\nsome are so _loose_ from one another, and so _unapt to cohere_, and so\r\n_minute_ and _little_, that a very _small_ degree of agitation keeps them\r\nalways in the _state of fluidity_. Of this kind, I suppose, the _Æther_,\r\nthat is the _medium_ or _fluid_ body, in which all other bodies do as it\r\nwere swim and move; and particularly, the _Air_, which seems nothing else\r\nbut a kind of _tincture_ or _solution_ of terrestrial and aqueous particles\r\n_dissolv’d_ into it, and agitated by it, just as the _tincture_ of\r\n_Cocheneel_ is nothing but some finer _dissoluble_ parts of that Concrete\r\nlick’d up or _dissolv’d_ by the _fluid_ water. And from this Notion of it,\r\nwe may easily give a more Intelligible reason how the Air becomes so\r\ncapable of _Rarefaction_ and _Condensation_. For, as in _tinctures_, one\r\ngrain of some _strongly tinging_ substance may _sensibly_ colour some\r\n_hundred thousand_ grains of _appropriated_ Liquors, so as every _drop_ of\r\nit has its proportionate share, and be sensibly ting’d, as I have try’d\r\nboth with _Logwood_ and _Cocheneel_: And as some few grains of _Salt_ is\r\nable to infect as great a quantity, as may be found by _præcipitations_,\r\nthough not so easily by the _sight_ or _taste_; so the _Air_, which seems\r\nto be but as ’twere a _tincture_ or _saline substance, dissolv’d and\r\nagitated by the fluid and agil Æther_, may disperse and _expand_ it self\r\ninto a _vast space_, if it have room enough, and infect, as it were, every\r\npart of that space. But, as on the other side, if there be but some _few\r\ngrains_ of the liquor, it may _extract all_ the colour of the tinging\r\nsubstance, and may _dissolve_ all the Salt, and thereby become _much more\r\nimpregnated_ with those substances, so may _all_ the air that sufficed in a\r\n_rarify’d state_ to fill some _hundred thousand_ spaces of Æther, be\r\ncompris’d in only _one_, but in a position proportionable _dense_. And\r\nthough we have not yet found out such _strainers_ for Tinctures and Salts\r\nas we have for the Air, being yet unable to _separate_ them from their\r\ndissolving liquors by any kind of _filtre_, without _præcipitation_, as we\r\nare able to _separate_ the Air from the Æther by _Glass_, and several other\r\nbodies. And though we are yet unable and ignorant of the ways of\r\n_præcipitating_ Air out of the Æther as we can Tinctures, and Salts out of\r\nseveral _dissolvents_; yet neither of these seeming _impossible_ from the\r\nnature of the things, nor so _improbable_ but that some happy future\r\nindustry may find out ways to effect them; nay, further, since we find that\r\nNature _does really perform_ (though by what means we are not certain) both\r\nthese actions, namely, by _præcipitating_ the Air in Rain and Dews, and by\r\nsupplying the Streams and Rivers of the World with fresh water, _strain’d_\r\nthrough secret subterraneous Caverns: And since, that in very many other\r\n_proprieties_ they do so exactly _seem_ of the _same nature_; till further\r\nobservations or tryals do inform us of the _contrary_, we may _safely\r\nenough conclude_ them of the _same kind_. For it seldom happens that any\r\ntwo natures have so many properties _coincident_ or the _same_, as I have\r\nobserv’d Solutions and Air to have, and to be _different_ in the rest. And\r\ntherefore I think it neither _impossible_, _irrational_, nay nor\r\n_difficult_ to be able to _predict_ what is _likely_ to happen in other\r\nparticulars also, besides those which _Observation_ or _Experiment_ have\r\ndeclared thus or thus; especially, if the _circumstances_ that do often\r\nvery much conduce to the variation of the effects be duly _weigh’d_ and\r\n_consider’d_. And indeed, were there not a _probability_ of this, our\r\n_inquiries_ would be _endless_, our _tryals vain_, and our greatest\r\n_inventions_ would be nothing but the meer _products_ of _chance_, and not\r\nof _Reason_; and, like _Mariners_ in an Ocean, destitute both of a\r\n_Compass_ and the sight of the _Celestial guides_, we might indeed, _by\r\nchance_, Steer _directly_ towards our desired Port, but ’tis _a thousand to\r\none_ but we _miss_ our aim. But to proceed, we may hence also give a plain\r\nreason, how the Air comes to be _darkned_ by _clouds_, &c. which are\r\nnothing but a kind of _precipitation_, and how those _precipitations_ fall\r\ndown in _Showrs_. Hence also could I very easily, and I think truly, deduce\r\nthe cause of the curious _sixangular figures_ of Snow, and the appearances\r\nof _Haloes, &c._ and the sudden _thickning_ of the Sky with Clouds, and the\r\n_vanishing_ and _disappearing_ of those Clouds again; for all these things\r\nmay be very easily _imitated_ in a _glass of liquor_, with some slight\r\n_Chymical preparations_ as I have often try’d, and may somewhere else more\r\nlargely relate, but have not now time to set them down. But to proceed,\r\nthere are other bodies that consist of particles more _Gross_, and of a\r\nmore _apt_ figure for _cohesion_, and this requires _somewhat greater_\r\nagitation; such, I suppose ☿, _fermented vinous_ _Spirits_, several\r\n_Chymical Oils_, which are much of kin to those Spirits, &c. Others yet\r\nrequire a _greater_, as _water_, and so others _much greater_, for almost\r\ninfinite degrees: For, I suppose there are very _few_ bodies in the world\r\nthat may not be made _aliquatenus_ fluid, by _some_ or _other_ degree of\r\nagitation or heat.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore in short set down my Notion of a Fluid body, I come in the\r\nnext place to consider what _Congruity_ is; and this, as I said before,\r\nbeing a _Relative property_ of a fluid, whereby it may be said to be _like_\r\nor _unlike_ to this or that other body, whereby it _does_ or _does not mix_\r\nwith this or that body. We will again have recourse to our former\r\nExperiment, though but a rude one; and here if we mix in the dish _several\r\nkinds_ of sands, some of _bigger_, others of _less_ and finer bulks, we\r\nshall find that by the agitation _the fine sand_ will _eject_ and _throw\r\nout_ of it self all those _bigger_ bulks of small _stones_ and the like,\r\nand those will _be gathered_ together all into _one_ place; and if there be\r\n_other_ bodies in it of other natures, those also will be _separated_ into\r\na place by themselves, and _united_ or _tumbled_ up together. And though\r\nthis do not come up to the _highest property_ of _Congruity_, which is a\r\n_Cohæsion_ of the parts of the fluid together, or a kind of _attraction_\r\nand _tenacity_, yet this does as ’twere _shadow_ it out, and somewhat\r\nresemble it; for just after the same manner, I suppose the _pulse_ of heat\r\nto _agitate_ the small parcels of matter, and those that are of a _like\r\nbigness_, and _figure_, and _matter_, will _hold_, or _dance_ together, and\r\nthose which are of a _differing_ kind will be _thrust_ or _shov’d_ out from\r\nbetween them; for particles that are _similar_, will, like so many _equal\r\nmusical strings equally stretcht_, vibrate together in a kind of _Harmony_\r\nor _unison_; whereas others that are _dissimilar_, upon what account\r\nsoever, unless the disproportion be otherwise counter-ballanc’d, will, like\r\nso many _strings out of tune_ to those unisons, though they have the same\r\nagitating _pulse_, yet make quite _differing_ kinds of _vibrations_ and\r\n_repercussions_, so that though they may be both mov’d, yet are their\r\n_vibrations_ so _different_, and so _untun’d_, as ’twere to each other,\r\nthat they _cross_ and _jar_ against each other, and consequently, _cannot\r\nagree_ together, but _fly back_ from each other to their similar particles.\r\nNow, to give you an instance how the _disproportion_ of some bodies in one\r\nrespect, may be _counter-ballanc’d_ by a _contrary disproportion_ of the\r\nsame body in another respect, whence we find that the subtil _vinous\r\nspirit_ is _congruous_, or does readily _mix_ with _water_, which in many\r\nproperties is of a very _differing nature_, we may consider that a _unison_\r\nmay be made either by two _strings_ of the same _bigness_, _length_, and\r\n_tension_, or by two strings of the same _bigness_, but of _differing\r\nlength_, and a _contrary differing tension_, or _3ly._ by two strings of\r\n_unequal length_ and _bigness_, and of a _differing tension_, or of _equal\r\nlength_, and _differing bigness_ and _tension_, and several other such\r\nvarieties. To which _three properties_ in _strings_, will correspond _three\r\nproprieties_ also in _sand_, or the _particles_ of bodies, their _Matter_\r\nor _Substance_, their _Figure_ or _Shape_, and their _Body_ or _Bulk_. And\r\nfrom the _varieties_ of these _three_, may arise _infinite varieties_ in\r\nfluid bodies, though all agitated by the _same pulse_ or _vibrative_\r\nmotion. And there may be as many ways of making Harmonies and Discords with\r\nthese, as there may be with _musical strings_. Having therefore seen what\r\nis the cause of Congruity or Incongruity, those relative properties of\r\nfluids, we may, from what has been said, very easily collect, what is the\r\n_reason_ of those Relative proprieties also between _fluid bodies_ and\r\n_solid_; for since all bodies consist of _particles_ of such a _Substance_,\r\n_Figure_, and _Bulk_; but in some they are _united_ together more _firmly_\r\nthen to be _loosened_ from each other by every _vibrative_ motion (though I\r\nimagine that there is no body in the world, but that some degree of\r\nagitation may, as I hinted before, agitate and loosen the particles so as\r\nto make them fluid) those _cohering_ particles may _vibrate_ in the same\r\nmanner almost as those that are _loose_ and become _unisons_ or _discords_,\r\nas I may so speak, to them. Now that the _parts_ of all _bodies_, though\r\nnever so _solid_, do yet _vibrate_, I think we need go no further for\r\nproof, then that _all_ bodies have some _degrees_ of _heat_ in them, and\r\nthat there has not been yet found any thing _perfectly cold_: Nor can I\r\nbelieve indeed that there is any such thing in Nature, as a body whose\r\nparticles are at _rest_, or _lazy_ and _unactive_ in the great _Theatre_ of\r\nthe _World_, it being quite _contrary_ to the grand _Oeconomy_ of the\r\nUniverse. We see therefore what is the reason of the _sympathy_ or uniting\r\nof some bodies together, and of the _antipathy_ or flight of others from\r\neach other: For _Congruity_ seems nothing else but a _Sympathy_, and\r\n_Incongruity_ an _Antipathy_ of bodies, hence _similar_ bodies once\r\n_united_ will not _easily part_, and _dissimilar_ bodies once _disjoyn’d_\r\nwill not _easily unite_ again; from hence may be very easily deduc’d the\r\nreason of the _suspension_ of _water_ and _Quick-silver_ above their usual\r\n_station_, as I shall more at large anon shew.\r\n\r\nThese properties therefore (alwayes the concomitants of fluid bodies)\r\nproduce these following visible _Effects_:\r\n\r\nFirst, They _unite_ the parts of a fluid to its _similar_ Solid, or keep\r\nthem _separate_ from its _dissimilar_. Hence _Quick-silver_ will (as we\r\nnoted before) _stick_ to _Gold_, _Silver_, _Tin_, _Lead_, &c. and _unite_\r\nwith them: but _roul_ off from _Wood_, _Stone_, _Glass_, &c. if never so\r\nlittle scituated out of its _horizontal level_; and _water_ that will _wet\r\nsalt_ and _dissolve_ it, will _slip_ off from _Tallow_, or the like,\r\nwithout at all _adhering_; as it may likewise be observed to do upon a\r\n_dusty_ superficies. And next they cause the parts of _homogeneal fluid_\r\nbodies readily to _adhere_ together and _mix_, and of _heterogeneal_, to be\r\nexceeding _averse_ thereunto. Hence we find, that _two_ small _drops_ of\r\n_water_, on any superficies they can roul on, will, if they chance to touch\r\neach other, _readily unite_ and _mix_ into one 3d _drop_: The like may be\r\nobserved with two small _Bowls_ of _Quick-silver_ upon a Table or Glass,\r\nprovided their surfaces be not _dusty_; and with two drops of _Oyl_ upon\r\nfair water, _&c._ And further, _water_ put unto _wine_, _salt water_,\r\n_vinegar_, _spirit_ of _wine_, or the like, does immediately (especially if\r\nthey be shaken together) _disperse_ it self all over them. Hence, on the\r\ncontrary, we also find, that _Oyl of Tartar_ poured upon _Quick-silver_,\r\nand _Spirit of Wine_ on that _Oyl_, and _Oyl of Turpentine_ on that\r\n_Spirit_, and _Air_ upon that _Oyl_, though they be stopt closely up into a\r\nBottle, and _shaken_ never so much, they will by no means long suffer any\r\nof their bigger parts to be _united_ or included within any of the other\r\nLiquors (by which recited Liquors, may be plainly enough represented the\r\nfour _Peripatetical Elements_, and the more subtil _Æther_ above all.) From\r\nthis property ’tis, that a drop of _water_ does not mingle with, or vanish\r\ninto _Air_, but is _driven_ (by that Fluid equally protruding it on every\r\nside) and forc’t into as little a space as it can possibly be contained in,\r\nnamely, into a _Round Globule_. So likewise a little _Air_ blown under the\r\n_water_, is _united_ or thrust into a _Bubble_ by the ambient water. And a\r\nparcel of _Quick-silver_ enclosed with _Air_, _Water_, or almost any other\r\n_Liquor_, is _formed_ into a _round Ball_.\r\n\r\nNow the cause why all these included Fluids, newly mentioned, or as many\r\nothers as are wholly included within a heterogeneous fluid, are not\r\n_exactly_ of a _Spherical Figure_ (seeing that if caused by these\r\nPrinciples only, it could be of no other) must proceed from some other kind\r\nof _pressure_ against the two opposite flatted sides. This _adventitious_\r\nor _accidental pressure_ may proceed from _divers causes_, and accordingly\r\nmust _diversifie_ the Figure of the included heterogeneous fluid: For\r\nseeing that a body may be included either with a fluid only, or only with a\r\nsolid, or partly with a fluid, and partly with a solid, or partly with one\r\nfluid, and partly with another; there will be found a very great variety of\r\nthe terminating _surfaces_, much differing from a _Spherical_, according to\r\nthe various resistance or pressure that belongs to each of these\r\nencompassing bodies.\r\n\r\nWhich Properties may in general be deduced from two heads, _viz._ _Motion_,\r\nand _Rest_. For, either this Globular Figure is altered by a _natural\r\nMotion_, such as is _Gravity_, or a _violent_, such as is any _accidental\r\nmotion_ of the fluids, as we see in the _wind_ ruffling up the water, and\r\nthe _purlings_ of _Streams_, and _foaming_ of _Catarracts_, and the like.\r\nOr thirdly, By the _Rest_, _Firmness_ and _Stability_ of the ambient\r\n_Solid_. For if the including _Solid_ be of an _angular_ or any other\r\n_irregular_ Form, the included _fluid_ will be near of the _like_, as a\r\nPint-_Pot_ full of _water_, or a _Bladder_ full of _Air_. And next, if the\r\nincluding or included fluid have a greater _gravity_ one than another, then\r\nwill the _globular_ Form be deprest into an _Elliptico-spherical_: As if,\r\nfor example, we suppose the Circle _ABCD_, in the _fourth Figure_, to\r\nrepresent a _drop of water_, _Quick-silver_, or the like, included with the\r\n_Air_ or the like, which supposing there were no _gravity_ at all in either\r\nof the _fluids_, or that the _contained_ and _containing_ were of the _same\r\nweight_, would be _equally comprest_ into an exactly _spherical_ body (the\r\nambient fluid _forcing equally_ against every side of it.) But supposing\r\neither a greater _gravity_ in the included, by reason whereof the parts of\r\nit being _prest_ from _A_ towards _B_, and thereby the whole put into\r\n_motion_, and that _motion_ being _hindred_ by the _resistance_ of the\r\n_subjacent_ parts of the ambient, the _globular_ Figure _ADBC_ will be\r\n_deprest_ into the _Elliptico-spherical_, _EGFH_. For the side _A_ is\r\n_detruded_ to _E_ by the _Gravity_, and _B_ to _F_ by the _resistance_ of\r\nthe subjacent medium: and therefore _C_ must necessarily be thrust to _G_;\r\nand _D_ to _H_. Or else, supposing a greater _gravity_ in the _ambient_, by\r\nwhose more then ordinary _pressure_ against the under side of the included\r\nglobule; _B_ will be forced to _F_, and by its _resistance_ of the motion\r\n_upwards_, the side _A_ will be _deprest_ to _E_, and therefore _C_ being\r\nthrust to _G_ and _D_ to _H_; the _globular_ Figure by this means also will\r\nbe made an _Elliptico-spherical_. Next if a fluid be included _partly_ with\r\none, and _partly_ with another fluid, it will be found to be shaped\r\n_diversly_, according to the proportion of the _gravity_ and _incongruity_\r\nof the 3 _fluids_ one to another: As in the _second Figure_, let the upper\r\n_MMM_ be _Air_, the middle _LMNO_ be common _Oyl_, the lower _OOO_ be\r\n_Water_, the _Oyl_ will be form’d, not into a _spherical_ Figure, such as\r\nis represented by the _pricked Line_, but into such a Figure as LMNO, whose\r\nside LMN will be of a flatter _Elliptical_ Figure, by reason of the great\r\ndisproportion between the _Gravity_ of _Oyl_ and _Air_, and the side LOM of\r\na rounder, because of the smaller difference between the weight of _Oyl_\r\nand _Water_. Lastly, The _globular_ Figure will be changed, if the\r\n_ambient_ be partly _fluid_ and partly _solid_. And here the termination of\r\nthe incompassed _fluid_ towards the incompassing is shap’d according to the\r\nproportion of the congruity or incongruity of the _fluids_ to the _solids_,\r\nand of the gravity and incongruity of the _fluids_ one to another. As\r\nsuppose the subjacent _medium_ that hinders an included fluids descent, be\r\na _solid_, as let KI, in the _fourth Figure_, represent the smooth\r\nsuperficies of a _Table_; EGFH, a parcel of _running Mercury_; the side GFH\r\nwill be more flatted, according to the proportion of the incongruity of the\r\n_Mercury_ and _Air_ to the _Wood_, and of the _gravity_ of _Mercury_ and\r\n_Air_ one to another; The side GEH will likewise be a little more deprest\r\nby reason the subjacent parts are now at rest, which were before in motion.\r\n\r\nOr further in the _third figure_, let AILD represent an including _solid_\r\nmedium of a cylindrical shape (as suppose a small _Glass Jar_) Let FGEMM\r\nrepresent a contain’d _fluid_, as water; this towards the bottom and sides,\r\nis figured according to the concavity of the _Glass_: But its upper\r\n_Surface_, (which by reason of its gravity, (not considering at all the Air\r\nabove it, and so neither the congruity or incongruity of either of them to\r\nthe Glass) should be terminated by part of a _Sphere_ whose diameter should\r\nbe the same with that of the earth, which to our sense would appear a\r\nstraight _Line_, as FGE, Or which by reason of its having a greater\r\ncongruity to Glass than Air has, (not considering its Gravity) would be\r\nthrust into a _concave Sphere_, as CHB, whose diameter would be the same\r\nwith that of the concavity of the Vessel:) Its upper Surface, I say, by\r\nreason of its having a greater gravity then the Air, and having likewise a\r\ngreater congruity to Glass then the Air has, is terminated, by a _concave\r\nElliptico-spherical Figure_, as CKB. For by its congruity it easily\r\nconforms it self, and adheres to the Glass, and constitutes as it were one\r\ncontaining body with it, and therefore should thrust the contained Air on\r\nthat side it touches it, into a _spherical_ Figure, as BHC, but the motion\r\nof Gravity depressing a little the Corners B and C, reduces it into the\r\naforesaid Figure CKB. Now that it is the greater congruity of one of the\r\ntwo _contiguous fluids_, then of the other, to the containing _solid_, that\r\ncauses the separating surfaces to be thus or thus figured: And that it is\r\nnot because this or that figurated surface is more proper, natural, or\r\npeculiar to one of these fluid bodies, then to the other, will appear from\r\nthis; that the same _fluids_ will by being put into differing _solids_,\r\nchange their _surfaces_. For the same water, which in a Glass or wooden\r\nVessel will have a concave surface upwards, and will rise higher in a\r\nsmaller then a greater Pipe, the same water, I say, in the same Pipes\r\ngreased over or oyled, will produce quite contrary effects; for it will\r\nhave a _protuberant_ and _convex_ surface upwards, and will not rise so\r\nhigh in small, as in bigger Pipes: Nay, in the very same solid Vessel, you\r\nmay make the very same two contiguous _Liquids_ to alter their Surfaces;\r\nfor taking a small Wine-glass, or such like Vessel, and pouring water\r\ngently into it, you shall perceive the _surface_ of the water all the way\r\n_concave_, till it rise even with the top, when you shall find it (if you\r\ngently and carefully pour in more) to grow very _protuberant_ and _convex_;\r\nthe reason of which is plain, for that the _solid_ sides of the containing\r\nbody are no longer extended, to which the water does more readily adhere\r\nthen the air; but it is henceforth to be included with air, which would\r\nreduce it into a _hemisphere_, but by reason of its _gravity_, it is\r\nflatted into an _Oval_. _Quicksilver_ also which to _Glass_ is more\r\nincongruous then _Air_ (and thereby being put into a _Glass-pipe_, will not\r\nadhere to it, but by the more _congruous air_ will be forced to have a very\r\n_protuberant_ surface, and to rise higher in a greater then a lesser Pipe)\r\nthis _Quicksilver_ to clean _Metal_, especially to _Gold_, _Silver_, _Tin_,\r\n_Lead_, &c. _Iron_ excepted, is more _congruous_ then _Air_, and will not\r\nonly stick to it, but have a _concave_ Surface like _water_, and rise\r\nhigher in a less, then in a greater Pipe.\r\n\r\nIn all these Examples it is evident, that there is an _extraordinary_ and\r\n_adventitious force_, by which the _globular_ Figure of the contained\r\n_heterogeneous_ fluid is altered; neither can it be imagined, how it should\r\notherwise be of any other Figure then _Globular_: For being by the\r\n_heterogeneous_ fluid equally _protruded_ every way, whatsoever part is\r\n_protuberant_, will be thereby _deprest_. From this cause it is, that in\r\nits effects it does very much resemble a _round Spring_ (such as a _Hoop_.)\r\nFor as in a _round Spring_ there is required an additional _pressure_\r\nagainst two opposite sides, to reduce it into an _Oval_ Form, or to force\r\nit in between the sides of a _Hole_, whose _Diameter_ is less then that of\r\nthe _Spring_, there must be a considerable force or _protrusion_ against\r\n_the concave_ or inner side of the _Spring_; So to alter this _spherical_\r\nconstitution of an included fluid body, there is required more pressure\r\nagainst opposite sides to reduce it into an _Oval_; and, to press it into\r\nan _Hole_ less in _Diameter_ then it self, it requires a greater\r\n_protrusion_ against all the other sides, What degrees of force are\r\nrequisite to reduce them into longer and longer _Ovals_, or to press them\r\ninto less and less _holes_, I have not yet experimentally calculated; but\r\nthus much by experiment I find in general, that there is alwayes required a\r\ngreater pressure to close them into longer _Ovals_, or protrude them into\r\nsmaller _holes_. The necessity and reason of this, were it requisite, I\r\ncould easily explain: but being not so necessary, and requiring more room\r\nand time then I have for it at present, I shall here omit it; and proceed\r\nto shew, that this may be presently found true, if Experiment be made with\r\na _round Spring_ (the way of making which trials is _obvious_ enough.) And\r\nwith the fluid bodies of _Mercury_, _Air_, _&c._ the way of trying which,\r\nwill be somewhat more difficult; and therefore I shall in brief describe\r\nit. He therefore that would try with _Air_, must first be provided of a\r\n_Glass-pipe_, made of the shape of that in the _fifth Figure_, whereof the\r\nside AB, represents a straight _Tube_ of about three foot long, C,\r\nrepresents another part of it, which consists of a _round Bubble_; so\r\nordered, that there is left a _passage_ or _hole_ at the top, into which\r\nmay be fastened with _cement_ several _small Pipes_ of determinate\r\n_cylindrical_ cavities: as let the _hollow_ of\r\n\r\n  F.       ¼\r\n  G.       ⅙\r\n  H.       ⅛\r\n  I.  be   ¹⁄₁₂   of an inch.\r\n  K.       ¹⁄₁₆\r\n  L.       ¹⁄₂₄\r\n  M.       ¹⁄₃₂\r\n  &c.——\r\nThere may be added as many more, as the Experimenter shall think fit, with\r\nholes continually decreasing by known quantities, so far as his senses are\r\nable to help him; I say, so far, because there may be made _Pipes_ so small\r\nthat it will be impossible to perceive the _perforation_ with ones naked\r\neye, though by the help of a _Microscope_, it may easily enough be\r\nperceived: Nay, I have made a _Pipe_ perforated from end to end, so small,\r\nthat with my naked eye I could very hardly see the body of it, insomuch\r\nthat I have been able to knit it up into a knot without breaking: And more\r\naccurately examining one with my _Microscope_, I found it not so big as a\r\nsixteenth part of one of the smaller hairs of my head which was of the\r\nsmaller and finer sort of hair, so that sixteen of these _Pipes_ bound\r\nfaggot-wise together, would but have equalized one single hair; how small\r\ntherefore must its _perforation_ be? It appearing to me through the\r\n_Microscope_ to be a proportionably _thick-sided Pipe_.\r\n\r\nTo proceed then, for the trial of the Experiment, the Experimenter must\r\nplace the _Tube_ AB, perpendicular, and fill the _Pipe_ F (cemented into\r\nthe hole E) with water, but leave the _bubble_ C full of _Air_, and then\r\ngently pouring in water into the Pipe AB, he must observe diligently how\r\nhigh the water will rise in it before it protrude the _bubble_ of Air C,\r\nthrough the narrow passage of F, and denote exactly the height of the\r\n_Cylinder_ of water, then cementing in a second Pipe as G, and filling it\r\nwith water; he may proceed as with the former, denoting likewise the height\r\nof the _Cylinder_ of water, able to protrude the _bubble_ C through the\r\npassage of G, the like may he do with the next _Pipe_, and the next, &c. as\r\nfar as he is able: then comparing the several heights of the _Cylinders_,\r\nwith the several _holes_ through which each _Cylinder_ did force the _air_\r\n(having due regard to the _Cylinders_ of water in the small _Tubes_) it\r\nwill be very easie to determine, what force is requisite to press the _Air_\r\ninto such and such _a hole_, or (to apply it to our present experiment) how\r\nmuch of the pressure of the _Air_ is taken off by its ingress into smaller\r\nand smaller _holes_. From the application of which to the entring of the\r\n_Air_ into the bigger _hole_ of the _Vessel_, and into the smaller _hole_\r\nof the _Pipe_, we shall clearly find, that there is a greater pressure of\r\nthe air upon the water in the _Vessel_ or greater _pipe_, then there is\r\nupon that in the lesser _pipe_: For since the pressure of the _air_ every\r\nway is found to be equal, that is, as much as is able to press up and\r\nsustain a _Cylinder_ of _Quicksilver_ of two foot and a half high, or\r\nthereabouts; And since of this pressure so many more degrees are required\r\nto force the _Air_ into a smaller then into a greater _hole_ that is full\r\nof a more congruous fluid. And lastly, since those degrees that are\r\nrequisite to press it in, are thereby taken off from the _Air_ within, and\r\nthe _Air_ within left with so many degrees of pressure less then the _Air_\r\nwithout; it will follow, that the _Air_ in the less _Tube_ or _pipe_, will\r\nhave less pressure against the superficies of the _water_ therein, then the\r\n_Air_ in the bigger: which was the minor Proposition to be proved.\r\n\r\nThe Conclusion therefore will necessarily follow, _viz._ That _this\r\nunequal pressure of the Air caused by its ingress into unequal holes,\r\nis a cause sufficient to produce this effect, without the help of any\r\nother concurrent_; and therefore is probably the principal (if not the\r\nonly) cause of these _Phænomena_.\r\n\r\nThis therefore being thus explained, there will be divers _Phænomena_\r\nexplicable thereby, as, the rising of _Liquors_ in a _Filtre_, the rising\r\nof _Spirit of Wine_, _Oyl_, _melted Tallow_, &c. in the _Week_ of a _Lamp_,\r\n(though made of small _Wire_, _Threeds_ of _Asbestus_, _Strings_ of\r\n_Glass_, or the like) the rising of _Liquors_ in a _Spunge_, piece of\r\n_Bread_, _Sand_, &c. perhaps also the ascending of the _Sap_ in _Trees_ and\r\n_Plants_, through their small, and some of them _imperceptible pores_, (of\r\nwhich I have said more, on another occasion) at least the passing of it out\r\nof the earth into their roots. And indeed upon the consideration of this\r\nPrinciple, multitudes of other uses of it occurr’d to me, which I have not\r\nyet so well examined and digested as to propound for _Axioms_, but only as\r\n_Queries_ and _Conjectures_ which may serve as _hints_ toward some further\r\n_discoveries_.\r\n\r\nAs first, Upon the consideration of the _congruity_ and _incongruity_ of\r\nBodies, as to _touch_, I found also the like _congruity_ and _incongruity_\r\n(if I may so speak) as to the _Transmitting_ of the _Rates_ of Light: For\r\nas in this regard, _water_ (not now to mention other Liquors) seems nearer\r\nof affinity to _Glass_ then _Air_, and _Air_ then _Quicksilver_: whence an\r\n_oblique Ray_ out of _Glass_, will pass into _water_ with very little\r\n_refraction_ from the _perpendicular_, but none out of _Glass_ into _Air_,\r\nexcepting a _direct_, will pass without a very great refraction from the\r\nperpendicular, nay any oblique Ray under thirty degrees, will not be\r\nadmitted into the Air at all. And _Quicksilver_ will neither admit oblique\r\nor direct, but reflects all; seeming, as to the transmitting of the Raies\r\nof Light, to be of a quite differing constitution, from that of _Air_,\r\n_Water_, _Glass_, &c. and to resemble most those opacous and strong\r\nreflecting bodies of Metals: So also as to the property of cohesion or\r\ncongruity, Water seems to keep the same order, being more congruous to\r\nGlass then Air, and Air then Quicksilver.\r\n\r\nA Second thing (which was hinted to me, by the consideration of the\r\nincluded fluids globular form, caused by the protrusion of the ambient\r\nheterogeneous fluid) was, whether the _Phænomena_ of gravity might not by\r\nthis means be explained, by supposing the _Globe_ of Earth, Water, and Air\r\nto be included with a _fluid_, heterogeneous to all and each of them, so\r\nsubtil, as not only to be every where _interspersed_ through the _Air_, (or\r\nrather the _air_ through it) but to _pervade_ the bodies of _Glass_, and\r\neven the _closest Metals_, by which means it may endeavour to _detrude_ all\r\nearthly bodies as far from it as it can; and partly thereby, and partly by\r\nother of its properties may move them towards the Center of the Earth. Now\r\nthat there is some such fluid, I could produce many Experiments and\r\nReasons, that do seem to prove it: But because it would ask some time and\r\nroom to set them down and explain them, and to consider and answer all the\r\nObjections (many whereof I foresee) that may be alledged against it; I\r\nshall at present proceed to other _Queries_, contenting my self to have\r\nhere only given a hint of what I may say more elswhere.\r\n\r\nA Third _Query_ then was, Whether the _heterogeneity_ of the _ambient\r\nfluid_ may not be accounted a _secondary cause_ of the _roundness_ or\r\n_globular form_ of the _greater bodies_ of the world, such as are those of\r\nthe _Sun_, _Stars_, and _Planets_, the _substance_ of each of which seems\r\naltogether _heterogeneous_ to the _circumambient fluid æther_? And of this\r\nI shall say more in the Observation of the Moon.\r\n\r\nA Fourth was, Whether the _globular form_ of the _smaller parcels_ of\r\nmatter here upon the _Earth_, as that of _Fruits_, _Pebbles_, or _Flints_,\r\n&c. (which seem to have been a _Liquor_ at first) may not be caused by the\r\n_heterogeneous ambient fluid_. For thus we see that melted _Glass_ will be\r\nnaturally formed into a _round Figure_; so likewise any small Parcel of any\r\n_fusible body_, if it be perfectly enclosed by the _Air_, will be driven\r\ninto a _globular_ Form; and, when cold, will be found a _solid Ball_. This\r\nis plainly enough manifested to us by their way of making _shot_ with the\r\n_drops of Lead_; which being a very pretty curiosity, and known but to a\r\nvery few, and having the liberty of publishing it granted me, by that\r\n_Eminent Virtuoso_ Sir _Robert Moray_, who brought in this Account of it to\r\nthe _Royal Society_, I have here transcribed and inserted.\r\n\r\nTo make small shot of different sizes; Communicated by his Highness _P.R._\r\n\r\n_Take Lead out of the Pig what quantity you please, melt it down, stir and\r\nclear it with an iron Ladle, gathering together the blackish parts that\r\nswim at top like scum, and when you see the colour of the clear Lead to be\r\ngreenish, but no sooner, strew upon it _Auripigmentum_ powdered according\r\nto the quantity of Lead, about as much as will lye upon a half Crown piece\r\nwill serve for eighteen or twenty pound weight of some sorts of Lead;\r\nothers will require more, or less. After the _Auripigmentum_ is put in,\r\nstir the Lead well, and the _Auripigmentum_ will flame: when the flame is\r\nover, take out some of the Lead in a Ladle having a lip or notch in the\r\nbrim for convenient pouring out of the Lead, and being well warmed amongst\r\nthe melted Lead, and with a stick make some single drops of Lead trickle\r\nout of the Ladle into water in a Glass, which if they fall to be round and\r\nwithout tails, there is _Auripigmentum_ enough put in, and the temper of\r\nthe heat is right, otherwise put in more. Then lay two bars of Iron (or\r\nsome more proper Iron-tool made on purpose) upon a Pail of water, and place\r\nupon them a round Plate of Copper, of the size and figure of an ordinary\r\nlarge Pewter or Silver Trencher, the hollow whereof is to be about three\r\ninches over, the bottom lower then the brims about half an inch, pierced\r\nwith thirty, forty, or more small holes; the smaller the holes are, the\r\nsmaller the shot will be; and the brim is to be thicker then the bottom, to\r\nconserve the heat the better._\r\n\r\n_The bottom of the Trencher being some four inches distant from the water\r\nin the Pail, lay upon it some burning Coles, to keep the Lead melted upon\r\nit. Then with the hot Ladle take Lead off the Pot where it stands melted,\r\nand pour it softly upon the burning Coles over the bottom of the Trencher,\r\nand it will immediately run through the holes into the water in small round\r\ndrops. Thus pour on new Lead still as fast as it runs through the Trencher\r\ntill all be done; blowing now and then the Coles with hand-Bellows, when\r\nthe Lead in the Trencher cools so as to stop from running._\r\n\r\n_Whilst one pours on the Lead, another must, with another Ladle, thrusted\r\nfour or five inches under water in the Pail, catch from time to time some\r\nof the shot, as it drops down, to see the size of it, and whether there be\r\nany faults in it. The greatest care is to keep the Lead upon the Trencher\r\nin the right degree of heat; if it be too cool, it will not run through the\r\nTrencher, though it stand melted upon it; and this is to be helped by\r\nblowing the Coals a little, or pouring on new Lead that is hotter: but the\r\ncooler the Lead, the larger the Shot; and the hotter, the smaller; when it\r\nis too hot, the drops will crack and fly; then you must stop pouring on new\r\nLead, and let it cool; and so long as you observe the right temper of the\r\nheat, the Lead will constantly drop into very round Shot, without so much\r\nas one with a tail in many pounds._\r\n\r\n_When all is done, take your Shot out of the Pail of water, and put it in a\r\nFrying-pan over the fire to dry them, which must be done warily, still\r\nshaking them that they melt not; and when they are dry you may separate the\r\nsmall from the great, in Pearl Sives made of Copper or Lattin let into one\r\nanother, into as many sizes at you please. But if you would have your Shot\r\nlarger then the Trencher makes them, you may do it with a Stick, making\r\nthem trickle out of the Ladle, as hath been said._\r\n\r\n_If the Trencher be but toucht a very little when the Lead stops from going\r\nthrough it, and be not too cool, it will drop again, but it is better not\r\nto touch it at all. At the melting of the Lead take care that there be no\r\nkind of Oyl, Grease, or the like, upon the Pots, or Ladles, or Trencher._\r\n\r\n_The Chief cause of this Globular Figure of the Shot, seems to be the\r\n_Auripigmentum_; for, as soon as it is put in among the melted Lead, it\r\nloses its shining brightness, contracting instantly a grayish film or skin\r\nupon it, when you scum it to make it clean with the Ladle. So that when the\r\nAir comes at the falling drop of the melted Lead, that skin constricts them\r\nevery where equally: but upon what account, and whether this be the true\r\ncause, is left to further disquisition._\r\n\r\nMuch after this same manner, when the Air is exceeding cold through which\r\nit passes; do we find the drops of Rain, falling from the Clouds, congealed\r\ninto round Hail-stones by the freezing Ambient.\r\n\r\nTo which may be added this other known Experiment, That if you gently let\r\nfall a drop of _water_ upon small _sand_ or _dust_, you shall find, as it\r\nwere, an artificial _round stone_ quickly generated. I cannot upon this\r\noccasion omit the mentioning of the strange kind of _Grain_, which I have\r\nobserved in a _stone_ brought from _Kettering_ in _Northamptonshire_, and\r\ntherefore called by Masons _Kettering-Stone_, of which see the Description.\r\nWhich brings into my mind what I long since observed in the fiery Sparks\r\nthat are struck out of a Steel. For having a great desire to see what was\r\nleft behind, after the Spark was gone out, I purposely struck fire over a\r\nvery white piece of Paper, and observing diligently where some conspicuous\r\nsparks went out, I found a very little black spot no bigger then the point\r\nof a Pin, which through a _Microscope_ appeared to be a perfectly round\r\nBall, looking much like a polisht ball of Steel, insomuch that I was able\r\nto see the Image of the window reflected from it. I cannot here stay\r\n(having done it more fully in another place) to examine the particular\r\nReasons of it, but shall only hint, that I imagine it to be some small\r\nparcel of the Steel, which by the violence of the motion of the stroke\r\n(most of which seems to be imprest upon those small parcels) is made so\r\nglowing hot, that it is melted into a _Vitrum_, which by the ambient Air is\r\nthrust into the form of a Ball.\r\n\r\nA Fifth thing which I thought worth Examination was, Whether the motion of\r\nall kind of Springs, might not be reduced to the Principle whereby the\r\nincluded _heterogeneous fluid_ seems to be moved; or to that whereby two\r\nSolids, as Marbles, or the like, are thrust and kept together by the\r\n_ambient fluid_.\r\n\r\nA Sixth thing was, Whether the Rising and Ebullition of the Water out of\r\nSprings and Fountains (which lie much higher from the Center of the Earth\r\nthen the Superficies of the Sea, from whence it seems to be derived) may\r\nnot be explicated by the rising of Water in a smaller Pipe: For the\r\nSea-water being strained through the Pores or Crannies of the Earth, is, as\r\nit were, included in little Pipes, where the pressure of the Air has not so\r\ngreat a power to resist its rising: But examining this way, and finding in\r\nit several difficulties almost irremovable, I thought upon a way that would\r\nmuch more naturally and conceivably explain it, which was by this following\r\nExperiment: I took a Glass-Tube, of the form of that described in the sixth\r\nFigure, and chusing two _heterogeneous fluids_, such as Water and Oyl, I\r\npoured in as much Water as filled up the Pipes as high as AB, then putting\r\nin some Oyl into the Tube AC, I deprest the superficies A of the Water to\r\nF, and B I raised to G, which was not so high perpendicularly as the\r\nsuperficies of the Oyl F, by the space FI, wherefore the proportion of the\r\ngravity of these two Liquors was as GH to FE.\r\n\r\nThis Experiment I tried with several other Liquors, and particularly with\r\nfresh Water and Salt (which I made by dissolving Salt in warm Water) which\r\ntwo though they are nothing heterogeneous, yet before they would perfectly\r\nmix one with another, I made trial of the Experiment: Nay, letting the Tube\r\nwherein I tried the Experiment remain for many dayes, I observed them not\r\nto mix; but the superficies of the fresh was rather more then less elevated\r\nabove that of the Salt. Now the proportion of the gravity of Sea-water, to\r\nthat of River-water, according to _Stevinus_ and _Varenius_, and as I have\r\nsince found pretty true by making trial my self, is as 46. to 45. that is,\r\n46. Ounces of the salt Water will take up no more room then 45. of the\r\nfresh. Or reciprocally 45 pints of salt-water weigh as much as 46 of fresh.\r\n\r\nBut I found the proportion of Brine to fresh Water to be near 13 to 12:\r\nSupposing therefore GHM to represent the Sea, and FI the height of the\r\nMountain above the Superficies of the Sea, FM a Cavern in the Earth,\r\nbeginning at the bottom of the Sea, and terminated at the top of the\r\nMountain, LM the Sand at the bottom, through which the Water is as it were\r\nstrained, so as that the fresher parts are only permitted to transude, and\r\nthe saline kept back; if therefore the proportion of G M to FM be as 45 to\r\n46, then may the Cylinder of Salt-water GM make the Cylinder of Fresh-water\r\nto rise as high as E, and to run over at N. I cannot here stand to examine\r\nor confute their Opinion, who make the depth of the Sea, below its\r\nSuperficies, to be no more perpendicularly measured then the height of the\r\nMountains above it: ’Tis enough for me to say, there is no one of those\r\nthat have asserted it, have experimentally known the perpendicular of\r\neither; nor shall I here determine, whether there may not be many other\r\ncauses of the separation of the fresh water from the salt, as perhaps some\r\nparts of the Earth through which it is to pass, may contain a Salt, that\r\nmixing and uniting with the Sea-salt, may precipitate it; much after the\r\nsame manner as the _Alcalizate_ and _Acid Salts_ mix and precipitate each\r\nother in the preparation of _Tartarum Vitriolatum._ I know not also whether\r\nthe exceeding cold (that must necessarily be) at the bottom of the Water,\r\nmay not help towards this separation, for we find, that warm Water is able\r\nto dissolve and contain more Salt, then the same cold; insomuch that Brines\r\nstrongly impregnated by heat, if let cool, do suffer much of their Salt to\r\nsubside and crystallize about the bottom and sides. I know not also whether\r\nthe exceeding pressure of the parts of the Water one against another, may\r\nnot keep the Salt from descending to the very bottom, as finding little or\r\nno room to insert it self between those parts, protruded so violently\r\ntogether, or else squeeze it upwards into the superiour parts of the Sea,\r\nwhere it may more easily obtain room for it self, amongst the parts of the\r\nWater, by reason that there is more heat and less pressure. To this Opinion\r\nI was somewhat the more induced by the relations I have met with in\r\n_Geographical Writers_, of drawing fresh Water from the bottom of the Sea,\r\nwhich is salt above. I cannot now stand to examine, whether this natural\r\nperpetual motion may not artificially be imitated: Nor can I stand to\r\nanswer the Objections which may be made against this my Supposition: As,\r\nFirst, How it comes to pass, that there are sometimes salt Springs much\r\nhigher then the Superficies of the Water? And, Secondly, Why Springs do not\r\nrun faster and slower, according to the varying height made of the Cylinder\r\nof Sea-water, by the ebbing and flowing of the Sea?\r\n\r\nAs to the First, In short, I say, the fresh Water may receive again a\r\nsaline Tincture near the Superficies of the Earth, by passing through some\r\nsalt _Mines_, or else many of the saline parts of the Sea may be kept back,\r\nthough not all.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the Second, The same _Spring_ may be fed and supplyed by divers\r\n_Caverns_, coming from very far distant parts of the _Sea_, so as that it\r\nmay in one place be _high_, in another _low water_; and so by that means\r\nthe _Spring_ may be equally supply’d at all times. Or else the _Cavern_ may\r\nbe so straight and narrow, that the water not having so ready and free\r\npassage through it, cannot upon so short and quick mutations of pressure,\r\nbe able to produce any sensible effect at such a distance. Besides that, to\r\nconfirm this _hypothesis_, there are many _Examples_ found in _Natural\r\nHistorians_, of _Springs_ that do ebb and flow like the Sea: As\r\nparticularly, those recorded by the Learned _Camden_, and after him by\r\n_Speed_, to be found in this _Island_: One of which, they relate to be on\r\nthe Top of a Mountain, by the small Village _Kilken_ in _Flintshire_,\r\n_Maris æmulus qui statis temporibus suas evomit & resorbet Aquas_; Which at\r\ncertain times riseth and falleth after the manner of the Sea. A Second in\r\n_Caermardenshire_, near _Caermarden_, at a place called _Cantred Bichan_;\r\n_Qui (ut scribit Giraldus) naturali die bis undis deficiens, & toties\r\nexuberans, marinas imitatur instabilitates_; That twice in four and twenty\r\nhours ebbing and flowing; resembleth the unstable motions of the Sea. The\r\n_Phænomena_ of which two may be easily made out, by supposing the _Cavern_,\r\nby which they are fed, to arise from the bottom of the next Sea. A Third,\r\nis a Well upon the River _Ogmore_ in _Glamorganshire_, and near unto\r\n_Newton_, of which _Camden_ relates himself to be certified, by a Letter\r\nfrom a Learned Friend of his that observed it, _Fons abest hinc, &c._ The\r\nLetter is a little too long to be inserted, but the substance is this; That\r\nthis Well ebbs and flows quite contrary to the flowing and ebbing of the\r\nSea in those parts: for ’tis almost empty at Full Sea, but full at Low\r\nwater. This may happen from the Channel by which it is supplied, which may\r\ncome from the bottom of a Sea very remote from those parts, and where the\r\nTides are much differing from those of the approximate shores. A Fourth,\r\nlies in _Westmorland_, near the River _Leder_; _Qui instar Euripi sæpius in\r\ndie reciprocantibus undis fluit & refluit_, which ebbs and flows many times\r\na day. This may proceed from its being supplyed from many Channels, coming\r\nfrom several parts of the Sea, lying sufficiently distant asunder to have\r\nthe times of High water differing enough one from the other; so as that\r\nwhensoever it shall be High water over any of those places, where these\r\nChannels begin, it shall likewise be so in the Well; but this is but a\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nA Seventh _Query_ was, Whether the _dissolution_ or mixing of several\r\nbodies, whether fluid or solid, with saline or other Liquors, might not\r\npartly be attributed to this Principle of the congruity of those bodies and\r\ntheir dissolvents? As of Salt in Water, Metals in several _Menstruums_,\r\nUnctuous Gums in Oyls, the mixing of Wine and Water, &c. And whether\r\n_precipitation_ be not partly made from the same Principle of Incongruity?\r\nI say _partly_, because there are in some Dissolutions, some other Causes\r\nconcurrent.\r\n\r\nI shall lastly make a much more seemingly strange and unlikely _Query_; and\r\nthat is, Whether this Principle, well examined and explained, may not be\r\nfound a _coefficient_ in the most considerable Operations of Nature? As in\r\nthose of _Heat_, and _Light_, and consequently of _Rarefaction_ and\r\n_Condensation_, _Hardness_, and _Fluidness_, _Perspicuity_ and\r\n_Opacousness_, _Refractions_ and _Colours. &c._ Nay, I know not whether\r\nthere may be many things done in Nature, in which this may not (be said to)\r\nhave a Finger? This I have in some other passages of this Treatise further\r\nenquired into and shewn, that as well _Light_ as _Heat_ may be caused by\r\n_corrosion_, which is applicable to _congruity_, and consequently all the\r\nrest will be but _subsequents_: In the mean time I would not willingly be\r\nguilty of that _Error_, which the thrice Noble and Learned _Verulam_ justly\r\ntakes notice of, as such, and calls _Philosophiæ Genus Empiricum, quod in\r\npaucorum Experimentorum Angustiis & Obscuritate fundatum est_. For I\r\nneither conclude from one single Experiment, nor are the Experiments I make\r\nuse of all made upon one Subject: Nor wrest I any Experiment to make it\r\n_quadrare_ with any preconceiv’d Notion. But on the contrary, I endeavour\r\nto be conversant in divers kinds of Experiments, and all and every one of\r\nthose Trials, I make the Standards or Touchstones, by which I try all my\r\nformer Notions, whether they hold out in weight, and measure, and touch,\r\n&c. For as that Body is no other then a Counterfeit Gold, which wants any\r\none of the Proprieties of Gold, (such as are the Malleableness, Weight,\r\nColour, Fixtness in the Fire, Indissolubleness in _Aqua fortis_, and the\r\nlike) though it has all the other; so will all those Notions be found to be\r\nfalse and deceitful, that will not undergo all the Trials and Tests made of\r\nthem by Experiments. And therefore such as will not come up to the desired\r\n_Apex_ of Perfection, I rather wholly reject and take new, then by piecing\r\nand patching, endeavour to retain the old, as knowing such things at best\r\nto be but lame and imperfect. And this course I learned from Nature; whom\r\nwe find neglectful of the old Body, and suffering its Decaies and\r\nInfirmities to remain without repair, and altogether sollicitous and\r\ncareful of perpetuating the _Species_ by new _Individuals_. And it is\r\ncertainly the most likely way to erect a glorious Structure and Temple to\r\n_Nature_, such as she will be found (by any _zealous Votary_) to reside in;\r\nto begin to build a new upon a sure Foundation of Experiments.\r\n\r\nBut to digress no further from the consideration of the _Phænomena_, more\r\nimmediately explicable by this Experiment, we shall proceed to shew, That,\r\nas to the rising of Water in a _Filtre_, the reason of it will be manifest\r\nto him, that does take notice, that a _Filtre_ is constituted of a great\r\nnumber of small long solid bodies, which lie so close together, that the\r\nAir in its getting in between them, doth lose of its pressure that it has\r\nagainst the _Fluid_ without them, by which means the Water or Liquor not\r\nfinding so strong a resistance between them as is able to counter-ballance\r\nthe pressure on its superficies without, is raised upward, till it meet\r\nwith a pressure of the Air which is able to hinder it. And as to the Rising\r\nof Oyl, melted Tallow, Spirit of Wine, &c. in the Week of a Candle or Lamp,\r\nit is evident, that it differs in nothing from the former, save only in\r\nthis, that in a _Filtre_ the Liquor descends and runs away by another part;\r\nand in the Week the Liquor is dispersed and carried away by the Flame;\r\nsomething there is ascribable to the Heat, for that it may rarifie the more\r\nvolatil and spirituous parts of those combustible Liquors, and so being\r\nmade lighter then the Air, it may be protruded upwards by that more\r\nponderous fluid body in the Form of Vapours; but this can be ascribed to\r\nthe ascension of but a very little, and most likely of that only which\r\nascends without the Week. As for the Rising of it in a Spunge, Bread,\r\nCotton, &c. above the superficies of the subjacent Liquor, what has been\r\nsaid about the _Filtre_ (if considered) will easily suggest a reason,\r\nconsidering that all these bodies abound with small holes or pores.\r\n\r\nFrom this same Principle also (_viz. the unequal pressure of the Air\r\nagainst the unequal superficies of the water_) proceeds the cause of the\r\naccession or incursion of any floating body against the sides of the\r\ncontaining Vessel; or the _appropinquation_ of two floating bodies, as\r\n_Bubbles_, _Corks_, _Sticks_, _Straws_, &c. one towards another. As for\r\ninstance, Take a Glass jar, such as AB in the seventh _Figure_, and filling\r\nit pretty near the top with water, throw into it a small round piece of\r\nCork, as C, and plunge it all over in water, that it be wet, so as that the\r\nwater may rise up by the sides of it, then placing it any where upon the\r\nsuperficies, about an inch, or one inch and a quarter from any side, and\r\nyou shall perceive it by degrees to make _perpendicularly_ toward the\r\nnearest part of the side, and the nearer it approaches, the faster to be\r\nmoved, the reason of which _Phænomenon_ will be found no other then this,\r\nthat the Air has a greater pressure against the middle of the\r\n_superficies_, then it has against those parts that approach nearer, and\r\nare _contiguous_ to the sides. Now that the pressure is greater, may (as I\r\nshewed before in the explication of the third _Figure_) be evinced from the\r\nflatting of the water in the middle, which arises from the gravity of the\r\nunder _fluid_: for since, as I shewed before, if there were no gravity in\r\nthe under _fluid_, or that it were equal to that of the upper, the\r\nterminating Surface would be _Spherical_, and since it is the additional\r\npressure of the gravity of water that makes it so flat, it follows, that\r\nthe pressure upon the middle must be greater then towards the sides. Hence\r\nthe Ball having a stronger pressure against that side of it which respects\r\nthe middle of the _superficies_, then against that which respects the\r\n_approximate_ side, must necessarily move towards that part, from whence it\r\nfinds least resistance, and so be _accelerated_, as the resistance\r\ndecrease. Hence the more the water is raised under that part of its way it\r\nis passing above the middle, the faster it is moved: And therefore you will\r\nfind it to move faster in E then in D, and in D then in C. Neither could I\r\nfind the floating substance to be moved at all, until it were placed upon\r\nsome part of the _Superficies_ that was sensibly elevated above the height\r\nof the middle part. Now that this may be the true cause, you may try with a\r\nblown Bladder, and an exactly round Ball upon a very smooth side of some\r\npliable body, as _Horn_ or _Quicksilver._ For if the Ball be placed under a\r\npart of the Bladder which is upon one side of the middle of its pressure,\r\nand you press strongly against the Bladder, you shall find the Ball moved\r\nfrom the middle towards the sides.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore shewn the reason of the motion of any float towards the\r\nsides, the reason of the incursion of any two floating bodies will easily\r\nappear: For the rising of the water against the sides of either of them, is\r\nan Argument sufficient, to shew the pressure of the Air to be there less,\r\nthen it is further from it, where it is not so much elevated; and therefore\r\nthe reason of the motion of the other toward it, will be the same as\r\ntowards the side of the Glass, only here from the same reason, they are\r\nmutually moved toward each other, whereas the side of the Glass in the\r\nformer remains fixt. If also you gently fill the Jar so full with water,\r\nthat the water is _protuberant_ above the sides, the same piece of Cork\r\nthat before did hasten towards the sides, does now fly from it as fast\r\ntowards the middle of the Superficies; the reason of which will be found no\r\nother then this, that the pressure of the Air is stronger against the sides\r\nof the Superficies G and H, then against the middle I; for since, as I\r\nshewed before, the Principle of congruity would make the terminating\r\nSurface Spherical, and that the flatting of the Surface in the middle is\r\nfrom the abatement of the waters pressure outwards, by the contrary\r\nindeavour of its gravity; it follows that the pressure in the middle must\r\nbe less then on the sides; and therefore the consecution will be the same\r\nas in the former. It is very odd to one that considers not the reason of\r\nit, to see two floating bodies of wood to approach each other, as though\r\nthey were indued with some magnetical vigour; which brings into my mind\r\nwhat I formerly tried with a piece of Cork or such like body, which I so\r\nordered, that by putting a little stick into the same water, one part of\r\nthe said Cork would approach and make toward the stick, whereas another\r\nwould discede and fly away, nay it would have a kind of verticity, so as\r\nthat if the _Æquator_ (as I may so speak) of the Cork were placed towards\r\nthe stick, if let alone, it would instantly turn its appropriate Pole\r\ntoward it, and then run a-tilt at it: and this was done only by taking a\r\ndry Cork, and wetting one side of it with one small stroak; for by this\r\nmeans gently putting it upon the water, it would depress the superficies on\r\nevery side of it that was dry, and therefore the greatest pressure of the\r\nAir, being near those sides, caused it either to chase away, or else to fly\r\noff from any other floating body, whereas that side only, against which the\r\nwater ascended, was thereby able to attract.\r\n\r\nIt remains only, that I should determine how high the Water or other Liquor\r\nmay by this means be raised in a smaller Pipe above the Superficies of that\r\nwithout it, and at what height it may be sustained: But to determine this,\r\nwill be exceeding difficult, unless I could certainly know how much of the\r\nAirs pressure is taken off by the smalness of such and such a Pipe, and\r\nwhether it may be wholly taken off, that is, whether there can be a hole or\r\npore so small, into which Air could not at all enter, though water might\r\nwith its whole force, for were there such, ’tis manifest, that the water\r\nmight rise in it to some five or six and thirty English Foot high. I know\r\nnot whether the capillary Pipes in the bodies of small Trees, which we call\r\ntheir _Microscopical pores_, may not be such; and whether the congruity of\r\nthe sides of the Pore may not yet draw the juyce even higher then the Air\r\nwas able by its bare pressure to raise it: For, Congruity is a principle\r\nthat not only unites and holds a body joyned to it, but, which is more,\r\nattracts and draws a body that is very near it, and holds it above its\r\nusual height.\r\n\r\nAnd this is obvious even in a drop of water suspended under any Similar or\r\nCongruous body: For, besides the ambient pressure that helps to keep it\r\nsustein’d, there is the Congruity of the bodies that are contiguous. This\r\nis yet more evident in Tenacious and Glutinous bodies; such as Gummous\r\nLiquors, Syrups, Pitch, and Rosin melted, &c. Tar, Turpentine, Balsom,\r\nBirdlime, &c. for there it is evident, that the Parts of the tenacious\r\nbody, as I may so call it, do stick and adhere so closely together, that\r\nthough drawn out into long and very slender Cylinders, yet they will not\r\neasily relinquish one another; and this, though the bodies be _aliquatenus_\r\nfluid, and in motion by one another, which, to such as consider a fluid\r\nbody only as its parts are in a confused irregular motion, without taking\r\nin also the congruity of the parts one among another, and incongruity to\r\nsome other bodies, does appear not a little strange. So that besides the\r\nincongruity of the ambient fluid to it, we are to consider also the\r\ncongruity of the parts of the contein’d fluid one with another.\r\n\r\nAnd this Congruity (that I may here a little further explain it) is both a\r\nTenacious and an Attractive power; for the Congruity, in the Vibrative\r\nmotions, may be the cause of all kind of attraction, not only Electrical,\r\nbut Magnetical also, and therefore it may be also of Tenacity and\r\nGlutinousness. For, from a perfect congruity of the motions of two distant\r\nbodies, the intermediate fluid particles are separated and droven away from\r\nbetween them, and thereby those congruous bodies are, by the incompassing\r\nmediums, compell’d and forced neerer together; wherefore that\r\nattractiveness must needs be stronger, when, by an immediate contact, they\r\nare forc’d to be exactly the same: As I shew more at large in my _Theory_\r\nof the _Magnet_. And this hints to me the reason of the suspension of the\r\n_Mercury_ many inches, nay many feet, above the usual station of 30 inches.\r\nFor the parts of _Quick-Silver_, being so very similar and congruous to\r\neach other, if once united, will not easily suffer a divulsion: And the\r\nparts of water, that were any wayes _heterogeneous_, being by _exantlation_\r\nor rarefaction exhausted, the remaining parts being also very similar, will\r\nnot easily part neither. And the parts of the Glass being solid, are more\r\ndifficultly disjoyn’d; and the water, being somewhat similar to both, is,\r\nas it were, a medium to unite both the _Glass_ and the _Mercury_ together.\r\nSo that all three being united, and not very dissimilar, by means of this\r\ncontact, if care be taken that the Tube in erecting be not shogged, the\r\n_Quicksilver_ will remain suspended, notwithstanding its contrary indeavour\r\nof Gravity, a great height above its ordinary Station; but if this\r\nimmediate Contact be removed, either by a meer separation of them one from\r\nanother by the force of a shog, whereby the other becomes imbodied between\r\nthem, and licks up from the surface some agil parts, and so hurling them\r\nmakes them air, or else by some small heterogeneous agil part of the Water,\r\nor Air, or Quicksilver, which appears like a bubble, and by its jumbling to\r\nand fro there is made way for the _heterogeneous Æther_ to obtrude it self\r\nbetween the Glass and either of the other Fluids, the Gravity of _Mercury\r\nprecipitates_ it downward with very great violence; and if the Vessel that\r\nholds the restagnating _Mercury_ be convenient, the _Mercury_ will for a\r\ntime _vibrate_ to and fro with very large _reciprocations_, and at last\r\nwill remain kept up by the pressure of the external Air at the height of\r\nneer thirty inches. And whereas it may be objected, that it cannot be, that\r\nthe meer imbodying of the _Æther_ between these bodies can be the cause,\r\nsince the _Æther_ having a free passage alwayes, both through the Pores of\r\nthe Glass, and through those of the Fluids, there is no reason why it\r\nshould not make a separation at all times whilst it remains suspended, as\r\nwhen it is violently disjoyned by a shog. To this I answer, That though\r\nthe _Æther_ passes between the Particles, that is, through the Pores of\r\nbodies, so as that any chasm or separation being made, it has infinite\r\npassages to admit its entry into it, yet such is the tenacity or attractive\r\nvirtue of Congruity, that till it be overcome by the meer strength of\r\nGravity, or by a shog assisting that Conatus of Gravity, or by an agil\r\nParticle, that is like a leaver agitated by the _Æther_; and thereby the\r\nparts of the congruous substances are separated so far asunder, that the\r\nstrength of congruity is so far weakened, as not to be able to reunite\r\nthem, the parts to be taken hold of being removed out of the attractive\r\nSphere, as I may so speak, of the congruity; such, I say, is the tenacity\r\nof congruity, that it retains and holds the almost contiguous Particles of\r\nthe Fluid, and suffers them not to be separated, till by meer force that\r\nattractive or retentive faculty be overcome: But the separation being once\r\nmade beyond the Sphere of the attractive activity of congruity, that virtue\r\nbecomes of no effect at all, but the _Mercury_ freely falls downwards till\r\nit meet with a resistance from the pressure of the _ambient_ Air, able to\r\nresist its gravity, and keep it forced up in the Pipe to the height of\r\nabout thirty inches.\r\n\r\nThus have I gently raised a Steel _pendulum_ by a Loadstone to a great\r\nAngle, till by the shaking of my hand I have chanced to make a separation\r\nbetween them, which is no sooner made, but as if the Loadstone had retained\r\nno attractive virtue, the _Pendulum_ moves freely from it towards the other\r\nside. So vast a difference is there between the attractive virtue of the\r\n_Magnet_ when it acts upon a contiguous and upon a disjoyned body: and much\r\nmore must there be between the attractive virtues of congruity upon a\r\ncontiguous and disjoyned body; and in truth the attractive virtue is so\r\nlittle upon a body disjoyned, that though I have with a _Microscope_\r\nobserved very diligently, whether there were any extraordinary\r\n_protuberance_ on the side of a drop of water that was exceeding neer to\r\nthe end of a green stick, but did not touch it, I could not perceive the\r\nleast; though I found, that as soon as ever it toucht it the whole drop\r\nwould presently unite it self with it; so that it seems an absolute contact\r\nis requisite to the exercising of the tenacious faculty of congruity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. VII. _Of some _Phænomena_ of Glass drops._\r\n\r\nThese _Glass Drops_ are small parcels of coarse green Glass taken out of\r\nthe Pots that contain the _Metal_ (as they call it) in fusion, upon the end\r\nof an Iron Pipe; and being exceeding hot, and thereby of a kind of sluggish\r\nfluid Consistence, are suffered to drop from thence into a Bucket of cold\r\nWater, and in it to lye till they be grown sensibly cold.\r\n\r\nSome of these I broke in the open air, by snapping off a little of the\r\nsmall stem with my fingers, others by crushing it with a small pair of\r\nPlyers; which I had no sooner done, then the whole bulk of the drop flew\r\nviolently, with a very brisk noise, into multitudes of small pieces, some\r\nof which were as small as dust, though in some there were remaining pieces\r\npretty large, without any flaw at all, and others very much flaw’d, which\r\nby rubbing between ones fingers was easily reduced to dust; these dispersed\r\nevery way so violently, that some of them pierced my skin. I could not find,\r\neither with my naked Eye, or a _Microscope_, that any of the broken pieces\r\nwere of a regular figure, nor any one like another, but for the most part\r\nthose that flaw’d off in large pieces were prettily branched.\r\n\r\nThe ends of others of these drops I nipt off whilst all the bodies and ends\r\nof them lay buried under the water, which, like the former, flew all to\r\npieces with as brisk a noise, and as strong a motion.\r\n\r\nOthers of these I tried to break, by grinding away the blunt end, and\r\nthough I took a seemingly good one, and had ground away neer two thirds of\r\nthe Ball, yet would it not fly to pieces, but now and then some small rings\r\nof it would snap and fly off, not without a brisk noise and quick motion,\r\nleaving the Surface of the drop whence it flew very prettily branched or\r\ncreased, which was easily discoverable by the _Microscope_. This drop,\r\nafter I had thus ground it, without at all impairing the remnant that was\r\nnot ground away, I caused to fly immediately all into sand upon the nipping\r\noff the very tip of its slender end.\r\n\r\nAnother of these drops I began to grind away at the smaller end, but had\r\nnot worn away on the stone above a quarter of an inch before the whole drop\r\nflew with a brisk crack into sand or small dust; nor would it have held so\r\nlong, had there not been a little flaw in the piece that I ground away, as\r\nI afterwards found.\r\n\r\nSeveral others of these drops I covered over with a thin but very tuff skin\r\nof _Icthyocolla_, which being very tough and very transparent, was the most\r\nconvenient substance for these tryals that I could imagine, having dipt, I\r\nsay, several of these drops in this transparent Glue whilst hot, and\r\nsuffering them to hang by a string tied about the end of them till they\r\nwere cold, and the skin pretty tough; then wrapping all the body of the\r\ndrop (leaving out only the very tip) in fine supple Kids-leather very\r\nclosely, I nipped off the small top, and found, as I expected, that\r\nnotwithstanding this skin of Glue, and the close wrapping up in Leather,\r\nupon the breaking of the top, the drop gave a crack like the rest, and gave\r\nmy hand a pretty brisk impulse: but yet the skin and leather was so strong\r\nas to keep the parts from flying out of their former posture; and, the skin\r\nbeing transparent, I found that the drop retained exactly its former figure\r\nand polish, but was grown perfectly opacous and all over flaw’d, all those\r\nflaws lying in the manner of rings, from the bottom or blunt end, to the\r\nvery top or small point. And by several examinations with a _Microscope_,\r\nof several thus broken, I found the flaws, both within the body of the\r\ndrop, and on the outward surface, to lye much in this order.\r\n\r\nLet AB in the Figure X of the fourth Scheme represent the drop cased over\r\nwith _Icthyocolla_ or _Isinglass_, (by being ordered as is before\r\nprescribed) crazed or flawed into pieces, but by the skin or case kept in\r\nits former figure, and each of its flawed parts preserved exactly in its\r\ndue posture; the outward appearance of it somewhat plainly to the naked\r\neye, but much more conspicuous if viewed with a small lens appeared much\r\nafter this shape. That is, the blunt end B for a pretty breadth, namely, as\r\nfar as the Ring CCC seemed irregularly flawed with divers clefts, which all\r\nseemed to tend towards the Center of it, being, as I afterwards found, and\r\nshall anon shew in the description of the figure Y, the Basis, as it were,\r\nof a Cone, which was terminated a little above the middle of the drop, all\r\nthe rest of the Surface from CCC to A was flawed with an infinite number of\r\nsmall and parallel Rings, which as they were for the most part very round,\r\nso were they very thick and close together, but were not so exactly flaw’d\r\nas to make a perfect Ring, but each circular part was by irregular cracks\r\nflawed likewise into multitudes of irregular flakes or tiles; and this\r\norder was observed likewise the whole length of the neck.\r\n\r\nNow though I could not so exactly cut this _conical Body_ through the\r\n_Axis_, as is represented by the figure Y; yet by _anatomizing_, as it\r\nwere, of several, and taking notice of divers particular circumstances, I\r\nwas informed, that could I have artificially divided a flaw’d drop through\r\nthe _Axis_ or _Center_, I should with a _Microscope_ have found it to\r\nappear much of this form, where A signifies the _Apex_, and B the blunt\r\nend, CC the Cone of the Basis, which is terminated at T the top or end of\r\nit, which seems to be the very middle of the blunt end in which, not only\r\nthe conical body of the Basis CC is terminated, but as many of the parts of\r\nthe drop as reach as high as DD.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to be the head or beginning of a Pith, as it were, or a part\r\nof the body which seemed more spungy then the rest, and much more\r\nirregularly flawed, which from T ascended by EE, though less visible, into\r\nthe small neck towards A. The Grain, as it were, of all the flaws, that\r\nproceeds from all the outward Surface ADCCDA, was much the same, as is\r\nrepresented by the black strokes that meet in the middle DT, DT, DE, DE,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nNor is this kind of Grain, as I may call it, peculiar to Glass drops thus\r\nquenched; for (not to mention _Coperas-stones_, and divers other\r\n_Marchasites_ and _Minerals_, which I have often taken notice of to be in\r\nthe very same manner flaked or grained, with a kind of Pith in the middle)\r\nI have observed the same in all manner of cast Iron, especially the coarser\r\nsort, such as Stoves, and Furnaces, and Backs, and Pots are made of: For\r\nupon the breaking of any of those Substances it is obvious to observe, how\r\nfrom the out-sides towards the middle, there is a kind of Radiation or\r\nGrain much resembling this of the Glass-drop; but this Grain is most\r\nconspicuous in Iron-bullets, if they be broken: the same _Phænomena_ may be\r\nproduced by casting _regulus_ of _Antimony_ into a Bullet-mold, as also\r\nwith _Glass of Antimony_, or with almost any such kind of _Vitrified\r\nsubstance_, either cast into a cold Mold or poured into Water.\r\n\r\nOthers of these Drops I heat red hot in the fire, and then suffered them to\r\ncool by degrees. And these I found to have quite lost all their\r\n_fulminating_ or flying quality, as also their hard, brittle and springy\r\ntexture; and to emerge of a much softer temper, and much easier to be\r\nbroken or snapt with ones finger; but its strong and brittle quality was\r\nquite destroyed, and it seemed much of the same consistence with other\r\ngreen Glass well nealed in the Oven.\r\n\r\nThe Figure and bigness of these for the most part was the same with that of\r\nthe Figure Z; that is, all the surface of them was very smooth and polisht,\r\nand for the most part round, but very rugged or knobbed about D, and all\r\nthe length of the stem was here and there pitted or flatted. About D, which\r\nis at the upper part of the drop under that side of the stem which is\r\nconcave, there usually was made some one or more little Hillocks or\r\nProminences. The drop it self, before it be broken, appears very\r\ntransparent, and towards the middle of it, to be very full of small\r\nBubbles, of some kind of aerial substance, which by the refraction of the\r\noutward surface appear much bigger then really they are; and this may be in\r\ngood part removed, by putting the drop under the surface of clear Water,\r\nfor by that means most part of the refraction of the convex Surface of the\r\ndrop is destroyed, and the bubbles will appear much smaller. And this, by\r\nthe by, minds me of the appearing magnitude of the _aperture_ of the\r\n_iris_, or _pupil_ of the eye, which though it appear, and be therefore\r\njudged very large, is yet not above a quarter of the bigness it appears of,\r\nby the _lenticular_ refraction of the _Cornea_.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all which _Phænomena_ I imagine to be no other then this, That\r\nthe Parts of the Glass being by the excessive heat of the fire kept off and\r\nseparated one from another, and thereby put into a kind of sluggish fluid\r\nConsistence, are suffered to drop off with that heat or agitation remaining\r\nin them, into cold Water; by which means the outsides of the drop are\r\npresently cool’d and _crusted_, and are thereby made of a loose texture,\r\nbecause the parts of it have not time to settle themselves leisurely\r\ntogether, and so to lie very close together: And the innermost parts of the\r\ndrop, retaining still much of their former heat and agitations, remain of a\r\nloose texture also, and, according as the cold strikes inwards from the\r\nbottom and sides, are quenched, as it were, and made rigid in that very\r\nposture wherein the cold finds them. For the parts of the _crust_ being\r\nalready hardened, will not suffer the parts to shrink any more from the\r\noutward Surface inward; and though it shrink a little by reason of the\r\nsmall parcels of some Aerial substances dispersed through the matter of the\r\nGlass, yet that is not neer so much as it appears (as I just now hinted;)\r\nnor if it were, would it be sufficient for to consolidate and condense the\r\nbody of Glass into a _tuff_ and close _texture_, after it had been so\r\nexcessively rarified by the heat of the glass-Furnace.\r\n\r\nBut that there may be such an expansion of the aerial substance contained\r\nin those little _blebbs_ or bubbles in the body of the drop, this following\r\nExperiment will make more evident.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake a small Glass-Cane about a foot long, seal up one end of it\r\n_hermetically_, then put in a very small bubble of Glass, almost of the\r\nshape of an Essence-viol with the open mouth towards the sealed end, then\r\ndraw out the other end of the Pipe very small, and fill the whole Cylinder\r\nwith water, then set this Tube by the Fire till the Water begin to boyl,\r\nand the Air in the bubble be in good part rarified and driven out, then by\r\nsucking at the smalling Pipe, more of the Air or vapours in the bubble may\r\nbe suck’d out, so that it may sink to the bottom; when it is sunk to the\r\nbottom, in the flame of a Candle, or Lamp, nip up the slender Pipe and let\r\nit cool: whereupon it is obvious to observe, first, that the Water by\r\ndegrees will subside and shrink into much less room: Next, that the Air or\r\nvapours in the Glass will expand themselves so, as to buoy up the little\r\nGlass: Thirdly, that all about the inside of the Glass-pipe there will\r\nappear an infinite number of small bubbles, which as the Water grows colder\r\nand colder will swell bigger and bigger, and many of them buoy themselves\r\nup and break at the top.\r\n\r\nFrom this _Disceding_ of the heat in Glass drops, that is, by the quenching\r\nor cooling Irradiations propagated from the Surface upwards and inwards, by\r\nthe lines CT, CT, DT, DE, &c. the bubbles in the drop have room to expand\r\nthemselves a little, and the parts of the Glass contract themselves; but\r\nthis operation being too quick for the sluggish parts of the Glass, the\r\ncontraction is performed very unequally and irregularly, and thereby the\r\nParticles of the Glass are bent, some one way, and some another, yet so as\r\nthat most of them draw towards the Pith or middle TEEE, or rather from that\r\noutward: so that they cannot _extricate_ or unbend themselves, till some\r\npart of TEEE be broken and loosened, for all the parts about that are\r\nplaced in the manner of an Arch, and so till their hold at TEEE be loosened\r\nthey cannot fly asunder, but uphold, and shelter, and fix each other much\r\nlike the stones in a Vault, where each stone does concurre to the stability\r\nof the whole Fabrick, and no one stone can be taken away but the whole Arch\r\nfalls. And wheresoever any of those radiating wedges DTD, &c. are removed,\r\nwhich are the component parts of this Arch, the whole Fabrick presently\r\nfalls to pieces; for all the Springs of the several parts are set at\r\nliberty, which immediately extricate themselves and fly asunder every way;\r\neach part by its spring contributing to the darting of it self and some\r\nother contiguous part. But if this drop be heat so hot as that the parts by\r\ndegrees can unbend themselves, and be settled and annealed in that posture,\r\nand be then suffered gently to subside and cool; The parts by this nealing\r\nlosing their springiness, constitute a drop of a more soft but less brittle\r\ntexture, and the parts being not at all under a flexure, though any part of\r\nthe middle or Pith TEEE be broken, yet will not the drop at all fly to\r\npieces as before.\r\n\r\nThis Conjecture of mine I shall indeavour to make out by explaining each\r\nparticular Assertion with _analogous_ Experiments: The Assertions are\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n    First, That the parts of the Glass, whilst in a fluid Consistence and\r\n    hot, are more rarified, or take up more room, then when hard and cold.\r\n\r\n    Secondly, That the parts of the drop do suffer a two-fold contraction.\r\n\r\n    Thirdly, That the dropping or quenching the glowing metal in the Water\r\n    makes it of a hard, springing, and rarified texture.\r\n\r\n    Fourthly, That there is a flexion or force remaining upon the parts of\r\n    the Glass thus quenched, from which they indeavour to extricate\r\n    themselves.\r\n\r\n    Fifthly, That the Fabrick of the drop, that is able to hinder the parts\r\n    from extricating themselves, is _analogus_ to that of an Arch.\r\n\r\n    Sixthly, That the sudden flying asunder of the parts proceeds from\r\n    their springiness.\r\n\r\n    Seventhly, That a gradual heating and cooling does anneal or reduce the\r\n    parts of Glass to a texture that is more loose, and easilier to be\r\n    broken, but not so brittle.\r\n\r\nThat the first of these is true may be gathered from this, That _Heat is a\r\nproperty of a body arising from the motion or agitation of its parts_; and\r\ntherefore whatever body is thereby toucht must necessarily receive some\r\npart of that motion, whereby its parts will be shaken and agitated, and so\r\nby degrees free and extricate themselves from one another, and each part so\r\nmoved does by that motion _exert_ a _conatus_ of _protruding_ and\r\ndisplacing all the adjacent Particles. Thus Air included in a vessel, by\r\nbeing heated will burst it to pieces. Thus have I broke a Bladder held over\r\nthe fire in my hand, with such a violence and noise, that it almost made me\r\ndeaf for the present, and much surpassed the noise of a Musket: The like\r\nhave I done by throwing into the fire small glass Bubbles hermetically\r\nsealed, with a little drop of Water included in them. Thus Water also, or\r\nany other Liquor, included in a convenient vessel, by being warmed,\r\nmanifestly expands it self with a very great violence, so as to break the\r\nstrongest vessel, if when heated it be narrowly imprisoned in it. This is\r\nvery manifest by the _Sealed Thermometers_, which I have, by several\r\ntryals, at last brought to a great certainty and tenderness: for I have\r\nmade some with stems above four foot long, in which the expanding Liquor\r\nwould so far vary, as to be very neer the very top in the heat of Summer,\r\nand prety neer the bottom at the coldest time of the Winter. The Stems I\r\nuse for them are very thick, straight, and even Pipes of Glass, with a very\r\nsmall _perforation_, and both the head and body I have made on purpose at\r\nthe Glass-house, of the same metal whereof the Pipes are drawn: these I can\r\neasily in the flame of a Lamp, urged with the blast of a pair of Bellows,\r\nseal and close together, so as to remain very firm, close and even; by this\r\nmeans I joyn on the body first, and then fill both it and a part of the\r\nstem, proportionate to the length of the stem and the warmth of the season\r\nI fill it in with the best rectified _Spirit of Wine_ highly _ting’d_ with\r\nthe lovely colour of _Cocheneel_, which I deepen the more by pouring some\r\ndrops of common _Spirit of Urine_, which must not be too well rectified,\r\nbecause it will be apt to make the Liquor to curdle and stick in the small\r\nperforation of the stem. This Liquor I have upon tryal found the most\r\ntender of any spirituous Liquor, and those are much more sensibly affected\r\nwith the variations of heat and cold then other more flegmatick and\r\nponderous Liquors, and as capable of receiving a deep tincture, and keeping\r\nit, as any Liquor whatsoever; and (which makes it yet more acceptable) is\r\nnot subject to be frozen by any cold yet known. When I have thus filled it,\r\nI can very easily in the forementioned flame of a Lamp seal and joyn on the\r\nhead of it.\r\n\r\nThen, for graduating the stem, I fix that for the beginning of my division\r\nwhere the surface of the liquor in the stem remains when the ball is placed\r\nin common distilled water, that is so cold that it just begins to freeze\r\nand shoot into flakes; and that mark I fix at a convenient place of the\r\nstem, to make it capable of exhibiting very many degrees of cold, below\r\nthat which is requisite to freeze water: the rest of my divisions, both\r\nabove and below this (which I mark with a [0] or nought) I place according\r\nto the Degrees of _Expansion_, or _Contraction_ of the Liquor in proportion\r\nto the bulk it had when it indur’d the newly mention’d freezing cold. And\r\nthis may be very easily and accurately enough done by this following way;\r\nPrepare a Cylindrical vessel of very thin plate Brass or Silver, ABCD of\r\nthe figure Z; the Diameter AB of whose cavity let be about two inches, and\r\nthe depth BC the same; let each end be cover’d with a flat and smooth plate\r\nof the same substance, closely soder’d on, and in the midst of the upper\r\ncover make a pretty large hole EF, about the bigness of a fifth part of the\r\nDiameter of the other; into this fasten very well with cement a straight\r\nand even Cylindrical pipe of Glass, EFGH, the Diameter of whose cavity let\r\nbe exactly one tenth of the Diameter of the greater Cylinder. Let this pipe\r\nbe mark’d at GH with a Diamant, so that G from E may be distant just two\r\ninches, or the same height with that of the cavity of the greater Cylinder,\r\nthen divide the length EG exactly into 10 parts, so the capacity of the\r\nhollow of each of these divisions will be ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ part of the capacity of\r\nthe greater Cylinder. This vessel being thus prepared, the way of marking\r\nand graduating the _Thermometers_ may be very easily thus performed:\r\n\r\nFill this Cylindrical vessel with the same liquor wherewith the\r\n_Thermometers_ are fill’d, then place both it and the _Thermometer_ you are\r\nto _graduate_, in water that is ready to be frozen, and bring the surface\r\nof the liquor in the _Thermometer_ to the first marke or [0]; then so\r\nproportion the liquor in the Cylindrical vessel, that the surface of it may\r\njust be at the lower end of the small glass-Cylinder; then very gently and\r\ngradually warm the water in which both the _Thermometer_ and this\r\nCylindrical vessel stand, and as you perceive the ting’d liquor to rise in\r\nboth stems, with the point of a Diamond give several marks on the stem of\r\nthe _Thermometer_ at those places, which by comparing the expansion in both\r\nStems, are found to correspond to the divisions of the cylindrical vessel,\r\nand having by this means marked some few of these divisions on the Stem, it\r\nwill be very easie by these to mark all the rest of the Stem, and\r\naccordingly to assign to every division a proper character.\r\n\r\nA _Thermometer_, thus marked and prepared, will be the fittest Instrument\r\nto make a Standard of heat and cold that can be imagined. For being sealed\r\nup, it is not at all subject to variation or wasting, nor is it liable to\r\nbe changed by the varying pressure of the Air, which all other kind of\r\n_Thermometers_ that are open to the Air are liable to. But to proceed.\r\n\r\nThis property of Expansion with Heat, and Contraction with Cold, is not\r\npeculiar to Liquors only, but to all kind of solid Bodies also, especially\r\nMetals, which will more manifestly appear by this Experiment.\r\n\r\nTake the Barrel of a Stopcock of Brass, and let the Key, which is well\r\nfitted to it, be riveted into it, so that it may slip, and be easily turned\r\nround, then heat this Cock in the fire, and you will find the Key so\r\nswollen, that you will not be able to turn it round in the Barrel; but if\r\nit be suffered to cool again, as soon as it is cold it will be as movable,\r\nand as easie to be turned as before.\r\n\r\nThis Quality is also very observable in _Lead_, _Tin_, _Silver_,\r\n_Antimony_, _Pitch_, _Rosin_, _Bees-wax_, _Butter_, and the like; all\r\nwhich, if after they be melted you suffer gently to cool, you shall find\r\nthe parts of the upper Surface to subside and fall inwards, losing that\r\nplumpness and smoothness it had whilst in fusion. The like I have also\r\nobserved in the cooling of _Glass of Antimony_, which does very neer\r\napproach the nature of Glass,\r\n\r\nBut because these are all Examples taken from other materials then Glass,\r\nand argue only, that possibly there may be the like property also in Glass,\r\nnot that really there is; we shall by three or four Experiments indeavour\r\nto manifest that also.\r\n\r\nAnd the First is an Observation that is very obvious even in these very\r\ndrops, to wit, that they are all of them terminated with an unequal or\r\nirregular Surface, especially about the smaller part of the drop, and the\r\nwhole length of the stem; as about D, and from thence to A, the whole\r\nSurface, which would have been round if the drop had cool’d leisurely, is,\r\nby being quenched hastily, very irregularly flatted and pitted; which I\r\nsuppose proceeds partly from the Waters unequally cooling and pressing the\r\nparts of the drop, and partly from the self-contracting or subsiding\r\nquality of the substance of the Glass: For the vehemency of the heat of the\r\ndrop causes such hidden motions and bubbles in the cold Water, that some\r\nparts of the Water bear more forcibly against one part then against\r\nanother, and consequently do more suddenly cool those parts to which they\r\nare contiguous.\r\n\r\nA Second Argument may be drawn from the Experiment of cutting Glasses with\r\na hot Iron. For in that Experiment the top of the Iron heats, and thereby\r\nrarifies the parts of the Glass that lie just before the crack, whence each\r\nof those agitated parts indeavouring to expand its self and get elbow-room,\r\nthrusts off all the rest of the contiguous parts, and consequently promotes\r\nthe crack that was before begun.\r\n\r\nA Third Argument may be drawn from the way of producing a crack in a sound\r\npiece or plate of Glass, which is done two wayes, either First, by suddenly\r\nheating a piece of Glass in one place more then in another. And by this\r\nmeans _chymists_ usually cut off the necks of Glass-bodies, by two kinds of\r\nInstruments, either by a glowing hot round Iron-Ring, which just\r\nincompasses the place that is to be cut, or else by a _Sulphur’d_ Threed,\r\nwhich is often wound about the place where the separation is to be made,\r\nand then fired. Or Secondly, A Glass may be cracked by cooling it suddenly\r\nin any place with Water, or the like, after it has been all leisurely and\r\ngradually heated very hot. Both which _Phænomena_ seem manifestly to\r\nproceed from the _expansion_ and contraction of the parts of the Glass,\r\nwhich is also made more probable by this circumstance which I have\r\nobserved, that a piece of common window-glass being heated in the middle\r\nvery suddenly with a live Coal or hot Iron, does usually at the first crack\r\nfall into pieces, whereas if the Plate has been gradually heated very hot,\r\nand a drop of cold Water and the like be put on the middle of it, it only\r\nflaws it, but does not break it asunder immediately.\r\n\r\nA Fourth Argument may be drawn from this Experiment; Take a Glass-pipe, and\r\nfit into a solid stick of Glass, so as it will but just be moved in it.\r\nThen by degrees heat them whilst they are one within another, and they will\r\ngrow stiffer, but when they are again cold, they will be as easie to be\r\nturned as before. This Expansion of Glass is more manifest in this\r\nExperiment.\r\n\r\nTake a stick of Glass of a considerable length, and fit it so between the\r\ntwo ends or screws of a Lath, that it may but just easily turn, and that\r\nthe very ends of it may be just toucht and susteined thereby; then applying\r\nthe flame of the Candle to the middle of it, and heating it hot, you will\r\npresently find the Glass to stick very fast on those points, and not\r\nwithout much difficulty to be convertible on them, before that by removing\r\nthe flame for a while from it, it be suffered to cool, and when you will\r\nfind it as easie to be turned round as at the first.\r\n\r\nFrom all which Experiments it is very evident, that all those Bodies, and\r\nparticularly Glass, suffers an Expansion by Heat, and that a very\r\nconsiderable one, whilst they are in a state of Fusion. For _Fluidity_, as\r\nI elsewhere mention, _being nothing but an effect of very strong and quick\r\nshaking motion, whereby the parts are, as it were, loosened from each\r\nother, and consequently leave an interjacent space or vacuity_; it follows,\r\nthat all those shaken Particles must necessarily take up much more room\r\nthen when they were at rest, and lay quietly upon each other. And this is\r\nfurther confirmed by a Pot of _boyling Alabaster_, which will manifestly\r\nrise a sixth or eighth part higher in the Pot, whilst it is boyling, then\r\nit will remain at, both before and after it be boyled. The reason of which\r\nodd _Phænomenon_ (to hint it here only by the way) is this, that there is\r\nin the curious powder of Alabaster, and other calcining Stones, a certain\r\nwatery substance, which is so fixt and included with the solid Particles,\r\nthat till the heat be very considerable they will not fly away; but after\r\nthe heat is increased to such a degree, they break out every way in\r\nvapours, and thereby so shake and loosen the small corpuscles of the Powder\r\nfrom each other, that they become perfectly of the nature of a fluid body,\r\nand one may move a stick to and fro through it, and stir it as easily as\r\nwater, and the vapours burst and break out in bubbles just as in boyling\r\nwater, and the like; whereas, both before those watery parts are flying\r\naway, and after they are quite gone; that is, before and after it have done\r\nboyling, all those effects cease, and a stick is as difficultly moved to\r\nand fro in it as in sand, or the like. Which Explication I could easily\r\nprove, had I time; but this is not a fit place for it.\r\n\r\nTo proceed therefore, I say, that the dropping of this expanded Body into\r\ncold Water, does make the parts of the Glass suffer a double contraction:\r\nThe first is, of those parts which are neer the Surface of the Drop. For\r\nCold, as I said before, contracting Bodies, that is, _by the abatement of\r\nthe agitating faculty the parts falling neerer together_; the parts next\r\nadjoyning to the Water must needs lose much of their motion, and impart it\r\nto the Ambient water (which the Ebullition and commotion of it manifests)\r\nand thereby become a solid and hard crust, whilst the innermost parts\r\nremain yet fluid and expanded; whence, as they grow cold also by degrees,\r\ntheir parts must necessarily be left at liberty to be condensed, but\r\nbecause of the hardness of the outward crust, the contraction cannot be\r\nadmitted that way; but there being many very small, and before\r\ninconspicuous, bubbles in the substance of the Glass, upon the subsiding of\r\nthe parts of the Glass, the agil substance contained in them has liberty of\r\nexpanding it self a little, and thereby those bubbles grow much bigger,\r\nwhich is the second Contraction. And both these are confirmed from the\r\nappearance of the Drop it self: for as for the outward parts, we see,\r\nfirst, that it is irregular and shrunk, as it were, which is caused by the\r\nyielding a little of the hardened Skin to a Contraction, after the very\r\noutmost Surface is settled; and as for the internal parts, one may with\r\nones naked Eye perceive abundance of very conspicuous bubbles, and with the\r\n_Microscope_ many more.\r\n\r\nThe Consideration of which Particulars will easily make the Third Position\r\nprobable, that is, that the parts of the drop will be of a very hard,\r\nthough of a rarified Texture; for if the outward parts of the Drop, by\r\nreason of its hard crust, will indure very little Contraction, and the agil\r\nParticles, included in those bubbles, by the losing of their agitation, by\r\nthe decrease of the Heat, lose also most part of their Spring and Expansive\r\npower; it follows (the withdrawing of the heat being very sudden) that the\r\nparts must be left in a very loose Texture, and by reason of the\r\nimplication of the parts one about another, which from their sluggishnes\r\nand glutinousness I suppose to be much after the manner of the sticks in a\r\nThorn-bush, or a Lock of Wool; it will follow, I say, that the parts will\r\nhold each other very strongly together, and indeavour to draw each other\r\nneerer together, and consequently their Texture must be very hard and\r\nstiff, but very much rarified.\r\n\r\nAnd this will make probable my next Position, That _the parts of the Glass\r\nare under a kind of tension or flexure, out of which they indeavour to\r\nextricate and free themselves_, and thereby all the parts draw towards the\r\nCenter or middle, and would, if the outward parts would give way, as they\r\ndo when the outward parts cool leisurely (as in baking of Glasses) contract\r\nthe bulk of the drop into a much less compass. For since, as I proved\r\nbefore, the Internal parts of the drop, when fluid, were of a very rarified\r\nTexture, and, as it were, tos’d open like a Lock of Wool, and if they were\r\nsuffered leisurely to cool, would be again prest, as it were, close\r\ntogether: And since that the heat, which kept them bended and open, is\r\nremoved, and yet the parts not suffered to get as neer together as they\r\nnaturally would; It follows, that the Particles remain under a kind of\r\n_tension_ and _flexure_, and consequently have an indeavour to free\r\nthemselves from that _bending_ and _distension_, which they do, as soon as\r\neither the tip be broken, or as soon as by a leisurely heating and cooling,\r\nthe parts are nealed into another posture.\r\n\r\nAnd this will make my next Position probable, that _the parts of the Glass\r\ndrops are contignated together in the form of an Arch_, cannot any where\r\nyield or be drawn inwards, till by the removing of some one part of it (as\r\nit happens in the removing one of the stones of an Arch) the whole Fabrick\r\nis shatter’d, and falls to pieces, and each of the Springs is left at\r\nliberty, suddenly to extricate it self: for since I have made it probable,\r\nthat the internal parts of the Glass have a contractive power inwards, and\r\nthe external parts are incapable of such a Contraction, and the figure of\r\nit being spherical; it follows, that the superficial parts must bear\r\nagainst each other, and keep one another from being condens’d into a less\r\nroom, in the same manner as the stones of an Arch conduce to the upholding\r\neach other in that Figure. And this is made more probable by another\r\nExperiment which was communicated to me by an excellent Person, whose\r\nextraordinary Abilities in all kind of Knowledg, especially in that of\r\nNatural things, and his generous Disposition in communicating, incouraged\r\nme to have recourse to him on many occasions. The Experiment was this:\r\nSmall Glass-balls (about the bigness of that represented in the _Figure\r\n&._) would, upon rubbing or scratching the inward Surface, fly all\r\ninsunder, with a pretty brisk noise; whereas neither before nor after the\r\ninner Surface had been thus scratcht, did there appear any flaw or crack.\r\nAnd putting the pieces of one of those broken ones together again, the\r\nflaws appeared much after the manner of the black lines on the Figure, _&._\r\nThese Balls were small, but exceeding thick bubbles of Glass, which being\r\ncrack’d off from the _Puntilion_ whilst very hot, and so suffered to cool\r\nwithout nealing them in the Oven over the Furnace, do thereby (being made\r\nof white Glass, which cools much quicker then green Glass, and is thereby\r\nmade much brittler) acquire a very _porous_ and very brittle _texture_: so\r\nthat if with the point of a Needle or Bodkin, the inside of any of them be\r\nrubbed prety hard, and then laid on a Table, it will, within a very little\r\nwhile, break into many pieces with a brisk noise, and throw the parts above\r\na span asunder on the Table: Now though the pieces are not so small as\r\nthose of a _fulminating_ drop, yet they as plainly shew, that the outward\r\nparts of the Glass have a great _Conatus_ to fly asunder, were they not\r\nheld together by the _tenacity_ of the parts of the inward Surface: for we\r\nsee as soon as those parts are crazed by hard rubbing, and thereby their\r\ntenacity spoiled, the springiness of the more outward parts quickly makes a\r\ndivulsion, and the broken pieces will, if the concave Surface of them be\r\nfurther scratcht with a Diamond, fly again into smaller pieces.\r\n\r\nFrom which preceding considerations it will follow Sixthly, That the sudden\r\nflying asunder of the parts as soon as this Arch is any where disordered or\r\nbroken, proceeds from the springing of the parts; which, indeavouring to\r\n_extricate_ themselves as soon as they get the liberty, they perform it\r\nwith such a quickness, that they throw one another away with very great\r\nviolence: for the Particles that compose the Crust have a _Conatus_ to lye\r\nfurther from one another, and therefore as soon as the external parts are\r\nloosened they dart themselves outward with great violence, just as so many\r\nSprings would do, if they were detained and fastened to the body, as soon\r\nas they should be suddenly loosened; and the internal parts drawing inward,\r\nthey contract so violently; that they rebound back again and fly into\r\nmultitude of small shivers or sands. Now though they appear not, either to\r\nthe naked Eye, or the _Microscope_, yet I am very apt to think there may be\r\nabundance of small flaws or cracks, which, by reason the strong reflecting\r\nAir is not got between the _contiguous_ parts, appear not. And that this\r\nmay be so, I argue from this, that I have very often been able to make a\r\ncrack or flaw, in some convenient pieces of Glass, to appear and disappear\r\nat pleasure, according as by pressing together, or pulling asunder the\r\ncontiguous parts, I excluded or admitted the strong reflecting Air between\r\nthe parts: And it is very probable, that there may be some Body, that is\r\neither very rarified Air, or something _analogous_ to it, which fills the\r\nbubbles of these drops; which I argue, first, from the roundness of them,\r\nand next, from the vivid reflection of Light which they exhibite: Now\r\nthough I doubt not, but that the Air in them is very much rarified, yet\r\nthat there is some in them, to such as well consider this Experiment of the\r\ndisappearing of a crack upon the _extruding_ of the Air, I suppose it will\r\nseem more then probable.\r\n\r\nThe Seventh and last therefore that I shall prove, is, _That the gradual\r\nheating and cooling of these so extended bodies does reduce the parts of\r\nthe Glass to a looser and softer temper_. And this I found by heating them,\r\nand keeping them for a prety while very red hot in a fire; for thereby I\r\nfound them to grow a little lighter, and the small Stems to be very easily\r\nbroken and snapt any where, without at all making the drop fly; whereas\r\nbefore they were so exceeding hard, that they could not be broken without\r\nmuch difficulty; and upon their breaking the whole drop would fly in pieces\r\nwith very great violence. The Reason of which last seems to be, that the\r\nleisurely heating and cooling of the parts does not only wast some part of\r\nthe Glass it self, but ranges all the parts into a better order, and gives\r\neach Particle an opportunity of _relaxing_ its self, and consequently\r\nneither will the parts hold so strongly together as before, nor be so\r\ndifficult to be broken: The parts now more easily yielding, nor will the\r\nother parts fly in pieces, because the parts have no bended Springs. The\r\n_relaxation_ also in the temper of hardned Steel, and hammered Metals, by\r\nnealing them in the fire, seems to proceed from much the same cause. For\r\nboth by quenching suddenly such Metals as have _vitrified_ parts\r\ninterspers’d, as Steel has, and by hammering of other kinds that do not so\r\nmuch abound with them, as Silver, Brass, &c. the parts are put into and\r\ndetained in a bended posture, which by the agitation of Heat are shaken,\r\nand loosened, and suffered to unbend themselves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. VIII. _Of the fiery Sparks struck from a Flint or Steel._\r\n\r\nIt is a very common Experiment, by striking with a Flint against a Steel,\r\nto make certain fiery and shining Sparks to fly out from between those two\r\ncompressing Bodies. About eight years since, upon casually reading the\r\nExplication of this odd _Phænomenon_, by the most Ingenious _Des Cartes_, I\r\nhad a great desire to be satisfied, what that Substance was that gave such\r\na shining and bright Light: And to that end I spread a sheet of white\r\nPaper, and on it, observing the place where several of these Sparks seemed\r\nto vanish, I found certain very small, black, but glistering Spots of a\r\nmovable Substance, each of which examining with my _Microscope_, I found to\r\nbe a small round _Globule_; some of which, as they looked prety small, so\r\ndid they from their Surface yield a very bright and strong reflection on\r\nthat side which was next the Light; and each look’d almost like a prety\r\nbright Iron-Ball, whose Surface was prety regular, such as is represented\r\nby the Figure A. In this I could perceive the Image of the Window prety\r\nwell, or of a Stick, which I moved up and down between the Light and it.\r\nOthers I found, which were, as to the bulk of the Ball, prety regularly\r\nround, but the Surface of them, as it was not very smooth, but rough, and\r\nmore irregular, so was the reflection from it more faint and confused. Such\r\nwere the Surfaces of B. C. D. and E. Some of these I found cleft or\r\ncracked, as C, others quite broken in two and hollow, as D. which seemed to\r\nbe half the hollow shell of a Granado, broken irregularly in pieces.\r\nSeveral others I found of other shapes; but that which is represented by E,\r\nI observed to be a very big Spark of fire, which went out upon one side of\r\nthe Flint that I struck fire withall, to which it stuck by the root F, at\r\nthe end of which small Stem was fastened-on a _Hemisphere_, or half a\r\nhollow Ball, with the mouth of it open from the stemwards, so that it\r\nlooked much like a Funnel, or an old fashioned Bowl without a foot. This\r\nnight, making many tryals and observations of this Experiment, I met, among\r\na multitude of the Globular ones which I had observed, a couple of\r\nInstances, which are very remarkable to the confirmation of my\r\n_Hypothesis_.\r\n\r\nAnd the First was of a pretty big Ball fastened on to the end of a small\r\nsliver of Iron, which _Compositum_ seemed to be nothing else but a long\r\nthin chip of Iron, one of whose ends was melted into a small round Globul;\r\nthe other end remaining unmelted and irregular, and perfectly Iron.\r\n\r\nThe Second Instance was not less remarkable then the First; for I found,\r\nwhen a Spark went out, nothing but a very small thin long sliver of Iron or\r\nSteel, unmelted at either end. So that it seems, that some of these Sparks\r\nare the slivers or chips of the Iron _vitrified_, Others are only the\r\nslivers melted into Balls without vitrification, And the third kind are\r\nonly small slivers of the Iron, made red-hot with the violence of the\r\nstroke given on the Steel by the Flint.\r\n\r\nHe that shall diligently examine the _Phænomena_ of this Experiment, will,\r\nI doubt not, find cause to believe, that the reason I have heretofore given\r\nof it, is the true and genuine cause of it, namely, That _the Spark,\r\nappearing so bright in the falling, is nothing else but a small piece of\r\nthe Steel or Flint, but most commonly of the Steel, which by the violence\r\nof the stroke is at the same time sever’d and heat red-hot, and that\r\nsometimes to such a degree, as to make it melt together into a small\r\nGlobule of Steel; and sometimes also is that heat so very intense, as\r\nfurther to melt it and vitrifie it; but many times the heat is so gentle,\r\nas to be able to make the sliver only red hot, which notwithstanding\r\nfalling upon the tinder_ (that is only a very curious small Coal made of\r\nthe small threads of Linnen burnt to coals and char’d) _it easily sets it\r\non fire_. Nor will any part of this _Hypothesis_ seem strange to him that\r\nconsiders, First, that either hammering, or filing or otherwise violently\r\nrubbing of Steel, will presently make it so hot as to be able to burn ones\r\nfingers. Next, that the whole force of the stroke is exerted upon that\r\nsmall part where the Flint and Steel first touch: For the Bodies being each\r\nof them so very hard, the puls cannot be far communicated, that is, the\r\nparts of each can yield but very little, and therefore the violence of the\r\nconcussion will be _exerted_ on that piece of Steel which is cut off by the\r\nFlint. Thirdly, that the filings or small parts of Steel are very apt, as\r\nit were, to take fire, and are presently red hot, that is, there seems to\r\nbe a very _combustible sulphureous_ Body in Iron or Steel, which the Air\r\nvery readily preys upon, as soon as the body is a little violently heated.\r\n\r\nAnd this is obvious in the filings of Steel or Iron cast through the flame\r\nof a Candle; for even by that sudden _transitus_ of the small chips of\r\nIron, they are heat red hot, and that _combustible sulphureous_ Body is\r\npresently prey’d upon and devoured by the _aereal_ incompassing\r\n_Menstruum_, whose office in this Particular I have shewn in the\r\nExplication of Charcole.\r\n\r\nAnd in prosecution of this Experiment, having taken the filings of Iron and\r\nSteel, and with the point of a Knife cast them through the flame of a\r\nCandle, I observed where some conspicuous shining Particles fell, and\r\nlooking on them with my _Microscope_, I found them to be nothing else but\r\nsuch round Globules, as I formerly found the Sparks struck from the Steel\r\nby a stroke to be, only a little bigger; and shaking together all the\r\nfilings that had fallen upon the sheet of Paper underneath and observing\r\nthem with the _Microscope_, I found a great number of small Globules, such\r\nas the former, though there were also many of the parts that had remained\r\nuntoucht and rough filings or chips of Iron. So that, it seems, Iron does\r\ncontain a very _combustible sulphureous_ Body, which is, in all likelihood,\r\none of the causes of this _Phænomenon_, and which may be perhaps very much\r\nconcerned in the business of its hardening and tempering: of which somewhat\r\nis said in the Description of _Muscovy-glass_.\r\n\r\nSo that, these things considered, we need not trouble our selves to find\r\nout what kind of Pores they are, both in the Flint and Steel, that contain\r\nthe _Atoms of fire_, nor how those _Atoms_ come to be hindred from running\r\nall out, when a dore or passage in their Pores is made by the concussion:\r\nnor need we trouble our selves to examine by what _Prometheus_ the Element\r\nof Fire comes to be fetcht down from above the Regions of the Air, in what\r\nCells or Boxes it is kept, and what _Epimetheus_ lets it go: Nor to\r\nconsider what it is that causes so great a conflux of the atomical\r\nParticles of Fire, which are said to fly to a flaming Body, like Vultures\r\nor Eagles to a putrifying Carcass, and there to make a very great pudder.\r\nSince we have nothing more difficult in this _Hypothesis_ to conceive,\r\nfirst, as to the kindling of Tinder, then how a large Iron-bullet, let fall\r\nred or glowing hot upon a heap of Small-coal, should set fire to those that\r\nare next to it first: Nor secondly, is this last more difficult to be\r\nexplicated, then that a Body, as Silver for Instance, put into a weak\r\n_Menstruum_, as unrectified _Aqua fortis_ should, when it is put in a great\r\nheat, be there dissolved by it, and not before; which _Hypothesis_ is more\r\nlargely explicated in the Description of Charcoal. To conclude, we see by\r\nthis Instance, how much Experiments may conduce to the regulating of\r\n_Philosophical notions_. For if the most Acute _Des Cartes_ had applied\r\nhimself experimentally to have examined what substance it was that caused\r\nthat shining of the falling Sparks struck from a Flint and a Steel, he\r\nwould certainly have a little altered his _Hypothesis_, and we should have\r\nfound, that his Ingenious Principles would have admitted a very plausible\r\nExplication of this _Phænomenon_; whereas by not examining so far as he\r\nmight, he has set down an Explication which Experiment do’s contradict.\r\n\r\nBut before I leave this Description, I must not forget to take notice of\r\nthe Globular form into which each of these is most curiously formed. And\r\nthis _Phænomenon_, as I have elsewhere more largely shewn, proceeds from a\r\npropriety which belongs to all kinds of fluid Bodies more or less, and is\r\ncaused by the Incongruity of the Ambient and included Fluid, which so acts\r\nand modulates each other, that they acquire, as neer as is possible, a\r\n_spherical_ or _globular_ form, which propriety and several of the\r\n_Phænomena_ that proceed from it, I have more fully explicated in the sixth\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nOne Experiment, which does very much illustrate my present Explication, and\r\nis in it self exceeding pretty, I must not pass by: And that is a way of\r\nmaking small _Globules_ or _Balls_ of Lead, or Tin, as small almost as\r\nthese of Iron or Steel, and that exceeding easily and quickly, by turning\r\nthe filings or chips of those Metals also into perfectly round _Globules_.\r\nThe way, in short, as I received it from the _Learned Physitian Doctor_\r\nI.G. is this;\r\n\r\nReduce the Metal you would thus shape, into exceeding fine filings, the\r\nfiner the filings are, the finer will the Balls be: _Stratifie_ these\r\nfilings with the fine and well dryed powder of quick Lime in a _Crucible_\r\nproportioned to the quantity you intend to make: When you have thus filled\r\nyour _Crucible_, by continual _stratifications_ of the filings and powder,\r\nso that, as neer as may be, no one of the filings may touch another, place\r\nthe _Crucible_ in a _gradual fire_, and by degrees let it be brought to a\r\nheat big enough to make all the filings, that are mixt with the quick Lime,\r\nto melt, and no more; for if the fire be too hot, many of these filings\r\nwill joyn and run together; whereas if the heat be proportioned, upon\r\nwashing the Lime-dust in fair Water, all those small filings of the Metal\r\nwill subside to the bottom in a most curious powder, consisting all of\r\nexactly round _Globules_, which, if it be very fine, is very excellent to\r\nmake Hour-glasses of.\r\n\r\nNow though quick Lime be the powder that this direction makes choice of,\r\nyet I doubt not, but that there may be much more convenient ones found out,\r\none of which I have made tryal of, and found very effectual; and were it\r\nnot for discovering, by the mentioning of it, another Secret, which I am\r\nnot free to impart, I should have here inserted it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. IX. _Of the Colours observable in Muscovy-Glass, and other thin\r\nBodies_.\r\n\r\nMoscovy-glass, or _Lapis specularis_, is a Body that seems to have as many\r\nCuriosities in its Fabrick as any common Mineral I have met with: for\r\nfirst, It is transparent to a great thickness: Next, it is compounded of an\r\ninfinite number of thin flakes joyned or generated one upon another so\r\nclose & smooth, as with many hundreds of them to make one smooth and thin\r\nPlate of a transparent flexible substance, which with care and diligence\r\nmay be slit into pieces so exceedingly thin as to be hardly perceivable by\r\nthe eye, and yet even those, which I have thought the thinnest, I have with\r\na good _Microscope_ found to be made up of many other Plates, yet thinner;\r\nand it is probable, that, were our _Microscopes_ much better, we might much\r\nfurther discover its divisibility. Nor are these flakes only regular as to\r\nthe smoothness of their Surfaces, but thirdly, In many Plates they may be\r\nperceived to be terminated naturally with edges of the figure of a\r\n_Rhomboeid_. This Figure is much more conspicuous in our English talk, much\r\nwhereof is found in the Lead Mines, and is commonly called _Spar_, and\r\n_Kauck_, which is of the same kind of substance with the _Selenitis_, but\r\nis seldom found in so large flakes as that is, nor is it altogether so\r\ntuff, but is much more clear and transparent, and much more curiously\r\nshaped, and yet may be cleft and flak’d like the other _Selenitis_. But\r\nfourthly, this stone has a property, which in respect of the _Microscope_,\r\nis more notable, and that is, that it exhibits several appearances of\r\nColours, both to the naked Eye, but much more conspicuously to the\r\n_Microscope_; for the exhibiting of which, I took a piece of\r\n_Muscovy-glass_, and splitting or cleaving it into thin Plates, I found\r\nthat up and down in several parts of them I could plainly perceive several\r\nwhite specks or flaws, and others diversly coloured with all the Colours of\r\nthe _Rainbow_; and with the _Microscope_ I could perceive, that these\r\nColours were ranged in rings that incompassed the white speck or flaw, and\r\nwere round or irregular, according to the shape of the spot which they\r\nterminated; and the position of Colours, in respect of one another, was the\r\nvery same as in the _Rainbow_. The consecution of those Colours from the\r\nmiddle of the spot outward being Blew, Purple, Scarlet, Yellow, Green;\r\nBlew, Purple, Scarlet, and so onwards, sometimes half a score times\r\nrepeated, that is, there appeared six, seven, eight, nine or ten several\r\ncoloured rings or lines, each incircling the other, in the same manner as I\r\nhave often seen a very _vivid Rainbow_ to have four or five several Rings\r\nof Colours, that is, accounting all the Gradations between Red and Blew for\r\none: But the order of the Colours in these Rings was quite contrary to the\r\nprimary or innermost _Rainbow_, and the same with those of the secondary or\r\noutermost Rainbow; these coloured Lines or _Irises_, as I may so call them,\r\nwere some of them much brighter then others, and some of them also very\r\nmuch broader, they being some of them ten, twenty, nay, I believe, neer a\r\nhundred times broader then others; and those usually were broadest which\r\nwere neerest the center or middle of the flaw. And oftentimes I found, that\r\nthese Colours reacht to the very middle of the flaw, and then there\r\nappeared in the middle a very large spot, for the most part, all of one\r\ncolour, which was very vivid, and all the other Colours incompassing it,\r\ngradually ascending, and growing narrower towards the edges, keeping the\r\nsame order, as in the _secundary Rainbow_, that is, if the middle were\r\nBlew, the next incompassing it would be a Purple, the third a Red, the\r\nfourth a Yellow, &c. as above; if the middle were a Red, the next without\r\nit would be a Yellow, the third a Green, the fourth a Blew, and so onward.\r\nAnd this order it alwayes kept whatsoever were the middle Colour.\r\n\r\nThere was further observable in several other parts of this Body, many\r\nLines or Threads, each of them of some one peculiar Colour, and those so\r\nexceedingly bright and vivid, that it afforded a very pleasant object\r\nthrough the _Microscope_. Some of these _threads_ I have observed also to\r\nbe pieced or made up of several short lengths of differently coloured\r\n_ends_ (as I may so call them) as a line appearing about two inches long\r\nthrough the _Microscope_, has been compounded of about half an inch of a\r\nPeach colour, ⅛ of a lovely Grass-green, ¾ of an inch more of a bright\r\nScarlet, and the rest of the line of a Watchet blew. Others of them were\r\nmuch otherwise coloured; the variety being almost infinite. Another thing\r\nwhich is very observable, is, that if you find any place where the colours\r\nare very broad and conspicuous to the naked eye, you may, by pressing that\r\nplace with your finger, make the colours change places, and go from one\r\npart to another.\r\n\r\nThere is one _Phænomenon_ more, which may, if care be used, exhibit to the\r\nbeholder, as it has divers times to me, an exceeding pleasant, and not less\r\ninstructive Spectacle; And that is, if curiosity and diligence be used, you\r\nmay so split this admirable Substance, that you may have pretty large\r\nPlates (in companion of those smaller ones which you may observe in the\r\nRings) that are perhaps an ⅛ or a ⅙ part of an inch over, each of them\r\nappearing through the _Microscope_ most curiously, intirely, and uniformly\r\nadorned with some one vivid colour: this, if examined with the\r\n_Microscope_, may be plainly perceived to be in all parts of it equally\r\nthick. Two, three, or more of these lying one upon another, exhibit\r\noftentimes curious compounded colours, which produce such a _Compositum_,\r\nas one would scarce imagine should be the result of such _ingredients_: As\r\nperhaps a _faint yellow_ and a _blew_ may produce a very _deep purple_. But\r\nwhen anon we come to the more strict examination of these _Phænomena_, and\r\nto inquire into the causes and reasons of these productions, we shall, I\r\nhope, make it more conceivable how they are produced, and shew them to be\r\nno other then the natural and necessary effects arising from the peculiar\r\nunion of concurrent causes.\r\n\r\nThese _Phænomena_, being so various, and so truly admirable, it will\r\ncertainly be very well worth our inquiry, to examine the causes and reasons\r\nof them, and to consider, whether from these causes demonstratively\r\nevidenced, may not be deduced the true causes of the production of all kind\r\nof Colours. And I the rather now do it, instead of an Appendix or\r\nDigression to this History, then upon the occasion of examining the Colours\r\nin Peacocks, or other Feathers, because this Subject, as it does afford\r\nmore variety of particular Colours, so does it afford much better wayes of\r\nexamining each circumstance. And this will be made manifest to him that\r\nconsiders, first, that this laminated body is more simple and regular then\r\nthe parts of Peacocks feathers, this consisting only of an indefinite\r\nnumber of plain and smooth Plates, heaped up, or _incumbent_ on each other.\r\nNext, that the parts of this body are much more manageable, to be divided\r\nor joyned, then the parts of a Peacocks feather, or any other substance\r\nthat I know. And thirdly, because that in this we are able from a\r\ncolourless body to produce several coloured bodies, affording all the\r\nvariety of Colours imaginable: And several others, which the subsequent\r\nInquiry will make manifest.\r\n\r\nTo begin therefore, it is manifest from several circumstances, that the\r\nmaterial cause of the _apparition_ of these several Colours, is some\r\n_Lamina_ or Plate of a transparent or pellucid body of a thickness very\r\ndeterminate and proportioned according to the greater or less refractive\r\npower of the _pellucid_ body. And that this is so, abundance of Instances\r\nand particular Circumstances will make manifest.\r\n\r\nAs _first_, if you take any small piece of the _Muscovy-glass_, and with a\r\nNeedle, or some other convenient Instrument, cleave it oftentimes into\r\nthinner and thinner _Laminæ_, you shall find, that till you come to a\r\ndeterminate thinness of them, they shall all appear transparent and\r\ncolourless, but if you continue to split and divide them further, you shall\r\nfind at last, that each Plate, after it comes to such a determinate\r\nthickness, shall appear most lovely ting’d or imbued with a determinate\r\ncolour. If _further_, by any means you so flaw a pretty thick piece, that\r\none part does begin to cleave a little from the other, and between those\r\ntwo there be by any means gotten some pellucid _medium_, those _laminated_\r\npellucid bodies that fill that space, shall exhibit several Rainbows or\r\ncoloured Lines, the colours of which will be disposed and ranged according\r\nto the various thicknesses of the several parts of that Plate. That this is\r\nso, is yet _further_ confirmed by this Experiment.\r\n\r\nTake two small pieces of ground and polisht Looking-glass-plate, each about\r\nthe bigness of a shilling, take these two dry, and with your fore-fingers\r\nand thumbs press them very hard and close together, and you shall find,\r\nthat when they approach each other very near, there will appear several\r\n_Irises_ or coloured Lines, in the same manner almost as in the\r\n_Muscovy-glass_; and you may very easily change any of the Colours of any\r\npart of the interposed body, by pressing the Plates closer and harder\r\ntogether, or leaving them more lax; that is, a part which appeared coloured\r\nwith a red, may be presently ting’d with a yellow, blew, green, purple, or\r\nthe like, by altering the appropinquation of the terminating Plates. Now\r\nthat air is not necessary to be the interposed body, but that any other\r\ntransparent fluid will do much the same, may be tryed by wetting those\r\napproximated Surfaces with Water, or any other transparent Liquor, and\r\nproceeding with it in the same manner as you did with the Air; and you will\r\nfind much the like effect, only with this difference, that those comprest\r\nbodies, which differ most, in their refractive quality, from the\r\ncompressing bodies, exhibit the most strong and vivid tinctures. Nor is it\r\nnecessary, that this _laminated_ and _ting’d_ body should be of a fluid\r\nsubstance, any other substance, provided it be thin enough and transparent,\r\ndoing the same thing: this the _Laminæ_ of our _Muscovy-glass_ hint; but it\r\nmay be confirm’d by multitudes of other Instances.\r\n\r\nAnd first, we shall find, that even Glass it self may, by the help of a\r\nLamp, be blown thin enough to produce these _Phænomena_ of Colours: which\r\n_Phænomena_ accidentally happening, as I have been attempting to frame\r\nsmall Glasses with a Lamp, did not a little surprize me at first, having\r\nnever heard or seen any thing of it before; though afterwards comparing it\r\nwith the _Phænomena_, I had often observed in those Bubbles which Children\r\nuse to make with Soap-water, I did the less wonder; especially when upon\r\nExperiment I found, I was able to produce the same _Phænomena_ in thin\r\nBubbles made with any other transparent Substance. Thus have I produced\r\nthem with Bubbles of _Pitch_, _Rosin_, _Colophony_, _Turpentine_,\r\n_Solutions_ of several _Gums_, as _Gum-Arabick_ in water; any _glutinous_\r\nLiquor, as _Wort_, _Wine_, _Spirit of Wine_, _Oyl of Turpentine_, _Glare of\r\nSnails_, &c.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless to enumerate the several Instances, these being enough\r\nto shew the generality or universality of this propriety. Only I must not\r\nomit, that we have instances also of this kind even in metalline Bodies and\r\nanimal; for those several Colours which are observed to follow each other\r\nupon the polisht surface of hardned Steel, when it is by a sufficient\r\ndegree of heat gradually tempered or softened, are produced, from nothing\r\nelse but a certain thin _Lamina_ of a _vitrum_ or _vitrified_ part of the\r\nMetal, which by that degree of heat, and the concurring action of the\r\nambient Air, is driven out and fixed on the surface of the Steel.\r\n\r\nAnd this hints to me a very probable (at least, if not the true) cause of\r\nthe hardning and tempering of Steel, which has not, I think, been yet\r\ngiven, nor, that I know of been so much as thought of by any. And that is\r\nthis, that the hardness of it arises from a greater proportion of a\r\nvitrified Substance interspersed through the pores of the Steel. And that\r\nthe tempering or softning of it arises from the proportionate or smaller\r\nparcels of it left within those pores. This will seem the more probable, if\r\nwe consider these Particulars.\r\n\r\nFirst, That the pure parts of Metals are of themselves very _flexible_ and\r\n_tuff_; that is, will indure bending and hammering, and yet retain their\r\ncontinuity.\r\n\r\nNext, That the Parts of all vitrified Substances, as all kinds of Glass,\r\nthe _Scoria_ of Metals, &c. are very hard, and also very brittle, being\r\nneither _flexible_ nor _malleable_, but may by hammering or beating be\r\nbroken into small parts or powders.\r\n\r\nThirdly, That all Metals (excepting Gold and Silver, which do not so much\r\nwith the bare fire, unless assisted by other saline Bodies) do more or less\r\n_vitrifie_ by the strength of fire, that is, are corroded by a Saline\r\nSubstance, which I elsewhere shew to be the true cause of fire; and are\r\nthereby, as by several other _Menstruums_ converted into _Scoria_; And this\r\nis called, _calcining_ of them, by Chimists. Thus Iron and Copper by\r\nheating and quenching do turn all of them by degrees into _Scoria_, which\r\nare evidently _vitrified_ Substances, and unite with Glass, and are easily\r\n_fusible_; and when cold, very hard, and very brittle.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That most kind of _Vitrifications_ or _Calcinations_ are made by\r\nSalts, uniting and incorporating with the metalline Particles. Nor do I\r\nknow any one _calcination_ wherein a _Saline_ body may not, with very great\r\nprobability, be said to be an agent or coadjutor.\r\n\r\nFifthly, That Iron is converted into Steel by means of the incorporation of\r\ncertain salts, with which it is kept a certain time in the fire.\r\n\r\nSixthly, That any Iron may, in a very little time, be _case hardned_, as\r\nthe Tradesmen call it, by casing the iron to be hardned with clay, and\r\nputting between the clay and iron a good quantity of a mixture of _Urine_,\r\n_Soot_, _Sea-salt_, and _Horses hoofs_ (all which contein great quantities\r\nof Saline bodies) and then putting the case into a good strong fire, and\r\nkeeping it in a considerable degree of heat for a good while, and\r\nafterwards heating, and quenching or cooling it suddenly in cold water.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, That all kind of vitrify’d substances, by being suddenly cool’d,\r\nbecome very hard and brittle. And thence arises the pretty _Phænomena_ of\r\nthe Glass Drops, which I have already further explained in its own place.\r\n\r\nEighthly, That those metals which are not so apt to vitrifie, do not\r\nacquire any hardness by quenching in water, as Silver, Gold, &c.\r\n\r\nThese considerations premis’d, will, I suppose, make way for the more easie\r\nreception of this following Explication of the _Phænomena_ of hardned and\r\ntemper’d Steel. That Steel is a substance made out of Iron, by means of a\r\ncertain proportionate _Vitrification_ of several parts, which are so\r\ncuriously and proportionately mixt with the more tough and unalter’d parts\r\nof the Iron, that when by the great heat of the fire this vitrify’d\r\nsubstance is melted, and consequently rarify’d, and thereby the pores of\r\nthe Iron are more open, if then by means of dipping it in cold water it be\r\nsuddenly cold, and the parts hardned, that is, stay’d in that same degree\r\nof _Expansion_ they were in when hot, the parts become very hard and\r\nbrittle, and that upon the same account almost as small parcels of glass\r\nquenched in water grow brittle, which we have already explicated. If after\r\nthis the piece of Steel be held in some convenient heat, till by degrees\r\ncertain colours appear upon the surface of the brightned metal, the very\r\nhard and brittle tone of the metal, by degrees relaxes and becomes much\r\nmore tough and soft; namely, the action of the heat does by degrees loosen\r\nthe parts of the Steel that were before streached or set _atilt_ as it\r\nwere, and stayed open by each other, whereby they become relaxed and set at\r\nliberty, whence some of the more brittle interjacent parts are thrust out\r\nand melted into a thin skin on the surface of the Steel, which from no\r\ncolour increases to a deep Purple, and so onward by these _gradations_ or\r\nconsecutions, _White, Yellow, Orange, Minium, Scarlet, Purple, Blew,\r\nWatchet_, &c. and the parts within are more conveniently, and\r\nproportionately mixt; and so they gradually subside into a texture which is\r\nmuch better proportion’d and closer joyn’d, whence that rigidness of parts\r\nceases, and the parts begin to acquire their former _ductilness_.\r\n\r\nNow, that ’tis nothing but the vitrify’d metal that sticks upon the surface\r\nof the colour’d body, is evident from this, that if by any means it be\r\nscraped and rubb’d off, the metal underneath it is white and clear; and if\r\nit be kept longer in the fire, so as to increase to a considerable\r\nthickness, it may, by blows, be beaten off in flakes. This is further\r\nconfirm’d by this observable, that that Iron or Steel will keep longer from\r\nrusting which is covered with this vitrify’d case: Thus also Lead will, by\r\ndegrees, be all turn’d into a litharge; for that colour which covers the\r\ntop being scum’d or shov’d aside, appears to be nothing else but a litharge\r\nor vitrify’d Lead.\r\n\r\nThis is observable also in some sort, on Brass, Copper, Silver, Gold, Tin,\r\nbut is most conspicuous in Lead: all those Colours that cover the surface\r\nof the Metal being nothing else, but a very thin vitrifi’d part of the\r\nheated Metal.\r\n\r\nThe other Instance we have, is in Animal bodies, as in Pearls, Mother of\r\nPearl-shels, Oyster-shels, and almost all other kinds of stony shels\r\nwhatsoever. This have I also sometimes with pleasure observ’d even in\r\nMuscles and Tendons. Further, if you take any glutinous substance and run\r\nit exceedingly thin upon the surface of a smooth glass or a polisht\r\nmetaline body, you shall find the like effects produced: and in general,\r\nwheresoever you meet with a transparent body thin enough, that is\r\nterminated by reflecting bodies of differing refractions from it, there\r\nwill be a production of these pleasing and lovely colours.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary, that the two _terminating_ Bodies should be both of\r\nthe same kind, as may appear by the _vitrified Laminæ_ on _Steel_, _Lead_,\r\nand other Metals, one surface of which _Laminæ_ is contiguous to the\r\nsurface of the Metal, the other to that of the Air.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary, that these colour’d _Laminæ_ should be of an even\r\nthickness, that is, should have their edges and middles of equal thickness,\r\nas in a Looking-glass-plate, which circumstance is only requisite to make\r\nthe Plate appear all of the same colour; but they may resemble a _Lens_,\r\nthat is, have their middles thicker then their edges; or else a _double\r\nconcave_, that is, be thinner in the middle then at the edges; in both\r\nwhich cases there will be various coloured rings or lines, with differing\r\nconsecutions or orders of Colours; the order of the first from the middle\r\noutwards being Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, &c. And the latter quite contrary.\r\n\r\nBut further, it is altogether necessary, that the Plate, in the places\r\nwhere the Colours appear, should be of a determinate thickness: First, It\r\nmust not be more then such a thickness, for when the Plate is increased to\r\nsuch a thickness, the Colours cease; and besides, I have seen in a thin\r\npiece of _Muscovy-glass_, where the two ends of two Plates, which appearing\r\nboth single, exhibited two distinct and differing Colours; but in that\r\nplace where they were united, and constituted one double Plate (as I may\r\ncall it) they appeared transparent and colourless. Nor, Secondly, may the\r\nPlates be _thinner_ then such a determinate _cize_; for we alwayes find,\r\nthat the very outmost Rim of these flaws is terminated in a white and\r\ncolourless Ring.\r\n\r\nFurther, in this Production of Colours there is no need of a determinate\r\nLight of such a bigness and no more, nor of a determinate position of that\r\nLight, that it should be on this side, and not on that side; nor of a\r\nterminating shadow, as in the Prisme, and Rainbow, or Water-ball: for we\r\nfind, that the Light in the open Air, either in or out of the Sun-beams,\r\nand within a Room, either from one or many Windows, produces much the same\r\neffect: only where the Light is brightest, there the Colours are most\r\n_vivid_. So does the light of a Candle, collected by a Glass-ball. And\r\nfurther, it is all one whatever side of the coloured Rings be towards the\r\nlight; for the whole Ring keeps its proper Colours from the middle outwards\r\nin the same order as I before related, without varying at all, upon\r\nchanging the position of the light.\r\n\r\nBut above all it is most observable, that here are all kind of Colours\r\ngenerated in a _pellucid_ body, where there is properly no such refraction\r\nas _Des Cartes_ supposes his _Globules_ to acquire a _verticity_ by: For in\r\nthe plain and even Plates it is manifest, that the second refraction\r\n(according to _Des Cartes_ his Principles in the _fifth Section of the\r\neighth Chapter of his Meteors_) does regulate and restore the supposed\r\n_turbinated Globules_ unto their former uniform motion. This Experiment\r\ntherefore will prove such a one as our _thrice excellent Verulam_ calls\r\n_Experimentum Crucis_, serving as a Guide or Land-mark, by which to direct\r\nour course in the search after the true cause of Colours. Affording us this\r\nparticular negative Information, that for the production of Colours there\r\nis not necessary either a great refraction, as in the Prisme; nor Secondly,\r\na determination of Light and shadow, such as is both in the Prisme and\r\nGlass-ball. Now that we may see likewise what affirmative and positive\r\nInstruction it yields, it will be necessary, to examine it a little more\r\nparticularly and strictly; which that we may the better do, it will be\r\nrequisite to premise somewhat in general concerning the nature of Light and\r\nRefraction.\r\n\r\nAnd first for Light it seems very manifest, that there is no luminous Body\r\nbut has the parts of it in motion more or less.\r\n\r\nFirst, That all kind of _fiery burning Bodies_ have their parts in motion,\r\nI think, will be very easily granted me. That the _spark_ struck from a\r\nFlint and Steel is in a rapid agitation, I have elsewhere made probable.\r\nAnd that the Parts of _rotten Wood_, _rotten Fish_ and the like, are also\r\nin motion, I think, will as easily be conceded by those, who consider, that\r\nthose parts never begin to shine till the Bodies be in a state of\r\nputrefaction; and that is now generally granted by all, to be caused by the\r\nmotion of the parts of putrifying bodies. That the _Bononian stone_ shines\r\nno longer then it is either warmed by the Sun-beams, or by the flame of a\r\nFire or of a Candle, is the general report of those that write of it, and\r\nof others that have seen it. And that heat argues a motion of the internal\r\nparts is (as I said before) generally granted.\r\n\r\nBut there is one Instance more, which was first shewn to the _Royal\r\nSociety_ by Mr. _Clayton_ a worthy Member thereof, which does make this\r\nAssertion more evident then all the rest: And that is, That a _Diamond_\r\nbeing _rub’d_, _struck_ or _heated_ in the dark, shines for a pretty while\r\nafter, so long as that motion, which is imparted by any of those Agents,\r\nremains (in the same manner as a Glass, rubb’d, struck, or (by a means\r\nwhich I shall elsewhere mention) heated, yields a sound which lasts as long\r\nas the vibrating motion of that _sonorous_ body) several Experiments made\r\non which Stone, are since published in a Discourse of Colours, by the truly\r\nhonourable Mr. _Boyle_. What may be said of those _Ignes fatui_ that appear\r\nin the night, I cannot so well affirm, having never had the opportunity to\r\nexamine them my self, nor to be inform’d by any others that had observ’d\r\nthem: And the relations of them in Authors are so imperfect, that nothing\r\ncan be built on them. But I hope I shall be able in another place to make\r\nit at least very probable, that there is even in those also a Motion which\r\ncauses this effect. That the shining of _Sea-water_ proceeds from the same\r\ncause, may be argued from this, That it shines not till either it be beaten\r\nagainst a Rock, or be some other wayes broken or agitated by Storms, or\r\nOars, or other _percussing_ bodies. And that the Animal _Energies_ or\r\nSpirituous _agil_ parts are very active in _Cats eyes_ when they shine,\r\nseems evident enough, because their eyes never shine but when they look\r\nvery intensly either to find their prey, or being hunted in a dark room,\r\nwhen they seek after their adversary, or to find a way to escape. And the\r\nlike may be said of the shining _Bellies of Gloworms_; since ’tis evident\r\nthey can at pleasure either increase or extinguish that Radiation.\r\n\r\nIt would be somewhat too long a work for this place _Zetetically_ to\r\nexamine, and positively to prove, what particular kind of motion it is that\r\nmust be the efficient of Light; for though it be a motion, yet ’tis not\r\nevery motion that produces it, since we find there are many bodies very\r\nviolently mov’d, which yet afford not such an effect; and there are other\r\nbodies, which to our other senses, seem not mov’d so much, which yet shine.\r\nThus Water and quick-silver, and most other liquors heated, shine not; and\r\nseveral hard bodies, as Iron, Silver, Brass, Copper, Wood, &c. though very\r\noften struck with a hammer, shine not presently, though they will all of\r\nthem grow exceeding hot; whereas rotten Wood, rotten Fish, Sea-water,\r\nGloworms, &c. have nothing of tangible heat in them, and yet (where there\r\nis no stronger light to affect the Sensory) they shine some of them so\r\nVividly, that one may make a shift to read by them.\r\n\r\nIt would be too long, I say, here to insert the discursive progress by\r\nwhich I inquir’d after the proprieties of the motion of Light, and\r\ntherefore I shall only add the result.\r\n\r\nAnd, First, I found it ought to be exceeding _quick_, such as those\r\nmotions of _fermentation_ and _putrefaction_, whereby, certainly, the\r\nparts are exceeding nimbly and violently mov’d; and that, because we\r\nfind those motions are able more minutely to shatter and divide the\r\nbody, then the most violent heats or _menstruums_ we yet know. And that\r\nfire is nothing else but such a _dissolution_ of the Burning body, made\r\nby the most _universal menstruum_ of all _sulphureous bodies_, namely,\r\nthe Air, we shall in an other place of this Tractate endeavour to make\r\nprobable. And that, in all extreamly hot shining bodies, there is a\r\nvery quick motion that causes Light, as well as a more robust that\r\ncauses Heat, may be argued from the celerity wherewith the bodyes are\r\ndissolv’d.\r\n\r\nNext, it must be a _Vibrative motion_. And for this the newly mention’d\r\n_Diamond_ affords us a good argument; since if the motion of the parts did\r\nnot return, the Diamond must after many rubbings decay and be wasted: but\r\nwe have no reason to suspect the latter, especially if we consider the\r\nexceeding difficulty that is found in cutting or wearing away a Diamond.\r\nAnd a Circular motion of the parts is much more improbable, since, if that\r\nwere granted, and they be suppos’d irregular and Angular parts, I see not\r\nhow the parts of the Diamond should hold so firmly together, or remain in\r\nthe same sensible dimensions, which yet they do. Next, if they be\r\n_Globular_, and mov’d only with a _turbinated_ motion, I know not any cause\r\nthat can impress that motion upon the _pellucid medium_, which yet is done.\r\nThirdly, any other _irregular_ motion of the parts one amongst another,\r\nmust necessarily make the body of a fluid consistence, from which it is far\r\nenough. It must therefore be a _Vibrating_ motion.\r\n\r\nAnd Thirdly, That it is a very _short-vibrating motion_, I think the\r\ninstances drawn from the shining of Diamonds will also make probable. For a\r\nDiamond being the hardest body we yet know in the World, and consequently\r\nthe least apt to yield or bend, must consequently also have its\r\n_vibrations_ exceeding short.\r\n\r\nAnd these, I think, are the three principal proprieties of a motion,\r\nrequisite to produce the effect call’d Light in the Object.\r\n\r\nThe next thing we are to consider, is the way or manner of the _trajection_\r\nof this motion through the interpos’d pellucid body to the eye: And here it\r\nwill be easily granted,\r\n\r\nFirst, That it must be a body _susceptible_ and _impartible_ of this motion\r\nthat will deserve the name of a Transparent. And next, that the parts of\r\nsuch a body must be _Homogeneous_, or of the same kind. Thirdly, that the\r\nconstitution and motion of the parts must be such, that the appulse of the\r\nluminous body may be communicated or propagated through it to the greatest\r\nimaginable distance in the least imaginable time, though I see no reason to\r\naffirm, that it must be in an instant: For I know not any one Experiment or\r\nobservation that does prove it. And, whereas it may be objected, That we\r\nsee the Sun risen at the very instant when it is above the sensible\r\nHorizon, and that we see a Star hidden by the body of the Moon at the same\r\ninstant, when the Star, the Moon, and our Eye are all in the same line; and\r\nthe like Observations, or rather suppositions, may be urg’d. I have this to\r\nanswer, That I can as easily deny as they affirm; for I would fain know by\r\nwhat means any one can be assured any more of the Affirmative, then I of\r\nthe Negative. If indeed the propagation were very slow, ’tis possible\r\nsomething might be discovered by Eclypses of the Moon; but though we should\r\ngrant the progress of the light from the Earth to the Moon, and from the\r\nMoon back to the Earth again to be full two Minutes in performing, I know\r\nnot any possible means to discover it; nay, there may be some instances\r\nperhaps of Horizontal Eclypses that may seem very much to favour this\r\nsupposition of the slower progression of Light then most imagine. And the\r\nlike may be said of the Eclypses of the Sun, &c. But of this only by the\r\nby. Fourthly, That the motion is propagated every way through an\r\n_Homogeneous medium_ by _direct_ or _straight_ lines extended every way\r\nlike Rays from the center of a Sphere. Fifthly, in an _Homogeneous medium_\r\nthis motion is propagated every way with _equal velocity_, whence\r\nnecessarily every _pulse_ or _vibration_ of the luminous body will generate\r\na Sphere, which will continually increase, and grow bigger, just after the\r\nsame manner (though indefinitely swifter) as the waves or rings on the\r\nsurface of the water do swell into bigger and bigger circles about a point\r\nof it, where, by the sinking of a Stone the motion was begun, whence it\r\nnecessarily follows, that all the parts of these Spheres undulated through\r\nan _Homogeneous medium_ cut the Rays at right angles.\r\n\r\nBut because all transparent _mediums_ are not _Homogeneous_ to one another,\r\ntherefore we will next examine how this pulse or motion will be propagated\r\nthrough differingly transparent _mediums_. And here, according to the most\r\nacute and excellent Philosopher _Des Cartes_, I suppose the sign of the\r\nangle of inclination in the first _medium_ to be to the sign of refraction\r\nin the second, As the density of the first, to the density of the second.\r\nBy density, I mean not the density in respect of gravity (with which the\r\nrefractions or transparency of _mediums_ hold no proportion) but in respect\r\nonely to the _trajection_ of the Rays of light, in which respect they only\r\ndiffer in this; that the one propagates the pulse more easily and weakly,\r\nthe other more slowly, but more strongly. But as for the pulses themselves,\r\nthey will by the refraction acquire another propriety, which we shall now\r\nendeavour to explicate.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose therefore in the first Figure ACFD to be a physical Ray, or\r\nABC and DEF to be two Mathematical Rays, _trajected_ from a very remote\r\npoint of a luminous body through an _Homogeneous_ transparent _medium_ LLL,\r\nand DA, EB, FC, to be small portions of the orbicular impulses which must\r\ntherefore cut the Rays at right angles; these Rays meeting with the plain\r\nsurface NO of a _medium_ that yields an easier _transitus_ to the\r\npropagation of light, and falling _obliquely_ on it, they will in the\r\n_medium_ MMM be refracted towards the perpendicular of the surface. And\r\nbecause this _medium_ is more easily _trajected_ then the former by a\r\nthird, therefore the point C of the orbicular pulse FC will be mov’d to H\r\nfour spaces in the same time that F the other end of it is mov’d to G three\r\nspaces, therefore the whole refracted pulse GH shall be _oblique_ to the\r\nrefracted Rays CHK and GI; and the angle GHC shall be an acute, and so much\r\nthe more acute by how much the greater the refraction be, then which\r\nnothing is more evident, for the sign of the inclination is to the sign of\r\nrefraction as GF to TC the distance between the point C and the\r\nperpendicular from G on CK, which being as four to three, HC being longer\r\nthen GF is longer also then TC, therefore the angle GHC is less than GTC.\r\nSo that henceforth the parts of the pulses GH and IK are mov’d ascew, or\r\ncut the Rays at _oblique_ angles.\r\n\r\nIt is not my business in this place to set down the reasons why this or\r\nthat body should impede the Rays more, others less: as why Water should\r\ntransmit the Rays more easily, though more weakly than air. Onely thus much\r\nin general I shall hint, that I suppose the _medium_ MMM to have less of\r\nthe transparent undulating subtile matter, and that matter to be less\r\nimplicated by it, whereas LLL I suppose to contain a greater quantity of\r\nthe fluid undulating substance, and this to be more implicated with the\r\nparticles of that _medium_.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed, the same kind of _obliquity_ of the Pulses and Rays will\r\nhappen also when the refraction is made out of a more easie into a more\r\ndifficult _mediu_; as by the calculations of GQ & CSR which are refracted\r\nfrom the perpendicular. In both which calculations ’tis _obvious_ to\r\nobserve, that always that part of the Ray towards which the refraction is\r\nmade has the end of the _orbicular pulse_ precedent to that of the other\r\nside. And always, the oftner the refraction is made the same way, Or the\r\ngreater the single refraction is, the more is this unequal progress. So\r\nthat having found this odd propriety to be an inseparable concomitant of a\r\nrefracted Ray, not streightned by a contrary refraction, we will next\r\nexamine the refractions of the Sun-beams, as they are suffer’d onely to\r\npass through a small passage, _obliquely_ out of a more difficult, into a\r\nmore easie _medium_.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose therefore ABC in the second Figure to represent a large\r\n_Chemical Glass-body_ about two foot long, filled with very fair Water as\r\nhigh as AB, and inclin’d in a convenient posture with B towards the Sun:\r\nLet us further suppose the top of it to be cover’d with an _opacous_ body,\r\nall but the hole ab, through which the Sun-beams are suffer’d to pass into\r\nthe Water, and are thereby refracted to cdef, against which part, if a\r\nPaper be expanded on the outside, there will appear all the colours of the\r\nRainbow, that is, there will be generated the two principal colours,\r\n_Scarlet_ and _Blue_, and all the _intermediate_ ones which arise from the\r\ncomposition and dilutings of these two, that is, cd shall exhibit a\r\n_Scarlet_, which toward d is diluted into a _Yellow_; this is the\r\nrefraction of the Ray, ik, which comes from the underside of the Sun; and\r\nthe Ray ef shall appear of a deep _Blue_, which is gradually towards e\r\ndiluted into a pale _Watchet-blue_. Between d and e the two _diluted_\r\ncolours. _Blue_ and _Yellow_ are mixt and compounded into a _Green_; and\r\nthis I imagine to be the reason why _Green_ is so acceptable a colour to\r\nthe eye, and that either of the two extremes are, if intense, rather a\r\nlittle offensive, namely, the being plac’d in the middle between the two\r\nextremes, and compounded out of both those, _diluted_ also, or somewhat\r\nqualifi’d, for the _composition_, arising from the mixture of the two\r\nextremes _undiluted_, makes a _Purple_, which though it be a lovely colour,\r\nand pretty acceptable to the eye, yet is it nothing comparable to the\r\nravishing pleasure with which a curious and well tempered _Green_ affects\r\nthe eye. If removing the Paper, the eye be plac’d against cd, it will\r\nperceive the lower side of the Sun (or a Candle at night which is much\r\nbetter, because it offends not the eye, and is more easily manageable) to\r\nbe of a deep _Red_, and if against ef it will perceive the upper part of\r\nthe luminous body to be of a deep _Blue_; and these colours will appear\r\ndeeper and deeper, according as the Rays from the luminous body fall more\r\n_obliquely_ on the surface of the Water, and thereby suffer a greater\r\nrefraction, and the more distinct, the further cdef is removed from the\r\ntrajecting hole.\r\n\r\nSo that upon the whole, we shall find that the reason of the _Phænomena_\r\nseems to depend upon the _obliquity_ of the _orbicular pulse_, to the Lines\r\nof Radiation, and in particular, that the Ray cd which constitutes the\r\n_Scarlet_ has its inner parts, namely those which are next to the middle of\r\nthe luminous body, precedent to the outermost which are contiguous to the\r\ndark and _unradiating_ skie. And that the Ray ef which gives a _Blue_, has\r\nits outward part, namely, that which is contiguous to the dark skie\r\nprecedent to the pulse from the innermost, which borders on the bright\r\n_area_ of the luminous body.\r\n\r\nWe may observe further, that the cause of the _diluting_ of the colours\r\ntowards the middle, proceeds partly from the wideness of the hole through\r\nwhich the Rays pass, whereby the Rays from several parts of the luminous\r\nbody, fall upon many of the same parts between c and f as is more manifest\r\nby the Figure: And partly also from the nature of the refraction it self,\r\nfor the vividness or strength of the two terminating colours, arising\r\nchiefly as we have seen, from the very great difference that is betwixt the\r\noutsides of those _oblique undulations_ & the dark Rays circumambient, and\r\nthat disparity betwixt the _approximate_ Rays, decaying gradually: the\r\nfurther inward toward the middle of the luminous body they are remov’d, the\r\nmore must the colour approach to a white or an undisturbed light.\r\n\r\nUpon the calculation of the refraction and reflection from a Ball of Water\r\nor Glass, we have much the same _Phænomena_, namely, an _obliquity_ of the\r\nundulation in the same manner as we have found it here. Which, because it\r\nis very much to our present purpose, and affords such an _Instancia\r\ncrucis_, as no one that I know has hitherto taken notice of, I shall\r\nfurther examine. For it does very plainly and positively distinguish, and\r\nshew, which of the two _Hypotheses_, either the _Cartesian_ or this is to\r\nbe followed, by affording a generation of all the colors in the Rainbow,\r\nwhere according to the _Cartesian Principles_ there should be none at all\r\ngenerated. And secondly, by affording an instance that does more closely\r\nconfine the cause of these _Phænomena_ of colours to this present\r\n_Hypothesis_.\r\n\r\nAnd first, for the _Cartesian_, we have this to object against it, That\r\nwhereas he says (_Meteorum Cap. 8. Sect. 5._) _Sed judicabam unicam\r\n(refractione scilicet) ad minimum requiri, & quidem talem ut ejus effectus\r\naliâ contrariâ (refractione) non destruatur: Nam experientia docet si\r\nsuperficies _NM_ & _NP_ (nempe refringentes) Parallelæ forent, radios\r\ntantundem per alteram iterum erectos quantum per unam frangerentur, nullos\r\ncolores depicturos_; This Principle of his holds true indeed in a prisme\r\nwhere the refracting surfaces are plain, but is contradicted by the Ball or\r\nCylinder, whether of Water or Glass, where the refracting surfaces are\r\nOrbicular or Cylindrical. For if we examine the passage of any _Globule_ or\r\nRay of the primary _Iris_, we shall find it to pass out of the Ball or\r\nCylinder again, with the same inclination and refraction that it enter’d in\r\nwithall, and that that last refraction by means of the _intermediate_\r\nreflection shall be the same as if without any reflection at all the Ray\r\nhad been twice refracted by two Parallel surfaces.\r\n\r\nAnd that this is true, not onely in one, but in every Ray that goes to the\r\nconstitution of the Primary Iris; nay, in every Ray, that suffers only two\r\nrefractions, and one reflection, by the surface of the round body, we shall\r\npresently see most evident, if we repeat the _Cartesian Scheme_, mentioned\r\nin the tenth _Section_ of the eighth _Chapter_ of his _Meteors_, where\r\nEFKNP in the third Figure[9] is one of the Rays of the Primary Iris, twice\r\nrefracted at F and N, and once reflected at K by the surface of the\r\nWater-ball. For, first it is evident, that KF and KN are equal, because KN\r\nbeing the reflected part of KF they have both the same inclination on the\r\nsurface K that is the angles FKT, and NKV made by the two Rays and the\r\nTangent of K are equal, which is evident by the Laws of reflection; whence\r\nit will follow also, that KN has the same inclination on the surface N, or\r\nthe Tangent of it XN that the Ray KF has to the surface F, or the Tangent\r\nof it FY, whence it must necessarily follow, that the refractions at F and\r\nN are equal, that is, KFE and KNP are equal. Now, that the surface N is by\r\nthe reflection at K made parallel to the surface at F, is evident from the\r\nprinciples of reflection; for reflection being nothing but an inverting of\r\nthe Rays, if we re-invert the Ray KNP, and make the same inclinations below\r\nthe line TKV that it has above, it will be most evident, that KH the\r\ninverse of KN will be the continuation of the line FK, and that LHI the\r\ninverse of OX is parallel to FY. And HM the inverse of NP is Parallel to EF\r\nfor the angle KHI is equal to KNO which is equal to KFY, and the angle KHM\r\nis equal to KNP which is equal to KFE which was to be prov’d.\r\n\r\nSo that according to the above mentioned _Cartesian_ principles there\r\nshould be generated no colour at all in a Ball of Water or Glass by two\r\nrefractions and one reflection, which does hold most true indeed, if the\r\nsurfaces be plain, as may be experimented with any kind of prisme where the\r\ntwo refracting surfaces are equally inclin’d to the reflecting; but in this\r\nthe _Phænomena_ are quite otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe cause therefore of the generation of colour must not be what _Des\r\nCartes_ assigns, namely, a certain _rotation_ of the _Globuli ætherei_,\r\nwhich are the particles which he supposes to constitute the _Pellucid\r\nmedium_, But somewhat else, perhaps what we have lately supposed, and shall\r\nby and by further prosecute and explain.\r\n\r\nBut, First I shall crave leave to propound some other difficulties of his,\r\nnotwithstanding exceedingly ingenious _Hypothesis_, which I plainly confess\r\nto me seem such; and those are,\r\n\r\nFirst, if that light be (as is affirmed, _Diopt._ cap. 1. §. 8.) not so\r\nproperly a motion, as an action or propension to motion, I cannot conceive\r\nhow the eye can come to be sensible of the _verticity_ of a _Globule_,\r\nwhich is generated in a drop of Rain, perhaps a mile off from it. For that\r\n_Globule_ is not carry’d to the eye according to his formerly recited\r\nPrinciple; and if not so, I cannot conceive how it can communicate its\r\n_rotation_, or circular motion to the line of the _Globules_ between the\r\ndrop and the eye. It cannot be by means of every ones turning the next\r\nbefore him; for if so, then onely all the _Globules_ that are in the odd\r\nplaces must be turned the same way with the first, namely, the 3. 5. 7. 9.\r\n11, &c. but all the _Globules_ interposited between them in the even\r\nplaces; namely, the 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. &c. must be the quite contrary, whence,\r\naccording to the _Cartesian Hypothesis_, there must be no distinct colour\r\ngenerated, but a confusion. Next, since the _Cartesian Globuli_ are\r\nsuppos’d (_Principiorum Philosoph._ Part. 3. §. 86.) to be each of them\r\ncontinually in motion about their centers, I cannot conceive how the eye is\r\nable to distinguish this new generated motion from their former inherent\r\none, if I may so call that other wherewith they are mov’d or _turbinated_,\r\nfrom some other cause than refraction. And thirdly, I cannot conceive how\r\nthese motions should not happen sometimes to oppose each other, and then,\r\nin stead of a _rotation_, there would be nothing but a direct motion\r\ngenerated, and consequently no colour. And fourthly, I cannot conceive, how\r\nby the _Cartesian Hypothesis_ it is possible to give any plausible reason\r\nof the nature of the Colours generated in the thin _laminæ_ of these our\r\n_Microscopical Observations_; for in many of these, the refracting and\r\nreflecting surfaces are parallel to each other, and consequently no\r\n_rotation_ can be generated, nor is there any necessity of a shadow or\r\ntermination of the bright Rays, such as is suppos’d (_Chap._ 8. §. 5. _Et\r\npræterea observavi umbram quoque, aut limitationem luminis requiri:_ and\r\n_Chap._ 8. §. 9.) to be necessary to the generation of any distinct\r\ncolours; Besides that, here is oftentimes one colour generated without any\r\nof the other appendant ones, which cannot be by the _Cartesian Hypothesis_.\r\n\r\nThere must be therefore some other propriety of refraction that causes\r\ncolour. And upon the examination of the thing, I cannot conceive any one\r\nmore general, inseparable, and sufficient, than that which I have before\r\nassign’d. That we may therefore see how exactly our _Hypothesis_ agrees\r\nalso with the _Phænomena_ of the refracting round body, whether _Globe_ or\r\n_Cylinder_, we shall next subjoyn our _Calculation_ or _Examen_ of it.\r\n\r\nAnd to this end, we will calculate any two Rays: as for instance;[10] let\r\nEF be a Ray cutting the _Radius_ CD (divided into 20. parts) in G 16. parts\r\ndistant from C, and ef another Ray, which cuts the same _Radius_ in g 17.\r\nparts distant, these will be refracted to K and k, and from thence\r\nreflected to N and n, and from thence refracted toward P and p; therefore\r\nthe Arch Ff will be 5.d 5′. The Arch FK 106.d 30′. the Arch fk 101.d 2′.\r\nThe line FG 6000. and fg 5267. therefore hf. 733. therefore Fc 980, almost.\r\nThe line FK 16024. and fk 15436. therefore Nd 196. and no 147 almost, the\r\nline Nn 1019 the Arch Nn 5.d 51′. therefore the Angle Nno is 34.d 43′.\r\ntherefore the Angle Non is 139.d 56′. which is almost 50.d more than a\r\nright Angle.\r\n\r\nIt is evident therefore by this _Hypothesis_, that at the same time that ef\r\ntouches f. EF is arrived at c. And by that time efkn is got to n, EFKN is\r\ngot to d and when it touches N, the pulse of the other Ray is got to o. and\r\nno farther, which is very short of the place it should have arriv’d to, to\r\nmake the Ray np to cut the _orbicular pulse_ No at right Angles: therefore\r\nthe Angle Nop is an acute Angle, but the quite contrary of this will\r\nhappen, if 17. and 18. be calculated in stead of 16. and 17. both which\r\ndoes most exactly agree with the _Phænomena_: For if the Sun, or a Candle\r\n(which is better) be placed about Ee, and the eye about Pp, the Rays EFef\r\nat 16. and 17. will paint the side of the luminous object toward np _Blue_,\r\nand towards NP _Red_. But the quite contrary will happen when EF is 17. and\r\nef 18. for then towards NP shall be a _Blue_, and towards np a _Red_,\r\nexactly according to the calculation. And there appears the _Blue_ of the\r\nRainbow, where the two _Blue_ sides of the two Images unite, and there the\r\n_Red_ where the two _Red_ sides unite, that is, where the two Images are\r\njust disappearing; which is, when the Rays EF and NP produc’d till they\r\nmeet, make an Angle of about 41. and an half; the like union is there of\r\nthe two Images in the Production of the _Secundary Iris_, and the same\r\ncauses, as upon calculation may appear; onely with this difference, that it\r\nis somewhat more faint, by reason of the duplicate reflection, which does\r\nalways weaken the impulse the oftner it is repeated.\r\n\r\nNow, though the second refraction made at Nn be convenient, that is, do\r\nmake the Rays glance the more, yet is it not altogether requisite; for it\r\nis plain from the calculation, that the pulse dn is sufficiently _oblique_\r\nto the Rays KN and kn, as wel as the pulse fc is _oblique_ to the Rays FK &\r\nfk. And therefore if a piece of very fine Paper be held close against Nn\r\nand the eye look on it either through the Ball as from D, or from the other\r\nside, as from B. there shall appear a Rainbow, or colour’d line painted on\r\nit with the part toward X appearing _Red_, towards O, _Blue_; the same also\r\nshall happen, if the Paper be placed about Kk, for towards T shall appear a\r\n_Red_, and towards V a _Blue_, which does exactly agree with this my\r\n_Hypothesis_, as upon the calculation of the progress of the pulse will\r\nmost easily appear.\r\n\r\nNor do these two observations of the colours appearing to the eye about p\r\ndiffering from what they appear on the Paper at N contradict each other;\r\nbut rather confirm and exactly agree with one another, as will be evident\r\nto him that examines the reasons set down by the ingenious. _Des Cartes_ in\r\nthe 12. _Sect._ of the 8. _Chapter of his Meteors_, where he gives the true\r\nreason why the colours appear of a quite contrary order to the eye, to what\r\nthey appear’d on the Paper if the eye be plac’d in steed of the Paper: And\r\nas in the Prisme, so also in the Water-drop, or Globe the _Phænomena_, and\r\nreason are much the same.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore shewn that there is such a propriety in the _prisme_ and\r\nwater _Globule_ whereby the pulse is made _oblique_ to the progressive, and\r\nthat so much the more, by how much greater the refraction is, I shall in\r\nthe next place consider, how this conduces to the production of colours,\r\nand what kind of impression it makes upon the bottom of the eye; and to\r\nthis end it will be requisite to examine this _Hypothesis_ a little more\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nFirst therefore, if we consider the manner of the progress of the pulse, it\r\nwill seem rational to conclude, that that part or end of the pulse which\r\nprecedes the other, must necessarily be somwhat more _obtunded_, or\r\n_impeded_ by the resistance of the transparent _medium_, than the other\r\npart or end of it which is subsequent, whose way is, as it were, prepared\r\nby the other; especially if the adjacent _medium_ be not in the same manner\r\nenlightned or agitated. And therefore (in the fourth _Figure_ of the sixth\r\n_Iconism_) the Ray AAAHB will have its side HH more deadened by the\r\nresistance of the dark or quiet _medium_ PPP, Whence there will be a kind\r\nof deadness superinduc’d on the side HHH, which will continually increase\r\nfrom B, and strike deeper and deeper into the Ray by the line BR; Whence\r\nall the parts of the triangle, RBHO will be of a dead _Blue_ colour, and so\r\nmuch the deeper, by how much the nearer they lie to the line BHH, which is\r\nmost deaded or impeded, and so much the more _dilute_, by how much the\r\nnearer it approaches the line BR. Next on the other side of the Ray AAN,\r\nthe end A of the pulse AH will be promoted, or made stronger, having its\r\npassage already prepar’d as ’twere by the other parts preceding, and so its\r\nimpression wil be stronger; And because of its _obliquity_ to the Ray,\r\nthere will be propagated a kind of faint motion into QQ the adjacent dark\r\nor quiet _medium_, which faint motion will spread further and further into\r\nQQ as the Ray is propagated further and further from A, namely, as far as\r\nthe line MA, whence all the triangle MAN will be ting’d with a _Red_, and\r\nthat _Red_ will be the deeper the nearer it approaches the line MA, and the\r\n_paler_ or _yellower_ the nearer it is the line NA. And if the Ray be\r\ncontinued, so that the lines AN and BR (which are the bounds of the _Red_\r\nand _Blue diluted_) do meet and cross each other, there will be beyond that\r\nintersection generated all kinds of _Greens_.\r\n\r\nNow, these being the proprieties of every single refracted Ray of light, it\r\nwill be easie enough to consider what must be the result of very many such\r\nRays collateral: As if we suppose infinite such Rays _interjacent_ between\r\nAKSB and ANOB, which are the terminating: For in this case the Ray AKSB\r\nwill have its _Red_ triangle intire, as lying next to the dark or quiet\r\n_medium_, but the other side of it BS will have no _Blue_, because the\r\n_medium adjacent_ to it SBO, is mov’d or enlightned, and consequently that\r\nlight does destroy the colour. So likewise will the Ray ANOB lose its\r\n_Red_, because the _adjacent medium_ is mov’d or enlightned, but the other\r\nside of the Ray that is _adjacent_ to the dark, namely, AHO will preserve\r\nits _Blue_ entire, and these Rays must be so far produc’d as till AN and BR\r\ncut each other, before there will be any _Green_ produc’d. From these\r\nProprieties well consider’d, may be deduc’d the reasons of all the\r\n_Phænomena_ of the _prisme_, and of the _Globules_ or drops of Water which\r\nconduce to the production of the Rainbow.\r\n\r\nNext for the impression they make on the _Retina_, we will further examine\r\nthis _Hypothesis_: Suppose therefore ABCDEF, in the fifth _Figure_, to\r\nrepresent the Ball of the eye: on the _Cornea_ of which ABC two Rays GACH\r\nand KCAI (which are the terminating Rays of a luminous body) falling, are\r\nby the refraction thereof collected or _converg’d_ into two points at the\r\nbottom of the eye. Now, because these terminating Rays, and all the\r\n_intermediate_ ones which come from any part of the luminous body, are\r\nsuppos’d by some sufficient refraction before they enter the eye, to have\r\ntheir pulses made _oblique_ to their progression, and consequently each Ray\r\nto have potentially _superinduc’d_ two proprieties, or colours, viz. a\r\n_Red_ on the one side, and a _Blue_ on the other, which notwithstanding are\r\nnever actually manifest, but when this or that Ray has the one or the other\r\nside of it bordering on a dark or unmov’d _medium_, therefore as soon as\r\nthese Rays are entred into the eye and so have one side of each of them\r\nbordering on a dark part of the humours of the eye, they will each of them\r\nactually exhibit some colour; therefore ADC the production of GACH will\r\nexhibit a _Blue_, because the side CD is _adjacent_ to the dark _medium_\r\nCQDC, but nothing of a _Red_, because its side AD is _adjacent_ to the\r\nenlightned _medium_ ADFA: And all the Rays that from the points of the\r\nluminous body are collected on the parts of the _Retina_ between D and F\r\nshall have their _Blue_ so much the more _diluted_ by how much the farther\r\nthese points of collection are distant from D towards F; and the Ray AFC\r\nthe production of KCAI, will exhibit a _Red_, because the side AF is\r\nadjacent to the dark or quiet _medium_ of the eye APFA, but nothing of a\r\n_Blue_, because its side CF is _adjacent_ to the enlightned _medium_ CFDC,\r\nand all the Rays from the intermediate parts of the luminous body that are\r\ncollected between F and D shall have their _Red_ so much the more diluted,\r\nby how much the farther they are distant from F towards D.\r\n\r\nNow, because by the refraction in the _Cornea_, and some other parts of the\r\neye, the sides of each Ray, which before were almost parallel, are made to\r\n_converge_ and meet in a point at the bottom of the eye, therefore that\r\nside of the _pulse_ which preceded before these refractions, shall first\r\ntouch the _Retina_, and the other side last. And therefore according as\r\nthis or that side, or end of the pulse shall be impeded, accordingly will\r\nthe _impressions_ on the _Retina_ be varied; therefore by the Ray GACH\r\nrefracted by the _Cornea_ to D there shall be on that point a stroke or\r\nimpression confus’d, whose weakest end, namely, that by the line CD shall\r\nprecede, and the stronger, namely, that by the line AD shall follow. And by\r\nthe Ray KCAI refracted to F, there shall be on that part a confus’d stroke\r\nor impression, whose strongest part, namely, that by the line CF shal\r\nprecede, and whose weakest or impeded, namely, that by the line AF shall\r\nfollow, and all the intermediate points between F and D will receive\r\nimpressions from the _converg’d_ Rays so much the more like the impressions\r\non F and D by how much the nearer they approach that or this.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of the proprieties of which impressions, we may\r\ncollect these short definitions of Colours: That _Blue is an impression on\r\nthe Retina of an oblique and confus’d pulse of light, whose weakest part\r\nprecedes, and whose strongest follows._ And, that _Red is an impression on\r\nthe Retina of an oblique and confus’d pulse of light, whose strongest part\r\nprecedes, and whose weakest follows._\r\n\r\nWhich proprieties, as they have been already manifested, in the Prisme and\r\nfalling drops of Rain, to be the causes of the colours there generated, may\r\nbe easily found to be the efficients also of the colours appearing in thin\r\n_laminated_ transparent bodies; for the explication of which, all this has\r\nbeen premised.\r\n\r\nAnd that this is so, a little closer examination of the _Phænomena_ and the\r\n_Figure_ of the body, by this _Hypothesis_ will make evident.\r\n\r\nFor first (as we have already observed) the _laminated_ body must be of a\r\ndeterminate thickness, that is, it must not be thinner then such a\r\ndeterminate quantity; for I have always observ’d, that neer the edges of\r\nthose which are exceeding thin, the colours disappear, and the part grows\r\nwhite; nor must it be thicker then another determinate quantity; for I have\r\nlikewise observ’d, that beyond such a thickness, no colours appear’d, but\r\nthe Plate looked white, between which two determinate thicknesses were all\r\nthe colour’d Rings; of which in some substances I have found ten or twelve,\r\nin others not half so many, which I suppose depends much upon the\r\ntransparency of the _laminated_ body. Thus though the consecutions are the\r\nsame in the scum or the skin on the top of metals; yet in those\r\nconsecutions in the same colour is not so often repeated as in the\r\nconsecutions in thin Glass, or in Sope-water, or any other more transparent\r\nand glutinous liquor; for in these I have observ’d, _Red, Yellow, Green,\r\nBlue, Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blue,\r\nPurple; Red, Yellow, &c._ to succeed each other, ten or twelve times, but\r\nin the other more _opacous_ bodies the consecutions will not be half so\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore secondly, the _laminated_ body must be transparent, and this\r\nI argue from this, that I have not been able to produce any colour at all\r\nwith an _opacous_ body, though never so thin. And this I have often try’d,\r\nby pressing small _Globule_ of _Mercury_ between two smooth Plates of\r\nGlass, whereby I have reduc’d that body to a much greater thinness then was\r\nrequisite to exhibit the colours with a transparent body.\r\n\r\nThirdly, there must be a considerable reflecting body adjacent to the under\r\nor further side of the _lamina_ or _plate_: for this I always found, that\r\nthe greater that reflection was, the more vivid were the appearing colours.\r\n\r\nFrom which Observations, is most evident, that the reflection from the\r\nunder or further side of the body is the principal cause of the production\r\nof these colours; which, that it is so, and how it conduces to that effect,\r\nI shall further explain in the following Figure, which is here described of\r\na very great thickness, as if it had been view’d through the _Microscope_;\r\nand ’tis indeed much thicker than any _Microscope_ (I have yet us’d) has\r\nbeen able to shew me those colour’d plates of Glass, or _Muscovie-glass_,\r\nwhich I have not without much trouble view’d with it, for though I have\r\nendeavoured to magnifie them as much as the Glasses were capable of, yet\r\nare they so exceeding thin, that I have not hitherto been able positively\r\nto determine their thickness. This Figure therefore I here represent, is\r\nwholy _Hypothetical_.\r\n\r\nLet ABCDHFE in the sixth Figure be a _frustum_ of _Muscovy-glass_, thinner\r\ntoward the end AE, and thicker towards DF. Let us first suppose the Ray\r\naghb coming from the Sun, of some remote luminous object to fall\r\n_obliquely_ on the thinner plate BAE, part therefore is reflected back by\r\ncghd, the first _Superficies_; whereby the perpendicular pulse ab is after\r\nreflexion propagated by cd, cd, equally remote from each other with ab, ab,\r\nso that ag + gc, or bh + hd are either of them equal to aa, as is also cc,\r\nbut the body BAE being transparent, a part of the light of this Ray is\r\nrefracted in the surface AB, and propagated by gikh to the surface EF,\r\nwhence it is reflected and refracted again by the surface AB. So that after\r\ntwo refractions and one reflection, there is propagated a kind of fainter\r\nRay emnf, whose pulse is not only weaker by reason of the two refractions\r\nin the surface AB, but by reason of the time spent in passing and repassing\r\nbetween the two surfaces AB and EF, ef which is this fainter or weaker\r\npulse comes behind the pulse cd; so that hereby (the surfaces AB, and EF\r\nbeing so neer together, that the eye cannot _discriminate_ them from one)\r\nthis confus’d or _duplicated_ pulse, whose strongest part precedes, and\r\nwhose weakest follows, does produce on the _Retina_, (or the _optick nerve_\r\nthat covers the bottom of the eye) the sensation of a _Yellow_.\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, this _Yellow_ will appear so much the deeper, by how much the\r\nfurther back towards the middle between cd and cd the spurious pulse ef is\r\nremov’d, as in 2 where the surface BC being further remov’d from EF, the\r\nweaker pulse ef will be nearer to the middle, and will make an impression\r\non the eye of a _Red_.\r\n\r\nBut thirdly, if the two reflecting surfaces be yet further remov’d asunder\r\n(as in 3 CD and EF are) then will the weaker pulse be so farr behind, that\r\nit will be more then half the distance between cd and cd. And in this case\r\nit will rather seem to precede the following stronger pulse, then to follow\r\nthe preceding one, and consequently a _Blue_ will be generated. And when\r\nthe weaker pulse is just in the middle between two strong ones, then is a\r\ndeep and lovely _Purple_ generated; but when the weaker pulse ef is very\r\nneer to cd, then is there generated a _Green_, which will be _bluer_, or\r\n_yellower_, according as the _approximate_ weak pulse does precede or\r\nfollow the stronger.\r\n\r\nNow fourthly, if the thicker Plate chance to be cleft into two thinner\r\nPlates, as CDFE is divided into two Plates by the surface GH then from the\r\ncomposition arising from the three reflections in the surfaces CD, GH, and\r\nEF, there will be generated several compounded or mixt colours, which will\r\nbe very differing, according as the proportion between the thicknesses of\r\nthose two divided Plates CDHG, and GHFE are varied.\r\n\r\nAnd _fifthly_, if these surfaces CD and FE are further remov’d asunder, the\r\nweaker pulse will yet lagg behind much further, and not onely be\r\n_coincident_ with the second, cd, but lagg behind that also, and that so\r\nmuch the more, by how much the thicker the Plate be; so that by degrees it\r\nwill be _coincident_ with the third cd backward also, and by degrees, as\r\nthe Plate grows thicker with a fourth, and so onward to a fifth, sixth,\r\nseventh, or eighth; so that if there be a thin transparent body, that from\r\nthe greatest thinness requisite to produce colours, does, in the manner of\r\na Wedge, by degrees grow to the greatest thickness that a Plate can be of,\r\nto exhibit a colour by the reflection of Light from such a body, there\r\nshall be generated several consecutions of colours, whose order from the\r\nthin end towards the thick, shall be _Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green;\r\nYellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green; Yellow, Red, Purple, Blue, Green;\r\nYellow_, &c. and these so often repeated, as the weaker pulse does lose\r\npaces with its _Primary_, or first pulse, and is _coincident_ with a\r\nsecond, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, &c. pulse behind the first. And this,\r\nas it is _coincident_, or follows from the first _Hypothesis_ I took of\r\ncolours, so upon experiment have I found it in multitudes of instances that\r\nseem to prove it. One thing which seems of the greatest concern in this\r\n_Hypothesis_, is to determine the greatest or least thickness requisite for\r\nthese effects, which, though I have not been wanting in attempting, yet so\r\nexceeding thin are these coloured Plates, and so imperfect our\r\n_Microscope_, that I have not been hitherto successfull, though if my\r\nendeavours shall answer my expectations, I shall hope to gratifie the\r\ncurious Reader with some things more remov’d beyond our reach hitherto.\r\n\r\nThus have I, with as much brevity as I was able, endeavoured to explicate\r\n(_Hypothetically_ at least) the causes of the _Phænomena_ I formerly\r\nrecited, on the consideration of which I have been the more particular.\r\n\r\nFirst, because I think these I have newly given are capable of explicating\r\nall the _Phænomena_ of colours, not onely of those appearing in the\r\n_Prisme_, Water-drop, or Rainbow, and in _laminated_ or plated bodies, but\r\nof all that are in the world, whether they be fluid or solid bodies,\r\nwhether in thick or thin, whether transparent, or seemingly opacous, as I\r\nshall in the next Observation further endeavour to shew. And secondly,\r\nbecause this being one of the two ornaments of all bodies discoverable by\r\nthe sight, whether looked on with, or without a _Microscope_, it seem’d to\r\ndeserve (somewhere in this Tract, which contains a description of the\r\nFigure and Colour of some minute bodies) to be somewhat the more intimately\r\nenquir’d into.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. X. _Of _Metalline_, and other real Colours._\r\n\r\nHaving in the former Discourse, from the Fundamental cause of Colour, made\r\nit probable, that there are but two Colours, and shewn, that the _Phantasm_\r\nof Colour is caus’d by the sensation of the _oblique_ or uneven pulse of\r\nLight which is capable of no more varieties than two that arise from the\r\ntwo sides of the _oblique_ pulse, though each of those be capable of\r\ninfinite gradations or degrees (each of them beginning from _White_, and\r\nending the one in the deepest _Scarlet_ or _Yellow_, the other in the\r\ndeepest _Blue_) I shall in this _Section_ set down some Observations which\r\nI have made of other colours, such as _Metalline_ powders tinging or\r\ncolour’d bodies and several kinds of tinctures or ting’d liquors, all\r\nwhich, together with those I treated of in the former Observation will, I\r\nsuppose, comprise the several subjects in which colour is observ’d to be\r\ninherent, and the several manners by which it _inheres_, or is apparent in\r\nthem. And here I shall endeavour to shew by what composition all kind of\r\ncompound colours are made, and how there is no colour in the world but may\r\nbe made from the various degrees of these two colours, together with the\r\nintermixtures of _Black_ and _White_.\r\n\r\nAnd this being so, as I shall anon shew, it seems an evident argument to\r\nme, that all colours whatsoever, whether in fluid or solid, whether in very\r\ntransparent or seemingly _opacous_, have the same efficient cause, to wit,\r\nsome kind of _refraction_ whereby the Rays that proceed from such bodies,\r\nhave their pulse _obliquated_ or confus’d in the manner I explicated in the\r\nformer _Section_; that is, a _Red_ is caus’d by a duplicated or confus’d\r\npulse, whose strongest pulse precedes, and a weaker follows: and a _Blue_\r\nis caus’d by a confus’d pulse, where the weaker pulse precedes, and the\r\nstronger follows. And according as these are, more or less, or variously\r\nmixt and compounded, so are the _sensations_, and consequently the\r\n_phantasms_ of colours _diversified_.\r\n\r\nTo proceed therefore; I suppose, that all transparent colour’d bodies,\r\nwhether fluid or solid, do consist at least of two parts, or two kinds of\r\nsubstances, the one of a substance of a somewhat differing _refraction_\r\nfrom the other. That one of these substances which may be call’d the\r\n_tinging_ substance, does consist of distinct parts, or particles of a\r\ndeterminate bigness which are _disseminated_, or dispers’d all over the\r\nother: That these particles, if the body be equally and uniformly colour’d,\r\nare evenly rang’d and dispers’d over the other contiguous body; That where\r\nthe body is deepest ting’d, there these particles are rang’d thickest, and\r\nwhere ’tis but faintly ting’d, they are rang’d much thinner, but uniformly.\r\nThat by the mixture of another body that unites with either of these, which\r\nhas a differing refraction from either of the other, quite differing\r\neffects will be produc’d, that is, the _consecutions_ of the confus’d\r\npulses will be much of another kind, and consequently produce other\r\n_sensations_ and _phantasms_ of colours, and from a _Red_ may turn to a\r\n_Blue_, or from a _Blue_ to a _Red_, &c.\r\n\r\nNow, that this may be the better understood, I shall endeavour to explain\r\nmy meaning a little more sensible by a _Scheme_: Suppose we therefore in\r\nthe seventh _Figure_ of the sixth _Scheme_, that ABCD represents a Vessel\r\nholding a ting’d liquor, let IIIII, &c. be the clear liquor, and let the\r\ntinging body that is mixt with it be EE, &c. FF, &c. GG, &c. HH, &c. whose\r\nparticles (whether round, or some other determinate Figure is little to our\r\npurpose) are first of a determinate and equal bulk. Next, they are rang’d\r\ninto the form of _Quincunx_, or _Equilaterotriangular_ order, which that\r\nprobably they are so, and why they are so, I shall elsewhere endeavour to\r\nshew. Thirdly, they are of such a nature, as does either more easily or\r\nmore difficultly transmit the Rays of light then the liquor; if more\r\neasily, a _Blue_ is generated, and if more difficultly, a _Red_ or\r\n_Scarlet_.\r\n\r\nAnd first, let us suppose the tinging particles to be of a substance that\r\ndoes more _impede_ the Rays of light, we shall find that the pulse or wave\r\nof light mov’d from AD to BC, will proceed on, through the containing\r\n_medium_ by the pulses or waves KK, LL, MM, NN, OO; but because several of\r\nthese Rays that go to the constitution of these pulses will be slugged or\r\nstopped by the tinging particles E, F, G, H; therefore there shall be\r\n_secundary_ and weak pulse that shall follow the Ray, namely PP which will\r\nbe the weaker: first, because it has suffer’d many refractions in the\r\nimpeding body; next, for that the Rays will be a little dispers’d or\r\nconfus’d by reason of the refraction in each of the particles, whether\r\n_round_ or _angular_; and this will be more evident, if we a little more\r\nclosely examine any one particular tinging _Globule_.\r\n\r\nSuppose we therefore AB in the eighth _Figure_ of the sixth _Scheme_, to\r\nrepresent a tinging _Globule_ or particle which has a greater refraction\r\nthan the liquor in which it is contain’d: Let CD be a part of the pulse of\r\nlight which is _propagated_ through the containing _medium_; this pulse\r\nwill be a little stopt or impeded by the _Globule_, and so by that time the\r\npulse is past to EF that part of it which has been impeded by passing\r\nthrough the _Globule_, will get but to LM, and so that pulse which has been\r\n_propagated_ through the _Globule_, to wit, LM, NO, PQ, will always come\r\nbehind the pulses EF, GH, IK, &c.\r\n\r\nNext, by reason of the greater impediment in AB, and its _Globular_ Figure,\r\nthe Rays that pass through it will be dispers’d, and very much scatter’d.\r\nWhence CA and DB which before went _direct_ and _parallel_, will after the\r\nrefraction in AB, _diverge_ and spread by AP, and BQ; so that as the Rays\r\ndo meet with more and more of these tinging particles in their way, by so\r\nmuch the more will the pulse of light further lagg behind the clearer\r\npulse, or that which has fewer refractions, and thence the deeper will the\r\ncolour be, and the fainter the light that is trajected through it; for not\r\nonely many Rays are reflected from the surfaces of AB, but those Rays that\r\nget through it are very much disordered.\r\n\r\nBy this _Hypothesis_ there is no one experiment of colour that I have yet\r\nmet with, but may be, I conceive, very rationably solv’d, and perhaps, had\r\nI time to examine several particulars requisite to the demonstration of it,\r\nI might prove it more than probable, for all the experiments about the\r\nchanges and mixings of colours related in the Treatise of Colours,\r\npublished by the _Incomparable_ Mr. _Boyle_, and multitudes of others which\r\nI have observ’d, do so easily and naturally flow from those principles,\r\nthat I am very apt to think it probable, that they own their production to\r\nno other _secundary_ cause: As to instance in two or three experiments. In\r\nthe twentieth Experiment, this _Noble Authour_ has shewn that the deep\r\n_bluish purple-colour_ of _Violets_, may be turn’d into a _Green_, by\r\n_Alcalizate Salts_, and to a _Red_ by acid; that is, a _Purple_ consists of\r\ntwo colours, a deep _Red_, and a deep _Blue_; when the _Blue_ is diluted,\r\nor altered, or destroy’d by _acid Salts_, the _Red_ becomes predominant,\r\nbut when the _Red_ is diluted by _Alcalizate_, and the _Blue_ heightned,\r\nthere is generated a _Green_; for of a _Red_ diluted, is made a _Yellow_,\r\nand _Yellow_ and _Blue_ make a _Green_.\r\n\r\nNow, because the _spurious_ pulses which cause a _Red_ and a _Blue_, do the\r\none follow the clear pulse, and the other precede it, it usually follows,\r\nthat those _Saline_ refracting bodies which do _dilute_ the colour of the\r\none, do deepen that of the other. And this will be made manifest by almost\r\nall kinds of _Purples_, and many sorts of _Greens_, both these colours\r\nconsisting of mixt colours; for if we suppose A and A in the ninth Figure,\r\nto represent two pulses of clear light, which follow each other at a\r\nconvenient distance, AA, each of which has a _spurious_ pulse preceding it,\r\nas BB, which makes a _Blue_, and another following it, as CC, which makes a\r\n_Red_, the one caus’d by tinging particles that have a greater refraction,\r\nthe other by others that have a less refracting quality then the liquor or\r\n_Menstruum_ in which these are dissolv’d, whatsoever liquor does so alter\r\nthe refraction of the one, without altering that of the other part of the\r\nting’d liquor, must needs very much alter the colour of the liquor; for if\r\nthe refraction of the _dissolvent_ be increas’d, and the refraction of the\r\ntinging particles not altered, then will the preceding _spurious_ pulse be\r\nshortned or stopt, and not out-run the clear pulse so much; so that BB will\r\nbecome EE, and the _Blue_ be _diluted_, whereas the other _spurious_ pulse\r\nwhich follows will be made to lagg much more, and be further behind AA than\r\nbefore, and CC will become _ff_, and so the _Yellow_ or _Red_ will be\r\nheightned.\r\n\r\nA _Saline_ liquor therefore, mixt with another ting’d liquor, may alter the\r\ncolour of it several ways, either by altering the refraction of the liquor\r\nin which the colour swims: or secondly by varying the refraction of the\r\ncoloured particles, by uniting more intimately either with some particular\r\n_corpuscles_ of the tinging body, or with all of them, according as it has\r\na _congruity_ to some more especially, or to all alike: or thirdly, by\r\nuniting and interweaving it self with some other body that is already\r\njoyn’d with the tinging particles, with which substance it may have a\r\n_congruity_, though it have very little with the particles themselves: or\r\nfourthly, it may alter the colour of a ting’d liquor by dis-joyning certain\r\nparticles which were before united with the tinging particles, which though\r\nthey were somewhat _congruous_ to these particles, have yet a greater\r\n_congruity_ with the newly _infus’d Saline menstruum_. It may likewise\r\nalter the colour by further dissolving the tinging substance into smaller\r\nand smaller _particles_, and so _diluting_ the colour; or by uniting\r\nseveral _particles_ together as in precipitations, and so deepning it, and\r\nsome such other ways, which many experiments and comparisons of differing\r\ntrials together, might easily inform one of.\r\n\r\nFrom these Principles applied, may be made out all the varieties of colours\r\nobservable, either in liquors, or any other ting’d bodies, with great ease,\r\nand I hope intelligible enough, there being nothing in the _notion_ of\r\ncolour, or in the suppos’d production, but is very conceivable, and may be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty that I find against this _Hypothesis_, is, that\r\nthere seem to be more distinct colours then two, that is, then Yellow and\r\nBlue. This Objection is grounded on this reason, that there are several\r\nReds, which _diluted_, make not a Saffron or pale Yellow, and therefore\r\nRed, or Scarlet seems to be a third colour distinct from a deep degree of\r\nYellow.\r\n\r\nTo which I answer, that Saffron affords us a deep Scarlet tincture, which\r\nmay be _diluted_ into as pale a Yellow as any, either by making a weak\r\nsolution of the Saffron, by infusing a small parcel of it into a great\r\nquantity of liquor, as in spirit of Wine, or else by looking through a very\r\nthin quantity of the tincture, and which may be heightn’d into the\r\nloveliest Scarlet, by looking through a very thick body of this tincture,\r\nor through a thinner parcel of it, which is highly _impregnated_ with the\r\ntinging body, by having had a greater quantity of the Saffron dissolv’d in\r\na smaller parcel of the liquor.\r\n\r\nNow, though there may be some particles of other tinging bodies that give a\r\nlovely Scarlet also, which though _diluted_ never so much with liquor, or\r\nlooked on through never so thin a parcel of ting’d liquor, will not yet\r\nafford a pale Yellow, but onely a kind of faint Red; yet this is no\r\nargument but that those ting’d particles may have in them the faintest\r\ndegree of Yellow, though we may be unable to make them exhibit it; For that\r\npower of being _diluted_ depending upon the divisibility of the ting’d\r\nbody, if I am unable to make the tinging particles so thin as to exhibit\r\nthat colour, it does not therefore follow, that the thing is impossible to\r\nbe done; now, the tinging particles of some bodies are of such a nature,\r\nthat unless there be found some way of comminuting them into less bulks\r\nthen the liquor does dissolve them into, all the Rays that pass through\r\nthem must necessarily receive a tincture so deep, as their appropriate\r\nrefractions and bulks compar’d with the proprieties of the dissolving\r\nliquor must necessarily dispose them to empress, which may perhaps be a\r\npretty deep Yellow, or pale Red.\r\n\r\nAnd that this is not _gratis dictum_, I shall add one instance of this\r\nkind, wherein the thing is most manifest.\r\n\r\nIf you take Blue _Smalt_, you shall find, that to afford the deepest Blue,\r\nwhich _cæteris paribus_ has the greatest particles or sands; and if you\r\nfurther divide, or grind those particles on a Grindstone, or _porphyry_\r\nstone, you may by _comminuting_ the sands of it, _dilute_ the Blue into as\r\npale a one as you please, which you cannot do by laying the colour thin;\r\nfor wheresoever any single particle is, it exhibits as deep a Blue as the\r\nwhole mass. Now, there are other Blues, which though never so much ground,\r\nwill not be _diluted_ by grinding, because consisting of very small\r\nparticles, very deeply ting’d, they cannot by grinding be actually\r\nseparated into smaller particles then the operation of the fire, or some\r\nother dissolving _menstruum_, reduc’d them to already.\r\n\r\nThus all kind of _Metalline_ colours, whether _precipitated_, _sublim’d_,\r\n_calcin’d_, or otherwise prepar’d, are hardly chang’d by grinding, as\r\n_ultra marine_ is not more _diluted_; nor is _Vermilion_ or _Red-lead_ made\r\nof a more faint colour by grinding; for the smallest particles of these\r\nwhich I have view’d with my greatest Magnifying-Glass, if they be well\r\nenlightned, appear very deeply ting’d with their peculiar colours; nor,\r\nthough I have magnified and enlightned the particles exceedingly, could I\r\nin many of them, perceive them to be transparent, or to be whole particles,\r\nbut the smallest specks that I could find among well ground _Vermilion_ and\r\n_Red-lead_, seem’d to be a Red mass, compounded of a multitude of less and\r\nless motes, which sticking together, compos’d a bulk, not one thousand\r\nthousandth part of the smallest visible sand or mote.\r\n\r\nAnd this I find generally in most _Metalline_ colours, that though they\r\nconsist of parts so exceedingly small, yet are they very deeply ting’d,\r\nthey being so ponderous, and having such a multitude of terrestrial\r\nparticles throng’d into a little room; so that ’tis difficult to find any\r\nparticle transparent or resembling a pretious stone, though not impossible;\r\nfor I have observ’d divers such shining and resplendent colours intermixt\r\nwith the particles of _Cinnaber_, both natural and artificial, before it\r\nhath been ground and broken or flaw’d into _Vermilion_: As I have also in\r\n_Orpiment_, _Red-lead_, and _Bise_, which makes me suppose, that those\r\n_metalline_ colours are by grinding, not onely broken and separated\r\nactually into smaller pieces, but that they are also flaw’d and brused,\r\nwhence they, for the most part, become _opacous_, like flaw’d Crystal or\r\nGlass, &c. But for _Smalts_ and _verditures_, I have been able with a\r\n_Microscope_ to perceive their particles very many of them transparent.\r\n\r\nNow, that the others also may be transparent, though they do not appear so\r\nto the _Microscope_, may be made probable by this Experiment: that if you\r\ntake _ammel_ that is almost _opacous_, and grind it very well on a\r\n_Porphyry_, or _Serpentine_, the small particles will by reason of their\r\nflaws, appear perfectly _opacous_; and that ’tis the flaws that produce\r\nthis _opacousness_, may be argued from this, that particles of the same\r\n_Ammel_ much thicker if unflaw’d will appear somewhat transparent even to\r\nthe eye; and from this also, that the most transparent and clear Crystal,\r\nif heated in the fire, and then suddenly quenched, so that it be all over\r\nflaw’d, will appear _opacous_ and white.\r\n\r\nAnd that the particles of _Metalline_ colours are transparent, may be\r\nargued yet further from this, that the Crystals, or _Vitriols_ of all\r\nMetals, are transparent, which since they consist of _metalline_ as well as\r\n_saline_ particles, those _metalline_ ones must be transparent, which is\r\nyet further confirm’d from this, that they have for the most part,\r\n_appropriate_ colours; so the _vitriol_ of Gold is Yellow; of Copper, Blue,\r\nand sometimes Green; of Iron, green; of Tinn and Lead, a pale White; of\r\nSilver, a pale Blue, _&._\r\n\r\nAnd next, the _Solution_ of all Metals into _menstruums_ are much the same\r\nwith the _Vitriols_, or Crystals. It seems therefore very probable, that\r\nthose colours which are made by the _precipitation_ of those particles out\r\nof the _menstruums_ by transparent _precipitating_ liquors should be\r\ntransparent also. Thus Gold _precipitates_ with _oyl of Tartar_, or _spirit\r\nof Urine_ into a brown Yellow, Copper with spirit of _Urine_ into a Mucous\r\nblue, which retains its transparency. A solution of sublimate (as the same\r\nIllustrious Authour I lately mention’d shews in his 40. Experiment)\r\n_precipitates_ with oyl of _Tartar_ _per deliquium_, into an Orange\r\ncolour’d _precipitate_; nor is it less probable, that the _calcination_ of\r\nthose _Vitriols_ by the fire, should have their particles transparent: Thus\r\n_Saccarum Saturni_, or the _Vitriol of Lead_ by _calcination_ becomes a\r\ndeep Orange-colour’d _minium_, which is a kind of _precipitation_ by some\r\nSalt which proceeds from the fire; common _Vitriol_ _calcin’d_, yields a\r\ndeep Brown Red, &c.\r\n\r\nA third Argument, that the particles of Metals are transparent, is, that\r\nbeing _calcin’d_, and melted with Glass, they tinge the Glass with\r\ntransparent colours. Thus the _Calx_ of Silver tinges the Glass on which it\r\nis anneal’d with a lovely Yellow, or Gold colour, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd that the parts of Metals are transparent, may be farther argued from\r\nthe transparency of Leaf-gold, which held against the light, both to the\r\nnaked eye, and the _Microscope_, exhibits a deep Green. And though I have\r\nnever seen the other Metals _laminated_ so thin, that I was able to\r\nperceive them transparent, yet, for Copper and Brass, if we had the same\r\nconveniency for _laminating_ them, as we have for Gold, we might, perhaps,\r\nthrough such plates or leaves, find very differing degrees of Blue, or\r\nGreen; for it seems very probable, that those Rays that rebound from them\r\nting’d, with a deep Yellow, or pale Red, as from Copper, or with a pale\r\nYellow, as from Brass, have past through them; for I cannot conceive how by\r\nreflection alone those Rays can receive a tincture, taking any _Hypothesis_\r\nextant.\r\n\r\nSo that we see there may a sufficient reason be drawn from these instances,\r\nwhy those colours which we are unable to _dilute_ to the palest Yellow, or\r\nBlue, or Green, are not therefore to be concluded not to be a deeper degree\r\nof them; for supposing we had a great company of small _Globular_ essence\r\nBottles, or round Glass bubbles, about the bigness of a Walnut, fill’d each\r\nof them with a very deep mixture of Saffron, and that every one of them did\r\nappear of a deep Scarlet colour, and all of them together did _exhibit_ at\r\na distance, a deep dy’d Scarlet body. It does not follow, because after we\r\nhave come nearer to this _congeries_, or mass, and divided it into its\r\nparts, and examining each of its parts severally or apart, we find them to\r\nhave much the same colour with the whole mats; it does not, I say,\r\ntherefore follow, that if we could break those _Globules_ smaller, or any\r\nother ways come to see a smaller or thinner parcel of the ting’d liquor\r\nthat fill’d those bubbles, that that ting’d liquor must always appear Red,\r\nor of a Scarlet hue, since if Experiment be made, the quite contrary will\r\nensue; for it is capable of being _diluted_ into the palest Yellow.\r\n\r\nNow, that I might avoid all the Objections of this kind, by exhibiting an\r\nExperiment that might by ocular proof convince those whom other reasons\r\nwould not prevail with, I provided me a _Prismatical Glass_, made hollow,\r\njust in the form of a Wedge, such as is represented in the tenth _Figure_\r\nof the sixth _Scheme_. The two _parallelogram_ sides ABCD, ABEF, which met\r\nat a point, were made of the clearest Looking-glass plates well ground and\r\npolish’d that I could get; these were joyn’d with hard cement to the\r\n_triangular_ sides, BCE, ADF, which were of Wood; the _Parallelogram_ base\r\nBCEF, likewise was of Wood joyn’d on to the rest with hard cement, and the\r\nwhole _Prismatical_ Box was exactly stopt every where, but onely a little\r\nhole near the base was left, whereby the Vessel could be fill’d with any\r\nliquor, or emptied again at pleasure.\r\n\r\nOne of these Boxes (for I had two of them) I fill’d with a pretty deep\r\ntincture of _Aloes_, drawn onely with fair Water, and then stopt the hole\r\nwith a piece of Wax, then, by holding this Wedge against the Light, and\r\nlooking through it, it was obvious enough to see the tincture of the liquor\r\nnear the edge of the Wedge where it was but very thin, to be a pale but\r\nwell colour’d Yellow, and further and further from the edge, as the liquor\r\ngrew thicker and thicker, this tincture appear’d deeper and deeper, so that\r\nnear the blunt end, which was seven Inches from the edge and three Inches\r\nand an half thick; it was of a deep and well colour’d Red. Now, the clearer\r\nand purer this tincture be, the more lovely will the deep Scarlet be, and\r\nthe fouler the tincture be, the more dirty will the Red appear; so that\r\nsome dirty tinctures have afforded their deepest Red much of the colour of\r\nburnt Oker or _Spanish_ brown; others as lovely a colour as _Vermilion_,\r\nand some much brighter; but several others, according as the tinctures were\r\nworse or more foul, exhibited various kinds of Reds, of very differing\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThe other of these Wedges, I fill’d with a most lovely tincture of Copper,\r\ndrawn from the filings of it, with spirit of _Urine_, and this Wedge held\r\nas the former against the Light, afforded all manner of Blues, from the\r\nfaintest to the deepest, so that I was in good hope by these two, to have\r\nproduc’d all the varieties of colours imaginable; for I thought by this\r\nmeans to have been able by placing the two _Parallelogram_ sides together,\r\nand the edges contrary ways, to have so mov’d them to and fro one by\r\nanother, as by looking through them in several places, and through several\r\nthicknesses, I should have compounded, and consequently have seen all those\r\ncolours, which by other like compositions of colours would have ensued.\r\n\r\nBut insteed of meeting with what I look’d for, I met with somewhat more\r\nadmirable; and that was, that I found my self utterly unable to see through\r\nthem when placed both together, though they were transparent enough when\r\nasunder; and though I could see through twice the thickness, when both of\r\nthem were fill’d with the same colour’d liquors, whether both with the\r\nYellow, or both with the Blue, yet when one was fill’d with the Yellow, the\r\nother with the Blue, and both looked through, they both appear’d dark,\r\nonely when the parts near the tops were look’d through, they exhibited\r\nGreens, and those of very great variety, as I expected, but the Purples and\r\nother colours, I could not by any means make, whether I endeavour’d to look\r\nthrough them both against the Sun, or whether I plac’d them against the\r\nhole of a darkned room.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this mis-ghessing, I proceeded on with my trial in a\r\ndark room, and having two holes near one another, I was able, by placing my\r\nWedges against them, to mix the ting’d Rays that past through them, and\r\nfell on a sheet of white Paper held at a convenient distance from them as I\r\npleas’d; so that I could make the Paper appear of what colour I would, by\r\nvarying the thicknesses of the Wedges, and consequently the tincture of the\r\nRays that past through the two holes, and sometimes also by varying the\r\nPaper, that is, insteed of a white Paper, holding a gray, or a black piece\r\nof Paper.\r\n\r\nWhence I experimentally found what I had before imagin’d, that all the\r\nvarieties of colours imaginable are produc’d from several degrees of these\r\ntwo colours, namely, Yellow and Blue, or the mixture of them with light and\r\ndarkness, that is, white and black. And all those almost infinite varieties\r\nwhich Limners and Painters are able to make by compounding those several\r\ncolours they lay on their Shels or _Palads_, are nothing else, but some\r\n_compositum_, made up of some one or more, or all of these four.\r\n\r\nNow, whereas it may here again be objected, that neither can the Reds be\r\nmade out of the Yellows, added together, or laid on in greater or less\r\nquantity, nor can the Yellows be made out of the Reds though laid never so\r\nthin; and as for the addition of White or Black, they do nothing but either\r\nwhiten or darken the colours to which they are added, and not at all make\r\nthem of any other kind of colour: as for instance, _Vermilion_, by being\r\ntemper’d with White Lead, does not at all grow more Yellow, but onely there\r\nis made a whiter kind of Red. Nor does Yellow _Oker_, though laid never so\r\nthick, produce the colour of _Vermilion_, nor though it be temper’d with\r\nBlack, does it at all make a Red; nay, though it be temper’d with White, it\r\nwill not afford a fainter kind of Yellow, such as _masticut_, but onely a\r\nwhiten’d Yellow; nor will the Blues be _diluted_ or deepned after the\r\nmanner I speak of, as _Indico_ will never afford so fine a Blue as\r\n_Ultramarine_ or _Bise_; nor will it, temper’d with _Vermilion_, ever\r\nafford a Green, though each of them be never so much temper’d with white.\r\n\r\nTo which I answer, that there is a great difference between _diluting_ a\r\ncolour and whitening of it; for _diluting_ a colour, is to make the\r\ncolour’d parts more thin, so that the ting’d light, which is made by\r\ntrajecting those ting’d bodies, does not receive so deep a tincture; but\r\nwhitening a colour is onely an intermixing of many clear reflections of\r\nlight among the same ting’d parts; deepning also, and darkning or blacking\r\na colour, are very different; for deepning a colour, is to make the light\r\npass through a greater quantity of the same tinging body; and darkning or\r\nblacking a colour, is onely interposing a multitude of dark or black spots\r\namong the same ting’d parts, or placing the colour in a more faint light.\r\n\r\nFirst therefore, as to the former of these operations, that is, diluting\r\nand deepning, most of the colours us’d by the Limners and Painters are\r\nincapable of, to wit, _Vermilion_ and _Red-lead_, and _Oker_, because the\r\nting’d parts are so exceeding small, that the most curious Grindstones we\r\nhave, are not able to separate them into parts actually divided so small as\r\nthe ting’d particles are; for looking on the most curiously ground\r\n_Vermilion_, and _Oker_, and _Red-lead_, I could perceive that even those\r\nsmall _corpuscles_ of the bodies they left were compounded of many pieces,\r\nthat is, they seem’d to be small pieces compounded of a multitude of lesser\r\nting’d parts: each piece seeming almost like a piece of Red Glass, or\r\nting’d Crystal all flaw’d; so that unless the Grindstone could actually\r\ndivide them into smaller pieces then those flaw’d particles were, which\r\ncompounded that ting’d mote I could see with my _Microscope_, it would be\r\nimpossible to _dilute_ the colour by grinding, which, because the finest we\r\nhave will not reach to do in _Vermilion_ or _Oker_, therefore they cannot\r\nat all, or very hardly be _diluted_.\r\n\r\nOther colours indeed, whose ting’d particles are such as may be made\r\nsmaller, by grinding their colour, may be _diluted_. Thus several of the\r\nBlues may be _diluted_, as _Smalt_ and _Bise_; and _Masticut_, which is\r\nYellow, may be made more faint: And even _Vermilion_ it self may, by too\r\nmuch grinding, be brought to the colour of _Red-lead_, which is but an\r\nOrange colour, which is confest by all to be very much upon the Yellow.\r\nNow, though perhaps somewhat of this _diluting_ of _Vermilion_ by overmuch\r\ngrinding may be attributed to the Grindstone, or muller, for that some of\r\ntheir parts may be worn off and mixt with the colour, yet there seems not\r\nvery much, for I have done it on a Serpentine-stone with a muller made of a\r\nPebble, and yet observ’d the same effect follow.\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, as to the other of these operations on colours, that is, the\r\ndeepning of them, Limners and Painters colours are for the most part also\r\nuncapable. For they being for the most part _opacous_; and that\r\n_opacousness_, as I said before, proceeding from the particles, being very\r\nmuch flaw’d, unless we were able to joyn and reunite those flaw’d\r\nparticles again into one piece, we shall not be able to deepen the colour,\r\nwhich since we are unable to do with most of the colours which are by\r\nPainters accounted _opacous_, we are therefore unable to deepen them by\r\nadding more of the same kind.\r\n\r\nBut because all those _opacous_ colours have two kinds of beams or Rays\r\nreflected from them, that is, Rays unting’d, which are onely reflected from\r\nthe outward surface, without at all penetrating of the body, and ting’d\r\nRays which are reflected from the inward surfaces or flaws after they have\r\nsuffer’d a two-fold refraction; and because that transparent liquors mixt\r\nwith such _corpuscles_, do, for the most part, take off the former kind of\r\nreflection; therefore these colours mixt with Water or Oyl, appear much\r\ndeeper than when dry, for most part of that white reflection from the\r\noutward surface is remov’d. Nay, some of these colours are very much\r\ndeepned by the mixture with some transparent liquor, and that because they\r\nmay perhaps get between those two flaws, and so consequently joyn two or\r\nmore of those flaw’d pieces together; but this happens but in a very few.\r\n\r\nNow, to shew that all this is not _gratis dictum_, I shall set down some\r\nExperiments which do manifest these things to be probable and likely, which\r\nI have here deliver’d.\r\n\r\nFor, first, if you take any ting’d liquor whatsoever, especially if it be\r\npretty deeply ting’d, and by any means work it into a froth, the\r\n_congeries_ of that froth shall seem an _opacous_ body, and appear of the\r\nsame colour, but much whiter than that of the liquor out of which it is\r\nmade. For the abundance of reflections of the Rays against those surfaces\r\nof the bubbles of which the froth consists, does so often rebound the Rays\r\nbackwards, that little or no light can pass through, and consequently the\r\nfroth appears _opacous_.\r\n\r\nAgain, if to any of these ting’d liquors that will endure the boiling there\r\nbe added a small quantity of fine flower (the parts of which through the\r\n_Microscope_ are plainly enough to be perceiv’d to consist of transparent\r\n_corpuscles_) and suffer’d to boyl till it thicken the liquor, the mass of\r\nthe liquor will appear _opacous_, and ting’d with the same colour, but very\r\nmuch whiten’d.\r\n\r\nThus, if you take a piece of transparent Glass that is well colour’d, and\r\nby heating it, and then quenching it in Water, you flaw it all over, it\r\nwill become _opacous_, and will exhibit the same colour with which the\r\npiece is ting’d, but fainter and whiter.\r\n\r\nOr, if you take a Pipe of this transparent Glass, and in the flame of a\r\nLamp melt it, and then blow it into very thin bubbles, then break those\r\nbubbles, and collect a good parcel of those _laminæ_ together in a Paper,\r\nyou shall find that a small thickness of those Plates will constitute an\r\n_opacous_ body, and that you may see through the mass of Glass before it be\r\nthus _laminated_, above four times the thickness: And besides, they will\r\nnow afford a colour by reflection as other _opacous_ (as they are call’d)\r\ncolours will, but much fainter and whiter than that of the Lump or Pipe out\r\nof which they were made.\r\n\r\nThus also, if you take _Putty_, and melt it with any transparent colour’d\r\nGlass, it will make it become an _opacous_ colour’d lump, and to yield a\r\npaler and whiter colour than the lump by reflection.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be done by a preparation of _Antimony_, as has been\r\nshewn by the Learned _Physician_, Dr. _C.M._ in his Excellent Observations\r\nand Notes on _Nery’s Art of Glass_; and by this means all transparent\r\ncolours become _opacous_, or _ammels_. And though by being ground they lose\r\nvery much of their colour, growing much whiter by reason of the multitude\r\nof single reflections from their outward surface, as I shew’d afore, yet\r\nthe fire that in the nealing or melting re-unites them, and so renews those\r\n_spurious_ reflections, removes also those whitenings of the colour that\r\nproceed from them.\r\n\r\nAs for the other colours which Painters use, which are transparent, and\r\nus’d to varnish over all other paintings, ’tis well enough known that the\r\nlaying on of them thinner or thicker, does very much _dilute_ or deepen\r\ntheir colour.\r\n\r\nPainters Colours therefore consisting most of them of solid particles, so\r\nsmall that they cannot be either re-united into thicker particles by any\r\nArt yet known, and consequently cannot be deepned; or divided into\r\nparticles so small as the flaw’d particles that exhibit that colour, much\r\nless into smaller, and consequently cannot be _diluted_; It is necessary\r\nthat they which are to imitate all kinds of colours, should have as many\r\ndegrees of each colour as can be procur’d.\r\n\r\nAnd to this purpose, both Limners and Painters have a very great variety\r\nboth of Yellows and Blues, besides several other colour’d bodies that\r\nexhibit very compounded colours, such as Greens and Purples; and others\r\nthat are compounded of several degrees of Yellow, or several degrees of\r\nBlue, sometimes unmixt, and sometimes compounded with several other\r\ncolour’d bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Yellows, from the palest to the deepest Red or Scarlet, which has no\r\nintermixture of Blue, are _pale and deep Masticut, Orpament, English Oker,\r\nbrown Oker, Red-Lead, and Vermilion, burnt English Oker, and burnt brown\r\nOker_, which last have a mixture of dark or dirty parts with them, &c.\r\n\r\nTheir Blues are several kinds of _Smalts_, and _Verditures_, and _Bise_,\r\nand _Ultramarine_, and _Indico_, which last has many dirty or dark parts\r\nintermixt with it.\r\n\r\nTheir compounded colour’d bodies, as _Pink_, and _Verdigrese_, which are\r\nGreens, the one a _Popingay_, the other a _Sea-green_; then _Lac_, which is\r\na very lovely _Purple_.\r\n\r\nTo which may be added their Black and White, which they also usually call\r\nColours, of each of which they have several kinds, such as _Bone Black_,\r\nmade of _Ivory_ burnt in a close Vessel, and _Blue Black_, made of the\r\nsmall coal of _Willow_, or some other Wood; and _Cullens earth_, which is a\r\nkind of brown Black, &c. Their usual Whites are either artificial or\r\nnatural _White Lead_, the last of which is the best they yet have, and with\r\nthe mixing and tempering these colours together, are they able to make an\r\nimitation of any colour whatsoever: Their Reds or deep Yellows, they can\r\n_dilute_ by mixing pale Yellows with them, and deepen their pale by mixing\r\ndeeper with them; for it is not with _Opacous_ colours as it is with\r\ntransparent, where by adding more Yellow to yellow, it is deepned, but in\r\n_opacous_ _diluted_. They can whiten any colour by mixing White with it,\r\nand darken any colour by mixing Black, or some dark and dirty colour. And\r\nin a word, most of the colours, or colour’d bodies they use in Limning and\r\nPainting, are such, as though mixt with any other of their colours, they\r\npreserve their own hue, and by being in such very smal parts dispers’d\r\nthrough the other colour’d bodies, they both, or altogether represent to\r\nthe eye a _compositum_ of all; the eye being unable, by reason of their\r\nsmalness, to distinguish the peculiarly colour’d particles, but receives\r\nthem as one intire _compositum_: whereas in many of these, the _Microscope_\r\nvery easily distinguishes each of the compounding colours distinct, and\r\nexhibiting its own colour.\r\n\r\nThus have I by gently mixing _Vermilion_ and _Bise_ dry, produc’d a very\r\nfine Purple, or mixt colour, but looking on it with the _Microscope_, I\r\ncould easily distinguish both the Red and the Blue particles, which did not\r\nat all produce the _Phantasm_ of Purple.\r\n\r\nTo summ up all therefore in a word, I have not yet found any solid colour’d\r\nbody, that I have yet examin’d, perfectly _opacous_; but those that are\r\nleast transparent are _Metalline_ and _Mineral_ bodies, whose particles\r\ngenerally, seeming either to be very small, or very much flaw’d, appear for\r\nthe most part _opacous_, though there are very few of them that I have\r\nlook’d on with a _Microscope_, that have not very plainly or\r\ncircumstantially manifested themselves transparent.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, there seem to be so few bodies in the world that are _in\r\nminimis_ opacous, that I think one may make it a rational _Query_, Whether\r\nthere be any body absolutely thus _opacous_? For I doubt not at all (and I\r\nhave taken notice of very many circumstances that make me of this mind)\r\nthat could we very much improve the _Microscope_, we might be able to see\r\nall those bodies very plainly transparent, which we now are fain onely to\r\nghess at by circumstances. Nay, the Object Glasses we yet make use of are\r\nsuch, that they make many transparent bodies to the eye, seem _opacous_\r\nthrough them, which if we widen the Aperture a little, and cast more light\r\non the objects, and not charge the Glasses so deep, will again disclose\r\ntheir transparency.\r\n\r\nNow, as for all kinds of colours that are dissolvable in Water, or other\r\nliquors, there is nothing so manifest, as that all those ting’d liquors are\r\ntransparent; and many of them are capable of being _diluted_ and compounded\r\nor mixt with other colours, and divers of them are capable of being very\r\nmuch chang’d and heightned, and fixt with several kinds of _Saline\r\nmenstruums_. Others of them upon compounding, destroy or vitiate each\r\nothers colours, and _precipitate_, or otherwise very much alter each others\r\ntincture. In the true ordering and _diluting_, and deepning, and mixing,\r\nand fixing of each of which, consists one of the greatest mysteries of the\r\nDyers; of which particulars, because our _Microscope_ affords us very\r\nlittle information, I shall add nothing more at present; but onely that\r\nwith a very few tinctures order’d and mixt after certain ways, too long to\r\nbe here set down, I have been able to make an appearance of all the various\r\ncolours imaginable, without at all using the help of _Salts_, or _Saline\r\nmenstruums_ to vary them.\r\n\r\nAs for the mutation of Colours by _Saline menstruums_, they have already\r\nbeen so fully and excellently handled by the lately mention’d Incomparable\r\n_Authour_, that I can add nothing, but that of a multitude of trials that I\r\nmade, I have found them exactly to agree with his Rules and Theories; and\r\nthough there may be infinite instances, yet may they be reduc’d under a few\r\nHeads, and compris’d within a very few Rules. And generally I find, that\r\n_Saline menstruums_ are most operative upon those colours that are Purple,\r\nor have some degree of Purple in them, and upon the other colours much\r\nless. The _spurious_ pulses that compose which, being (as I formerly noted)\r\nso very neer the middle between the true ones, that a small variation\r\nthrows them both to one side, or both to the other, and so consequently\r\nmust make a vast mutation in the formerly appearing Colour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XI. _Of _Figures_ observ’d in small Sand._\r\n\r\nSand generally seems to be nothing else but exceeding small Pebbles, or at\r\nleast some very small parcels of a bigger stone; the whiter kind seems\r\nthrough the _Microscope_ to consist of small transparent pieces of some\r\n_pellucid_ body, each of them looking much like a piece of _Alum_, or _Salt\r\nGem_; and this kind of Sand is angled for the most part irregularly,\r\nwithout any certain shape, and the _granules_ of it are for the most part\r\nflaw’d, through amongst many of them it is not difficult to find some that\r\nare perfectly _pellucid_, like a piece of clear Crystal, and divers\r\nlikewise most curiously shap’d, much after the manner of the bigger\r\n_Stiriæ_ of Crystal, or like the small Diamants I observ’d in certain\r\nFlints, of which I shall by and by relate; which last particular seems to\r\nargue, that this kind of Sand is not made by the comminution of greater\r\ntransparent Crystaline bodies, but by the _concretion_ or _coagulation_ of\r\nWater, or some other fluid body.\r\n\r\nThere are other kinds of courser Sands, which are browner, and have their\r\nparticles much bigger; these, view’d with a _Microscope_, seem much courser\r\nand more _opacous_ substances, and most of them are of some irregularly\r\nrounded Figures; and though they seem not so _opacous_ as to the naked eye,\r\nyet they seem very foul and cloudy, but neither do these want curiously\r\ntransparent, no more than they do regularly figur’d and well colour’d\r\nparticles, as I have often found.\r\n\r\nThere are multitudes of other kinds of Sands, which in many particulars,\r\nplainly enough discoverable by the _Microscope_, differ both from these\r\nlast mention’d kinds of Sands, and from one another: there seeming to be as\r\ngreat variety of Sands, as there is of Stones. And as amongst Stones some\r\nare call’d precious from their excellency, so also are there Sands which\r\ndeserve the same Epithite for their beauty; for viewing a small parcel of\r\n_East-India_ Sand (which was given me by my highly honoured friend, Mr.\r\n_Daniel Colwall_) and, since that, another parcel, much of the same kind, I\r\nfound several of them, both very transparent like precious Stones, and\r\nregularly figur’d like Crystal, _Cornish_ Diamants, some Rubies, &c. and\r\nalso ting’d with very lively and deep colours, like _Rubys_, _Saphyrs_,\r\n_Emeralds_, &c. These kinds of granules I have often found also in _English_\r\nSand. And ’tis easie to make such a counterfeit Sand with deeply ting’d\r\nGlass, Enamels and Painters colours.\r\n\r\nIt were endless to describe the multitudes of Figures I have met with in\r\nthese kind of minute bodies, such as _Spherical_, _Oval_, _Pyramidal_,\r\n_Conical_, _Prismatical_, of each of which kinds I have taken notice.\r\n\r\nBut amongst many others, I met with none more observable than this pretty\r\nShell (described in the _Figure_ X. of the fifth _Scheme_) which, though as\r\nit was light on by chance, deserv’d to have been omitted (I being unable to\r\ndirect any one to find the like) yet for its rarity was it not\r\ninconsiderable, especially upon the account of the information it may\r\nafford us. For by it we have a very good instance of the curiosity of\r\nNature in another kind of Animals which are remov’d, by reason of their\r\nminuteness, beyond the reach of our eyes, so that as there are several\r\nsorts of Insects, as Mites, and others, so small as not yet to have had any\r\nnames; (some of which I shall afterwards describe) and small Fishes, as\r\nLeeches in Vinegar; and smal vegetables, as Moss, and Rose-Leave-plants;\r\nand small Mushroms, as mould: so are there, it seems, small Shel-fish\r\nlikewise, Nature shewing her curiosity in every Tribe of _Animals_,\r\n_Vegetables_, and _Minerals_.\r\n\r\nI was trying several small and single Magnifying Glasses, and casually\r\nviewing a parcel of white Sand, when I perceiv’d one of the grains exactly\r\nshap’d and wreath’d like a Shell, but endeavouring to distinguish it with\r\nmy naked eye, it was so very small, that I was fain again to make use of\r\nthe Glass to find it; then, whilest I thus look’d on it, with a Pin I\r\nseparated all the rest of the granules of Sand, and found it afterwards to\r\nappear to the naked eye an exceeding small white spot, no bigger than the\r\npoint of a Pin. Afterwards I view’d it every way with a better _Microscope_\r\nand found it on both sides, and edge-ways, to resemble the Shell of a small\r\nWater-Snail with a flat spiral Shell: it had twelve wreathings, a, b, c, d,\r\ne, &c. all very proportionably growing one less than another toward the\r\nmiddle or center of the Shell, where there was a very small round white\r\nspot. I could not certainly discover whether the Shell were hollow or not,\r\nbut it seem’d fill’d with somewhat, and ’tis probable that it might be\r\n_petrify’d_ as other larger Shels often are, such as are mention’d in the\r\nseventeenth _Observation_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XII. _Of _Gravel_ in Urine._\r\n\r\nI Have often observ’d the Sand or Gravel of Urine, which seems to be a\r\n_tartareous_ substance, generated out of a _saline_ and a _terrestrial_\r\nsubstance _crystalliz’d_ together, in the form of _Tartar_, sometimes\r\nsticking to the sides of the _Urinal_, but for the most part sinking to the\r\nbottom, and there lying in the form of coorse common Sand; these, through\r\nthe _Microscope_, appear to be a company of small bodies, partly\r\ntransparent and partly _opacous_, some White, some Yellow, some Red, others\r\nof more brown and duskie colours.\r\n\r\nThe Figure of them is for the most part flat, in the manner of Slats or\r\nsuch like plated Stones, that is, each of them seem to be made up of\r\nseveral other thinner Plates, much like _Muscovie Glass_, or _English Sparr_\r\nto the last of which, the white plated Gravel seems most likely; for they\r\nseem not onely plated like that, but their sides shap’d also into _Rhombs_,\r\n_Rhomboeids_, and sometimes into _Rectangles_ and _Squares_. Their bigness\r\nand Figure may be seen in the second _Figure_ of the seventh _Plate_, which\r\nrepresents about a dozen of them lying upon a plate ABCD, some of which, as\r\na, b, c, d seem’d more regular than the rest, and e, which was a small one,\r\nsticking on the top of another, was a perfect _Rhomboeid_ on the top, and\r\nhad four _Rectangular_ sides.\r\n\r\nThe line E which was the measure of the _Microscope_, is ¹⁄₃₂ part of\r\nan _English_ Inch, so that the greatest bredth of any of them, exceeded not\r\n¹⁄₁₂₈ part of an Inch.\r\n\r\nPutting these into several liquors, I found _oyl of Vitriol_, _Spirit of\r\nUrine_, and several other _Saline menstruums_ to dissolve them; and the\r\nfirst of these in less than a minute without _Ebullition_, Water, and\r\nseveral other liquors, had no sudden operation upon them. This I mention,\r\nbecause those liquors that dissolve them, first make them very white, not\r\n_vitiating_, but rather rectifying their Figure, and thereby make them\r\nafford a very pretty object for the _Microscope_.\r\n\r\nHow great an advantage it would be to such as are troubled with the Stone,\r\nto find some _menstruum_ might dissolve them without hurting the Bladder,\r\nis easily imagin’d, since some _injections_ made of such bodies might\r\nlikewise dissolve the stone, which seems much of the same nature.\r\n\r\nIt may therefore, perhaps, be worthy some Physicians enquiry, whether there\r\nmay not be something mixt with the Urine in which the Gravel or Stone lies,\r\nwhich may again make it dissolve it, the first of which seems by it’s\r\nregular Figures to have been sometimes _Crystalliz’d_ out of it. For\r\nwhether this _Crystallization_ be made in the manner as _Alum_, _Peter_,\r\n&c. are _crystallized_ out of a cooling liquor, in which, by boyling they\r\nhave been dissolv’d; or whether it be made in the manner of _Tartarum\r\nVitriolatum_, that is, by the _Coalition_ of an _acid_ and a _Sulphureous_\r\nsubstance, it seems not impossible, but that the liquor it lies in, may be\r\nagain made a _dissolvent_ of it. But leaving these inquiries to Physicians\r\nor Chymists, to whom it does more properly belong, I shall proceed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XIII. _Of the small _Diamants_, or _Sparks_ in _Flints_._\r\n\r\nChancing to break a Flint stone in pieces, I found within it a certain\r\ncavity all crusted over with a very pretty candied substance, some of the\r\nparts of which, upon changing the posture of the Stone, in respect of the\r\n_Incident_ light, exhibited a number of small, but very vivid reflections;\r\nand having made use of my _Microscope_, I could perceive the whole surface\r\nof that cavity to be all beset with a multitude of little _Crystaline_ or\r\n_Adamantine_ bodies, so curiously shap’d, that it afforded a not unpleasing\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nHaving considered those vivid _repercussions_ of light, I found them to be\r\nmade partly from the plain external surface of these regularly figured\r\nbodies (which afforded the vivid reflections) and partly to be made from\r\nwithin the somewhat _pellucid_ body, that is, from some surface of the\r\nbody, opposite to that superficies of it which was next the eye.\r\n\r\nAnd because these bodies were so small, that I could not well come to make\r\nExperiments and Examinations of them, I provided me several small _stiriæ_\r\nof Crystals or Diamants, found in great quantities in _Cornwall_ and are\r\ntherefore commonly called _Cornish Diamants_: these being very _pellucid_,\r\nand growing in a hollow cavity of a Rock (as I have been several times\r\ninformed by those that have observ’d them) much after the same manner as\r\nthese do in the Flint, and having besides their outward surface very\r\nregularly shap’d, retaining very near the same Figures with some of those I\r\nobserv’d in the other, became a convenient help to me for the Examination\r\nof the proprieties of those kinds of bodies.\r\n\r\nAnd first for the Reflections, in these I found it very observable, That\r\nthe brightest reflections of light proceeded from within the _pellucid_\r\nbody; that is, that the Rays admitted through the _pellucid_ substance in\r\ntheir getting out on the opposite side, were by the contiguous and strong\r\nreflecting surface of the Air very vividly reflected, so that more Rays\r\nwere reflected to the eye by this surface, though the Ray in entring and\r\ngetting out of the Crystal had suffer’d a double refraction, than there\r\nwere from the outward surface of the Glass where the Ray had suffer’d no\r\nrefraction at all.\r\n\r\nAnd that this was the surface of the Air that gave so vivid a\r\n_re-percussion_ I try’d by this means I sunk half of a _stiria_ in Water,\r\nso that only Water was contiguous to the under surface, and then the\r\ninternal reflection was so exceedingly faint, that it was scarce\r\ndiscernable. Again, I try’d to alter this vivid reflection by keeping off\r\nthe Air, with a body not fluid, and that was by rubbing and holding my\r\nfinger very hard against the under surface, so as in many places the pulp\r\nof my finger did touch the Glass, without any _interjacent_ air between,\r\nthen observing the reflection, I found, that wheresoever my finger or skin\r\ntoucht the surface, from that part there was no reflection, but in the\r\nlittle furrows or creases of my skin, where there remain’d little small\r\nlines of air, from them was return’d a very vivid reflection as before. I\r\ntry’d further, by making the surface of very pure Quicksilver to be\r\ncontiguous to the under surface of this _pellucid_ body, and then the\r\nreflection from that was so exceedingly more vivid than from the air, as\r\nthe reflection from air was than the reflection from the Water; from all\r\nwhich trials I plainly saw, that the strong reflecting air was the cause of\r\nthis _Phænomenon_.\r\n\r\nAnd this agrees very well with the _Hypothesis_ of light and _Pellucid_\r\nbodies which I have mention’d in the description of _Muscovy-glass_; for we\r\nthere suppose Glass to be a _medium_, which does less resist the pulse of\r\nlight, and consequently, that most of the Rays incident on it enter into\r\nit, and are refracted towards the _perpendicular_; whereas the air I\r\nsuppose to be a body that does more resist it, and consequently more are\r\n_re-percuss’d_ then do enter it: the same kind of trials have I made, with\r\n_Crystalline Glass_, with drops of fluid bodies, and several other ways,\r\nwhich do all seem to agree very exactly with this _Theory_. So that from\r\nthis Principle well establish’d, we may deduce severall Corollaries not\r\nunworthy observation.\r\n\r\nAnd the first is; that it plainly appears by this, that the production of\r\nthe Rainbow is as much to be ascribed to the reflection of the concave\r\nsurface of the air, as to the refraction of the _Globular_ drops: this will\r\nbe evidently manifest by these Experiments, if you _foliate_ that part of a\r\nGlass-ball that is to reflect an _Iris_, as in the _Cartesian_ Experiment,\r\nabove mention’d, the reflections will be abundantly more strong, and the\r\ncolours more vivid: and if that part of the surface be touch’d with Water,\r\nscarce affords any sensible colour at all.\r\n\r\nNext we learn, that the great reason why _pellucid_ bodies beaten small are\r\nwhite, is from the multitude of reflections, not from the particles of the\r\nbody, but from the _contiguous_ surface of the air. And this is evidently\r\nmanifested, by filling the _Interstitia_ of those powder’d bodies with\r\nWater, whereby their whiteness presently disappears. From the same reason\r\nproceeds the whiteness of many kinds of Sands, which in the _Microscope_\r\nappear to be made up of a multitude of little _pellucid_ bodies, whose\r\nbrightest reflections may by the _Microscope_ be plainly perceiv’d to come\r\nfrom their internal surfaces; and much of the whiteness of it may be\r\ndestroy’d by the affusion of fair Water to be contiguous to those surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe whiteness also of froth, is for the most part to be ascribed to the\r\nreflection of the light from the surface of the air within the Bubbles, and\r\nvery little to the reflection from the surface of the Water it self: for\r\nthis last reflection does not return a quarter so many Rays, as that which\r\nis made from the surface of the air, as I have certainly found by a\r\nmultitude of Observations and Experiments.\r\n\r\nThe whiteness of _Linnen_, _Paper_, _Silk_, &c. proceeds much from the same\r\nreason, as the _Microscope_ will easily discover; for the Paper is made up\r\nof an abundance of _pellucid_ bodies, which afford a very plentifull\r\nreflection from within, that is, from the concave surface of the air\r\ncontiguous to its component particles; wherefore by the affusion of Water,\r\nOyl, Tallow, Turpentine, &c. all those reflections are made more faint, and\r\nthe beams of light are suffer’d to traject & run through the Paper more\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nHence further we may learn the reason of the whiteness of many bodies, and\r\nby what means they may be in part made _pellucid_: As white Marble for\r\ninstance, for this body is composed of a _pellucid_ body exceedingly\r\nflaw’d, that is, there are abundance of thin, and very fine cracks or\r\nchinks amongst the multitude of particles of the body, that contain in them\r\nsmall parcels of air, which do so _re-percuss_ and drive back the\r\npenetrating beams, that they cannot enter very deep within that body; which\r\nthe _Microscope_ does plainly inform us to be made up of a _Congeries_ of\r\n_pellucid_ particles. And I further found it somewhat more evidently by\r\nsome attempts I made towards the making transparent Marble, for by heating\r\nthe Stone a little, and soaking it in Oyl, Turpentine, Oyl of Turpentine,\r\n&c., I found that I was able to see much deeper into the body of Marble\r\nthan before; and one trial, which was not with an unctuous substance,\r\nsucceeded better than the rest, of which, when I have a better opportunity,\r\nI shall make further trial.\r\n\r\nThis also gives us a probable reason of the so much admired _Phænomena_, of\r\nthe _Oculus Mundi_, an _Oval_ stone, which commonly looks like white\r\nAlabaster, but being laid a certain time in Water, it grows _pellucid_, and\r\ntransparent, and being suffer’d to lie again dry, it by degrees loses that\r\ntransparency, and becomes white as before. For the Stone being of a hollow\r\nspongie nature, has in the first and last of these appearances, all those\r\npores fill’d with the obtunding and reflecting air; whereas in the second,\r\nall those pores are fill’d with a _medium_ that has much the same\r\nrefraction with the particles of the Stone, and therefore those two being\r\n_contiguous_, make, as ’twere, one _continued medium_, of which more is\r\nsaid in the 15. _Observation_.\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of other _Phænomena_, that are produc’d from this\r\nsame Principle, which as it has not been taken notice of by any yet that I\r\nknow, so I think, upon more diligent observation, will it not be found the\r\nleast considerable. But I have here onely time to hint _Hypotheses_, and\r\nnot to prosecute them so fully as I could wish; many of them having a vast\r\nextent in the production of a multitude of _Phænomena_, which have been by\r\nothers, either not attempted to be explain’d, or else attributed to some\r\nother cause than what I have assign’d, and perhaps than the right; and\r\ntherefore I shall leave this to the prosecution of such as have more\r\nleisure: onely before I leave it, I must not pretermit to hint, that by\r\nthis Principle, multitudes of the _Phænomena_ of the air, as about _Mists_,\r\n_Clouds_, _Meteors_, _Haloes_, &c. are most plainly and (perhaps) truly\r\nexplicable; multitudes also of the _Phænomena_ in colour’d bodies, as\r\nliquors, &c. are deducible from it.\r\n\r\nAnd from this I shall proceed to a second considerable _Phænomenon_ which\r\nthese Diamants exhibit, and that is the regularity of their _Figure_, which\r\nis a propriety not less general than the former, It comprising within its\r\nextent, all kinds of _Metals_, all kinds of _Minerals_, most _Precious\r\nstones_, all kinds of _Salts_, multitudes of _Earths_, and almost all kinds\r\nof _fluid bodies_. And this is another propiety, which, though a little\r\nsuperficially taken notice of by some, has not, that I know, been so much\r\nas attempted to be explicated by any.\r\n\r\nThis propriety of bodies, as I think it the most worthy, and next in order\r\nto be consider’d after the contemplation of the _Globular Figure_, so have\r\nI long had a desire as wel as a determination to have prosecuted it if I\r\nhad had an opportunity, having long since propos’d to my self the method of\r\nmy enquiry therein, it containing all the allurements that I think any\r\nenquiry is capable of: For, first I take it to proceed from the most simple\r\nprinciple that any kind of form can come from, next the _Globular_, which\r\nwas therefore the first I set upon, and what I have therein perform’d, I\r\nleave the Judicious Reader to determine. For as that form proceeded from a\r\npropiety of fluid bodies, which I have call’d _Congruity_, or\r\n_Incongruity_; so I think, had I time and opportunity, I could make\r\nprobable, that all these regular Figures that are so conspicuously\r\n_various_ and _curious_, and do so adorn and beautifie such multitudes of\r\nbodies, as I have above hinted, arise onely from three or four several\r\npositions or postures of _Globular_ particles, and those the most plain,\r\nobvious, and necessary conjunctions of such figur’d particles that are\r\npossible, so that supposing such and such plain and obvious causes\r\nconcurring the _coagulating particles_ must necessarily compose a body of\r\nsuch a determinate regular Figure, and no other, and this with as much\r\nnecessity and obviousness as a fluid body encompast with a _Heterogeneous_\r\nfluid must be protruded into a _Spherule_ or _Globe_. And this I have _ad\r\noculum_ demonstrated with a company of bullets, and some few other very\r\nsimple bodies; so that there was not any regular Figure, which I have\r\nhitherto met withall, of any of those bodies that I have above named, that\r\nI could not with the composition of bullets or globules, and one or two\r\nother bodies, imitate, even almost by shaking them together. And thus for\r\ninstance may we find that the _Globular_ bullets will of themselves, if put\r\non an inclining plain, so that they may run together, naturally run into a\r\n_triangular_ order, composing all the variety of figures that can be\r\nimagin’d to be made out of _æquilateral triangles_; and such will you find,\r\nupon trial, all the Surfaces of _Alum_ to be compos’d of: For three bullets\r\nlying on a plain, as close to one another as they can compose an\r\n_æquilatero-triangular_ form, as in A in the 7. _Scheme_. If a fourth be\r\njoyn’d to them on either side as closely as it can, they four compose the\r\nmost regular Rhombus consisting of two _æquilateral triangles_, as B. If a\r\nfifth be joyn’d to them on either side in as close a position as it can,\r\nwhich is the propriety of the _Texture_, it makes a _Trapezium_, or\r\nfour-sided Figure, two of whose angles are 120. and two 60. degrees, as C.\r\nIf a sixth be added, as before, either it makes an _æquilateral triangle_,\r\nas D, or a Rhomboeid, as E, or an _Hexangular Figure_, as F, which is\r\ncompos’d of two _primary Rhombs_. If a seventh be added, it makes either\r\nan _æquilatero-hexagonal_ Figure, as G, or some kind of six-sided _Figure_,\r\nas H, or I. And though there be never so many placed together, they may be\r\nrang’d into some of these lately mentioned Figures, all the angles of which\r\nwill be either _60_. degrees, or 120. as the figure K. which is an\r\n_æquiangular hexagonal_ Figure is compounded of 12. _Globules_, or may be\r\nof 25, or 27, or 36, or 42, &c. and by these kinds of texture, or position\r\nof globular bodies, may you find out all the variety of regular shapes,\r\ninto which the smooth surfaces of _Alum_ are form’d, as upon examination\r\nany one may easily find; nor does it hold only in superficies, but in\r\nsolidity also, for it’s obvious that a fourth _Globule_ laid upon the third\r\nin this texture, composes a regular _Tetrahedron_, which is a very usual\r\nFigure of the _Crystals_ of _Alum_. And (to hasten) there is no one Figure\r\ninto which _Alum_ is observ’d to be crystallized, but may by this texture\r\nof _Globules_ be imitated, and by no other.\r\n\r\nI could instance also in the Figure of _Sea-salt_, and _Sal-gem_, that it\r\nis compos’d of a texture of _Globules_, placed in a _cubical_ form, as L,\r\nand that all the Figures of those Salts may be imitated by this texture of\r\n_Globules_ and by no other whatsoever. And that the forms of _Vitriol_ and\r\nof _Salt-Peter_, as also of _Crystal_, _Hore-frost_, &c. are compounded of\r\nthese two textures, but modulated by certain proprieties: But I have not\r\nhere time to insist upon, as I have not neither to shew by what means\r\n_Globules_ come to be thus context, and what those _Globules_ are, and many\r\nother particulars requisite to a full and intelligible explication of this\r\npropriety of bodies. Nor have I hitherto found indeed an opportunity of\r\nprosecuting the inquiry so farr as I design’d; nor do I know when I may, it\r\nrequiring abundance of time, and a great deal of assistance to go through\r\nwith what I design’d; the model of which was this:\r\n\r\nFirst, to get as exact and full a collection as I could, of all the\r\ndiffering kinds of Geometrical figur’d bodies, some three or four several\r\nbodies of each kind.\r\n\r\nSecondly, with them to get as exact a History as possibly I could learn of\r\ntheir places of Generation or finding, and to enquire after as many\r\ncircumstances that tended to the Illustrating of this Enquiry, as possibly\r\nI could observe.\r\n\r\nThirdly, to make as many trials as upon experience I could find requisite,\r\nin Dissolutions and Coagulations of several crystallizing Salts; for the\r\nneedfull instruction and information in this Enquiry.\r\n\r\nFourthly, to make several trials on divers other bodies, as Metals,\r\nMinerals, and Stones, by dissolving them in several _Menstruums_, and\r\ncrystalizing them, to see what Figures would arise from those several\r\n_Compositums_.\r\n\r\nFifthly, to make Compositions and Coagulations of several Salts together\r\ninto the same mass, to observe of what Figure the product of them would be;\r\nand in all, to note as many circumstances as I should judge conducive to my\r\nEnquiry.\r\n\r\nSixthly, to enquire the closeness or rarity of the texture of these bodies,\r\nby examining their gravity, and their refraction, &c.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, to enquire particularly what operations the fire has upon\r\nseveral kinds of Salts, what changes it causes in their Figures, Textures,\r\nor Energies.\r\n\r\nEighthly, to examine their manner of dissolution, or acting upon those\r\nbodies dissoluble in them; The texture of those bodies before and after the\r\nprocess. And this for the History.\r\n\r\nNext for the Solution, To have examin’d by what, and how many means, such\r\nand such Figures, actions and effects could be produc’d possibly.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, from all circumstances well weigh’d, I should have endeavoured\r\nto have shewn which of them was most likely, and (if the informations by\r\nthese Enquiries would have born it) to have demonstrated which of them it\r\nmust be, and was.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed, As I believe it next to the Globular the most simple; so do\r\nI, in the second place, judge it not less pleasant; for that which makes an\r\nEnquiry pleasant, are, first a noble _Inventum_ that promises to crown the\r\nsuccessfull endeavour; and such must certainly the knowledge of the\r\nefficient and concurrent causes of all these curious Geometrical Figures\r\nbe, which has made the Philosophers hitherto to conclude nature in these\r\nthings to play the Geometrician, according to that saying of _Plato_,\r\nὉ Θεὸς γεομετρεῖ. Or next, a great variety of matter in the\r\nEnquiry; and here we meet with nothing less than the _Mathematicks_ of\r\nnature, having every day a new Figure to contemplate, or a variation of the\r\nsame in another body,\r\n\r\nWhich do afford us a third thing, which will yet more sweeten the Enquiry,\r\nand that is, a multitude of information; we are not so much to grope in the\r\ndark, as in most other Enquiries, where the _Inventum_ is great; for having\r\nsuch a multitude of instances to compare, and such easie ways of\r\ngenerating, or compounding and of destroying the form, as in the _Solution_\r\nand _Crystallization_ of Salts, we cannot but learn plentifull information\r\nto proceed by. And this will further appear from the universality of the\r\nPrinciple which Nature has made use of almost in all inanimate bodies. And\r\ntherefore, as the contemplation of them all conduces to the knowledg of any\r\none; so from a Scientifical knowledge of any one does follow the fame of\r\nall, and every one.\r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, for the usefulness of this knowledge, when acquir’d;\r\ncertainly none can doubt, that considers that it caries us a step forward\r\ninto the Labyrinth of Nature, in the right way towards the end we propose\r\nour selves in all Philosophical Enquiries. So that knowing what is the form\r\nof Inanimate or Mineral bodies, we shall be the better able to proceed in\r\nour next Enquiry after the forms of Vegetative bodies; and last of all, of\r\nAnimate ones, that seeming to be the highest step of natural knowledge that\r\nthe mind of man is capable of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XIV. _Of several kindes of frozen _Figures_._\r\n\r\nI have very often in a Morning, when there has been a great _hoar-frost_,\r\nwith an indifferently magnifying _Microscope_, observ’d the small _Stiriæ_,\r\nor Crystalline beard, which then usually covers the face of most bodies\r\nthat lie open to the cold air, and found them to be generally _Hexangular\r\nprismatical_ bodies, much like the long Crystals of _Salt-peter_, save\r\nonely that the ends of them were differing: for whereas those of _Nitre_\r\nare for the most part _pyramidal_, being terminated either in a point or\r\nedge; these of Frost were hollow, and the cavity in some seem’d pretty\r\ndeep, and this cavity was the more plainly to be seen, because usually one\r\nor other of the six _parallelogram_ sides was wanting, or at least much\r\nshorter then the rest.\r\n\r\nBut this was onely the Figure of the _Bearded hoar-frost_; and as for the\r\nparticles of other kinds of _hoar-frosts_, they seem’d for the most part\r\nirregular, or of no certain Figure. Nay, the parts of those curious\r\nbranchings, or _vortices_, that usually in cold weather tarnish the surface\r\nof Glass, appear through the _Microscope_ very rude and unshapen, as do\r\nmost other kinds of frozen _Figures_, which to the naked eye seem exceeding\r\nneat and curious, such as the Figures of _Snow_, frozen _Urine_, _Hail_,\r\nseveral _Figures_ frozen in common Water, &c. Some Observations of each of\r\nwhich I shall hereunto annex, because if well consider’d and examin’d, they\r\nmay, perhaps, prove very instructive for the finding out of what I have\r\nendeavoured in the preceding Observation to shew, to be (next the _Globular\r\nFigure_ which is caus’d by _congruity_, as I hope I have made probable in\r\nthe sixth _Observation_) the most simple and plain operation of Nature, of\r\nwhich, notwithstanding we are yet ignorant.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Several Observables in the _six-branched_ Figures form’d on the surface of\r\nUrine by freezing._\r\n\r\n1 [11]The Figures were all frozen almost even with the surface of the\r\n_Urine_ in the Vessel; but the bigger stems were a little _prominent_ above\r\nthat surface, and the parts of those stems which were nearest the center\r\n(a) were biggest above the surface.\r\n\r\n2 I have observ’d several kinds of these Figures, some smaller, no bigger\r\nthen a Two-pence, others so bigg, that I have by measure found one of its\r\nstems or branches above four foot long; and of these, some were pretty\r\nround, having all their branches pretty neer alike; other of them were more\r\nextended towards one side, as usually those very large ones were, which I\r\nhave observ’d in Ditches which have been full of foul water.\r\n\r\n3 None of all these Figures I have yet taken notice of, had any regular\r\nposition in respect of one another, or of the sides of the Vessel; nor did\r\nI find any of them equally to exactness extended every way from the center\r\na.\r\n\r\n4 Where ever there was a center, the branchings from it, ab, ac, ad, ae,\r\naf, ag, were never fewer, or more then six, which usually concurr’d, or met\r\none another very neer in the same point or center, a; though oftentimes not\r\nexactly; and were enclin’d to each other by an angle, of very near sixty\r\ndegrees, I say, very neer, because, though having endeavoured to measure\r\nthem the most accurately I was able, with the largest Compasses I had, I\r\ncould not find any sensible variation from that measure, yet the whole\r\nsix-branched Figure seeming to compose a solid angle, they must necessarily\r\nbe somewhat less.\r\n\r\n5 The middle lines or stems of these branches, ab, ac, ad, ae, af, ag,\r\nseem’d somewhat whiter, and a little higher then any of the _intermediate_\r\nbranchings of these Figures; and the center a, was the most _prominent_\r\npart of the whole Figure, seeming the _apex_ of a solid angle or _pyramid_,\r\neach of the six plains being a little enclin’d below the surface of the\r\n_Urin_.\r\n\r\n6 The lateral branchings issuing out of the great ones, such as op, mq, &c.\r\nwere each of them inclin’d to the great ones, by the same angle of about\r\nsixty degrees, as the great ones were one to another, and always the bigger\r\nbranchings were _prominent_ above the less, and the less above the least,\r\nby proportionate _gradations_.\r\n\r\n7 The _lateral_ branches shooting out of the great ones, went all of them\r\nfrom the center, and each of them was parallel to that great branch, next\r\nto which it lay; so that as all the branches on one side were parallel to\r\none another, so were they all of them to the _approximate_ great branch, as\r\npo, qr, as they were parallel to each other, and shot from the center, so\r\nwere they parallel also to the great branch ab.\r\n\r\n8 Some of the stems of the six branches proceeded straight, and of a\r\nthickness that gradually grew sharper towards the end, as ag.\r\n\r\n9 Others of the stems of those branches grew bigger and knotty towards the\r\nmiddle, and the branches also as well as stems, from Cylinders grew into\r\nPlates, in a most admirable and curious order, so exceeding regular and\r\ndelicate, as nothing could be more, as is visible in ab, ac, ad, ae, af,\r\nbut towards the end of some of these stems, they began again to grow\r\nsmaller and to recover their former branchings, as about k and n.\r\n\r\n10 Many of the _lateral_ branches had _collateral_ branches (if I may so\r\ncall them) as qm had many such as st, and most of those again\r\n_subcollateral_, as vw, and these again had others less, which one may call\r\n_laterosubcollateral_, and these again others, and they others, &c. in\r\ngreater Figures.\r\n\r\n11 The branchings of the main Stems joyn’d not together by any regular\r\nline, nor did one side of the one lie over the other side of the other, but\r\nthe small _collateral_ and _subcollateral_ branches did lie at top of one\r\nanother according to a certain order or method, which I always observ’d to\r\nbe this.\r\n\r\n12 That side of a _collateral_ or _subcollateral_, &c. branch, lay over the\r\nside of the _approximate_ (as the feathers in the wing of a Bird) whose\r\nbranchings proceeded parallel to the last biggest stem from which it\r\nsprung, and not to the biggest stem of all, unless that were a second stem\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\n13 This rule that held in the branchings of the _Sexangular Figure_ held\r\nalso in the branchings of any other great or small stem, though it did not\r\nproceed from a center.\r\n\r\n14 The exactness and curiosity of the figuration of these branches, was in\r\nevery particular so transcendent, that I judge it almost impossible for\r\nhumane art to imitate.\r\n\r\n15 Tasting several cleer pieces of this _Ice_, I could not find any\r\n_Urinous_ taste in them, but those few I tasted, seem’d as _insipid_ as\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n16 A figuration somewhat like this, though indeed in some particulars much\r\nmore curious, I have several times observ’d in _regulus martis stellatus_,\r\nbut with this difference, that all the stems and branchings are bended in a\r\nmost excellent and regular order, whereas in _Ice_ the stems and branchings\r\nare streight, but in all other particulars it agrees with this, and seems\r\nindeed nothing but one of these stars, or branched Figures frozen on\r\n_Urine_, distorted, or wreathed a little, with a certain proportion: _Lead_\r\nalso that has _Arsenick_ and some other things mixt with it, I have found\r\nto have its surface, when suffer’d to cool, figured somewhat like the\r\nbranchings of _Urine_, but much smaller.\r\n\r\n17 But there is a _Vegetable_ which does exceedingly imitate these\r\nbranches, and that is, _Fearn_, where the main stem may be observ’d to\r\nshoot out branches, and the stems of each of these _lateral_ branches, to\r\nsend forth _collateral_, and those _subcollateral_ and those\r\n_laterosubcollateral_, &c. and all those much after the same order with the\r\nbranchings, divisions, and subdivisions in the branchings of these Figures\r\nin frozen _Urine_; so that if the Figures of both be well consider’d, one\r\nwould ghess that there were not much greater need of a _seminal principle_\r\nfor the production of _Fearn_, then for the production of the branches of\r\n_Urine_, or the _Stella martis_, there seeming to be as much form and\r\nbeauty in the one as in the other.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, this Plant of _Fearn_, if all particulars be well consider’d,\r\nwill seem of as simple, and uncompounded a form as any _Vegetable_, next to\r\n_Mould_ or _Mushromes_, and would next after the invention of the forms of\r\nthose, deserve to be enquir’d into; for notwithstanding several have\r\naffirm’d it to have seed, and to be propagated thereby; yet, though I have\r\nmade very diligent enquiry after that particular, I cannot find that there\r\nis any part of it that can be imagin’d to be more seminal then another: But\r\nthis onely here by the by:\r\n\r\nFor the freezing Figures in _Urine_, I found it requisite,\r\n\r\nFirst, that the Superficies be not disturbed with any wind, or other\r\ncommotion of the air, or the like.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that it be not too long exposed, so as that the whole bulk be\r\nfrozen, for oftentimes, in such cases, by reason of the swelling the of\r\n_Ice_, or from some other cause, the curious branched Figures disappear.\r\n\r\nThirdly, an artificial freezing with _Snow_ and _Salt_, apply’d to the\r\noutside of the containing Vessel, succeeds not well, unless there be a very\r\nlittle quantity in the Vessel.\r\n\r\nFourthly, If you take any cleer and smooth Glass, and wetting all the\r\ninside of it with _Urine_, you expose it to a very sharp freezing, you will\r\nfind it cover’d with a very regular and curious Figure.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Observables in figur’d _Snow_._\r\n\r\nExposing a piece of black Cloth, or a black Hatt to the falling _Snow_, I\r\nhave often with great pleasure, observ’d such an infinite variety of\r\ncuriously figur’d _Snow_, that it would be as impossible to draw the Figure\r\nand shape of every one of them, as to imitate exactly the curious and\r\nGeometrical _Mechanisme_ of Nature in any one. Some coorse draughts, such\r\nas the coldness of the weather, and the ill provisions, I had by me for\r\nsuch a purpose, would permit me to make, I have here added in the Second\r\n_Figure_ of the Eighth _Scheme_.[12]\r\n\r\nIn all which I observ’d, that if they were of any regular Figures, they\r\nwere always branched out with six principal branches, all of equal length,\r\nshape and make, from the center, being each of them inclin’d to either of\r\nthe next branches on either side of it, by an angle of sixty degrees.\r\n\r\nNow, as all these stems were for the most part in one flake exactly of the\r\nsame make, so were they in differing Figures of very differing ones; so\r\nthat in a very little time I have observ’d above an hundred several cizes\r\nand shapes of these starry flakes.\r\n\r\nThe branches also out of each stem of any one of these flakes, were exactly\r\nalike in the same flake; so that of whatever Figure one of the branches\r\nwere, the other five were sure to be of the same, very exactly, that is, if\r\nthe branchings of the one were small _Perallelipipeds_ or Plates, the\r\nbranchings of the other five were of the same; and generally, the\r\nbranchings were very conformable to the rules and method observ’d before,\r\nin the Figures on _Urine_, that is, the branchings from each side of the\r\nstems were parallel to the next stem on that side, and if the stems were\r\nplated, the branches also were the same; if the stems were very long, the\r\nbranches also were so, &c.\r\n\r\nObserving some of these figur’d flakes with a _Microscope_, I found them\r\nnot to appear so curious and exactly figur’d as one would have imagin’d,\r\nbut like Artificial Figures, the bigger they were magnify’d, the more\r\nirregularities appear’d in them; but this irregularity seem’d ascribable to\r\nthe thawing and breaking of the flake by the fall, and not at all to the\r\ndefect of the _plastick_ virtue of Nature, whose curiosity in the formation\r\nof most of these kind of regular Figures, such as those of _Salt_,\r\n_Minerals_, &c. appears by the help of the _Microscope_, to be very many\r\ndegrees smaller then the most acute eye is able to perceive without it. And\r\nthough one of these six-branched Stars appear’d here below much of the\r\nshape described in the Third _Figure_ of the Eighth _Scheme_; yet I am very\r\napt to think, that could we have a sight of one of them through a\r\n_Microscope_ as they are generated in the Clouds before their Figures are\r\nvitiated by external accidents, they would exhibit abundance of curiosity\r\nand neatness there also, though never so much magnify’d: For since I have\r\nobserv’d the Figures of _Salts_ and _Minerals_ to be some of them so\r\nexceeding small, that I have scarcely been able to perceive them with the\r\n_Microscope_, and yet have they been regular, and since (as far as I have\r\nyet examin’d it) there seems to be but one and the same cause that produces\r\nboth these effects, I think it not irrational to suppose that these pretty\r\nfigur’d Stars of _Snow_, when at first generated might be also very regular\r\nand exact.\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n_Several kinds of Figures in _Water_ frozen._\r\n\r\nPutting fair Water into a large capacious Vessel of _Glass_, and exposing\r\nit to the cold, I observ’d after a little time, several broad, flat, and\r\nthin _laminæ_, or plates of _Ice_, crossing the bulk of the water and one\r\nanother very irregularly, onely most of them seem’d to turn one of their\r\nedges towards that side of the Glass which was next it, and seem’d to grow,\r\nas ’twere from the inside of the Vessel inwards towards the middle, almost\r\nlike so many blades of _Fern_. Having taken several of these plates out of\r\nwater on the blade of a Knife, I observ’d them figur’d much after the\r\nmanner of _Herring bones_, or _Fern blades_, that is, there was one bigger\r\nstem in the middle like the back-bone, and out of it, on either side, were\r\na multitude of small _stiriæ_, or _icicles_, like the smaller bones, or the\r\nsmaller branches in _Fern_, each of these branches on the one side, were\r\nparallel to all the rest on the same side, and all of them seem’d to make\r\nan angle with the stem, towards the top, of sixty degrees, and towards the\r\nbottom or root of this stem, of 120. See the fourth _Figure_ of the 8.\r\n_Plate_.\r\n\r\nI observ’d likewise several very pretty Varieties of Figures in Water,\r\nfrozen on the top of a broad flat Marble-stone, expos’d to the cold with a\r\nlittle Water on it, some like feathers, some of other shapes, many of them\r\nwere very much of the shape exprest in the fifth Figure of the 8. _Scheme_,\r\nwhich is extremely differing from any of the other Figures.\r\n\r\nI observ’d likewise, that the shootings of _Ice_ on the top of Water,\r\nbeginning to freeze, were in streight _prismatical_ bodies much like those\r\nof _roch-peter_, that they crost each other usually without any kind of\r\norder or rule, that they were always a little higher then the surface of\r\nthe Water that lay between them; that by degrees those _interjacent_ spaces\r\nwould be fill’d with _Ice_ also, which usually would be as high as the\r\nsurface of the rest.\r\n\r\nIn flakes of _Ice_ that had been frozen on the top of Water to any\r\nconsiderable thickness, I observ’d that both the upper and the under sides\r\nof it were curiously quill’d, furrow’d, or grain’d, as it were, which when\r\nthe Sun shone on the Plate, was exceeding easily to be perceiv’d to be much\r\nafter the shape of the lines in the 6. _Figure_ of the 8. _Scheme_, that\r\nis, they consisted of several streight ends of parallel Plates, which were\r\nof divers lengths and angles to one another without any certain order.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all which regular Figures (and of hundreds of others, namely\r\nof _Salts_, _Minerals_, _Metals_, &c. which I could have here inserted,\r\nwould it not have been too long) seems to be deducible from the same\r\nPrinciples, which I have (in the 13. _Observation_) hinted only, having not\r\nyet had time to compleat a _Theory_ of them. But indeed (which I there also\r\nhinted) I judge it the second step by which the _Pyramid_ of natural\r\nknowledge (which is the knowledge of the form of bodies) is to be ascended:\r\nAnd whosoever will climb it, must be well furnish’d with that which the\r\nNoble _Verulam_ calls _Scalam Intellectus_; he must have scaling Ladders,\r\notherwise the steps are so large and high, there will be no getting up\r\nthem, and consequently little hopes of attaining any higher station, such\r\nas to the knowledge of the most simple principle of Vegetation manifested\r\nin Mould and Mushromes, which, as I elsewhere endeavoured to shew, seems to\r\nbe the third step; for it seems to me, that the Intellect of man is like\r\nhis body, destitute of wings, and cannot move from a lower to a higher and\r\nmore sublime station of knowledg, otherwise then step by step, nay even\r\nthere where the way is prepar’d and already made passible; as in the\r\n_Elements of Geometry_, or the like, where it is fain to climb a whole\r\n_series_ of Propositions by degrees, before it attains the knowledge of one\r\n_Probleme_. But if the ascent be high, difficult and above its reach, it\r\nmust have recourse to a _novum organum_, some new engine and contrivance,\r\nsome new kind of _Algebra_, or _Analytick Art_ before it can surmount it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XV. _Of _Kettering-stone_, and of the pores of _Inanimate_ bodies._\r\n\r\n[13]This Stone which is brought from _Kettering_ in _Northampton-Shire_,\r\nand digg’d out of a Quarry, as I am inform’d, has a grain altogether\r\nadmirable, nor have I ever seen or heard of any other stone that has the\r\nlike. It is made up of an innumerable company of small bodies, not all of\r\nthe same cize or shape, but for the most part, not much differing from a\r\nGlobular form, nor exceed they one another in Diameter above three or four\r\ntimes; they appear to the eye, like the Cobb or Ovary of a _Herring_, or\r\nsome smaller fishes, but for the most part, the particles seem somewhat\r\nless, and not so uniform; but their variation from a perfect globular ball,\r\nseems to be only by the pressure of the _contiguous_ bals which have a\r\nlittle deprest and protruded those toucht sides inward, and forc’d the\r\nother sides as much outwards beyond the limits of a Globe; just as it would\r\nhappen, if a heap of exactly round Balls of soft Clay were heaped upon one\r\nanother; or, as I have often seen a heap of small Globules of\r\n_Quicksilver_, reduc’d to that form by rubbing it much in a glaz’d Vessel,\r\nwith some slimy or sluggish liquor, such as Spittle, when though the top of\r\nthe upper Globules be very neer spherical, yet those that are prest upon by\r\nothers, exactly imitate the forms of these lately mention’d grains.\r\n\r\nWhere these grains touch each other, they are so firmly united or settled\r\ntogether, that they seldom part without breaking a hole in one or th’other\r\nof them, such as a, a, a, b, c, c, &c. Some of which fractions, as a, a, a,\r\na, where the touch has been but light, break no more then the outward\r\ncrust, or first shell of the stone, which is of a white colour, a little\r\ndash’d with a brownish Yellow, and is very thin, like the shell of an Egg:\r\nand I have seen some of those grains perfectly resemble some kind of Eggs,\r\nboth in colour and shape: But where the union of the _contiguous granules_\r\nhas been more firm, there the divulsion has made a greater Chasm, as at b,\r\nb, b, in so much that I have observ’d some of them quite broken in two, as\r\nat c, c, c, which has discovered to me a further resemblance they have to\r\nEggs, they having an appearance of a white and yelk, by two differing\r\nsubstances that envelope and encompass each other.\r\n\r\nThat which we may call the white was pretty whitish neer the yelk, but more\r\nduskie towards the shell; some of them I could plainly perceive to be shot\r\nor radiated like a _Pyrites_ or _fire-stone_; the yelk in some I saw\r\nhollow, in others fill’d with a duskie brown and porous substance like a\r\nkind of pith.\r\n\r\nThe small pores, or _interstitia_ eeee betwixt the Globules, I plainly saw,\r\nand found by other trials to be every way pervious to air and water, for I\r\ncould blow through a piece of this stone of a considerable thickness, as\r\neasily as I have blown through a Cane, which minded me of the pores which\r\n_Des Cartes_ allow his _materia subtilis_ between the _æthereal_ globules.\r\n\r\nThe object, through the _Microscope_, appears like a _Congeries_ or heap of\r\nPibbles, such as I have often seen cast up on the shore, by the working of\r\nthe Sea after a great storm, or like (in shape, though not colour) a\r\ncompany of small Globules of Quicksilver, look’d on with a _Microscope_,\r\nwhen reduc’d into that form by the way lately mentioned. And perhaps, this\r\nlast may give some hint at the manner of the formation of the former: For\r\nsupposing some _Lapidescent_ substance to be generated, or some way brought\r\n(either by some commixture of bodies in the Sea it self, or protruded in,\r\nperhaps, out of some _subterraneous_ caverns) to the bottom of the Sea, and\r\nthere remaining in the form of a liquor like Quicksilver, _heterogeneous_\r\nto the ambient _Saline_ fluid, it may by the working and tumblings of the\r\nSea to and fro be jumbled and comminuted into such Globules as may\r\nafterwards be hardned into Flints, the lying of which one upon another,\r\nwhen in the Sea, being not very hard, by reason of the weight of the\r\nincompassing fluid, may cause the undermost to be a little, though not\r\nmuch, varied from a globular Figure. But this only by the by.\r\n\r\nAfter what manner this _Kettering-stone_ should be generated I cannot\r\nlearn, having never been there to view the place, and observe the\r\ncircumstances; but it seems to me from the structure of it to be generated\r\nfrom some substance once more fluid, and afterwards by degrees growing\r\nharder, almost after the same manner as I supposed the generation of Flints\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\nBut whatever were the cause of its curious texture, we may learn this\r\ninformation from it; that even in those things which we account vile, rude,\r\nand coorse, Nature has not been wanting to shew abundance of curiosity and\r\nexcellent Mechanisme.\r\n\r\nWe may here find a Stone by help of a _Microscope_, to be made up of\r\nabundance of small Balls, which do but just touch each other, and yet there\r\nbeing so many contacts, they make a firm hard mass, or a Stone much harder\r\nthen Free-stone.\r\n\r\nNext, though we can by a _Microscope_ discern so curious a shape in the\r\nparticles, yet to the naked eye there scarce appears any such thing; which\r\nmay afford us a good argument to think, that even in those bodies also,\r\nwhose _texture_ we are not able to discern, though help’d with\r\n_Microscopes_, there may be yet _latent_ so curious a _Schematisme_, that\r\nit may abundantly satisfie the curious searcher, who shall be so happy as\r\nto find some way to discover it.\r\n\r\nNext, we here find a Stone, though to the naked eye a very close one, yet\r\nevery way perforated with innumerable pores, which are nothing else but the\r\n_interstitia_, between those multitudes of minute globular particles, that\r\ncompose the bulk it self, and these pores are not only discover’d by the\r\n_Microscope_, but by this contrivance.\r\n\r\nI took a pretty large piece of this stone, and covering it all over with\r\ncement, save only at two opposite parts, I found my self able, by blowing\r\nin at one end that was left open, to blow my spittle, with which I had wet\r\nthe other end, into abundance of bubbles, which argued these pores to be\r\nopen and pervious through the whole stone, which affords us a very pretty\r\ninstance of the porousness of some seemingly close bodies, of which kind I\r\nshall anon have occasion to subjoyn many more, tending to prove the same\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nI must not here omit to take notice, that in this body there is not a\r\n_vegetative_ faculty that should so contrive this structure for any\r\npeculiar use of _Vegetation_ or growth, whereas in the other instances of\r\nvegetable porous bodies, there is an _anima_ or _forma informans_, that\r\ndoes contrive all the Structures and _Mechanisms_ of the constituting\r\nbody, to make them subservient and usefull to the great Work or Function\r\nthey are to perform. And so I ghess the pores in Wood, and other\r\nvegetables, in bones, and other Animal substances, to be as so many\r\nchannels, provided by the Great and Alwise Creator, for the conveyance of\r\nappropriated juyces to particular parts. And therefore, that this may tend,\r\nor be pervious all towards one part, and may have impediments, as valves or\r\nthe like, to any other; but in this body we have very little reason so\r\nsuspect there should be any such design, for it is equally pervious every\r\nway, not onely forward, but backwards, and side-ways, and seems indeed much\r\nrather to be _Homogeneous_ or similar to those pores, which we may with\r\ngreat probability believe to be the channels of _pellucid_ bodies, not\r\ndirected, or more open any one way, then any other, being equally pervious\r\nevery way. And, according as these pores are more or greater in respect of\r\nthe _interstitial_ bodies, the more transparent are the so constituted\r\nconcretes; and the smaller those pores are, the weaker is the _Impulse_ of\r\nlight communicated through them, though the more quick be the progress.\r\n\r\nUpon this Occasion, I hope it will not be altogether unseasonable, if I\r\npropound my conjectures and _Hypothesis_ about the _medium_ and conveyance\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nI suppose then, that the greatest part of the _Interstitia_ of the world,\r\nthat lies between the bodies of the Sun and Starrs, and the Planets, and\r\nthe Earth, to be an exceeding fluid body, very apt and ready to be mov’d,\r\nand to communicate the motion of any one part to any other part, though\r\nnever so far distant: Nor do I much concern my self, to determine what the\r\nFigure of the particles of this exceedingly subtile fluid _medium_ must be,\r\nnor whether it have any interstitiated pores or vacuities, it being\r\nsufficient to solve all the _Phænomena_ to suppose it an exceedingly fluid,\r\nor the most fluid body in the world, and as yet impossible to determine the\r\nother difficulties.\r\n\r\nThat being so exceeding fluid a body, it easily gives passage to all other\r\nbodies to move to and fro in it.\r\n\r\nThat it neither receives from any of its parts, or from other bodies; nor\r\ncommunicates to any of its parts, or to any other body, any impulse, or\r\nmotion in a direct line, that is not of a determinate quickness. And that\r\nwhen the motion is of such determinate swiftness, it both receives, and\r\ncommunicates, or propagates an impulse or motion to any imaginable distance\r\nin streight lines, with an unimaginable celerity and vigour.\r\n\r\nThat all kind of solid bodies consist of pretty massie particles in respect\r\nof the particles of this fluid _medium_, which in many places do so touch\r\neach other, that none of this fluid _medium_ interposes much after the same\r\nmanner (to use a gross similitude) as a heap of great stones compose one\r\ngreat _congeries_ or mass in the midst of the water.\r\n\r\nThat all fluid bodies which we may call _tangible_, are nothing but some\r\nmore subtile parts of those particles, that serve to constitute all\r\n_tangible_ bodies.\r\n\r\nThat the water, and such other fluid bodies, are nothing but a _congeries_\r\nof particles agitated or made fluid by it in the same manner as the\r\nparticles of _Salt_ are agitated or made fluid by a parcel of water, in\r\nwhich they are dissolv’d, and subsiding to the bottom of it, constitute a\r\nfluid body, much more massie and dense, and less fluid then the pure water\r\nit self.\r\n\r\nThat the air on the other side is a certain company of particles of quite\r\nanother kind, that is, such as are very much smaller, and more easily\r\nmoveable by the motion of this fluid _medium_; much like those very subtile\r\nparts of _Cochenel_, other very deep tinging bodies, where by a very small\r\nparcel of matter is able to tinge and diffuse it self over a very great\r\nquantity of the fluid dissolvent; or somewhat after that manner, as smoak,\r\nand such like minute bodies, or steams, are observ’d to tinge a very great\r\nquantity of air; onely this last similitude is deficient in one propriety,\r\nand that is a perpetuity or continuance in that state of commixture with\r\nthe air, but the former does more nearly approach to the nature and manner\r\nof the air’s being dissolv’d by this fluid or _Æther_. And this Similitude\r\nwill further hold in these proprieties; that as those tinctures may be\r\nincreased by certain bodies, so may they be precipitated by others, as I\r\nshall afterwards shew it to be very probable, that the like accidents\r\nhappen even to the Air it self.\r\n\r\nFurther, as these solutions and tinctures do alter the nature of these\r\nfluid bodies, as to their aptness to propagate a motion or impulse through\r\nthem, even so does the particles of the Air, Water, and other fluid bodies,\r\nand of Glass, Crystal, &c. which are commixt with this bulk of the _Æther_\r\nalter the motion of the propagated pulse of light; that is, where these\r\nmore bulkie particles are more plentifull, and consequently a lesser\r\nquantity of the _Æther_ between them to be mov’d, there the motion must\r\nnecessarily be the swifter, though not so robust, which will produce those\r\neffects, which I have (I hope) with some probability, ascribed to it in the\r\ndigression about Colours, at the end of the _Observations_ on\r\n_Muscovy-glass._\r\n\r\nNow, that other Stones, and those which have the closest and hardest\r\ntextures, and seem (as far as we are able to discover with our eyes, though\r\nhelp’d with the best _Microscopes_) freest from pores, are yet\r\nnotwithstanding replenish’d with them, an Instance or two will, I suppose,\r\nmake more probable.\r\n\r\nA very solid and unflaw’d piece of cleer white _Marble_, if it be well\r\npolish’d and glaz’d, has so curiously smooth a surface, that the best and\r\nmost polish’d surface of any wrought-glass, seems not to the naked eye, nor\r\nthrough a _Microscope_, to be more smooth, and less porous. And yet, that\r\nthis hard close body is replenish’d with abundance of pores, I think these\r\nfollowing Experiments will sufficiently prove.\r\n\r\nThe first is, That if you take such a piece, and for a pretty while boyl it\r\nin Turpentine and Oyl of Turpentine, you shall find that the stone will be\r\nall imbu’d with it; and whereas before it look’d more white, but more\r\nopacous, now it will look more greasie, but be much more transparent, and\r\nif you let it lie but a little while, and then break off a part of it, you\r\nshall find the unctuous body to have penetrated it to such a determinate\r\ndepth every way within the surface. This may be yet easier try’d with a\r\npiece of the same _Marble_, a little warm’d in the fire, and then a little\r\nPitch or Tarr melted on the top of it; for these black bodies, by their\r\ninsinuating themselves into the invisible pores of the stone, ting it with\r\nso black a hue, that there can be no further doubt of the truth of this\r\nassertion, that it abounds with small imperceptible pores.\r\n\r\nNow, that other bodies will also sink into the pores of _Marble_, besides\r\nunctuous, I have try’d, and found, that a very Blue tincture made in\r\n_spirit of Urine_ would very readily and easily sink into it, as would also\r\nseveral tinctures drawn with _spirit of Wine_.\r\n\r\nNor is _Marble_ the only seemingly close stone, which by other kinds of\r\nExperiments may be found porous; for I have by this kind of Experiment on\r\ndivers other stones found much the same effect, and in some, indeed much\r\nmore notable. Other stones I have found so porous, that with the\r\n_Microscope_ I could perceive several small winding holes, much like\r\nWorm-holes, as I have noted in some kind of _Purbeck-stone_, by looking on\r\nthe surface of a piece newly flaw’d off, for if otherwise, the surface has\r\nbeen long expos’d to the Air, or has been scraped with any tool, those\r\nsmall caverns are fill’d with dust, and disappear.\r\n\r\nAnd to confirm this _Conjecture_, yet further, I shall here insert an\r\nexcellent account, given into the _Royal Society_ by that Eminently Learned\r\nPhysician, Doctor _Goddard_, of an Experiment, not less instructive then\r\ncurious and accurate, made by himself on a very hard and seemingly close\r\nstone call’d _Oculus Mundi_, as I find it preserv’d in the Records of that\r\nHonourable Society.\r\n\r\n    A small stone of the kind, call’d by some Authours, _Oculus Mundi_,\r\n    being dry and cloudy, weigh’d 5²⁰⁹⁄₂₅₆ _Grains_.\r\n\r\n    The same put under water for a night, and somewhat more, became\r\n    transparent, and the superficies being wiped dry, weighed 6³⁄₂₅₆\r\n    _Grains_.\r\n\r\n    The difference between these two weights, 0⁵⁰⁄₂₅₆ of a _Grain_.\r\n\r\n    The same Stone kept out of water one Day and becoming cloudy again\r\n    weighed, 5²²⁵⁄₂₅₆ _Graines_.\r\n\r\n    Which was more then the first weight, 0¹⁶⁄₂₅₆ of a _Grain_.\r\n\r\n    The same being kept two Days longer weighed, 5²⁰²⁄₂₅₆ _Graines_.\r\n\r\n    Which was less then at first, 0⁷⁄₂₅₆ a _Grain_.\r\n\r\n    Being kept dry something longer it did not grow sensibly lighter.\r\n\r\n    Being put under water for a night and becoming again transparent and\r\n    wiped dry, the weight was, _6³⁄₂₅₆ Grains_, the same with the first\r\n    after putting in water, and more then the last weight after keeping of\r\n    it dry, 0⁵⁷⁄₂₅₆ of a _Grain_.\r\n\r\n    Another Stone of the same kind being variegated with milky _white_ and\r\n    _gray_ like some sorts of _Agates_, while it lay under water, was\r\n    alwaies invironed with little Bubbles, such as appear in water a little\r\n    before boyling, next the sides of the Vessel.\r\n\r\n    There were also some the like Bubbles on the Surface of the water just\r\n    over it, as if either some exhalations came out of it, or that it did\r\n    excite some fermentation in the parts of the water contiguous to it.\r\n\r\n    There was little sensible difference in the transparency of this Stone,\r\n    before the putting under water, and after: To be sure the milky-_white_\r\n    parts continued as before, but more difference in weight then in the\r\n    former. For whereas before the putting into the water the weight was\r\n    18⁹⁷⁄₁₂₈ _Graines_. After it had lyen in about four and twenty hours\r\n    the weight was 20²⁷⁄₁₂₈ _Graines_, so the difference was, 1⁵⁸⁄₁₂₈\r\n    _Graines_.\r\n\r\n    The same Stone was infused in the water scalding hot, and so continued\r\n    for a while after it was cold, but got no more weight then upon\r\n    infusing in the cold, neither was there any sensible Difference in the\r\n    weight both times.\r\n\r\nIn which Experiment, there are three Observables that seem very manifestly\r\nto prove the porousness of these seemingly close bodies: the first is their\r\nacquiring a transparency, and losing their whiteness after steeping in\r\nwater, which will seem the more strongly to argue it, if what I have\r\nalready said about the making transparent, or clarifying of some bodies, as\r\nthe white powder of beaten Glass, and the froth of some glutinous\r\ntransparent liquor be well consider’d; for thereby it will seem rational to\r\nthink that this transparency arises from the insinuation of the water\r\n(which has much the same refraction with such stony particles, as may be\r\ndiscover’d by Sand view’d with a _Microscope_) into those pores which were\r\nformerly repleat with air (that has a very differing refraction, and\r\nconsequently is very reflective) which seems to be confirm’d by the second\r\nObservable, namely, the increase of weight after keeping, and decrease upon\r\ndrying. And thirdly, seem’d yet more sensibly confirm’d by the multitude of\r\nbubbles in the last Experiment.\r\n\r\nWe find also most Acid Salts very readily to dissolve and separate the\r\nparts of this body one from another; which is yet a further Argument to\r\nconfirm the porousness of bodies, and will serve as such, to shew that even\r\nGlass also has an abundance of pores in it, since there are several\r\nliquors, that with long staying in a Glass, will so _Corrode_ and eat into\r\nit, as at last, to make it pervious to the liquor it contain’d, of which I\r\nhave seen very many Instances.\r\n\r\nSince therefore we find by other proofs, that many of those bodies which we\r\nthink the most solid ones, and appear so to our sight, have notwithstanding\r\nabundance of those grosser kind of pores, which will admit several kinds of\r\nliquors into them, why should we not believe that Glass, and all other\r\ntransparent bodies abound with them, since we have many other arguments,\r\nbesides the propagation of light, which seem to argue for it?\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it may be objected, that the propagation of light is no\r\nargument that there are those atomical pores in glass, since there are\r\n_Hypotheses_ plausible enough to solve those _Phænomena_, by supposing the\r\npulse onely to be communicated through the transparent body.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, that that _Hypothesis_ which the industrious _Mersennus_\r\nhas publish’d about the slower motion of the end of a Ray in a denser\r\n_medium_, then in a more rare and thin, seems altogether unsufficient to\r\nsolve abundance of _Phænomena_, of which this is not the least\r\nconsiderable, that it is impossible from that supposition, that any colours\r\nshould be generated from the refraction of the Rays; for since by that\r\n_Hypothesis_ the _undulating pulse_ is always carried perpendicular, or at\r\nright angles with the Ray or Line of direction, it follows, that the stroke\r\nof the pulse of light, after it has been once or twice refracted (through a\r\nPrisme, for example) must affect the eye with the same kind of stroke as if\r\nit had not been refracted at all. Nor will it be enough for a Defendant of\r\nthat _Hypothesis_, to say, that perhaps it is because the refractions have\r\nmade the Rays more weak, for if so, then two refractions in the two\r\nparallel sides of a _Quadrangular Prisme_ would produce colours, but we\r\nhave no such _Phænomena_ produc’d.\r\n\r\nThere are several Arguments that I could bring to evince that there are in\r\nall transparent bodies such atomical pores. And that there is such a fluid\r\nbody as I am arguing for, which is the _medium_, or Instrument, by which\r\nthe pulse of Light is convey’d from the _lucid body_ to the enlightn’d. But\r\nthat it being a digression from the Observations I was recording, about the\r\nPores of _Kettering-Stone_, it would be too much such, if I should protract\r\nit too long; and therefore I shall proceed to the next _Observation_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XVI. _Of _Charcoal_, or burnt _Vegetables_._\r\n\r\nCharcoal, or a Vegetable burnt black, affords an object no less pleasant\r\nthan instructive, for if you take a small round Charcoal, and break it\r\nshort with your fingers, you may perceive it to break with a very smooth\r\nand sleek surface, almost like the surface of black sealing Wax; this\r\nsurface, if it be look’d on with an ordinary _Microscope_, does manifest\r\nabundance of those pores which are also visible to the eye in many kinds of\r\n_Wood_, rang’d round the pith, both a in kind of circular order, and a\r\nradiant one. Of these there are a multitude in the substance of the Coal,\r\nevery where almost perforating and drilling it from end to end; by means of\r\nwhich, be the Coal never so long, you may easily blow through it; and this\r\nyou may presently find, by wetting one end of it with Spittle, and blowing\r\nat the other.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all, for besides those many great and conspicuous irregular\r\nspots or pores, if a better _Microscope_ be made use of, there will appear\r\nan infinite company of exceedingly small, and very regular pores, so thick\r\nand so orderly set, and so close to one another, that they leave very\r\nlittle room or space between them to be fill’d with a solid body, for the\r\napparent _interstitia_ or separating sides of these pores seem so thin in\r\nsome places, that the texture of a Honey-comb cannot be more porous. Though\r\nthis be not every where so, the intercurrent partitions in some places\r\nbeing very much thicker in proportion to the holes.\r\n\r\nMost of these small pores seem’d to be pretty round, and were rang’d in\r\nrows that radiated from the pith to the bark; they all of them seem’d to be\r\ncontinued open pores, running the whole length of the Stick; and that they\r\nwere all perforated, I try’d by breaking off a very thin sliver of the Coal\r\ncross-ways, and then with my _Microscope_, diligently surveying them\r\nagainst the light, for by that means I was able to see quite through them.\r\n\r\nThese pores were so exceeding small and thick, that in a line of them, ¹⁄₁₈\r\npart of an Inch long, I found by numbering them no less then 150. small\r\npores; and therefore in a line of them an Inch long, must be no less then\r\n2700. pores, and in a circular _area_ of an Inch diameter, must be about\r\n5725350. of the like pores; so that a Stick of an Inch Diameter, may\r\ncontain no less then seven hundred and twenty five thousand, besides 5\r\nMillions of pores, which would, I doubt not, seem even incredible, were not\r\nevery one left to believe his own eyes. Nay, having since examin’d _Cocus,\r\nblack and green Ebony, Lignum Vitæ_, &c. I found, that all these Woods have\r\ntheir pores, abundantly smaller then those of soft light Wood; in so much,\r\nthat those of _Guajacum_ seem’d not above an eighth part of the bigness of\r\nthe pores of Beech, but then the _Interstitia_ were thicker; so\r\nprodigiously curious are the contrivances, pipes, or sluces by which the\r\n_Succus nutritius_, or Juyce of a Vegetable is convey’d from place to\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThis _Observation_ seems to afford us the true reason of several\r\n_Phænomena_ of Coals; as\r\n\r\nFirst, why they look black; and for this we need go no further then the\r\n_Scheme_, for certainly, a body that has so many pores in it as this is\r\ndiscover’d to have, from each of which no light is reflected, must\r\nnecessarily look black, especially, when the pores are somewhat bigger in\r\nproportion to the intervals then they are cut in the _Scheme_, black being\r\nnothing else but a privation of Light, or a want of reflection; and\r\nwheresoever this reflecting quality is deficient, there does that part look\r\nblack, whether it be from a porousness of the body, as in this Instance, or\r\nin a deadning and dulling quality, such as I have observ’d in the _Scoria_\r\nof Lead, Tin, Silver, Copper, &c.\r\n\r\nNext, we may also as plainly see the reason of its shining quality, and\r\nthat is from the even breaking off of the stick, the solid _interstitia_\r\nhaving a regular termination or surface, and having a pretty strong\r\nreflecting quality, the many small reflections become united to the naked\r\neye, and make a very pretty shining surface.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the reason of its hardness and brittleness seems evident, for\r\nsince all the watery or liquid substance that moistn’d and toughn’d those\r\n_Interstitia_ of the more solid parts, are evaporated and remov’d, that\r\nwhich is left behind becomes of the nature almost of a stone, which will\r\nnot at all, or very little, bend without a _divulsion_ or _solution_ of its\r\n_continuity_.\r\n\r\nIt is not my design at present, to examine the use and _Mechanisme_ of\r\nthese parts of Wood, that being more proper to another Enquiry; but rather\r\nto hint, that from this Experiment we may learn,\r\n\r\nFirst, what is the cause of the blackness of many burnt bodies, which we\r\nmay find to be nothing else but this; that the heat of the fire agitating\r\nand rarifying the waterish, transparent, and volatile water that is\r\ncontain’d in them, by the continuation of that action, does so totally\r\nexpel and drive away all that which before fill’d the pores, and was\r\ndispers’d also through the solid mass of it, and thereby caus’d an\r\nuniversal kind of transparency, that it not onely leaves all the pores\r\nempty, but all the _Interstitia_ also so dry and _opacous_, and perhaps\r\nalso yet further perforated, that that light onely is reflected back which\r\nfalls upon the very outward edges of the pores, all they that enter into\r\nthe pores of the body, never returning, but being lost in it.\r\n\r\nNow, that the Charring or coaling of a body is nothing else, may be easily\r\nbeliev’d by one that shall consider the means of its production, which may\r\nbe done after this, or any such manner. The body to be charr’d or coal’d,\r\nmay be put into a _Crucible_, Pot, or any other Vessel that will endure to\r\nbe made red-hot in the fire without breaking, and then cover’d over with\r\nSand, so as no part of it be suffer’d to be open to the Air, then set into\r\na good fire, and there kept till the Sand has continu’d red hot for a\r\nquarter, half, an hour or two, or more, according to the nature and bigness\r\nof the body to be coal’d or charr’d, then taking it out of the fire, and\r\nletting it stand till it be quite cold, the body may be taken out of the\r\nSand well charr’d and cleans’d of its waterish parts; but in the taking of\r\nit out, care must be had that the Sand be very neer cold, for else, when it\r\ncomes into the free air, it will take fire, and readily burn away.\r\n\r\nThis maybe done also in any close Vessel of Glass, as a _Retort_, or the\r\nlike, and the several fluid substances that come over may be receiv’d in a\r\nfit _Recipient_, which will yet further countenance this _Hypothesis_: And\r\ntheir manner of charring Wood in great quantity comes much to the same\r\nthing, namely, an application of a great heat to the body, and preserving\r\nit from the free access of the devouring air; this may be easily learn’d\r\nfrom the History of Charring of Coal, most excellently describ’d and\r\npublish’d by that most accomplish’d Gentleman, Mr. _John Evelin_, in the\r\n100, 101, 103, pages of his _Sylva_, to which I shall therefore refer the\r\ncurious Reader that desires a full information of it.\r\n\r\nNext, we may learn what part of the Wood it is that is the _combustible_\r\nmatter, for since we shall find that none, or very little of those fluid\r\nsubstances that are driven over into the Receiver are _combustible_, and\r\nthat most of that which is left behind is so, it follows, that the solid\r\n_interstitia_ of the Wood are the _combustible_ matter. Further, the reason\r\nwhy uncharr’d Wood burns with a greater flame then that which is charr’d,\r\nis as evident, because those waterish or volatil parts issuing out of the\r\nfired Wood, every way, not onely shatter and open the body, the better for\r\nthe fire to enter, but issuing out in vapours or wind, they become like so\r\nmany little _æolipiles_, or Bellows, whereby they blow and agitate the\r\nfir’d part, and conduce to the more speedy and violent consumption or\r\ndissolution of the body.\r\n\r\nThirdly, from the Experiment of charring of Coals (whereby we see that\r\nnotwithstanding the great heat, and the duration of it, the solid parts of\r\nthe Wood remain, whilest they are preserv’d from the free access of the air\r\nundissipated) we may learn, that which has not, that I know of, been\r\npublish’d or hinted, nay, not so much as thought of, by any; and that in\r\nshort is this.\r\n\r\nFirst, _that the Air_ in which we live, move, and breath, and which\r\nencompasses very many, and cherishes most bodies it encompasses, that this\r\nAir is the _menstruum_, or universal dissolvent of all _Sulphureous_\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _that this action_ it performs not, till the body be first\r\nsufficiently heated, as we find requisite also to the dissolution of many\r\nother bodies by several other _menstruums_.\r\n\r\nThirdly, _that this action_ of dissolution, produces or generates a very\r\ngreat heat, and that which we call Fire; and this is common also to many\r\ndissolutions of other bodies, made by _menstruums_, of which I could give\r\nmultitudes of Instances.\r\n\r\nFourthly, _that this action_ is perform’d with so great a violence, and\r\ndoes so minutely act, and rapidly agitate the smallest parts of the\r\n_combustible_ matter, that it produces in the _diaphanous medium_ of the\r\nAir, the action or pulse of light, which what it is, I have else-where\r\nalready shewn.\r\n\r\nFifthly, _that the dissolution_ of sulphureous bodies is made by a\r\nsubstance inherent, and mixt with the Air, that is like, if not the very\r\nsame, with that which is fixt in _Salt-peter_, which by multitudes of\r\nExperiments that may be made with _Salt-peter_, will, I think, most\r\nevidently be demonstrated.\r\n\r\nSixthly, _that in this dissolution_ of bodies by the Air, a certain part is\r\nunited and mixt, or dissolv’d and turn’d into the Air, and made to fly up\r\nand down with it in the same manner as a _metalline_ or other body\r\ndissolved into any _menstruums_, does follow the motions and progresses of\r\nthat _menstruum_ till it be precipitated.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, That as there is one part that is dissoluble by the Air, so are\r\nthere other parts with which the parts of the Air mixing and uniting, do\r\nmake a _Coagulum_, or _precipitation_, as one may call it, which causes it\r\nto be separated from the Air, but this _precipitate_ is so light, and in so\r\nsmall and rarify’d or porous clusters, that it is very volatil, and is\r\neasily carry’d up by the motion of the Air, though afterwards, when the\r\nheat and agitation that kept it rarify’d ceases, it easily condenses, and\r\ncommixt with other indissoluble parts, it sticks and adheres to the next\r\nbodies it meets withall; and this is a certain _Salt_ that may be extracted\r\nout of _Soot_.\r\n\r\nEighthly, that many indissoluble parts being very apt and prompt to be\r\nrarify’d, and so, whilest they continue in that heat and agitation, are\r\nlighter then the Ambient Air, are thereby thrust and carry’d upwards with\r\ngreat violence, and by that means carry along with them, not onely that\r\n_Saline concrete_ I mention’d before, but many terrestrial, or indissoluble\r\nand irrarefiable parts, nay, many parts also which are dissoluble, but are\r\nnot suffer’d to stay long enough in a sufficient heat to make them prompt\r\nand apt for that action. And therefore we find in _Soot_, not onely a part,\r\nthat being continued longer in a competent heat, will be dissolv’d by the\r\nAir, or take fire and burn; but a part also which is fixt, terrestrial, and\r\nirrarefiable.\r\n\r\nNinthly, that as there are these several parts that will rarifie and fly,\r\nor be driven up by the heat, so are there many others, that as they are\r\nindissoluble by the _aerial menstruum_, so are they of such sluggish and\r\ngross parts, that they are not easily rarify’d by heat, and therefore\r\ncannot be rais’d by it; the volatility or fixtness of a body seeming to\r\nconsist only in this, that the one is of a texture, or has component parts\r\nthat will be easily rarify’d into the form of Air, and the other, that it\r\nhas such as will not, without much ado, be brought to such a constitution;\r\nand this is that part which remains behind in a white body call’d Ashes,\r\nwhich contains a substance, or _Salt_, which Chymists call _Alkali_: what\r\nthe particular natures of each of these bodies are, I shall not here\r\nexamine, intending it in another place, but shall rather add that this\r\n_Hypothesis_ does so exactly agree with all _Phænomena_, of Fire, and so\r\ngenuinely explicate each particular circumstance that I have hitherto\r\nobserv’d, that it is more then probable, that this cause which I have\r\nassign’d is the true adequate, real, and onely cause of those _Phænomena_;\r\nAnd therefore I shall proceed a little further, to shew the nature and use\r\nof the Air.\r\n\r\nTenthly, therefore the dissolving parts of the Air are but few, that is, it\r\nseems of the nature of those _Saline menstruums_, or spirits, that have\r\nvery much flegme mixt with the spirits, and therefore a small parcel of it\r\nis quickly glutted, and will dissolve no more; and therefore unless some\r\nfresh part of this _menstruum_ be apply’d to the body to be dissolv’d, the\r\naction ceases, and the body leaves to be dissolv’d and to shine, which is\r\nthe Indication of it, though plac’d or kept in the greatest heat; whereas\r\n_Salt-peter_ is a _menstruum_, when melted and red-hot, that abounds more\r\nwith those Dissolvent particles, and therefore as a small quantity of it\r\nwill dissolve a great sulphureous body, so will the dissolution be very\r\nquick and violent.\r\n\r\nTherefore in the _Eleventh_ place, it is observable, that, as in other\r\nsolutions, if a copious and quick supply of fresh _menstruum_, though but\r\nweak, be poured on, or applied to the dissoluble body, it quickly consumes\r\nit: So this _menstruum_ of the Air, if by Bellows, or any other such\r\ncontrivance, it be copiously apply’d to the shining body, is found to\r\ndissolve it as soon, and as violently as the more strong _menstruum_ of\r\nmelted _Nitre_.\r\n\r\nTherefore twelfthly, it seems reasonable to think that there is no such\r\nthing as an Element of Fire that should attract or draw up the flame, or\r\ntowards which the flame should endeavour to ascend out of a desire or\r\nappetite of uniting with that as its _Homogeneal_ primitive and generating\r\nElement; but that that shining transient body which we call _Flame_, is\r\nnothing else but a mixture of Air, and volatil sulphureous parts of\r\ndissoluble or combustible bodies, which are acting upon each other whilst\r\nthey ascend, that is, flame seems to be a mixture of Air, and the\r\ncombustible volatil parts of any body, which parts the encompassing Air\r\ndoes dissolve or work upon, which action, as it does intend the heat of the\r\n_aerial_ parts of the dissolvent, so does it thereby further rarifie those\r\nparts that are acting, or that are very neer them, whereby they growing\r\nmuch lighter then the heavie parts of that _Menstruum_ that are more\r\nremote, are thereby protruded and driven upward; and this may be easily\r\nobserv’d also in dissolutions made by any other _menstruum_, especially such\r\nas either create heat or bubbles. Now, this action of the _Menstruum_, or\r\n_Air_, on the dissoluble parts, is made with such violence, or is such,\r\nthat it imparts such a motion or pulse to the _diaphanous_ parts of the\r\nAir, as I have elsewhere shewn is requisite to produce light.\r\n\r\nThis _Hypothesis_ I have endeavoured to raise from an Infinite of\r\nObservations and Experiments, the process of which would be much too long\r\nto be here inserted, and will perhaps another time afford matter copious\r\nenough for a much larger Discourse, the Air being a Subject which (though\r\nall the world has hitherto liv’d and breath’d in, and been unconversant\r\nabout) has yet been so little truly examin’d or explain’d, that a diligent\r\nenquirer will be able to find but very little information from what has\r\nbeen (till of late) written of it: But being once well understood, it will,\r\nI doubt not, inable a man to render an intelligible, nay probable, if not\r\nthe true reason of all the _Phænomena_ of Fire, which, as it has been found\r\nby Writers and Philosophers of all Ages a matter of no small difficulty, as\r\nmay be sufficiently understood by their strange _Hypotheses_, and\r\nunintelligible Solutions of some few _Phænomena_ of it; so will it prove a\r\nmatter of no small concern and use in humane affairs, as I shall elsewhere\r\nendeavour to manifest when I come to shew the use of the Air in\r\nrespiration, and for the preservation of the life, nay, for the\r\nconservation and restauration of the health and natural constitution of\r\nmankind as well as all other aereal _animals_, as also the uses of this\r\nprinciple or propriety of the Air in chymical, mechanical, and other\r\noperations. In this place I have onely time to hint an _Hypothesis_, which,\r\nif God permit me life and opportunity, I may elsewhere prosecute, improve\r\nand publish. In the mean time, before I finish this Discourse, I must not\r\nforget to acquaint the Reader, that having had the liberty granted me of\r\nmaking some trials on a piece of _Lignum fossile_ shewn to the Royal\r\nSociety, by the eminently Ingenious and Learned Physician, Doctor _Ent_,\r\nwho receiv’d it for a Present from the famous _Ingenioso Cavalliero de\r\nPozzi_, it being one of the fairest and best pieces of _Lignum fossile_ he\r\nhad seen; Having (I say) taken a small piece of this Wood, and examin’d it,\r\nI found it to burn in the open Air almost like other Wood, and insteed of a\r\nresinous smoak or fume, it yielded a very bituminous one, smelling much of\r\nthat kind of sent: But that which I chiefly took notice of, was, that\r\ncutting off a small piece of it, about the bigness of my Thumb, and\r\ncharring it in a _Crucible_ with Sand, after the manner I above prescrib’d,\r\nI found it infinitely to abound with the smaller sort of pores, so\r\nextreamly thick, and so regularly perforating the substance of it\r\nlong-ways, that breaking it off across, I found it to look very like an\r\nHoney-comb; but as for any of the second, or bigger kind of pores, I could\r\nnot find that it had any; so that it seems, whatever were the cause of its\r\nproduction, it was not without those small kind of pores which we have\r\nonely hitherto found in Vegetable bodies: and comparing them with the pores\r\nwhich I have found in the Charcoals that I by this means made of several\r\nother kinds of Wood, I find it resemble none so much as those of Firr, to\r\nwhich it is not much unlike in grain also, and several other proprieties.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, what ever is by some, who have written of it, and\r\nparticularly by _Francisco Stelluto_, wrote a Treatise in _Italian_ of that\r\nSubject, which was Printed at _Rome_, 1637, affirm’d that it is a certain\r\nkind of Clay or Earth, which in tract of time is turn’d into Wood; I rather\r\nsuspect the quite contrary, that it was at first certain great Trees of Fir\r\nor Pine, which by some Earthquake, or other casualty, came to be buried\r\nunder the Earth, and was there, after a long time’s residence (according to\r\nthe several natures of the encompassing adjacent parts) either rotted and\r\nturn’d into a kind of Clay, or _petrify’d_ and turn’d into a kind of Stone,\r\nor else had its pores fill’d with certain Mineral juices, which being\r\nstay’d in them, and in tract of time coagulated, appear’d, upon cleaving\r\nout, like small Metalline Wires, or else from some flames or scorching forms\r\nthat are the occasion oftentimes, and usually accompany Earthquakes, might\r\nbe blasted and turn’d into Coal, or else from certain _subterraneous_ fires\r\nwhich are affirm’d by that Authour to abound much about those parts\r\n(namely, in a Province of _Italy_, call’d _Umbria_, now the _Dutchie_ of\r\n_Spoletto_, in the Territory of _Todi_, anciently call’d _Tudor_; and\r\nbetween the two Villages of _Collesecco_ and _Rosaro_ not far distant from\r\nthe high-way leading to _Rome_, where it is found in greater quantity then\r\nelsewhere) are by reason of their being encompassed with Earth, and so kept\r\nclose from the dissolving Air, charr’d and converted into Coal. It would be\r\ntoo long a work to describe the several kinds of pores which I met withall,\r\nand by this means discovered in several other Vegetable bodies; nor is it\r\nmy present design to expatiate upon Instances of the same kind, but rather\r\nto give a Specimen of as many kinds as I have had opportunity as yet of\r\nobserving, reserving the prosecution and enlarging on particulars till a\r\nmore fit opportunity; and in prosecution of this design, I shall here add:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XVII. _Of _Petrify’d wood_, and other _Petrify’d bodies_._\r\n\r\nOf this sort of substance, I observ’d several pieces of very differing\r\nkinds, both for their outward shape, colour, grain, _texture_, hardness,\r\n&c. some being brown and reddish; others gray, like a Hone; others black,\r\nand Flint-like: some soft, like a Slate or Whetstone, others as hard as a\r\nFlint, and as brittle. That which I more particular examin’d, was a piece\r\nabout the bigness of a mans hand, which seem’d to have been a part of some\r\nlarge tree, that by rottenness had been broken off from it before it began\r\nto be _petrify’d_.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, all that I have yet seen, seem to have been rotten Wood before\r\nthe petrifaction was begun; and not long since, examining and viewing a\r\nhuge great _Oak_, that seem’d with meer age to be rotten as it stood, I was\r\nvery much confirm’d in this opinion; for I found, that the grain, colour,\r\nand shape of the Wood, was exactly like this _petrify’d_ substance; and\r\nwith a _Microscope_, I found, that all those _Microscopical_ pores, which\r\nin sappy or firm and sound Wood are fill’d with the natural or innate\r\njuices of those Vegetables, in this they were all empty, like those of\r\n_Vegetables charr’d_; but with this difference, that they seem’d much\r\nlarger then I have seen any in _Charcoals_; nay, even then those of Coals\r\nmade of great blocks of Timber, which are commonly call’d _Old-coals_.\r\n\r\nThe reason of which difference may probably be, that the charring of\r\nVegetables, being an operation quickly perform’d, and whilest the Wood is\r\nsappy, the more solid parts may more easily shrink together, and contract\r\nthe pores or _interstitia_ between them, then in the rotten Wood, where\r\nthat natural juice seems onely to be wash’d away by _adventitious_ or\r\nunnatural moisture; and so though the natural juice be wasted from between\r\nthe firm parts, yet those parts are kept asunder by the _adventitious_\r\nmoystures, and so by degrees settled in those postures.\r\n\r\nAnd this I likewise found in the _petrify’d_ Wood, that the pores were\r\nsomewhat bigger then those of _Charcoal_, each pore being neer upon half as\r\nbigg again, but they did not bear that disproportion which is exprest in\r\nthe tenth _Scheme_, between the small specks or pores in the first Figure\r\n(which representeth the pores of Coal or Wood charr’d) and the black spots\r\nof the second Figure (which represent the like _Microscopical pores_ in the\r\n_petrify’d_ Wood) for these last were drawn by a _Microscope_ that\r\nmagnify’d the object above six times more in Diameter then the _Microscope_\r\nby which those pores of Coal were observ’d.\r\n\r\nNow, though they were a little bigger, yet did they keep the exact figure\r\nand order of the pores of Coals and of rotten Wood, which last also were\r\nmuch of the same cize.\r\n\r\nThe other Observations on this _petrify’d_ substance, that a while since,\r\nby the appointment of the _Royal Society_, I made, and presented to them an\r\naccount of, were these that follow, which had the honour done them by the\r\nmost accomplish’d Mr. _Evelin_, my highly honoured friend, to be inserted\r\nand published among those excellent Observations wherewith his _Sylva_ is\r\nreplenish’d, and would therefore have been here omitted, had not the Figure\r\nof them, as they appear’d through the _Microscope_ been before that\r\nengraven.\r\n\r\nThis _Petrify’d_ substance resembled Wood, in that\r\n\r\nFirst, all the parts of it seem’d not at all _dislocated_, or alter’d from\r\ntheir natural Position, whil’st they were Wood, but the whole piece\r\nretain’d the exact shape of Wood, having many of the conspicuous pores of\r\nwood still remaining pores, and shewing a manifest difference visible\r\nenough between the grain of the Wood and that of the bark, especially when\r\nany side of it was cut smooth and polite; for then it appear’d to have a\r\nvery lovely grain, like that of some curious close Wood.\r\n\r\nNext (it resembled Wood) in that all the smaller and (if I may so call\r\nthose which are onely visible with a good magnifying Glass) _Microscopical_\r\npores of it appear (both when the substance is cut and polish’d\r\n_transversly_ and _parallel_ to the pores of it) perfectly like the\r\n_Microscopical_ pores of several kinds of Wood, especially like and equal\r\nto those of several sorts of rotten Wood which I have since observ’d,\r\nretaining both the shape, position and magnitude of such pores. It was\r\ndiffering from Wood:\r\n\r\nFirst; in _weight_, being to common water as 3¼ to 1. whereas there are few\r\nof our _English_ Woods, that when very dry are found to be full as heavie\r\nas water.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in _hardness_, being very neer as hard as a Flint; and in some\r\nplaces of it also resembling the grain of a Flint: and, like it, it would\r\nvery readily cut Glass, and would not without difficulty, especially in\r\nsome parts of it, be scratch’d by a black hard Flint: It would also as\r\nreadily strike fire against a Steel, or against a Flint, as any common\r\nFlint.\r\n\r\nThirdly, in the _closeness_ of it, for though all the _Microscopical_ pores\r\nof this _petrify’d_ substance were very conspicuous in one position, yet by\r\naltering that position of the polish’d surface to the light, it was also\r\nmanifest, that those pores appear’d darker then the rest of the body, onely\r\nbecause they were fill’d up with a more duskie substance, and not because\r\nthey were hollow.\r\n\r\nFourthly, in its _incombustibleness_, in that it would not burn in the\r\nfire; nay, though I kept it a good while red-hot in the flame of a Lamp,\r\nmade very _intense_ by the blast of a small Pipe, and a large Charcoal, yet\r\nit seem’d not at all to have diminish’d its extension; but only I found it\r\nto have chang’d its colour, and to appear of a more dark and duskie brown\r\ncolour; nor could I perceive that those parts which seem’d to have been\r\nWood at first, were any thing wasted, but the parts appear’d as solid and\r\nclose as before. It was further observable also, that as it did not consume\r\nlike Wood, so neither did it crack and flie like a Flint, or such like hard\r\nStone, nor was it long before it appear’d red-hot.\r\n\r\nFifthly, in its _dissolubleness_; for putting some drops of distill’d\r\n_Vinegar_ upon the Stone, I found it presently to yield very many Bubbles,\r\njust like those which may be observ’d in spirit of _Vinegar_ when it\r\ncorrodes _corals_, though perhaps many of those small Bubbles might proceed\r\nfrom some small parcels of Air which were driven out of the pores of this\r\n_petrify’d_ substance by the insinuating liquid _menstruum_.\r\n\r\nSixthly, in its _rigidness_, and _friability_, being not at all flexible\r\nbut brittle like a Flint, insomuch that I could with one knock of a Hammer\r\nbreak off a piece of it, and with a few more, reduce that into a pretty\r\nfine powder.\r\n\r\nSeventhly, it seem’d also very differing from Wood to the _touch_,\r\n_feeling_ more cold then Wood usually does, and much like other close\r\nstones and Minerals.\r\n\r\nThe Reasons of all which _Phænomena_ seem to be,\r\n\r\nThat _petrify’d_ Wood having lain in some place where it was well soak’d\r\nwith _petrifying_ water (that is, such a water as is well _impregnated_\r\nwith stony and earthy particles) did by degrees separate, either by\r\nstraining and _filtration_, or perhaps, by _precipitation_, _cohesion_ or\r\n_coagulation_, abundance of stony particles from the permeating water,\r\nwhich stony particles, being by means of the fluid _vehicle_ convey’d, not\r\nonely into the _Microscopical_ pores, and so perfectly stopping them up, but\r\nalso into the pores or _interstitia_, which may, perhaps, be even in the\r\ntexture or _Schematisme_ of that part of the Wood, which, through the\r\n_Microscope_, appears most solid, do thereby so augment the weight of the\r\nWood, as to make it above three times heavier then water, and perhaps, six\r\ntimes as heavie as it was when Wood.\r\n\r\nNext, they thereby so lock up and fetter the parts of the Wood, that the\r\nfire cannot easily make them flie away, but the action of the fire upon\r\nthem is onely able to _Char_ those parts, as it were, like a piece of Wood,\r\nif it be clos’d very fast up in Clay, and kept a good while red-hot in the\r\nfire, will by the heat of the fire be charr’d and not consum’d, which may,\r\nperhaps, also be somewhat of the cause, why the _petrify’d_ substance\r\nappear’d of a dark brown colour after it had been burnt.\r\n\r\nBy this _intrusion_ of the _petrifying_ particles, this substance also\r\nbecomes hard and _friable_; for the smaller pores of the Wood being\r\nperfectly wedg’d, and stuft up with those stony particles, the small parts\r\nof the Wood have no places or pores into which they may slide upon bending,\r\nand consequently little or no flexion or yielding at all can be caus’d in\r\nsuch a substance.\r\n\r\nThe remaining particles likewise of the Wood among the stony particles, may\r\nkeep them from cracking and flying when put into the fire, as they are very\r\napt to do in a Flint.\r\n\r\nNor is Wood the onely substance that may by this kind of _transmutation_ be\r\nchang’d into stone; for I my self have seen and examin’d very many kinds of\r\nsubstances, and among very credible Authours, we may meet with Histories of\r\nsuch _Metamorphoses_ wrought almost on all kind of substances, both\r\n_Vegetable_ and _Animal_, which Histories, it is not my business at\r\npresent, either to relate, or _epitomise_, but only to set down some\r\nObservation I lately made on several kind of _petrify’d_ Shels, found about\r\n_Keinsham_, which lies within four or five miles of _Bristol_, which are\r\ncommonly call’d _Serpentine-stones._\r\n\r\nExamining several of these very curiously figur’d bodies (which are\r\ncommonly thought to be Stones form’d by some extraordinary _Plastick\r\nvirtue_ _latent_ in the Earth it self) I took notice of these particulars:\r\n\r\nFirst, that these figured bodies, or stones, were of very differing\r\nsubstances, as to hardness: some of Clay, some Marle, some soft Stone,\r\nalmost of the hardness of those soft stones which Masons call Fire-stone,\r\nothers as hard as Portland stone, others as hard as Marble, and some as\r\nhard as a Flint or Crystal.\r\n\r\nNext, they were of very differing substances as to transparency and colour;\r\nsome white, some almost black, some brown, some Metalline, or like\r\nMarchasites; some transparent like white Marble, others like flaw’d\r\nCrystal, some gray, some of divers colours; some radiated like those long\r\n_petrify’d drops_, which are commonly found at the _Peak_, and in other\r\n_subterraneous caverns_, which have a kind of pith in the middle.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that they were very different as to the manner of their outward\r\nfiguration; for some of them seem’d to have been the substance that had\r\nfill’d the Shell of some kind of Shel-fish; others, to have been the\r\nsubstance that had contain’d or enwrapp’d one of those Shels, on both\r\nwhich, the perfect impression either of the inside or outside of such\r\nShells seem’d to be left, but for the most part, those impressions seem’d\r\nto be made by an imperfect or broken Shell, the great end or mouth of the\r\nShell being always wanting, and oftentimes the little end, and sometimes\r\nhalf, and in some there were impressions, just as if there had been holes\r\nbroken in the figurating, imprinting or moulding Shell; some of them seem’d\r\nto be made by such a Shell very much brused or flaw’d, insomuch that one\r\nwould verily have thought that very figur’d stone had been broken or brused\r\nwhilst a gelly, as ’twere, and so hardned, but within in the grain of the\r\nstone, there appear’d not the least sign of any such bruse or breaking, but\r\nonely on the very uttermost superficies.\r\n\r\nFourthly, they were very different, as to their outward covering, some\r\nhaving the perfect Shell, both in figure, colour, and substance, sticking\r\non upon its surface, and adhering to it, but might very easily be separated\r\nfrom it, and like other common _Cockle_ or _Scolop-shels_, which some of\r\nthem most accurately resembled, were very dissoluble in common _Vinegar_,\r\nothers of them, especially those _Serpentine_, or _Helical stones_ were\r\ncover’d or retained the shining or Pearl-colour’d substance of the inside\r\nof a Shel, which substance, on some parts of them, was exceeding thin, and\r\nmight very easily be rubbed off; on other parts it was pretty thick, and\r\nretained a white coat, or flaky substance on the top, just like the\r\noutsides of such Shells; some of them had very large pieces of the Shell\r\nvery plainly sticking on to them, which were easily to be broken or flaked\r\noff by degrees: they likewise, some of them retain’d all along the surface\r\nof them very pretty kind of _sutures_, such as are observ’d in the skulls\r\nof several kinds of living creatures, which _sutures_ were most curiously\r\nshap’d in the manner of leaves, and every one of them in the same Shell,\r\nexactly one like another, which I was able to discover plainly enough with\r\nmy naked eye, but more perfectly and distinctly with my _Microscope_; all\r\nthese sutures, by breaking some of these stones, I found to be the\r\n_termini_, or boundings of certain _diaphragms_, or partitions, which\r\nseem’d to divide the cavity of the Shell into a multitude of very\r\nproportionate and regular _cells_ or _caverns_, these _Diaphragms_, in many\r\nof them, I found very perfect and compleat, of a very distinct substance\r\nfrom that which fill’d the cavities, and exactly of the same kind with that\r\nwhich covered the outside, being for the most part whitish, or\r\n_mother of pearl_ colour’d.\r\n\r\nAs for the cavities between those _Diaphragms_, I found some of them fill’d\r\nwith Marle, and others with several kinds of stones, others, for the most\r\npart hollow, onely the whole cavity was usually covered over with a kind of\r\n_tartareous petrify’d_ substance, which stuck about the sides, and was\r\nthere shot into very curious regular Figures, just as _Tartar_, or other\r\ndissolv’d Salts are observ’d to stick and _crystallize_ about the sides of\r\nthe containing Vessels; or like those little _Diamants_ which I before\r\nobserved to have covered the vaulted cavity of a Flint; others had these\r\ncavities all lin’d with a kind of _metalline_ or _marchasite-like_\r\nsubstance, which with a _Microscope_ I could as plainly see most curiously\r\nand regularly figured, as I had done those in a Flint.\r\n\r\nFrom all which, and several other particulars which I observ’d, I cannot\r\nbut think, that all these, and most other kinds of stony bodies which are\r\nfound thus strangely figured, do owe their formation and figuration, not to\r\nany kind of _Plastick virtue_ inherent in the earth, but to the Shells of\r\ncertain Shel-fishes, which, either by some Deluge, Inundation, Earthquake,\r\nor some such other means, came to be thrown to that place, and there to be\r\nfill’d with some kind of Mudd or Clay, or _petrifying_ Water, or some other\r\nsubstance, which in tract of time has been settled together and hardned in\r\nthose shelly moulds into those shaped substances we now find them; that the\r\ngreat and thin end of these Shells by that Earthquake, or what ever other\r\nextraordinary cause it was that brought them thither, was broken off; and\r\nthat many others were otherwise broken, bruised and disfigured; that these\r\nShells which are thus _spirallied_ and separated with _Diaphragmes_, were\r\nsome kind of _Nautili_ or _Porcelane shells_; and that others were shells\r\nof _Cockles_, _Muscles_, _Periwincles_, _Scolops_, &c. of various sorts;\r\nthat these Shells in many, from the particular nature of the containing or\r\nenclos’d Earth, or some other cause, have in tract of time rotted and\r\nmouldred away, and onely left their impressions, both on the containing and\r\ncontained substances; and so left them pretty loose one within another, so\r\nthat they may be easily separated by a knock or two of a Hammer. That\r\nothers of these Shells, according to the nature of the substances adjacent\r\nto them, have, by a long continuance in that posture, been _petrify’d_ and\r\nturn’d into the nature of stone, just as I even now observ’d several sorts\r\nof Wood to be. That oftentimes the Shell may be found with one kind of\r\nsubstance within, and quite another without; having, perhaps, been fill’d\r\nin one place, and afterwards translated to another, which I have very\r\nfrequently observ’d in _Cockle_, _Muscle_, _Periwincle_, and other shells,\r\nwhich I have found by the Sea side. Nay, further, that some parts of the\r\nsame Shell may be fill’d in one place, and some other caverns in another,\r\nand others in a third, or a fourth, or a fifth place, for so many differing\r\nsubstances have I found in one of these _petrify’d_ Shells, and perhaps all\r\nthese differing from the encompassing earth or stone; the means how all\r\nwhich varieties may be caus’d, I think, will not be difficult to conceive,\r\nto any one that has taken notice of those Shells, which are commonly found\r\non the Sea shore: And he that shall throughly examine several kinds of such\r\ncuriously form’d stones, will (I am very apt to think) find reason to\r\nsuppose their generation or formation to be ascribable to some such\r\naccidents as I have mention’d, and not to any _Plastick virtue_: For it\r\nseems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence of Nature, which is\r\nobservable in all its works and productions, to design every thing to a\r\ndeterminate end, and for the attaining of that end, makes use of such ways\r\nas are (as farr as the knowledge of man has yet been able to reach)\r\naltogether consonant, and most agreeable to man’s reason, and of no way or\r\nmeans that does contradict, or is contrary to humane Ratiocination; whence\r\nit has a long time been a general observation and _maxime_, that _Nature\r\ndoes nothing in vain_; It seems, I say, contrary to that great Wisdom of\r\nNature, that these prettily shap’d bodies should have all those curious\r\nFigures and contrivances (which many of them are adorn’d and contriv’d\r\nwith) generated or wrought by a _Plastick virtue_, for no higher end, then\r\nonely to exhibite such a form; which he that shall throughly consider all\r\nthe circumstances of such kind of Figur’d bodies, will, I think, have great\r\nreason to believe, though, I confess, one cannot presently be able to find\r\nout what Nature’s designs are. It were therefore very desirable, that a\r\ngood collection of such kind of figur’d stones were collected; and as many\r\nparticulars, circumstances, and informations collected with them as could\r\nbe obtained, that from such a History of Observations well rang’d, examin’d\r\nand digested, the true original or production of all those kinds of stones\r\nmight be perfectly and surely known; such as are _Thunder-stones_, _Lapides\r\nStellares_, _Lapides Judaici_, and multitudes of other, whereof mention is\r\nmade in _Aldonandus_, _Wormius_, and other Writers of Minerals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XVIII. _Of the _Schematisme_ or _Texture_ of _Cork_, and of the\r\nCells and Pores of some other such frothy Bodies._\r\n\r\nI took a good clear piece of Cork, and with a Pen-knife sharpen’d as keen\r\nas a Razor, I cut a piece of it off, and thereby left the surface of it\r\nexceeding smooth, then examining it very diligently with a _Microscope_, me\r\nthought I could perceive it to appear a little porous; but I could not so\r\nplainly distinguish them, as to be sure that they were pores, much less\r\nwhat Figure they were of: But judging from the lightness and yielding\r\nquality of the Cork, that certainly the texture could not be so curious,\r\nbut that possibly, if I could use some further diligence, I might find it\r\nto be discernable with a _Microscope_, I with the same sharp Penknife, cut\r\noff from the former smooth surface an exceeding thin piece of it, and\r\nplacing it on a black object Plate, because it was it self a white body,\r\nand casting the light on it with a deep _plano convex Glass_, I could\r\nexceeding plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a\r\nHoney-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular; yet it was not\r\nunlike a Honey-comb in these particulars.\r\n\r\nFirst, in that it had a very little solid substance, in comparison of the\r\nempty cavity that was contain’d between, as does more manifestly appear by\r\nthe Figure A and B of the XI. _Scheme_, for the _Interstitia_, or walls (as\r\nI may so call them) or partitions of those pores were neer as thin in\r\nproportion to their pores, as those thin films of Wax in a Honey-comb\r\n(which enclose and constitute the _sexangular celts_) are to theirs.\r\n\r\nNext, in that these pores, or cells, were not very deep, but consisted of a\r\ngreat many little Boxes, separated out of one continued long pore, by\r\ncertain _Diaphragms_, as is visible by the Figure B, which represents a\r\nsight of those pores split the long-ways.\r\n\r\nI no sooner discern’d these (which were indeed the first _microscopical_\r\npores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with\r\nany Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this) but me\r\nthought I had with the discovery of them, presently hinted to me the true\r\nand intelligible reason of all the _Phænomena_ of Cork; As,\r\n\r\nFirst, if I enquir’d why it was so exceeding light a body? my _Microscope_\r\ncould presently inform me that here was the same reason evident that there\r\nis found for the lightness of froth, an empty Honey-comb, Wool, a Spunge, a\r\nPumice-stone, or the like; namely, a very small quantity of a solid body,\r\nextended into exceeding large dimensions.\r\n\r\nNext, it seem’d nothing more difficult to give an intelligible reason, why\r\nCork is a body so very unapt to suck and drink in Water, and consequently\r\npreserves it self, floating on the top of Water, though left on it never so\r\nlong: and why it is able to stop and hold air in a Bottle, though it be\r\nthere very much condens’d and consequently presses very strongly to get a\r\npassage out, without suffering the least bubble to pass through its\r\nsubstance. For, as to the first, since our _Microscope_ informs us that the\r\nsubstance of Cork is altogether fill’d with Air, and that that Air is\r\nperfectly enclosed in little Boxes or Cells distinct from one another. It\r\nseems very plain, why neither the Water, nor any other Air can easily\r\ninsinuate it self into them, since there is already within them an _intus\r\nexistens_, and consequently, why the pieces of Cork become so good floats\r\nfor Nets, and stopples for Viols, or other close Vessels.\r\n\r\nAnd thirdly, if we enquire why Cork has such a springiness and swelling\r\nnature when compress’d? and how it comes to suffer so great a compression,\r\nor seeming penetration of dimensions, so as to be made a substance as\r\nheavie again and more, bulk for bulk, as it was before compression, and yet\r\nsuffer’d to return, is found to extend it self again into the same space?\r\nOur _Microscope_ will easily inform us, that the whole mass consists of an\r\ninfinite company of small Boxes or Bladders of Air, which is a substance of\r\na springy nature, and that will suffer a considerable condensation (as I\r\nhave several times found by divers trials, by which I have most evidently\r\ncondens’d it into less then a twentieth part of its usual dimensions neer\r\nthe Earth, and that with no other strength then that of my hands without\r\nany kind of forcing Engine, such as Racks, Leavers, Wheels, Pullies, or the\r\nlike, but this onely by and by) and besides, it seems very probable that\r\nthose very films or sides of the pores, have in them a springing quality,\r\nas almost all other kind of Vegetable substances have, so as to help to\r\nrestore themselves to their former position.\r\n\r\nAnd could we so easily and certainly discover the _Schematisme_ and\r\n_Texture_ even of these films, and of several other bodies, as we can these\r\nof Cork; there seems no probable reason to the contrary, but that we might\r\nas readily render the true reason of all their _Phænomena_; as namely, what\r\nwere the cause of the springiness, and toughness of some, both as to their\r\nflexibility and restitution. What, of the friability or brittleness of some\r\nothers, and the like; but till such time as our _Microscope_, or some other\r\nmeans, enable us to discover the true _Schematism_ and _Texture_ of all\r\nkinds of bodies, we must grope, as it were, in the dark, and onely ghess at\r\nthe true reasons of things by similitudes and comparisons.\r\n\r\nBut, to return to our Observation. I told several lines of these pores, and\r\nfound that there were usually about threescore of these small Cells placed\r\nend-ways in the eighteenth part of an Inch in length, whence I concluded\r\nthere must be neer eleven hundred of them, or somewhat more then a thousand\r\nin the length of an Inch, and therefore in a square Inch above a Million,\r\nor 1166400. and in a Cubick Inch, above twelve hundred Millions, or\r\n1259712000. a thing almost incredible, did not our _Microscope_ assure us\r\nof it by ocular demonstration; nay, did it not discover to us the pores of\r\na body, which were they _diaphragm’d_, like those of Cork, would afford us\r\nin one Cubick Inch, more then ten times as many little Cells, as is evident\r\nin several charr’d Vegetables; so prodigiously curious are the works of\r\nNature, that even these conspicuous pores of bodies, which seem to be the\r\nchannels or pipes through which the _Succus nutritius_, or natural juices\r\nof Vegetables are convey’d, and seem to correspond to the veins, arteries\r\nand other Vessels in sensible creatures, that these pores I say, which seem\r\nto be the Vessels of nutrition to the vastest body in the World, are yet so\r\nexceeding small, that the _Atoms_ which _Epicurus_ fancy’d would go neer to\r\nprove too bigg to enter them, much more to constitute a fluid body in them.\r\nAnd how infinitely smaller then must be the Vessels of a Mite, or the pores\r\nof one of those little Vegetables I have discovered to grow on the\r\nback side of a Rose-leaf, and shall anon more fully describe, whose bulk is\r\nmany millions of times less then the bulk of the small shrub it grows on;\r\nand even that shrub, many millions of times less in bulk then several trees\r\n(that have heretofore grown in _England_, and are this day flourishing in\r\nother hotter Climates, as we are very credibly inform’d) if at least the\r\npores of this small Vegetable should keep any such proportion to the body\r\nof it, as we have found these pores of other Vegetables to do to their\r\nbulk. But of these pores I have said more elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTo proceed then, Cork seems to be by the transverse constitution of the\r\npores, a kind of _Fungus_ or Mushrome, for the pores lie like so many Rays\r\ntending from the center, or pith of the tree, outwards; so that if you cut\r\noff a piece from a board of Cork transversly, to the flat of it, you will,\r\nas it were, split the pores, and they will appear just as they are\r\nexpress’d in the Figure B of the XI. _Scheme_. But if you shave off a very\r\nthin piece from this board, parallel to the plain of it, you will cut all\r\nthe pores transversly, and they will appear almost as they are express’d in\r\nthe Figure A, save onely the solid _Interstitia_ will not appear so thick\r\nas they are there represented.\r\n\r\nSo that Cork seems to suck its nourishment from the subjacent bark of the\r\nTree immediately, and to be a kind of excrescence, or a substance distinct\r\nfrom the substances of the entire Tree, something _analogus_ to the\r\nMushrome, or Moss on other Trees, or to the hairs on Animals. And having\r\nenquir’d into the History of Cork, I find it reckoned as an excrescency of\r\nthe bark of a certain Tree, which is distinct from the two barks that lie\r\nwithin it, which are common also to other trees; That ’tis some time before\r\nthe Cork that covers the young and tender sprouts comes to be discernable;\r\nThat it cracks, flaws, and cleaves into many great chaps, the bark\r\nunderneath remaining entire; That it may be separated and remov’d from the\r\nTree, and yet the two under-barks (such as are also common to that with\r\nother Trees) not at all injur’d, but rather helped and freed from an\r\nexternal injury. Thus _Jonstonus_ in _Dendrologia_, speaking _de Subere_,\r\nsays, _Arbor est procera, Lignum est robustum, dempto cortice in aquis non\r\nfluitat, Cortice in orbem detracto juvatur, crascescens enim præstringit &\r\nstrangulat, intra triennium iterum repletur: Caudex ubi adolescit crassus,\r\ncortex superior densus carnosus, duos digitos crassus, scaber, rimosus, &\r\nqui nisi detrahatur dehiscit, alioque subnascente expellitur, interior qui\r\nsubest novellus ita rubet ut arbor minio picta videatur_. Which Histories,\r\nif well consider’d, and the tree, substance, and manner of growing, if well\r\nexamin’d, would, I am very apt to believe, much confirm this my conjecture\r\nabout the origination of Cork.\r\n\r\nNor is this kind of Texture peculiar to Cork onely; for upon examination\r\nwith my _Microscope_, I have found that the pith of an Elder, or almost any\r\nother Tree, the inner pulp or pith of the Cany hollow stalks of several\r\nother Vegetables: as of Fennel, Carrets, Daucus, Bur-docks, Teasels, Fearn,\r\nsome kinds of Reeds, &c. have much such a kind of _Schematisme_, as I have\r\nlately shewn that of Cork, save onely that here the pores are rang’d the\r\nlong-ways, or the same ways with the length of the Cane, whereas in Cork\r\nthey are transverse.\r\n\r\nThe pith also that fills that part of the stalk of a Feather that is above\r\nthe Quil, has much such a kind of texture, save onely that which way soever\r\nI set this light substance, the pores seem’d to be cut transversly; so that\r\nI ghess this pith which fills the Feather, not to consist of abundance of\r\nlong pores separated with Diaphragms, as Cork does, but to be a kind of\r\nsolid or hardned froth, or a _congeries_ of very small bubbles consolidated\r\nin that form, into a pretty stiff as well as tough concrete, and that each\r\nCavern, Bubble, or Cell, is distinctly separate from any of the rest,\r\nwithout any kind of hole in the encompassing films, so that I could no more\r\nblow through a piece of this kinde of substance, then I could through a\r\npiece of Cork, or the sound pith of an Elder.\r\n\r\nBut though I could not with my _Microscope_, nor with my breath, nor any\r\nother way I have yet try’d, discover a passage out of one of those cavities\r\ninto another, yet I cannot thence conclude, that therefore there are none\r\nsuch, by which the _Succus nutritius_, or appropriate juices of Vegetables,\r\nmay pass through them; for, in several of those Vegetables, whil’st green,\r\nI have with my _Microscope_, plainly enough discover’d these Cells or Poles\r\nfill’d with juices, and by degrees sweating them out; as I have also\r\nobserved in green Wood all those long _Microscopical_ pores which appear in\r\nCharcoal perfectly empty of any thing but Air.\r\n\r\nNow, though I have with great diligence endeavoured to find whether there\r\nbe any such thing in those _Microscopical_ pores of Wood or Piths, as the\r\n_Valves_ in the heart, veins, and other passages of Animals, that open and\r\ngive passage to the contain’d fluid juices one way, and shut themselves,\r\nand impede the passage of such liquors back again, yet have I not hitherto\r\nbeen able to say any thing positive in it; though, me thinks, it seems very\r\nprobable, that Nature has in these passages, as well as in those of Animal\r\nbodies, very many appropriated Instruments and contrivances, whereby to\r\nbring her designs and end to pass, which ’tis not improbable, but that some\r\ndiligent Observer, if help’d with better _Microscopes_, may in time detect.\r\n\r\nAnd that this may be so, seems with great probability to be argued from the\r\nstrange _Phænomena_ of sensitive Plants, wherein Nature seems to perform\r\nseveral Animal actions with the same _Schematism_ or _Orginization_ that is\r\ncommon to all Vegetables, as may appear by some no less instructive then\r\ncurious Observations that were made by divers Eminent Members of the _Royal\r\nSociety_ on some of these kind of Plants, whereof an account was delivered\r\nin to them by the most Ingenious and Excellent _Physician_, Doctor _Clark_,\r\nwhich, having that liberty granted me by that most Illustrious Society, I\r\nhave hereunto adjoyn’d.\r\n\r\n_Observations on the _Humble_ and _Sensible Plants_ in _M Chiffin’s_ Garden\r\nin Saint _James_’s Park, made _August_ the _9th, 1661_._ _Present, the_\r\nLord _Brouncker_, Sr. _Robert Moray_, Dr. _Wilkins_, Mr. _Evelin_, Dr.\r\n_Henshaw_, _and_ Dr. _Clark_.\r\n\r\n    There are four Plants, two of which are little shrub Plants, with a\r\n    little short stock, about an Inch above the ground, from whence are\r\n    spread several sticky branches, round, streight, and smooth in the\r\n    distances between the Sprouts, but just under the Sprouts there are two\r\n    sharp thorny prickles, broad in the letting on, as in the Bramble, one\r\n    just under the Sprout, the other on the opposite side of the branch.\r\n\r\n    [14]The distances betwixt the Sprouts are usually something more then\r\n    an Inch, and many upon a Branch, according to its length, and they grew\r\n    so, that if the lower Sprout be on the left side of the Branch, the\r\n    next above is on the right, and so to the end, not sprouting by pairs.\r\n\r\n    At the end of each Sprout are generally four sprigs, two at the\r\n    Extremity, and one on each side, just under it. At the first sprouting\r\n    of these from the Branch to the Sprig where the leaves grow, they are\r\n    full of little short white hairs, which wear off as the leaves grow,\r\n    and then they are smooth as the Branch.\r\n\r\n    Upon each of these sprigs, are, for the most part, eleven pair of\r\n    leaves, neatly set into the uppermost part of the little sprig, exactly\r\n    one against another, as it were in little _articulations_, such as\r\n    Anatomists call _Enarthrosis_, where the round head of a Bone is\r\n    received into another fitted for its motion; and standing very fitly to\r\n    shut themselves and touch, the pairs just above them closing somewhat\r\n    upon them, as in the shut sprig; so is the little round _Pedunculus_ of\r\n    this leaf fitted into a little cavity of the sprig, visible to the eye\r\n    in a sprig new pluck’d, or in a sprig withered on the Branch, from\r\n    which the leaves easily fall by touching.\r\n\r\n    The leaf being almost an oblong square, and set into the _Pedunculus_,\r\n    at one of the lower corners, receiveth from that not onely a _Spine_,\r\n    as I may call it, which, passing through the leaf, divides it so\r\n    length-ways that the outer-side is broader then the inner next the\r\n    sprig, but little _fibres_ passing obliquely towards the opposite\r\n    broader side, seem to make it here a little muscular, and fitted to\r\n    move the whole leaf, which, together with the whole sprig, are set full\r\n    with little short whitish hairs.\r\n\r\n    One of these Plants, whose branch seem’d to be older and more grown\r\n    then the other, onely the tender Sprouts of it, after the leaves are\r\n    shut, fall and hang down; of the other, the whole branches fall to the\r\n    ground, if the Sun shine very warm, upon the first taking off the\r\n    Glass, which I therefore call the _humble Plant_.\r\n\r\n    The other two, which do never fall, nor do any of their branches flag\r\n    and hang down, shut not their leaves, but upon somewhat a hard stroke;\r\n    the stalks seem to grow up from a root, and appear more _herbaceous_,\r\n    they are round and smooth, without any prickle, the Sprouts from them\r\n    have several pairs of sprigs, with much less leaves then the other on\r\n    them, and have on each sprig generally seventeen pair.\r\n\r\n    Upon touching any of the sprigs with leaves on, all the leaves on that\r\n    sprig contracting themselves by pairs, joyned their upper superficies\r\n    close together.\r\n\r\n    Upon the dropping a drop of _Aqua fortis_ on the sprig betwixt the\r\n    leaves, ff all the leaves above shut presently, those below by pairs\r\n    successively after, and by the lower leaves of the other branches, ll,\r\n    kk, &c. and so every pair successively, with some little distance of\r\n    time betwixt, to the top of each sprig, and so they continu’d shut all\r\n    the time we were there. But I returning the next day, and several days\r\n    since, found all the leaves dilated again on two of the sprigs; but\r\n    from ff, where the _Aqua fortis_ had dropped upwards, dead and\r\n    withered; but those below on the same sprig, green, and closing upon\r\n    the touch, and are so to this day, _August_ 14.\r\n\r\n    With a pair of Scissers, as suddenly as it could be done, one of the\r\n    leaves bb was clipped off in the middle, upon which that pair, and the\r\n    pair above, closed presently, after a little interval, dd, then ee, and\r\n    so the rest of the pairs, to the bottom of the sprig, and then the\r\n    motion began in the lower pairs, ll, on the other sprigs, and so shut\r\n    them by pairs upwards, though not with such distinct distances.\r\n\r\n    Under a pretty large branch with its sprigs on, there lying a large\r\n    Shell betwixt two and three Inches below it, there was rubbed on a\r\n    strong scented oyl, after a little time all the leaves on that sprig\r\n    were shut, and so they continued all the time of our stay there, but at\r\n    my returne the next day, I found the position of the Shell alter’d, and\r\n    the leaves expanded as before, and closing upon the touch.\r\n\r\n    Upon the application of the Sun-beams by a Burning-glass, the more\r\n    _humble Plant_ fell, the other shut their leaves.\r\n\r\n    We could not so apply the smoak of _Sulpher_, as to have any visible\r\n    effect from that, at two or three times trial; but on another trial,\r\n    the smoak touching the leaves, it succeeded.\r\n\r\n    The _humble Plant_ fell upon taking off the Glass wherewith it was\r\n    covered.\r\n\r\n    Cutting off one of the little Sprouts, two or three drops of liquor\r\n    were thrust out of the part from whence that was cut, very cleer, and\r\n    pellucid, of a bright greenish colour, tasting at first a little\r\n    bitterish, but after leaving a licorish-like taste in my mouth.\r\n\r\n    Since, going two or three times when it was cold, I took the Glasses\r\n    from the more _humble Plant_, and it did not fall as formerly, but shut\r\n    its leaves onely. But coming afterwards, when the Sun shone very warm,\r\n    as soon as it was taken off, it fell as before.\r\n\r\n    Since I pluck’d off another sprig, whose leaves were all shut, and had\r\n    been so some time, thinking to observe the liquor should come from that\r\n    I had broken off, but finding none, though with pressing, to come, I,\r\n    as dexterously as I could, pull’d off one whose leaves were expanded,\r\n    and then had upon the shutting of the leaves, a little of the mention’d\r\n    liquor, from the end of the sprig I had broken from the Plant. And this\r\n    twice successively, as often almost as I durst rob the Plant.\r\n\r\n    But my curiosity carrying me yet further, I cut off one of the harder\r\n    branches of the stronger Plant, and there came of the liquor, both from\r\n    that I had cut, and that I had cut it from, without pressure.\r\n\r\n    Which made me think, that the motion of this Plant upon touching, might\r\n    be from this, that there being a constant _intercourse_ betwixt every\r\n    part of this Plant and its root, either by a _circulation_ of this\r\n    liquor, or a constant pressing of the subtiler parts of it to every\r\n    extremity of the Plant. Upon every pressure, from whatsoever it\r\n    proceeds, greater then that which keeps it up, the subtile parts of\r\n    this liquor are thrust downwards, towards its _articulations_ of the\r\n    leaves, where, not having room presently to get into the sprig, the\r\n    little round _pedunculus_, from whence the _Spine_ and those oblique\r\n    _Fibres_ I mentioned rise, being dilated, the _Spine_ and _Fibres_\r\n    (being continued from it) must be contracted and shortned, and so draw\r\n    the leaf upwards to joyn with its fellow in the same condition with it\r\n    self, where, being closed, they are held together by the implications\r\n    of the little whitish hair, as well as by the still retreating liquor,\r\n    which distending the _Fibres_ that are continued lower to the branch\r\n    and root, shorten them above; and when the liquor is so much forced\r\n    from the Sprout, whose _Fibres_ are yet tender, and not able to support\r\n    themselves, but by that tensness which the liquor filling their\r\n    _interstices_ gives them, the Sprout hangs and flags.\r\n\r\n    But, perhaps, he that had the ability and leisure to give you the exact\r\n    _Anatomy_ of this pretty Plant, to shew you its _Fibres_, and visible\r\n    _Canales_, through which this fine liquor circulateth, or is moved, and\r\n    had the faculty of better and more copiously expressing his\r\n    Observations and conceptions, such a one would easily from the motion\r\n    of this liquor, solve all the _Phænomena_, and would not fear to\r\n    affirm, that it is no obscure sensation this Plant hath. But I have\r\n    said too much, I humbly submit, and am ready to stand corrected.\r\n\r\nI have not yet made so full and satisfactory Observations as I desire on\r\nthis Plant, which seems to be a Subject that will afford abundance of\r\ninformation. But as farr as I have had opportunity to examine it, I have\r\ndiscovered with my _Microscope_ very curious structures and contrivances;\r\nbut designing much more accurate examinations and trials, both with my\r\n_Microscope_, and otherwise, as soon as the season will permit, I shall not\r\ntill then add any thing of what I have already taken notice of; but as farr\r\nas I have yet observ’d, I judge the motion of it to proceed from causes\r\nvery differing from those by which Gut-strings, or Lute-strings, the beard\r\nof a wilde _Oat_, or the beard of the Seeds of _Geranium_, _Moscatum_, or\r\n_Musk-grass_ and other kinds of _Cranes-bill_, move themselves. Of which I\r\nshall add more in the subsequent Observations on those bodies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XIX. _Of a _Plant_ growing in the blighted or yellow specks of\r\n_Damask-rose-leaves_, _Bramble-leaves_, and some other kind of leaves._\r\n\r\nI have for several years together, in the Moneths of _June_, _July_,\r\n_August_, and _September_ (when any of the green leaves of _Roses_ begin to\r\ndry and grow yellow) observ’d many of them, especially the leaves of the\r\nold shrubs of _Damask Roses_, all bespecked with yellow stains; and the\r\nundersides just against them, to have little yellow hillocks of a gummous\r\nsubstance, and several of them to have small black spots in the midst of\r\nthose yellow ones, which, to the naked eye, appear’d no bigger then the\r\npoint of a Pin, or the smallest black spot or tittle of Ink one is able to\r\nmake with a very sharp pointed Pen.\r\n\r\nExamining these with a _Microscope_, I was able plainly to distinguish, up\r\nand down the surface, several small yellow knobs, of a kind of yellowish\r\nred gummy substance, out of which I perceiv’d there sprung multitudes of\r\nlittle cases or black bodies like Seed-cods, and those of them that were\r\nquite without the hillock of Gumm, disclos’d themselves to grow out of it\r\nwith a small Straw-colour’d and transparent stem, the which seed and stem\r\nappear’d very like those of common Moss (which I elsewhere describe) but\r\nthat they were abundantly less, many hundreds of them being not able to\r\nequalize one single seed Cod of Moss.\r\n\r\nI have often doubted whether they were the seed Cods of some little Plant,\r\nor some kind of small Buds, or the Eggs of some very small Insect, they\r\nappear’d of a dark brownish red, some almost quite black, and of a Figure\r\nmuch resembling the seed-cod of Moss, but their stalks on which they grew\r\nwere of a very fine transparent substance, almost like the stalk of mould,\r\nbut that they seem’d somewhat more yellow.\r\n\r\nThat which makes me to suppose them to be Vegetables, is for that I\r\nperceiv’d many of those hillocks bare or destitute, as if those bodies lay\r\nyet conceal’d, as G. In others of them, they were just springing out of\r\ntheir gummy hillocks, which all seem’d to shoot directly outwards, as at A.\r\nIn others, as at B, I found them just gotten out, with very little or no\r\nstalk, and the Cods of an indifferent cize; but in others, as C, I found\r\nthem begin to have little short stalks, or stems; in others, as D, those\r\nstems were grown bigger, and larger; and in others, as at E, F, H, I, K, L,\r\n&c. those stems and Cods were grown a great deal bigger, and the stalks\r\nwere more bulky about the root, and very much taper’d towards the top, as\r\nat F and L is most visible.\r\n\r\nI did not find that any of them had any seed in them, or that any of them\r\nwere hollow, but as they grew bigger and bigger, I found those heads or\r\nCods begin to turn their tops towards their roots, in the same manner as I\r\nhad observ’d that of Moss to do; so that in all likelihood, Nature did\r\nintend in that posture, what she does in the like seed-cods of greater\r\nbulk, that is, that the seed, when ripe, should be shaken out and dispersed\r\nat the end of it, as we find in Columbine Cods, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe whole Oval OOOO in the second _Figure_ of the 12. _Scheme_ represents a\r\nsmall part of a Rose-leaf, about the bigness of the little Oval in the\r\nhillock, C, marked with the Figure X. in which I have not particularly\r\nobserv’d all the other forms of the surface of the Rose-leaf, as being\r\nlittle to my present purpose.\r\n\r\nNow, if these Cods have a seed in them so proportion’d to the Cod, as thole\r\nof _Pinks_, and _Carnations_, and _Columbines_, and the like, how\r\nunimaginably small must each of those seeds necessarily be, for the whole\r\nlength of one of the largest of those Cods was not ¹⁄₅₀₀ part of an Inch;\r\nsome not above ¹⁄₁₀₀₀, and therefore certainly, very many thousand of them\r\nwould be unable to make a bulk that should be visible to the naked eye; and\r\nif each of these contain the Rudiments of a young Plant of the same kind,\r\nwhat must we say of the pores and constituent parts of that?\r\n\r\nThe generation of this Plant seems in part, ascribable to a kind of\r\n_Mildew_ or _Blight_, whereby the parts of the leaves grow scabby, or\r\nputrify’d, as it were, so as that the moisture breaks out in little scabs\r\nor spots, which, as I said before, look like little knobs of a red gummous\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nFrom this putrify’d scab breaks out this little Vegetable; which may be\r\nsomewhat like a _Mould_ or _Moss_; and may have its _equivocal_ generation\r\nmuch after the same manner as I have supposed _Moss_ or _Mould_ to have,\r\nand to be a more simple and uncompounded kind of vegetation, which is set a\r\nmoving by the _putrefactive_ and _fermentative_ heat, joyn’d with that of\r\nthe ambient aerial, when (by the putrifaction and decay of some other parts\r\nof the vegetable, that for a while staid its progress) it is unfetter’d and\r\nleft at liberty to move in its former course, but by reason of its\r\n_regulators_, moves and acts after quite another manner then it did when a\r\n_coagent_ in the more compounded _machine_ of the more perfect Vegetable.\r\n\r\nAnd from this very same Principle, I imagine the _Misleto_ of Oaks, Thorns,\r\nAppletrees, and other Trees, to have its original: It seldom or never\r\ngrowing on any of those Trees, till they begin to wax decrepid, and decay\r\nwith age, and are pester’d with many other infirmities.\r\n\r\nHither also may be referr’d those multitudes and varieties of _Mushroms_,\r\nsuch as that, call’d _Jews-ears_, all sorts of _gray_ and _green_ Mosses,\r\n&c. which infest all kind of Trees, shrubs, and the like, especially when\r\nthey come to any bigness. And this we see to be very much the method of\r\nNature throughout its operations, _putrifactive Vegetables_ very often\r\nproducing a Vegetable of a much less compounded nature, and of a much\r\ninferiour tribe; and _putrefactive_ animal substances degenerating into\r\nsome kind of animal production of a much inferiour rank, and of a more\r\nsimple nature.\r\n\r\nThus we find the humours and substances of the body, upon _putrifaction_,\r\nto produce strange kinds of moving Vermine: _the putrifaction_ of the\r\nslimes and juices of the Stomack and Guts, produce Worms almost like\r\nEarth-worms, the Wheals in childrens hands produce a little Worm, call’d a\r\n_Wheal-worm_: The bloud and milk, and other humours, produce other kinds of\r\nWorms, at least, if we may believe what is deliver’d to us by very famous\r\nAuthors; though, I confess, I have not yet been able to discover such my\r\nself.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it may seem strange that _Vinegar_, _Meal_, musty _Casks_, &c.\r\nare observ’d to breed their differing kinds of Insects, or living\r\ncreatures, whereas they being Vegetable substances, seem to be of an\r\ninferiour kind, and so unable to produce a creature more noble, or of a\r\nmore compounded nature then they themselves are of, and so without some\r\nconcurrent seminal principle, may be thought utterly unfit for such an\r\noperation; I must add, that we cannot presently positively say, there are\r\nno animal substances, either mediately, as by the soil or fatning of the\r\nPlant from whence they sprung, or more immediately, by the real mixture or\r\ncomposition of such substances, join’d with them; or perchance some kind of\r\nInsect, in such places where such kind of _putrifying_ or _fermenting_\r\nbodies are, may, by a certain instinct of nature, eject some sort of\r\nseminal principle, which cooperating with various kinds of _putrifying_\r\nsubstances, may produce various kinds of Insects, or Animate bodies: For we\r\nfind in most sorts of those lower degrees of Animate bodies, that the\r\n_putrifying_ substances on which these Eggs, Seeds, or seminal principles\r\nare cast by the Insect, become, as it were, the _Matrices_ or Wombs that\r\nconduce very much to their generation, and may perchance also to their\r\nvariation and alteration, much after the same manner, as, by strange and\r\nunnatural copulations, several new kinds of Animals are produc’d, as\r\n_Mules_, and the like, which are usually call’d Monstrous, because a little\r\nunusual, though many of them have all their principal parts as perfectly\r\nshap’d and adapted for their peculiar uses, as any of the most perfect\r\nAnimals. If therefore the _putrifying_ body, on which any kind of seminal\r\nor vital principle chances to be cast, become somewhat more then meerly a\r\nnursing and fostering helper in the generation and production of any kind\r\nof Animate body, the more neer it approaches the true nature of a Womb, the\r\nmore power will it have on the by-blow it incloses. But of this somewhat\r\nmore in the description of the _Water-gnat_. Perhaps some more accurate\r\nEnquiries and Observations about these matters might bring the Question to\r\nsome certainty, which would be of no small concern in Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut that _putrifying_ animal substances may produce animals of an inferior\r\nkind, I see not any so very great a difficulty, but that one may, without\r\nmuch absurdity, admit: For as there may be multitudes of contrivances that\r\ngo to the making up of one compleat Animate body; so, That some of those\r\n_coadjutors_, in the perfect existence and life of it, may be vitiated, and\r\nthe life of the whole destroyed, and yet several of the constituting\r\ncontrivances remain intire, I cannot think it beyond imagination or\r\npossibility; no more then that a like accidental process, as I have\r\nelswhere hinted, may also be supposed to explicate the method of Nature in\r\nthe _Metamorphosis_ of Plants. And though the difference between a Plant\r\nand an Animal be very great, yet I have not hitherto met with any so\r\n_cogent_ an Argument, as to make me positive in affirming these two to be\r\naltogether _Heterogeneous_ and of quite differing kinds of Nature: And\r\nbesides, as there are many _Zoophyts_, and sensitive Plants (divers of\r\nwhich I have seen, which are of a middle nature, and seem to be Natures\r\ntransition from one degree to another, which may be observ’d in all her\r\nother passages, wherein she is very seldom observ’d to leap from one step\r\nto another) so have we, in some Authors, Instances of Plants turning into\r\nAnimals, and Animals into Plants, and the like; and some other very strange\r\n(because unheeded) proceedings of Nature; something of which kind may be\r\nmet with, in the description of the _Water-Gnat_, though it be not\r\naltogether so direct to the present purpose.\r\n\r\nBut to refer this Discourse of Animals to their proper places, I shall add,\r\nthat though one should suppose, or it should be prov’d by Observations;\r\nthat several of these kinds of Plants are accidentally produc’d by a casual\r\n_putrifaction_, I see not any great reason to question, but that,\r\nnotwithstanding its own production was as ’twere casual, yet it may\r\ngerminate and produce seed, and by it propagate its own, that is, a new\r\nSpecies. For we do not know, but that the Omnipotent and All-wise Creator\r\nmight as directly design the structure of such a Vegetable, or such an\r\nAnimal to be produc’d out of such or such a _putrifaction_ or change of\r\nthis or that body, towards the constitution or structure of which, he knew\r\nit necessary, or thought it fit to make it an ingredient; as that the\r\ndigestion or moderate heating of an Egg, either by the Female, or the Sun,\r\nor the heat of the Fire, or the like, should produce this or that Bird; or\r\nthat _Putrifactive_ and warm steams should, out of the blowings, as they\r\ncall them, that is, the Eggs of a Flie, produce a living Magot, and that,\r\nby degrees, be turn’d into an _Aurelia_, and that, by a longer and a\r\nproportion’d heat, be _transmuted_ into a Fly. Nor need we therefore to\r\nsuppose it the more imperfect in its kind, then the more compounded\r\nVegetable or Animal of which it is a part; for he might as compleatly\r\nfurnish it with all kinds of contrivances necessary for its own existence,\r\nand the propagation of its own Species, and yet make it a part of a more\r\ncompounded body: as a Clock-maker might make a Set of Chimes to be a part\r\nof a Clock, and yet, when the watch part or striking part are taken away,\r\nand the hindrances of its motion remov’d, this chiming part may go as\r\naccurately, and strike its tune as exactly, as if it were still a part of\r\nthe compounded _Automaton_. So, though the original cause, or seminal\r\nprinciple from which this minute Plant on Rose leaves did spring; were,\r\nbefore the corruption caus’d by the Mill-dew, a component part of the leaf\r\non which it grew, and did serve as a _coagent_ in the production and\r\nconstitution of it, yet might it be so consummate, as to produce a seed\r\nwhich might have a power of propagating the same species: the works of the\r\nCreator seeming of such an excellency, that though they are unable to help\r\nto the perfecting of the more compounded existence of the greater Plant or\r\nAnimal, they may have notwithstanding an ability of acting singly upon\r\ntheir own internal principle, so as to produce a Vegetable body, though of\r\na less compounded nature, and to proceed so farr in the method of other\r\nVegetables, as to bear flowers and seeds, which may be capable of\r\npropagating the like. So that the little cases which appear to grow on the\r\ntop of the slender stalks, may, for ought I know, though I should suppose\r\nthem to spring from the perverting of the usual course of the parent\r\nVegetable, contain a seed, which, being scatter’d on other leaves of the\r\nsame Plant, may produce a Plant of much the same kind.\r\n\r\nNor are Damask-Rose leaves the onely leaves that produce these kinds of\r\nVegetable sproutings; for I have observ’d them also in several other kinds\r\nof Rose leaves, and on the leaves of several sorts of Briers, and on\r\nBramble leaves they are oftentimes to be found in very great clusters; so\r\nthat I have found in one cluster, three, four, or five hundred of them,\r\nmaking a very conspicuous black spot or scab on the back side of the leaf.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XX. _Of _blue Mould_, and of the first Principles of Vegetation\r\narising from _Putrefaction_._\r\n\r\nThe Blue and White and several kinds of hairy mouldy spots, which are\r\nobservable upon divers kinds of _putrify’d_ bodies, whether Animal\r\nsubstances, or Vegetable, such as the skin, raw or dress’d, flesh, bloud,\r\nhumours, milk, green Cheese, &c. or rotten sappy Wood, or Herbs, Leaves,\r\nBarks, Roots, &c. of Plants, are all of them nothing else but several kinds\r\nof small and variously figur’d Mushroms, which, from convenient materials\r\nin those _putrifying_ bodies, are, by the concurrent heat of the Air,\r\nexcited to a certain kind of vegetation, which will not be unworthy our\r\nmore serious speculation and examination, as I shall by and by shew. But,\r\nfirst, I must premise a short description of this _Specimen_, which I have\r\nadded of this Tribe, in the first Figure of the XII. _Scheme_, which is\r\nnothing else but the appearance of a small white spot of hairy mould,\r\nmultitudes of which I found to bespeck & whiten over the red covers of a\r\nsmall book, which, it seems, were of Sheeps skin, that being more apt to\r\ngather mould, even in a dry and clean room, then other leathers. These\r\nspots appear’d, through a good _Microscope_, to be a very pretty shap’d\r\nVegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot out\r\nmultitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks, not exactly\r\nstreight, but a little bended with the weight of a round and white knob\r\nthat grew on the top of each of them; many of these knobs I observ’d to be\r\nvery round, and of a smooth surface, such as A, A, &c. others smooth\r\nlikewise, but a little oblong, as B; several of them a little broken, or\r\ncloven with chops at the top, as C; others flitter’d as ’twere, or flown\r\nall to pieces, as D, D. The whole substance of these pretty bodies was of a\r\nvery tender constitution, much like the substance of the softer kind of\r\ncommon white Mushroms, for by touching them with a Pin, I found them to be\r\nbrused and torn; they seem’d each of them to have a distinct root of their\r\nown; for though they grew neer together in a cluster, yet I could perceive\r\neach stem to rise out of a distinct part or pore of the Leather; some of\r\nthese were small and short, as seeming to have been but newly sprung up, of\r\nthese the balls were for the most part round, others were bigger, and\r\ntaller, as being perhaps of a longer growth, and of these, for the most\r\npart, the heads were broken, and some much wasted, as E; what these heads\r\ncontain’d I could not perceive; whether they were knobs and flowers, or\r\nseed cases, I am not able to say, but they seem’d most likely to be of the\r\nsame nature with those that grow on Mushroms, which they did, some of them,\r\nnot a little resemble.\r\n\r\nBoth their smell and taste, which are active enough to make a sensible\r\nimpression upon those organs, are unpleasant and noisome.\r\n\r\nI could not find that they would so quickly be destroy’d by the actual\r\nflame of a Candle, as at first sight of them I conceived they would be, but\r\nthey remain’d intire after I had past that part of the Leather on which\r\nthey stuck three or four times through the flame of a Candle; so that, it\r\nseems they are not very apt to take fire, no more then the common white\r\nMushroms are when they are sappy.\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of other shapes, of which these _Microscopical_\r\nMushroms are figur’d, which would have been a long Work to have described,\r\nand would not have suited so well with my design in this Treatise, onely,\r\namongst the rest, I must not forget to take notice of one that was a little\r\nlike to, or resembled, a Spunge, consisting of a multitude of little\r\nRamifications almost as that body does, which indeed seems to be a kind of\r\nWater-Mushrom, of a very pretty texture, as I else-where manifest. And a\r\nsecond, which I must not omit, because often mingled, and neer adjoining to\r\nthese I have describ’d, and this appear’d much like a Thicket of bushes, or\r\nbrambles, very much branch’d, and extended, some of them, to a great\r\nlength, in proportion to their Diameter, like creeping brambles.\r\n\r\nThe manner of the growth and formation of this kind of Vegetable, is the\r\nthird head of Enquiry, which, had I time, I should follow: the figure and\r\nmethod of Generation in this concrete seeming to me, next after the Enquiry\r\ninto the formation, figuration; or chrystalization of Salts, to be the most\r\nsimple, plain, and easie; and it seems to be a _medium_ through which he\r\nmust necessarily pass, that would with any likelihood investigate the\r\n_forma informans_ of Vegetables: for as I think that he shall find it a\r\nvery difficult task, who undertakes to discover the form of Saline\r\ncrystallizations, without the consideration and prescience of the nature\r\nand reason of a Globular form, and as difficult to explicate this\r\nconfiguration of Mushroms, without the previous consideration of the form\r\nof Salts; so will the enquiry into the forms of Vegetables be no less, if\r\nnot much more difficult, without the fore-knowledge of the forms of\r\nMushroms, these several Enquiries having no less dependance one upon\r\nanother then any select number of Propositions in Mathematical Elements may\r\nbe made to have.\r\n\r\nNor do I imagine that the skips from the one to another will be found very\r\ngreat, if beginning from fluidity, or body without any form, we descend\r\ngradually, till we arrive at the highest form of a bruite Animal’s Soul,\r\nmaking the steps or foundations of our Enquiry, _Fluidity_, _Orbiculation_,\r\n_Fixation_, _Angulization_, or _Crystallization Germination_ or\r\n_Ebullition_, _Vegetation_, _Plantanimation_, _Animation_, _Sensation_,\r\n_Imagination_.\r\n\r\nNow, that we may the better proceed in our Enquiry, It will be requisite to\r\nconsider:\r\n\r\nFirst, that Mould and Mushroms require no seminal property, but the former\r\nmay be produc’d at any time from any kind of _putrifying_ Animal, or\r\nVegetable Substance, as Flesh, &c. kept moist and warm, and the latter, if\r\nwhat _Mathiolus_ relates be true, of making them by Art, are as much within\r\nour command, of which Matter take the _Epitomie_ which Mr. _Parkinson_ has\r\ndeliver’d in his _Herbal_, in his Chapter of _Mushroms_, because I have not\r\n_Mathiolus_ now by me: _Unto these Mushroms_ (saith he) _may also be\r\nadjoyn’d those which are made of Art (whereof _Mathiolus_ makes mention)\r\nthat grow naturally among certain stones in _Naples_, and that the stones\r\nbeing digg’d up, and carried to _Rome_, and other places, where they set\r\nthem in their Wine Cellars, covering them with a little Earth, and\r\nsprinkling a little warm water thereon, would within four days produce\r\nMushroms fit to be eaten, at what time one will: As also that Mushroms may\r\nbe made to grow at the foot of a wilde _Poplar Tree_, within four days\r\nafter, warm water wherein some leaves have been dissolv’d shall be pour’d\r\ninto the Root (which must be slit) and the stock above ground._\r\n\r\nNext, that as Mushroms may be generated without seed, so does it not appear\r\nthat they have any such thing as seed in any part of them; for having\r\nconsidered several kinds of them, I could never find any thing in them that\r\nI could with any probability ghess to be the seed of it, so that it does\r\nnot as yet appear (that I know of) that Mushroms may be generated from a\r\nseed, but they rather seem to depend merely upon a convenient constitution\r\nof the matter out of which they are made, and a concurrence of either\r\nnatural or artificial heat.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that by several bodies (as Salts and Metals both in Water and in\r\nthe air, and by several kinds of sublimations in the Air) actuated and\r\nguided with a congruous heat, there may be produc’d several kinds of bodies\r\nas curiously, if not of a more compos’d Figure; several kinds of rising or\r\nEbulliating Figures seem to manifest; as witness the shooting in the\r\nRectification of spirits of _Urine_, _Hart-horn_, _Bloud_, &c. witness also\r\nthe curious branches of evaporated dissolutions, some of them against the\r\nsides of the containing Jar: others standing up, or growing an end, out of\r\nthe bottom, of which I have taken notice of a very great variety. But above\r\nall the rest, it is a very pretty kind of Germination which is afforded us\r\nin the Silver Tree, the manner of making which with Mercury and Silver, is\r\nwell known to the Chymists, in which there is an Ebullition or Germination,\r\nvery much like this of Mushroms, if I have been rightly inform’d of it.\r\n\r\nFourthly, I have very often taken notice of, and also observ’d with a\r\n_Microscope_, certain excrescencies or Ebullitions in the snuff of a\r\nCandle, which, partly from the sticking of the smoaky particles as they are\r\ncarryed upwards by the current of the rarify’d Air and flame, and partly\r\nalso from a kind of Germination or Ebullition of some actuated unctuous\r\nparts which creep along and filter through some small string of the Week,\r\nare formed into pretty round and uniform heads, very much resembling the\r\nform of hooded Mushroms, which, being by any means expos’d to the fresh\r\nAir, or that air which encompasses the flame, they are presently lick’d up\r\nand devour’d by it, and vanish.\r\n\r\nThe reason of which _Phænomenon_ seems to me, to be no other then this:\r\n\r\nThat when a convenient thread of the Week is so bent out by the sides of\r\nthe snuff that are about half an Inch or more, remov’d above the bottom, or\r\nlowest part of the flame, and that this part be wholly included in the\r\nflame; the Oyl (for the reason of filtration, which I have elsewhere\r\nrendred) being continualy driven up the snuff is driven likewise into this\r\nragged bended-end, and this being remov’d a good distance, as half an Inch\r\nor more, above the bottom of the flame, the parts of the air that passes by\r\nit, are already, almost satiated with the dissolution of the boiling\r\nunctuous steams that issued out below, and therefore are not onely glutted,\r\nthat is, can dissolve no more then what they are already acting upon, but\r\nthey carry up with them abundance of unctuous and sooty particles, which\r\nmeeting with that rag of the Week, that is plentifully fill’d with Oyl, and\r\nonely spends it as fast as it evaporates, and not at all by dissolution or\r\nburning, by means of these steamy parts of the filtrated Oyl issuing out\r\nat the sides of this ragg, and being inclos’d with an air that is already\r\nsatiated and cannot prey upon them nor burn them, the ascending sooty\r\nparticles are stay’d about it and fix’d, so as that about the end of that\r\nragg or filament of the snuff, whence the greatest part of the steams\r\nissue, there is conglobated or fix’d a round and pretty uniform cap, much\r\nresembling the head of a Mushrom, which, if it be of any great bigness, you\r\nmay observe that its underside will be bigger then that which is above the\r\nragg or stem of it; for the Oyl that is brought into it by filtration,\r\nbeing by the bulk of the cap a little shelter’d from the heat of the flame,\r\ndoes by that means issue as much out beneath from the stalk or downwards,\r\nas it does upwards, and by reason of the great access of the adventitious\r\nsmoak from beneath, it increases most that way. That this may be the true\r\nreason of this _Phænomenon_, I could produce many Arguments and Experiments\r\nto make it probable: As,\r\n\r\nFirst, that the _Filtration_ carries the Oyl to the top of the Week, at\r\nleast as high as these raggs, is visible to one that will observe the snuff\r\nof a burning Candle with a _Microscope_, where he may see an Ebullition or\r\nbubbling of the Oyl, as high as the snuff looks black.\r\n\r\nNext, that it does steam away more then burn; I could tell you of the dim\r\nburning of a Candle, the longer the snuff be which arises from the\r\nabundance of vapours out of the higher parts of it.\r\n\r\nAnd, thirdly, that in the middle of the flame of the Candle, neer the top\r\nof the snuff, the fire or dissolving principle is nothing neer so strong,\r\nas neer the bottom and out edges of the flame, which may be observ’d by the\r\nburning asunder of a thread, that will first break in those parts that the\r\nedges of the flame touch, and not in the middle.\r\n\r\nAnd I could add several Observables that I have taken notice of in the\r\nflame of a Lamp actuated with Bellows, and very many others that confirm me\r\nin my opinion, but that it is not so much to my present purpose, which is\r\nonely to consider this concreet in the snuff of a Candle, so farr as it has\r\nany resemblance of a Mushrom, to the consideration of which, that I may\r\nreturn, I say, we may also observe:\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, that the droppings or trillings of Lapidescent waters\r\nin Vaults under ground, seem to constitute a kind of _petrify’d_ body,\r\nform’d almost like some kind of Mushroms inverted, in so much that I have\r\nseen some knobb’d a little at the lower end, though for the most part,\r\nindeed they are otherwise shap’d, and taper’d towards the end; the\r\ngeneration of which seems to be from no other reason but this, that the\r\nwater by soaking through the earth and Lime (for I ghess that substance to\r\nadd much to it _petrifying_ quality) does so impregnate it self with stony\r\nparticles, that hanging in drops in the roof of the Vault, by reason that\r\nthe soaking of the water is but slow, it becomes expos’d to the Air, and\r\nthereby the outward part of the drop by degrees grows hard, by reason that\r\nthe water gradually evaporating the stony particles neer the outsides of\r\nthe drop begin to touch, and by degrees, to dry and grow closer together,\r\nand at length constitute a crust or shell about the drop; and this soaking\r\nby degrees, being more and more supply’d, the drop grows longer and longer,\r\nand the sides harden thicker and thicker into a Quill or Cane, and at\r\nlength, that hollow or pith becomes almost stop’d up, and solid: afterwards\r\nthe soaking of the _petrifying_ water, finding no longer a passage through\r\nthe middle, bursts out, and trickles down the outside, and as the water\r\nevaporates, leaves new superinduc’d shells, which more and more swell the\r\nbulk of those Iceicles, and because of the great supply from the Vault, of\r\n_petrifying_ wafer, those bodies grow bigger and bigger next to the Vault,\r\nand taper or sharpen towards the point; for the access from the arch of the\r\nVault being but very slow, and consequently the water being spread very\r\nthinly over the surface of the Iceicle, the water begins to settle before\r\nit can reach to the bottom, or corner end of it; whence, if you break one\r\nof these, you would almost imagine it a stick of Wood _petrify’d_, it\r\nhaving so pretty a resemblance of pith and grain, and if you look on the\r\noutside of a piece, or of one whole, you would think no less, both from its\r\nvegetable roundness and tapering form; but whereas all Vegetables are\r\nobserv’d to shoot and grow perpendicularly upwards, this does shoot or\r\npropend directly downwards.\r\n\r\nBy which last Observables, we see that there may be a very pretty body\r\nshap’d and concreeted by Mechanical principles, without the least shew or\r\nprobability of any other seminal _formatrix_.\r\n\r\nAnd since we find that the great reason of the _Phænomena_ of this pretty\r\n_petrifaction_, are to be reduc’d from the gravity of a fluid and pretty\r\nvolatil body impregnated with stony particles, why may not the _Phænomena_\r\nof Ebullition or Germination be in part possibly enough deduc’d from the\r\nlevity of an impregnated liquor, which therefore perpendicularly ascending\r\nby degrees, evaporates and leaves the more solid and fix’d parts behind in\r\nthe form of a Mushrom, which is yet further diversify’d and specificated by\r\nthe forms of the parts that impregnated the liquor, and compose or help to\r\nconstitute the Mushrom.\r\n\r\nThat the foremention’d Figures of growing Salts, and the Silver Tree, are\r\nfrom this principle, I could very easily manifest, but that I have not now\r\na convenient opportunity of following it, nor have I made a sufficient\r\nnumber of Experiments and Observations to propound, explicate, and prove so\r\nusefull a _Theory_ as this of Mushroms: for, though the contrary principle\r\nto that of _petrify’d_ Iceicles may be in part a cause, yet I cannot but\r\nthink, that there is somewhat a more complicated cause, though yet\r\nMechanical, and possible to be explain’d.\r\n\r\nWe therefore have further to enquire of it, what makes it to be such a\r\nliquor, and to ascend, whether the heat of the Sun and Air, or whether\r\nthat _firmentiation_ and _putrifaction_, or both together; as also\r\nwhether there be not a third or fourth; whether a Saline principle\r\nbe not a considerable agent in this business also as well as heat;\r\nwhether also a fixation, precipitation or settling of certain parts\r\nout of the aerial menstruum may not be also a considerable coadjutor\r\nin the business. Since we find that many pretty beards or _stiriæ_ of\r\nthe particles of Silver may be precipitated upon a piece of Brass put\r\ninto a _solution_ of Silver very much diluted with fair water, which\r\nlook not unlike a kind of mould or hoar upon that piece of metal; and\r\nthe hoar frost looks like a kind of mould; and whether there may not be\r\nseveral others that do concurr to the production of a Mushrom, having\r\nnot yet had sufficient time to prosecute according to my desires,\r\nI must refer this to a better opportunity of my own, or leave and\r\nrecommend it to the more diligent enquiry and examination of such as\r\ncan be masters both of leisure and conveniencies for such an Enquiry.\r\n\r\nAnd in the mean time, I must conclude, that as far as I have been able to\r\nlook into the nature of this Primary kind of life and vegetation, I cannot\r\nfind the least probable argument to perswade me there is any other\r\nconcurrent cause then such as is purely Mechanical, and that the effects or\r\nproductions are as necessary upon the concurrence of those causes as that a\r\nShip, when the Sails are hoist up, and the Rudder is set to such a\r\nposition, should, when the Wind blows, be mov’d in such a way or course to\r\nthat or t’other place; Or, as that the brused Watch, which I mention in the\r\ndescription of Moss, should, when those parts which hindred its motion were\r\nfallen away, begin to move, but after quite another manner then it did\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXI. _Of _Moss_, and several other small vegetative Substances._\r\n\r\nMoss is a Plant, that the wisest of Kings thought neither unworthy his\r\nspeculation, nor his Pen, and though amongst Plants it be in bulk one of\r\nthe smallest, yet it is not the least considerable: For, as to its shape,\r\nit may compare for the beauty of it with any Plant that grows, and bears a\r\nmuch bigger breadth; it has a root almost like a seedy Parsnep, furnish’d\r\nwith small strings and suckers, which are all of them finely branch’d, like\r\nthose of the roots of much bigger Vegetables; out of this springs the stem\r\nor body of the Plant, which is somewhat _Quadrangular_, rather then\r\n_Cylindrical_, most curiously _fluted_ or strung with small creases, which\r\nrun, for the most part, _parallel_ the whole stem; on the sides of this are\r\nclose and thick set, a multitude of fair, large, well-shap’d leaves, some\r\nof them of a rounder, others of a longer shape, according as they are\r\nyounger or older when pluck’d; as I ghess by this, that those Plants that\r\nhad the stalks growing from the top of them, had their leaves of a much\r\nlonger shape, all the surface of each side of which, is curiously cover’d\r\nwith a multitude of little oblong transparent bodies, in the manner as you\r\nsee it express’d in the leaf B, in the XIII. _Scheme_.\r\n\r\nThis Plant, when young and springing up, does much resemble a Housleek,\r\nhaving thick leaves, almost like that, and seems to be somwhat of kin to it\r\nin other particulars; also from the top of the leaves, there shoots out a\r\nsmall white and transparent hair, or thorn: This stem, in time, come to\r\nshoot out into a long, round and even stalk, which by cutting transversly,\r\nwhen dry, I manifestly found to be a stiff, hard, and hollow Cane, or Reed,\r\nwithout any kind of knot, or stop, from its bottom, where the leaves\r\nencompass’d it, to the top, on which there grows a large seed case, A,\r\ncover’d with a thin, and more whitish skin, B, terminated in a long thorny\r\ntop, which at first covers all the Case, and by degrees, as that swells,\r\nthe skin cleaves, and at length falls off, with its thorny top and all\r\n(which is a part of it) and leaves the seed Case to ripen, and by degrees,\r\nto shatter out its seed at a place underneath this cap, B, which before the\r\nseed is ripe, appears like a flat barr’d button, without any hole in the\r\nmiddle; but as it ripens, the button grows bigger, and a hole appears in\r\nthe middle of it, E, out of which, in all probability, the seed falls: For\r\nas it ripens by a provision of Nature, that end of this Case turns downward\r\nafter the same manner as the ears of Wheat and Barley usually do; and\r\nopening several of these dry red Cases, F, I found them to be quite hollow,\r\nwithout anything at all in them; whereas when I cut them asunder with a\r\nsharp Pen-knife when green, I found in the middle of this great Case,\r\nanother smaller round Case, between which two, the _interstices_ were\r\nfill’d with multitudes of stringie _fibres_, which seem’d to suspend the\r\nlesser Case in the middle of the other, which (as farr as I was able to\r\ndiscern) seem’d full of exceeding small white seeds, much like the\r\nseed-bagg in the knop of a Carnation, after the flowers have been two or\r\nthree days, or a week, fallen off; but this I could not so perfectly\r\ndiscern, and therefore cannot positively affirm it.\r\n\r\nAfter the seed was fallen away, I found both the Case, Stalk, and Plant,\r\nall grow red and wither, and from other parts of the root continually to\r\nspring new branches or slips, which by degrees increased, and grew as bigg\r\nas the former, seeded, ripen’d, shatter’d, and wither’d.\r\n\r\nI could not find that it observ’d any particular seasons for these several\r\nkinds of growth, but rather found it to be springing, mature, ripe, seedy,\r\nand wither’d at all times of the year; But I found it most to flourish and\r\nincrease in warm and moist weather.\r\n\r\nIt gathers its nourishments, for the most part, out of some _Lapidescent_,\r\nor other substance corrupted or chang’d from its former texture, or\r\nsubstantial form; for I have found it to grow on the rotten parts of Stone,\r\nof Bricks, of Wood, of Bones, of Leather, &c.\r\n\r\nIt oft grows on the barks of several Trees, spreading it self, sometimes\r\nfrom the ground upwards, and sometimes from some chink or cleft of the bark\r\nof the Tree, which has some _putrify’d_ substance in it, but this seems of\r\na distinct kind from that which I observ’d to grow on _putrify’d_ inanimate\r\nbodies, and rotten earth.\r\n\r\nThere are also great varieties of other kinds of Mosses, which grow on\r\nTrees, and several other Plants, of which I shall here make no mention, nor\r\nof the Moss growing on the skull of a dead man, which much resembles that\r\nof Trees.\r\n\r\nWhether this Plant does sometimes originally spring or rise out of\r\ncorruption, without any disseminated seed, I have not yet made trials\r\nenough to be very much, either positive or negative; for as it seems very\r\nhard to conceive how the seed should be generally dispers’d into all parts\r\nwhere there is a corruption begun, unless we may rationally suppose, that\r\nthis seed being so exceeding small, and consequently exceeding light, is\r\nthereby taken up, and carried to and fro in the Air into every place, and\r\nby the falling drops of rain is wash’d down out of it, and so dispers’d\r\ninto all places, and there onely takes root and propagates, where it finds\r\na convenient soil or matrix for it to thrive in; so if we will have it to\r\nproceed from corruption, it is not less difficult to conceive,\r\n\r\nFirst, how the corruption of any Vegetable, much less of any Stone or\r\nBrick, should be the Parent of so curiously figur’d, and so perfect a Plant\r\nas this is. But here indeed, I cannot but add, that it seems rather to be a\r\nproduct of the Rain in those bodies where it is stay’d, then of the very\r\nbodies themselves, since I have found it growing on Marble, and Flint, but\r\nalways the _Microscope_, if not the naked eye, would discover some little\r\nhole of Dirt in which it was rooted.\r\n\r\nNext, how the corruption of each of those exceedingly differing bodies\r\nshould all conspire to the production of the same Plant, that is, that\r\nStones, Bricks, Wood, or vegetable substances, and Bones, Leather, Horns,\r\nor animate substances, unless we may with some plausibleness say, that Air\r\nand Water are the coadjutors, or _menstruums_, all kinds of\r\n_putrifactions_, and that thereby the bodies (though whil’st they retain’d\r\ntheir substantial forms, were of exceeding differing natures, yet) since\r\nthey are dissolv’d and mixt into another, they may be very _Homogeneous_,\r\nthey being almost resolv’d again into Air, Water, and Earth; retaining,\r\nperhaps, one part of their vegetative faculty yet entire, which meeting\r\nwith congruous assistants, such as the heat of the Air, and the fluidity of\r\nthe Water, and such like coadjutors and conveniences, acquires a certain\r\nvegetation for a time, wholly differing perhaps from that kind of\r\nvegetation it had before.\r\n\r\nTo explain my meaning a little better by a gross Similitude:\r\n\r\nSuppose a curious piece of Clock-work, that had had several motions and\r\ncontrivances in it, which, when in order, would all have mov’d in their\r\ndesign’d methods and Periods. We will further suppose, by some means, that\r\nthis Clock comes to be broken, brused, or otherwise disordered, so that\r\nseveral parts of it being dislocated, are impeded, and so stand still, and\r\nnot onely hinder its own progressive motion, and produce not the effect\r\nwhich they were design’d for, but because the other parts also have a\r\ndependence upon them, put a stop to their motion likewise; and so the whole\r\nInstrument becomes unserviceable, and not fit for any use. This Instrument\r\nafterwards, by some shaking and tumbling, and throwing up and down, comes\r\nto have several of its parts shaken out, and several of its curious\r\nmotions, and contrivances, and particles all fallen asunder; here a Pin\r\nfalls out, and there a Pillar, and here a Wheel, and there a Hammer, and a\r\nSpring, and the like, and among the rest, away falls those parts also which\r\nwere brused and disorder’d, and had all this while impeded the motion of\r\nall the rest; hereupon several of those other motions that yet remain,\r\nwhole springs were not quite run down, being now at liberty, begin each of\r\nthem to move, thus or thus, but quite after another method then before,\r\nthere being many regulating parts and the like, fallen away and lost. Upon\r\nthis, the Owner, who chances to hear and observe some of these effects,\r\nbeing ignorant of the Watch-makers Art, wonders what is betid his Clock,\r\nand presently imagines that some Artist has been at work, and has set his\r\nClock in order, and made a new kind of Instrument of it, but upon examining\r\ncircumstances, he finds there was no such matter, but that the casual\r\nslipping out of a Pin had made several parts of his Clock fall to pieces,\r\nand that thereby the obstacle that all this while hindred his Clock,\r\ntogether with other usefull parts were fallen out, and so his Clock was set\r\nat liberty. And upon winding up those springs again when run down, he finds\r\nhis Clock to go, but quite after another manner then it was wont\r\nheretofore.\r\n\r\nAnd thus may it be perhaps in the business of Moss, and Mould, and\r\nMushroms, and several other spontaneous kinds of vegetations, which may be\r\ncaus’d by a vegetative principle, which was a coadjutor to the life and\r\ngrowth of the greater Vegetable, and was by the destroying of the life of\r\nit stopt and impeded in performing its office; but afterwards, upon a\r\nfurther corruption of several parts that had all the while impeded it, the\r\nheat of the Sun winding up, as it were, the spring, sets it again into a\r\nvegetative motion, and this being single, and not at all regulated as it\r\nwas before (when a part of that greater _machine_ the pristine vegetable)\r\nis mov’d after quite a differing manner, and produces effects very\r\ndiffering from those it did before.\r\n\r\nBut this I propound onely as a conjecture, not that I am more enclin’d to\r\nthis _Hypothesis_ then the seminal, which upon good reason I ghess to be\r\nMechanical also, as I may elsewhere more fully shew: But because I may, by\r\nthis, hint a possible way how this appearance may be solv’d; supposing we\r\nshould be driven to confess from certain Experiments and Observations made,\r\nthat such or such Vegetables were produc’d out of the corruption of\r\nanother, without any concurrent seminal principle (as I have given some\r\nreason to suppose, in the description of a _Microscopical_ Mushrome)\r\nwithout derogating at all from the infinite wisdom of the Creator. For this\r\naccidental production, as I may call it, does manifest as much, if not very\r\nmuch more, of the excellency of his contrivance as any thing in the more\r\nperfect vegetative bodies of the world, even as the accidental motion of\r\nthe _Automaton_ does make the owner see, that there was much more\r\ncontrivance in it then at first he imagin’d. But of this I have added more\r\nin the description of Mould, and the Vegetables on Rose leaves, &c. those\r\nbeing much more likely to have their original from such a cause then this\r\nwhich I have here described, in the 13. _Scheme_, which indeed I cannot\r\nconceive otherwise of, then as of a most perfect Vegetable, wanting nothing\r\nof the perfections of the most conspicuous and vastest Vegetables of the\r\nworld, and to be of a rank so high, as that it may very properly be\r\nreckon’d with the tall Cedar of _Lebanon_, as that Kingly Botanist has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWe know there may be as much curiosity of contrivance, and excellency of\r\nform in a very small Pocket-clock, that takes not up an Inch square of\r\nroom, as there may be in a Church-clock that fills a whole room; And I know\r\nnot whether all the contrivances and _Mechanisms_ requisite to a perfect\r\nVegetable, may not be crowded into an exceedingly less room then this of\r\nMoss, as I have heard of a striking Watch so small, that it serv’d for a\r\nPendant in a Ladies ear; and I have already given you the description of a\r\nPlant growing on Rose leaves, that is abundantly smaller then Moss;\r\ninsomuch, that neer 1000. of them would hardly make the bigness of one\r\nsingle Plant of Moss. And by comparing the bulk of Moss, with the bulk of\r\nthe biggest kind of Vegetable we meet with in Story (of which kind we find\r\nin some hotter climates, as _Guine_, and _Brasile_, the stock or body of\r\nsome Trees to be twenty foot in Diameter, whereas the body or stem of Moss,\r\nfor the most part, is not above one sixtieth part of an Inch) we shall find\r\nthat the bulk of the one will exceed the bulk of the other, no less then\r\n2985984 Millions, or 2985984000000, and supposing the production on a Rose\r\nleaf to be a Plant, we shall have of those _Indian_ Plants to exceed a\r\nproduction of the same Vegetable kingdom no less then 1000 times the former\r\nnumber; so prodigiously various are the works of the Creator, and so\r\nAll-sufficient is he to perform what to man would seem unpossible, they\r\nbeing both alike easie to him, even as one day, and a thousand years are to\r\nhim as one and the same time.\r\n\r\nI have taken notice of such an infinite variety of those smaller kinds of\r\nvegetations, that should I have described every one of them, they would\r\nalmost have fill’d a Volume, and prov’d bigg enough to have made a new\r\nHerbal, such multitudes are there to be found in moist hot weather,\r\nespecially in the Summer time, on all kind of putrifying substances, which,\r\nwhether they do more properly belong to the _Classis_ of _Mushrooms_, or\r\n_Moulds_, or _Mosses_, I shall not now dispute, there being some that seem\r\nmore properly of one kind, others of another, their colours and magnitudes\r\nbeing as much differing as their Figures and substances.\r\n\r\nNay, I have observ’d, that putting fair Water (whether Rain-water or\r\nPump-water, or _May-dew_ or Snow-water, it was almost all one) I have often\r\nobserv’d, I say, that this Water would, with a little standing, tarnish and\r\ncover all about the sides of the Glass that lay under water, with a lovely\r\ngreen; but though I have often endeavour’d to discover with my _Microscope_\r\nwhether this green were like Moss, or long striped Sea-weed, or any other\r\npeculiar form, yet so ill and imperfect are our _Microscopes_, that I could\r\nnot certainly discriminate any.\r\n\r\nGrowing Trees also, and any kinds of Woods, Stones, Bones, &c. that have\r\nbeen long expos’d to the Air and Rain, will be all over cover’d with a\r\ngreenish scurff, which will very much foul and green any kind of cloaths\r\nthat are rubb’d against it; viewing this, I could not certainly perceive in\r\nmany parts of it any determinate form, though in many I could perceive a\r\nBed as ’twere of young Moss, but in other parts it look’d almost like green\r\nbushes, and very confus’d, but always of what ever irregular Figures the\r\nparts appear’d of, they were always green, and seem’d to be either some\r\nVegetable, or to have some vegetating principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXII. _Of common _Sponges_, and several other _Spongie_ fibrous\r\nbodies._\r\n\r\nA Sponge is commonly reckon’d among the _Zoophyts_, or Plant Animals; and\r\nthe _texture_ of it, which the _Microscope_ discovers, seems to confirm it;\r\nfor it is of a form whereof I never observ’d any other Vegetable, and\r\nindeed, it seems impossible that any should be of it, for it consists of an\r\ninfinite number of small short _fibres_, or nervous parts, much of the same\r\nbigness, curiously jointed or contex’d together in the form of a Net, as is\r\nmore plainly manifest by the little Draught which I have added, in the\r\nthird _Figure_ of the IX. _Scheme_, of a piece of it, which you may\r\nperceive represents a confus’d heap of the fibrous parts curiously jointed\r\nand implicated. The joints are, for the most part, where three _fibres_\r\nonely meet, for I have very seldom met with any that had four.\r\n\r\nAt these joints there is no one of the three that seems to be the stock\r\nwhereon the other grow, but each of the _fibres_ are, for the most part, of\r\nan equal bigness, and seem each of them to have an equal share in the\r\njoint; the _fibres_ are all of them much about the same bigness, not\r\nsmaller towards the top of the Sponge, and bigger neerer the bottom or\r\nroot, as is usuall in Plants, the length of each between the joints, is\r\nvery irregular and different; the distance between some two joints, being\r\nten or twelve times more then between some others.\r\n\r\nNor are the joints regular, and of an _equitriagonal Figure_, but, for the\r\nmost part, the three _fibres_ so meet, that they compose three angles very\r\ndiffering all of them from one another.\r\n\r\nThe meshes likewise, and holes of this reticulated body, are not less\r\nvarious and irregular: some _bilateral_, others _trilateral_, and\r\n_quadrilateral_ Figures; nay, I have observ’d some meshes to have 5, 6, 7,\r\n8, or 9. sides, and some to have onely one, so exceeding various is the\r\n_Lusus Naturæ_ in this body.\r\n\r\nAs to the outward appearance of this Vegetative body, they are so usuall\r\neverywhere, that I need not describe them, consisting of a soft and porous\r\nsubstance, representing a Lock, sometimes a fleece of Wool; but it has\r\nbesides these small _microscopical_ pores which lie between the _fibres_, a\r\nmultitude of round pores or holes, which, from the top of it, pierce into\r\nthe body, and sometimes go quite through to the bottom.\r\n\r\nI have observ’d many of these Sponges, to have included likewise in the\r\nmidst of their fibrous contextures, pretty large friable stones, which must\r\neither have been inclos’d whil’st this Vegetable was in formation, or\r\ngenerated in those places after it was perfectly shap’d. The later of which\r\nseems the more improbable, because I did not find that any of these stony\r\nsubstances were perforated with the _fibres_ of the Sponge.\r\n\r\nI have never seen nor been enform’d of the true manner of the growing of\r\nSponges on the Rock; whether they are found to increase from little to\r\ngreat, like Vegetables, that is, part after part, or like Animals, all\r\nparts equally growing together; or whether they be _matrices_ or feed-baggs\r\nof any kind of Fishes, or some kind of watry Insect; or whether they are at\r\nany times more soft and tender, or of another nature and texture, which\r\nthings, if I knew how, I should much desire to be informed of: but from a\r\ncursory view that I at first made with my _Microscope_, and some other\r\ntrials, I supposed it to be some Animal substance cast out, and fastned\r\nupon the Rocks in the form of a froth, or _congeries_ of bubbles, like that\r\nwhich I have often observ’d on Rosemary, and other Plants (wherein is\r\nincluded a little Insect) that all the little films which divide these\r\nbubbles one from another, did presently, almost after the substance began\r\nto grow a little harder, break, and leave onely the thread behind, which\r\nmight be, as ’twere, the angle or thread between the bubbles, that the\r\ngreat holes or pores observable in these Sponges were made by the eruption\r\nof the included _Heterogeneous_ substance (whether air, or some other body,\r\nfor many other fluid bodies will do the same thing) which breaking out of\r\nthe lesser, were collected into very large bubbles, and so might make their\r\nway out of the Sponge, and in their passage might leave a round cavity; and\r\nif it were large, might carry up with it the adjacent bubbles, which may be\r\nperceiv’d at the outside of the Sponge, if it be first throughly wetted,\r\nand sufferr’d to plump itself into its natural form, or be then wrung dry,\r\nand suffer’d to expand it self again, which it will freely do whil’st\r\nmoist: for when it has thus plump’d it self into its natural shape and\r\ndimensions, ’tis obvious enough that the mouths of the larger holes have a\r\nkind of lip or rising round about them, but the other smaller pores have\r\nlittle or none. It may further be found, that each of these great pores has\r\nmany other small pores below, that are united unto it, and help to\r\nconstitute it, almost like so many rivulets or small streams that\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of a large River. Nor from this _Hypothesis_\r\nwould it have been difficult to explicate, how those little branches of\r\n_Coral_, smal _Stones_, _shells_, and the like, come to be included by\r\nthese frothy bodies: But this indeed was but a conjecture; and upon a more\r\naccurate enquiry into the form of it with the _Microscope_, it seems not to\r\nbe the true origine of them; for whereas Sponges have onely three arms\r\nwhich join together at each knot, if they had been generated from bubbles\r\nthey must have had four.\r\n\r\nBut that they are Animal Substances, the _Chymical_ examination of them\r\nseems to manifest, they affording a volatil Salt and spirit, like\r\n_Harts-Horn_, as does also their great strength and toughness, and their\r\nsmell when burn’d in the Fire or a Candle, which has a kind of fleshy sent,\r\nnot much unlike to hair. And having since examin’d several Authors\r\nconcerning them, among others; I find this account given by _Bellonius_, in\r\nthe XI. _Chap._ of his 2d Book, _De Aquatilibus_. _Spongiæ recentes_, says\r\nhe, _à siccis longe diversæ, scopulis aquæ marinæ ad duos vel tres cubitos,\r\nnonnunquam quatuor tantum digitos immersis, ut fungi arboribus adhærent,\r\nsordido quodam succo aut mucosa potius sanie ræfertæ, usque adeò fœtida,\r\nut vel eminus nauseam excitet, continetur autem iis cavernis, quas inanes\r\nin siccis & lotis Spongiis cernimus: Putris pulmonis modo nigræ\r\nconspiciuntur, verùm quæ in sublimi aquæ nascuntur multo magis opaca\r\nnigredine suffusæ sunt. Vivere quidem Spongias adhærendo _Aristoteles_\r\ncenset: absolute vero minime: sensumque aliquem habere, vel eo argumento\r\n(inquit) credantur, quod difficillime abstrahantur, nisi clanculum agatur:\r\nAtq; ad avulsoris accessum ita contrahantur, ut eas evellere difficile sit,\r\nquod idem etiam faciunt quoties flatus tempestatésque urgent. Puto autem\r\nillis succum sordidum quem supra diximus carnis loco à natura attributum\r\nfuisse: atque meatibus latioribus tanquam intestinis aut interaneis uti.\r\nCæterum pars ea quæ Spongiæ cautibus adhærent est tanquam folii petiolus, à\r\nquo veluti collum quoddam gracile incipit: quod deinde in latitudinem\r\ndiffusum capitis globum facit. Recentibus nihil est fistulosum, hæsitantque\r\ntanquam radicibus. Superne omnes propemodum meatus concreti latent: inferne\r\nverò quaterni aut quini patent, per quos eas sugere existimamus_. From\r\nwhich Description, they seem to be a kind of Plant-Animal that adheres to a\r\nRock, and these small _fibres_ or threads which we have described, seem to\r\nhave been the Vessels which (’tis very probable) were very much bigger\r\nwhil’st the _Interstitia_ were fill’d (as he affirms) with a mucous, pulpy\r\nor fleshy substance; but upon the drying were shrunk into the bigness they\r\nnow appear.\r\n\r\nThe texture of it is such, that I have not yet met with any other body in\r\nthe world that has the like, but onely one of a larger sort of Sponge\r\n(which is preserv’d in the _Museum Harveanum_ belonging to the most\r\nIllustrious and most learned Society of the _Physicians_ of _London_) which\r\nis of a horney, or rather of a _petrify’d_ substance. And of this indeed,\r\nthe texture and make is exactly the same with common Sponges, but onely\r\nthat both the holes and the _fibres_, or texture of it is exceedingly much\r\nbigger, for some of the holes were above an Inch and half over, and the\r\n_fibres_ and _texture_ of it was bigg enough to be distinguished easily\r\nwith ones eye, but conspicuously with an ordinary single _Microscope_. And\r\nthese indeed, seem’d to have been the habitation of some Animal; and\r\nexamining _Aristotle_, I find a very consonant account hereunto, namely,\r\nthat he had known a certain little Animal, call’d _Pinnothera_, like a\r\nSpider, to be bred in those caverns of a Sponge, from within which, by\r\nopening and closing those holes, he insnares and catches the little Fishes;\r\nand in another place he says, That ’tis very confidently reported, that\r\nthere are certain Moths or Worms that reside in the cavities of a Sponge,\r\nand are there nourished: Notwithstanding all which Histories, I think it\r\nwell worth the enquiring into the History and nature of a Sponge, it\r\nseeming to promise some information of the Vessels in Animal substances,\r\nwhich (by reason of the solidity of the interserted flesh that is not\r\neasily remov’d, without destroying also those interspers’d Vessels) are\r\nhitherto undiscover’d; whereas here in a Sponge, the _Parenchyma_, it\r\nseems, is but a kind of mucous gelly, which is very easily and clearly\r\nwash’d away.\r\n\r\nThe reason that makes me imagine, that there may probably be some such\r\ntexture in Animal substances, is, that examining the texture of the\r\nfilaments of tann’d Leather, I find it to be much of the same nature and\r\nstrength of a Sponge; and with my _Microscope_, I have observ’d many such\r\njoints and knobs, as I have described in Sponges, the _fibres_ also in the\r\nhollow of several sorts of Bones, after the Marrow has been remov’d, I have\r\nfound somewhat to resemble this texture, though, I confess, I never yet\r\nfound any texture exactly the same, nor any for curiosity comparable to it.\r\n\r\nThe filaments of it are much smaller then those of Silk, and through the\r\n_Microscope_ appear very neer as transparent, nay, some parts of them I\r\nhave observ’d much more.\r\n\r\nHaving examin’d also several kinds of Mushroms, I finde their texture to be\r\nsomewhat of this kind, that is, to consist of an infinite company of small\r\nfilaments, every way contex’d and woven together, so as to make a kind of\r\ncloth, and more particularly, examining a piece of Touch-wood (which is a\r\nkind _Jews-ear_, or Mushrom, growing here in _England_ also, on several\r\nsorts of Trees, such as Elders, Maples, Willows, &c. and is commonly call’d\r\nby the name of _Spunk_; but that we meet with to be sold in Shops, is\r\nbrought from beyond Seas) I found it to be made of an exceeding delicate\r\ntexture: For the substance of it feels, and looks to the naked eye, and may\r\nbe stretch’d any way, exactly like a very fine piece of _Chamois_ Leather,\r\nor wash’d Leather, but it is of somewhat a browner hew, and nothing neer so\r\nstrong; but examining it with my _Microscope_, I found it of somewhat\r\nanother make then any kind of Leather; for whereas both _Chamois_, and all\r\nother kinds of Leather I have yet view’d, consist of an infinite company of\r\nfilaments, somewhat like bushes interwoven one within another, that is, of\r\nbigger parts or stems, as it were, and smaller branchings that grow out of\r\nthem; or like a heap of Ropes ends, where each of the larger Ropes by\r\ndegrees seem to split or untwist, into many smaller Cords, and each of\r\nthose Cords into smaller Lines, and those Lines into Threads, &c. and these\r\nstrangely intangled, or interwoven one within another: The texture of this\r\nTouch-wood seems more like that of a Lock or a Fleece of Wool, for it\r\nconsists of an infinite number of small filaments, all of them, as farr as\r\nI could perceive, of the same bigness like those of a Sponge, but that the\r\n_filaments_ of this were not a twentieth part of the bigness of those of a\r\nSponge; and I could not so plainly perceive their joints, or their manner\r\nof interweaving, though, as farr as I was able to discern with that\r\n_Microscope_ I had, I suppose it to have some kind of resemblance, but the\r\njoints are nothing neer so thick, nor without much trouble visible.\r\n\r\nThe filaments I could plainly enough perceive to be even, round,\r\ncylindrical, transparent bodies, and to cross each other every way, that\r\nis, there were not more seem’d to lie _horizontally_ then _perpendicularly_\r\nand thwartway, so that it is somewhat difficult to conceive how they\r\nshould grow in that manner. By tearing off a small piece of it, and looking\r\non the ragged edge, I could among several of those _fibres_ perceive small\r\njoints, that is, one of those hairs split into two, each of the same\r\nbigness with the other out of which they seem’d to grow, but having not\r\nlately had an opportunity of examining their manner of growth, I cannot\r\npositively affirm any thing of them.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed, The swelling of Sponges upon wetting, and the rising of the\r\nWater in it above the surface of the Water that it touches, are both from\r\nthe same cause, of which an account is already given in the sixth\r\nObservation.\r\n\r\nThe substance of them indeed, has so many excellent properties, scarce to\r\nbe met with in any other body in the world, that I have often wondered that\r\nso little use is made of it, and those onely vile and sordid; certainly, if\r\nit were well consider’d, it would afford much greater conveniencies.\r\n\r\nThat use which the Divers are said to make of it, seems, if true, very\r\nstrange, but having made trial of it my self, by dipping a small piece of\r\nit in very good Sallet-oyl, and putting it in my mouth, and then keeping my\r\nmouth and nose under water, I could not find any such thing; for I was as\r\nsoon out of breath as if I had had no Sponge, nor could I fetch my breath\r\nwithout taking in water at my mouth; but I am very apt to think, that were\r\nthere a contrivance whereby the expir’d air might be forc’d to pass through\r\na wet or oyly Sponge before it were again inspir’d, it might much cleanse,\r\nand strain away from the Air divers fuliginous and other noisome steams,\r\nand the dipping of it in certain liquors might, perhaps, so renew that\r\nproperty in the Air which it loses in the Lungs, by being breath’d, that\r\none square foot of Air might last a man for respiration much longer,\r\nperhaps, then ten will now serve him of common Air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXIII. _Of the curious texture of _Sea-weeds_._\r\n\r\nFor curiosity and beauty, I have not among all the Plants or Vegetables I\r\nhave yet observ’d, seen any one comparable to this Sea-weed I have here\r\ndescrib’d, of which I am able to say very little more then what is\r\nrepresented by the second _Figure_ of the ninth _Scheme_: Namely, that it\r\nis a Plant which grows upon the Rocks under the water, and increases and\r\nspreads it self into a great tuft, which is not onely handsomely branch’d\r\ninto several leaves, but the whole surface of the Plant is cover’d over\r\nwith a most curious kind of carv’d work, which consists of a texture much\r\nresembling a Honey-comb; for the whole surface on both sides is cover’d\r\nover with a multitude of very small holes, being no bigger then so many\r\nholes made with the point of a small Pinn, and rang’d in the neatest and\r\nmost delicate order imaginable, they being plac’d in the manner of a\r\n_Quincunx_, or very much like the rows of the eyes of a Fly, the rows or\r\norders being very regular, which way soever they are observ’d: what the\r\ntexture was, as it appear’d through a pretty bigg Magnifying _Microscope_,\r\nI have here adjoin’d in the first _Figure_ of the 14. _Scheme._ which round\r\nArea ABCD represents a part of the surface about one eighth part of an Inch\r\nin Diameter: Those little holes, which to the eye look’d round, like so\r\nmany little spots, here appear’d very regularly shap’d holes, representing\r\nalmost the shape of the sole of a round toed shoe, the hinder part of\r\nwhich, is, as it were, trod on or cover’d by the toe of that next below it;\r\nthese holes seem’d wall’d about with a very thin and transparent substance,\r\nlooking of a pale straw-colour; from the edge of which, against the middle\r\nof each hole, were sprouted out four small transparent straw-colour’d\r\nThorns, which seem’d to protect and cover those cavities, from either side\r\ntwo; neer the root of this Plant, were sprouted out several small branches\r\nof a kind of bastard _Coralline_, curiously branch’d, though small.\r\n\r\nAnd to confirm this, having lately the opportunity of viewing the large\r\nPlant (if I may so call it) of a Sponge _petrify’d_, of which I made\r\nmention in the last Observation, I found, that each of the Branches or\r\nFigures of it, did, by the range of its pores, exhibit just such a texture,\r\nthe rows of pores crossing one another, much after the manner as the rows\r\nof eyes do which are describ’d in the 26. _Scheme_: _Coralline_ also, and\r\nseveral sorts of white _Coral_, I have with a _Microscope_ observ’d very\r\ncuriously shap’d. And I doubt not, but that he that shall observe these\r\nseveral kinds of Plants that grow upon Rocks, which the Sea sometimes\r\noverflows, and those heaps of others which are vomited out of it upon the\r\nshore, may find multitudes of little Plants, and other bodies, which like\r\nthis will afford very beautifull objects for the _Microscope_; and this\r\n_Specimen_ here is adjoin’d onely to excite their curiosities who have\r\nopportunity of observing to examine and collect what they find worthy their\r\nnotice; for the Sea, among terrestrial bodies, is also a _prolifick_\r\nmother, and affords as many Instances of _spontaneous_ generations as\r\neither the Air or Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXIV. _Of the surfaces of _Rosemary_, and other leaves._\r\n\r\nThis which is delineated within the circle of the second _Figure_ of the\r\n14. _Scheme_, is a small part of the back or under side of a leaf of\r\nRosemary, which I did not therefore make choice of because it had any thing\r\npeculiar which was not observable with a _Microscope_ in several other\r\nPlants, but because it exhibits at one view,\r\n\r\nFirst, a smooth and shining surface, namely, AB, which is a part of the\r\nupper side of the leaf, that by a kind of hem or doubling of the leaf\r\nappears on this side. There are multitudes of leaves, whose surfaces are\r\nlike this smooth, and as it were quilted, which look like a curious quilted\r\nbagg of green Silk, or like a Bladder, or some such pliable transparent\r\nsubstance, full stuffed out with a green juice or liquor; the surface of\r\nRue, or Herbgrass, is polish’d, and all over indented, or pitted, like the\r\nSilk-worm’s Egg, which I shall anon describe; the smooth surfaces of other\r\nPlants are otherwise quilted, Nature in this, as it were, expressing her\r\nNeedle-work, or imbroidery.\r\n\r\nNext a downy or bushy surface, such as is all the under side almost,\r\nappearing through the _Microscope_ much like a thicket of bushes, and with\r\nthis kind of Down or Hair the leaves and stalks of multitudes of Vegetables\r\nare covered; and there seems to be as great a variety in the shape, bulk,\r\nand manner of the growing of these secundary Plants, as I may call them\r\n(they being, as it were, a Plant growing out of a Plant, or somewhat like\r\nthe hairs of Animals) as there is to be found amongst small shrubs that\r\ncompose bushes; but for the most part, they consist of small transparent\r\nparts, some of which grow in the shape of small Needles or Bodkins, as on\r\nthe Thistle, Cowag-ecod and Nettle; others in the form of Cat’s claws, as\r\nin Cliders, the beards of Barley, the edges of several sorts of Grass and\r\nReeds, &c. in other, as Coltsfoot, Rose-campion, Aps, Poplar, Willow, and\r\nalmost all other downy Plants, they grow in the form of bushes very much\r\ndiversify’d in each particular Plant, That which I have before in the 19.\r\nObservation noted on Rose leaves, is of a quite differing kind, and seems\r\nindeed a real Vegetable, distinct from the leaf.\r\n\r\nThirdly, among these small bushes are observable an infinite company of\r\nsmall round Balls, exactly Globular, and very much resembling Pearls,\r\nnamely, CCCC, of these there maybe multitudes observ’d in Sage, and several\r\nother Plants, which I suppose was the reason why _Athanasius Kircher_\r\nsupposed them to be all cover’d with Spiders Eggs, or young Spiders, which\r\nindeed is nothing else but some kind of gummous exsudation, which is always\r\nmuch of the same bigness. At first sight of these, I confess, I imagin’d\r\nthat they might have been some kind of _matrices_, or nourishing\r\nreceptacles for some small Insect, just as I have found Oak-apples, and\r\nmultitudes of such other large excrescencies on the leaves and other parts\r\nof Trees and shrubs to be for Flyes, and divers other Insects, but\r\nobserving them to be there all the year, and scarce at all to change their\r\nmagnitude, that conjecture seem’d not so probable. But what ever be the use\r\nof it, it affords a very pleasant object through the _Microscope_, and may,\r\nperhaps, upon further examination, prove very luciferous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXV. _Of the stinging points and juice of _Nettles_, and some other\r\nvenomous Plants._\r\n\r\nA Nettle is a Plant so well known to every one, as to what the appearance\r\nof it is to the naked eye, that it needs no description; and there are very\r\nfew that have not felt as well as seen it; and therefore it will be no news\r\nto tell that a gentle and slight touch of the skin by a Nettle, does\r\noftentime, not onely create very sensible and acute pain, much like that of\r\na burn or scald, but often also very angry and hard swellings and\r\ninflamations of the parts, such as will presently rise, and continue swoln\r\ndivers hours. These observations, I say, are common enough; but how the\r\npain is so suddenly created, and by what means continued, augmented for a\r\ntime, and afterwards diminish’d, and at length quite exstinguish’d, has\r\nnot, that I know, been explain’d by any.\r\n\r\nAnd here we must have recourse to our _Microscope_, and that will, if\r\nalmost any part of the Plant be looked on, shew us the whole surface of it\r\nvery thick set with turn-Pikes, or sharp Needles, of the shape of those\r\nrepresented in the 15. _Scheme_ and first _Figure_ by AB, which are visible\r\nalso to the naked eye; each of which consists of two parts very distinct\r\nfor shape, and differing also in quality from one another. For the part A,\r\nis shaped very much like a round Bodkin, from B tapering till it end in a\r\nvery sharp point; it is of substance very hard and stiff, exceedingly\r\ntransparent and cleer, and, as I by many trials certainly found, is hollow\r\nfrom top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThis I found by this Experiment, I had a very convenient _Microscope_ with\r\na single Glass which drew about half an Inch, this I had fastned into a\r\nlittle frame, almost like a pair of Spectacles, which I placed before mine\r\neyes, and so holding the leaf of a Nettle at a convenient distance from my\r\neye, I did first, with the thrusting of several of these bristles into my\r\nskin, perceive that presently after I had thrust them in I felt the burning\r\npain begin; next I observ’d in divers of them, that upon thrusting my\r\nfinger against their tops, the Bodkin (if I may so call it) did not in the\r\nleast bend, but I could perceive moving up and down within it a certain\r\nliquor, which upon thrusting the Bodkin against its basis, or bagg B, I\r\ncould perceive to rise towards the top, and upon taking away my hand, I\r\ncould see it again subside, and shrink into the bagg; this I did very\r\noften, and saw this _Phænomenon_ as plain as I could ever see a parcel of\r\nwater ascend and descend in a pipe of Glass. But the basis underneath these\r\nBodkins on which they were fast, were made of a more pliable substance, and\r\nlooked almost like a little bagg of green Leather, or rather resembled the\r\nshape and surface of a wilde Cucumber, or _cucumeris asinini_, and I could\r\nplainly perceive them to be certain little baggs, bladders, or receptacles\r\nfull of water, or as I ghess, the liquor of the Plant, which was poisonous,\r\nand those small Bodkins were but the Syringe-pipes, or Glyster-pipes, which\r\nfirst made way into the skin, and then served to convey that poisonous\r\njuice, upon the pressing of those little baggs, into the interior and\r\nsensible parts of the skin, which being so discharg’d, does corrode, or, as\r\nit were, burn that part of the skin it touches; and this pain will\r\nsometimes last very long, according as the impression is made deeper or\r\nstronger.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the leaf or surface of the Nettle, have very little\r\nconsiderable, but what is common to most of these kinds of Plants, as the\r\nruggedness or indenting, and hairiness, and other roughnesses of the\r\nsurface or outside of the Plant, of which I may say more in another place.\r\nAs I shall likewise of certain little pretty cleer Balls or Apples which I\r\nhave observed to stick to the sides of these leaves, both on the upper and\r\nunder side, very much like the small Apples which I have often observ’d to\r\ngrow on the leaves of an Oak call’d _Oak-apples_ which are nothing but the\r\n_Matrices_ of an Infect, as I elsewhere shew.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing therefore is, how this Plant comes, by so slight a touch,\r\nto create so great a pain; and the reason of this seems to be nothing else,\r\nbut the corrosive penetrant liquor contain’d in the small baggs or\r\nbladders, upon which grow out those sharp Syringe-pipes, as I before noted;\r\nand very consonant to this, is the reason of the pain created by the sting\r\nof a Bee, Wasp, &c. as I elsewhere shew: For by the Dart, which is likewise\r\na pipe, is made a deep passage into the skin, and then by the anger of the\r\nFly, is his gally poisonous liquor injected; which being admitted among the\r\nsensible parts, and so mix’d with the humours or _stagnating_ juices of\r\nthat part, does create an Ebullition perhaps, or _effervescens_, as is\r\nusually observ’d in the mingling of two differing _Chymical saline_\r\nliquors, by which means the parts become swell’d, hard, and very painfull;\r\nfor thereby the nervous and sensible parts are not onely stretch’d and\r\nstrain’d beyond their natural _tone_, but are also prick’d, perhaps, or\r\ncorroded by the pungent and incongruous parts of the intruded liquor.\r\n\r\nAnd this seems to be the reason, why _Aqua fortis_, and other _saline_\r\nliquors, if they come to touch the sensitive parts, as in a cut of the\r\nskin, or the like, do so violently and intollerably _excruciate_ and\r\ntorment the Patient. And ’tis not unlikely, but the Inventors of that\r\nDiabolical practice of poisoning the points of Arrows and Ponyards, might\r\nreceive their first hint from some such Instance in natural contrivances,\r\nas this of the Nettle: for the ground why such poison’d weapons kill so\r\ninfallibly as they do, seems no other then this of our Nettle’s stinging;\r\nfor the Ponyard or Dart makes a passage or entrance into the sensitive or\r\nvital parts of the body, whereby the contagious substance comes to be\r\ndissolv’d by, and mix’d with the fluid parts or humours of the body, and by\r\nthat means spreads it self by degrees into the whole liquid part of the\r\nbody, in the same manner, as a few grains of Salt, put into a great\r\nquantity of Water, will by degrees diffuse it self over the whole.\r\n\r\nAnd this I take to be the reason of killing of Toads, Frogs, Effs, and\r\nseveral Fishes, by strewing Salt on their backs (which Experiment was shewn\r\nto the _Royal Society_ by a very ingenious Gentleman, and a worthy Member\r\nof it) for those creatures having always a continual exsudation, as it\r\nwere, of slimy and watry parts, sweating out of the pores of their skin,\r\nthe _saline_ particles, by that means obtain a _vehicle_, which conveys\r\nthem into the internal and vital parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThis seems also to be the reason why bathing in Mineral waters are such\r\nsoveraign remedies for multitudes of distempers, especially chronical; for\r\nthe liquid & warm _vehicles_ of the Mineral particles, which are known to\r\nbe in very considerable quantities in those healing baths, by the body’s\r\nlong stay in them, do by degrees steep and insinuate themselves into the\r\npores and parts of the skin, and thereby those Mineral particles have their\r\nways and passages open’d to penetrate into the inner parts, and mingle\r\nthemselves with the _stagnant_ juices of the several parts; besides, many\r\nof those offensive parts which were united with those _stagnant_ juices,\r\nand which were contrary to the natural constitution of the parts, and so\r\nbecome irksome and painfull to the body, but could not be discharged,\r\nbecause Nature had made no provision for such accidental mischiefs, are, by\r\nmeans of this soaking, and filling the pores of the skin with a liquor,\r\nafforded a passage through that liquor that fills the pores into the\r\nambient fluid, and thereby the body comes to be discharged.\r\n\r\nSo that ’tis very evident, there may be a good as well as an evil\r\napplication of this Principle. And the ingenious Invention of that\r\nExcellent person, Doctor _Wren_ of injecting liquors into the veins of an\r\nAnimal, seems to be reducible to this head: I cannot stay, nor is this a\r\nfit place, to mention the several Experiments made of this kind by the most\r\nincomparable Mr. _Boyle_, the multitudes made by the lately mention’d\r\n_Physician_ Doctor _Clark_, the History whereof, as he has been pleas’d to\r\ncommunicate to the _Royal Society_, so he may perhaps be prevail’d with to\r\nmake publique himself: But I shall rather hint, that certainly, if this\r\nPrinciple were well consider’d, there might, besides the further improving\r\nof Bathing and Syringing into the veins, be thought on several ways,\r\nwhereby several obstinate distempers of a humane body, such as the Gout,\r\nDropsie, Stone, &c. might be master’d, and expell’d; and good men might\r\nmake as good a use of it, as evil men have made a perverse and Diabolical.\r\n\r\nAnd that the filling of the pores of the skin with some fluid _vehicle_, is\r\nof no small efficacy towards the preparing a passage for several kinds of\r\npenetrant juices, and other dissoluble bodies, to insinuate themselves\r\nwithin the skin, and into the sensitive parts of the body, may be, I think,\r\nprov’d by an Instance given us by _Bellonius_, in the 26. _Chapter_ of the\r\nsecond Book of his _Observations_, which containing a very remarkable Story\r\nI have here transcrib’d: _Cum Chamæleonis nigri radices_ (says he) _apud\r\nPagum quendam Livadochorio nuncupatum erui curaremus, plurimi Græci & Turcæ\r\nspectatum venerunt quid erueremus, eas vero frustulatim secabamus, & filo\r\ntrajiciebamus ut facilius exsiccari possent. Turcæ in eo negotio occupatos\r\nnos videntes, similiter eas radices tractare & secare voluerunt: at cum\r\nsummus esset æstus, & omnes sudore maderent, quicunque eam radicem manibus\r\ntractaverant sudoremque absterserant, aut faciem digitis scalpserant,\r\ntantam pruriginem iis locis quos attigerant postea senserunt, ut aduri\r\nviderentur. Chamæleonis enim nigri radix ea virtute pollet, ut cuti\r\napplicata ipsam adeo inflammet, ut nec squillæ, nec urticæ ullæ centesima\r\nparte ita adurent: At prurigo non adeo celeriter sese prodit. Post unam aut\r\nalteram porro horam, singuli variis faciei locis cutem adeo inflammatam\r\nhabere cæpimus ut tota sanguinea videretur, atque quo magis eam\r\nconfricabamus, tanto magis excitabatur prurigo. Fonti assidebamus sub\r\nplatano, atque initio pro ludicro habebamus & ridebamus: at tandem illi\r\nplurimum indignati sunt, & nisi asseverassemus nunquam expertos tali\r\nvirtute eam plantam pollere, haud dubie male nos multassent, Attamen nostra\r\nexcusatio fuit ab illis facilitus accepta, cum eodem incommodo nos affectos\r\nconspicerent. Mirum sane quod in tantillo radice tam ingentem efficaciam\r\nnostro malo experti sumus._\r\n\r\nBy which observation of his, it seems manifest, that their being all\r\ncover’d with sweat who gather’d and cut this root of the black _Chameleon_\r\nThistle, was the great reason why they suffer’d that inconvenience, for it\r\nseems the like circumstance had not been before that noted, nor do I find\r\nany mention of such a property belonging to this Vegetable in any of the\r\nHerbals I have at present by me.\r\n\r\nI could give very many Observations which I have made of this kind, whereby\r\nI have found that the best way to get a body to be insinuated into the\r\nsubstance or insensible pores of another, is first, to find a fluid\r\n_vehicle_ that has some congruity, both to the body to be insinuated, and\r\nto the body into whose pores you would have the other convey’d. And in this\r\nPrinciple lies the great mystery of staining several sorts of bodies, as\r\nMarble, Woods, Bones, &c. and of Dying Silks, Cloaths, Wools, Feathers, &c.\r\nBut these being digressions, I shall proceed to:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXVI. _Of _Cowage_, and the itching operation of some bodies._\r\n\r\nThere is a certain Down of a Plant, brought from the _East-Indies_, call’d\r\ncommonly, though very improperly, _Cow-itch_, the reason of which mistake\r\nis manifest enough from the description of it, which Mr. _Parkinson_ sets\r\ndown in his _Herbal_, Tribe XI. Chap. 2. _Phasiolus siliqua hirsuta; The\r\nhairy Kidney-bean, called in _Zurratte_ where it grows, Couhage: We have\r\nhad_ (says he) _another of this kind brought us out of the _East-Indies_,\r\nwhich being planted was in shew like the former, but came not to\r\nperfection, the unkindly season not suffering it to shew the flower; but of\r\nthe Cods that were brought, some were smaller, shorter, and rounder then\r\nthe Garden kind; others much longer, and many growing together, as it were\r\nin clusters, and cover’d all over with a brown short hairiness, so fine,\r\nthat if any of it be rubb’d, or fall on the back of ones hand, or other\r\ntender parts of the skin, it will cause a kind of itching, but not strong,\r\nnor long induring, but passing quickly away, without either danger or harm;\r\nthe Beans were smaller then ordinary, and of a black shining colour._\r\n\r\nHaving one of these Cods given me by a Sea-Captain, who had frequented\r\nthose parts, I found it to be a small Cod, about three Inches long, much\r\nlike a short Cod of _French Beans_, which had six Beans in it, the whole\r\nsurface of it was cover’d over with a very thick and shining brown Down or\r\nHair, which was very fine, and for its bigness stiff; taking some of this\r\nDown, and rubbing it on the back of my hand, I found very little or no\r\ntrouble, only I was sensible that several of these little downy parts with\r\nrubbing did penetrate, and were sunk, or stuck pretty deep into my skin.\r\nAfter I had thus rubb’d it for a pretty while, I felt very little or no\r\npain, in so much that I doubted, whether it were the true Couhage; but\r\nwhil’st I was considering; I found the Down begin to make my hand itch, and\r\nin some places to smart again, much like the stinging of a Flea or Gnat,\r\nand this continued a pretty while, so that by degrees I found my skin to be\r\nswell’d with little red pustules, and to look as if it had been itchie. But\r\nsuffering it without rubbing or scratching, the itching tickling pain\r\nquickly grew languid, and within an hour I felt nothing at all, and the\r\nlittle _protuberancies_ were vanish’d.\r\n\r\nThe cause of which odd _Phænomenon_, I suppose to be much the same with\r\nthat of the stinging of a Nettle, for by the _Microscope_, I discover’d\r\nthis Down to consist of a multitude of small and slender conical bodies,\r\nmuch resembling Needles or Bodkins, such as are represented by AB. CD. EF.\r\nof the first Figure of the XVI. _Scheme_; that their ends AAA, were very\r\nsharp, and the substance of them stiff and hard, much like the substance of\r\nseveral kinds of Thorns and crooks growing on Trees. And though they\r\nappear’d very cleer and transparent, yet I could not perceive whether they\r\nwere hollow or not, but to me they appear’d like solid transparent bodies,\r\nwithout any cavity in them; whether, though they might not be a kind of\r\nCane, fill’d with some transparent liquor which was hardned (because the\r\nCod which I had was very dry) I was not able to examine.\r\n\r\nNow, being such stiff, sharp bodies, it is easie to conceive, how with\r\nrubbing they might easily be thrust into the tender parts of the skin, and\r\nthere, by reason of their exceeding fineness and driness, not create any\r\nconsiderable trouble or pain, till by remaining in those places moistned\r\nwith the humours of the body, some caustick part sticking on them, or\r\nresiding within them might be dissolv’d and mix’d with the ambient juices\r\nof that place, and thereby those _fibres_ and tender parts adjoyning become\r\naffected, and as it were corroded by it; whence, while that action lasts,\r\nthe pains created are pretty sharp and pungent, though small, which is the\r\nessential property of an itching one.\r\n\r\nThat the pain also caused by the stinging of a Flea, a Gnat, a Flie, a\r\nWasp, and the like, proceeds much from the very same cause, I elsewhere in\r\ntheir proper places endeavour to manifest. The stinging also of shred\r\nHors-hair, which in meriment is often strew’d between the sheets of a Bed,\r\nseems to proceed from the same cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXVII. _Of the _Beard_ of a wilde _Oat_, and the use that may be\r\nmade of it for exhibiting always to the Eye the temperature of the Air, as\r\nto driness and moisture._\r\n\r\nThis Beard of a wild _Oat_, is a body of a very curious structure, though\r\nto the naked Eye it appears very slight, and inconsiderable, it being only\r\na small black or brown Beard or Bristle, which grows out of the side of the\r\ninner Husk that covers the Grain of a wild _Oat_; the whole length of it,\r\nwhen put in Water, so that it may extend it self to its full length, is not\r\nabove an Inch and a half, and for the most part somewhat shorter, but when\r\nthe Grain is ripe, and very dry, which is usually in the Moneths of _July_,\r\nand _August_, this Beard is bent somewhat below the middle, namely, about\r\n⅖ from the bottom of it, almost to a right Angle, and the under part of\r\nit is wreath’d lik a With; the substance of it is very brittle when dry,\r\nand it will very easily be broken from the husk on which it grows.\r\n\r\nIf you take one of these Grains, and wet the Beard in Water, you will\r\npresently see the small bended top to turn and move round, as if it were\r\nsensible; and by degrees, if it be continued wet enough, the joint or knee\r\nwill streighten it self; and if it be suffer’d to dry again, it will by\r\ndegrees move round another way, and at length bend again into its former\r\nposture.\r\n\r\nIf it be view’d with an ordinary single _Microscope_, it will appear like a\r\nsmall wreath’d Sprig, with two clefts; and if wet as before, and then\r\nlook’d on with this _Microscope_, it will appear to unwreath it self, and\r\nby degrees, to streighten its knee, and the two clefts will become\r\nstreight, and almost on opposite sides of the small cylindrical body.\r\n\r\nIf it be continued to be look’d on a little longer with a _Microscope_, it\r\nwill within a little while begin to wreath it self again, and soon after\r\nreturn to its former posture, bending it self again neer the middle, into a\r\nkind of knee or angle.\r\n\r\nSeveral of those bodies I examin’d with larger _Microscopes_, and there\r\nfound them much of the make of those two long wreath’d cylinders delineated\r\nin the second Figure of the 15. _Scheme_, which two cylinders represent the\r\nwreathed part broken into two pieces, whereof the end AB is to be suppos’d\r\nto have join’d to the end CD, so that EACF does represent the whole\r\nwreath’d part of the Beard, and EG a small piece of the upper part of the\r\nBeard which is beyond the knee, which as I had not room to insert, so was\r\nit not very considerable, either for its form, or any known property; but\r\nthe under or wreathed part is notable for both: As to its form, it\r\nappear’d, if it were look’d on side-ways, almost like a Willow, or a small\r\ntapering rod of _Hazel_, the lower or bigger half of which onely, is\r\ntwisted round several times, in some three, in others more, in others less,\r\naccording to the bigness and maturity of the Grain on which it grew, and\r\naccording to the driness and moisture of the ambient Air, as I shall shew\r\nmore at large by and by.\r\n\r\nThe whole outward Superficies of this Cylindrical body is curiously adorned\r\nor fluted with little channels, and interjacent ridges, or little\r\n_protuberances_ between them, which run the whole length of the Beard, and\r\nare streight where the Beard is not twisted, and wreath’d where it is, just\r\nafter the same manner: each of those sides is beset pretty thick with small\r\nBristes or Thorns, somewhat in form resembling that of _Porcupines_ Quills,\r\nsuch as _aaaaa_ in the Figure; all whose points are directed like so many\r\nTurn-pikes towards the small end or top of the Beard, which is the reason,\r\nwhy, if you endeavour to draw the Beard between your fingers the contrary\r\nway, you will find it to stick, and grate, as it were, against the skin.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of these small conical bodies _aaaaa_ to that whereon they\r\ngrow, the Figure will sufficiently shew, as also their manner of growing,\r\ntheir thickness, and nearness to each other, as, that towards the root or\r\nbottom of the Beard, they are more thin, and much shorter, insomuch that\r\nthere is usually left between the top of the one, and the bottom of that\r\nnext above it, more then the length of one of them, and that towards the\r\ntop of the Beard they grow more thick and close (though there be fewer\r\nridges) so that the root, and almost half the upper are hid by the tops of\r\nthose next below them.\r\n\r\nI could not perceive any _transverse_ pores, unless the whole wreath’d part\r\nwere separated and cleft, in those little channels, by the wreathing into\r\nso many little strings as there were ridges, which was very difficult to\r\ndetermine; but there were in the wreathed part two very conspicuous\r\nchannels or clefts, which were continued from the bottom F to the elbow \r\nEH or all along the part which was wreath’d, which seem’d to divide the\r\nwreath’d Cylinder into two parts, a bigger and a less; the bigger was that\r\nwhich was at the _convex_ side of the knee, namely, on the side A, and was\r\nwreath’d by OOOOO; this, as it seem’d the broader, so did it also the\r\nlonger, the other PPPPP, which was usually purs’d or wrinckled in the\r\nbending of the knee, as about E, seem’d both the shorter and narrower, so\r\nthat at first I thought the wreathing and unwreathing of the Beard might\r\nhave been caus’d by the shrinking or swelling of that part; but upon\r\nfurther examination, I found that the clefts, KK, LL, were stuft up with a\r\nkind of Spongie substance, which, for the most part, was very conspicuous\r\nneer the knee, as in the cleft KK, when the Beard was dry; upon the\r\ndiscovery of which, I began to think, that it was upon the swelling of this\r\nporous pith upon the access of moisture or water that the Beard, being made\r\nlonger in the midst, was streightned, and by the shrinking or subsiding of\r\nthe parts of that Spongie substance together, when the water or moisture\r\nwas exhal’d or dried, the pith or middle parts growing shorter, the whole\r\nbecame twisted.\r\n\r\nBut this I cannot be positive in, for upon cutting the wreath’d part in\r\nmany places transversly, I was not so well satisfy’d with the shape and\r\nmanner of the pores of the pith; for looking on these transverse Sections\r\nwith a very good _Microscope_, I found that the ends of those transverse\r\nSections appear’d much of the manner of the third Figure of the 15.\r\n_scheme_ ABCFE, and the middle of pith CC, seem’d very full of pores\r\nindeed, but all of them seem’d to run the long-ways.\r\n\r\nThis Figure plainly enough shews in what manner those clefts, K and L\r\ndivided the wreath’d Cylinder into two unequal parts, and also of what kind\r\nof substance the whole body consists; for by cutting the same Beard in many\r\nplaces, with transverse Sections, I found much the same appearance with\r\nthis express’d; so that those pores seem to run, as in most other such Cany\r\nbodies, the whole length of it.\r\n\r\nThe clefts of this body KK, and LL, seem’d (as is also express’d in the\r\nFigure) to wind very oddly in the inner part of the wreath, and in some\r\nparts of them, they seem’d stuffed, as it were, with that Spongie\r\nsubstance, which I just now described.\r\n\r\nThis so oddly constituted Vegetable substance, is first (that I have met\r\nwith) taken notice of by _Baptista Porta_, in his _Natural Magick_, as a\r\nthing known to children and Juglers, and it has been call’d by some of\r\nthose last named persons, the better to cover their cheat, the Legg of an\r\n_Arabian Spider_, or the Legg of an inchanted _Egyptian fly_, and has been\r\nused by them to make a small Index, Cross, or the like, to move round upon\r\nthe wetting of it with a drop of Water, and muttering certain words.\r\n\r\nBut the use that has been made of it, for the discovery of the various\r\nconstitutions of the Air, as to driness and moistness, is incomparably\r\nbeyond any other, for this it does to admiration: The manner of contriving\r\nit so, as to perform this great effect, is onely thus:\r\n\r\nProvide a good large Box of Ivory, about four Inches over, and of what\r\ndepth you shall judge convenient (according to your intention of making use\r\nof one, two, three, or more of these small Beards, ordered in the manner\r\nwhich I shall by and by describe) let all the sides of this Box be turned\r\nof Basket-work (which here in _London_ is easily enough procur’d) full of\r\nholes, in the manner almost of a Lettice, the bigger, or more the holes\r\nare, the better, that so the Air may have the more free passage to the\r\ninclosed Beard, and may the more easily pass through the Instrument; it\r\nwill be better yet, though not altogether so handsom, if insteed of the\r\nBasket-work on the sides of the Box, the bottom and top of the Box be\r\njoin’d together onely with three or four small Pillars, after the manner\r\nrepresented in the 4. Figure of the 15. _Scheme_. Or, if you intend to make\r\nuse of many of these small Beards join’d together, you may have a small\r\nlong Case of Ivory, whose sides are turn’d of Basket-work, full of holes,\r\nwhich may be screw’d on to the underside of a broad Plate of Ivory, on the\r\nother side of which is to be made the divided Ring or Circle, to which\r\ndivisions the pointing of the Hand or Index, which is moved by the\r\nconjoin’d Beard, may shew all the _Minute_ variations of the Air.\r\n\r\nThere may be multitudes of other ways for contriving this small Instrument,\r\nso as to produce this effect, which any one may, according to his peculiar\r\nuse, and the exigency of his present occasion, easily enough contrive and\r\ntake, on which I shall not therefore insist. The whole manner of making any\r\none of them is thus: Having your Box or frame AABB, fitly adapted for the\r\nfree passage of the Air through it, in the midst of the bottom BBB, you\r\nmust have a very small hole C, into which the lower end of the Beard is to\r\nbe fix’d, the upper end of which Beard ab, is to pass through a small hole\r\nof a Plate, or top AA, if you make use onely of a single one, and on the\r\ntop of it e, is to be fix’d a small and very light _Index_ fg, made of a\r\nvery thin sliver of a Reed or Cane; but if you make use of two or more\r\nBeards, they must be fix’d and bound together, either with a very fine\r\npiece of Silk, or with a very small touch of hard Wax, or Glew, which is\r\nbetter, and the _Index_ fg, is to be fix’d on the top of the second, third,\r\nor fourth in the same manner as on the single one.\r\n\r\nNow, because that in every of these contrivances, the _Index_ fg, will with\r\nsome temperatures of Air, move two, three, or more times round, which\r\nwithout some other contrivance then this, will be difficult to distinguish,\r\ntherefore I thought of this Expedient: The _Index_ or _Hand_ fg, being\r\nrais’d a pretty way above the surface of the Plate AA, fix in at a little\r\ndistance from the middle of it a small Pin h, so as almost to touch the\r\nsurface of the Plate AA, and then in any convenient place of the surface of\r\nthe Plate, fix a small Pin, on which put on a small piece of Paper, or thin\r\nPastboard, Vellom, or Parchment, made of a convenient cize, and shap’d in\r\nthe manner of that in the Figure express’d by ik, so that having a\r\nconvenient number of teeth every turn or return of the Pin h, may move this\r\nsmall indented Circle, a tooth forward or backwards, by which means the\r\nteeth of the Circle, being mark’d, it will be thereby very easie to know\r\ncertainly, how much variation any change of weather will make upon the\r\nsmall wreath’d body. In the making of this Secundary Circle of Vellom, or\r\nthe like, great care is to be had, that it be made exceeding light, and to\r\nmove very easily, for otherwise a small variation will spoil the whole\r\noperation. The Box may be made of Brass, Silver, Iron, or any other\r\nsubstance, if care be taken to make it open enough, to let the Air have a\r\nsufficiently free access to the Beard. The _Index_ also may be various ways\r\ncontrived, so as to shew both the number of the revolutions it makes, and\r\nthe _Minute_ divisions of each revolution.\r\n\r\nI have made several trials and Instruments for discovering the driness and\r\nmoisture of the Air with this little wreath’d body, and find it to vary\r\nexceeding sensibly with the least change in the constitution of the Air, as\r\nto driness and moisture, so that with one breathing upon it, I have made it\r\nuntwist a whole bout, and the _Index_ or _Hand_ has shew’d or pointed to\r\nvarious divisions on the upper Face or Ring of the Instrument, according as\r\nit was carried neerer and neerer to the fire, or as the heat of the Sun\r\nincreased upon it.\r\n\r\nOther trials I have made with Gut-strings, but find them nothing neer so\r\nsensible, though they also may be so contriv’d as to exhibit the changes of\r\nthe Air, as to driness and moisture, both by their stretching and shrinking\r\nin length, and also by their wreathing and unwreathing themselves; but\r\nthese are nothing neer so exact or so tender, for their varying property\r\nwill in a little time change very much. But there are several other\r\nVegetable substances that are much more sensible then even this Beard of a\r\nwilde _Oat_; such I have found the Beard of the seed of Musk-grass, or\r\n_Geranium moschatum_, and those of other kinds of _Cranes-bil_ seeds, and\r\nthe like. But always the smaller the wreathing substance be, the more\r\nsensible is it of the mutations of the Air, a conjecture at the reason of\r\nwhich I shall by and by add.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of this wreath’d Cylinder being stuck upright in a little\r\nsoft Wax, so that the bended part or _Index_ of it lay _horizontal_, I have\r\nobserv’d it always with moisture to unwreath it self from the East (For\r\ninstance) by the South to the West, and so by the North to the East again,\r\nmoving with the Sun (as we commonly say) and with heat and drouth to\r\nre-twist; and wreath it self the contrary way, namely, from the East, (for\r\ninstance) by the North to the West, and so onwards.\r\n\r\nThe cause of all which _Phænomena_, seems to be the differing texture of\r\nthe parts of these bodies, each of them (especially the Beard of a wilde\r\n_Oat_, and of _Mosk-grass_ seed) seeming to have two kind of substances,\r\none that is very porous, loose, and spongie, into which the watry steams of\r\nthe Air may be very easily forced, which will be thereby swell’d and\r\nextended in its dimensions, just as we may observe all kind of Vegetable\r\nsubstance upon steeping in water to swell and grow bigger and longer. And a\r\nsecond that is more hard and close, into which the water can very little,\r\nor not at all penetrate, this therefore retaining always very neer the same\r\ndimensions, and the other stretching and shrinking, according as there is\r\nmore or less moisture or water in its pores, by reason of the make and\r\nshape of the parts, the whole body must necessarily unwreath and wreath it\r\nself.\r\n\r\nAnd upon this Principle, it is very easie to make several sorts of\r\ncontrivances that should thus wreath and unwreath themselves, either by\r\nheat and cold, or by driness and moisture, or by any greater or less force,\r\nfrom whatever cause it proceed, whether from gravity or weight, or from\r\nwind which is motion of the Air, or from some springing body, or the like.\r\n\r\nThis, had I time, I should enlarge much more upon; for it seems to me to be\r\nthe very first footstep of _Sensation_, and Animate motion, the most plain,\r\nsimple, and obvious contrivance that Nature has made use of to produce a\r\nmotion; next to that of Rarefaction and Condensation by heat and cold. And\r\nwere this Principle very well examin’d, I am very apt to think, it would\r\nafford us a very great help to find out the _Mechanism_ of the Muscles,\r\nwhich indeed, as farr as I have hitherto been able to examine, seems to me\r\nnot so very perplex as one might imagine, especially upon the examination\r\nwhich I made of the Muscles of _Crabs_, _Lobsters_, and several sorts of\r\nlarge Shell-fish, and comparing my Observations on them, with the\r\ncircumstances I observ’d in the muscles of terrestrial Animals.\r\n\r\nNow, as in this Instance of the Beard of a wilde _Oat_, we see there is\r\nnothing else requisite to make it wreath and unwreath it self, and to\r\nstreighten and bend its knee, then onely a little breath of moist or dry\r\nAir, or a small _atome_ almost of water or liquor, and a little heat to\r\nmake it again evaporate, for, by holding this Beard, plac’d and fix’d as I\r\nbefore directed, neer a Fire, and dipping the tip of a small shred of Paper\r\nin well rectify’d spirit of Wine, and then touching the wreath’d\r\n_Cylindrical_ part, you may perceive it to untwist it self; and presently\r\nagain, upon the _avolation_ of the spirit, by the great heat, it will\r\nre-twist it self, and thus will it move forward and backwards as oft as you\r\nrepeat the touching it with the spirit of Wine; so may, perhaps, the\r\nshrinking and relaxing of the muscles be by the influx and evaporation of\r\nsome kind of liquor or juice. But of this Enquiry I shall add more\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXVIII. _Of the Seeds of _Venus_ looking-glass, or _Corn_ Violet._\r\n\r\nFrom the Leaves, and Downs, and Beards of Plants, we come at last to the\r\nSeeds; and here indeed seems to be the Cabinet of Nature, wherein are laid\r\nup its Jewels. The providence of Nature about Vegetables, is in no part\r\nmanifested more, then in the various contrivances about the seed, nor\r\nindeed is there in any part of the Vegetable so curious carvings, and\r\nbeautifull adornments, as about the seed; this in the larger sorts of seeds\r\nis most evident to the eye; nor is it lest manifest through the\r\n_Microscope_, in those seeds whose shape and structure, by reason of their\r\nsmalness, the eye is hardly able to distinguish.\r\n\r\nOf these there are multitudes, many of which I have observ’d through a\r\n_Microscope_, and find, that they do, for the most part, every one afford\r\nexceeding pleasant and beautifull objects. For besides those that have\r\nvarious kinds of carv’d surfaces, there are other that have smooth and\r\nperfectly polish’d surfaces, others a downy hairy surface; some are cover’d\r\nonely with a skin, others with a kind of shell, others with both, as is\r\nobservable also in greater seeds.\r\n\r\nOf these seeds I have onely described four sorts which may serve as a\r\n_specimen_ of what the inquisitive observers are likely to find among the\r\nrest. The first of these seeds which are described in the 17. _Scheme_, are\r\nthose of Corn-Violets, the seed is very small, black, and shining, and, to\r\nthe naked eye, looks almost like a very small Flea; But through the\r\n_Microscope_, it appears a large body, cover’d with a tough thick and\r\nbright reflecting skin very irregularly shrunk and pitted, insomuch that\r\nit is almost an impossibility to find two of them wrinkled alike, so great\r\na variety may there be even in this little seed.\r\n\r\nThis, though it appear’d one of the most promising seeds for beauty to the\r\nnaked eye, yet through the _Microscope_ it appear’d but a rude misshapen\r\nseed, which I therefore drew, that I might thereby manifest how unable we\r\nare by the naked eye to judge of beauteous or less curious _microscopical_\r\nObjects; cutting some of them in sunder, I observ’d them to be fill’d with\r\na greenish yellow pulp, and to have a very thick husk, in proportion to the\r\npulp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXIX. _Of the Seeds of _Tyme_._\r\n\r\nThese pretty fruits here represented, in the 18. _Scheme_, are nothing\r\nelse, but nine several seeds of Tyme; they are all of them in differing\r\nposture, both as to the eye and the light; nor are they all of them exactly\r\nof the same shape, there being a great variety both in the bulk and figure\r\nof each seed; but they all agreed in this, that being look’d on with a\r\n_Microscope_, they each of them exactly resembled a Lemmon or Orange dry’d;\r\nand this both in shape and colour. Some of them are a little rounder, of\r\nthe shape of an Orange, as A and B, they have each of them a very\r\nconspicuous part by which they were join’d to their little stalk, and one\r\nof them had a little piece of stalk remaining on; the opposite side of the\r\nseed, you may perceive very plainly by the Figure, is very copped and\r\nprominent, as is very usual in Lemmons; which prominencies are express’d in\r\nD, E and F.\r\n\r\nThey seem’d each of them a little creas’d or wrinckled, but E was very\r\nconspicuously furrow’d, as if the inward make of this seed had been\r\nsomewhat like that of a Lemmon also, but upon dividing several seeds with a\r\nvery sharp Pen-knife, and examining them afterward, I found their make to\r\nbe in nothing but bulk differing from that of Peas, that is, to have a\r\npretty thick coat, and all the rest an indifferent white pulp, which seem’d\r\nvery close; so that it seems Nature does not very much alter her method in\r\nthe manner of inclosing and preserving the vital Principle in the seed, in\r\nthese very small grains, from that of Beans, Peas, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Grain affords a very pretty Object for the _Microscope_, namely, a Dish\r\nof Lemmons plac’d in a very little room; should a Lemmon or Nut be\r\nproportionably magnify’d to what this seed of Tyme is, it would make it\r\nappear as bigg as a large Hay-reek and it would be no great wonder to see\r\n_Homers Iliads_, and _Homer_ and all, cramm’d into such a Nutshell. We may\r\nperceive even in these small Grains, as well as in greater, how curious and\r\ncarefull Nature is in preserving the seminal principle of Vegetable bodies,\r\nin what delicate, strong and most convenient Cabinets she lays them and\r\ncloses them in a pulp for their safer protection from outward dangers, and\r\nfor the supply of convenient alimental juice, when the heat of the Sun\r\nbegins to animate and move these little _automatons_ or Engines; as if she\r\nwould, from the ornaments wherewith she has deckt these Cabinets, hint to\r\nus, that in them she has laid up her Jewels and Master-pieces. And this, if\r\nwe are but diligent in observing, we shall find her method throughout.\r\nThere is no curiosity in the Elemental kingdom, if I may so call the bodies\r\nof Air, Water, Earth, that are comparable in form to those of Minerals, Air\r\nand Water having no form at all, unless a potentiality to be form’d into\r\nGlobules; and the clods and parcels of Earth are all irregular, whereas in\r\nMinerals she does begin to _Geometrize_, and practise, as ’twere, the first\r\nprinciples of _Mechanicks_, shaping them of plain regular figures, as\r\ntriangles, squares, &c. and _tetraedrons_, cubes, &c. But none of their\r\nforms are comparable to the more compounded ones of Vegetables; For here\r\nshe goes a step further, forming them both of more complicated shapes, and\r\nadding also multitudes of curious Mechanick contrivances in their\r\nstructure; for whereas in Vegetables there was no determinate number of the\r\nleaves or branches, nor no exactly certain figure of leaves, or flowers, or\r\nseeds, in Animals all those things are exactly defin’d and determin’d; and\r\nwhereever there is either an excess or defect of those determinate parts\r\nor limbs, there has been some impediment that has spoil’d the principle\r\nwhich was most regular: Here we shall find, not onely most curiously\r\ncompounded shapes, but most stupendious Mechanisms and contrivances, here\r\nthe ornaments are in the highest perfection, nothing in all the Vegetable\r\nkingdom that is comparable to the deckings of a Peacock; nay, to the\r\ncuriosity of any feather, as I elsewhere shew; nor to that of the smallest\r\nand most despicable Fly. But I must not stay on these speculations, though\r\nperhaps it were very well worth while for one that had leisure, to see what\r\nInformation may be learn’d of the nature, or use, or virtues of bodies, by\r\ntheir several forms and various excellencies and properties. Who knows but\r\n_Adam_ might from some such contemplation, give names to all creatures? If\r\nat least his names had any significancy in them of the creatures nature on\r\nwhich he impos’d it; as many (upon what grounds I know not) have suppos’d:\r\nAnd who knows, but the Creator may, in those characters, have written and\r\nengraven many of his most mysterious designs and counsels, and given man a\r\ncapacity, which, assisted with diligence and industry, may be able to read\r\nand understand them. But not to multiply my digression more then I can the\r\ntime, I will proceed to the next, which is,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXX. _Of the Seeds of _Poppy_._\r\n\r\nThe small seeds of Poppy, which are described in the 19. _Scheme_, both for\r\ntheir smalness, multiplicity and prettiness, as also for their admirable\r\nsoporifick quality, deserve to be taken notice of among the other\r\n_microscopical_ seeds of Vegetables: For first, though they grow in a Case\r\nor Hive oftentimes bigger then one of these Pictures of the _microscopical_\r\nappearance, yet are they for the most part so very little, that they exceed\r\nnot the bulk of a small Nitt, being not above ¹⁄₃₂ part of an Inch in\r\nDiameter, whereas the Diameter of the Hive of them oftentimes exceeds two\r\nInches, so that it is capable of containing near two hundred thousand, and\r\nso in all likelihood does contain a vast quantity, though perhaps not that\r\nnumber. Next, for their prettiness, they may be compar’d to any\r\n_microscopical_ seed I have yet seen; for they are of a dark brownish red\r\ncolour, curiously Honey-comb’d all over with a very pretty variety of\r\nNet-work, or a small kind of imbosment of very orderly rais’d ridges, the\r\nsurface of them looking not unlike the inside of a Beev’s stomack. But that\r\nwhich makes it most considerable of all, is, the medicinal virtues of it,\r\nwhich are such as are not afforded us by any Mineral preparation; and that\r\nis for the procuring of sleep, a thing as necessary to the well-being of a\r\ncreature as his meat, and that which refreshes both the voluntary and\r\nrational faculties, which, whil’st this affection has seis’d the body, are\r\nfor the most part unmov’d, and at rest. And, methinks, Nature does seem to\r\nhint some very notable virtue or excellency in this Plant from the\r\ncuriosity it has bestow’d upon it. First, in its flower, it is of the\r\nhighest scarlet-Dye, which is indeed the prime and chiefest colour, and has\r\nbeen in all Ages of the world most highly esteem’d: Next, it has as much\r\ncuriosity shew’d also in the husk or case of the seed, as any one Plant I\r\nhave yet met withall; and thirdly, the very seeds themselves, the\r\n_Microscope_ discovers to be very curiously shap’d bodies; and lastly,\r\nNature has taken such abundant care for the propagation of it, that one\r\nsingle seed grown into a Plant, is capable of bringing some hundred\r\nthousands of seeds.\r\n\r\nIt were very worthy some able man’s enquiry whether the intention of\r\nNature, as to the secundary end of Animal and Vegetable substances might\r\nnot be found out by some such characters and notable impressions as these,\r\nor from divers other circumstances, as the figure, colour, place, time of\r\nflourishing, springing and fading, duration, taste, smell, &c. For if such\r\nthere are (as an able _Physician_ upon good grounds has given me cause to\r\nbelieve) we might then, insteed of studying Herbals (where so little is\r\ndeliver’d of the virtues of a Plant, and less of truth) have recourse to\r\nthe Book of Nature it self, and there find the most natural, usefull, and\r\nmost effectual and specifick Medicines, of which we have amongst\r\nVegetables, two very noble Instances to incourage such a hope, the one of\r\nthe _Jesuite powder_ for the cure of _intermitting Feavers_, and the other\r\nof the juice of _Poppy_ for the curing the defect of sleeping.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXI. _Of _Purslane-seed_._\r\n\r\nThe Seeds of _Purslane_ seem of very notable shapes, appearing through the\r\n_Microscope_ shap’d somewhat like a _nautilus_ or _Porcelane_ shell, as may\r\nbe seen in the XX. _Scheme_, it being a small body, coyl’d round in the\r\nmanner of a Spiral, at the greater end whereof, which represents the mouth\r\nor orifice of the Shell, there is left a little white transparent\r\nsubstance, like a skin, represented by BBBB, which seems to have been the\r\nplace whereunto the stem was join’d. The whole surface of this _Coclea_ or\r\nShell, is cover’d over with abundance of little _prominencies_ or buttons\r\nvery orderly rang’d into Spiral rows, the shape of each of which seem’d\r\nmuch to resemble a Wart upon a mans hand. The order, variety, and curiosity\r\nin the shape of this little seed, makes it a very pleasant object for the\r\n_Microscope_, one of them being cut asunder with a very sharp Penknife,\r\ndiscover’d this carved Casket to be of a brownish red, and somewhat\r\ntransparent substance, and manifested the inside to be fill’d with a\r\nwhitish green substance or pulp, the Bed wherein the seminal principle lies\r\n_invelop’d_.\r\n\r\nThere are multitudes of other seeds which in shape represent or imitate the\r\nforms of divers other sorts of Shells: as the seed of _Scurvy-grass_ very\r\nmuch resembles the make of a _Concha Venerea_, a kind of Purcelane Shell;\r\nothers represent several sorts of larger fruits, sweat Marjerome and\r\nPot-marjerome represent Olives. Carret seeds are like a cleft of a Coco-Nut\r\nHusk, others are like Artificial things, as Succory seeds are like a Quiver\r\nfull of Arrows, the seeds of _Amaranthus_ are of an exceeding lovely shape,\r\nsomewhat like an Eye: The skin of the black and shrivled seeds of Onyons\r\nand Leeks, are all over knobbed like a Seals skin. Sorrel has a pretty\r\nblack shining three-square seed, which is picked at both ends with three\r\nridges, that are bent the whole length of it. It were almost endless to\r\nreckon up the several shapes, they are so many and so various; Leaving them\r\ntherefore to the curious observer, I shall proceed to the Observations on\r\nthe parts of Animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXII. _Of the Figure of several sorts of _Hair_, and of the\r\ntexture of the _skin_._\r\n\r\nViewing some of the Hairs of my Head with a very good _Microscope_, I took\r\nnotice of these particulars:\r\n\r\n1. That they were, for the most part, _Cylindrical_, some of them were\r\nsomewhat _Prismatical_, but generally they were very neer round, such as\r\nare represented in the second Figure of the 5. _Scheme_, by the _Cylinders_\r\nEEE. nor could I find any that had sharp angles.\r\n\r\n2. That that part which was next the top, was bigger then that which was\r\nneerer the root.\r\n\r\n3. That they were all along from end to end transparent, though not very\r\ncleer, the end next the root appearing like a black transparent piece of\r\nHorn, the end next the top more brown, somewhat like transparent Horn.\r\n\r\n4. That the root of the Hairs were pretty smooth, tapering inwards, almost\r\nlike a Parsneb; nor could I find that it had any filaments, or any other\r\nvessels, such as the _fibres_ of Plants.\r\n\r\n5. That the top when split (which is common in long Hair) appear’d like the\r\nend of a stick, beaten till it be all flitter’d, there being not onely two\r\nsplinters, but sometimes half a score and more.\r\n\r\n6. That they were all, as farr as I was able to find, solid _Cylindrical_\r\nbodies, not pervious, like a Cane or Bulrush; nor could I find that they\r\nhad any Pith, or distinction of Rind, or the like, such as I had observ’d\r\nin Horse-hairs, the Bristles of a Cat, the _Indian_ Deer’s Hair, &c.\r\n\r\n_Observations on several other sorts of _Hair_._\r\n\r\nFor the Brisles of a Hogg, I found them to be first a hard transparent\r\nhorny substance, without the least appearance of pores or holes in it; and\r\nthis I try’d with the greatest care I was able, cutting many of them with a\r\nvery sharp Razor, so that they appear’d, even in the Glass, to have a\r\npretty smooth surface, but somewhat waved by the sawing to and fro of the\r\nRazor, as is visible in the end of the _Prismatical_ body A of the same\r\nFigure; and then making trials with causing the light to be cast on them\r\nall the various ways I could think of, that was likely to make the pores\r\nappear, if there had been any, I was not able to discover any.\r\n\r\nNext, the Figure of the Brisles was very various, neither perfectly round,\r\nnor sharp edg’d, but _Prismatical_, with divers sides, and round angles, as\r\nappears in the Figure A. The bending of them in any part where they before\r\nappear’d cleer, would all flaw them, and make them look white.\r\n\r\nThe Mustacheos of a Cat (part of one of which is represented by the short\r\n_Cylinder_ B of the same Figure) seem’d to have, all of them that I\r\nobserv’d, a large pith in the middle, like the pith of an Elder, whose\r\ntexture was so close, that I was not able to discover the least sign of\r\npores; and those parts which seem to be pores, as they appear’d in one\r\nposition to the light, in another I could find a manifest reflection to be\r\ncast from them.\r\n\r\nThis I instance in, to hint that it is not safe to conclude any thing to be\r\npositively this or that, though it appear never so plain and likely when\r\nlook’d on with a _Microscope_ in one posture, before the same be examin’d\r\nby placing it in several other positions.\r\n\r\nAnd this I take to be the reason why many have believed and asserted the\r\nHairs of a man’s head to be hollow, and like so many small pipes perforated\r\nfrom end to end.\r\n\r\nNow, though I grant that by an _Analogie_ one may suppose them so, and from\r\nthe _Polonian_ disease one may believe them such, yet I think we have not\r\nthe least encouragement to either from the _Microscope_, much less\r\npositively to assert them such. And perhaps the very essence of the _Plica\r\nPolonica_ may be the hairs growing hollow, and of an unnatural\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the _Analogie_, though I am apt enough to think that the hairs\r\nof several Animals may be perforated somewhat like a Cane, or at least have\r\na kind of pith in them, first, because they seem as ’twere a kind of\r\nVegetable growing on an Animal, which growing, they say, remains a long\r\nwhile after the Animal is dead, and therefore should like other Vegetables\r\nhave a pith; and secondly, because Horns and Feathers, and Porcupine’s\r\nQuils, and Cats Brisles, and the long hairs of Horses, which come very\r\nneer the nature of a mans hair, seem all of them to have a kind of pith,\r\nand some of them to be porous, yet I think it not (in these cases, where we\r\nhave such helps for the sense as the _Microscope_ affords) safe concluding\r\nor building on more then we sensibly know, since we may, with examining,\r\nfind that Nature does in the make of the same kind of substance, often vary\r\nher method in framing of it: Instances enough to confirm this we may find\r\nin the Horns of several creatures: as what a vast difference is there\r\nbetween the Horns of an Oxe, and those of some sorts of Staggs as to their\r\nshape? and even in the hairs of several creatures, we find a vast\r\ndifference, as the hair of a man’s head seems, as I said before, long,\r\n_Cylindrical_ and sometime a little _Prismatical_, solid or impervious, and\r\nvery small; the hair of an _Indian_ Deer (a part of the middle of which is\r\ndescribed in the third Figure of the fifth _Scheme_, marked with F) is\r\nbigger in compass through all the middle of it, then the Bristle of an\r\nHogg, but the end of it is smaller then the hair of any kind of Animal (as\r\nmay be seen by the Figure G) the whole belly of it, which is about two or\r\nthree Inches long, looks to the eye like a thread of course Canvass, that\r\nhas been newly unwreath’d, it being all wav’d or bended to and fro, much\r\nafter that manner, but through the _Microscope_, it appears all perforated\r\nfrom side to side, and Spongie, like a small kind of spongy Coral, which is\r\noften found upon the _English_ shores; but though I cut it transversly, I\r\ncould not perceive that it had any pores that ran the long way of the hair:\r\nthe long hairs of Horses CC and D, seem _Cylindrical_ and somewhat pithy;\r\nthe Bristles of a Cat B, are conical and pithy: the Quils of Porcupines and\r\nHedghoggs, being cut transversly, have a whitish pith, in the manner of a\r\nStarr, or Spur-rowel: Piggs-hair (A) is somewhat _triagonal_, and seems to\r\nhave neither pith nor pore: And other kinds of hair have quite a differing\r\nstructure and form. And therefore I think it no way agreeable to a true\r\nnatural Historian, to pretend to be so sharp-sighted, as to see what a\r\npreconceiv’d _Hypothesis_ tells them should be there, where another man,\r\nthough perhaps as seeing, but not forestall’d, can discover no such matter.\r\n\r\nBut to proceed; I observ’d several kind of hairs that had been Dyed, and\r\nfound them to be a kind of horny _Cylinder_, being of much about the\r\ntransparency of a pretty cleer piece of Oxe horn; these appear’d quite\r\nthroughout ting’d with the colours they exhibited. And ’tis likely, that\r\nthose hairs being boyl’d or steep’d in those very hot ting’d liquors in the\r\nDye-fat, And the substance of the hair being much like that of an Oxes\r\nHorn, the penetrant liquor does so far mollifie and soften the substance,\r\nthat it sinks into the very center of it, and so the ting’d parts come to\r\nbe mix’d and united with the very body of the hair, and do not (as some\r\nhave thought) only stick on upon the outward surface. And this, the boiling\r\nof Horn will make more probable; for we shall find by that action, that the\r\nwater will insinuate it self to a pretty depth within the surface of it,\r\nespecially if this penetrancy of the water be much helped by the Salts that\r\nare usually mix’d with the Dying liquors. Now, whereas Silk may be dyed or\r\nting’d into all kind of colours without boiling or dipping into hot\r\nliquors, I ghess the reason to be two-fold: First, because the filaments,\r\nor small cylinders of Silk, are abundantly smaller and finer, and so have a\r\nmuch less depth to be penetrated then most kind of hairs; and next, because\r\nthe substance or matter of Silk, is much more like a Glew then the\r\nsubstance of Hair is. And that I have reason to suppose: First, because\r\nwhen it is spun or drawn out of the Worm, it is a perfect glutinous\r\nsubstance, and very easily sticks and cleaves to any adjacent body, as I\r\nhave several times observed, both in Silk-worms and Spiders. Next, because\r\nthat I find that water does easily dissolve and mollifie the substance\r\nagain, which is evident from their manner of ordering those bottoms or pods\r\nof the Silk-worm before they are able to unwind them. It is no great wonder\r\ntherefore, if those Dyes or ting’d liquors do very quickly mollifie and\r\ntinge the surfaces of so small and so glutinous a body. And we need not\r\nwonder that the colours appear so lovely in the one, and so dull in the\r\nother, if we view but the ting’d cylinders of both kinds with a good\r\n_Microscope_; for whereas the substance of Hair, at best, is but a dirty\r\nduskish white somewhat transparent, the filaments of Silk have a most\r\nlovely transparency and cleerness, the difference between those two being\r\nnot much less then that between a piece of Horn, and a piece of Crystal;\r\nthe one yielding a bright and vivid reflection from the concave side of the\r\ncylinder, that is, from the concave surface of the Air that incompasses the\r\nback-part of the cylinder; the other yielding a dull and perturb’d\r\nreflection from the several _Heterogeneous_ parts that compose it. And this\r\ndifference will be manifest enough to the eye, if you get a couple of small\r\nCylinders, the smaller of Crystal Glass, the other of Horn, and then\r\nvarnishing them over very thinly with some transparent colour, which will\r\nrepresent to the naked eye much the same kind of object which is\r\nrepresented to it from the filaments of Silk and Hair by the help of the\r\n_Microscope_. Now, since the threads of Silk and Serge are made up of a\r\ngreat number of these filaments, we may henceforth cease to wonder at the\r\ndifference. From much the same reason proceeds the vivid and lovely colours\r\nof Feathers, wherein they very farr exceed the natural as well as\r\nArtificial colours of hair, of which I shall say more in its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe Teguments indeed of creatures are all of them adapted to the peculiar\r\nuse and convenience of that Animal which they inwrap; and very much also\r\nfor the ornament and beauty of it, as will be most evident to any one that\r\nshall attentively consider the various kinds of cloathings wherewith most\r\ncreatures are by Nature invested and cover’d. Thus I have observed, that\r\nthe hair or furr of those Northern white Bears that inhabite the colder\r\nRegions, is exceeding thick and warm: the like have I observ’d of the hair\r\nof a _Greenland_ Deer, which being brought alive to _London_, I had the\r\nopportunity of viewing; its hair was so exceeding thick, long and soft,\r\nthat I could hardly with my hand, grasp or take hold of his skin, and it\r\nseem’d so exceeding warm, as I had never met with any before. And as for\r\nthe ornamentative use of them, it is most evident in a multitude of\r\ncreatures, not onely for colour, as the Leopards, Cats, Rhein Deer, _&c._\r\nbut for the shape, as in Horses manes, Cats beards, and several other of\r\nthe greater sort of terrestrial Animals, but is much more conspicuous, in\r\nthe Vestments of Fishes, Birds, Insects, of which I shall by and by give\r\nsome Instances.\r\n\r\nAs for the skin, the _Microscope_ discovers as great a difference between\r\nthe texture of those several kinds of Animals, as it does between their\r\nhairs; but all that I have yet taken notice of, when tann’d or dress’d, are\r\nof a Spongie nature, and seem to be constituted of an infinite company of\r\nsmall long _fibres_ or hairs, which look not unlike a heap of Tow or Okum;\r\nevery of which _fibres_ seem to have been some part of a Muscle, and\r\nprobably, whil’st the Animal was alive, might have its distinct function,\r\nand serve for the contraction and relaxation of the skin, and for the\r\nstretching and shrinking of it this or that way.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, without such a kind of texture as this, which is very like that\r\nof _Spunk_ it would seem very strange, how any body so strong as the skin\r\nof an Animal usually is, and so close as it seems, whil’st the Animal is\r\nliving, should be able to suffer so great an extension any ways, without at\r\nall hurting or dilacerating any part of it. But, since we are inform’d by\r\nthe _Microscope_, that it consists of a great many small filaments, which\r\nare implicated, or intangled one within another, almost no otherwise then\r\nthe hairs in a lock of Wool, or the flakes in a heap of Tow, though not\r\naltogether so loose, but the filaments are here and there twisted, as\r\n’twere, or interwoven, and here and there they join and unite with one\r\nanother, so as indeed the whole skin seems to be but one piece, we need not\r\nmuch wonder: And though these _fibres_ appear not through a _Microscope_\r\nexactly jointed and contex’d, as in Sponge; yet, as I formerly hinted, I am\r\napt to think, that could we find some way of discovering the texture of it,\r\nwhil’st it invests the living Animal, or had some very easie way of\r\nseparating the pulp or intercurrent juices, such as in all probability fill\r\nthose _Interstitia_, without dilacerating, brusing, or otherwise spoiling\r\nthe texture of it (as it seems to be very much by the ways of tanning and\r\ndressing now us’d) we might discover a much more curious texture then I\r\nhave hitherto been able to find; perhaps somewhat like that of Sponges.\r\n\r\nThat of _Chamoise_ Leather is indeed very much like that of _Spunk_, save\r\nonely that the _filaments_ seem nothing neer so even and round, nor\r\naltogether so small, nor has it so curious joints as _Spunk_ has, some of\r\nwhich I have lately discover’d like those of a Sponge, and perhaps all\r\nthese three bodies may be of the same kind of substance, though two of them\r\nindeed are commonly accounted Vegetable (which, whether they be so or no, I\r\nshall not now dispute) But this seems common to all three, that they\r\nundergo a tanning or dressing, whereby the interspers’d juices are wasted\r\nand wash’d away before the texture of them can be discover’d.\r\n\r\nWhat their way is of dressing, or curing Sponges, I confess, I cannot\r\nlearn; but the way of dressing _Spunk_, is, by boiling it a good while in a\r\nstrong _Lixivium_, and then beating it very well; and the manner of\r\ndressing Leather is sufficiently known.\r\n\r\nIt were indeed extremely desirable, if such a way could be found whereby\r\nthe _Parenchyma_ or flesh of the Muscles, and several other parts of the\r\nbody, might be wash’d, or wafted clean away, without vitiating the form of\r\nthe _fibrous_ parts or vessells of it, for hereby the texture of those\r\nparts, by the help of a good _Microscope_, might be most accurately found.\r\n\r\nBut to digress no further, we may, from this discovery of the _Microscope_,\r\nplainly enough understand how the skin, though it looks so close as it\r\ndoes, comes to give a passage to so vast a quantity of _excrementitious_\r\nsubstances, as the diligent _Sanctorius_ has excellently observed it to do,\r\nin his _medicina statica_; for it seems very probable, from the texture\r\nafter dressing, that there are an infinite of pores that every way pierce\r\nit, and that those pores are onely fill’d with some kind of juice, or some\r\nvery pulpy soft substance, and thereby the steams may almost as easily find\r\na passage through such a fluid _vehicle_ as the vaporous bubbles which are\r\ngenerated at the bottom of a Kettle of hot water do find a passage through\r\nthat fluid _medium_ into the ambient Air.\r\n\r\nNor is the skin of animals only thus pervious, but even those of vegetables\r\nalso seem to be the same; for otherwise I cannot conceive why, if two\r\nsprigs of Rosemary (for Instance) be taken as exactly alike in all\r\nparticulars as can be, and the one be set with the bottom in a Glass of\r\nwater, and the other be set just without the Glass, but in the Air onely,\r\nthough you stop the lower end of that in the Air very carefully with Wax,\r\nyet shall it presently almost wither, whereas the other that seems to have\r\na supply from the subjacent water by its small pipes, or _microscopical_\r\npores, preserves its greenness for many days, and sometimes weeks.\r\n\r\nNow, this to me, seems not likely to proceed from any other cause then the\r\n_avolation_ of the juice through the skin; for by the Wax, all those other\r\npores of the stem are very firmly and closely stop’d up. And from the more\r\nor less porousness of the skins or rinds of Vegetables may, perhaps, be\r\nsomewhat of the reason given, why they keep longer green, or sooner wither;\r\nfor we may observe by the bladdering and craking of the leaves of Bays,\r\nHolly, Laurel, &c. that their skins are very close, and do not suffer so\r\nfree a passage through them of the included juices.\r\n\r\nBut of this, and of the Experiment of the Rosemary, I shall elsewhere more\r\nfully consider, seeming to me an extreme luciferous Experiment, such as\r\nseems indeed very plainly to prove the _Schematism_ or structure of\r\nVegetables altogether _mechanical_, and as necessary, that (water and\r\nwarmth being apply’d to the bottom of the sprig of a Plant) some of it\r\nshould be carried upwards into the stem, and thence distributed into the\r\nleaves, as that the water of the _Thames_ covering the bottom of the Mills\r\nat the Bridge foot of _London_, and by the ebbing and flowing of it,\r\npassing strongly by them, should have some part of it convey’d to the\r\nCesterns above, and thence into several houses and Cesterns up and down the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXIII. _Of the _Scales_ of a _Soal_, and other Fishes._\r\n\r\nHaving hinted somewhat of the skin and covering of terrestrial Animals, I\r\nshall next add an Observation I made on the skin and Scales of a _Soal_, a\r\nsmall Fish, commonly enough known; and here in Fishes, as well as other\r\nAnimals, Nature follows its usual method, framing all parts so, as that\r\nthey are both usefull and ornamental in all its composures, mingling\r\n_utile_ and _dulce_ together; and both these designs it seems to follow,\r\nthough our unassisted senses are not able to perceive them: This is not\r\nonely manifest in the covering of this Fish, but in multitudes of others,\r\nwhich it would be too long to enumerate, witness particularly that small\r\nSand Shell, which I mention’d in the XI. Observation, and infinite other\r\nsmall Shells and Scales, divers of which I have view’d. This skin I view’d,\r\nwas flead from a pretty large _Soal_, and then expanded and dry’d, the\r\ninside of it, when dry, to the naked eye, look’d very like a piece of\r\nCanvass, but the _Microscope_ discover’d that texture to be nothing else,\r\nbut the inner ends of those curious Scolop’d Scales I, I, I, in the second\r\n_Figure_ of the XXI. _Scheme_, namely, the part of GGGG (of the larger\r\nrepresentation of a single Scale, in the first _Figure_ of the same\r\n_Scheme_) which on the back side, through an ordinary single Magnifying\r\nGlass, look’d not unlike the Tyles on an house.\r\n\r\nThe outside of it, to the naked eye, exhibited nothing more of ornament,\r\nsave the usual order of ranging the Scales into a _triagonal_ form, onely\r\nthe edges seem’d a little to shine, the finger being rubb’d from the\r\ntail-wards towards the head, the Scales seem’d to stay and raze it; But\r\nthrough an ordinary Magnifying glass, it exhibited a most curiously carved\r\nand adorned surface, such as is visible in the second _Figure_, each of\r\nthose (formerly almost imperceptible) Scales appearing much of the shape I,\r\nI, I, that is, they were round, and protuberant, and somewhat shap’d like a\r\nScolop, the whole Scale being creas’d with curiously wav’d and indented\r\nridges, with proportionable furrows between; each of which was terminated\r\nwith a very sharp transparent bony substance, which, like so many small\r\nTurnpikes, seem’d to arm the edges.\r\n\r\nThe back part KKK was the skin into which each of these Scales were very\r\ndeeply fix’d, in the curious regular order, visible in the second _Figure_.\r\nThe length and shape of the part of the Scale which was buried by the skin,\r\nis evidenced by the first _Figure_; which is the representation of one of\r\nthem pluck’d out and view’d through a good _Microscope_, namely, the part\r\nLFGGFL, wherein is also more plainly to be seen, the manner of carving of\r\nthe scolopt part of every particular Scale, how each ridge or barr EEE is\r\nalternately hollowed or engraven, and how every gutter between them is\r\nterminated with very transparent and hard pointed spikes, and how every\r\nother of these, as AAAA, are much longer then the interjacent ones, DDD.\r\n\r\nThe texture or form also of the hidden part appears, namely, the middle\r\npart, GGG, seems to consist of a great number of small quills or pipes, by\r\nwhich, perhaps, the whole may be nourished; and the side parts FF consist\r\nof a more fibrous texture, though indeed the whole Scale seem’d to be of a\r\nvery tough gristly substance like the larger Scales of other Fishes.\r\n\r\nThe Scales of the skin of a Dog-fish (which is us’d by such as work in\r\nWood, for the smoothing of their work, and consists plainly enough to the\r\nnaked eye, of a great number off small horny points) through the\r\n_Microscope_ appear’d each of them curiously ridg’d, and very neatly\r\ncarved; and indeed, you can hardly look on the scales of any Fish, but you\r\nmay discover abundance of curiosity and beautifying; and not only in these\r\nFishes, but in the shells and crusts or armour of most sorts of _Marine_\r\nAnimals so invested.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXIV. _Of the Sting of a Bee._\r\n\r\nThe Sting of a _Bee_, delineated in the second Figure of the XVI. _Scheme_,\r\nseems to be a weapon of offence, and is as great an Instance, that Nature\r\ndid really intend revenge as any, and that first, because there seems to be\r\nno other use of it. Secondly, by reason of its admirable shape, seeming to\r\nbe purposely shap’d for that very end. Thirdly, from the virulency of the\r\nliquor it ejects, and the sad effects and symptoms that follow it.\r\n\r\nBut whatever be the use of it, certain it is, that the structure of it is\r\nvery admirable; what it appears to the naked eye, I need not describe, the\r\nthing being known almost to every one, but it appears through the\r\n_Microscope_, to consist of two parts, the one a sheath, without a chape or\r\ntop, shap’d almost like the Holster of a Pistol, beginning at d, and ending\r\nat b, this sheath I could most plainly perceive to be hollow, and to\r\ncontain in it, both a Sword or Dart, and the poisonous liquor that causes\r\nthe pain. The sheath or case seem’d to have several joints or settings\r\ntogether, marked by fghiklmno, it was arm’d moreover neer the top, with\r\nseveral crooks or forks (pqrst) on one side, and (pqrstu) on the other,\r\neach of which seem’d like so many Thorns growing on a briar, or rather like\r\nso many Cat’s Claws; for the crooks themselves seem’d to be little sharp\r\ntransparent points or claws, growing out of little _protuberancies_ on the\r\nside of the sheath, which, by observing the Figure diligently, is easie\r\nenough to be perceiv’d; and from several particulars, I suppose the Animal\r\nhas a power of displaying them, and shutting them in again as it pleases,\r\nas a Cat does its claws, or as an Adder or Viper can its teeth or fangs.\r\n\r\nThe other part of the Sting was the Sword, as I may so call it, which is\r\nsheath’d, as it were, in it, the top of which ab appears quite through at\r\nthe smaller end, just as if the chape of the sheath of a Sword were lost,\r\nand the end of it appear’d beyond the Scabbard; the end of this Dart(a) was\r\nvery sharp, and it was arm’d likewise with the like Tenter-hooks or claws\r\nwith those of the sheath, such as (vxy, xyzz) these crooks, I am very apt\r\nto think, can be clos’d up also, or laid flat to the sides of the Sword\r\nwhen it is drawn into the Scabbard, as I have several times observ’d it to\r\nbe, and can be spred again or extended when ever the Animal pleases.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of which very pretty structure, has hinted to me, that\r\ncertainly the use of these claws seems to be very considerable, as to the\r\nmain end of this Instrument, for the drawing in, and holding the sting in\r\nthe flesh; for the point being very sharp, the top of the Sting or Dagger\r\n(ab) is very easily thrust into an Animal’s body, which being once entred,\r\nthe Bee, by endeavouring to pull it into the sheath, draws (by reason of\r\nthe crooks (vxy) and (xyzz) which lay hold of the skin on either side) the\r\ntop of the sheath (tsrv) into the skin after it, and the crooks t, s, and\r\nr, v, being entred, when the Bee endeavours to thrust out the top of the\r\nsting out of the sheath again, they lay hold of the skin on either side,\r\nand do not onely keep the sheath from sliding back, but helps the top\r\ninwards, and thus, by an alternate and successive retracting and emitting\r\nof the Sting in and out of the sheath, the little enraged creature by\r\ndegrees makes his revengfull weapon pierce the toughest and thickest Hides\r\nof his enemies, in so much that some few of these stout and resolute\r\nsoldiers with these little engines, do often put to flight a huge masty\r\nBear, one of their deadly enemies, and thereby shew the world how much more\r\nconsiderable in Warr a few skilfull Engineers and resolute soldiers\r\npolitickly order’d, that know how to manage such engines, are, then a vast\r\nunweildy rude force, that confides in, and acts onely by, its strength. But\r\n(to proceed) that he thus gets in his Sting into the skin, I conjecture,\r\nbecause, when I have observ’d this creature living, I have found it to move\r\nthe Sting thus, to and fro, and thereby also, perhaps, does, as ’twere,\r\npump or force out the poisonous liquor, and make it hang at the end of the\r\nsheath about b in a drop. The crooks, I suppose also to be the cause why\r\nthese angry creatures, hastily removing themselves from their revenge, do\r\noften leave these weapons behind them, sheath’d, as ’twere, in the flesh,\r\nand, by that means, cause the painfull symptoms to be greater, and more\r\nlasting, which are very probably caus’d, partly by the piercing and tearing\r\nof the skin by the Sting, but chiefly by the corrosive and poisonous liquor\r\nthat is by this Syringe-pipe convey’d among the sensitive parts thereof and\r\nthereby more easily gnaws and corrodes those tender _fibres_: As I have\r\nshewed in the description of a Nettle and of Cowhage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXV. _Of the contexture and shape of the particles of _Feathers_._\r\n\r\nExamining several sorts of _Feathers_, I took notice of these particulars\r\nin all sorts of wing-Feathers, especially in those which serv’d for the\r\nbeating of the air in the action of flying.\r\n\r\nThat the outward surface of the Quill and Stem was of a very hard, stiff,\r\nand horny substance, which is obvious enough, and that the part above the\r\nQuill was fill’d with a very white and light pith, and, with the\r\n_Microscope_, I found this pith to be nothing else, but a kind of natural\r\n_congeries_ of small bubbles, the films of which seem to be of the same\r\nsubstance with that of the Quill, that is, of a stiff transparent horny\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nWhich particular seems to me, very worthy a more serious consideration; For\r\nhere we may observe Nature, as ’twere, put to its shifts, to make a\r\nsubstance, which shall be both light enough, and very stiff and strong,\r\nwithout varying from its own establish’d principles, which we may observe\r\nto be such, that very strong bodies are for the most part very heavie also,\r\na strength of the parts usually requiring a density, and a density a\r\ngravity; and therefore should Nature have made a body so broad and so\r\nstrong as a Feather, almost, any other way then what it has taken, the\r\ngravity of it must necessarily have many times exceeded this; for this pith\r\nseems to be like so many stops or cross pieces in a long optical tube,\r\nwhich do very much contribute to the strength of the whole, the pores of\r\nwhich were such, as that they seem’d not to have any communication with one\r\nanother, as I have elsewhere hinted.\r\n\r\nBut the Mechanism of Nature is usually so excellent, that one and the same\r\nsubstance is adapted to serve for many ends. For the chief use of this,\r\nindeed, seems to be for the supply of nourishment to the downy or feathery\r\npart of the stem; for ’tis obvious enough in all sorts of Feathers, that\r\n’tis plac’d just under the roots of the branches that grow out of either\r\nside of the quill or stalk, and is exactly shap’d according to the ranking\r\nof those branches, coming no lower into the quill, then just the beginning\r\nof the downy branches, and growing onely on the under side of the quill\r\nwhere those branches do so. Now, in a ripe Feather (as one may call it) it\r\nseems difficult to conceive how the _Succus nutritius_ should be convey’d\r\nto this pith; for it cannot, I think, be well imagin’d to pass through the\r\nsubstance of the quill, since, having examin’d it with the greatest\r\ndiligence I was able, I could not find the least appearance of pores; but\r\nhe that shall well examine an unripe or pinn’d Feather, will plainly enough\r\nperceive the Vessel for the conveyance of it to be the thin filmy pith (as\r\n’tis call’d) which passes through the middle of the quill.\r\n\r\nAs for the make and contexture of the Down it self, it is indeed very rare\r\nand admirable, and such as I can hardly believe, that the like is to be\r\ndiscover’d in any other body in the world; for there is hardly a large\r\nFeather in the wing of a Bird, but contains neer a million of distinct\r\nparts, and every one of them shap’d in a most regular & admirable form,\r\nadapted to a particular Design: For examining a middle ciz’d Goose-quill, I\r\neasily enough found with my naked eye, that the main stem of it contain’d\r\nabout 300. longer and more Downy branchings upon one side, and as many on\r\nthe other of more stiff but somewhat shorter branchings. Many of these long\r\nand downy branchings, examining with an ordinary _Microscope_, I found\r\ndivers of them to contain neer 1200. small leaves (as I may call them, such\r\nas EF of the first Figure of the 22. _Scheme_) and as many stalks on the\r\nother side, such as IK of the same Figure, each of the leaves or\r\nbranchings, EF, seem’d to be divided into about sixteen or eighteen small\r\njoints, as may be seen plainly enough in the Figure, out of most of which\r\nthere seem to grow small long _fibres_, such as are express’d in the\r\nFigure, each of them very proportionably shap’d according to its position,\r\nor place on the stalk EF; those on the under side of it, namely, 1, 2, 3,\r\n4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &c. being much longer then those directly opposite to\r\nthem on the upper; and divers of them, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &c.\r\nwere terminated with small crooks, much resembling those small crooks,\r\nwhich are visible enough to the naked eye, in the seed-buttons of\r\nBur-docks. The stalks likewise, IK on the other side, seem’d divided into\r\nneer as many small knotted joints, but without any appearance of strings or\r\ncrooks, each of them about the middle K, seem’d divided into two parts by a\r\nkind of fork, one side of which, namely, KL, was extended neer the length\r\nof KI, the other, M, was very short.\r\n\r\nThe transverse Sections of the stems of these branchings, manifested the\r\nshape or figure of it to be much like INOE, which consisted of a horny skin\r\nor covering, and a white seemingly frothy pith, much like the make of the\r\nmain stem of a Feather.\r\n\r\nThe use of this strange kind of form, is indeed more admirable then all the\r\nrest, and such as deserves to be much more seriously examin’d and\r\nconsider’d, then I have hitherto found time or ability to do; for\r\ncertainly, it may very much instruct us in the nature of the Air,\r\nespecially as to some properties of it.\r\n\r\nThe stems of the Downy branches INOE, being rang’d in the order visible\r\nenough to the naked eye, at the distance of IF, or somewhat more, the\r\n_collateral_ stalks and leaves (if I may so call those bodies I newly\r\ndescribed) are so rang’d, that the leaves or hairy stalks of the one side\r\nlie at top, or are incumbent on the stalks of the other, and cross each\r\nother, much after the manner express’d in the second Figure of the 22.\r\n_Scheme_, by which means every of those little hooked _fibres_ of the\r\nleaved stalk get between the naked stalks, and the stalks being full of\r\nknots, and a prety way dis-join’d, so as that the _fibres_ can easily get\r\nbetween them, the two parts are so closely and admirably woven together,\r\nthat it is able to impede, for the greatest part, the transcursion of the\r\nAir; and though they are so exceeding small, as that the thickness of one\r\nof these stalks amounts not to a 500. part of an Inch, yet do they compose\r\nso strong a texture, as, notwithstanding the exceeding quick and violent\r\nbeating of them against the Air, by the strength of the Birds wing, they\r\nfirmly hold together. And it argues an admirable providence of Nature in\r\nthe contrivance and fabrick of them; for their texture is such, that though\r\nby any external injury the parts of them are violently disjoyn’d, so as\r\nthat the leaves and stalks touch not one another, and consequently several\r\nof these rents would impede the Bird’s flying; yet, for the most part, of\r\nthemselves they readily re-join and re-contex themselves, and are easily by\r\nthe Birds stroking the Feather, or drawing it through its Bill, all of them\r\nsettled and woven into their former and natural posture; for there are such\r\nan infinite company of those small _fibres_ in the under side of the\r\nleaves, and most of them have such little crooks at their ends, that they\r\nreadily catch and hold the stalks they touch.\r\n\r\nFrom which strange contexture, it seems rational to suppose that there is a\r\ncertain kind of mesh or hole so small, that the Air will not very easily\r\npass through it, as I hinted also in the sixth Observation about small\r\nGlass Canes, for otherwise it seems probable, that Nature would have drawn\r\nover some kind of thin film which should have covered all those almost\r\nsquare meshes or holes, there seeming through the _Microscope_ to be more\r\nthen half of the surface of the Feather which is open and visibly pervious;\r\nwhich conjecture will yet seem more probable from the texture of the\r\nbrushie wings of the _Tinea argentea_, or white Feather wing’d moth, which\r\nI shall anone describe. But Nature, that knows best its own laws, and the\r\nseveral properties of bodies, knows also best how to adapt and fit them to\r\nher designed ends, and whoso would know those properties, must endeavour to\r\ntrace Nature in its working, and to see what course she observes. And this\r\nI suppose will be no inconsiderable advantage which the _Schematisms_ and\r\nStructures of Animate bodies will afford the diligent enquirer, namely,\r\nmost sure and excellent instructions, both as to the practical part of\r\n_Mechanicks_ and to the _Theory_ and knowledge of the nature of the bodies\r\nand motions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXVI. _Of _Peacocks_, _Ducks_, and other _Feathers_ of   changeable\r\ncolours._\r\n\r\nThe parts of the Feathers of this glorious Bird appear, through the\r\n_Microscope_, no less gaudy then do the whole Feathers; for, as to the\r\nnaked eye ’tis evident that the stem or quill of each Feather in the tail\r\nsends out multitudes of _Lateral_ branches, such as AB in the third Figure\r\nof the 22. _Scheme_ represents a small part of about ¹⁄₃₂ part of an Inch\r\nlong, and each of the _lateral_ branches emit multitudes of little sprigs,\r\nthreads or hairs on either side of them, such as CD, CD, CD, so each of\r\nthose threads in the _Microscope_ appears a large long body, consisting of\r\na multitude of bright reflecting parts, whose Figure ’tis no easie matter\r\nto determine, as he that examines it shall find; for every new position of\r\nit to the light makes it perfectly seem of another form and shape, and\r\nnothing what it appear’d a little before; nay, it appear’d very differing\r\nofttimes from so seemingly inconsiderable a circumstance, that the\r\ninterposing of ones hand between the light and it, makes a very great\r\nchange, and the opening or shutting a Casement and the like, very much\r\ndiversifies the appearance. And though, by examining the form of it very\r\nmany ways, which would be tedious here to enumerate, I suppose I have\r\ndiscover’d the true Figure of it, yet oftentimes, upon looking on it in\r\nanother posture, I have almost thought my former observations deficient,\r\nthough indeed, upon further examination, I have found even those also to\r\nconfirm them.\r\n\r\nThese threads therefore I find to be a _congeries_ of small _Laminæ_ or\r\nplates, as eeeee, &c. each of them shap’d much like this of abcd, in the\r\nfourth _Figure_, the part ac being a ridge, prominency, or stem, and b and\r\nd the corners of two small thin Plates that grow unto the small stalk in\r\nthe middle, so that they make a kind of little feather; each of these\r\nPlates lie one close to another, almost like a company of sloping ridge or\r\ngutter Tyles; they grow on each side of the stalk opposite to one another,\r\nby two and two, from top to bottom, in the manner express’d in the fifth\r\nFigure, the tops of the lower covering the roots of the next above them;\r\nthe under side of each of these laminated bodies, is of a very dark and\r\nopacous substance, and suffers very few Rays to be trajected, but reflects\r\nthem all toward that side from whence they come, much like the foil of a\r\nLooking-glass; but their upper sides seem to me to consist of a multitude\r\nof thin plated bodies, which are exceeding thin, and lie very close\r\ntogether, and thereby, like mother of Pearl shells, do not onely reflect a\r\nvery brisk light, but tinge that light in a most curious manner; and by\r\nmeans of various positions, in respect of the light, they reflect back now\r\none colour, and then another, and those most vividly.\r\n\r\nNow, that these colours are onely _fantastical_ ones, that is, such as\r\narise immediately from the refractions of the light, I found by this, that\r\nwater wetting these colour’d parts, destroy’d their colours, which seem’d\r\nto proceed from the alteration of the reflection and refraction. Now,\r\nthough I was not able to see those hairs at all transparent by a common\r\nlight, yet by looking on them against the Sun, I found them to be ting’d\r\nwith a darkish red colour, nothing a-kin to the curious and lovely greens\r\nand blues they exhibited.\r\n\r\nWhat the reason of colour seems to be in such thin plated bodies, I have\r\nelsewhere shewn. But how water cast upon those threads destroys their\r\ncolours, I suppose to be perform’d thus; The water falling upon these\r\nplated bodies from its having a greater congruity to Feathers then the Air,\r\ninsinuates it self between those Plates, and so extrudes the strong\r\nreflecting Air, whence both these parts grow more transparent, as the\r\n_Microscope_ informs, and colourless also, at best retaining a very faint\r\nand dull colour. But this wet being wasted away by the continual\r\nevaporations and steams that pass through them from the Peacock, whil’st\r\nthat Bird is yet alive, the colours again appear in their former luster,\r\nthe _interstitia_ of these Plates being fill’d with the strongly reflecting\r\nAir.\r\n\r\nThe beauteous and vivid colours of the Feathers of this Bird, being found\r\nto proceed from the curious and exceeding smalness and fineness of the\r\nreflecting parts, we have here the reason given us of all those gauderies\r\nin the apparel of other Birds also, and how they come to exceed the colours\r\nof all other kinds of Animals, besides Insects; for since (as we here, and\r\nelsewhere also shew) the vividness of a colour, depends upon the fineness\r\nand transparency of the reflecting and refracting parts; and since our\r\n_Microscope_ discovers to us, that the component parts of feathers are\r\nsuch, and that the hairs of Animals are otherwise; and since we find also\r\nby the Experiment of that Noble and most Excellent Person I formerly named;\r\nthat the difference between Silk and Flax, as to its colour, is nothing\r\nelse (for Flax reduc’d to a very great fineness of parts, both white and\r\ncolour’d, appears as white and as vivid as any Silk, but loses that\r\nbrightness and its Silken aspect as soon as it is twisted into thread, by\r\nreason that the component parts, though very small and fine, are yet\r\npliable flakes, and not cylinders, and thence, by twisting, become united\r\ninto one opacous body, whereas the threads of Silk and Feathers retain\r\ntheir lustre, by preserving their cylindrical form intire without mixing;\r\nso that each reflected and refracted beam that composes the gloss of Silk,\r\npreserves its own property of modulating the light intire); And since we\r\nfind the same confirm’d by many other Experiments elsewhere mentioned, I\r\nthink we may safely conclude this for an Axiome, that wheresoever we meet\r\nwith transparent bodies, spun out into very fine parts, either cleer, or\r\nany ways ting’d, the colours resulting from such a _composition_ must\r\nnecessarily be very glorious, vivid, and cleer, like those of Silk and\r\nFeathers. This may perhaps hint some usefull way of making other bodies,\r\nbesides Silk, be susceptible of bright tinctures, but of this onely by the\r\nby.\r\n\r\nThe changeable colour’d Feathers also of Ducks, and several other Birds, I\r\nhave found by examination with my _Microscope_, to proceed from much the\r\nsame causes and textures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXVII. _Of the Feet of _Flies_, and several other _Insects_._\r\n\r\nThe foot of a Fly (delineated in the first _Figure_ of the 23. _Scheme_,\r\nwhich represents three joints, the two Tallons, and the two Pattens in a\r\nflat posture; and in the second _Figure_ of the same _Scheme_, which\r\nrepresents onely one joint, the Tallons and Pattens in another posture) is\r\nof a most admirable and curious contrivance, for by this the Flies are\r\ninabled to walk against the sides of Glass, perpendicularly upwards, and to\r\ncontain themselves in that posture as long as they please; nay, to walk and\r\nsuspend themselves against the under surface of many bodies, as the ceiling\r\nof a room, or the like, and this with as great a seeming facility and\r\nfirmness, as if they were a kind of _Antipodes_, and had a _tendency_\r\nupwards, as we are sure they have the contrary, which they also evidently\r\ndiscover, in that they cannot make themselves so light, as to stick or\r\nsuspend themselves on the under surface of a Glass well polish’d and\r\ncleans’d; their suspension therefore is wholly to be ascrib’d to some\r\nMechanical contrivance in their feet; which, what it is, we shall in brief\r\nexplain, by shewing, that its Mechanism consists principally in two parts,\r\nthat is, first its two Claws, or Tallons, and secondly, two Palms, Pattens,\r\nor Soles.\r\n\r\nThe two Tallons are very large, in proportion to the foot, and handsomely\r\nshap’d in the manner describ’d in the _Figures_, by AB, and AC, the bigger\r\npart of them from A to _dd_, is all hairy, or brisled, but toward the top,\r\nat C and B smooth, the tops or points, which seem very sharp turning\r\ndownwards and inwards, are each of them mov’d on a joint at A, by which the\r\nFly is able to open or shut them at pleasure, so that the points B and C\r\nbeing entered in any pores, and the Fly endeavouring to shut them, the\r\nClaws not onely draw one against another, and so fasten each other, but\r\nthey draw the whole foot, GGADD forward, so that on a soft footing, the\r\ntenters or points GGGG, (whereof a Fly has about ten in each foot, to wit,\r\ntwo in every joint) run into the pores, if they find any, or at least make\r\ntheir way; and this is sensible to the naked eye, in the feet of a\r\n_Chafer_, which, if he be suffer’d to creep over the hand, or any other\r\npart of the skin of ones body, does make his steps as sensible to the touch\r\nas the sight.\r\n\r\nBut this contrivance, as it often fails the _Chafer_, when he walks on hard\r\nand close bodies, so would it also our Fly, though he be a much lesser, and\r\nnimbler creature, and therefore Nature has furnish’d his foot with another\r\n_additament_ much more curious and admirable, and that is, with a couple of\r\nPalms, Pattens or Soles DD, the structure of which is this:\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom or under part of the last joint of his foot, K, arise two\r\nsmall thin plated horny substances, each consisting of two flat pieces, DD,\r\nwhich seem to be flexible, like the covers of a Book, about FF, by which\r\nmeans, the plains of the two sides EE, do not always lie in the same plain,\r\nbut may be sometimes shut closer, and so each of them may take a little\r\nhold themselves on a body; but that is not all, for the under sides of\r\nthese Soles are all beset with small brisles, or tenters, like the Wire\r\nteeth of a Card used for working Wool, the points of all which tend\r\nforwards, hence the two Tallons drawing the feet forwards, as I before\r\nhinted, and these being applied to the surface of the body with all the\r\npoints looking the contrary way, that is, forwards and outwards, if there\r\nbe any irregularity or yielding in the surface of the body, the Fly\r\nsuspends it self very firmly and easily, without the access or need of any\r\nsuch Sponges fill’d with an imaginary _gluten_, as many have, for want of\r\ngood Glasses, perhaps, or a troublesome and diligent examination, suppos’d.\r\n\r\nNow, that the Fly is able to walk on Glass, proceeds partly from some\r\nruggedness of the surface: and chiefly from a kind of tarnish, or dirty\r\nsmoaky substance, which adheres to the surface of that very hard body; and\r\nthough the pointed parts cannot penetrate the substance of Glass, yet may\r\nthey find pores enough in the tarnish, or at least make them.\r\n\r\nThis Structure I somewhat the more diligently survey’d, because I could not\r\nwell comprehend, how, if there were such a glutinous matter in those\r\nsupposed Sponges, as most (that have observ’d that Object in a\r\n_Microscope_) have hitherto believ’d, how, I say, the Fly could so readily\r\nunglew and loosen its feet: and, because I have not found any other\r\ncreature to have a contrivance any ways like it, and chiefly, that we might\r\nnot be cast upon unintelligible explications of the _Phænomena_ of Nature,\r\nat least others then the true ones, where our senses were able to furnish\r\nus with an intelligible, rationall and true one.\r\n\r\nSomewhat a like contrivance to this of Flies shall we find in most other\r\nAnimals, such as all kinds of Flies and case-wing’d creatures; nay, in a\r\nFlea, an Animal abundantly smaller then this Fly. Other creatures, as\r\nMites, the Land-Crab, &c. have onely one small very sharp Tallon at the end\r\nof each of their legs, which all drawing towards the center or middle of\r\ntheir body, inable these exceeding light bodies to suspend and fasten\r\nthemselves to almost any surface.\r\n\r\nWhich how they are able to do, will not seem strange, if we consider,\r\nfirst, how little body there is in one of these creatures compar’d to their\r\nsuperficies, or outside, their thickness, perhaps, oftentimes, not\r\namounting to the hundredth part of an Inch: Next, the strength and agility\r\nof these creatures compar’d to their bulk, being, proportionable to their\r\nbulk, perhaps, an hundred times stronger then an Horse or Man. And thirdly,\r\nif we consider that Nature does always appropriate the instruments, so as\r\nthey are the most fit and convenient to perform their offices, and the most\r\nsimple and plain that possibly can be; this we may see further verify’d\r\nalso in the foot of a Louse which is very much differing from those I have\r\nbeen describing, but more convenient and necessary for the place of its\r\nhabitation, each of his leggs being footed with a couple of small claws\r\nwhich he can open or shut at pleasure, shap’d almost like the claws of a\r\nLobster or Crab, but with appropriated contrivances for his peculiar use,\r\nwhich being to move its body to and fro upon the hairs of the creature it\r\ninhabits, Nature has furnish’d one of its claws with joints, almost like\r\nthe joints of a man’s fingers, so as thereby it is able to encompass or\r\ngrasp a hair as firmly as a man can a stick or rope.\r\n\r\nNor, is there a less admirable and wonderfull _Mechanism_ in the foot of a\r\nSpider, whereby he is able to spin, weave, and climb, or run on his curious\r\ntransparent clew, of which I shall say more in the description of that\r\nAnimal.\r\n\r\nAnd to conclude, we shall in all things find, that Nature does not onely\r\nwork Mechanically, but by such excellent and most compendious, as well as\r\nstupendious contrivances, that it were impossible for all the reason in the\r\nworld to find out any contrivance to do the same thing that should have\r\nmore convenient properties. And can any be so sottish, as to think all\r\nthose things the productions of chance? Certainly, either their\r\nRatiocination must be extremely depraved, or they did never attentively\r\nconsider and contemplate the Works of the Al-mighty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXVIII. _Of the Structure and motion of the Wings of _Flies_._\r\n\r\nThe Wings of all kinds of Insects, are, for the most part, very beautifull\r\nObjects, and afford no less pleasing an Object to the mind to speculate\r\nupon, then to the eye to behold. This of the blue Fly, among the rest,\r\nwants not its peculiar ornaments and contrivances; it grows out of the\r\n_Thorax_, or middle part of the body of a Fly, and is seated a little\r\nbeyond the center of gravity in the body towards the head, but that\r\n_Excentricly_ is curiously balanc’d; first, by the expanded _Area_ of the\r\nwings which lies all more backwards then the root, by the motion of them,\r\nwhereby the center of their vibration is much more backwards towards the\r\ntail of the Fly then the root of the wing is. What the vibrative motion of\r\nthe wings is, and after what manner they are moved, I have endeavoured by\r\nmany trials to find out: And first for the manner of their motion, I\r\nendeavoured to observe several of those kind of small spinning Flies, which\r\nwill naturally suspend themselves, as it were, pois’d and steady in one\r\nplace of the air, without rising or falling, or moving forwards or\r\nbackwards; for by looking down on those, I could by a kind of faint shadow,\r\nperceive the utmost extremes of the vibrative motion of their wings, which\r\nshadow, whil’st they so endeavoured to suspend themselves, was not very\r\nlong, but when they endeavour’d to flie forwards, it was somewhat longer;\r\nnext, I tried it, by fixing the leggs of a Fly upon the top of the stalk of\r\na feather, with Glew, Wax, &c. and then making it endeavour to flie away;\r\nfor being thereby able to view it in any posture, I collected that the\r\nmotion of the wing was after this manner. The extreme limits of the\r\nvibrations were usually somewhat about the length of the body distant from\r\none another, oftentimes shorter, and sometimes also longer; that the\r\nformost limit was usually a little above the back, and the hinder somwhat\r\nbeneath the belly; between which two limits, if one may ghess by the sound,\r\nthe wing seem’d to be mov’d forwards and backwards with an equal velocity:\r\nAnd if one may (from the shadow or faint representation the wings afforded,\r\nand from the consideration of the nature of the thing) ghess at the posture\r\nor manner of the wings moving between them, it seem’d to be this: The wing\r\nbeing suppos’d placed in the upmost limit, seems to be put so that the\r\nplain of it lies almost _horizontal_, but onely the forepart does dip a\r\nlittle, or is somewhat more deprest; in this position is the wing vibrated\r\nor mov’d to the lower limit, being almost arrived at the lower limit, the\r\nhinder part of the wing moving somewhat faster then the former, the _Area_\r\nof the wing begins to dip behind, and in that posture seems it to be mov’d\r\nto the upper limit back again, and thence back again in the first posture,\r\nthe former part of the _Area_ dipping again, as it is moved downwards by\r\nmeans of the quicker motion of the main stem which terminates or edges the\r\nforepart of the wing. And these vibrations or motions to and fro between\r\nthe two limits seem so swift, that ’tis very probable (from the sound it\r\naffords, if it be compar’d with the vibration of a musical string, tun’d\r\nunison to it) it makes many hundreds, if not some thousands of vibrations\r\nin a second minute of time. And, if we may be allow’d to ghess by the\r\nsound, the wing of a Bee is yet more swift, for the tone is much more\r\nacute, and that, in all likelihood, proceeds from the exceeding swift\r\nbeating of the air by the small wing. And it seems the more likely too,\r\nbecause the wing of a Bee is less in proportion to its body, then the other\r\nwing to the body of a Fly; so that for ought I know, it may be one of the\r\nquickest vibrating _spontaneous_ motions of any in the world; and though\r\nperhaps there may be many Flies in other places that afford a yet more\r\nshrill note with their wings, yet ’tis most probable that the quickest\r\nvibrating _spontaneous_ motion is to be found in the wing of some creature.\r\nNow, if we consider the exceeding quickness of these Animal spirits that\r\nmust cause these motions, we cannot chuse but admire the exceeding\r\nvividness of the governing faculty or _Anima_ of the Insect, which is able\r\nto dispose and regulate so the motive faculties, as to cause every\r\npeculiar organ, not onely to move or act so quick, but to do it also so\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\nWhil’st I was examining and considering the curious _Mechanism_ of the\r\nwings, I observ’d that under the wings of most kind of Flies, Bees, &c.\r\nthere were plac’d certain _pendulums_ or extended drops (as I may so call\r\nthem from their resembling motion and figure) for they much resembled a\r\nlong hanging drop of some transparent viscous liquor; and I observed them\r\nconstantly to move just before the wings of the Fly began to move, so that\r\nat the first sight I could not but ghess, that there was some excellent\r\nuse, as to the regulation of the motion of the wing, and did phancy, that\r\nit might be something like the handle of a Cock, which by vibrating to and\r\nfro, might, as ’twere, open and shut the Cock, and thereby give a passage\r\nto the determinate influences into the Muscles; afterwards, upon some other\r\ntrials, I suppos’d that they might be for some use in respiration, which\r\nfor many reasons I suppose those Animals to use, and, me thought, it was\r\nnot very improbable, but that they might have convenient passages under the\r\nwings for the emitting, at least, of the air, if not admitting, as in the\r\ngills of Fishes is most evident; or, perhaps, this _Pendulum_ might be\r\nsomewhat like the staff to a Pump, whereby these creatures might exercise\r\ntheir _Analogous_ lungs, and not only draw in, but force out, the air they\r\nlive by: but these were but conjectures, and upon further examination\r\nseem’d less probable.\r\n\r\nThe fabrick of the wing, as it appears through a moderately magnifying\r\n_Microscope_, seems to be a body consisting of two parts, as is visible in\r\nthe 4. _Figure_ of the 23. _Scheme_; and by the 2. _Figure_ of the 26.\r\n_Scheme_; the one is a quilly or finny substance, consisting of several\r\nlong, slender and variously bended quills or wires, something resembling\r\nthe veins of leaves; these are, as ’twere, the finns or quills which\r\nstiffen the whole _Area_, and keep the other part distended, which is a\r\nvery thin transparent skin or membrane variously folded, and platted, but\r\nnot very regularly, and is besides exceeding thickly bestuck with\r\ninnumerable small bristles, which are onely perceptible by the bigger\r\nmagnifying _Microscope_, and not with that neither, but with a very\r\nconvenient augmentation of sky-light projected on the Object with a burning\r\nGlass, as I have elsewhere shew’d, or by looking through it against the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn steed of these small hairs, in several other Flies, there are infinite\r\nof small Feathers, which cover both the under and upper sides of this thin\r\nfilm as in almost all the sorts of Butterflies and Moths: and those small\r\nparts are not onely shap’d very much like the feathers of Birds, but like\r\nthose variegated with all the variety of curious bright and vivid colours\r\nimaginable; and those feathers are likewise so admirably and delicately\r\nrang’d, as to compose very fine flourishings and ornamental paintings, like\r\n_Turkie_ and _Persian_ Carpets, but of far more surpassing beauty, as is\r\nevident enough to the naked eye, in the painted wings of Butterflies, but\r\nmuch more through an ordinary _Microscope_.\r\n\r\nIntermingled likewise with these hairs, may be perceived multitudes of\r\nlittle pits, or black spots, in the extended membrane, which seem to be the\r\nroot of the hairs that grow on the other side; these two bodies seem\r\ndispers’d over the whole surface of the wing.\r\n\r\nThe hairs are best perceiv’d, by looking through it against the light, or,\r\nby laying the wing upon a very white piece of Paper, in a convenient light,\r\nfor thereby every little hair most manifestly appears; a _Specimen_ of\r\nwhich you may observe drawn in the fourth _Figure_ of the 23. _Scheme_, AB,\r\nCD, EF whereof represent some parts of the bones or quills of the wing,\r\neach of which you may perceive to be cover’d over with a multitude of\r\nscales, or bristles, the former AB, is the biggest stem of all the wing,\r\nand may be properly enough call’d the cut-air, it being that which\r\nterminates and stiffens the formost edge of the wing; the fore-edge of this\r\nis arm’d with a multitude of little brisles, or Tenter-hooks, in some\r\nstanding regular and in order, in others not; all the points of which are\r\ndirected from the body towards the tip of the wing, nor is this edge onely\r\nthus fring’d, but even all the whole edge of the wing is covered with a\r\nsmall fringe, consisting of short and more slender brisles.\r\n\r\nThis Subject, had I time, would afford excellent matter for the\r\ncontemplation of the nature of wings and of flying, but, because I may,\r\nperhaps, get a more convenient time to prosecute that speculation, and\r\nrecollect several Observations that I have made of that particular. I shall\r\nat present proceed to\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XXXIX. _Of the Eyes and Head of a _Grey drone-Fly_,\r\nand of several other creatures._\r\n\r\nI took a large grey _Drone-Fly_, that had a large head, but a small and\r\nslender body in proportion to it, and cutting off its head, I fix’d it with\r\nthe forepart or face upwards upon my Object Plate (this I made choice of\r\nrather then the head of a great blue Fly, because my enquiry being now\r\nabout the eyes, I found this Fly to have, first the biggest clusters of\r\neyes in proportion to his head, of any small kind of Fly that I have yet\r\nseen, it being somewhat inclining towards the make of the large\r\n_Dragon-Flies_. Next, because there is a greater variety in the knobs or\r\nballs of each cluster, then is of any small Fly.) Then examining it\r\naccording to my usual manner, by varying the degrees of light, and altering\r\nits position to each kinde of light, I drew that representation of it which\r\nis delineated in the 24. _Scheme_, and found these things to be as plain\r\nand evident, as notable and pleasant.\r\n\r\n_First_, that the greatest part of the face, nay, of the head, was nothing\r\nelse but two large and _protuberant_ bunches, or _prominent_ parts, ABCDEA,\r\nthe surface of each of which was all cover’d over, or shap’d into a\r\nmultitude of small _Hemispheres_, plac’d in a _triagonal_ order, that being\r\nthe closest and most compacted, and in that order, rang’d over the whole\r\nsurface of the eye in very lovely rows, between each of which, as is\r\nnecessary, were left long and regular trenches, the bottoms of every of\r\nwhich, were perfectly intire and not at all perforated or drill’d through,\r\nwhich I most certainly was assured of, by the regularly reflected Image of\r\ncertain Objects which I mov’d to and fro between the head and the light.\r\nAnd by examining the _Cornea_ or outward skin, after I had stript it off\r\nfrom the several substances that lay within it, and by looking both upon\r\nthe inside and against the light.\r\n\r\n_Next_, that of those multitudes of _Hemispheres_, there were observable\r\ntwo degrees of bigness, the half of them that were lowermost, and look’d\r\ntoward the ground or their own leggs, namely, CDE, CDE being a pretty deal\r\nsmaller then the other, namely, ABCE, ABCE, that look’d upward, and\r\nside-ways, or foreright, and backward, which variety I have not found in\r\nany other small Fly.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly_, that every one of these _Hemispheres_, as they seem’d to be\r\npretty neer the true shape of a _Hemisphere_, so was the surface exceeding\r\nsmooth and regular, reflecting as exact, regular, and perfect an Image of\r\nany Object from the surface of them, as a small Ball of Quick-silver of\r\nthat bigness would do, but nothing neer so vivid, the reflection from these\r\nbeing very languid, much like the reflection from the outside of Water,\r\nGlass, Crystal, &c. In so much that in each of these _Hemispheres_, I have\r\nbeen able to discover a Land-scape of those things which lay before my\r\nwindow, one thing of which was a large Tree, whose trunk and top I could\r\nplainly discover, as I could also the parts of my window, and my hand and\r\nfingers, if I held it between the Window and the Object; a small draught of\r\nnineteen of which, as they appear’d in the bigger Magnifying-glass to\r\nreflect the Image of the two windows of my Chamber, are delineated in the\r\nthird _Figure_ of the 23. _Scheme_.\r\n\r\n_Fourthly_, that these rows were so dispos’d, that there was no quarter\r\nvisible from his head that there was not some of these _Hemispheres_\r\ndirected against, so that a Fly may be truly said to have _an eye every\r\nway_, and to be really _circumspect_. And it was further observable, that\r\nthat way where the trunk of his body did hinder his prospect backward,\r\nthese _protuberances_ were elevated, as it were, above the plain of his\r\nshoulders and back, so that he was able to see backwards also over his\r\nback.\r\n\r\n_Fifthly_, in living Flies, I have observ’d, that when any small mote or\r\ndust, which flies up and down the air, chances to light upon any part of\r\nthese knobs, as it is sure to stick firmly to it and not fall, though\r\nthrough the _Microscope_ it appears like a large stone or stick (which one\r\nwould admire, especially since it is no ways probable that there is any wet\r\nor glutinous matter upon these _Hemispheres_, but I hope I shall render the\r\nreason in another place) so the Fly presently makes use of his two\r\nfore-feet in stead of eye-lids, with which, as with two Brooms or Brushes,\r\nthey being all bestuck with Brisles, he often sweeps or brushes off what\r\never hinders the prospect of any of his _Hemispheres_, and then, to free\r\nhis leggs from that dirt, he rubs them one against another, the pointed\r\nBrisles or Tenters of which looking both one way, the rubbing of them to\r\nand fro one against another, does cleanse them in the same manner as I have\r\nobserv’d those that Card Wool, to cleanse their Cards, by placing their\r\nCards, so as the teeth of both look the same way, and then rubbing them one\r\nagainst another. In the very same manner do they brush and cleanse their\r\nbodies and wings, as I shall by and by shew; other creatures have other\r\ncontrivances for the cleansing and cleering their eyes.\r\n\r\n_Sixthly_ that the number of the _Pearls_ or _Hemispheres_ in the clusters\r\nof this Fly, was neer 14000. which I judged by numbering certain rows of\r\nthem several ways, and casting up the whole content, accounting each\r\ncluster to contain about seven thousand Pearls, three thousand of which\r\nwere of a size, and consequently the rows not so thick, and the foure\r\nthousand I accounted to be the number of the smaller Pearls next the feet\r\nand _proboscis_. Other Animals I observ’d to have yet a greater number, as\r\nthe _Dragon-Fly_ or _Adderbolt_: And others to have a much less company, as\r\nan _Ant_, &c. and several other small Flies and Insects.\r\n\r\n_Seventhly_, that the order of these eies or _Hemispheres_ was altogether\r\ncurious and admirable, they being plac’d in all kind of Flies, and _aerial_\r\nanimals, in a most curious and regular ordination of triangular rows, in\r\nwhich order they are rang’d the neerest together that possibly they can,\r\nand consequently leave the least pits or trenches between them. But in\r\n_Shrimps_, _Crawfishes_, _Lobsters_, and such kinds of _Crustaceous_ water\r\nAnimals, I have yet observ’d them rang’d in a quadrangular order, the rows\r\ncutting each other at right angles, which as it admits of a less number of\r\nPearls in equal surfaces; so have those creatures a recompence made them,\r\nby having their eyes a little movable in their heads, which the other\r\naltogether want. So infinitely wise and provident do we find all the\r\nDispensations in Nature, that certainly _Epicurus_, and his followers, must\r\nvery little have consider’d them, who ascrib’d those things to the\r\nproduction of chance, that wil, to a more attentive considerer, appear the\r\nproducts of the highest Wisdom and Providence.\r\n\r\nUpon the Anatomy or Dissection of the Head, I observ’d these particulars:\r\n\r\nFirst, that this outward skin, like the _Cornea_ of the eyes of the greater\r\nAnimals, was both flexible and transparent, and seem’d, through the\r\n_Microscope_ perfectly to resemble the very substance of the _Cornea_ of a\r\nman’s eye; for having cut out the cluster, and remov’d the dark and\r\n_mucous_ stuff that is subjacent to it, I could see it transparent like a\r\nthin piece of skin, having as many cavities in the inside of it, and rang’d\r\nin the same order as it had _protuberances_ on the outside, and this\r\npropriety, I found the same in all the Animals that had it, whether Flies\r\nor Shell-Fish.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I found that all Animals that I have observ’d with those kind of\r\neyes; have within this _Cornea_, a certain cleer liquor or juice, though in\r\na very little quantity, and,\r\n\r\nI observ’d thirdly, that within that cleer liquor, they had a kind of dark\r\n_mucous_ lining, which was all spread round within the cavity of the\r\nclutter, and seem’d very neer adjoining to it, the colour of which, in some\r\nFlies, was grey; in others, black, in others red; in others, of a mix’d\r\ncolour; in others, spotted; and that the whole clusters, when look’d on\r\nwhilst the Animal was living, or but newly kill’d, appear’d of the same\r\ncolour that this coat (as I may so call it) appear’d of, when that outward\r\nskin, or _Cornea_, was remov’d.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that the rest of the capacity of the clusters was in some, as in\r\nDragon Flies, &c. hollow, or empty; in others fill’d with some kind of\r\nsubstance; in blue Flies, with a reddish musculous substance, with _fibres_\r\ntending from the center or bottom outwards; and divers other, with various\r\nand differing kinds of substances.\r\n\r\nThat this curious contrivance is the organ of sight to all those various\r\n_Crustaceous_ Animals, which are furnish’d with it, I think we need not\r\ndoubt, if we consider but the several congruities it has with the eyes of\r\ngreater creatures.\r\n\r\nAs first, that it is furnish’d with a _Cornea_, with a _transparent\r\nhumour_, and with a _uvea_ or _retina_, that the Figure of each of the\r\nsmall _Hemispheres_ are very _Spherical_, exactly polish’d, and most vivid,\r\nlively and plump, when the Animal is living, as in greater Animals, and in\r\nlike manner dull, flaccid, and irregular, or shrunk, when the Animal is\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nNext, that those creatures that are furnish’d with it, have no other organs\r\nthat have any resemblance to the known eyes of other creatures.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that those which they call the eyes of Crabs, Lobsters, Shrimps,\r\nand the like, and are really so, are _Hemispher’d_, almost in the same\r\nmanner as these of Flies are. And that they really are so, I have very\r\noften try’d, by cutting off these little movable knobs, and putting the\r\ncreature again into the water, that it would swim to and fro, and move up\r\nand down as well as before, but would often hit it self against the rocks\r\nor stones; and though I put my hand just before its head, it would not at\r\nall start or fly back till I touch’d it, whereas whil’st those were\r\nremaining, it would start back, and avoid my hand or a stick at a good\r\ndistance before it touch’d it. And if in _crustaceous_ Sea-animals, then it\r\nseems very probable also, that these knobs are the eyes in _crustaceous_\r\nInsects, which are also of the same kind, onely in a higher and more active\r\nElement; this the conformity or congruity of many other parts common to\r\neither of them, will strongly argue, their _crustaceous_ armour, their\r\nnumber of leggs, which are six, beside the two great claws, which answer to\r\nthe wings in Insects; and in all kind of Spiders, as also in many other\r\nInsects that want wings, we shall find the compleat number of them, and not\r\nonely the number, but the very shape, figure, joints, and claws of Lobsters\r\nand Crabs, as is evident in Scorpions and Spiders, as is visible in the\r\nsecond _Figure_ of the 31. _Scheme_, and in the little Mite-worm, which I\r\ncall a Land-crab, describ’d in the second Figure of the 33. _Scheme_, but\r\nin their manner of generation being oviparous, &c. And it were very worthy\r\nobservation, whether there be not some kinds of transformation and\r\nmetamorphosis in the several states of _crustaceous_ water-animals, as\r\nthere is in several sorts of Insects; for if such could be met with, the\r\nprogress of the variations would be much more conspicuous in those larger\r\nAnimals, then they can be in any kind of Insects our colder Climate\r\naffords.\r\n\r\nThese being their eyes, it affords us a very pretty Speculation to\r\ncontemplate their manner of vision, which, as it is very differing from\r\nthat of _biocular_ Animals, so is it not less admirable.\r\n\r\nThat each of these Pearls or _Hemispheres_ is a perfect eye, I think we\r\nneed not doubt, if we consider onely the outside or figure of any one of\r\nthem, for they being each of them cover’d with a transparent protuberant\r\n_Cornea_, and containing a liquor within them, resembling the watry or\r\nglassie humours of the eye, must necessarily refract all the parallel Rays\r\nthat fall on them out of the air, into a point not farr distant within\r\nthem, where (in all probability) the _Retina_ of the eye is placed, and\r\nthat opacous, dark, and mucous inward coat that (I formerly shew’d) I found\r\nto subtend the concave part of the cluster is very likely to be that\r\n_tunicle_ or coat, it appearing through the _Microscope_ to be plac’d a\r\nlittle more than a Diameter of those Pearls below or within the _tunica\r\ncornea_. And if so, then is there in all probability, a little Picture or\r\nImage of the objects without, painted or made at the bottom of the _Retina_\r\nagainst every one of those Pearls, so that there are as many impressions on\r\nthe _Retina_ or opacous skin, as there are Pearls or _Hemispheres_ on the\r\ncluster. But because it is impossible for any protuberant surface\r\nwhatsoever, whether _sphærial_ or other, so to refract the Rays that come\r\nfrom farr remote _lateral_ points of any Object as to collect them again,\r\nand unite them each in a distinct point, and that onely those Rays which\r\ncome from some point that lies in the _Axis_ of the Figure produc’d, are so\r\naccurately refracted to one and the same point again, and that the\r\n_lateral_ Rays, the further they are remov’d, the more imperfect is their\r\nrefracted confluence; It follows therefore, that onely the Picture of those\r\nparts of the external objects that lie in, or neer, the _Axis_ of each\r\n_Hemisphere_, are discernably painted or made on the _Retina_ of each\r\n_Hemisphere_, and that therefore each of them can distinctly sensate or see\r\nonely those parts which are very neer perpendicularly oppos’d to it, or lie\r\nin or neer its optick _Axis_. Now, though there may be by each of these\r\neye-pearls, a representation to the Animal of a whole _Hemisphere_ in the\r\nsame manner as in a man’s eye there is a picture or sensation in the\r\n_Retina_ of all the objects lying almost in an _Hemisphere_; yet, as in a\r\nman’s eye also, there are but some very few points which liyng in, or neer,\r\nthe optick _Axis_ are distinctly discern’d: So there may be multitudes of\r\nPictures made of an Object in the several Pearls, and yet but one, or some\r\nvery few that are distinct; The representation of any object that is made\r\nin any other Pearl, but that which is directly, or very neer directly,\r\noppos’d, being altogether confus’d and unable to produce a distinct vision.\r\n\r\nSo that we see, that though it has pleas’d the All-wise Creator, to indue\r\nthis creature with such multitudes of eyes, yet has he not indued it with\r\nthe faculty of seeing more then another creature; for whereas this cannot\r\nmove his head, at least can move it very little, without moving his whole\r\nbody, _biocular_ creatures can in an instant (or _the twinkling of an eye_,\r\nwhich, being very quick, is vulgarly used in the same signification) move\r\ntheir eyes so as to direct the optick _Axis_ to any point; nor is it\r\nprobable, that they are able to see attentively at one time more then one\r\nPhysical point; for though there be a distinct Image made in every eye, yet\r\n’tis very likely, that the observing faculty is only imploy’d about some\r\none object for which they have most concern.\r\n\r\nNow, as we accurately distinguish the site or position of an Object by the\r\nmotion of the Muscles of the eye requisite to put the optick Line in a\r\ndirect position, and confusedly by the position of the imperfect Picture of\r\nthe object at the bottom of the eye; so are these _crustaceous_ creatures\r\nable to judge confusedly of the position of objects by the Picture or\r\nimpression made at the bottom of the opposite Pearl, and distinctly by the\r\nremoval of the attentive or observing faculty, from one Pearl to another,\r\nbut what this faculty is, as it requires another place, so a much deeper\r\nspeculation. Now, because it were impossible, even with this multitude of\r\neye-balls, to see any object distinct (for as I hinted before, onely those\r\nparts that lay in, or very neer, the optick Lines could be so) the\r\nInfinitely wise Creator has not left the creature without a power of moving\r\nthe head a little in _Aerial crustaceous_ animals, and the very eyes also\r\nin _crustaceous_ Sea-animals; so that by these means they are inabled to\r\ndirect some optick line or other against any object, and by that means they\r\nhave the visive faculty as compleat as any Animal that can move its eyes.\r\n\r\nDistances of Objects also, ’tis very likely they distinguish, partly by the\r\nconsonant impressions made in some two convenient Pearls, one in each\r\ncluster; for, according as those congruous impressions affect, two Pearls\r\nneerer approach’d to each other, the neerer is the Object, and the farther\r\nthey are distant, the more distant is the Object: partly also by the\r\nalteration of each Pearl, requisite to make the Sensation or Picture\r\nperfect; for ’tis impossible that the Pictures of two Objects, variously\r\ndistant, can be perfectly painted, or made on the same _Retina_ or bottom\r\nof the eye not altered, as will be very evident to any one that shall\r\nattentively consider the nature of refraction. Now, whether this alteration\r\nmay be in the Figure of the _Cornea_, in the motion of access or recess of\r\nthe _Retina_ towards the _Cornea_, or in the alteration of a crystalline\r\nhumour, if such there be, I pretend not to determine; though I think we\r\nneed not doubt, but that there may be as much curiosity of contrivance and\r\nstructure in every one of these Pearls, as in the eye of a Whale or\r\nElephant, and the almighty’s _Fiat_ could as easily cause the existence of\r\nthe one as the other; and as one day and a thousand years are the same with\r\nhim, so may one eye and ten thousand.\r\n\r\nThis we may be sure of, that the filaments or sensative parts of the\r\n_Retina_ must be most exceedingly curious and minute, since the whole\r\nPicture it self is such; what must needs the component parts be of that\r\n_Retina_, which distinguishes the part of an object’s Picture that must be\r\nmany millions of millions less then that in a man’s eye? And how exceeding\r\ncurious and subtile must the component parts of the _medium_ that conveys\r\nlight be, when we find the instrument made for its reception or refraction\r\nto be so exceedingly small? we may, I think, from this speculation be\r\nsufficiently discouraged from hoping to discover by any optick or other\r\ninstrument the determinate bulk of the parts of the _medium_ that conveys\r\nthe pulse of light, since we find that there is not less accurateness shewn\r\nin the Figure and polish of those exceedingly minute lenticular surfaces,\r\nthen in those more large and conspicuous surfaces of our own eyes. And yet\r\ncan I not doubt, but that there is a determinate bulk of those parts, since\r\nI find them unable to enter between the parts of Mercury, which being in\r\nmotion, must necessarily have pores, as I shall elsewhere shew, and here\r\npass by, as being a digression.\r\n\r\nAs concerning the horns FF, the feelers or smellers, GG, the _Proboscis_\r\nHH, and I, the hairs and brisles, KK, I shall indeavour to describe in the\r\n42. _Observation_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XL. _Of the Teeth of a _Snail_._\r\n\r\nI have little more to add of the Teeth of a Snail, besides the Picture of\r\nit, which is represented in the first _Figure_ of the 25. _Scheme_, save\r\nthat his bended body, ABCDEF, which seem’d fashioned very much like a row\r\nof small teeth, orderly plac’d in the Gums, and looks as if it were divided\r\ninto several smaller and greater black teeth, was nothing but one small\r\nbended hard bone, which was plac’d in the upper jaw of the mouth of a\r\nHouse-Snail, with which I observ’d this very Snail to feed on the leaves of\r\na Rose-tree, and to bite out pretty large and half round bits, not unlike\r\nthe Figure of a (C) nor very much differing from it in bigness, the upper\r\npart ABCD of this bone, I found to be much whiter, and to grow out of the\r\nupper chap of the Snail, GGG, and not to be any thing neer so much creas’d\r\nas the lower and blacker part of it HIIHKKH which was exactly shap’d like\r\nteeth, the bone growing thinner, or tapering to an edge towards KKK. It\r\nseem’d to have nine teeth, or prominent parts IK, IK, IF, &c. which were\r\njoin’d together by the thinner interpos’d parts of the bone. The Animal to\r\nwhich these teeth belong, is a very _anomalous_ creature, and seems of a\r\nkind quite distinct from any other terrestrial Animal or Insect, the\r\nAnatomy whereof exceedingly differing from what has been hitherto given of\r\nit I should have inserted, but that it will be more proper in another\r\nplace. I have never met with any kind of Animal whose teeth are all join’d\r\nin one, save onely that I lately observ’d, that all the teeth of a\r\nRhinocerot, which grow on either side of its mouth, are join’d into one\r\nlarge bone, the weight of one of which I found to be neer eleven pound\r\n_Haverdupois_. So that it seems one of the biggest sort of terrestrial\r\nAnimals, as well as one of the smallest, has his teeth thus shap’d.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLI. _Of the Eggs of _Silk-worms_, and other Insects._\r\n\r\nThe Eggs of Silk-worms (one of which I have describ’d in the second\r\n_Figure_ of 25. _Scheme_) afford a pretty Object for a _Microscope_ that\r\nmagnifies very much, especially if it be bright weather, and the light of a\r\nwindow be cast or collected on it by a deep _Convex glass_, or Water-ball.\r\nFor then the whole surface of the Shell may be perceiv’d all cover’d over\r\nwith exceeding small pits or cavities with interposed edges, almost in the\r\nmanner of the surface of a Poppy-seed, but that these holes are not an\r\nhundredth part scarce of their bigness; the Shell, when the young ones were\r\nhatch’d (which I found an easie thing to do, if the Eggs were kept in a\r\nwarm place) appear’d no thicker in proportion to its bulk, then that of an\r\nHen’s or Goos’s Egg is to its bulk, and all the Shell appear’d very white\r\n(which seem’d to proceed from its transparency) whence all those pittings\r\ndid almost vanish, so that they could not, without much difficulty, be\r\ndiscern’d, the inside of the Shell seem’d to be lin’d also with a kind of\r\nthin film, not unlike (keeping the proportion to its Shell) that with which\r\nthe shell of an Hen-egg is lin’d; and the shell it self seem’d like common\r\nEgg-shells; very brittle, and crack’d. In divers other of these Eggs I\r\ncould plainly enough, through the shell, perceive the small Insect lie\r\ncoyled round the edges of the shell. The shape of the Egg it self, the\r\nFigure pretty well represents (though by default of the Graver it does not\r\nappear so rounded, and lying above the Paper, as it were, as it ought to\r\ndo) that is, it was for the most part pretty oval end-ways, somewhat like\r\nan Egg, but the other way it was a little flatted on two opposite sides.\r\nDivers of these Eggs, as is common to most others, I found to be barren, or\r\naddle, for they never afforded any young ones. And those I usually found\r\nmuch whiter then the other that were prolifick. The Eggs of other kinds of\r\nOviparous Insects I have found to be perfectly round every way, like so\r\nmany Globules, of this sort I have observ’d some sorts of Spiders Eggs; and\r\nchancing the last Summer to inclose a very large and curiously painted\r\nButterfly in a Box, intending to examine its gaudery with my _Microscope_,\r\nI found within a day or two after I inclos’d her, almost all the inner\r\nsurface of the Box cover’d over with an infinite of exactly round Eggs,\r\nwhich were stuck very fast to the sides of it, and in so exactly regular\r\nand close an order, that made me call to mind my _Hypothesis_, which I had\r\nformerly thought on for the making out of all the regular Figures of Salt,\r\nwhich I have elsewhere hinted; for here I found all of them rang’d into a\r\nmost exact _triagonal_ order, much after the manner as the _Hemispheres_\r\nare place on the eye of a Fly; all which Eggs I found after a little time\r\nto be hatch’d, and out of them to come a multitude of small Worms, very\r\nmuch resembling young Silk-worms, leaving all their thin hollow shells\r\nbehind them, sticking on the Box in their _triagonal_ posture; these I\r\nfound with the _Microscope_ to have much such a substance as the Silk-worms\r\nEggs, but could not perceive them pitted. And indeed, there is as great a\r\nvariety in the shape of the Eggs of Oviparous Insects as among those of\r\nBirds.\r\n\r\nOf these Eggs, a large and lusty Fly will at one time lay neer four or five\r\nhundred, so that the increase of these kind of Insects must needs be very\r\nprodigious, were they not prey’d on by multitudes of Birds, and destroy’d\r\nby Frosts and Rains; and hence ’tis those hotter Climates between the\r\n_Tropicks_ are infested with such multitudes of Locusts, and such other\r\nVermine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLII. _Of a blue _Fly_._\r\n\r\nThis kind of Fly, whereof a _Microscopical_ Picture is delineated in the\r\nfirst _Figure_ of the 26. _Scheme_, is a very beautifull creature, and has\r\nmany things about it very notable; divers of which I have already partly\r\ndescrib’d, namely, the feet, wings, eyes, and head, in the preceding\r\nObservations.\r\n\r\nAnd though the head before describ’d be that of a grey _Drone-Fly_, yet for\r\nthe main it is very agreeable to this. The things wherein they differ most,\r\nwill be easily enough found by the following particulars:\r\n\r\nFirst, the clusters of eyes of this Fly, are very much smaller then those\r\nof the _Dron-Fly_, in proportion to the head.\r\n\r\nAnd next, all the eyes of each cluster seem’d much of the same bigness one\r\nwith another, not differing as the other, but rang’d in the same\r\n_triagonal_ order.\r\n\r\nThirdly, between these two clusters, there was a scaly prominent _front_ B,\r\nwhich was arm’d and adorn’d with large tapering sharp black brisles, which\r\ngrowing out in rows on either side, were so bent toward each other neer the\r\ntop, as to make a kind of arched arbour of Brisles, which almost cover’d\r\nthe former _front_.\r\n\r\nFourthly, at the end of this Arch, about the middle of the face, on a\r\nprominent part C, grew two small oblong bodies, DD, which through a\r\n_Microscope_ look’d not unlike the Pendants in Lillies, these seem’d to be\r\njointed on to two small parts at C, each of which seem’d again jointed into\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nFifthly, out of the upper part and outsides of these horns (as I may call\r\nthem, from the Figure they are of, in the 24. _Scheme_, where they are\r\nmarked with FF) there grows a single feather, or brushy Brisle, EE,\r\nsomewhat of the same kind with the tufts of a Gnat, which I have before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nWhat the use of these kind of horned and tufted bodies should be, I cannot\r\nwell imagine, unless they serve for smelling or hearing, though how they\r\nare adapted for either, it seems very difficult to describe: they are in\r\nalmost every several kind of Flies of so various a shape; though certainly\r\nthey are some very essential part of the head, and have some very notable\r\noffice assign’d them by Nature, since in all Insects they are to be found\r\nin one or other form.\r\n\r\nSixthly, at the under part of the face FF, were several of the former sort\r\nof bended Brisles, and below all, the mouth, out of the middle of which,\r\ngrew the _proboscis_ GHI, which, by means of several joints, whereof it\r\nseem’d to consist, the Fly was able to move to and fro, and thrust it in\r\nand out as it pleas’d; the end of this hollow body (which was all over\r\ncover’d with small short hairs or brisles) was, as ’twere, bent at H, and\r\nthe outer or formost side of the bended part HI, slit, as it were, into two\r\nchaps, HI, HI, all the outside of which where cover’d with hairs, and\r\npretty large brisles; these he could, like two chaps, very readily open and\r\nshut, and when he seem’d to suck any thing from the surface of a body, he\r\nwould spread abroad those chaps, and apply the hollow part of them very\r\nclose to it.\r\n\r\nFrom either side of the _Proboscis_, within the mouth, grew two other small\r\nhorns, or fingers, KK, which were hairy, but small in this Figure; but of\r\nanother shape, and bigger in proportion, in the 24. _Scheme_, where they\r\nare marked with GG, which two indeed seem’d a kind of smellers, but whether\r\nso or not, I cannot positively determine.\r\n\r\nThe _Thorax_ or middle part of this Fly, was cas’d, both above and beneath,\r\nwith a very firm crust of armour, the upper part more round, and covered\r\nover with long _conical_ brisles, all whose ends pointed backwards; out of\r\nthe hinder and under part of this grew out in a cluster six leggs, three of\r\nwhich are apparent in the Figure, the other three were hid by the body\r\nplac’d in that posture. The leggs were all much of the same make, being all\r\nof them cover’d with a strong hairy scale or shel, just like the legs of a\r\nCrab or Lobster, and the contrivance of the joints seem’d much the same,\r\neach legg seem’d made up of eight parts, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, to the\r\neighth or last of which, grew the soles and claws, described before in the\r\n38. _Observation_.\r\n\r\nOut of the upper part of this trunk grew the two wings, which I mention’d\r\nin the 38. _Observation_, consisting of a film, extended on certain small\r\nstiff wires or bones: these in a blue Fly, were much longer then the body,\r\nbut in other kind of Flies they are of very differing proportions to the\r\nbody. These films, in many Flies, were so thin, that, like several other\r\nplated bodies (mention’d in the ninth _Observation_) they afforded all\r\nvarieties of fantastical or transient colours (the reason of which I have\r\nhere endeavoured to explain) they seem’d to receive their nourishment from\r\nthe stalks or wires, which seem’d to be hollow, and neer the upper part of\r\nthe wing LL several of them seem’d jointed, the shape of which will\r\nsufficiently appear by the black lines in the second Figure of the 26.\r\n_Scheme_, which is a delineation of one of those wings expanded directly to\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nAll the hinder part of its body is cover’d with a most curious blue shining\r\narmour, looking exactly like a polish’d piece of steel brought to that blue\r\ncolour by annealing, all which armour is very thick bestuck with abundance\r\nof tapering brisles, such as grow on its back, as is visible enough by the\r\nFigure.\r\n\r\nNor was the inside of this creature less beautifull then its outside, for\r\ncutting off a part of the belly, and then viewing it, to see if I could\r\ndiscover any Vessels, such as are to be found in a greater Animals, and\r\neven in Snails exceeding manifestly, I found, much beyond my expectation,\r\nthat there were abundance of branchings of Milk-white vessels, no less\r\ncurious then the branchings of veins and arteries in bigger terrestrial\r\nAnimals, in one of which, I found two notable branches, joining their two\r\nmain stocks, as it were, into one common _ductus_; now, to what veins or\r\narteries these Vessells were _analogus_, whether to the _vena porta_, or\r\nthe _meseraick vessells_, or the like, or indeed, whether they were veins\r\nand arteries, or _vasa lactea_, properly so called, I am not hitherto able\r\nto determine, having not yet made sufficient enquiry; but in all\r\nparticulars, there seems not to be any thing less of curious contrivance in\r\nthese Insects, then in those larger terrestrial Animals, for I had never\r\nseen any more curious branchings of Vessels, then those I observ’d in two\r\nor three of these Flies thus opened.\r\n\r\nIt is a creature active and nimble, so as there are very few creatures like\r\nit, whether bigger or smaller, in so much, that it will scape and avoid a\r\nsmall body, though coming on it exceeding swiftly, and if it sees any thing\r\napproaching it, which it fears, it presently squats down, as it were, that\r\nit may be the more ready for its rise.\r\n\r\nNor is it less hardy in the Winter, then active in the Summer, induring all\r\nthe Frosts, and surviving till the next Summer, notwithstanding the bitter\r\ncold of our Climate; nay, this creature will indure to be frozen, and yet\r\nnot be destroy’d, for I have taken one of them out of the Snow whereon it\r\nhas been frozen almost white, with the Ice about it, and yet by thawing it\r\ngently by the warmth of a fire, it has quickly reviv’d and flown about.\r\n\r\nThis kind of Fly seems by the steams or taste of fermenting and putrifying\r\nmeat (which it often kisses, as ’twere, with its _proboscis_ as it trips\r\nover it) to be stimulated or excited to eject its Eggs or Seed on it,\r\nperhaps, from the same reason as Dogs, Cats, and many other brute creatures\r\nare excited to their particular lusts, by the smell of their females, when\r\nby Nature prepared for generation; the males seeming by those kind of\r\nsmells, or other incitations, to be as much necessitated thereto, as _Aqua\r\nRegis_ strongly impregnated with a solution of Gold, is forced to\r\nprecipitate it by the affusion of spirit of _Urine_, or a solution of\r\n_Salt_ of _Tartar_.\r\n\r\nOne of these put in spirit of _Wine_, was very quickly seemingly kill’d,\r\nand both its eys and mouth began to look very red, but upon the taking of\r\nit out, and suffering it to lie three or four hours, and heating it with\r\nthe Sun beams cast through a Burning-glass, it again reviv’d, seeming, as\r\nit were, to have been all the intermediate time, but dead drunk, and after\r\ncertain hours to grow fresh again and sober.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLIII. _Of the _Water Insect_ or _Gnat_._\r\n\r\nThis little creature, described in the first _Figure_ of the 27. _Scheme_,\r\nwas a small scaled or crusted Animal, which I have often observ’d to be\r\ngenerated in Rain-water; I have also observ’d it both in Pond and\r\nRiver-water. It is suppos’d by some, to deduce its first original from the\r\nputrifaction of Rain-water, in which, if it have stood any time open to the\r\nair, you shall seldom miss, all the Summer long, of store of them frisking\r\ntoo and fro.\r\n\r\n’Tis a creature, wholly differing in shape from any I ever observ’d; nor is\r\nits motion less strange: It has a very large head, in proportion to its\r\nbody, all covered with a shell, like other _testaceous_ Animals, but it\r\ndiffers in this, that it has, up and down several parts of it, several\r\ntufts of hairs, or brisles, plac’d in the order express’d in the Figure; It\r\nhas two horns, which seem’d almost like the horns of an Oxe, inverted, and,\r\nas neer as I could guess, were hollow, with tufts of brisles, likewise at\r\nthe top; these horns they could move easily this or that way, and might,\r\nperchance, be their nostrils. It has a pretty large mouth, which seem’d\r\ncontriv’d much like those of Crabs and Lobsters, by which, I have often\r\nobserv’d them to feed on water, or some imperceptible nutritive substance\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nI could perceive, through the transparent shell, while the Animal surviv’d,\r\nseveral motions in the head, thorax, and belly, very distinctly, of\r\ndiffering kinds which I may, perhaps, elsewhere endeavour more accurately\r\nto examine, and to shew of how great benefit the use of a _Microscope_ may\r\nbe for the discovery of Nature’s course in the operations perform’d in\r\nAnimal bodies, by which we have the opportunity of observing her through\r\nthese delicate and pellucid teguments of the bodies of Insects acting\r\naccording to her usual course and way, undisturbed, whereas, when we\r\nendeavour to pry into her secrets by breaking open the doors upon her, and\r\ndissecting and mangling creatures whil’st there is life yet within them, we\r\nfind her indeed at work, but put into such disorder by the violence\r\noffer’d, as it may easily be imagin’d, how differing a thing we should\r\nfind, if we could, as we can with a _Microscope_ in these smaller\r\ncreatures, quietly peep in at the windows, without frighting her out of her\r\nusual byas.\r\n\r\nThe form of the whole creature, as it appear’d in the _Microscope_, may,\r\nwithout troubling you with more descriptions, be plainly enough perceiv’d\r\nby the _Scheme_, the hinder part or belly consisting of eight several\r\njointed parts, namely, ABCDEFGH, of the first _Figure_, from the midst of\r\neach of which, on either side issued out three or four small brisles or\r\nhairs, I, I, I, I, I, the tail was divided into two parts of very differing\r\nmake; one of them, namely, K, having many tufts of hair or brisles, which\r\nseem’d to serve both for the finns and tail, for the Oars and Ruder of this\r\nlittle creature, wherewith it was able, by frisking and bending its body\r\nnimbly to and fro, to move himself any whither, and to skull and steer\r\nhimself as he pleas’d, the other part, L, seem’d to be, as ’twere, the\r\nninth division of his belly, and had many single brisles on either side.\r\nFrom the end V, of which, through the whole belly, there was a kind of Gut\r\nof a darker colour, MMM, wherein, by certain _Peristaltick_ motions there\r\nwas a kind of black substance mov’d upwards and downwards through it from\r\nthe orbicular part of it, N, (which seem’d the _Ventricle_, or stomach) to\r\nthe tail V, and so back again, which _peristaltick_ motion I have observ’d\r\nalso in a Louse, a Gnat, and several other kinds of transparent body’d\r\nFlies. The _Thorax_ or chest of this creature OOOO, was thick and short,\r\nand pretty transparent, for through it I could see the white heart (which\r\nis the colour also of the bloud in these, and most other Insects) to beat,\r\nand several other kind of motions. It was bestuck and adorn’d up and down\r\nwith several tufts of brisles, such as are pointed out by P, P, P, P, the\r\nhead Q was likewise bestuck with several of those tufts, SSS; it was broad\r\nand short, had two black eyes, TT, which I could not perceive at all\r\npearl’d, as they afterwards appear’d, and two small horns, RR, such as I\r\nformerly describ’d.\r\n\r\nBoth its motion and rest is very strange, and pleasant, and differing from\r\nthose of most other creatures I have observ’d; for, where it ceases from\r\nmoving its body, the tail of it seeming much lighter then the rest of its\r\nbody, and a little lighter then the water it swims in, presently boys it up\r\nto the top of the water, where it hangs suspended with the head always\r\ndownward; and like our _Antipodes_, if they do by a frisk get below that\r\nsuperficies, they presently ascend again unto it, if they cease moving,\r\nuntil they tread, as it were, under that superficies with their tails; the\r\nhanging of these in this posture, put me in mind of a certain creature I\r\nhave seen in _London_, that was brought out of _America_, which would very\r\nfirmly suspend it self by the tail, with the head downwards, and was said\r\nto keep in that posture, with her young ones in her false belly, which is a\r\nPurse, provided by Nature for the production, nutrition, and preservation\r\nof her young ones, which is described by _Piso_ in the 24. Chapter of the\r\nfifth Book of his Natural History of _Brasil_.\r\n\r\nThe motion of it was with the tail forwards, drawing its self backwards, by\r\nthe striking to and fro of that tuft which grew out of one of the stumps of\r\nits tail. It had another motion, which was more sutable to that of other\r\ncreatures, and that is, with the head forward; for by the moving of his\r\nchaps (if I may so call the parts of his mouth) it was able to move it self\r\ndownwards very gently towards the bottom, and did, as ’twere, eat up its\r\nway through the water.\r\n\r\nBut that which was most observable in this creature, was, its Metamorphosis\r\nor change; for having kept several of these Animals in a Glass of\r\nRain-water, in which they were produc’d, I found, after about a fortnight\r\nor three weeks keeping, that several of them flew away in Gnats, leaving\r\ntheir husks behind them in the water floating under the surface, the place\r\nwhere these Animals were wont to reside, whil’st they were inhabitants of\r\nthe water: this made me more diligently to watch them, to see if I could\r\nfind them at the time of their transformation; and not long after, I\r\nobserv’d several of them to be changed into an unusual shape, wholly\r\ndiffering from that they were of before, their head and body being grown\r\nmuch bigger and deeper, but not broader, and their belly, or hinder part\r\nsmaller, and coyl’d, about this great body much of the fashion represented\r\nby the prick’d line in the second _Figure_ of the 27. _Scheme_, the head\r\nand horns now swam uppermost, and the whole bulk of the body seem’d to be\r\ngrown much lighter; for when by my frighting of it, it would by frisking\r\nout of its tail (in the manner express’d in the Figure by BC) sink it self\r\nbelow the surface towards the bottom; the body would more swiftly\r\nre-ascend, then when it was in its former shape.\r\n\r\nI still marked its progress from time to time, and found its body still to\r\ngrow bigger and bigger, Nature, as it were, fitting and accoutring it for\r\nthe lighter Element, of which it was now going to be an inhabitant; for, by\r\nobserving one of these with my _Microscope_, I found the eyes of it to be\r\naltogether differing from what they seem’d before, appearing now all over\r\npearl’d or knobb’d, like the eyes of Gnats, as is visible in the second\r\n_Figure_ by A. At length, I saw part of this creature to swim above, and\r\npart beneath the surface of the water, below which though it would quickly\r\nplunge it self if I by any means frighted it, and presently re-ascend into\r\nits former posture; after a little longer expectation, I found that the\r\nhead and body of a Gnat, began to appear and stand cleer above the surface,\r\nand by degrees it drew out its leggs, first the two formost, then the\r\nother, at length its whole body perfect and entire appear’d out of the husk\r\n(which it left in the water) standing on its leggs upon the top of the\r\nwater, and by degrees it began to move, and after flew about the Glass a\r\nperfect Gnat.\r\n\r\nI have been the more particular, and large in the relation of the\r\ntransformation of divers of these little Animals which I observ’d, because\r\nI have not found that any Authour has observ’d the like, and because the\r\nthing it self is so strange and heterogeneous from the usual progress of\r\nother Animals, that I judge it may not onely be pleasant, but very usefull\r\nand necessary towards the compleating of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed in _Piso_, a very odd History, which this relation may make\r\nthe more probable; and that is in the 2. Chapter of the 4. Book of his\r\nNatural History of _Brasil_, where he says, _Porro præter tot documenta\r\nfertilitatis circa vegetabilia & sensitiva marina telluris æmula, accidit &\r\nillud, quod paucis à Paranambucensi milliaribus, piscatoris uncum citra\r\nintentionem contingat infigi vadis petrosis, & loco piscis spongia,\r\ncoralla, aliasque arbusculas marinas capi. Inter hæc inusitatæ formæ prodit\r\nspongiosa arbuscula sesquipedis longitudinis, brevioribus radicibus,\r\nlapideis nitens vadis, & rupibus infixa, erigiturque in corpus spongiosum\r\nmolle oblongum rotundum turbinatum: intus miris cancellis & alveis\r\nfabricatum, extus autem tenaci glutine instar Apum propolis undique\r\nvestitum, ostio satis patulo & profundo in summitate relicto, sicut ex\r\naltera iconum probe depicta videre licet _(see the third and fourth\r\n_Figures_ of the 27. _Scheme_.)_ Ita ut Apiarium marinum vere dixeris;\r\nprimo enim intuitu è Mare ad Terram delatum, vermiculis scatebat cæruleis\r\nparvis, qui mox à calore solis in Muscas, vel Apes potius, easq; exiguas &\r\nnigras transformebantur, circumvolantesque evanescebant, ita ut de eorum\r\nmellificatione nihil certi conspici datum fuerit, cum tamen cærosa materia\r\npropolis Apumque cellæ manifeste apparerent, atque ipsa mellis qualiscunque\r\nsubstantia proculdubio urinatoribus patebit, ubi curiosius inquisiverint\r\nhæc apiaria, eaque in natali solo & salo diversis temporibus penitius\r\nlustrarint_.\r\n\r\nWhich History contains things sufficiently strange to be consider’d, as\r\nwhether the husk were a Plant, growing at the bottom of the Sea before, of\r\nit self, out of whose putrifaction might be generated these strange kind of\r\nMagots; or whether the seed of certain Bees, sinking to the bottom, might\r\nthere naturally form it self that vegetable hive, and take root; or,\r\nwhether it might not be placed there by some diving Fly; or, whether it\r\nmight not be some peculiar propriety of that Plant, whereby it might ripen\r\nor form its vegetable juice into an Animal substance; or, whether it may\r\nnot be of the nature of a Sponge, or rather a Sponge of the nature of this,\r\naccording to some of those relations and conjectures I formerly made of\r\nthat body, is a matter very difficult to be determined. But indeed, in this\r\ndescription, the Excellent _Piso_ has not been sufficiently particular in\r\nthe setting down the whole process, as it were to be wish’d: There are\r\nindeed very odd progresses in the production of several kinds of Insects,\r\nwhich are not less instructive then pleasant, several of which, the\r\ndiligent _Goedartius_ has carefully observ’d and recorded, but among all\r\nhis Observations, he has none like this, though that of the _Hemerobius_ be\r\nsomewhat of this kind, which is added as an Appendix by _Johannes Mey_.\r\n\r\nI have, for my own particular, besides several of those mention’d by him,\r\nobserv’d divers other circumstances, perhaps, not much taken notice of,\r\nthough very common, which do indeed afford us a very _coercive_ argument to\r\nadmire the goodness and providence of the infinitely wise Creator in his\r\nmost excellent contrivances and dispensations. I have observ’d, at several\r\ntimes of the Summer, that many of the leaves of divers Plants have been\r\nspotted, or, as it were scabbed, and looking on the undersides of those of\r\nthem that have been but a little irregular, I have perceiv’d them to be\r\nsprinkled with divers sorts of little Eggs, which letting alone, I have\r\nfound by degrees to grow bigger, and become little Worms with leggs, but\r\nstill to keep their former places, and those places of the leaves, of their\r\nown accords, to be grown very protuberant upwards, and very hollow, and\r\narched underneath, whereby those young creatures are, as it were, shelter’d\r\nand housed from external injury; divers leaves I have observ’d to grow and\r\nswell so farr, as at length perfectly to inclose the Animal, which, by\r\nother observations I have made, I ghess to contain it, and become, as it\r\nwere a womb to it, so long, till it be fit and prepar’d to be translated\r\ninto another state, at what time, like (what they say of) Vipers, they gnaw\r\ntheir way through the womb that bred them; divers of these kinds I have met\r\nwith upon Goosberry leaves, Rose-tree leaves, Willow leaves, and many other\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThere are often to be found upon Rose-trees and Brier bushes, little red\r\ntufts, which are certain knobs or excrescencies, growing out from the Rind,\r\nor barks of those kinds of Plants, they are cover’d with strange kinds of\r\nthreads or red hairs, which feel very soft, and look not unpleasantly. In\r\nmost of these, if it has no hole in it, you shall find certain little\r\nWorms, which I suppose to be the causes of their production; for when that\r\nWorm has eat its way through, they, having performed what they were\r\ndesign’d by Nature to do, by degrees die and wither away.\r\n\r\nNow, the manner of their production, I suppose to be thus, that the Alwise\r\nCreator has as well implanted in every creature a faculty of knowing what\r\nplace is convenient for the hatching, nutrition, and preservation of their\r\nEggs and of-springs whereby they are stimulated and directed to convenient\r\nplaces, which become, as ’twere the wombs that perform those offices: As he\r\nhas also suited and adapted a property to those places wherby they grow and\r\ninclose those seeds, and having inclosed them, provide a convenient\r\nnourishment for them, but as soon as they have done the office of a womb,\r\nthey die and wither.\r\n\r\nThe progress of inclosure I have often observ’d in leaves, which in those\r\nplaces where those seeds have been cast, have by degrees swell’d and\r\ninclos’d them, so perfectly round, as not to leave any perceptible passage\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFrom this same cause, I suppose that Galls, Oak-apples, and several other\r\nproductions of that kind, upon the branches and leaves of Trees, have their\r\noriginal, for if you open any of them, when almost ripe, you shall find a\r\nlittle Worm in them. Thus, if you open never so many dry Galls, you shall\r\nfind either a hole whereby the Worm has eat its passage out, or if you find\r\nno passage, you may, by breaking or cutting the Gall, find in the middle of\r\nit a small cavity, and in it a small body, which does plainly enough yet\r\nretain a shape, to manifest it once to have been a Worm, though it dy’d by\r\na too early separation from the Oak on which it grew, its navel-string, as\r\n’twere, being broken off from the leaf or branch by which the Globular body\r\nthat invelop’d it, received its nourishment from the Oak.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, if we consider the great care of the Creator in the\r\ndispensations of his providences for the propagation and increase of the\r\nrace, not onely of all kind of Animals, but even of Vegetables, we cannot\r\nchuse but admire and adore him for his Excellencies, but we shall leave off\r\nto admire the creature, or to wonder at the strange kind of acting in\r\nseveral Animals, which seem to favour so much of reason; it seeming to me\r\nmost manifest, that those are but actings according to their structures,\r\nand such operations as such bodies, so compos’d, must necessarily, when\r\nthere are such and such circumstances concurring, perform: thus, when we\r\nfind Flies swarming, about any piece of flesh that does begin a little to\r\nferment; Butterflies about Colworts, and several other leaves, which will\r\nserve to hatch and nourish their young; Gnats, and several other Flies\r\nabout the Waters, and marishy places, or any other creatures, seeking and\r\nplacing their Seeds in convenient repositories, we may, if we attentively\r\nconsider and examine it, find that there are circumstances sufficient, upon\r\nthe supposals of the excellent contrivance of their machine, to excite and\r\nforce them to act after such or such a manner; those steams that rise from\r\nthese several places may, perhaps, set several parts of these little\r\nAnimals at work, even as in the contrivance of killing a Fox or Wolf with a\r\nGun, the moving of a string, is the death of the Animal; for the Beast, by\r\nmoving the flesh that is laid to entrap him, pulls the string which moves\r\nthe trigger, and that lets go the Cock which on the steel strikes certain\r\nsparks of fire which kindle the powder in the pann, and that presently\r\nflies into the barrel, where the powder catching fire rarifies and drives\r\nout the bullet which kills the Animal; in all which actions, there is\r\nnothing of intention or ratiocination to be ascrib’d either to the Animal\r\nor Engine, but all to the ingeniousness of the contriver.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the more immediate consideration of our Gnat: We have in\r\nit an Instance, not usual or common, of a very strange _amphibious_\r\ncreature, that being a creature that inhabits the Air, does yet produce a\r\ncreature, that for some time lives in the water as a Fish, though afterward\r\n(which is as strange) it becomes an inhabitant of the Air, like its Sire,\r\nin the form of a Fly. And this, methinks, does prompt me to propose certain\r\nconjectures, as Queries, having not yet had sufficient opportunity and\r\nleisure to answer them my self from my own Experiments or Observations.\r\n\r\nAnd the first is, Whether all those things that we suppose to be bred from\r\ncorruption and putrifaction, may not be rationally suppos’d to have their\r\norigination as natural as these Gnats, who, ’tis very probable, were first\r\ndropt into this Water, in the form of Eggs. Those Seeds or Eggs must\r\ncertainly be very small, which so small a creature as a Gnat yields, and\r\ntherefore, we need not wonder that we find not the Eggs themselves, some of\r\nthe younger of them, which I have observ’d, having not exceeded a tenth\r\npart of the bulk they have afterwards come to; and next, I have observed\r\nsome of those little ones which must have been generated after the Water\r\nwas inclosed in the Bottle, and therefore most probably from Eggs, whereas\r\nthose creatures have been suppos’d to be bred of the corruption of the\r\nWater, there being not formerly known any probable way how they should be\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nA second is, whether these Eggs are immediately dropt into the Water by the\r\nGnats themselves, or, mediately, are brought down by the falling rain; for\r\nit seems not very improbable, but that those small seeds of Gnats may\r\n(being, perhaps, of so light a nature, and having so great a proportion of\r\nsurface to so small a bulk of body) be ejected into the Air, and so,\r\nperhaps, carried for a good while too and fro in it, till by the drops of\r\nRain it be wash’d out of it.\r\n\r\nA third is, whether multitudes of those other little creatures that are\r\nfound to inhabit the Water for some time, do not, at certain times, take\r\nwing and fly into the Air, others dive and hide themselves in the Earth,\r\nand so contribute to the increase both of the one and the other Element.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Postscript._\r\n\r\nA good while since the writing of this Description, I was presented by\r\nDoctor _Peter Ball_, an ingenious Member of the _Royal Society_, with a\r\nlittle Paper of Nuts, which he told me was sent him from a Brother of his\r\nout of the Countrey, from _Mamhead_ in _Devonshire_, some of them were\r\nloose, having been, as I suppose, broken off, others were still growing\r\nfast on upon the sides of a stick, which seem’d by the bark, pliableness of\r\nit, and by certain strings that grew out of it, to be some piece of the\r\nroot of a Tree; they were all of them dry’d, and a little shrivell’d,\r\nothers more round, of a brown colour; their shape was much like a Figg, but\r\nvery much smaller, some being about the bigness of a Bay-berry, others, and\r\nthe biggest, of a Hazel-Nut. Some of these that had no hole in them, I\r\ncarefully opened with my Knife, and found in them a good large round white\r\nMaggot, almost as bigg as a small Pea, which seem’d shap’d like other\r\nMaggots, but shorter. I could not find them to move, though I ghess’d them\r\nto be alive, because upon pricking them with a Pinn, there would issue out\r\na great deal of white _mucous_ matter, which seem’d to be from a voluntary\r\ncontraction of their skin; their husk or matrix consisted of three Coats,\r\nlike the barks of Trees, the outermost being more rough and spongie, and\r\nthe thickest, the middlemost more close, hard, white, and thin, the\r\ninnermost very thin, seeming almost like the skin within an Egg’s shell.\r\nThe two outermost had root in the branch or stick, but the innermost had no\r\nstem or process, but was onely a skin that cover’d the cavity of the Nut.\r\nAll the Nuts that had no holes eaten in them, I found to contain these\r\nMaggots, but all that had holes, I found empty, the Maggots, it seems,\r\nhaving eaten their way through, taken wings and flown away, as this\r\nfollowing account (which I receiv’d in writing from the same person, as it\r\nwas sent him by his Brother) manifests. _In a moorish black Peaty mould,\r\nwith some small veins of whitish yellow Sands, upon occasion of digging a\r\nhole two or three foot deep, at the head of a Pond or Pool, to set a Tree\r\nin, at that depth, were found, about the end of _October 1663._ in those\r\nvery veins of Sand, those Buttons or Nuts, sticking to a little loose\r\nstick, that is, not belonging to any live Tree, and some of them also free\r\nby themselves._\r\n\r\n_Four or five of which being then open’d, some were found to contain live\r\nInsects come to perfection, most like to flying _Ants_, if not the same; in\r\nothers, Insects, yet imperfect, having but the head and wings form’d, the\r\nrest remaining a soft white pulpy substance._\r\n\r\nNow, as this furnishes us with one odd History more, very agreeable to what\r\nI before hinted, so I doubt not, but were men diligent observers, they\r\nmight meet with multitudes of the same kind, both in the Earth and in the\r\nWater, and in the Air, on Trees, Plants, and other Vegetables, all places\r\nand things being, as it were, _animarum plena_. And I have often, with\r\nwonder and pleasure, in the Spring and Summer time, look’d close to, and\r\ndiligently on, common Garden mould, and in a very small parcel of it, found\r\nsuch multitudes and diversities of little _reptiles_, some in husks, others\r\nonely creepers, many wing’d, and ready for the Air; divers husks or\r\nhabitations left behind empty. Now, if the Earth of our cold Climate be so\r\nfertile of animate bodies, what may we think of the fat Earth of hotter\r\nClimates? Certainly, the Sun may there, by its activity, cause as great a\r\nparcel of Earth to fly on wings in the Air, as it does of Water in steams\r\nand vapours. And what swarms must we suppose to be sent out of those\r\nplentifull inundations of water which are poured down by the sluces of Rain\r\nin such vast quantities? So that we need not much wonder at those\r\ninnumerable clouds of Locusts with which _Africa_, and other hot countries\r\nare so pestred, since in those places are found all the convenient causes\r\nof their production, namely, genitors, or Parents, concurrent receptacles\r\nor matrixes, and a sufficient degree of natural heat and moisture.\r\n\r\nI was going to annex a little draught of the Figure of those Nuts sent out\r\nof _Devonshire_, but chancing to examine Mr. _Parkinson_’s Herbal for\r\nsomething else, and particularly about Galls and Oak-apples, I found among\r\nno less then 24. several kinds of excrescencies of the Oak, which I doubt\r\nnot, but upon examination, will be all found to be the _matrixes_ of so\r\nmany several kinds of Insects; I having observ’d many of them my self to be\r\nso, among 24. several kinds, I say, I found one described and Figur’d\r\ndirectly like that which I had by me, the _Scheme_ is there to be seen, the\r\ndescription, because but short, I have here adjoin’d _Theatri Botanici\r\ntrib. 16. Chap. 2. There groweth at the roots of old Oaks in the\r\nSpring-time, and sometimes also in the very heat of Summer, a peculiar kind\r\nof Mushrom or Excrescence, call’d _Uva Quercina_, swelling out of the\r\nEarth, many growing one close unto another, of the fashion of a Grape, and\r\ntherefore took the name, the _Oak-Grape_, and is of a Purplish colour on\r\nthe outside, and white within like Milk, and in the end of Summer becometh\r\nhard and woody._ Whether this be the very same kind, I cannot affirm, but\r\nboth the Picture and Description come very neer to that I have, but that he\r\nseems not to take notice of the hollowness or Worm, for which ’tis most\r\nobservable. And therefore ’tis very likely, if men did but take notice,\r\nthey might find very many differing Species of these Nuts, _Ovaries_, or\r\n_Matrixes_, and all of them to have much the same designation and office.\r\nAnd I have very lately found several kinds of Excrescencies on Trees and\r\nShrubs, which having endured the Winter, upon opening them, I found most of\r\nthem to contain little Worms, but dead, those things that contain’d them\r\nbeing wither’d and dry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLIV. _Of the tufted or Brush-horn’d _Gnat_._\r\n\r\nThis little creature was one of those multitudes that fill our _English_\r\nair all the time that warm weather lasts, and is exactly of the shape of\r\nthat I observ’d to be generated and hatch’d out of those little Insects\r\nthat wriggle up and down in Rain-water. But, though many were of this form,\r\nyet I observ’d others to be of quite other kinds; nor were all of this or\r\nthe other kind generated out of Water Insects; for whereas I observ’d that\r\nthose that proceeded from those Insects were at their full growth, I have\r\nalso found multitudes of the same shape, but much smaller and tenderer\r\nseeming to be very young ones, creep up and down upon the leaves of Trees,\r\nand flying up and down in small clusters, in places very remote from water;\r\nand this Spring, I observ’d one day, when the Wind was very calm, and the\r\nafternoon very fair, and pretty warm, though it had for a long time been\r\nvery cold weather, and the wind continued still in the East, several small\r\nswarms of them playing to and fro in little clouds in the Sun, each of\r\nwhich were not a tenth part of the bigness of one of these I here have\r\ndelineated, though very much of the same shape, which makes me ghess, that\r\neach of these swarms might be the of-spring of one onely Gnat, which had\r\nbeen hoorded up in some safe repository all this Winter by some provident\r\nParent, and were now, by the warmth of the Spring-air, hatch’d into little\r\nFlies.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, so various, and seemingly irregular are the generations or\r\nproductions of Insects, that he that shall carefully and diligently observe\r\nthe several methods of Nature therein, will have infinitely cause further\r\nto admire the wisdom and providence of the Creator; for not onely the same\r\nkind of creature may be produc’d from several kinds of ways, but the very\r\nsame creature may produce several kinds: For, as divers Watches may be made\r\nout of several materials, which may yet have all the same appearance, and\r\nmove after the same manner, that is, shew the hour equally true, the one as\r\nthe other, and out of the same kind of matter, like Watches, may be wrought\r\ndiffering ways; and, as one and the same Watch may, by being diversly\r\nagitated, or mov’d, by this or that agent, or after this or that manner,\r\nproduce a quite contrary effect: So may it be with these most curious\r\nEngines of Insect’s bodies; the All-wise God of Nature, may have so ordered\r\nand disposed the little _Automatons_, that when nourished, acted, or\r\nenlivened by this cause, they produce one kind of effect, or animate shape,\r\nwhen by another they act quite another way, and another Animal is produc’d.\r\nSo may he so order several materials, as to make them, by several kinds of\r\nmethods, produce similar _Automatons_.\r\n\r\nBut to come to the Description of this Insect, as it appears through a\r\n_Microscope_, of which a representation is made in the 28. _Scheme_. Its\r\nhead A, is exceeding small, in proportion to its body, consisting of two\r\nclusters of pearl’d eyes BB, on each side of its head, whose pearls or\r\neye-balls are curiously rang’d like those of other Flies; between these, in\r\nthe forehead of it, there are plac’d upon two small black balls, CC, two\r\nlong jointed horns, tapering towards the top, much resembling the long\r\nhorns of Lobsters, each of whose stems or quills, DD, were brisled or\r\nbrushed with multitudes of small stiff hairs, issuing out every way from\r\nthe several joints, like the strings or sproutings of the herb\r\n_Horse-tail_, which is oft observ’d to grow among Corn, and for the whole\r\nshape, it does very much resemble those _brushy Vegetables_; besides these,\r\nthere are two other jointed and brisled horns, or feelers, EE, in the\r\nforepart of the head, and a _proboscis_, F, underneath, which in some Gnats\r\nare very long, streight hollow pipes, by which these creatures are able to\r\ndrill and penetrate the skin, and thence, through those pipes suck so much\r\nbloud as to stuff their bellies so full till they be ready to burst.\r\n\r\nThis small head, with its appurtenances, is fastned on by a short neck, G,\r\nto the middle of the _thorax_, which is large, and seems cased with a\r\nstrong black shel, HIK, out of the under part of which, issue six long and\r\nslender legs, LLLLLL, shap’d just like the legs of Flies, but spun or drawn\r\nout longer and slenderer, which could not be express’d in the Figure,\r\nbecause of their great length; and from the upper part, two oblong, but\r\nslender transparent wings, MM, shaped somewhat like those of a Fly,\r\nunderneath each of which, as I have observ’d also in divers sorts of Flies,\r\nand other kinds of Gnats, was placed a small body, N, much resembling a\r\ndrop of some transparent glutinous substance, hardned or cool’d, as it was\r\nalmost ready to fall, for it has a round knob at the end, which by degrees\r\ngrows slenderer into a small stem, and neer the insertion under the wing,\r\nthis stem again grows bigger; these little _Pendulums_, I may so call them,\r\nthe little creature vibrates to and fro very quick when it moves its wings,\r\nand I have sometimes observ’d it to move them also, whil’st the wing lay\r\nstill, but always their motion seem’d to further the motion of the wing\r\nready to follow; of what use they are, as to the moving of the wing, or\r\notherwise, I have not now time to examine.\r\n\r\nIts belly was large, as it is usually in all Insects, and extended into\r\nnine lengths or partitions, each of which was cover’d with round armed\r\nrings or shells; six of which, OPQRST were transparent, and divers kinds of\r\n_Peristaltick_ motions might be very easily perceiv’d, whil’st the Animal\r\nwas alive, but especially a small cleer white part V, seemed to beat like\r\nthe heart of a larger Animal. The last three divisios, WXY, were cover’d\r\nwith black and opacous shells. To conclude, take this creature altogether,\r\nand for beauty and curious contrivances, it may be compared with the\r\nlargest Animal upon the Earth. Nor doth the Alwise Creator seem to have\r\nshewn less care and providence in the fabrick of it, then in those which\r\nseem most considerable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLV. _Of the great Belly’d _Gnat_ or female _Gnat_._\r\n\r\nThe second Gnat, delineated in the twenty ninth _Scheme_, is of a very\r\ndiffering shape from the former; but yet of this sort also, I found several\r\nof the Gnats, that were generated out of the Water Insect: the wings of\r\nthis, were much larger then those of the other, and the belly much bigger,\r\nshorter and of an other shape; and, from several particulars, I ghest it to\r\nbe the Female Gnat, and the former to be the Male.\r\n\r\nThe _thorax_ of this, was much like that of the other, having a very strong\r\nand ridged back-piece, which went also on either side of its leggs; about\r\nthe wings there were several joynted pieces of Armor, which seem’d\r\ncuriously and conveniently contriv’d, for the promoting and strengthning\r\nthe motion of the wings: its head was much differing from the other, being\r\nmuch bigger and neater shap’d, and the horns that grew out between his eyes\r\non two little balls, were of a very differing shape from the tufts of the\r\nother Gnat, these having but a few knots or joynts, and each of those but a\r\nfew, and those short and strong, brisles. The formost horns or feelers,\r\nwere like those of the former Gnat.\r\n\r\nOne of these Gnats I have suffer’d to pierce the skin of my hand, with its\r\n_proboscis_, and thence to draw out as much blood as to fill its belly as\r\nfull as it could hold, making it appear very red and transparent; and this\r\nwithout any further pain, then whilst it was sinking in its _proboscis_, as\r\nit is also in the stinging of Fleas: a good argument, that these creatures\r\ndo not wound the skin, and suck the blood out of enmity and revenge, but\r\nfor meer necessity, and to satisfy their hunger. By what means this\r\ncreature is able to suck, we shall shew in another place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLVI. _Of the white featherwing’d _Moth_ or _Tinea Argentea_._\r\n\r\nThis white long wing’d Moth, which is delineated in the 30. _Scheme_;\r\nafforded a lovely object both to the naked Eye, and through a _Microscope_:\r\nto the Eye it appear’d a small Milk-white Fly with four white Wings, the\r\ntwo formost somewhat longer then the two hindermost, and the two shorter\r\nabout half an Inch long, each of which four Wings seem’d to consist of two\r\nsmall long Feathers, very curiously tufted, or haired on each side, with\r\npurely white, and exceedingly fine and small Haires, proportion’d to the\r\nstalks or stems, out of which they grew, much like the tufts of a long\r\nwing-feather of some Bird, and their stalks or stems were, like those,\r\nbended backwards and downwards, as may be plainly seen by the draughts of\r\nthem in the Figure.\r\n\r\nObserving one of these in my _Microscope_, I found, in the first place,\r\nthat all the Body, Legs, Horns and the Stalks of the Wings, were covered\r\nover with various kinds of curious white Feathers, which did, with handling\r\nor touching, easily rubb off and fly about, in so much that looking on my\r\nFingers, with which I had handled this Moth, and perceiving on them little\r\nwhite specks, I found by my _Microscope_, that they were several of the\r\nsmall Feathers of this little creature, that stuck up and down in the\r\n_rugosities_ of my Skin.\r\n\r\nNext, I found that underneath these Feathers, the pretty Insect was covered\r\nall over with a crusted Shell, like other of those Animals, but with one\r\nmuch thinner and tenderer.\r\n\r\nThirdly, I found, as in Birds also is notable, it had differing and\r\nappropriate kinds of Feathers, that covered several parts of its body.\r\n\r\nFourthly, surveying the parts of its body, with a more accurate and better\r\nMagnifying _Microscope_, I found that the tufts or haires of its Wings were\r\nnothing else but a congeries, or thick set cluster of small _vimina_ or\r\ntwiggs, resembling a small twigg of Birch, stript or whitened, with which\r\nBrushes are usually made, to beat out or brush off the dust from Cloth and\r\nHangings. Every one of the twiggs or branches that composed the Brush of\r\nthe Feathers, appeared in this bigger Magnifying Glass (of which EF which\r\nrepresents ¹⁄₂₄ part of an Inch, is the scale, as G is of the lesser, which\r\nis only ⅓) like the figure D. The Feathers also that covered a part of\r\nhis Body, and were interspersed among the brush of his Wings, I found, in\r\nthe bigger Magnifying Glass, of the shape A, consisting of a stalk or stem\r\nin the middle, and a seeming tuftedness or brushy part on each side. The\r\nFeathers that cover’d most part of his Body and the stalk of his wings,\r\nwere, in the same _Microscope_, much of the figure B, appearing of the\r\nshape of a small Feather, and seemed tufted: those which covered the Horns\r\nand small parts of the Leggs, through the same _Microscope_, appear’d of\r\nthe shape C. Whether the tufts of any or all of these small Feathers,\r\nconsisted of such component particles as the Feathers of Birds, I much\r\ndoubt, because I find that Nature does not alwaies keep, or operate after\r\nthe same method, in smaller and bigger creatures. And of this, we have\r\nparticular Instances in the Wings of several creatures. For whereas, in\r\nBirds of all kinds, it composes each of the Feathers of which its Wing\r\nconsists, of such an exceeding curious and most admirable and stupendious\r\ntexture, as I else-where shew, in the Observations on a Feather; we find it\r\nto alter its method quite, in the fabrick of the Wings of these minute\r\ncreatures, composing some of thin extended membranes or skins, such as the\r\nWings of Dragon-flys; in others, those skins are all over-grown, or pretty\r\nthick bestuck, with short brisles, as in Flesh-flies; in others, those\r\nfilmes are covered, both on the upper and under side, with small Feathers,\r\nplac’d almost like the tyles on a House, and are curiously rang’d and\r\nadorn’d with most lively colours, as is observable in Butter-flies, and\r\nseveral kinds of Moths; In others, instead of their films, Nature has\r\nprovided nothing, but a matter of half a score stalks (if I well remember\r\nthe number; for I have not lately met with any of these flys, and did not,\r\nwhen I first observ’d them, take sufficient notice of divers particulars)\r\nand each of these stalks, with a few single branchings on each side,\r\nresembling much the branched back-bone of a Herring or the like Fish, or a\r\nthin hair’d Peacocks feather, the top or the eye being broken off. With a\r\nfew of these on either side (which it was able to shut up or expand at\r\npleasure, much like a Fann, or rather like the posture of the feathers in a\r\nwing, which ly all one under another, when shut, and by the side of each\r\nother, when expanded) this pretty little grey Moth (for such was the\r\ncreature I observ’d, thus wing’d) could very nimbly, and as it seem’d very\r\neasily move its _corpuscle_, through the Air, from place to place. Other\r\nInsects have their wings cas’d, or cover’d over, with certain hollow\r\nshells, shap’d almost like those hollow Trayes, in which Butchers carry\r\nmeat, whose hollow sides being turn’d downwards, do not only secure their\r\nfolded wings from injury of the earth, in which most of those creatures\r\nreside, but whilst they fly, serves as a help to sustain and bear them up.\r\nAnd these are observable in _Scarabees_ and a multitude of other\r\nterrestrial _crustaceous_ Insects; in which we may yet further observe a\r\nparticular providence of Nature.\r\n\r\nNow in all these kinds of wings, we observe this particular, as a thing\r\nmost worthy remark; that where ever a wing consists of discontinued parts,\r\nthe Pores or _interstitia_ between those parts are very seldom, either much\r\nbigger, or much smaller, then these which we here find between the\r\nparticles of these brushes, so that it should seem to intimate, that the\r\nparts of the Air are such, that they will not easily or readily, if at all,\r\npass through these Pores, so that they seem to be strainers fine enough to\r\nhinder the particles of the Air (whether hinder’d by their bulk, or by\r\ntheir _agitation_, _circulation_, _rotation_ or _undulation_, I shall not\r\nhere determine) from getting through them, and, by that means, serve the\r\nAnimal as well, if not better, then if they were little films. I say, if\r\nnot better, because I have observ’d that all those creatures, that have\r\nfilm’d wings, move them aboundantly quicker and more strongly, such as all\r\nkind of Flies and _Scarabees_ and Batts, then such as have their wings\r\ncovered with feathers, as Butter-flies and Birds, or twiggs, as Moths,\r\nwhich have each of them a much slower motion of their wings; That little\r\nruggedness perhaps of their wings helping them somewhat, by taking better\r\nhold of the parts of the Air, or not suffering them so easily to pass by,\r\nany other way then one.\r\n\r\nBut what ever be the reason of it, ’tis most evident, that the smooth\r\nwing’d Insects, have the strongest Muscles or movent parts of their wings,\r\nand the other much weaker; and this very Insect, we are now describing, had\r\na very small _thorax_ or middle part of his body, if compar’d to the length\r\nand number of his wings; which therefore, as he mov’d them very slowly, so\r\nmust he move them very weakly. And this last propriety do we find somewhat\r\nobserv’d also in bigger kind of Flying creatures, Birds; so that we see\r\nthat the Wisdom and Providence of the All-wise Creator, is not less shewn\r\nin these small despicable creatures, Flies and Moths, which we have branded\r\nwith a name of ignominy, calling them Vermine, then in those greater and\r\nmore remarkable animate bodies, Birds.\r\n\r\nI cannot here stand to add any thing about the nature of flying, though,\r\nperhaps, on another occasion, I may say something on that subject, it being\r\nsuch as may deserve a much more accurate examination and scrutiny then it\r\nhas hitherto met with; For to me there seems nothing wanting to make a man\r\nable to fly, but what may be easily enough supply’d from the Mechanicks\r\nhitherto known, save onely the want of strength, which the Muscles of a man\r\nseem utterly uncapable of, by reason of their smalness and texture, but how\r\neven strength also may be mechanically made, and an artificial Muscle so\r\ncontriv’d, that thereby a man shall be able to exert what strength he\r\npleases, and to regulate it also to his own mind, I may elsewhere endeavour\r\nto manifest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLVII. _Of the _Shepherd Spider_, or long-legg’d _Spider_._\r\n\r\nThe Carter, Shepherd Spider, or long-legg’d Spider, has, for two\r\nparticularities, very few similar creatures that I have met with, the\r\nfirst, which is discoverable onely by the _Microscope_, and is in the first\r\nand second _Figures_ of the 31. _Scheme_, plainly describ’d, is the curious\r\ncontrivance of his eyes, of which (differing from most other Spiders) he\r\nhas onely two, and those plac’d upon the top of a small pillar or hillock,\r\nrising out of the middle of the top of its back, or rather the crown of its\r\nhead, for they were fix’d on the very top of this pillar (which is about\r\nthe heighth of one of the transverse Diameters of the eye, and look’d on in\r\nanother posture, appear’d much of the shape, BCD.) The two eyes, BB, were\r\nplaced back to back, with the transparent parts, or the pupils, looking\r\ntowards either side, but somewhat more forward then backwards. C was the\r\ncolumn or neck on which they stood, and D the crown of the head out of\r\nwhich that neck sprung.\r\n\r\nThese eyes, to appearance, seem’d to be of the very same structure with\r\nthat of larger _binocular_ creatures, seeming to have a very smooth and\r\nvery protuberant _Cornea_, and in the midst of it to have a very black\r\npupil, incompassed about with a kind of grey _Iris_, as appears by the\r\n_Figure_; whether it were able to move these eyes to and fro, I have not\r\nobserv’d, but ’tis not very likely he should, the pillar or neck C, seeming\r\nto be cover’d and stiffen’d with a crusty shell; but Nature, in\r\nprobability, has supply’d that defect, by making the _Cornea_ so very\r\nprotuberant, and setting it so cleer above the shadowing or obstructing of\r\nits prospect by the body, that ’tis likely each eye may perceive, though\r\nnot see distinctly, almost a _Hemisphere_, whence having so small and round\r\na body plac’d upon such long leggs, it is quickly able so to wind, and turn\r\nit, as to see any thing distinct. This creature, as do all other Spiders I\r\nhave yet examin’d, does very much differ from most other Insects in the\r\nFigure of its eyes; for I cannot, with my best _Microscope_, discover its\r\neyes to be any ways knobb’d or pearl’d like those of other Insects.\r\n\r\nThe second Peculiarity which is obvious to the eye, is also very\r\nremarkable, and that is the prodigious length of its leggs, in proportion\r\nto its small round body, each legg of this I drew, being above sixteen\r\ntimes the length of its whole body, and there are some which have them yet\r\nlonger, and others that seem of the same kind, that have them a great deal\r\nshorter; the eight leggs are each of them jointed, just like those of a\r\nCrab, but every of the parts are spun out prodigiously longer in\r\nproportion; each of these leggs are terminated in a small case or shell,\r\nshap’d almost like that of a Musle-shell, as is evident in the third\r\n_Figure_ of the same _Scheme_ (that represents the appearance ot the under\r\npart or belly of the creature) by the shape of the protuberant _conical_\r\nbody, IIII, &c. These are as ’twere plac’d or fasten’d on to the\r\nprotuberant body of the Insect, which is to be suppos’d very high at M,\r\nmaking a kind of blunt cone whereof M is to be suppos’d the _Apex_, about\r\nwhich greater cone of the body, the smaller cones of the leggs are plac’d,\r\neach of them almost reaching to the top in so admirable a manner, as does\r\nnot a little manifest the wisdom of Nature in the contrivance; for these\r\nlong Leavers (as I may so call them) of the legs, having not the advantage\r\nof a long end on the other side of the _hypomochlion_ or centers on which\r\nthe parts of the leggs move, must necessarily require a vast strength to\r\nmove them, and keep the body ballanc’d and suspended, in so much, that if\r\nwe should suppose a man’s body suspended by such a contrivance, an hundred\r\nand fifty times the strength of a man would not keep the body from falling\r\non the breast. To supply therefore each of these leggs with its proper\r\nstrength, Nature has allow’d to each a large Chest or Cell, in which is\r\nincluded a very large and strong Muscle, and thereby this little Animal is\r\nnot onely able to suspend its body upon less then these eight, but to move\r\nit very swiftly over the tops of grass and leaves.\r\n\r\nNor are these eight leggs so prodigiously long, but the ninth, and tenth,\r\nwhich are the two claws, KK, are as short, and serve in steed of a\r\n_proboscis_, for those seem’d very little longer then his mouth; each of\r\nthem had three parts, but very short, the joints KK, which represented the\r\nthird, being longer then both the other. This creature, seems (which I have\r\nseveral times with pleasure observ’d) to throw its body upon the prey,\r\ninsteed of its hands, not unlike a hunting Spider, which leaps like a Cat\r\nat a Mouse. The whole Fabrick was a very pretty one, and could I have\r\ndissected it, I doubt not but I should have found as many singularities\r\nwithin it as without, perhaps, for the most part, not unlike the parts of a\r\nCrab, which this little creature does in many things, very much resemble;\r\nthe curiosity of whose contrivance, I have in another place examin’d. I\r\nomit the description of the horns, AA, of the mouth, LL, which seem’d like\r\nthat of a Crab; the speckledness of his shell, which proceeded from a kind\r\nof feathers or hairs, and the hairiness of his leggs, his large _thorax_\r\nand little belly, and the like, they being manifested by the Figure; and\r\nshall onely take notice that the three parts of the body, namely, the head,\r\nbreast, and belly, are in this creature strangely confus’d, so that ’tis\r\ndifficult to determine which is which, as they are also in a Crab; and\r\nindeed, this seems to be nothing else, but an Air-crab, being made more\r\nlight and nimble, proportionable to the _medium_ wherein it resides; and as\r\nAir seems to have but one thousandth part of the body of Water, so does\r\nthis Spider seem not to be a thousandth part of the bulk of a Crab.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLVIII. _Of the hunting _Spider_, and several other sorts of\r\n_Spiders_._\r\n\r\nThe hunting Spider is a small grey Spider, prettily bespeck’d with black\r\nspots all over its body, which the _Microscope_ discovers to be a kind of\r\nfeathers like those on Butterflies wings, or the body of the white Moth I\r\nlately describ’d. Its gate is very nimble by fits, sometimes running, and\r\nsometimes leaping, like a Grashopper almost, then standing still, and\r\nsetting it self on its hinder leggs, it will very nimbly turn its body, and\r\nlook round it self every way: It has six very conspicuous eyes, two looking\r\ndirectly forwards, plac’d just before; two other, on either side of those,\r\nlooking forward and side-ways; and two other about the middle of the top of\r\nits back or head, which look backwards and side-wards; these seem’d to be\r\nthe biggest. The surface of them all was very black, sphærical, purely\r\npolish’d, reflecting a very cleer and distinct Image of all the ambient\r\nobjects, such as a window, a man’s hand, a white Paper, or the like. Some\r\nother properties of this Spider, observ’d by the most accomplish’d Mr.\r\n_Evelyn_, in his travels in _Italy_, are most emphatically set forth in the\r\nHistory hereunto annexed, which he was pleas’d upon my desire to send me in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n    Of all the sorts of Insects, there is none has afforded me more\r\n    divertisements then the _Venatores_, which are a sort of _Lupi_, that\r\n    have their Denns in the rugged walls, and crevices of our houses; a\r\n    small brown and delicately spotted kind of Spiders, whose hinder leggs\r\n    are longer then the rest.\r\n\r\n    Such I did frequently observe at _Rome_, which espying a Fly at three\r\n    or four yards distance, upon the Balcony (where I stood) would not make\r\n    directly to her, but craul under the Rail, till being arriv’d to the\r\n    _Antipodes_, it would steal up, seldom missing its aim; but if it\r\n    chanced to want any thing of being perfectly opposite, would at first\r\n    peep, immediately slide down again, till taking better notice, it would\r\n    come the next time exactly upon the Fly’s back: But, if this hapn’d not\r\n    to be within a competent leap, then would this Insect move so softly,\r\n    as the very shadow of the Gnomon seem’d not to be more imperceptible,\r\n    unless the Fly mov’d; and then would the Spider move also in the same\r\n    proportion, keeping that just time with her motion, as if the same Soul\r\n    had animated both those little bodies; and whether it were forwards,\r\n    backwards, or to either side, without at all turning her body, like a\r\n    well mannag’d Horse: But, if the capricious Fly took wing, and pitch’d\r\n    upon another place behind our Huntress, then would the Spider whirle\r\n    its body so nimbly about, as nothing could be imagin’d more swift; by\r\n    which means, she always kept the head towards her prey, though to\r\n    appearance, as immovable, as if it had been a Nail driven into the\r\n    Wood, till by that indiscernable progress (being arriv’d within the\r\n    sphere of her reach) she made a fatal leap (swift as Lightning) upon\r\n    the Fly, catching him in the pole, where she never quitted hold till\r\n    her belly was full, and then carried the remainder home. I have beheld\r\n    them instructing their young ones, how to hunt, which they would\r\n    sometimes discipline for not well observing; but, when any of the old\r\n    ones did (as sometimes) miss a leap, they would run out of the field,\r\n    and hide them in their crannies, as asham’d, and haply not be seen\r\n    abroad for four or five hours after; for so long have I watched the\r\n    nature of this strange Insect, the contemplation of whose so wonderfull\r\n    sagacity and address has amaz’d me; nor do I find in any chase\r\n    whatsoever, more cunning and Stratagem observ’d: I have found some of\r\n    these Spiders in my Garden, when the weather (towards the Spring) is\r\n    very hot, but they are nothing so eager of hunting as they are in\r\n    _Italy_.\r\n\r\nThere are multitudes of other sorts of Spiders, whose eyes, and most other\r\nparts and properties, are so exceedingly different both from those I have\r\ndescrib’d, and from one another, that it would be almost endless, at least\r\ntoo long for my present Essay, to describe them, as some with six eyes,\r\nplac’d in quite another order; others with eight eyes; others with fewer,\r\nand some with more. They all seem to be creatures of prey, and to feed on\r\nother small Insects, but their ways of catching them seem very differing:\r\nthe Shepherd Spider by running on his prey; the Hunting Spider by leaping\r\non it, other sorts weave Nets, or Cobwebs, whereby they ensnare them,\r\nNature having both fitted them with materials and tools, and taught them\r\nhow to work and weave their Nets, and to lie perdue, and to watch\r\ndiligently to run on any Fly, as soon as ever entangled.\r\n\r\nTheir thread or web seems to be spun out of some viscous kind of excrement,\r\nlying in their belly, which, though soft when drawn out, is, presently by\r\nreason of its smallness, hardned and dried by the ambient Air. Examining\r\nseveral of which with my _Microscope_, I found them to appear much like\r\nwhite Hors-hair, or some such transparent horny substance, and to be of\r\nvery differing magnitudes; some appearing as bigg as a Pigg’s brisle,\r\nothers equal to a Horss-hair; other no bigger then a man’s hair; others yet\r\nsmaller and finer. I observ’d further, that the radiating chords of the web\r\nwere much bigger, and smoother then those that were woven round, which\r\nseem’d smaller, and all over knotted or pearl’d, with small transparent\r\nGlobules, not unlike small Crystal Beads or seed Pearls, thin strung on a\r\nClew of Silk; which, whether they were so spun by the Spider, or by the\r\nadventitious moisture of a fogg (which I have observ’d to cover all these\r\nfilaments with such Crystalline Beads) I will not now dispute.\r\n\r\nThese threads were some of them so small, that I could very plainly, with\r\nthe _Microscope_, discover the same consecutions of colours as in a\r\n_Prisme_, and they seem’d to proceed from the same cause with those colours\r\nwhich I have already describ’d in thin plated bodies.\r\n\r\nMuch resembling a Cobweb, or a confus’d lock of these Cylinders, is a\r\ncertain white substance which, after a fogg, may be observ’d to fly up and\r\ndown the Air; catching several of these, and examining them with my\r\n_Microscope_, I found them to be much of the same form, looking most like\r\nto a flake of Worsted prepar’d to be spun, though by what means they should\r\nbe generated, or produc’d, is not easily imagined: they were of the same\r\nweight, or very little heavier then the Air; and ’tis not unlikely, but\r\nthat those great white clouds, that appear all the Summer time, may be of\r\nthe same substance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. XLIX. _Of an _Ant_ or _Pismire_._\r\n\r\nThis was a creature, more troublesome to be drawn, then any of the rest, for\r\nI could not, for a good while, think of a way to make it suffer its body to\r\nly quiet in a natural posture; but whil’st it was alive, if its feet were\r\nfetter’d in Wax or Glew, it would so twist and wind its body, that I could\r\nnot any wayes get a good view of it; and if I killed it, its body was so\r\nlittle, that I did often spoil the shape of it, before I could throughly\r\nview it: for this is the nature of these minute Bodies, that as soon,\r\nalmost, as ever their life is destroy’d, their parts immediately shrivel,\r\nand lose their beauty; and so is it also with small Plants, as I instanced\r\nbefore, in the description of Moss. And thence also is the reason of the\r\nvariations in the beards of wild Oats, and in those of Musk-grass seed,\r\nthat their bodies, being exceeding small, those small variations which are\r\nmade in the surfaces of all bodies, almost upon every change of Air,\r\nespecially if the body be porous, do here become sensible, where the whole\r\nbody is so small, that it is almost nothing but surface; for as in\r\nvegetable substances, I see no great reason to think, that the moisture of\r\nthe Aire (that, sticking to a wreath’d beard, does make it untwist) should\r\nevaporate, or exhale away, any faster then the moisture of other bodies,\r\nbut rather that the avolation from, or access of moisture to, the surfaces\r\nof bodies being much the same, those bodies become most sensible of it,\r\nwhich have the least proportion of body to their surface. So is it also\r\nwith Animal substances; the dead body of an Ant, or such little creature,\r\ndoes almost instantly shrivel and dry, and your object shall be quite\r\nanother thing, before you can half delineate it, which proceeds not from\r\nthe extraordinary exhalation, but from the small proportion of body and\r\njuices, to the usual drying of bodies in the Air, especially if warm. For\r\nwhich inconvenience, where I could not otherwise remove it, I thought of\r\nthis expedient.\r\n\r\nI took the creature, I had design’d to delineate, and put it into a drop of\r\nvery well rectified spirit of Wine, this I found would presently dispatch,\r\nas it were, the Animal, and being taken out of it, and lay’d on a paper,\r\nthe spirit of Wine would immediately fly away, and leave the Animal dry, in\r\nits natural posture, or at least, in a constitution, that it might easily\r\nwith a pin be plac’d, in what posture you desired to draw it, and the limbs\r\nwould so remain, without either moving, or shriveling. And thus I dealt\r\nwith this Ant, which I have here delineated, which was one of many, of a\r\nvery large kind, that inhabited under the Roots of a Tree, from whence they\r\nwould sally out in great parties, and make most grievous havock of the\r\nFlowers and Fruits, in the ambient Garden, and return back again very\r\nexpertly, by the same wayes and paths they went.\r\n\r\nIt was more then half the bigness of an Earwig, of a dark brown, or reddish\r\ncolour, with long legs, on the hinder of which it would stand up, and raise\r\nits head as high as it could above the ground, that it might stare the\r\nfurther about it, just after the same manner as I have also observ’d a\r\nhunting Spider to do: and putting my finger towards them, they have at\r\nfirst all run towards it, till almost at it; and then they would stand\r\nround about it, at a certain distance, and smell, as it were, and consider\r\nwhether they should any of them venture any further, till one more bold\r\nthen the rest venturing to climb it, all the rest, if I would have suffered\r\nthem, would have immediately followed: many such other seemingly rational\r\nactions I have observ’d in this little Vermine with much pleasure, which\r\nwould be too long to be here related; those that desire more of them may\r\nsatisfie their curiosity in _Ligons_ History of the _Barbadoes_.\r\n\r\nHaving insnar’d several of these into a small Box, I made choice of the\r\ntallest grown among them, and separating it from the rest, I gave it a Gill\r\nof Brandy, or Spirit of Wine, which after a while e’en knock’d him down\r\ndead drunk, so that he became moveless, though at first putting in he\r\nstruggled for a pretty while very much, till at last, certain bubbles\r\nissuing out of its mouth, it ceased to move; this (because I had before\r\nfound them quickly to recover again, if they were taken out presently) I\r\nsuffered to lye above an hour in the Spirit; and after I had taken it out,\r\nand put its body and legs into a natural posture, remained moveless about\r\nan hour; but then, upon a sudden, as if it had been awaken out of a drunken\r\nsleep, it suddenly reviv’d and ran away; being caught, and serv’d as\r\nbefore, he for a while continued struggling and striving, till at last\r\nthere issued several bubbles out of its mouth, and then, _tanquam animam\r\nexpirasset_, he remained moveless for a good while; but at length again\r\nrecovering, it was again redipt, and suffered to lye some hours in the\r\nSpirit; notwithstanding which, after it had layen dry some three or four\r\nhours, it again recovered life and motion: Which kind of Experiments, if\r\nprosecuted, which they highly deserve, seem to me of no inconsiderable use\r\ntowards the invention of the _Latent Scheme_, (as the Noble _Verulam_ calls\r\nit) or the hidden, unknown Texture of Bodies.\r\n\r\nOf what Figure this Creature appear’d through the _Microscope_, the 32.\r\n_Scheme_ (though not so carefully graven as it ought) will represent to the\r\neye, namely, That it had a large head AA, at the upper end of which were\r\ntwo protuberant eyes, pearl’d like those of a Fly, but smaller BB; out of\r\nthe Nose, or foremost part, issued two horns CC, of a shape sufficiently\r\ndiffering from those of a blew Fly, though indeed they seem to be both the\r\nsame kind of Organ, and to serve for a kind of smelling; beyond these were\r\ntwo indented jaws DD, which he open’d side-wayes, and was able to gape them\r\nasunder very wide; and the ends of them being armed with teeth, which\r\nmeeting went between each other, it was able to grasp and hold a heavy\r\nbody, three or four times the bulk and weight of its own body: It had only\r\nsix legs, shap’d like those of a Fly, which, as I shewed before, is an\r\nArgument that it is a winged Insect, and though I could not perceive any\r\nsign of them in the middle part of its body (which seem’d to consist of\r\nthree joints or pieces EFG, out of which sprung two legs), yet ’tis known\r\nthat there are of them that have long wings, and fly up and down in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThe third and last part of its body III was bigger and larger then the\r\nother two, unto which it was joyn’d by a very small middle, and had a kind\r\nof loose shell, or another distinct part of its body H, which seem’d to be\r\ninterpos’d, and to keep the _thorax_ and belly from touching.\r\n\r\nThe whole body was cas’d over with a very strong armour, and the belly III\r\nwas covered likewise with multitudes of small white shining brisles; the\r\nlegs, horns, head, and middle parts of its body were bestuck with hairs\r\nalso, but smaller and darker.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. L. _Of the wandring _Mite_._\r\n\r\nIn _September_ and _October, 1661._ I observ’d in _Oxford_ several of these\r\nlittle pretty Creatures to wander to and fro, and often to travel over the\r\nplains of my Window. And in _September_ and _October, 1663._ I observ’d\r\nlikewise several of these very same Creatures traversing a window at\r\n_London_, and looking without the window upon the subjacent wall, I found\r\nwhole flocks of the same kind running to and fro among the small groves and\r\nthickets of green moss, and upon the curiously spreading vegetable blew or\r\nyellow moss, which is a kind of a Mushrome or Jews-ear.\r\n\r\nThese Creatures to the naked eye seemed to be a kind of black Mite, but\r\nmuch nimbler and stronger then the ordinary Cheese-Mites; but examining\r\nthem in a _Microscope_, I found them to be a very fine crusted or shell’d\r\nInsect, much like that represented in the first Figure of the three and\r\nthirtieth _Scheme_, with a protuberant oval shell A, indented or pitted\r\nwith an abundance of small pits, all covered over with little white\r\nbrisles, whose points all directed backwards.\r\n\r\nIt had eight legs, each of them provided with a very sharp tallon, or claw\r\nat the end, which this little Animal, in its going, fastned into the pores\r\nof the body over which it went. Each of these legs were bestuck in every\r\njoynt of them with multitudes of small hairs, or (if we respect the\r\nproportion they bore to the bigness of the leg) turnpikes, all pointing\r\ntowards the claws.\r\n\r\nThe _Thorax_, or middle parts of the body of this Creature, was exceeding\r\nsmall, in respect both of the head and belly, it being nothing but that\r\npart which was covered by the two shells BB, though it seem’d to grow\r\nthicker underneath: And indeed, if we consider the great variety Nature\r\nuses in proportioning the three parts of the body, (the _Head_, _Thorax_,\r\nand _Belly_) we shall not wonder at the small proportion of this _Thorax_,\r\nnor at the vaster bulk of the belly, for could we exactly anatomise this\r\nlittle Creature, and observe the particular designs of each part, we should\r\ndoubtless, as we do in all her more manageable and tractable fabricks, find\r\nmuch more reason to admire the excellency of her contrivance and\r\nworkmanship, then to wonder, it was not made otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe head of this little Insect was shap’d somewhat like a Mite’s, that is,\r\nit had a long snout, in the manner of a Hogs, with a knobbed ridge running\r\nalong the middle of it, which was bestuck on either side with many small\r\nbrisles, all pointing forward, and two very large pikes or horns, which\r\nrose from the top of the head, just over each eye, and pointed forward\r\nalso. It had two pretty large black eyes on either side of the head EE,\r\nfrom one of which I could see a very bright reflection of the window, which\r\nmade me ghess, that the _Cornea_ of it was smooth, like those of bigger\r\nInsects. Its motion was pretty quick and strong, it being able very easily\r\nto tumble a stone or clod four times as big as its whole body.\r\n\r\nAt the same time and place, and divers times since, I have observed with my\r\n_Microscope_, another little Insect, which, though I have not annexed the\r\npicture of, may be worth noting, for its exceeding nimbleness as well as\r\nsmalness; it was as small as a Mite, with a body deep and ridged, almost\r\nlike a Flea; it had eight blood-red legs, not very long, but slender; and\r\ntwo horns or feelers before. Its motion was so exceeding quick, that I have\r\noften lost sight of one I have observed with my naked eye; and though, when\r\nit was not frighted, I was able to follow the motions of some with my\r\n_Microscope_; yet if it were never so little startled, it posted away with\r\nsuch speed, and turn’d and winded it self so quick, that I should presently\r\nlose sight of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I first observ’d the former of these Insects, or Mites, I began to\r\nconjecture, that certainly I had found out the vagabond Parents of those\r\nMites we find in Cheeses, Meal, Corn, Seeds, musty Barrels, musty Leather,\r\n&c. these little Creatures, wandring to and fro every whither, might\r\nperhaps, as they were invited hither and thither by the musty steams of\r\nseveral putrifying bodies, make their invasions upon those new and pleasing\r\nterritories, and there spending the remainder of their life, which might be\r\nperhaps a day, or thereabouts, in very plentiful and riotous living, might\r\nleave their offspring behind them, which by the change of the soil and\r\nCountry they now inhabite, might be quite alter’d from the hew of their\r\n_primogenitors_, and, like _Mores_ translated into Northern _European_\r\nClimates, after a little time, change both their skin and shape. And this\r\nseems yet more probable in these Insects, because that the soil or body\r\nthey inhabit, seems to be almost half their parent, for it not only hatches\r\nand brings those little eggs, or seminal principles, to perfection, but\r\nseems to augment and nourish them also before they are hatch’d or shaped;\r\nfor it is obvious enough to be observ’d, that the eggs of many other\r\nInsects, and particularly of Mites, are increas’d in bulk after they are\r\nlaid out of the bodies of the Insects, and plump’d sometimes into many\r\ntimes their former bigness, so that the bodies they are laid in being, as\r\nit were, half their mothers, we shall not wonder that it should have such\r\nan active power to change their forms. We find by relations how much the\r\n_Negro_ Women do besmeer the of-spring of the _Spaniard_, bringing forth\r\nneither white-skinn’d nor black, but tawny hided _Mulattos_.\r\n\r\nNow, though I propound this as probable, I have not yet been so farr\r\ncertify’d by Observations as to conclude any thing, either positively or\r\nnegatively, concerning it. Perhaps, some more lucky diligence may please\r\nthe curious Inquirer with the discovery of this, to be a truth, which I now\r\nconjecture, and may thereby give him a satisfactory account of the cause of\r\nthose creatures, whose original seems yet so obscure, and may give him\r\ncause to believe, that many other animate beings, that seem also to be the\r\nmere product of putrifaction, may be innobled with a Pedigree as antient as\r\nthe first creation, and farr exceed the greatest beings in their numerous\r\nGenealogies. But on the other side, if it should be found that these, or\r\nany other animate body, have no immediate similar Parent, I have in another\r\nplace set down a conjectural _Hypothesis_ whereby those _Phænomena_ may\r\nlikely enough be solv’d, wherein the infinite wisdom and providence of the\r\nCreator is no less rare and wonderfull.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LI. _Of the _Crab-like_ Insect._\r\n\r\nReading one day in _Septemb._ I chanced to observe a very smal creature\r\ncreep over the Book I was reading, very slowly; having a _Microscope_ by\r\nme, I observ’d it to be a creature of a very unusual form, and that not\r\nless notable; such as is describ’d in the second _Figure_ of the 33.\r\n_Scheme_. It was about the bigness of a large Mite, or somewhat longer, it\r\nhad ten legs, eight of which, AAAA, were topt with very sharp claws, and\r\nwere those upon which he walk’d, seeming shap’d much like those of a Crab,\r\nwhich in many other things also this little creature resembled; for the two\r\nother claws, BB, which were the formost of all the ten, and seem’d to grow\r\nout of his head, like the horns of other Animals, were exactly form’d in\r\nthe manner of Crabs or Lobsters claws, for they were shap’d and jointed\r\nmuch like those represented in the _Scheme_ and the ends of them were\r\nfurnish’d with a pair of claws or pincers, CC, which this little animal did\r\nopen and shut at pleasure: It seem’d to make use of those two horns or\r\nclaws both for feelers and holders; for in its motion it carried these\r\naloft extended before, moving them to and fro, just as a man blindfolded\r\nwould do his hands when he is fearfull of running against a wall, and if I\r\nput a hair to it, it would readily take hold of it with these claws, and\r\nseem to hold it fast. Now, though these horns seem’d to serve him for two\r\nuses, namely, for feeling and holding; yet he seem’d neither blind, having\r\ntwo small black spots, DD, which by the make of them, and the bright\r\nreflection from them seem’d to be his eyes, nor did it want other hands,\r\nhaving another pair of claws, EE, very neer plac’d to its mouth, and seem’d\r\nadjoining to it.\r\n\r\nThe whole body was cased over with armour-shells, as is usuall in all those\r\nkinds of _crustaceous_ creatures, especially about their bellies, and\r\nseem’d of three kinds, the head F seem’d cover’d with a kind of scaly\r\nshell, the _thorax_ with two smooth shells, or Rings, GG, and the belly\r\nwith eight knobb’d ones. I could not certainly find whether it had under\r\nthese last shells any wings, but I suspect the contrary; for I have not\r\nfound any wing’d Insect with eight leggs, two of those leggs being always\r\nconverted into wings, and, for the most part, those that have but six, have\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThis creature, though I could never meet with more then one of them, and so\r\ncould not make so many examinations of it as otherwise I would, I did\r\nnotwithstanding, by reason of the great curiosity that appear’d to me in\r\nits shape, delineate it, to shew that, in all likelihood, Nature had\r\ncrouded together into this very minute Insect, as many, and as excellent\r\ncontrivances, as into the body of a very large Crab, which exceeds it in\r\nbulk, perhaps, some Millions of times; for as to all the apparent parts,\r\nthere is a greater rather then a less multiplicity of parts, each legg has\r\nas many parts, and as many joints as a Crabs, nay, and as many hairs or\r\nbrisles; and the like may be in all the other visible parts; and ’tis very\r\nlikely, that the internal curiosities are not less excellent: It being a\r\ngeneral rule in Nature’s proceedings, that where she begins to display any\r\nexcellency, if the subject be further search’d into, it will manifest, that\r\nthere is not less curiosity in those parts which our single eye cannot\r\nreach, then in those which are more obvious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LII. _Of the small Silver-colour’d _Book-worm_._\r\n\r\nAs among greater Animals there are many that are scaled, both for ornament\r\nand defence, so are there not wanting such also among the lesser bodies of\r\nInsects, whereof this little creature gives us an Instance. It is a small\r\nwhite Silver-shining Worm or Moth, which I found much conversant among\r\nBooks and Papers, and is suppos’d to be that which corrodes and eats holes\r\nthrough the leaves and covers; it appears to the naked eye, a small\r\nglittering Pearl-colour’d Moth, which upon the removing of Books and Papers\r\nin the Summer, is often observ’d very nimbly to scud, and pack away to some\r\nlurking cranney, where it may the better protect itself from any appearing\r\ndangers. Its head appears bigg and blunt, and its body tapers from it\r\ntowards the tail, smaller and smaller, being shap’d almost like a Carret.\r\n\r\nThis the _Microscopical_ appearance will more plainly manifest, which\r\nexhibits, in the third _Figure_ of the 33. _Scheme_, a conical body,\r\ndivided into fourteen several partitions, being the appearance of so many\r\nseveral shels, or shields that cover the whole body, every of these shells\r\nare again cover’d or tiled over with a multitude of thin transparent\r\nscales, which, from the multiplicity of their reflecting surfaces, make the\r\nwhole Animal appear of a perfect Pearl-colour.\r\n\r\nWhich, by the way, may hint us the reason of that so much admired\r\nappearance of those so highly esteem’d bodies, as also of the like in\r\nmother of Pearl shells, and in multitudes of other shelly Sea-substances;\r\nfor they each of them consisting of an infinite number of very thin shells\r\nor laminated orbiculations, cause such multitudes of reflections, that the\r\ncompositions of them together with the reflections of others that are so\r\nthin as to afford colours (of which I elsewhere give the reason) gives a\r\nvery pleasant reflection of light. And that this is the true cause, seems\r\nlikely, first, because all those so appearing bodies are compounded of\r\nmultitudes of plated substances. And next that, by ordering any trasparent\r\nsubstance after this manner, the like _Phænomena_ may be produc’d; this\r\nwill be made very obvious by the blowing of Glass into exceeding thin\r\nshells, and then breaking them into scales, which any lamp-worker will\r\npresently do; for a good quantity of these scales, laid in a heap together,\r\nhave much the same resemblance of Pearls. Another way, not less instructive\r\nand pleasant, is a way which I have several times done, which is by working\r\nand tossing, as ’twere, a parcel of pure crystalline glass whilst it is\r\nkept glowing hot in the blown flame of a Lamp, for, by that means, that\r\npurely transparent body will be so divided into an infinite number of\r\nplates, or small strings, with interpos’d aerial plates and _fibres_, that\r\nfrom the multiplicity of the reflections from each of those internal\r\nsurfaces, it may be drawn out into curious Pearl-like or Silver wire, which\r\nthough small, will yet be opacous; the same thing I have done with a\r\ncomposition of red _Colophon_ and _Turpentine_, and a little Bee’s Wax, and\r\nmay be done likewise with Birdlime, and such like glutinous and transparent\r\nbodies: But to return to our description.\r\n\r\nThe small blunt head of this Insect was furnish’d on either side of it with\r\na cluster of eyes, each of which seem’d to contain but a very few, in\r\ncomparison of what I had observ’d the clusters of other Insects to abound\r\nwith; each of these clusters were beset with a row of small brisles, much\r\nlike the _cilia_ or hairs on the eye-lids, and, perhaps, they serv’d for\r\nthe same purpose. It had two long horns before, which were streight, and\r\ntapering towards the top, curiously ring’d or knobb’d, and brisled much\r\nlike the Marsh Weed, call’d Horse-tail, or Cats-tail, having at each knot a\r\nfring’d Girdle, as I may so call it, of smaller hairs, and several bigger\r\nand larger brisles, here and there dispers’d among them: besides these, it\r\nhad two shorter horns, or feelers, which were knotted and fring’d, just as\r\nthe former, but wanted brisles, and were blunt at the ends; the hinder part\r\nof the creature was terminated with three tails, in every particular\r\nresembling the two longer horns that grew out of the head: The leggs of it\r\nwere scal’d and hair’d much like the rest, but are not express’d in this\r\n_Figure_, the Moth being intangled all in Glew, and so the leggs of this\r\nappear’d not through the Glass which looked perpendicularly upon the back.\r\n\r\nThis Animal probably feeds upon the Paper and covers of Books, and\r\nperforates in them several small round holes, finding, perhaps, a\r\nconvenient nourishment in those husks of Hemp and Flax, which have pass’d\r\nthrough so many scourings, washings, dressings and dryings, as the parts of\r\nold Paper must necessarily have suffer’d; the digestive faculty, it seems,\r\nof these little creatures being able yet further to work upon those\r\nstubborn parts, and reduce them into another form.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, when I consider what a heap of Saw-dust or chips this little\r\ncreature (which is one of the teeth of Time) conveys into its intrals, I\r\ncannot chuse but remember and admire the excellent contrivance of Nature,\r\nin placing in Animals such a fire, as is continually nourished and supply’d\r\nby the materials convey’d into the stomach, and _fomented_ by the bellows\r\nof the lungs; and in so contriving the most admirable fabrick of Animals,\r\nas to make the very spending and wasting of that fire, to be instrumental\r\nto the procuring and collecting more materials to augment and cherish it\r\nself, which indeed seems to be the principal end of all the contrivances\r\nobservable in bruit Animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LIII. _Of a _Flea_._\r\n\r\nThe strength and beauty of this small creature, had it no other relation at\r\nall to man, would deserve a description.\r\n\r\nFor its strength, the _Microscope_ is able to make no greater discoveries\r\nof it then the naked eye, but onely the curious contrivance of its leggs\r\nand joints, for the exerting that strength, is very plainly manifested,\r\nsuch as no other creature, I have yet observ’d, has any thing like it; for\r\nthe joints of it are so adapted, that he can, as ’twere, fold them short\r\none within another, and suddenly stretch, or spring them out to their whole\r\nlength, that is, of the fore-leggs, the part A, of the 34. _Scheme_, lies\r\nwithin B, and B within C, parallel to, or side by side each other; but the\r\nparts of the two next, lie quite contrary, that is, D without E, and E\r\nwithout F, but parallel also; but the parts of the hinder leggs, G, H and\r\nI, bend one within another, like the parts of a double jointed Ruler, or\r\nlike the foot, legg and thigh of a man; these six leggs he clitches up\r\naltogether, and when he leaps, springs them all out, and thereby exerts his\r\nwhole strength at once.\r\n\r\nBut, as for the beauty of it, the _Microscope_ manifests it to be all over\r\nadorn’d with a curiously polish’d suit of _sable_ Armour, neatly jointed,\r\nand beset with multitudes of sharp pinns, shap’d almost like Porcupine’s\r\nQuills, or bright conical Steel-bodkins; the head is on either side\r\nbeautify’d with a quick and round black eye K, behind each of which also\r\nappears a small cavity, L, in which he seems to move to and fro a certain\r\nthin film beset with many small transparent hairs, which probably may be\r\nhis ears; in the forepart of his head, between the two fore-leggs, he has\r\ntwo small long jointed feelers, or rather smellers, MM, which have four\r\njoints, and are hairy, like those of several other creatures; between\r\nthese, it has a small _proboscis_, or _probe_, NNO, that seems to consist\r\nof a tube NN, and a tongue or sucker O, which I have perceiv’d him to slip\r\nin and out. Besides these, it has also two chaps or biters PP, which are\r\nsomewhat like those of an Ant, but I could not perceive them tooth’d; these\r\nwere shap’d very like the blades of a pair of round top’d Scizers, and were\r\nopened and shut just after the same manner; with these Instruments does\r\nthis little busie Creature bite and pierce the skin, and suck out the blood\r\nof an Animal, leaving the skin inflamed with a small round red spot. These\r\nparts are very difficult to be discovered, because, for the most part, they\r\nlye covered between the fore-legs. There are many other particulars, which,\r\nbeing more obvious, and affording no great matter of information, I shall\r\npass by, and refer the Reader to the Figure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LIV. _Of a Louse._\r\n\r\nThis is a Creature so officious, that ’twill be known to every one at one\r\ntime or other, so busie, and so impudent, that it will be intruding it self\r\nin every ones company, and so proud and aspiring withall, that it fears not\r\nto trample on the best, and affects nothing so much as a Crown; feeds and\r\nlives very high, and that makes it so saucy, as to pull any one by the ears\r\nthat comes in its way, and will never be quiet till it has drawn blood: it\r\nis troubled at nothing so much as at a man that scratches his head, as\r\nknowing that man is plotting and contriving some mischief against it, and\r\nthat makes it oftentime sculk into some meaner and lower place, and run\r\nbehind a mans back, though it go very much against the hair; which ill\r\nconditions of it having made it better known then trusted, would exempt me\r\nfrom making any further description of it, did not my faithful _Mercury_,\r\nmy _Microscope_, bring me other information of it. For this has discovered\r\nto me, by means of a very bright light cast on it, that it is a Creature of\r\na very odd shape; it has a head shap’d like that exprest in 35. _Scheme_\r\nmarked with A, which seems almost Conical, but is a little flatted on the\r\nupper and under sides, at the biggest part of which, on either side behind\r\nthe head (as it were, being the place where other Creatures ears stand) are\r\nplaced its two black shining goggle eyes BB, looking backwards, and fenced\r\nround with several small _cilia_, or hairs that incompass it, so that it\r\nseems this Creature has no very good foresight: It does not seem to have\r\nany eye-lids, and therefore perhaps its eyes were so placed, that it might\r\nthe better cleanse them with its fore-legs; and perhaps this may be the\r\nreason, why they so much avoid and run from the light behind them, for\r\nbeing made to live in the shady and dark recesses of the hair, and thence\r\nprobably their eye having a great aperture, the open and clear light,\r\nespecially that of the Sun, must needs very much offend them; to secure\r\nthese eyes from receiving any injury from the hairs through which it\r\npasses, it has two horns that grow before it, in the place where one would\r\nhave thought the eyes should be; each of these CC hath four joynts, which\r\nare fringed, as ’twere, with small brisles, from which to the tip of its\r\nsnout D, the head seems very round and tapering, ending in a very sharp\r\nnose D, which seems to have a small hole, and to be the passage through\r\nwhich he sucks the blood. Now whereas if it be plac’d on its back, with its\r\nbelly upwards, as it is in the 35. _Scheme_, it seems in several Positions\r\nto have a resemblance of chaps, or jaws, as is represented in the Figure by\r\nEE, yet in other postures those dark strokes disappear; and having kept\r\nseveral of them in a box for two or three dayes, so that for all that time\r\nthey had nothing to feed on, I found, upon letting one creep on my hand,\r\nthat it immediately fell to sucking, and did neither seem to thrust its\r\nnose very deep into the skin, nor to open any kind of mouth, but I could\r\nplainly perceive a small current of blood, which came directly from its\r\nsnout, and past into its belly; and about A there seem’d a contrivance,\r\nsomewhat resembling a Pump, pair of Bellows, or Heart, for by a very swift\r\n_systole_ and _diastole_ the blood seem’d drawn from the nose, and forced\r\ninto the body. It did not seem at all, though I viewed it a good while as\r\nit was sucking, to thrust more of its nose into the skin then the very\r\nsnout D, nor did it cause the least discernable pain, and yet the blood\r\nseem’d to run through its head very quick and freely, so that it seems\r\nthere is no part of the skin but the blood is dispers’d into, nay, even\r\ninto the _cuticula_; for had it thrust its whole nose in from D to CC, it\r\nwould not have amounted to the supposed thickness of that _tegument_, the\r\nlength of the nose being not more then a three hundredth part of an inch.\r\nIt has six legs, covered with a very transparent shell, and joynted exactly\r\nlike a Crab’s, or Lobster’s; each leg is divided into six parts by these\r\njoynts, and those have here and there several small hairs; and at the end\r\nof each leg it has two claws, very properly adapted for its peculiar use,\r\nbeing thereby inabled to walk very securely both on the skin and hair; and\r\nindeed this contrivance of the feet is very curious, and could not be made\r\nmore commodiously and compendiously, for performing both these requisite\r\nmotions, of walking and climbing up the hair of a mans head, then it is:\r\nfor, by having the lesser claw (a) set so much short of the bigger (b) when\r\nit walks on the skin the shorter touches not, and then the feet are the\r\nsame with those of a Mite, and several other small Insects, but by means of\r\nthe small joynts of the longer claw it can bend it round, and so with both\r\nclaws take hold of a hair, in the manner represented in the Figure, the\r\nlong transparent Cylinder FFF, being a Man’s hair held by it.\r\n\r\nThe _Thorax_ seem’d cas’d with another kind of substance then the belly,\r\nnamely, with a thin transparent horny substance, which upon the fasting of\r\nthe Creature did not grow flaccid; through this I could plainly see the\r\nblood, suck’d from my hand, to be variously distributed, and mov’d to and\r\nfro; and about G there seem’d a pretty big white substance, which seem’d to\r\nbe moved within its _thorax_; besides, there appear’d very many small\r\nmilk-white vessels, which crost over the breast between the legs, out of\r\nwhich, on either side, were many small branchings, these seem’d to be the\r\nveins and arteries, for that which is analogus to blood in all Insects is\r\nmilk-white.\r\n\r\nThe belly is covered with a transparent substance likewise, but more\r\nresembling a skin then a shell, for ’tis grain’d all over the belly just\r\nlike the skin in the palms of a man’s hand, and when the belly is empty,\r\ngrows very flaccid and wrinkled; at the upper end of this is placed the\r\nstomach HH, and perhaps also the white spot II may be the liver or\r\n_pancreas_, which, by the _peristalick_ motion of the guts, is a little\r\nmov’d to and fro, not with a _systole_ and _diastole_, but rather with a\r\nthronging or justling motion. Viewing one of these Creatures, after it had\r\nfasted two dayes, all the hinder part was lank and flaccid, and the white\r\nspot II hardly mov’d, most of the white branchings disappear’d, and most\r\nalso of the redness or sucked blood in the guts, the _peristaltick_ motion\r\nof which was scarce discernable; but upon the suffering it to suck, it\r\npresently fill’d the skin of the belly, and of the six scolop’d embosments\r\non either side, as full as it could be stuft, the stomach and guts were as\r\nfull as they could hold; the _peristaltick_ motion of the gut grew quick,\r\nand the justling motion of II accordingly; multitudes of milk-white vessels\r\nseem’d quickly filled, and turgid, which were perhaps the veins and\r\narteries and the Creature was so greedy, that though it could not contain\r\nmore, yet it continued sucking as fast as ever, and as fast emptying it\r\nself behind: the digestion of this Creature must needs be very quick, for\r\nthough I perceiv’d the blood thicker and blacker when suck’d, yet, when in\r\nthe guts, it was of a very lovely ruby colour, and that part of it, which\r\nwas digested into the veins, seemed white; whence it appears, that a\r\nfurther digestion of blood may make it milk, at least of a resembling\r\ncolour: What is else observable in the figure of this Creature, may be seen\r\nby the 35. _Scheme_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LV. _Of _Mites_._\r\n\r\nThe least of _Reptiles_ I have hitherto met with, is a Mite, a Creature\r\nwhereof there are some so very small, that the sharpest sight, unassisted\r\nwith Glasses, is not able to discern them, though, being white of\r\nthemselves, they move on a black and smooth surface; and the Eggs, out of\r\nwhich these Creatures seem to be hatch’d, are yet smaller, those being\r\nusually not above a four or five hundredth part of a well grown Mite, and\r\nthose well grown Mites not much above one hundredth of an inch in\r\nthickness; so that according to this reckoning there may be no less then a\r\nmillion of well grown Mites contain’d in a cubick inch, and five hundred\r\ntimes as many Eggs.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding which minuteness a good _Microscope_ discovers those small\r\nmovable specks to be very prettily shap’d Insects, each of them furnished\r\nwith eight well shap’d and proportion’d legs, which are each of them\r\njoynted or bendable in eight several places, or joynts, each of which is\r\ncovered, for the most part, with a very transparent shell, and the lower\r\nend of the shell of each joynt is fringed with several small hairs; the\r\ncontrivance of the joynts seems the very same with that of Crabs and\r\nLobsters legs, and like those also, they are each of them terminated with a\r\nvery sharp claw or point; four of these legs are so placed, that they seem\r\nto draw forwards, the other four are placed in a quite contrary position,\r\nthereby to keep the body backwards when there is occasion.\r\n\r\n[15]The body, as in other larger Insects, consists of three regions or\r\nparts; the hinder or belly A, seems covered with one intire shell, the\r\nmiddle, or chest, seems divided into two shells BC. which running one\r\nwithin the other, the Mite is able to shrink in and thrust out as it finds\r\noccasion, as it can also the snout D. The whole body is pretty transparent,\r\nso that being look’d on against the light, divers motions within its body\r\nmay be perceived; as also all the parts are much more plainly delineable,\r\nthen in other postures, to the light. The shell, especially that which\r\ncovers the back, is curiously polisht, so that ’tis easie to see, as in a\r\n_convex_ Looking-glass, or _foliated_ Glass-ball, the picture of all the\r\nobjects round about; up and down, in several parts of its body, it has\r\nseveral small long white hairs growing out of its shell, which are often\r\nlonger then the whole body, and are represented too short in the first and\r\nsecond Figures; they seem all pretty straight and pliable, save only two\r\nupon the forepart of its body, which seem to be the horns, as may be seen\r\nin the Figures; the first whereof is a prospect of a smaller sort of Mites\r\n(which are usually more plump) as it was _passant_ to and fro; the second\r\nis the prospect of one fixt on its tail (by means of a little mouth-glew\r\nrub’d on the object plate) exhibiting the manner of the growing of the\r\nlegs, together with their several joynts.\r\n\r\nThis Creature is very much diversify’d in shape, colour, and divers other\r\nproperties, according to the nature of the substance out of which it seems\r\nto be ingendred and nourished, being in one substance more long, in another\r\nmore round, in some more hairy, in others more smooth, in this nimble, in\r\nthat slow, here pale and whiter, there browner, blacker, more transparent,\r\n&c. I have observed it to be resident almost on all kinds of substances\r\nthat are mouldy, or putrifying, and have seen it very nimbly meshing\r\nthrough the thickets of mould, and sometimes to lye _dormant_ underneath\r\nthem; and ’tis not unlikely, but that it may feed on that vegetating\r\nsubstance, _spontaneous Vegetables_ seeming a food proper enough for\r\n_spontaneous Animals_,\r\n\r\nBut whether indeed this Creature, or any other, be such or not, I cannot\r\npositively, from any Experiment, or Observation, I have yet made,\r\ndetermine. But, as I formerly hinted, it seems probable, that some kind of\r\nwandring Mite may sow, as ’twere, the first seeds, or lay the first eggs,\r\nin those places, which Nature has instructed them to know convenient for\r\nthe hatching and nourishing their young; and though perhaps the prime\r\nParent might be of a shape very differing from what the offspring, after a\r\nlittle while, by reason of the substance they feed on, or the Region (as\r\n’twere) they inhabite; yet perhaps even one of these alter’d progeny,\r\nwandering again from its native soil, and lighting on by chance the same\r\nplace from whence its prime Parent came, and there settling, and planting,\r\nmay produce a generation of Mites of the same shapes and properties with\r\nthe first wandring Mite: And from some such accidents as these, I am very\r\napt to think, the most sorts of Animals, generally accounted _spontaneous_,\r\nhave their _origination_, and all those various sorts of Mites, that are to\r\nbe met with up and down in divers putrifying substances, may perhaps be all\r\nof the same kind, and have sprung from one and the same sort of Mites at\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LVI. _Of a small Creature hatch’d on a Vine._\r\n\r\nThere is, almost all the Spring and Summer time, a certain small, round,\r\nwhite Cobweb, as ’twere, about the bigness of a Pea, which sticks very\r\nclose and fast to the stocks of Vines nayl’d against a warm wall: being\r\nattentively viewed, they seem cover’d, upon the upper side of them, with a\r\nsmall husk, not unlike the scale, or shell of a Wood-louse, or Hog-louse, a\r\nsmall Insect usually found about rotten wood, which upon touching presently\r\nrouls it self into the form of a peppercorn: Separating several of these\r\nfrom the stock, I found them, with my _Microscope_, to consist of a shell,\r\nwhich now seemed more likely to be the husk of one of these Insects: And\r\nthe fur seem’d a kind of cobweb, consisting of abundance of small\r\nfilaments, or sleaves of cobwebs. In the midst of this, if they were not\r\nhatch’d, and run away before, the time of which hatching was usually about\r\nthe latter end of _June_, or beginning of _July_, I have often found\r\nabundance of small brown Eggs, such as A and B in the second Figure of the\r\n36. _Scheme_, much about the bigness of Mites Eggs; and at other times,\r\nmultitudes of small Insects, shaped exactly like that in the third Figure\r\nmarked with X. Its head large, almost half the bigness of its body, which\r\nis usual in the _fœtus_ of most Creatures. It had two small black eyes\r\n_aa_, and two small long joynted and brisled horns _bb_. The hinder part of\r\nits body seem’d to consist of nine scales, and the last ended in a forked\r\ntayl, much like that of a _Cutio_, or Wood-louse, out of which grew two\r\nlong hairs; they ran to and fro very swiftly, and were much of the bigness\r\nof a common Mite, but some of them less: The longest of them seem’d not the\r\nhundredth part of an inch, and the Eggs usually not above half as much.\r\nThey seemed to have six legs, which were not visible in this I have here\r\ndelineated, by reason they were drawn under its body.\r\n\r\nIf these Minute creatures were _Wood-lice_ (as indeed from their own shape\r\nand from the frame, the skin, or shell, that grows on them, one may with\r\ngreat probability ghess) it affords us an Instance, whereof perhaps there\r\nare not many like in Nature, and that is, of the prodigious increase of\r\nthese Creatures, after they are hatch’d and run about; for a common\r\nWood-louse, of about half an inch long, is no less then a hundred and\r\ntwenty five thousand times bigger then one of these, which though indeed it\r\nseems very strange, yet I have observed the young ones of some Spiders have\r\nalmost kept the same proportion to their Dam.\r\n\r\nThis, methinks, if it be so, does in the next place hint a Quæry, which may\r\nperhaps deserve a little further examination: And that is, Whether there be\r\nnot many of those minute Creatures, such as Mites, and the like, which,\r\nthough they are commonly thought of otherwise, are only the _pully_, or\r\nyoung ones, of much bigger Insects, and not the generating, or parent\r\n_Insect_, that has layd those Eggs; for having many times observ’d those\r\nEggs, which usually are found in great abundance where Mites are found, it\r\nseems something strange, that so small an Animal should have an Egg so big\r\nin proportion to its body. Though on the other side, I must confess, that\r\nhaving kept divers of those Mites inclosed in a box for a good while, I did\r\nnot find them very much augmented beyond their usual bigness.\r\n\r\nWhat the husk and cobweb of this little white substance should be, I cannot\r\nimagine, unless it be, that the old one, when impregnated with Eggs, should\r\nthere stay, and fix it self on the Vine, and dye, and all the body by\r\ndegrees should rot, save only the husk, and the Eggs in the body: And the\r\nheat, or fire, as it were, of the approaching Sun-beams should vivifie\r\nthose Relicts of the corrupted Parent, and out of the ashes, as ’twere, (as\r\nit is fabled of the _Phœnix_) should raise a new _offspring_ for the\r\nperpetuation of the _Species_. Nor will the cobweb, as it were, in which\r\nthese Eggs are inclos’d, make much against this Conjecture; for we may, by\r\nthose cobwebs that are carried up and down the Air after a Fog (which with\r\nmy _Microscope_ I have discovered to be made up of an infinite company of\r\nsmall filaments or threads) learn, that such a texture of body may be\r\notherwise made then by the spinning of a Worm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LVII. _Of the _Eels_ in Vinegar._\r\n\r\nOf these small Eels, which are to be found in divers sorts of Vinegar, I\r\nhave little to add besides their Picture, which you may find drawn in the\r\nthird Figure of the 25. _Scheme_: That is, they were shaped much like an\r\nEel, save only that their nose A, (which was a little more opacous then the\r\nrest of their body) was a little sharper, and longer, in proportion to\r\ntheir body, and the wrigling motion of their body seem’d to be onely\r\nupwards and downwards, whereas that of Eels is onely side-wayes: They\r\nseem’d to have a more opacous part about B, which might, perhaps, be their\r\nGills; it seeming always the same proportionate distant from their nose,\r\nfrom which, to the tip of their tail, C, their body seem’d to taper.\r\n\r\nTaking several of these out of their Pond of Vinegar, by the net of a small\r\npiece of filtring Paper, and laying them on a black smooth Glass plate, I\r\nfound that they could wriggle and winde their body, as much almost as a\r\nSnake, which made me doubt, whether they were a kind of Eal or Leech.\r\n\r\nI shall add no other observations made on this minute Animal, being\r\nprevented herein by many excellent ones already publish’d by the ingenious,\r\nDoctor _Power_, among his _Microscopical_ Observations, save onely that a\r\nquantity of Vinegar repleat with them being included in a small Viol, and\r\nstop’d very close from the ambient air, all the included Worms in a very\r\nshort time died, as if they had been stifled.\r\n\r\nAnd that their motion seems (contrary to what we may observe in the motion\r\nof all other Infects) exceeding slow. But the reason of it seems plain, for\r\nbeing to move to and fro after that manner which they do, by waving onely,\r\nor wrigling their body; the tenacity, or glutinousness, and the density or\r\nresistance of the fluid _medium_ becomes so exceeding sensible to their\r\nextremely minute bodies, that it is to me indeed a greater wonder that they\r\nmove them so fast as they do, then that they move them no faster. For what\r\na vastly greater proportion have they of their superficies to their bulk,\r\nthen Eels or other larger Fishes, and next, the tenacity and density of the\r\nliquor being much the same to be moved, both by the one and the other, the\r\nresistance or impediment thence arising to the motions made through it,\r\nmust be almost infinitely greater to the small one then to the great. This\r\nwe find experimentally verify’d in the Air, which though a _medium_ a\r\nthousand times more rarify’d then the water, the resistance of it to\r\nmotions made through it, is yet so sensible to very minute bodies, that a\r\nDown-feather (the least of whose parts seem yet bigger then these Eels, and\r\nmany of them almost incomparably bigger, such as the quill and stalk) is\r\nsuspended by it, and carried to and fro as if it had no weight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LVIII. _Of a new Property in the _Air_, and several other\r\ntransparent _Mediums_ nam’d _Inflection_, whereby very many considerable\r\n_Phænomena_ are attempted to be solv’d, and divers other uses are hinted._\r\n\r\nSince the Invention (and perfecting in some measure) of _Telescopes_, it\r\nhas been observ’d by several, that the Sun and Moon neer the Horizon, are\r\ndisfigur’d (losing that exactly-smooth terminating circular limb, which\r\nthey are observ’d to have when situated neerer the Zenith) and are bounded\r\nwith an edge every way (especially upon the right and left sides) ragged\r\nand indented like a Saw: which inequality of their limbs, I have further\r\nobserv’d, not to remain always the same, but to be continually chang’d by a\r\nkind of fluctuating motion, not unlike that of the waves of the Sea, so as\r\nthat part of the limb, which was but even now nick’d or indented in, is now\r\nprotuberant, and will presently be sinking again; neither is this all but\r\nthe whole body of the Luminaries, do in the _Telescope_, seem to be\r\ndepress’d and flatted, the upper, and more especially the under side\r\nappearing neerer to the middle then really they are, and the right and left\r\nappearing more remote: whence the whole _Area_ seems to be terminated by a\r\nkind of Oval. It is further observ’d, that the body, for the most part,\r\nappears red, or of some colour approaching neer unto it, as some kind of\r\nyellow; and this I have always mark’d, that the more the limb is flatted or\r\novalled, the more red does the body appear, though not always the contrary.\r\nIt is further observable, that both fix’d Stars and Planets, the neerer\r\nthey appear to the Horizon, the more red and dull they look, and the more\r\nthey are observ’d to twinkle; in so much, that I have seen the Dog-starr to\r\nvibrate so strong and bright a radiation of light, as almost to dazle my\r\neyes, and presently, almost to disappear. It is also observable, that those\r\nbright scintillations neer the Horizon, are not by much so quick and sudden\r\nin their consecutions of one another, as the nimbler twinklings of Stars\r\nneerer the Zenith. This is also notable, that the Starrs neer the Horizon,\r\nare twinkled with several colours; so as sometimes to appear red, sometimes\r\nmore yellow, and sometimes blue, and this when the Starr is a pretty way\r\nelevated above the Horizon. I have further, very often seen some of the\r\nsmall Starrs of the fifth or sixth magnitude, at certain times to disappear\r\nfor a small moment of time, and again appear more conspicuous, and with a\r\ngreater luster. I have several times, with my naked eye, seen many smaller\r\nStarrs, such as may be call’d of the seventh or eighth magnitude to appear\r\nfor a short space, and then vanish, which, by directing a small _Telescope_\r\ntowards that part they appear’d and disappear’d in; I could presently find\r\nto be indeed small Starrs so situate, as I had seen them with my naked eye,\r\nand to appear twinkling like the ordinary visible Stars; nay, in examining\r\nsome very notable parts of the Heaven, with a three foot Tube, me thought I\r\nnow and then, in several parts of the constellation, could perceive little\r\ntwinklings of Starrs, making a very short kind of apparition, and presently\r\nvanishing, but noting diligently the places where they thus seem’d to play\r\nat boe-peep, I made use of a very good twelve foot Tube, and with that it\r\nwas not uneasie to see those, and several other degrees of smaller Starrs,\r\nand some smaller yet, that seem’d again to appear and disappear, and these\r\nalso by giving the same Object-glass a much bigger aperture, I could\r\nplainly and constantly see appear in their former places; so that I have\r\nobserv’d some twelve several magnitudes of Starrs less then those of the\r\nsix magnitudes commonly recounted in the Globes.\r\n\r\nIt has been observ’d and confirm’d by the accuratest Observations of the\r\nbest of our modern Astronomers, that all the Luminous bodies appear above\r\nthe Horizon, when they really are below it. So that the Sun and Moon have\r\nboth been seen above the Horizon, whil’st the Moon has been in an Eclipse.\r\nI shall not here instance in the great refractions, that the tops of high\r\nmountains, seen at a distance, have been found to have; all which seem to\r\nargue the Horizontal refraction, much greater then it is hitherto generally\r\nbeliev’d.\r\n\r\nI have further taken notice, that not onely the Sun, Moon and Starrs, and\r\nhigh tops of mountains have suffer’d these kinds of refraction, but Trees,\r\nand several bright Objects on the ground: I have often taken notice of the\r\ntwinkling of the reflections of the Sun from a Glass-window at a good\r\ndistance, and of a Candle in the night, but that is not so conspicuous, and\r\nin observing the setting Sun, I have often taken notice of the tremulation\r\nof the Trees and Bushes, as well as of the edges of the Sun. Divers of\r\nthese _Phænomena_ have been taken notice of by several, who have given\r\nseveral reasons of them, but I have not yet met with any altogether\r\nsatisfactory, though some of their conjectures have been partly true, but\r\npartly also false. Setting my self therfore upon the inquiry of these\r\n_Phænomena_, I first endeavour’d to be very diligent in taking notice of\r\nthe several particulars and circumstances observable in them; and next, in\r\nmaking divers particular Experiments, that might cleer some doubts, and\r\nserve to determine, confirm, and illustrate the true and adæquate cause of\r\neach; and upon the whole, I find much reason to think, that the true cause\r\nof all these _Phænomena_ is from the _inflection_, or _multiplicate\r\nrefraction_ of those Rays of light within the body of the _Atmosphere_, and\r\nthat it does not proceed from a _refraction_ caus’d by any terminating\r\n_superficies_ of the Air above, nor from any such exactly defin’d\r\n_superficies_ within the body of the _Atmosphere_.\r\n\r\nThis Conclusion is grounded upon these two Propositions:\r\n\r\nFirst, that a _medium_, whose parts are unequally _dense_, and mov’d by\r\nvarious motions and transpositions as to one another, will produce all\r\nthese visible effects upon the Rays of light, without any other\r\n_coefficient_ cause.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that there is in the Air or _Atmosphere_ such a variety in the\r\nconstituent parts of it, both as to their _density_ and _rarity_, and as to\r\ntheir divers mutations and positions one to another.\r\n\r\nBy _Density_ and _Rarity_, I understand a property of a transparent body,\r\nthat does either more or less refract a Ray of light (coming obliquely upon\r\nits superficies out of a third _medium_) toward its perpendicular: As I\r\ncall Glass a more dense body then Water, and Water a more rare body then\r\nGlass, because of the refractions (more or less deflecting towards the\r\nperpendicular) that are made in them, of a Ray of light out of the Air that\r\nhas the same inclination upon either of their superficies.\r\n\r\nSo as to the business of Refraction, spirit of Wine is a more _dense_ body\r\nthen Water, it having been found by an accurate Instrument that measures\r\nthe angles of Refractions to Minutes that for the same refracted angle of\r\n30°.00′. in both those _Mediums_, the angle of incidence in Water was but\r\n41°.35′. but the angle of the incidence in the trial with spirit of Wine\r\nwas 42°.45′. But as to gravity, Water is a more _dense_ body then spirit of\r\nWine, for the proportion of the same Water, to the same very well rectify’d\r\nspirit of Wine was, as 21. to 19.\r\n\r\nSo as to Refraction, Water is more Dense then Ice; for I have found by a\r\nmost certain Experiment, which I exhibited before divers illustrious\r\nPersons of the _Royal Society_, that the Refraction of Water was greater\r\nthen that of Ice, though some considerable Authors have affirm’d the\r\ncontrary, and though the Ice be a very hard, and the Water a very fluid\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThat the former of the two preceding Propositions is true, may be\r\nmanifested by several Experiments; As first, if you take any two liquors\r\ndiffering from one another in density, but yet such as will readily mix: as\r\nSalt Water, or Brine, & Fresh; almost any kind of Salt dissolv’d in Water,\r\nand filtrated, so that it be cleer, spirit of Wine and Water; nay, spirit\r\nof Wine, and spirit of Wine, one more highly rectify’d then the other, and\r\nvery many other liquors; if (I say) you take any two of these liquors, and\r\nmixing them in a Glass Viol, against one side of which you have fix’d or\r\nglued a small round piece of Paper, and shaking them well together (so that\r\nthe parts of them may be somewhat disturb’d and move up and down) you\r\nendeavour to see that round piece of Paper through the body of the liquors,\r\nyou shall plainly perceive the Figure to wave, and to be indented much\r\nafter the same manner as the limb of the Sun through a _Telescope_ seems to\r\nbe, save onely that the mutations here, are much quicker. And if, in steed\r\nof this bigger Circle, you take a very small spot, and fasten and view it\r\nas the former, you will find it to appear much like the twinkling of the\r\nStarrs, though much quicker: which two _Phænomena_, (for I shall take\r\nnotice of no more at present, though I could instance in multitudes of\r\nothers) must necessarily be caus’d by an _inflection_ of the Rays within\r\nthe terminating superficies of the compounded _medium_, since the surfaces\r\nof the transparent body through which the Rays pass to the eye, are not at\r\nall altered or chang’d.\r\n\r\nThis _inflection_ (if I may so call it) I imagine to be nothing else, but a\r\n_multiplicate refraction_, caused by the unequal _density_ of the\r\nconstituent parts of the _medium_, whereby the motion, action or progress\r\nof the Ray of light is hindred from proceeding in a streight line, and\r\n_inflected_ or _deflected_ by a _curve_. Now, that it is a _curve_ line is\r\nmanifest by this Experiment: I took a Box, such as ADGE, in the first\r\n_Figure_ of the 37. _Scheme_, whose sides ABCD, and EFGH, were made of two\r\nsmooth flat plates of Glass, then filling it half full with a very strong\r\nsolution of Salt, I filled the other half with very fair fresh water, then\r\nexposing the opacous side, DHGC, to the Sun, I observ’d both the\r\n_refraction_ and _inflection_ of the Sun beams, ID & KH, and marking as\r\nexactly as I could, the points, P, N, O, M, by which the Ray, KH, passed\r\nthrough the compounded _medium_, I found them to be in a _curve_ line; for\r\nthe parts of the _medium_ being continually more dense the neerer they were\r\nto the bottom, the Ray _pf_ was continually more and more deflected\r\ndownwards from the streight line.\r\n\r\nThis Inflection may be mechanically explained, either by Monsieur _Des\r\nCartes_ principles by conceiving the Globuls of the third Element to find\r\nless and less resistance against that side of them which is downwards, or\r\nby a way, which I have further explicated in the Inquisition about Colours,\r\nto be from an obliquation of the pulse of light, whence the under part is\r\ncontinually promoted, and consequently refracted towards the perpendicular,\r\nwhich cuts the Orbs at right angles. What the particular Figure of the\r\n_Curve line_, describ’d by this way of light, is, I shall not now stand to\r\nexamine, especially since there may be so many sorts of it as there may be\r\nvarieties of the Positions of the _intermediate_ degrees of _density_ and\r\n_rarity_ between the bottom and the top of the inflecting Medium.\r\n\r\nI could produce many more Examples and Experiments, to illustrate and prove\r\nthis first Proposition, _viz._ that there is such a constitution of some\r\nbodies as will cause inflection. As not to mention those I have observ’d in\r\n_Horn_, _Tortoise-Shell_, _transparent Gums_, and _resinous Substances_:\r\nThe _veins_ of Glass, nay, of melted _Crystal_, found, and much complained\r\nof by Glass-grinders, and others, might sufficiently demonstrate the truth\r\nof it to any diligent Observator.\r\n\r\nBut that, I presume, I have by this Example given proof sufficient (_viz.\r\nocular demonstration_) to evince, that there is such a modulation, or\r\nbending of the rayes of light, as I have call’d _inflection_, differing\r\nboth from _reflection_, and _refraction_ (since they are both made in the\r\nsuperficies, this only in the middle); and likewise, that this is able or\r\nsufficient to produce the effects I have ascribed to it.\r\n\r\nIt remains therefore to shew, that there is such a property in the Air, and\r\nthat it is sufficient to produce all the above mentioned _Phænomena_, and\r\ntherefore may be the principal, if not the only cause of them.\r\n\r\nFirst, That there is such a property, may be proved from this, that the\r\nparts of the Air are some of them more condens’d, others more rarified,\r\neither by the differing heat, or differing pressure it sustains, or by the\r\nsomewhat heterogeneous vapours interspers’d through it. For as the Air is\r\nmore or less rarified, so does it more or less refract a ray of light (that\r\ncomes out of a denser medium) from the perpendicular. This you may find\r\ntrue, if you make tryal of this Experiment.\r\n\r\nTake a small Glass-bubble, made in the form of that in the second Figure of\r\nthe 37. _Scheme_, and by heating the Glass very hot, and thereby very much\r\nrarifying the included Air, or, which is better, by rarifying a small\r\nquantity of water, included in it, into vapours, which will expel the most\r\npart, if not all the Air, and then sealing up the small neck of it, and\r\nletting it cool, you may find, if you place it in a convenient Instrument,\r\nthat there will be a manifest difference, as to the refraction.\r\n\r\nAs if in this second Figure you suppose A to represent a small sight or\r\nhole, through which the eye looks upon an object, as C, through the\r\nGlass-bubble B, and the second sight L; all which remain exactly fixt in\r\ntheir several places, the object C being so cized and placed, that it may\r\njust seem to touch the upper and under edge of the hole L: and so all of it\r\nbe seen through the small Glass-ball of rarified Air; then by breaking off\r\nthe small seal’d neck of the Bubble (without at all stirring the sights,\r\nobject, or glass) and admitting the external Air, you will find your self\r\nunable to see the utmost ends of the object; but the terminating rayes AE\r\nand AD (which were before refracted to G and F by the rarified Air) will\r\nproceed almost directly to I and H; which alteration of the rayes (seeing\r\nthere is no other alteration made in the Organ by which the Experiment is\r\ntryed, save only the admission, or exclusion of the condens’d Air) must\r\nnecessarily be caused by the variation of the _medium_ contain’d in the\r\nGlass B; the greatest difficulty in the making of which Experiment, is from\r\nthe uneven surfaces of the bubble, which will represent an uneven image of\r\nthe object.\r\n\r\nNow, that there is such a difference of the upper and under parts of the\r\nAir is clear enough evinc’d from the late improvement of the _Torricellian_\r\nExperiment, which has been tryed at the tops and feet of Mountains; and may\r\nbe further illustrated, and inquired into, by a means, which some whiles\r\nsince I thought of, and us’d, for the finding by what degrees the Air\r\npasses from such a degree of Density to such a degree of Rarity. And\r\nanother, for the finding what pressure was requisite to make it pass from\r\nsuch a degree of Rarefaction to a determinate Density: Which Experiments,\r\nbecause they may be useful to illustrate the present Inquiry, I shall\r\nbriefly describe.\r\n\r\n[16] I took then a small Glass-pipe AB, about the bigness of a Swans quill,\r\nand about four foot long, which was very equally drawn, so that, as far as\r\nI could perceive, no one part was bigger then another: This Tube (being\r\nopen at both ends) I fitted into another small Tube DE, that had a small\r\nbore just big enough to contain the small Pipe, and this was seal’d up at\r\none, and open at the other, end; about which open end I fastned a small\r\nwooden box C with cement, so that filling the bigger Tube, and part of the\r\nbox, with Quicksilver, I could thrust the smaller Tube into it, till it\r\nwere all covered with the Quicksilver: Having thus done, I fastned my\r\nbigger Tube against the side of a wall, that it might stand the steadier,\r\nand plunging the small Tube cleer under the _Mercury_ in the box, I stopt\r\nthe upper end of it very fast with cement, then lifting up the small Tube,\r\nI drew it up by a small pully, and a string that I had fastned to the top\r\nof the Room, and found the height of the _Mercurial Cylinder_ to be about\r\ntwenty nine inches.\r\n\r\nThen letting down the Tube again, I opened the top, and then thrust down\r\nthe small Tube, till I perceived the Quicksilver to rise within it to a\r\nmark that I had plac’d just an inch from the top; and immediately clapping\r\non a small piece of cement that I had kept warm, I with a hot Iron seal’d\r\nup the top very fast, then letting it cool (that both the cement might grow\r\nhard, and more especially, that the Air might come to its temper, natural\r\nfor the Day I try’d the Experiment in) I observ’d diligently, and found the\r\nincluded Air to be exactly an Inch.\r\n\r\nHere you are to take notice, that after the Air is seal’d up, the top of\r\nthe Tube is not to be elevated above the superficies of the Quicksilver in\r\nthe box, till the surface of that within the Tube be equal to it, for the\r\nQuicksilver (as I have elsewhere prov’d) being more heterogeneous to the\r\nGlass then the Air, will not naturally rise up so high within the small\r\nPipe, as the superficies of the _Mercury_ in the box, and therefore you are\r\nto observe, how much below the outward superficies of the _Mercury_ in the\r\nbox, that of the same in the Tube does stand, when the top being open, free\r\ningress is admitted to the outward Air.\r\n\r\nHaving thus done, I permitted the _Cylinder_, or small Pipe, to rise out of\r\nthe box, till I found the surface of the Quicksilver in the Pipe to be two\r\ninches above that in the box, and found the Air to have expanded it self\r\nbut one sixteenth part of an inch; then drawing up the small pipe, till I\r\nfound the height of the Quicksilver within to be four inches above that\r\nwithout, I observed the Air to be expanded only ⅐ of an inch more then it\r\nwas at first, and to take up the room of 1⅐ inch: then I raised the Tube\r\ntill the Cylinder was six inches high, and found the Air to take up 1²⁄₉\r\ninches of room in the Pipe; then to 8, 10, 12. &c. the expansion of the Air\r\nthat I found to each of which Cylinders are set down in the following\r\nTable; where the first row signifies the height of the _Mercurial\r\nCylinder_; the next, the expansion of the Air; the third, the pressure of\r\nthe _Atmosphere_, or the highest _Cylinder_ of _Mercury_, which was then\r\nneer thirty inches: The last signifies the force of the Air so expanded,\r\nwhich is found by substracting the first row of numbers out of the third;\r\nfor having found, that the outward Air would then keep up the Quicksilver\r\nto thirty inches, look whatever of that height is wanting must be\r\nattributed to the Elater of the Air depressing. And therefore having the\r\nExpansion in the second row, and the height of the subjacent _Cylinder_ of\r\n_Mercury_ in the first, and the greatest height of the _Cylinder_ of\r\n_Mercury_, which of it self counterballances the whole pressure of the\r\n_Atmosphere_; by substracting the numbers of the first row out of the\r\nnumbers of the third, you will have the measure of the _Cylinders_ so\r\ndeprest, and consequently the force of the Air, in the several Expansions,\r\nregistred.\r\n\r\n  The height of the     The Expansion   The height of   The strength\r\n  Cylinder of Mercury,  of the Air.     the Mercury     of the Elater\r\n  that, together with                   that counter-   of the expanded\r\n  the Elater of the                     ballanc’d the   Air.\r\n  included Air,                         Atmosphere.\r\n  ballanced the\r\n  pressure of the\r\n  Atmosphere.\r\n   ----------            ----------      ----------      ----------\r\n      00                    01               30              30\r\n      02                    01¹⁄₁₆           30              28\r\n      04                    01⅐              30              26\r\n      06                    01²⁄₉            30              24\r\n      08                    01⅓              30              22\r\n      10                    01½              30              20\r\n      12                    01⅔              30              18\r\n      14                    01⅚              30              16\r\n      16                    02²⁄₂₇           30              14\r\n      18                    02⁴⁄₉            30              12\r\n      20                    03               30              10\r\n      22                    03⁷⁄₉            30               8\r\n      24                    05⁷⁄₁₈           30               6\r\n      25                    06⅔              30               5\r\n      26                    08½              30               4\r\n      26¼                   09½              30               3¾\r\n      26½                   10¾              30               3½\r\n      26¾                   13               30               3¼\r\n      27                    15½              30               3\r\n\r\nI had several other Tables of my Observations, and Calculations, which I\r\nthen made; but it being above a twelve month since I made them; and by that\r\nmeans having forgot many circumstances and particulars, I was resolved to\r\nmake them over once again, which I did _August_ the second 1661. with the\r\nvery same Tube which I used the year before, when I first made the\r\nExperiment (for it being a very good one, I had carefully preserv’d it:)\r\nAnd after having tryed it over and over again; and being not well satisfied\r\nof some particulars, I, at last, having put all things in very good order,\r\nand being as attentive, and observant, as possibly I could, of every\r\ncircumstance requisite to be taken notice of, did register my several\r\nObservations in this following Table. In the making of which, I did not\r\nexactly follow the method that I had used at first; but, having lately\r\nheard of Mr. _Townly_’s _Hypothesis_, I shap’d my course in such sort, as\r\nwould be most convenient for the examination of that _Hypothesis_; the\r\nevent of which you have in the latter part of the last Table.\r\n\r\nThe other Experiment was, to find what degrees of force were requisite to\r\ncompress, or condense, the Air into such or such a bulk.\r\n\r\nThe manner of proceeding therein was this: I took a Tube about five foot\r\nlong, one of whose ends was sealed up, and bended in the form of a\r\n_Syphon_, much like that represented in the fourth Figure of the 37.\r\n_Scheme_, one side whereof AD, that was open at A, was about fifty inches\r\nlong, the other side BC, shut at B, was not much above seven inches long,\r\nthen placing it exactly perpendicular, I pour’d in a little Quicksilver,\r\nand found that the Air BC was 6⅞ inches, or very near to seven; then\r\npouring in Quicksilver at the longer Tube, I continued filling of it till\r\nthe Air in the shorter part of it was contracted into half the former\r\ndimensions, and found the height exactly nine and twenty inches; and by\r\nmaking several other tryals, in several other degrees of condensation of\r\nthe Air, I found them exactly answer the former _Hypothesis_.\r\n\r\nBut having (by reason it was a good while since I first made) forgotten\r\nmany particulars, and being much unsatisfied in others, I made the\r\nExperiment over again, and, from the several tryals, collected the former\r\npart of the following Table: Where in the row next the left hand 24.\r\nsignifies the dimensions of the Air, sustaining only the pressure of the\r\n_Atmosphere_, which at that time was equal to a _Cylinder_ of _Mercury_ of\r\nnine and twenty inches: The next Figure above it (20) was the dimensions of\r\nthe Air induring the first compression, made by a _Cylinder_ of _Mercury_\r\n5³⁄₁₆ high, to which the pressure of the _Atmosphere_ nine and twenty\r\ninches being added, the elastick strength of the Air so comprest will be\r\nfound 34³⁄₁₆, &c.\r\n\r\n_A Table of the Elastick power of the Air, both Experimentally and\r\nHypothetically calculated, according to its various Dimensions._\r\n\r\n\r\n  The dimensions   The height    The Mercurial  The sum or  What they\r\n  of the included  of the        Cylinder       difference  ought to\r\n  Air.

So that to\r\napply it to our present purpose (which was indeed the chief cause of\r\ninventing these wayes of tryal) we will suppose a _Cylinder_ indefinitely\r\nextended upwards, [I say a _Cylinder_, not a piece of a _Cone_, because, as\r\nI may elsewhere shew in the Explication of Gravity, that _triplicate_\r\nproportion of the shels of a Sphere, to their respective diameters, I\r\nsuppose to be removed in this case by the decrease of the power of Gravity]\r\nand the pressure of the Air at the bottom of this _Cylinder_ to be strong\r\nenough to keep up a _Cylinder_ of _Mercury_ of thirty inches: Now because\r\nby the most accurate tryals of the most illustrious and incomparable Mr.\r\n_Boyle_, published in his deservedly famous Pneumatick Book, the weight of\r\nQuicksilver, to that of the Air here below, is found neer about as fourteen\r\nthousand to one: If we suppose the parts of the _Cylinder_ of the\r\n_Atmosphere_ to be every where of an equal density, we shall (as he there\r\ndeduces) find it extended to the height of thirty five thousand feet, or\r\nseven miles: But because by these Experiments we have somewhat confirm’d\r\nthe hypothesis of the reciprocal proportion of the Elaters to the\r\nExtensions we shall find, that by supposing this _Cylinder_ of the\r\n_Atmosphere_ divided into a thousand parts, each of which being equivalent\r\nto thirty five feet, or seven geometrical paces, that is, each of these\r\ndivisions containing as much Air as is suppos’d in a _Cylinder_ neer the\r\nearth of equal diameter, and thirty five foot high, we shall find the\r\nlowermost to press against the surface of the Earth with the whole weight\r\nof the above mentioned thousand parts; the pressure of the bottom of the\r\nsecond against the top of the first to be 1000 − 1 = 999. of the third\r\nagainst the second to be 1000 − 2 = 998. of the fourth against the third to\r\nbe 1000 − 3 = 997. of the uppermost against the 999. or that next below it,\r\nto be 1000 − 999 = 1. so that the extension of the lowermost next the\r\nEarth, will be to the extension of the next below the uppermost, as 1. to\r\n999. for as the pressure sustained by the 999. is to the pressure sustain’d\r\nby the first, so is the extension of the first to the extension of the 999.\r\nso that, from this hypothetical calculation, we shall find the Air to be\r\nindefinitely extended: For if we suppose the whole thickness of the Air to\r\nbe divided, as I just now instanced, into a thousand parts, and each of\r\nthose under differing Dimensions, or Altitudes, to contain an equall\r\nquantity of Air, we shall find, that the first _Cylinder_, whose Base is\r\nsupposed to lean on the Earth, will be found to be extended 35³⁵⁄₉₉₉ foot;\r\nthe second equal Division, or _Cylinder_, whose _basis_ is supposed to lean\r\non the top of the first, shall have its top extended higher by 35⁷⁰⁄₉₉₈\r\nthe third 35¹⁰⁵⁄₉₉₇ the fourth 35¹⁴⁰⁄₉₉₆ and so onward, each equal\r\nquantity of Air having its dimensions measured by 35. and some additional\r\nnumber exprest alwayes in the manner of a fraction, whose numerator is\r\nalway the number of the place multipli’d by 35. and whose denominator is\r\nalwayes the pressure of the _Atmosphere_ sustain’d by that part, so that by\r\nthis means we may easily calculate the height of 999. divisions of those\r\n1000. divisions, I suppos’d; whereas the uppermost may extend it self more\r\nthen as high again, nay, perhaps indefinitely, or beyond the Moon; for the\r\nElaters and Expansions being in reciprocal proportions, since we cannot yet\r\nfind the _plus ultra_, beyond which the Air will not expand it self, we\r\ncannot determine the height of the Air: for since, as we have shewn, the\r\nproportion will be alway as the pressure sustain’d by any part is to 35. so\r\n1000. to the expansion of that part; the multiplication or product\r\ntherefore of the pressure, and expansion, that is, of the two extream\r\nproportionals, being alwayes equal to the product of the means, or 35000.\r\nit follows, since that Rectangle or Product may be made up of the\r\nmultiplication of infinite diversities of numbers, that the height of the\r\nAir is also indefinite; for since (as far as I have yet been able to try)\r\nthe Air seems capable of an indefinite Expansion, the pressure may be\r\ndecreased in _infinitum_, and consequently its expansion upwards indefinite\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThere being therefore such a difference of density, and no Experiment yet\r\nknown to prove a _Saltus_, or skipping from one degree of rarity to another\r\nmuch differing from it, that is, that an upper part of the Air should so\r\nmuch differ from that immediately _subjacent_ to it, as to make a distinct\r\nsuperficies, such as we observe between the Air and Water, &c. But it being\r\nmore likely, that there is a continual increase of rarity in the parts of\r\nthe Air, the further they are removed from the surface of the Earth: It\r\nwill hence necessarily follow, that (as in the Experiment of the salt and\r\nfresh Water) the ray of Light passing obliquely through the Air also, which\r\nis of very different density, will be continually, and infinitely\r\ninflected, or bended, from a streight, or direct motion.\r\n\r\nThis granted, the reason of all the above recited _Phænomena_, concerning\r\nthe appearance of the Celestial Bodies, will very easily be deduced. As,\r\n\r\nFirst, The redness of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, will be found to be caused\r\nby the inflection of the rays within the _Atmosphere_. That it is not\r\nreally in or near the luminous bodies, will, I suppose, be very easily\r\ngranted, seeing that this redness is observable in several places differing\r\nin Longitude, to be at the same time different, the setting and rising Sun\r\nof all parts being for the most part red:\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, That it is not meerly the colour of the Air interpos’d, will,\r\nI suppose, without much more difficulty be yielded, seeing that we may\r\nobserve a very great _interstitium_ of Air betwixt the Object, and the Eye,\r\nmakes it appear of a dead blew, far enough differing from a red, or yellow.\r\n\r\nBut thirdly, That it proceeds from the refraction, or inflection, of the\r\nrays by the _Atmosphere_, this following Experiment will, I suppose,\r\nsufficiently manifest.\r\n\r\nTake a sphærical Crystalline Viol, such as is describ’d in the fifth Figure\r\nABCD, and, having fill’d it with pure clear Water, expose it to the Sun\r\nbeams; then taking a piece of very fine _Venice_ Paper, apply it against\r\nthat side of the Globe that is opposite to the Sun, as against the side BC,\r\nand you shall perceive a bright red Ring to appear, caus’d by the\r\nrefraction of the Rays, AAAA, which is made by the Globe; in which\r\nExperiment, if the Glass and Water be very cleer, so that there be no Sands\r\nnor bubbles in the Glass, nor dirt in the Water, you shall not perceive any\r\nappearance of any other colour. To apply which Experiment, we may imagine\r\nthe _Atmosphere_ to be a great transparent Globe, which being of a\r\nsubstance more dense then the other, or (which comes to the same) that has\r\nits parts more dense towards the middle, the Sun beams that are tangents,\r\nor next within the tangents of this Globe, will be refracted or inflected\r\nfrom their direct passage towards the center of the Globe, whence,\r\naccording to the laws of refractions made in a triangular _Prism_, and the\r\ngeneration of colour set down in the description of Muscovi-glass there\r\nmust necessarily appear a red colour in the _transitus_ or passage of those\r\ntangent Rays. To make this more plain, we will suppose (in the sixth\r\n_Figure_) ABCD, to represent the Globe of the _Atmosphere_, EFGH to\r\nrepresent the opacous Globe of the Earth, lying in the midst of it, neer to\r\nwhich, the parts of the Air, sustaining a very great pressure, are thereby\r\nvery much condens’d, from whence those Rays that are by inflection made\r\ntangents to the Globe of the Earth, and those without them, that pass\r\nthrough the more condens’d part of the _Atmosphere_, as suppose between A\r\nand E, are by reason of the inequality of the _medium_, inflected towards\r\nthe center, whereby there must necessarily be generated a red colour, as is\r\nmore plainly shewn in the former cited place; hence whatsoever opacous\r\nbodies (as vapours, or the like) shall chance to be elevated into those\r\nparts, will reflect a red towards the eye; and therefore those evenings and\r\nmornings appear reddest, that have the most store of vapours and halituous\r\nsubstances exhaled to a convenient distance from the Earth; for thereby the\r\ninflection is made the greater, and thereby the colour also the more\r\nintense; and several of those exhalations being opacous, reflect several of\r\nthose Rays, which, through an _Homogeneous_ transparent _medium_ would pass\r\nunseen; and therefore we see, that when there chances to be any clouds\r\nsituated in those Regions they reflect a strong and vivid red. Now, though\r\none great cause of the redness may be this inflection, yet I cannot wholly\r\nexclude the colour of the vapours themselves, which may have something of\r\nredness in them, they being partly nitrous; and partly fuliginous; both\r\nwhich steams tinge the Rays that pass through them, as is made evident by\r\nlooking at bodies through the fumes of _Aqua fortis_ or spirit of _Nitre_\r\n[as the newly mentioned Illustrious Person has demonstrated] and also\r\nthrough the smoak of a Fire or Chimney.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore made it probable at least, that the morning and evening\r\nredness may partly proceed from this inflection or refraction of the Rays,\r\nwe shall next shew how the Oval Figure will be likewise easily deduced.\r\n\r\nSuppose we therefore, EFGH in the sixth _Figure_ of the 37. _Scheme_, to\r\nrepresent the Earth; ABCD, the _Atmosphere_; EI, and EL, two Rays coming\r\nfrom the Sun, the one from the upper, the other from the neather Limb,\r\nthese Rays, being by the _Atmosphere_ inflected, appear to the eye at E, as\r\nif they had come from the points, N and O; and because the Ray L has a\r\ngreater inclination upon the inequality of the _Atmosphere_ then I,\r\ntherefore must it suffer a greater inflection, and consequently be further\r\nelevated above its true place, then the Ray I, which has a less\r\ninclination, will be elevated above its true place; whence it will follow,\r\nthat the lower side appearing neerer the upper then really it is, and the\r\ntwo _lateral_ sides, _viz._ the right and left side, suffering no sensible\r\nalteration from the inflection, at least what it does suffer, does rather\r\nincrease the visible Diameter then diminish it, as I shall shew by and by,\r\nthe Figure of the luminous body must necessarily appear somewhat\r\n_Elliptical_.\r\n\r\nThis will be more plain, if in the seventh _Figure_ of the 37. _Scheme_ we\r\nsuppose AB to represent the sensible Horizon; CDEF, the body of the Sun\r\nreally below it; GHIK, the same appearing above it, elevated by the\r\ninflection of the _Atmosphere_: For if, according to the best observation,\r\nwe make the visible Diameter of the Sun to be about three or four and\r\nthirty minutes, and the Horizontal refraction according to _Ticho_ be\r\nthereabout, or somewhat more, the lower limb of the Sun E, will be elevated\r\nto I; but because, by his account, the point C will be elevated but 29.\r\nminutes, as having not so great an inclination upon the inequality of the\r\nAir, therefore IG, which will be the apparent refracted perpendicular\r\nDiameter of the Sun, will be less then CG, which is but 29. minutes, and\r\nconsequently six or seven minutes shorter then the unrefracted apparent\r\nDiameter. The parts, D and F, will be likewise elevated to H and K, whose\r\nrefraction, by reason of its inclination, will be bigger then that of the\r\npoint C, though less then that of E; therefore will the semidiameter IL, be\r\nshorter then LG, and consequently the under side of the appearing Sun more\r\nflat then the upper.\r\n\r\nNow, because the Rays from the right and left sides of the Sun, &c. have\r\nbeen observ’d by _Ricciolo_ and _Grimaldus_, to appear more distant one\r\nfrom another then really they are, though (by very many Observations that I\r\nhave made for that purpose, with a very good _Telescope_, fitted with a\r\ndivided Ruler) I could never perceive any great alteration, yet there being\r\nreally some, it will not be amiss, to shew that this also proceeds from the\r\nrefraction or inflection of the _Atmosphere_; and this will be manifest, if\r\nwe consider the _Atmosphere_ as a transparent Globe, or at least a\r\ntransparent shell, encompassing an opacous Globe, which, being more dense\r\nthen the _medium_ encompassing it, refracts or inflects all the entring\r\nparallel Rays into a point or focus, so that wheresoever the Observator is\r\nplac’d within the _Atmosphere_, between the focus and the luminous body,\r\nthe _lateral_ Rays must necessarily be more converg’d towards his eye by\r\nthe refraction or inflection, then they would have been without it; and\r\ntherefore the Horizontal Diameter of the luminous body must necessarily be\r\naugmented.\r\n\r\nThis might be more plainly manifest to the eye by the sixth _Figure_; but\r\nbecause it would be somwhat tedious, and the thing being obvious enough to\r\nbe imagin’d by any one that attentively considers it, I shall rather omit\r\nit, and proceed to shew, that the mass of Air neer the surface of the\r\nEarth, consists, or is made up, of parcels, which do very much differ from\r\none another in point of density and rarity; and consequently the Rays of\r\nlight that pass through them will be variously inflected, here one way, and\r\nthere another, according as they pass so or so through those differing\r\nparts; and those parts being always in motion, either upwards or downwards,\r\nor to the right or left, or in some way compounded of these, they do by\r\nthis their motion inflect the Rays, now this way, and presently that way.\r\n\r\nThis irregular, unequal and unconstant inflection of the Rays of light, is\r\nthe reason why the limb of the _Sun_, _Moon_, _Jupiter_, _Saturn_, _Mars_,\r\nand _Venus_, appear to wave or dance; and why the body of the Starrs appear\r\nto tremulate or twinkle, their bodies, by this means, being sometimes\r\nmagnify’d, and sometimes diminished; sometimes elevated, otherwhiles\r\ndepress’d; now thrown to the right hand, and then to the left.\r\n\r\nAnd that there is such a property or unequal distribution of parts, is\r\nmanifest from the various degrees of heat and cold that are found in the\r\nAir; from whence will follow a differing density and rarity, both as to\r\nquantity and refraction; and likewise from the vapours that are interpos’d,\r\n(which, by the way, I imagine, as to refraction or inflection, to do the\r\nsame thing, as if they were rarify’d Air; and that those vapours that\r\nascend, are both lighter, and less dense, then the ambient Air which boys\r\nthem up; and that those which descend, are heavier and more dense) The\r\nfirst of these may be found true, if you take a good thick piece of Glass,\r\nand heating it pretty hot in the fire, lay it upon such another piece of\r\nGlass, or hang it in the open Air by a piece of Wire, then looking upon\r\nsome far distant Object (such as a Steeple or Tree) so as the Rays from\r\nthat Object pass directly over the Glass before they enter your eye, you\r\nshall find such a tremulation and wavering of the remote Object, as will\r\nvery much offend your eye: The like tremulous motion you may observe to be\r\ncaus’d by the ascending steams of Water, and the like. Now, from the first\r\nof these it is manifest, that from the rarifaction of the parts of the Air,\r\nby heat, there is caus’d a differing refraction, and from the ascension of\r\nthe more rarify’d parts of the Air, which are thrust up by the colder, and\r\ntherefore more condens’d and heavie, is caus’d an undulation or wavering of\r\nthe Object; for I think, that there are very few will grant, that Glass, by\r\nas gentle a heat as may be endur’d by ones hand, should send forth any of\r\nits parts in steams or vapours, which does not seem to be much wasted by\r\nthat violent fire of the green Glass-house; but, if yet it be doubted, let\r\nExperiment be further made with that body that is accounted, by Chymists\r\nand others, the most ponderous and fix’d in the world; for by heating of a\r\npiece of Gold, and proceeding in the same manner, you may find the same\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThis trembling and shaking of the Rays, is more sensibly caus’d by an\r\nactual flame, or quick fire, or anything else heated glowing hot; as by a\r\nCandle, live Coal, red-hot Iron, or a piece of Silver, and the like: the\r\nsame also appears very conspicuous, if you look at an Object betwixt which\r\nand your eye, the rising smoak of some Chimney is interpos’d; which brings\r\ninto my mind what I had once the opportunity to observe, which was, the Sun\r\nrising to my eye just over a Chimney that sent forth a copious steam of\r\nsmoak; and taking a short _Telescope_, which I had then by me, I observ’d\r\nthe body of the Sun, though it was but just peep’d above the Horizon, to\r\nhave its underside, not onely flatted, and press’d inward, as it usually is\r\nwhen neer the Earth; but to appear more protuberant downwards then if it\r\nhad suffered no refraction at all; and besides all this, the whole body of\r\nthe Sun appear’d to tremble or dance, and the edges or limb to be very\r\nragged or indented, undulating or waving, much in the manner of a flag in\r\nthe Wind.\r\n\r\nThis I have likewise often observ’d in a hot Sunshiny Summer’s day, that\r\nlooking on an Object over a hot stone, or dry hot earth, I have found the\r\nObject to be undulated or shaken, much after the same manner. And if you\r\nlook upon any remote Object through a _Telescope_ (in a hot Summer’s day\r\nespecially) you shall find it likewise to appear tremulous. And further, if\r\nthere chance to blow any wind, or that the air between you and the Object\r\nbe in a motion or current, whereby the parts of it, both rarify’d and\r\ncondens’d, are swiftly remov’d towards the right or left, if then you\r\nobserve the Horizontal ridge of a Hill far distant, through a very good\r\n_Telescope_, you shall find it to wave much like the Sea, and those waves\r\nwill appear to pass the same way with the wind.\r\n\r\nFrom which, and many other Experiments, ’tis cleer that the lower Region of\r\nthe Air, especially that part of it which lieth neerest to the Earth, has,\r\nfor the most part, its constituent parcels variously agitated, either by\r\nheat or winds, by the first of which, some of them are made more rare, and\r\nso suffer a less refraction; others are interwoven, either with ascending\r\nor descending vapours; the former of which being more light, and so more\r\nrarify’d, have likewise a less refraction; the latter being more heavie,\r\nand consequently more dense, have a greater.\r\n\r\nNow, because that heat and cold are equally diffus’d every way; and that\r\nthe further it is spread, the weaker it grows; hence it will follow, that\r\nthe most part of the under Region of the Air will be made up of several\r\nkinds of _lentes_, some whereof will have the properties of _Convex_,\r\nothers of _Concave_ _glasses_, which, that I may the more intelligibly make\r\nout, we will suppose in the eighth _Figure_ of the 37. _Scheme_, that A\r\nrepresents an ascending vapour, which, by reason of its being somewhat\r\n_Heterogeneous_ to the ambient Air, is thereby thrust into a kind of\r\nGlobular form, not any where terminated, but gradually finished, that is,\r\nit is most rarify’d in the middle about A. somewhat more condens’d about\r\nBB, more then that about CC; yet further, about DD, almost of the same\r\ndensity with the ambient Air about EE;, and lastly, inclosed with the more\r\ndense Air FF, so that from A, to FF, there is a continual increase of\r\ndensity. The reason of which will be manifest, if we consider the rising\r\nvapour to be much warmer then the ambient heavie Air; for by the coldness\r\nof the ambient Air, the shell EE will be more refrigerated then DD, and\r\nthat then CC, which will be yet more then BB, and that more then A; so that\r\nfrom F to A, there is a continual increase of heat, and consequently of\r\nrarity; from whence it will necessarily follow, that the Rays of light will\r\nbe inflected or refracted in it, in the same manner as they would be in a\r\n_Concave-glase_; for the Rays _GKI_, _GKI_ will be inflected by _GKH_,\r\n_GKH_, which will easily follow from what I before explained concerning the\r\ninflection of the _Atmosphere_.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, a descending vapour, or any part of the air included by\r\nan ascending vapour, will exhibit the same effects with a _Convex lens_;\r\nfor, if we suppose, in the former Figure, the quite contrary constitution\r\nto that last describ’d; that is, the ambient Air FF being hotter then any\r\npart of that matter within any circle, therefore the coldest part must\r\nnecessarily be A, as being farthest remov’d from the heat, all the\r\nintermediate spaces will be gradually discriminated by the continuall\r\nmixture of heat and cold, so that it will be hotter at EE, then DD, in DD\r\nthen CC, in CC then BB, and in BB then A. From which, a like refraction and\r\ncondensation will follow, and consequently a lesser or greater refraction,\r\nso that every included part will refract more then the including, by which\r\nmeans the Rays, GKI, GKI, coming from a Starr, or some remote Object, are\r\nso inflected, that they will again concurr and meet, in the point M. By the\r\ninterposition therefore of this desending vapour the visible body of the\r\nStar, or other Object, is very much augmented, as by the former it was\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nFrom the quick consecutions of these two, one after another, between the\r\nObject and your eye, caused by their motion upwards or downwards,\r\nproceeding from their levity or gravity, or to the right or left,\r\nproceeding from the wind, a Starr may appear, now bigger, now less, then\r\nreally it would otherwise without them; and this is that property of a\r\nStarr, which is commonly call’d twinkling, or scintillation.\r\n\r\nThe reason why a Star will now appear of one colour, now of another, which\r\nfor the most part happens when ’tis neer the Horizon, may very easily be\r\ndeduc’d from its appearing now in the middle of the vapour, other whiles\r\nneer the edge; for if you look against the body of a Starr with a\r\n_Telescope_ that has a pretty deep _Convex_ Eye-glass, and so order it,\r\nthat the Star may appear sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another\r\nof it; you may perceive this or that particular colour to be predominant in\r\nthe apparent Figure of the Starr, according as it is more or less remote\r\nfrom the middle of the _Lens_. This I had here further explain’d, but that\r\nit does more properly belong to another place.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore onely add some few Quæries, which the consideration of\r\nthese particulars hinted, and so finish this Section.\r\n\r\nAnd the first I shall propound is, Whether there may not be made an\r\nartificial transparent body of an exact Globular Figure that shall so\r\ninflect or refract all the Rays, that, coming from one point, fall upon any\r\n_Hemisphere_ of it; that every one of them may meet on the opposite side,\r\nand cross one another exactly in a point; and that it may do the like also\r\nwith all the Rays that, coming from a _lateral_ point, fall upon any other\r\n_Hemisphere_; for if so, there were to be hoped a perfection of\r\n_Dioptricks_, and a transmigration into heaven, even whil’st we remain here\r\nupon earth in the flesh, and a descending or penetrating into the center\r\nand innermost recesses of the earth, and all earthly bodies; nay, it would\r\nopen not onely a cranney, but a large window (as I may so speak) into the\r\nShop of Nature, whereby we might be enabled to see both the tools and\r\noperators, and the very manner of the operation it self of Nature; this,\r\ncould it be effected, would as farr surpass all other kind of perspectives\r\nas the vast extent of Heaven does the small point of the Earth, which\r\ndistance it would immediately remove, and unite them, as ’twere, into one,\r\nat least, that there should appear no more distance between them then the\r\nlength of the Tube, into the ends of which these Glasses should be\r\ninserted: Now, whether this may not be effected with parcels of Glass of\r\nseveral densities, I have sometimes proceeded so farr as to doubt (though\r\nin truth, as to the general, I have wholly despair’d of it) for I have\r\noften observ’d in Optical Glasses a very great variety of the parts, which\r\nare commonly called Veins; nay, some of them round enough (for they are for\r\nthe most part, drawn out into strings) to constitute a kind of _lens_.\r\n\r\nThis I should further proceed to hope, had any one been so inquisitive as\r\nto have found out the way of making any transparent body, either more dense\r\nor more rare, for then it might be possible to compose a Globule that\r\nshould be more dense in the middle of it, then in any other part, and to\r\ncompose the whole bulk, so as that there should be a continual gradual\r\ntransition from one degree of density to another; such as should be found\r\nrequisite for the desired inflection of the _transmigrating_ Rays; but of\r\nthis enough at present, because I may say more of it when I set down my own\r\nTrials concerning the melioration of _Dioptricks_, where I shall enumerate\r\nwith how many several substances I have made both _Microscopes_, and\r\n_Telescopes_, and by what and how many, ways: Let such as have leisure and\r\nopportunity farther consider it.\r\n\r\nThe next Quæry shall be, whether by the same collection of a more dense\r\nbody then the other, or at least, of the denser part of the other, there\r\nmight not be imagin’d a reason of the apparition of some new fix’d Stars,\r\nas those in the Swan, _Cassiope’s Charr_, _Serpentarius_, _Piscis_,\r\n_Cetus_, &c.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Whether it be possible to define the height of the _Atmosphere_\r\nfrom this inflection of the Rays, or from the Quicksilver Experiment of the\r\nrarifaction or extension of the Air.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Whether the disparity between the upper and under Air be not\r\nsometimes so great, as to make a reflecting superficies; I have had several\r\nObservations which seem to have proceeded from some such cause, but it\r\nwould be too long to relate and examine them. An Experiment, also somewhat\r\nanalogous to this, I have made with Salt-water and Fresh, which two\r\nliquors, in most Positions, seem’d the same, and not to be separated by any\r\ndeterminate superficies, which separating surface yet in some other\r\nPositions did plainly appear.\r\n\r\nAnd if so, Whether the reason of the equal bounding or _terminus_ of the\r\nunder parts of the clouds may not proceed from this cause; whether,\r\nsecondly, the Reason of the apparition of many Suns may not be found out,\r\nby considering how the Rays of the Sun may so be reflected, as to describe\r\na pretty true Image of the body, as we find them from any regular\r\nSuperficies. Whether also this may not be found to cause the apparition of\r\nsome of those _Parelii_, of counterfeit Suns, which appear coloured, by\r\nrefracting the Rays so, as to make the body of the Sun appear in quite\r\nanother place then really it is. But of this more elsewhere.\r\n\r\n5. Whether the _Phænomena_ of the Clouds may not be made out by this\r\ndiversity of density in the upper and under parts of the Air, by supposing\r\nthe Air above them to be much lighter then they themselves are, and they\r\nthemselves to be yet lighter then that which is subjacent to them, many of\r\nthem seeming to be the same substance with the Cobwebs that fly in the Air\r\nafter a Fog.\r\n\r\nNow that such a constitution of the Air and Clouds, if such there be, may\r\nbe sufficient to perform this effect, may be confirm’d by this Experiment.\r\n\r\nMake as strong a Solution of Salt as you are able, then filling a Glass of\r\nsome depth half full with it, fill the other half with fresh Water, and\r\npoyse a little Glass-bubble, so as that it may sink pretty quick in fresh\r\nWater, which take and put into the aforesaid Glass, and you shall find it\r\nto sink till it comes towards the middle, where it will remain fixt,\r\nwithout moving either upwards or downwards. And by a second Experiment, of\r\npoising such a bubble in water, whose upper part is warmer, and\r\nconsequently lighter, then the under, which is colder and heavier; the\r\nmanner of which follows in this next Quæry, which is,\r\n\r\n6. Whether the rarifaction and condensation of Water be not made after the\r\nsame manner, as those effects are produc’d in the Air by heat; for I once\r\npois’d a seal’d up Glass-bubble so exactly, that never so small an addition\r\nwould make it sink, and as small a detraction make it swim, which suffering\r\nto rest in that Vessel of Water for some time, I alwayes found it about\r\nnoon to be at the bottom of the Water, and at night, and in the morning, at\r\nthe top: Imagining this to proceed from the Rarifaction of the Water,\r\ncaus’d by the heat, I made tryal, and found most true; for I was able at\r\nany time, either to depress, or raise it, by heat and cold; for if I let\r\nthe Pipe stand for some time in cold water, I could easily raise the Bubble\r\nfrom the bottom, whither I had a little afore detruded it, by putting the\r\nsame Pipe into warm Water. And this way I have been able, for a very\r\nconsiderable time, to keep a Bubble so poys’d in the Water, as that it\r\nshould remain in the middle, and neither sink, nor swim: For gently heating\r\nthe upper part of the Pipe with a Candle, Coal, or hot Iron, till I\r\nperceived the Bubble begin to descend, then forbearing, I have observed it\r\nto descend to such or such a station, and there to remain suspended for\r\nsome hours, till the heat by degrees were quite vanished, when it would\r\nagain ascend to its former place. This I have also often observed naturally\r\nperformed by the heat of the Air, which being able to rarifie the upper\r\nparts of the Water sooner then the lower, by reason of its immediate\r\ncontact, the heat of the Air has sometimes so slowly increased, that I have\r\nobserved the Bubble to be some hours in passing between the top and bottom.\r\n\r\n7. Whether the appearance of the _Pike_ of _Tenerif_, and several other\r\nhigh Mountains, at so much greater a distance then seems to agree with\r\ntheir respective heights, be not to be attributed to the _Curvature_ of the\r\nvisual Ray, that is made by its passing obliquely through so differingly\r\n_Dense_ a Medium from the top to the eye very far distant in the Horizon:\r\nFor since we have already, I hope, made it very probable, that there is\r\nsuch an _inflection_ of the Rays by the differing density of the parts of\r\nthe Air; and since I have found, by several Experiments made on places\r\ncomparatively not very high, and have yet found the pressure sustain’d by\r\nthose parts of the Air at the top and bottom, and also their differing\r\nExpansions very considerable: Insomuch that I have found the pressure of\r\nthe _Atmosphere_ lighter at the top of St. _Paul_’s Steeple in _London_\r\n(which is about two hundred foot high) then at the bottom by a sixtieth or\r\nfiftieth part, and the expansion at the top greater then that at the bottom\r\nby neer about so much also; for the _Mercurial Cylinder_ at the bottom was\r\nabout 39. inches, and at the top half an inch lower; the Air also included\r\nin the Weather-glass, that at the bottom fill’d only 155. spaces, at the\r\ntop fill’d 158. though the heat at the top and bottom was found exactly the\r\nsame with a scal’d _Thermometer_: I think it very rational to suppose, that\r\nthe greatest Curvature of the Rays is made nearest the Earth, and that the\r\ninflection of the Rays, above 3. or 4. miles upwards, is very\r\ninconsiderable, and therefore that by this means such calculations of the\r\nheight of Mountains, as are made from the distance they are visible in the\r\nHorizon, from the supposal that that Ray is a straight Line (that from the\r\ntop of the Mountain is, as ’twere, a Tangent to the Horizon whence it is\r\nseen) which really is a _Curve_, is very erroneous. Whence, I suppose,\r\nproceeds the reason of the exceedingly differing Opinions and Assertions of\r\nseveral Authors, about the height of several very high Hills.\r\n\r\n8. Whether this Inflection of the Air will not very much alter the supposed\r\ndistances of the Planets, which seem to have a very great dependence upon\r\nthe Hypothetical refraction or inflection of the Air, and that refraction\r\nupon the hypothetical height and density of the Air: For since (as I hope)\r\nI have here shewn the Air to be quite otherwise then has been hitherto\r\nsuppos’d, by manifesting it to be, both of a vast, at least an uncertain,\r\nheight, and of an unconstant and irregular density; It must necessarily\r\nfollow, that its inflection must be varied accordingly: And therefore we\r\nmay hence learn, upon what sure grounds all the Astronomers hitherto have\r\nbuilt, who have calculated the distance of the Planets from their\r\nHorizontal _Parallax_; for since the Refraction and _Parallax_ are so\r\nnearly ally’d, that the one cannot be known without the other, especially\r\nby any wayes that have been yet attempted, how uncertain must the\r\n_Parallax_ be, when the Refraction is unknown? And how easie is it for\r\nAstronomers to assign what distance they please to the Planets, and defend\r\nthem, when they have such a curious _subterfuge_ as that of Refraction,\r\nwherein a very little variation will allow them liberty enough to place the\r\nCelestial Bodies at what distance they please.\r\n\r\nIf therefore we would come to any certainty in this point, we must go other\r\nwayes to work; and as I have here examined the height and refractive\r\nproperty of the Air by other wayes then are usual, so must we find the\r\nParallax of the Planets by wayes not yet practiced; and to this end, I\r\ncannot imagine any better way, then the Observations of them by two persons\r\nat very far distant parts of the Earth, that lye as neer as may be under\r\nthe same Meridian, or Degree of longitude, but differing as much in\r\nlatitude, as there can be places conveniently found: These two persons, at\r\ncertain appointed times, should (as near as could be) both at the same\r\ntime, observe the way of the _Moon_, _Mars_, _Venus_, _Jupiter_, and\r\n_Saturn_, amongst the fixt Stars, with a good large _Telescope_, and making\r\nlittle Iconismes, or pictures, of the small fixed Stars, that appear to\r\neach of them to lye in or near the way of the Center of the Planet, and the\r\nexact measure of the apparent Diameter; from the comparing of such\r\nObservations together, we might certainly know the true distance, or\r\nParallax, of the Planet. And having any one true Parallax of these Planets,\r\nwe might very easily have the other by their apparent Diameters, which the\r\n_Telescope_ likewise affords us very accurately. And thence their motions\r\nmight be much better known, and their Theories more exactly regulated. And\r\nfor this purpose I know not any one place more convenient for such an\r\nObservation to be made in, then in the Island of St. _Helena_, upon the\r\nCoast of _Africk_, which lyes about sixteen degrees to the Southwards of\r\nthe Line, and is very near, according to the latest Geographical Maps, in\r\nthe same Meridian with _London_; for though they may not perhaps lye\r\nexactly in the same, yet their Observations, being ordered according to\r\nwhat I shall anon shew, it will not be difficult to find the true distance\r\nof the Planet. But were they both under the same Meridian, it would be much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nAnd because Observations may be much easier, and more accurately made with\r\ngood _Telescopes_, then with any other Instruments, it will not, I suppose,\r\nseem impertinent to explain a little what wayes I judge most fit and\r\nconvenient for that particular. Such therefore as shall be the Observators\r\nfor this purpose, should be furnished with the best _Telescopes_ that can\r\nbe had, the longer the better and more exact will their Observations be,\r\nthough they are somewhat the more difficultly manag’d. These should be\r\nfitted with a _Rete_, or divided Scale, plac’d at such a distance within\r\nthe Eye-glass, that they may be distinctly seen, which should be the\r\nmeasures of minutes and seconds; by this Instrument each Observator should,\r\nat certain prefixt times, observe the Moon, or other Planet, in, or very\r\nnear, the Meridian; and because it may be very difficult to find two\r\nconvenient stations that will happen to be just under the same Meridian,\r\nthey shall, each of them, observe the way of the Planet, both for an hour\r\nbefore, and an hour after, it arrive at the Meridian; and by a line, or\r\nstroke, amongst the small fixed Stars, they shall denote out the way that\r\neach of them observ’d the Center of the Planet to be mov’d in for those two\r\nhours: These Observations each of them shall repeat for many dayes\r\ntogether, that both it may happen, that both of them may sometimes make\r\ntheir Observations together, and that from divers Experiments we may be the\r\nbetter assured of what certainty and exactness such kind of Observations\r\nare like to prove. And because many of the Stars which may happen to come\r\nwithin the compass of such an _Iconism_, or Map, may be such as are only\r\nvisible through a good _Telescope_, whose Positions perhaps have not been\r\nnoted, nor their longitudes, or latitudes, any where remarked; therefore\r\neach Observator should indeavour to insert some fixt Star, whose longitude,\r\nand latitude, is known; or with his _Telescope_ he shall find the Position\r\nof some notable _telescopical_ Star, inserted in his Map, to some known\r\nfixt Star, whose place in the _Zodiack_ is well defin’d.\r\n\r\nHaving by this means found the true distance of the Moon, and having\r\nobserved well the _apparent Diameter_ of it at that time with a good\r\n_Telescope_, it is easie enough, by one single Observation of the apparent\r\nDiameter of the Moon with a good Glass, to determine her distances in any\r\nother part of her _Orbit_, or _Dragon_, and consequently, some few\r\nObservations will tell us, whether she be mov’d in an _Ellipsis_, (which,\r\nby the way, may also be found, even now, though I think we are yet ignorant\r\nof her true distance) and next (which without such Observations, I think,\r\nwe shall not be sure of) we may know exactly the bigness of that\r\n_Ellipsis_, or Circle, and her true velocity in each part, and thereby be\r\nmuch the better inabled to find out the true cause of all her Motions. And\r\nthough, even now also, we may, by such Observations in one station, as here\r\nat _London_, observe the _apparent Diameter_ and motion of the Moon in her\r\n_Dragon_, and consequently be inabled to make a better ghess at the\r\n_Species_ or kind of Curve, in which she is mov’d, that is, whether it be\r\nsphærical, or _elliptical_, or neither, and with what proportional\r\nvelocities she is carried in that Curve; yet till her true _Parallax_ be\r\nknown, we cannot determine either.\r\n\r\nNext, for the true distance of the Sun, the best way will be, by accurate\r\nObservations, made in both these forementioned stations, of some convenient\r\nEclipse of the Sun, many of which may so happen, as to be seen by both; for\r\nthe _Penumbra_ of the Moon may, if she be sixty Semidiameters distant from\r\nthe Earth, and the Sun above seven thousand, extend to about seventy\r\ndegrees on the Earth, and consequently be seen by Observators as far\r\ndistant as _London_, and St. _Helena_, which are not full sixty nine\r\ndegrees distant. And this would much more accurately, then any way that has\r\nbeen yet used, determine the Parallax, and distance, of the Sun; for as for\r\nthe Horizontal Parallax I have already shewn it sufficiently uncertain; nor\r\nis the way of finding it by the Eclipse of the Moon any other then\r\nhypothetical; and that by the difference of the true and apparent\r\nquadrature of the Moon is not less uncertain, witness their Deductions from\r\nit, who have made use of it; for _Vendeline_ puts that difference to be but\r\n4′.30″. whence he deduces a vast distance of the Sun, as I have before\r\nshewn. _Ricciolo_ makes it full 30′.00. but _Reinoldus_, and _Kircher_, no\r\nless then three degrees. And no wonder, for if we examine the _Theory_, we\r\nshall find it so complicated with uncertainties.\r\n\r\nFirst, From the irregular surface of the Moon, and from several Parallaxes,\r\nthat unless the _Dichotomy_ happen in the _Nonagesimus_ of the _Ecliptick_,\r\nand that in the Meridian, &c. all which happen so very seldom, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to make them otherwise then uncertainly. Besides, we are\r\nnot yet certain, but that there may be somewhat about the Moon _analogus_\r\nto the Air about the Earth, which may cause a refraction of the light of\r\nthe Sun, and consequently make a great difference in the apparent\r\n_dichotomy_ of the Moon. Their way indeed is very rational and ingenious;\r\nand such as is much to be preferred before the way by the Horizontal\r\nParallax, could all the uncertainties be remov’d, and were the true\r\ndistance of the Moon known.\r\n\r\nBut because we find by the Experiments of _Vendiline_, _Reinoldus_, &c.\r\nthat Observations of this kind are very uncertain also: It were to be\r\nwisht, that such kind of Observations, made at two very distant stations,\r\nwere promoted. And it is so much the more desirable, because, from what I\r\nhave now shewn of the nature of the Air, it is evident, that the refraction\r\nmay be very much greater then all the Astronomers hitherto have imagined\r\nit: And consequently, that the distance of the Moon, and other Planets, may\r\nbe much lesse then what they have hitherto made it.\r\n\r\nFor first, this Inflection, I have here propounded, will allow the shadow\r\nof the Earth to be much shorter then it can be made by the other\r\n_Hypothesis_ of refraction, and consequently, the Moon will not suffer an\r\nEclipse, unless it comes very much nearer the Earth then the Astronomers\r\nhitherto have supposed it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, There will not in this _Hypothesis_ be any other shadow of the\r\nEarth, such as _Kepler_ supposes, and calls the _Penumbra_, which is the\r\nshadow of the refracting _Atmosphere_; for the bending of the Rays being\r\naltogether caus’d by _Inflection_, as I have already shewn, all that part\r\nwhich is ascribed by _Kepler_, and others after him, to the _Penumbra_, or\r\ndark part, which is without the _umbra terræ_, does clear vanish; for in\r\nthis _Hypothesis_ there is no refracting surface of the Air, and\r\nconsequently there can be no shadows, such as appear in the ninth Figure of\r\nthe 37. _Scheme_, where let ABCD represent the Earth, and EFGH the\r\n_Atmosphere_, which according to _Keplers_ supposition, is like a Sphære of\r\nWater terminated with an exact surface EFGH, let the lines MF, LB, ID, KH,\r\nrepresent the Rays of the Sun; ’tis manifest, that all the Rayes between\r\nLB, and ID, will be reflected by the surface of the Earth BAD, and\r\nconsequently, the conical space BOD would be dark and obscure; but, say the\r\nfollowers of _Kepler_, the Rays between MF, and LB, and between ID, and KH,\r\nfalling on the _Atmosphere_, are refracted, both at their ingress and\r\negress out of the _Atmosphere_, nearer towards the Axis of the sphærical\r\nshadow CO, and consequently, inlighten a great part of that former dark\r\nCone, and shorten, and contract, its top to N. And because of this\r\nReflection of these Rays, say they, there is superinduc’d another shell of\r\na dark Cone FPH, whose Apex P is yet further distant from the Earth: By\r\nthis _Penumbra_, say they, the Moon is Eclipsed, for it alwayes passes\r\nbetween the lines 12, and 34.\r\n\r\nTo which I say, That if the Air be such, as I have newly shewn it to be,\r\nand consequently cause such an inflection of the Rays that fall into it,\r\nthose dark _Penumbra’s_ FYZQ, HXVT, and ORPS, will all vanish. For if we\r\nsuppose the Air indefinitely extended, and to be no where bounded with a\r\ndeterminate refracting surface, as I have shewn it uncapable of having,\r\nfrom the nature of it; it will follow, that the Moon will no where be\r\ntotally obscured, but when it is below the Apex N, of the dark blunt Cone\r\nof the Earth’s shadow: Now, from the supposition, that the Sun is distant\r\nabout seven thousand Diameters, the point N, according to calculation,\r\nbeing not above twenty five terrestrial Semidiameters from the Center of\r\nthe Earth: It follows, that whensoever the Moon eclipsed is totally\r\ndarkned, without affording any kind of light, it must be within twenty five\r\nSemidiameters of the Earth, and consequently much lower then any\r\nAstronomers have hitherto put it.\r\n\r\nThis will seem much more consonant to the rest of the secundary Planets;\r\nfor the highest of _Jupiter’s_ Moons is between twenty and thirty _Jovial\r\nSemidiameters_ distant from the Center of _Jupiter_; and the Moons of\r\n_Saturn_ much about the same number of _Saturnial Semidiameters_ from the\r\nCenter of that Planet.\r\n\r\nBut these are but conjectures also, and must be determin’d by such kind of\r\nObservations as I have newly mention’d.\r\n\r\nNor will it be difficult, by this _Hypothesis_, to salve all the\r\nappearances of Eclipses of the Moon, for in this _Hypothesis_ also, there\r\nwill be on each side of the shadow of the Earth, a _Penumbra_, not caus’d\r\nby the Refraction of the Air, as in the _Hypothesis_ of _Kepler_; but by\r\nthe faint inlightning of it by the Sun: For if, in the sixth Figure, we\r\nsuppose ESQ, and GSR, to be the Rays that terminate the shadow from either\r\nside of the Earth; ESQ coming from the upper limb of the Sun, and GSR from\r\nthe under; it will follow, that the shadow of the Earth, within those Rays,\r\nthat is, the Cone GSE, will be totally dark. But the Sun being not a point,\r\nbut a large _area_ of light, there will be a secondary dark Cone of shadow\r\nEPG, which will be caus’d by the earth’s hindring part of the Rays of the\r\nSun from falling on the parts GPR, and EPQ, of which halved shadow, or\r\n_Penumbra_, that part will appear brightest which lyes nearest the\r\nterminating Rayes GP, and EP, and those darker that lye nearest to GS, and\r\nES: when therefore the Moon appears quite dark in the middle of the\r\nEclipse, she must be below S, that is, between S and F; when she appears\r\nlighter near the middle of the Eclipse, she must pass some where between RQ\r\nand S; and when she is alike light through the whole Eclipse, she must pass\r\nbetween RQ, and P.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LIX. _Of multitudes of small _Stars_ discoverable by the\r\n_Telescope_._\r\n\r\nHaving, in the last Observation, premis’d some particulars observable in\r\nthe _medium_, through which we must look upon _Cœlestial_ Objects, I shall\r\nhere add one Observation of the Bodies themselves; and for a _specimen_ I\r\nhave made choice of the _Pleiades_, or seven Stars, commonly so called\r\n(though in our time and Climate there appear no more then six to the naked\r\neye) and this I did the rather, because the deservedly famous _Galileo_,\r\nhaving publisht a Picture of this _Asterisme_, was able, it seems, with his\r\nGlass to discover no more then thirty six, whereas with a pretty good\r\ntwelve foot _Telescope_, by which I drew this 38 _Iconism_, I could very\r\nplainly discover seventy eight, placed in the order they are ranged in the\r\nFigure, and of as many differing Magnitudes as the _Asterisks_, wherewith\r\nthey are Marked, do specifie; there being no less then fourteen several\r\nMagnitudes of those Stars, which are compris’d within the draught, the\r\nbiggest whereof is not accounted greater then one of the third Magnitude;\r\nand indeed that account is much too big, if it be compared with other Stars\r\nof the third Magnitude, especially by the help of a _Telescope_; for then\r\nby it may be perceiv’d, that its splendor, to the naked eye, may be\r\nsomewhat augmented by the three little Stars immediately above it, which\r\nare near adjoyning to it. The _Telescope_ also discovers a great variety,\r\neven in the bigness of those, commonly reckon’d, of the first, second,\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, and sixth Magnitude; so that should they be\r\ndistinguish’d thereby, those six Magnitudes would, at least, afford no less\r\nthen thrice that number of Magnitudes, plainly enough distinguishable by\r\ntheir Magnitude, and brightness; so that a good twelve foot Glass would\r\nafford us no less then twenty five several Magnitudes. Nor are these all,\r\nbut a longer Glass does yet further, both more nicely distinguish the\r\nMagnitudes of those already noted, and also discover several other of\r\nsmaller Magnitudes, not discernable by the twelve foot Glass: Thus have I\r\nbeen able, with a good thirty six foot Glass, to discover many more Stars\r\nin the _Pleiades_ then are here delineated, and those of three or four\r\ndistinct Magnitudes less then any of those spots of the fourteenth\r\nMagnitude. And by the twinkling of divers other places of this _Asterisme_,\r\nwhen the Sky was very clear, I am apt to think, that with longer Glasses,\r\nor such as would bear a bigger _aperture_, there might be discovered\r\nmultitudes of other small Stars, yet inconspicuous. And indeed, for the\r\ndiscovery of small Stars, the bigger the _aperture_ be, the better adapted\r\nis the Glass; for though perhaps it does make the several specks more\r\nradiant, and glaring, yet by that means, uniting more Rays very near to one\r\npoint, it does make many of those radiant points conspicuous, which, by\r\nputting on a less _aperture_, may be found to vanish; and therefore, both\r\nfor the discovery of the fixt Star, and for finding the _Satellites_ of\r\n_Jupiter_, before it be out of the day, or twilight, I alwayes leave the\r\nObject-glass as clear without any _aperture_ as I can, and have thereby\r\nbeen able to discover the _Satellites_ a long while before; I was able to\r\ndiscern them, when the smaller _apertures_ were put on; and at other times,\r\nto see multitudes of other smaller Stars, which a smaller _aperture_ makes\r\nto disappear.\r\n\r\nIn that notable _Asterism_ also of the Sword of _Orion_, where the\r\ningenious Monsieur _Hugens van Zulichem_ has discovered only three little\r\nStars in a cluster, I have with a thirty six foot Glass, without any\r\n_aperture_ (the breadth of the Glass being about some three inches and a\r\nhalf) discover’d five, and the twinkling of divers others up and down in\r\ndivers parts of that small milky Cloud.\r\n\r\nSo that ’tis not unlikely, but that the meliorating of _Telescopes_ will\r\nafford as great a variety of new Discoveries in the Heavens, as better\r\n_Microscopes_ would among small terrestrial Bodies, and both would give us\r\ninfinite cause, more and more to admire the omnipotence of the Creator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nObserv. LX. _Of the _Moon_._\r\n\r\nHaving a pretty large corner of the Plate for the seven Starrs, void, for\r\nthe filling it up, I have added one small _Specimen_ of the appearance of\r\nthe parts of the Moon, by describing a small spot of it, which, though\r\ntaken notice of, both by the Excellent _Hevelius_, and called _Mons\r\nOlympus_ (though I think somewhat improperly, being rather a vale) and\r\nrepresented by the Figure X. of the 38. _Scheme_, and also by the Learn’d\r\n_Ricciolus_, who calls it _Hipparchus_, and describes it by the Figure Y,\r\nyet how far short both of them come of the truth, may be somewhat perceiv’d\r\nby the draught, which I have here added of it, in the Figure Z, (which I\r\ndrew by a thirty foot Glass, in _October_ 1664. just before the Moon was\r\nhalf inlightned) but much better by the Reader’s diligently observing it\r\nhimself, at a convenient time, with a Glass of that length, and much better\r\nyet with one of threescore foot long, for through these it appears a very\r\nspacious Vale, incompassed with a ridge of Hills, not very high in\r\ncomparison of many other in the Moon, nor yet very steep. The Vale it self\r\nABCD, is much of the figure of a Pear, and from several appearances of it,\r\nseems to be some very fruitful place, that is, to have its surface all\r\ncovered over with some kinds of vegetable substances; for in all positions\r\nof the light on it, it seems to give a much fainter reflection then the\r\nmore barren tops of the incompassing Hills, and those a much fainter then\r\ndivers other cragged, chalky, or rocky Mountains of the Moon. So that I am\r\nnot unapt to think, that the Vale may have Vegetables _analogus_ to our\r\nGrass, Shrubs, and Trees; and most of these incompassing Hills may be\r\ncovered with so thin a vegetable Coat, as we may observe the Hills with us\r\nto be, such as the short Sheep pasture which covers the Hills of\r\n_Salisbury_ Plains.\r\n\r\nUp and down in several parts of this place here describ’d (as there are\r\nmultitudes in other places all over the surface of the Moon) may be\r\nperceived several kinds of pits, which are shap’d almost like a dish, some\r\nbigger, some less, some shallower, some deeper, that is, they seem to be a\r\nhollow _Hemisphere_, incompassed with a round rising bank, as if the\r\nsubstance in the middle had been digg’d up, and thrown on either side.\r\nThese seem to me to have been the effects of some motions within the body\r\nof the Moon, _analogus_ to our Earthquakes, by the eruption of which, as it\r\nhas thrown up a brim, or ridge, round about, higher then the Ambient\r\nsurface of the Moon, so has it left a hole, or depression, in the middle,\r\nproportionably lower; divers places resembling some of these, I have\r\nobserv’d here in _England_, on the tops of some Hills, which might have\r\nbeen caus’d by some Earthquake in the younger dayes of the world. But that\r\nwhich does most incline me to this belief, is, first, the generality and\r\ndiversity of the Magnitude of these pits all over the body of the Moon.\r\nNext, the two experimental wayes, by which I have made a representation of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe first was with a very soft and well temper’d mixture of Tobacco-pipe\r\nclay and Water, into which, if I let fall any heavy body, as a Bullet, it\r\nwould throw up the mixture round the place, which for a while would make a\r\nrepresentation, not unlike these of the Moon; but considering the state and\r\ncondition of the Moon, there seems not any probability to imagine, that it\r\nshould proceed from any cause _analogus_ to this; for it would be difficult\r\nto imagine whence those bodies should come; and next, how the substance of\r\nthe Moon should be so soft; but if a Bubble be blown under the surface of\r\nit, and suffer’d to rise, and break; or if a Bullet, or other body, sunk in\r\nit, be pull’d out from it, these departing bodies leave an impression on\r\nthe surface of the mixture, exactly like these of the Moon, save that these\r\nalso quickly subside and vanish. But the second, and most notable,\r\nrepresentation was, what I observ’d in a pot of boyling Alabaster, for\r\nthere that powder being by the eruption of vapours reduc’d to a kind of\r\nfluid consistence, if, whil’st it boyls, it be gently remov’d besides the\r\nfire, the Alabaster presently ceasing to boyl, the whole surface,\r\nespecially that where some of the last Bubbles have risen, will appear all\r\nover covered with small pits, exactly shap’d like these of the Moon, and by\r\nholding a lighted Candle in a large dark Room, in divers positions to this\r\nsurface, you may exactly represent all the _Phænomena_ of these pits in the\r\nMoon, according as they are more or less inlightned by the Sun.\r\n\r\nAnd that there may have been in the Moon some such motion as this, which\r\nmay have made these pits, will seem the more probable, if we suppose it\r\nlike our Earth, for the Earthquakes here with us seem to proceed from some\r\nsuch cause, as the boyling of the pot of Alabaster, there seeming to be\r\ngenerated in the Earth from some subterraneous fires, or heat, great\r\nquantities of vapours, that is, of expanded aerial substances, which not\r\npresently finding a passage through the ambient parts of the Earth, do, as\r\nthey are increased by the supplying and generating principles, and thereby\r\n(having not sufficient room to expand themselves) extreamly condens’d, at\r\nlast overpower, with their _elastick_ properties, the resistence of the\r\nincompassing Earth, and lifting it up, or cleaving it, and so shattering of\r\nthe parts of the Earth above it, do at length, where they find the parts of\r\nthe Earth above them more loose, make their way upwards, and carrying a\r\ngreat part of the Earth before them, not only raise a small brim round\r\nabout the place, out of which they break, but for the most part\r\nconsiderable high Hills and Mountains, and when they break from under the\r\nSea, divers times, mountainous Islands; this seems confirm’d by the\r\n_Vulcans_ in several places of the Earth, the mouths of which, for the most\r\npart, are incompassed with a Hill of a considerable height, and the tops of\r\nthose Hills, or Mountains, are usually shap’d very much like these pits, or\r\ndishes, of the Moon: Instances of this we have in the descriptions of\r\n_Ætna_ in _Sicily_, of _Hecla_ in _Iceland_, of _Tenerif_ in the\r\n_Canaries_, of the several _Vulcans_ in _New-Spain_, describ’d by _Gage_,\r\nand more especially in the eruption of late years in one of the _Canary_\r\nIslands. In all of which there is not only a considerable high Hill raised\r\nabout the mouth of the _Vulcan_, but, like the spots of the Moon, the top\r\nof those Hills are like a dish, or bason. And indeed, if one attentively\r\nconsider the nature of the thing, one may find sufficient reason to judge,\r\nthat it cannot be otherwise; for these eruptions, whether of fire, or\r\nsmoak, alwayes raising great quantities of Earth before them, must\r\nnecessarily, by the fall of those parts on either side, raise very\r\nconsiderable heaps.\r\n\r\nNow, both from the figures of them, and from several other circumstances;\r\nthese pits in the Moon seem to have been generated much after the same\r\nmanner that the holes in Alabaster, and the _Vulcans_ of the Earth are\r\nmade. For first, it is not improbable, but that the substance of the Moon\r\nmay be very much like that of our Earth, that is, may consist of an earthy,\r\nsandy, or rocky substance, in several of its superficial parts, which parts\r\nbeing agitated, undermin’d, or heav’d up, by eruptions of vapours, may\r\nnaturally be thrown into the same kind of figured holes, as the small dust,\r\nor powder of Alabaster. Next, it is not improbable, but that there may be\r\ngenerated, within the body of the Moon, divers such kind of internal fires\r\nand heats, as may produce such Exhalations; for since we can plainly enough\r\ndiscover with a _Telescope_, that there are multitudes of such kind of\r\neruptions in the body of the Sun it self, which is accounted the most noble\r\nÆtherial body, certainly we need not be much scandaliz’d at such kind of\r\nalterations, or corruptions, in the body of this lower and less\r\nconsiderable part of the universe, the Moon, which is only secundary, or\r\nattendant, on the bigger, and more considerable body of the Earth. Thirdly,\r\n’tis not unlikely, but that supposing such a sandy or mouldring substance\r\nto be there found, and supposing also a possibility of the generation of\r\nthe internal _elastical_ body (whether you will call it air or vapours)\r\n’tis not unlikely, I say, but that there is in the Moon a principle of\r\ngravitation, such as in the Earth. And to make this probable, I think, we\r\nneed no better Argument, then the roundness, or globular Figure of the body\r\nof the Moon it self, which we may perceive very plainly by the _Telescope_,\r\nto be (bating the small inequality of the Hills and Vales in it, which are\r\nall of them likewise shap’d, or levelled, as it were, to answer to the\r\ncenter of the Moons body) perfectly of a Sphærical figure, that is, all the\r\nparts of it are so rang’d (bating the comparatively small ruggedness of the\r\nHills and Dales) that the outmost bounds of them are equally distant from\r\nthe Center of the Moon, and consequently, it is exceedingly probable also,\r\nthat they are equidistant from the Center of gravitation; and indeed, the\r\nfigure of the superficial parts of the Moon are so exactly shap’d,\r\naccording as they should be, supposing it had a gravitating principle as\r\nthe Earth has, that even the figure of those parts themselves is of\r\nsufficient efficacy to make the gravitation, and the other two suppositions\r\nprobable: so that the other suppositions may be rather prov’d by this\r\nconsiderable Circumstance, or Observation, then this suppos’d Explication\r\ncan by them; for he that shall attentively observe with an excellent\r\n_Telescope_, how all the Circumstances, notable in the shape of the\r\nsuperficial parts, are, as it were, exactly adapted to suit with such a\r\nprinciple, will, if he well considers the usual method of Nature in its\r\nother proceedings, find abundant argument to believe it to have really\r\nthere also such a principle; for I could never observe, among all the\r\nmountainous or prominent parts of the Moon (whereof there is a huge\r\nvariety) that any one part of it was plac’d in such a manner, that if there\r\nshould be a gravitating, or attracting principle in the body of the Moon,\r\nit would make that part to fall, or be mov’d out of its visible posture.\r\nNext, the shape and position of the parts is such, that they all seem put\r\ninto those very shapes they are in by a gravitating power: For first, there\r\nare but very few clifts, or very steep declivities in the ascent of these\r\nMountains; for besides those Mountains, which are by _Hevelius_ call’d the\r\n_Apennine_ Mountains, and some other, which seem to border on the Seas of\r\nthe Moon, and those only upon one side, as is common also in those Hills\r\nthat are here on the Earth; there are very few that seem to have very steep\r\nascents, but, for the most part, they are made very round, and much\r\nresemble the make of the Hills and Mountains also of the Earth; this may be\r\npartly perceived by the Hills incompassing this Vale, which I have here\r\ndescrib’d; and as on the Earth also, the middlemost of these Hills seems\r\nthe highest, so is it obvious also, through a good _Telescope_, in those of\r\nthe Moon; the Vales also in many are much shap’d like those of the Earth,\r\nand I am apt to think, that could we look upon the Earth from the Moon,\r\nwith a good _Telescope_, we might easily enough perceive its surface to be\r\nvery much like that of the Moon.\r\n\r\nNow whereas in this small draught, (as there would be multitudes if the\r\nwhole Moon were drawn after this manner) there are several little\r\nEbullitions, or Dishes, even in the Vales themselves, and in the\r\nincompassing Hills also; this will, from this supposition, (which I have, I\r\nthink, upon very good reason taken) be exceeding easily explicable; for, as\r\nI have several times also observ’d, in the surface of Alabaster so ordered,\r\nas I before describ’d, so may the later eruptions of vapours be even in the\r\nmiddle, or on the edges of the former; and other succeeding these also in\r\ntime may be in the middle or edges of these, &c. of which there are\r\nInstances enough in divers parts of the body of the Moon, and by a boyling\r\npot of Alabaster will be sufficiently exemplifi’d.\r\n\r\nTo conclude therefore, it being very probable, that the Moon has a\r\nprinciple of gravitation, it affords an excellent distinguishing Instance\r\nin the search after the cause of gravitation, or attraction, to hint, that\r\nit does not depend upon the diurnal or turbinated motion of the Earth, as\r\nsome have somewhat inconsiderately supposed and affirmed it to do; for if\r\nthe Moon has an attractive principle, whereby it is not only shap’d round,\r\nbut does firmly contain and hold all its parts united, though many of them\r\nseem as loose as the sand on the Earth, and that the Moon is not mov’d\r\nabout its Center; then certainly the turbination cannot be the cause of the\r\nattraction of the Earth, and therefore some other principle must be thought\r\nof, that will agree with all the secundary as well as primary Planets. But\r\nthis, I confess, is but a probability, and not a demonstration, which (from\r\nany Observation yet made) it seems hardly capable of, though how successful\r\nfuture indeavours (promoted by the meliorating of Glasses, and observing\r\nparticular circumstances) may be in this, or any other, kind, must be with\r\npatience expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TABLE.\r\n\r\nObservat. 1.

Of small Vine-Mites.\r\n\r\n_A description of them; a ghess at their original; their exceeding smalness\r\ncompar’d with that of a Wood-louse, from which they may be suppos’d to\r\ncome._\r\n\r\nObserv. 57. Of Vinegar-worms.\r\n\r\n_A description of them, with some considerations on their motions._\r\n\r\nObs. 58. Of the Inflection of the Rays of Light in the Air.\r\n\r\n_A short rehearsal of several _Phænomena_. An attempt to explicate them:\r\nthe supposition founded on two Propositions, both which are indeavoured to\r\nbe made out by several Experiments, What density and rarity is in respect\r\nof refraction: the refraction of Spirit of Wine compared with that of\r\ncommon Water: the refraction of Ice. An Experiment of making an Undulation\r\nof the Rays by the mixing of Liquors of differing density. The explication\r\nof _inflection_, mechanically and hypothetically: what Bodies have such an\r\ninflection. Several Experiments to shew that the Air has this propriety;\r\nthat it proceeds from the differing density of the Air: that the upper and\r\nunder part of the Air are of differing density: some Experiments to prove\r\nthis. A Table of the strength of the spring of the Air, answering to each\r\ndegree of extension; when first made, and when repeated. Another Experiment\r\nof compressing the Air. A Table of the strength of the Air, answering to\r\neach compression and expansion; from which the height of the Air may be\r\nsuppos’d indefinite; to what degree the Air is rarifi’d at any distance\r\nabove the Surface of the Earth: how, from this, Inflection is inferr’d; and\r\nseveral _Phænomena_ explain’d. That the Air near the Earth is compos’d of\r\nparts of differing density; made probable by several Experiments and\r\nObservations; how this propriety produces the effects of the waving and\r\ndancing of Bodies; and of the twinkling of the Stars. Several _Phænomena_\r\nexplicated. Some Quæries added._\r\n\r\n1. _Whether this Principle may not be made use of, for perfecting Optick\r\nGlasses? What might be hoped from it if it were to be done?_\r\n\r\n2. _Whether from this Principle the apparition of some new Stars may not be\r\nexplicated?_\r\n\r\n3. _Whether the height of the Air may be defin’d by it?_\r\n\r\n4. _Whether there may not sometimes be so great a disparity of density\r\nbetween the upper and under parts of the Air, as to make a reflecting\r\nSurface?_\r\n\r\n5. _Whether, if so, this will not explicate the _Phænomena_ of the Clouds.\r\nAn Experiment to this purpose?_\r\n\r\n7. _Whether the Rayes from the top of Mountains are not bended into\r\nCurve-lines by inflection? An Argument for it, taken from an Experiment\r\nmade on St. _Paul_’s Steeple._\r\n\r\n8. _Whether the distance of the Planets will not be more difficult to be\r\nfound? What wayes are most likely to rectifie the distance of the Moon: the\r\nway of fitting _Telescopes_ for such Observations. How to make the\r\nObservations, and how from them to find the true distance of the Moon at\r\nany time. How the distance of the Sun may be found by two Observators. The\r\nway by the Dichotomy of the Moon uncertain. That the distance of the Moon\r\nmay be less then it has been hitherto suppos’d. _Kepler_’s Supposition not\r\nso probable: the explication of the _Phænomena_ by another _Hypothesis_._\r\n\r\nObserv. 59. Of the fixt Stars.\r\n\r\n_Of the multitudes of Stars discoverable by the _Telescope_, and the\r\nvariety of their magnitudes: 78. Stars distinguisht in the _Pleiades_: that\r\nthere are degrees of bigness even in the Stars accounted of the same\r\nmagnitude: the longer the Glasses are, and the bigger apertures they will\r\nindure, the more fit they are for these discoveries: that ’tis probable,\r\nlonger Glasses would yet make greater discoveries. 5. Stars discover’d in\r\nthe _Galaxie_ of _Orion_’s Sword._\r\n\r\nObserv. 60. Of the Moon.\r\n\r\n_A description of a Vale in the Moon; what call’d by _Hevelius_ and\r\n_Ricciolus_, and how describ’d by them: with what substances the hills of\r\nthe Moon may be cover’d. A description of the pits of the Moon, and a\r\nconjecture at their cause: two Experiments that make it probable, that of\r\nthe surface of boyl’d Alabaster dust seeming the most likely to be\r\nresembled by eruptions of vapours out of the body of the Moon: that\r\nEarthquakes seem to be generated much the same way, and their effects seem\r\nvery similar. An Argument that there may be such variations in the Moon,\r\nbecause greater have been observ’d in the Sun: because the substance of the\r\nMoon and Earth seem much alike: and because ’tis probable the Moon has a\r\ngravitating principle: this is argued from several particulars. The reason\r\nwhy several pits are one within another. The use that may be made of this\r\nInstance of a gravity in the Moon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _Schem._ 2. _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n[2] Diop. ch. 10. § 9.\r\n\r\n[3] _Schem._ 2. _Fig._ 2.\r\n\r\n[4] _Schem._ 1.* _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\n[5] _Schem._ 3. _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n[6] _Schem._ 3. _Fig._ 2.\r\n\r\n[7] _Schem._ 4.\r\n\r\n[8] _Schem._ 4. _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n[9] _Schem._ 6. _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\n[10] _Schem._ 6. _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\n[11] _Schem._ 8. _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n[12] _Schem._ 8. _Fig._ 2.\r\n\r\n[13] _Schem._ 9. _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\n    [14] See _Schem._ 11. _Fig._ 2.\r\n\r\n[15] _Fig._ 1. _Schem._ 36.\r\n\r\n[16] _Fig._ 3.",
