But it does not deal, in its present form, with the geology \r\nof the neighbourhood of Chester only.  I have tried so to recast it, \r\nthat any townsman, at least in the manufacturing districts of England \r\nand Scotland, may learn from it to judge, roughly perhaps, but on the \r\nwhole accurately, of the rocks and soils of his own neighbourhood.  \r\nHe will find, it is true, in these pages, little or nothing about \r\nthose \"Old Red Sandstones,\" so interesting to a Scotchman; and he \r\nwill have to bear in mind, if he belong to the coal districts of \r\nScotland, that the \"stones in the wall\" there belong to much older \r\nrocks than those \"New Red Sandstones\" of which this book treats; and \r\nthat the coal measures of Scotland, with the volcanic rocks which \r\nhave disturbed them, are often very different in appearance to the \r\nEnglish coal measures.  But he will soon learn to distinguish the \r\nrelative age of rocks by the fossils found in them, which he can now, \r\nhappily, study in many local museums; and he may be certain, for the \r\nrest, that all rocks and soils whatsoever which he may meet have been \r\nlaid down by the agents, and according to the laws, which I have \r\ntried to set forth in this book; and these only require, for the \r\nlearning of them, the exercise of his own observation and common \r\nsense.  I have not tried to make this a handbook of geological facts.  \r\nSuch a guide (and none better) the young man will find in Sir Charles \r\nLyell's \"Student's Elements of Geology.\"  I have tried rather to \r\nteach the method of geology, than its facts; to furnish the student \r\nwith a key to all geology, rough indeed and rudimentary, but sure and \r\nsound enough, I trust, to help him to unlock most geological problems \r\nwhich he may meet, in any quarter of the globe.  But young men must \r\nremember always, that neither this book, nor all the books in the \r\nworld, will make them geologists.  No amount of book learning will \r\nmake a man a scientific man; nothing but patient observation, and \r\nquiet and fair thought over what he has observed.  He must go out for \r\nhimself, see for himself, compare and judge for himself, in the \r\nfield, the quarry, the cutting.  He must study rocks, ores, fossils, \r\nin the nearest museum; and thus store his head, not with words, but \r\nwith facts.  He must verify--as far as he can--what he reads in \r\nbooks, by his own observation; and be slow to believe anything, even \r\non the highest scientific authority, till he has either seen it, or \r\nsomething like enough to it to make it seem to him probable, or at \r\nleast possible.  So, and so only, will he become a scientific man, \r\nand a good geologist; and acquire that habit of mind by which alone \r\nhe can judge fairly and wisely of facts of any kind whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI say--facts of any kind whatsoever.  If any of my readers should be \r\ninclined to say to themselves:  Geology may be a very pleasant study, \r\nbut I have no special fancy for it.  I had rather learn something of \r\nbotany, astronomy, chemistry, or what not--I shall answer:  By all \r\nmeans.  Learn any branch of Natural Science you will.  It matters \r\nlittle to me which you learn, provided you learn one at least.  But \r\nbear in mind, and settle it in your hearts, that you will learn no \r\nbranch of science soundly, so as to master it, and be able to make \r\nuse of it, unless you acquire that habit and method of mind which I \r\nam trying to teach you in this book.  I have tried to teach it you by \r\ngeology, because geology is, perhaps, the simplest and the easiest of \r\nall physical sciences.  It appeals more than any to mere common \r\nsense.  It requires fewer difficult experiments, and expensive \r\napparatus.  It requires less previous knowledge of other sciences, \r\nwhether pure or mixed; at least in its rudimentary stages.  It is \r\nmore free from long and puzzling Greek and Latin words.  It is \r\nspecially, the poor man's science.  But if you do not like it, study \r\nsomething else.  Only study that as you must study geology; \r\nproceeding from the known to the unknown by observation and \r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nBut here some of my readers may ask, as they have a perfect right to \r\nask, why I wish young men to learn Natural Science at all?  What good \r\nwill the right understanding of geology, or of astronomy, or of \r\nchemistry, or of the plants or animals which they meet--what good, I \r\nsay, will that do them?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they need, I presume, occupation after their \r\nhours of work.  If any of them answer:  \"We do not want occupation, \r\nwe want amusement.  Work is very dull, and we want something which \r\nwill excite our fancy, imagination, sense of humour.  We want poetry, \r\nfiction, even a good laugh or a game of play\"--I shall most fully \r\nagree with them.  There is often no better medicine for a hard-worked \r\nbody and mind than a good laugh; and the man who can play most \r\nheartily when he has a chance of playing is generally the man who can \r\nwork most heartily when he must work.  But there is certainly nothing \r\nin the study of physical science to interfere with genial hilarity; \r\nthough, indeed, some solemn persons have been wont to reprove the \r\nmembers of the British Association, and specially that Red Lion Club, \r\nwhere all the philosophers are expected to lash their tails and roar, \r\nof being somewhat too fond of mere and sheer fun, after the abstruse \r\npapers of the day are read and discussed.  And as for harmless \r\namusement, and still more for the free exercise of the fancy and the \r\nimagination, I know few studies to compare with Natural History; with \r\nthe search for the most beautiful and curious productions of Nature \r\namid her loveliest scenery, and in her freshest atmosphere.  I have \r\nknown again and again working men who in the midst of smoky cities \r\nhave kept their bodies, their minds, and their hearts healthy and \r\npure by going out into the country at odd hours, and making \r\ncollections of fossils, plants, insects, birds, or some other objects \r\nof natural history; and I doubt not that such will be the case with \r\nsome of my readers.\r\n\r\nAnother argument, and a very strong one, in favour of studying some \r\nbranch of Natural Science just now is this--that without it you can \r\nhardly keep pace with the thought of the world around you.\r\n\r\nOver and above the solid gain of a scientific habit of mind, of which \r\nI shall speak presently, the gain of mere facts, the increased \r\nknowledge of this planet on which we live, is very valuable just now; \r\nvaluable certainly to all who do not wish their children and their \r\nyounger brothers to know more about the universe than they do.\r\n\r\nNatural Science is now occupying a more and more important place in \r\neducation.  Oxford, Cambridge, the London University, the public \r\nschools, one after another, are taking up the subject in earnest; so \r\nare the middle-class schools; so I trust will all primary schools \r\nthroughout the country; and I hope that my children, at least, if not \r\nI myself, will see the day, when ignorance of the primary laws and \r\nfacts of science will be looked on as a defect, only second to \r\nignorance of the primary laws of religion and morality.\r\n\r\nI speak strongly, but deliberately.  It does seem to me strange, to \r\nuse the mildest word, that people whose destiny it is to live, even \r\nfor a few short years, on this planet which we call the earth, and \r\nwho do not at all intend to live on it as hermits, shutting \r\nthemselves up in cells, and looking on death as an escape and a \r\ndeliverance, but intend to live as comfortably and wholesomely as \r\nthey can, they and their children after them--it seems strange, I \r\nsay, that such people should in general be so careless about the \r\nconstitution of this same planet, and of the laws and facts on which \r\ndepend, not merely their comfort and their wealth, but their health \r\nand their very lives, and the health and the lives of their children \r\nand descendants.\r\n\r\nI know some will say, at least to themselves:  \"What need for us to \r\nstudy science?  There are plenty to do that already; and we shall be \r\nsure sooner or later to profit by their discoveries; and meanwhile it \r\nis not science which is needed to make mankind thrive, but simple \r\ncommon sense.\"\r\n\r\nI should reply, that to expect to profit by other men's discoveries \r\nwhen you do not pay for them--to let others labour in the hope of \r\nentering into their labours, is not a very noble or generous state of \r\nmind--comparable somewhat, I should say, to that of the fatting ox, \r\nwho willingly allows the farmer to house him, till for him, feed him, \r\nprovided only he himself may lounge in his stall, and eat, and NOT be \r\nthankful.  There is one difference in the two cases, but only one--\r\nthat while the farmer can repay himself by eating the ox, the \r\nscientific man cannot repay himself by eating you; and so never gets \r\npaid, in most cases, at all.\r\n\r\nBut as for mankind thriving by common sense:  they have not thriven \r\nby common sense, because they have not used their common sense \r\naccording to that regulated method which is called science.  In no \r\nage, in no country, as yet, have the majority of mankind been guided, \r\nI will not say by the love of God, and by the fear of God, but even \r\nby sense and reason.  Not sense and reason, but nonsense and \r\nunreason, prejudice and fancy, greed and haste, have led them to such \r\nresults as were to be expected--to superstitions, persecutions, wars, \r\nfamines, pestilence, hereditary diseases, poverty, waste--waste \r\nincalculable, and now too often irremediable--waste of life, of \r\nlabour, of capital, of raw material, of soil, of manure, of every \r\nbounty which God has bestowed on man, till, as in the eastern \r\nMediterranean, whole countries, some of the finest in the world, seem \r\nruined for ever:  and all because men will not learn nor obey those \r\nphysical laws of the universe, which (whether we be conscious of them \r\nor not) are all around us, like walls of iron and of adamant--say \r\nrather, like some vast machine, ruthless though beneficent, among the \r\nwheels of which if we entangle ourselves in our rash ignorance, they \r\nwill not stop to set us free, but crush us, as they have crushed \r\nwhole nations and whole races ere now, to powder.  Very terrible, \r\nthough very calm, is outraged Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the mills of God grind slowly,\r\n   Yet they grind exceeding small;\r\nThough He sit, and wait with patience,\r\n   With exactness grinds He all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, I believe, one of the most hopeful among the many hopeful \r\nsigns of the times, that the civilised nations of Europe and America \r\nare awakening slowly but surely to this truth.  The civilised world \r\nis learning, thank God, more and more of the importance of physical \r\nscience; year by year, thank God, it is learning to live more and \r\nmore according to those laws of physical science, which are, as the \r\ngreat Lord Bacon said of old, none other than \"Vox Dei in rebus \r\nrevelata\"--the Word of God revealed in facts; and it is gaining by so \r\ndoing, year by year, more and more of health and wealth; of peaceful \r\nand comfortable, even of graceful and elevating, means of life for \r\nfresh millions.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know what the study of physical science has done for \r\nman, look, as a single instance, at the science of Sanatory Reform; \r\nthe science which does not merely try to cure disease, and shut the \r\nstable-door after the horse is stolen, but tries to prevent disease; \r\nand, thank God! is succeeding beyond our highest expectations.  Or \r\nlook at the actual fresh amount of employment, of subsistence, which \r\nscience has, during the last century, given to men; and judge for \r\nyourselves whether the study of it be not one worthy of those who \r\nwish to help themselves, and, in so doing, to help their fellow-men.  \r\nLet me quote to you a passage from an essay urging the institution of \r\nschools of physical science for artisans, which says all I wish to \r\nsay and more:\r\n\r\n\"The discoveries of Voltaic electricity, electromagnetism, and \r\nmagnetic electricity, by Volta, OErsted, and Faraday, led to the \r\ninvention of electric telegraphy by Wheatstone and others, and to the \r\ngreat manufactures of telegraph cables and telegraph wire, and of the \r\nmaterials required for them.  The value of the cargo of the Great \r\nEastern alone in the recent Bombay telegraph expedition was \r\ncalculated at three millions of pounds sterling.  It also led to the \r\nemployment of thousands of operators to transmit the telegraphic \r\nmessages, and to a great increase of our commerce in nearly all its \r\nbranches by the more rapid means of communication.  The discovery of \r\nVoltaic electricity further led to the invention of electro-plating, \r\nand to the employment of a large number of persons in that business.  \r\nThe numerous experimental researches on specific heat, latent heat, \r\nthe tension of vapours, the properties of water, the mechanical \r\neffect of heat, etc., resulted in the development of steam-engines, \r\nand railways, and the almost endless employments depending upon their \r\nconstruction and use.  About a quarter of a million of persons are \r\nemployed on railways alone in Great Britain.  The various original \r\ninvestigations on the chemical effects of light led to the invention \r\nof photography, and have given employment to thousands of persons who \r\npractise that process, or manufacture and prepare the various \r\nmaterial and articles required in it.  The discovery of chlorine by \r\nScheele led to the invention of the modern processes of bleaching, \r\nand to various improvements in the dyeing of the textile fabrics, and \r\nhas given employment to a very large number of our Lancashire \r\noperatives.  The discovery of chlorine has also contributed to the \r\nemployment of thousands of printers, by enabling Esparto grass to be \r\nbleached and formed into paper for the use of our daily press.  The \r\nnumerous experimental investigations in relation to coal-gas have \r\nbeen the means of extending the use of that substance, and of \r\nincreasing the employment of workmen and others connected with its \r\nmanufacture.  The discovery of the alkaline metals by Davy, of \r\ncyanide of potassium, of nickel, phosphorus, the common acids, and a \r\nmultitude of other substances, has led to the employment of a whole \r\narmy of workmen in the conversion of those substances into articles \r\nof utility.  The foregoing examples might be greatly enlarged upon, \r\nand a great many others might be selected from the sciences of \r\nphysics and chemistry:  but those mentioned will suffice.  There is \r\nnot a force of Nature, nor scarcely a material substance that we \r\nemploy, which has not been the subject of several, and in some cases \r\nof numerous, original experimental researches, many of which have \r\nresulted, in a greater or less degree, in increasing the employment \r\nfor workmen and others.\" {1}\r\n\r\n\"All this may be very true.  But of what practical use will physical \r\nscience be to me?\"\r\n\r\nLet me ask in return:  Are none of you going to emigrate?  If you \r\nhave courage and wisdom, emigrate you will, some of you, instead of \r\nstopping here to scramble over each other's backs for the scraps, \r\nlike black-beetles in a kitchen.  And if you emigrate, you will soon \r\nfind out, if you have eyes and common sense, that the vegetable \r\nwealth of the world is no more exhausted than its mineral wealth.  \r\nExhausted?  Not half of it--I believe not a tenth of it--is yet \r\nknown.  Could I show you the wealth which I have seen in a single \r\nTropic island, not sixty miles square--precious timbers, gums, \r\nfruits, what not, enough to give employment and wealth to thousands \r\nand tens of thousands, wasting for want of being known and worked--\r\nthen you would see what a man who emigrates may do, by a little sound \r\nknowledge of botany alone.\r\n\r\nAnd if not.  Suppose that any one of you, learning a little sound \r\nNatural History, should abide here in Britain to your life's end, and \r\nobserve nothing but the hedgerow plants, he would find that there is \r\nmuch more to be seen in those mere hedgerow plants than he fancies \r\nnow.  The microscope will reveal to him in the tissues of any wood, \r\nof any seed, wonders which will first amuse him, then puzzle him, and \r\nat last (I hope) awe him, as he perceives that smallness of size \r\ninterferes in no way with perfection of development, and that \r\n\"Nature,\" as has been well said, \"is greatest in that which is \r\nleast.\"  And more.  Suppose that he went further still.  Suppose that \r\nhe extended his researches somewhat to those minuter vegetable forms, \r\nthe mosses, fungi, lichens; suppose that he went a little further \r\nstill, and tried what the microscope would show him in any stagnant \r\npool, whether fresh water or salt, of Desmidiae, Diatoms, and all \r\nthose wondrous atomies which seem as yet to defy our classification \r\ninto plants or animals.  Suppose he learnt something of this, but \r\nnothing of aught else.  Would he have gained no solid wisdom?  He \r\nwould be a stupider man than I have a right to believe any of my \r\nreaders to be, if he had not gained thereby somewhat of the most \r\nvaluable of treasures--namely, that inductive habit of mind, that \r\npower of judging fairly of facts, without which no good or lasting \r\nwork will be done, whether in physical science, in social science, in \r\npolitics, in philosophy, in philology, or in history.\r\n\r\nBut more:  let me urge you to study Natural Science, on grounds which \r\nmay be to you new and unexpected--on social, I had almost said on \r\npolitical, grounds.\r\n\r\nWe all know, and I trust we all love, the names of Liberty, Equality, \r\nand Brotherhood.  We feel, I trust, that these words are too \r\nbeautiful not to represent true and just ideas; and that therefore \r\nthey will come true, and be fulfilled, somewhen, somewhere, somehow.  \r\nIt may be in a shape very different from that which you, or I, or any \r\nman expects; but still they will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBut if they are to come true, it is we, the individual men, who must \r\nhelp them to come true for the whole world, by practising them \r\nourselves, when and where we can.  And I tell you--that in becoming \r\nscientific men, in studying science and acquiring the scientific \r\nhabit of mind, you will find yourselves enjoying a freedom, an \r\nequality, a brotherhood, such as you will not find elsewhere just \r\nnow.\r\n\r\nFreedom:  what do we want freedom for?  For this, at least; that we \r\nmay be each and all able to think what we choose; and to say what we \r\nchoose also, provided we do not say it rudely or violently, so as to \r\nprovoke a breach of the peace.  That last was Mr. Buckle's definition \r\nof freedom of speech.  That was the only limit to it which he would \r\nallow; and I think that that is Mr. John Stuart Mill's limit also.  \r\nIt is mine.  And I think we have that kind of freedom in these \r\nislands as perfectly as any men are likely to have it on this earth.\r\n\r\nBut what I complain of is, that when men have got the freedom, three \r\nout of four of them will not use it.  What?--someone will answer--Do \r\nyou suppose that I will not say what I choose, and that I dare not \r\nspeak my own mind to any man?  Doubtless.  But are you sure first, \r\nthat you think what you choose, or only what someone else chooses for \r\nyou?  Are you sure that you make up your own mind before you speak, \r\nor let someone else make it up for you?  Your speech may be free \r\nenough, my good friend; and Heaven forbid that it should be anything \r\nelse:  but are your thoughts free likewise?  Are you sure that, \r\nthough you may hate bigotry in others, you are not somewhat of a \r\nbigot yourself?  That you do not look at only one side of a question, \r\nand that the one which pleases you?  That you do not take up your \r\nopinions at second hand, from some book or some newspaper, which \r\nafter all only reflects your own feelings, your own opinions?  You \r\nshould ask yourselves that question, seriously and often:  \"Are my \r\nthoughts really free?\"  No one values more highly than I do the \r\nadvantage of a free press.  But you must remember always that a \r\nnewspaper editor, however honest or able, is no more infallible than \r\nthe Pope; that he may, just as you may, only see one side of a \r\nquestion, while any question is sure to have two sides, or perhaps \r\nthree or four; and if you only see the side which suits you, day \r\nafter day, month after month, you must needs become bigoted to it.  \r\nYour thoughts must needs run in one groove.  They cannot (as Mr. \r\nMatthew Arnold would say) \"play freely round\" a question; and look it \r\nall over, boldly, patiently, rationally, charitably.\r\n\r\nAnd I tell you that if you, or I, or any man, want to let our \r\nthoughts play freely round questions, and so escape from the tendency \r\nto become bigoted and narrow-minded which there is in every human \r\nbeing, then we must acquire something of that inductive habit of mind \r\nwhich the study of Natural Science gives.  It is, after all, as \r\nProfessor Huxley says, only common sense well regulated.  But then it \r\nis well regulated; and how precious it is, if you can but get it.  \r\nThe art of seeing, the art of knowing what you see; the art of \r\ncomparing, of perceiving true likenesses and true differences, and so \r\nof classifying and arranging what you see:  the art of connecting \r\nfacts together in your own mind in chains of cause and effect, and \r\nthat accurately, patiently, calmly, without prejudice, vanity, or \r\ntemper--this is what is wanted for true freedom of mind.  But \r\naccuracy, patience, freedom from prejudice, carelessness for all \r\nexcept the truth, whatever the truth may be--are not these the \r\nvirtues of a truly free spirit?  Then, as I said just now, I know no \r\nstudy so able to give that free habit of mind as the Study of Natural \r\nScience.\r\n\r\nEquality, too:  whatever equality may or may not be just, or \r\npossible; this at least, is just, and I hope possible; that every \r\nman, every child, of every rank, should have an equal chance of \r\neducation; an equal chance of developing all that is in him by \r\nnature; an equal chance of acquiring a fair knowledge of those facts \r\nof the universe which specially concern him; and of having his reason \r\ntrained to judge of them.  I say, whatever equal rights men may or \r\nmay not have, they have this right.  Let every boy, every girl, have \r\nan equal and sound education.  If I had my way, I would give the same \r\neducation to the child of the collier and to the child of a peer.  I \r\nwould see that they were taught the same things, and by the same \r\nmethod.  Let them all begin alike, say I.  They will be handicapped \r\nheavily enough as they go on in life, without our handicapping them \r\nin their first race.  Whatever stable they come out of, whatever \r\npromise they show, let them all train alike, and start fair, and let \r\nthe best colt win.\r\n\r\nWell:  but there is a branch of education in which, even now, the \r\npoor man can compete fairly against the rich; and that is, Natural \r\nScience.  In the first place, the rich, blind to their own interest, \r\nhave neglected it hitherto in their schools; so that they have not \r\nthe start of the poor man on that subject which they have on many.  \r\nIn the next place, Natural Science is a subject which a man cannot \r\nlearn by paying for teachers.  He must teach it himself, by patient \r\nobservation, by patient common sense.  And if the poor man is not the \r\nrich man's equal in those qualities, it must be his own fault, not \r\nhis purse's.  Many shops have I seen about the world, in which fools \r\ncould buy articles more or less helpful to them; but never saw I yet \r\nan observation-shop, nor a common-sense shop either.  And if any man \r\nsays, \"We must buy books:\" I answer, a poor man now can obtain better \r\nscientific books than a duke or a prince could sixty years ago, \r\nsimply because then the books did not exist.  When I was a boy I \r\nwould have given much, or rather my father would have given much, if \r\nI could have got hold of such scientific books as are to be found now \r\nin any first-class elementary school.  And if more expensive books \r\nare needed; if a microscope or apparatus is needed; can you not get \r\nthem by the co-operative method, which has worked so well in other \r\nmatters?  Can you not form yourselves into a Natural Science club, \r\nfor buying such things and lending them round among your members; and \r\nfor discussion also, the reading of scientific papers of your own \r\nwriting, the comparing of your observations, general mutual help and \r\nmutual instructions?  Such societies are becoming numerous now, and \r\ngladly should I see one in every town.  For in science, as in most \r\nmatters, \"As iron sharpeneth iron, so a man sharpeneth the \r\ncountenance of his friend.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Brotherhood:  well, if you want that; if you want to mix with \r\nmen, and men, too, eminently worth mixing with, on the simple ground \r\nthat \"a man's a man for a' that;\" if you want to become the \r\nacquaintances, and--if you prove worthy--the friends, of men who will \r\nbe glad to teach you all they know, and equally glad to learn from \r\nyou anything you can teach them, asking no questions about you, save, \r\nfirst--Is he an honest student of Nature for her own sake?  And next-\r\n-Is he a man who will not quarrel, or otherwise behave in an \r\nunbrotherly fashion to his fellow-students?--If you want a ground of \r\nbrotherhood with men, not merely in these islands, but in America, on \r\nthe Continent--in a word, all over the world--such as rank, wealth, \r\nfashion, or other artificial arrangements of the world cannot give \r\nand cannot take away; if you want to feel yourself as good as any man \r\nin theory, because you are as good as any man in practice, except \r\nthose who are better than you in the same line, which is open to any \r\nand every man; if you wish to have the inspiring and ennobling \r\nfeeling of being a brother in a great freemasonry which owns no \r\ndifference of rank, of creed, or of nationality--the only \r\nfreemasonry, the only International League which is likely to make \r\nmankind (as we all hope they will be some day) one--then become men \r\nof science.  Join the freemasonry in which Hugh Miller, the poor \r\nCromarty stonemason, in which Michael Faraday, the poor bookbinder's \r\nboy, became the companions and friends of the noblest and most \r\nlearned on earth, looked up to by them not as equals merely but as \r\nteachers and guides, because philosophers and discoverers.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to be great?  Then be great with true greatness; which \r\nis,--knowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you \r\nwish to be strong?  Then be strong with true strength; which is, \r\nknowing the facts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish \r\nto be wise?  Then be wise with true wisdom; which is, knowing the \r\nfacts of nature, and being able to use them.  Do you wish to be free?  \r\nThen be free with true freedom; which is again, knowing the facts of \r\nnature, and being able to use them.\r\n\r\nI dare say some of my readers, especially the younger ones, will \r\ndemur to that last speech of mine.  Well, I hope they will not be \r\nangry with me for saying it.  I, at least, shall certainly not he \r\nangry with them.  For when I was young I was very much of what I \r\nsuspect is their opinion.  I used to think one could get perfect \r\nfreedom, and social reform, and all that I wanted, by altering the \r\narrangements of society and legislation; by constitutions, and Acts \r\nof Parliament; by putting society into some sort of freedom-mill, and \r\ngrinding it all down, and regenerating it so.  And that something can \r\nbe done by improved arrangements, something can be done by Acts of \r\nParliament, I hold still, as every rational man must hold.\r\n\r\nBut as I grew older, I began to see that if things were to be got \r\nright, the freedom-mill would do very little towards grinding them \r\nright, however well and amazingly it was made.  I began to see that \r\nwhat sort of flour came out at one end of the mill, depended mainly \r\non what sort of grain you had put in at the other; and I began to see \r\nthat the problem was to get good grain, and then good flour would be \r\nturned out, even by a very clumsy old-fashioned sort of mill.  And \r\nwhat do I mean by good grain?  Good men, honest men, accurate men, \r\nrighteous men, patient men, self-restraining men, fair men, modest \r\nmen.  Men who are aware of their own vast ignorance compared with the \r\nvast amount that there is to be learned in such a universe as this.  \r\nMen who are accustomed to look at both sides of a question; who, \r\ninstead of making up their minds in haste like bigots and fanatics, \r\nwait like wise men, for more facts, and more thought about the facts.  \r\nIn one word, men who had acquired just the habit of mind which the \r\nstudy of Natural Science can give, and must give; for without it \r\nthere is no use studying Natural Science; and the man who has not got \r\nthat habit of mind, if he meddles with science, will merely become a \r\nquack and a charlatan, only fit to get his bread as a spirit-rapper, \r\nor an inventor of infallible pills.\r\n\r\nAnd when I saw that, I said to myself--I will train myself, by \r\nNatural Science, to the truly rational, and therefore truly able and \r\nuseful, habit of mind; and more, I will, for it is my duty as an \r\nEnglishman, train every Englishman over whom I can get influence in \r\nthe same scientific habit of mind, that I may, if possible, make him, \r\ntoo, a rational and an able man.\r\n\r\nAnd, therefore, knowing that most of you, my readers--probably all of \r\nyou, as you ought and must if you are Britons, think much of social \r\nand political questions---therefore, I say, I entreat you to \r\ncultivate the scientific spirit by which alone you can judge justly \r\nof those questions.  I ask you to learn how to \"conquer nature by \r\nobeying her,\" as the great Lord Bacon said two hundred and fifty \r\nyears ago.  For so only will you in your theories and your movements, \r\ndraw \"bills which nature will honour\"--to use Mr. Carlyle's famous \r\nparable--because they are according to her unchanging laws, and not \r\nhave them returned on your hands, as too many theorists' are, with \r\n\"no effects\" written across their backs.\r\n\r\nTake my advice for yourselves, dear readers, and for your children \r\nafter you; for, believe me, I am showing you the way to true and \r\nuseful, and, therefore, to just and deserved power.  I am showing you \r\nthe way to become members of what I trust will be--what I am certain \r\nought to be--the aristocracy of the future.\r\n\r\nI say it deliberately, as a student of society and of history.  Power \r\nwill pass more and more, if all goes healthily and well, into the \r\nhands of scientific men; into the hands of those who have made due \r\nuse of that great heirloom which the philosophers of the seventeenth \r\ncentury left for the use of future generations, and specially of the \r\nTeutonic race.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, events seem but too likely to repeat themselves again \r\nand again all over the world, in the same hopeless circle.  \r\nAristocracies of mere birth decay and die, and give place to \r\naristocracies of mere wealth; and they again to \"aristocracies of \r\ngenius,\" which are really aristocracies of the noisiest, of mere \r\nscribblers and spouters, such as France is writhing under at this \r\nmoment.  And when these last have blown off their steam, with mighty \r\nroar, but without moving the engine a single yard, then they are but \r\ntoo likely to give place to the worst of all aristocracies, the \r\naristocracy of mere \"order,\" which means organised brute force and \r\nmilitary despotism.  And, after that, what can come, save anarchy, \r\nand decay, and social death?\r\n\r\nWhat else?--unless there be left in the nation, in the society, as \r\nthe salt of the land, to keep it all from rotting, a sufficient \r\nnumber of wise men to form a true working aristocracy, an aristocracy \r\nof sound and rational science?  If they be strong enough (and they \r\nare growing stronger day by day over the civilised world), on them \r\nwill the future of that world mainly depend.  They will rule, and \r\nthey will act--cautiously we may hope, and modestly and charitably, \r\nbecause in learning true knowledge they will have learnt also their \r\nown ignorance, and the vastness, the complexity, the mystery of \r\nnature.  But they will be able to rule, they will be able to act, \r\nbecause they have taken the trouble to learn the facts and the laws \r\nof nature.  They will rule; and their rule, if they are true to \r\nthemselves, will be one of health and wealth, and peace, of prudence \r\nand of justice.  For they alone will be able to wield for the benefit \r\nof man the brute forces of nature; because they alone will have \r\nstooped, to \"conquer nature by obeying her.\"\r\n\r\nSo runs my dream.  I ask my young readers to help towards making that \r\ndream a fact, by becoming (as many of them as feel the justice of my \r\nwords) honest and earnest students of Natural Science.\r\n\r\nBut now:  why should I, as a clergyman, interest myself specially in \r\nthe spread of Natural Science?  Am I not going out of my proper \r\nsphere to meddle with secular matters?  Am I not, indeed, going into \r\na sphere out of which I had better keep myself, and all over whom I \r\nmay have influence?  For is not science antagonistic to religion? \r\nand, if so, what has a clergyman to do, save to warn the young \r\nagainst it, instead of attracting them towards it?\r\n\r\nFirst, as to meddling with secular matters.  I grudge that epithet of \r\n\"secular\" to any matter whatsoever.  But I do more; I deny it to \r\nanything which God has made, even to the tiniest of insects, the most \r\ninsignificant atom of dust.  To those who believe in God, and try to \r\nsee all things in God, the most minute natural phenomenon cannot be \r\nsecular.  It must be divine; I say, deliberately, divine; and I can \r\nuse no less lofty word.  The grain of dust is a thought of God; God's \r\npower made it; God's wisdom gave it whatsoever properties or \r\nqualities it may possess; God's providence has put it in the place \r\nwhere it is now, and has ordained that it should be in that place at \r\nthat moment, by a train of causes and effects which reaches back to \r\nthe very creation of the universe.  The grain of dust can no more go \r\nfrom God's presence, or flee from God's Spirit, than you or I can.  \r\nIf it go up to the physical heaven, and float (as it actually often \r\ndoes) far above the clouds, in those higher strata of the atmosphere \r\nwhich the aeronaut has never visited, whither the Alpine snow-peaks \r\ndo not rise, even there it will be obeying physical laws which we \r\nterm hastily laws of Nature, but which are really the laws of God:  \r\nand if it go down into the physical abyss; if it be buried fathoms, \r\nmiles, below the surface, and become an atom of some rock still in \r\nthe process of consolidation, has it escaped from God, even in the \r\nbowels of the earth?  Is it not there still obeying physical laws, of \r\npressure, heat, crystallisation, and so forth, which are laws of God-\r\n-the will and mind of God concerning particles of matter?  Only look \r\nat all created things in this light--look at them as what they are, \r\nthe expressions of God's mind and will concerning this universe in \r\nwhich we live--\"the Word of God,\" as Bacon says, \"revealed in facts\"-\r\n-and then you will not fear physical science; for you will be sure \r\nthat, the more you know of physical science, the more you will know \r\nof the works and of the will of God.  At least, you will be in \r\nharmony with the teaching of the Psalmist:  \"The heavens,\" says he, \r\n\"declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth His handiwork.  \r\nThere is neither speech nor language where their voices are not heard \r\namong them.\"  So held the Psalmist concerning astronomy, the \r\nknowledge of the heavenly bodies; and what he says of sun and stars \r\nis true likewise of the flowers around our feet, of which the \r\ngreatest Christian poet of modern times has said--\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me the meanest flower that grows may give\r\nThoughts that do lie too deep for tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, again, you will be in harmony with the teaching of St. Paul, who \r\ntold the Romans \"that the invisible things of God are clearly seen \r\nfrom the creation of the-world, being understood by the things that \r\nare made, even His eternal power and Godhead;\" and who told the \r\nsavages of Lycaonia that \"God had not left Himself without witness, \r\nin that He did good and sent men rain from heaven, and fruitful \r\nseasons, filling men's hearts with food and gladness.\"  Rain and \r\nfruitful seasons witnessed to all men of a Father in heaven.  And he \r\nwho wishes to know how truly St. Paul spoke, let him study the laws \r\nwhich produce and regulate rain and fruitful seasons, what we now \r\ncall climatology, meteorology, geography of land and water.  Let him \r\nread that truly noble Christian work, Maury's \"Physical Geography of \r\nthe Sea;\" and see, if he be a truly rational man, how advanced \r\nscience, instead of disproving, has only corroborated St. Paul's \r\nassertion, and how the ocean and the rain-cloud, like the sun and \r\nstars, declare the glory of God.  And if anyone undervalues the \r\nsciences which teach us concerning stones and plants and animals, or \r\nthinks that nothing can be learnt from them concerning God--allow one \r\nwho has been from childhood only a humble, though he trusts a \r\ndiligent student of these sciences--allow him, I say, to ask in all \r\nreverence, but in all frankness, who it was who said, \"Consider the \r\nlilies of the field, how they grow.\"  \"Consider the birds of the air-\r\n-and how your Heavenly Father feedeth them.\"\r\n\r\nConsider them.  If He has bid you do so, can you do so too much?\r\n\r\nI know, of course, the special application which our Lord made of \r\nthese words.  But I know, too, from experience, that the more you \r\nstudy nature, in all her forms the more you will find that the \r\nspecial application itself is deeper, wider, more literally true, \r\nmore wonderful, more tender, and if I dare use such a word, more \r\npoetic, than the unscientific man can guess.\r\n\r\nBut let me ask you further--do you think that our Lord in that \r\ninstance, and in those many instances in which He drew his parables \r\nand lessons from natural objects, was leading men's minds on to \r\ndangerous ground, and pointing out to them a subject of contemplation \r\nin the laws and processes of the natural world, and their analogy \r\nwith those of the spiritual world, the kingdom of God--a subject of \r\ncontemplation, I say, which it was not safe to contemplate too much?\r\n\r\nI appeal to your common sense.  If He who spoke these words were (as \r\nI believe) none other than the Creator of the universe, by whom all \r\nthings were made, and without whom nothing was made that is made, do \r\nyou suppose that He would have bid you to consider His universe, had \r\nit been dangerous for you to do so?\r\n\r\nDo you suppose, moreover, that the universe, which He, the Truth, the \r\nLight, the Love, has made, can be otherwise then infinitely worthy to \r\nbe considered? or that the careful, accurate, and patient \r\nconsideration of it, even to its minutest details, can be otherwise \r\nthan useful to man, and can bear witness of aught, save the mind and \r\ncharacter of Him who made it?  And if so, can it be a work unfit for, \r\nunworthy of, a clergyman--whose duty is to preach Him to all, and in \r\nall ways,--to call on men to consider that physical world which, like \r\nthe spiritual world, consists, holds together, by Him, and lives and \r\nmoves and has its being in Him?\r\n\r\nAnd here I must pause to answer an objection which I have heard in my \r\nyouth from many pious and virtuous people--better people in God's \r\nsight, than I, I fear, can pretend to be.\r\n\r\nThey used to say, \"This would be all very true if there were not a \r\ncurse upon the earth.\"  And then they seemed to deduce, from the fact \r\nof that curse, a vague notion (for it was little more) that this \r\nworld was the devil's world, and that therefore physical facts could \r\nnot be trusted, because they were disordered, and deceptive, and what \r\nnot.\r\n\r\nNow, in justice to the Bible, and in justice to the Church of \r\nEngland, I am bound to say that such a statement, or anything like \r\nit, is contrary to the doctrines of both.  It is contrary to \r\nScripture.  According to it, the earth is not cursed.  For it is said \r\nin Gen. viii. 21, \"And the Lord said, I will not again curse the \r\nground any more for man's sake.  While the earth remaineth, seed-time \r\nand harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall \r\nnot cease.\"  According to Scripture, again, physical facts are not \r\ndisordered.  The Psalmist says, \"They continue this day according to \r\ntheir ordinance; for all things serve Thee.\"  And again, \"Thou hast \r\nmade them fast for ever and ever.  Thou hast given them a law which \r\ncannot be broken.\"\r\n\r\nSo does the Bible (not to quote over again the passages which I have \r\nalready given you from St. Paul, and One greater than St. Paul) \r\ndeclare the permanence of natural laws, and the trustworthiness of \r\nnatural phenomena as obedient to God.  And so does the Church of \r\nEngland.  For she has incorporated into her services that magnificent \r\nhymn, which our forefathers called the Song of the Three Children; \r\nwhich is, as it were, the very flower and crown of the Old Testament; \r\nthe summing up of all that is true and eternal in the old Jewish \r\nfaith; as true for us as for them:  as true millions of years hence \r\nas it is now--which cries to all heaven and earth, from the skies \r\nabove our heads to the green herb beneath our feet, \"O all ye works \r\nof the Lord, bless ye the Lord; praise Him and magnify Him for ever.\"  \r\nOn that one hymn I take my stand.  That is my charter as a student of \r\nNatural Science.  As long as that is sung in an English church, I \r\nhave a right to investigate Nature boldly without stint or stay, and \r\nto call on all who have the will, to investigate her boldly likewise, \r\nand with Socrates of old, to follow the Logos whithersoever it leads.\r\n\r\nThe Logos.  I must pause on that word.  It meant at first, no doubt, \r\nsimply speech, argument, reason.  In the mind of Socrates it had a \r\ndeeper meaning, at which he only dimly guessed; which was seen more \r\nclearly by Philo and the Alexandrian Jews; which was revealed in all \r\nits fulness to the beloved Apostle St. John, till he gathered speech \r\nto tell men of a Logos, a Word, who was in the beginning with God, \r\nand was God; by whom all things were made, and without Him was not \r\nanything made that was made; and how in Him was Life, and the Life \r\nwas the light of men; and that He was none other than Jesus Christ \r\nour Lord.\r\n\r\nYes, that is the truth.  And to that truth no man can add, and from \r\nit no man can take away.  And as long as we believe that as long as \r\nwe believe that in His light alone can we see light--as long as we \r\nbelieve that the light around us, whether physical or spiritual, is \r\ngiven by Him without whom nothing is made--so long we shall not fear \r\nto meet Light, so long we shall not fear to investigate Life; for we \r\nshall know, however strange or novel, beautiful or awful, the \r\ndiscoveries we make may be, we are only following the Word \r\nwhithersoever He may lead us; and that He can never lead us amiss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SOIL OF THE FIELD {2}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear readers, let me, before touching on the special subject of \r\nthis paper, say a few words on that of the whole series.\r\n\r\nIt is geology:  that is, the science which explains to us the RIND of \r\nthe earth; of what it is made; how it has been made.  It tells us \r\nnothing of the mass of the earth.  That is, properly speaking, an \r\nastronomical question.  If I may be allowed to liken this earth to a \r\nfruit, then astronomy will tell us--when it knows--how the fruit \r\ngrew, and what is inside the fruit.  Geology can only tell us at most \r\nhow its rind, its outer covering, grew, and of what it is composed; a \r\nvery small part, doubtless, of all that is to be known about this \r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nBut as it happens, the mere rind of this earth-fruit which has, \r\ncountless ages since, dropped, as it were, from the Bosom of God, the \r\nEternal Fount of Life--the mere rind of this earth-fruit, I say, is \r\nso beautiful and so complex, that it is well worth our awful and \r\nreverent study.  It has been well said, indeed, that the history of \r\nit, which we call geology, would be a magnificent epic poem, were \r\nthere only any human interest in it; did it deal with creatures more \r\nlike ourselves than stones, and bones, and the dead relics of plants \r\nand beasts.  Whether there be no human interest in geology; whether \r\nman did not exist on the earth during ages which have seen enormous \r\ngeological changes, is becoming more and more an open question.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile all must agree that there is matter enough for \r\ninterest--nay, room enough for the free use of the imagination, in a \r\nscience which tells of the growth and decay of whole mountain-ranges, \r\ncontinents, oceans, whole tribes and worlds of plants and animals.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is not so much for the vastness and grandeur of those \r\nscenes of the distant past, to which the science of geology \r\nintroduces us, that I value it as a study, and wish earnestly to \r\nawaken you to its beauty and importance.  It is because it is the \r\nscience from which you will learn most easily a sound scientific \r\nhabit of thought.  I say most easily; and for these reasons.  The \r\nmost important facts of geology do not require, to discover them, any \r\nknowledge of mathematics or of chemical analysis; they may be studied \r\nin every bank, every grot, every quarry, every railway-cutting, by \r\nanyone who has eyes and common sense, and who chooses to copy the \r\nlate illustrious Hugh Miller, who made himself a great geologist out \r\nof a poor stonemason.  Next, its most important theories are not, or \r\nneed not be, wrapped up in obscure Latin and Greek terms.  They may \r\nbe expressed in the simplest English, because they are discovered by \r\nsimple common sense.  And thus geology is (or ought to be), in \r\npopular parlance, the people's science--the science by studying \r\nwhich, the man ignorant of Latin, Greek, mathematics, scientific \r\nchemistry, can yet become--as far as his brain enables him--a truly \r\nscientific man.\r\n\r\nBut how shall we learn science by mere common sense?\r\n\r\nFirst.  Always try to explain the unknown by the known.  If you meet \r\nsomething which you have not seen before, then think of the thing \r\nmost like it which you have seen before; and try if that which you \r\nknow explains the one will not explain the other also.  Sometimes it \r\nwill; sometimes it will not.  But if it will, no one has a right to \r\nask you to try any other explanation.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, that you found a dead bird on the top of a \r\ncathedral tower, and were asked how you thought it had got there.  \r\nYou would say, \"Of course, it died up here.\"  But if a friend said, \r\n\"Not so; it dropped from a balloon, or from the clouds;\" and told you \r\nthe prettiest tale of how the bird came to so strange an end, you \r\nwould answer, \"No, no; I must reason from what I know.  I know that \r\nbirds haunt the cathedral tower; I know that birds die; and \r\ntherefore, let your story be as pretty as it may, my common sense \r\nbids me take the simplest explanation, and say--it died here.\"  In \r\nsaying that, you would be talking scientifically.  You would have \r\nmade a fair and sufficient induction (as it is called) from the facts \r\nabout birds' habits and birds' deaths which you know.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that when you took the bird up you found that it was \r\nneither a jackdaw, nor a sparrow nor a swallow, as you expected, but \r\na humming-bird.  Then you would be adrift again.  The fact of it \r\nbeing a humming-bird would be a new fact which you had not taken into \r\naccount, and for which your old explanation was not sufficient; and \r\nyou would have to try a new induction--to use your common sense \r\nafresh--saying, \"I have not to explain merely how a dead bird got \r\nhere, but how a dead humming-bird.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, if your imaginative friend chimed in triumphantly with:  \"Do \r\nyou not see that I was right after all?  Do you not see that it fell \r\nfrom the clouds? that it was swept away hither, all the way from \r\nSouth America, by some south-westerly storm, and wearied out at last, \r\ndropped here to find rest, as in a sacred-place?\" what would you \r\nanswer?  \"My friend, that is a beautiful imagination; but I must \r\ntreat it only as such, as long as I can explain the mystery more \r\nsimply by facts which I do know.  I do not know that humming-birds \r\ncan be blown across the Atlantic alive.  I do know they are actually \r\nbrought across the Atlantic dead; are stuck in ladies' hats.  I know \r\nthat ladies visit the cathedral; and odd as the accident is, I prefer \r\nto believe, till I get a better explanation, that the humming-bird \r\nhas simply dropped out of a lady's hat.\"  There, again, you would be \r\nspeaking common sense; and using, too, sound inductive method; trying \r\nto explain what you do not know from what you do know already.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask of you to employ the same common sense when you read and \r\nthink of Geology.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary to do so.  For in past times men have tried to \r\nexplain the making of the world around them, its oceans, rivers, \r\nmountains, and continents, by I know not what of fancied cataclysms \r\nand convulsions of nature; explaining the unknown by the still more \r\nunknown, till some of their geological theories were no more \r\nrational, because no more founded on known facts, than that of the \r\nNew Zealand Maories, who hold that some god, when fishing, fished up \r\ntheir islands out of the bottom of the ocean.  But a sounder and \r\nwiser school of geologists now reigns; the father of whom, in England \r\nat least, is the venerable Sir Charles Lyell.  He was almost the \r\nfirst of Englishmen who taught us to see--what common sense tells us-\r\n-that the laws which we see at work around us now have been most \r\nprobably at work since the creation of the world; and that whatever \r\nchanges may seem to have taken place in past ages, and in ancient \r\nrocks, should be explained, if possible, by the changes which are \r\ntaking place now in the most recent deposits--in the soil of the \r\nfield.\r\n\r\nAnd in the last forty years--since that great and sound idea has \r\nbecome rooted in the minds of students, and especially of English \r\nstudents, geology has thriven and developed, perhaps more than any \r\nother science; and has led men on to discoveries far more really \r\nastonishing and awful than all fancied convulsions and cataclysms.\r\n\r\nI have planned this series of papers, therefore, on Sir Charles \r\nLyell's method.  I have begun by trying to teach a little about the \r\npart of the earth's crust which lies nearest us, which we see most \r\noften; namely, the soil; intending, if my readers do me the honour to \r\nread the papers which follow, to lead them downward, as it were, into \r\nthe earth; deeper and deeper in each paper, to rocks and minerals \r\nwhich are probably less known to them than the soil in the fields.  \r\nThus you will find I shall lead you, or try to lead you on, \r\nthroughout the series, from the known to the unknown, and show you \r\nhow to explain the latter by the former.  Sir Charles Lyell has, I \r\nsee, in the new edition of his \"Student's Elements of Geology,\" begun \r\nhis book with the uppermost, that is, newest, strata, or layers; and \r\nhas gone regularly downwards in the course of the book to the lowest \r\nor earliest strata; and I shall follow his plan.\r\n\r\nI must ask you meanwhile to remember one law or rule, which seems to \r\nme founded on common sense; namely, that the uppermost strata are \r\nreally almost always the newest; that when two or more layers, \r\nwhether of rock or earth--or indeed two stones in the street, or two \r\nsheets on a bed, or two books on a table--any two or more lifeless \r\nthings, in fact, lie one on the other, then the lower one was most \r\nprobably put there first, and the upper one laid down on the lower.  \r\nDoes that seem to you a truism?  Do I seem almost impertinent in \r\nasking you to remember it?  So much the better.  I shall be saved \r\nunnecessary trouble hereafter.\r\n\r\nBut some one may say, and will have a right to say, \"Stop--the lower \r\nthing may have been thrust under the upper one.\"  Quite true:  and \r\ntherefore I said only that the lower one was most probably put there \r\nfirst.  And I said \"most probably,\" because it is most probable that \r\nin nature we should find things done by the method which costs least \r\nforce, just as you do them.  I will warrant that when you want to \r\nhide a thing, you lay something down on it ten times for once that \r\nyou thrust it under something else.  You may say, \"What?  When I want \r\nto hide a paper, say, under the sofa-cover, do I not thrust it \r\nunder?\"\r\n\r\nNo, you lift up the cover, and slip the paper in, and let the cover \r\nfall on it again.  And so, even in that case, the paper has got into \r\nits place first.\r\n\r\nNow why is this?  Simply because in laying one thing on another you \r\nonly move weight.  In thrusting one thing under another, you have not \r\nonly to move weight, but to overcome friction.  That is why you do \r\nit, though you are hardly aware of it:  simply because so you employ \r\nless force, and take less trouble.\r\n\r\nAnd so do clays and sands and stones.  They are laid down on each \r\nother, and not thrust under each other, because thus less force is \r\nexpended in getting them into place.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions.  There are cases in which nature does try to \r\nthrust one rock under another.  But to do that she requires a force \r\nso enormous, compared with what is employed in laying one rock on \r\nanother, that (so to speak) she continually fails; and instead of \r\nproducing a volcanic eruption, produces only an earthquake.  Of that \r\nI may speak hereafter, and may tell you, in good time, how to \r\ndistinguish rocks which have been thrust in from beneath, from rocks \r\nwhich have been laid down from above, as every rock between London \r\nand Birmingham or Exeter has been laid down.  That I only assert now.  \r\nBut I do not wish you to take it on trust from me.  I wish to prove \r\nit to you as I go on, or to do what is far better for you:  to put \r\nyou in the way of proving it for yourself, by using your common \r\nsense.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of seeming prolix, I must say a few more words on this \r\nmatter.  I have special reasons for it.  Until I can get you to \"let \r\nyour thoughts play freely\" round this question of the superposition \r\nof soils and rocks, there will be no use in my going on with these \r\npapers.\r\n\r\nSuppose then (to argue from the known to the unknown) that you were \r\nwatching men cleaning out a pond.  Atop, perhaps, they would come to \r\na layer of soft mud, and under that to a layer of sand.  Would not \r\ncommon sense tell you that the sand was there first, and that the \r\nwater had laid down the mud on the top of it?  Then, perhaps, they \r\nmight come to a layer of dead leaves.  Would not common sense tell \r\nyou that the leaves were there before the sand above them?  Then, \r\nperhaps, to a layer of mud again.  Would not common sense tell you \r\nthat the mud was there before the leaves?  And so on down to the \r\nbottom of the pond, where, lastly, I think common sense would tell \r\nyou that the bottom of the pond was there already, before all the \r\nlayers which were laid down on it.  Is not that simple common sense?\r\n\r\nThen apply that reasoning to the soils and rocks in any spot on \r\nearth.  If you made a deep boring, and found, as you would in many \r\nparts of this kingdom, that the boring, after passing through the \r\nsoil of the field, entered clays or loose sands, you would say the \r\nclays were there before the soil.  If it then went down into \r\nsandstone, you would say--would you not?--that sandstone must have \r\nbeen here before the clay; and however thick--even thousands of feet-\r\n-it might be, that would make no difference to your judgment.  If \r\nnext the boring came into quite different rocks; into a different \r\nsort of sandstone and shales, and among them beds of coal, would you \r\nnot say--These coal-beds must have been here before the sandstones?  \r\nAnd if you found in those coal-beds dead leaves and stems of plants, \r\nwould you not say--Those plants must have been laid down here before \r\nthe layers above them, just as the dead leaves in the pond were?\r\n\r\nIf you then came to a layer of limestone, would you not say the same?  \r\nAnd if you found that limestone full of shells and corals, dead, but \r\nmany of them quite perfect, some of the corals plainly in the very \r\nplace in which they grew, would you not say--These creatures must \r\nhave lived down here before the coal was laid on top of them?  And \r\nif, lastly, below the limestone you came to a bottom rock quite \r\ndifferent again, would you not say--The bottom rock must have been \r\nhere before the rocks on the top of it?\r\n\r\nAnd if that bottom rock rose up a few miles off, two thousand feet, \r\nor any other height, into hills, what would you say then?  Would you \r\nsay:  \"Oh, but the rock is not bottom rock; is not under the \r\nlimestone here, but higher than it.  So perhaps in this part it has \r\nmade a shift, and the highlands are younger than the lowlands; for \r\nsee, they rise so much higher?\"  Would not that be as wise as to say \r\nthat the bottom of the pond was not there before the pond mud, \r\nbecause the banks round the pond rose higher than the mud?\r\n\r\nNow for the soil of the field.\r\n\r\nIf we can understand a little about it, what it is made of, and how \r\nit got there, we shall perhaps be on the right road toward \r\nunderstanding what all England--and, indeed, the crust of this whole \r\nplanet--is made of; and how its rocks and soils got there.\r\n\r\nBut we shall best understand how the soil in the field was made, by \r\nreasoning, as I have said, from the known to the unknown.  What do I \r\nmean?  This:  On the uplands are fields in which the soil is already \r\nmade.  You do not know how?  Then look for a field in which the soil \r\nis still being made.  There are plenty in every lowland.  Learn how \r\nit is being made there; apply the knowledge which you learn from them \r\nto the upland fields which are already made.\r\n\r\nIf there is, as there usually is, a river-meadow, or still better, an \r\naestuary, near your town, you have every advantage for seeing soil \r\nmade.  Thousands of square feet of fresh-made soil spread between \r\nyour town and the sea; thousands more are in process of being made.\r\n\r\nYou will see now why I have begun with the soil in the field; because \r\nit is the uppermost, and therefore latest, of all the layers; and \r\nalso for this reason, that, if Sir Charles Lyell's theory be true--as \r\nit is--then the soils and rocks below the soil of the field may have \r\nbeen made in the very same way in which the soil of the field is \r\nmade.  If so, it is well worth our while to examine it.\r\n\r\nYou all know from whence the soil comes which has filled up, in the \r\ncourse of ages, the great aestuaries below London, Stirling, Chester, \r\nor Cambridge.\r\n\r\nIt is river mud and sand.  The river, helped by tributary brooks \r\nright and left, has brought down from the inland that enormous mass.  \r\nYou know that.  You know that every flood and freshet brings a fresh \r\nload, either of fine mud or of fine sand, or possibly some of it \r\npeaty matter out of distant hills.  Here is one indisputable fact \r\nfrom which to start.  Let us look for another.\r\n\r\nHow does the mud get into the river?  The rain carries it thither.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to learn the first elements of geology by direct \r\nexperiment, do this:  The next rainy day--the harder it rains the \r\nbetter--instead of sitting at home over the fire, and reading a book \r\nabout geology, put on a macintosh and thick boots, and get away, I \r\ncare not whither, provided you can find there running water.  If you \r\nhave not time to get away to a hilly country, then go to the nearest \r\nbit of turnpike road, or the nearest sloping field, and see in little \r\nhow whole continents are made, and unmade again.  Watch the rain \r\nraking and sifting with its million delicate fingers, separating the \r\nfiner particles from the coarser, dropping the latter as soon as it \r\ncan, and carrying the former downward with it toward the sea.  Follow \r\nthe nearest roadside drain where it runs into a pond, and see how it \r\ndrops the pebbles the moment it enters the pond, and then the sand in \r\na fan-shaped heap at the nearest end; but carries the fine mud on, \r\nand holds it suspended, to be gradually deposited at the bottom in \r\nthe still water; and say to yourself:  Perhaps the sands which cover \r\nso many inland tracts were dropped by water, very near the shore of a \r\nlake or sea, and by rapid currents.  Perhaps, again, the brick clays, \r\nwhich are often mingled with these sands, were dropped, like the mud \r\nin the pond, in deeper water farther from the shore, and certainly in \r\nstilt water.  But more.  Suppose once more, then, that looking and \r\nwatching a pond being cleared out, under the lowest layer of mud, you \r\nfound--as you would find in any of those magnificent reservoirs so \r\ncommon in the Lancashire hills--a layer of vegetable soil, with grass \r\nand brushwood rooted in it.  What would you say but:  The pond has \r\nnot been always full.  It has at some time or other been dry enough \r\nto let a whole copse grow up inside it?\r\n\r\nAnd if you found--as you will actually find along some English \r\nshores--under the sand hills, perhaps a bed of earth with shells and \r\nbones; under that a bed of peat; under that one of blue silt; under \r\nthat a buried forest, with the trees upright and rooted; under that \r\nanother layer of blue silt full of roots and vegetable fibre; perhaps \r\nunder that again another old land surface with trees again growing in \r\nit; and under all the main bottom clay of the district--what would \r\ncommon sense tell you?  I leave you to discover for yourselves.  It \r\ncertainly would not tell you that those trees were thrust in there by \r\na violent convulsion, or that all those layers were deposited there \r\nin a few days, or even a few years; and you might safely indulge in \r\nspeculations about the antiquity of the aestuary, and the changes \r\nwhich it has undergone, with which I will not frighten you at \r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt will be fair reasoning to argue thus.  You may not be always right \r\nin your conclusion, but still you will be trying fairly to explain \r\nthe unknown by the known.\r\n\r\nBut have Rain and Rivers alone made the soil?\r\n\r\nHow very much they have done toward making it you will be able to \r\njudge for yourselves, if you will read the sixth chapter of Sir \r\nCharles Lyell's new \"Elements of Geology,\" or the first hundred pages \r\nof that admirable book, De la Beche's \"Geological Observer;\" and \r\nlast, but not least, a very clever little book called \"Rain and \r\nRivers,\" by Colonel George Greenwood.\r\n\r\nBut though rain, like rivers, is a carrier of soil, it is more.  It \r\nis a maker of soil, likewise; and by it mainly the soil of an upland \r\nfield is made, whether it be carried down to the sea or not.\r\n\r\nIf you will look into any quarry you will see that however compact \r\nthe rock may be a few feet below the surface, it becomes, in almost \r\nevery case, rotten and broken up as it nears the upper soil, till you \r\noften cannot tell where the rock ends and the soil begins.\r\n\r\nNow this change has been produced by rain.  First, mechanically, by \r\nrain in the shape of ice.  The winter rain gets into the ground, and \r\ndoes by the rock what it has done by the stones of many an old \r\nbuilding.  It sinks into the porous stone, freezes there, expands in \r\nfreezing, and splits and peels the stone with a force which is slowly \r\nbut surely crumbling the whole of Northern Europe and America to \r\npowder.\r\n\r\nDo you doubt me?  I say nothing but what you can judge of yourselves.  \r\nThe next time you go up any mountain, look at the loose broken stones \r\nwith which the top is coated, just underneath the turf.  What has \r\nbroken them up but frost?  Look again, as stronger proof, at the \r\ntalus of broken stones--screes, as they call them in Scotland; \r\nrattles, as we call them in Devon--which lie along the base of many \r\nmountain cliffs.  What has brought them down but frost?  If you ask \r\nthe country folk they will tell you whether I am right or not.  If \r\nyou go thither, not in the summer, but just after the winter's frost, \r\nyou will see for yourselves, by the fresh frost-crop of newly-broken \r\nbits, that I am right.  Possibly you may find me to be even more \r\nright than is desirable, by having a few angular stones, from the \r\nsize of your head to that of your body, hurled at you by the frost-\r\ngiants up above.  If you go to the Alps at certain seasons, and hear \r\nthe thunder of the falling rocks, and see their long lines--moraines, \r\nas they are called--sliding slowly down upon the surface of the \r\nglacier, then you will be ready to believe the geologist who tells \r\nyou that frost, and probably frost alone, has hewn out such a peak as \r\nthe Matterhorn from some vast table-land; and is hewing it down \r\nstill, winter after winter, till some day, where the snow Alps now \r\nstand, there shall be rolling uplands of rich cultivable soil.\r\n\r\nSo much for the mechanical action of rain, in the shape of ice.  Now \r\na few words on its chemical action.\r\n\r\nRain water is seldom pure.  It carries in it carbonic acid; and that \r\nacid, beating in shower after shower against the face of a cliff--\r\nespecially if it be a limestone cliff--weathers the rock chemically; \r\nchanging (in case of limestone) the insoluble carbonate of lime into \r\na soluble bicarbonate, and carrying that away in water, which, \r\nhowever clear, is still hard.  Hard water is usually water which has \r\ninvisible lime in it; there are from ten to fifteen grains and more \r\nof lime in every gallon of limestone water.  I leave you to calculate \r\nthe enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea \r\nevery year by a single limestone or chalk brook.  You can calculate \r\nit, if you like, by ascertaining the weight of lime in each gallon, \r\nand the average quantity of water which comes down the stream in a \r\nday; and when your sum is done, you will be astonished to find it one \r\nnot of many pounds, but probably of many tons, of solid lime, which \r\nyou never suspected or missed from the hills around.  Again, by the \r\ntime the rain has sunk through the soil, it is still less pure.  It \r\ncarries with it not only carbonic acid, but acids produced by \r\ndecaying vegetables--by the roots of the grasses and trees which grow \r\nabove; and they dissolve the cement of the rock by chemical action, \r\nespecially if the cement be lime or iron.  You may see this for \r\nyourselves, again and again.  You may see how the root of a tree, \r\npenetrating the earth, discolours the soil with which it is in \r\ncontact.  You may see how the whole rock, just below the soil, has \r\noften changed in colour from the compact rock below, if the soil be \r\ncovered with a dense layer of peat or growing vegetables.\r\n\r\nBut there is another force at work, and quite as powerful as rain and \r\nrivers, making the soil of alluvial flats.  Perhaps it has helped, \r\nlikewise, to make the soil of all the lowlands in these isles--and \r\nthat is, the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nIf you ever go to Parkgate, in Cheshire, try if you cannot learn \r\nthere a little geology.\r\n\r\nWalk beyond the town.  You find the shore protected for a long way by \r\na sea-wall, lest it should be eaten away by the waves.  What the \r\nforce of those waves can be, even on that sheltered coast, you may \r\njudge--at least you could have judged this time last year--by the \r\nmasses of masonry torn from their iron clampings during the gale of \r\nthree winters since.  Look steadily at those rolled blocks, those \r\ntwisted stanchions, if they are there still; and then ask yourselves-\r\n-it will be fair reasoning from the known to the unknown--What effect \r\nmust such wave-power as that have had beating and breaking for \r\nthousands of years along the western coasts of England, Scotland, \r\nIreland?  It must have eaten up thousands of acres--whole shires, may \r\nbe, ere now.  Its teeth are strong enough, and it knows neither rest \r\nnor pity, the cruel hungry sea.  Give it but time enough, and what \r\nwould it not eat up?  It would eat up, in the course of ages, all the \r\ndry land of this planet, were it not baffled by another counteracting \r\nforce, of which I shall speak hereafter.\r\n\r\nAs you go on beyond the sea-wall, you find what it is eating up.  The \r\nwhole low cliff is going visibly.  But whither is it going?  To form \r\nnew soil in the aestuary.  Now you will not wonder how old harbours \r\nso often become silted up.  The sea has washed the land into them.  \r\nBut more, the sea-currents do not allow the sands of the aestuary to \r\nescape freely out to sea.  They pile it up in shifting sand-banks \r\nabout the mouth of the aestuary.  The prevailing sea-winds, from \r\nwhatever quarter, catch up the sand, and roll it up into sand-hills.  \r\nThose sand-hills are again eaten down by the sea, and mixed with the \r\nmud of the tide-flats, and so is formed a mingled soil, partly of \r\nclayey mud, partly of sand; such a soil as stretches over the greater \r\npart of all our lowlands.\r\n\r\nNow, why should not that soil, whether in England or in Scotland, \r\nhave been made by the same means as that of every aestuary.\r\n\r\nYou find over great tracts of East Scotland, Lancashire, Norfolk, \r\netc., pure loose sand just beneath the surface, which looks as if it \r\nwas blown sand from a beach.  Is it not reasonable to suppose that it \r\nis?  You find rising out of many lowlands, crags which look exactly \r\nlike old sea-cliffs eaten by the waves, from the base of which the \r\nwaters have gone back.  Why should not those crags be old sea-cliffs?  \r\nWhy should we not, following our rule of explaining the unknown by \r\nthe known, assume that such they are till someone gives us a sound \r\nproof that they are not; and say--These great plains of England and \r\nScotland were probably once covered by a shallow sea, and their soils \r\nmade as the soil of any tide-flat is being made now?\r\n\r\nBut you may say, and most reasonably \"The tide-flats are just at the \r\nsea-level.  The whole of the lowland is many feet above the sea; it \r\nmust therefore have been raised out of the sea, according to your \r\ntheory:  and what proofs have you of that?\"\r\n\r\nWell, that is a question both grand and deep, on which I shall not \r\nenter yet; but meanwhile, to satisfy you that I wish to play fair \r\nwith you, I ask you to believe nothing but what you can prove for \r\nyourselves.  Let me ask you this:  suppose that you had proof \r\npositive that I had fallen into the river in the morning; would not \r\nyour meeting me in the evening be also proof positive that somehow or \r\nother I had in the course of the day got out of the river?  I think \r\nyou will accept that logic as sound.\r\n\r\nNow if I can give you proof positive, proof which you can see with \r\nyour own eyes, and handle with your own hands, and alas! often feel \r\nbut too keenly with your own feet, that the whole of the lowlands \r\nwere once beneath the sea; then will it not be certain that, somehow \r\nor other, they must have been raised out of the sea again?\r\n\r\nAnd that I propose to do in my next paper, when I speak of the \r\npebbles in the street.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I wish you to face fairly the truly grand idea, which all I \r\nhave said tends to prove true--that all the soil we see is made by \r\nthe destruction of older soils, whether soft as clay, or hard as \r\nrock; that rain, rivers, and seas are perpetually melting and \r\ngrinding up old land, to compose new land out of it; and that it must \r\nhave been doing so, as long as rain, rivers, and seas have existed.  \r\n\"But how did the first land of all get made?\"  I can only reply:  A \r\nnatural question:  but we can only answer that, by working from the \r\nknown to the unknown.  While we are finding out how these later lands \r\nwere made and unmade, we may stumble on some hints as to how the \r\nfirst primeval continents rose out of the bosom of the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I end this paper.  I trust it has not been intolerably dull.  \r\nBut I wanted at starting to show my readers something of the right \r\nway of finding out truth on this and perhaps on all subjects; to make \r\nsome simple appeals to your common sense; and to get you to accept \r\nsome plain rules founded on common sense, which will be of infinite \r\nuse to both you and me in my future papers.\r\n\r\nI hope, meanwhile, that you will agree with me, that there is plenty \r\nof geological matter to be seen and thought over in the neighbourhood \r\nof any town.\r\n\r\nBe sure, that wherever there is a river, even a drain; and a stone \r\nquarry, or even a roadside bank; much more where there is a sea, or a \r\ntidal aestuary, there is geology enough to be learnt, to explain the \r\ngreater part of the making of all the continents on the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  THE PEBBLES IN THE STREET\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you, dear reader, dwell in any northern town, you will almost \r\ncertainly see paving courts and alleys, and sometimes--to the \r\ndiscomfort of your feet--whole streets, or set up as bournestones at \r\ncorners, or laid in heaps to be broken up for road-metal, certain \r\nround pebbles, usually dark brown or speckled gray, and exceedingly \r\ntough and hard.  Some of them will be very large--boulders of several \r\nfeet in diameter.  If you move from town to town, from the north of \r\nScotland as far down as Essex on the east, or as far down as \r\nShrewsbury and Wolverhampton (at least) on the west, you will still \r\nfind these pebbles, but fewer and smaller as you go south.  It \r\nmatters not what the rocks and soils of the country round may be.  \r\nHowever much they may differ, these pebbles will be, on the whole, \r\nthe same everywhere.\r\n\r\nBut if your town be south of the valley of the Thames, you will find, \r\nas far as I am aware, no such pebbles there.  The gravels round you \r\nwill be made up entirely of rolled chalk flints, and bits of beds \r\nimmediately above or below the chalk.  The blocks of \"Sarsden\" \r\nsandstone--those of which Stonehenge is built--and the \"plum-pudding \r\nstones\" which are sometimes found with them, have no kindred with the \r\nnorthern pebbles.  They belong to beds above the chalk.\r\n\r\nNow if, seeing such pebbles about your town, you inquire, like a \r\nsensible person who wishes to understand something of the spot on \r\nwhich he lives, whence they come, you will be shown either a gravel-\r\npit or a clay-pit.  In the gravel the pebbles and boulders lie mixed \r\nwith sand, as they do in the railway cutting just south of \r\nShrewsbury; or in huge mounds of fine sweet earth, as they do in the \r\ngorge of the Tay about Dunkeld, and all the way up Strathmore, where \r\nthey form long grassy mounds--tomauns as they call them in some parts \r\nof Scotland--askers as they call them in Ireland.  These mounds, with \r\ntheir sweet fresh turf rising out of heather and bog, were tenanted--\r\nso Scottish children used to believe--by fairies.  He that was lucky \r\nmight hear inside them fairy music, and, the jingling of the fairy \r\nhorses' trappings.  But woe to him if he fell asleep upon the mound, \r\nfor he would be spirited away into fairyland for seven years, which \r\nwould seem to him but one day.  A strange fancy; yet not so strange \r\nas the actual truth as to what these mounds are, and how they came \r\ninto their places.\r\n\r\nOr again, you might find that your town's pebbles and boulders came \r\nout of a pit of clay, in which they were stuck, without any order or \r\nbedding, like plums and raisins in a pudding.  This clay goes usually \r\nby the name of boulder-clay.  You would see such near any town in \r\nCheshire and Lancashire; or along Leith shore, near Edinburgh; or, to \r\ngive one more instance out of hundreds, along the coast at \r\nScarborough.  If you walk along the shore southward of that town, you \r\nwill see, in the gullies of the cliff, great beds of sticky clay, \r\nstuffed full of bits of every rock between the Lake mountains and \r\nScarborough, from rounded pebbles of most ancient rock down to great \r\nangular fragments of ironstone and coal.  There, as elsewhere, the \r\ngreat majority of the pebbles have nothing to do with the rock on \r\nwhich the clay happens to lie, but have come, some of them, from \r\nplaces many miles away.\r\n\r\nNow if we find spread over a low land pebbles composed of rocks which \r\nare only found in certain high lands, is it not an act of common \r\nsense to say--These pebbles have come from the highlands?  And if the \r\npebbles are rounded, while the rocks like them in the highlands \r\nalways break off in angular shapes, is it not, again, an act of mere \r\ncommon sense to say--These pebbles were once angular, and have been \r\nrubbed round, either in getting hither or before they started hither?\r\n\r\nDoes all this seem to you mere truism, my dear reader?  If so, I am \r\nsincerely glad to hear it.  It was not so very long ago that such \r\narguments would have been considered not only no truisms, but not \r\neven common sense.\r\n\r\nBut to return, let us take, as an example, a sample of these boulder \r\nclay pebbles from the neighbourhood of Liverpool and Birkenhead, made \r\nby Mr. De Rance, the government geological surveyor:\r\n\r\nGranite, greenstone, felspar porphyry, felstone, quartz rock (all \r\nigneous rocks, that is, either formed by, or altered by volcanic \r\nheat, and almost all found in the Lake mountains), 37 per cent.\r\n\r\nSilurian grits (the common stones of the Lake mountains deposited by \r\nwater), 43 per cent.\r\n\r\nIronstone, 1 per cent.\r\n\r\nCarboniferous limestone, 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nPermian or Triassic sandstones, i.e. rocks immediately round \r\nLiverpool, 12 per cent.\r\n\r\nNow, does not this sample show, as far as human common sense can be \r\ndepended on, that the great majority of these stones come from the \r\nLake mountains, sixty or seventy miles north of Liverpool?  I think \r\nyour common sense will tell you that these pebbles are not mere \r\nconcretions; that is, formed out of the substance of the clay after \r\nit was deposited.  The least knowledge of mineralogy would prove \r\nthat.  But, even if you are no mineralogist, common sense will tell \r\nyou, that if they were all concreted out of the same clay, it is most \r\nlikely that they would be all of the same kind, and not of a dozen or \r\nmore different kinds.  Common sense will tell you, also, that if they \r\nwere all concreted out of the same clay, it is a most extraordinary \r\ncoincidence, indeed one too strange to be believed, if any less \r\nstrange explanation can be found--that they should have taken the \r\ncomposition of different rocks which are found all together in one \r\ngroup of mountains to the northward.  You will surely say--If this be \r\ngranite, it has most probably come from a granite mountain; if this \r\nbe grit, from a grit-stone mountain, and so on with the whole list.  \r\nWhy--are we to go out of our way to seek improbable explanations, \r\nwhen there is a probable one staring us in the face?\r\n\r\nNext--and this is well worth your notice--if you will examine the \r\npebbles carefully, especially the larger ones, you will find that \r\nthey are not only more or less rounded, but often scratched; and \r\noften, too, in more than one direction, two or even three sets of \r\nscratches crossing each other; marked, as a cat marks an elder stem \r\nwhen she sharpens her claws upon it; and that these scratches have \r\nnot been made by the quarrymen's tools, but are old marks which \r\nexist--as you may easily prove for yourself--while the stone is still \r\nlying in its bed of clay.  Would it not be an act of mere common \r\nsense to say--These scratches have been made by the sharp points of \r\nother stones which have rubbed against the pebbles somewhere, and \r\nsomewhen, with great force?\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  The next question is--How did these stones get into \r\nthe clay?  If we can discover that, we may also discover how they \r\nwore rounded and scratched.  We must find a theory which will answer \r\nour question; and one which, as Professor Huxley would say, \"will go \r\non all-fours,\" that is, will explain all the facts of the case, and \r\nnot only a few of them.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, brought the stones?\r\n\r\nWe cannot, I think, answer that question, as some have tried to \r\nanswer it, by saying that they were brought by Noah's flood.  For it \r\nis clear, that very violent currents of water would be needed to \r\ncarry boulders, some of them weighing many tons, for many miles.  Now \r\nScripture says nothing of any such violent currents; and we have no \r\nright to put currents, or any other imagined facts, into Scripture \r\nout of our own heads, and then argue from them as if not we, but the \r\ntext of Scripture had asserted their existence.\r\n\r\nBut still, they may have been rolled hither by water.  That theory \r\ncertainly would explain their being rounded; though not their being \r\nscratched.  But it will not explain their being found in the clay.\r\n\r\nRecollect what I said in my first paper:  that water drops its \r\npebbles and coarser particles first, while it carries the fine clayey \r\nmud onward in solution, and only drops it when the water becomes \r\nstill.  Now currents of such tremendous violence as to carry these \r\nboulder stones onward, would have carried the mud for many miles \r\nfarther still; and we should find the boulders, not in clay, but \r\nlying loose together, probably on a hard rock bottom, scoured clean \r\nby the current.  That is what we find in the beds of streams; that is \r\njust what we do not find in this case.\r\n\r\nBut the boulders may have been brought by a current, and then the \r\nwater may have become still, and the clay settled quietly round them.  \r\nWhat?  Under them as well as over them?  On that theory also we \r\nshould find them only at the bottom of the clay.  As it is, we find \r\nthem scattered anywhere and everywhere through it, from top to \r\nbottom.  So that theory will not do.  Indeed, no theory will do which \r\nsupposes them to have been brought by water alone.\r\n\r\nTry yourself, dear reader, and make experiments, with running water, \r\npebbles, and mud.  If you try for seven years, I believe, you will \r\nnever contrive to make your pebbles lie about in your mud, as they \r\nlie about in every pit in the boulder clay.\r\n\r\nWell then, there we are at fault, it seems.  We have no explanation \r\ndrawn from known facts which will do--unless we are to suppose, which \r\nI don't think you will do, that stones, clay, and all were blown \r\nhither along the surface of the ground, by primeval hurricanes, ten \r\ntimes worse than those of the West Indies, which certainly will roll \r\na cannon a few yards, but cannot, surely, roll a boulder stone a \r\nhundred miles.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that there was a force, an agent, known--luckily for \r\nyou, not to you--but known too well to sailors and travellers; a \r\nforce which is at work over the vast sheets of land at both the north \r\nand south poles; at work, too, on every high mountain range in the \r\nworld, and therefore a very common natural force; and suppose that \r\nthis force would explain all the facts, namely--\r\n\r\nHow the stones got here;\r\n\r\nHow they were scratched and rounded;\r\n\r\nHow they were imbedded in clay;\r\n\r\nbecause it is notoriously, and before men's eyes now, carrying great \r\nstones hundreds of miles, and scratching and rounding them also; \r\ncarrying vast deposits of mud, too, and mixing up mud and stones just \r\nas we see them in the brick-pits,--Would not our common sense have a \r\nright to try that explanation?--to suspect that this force, which we \r\ndo not see at work in Britain now, may have been at work here ages \r\nsince?  That would at least be reasoning from the known to the \r\nunknown.  What state of things, then, do we find among the highest \r\nmountains; and over whole countries which, though not lofty, lie far \r\nenough north or south to be permanently covered with ice?\r\n\r\nWe find, first, an ice-cap or ice-sheet, fed by the winter's snows, \r\nstretching over the higher land, and crawling downward and outward by \r\nits own weight, along the valleys, as glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe find underneath the glaciers, first a moraine profonde, consisting \r\nof the boulders and gravel, and earth, which the glacier has ground \r\noff the hillsides, and is carrying down with it.\r\n\r\nThese stones, of course, grind, scratch, and polish each other; and \r\nin like wise grind, scratch, and polish the rock over which they \r\npass, under the enormous weight of the superincumbent ice.\r\n\r\nWe find also, issuing from under each glacier a stream, carrying the \r\nfinest mud, the result of the grinding of the boulders against each \r\nother and the glacier.\r\n\r\nWe find, moreover, on the surface of the glaciers, moraines \r\nsuperieures--long lines of stones and dirt which had fallen from \r\nneighbouring cliffs, and are now travelling downward with the \r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nTheir fate, if the glacier ends on land, is what was to be expected.  \r\nThe stones from above the glacier fall over the ice-cliff at its end, \r\nto mingle with those thrown out from underneath the glacier, and form \r\nhuge banks of boulders, called terminal moraines, while the mud runs \r\noff, as all who have seen glaciers know, in a turbid torrent.\r\n\r\nTheir fate, again, is what was to be expected if the glacier ends, as \r\nit commonly does in Arctic regions, in the sea.  The ice grows out to \r\nsea-ward for more than a mile sometimes, about one-eighth of it being \r\nabove water, and seven-eighths below, so that an ice-cliff one \r\nhundred feet high may project into water eight hundred feet deep.  At \r\nlast, when it gets out of its depth, the buoyancy of the water breaks \r\nit off in icebergs, which float away, at the mercy of tides and \r\ncurrents, often grounding again in shallower water, and ploughing the \r\nsea-bottom as they drag along it.  These bergs carry stones and dirt, \r\noften in large quantities; so that, whenever a berg melts or \r\ncapsizes, it strews its burden confusedly about the sea-floor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fine mud which is flowing out from under the ice goes \r\nout to sea likewise, colouring the water far out, and then subsiding \r\nas a soft tenacious ooze, in which the stones brought out by the ice \r\nare imbedded.  And this ooze--so those who have examined it assert--\r\ncannot be distinguished from the brick-clay, or fossiliferous \r\nboulder-clay, so common in the North.  A very illustrious \r\nScandinavian explorer, visiting Edinburgh, declared, as soon as he \r\nsaw the sections of boulder-clay exhibited near that city, that this \r\nwas the very substance which he saw forming in the Spitzbergen ice-\r\nfiords. {3}\r\n\r\nI have put these facts as simply and baldly as I can, in order that \r\nthe reader may look steadily at them, without having his attention \r\ndrawn off, or his fancy excited, by their real poetry and grandeur.  \r\nIndeed, it would have been an impertinence to have done otherwise; \r\nfor I have never seen a live glacier, by land or sea, though I have \r\nseen many a dead one.  And the public has had the opportunity, \r\nlately, of reading so many delightful books about \"peaks, passes, and \r\nglaciers,\" that I am bound to suppose that many of my readers know as \r\nmuch, or more, about them than I do.\r\n\r\nBut let us go a step farther; and, bearing in our minds what live \r\nglaciers are like, let us imagine what a dead glacier would be like; \r\na glacier, that is, which had melted, and left nothing but its \r\nskeleton of stones and dirt.\r\n\r\nWe should find the faces of the rock scored and polished, generally \r\nin lines pointing down the valleys, or at least outward from the \r\ncentre of the highlands, and polished and scored most in their upland \r\nor weather sides.  We should find blocks of rock left behind, and \r\nperched about on other rocks of a different kind.  We should find in \r\nthe valleys the old moraines left as vast deposits of boulder and \r\nshingle, which would be in time sawn through and sorted over by the \r\nrivers.  And if the sea-bottom outside were upheaved, and became dry \r\nland, we should find on it the remains of the mud from under the \r\nglacier, stuck full of stones and boulders iceberg-dropped.  This mud \r\nwould be often very irregularly bedded; for it would have been \r\ndisturbed by the ploughing of the icebergs, and mixed here and there \r\nwith dirt which had fallen from them.  Moreover, as the sea became \r\nshallower and the mud-beds got awash one after the other, they would \r\nbe torn about, re-sifted, and re-shaped by currents and by tides, and \r\nmixed with shore-sand ground out of shingle-beach, thus making \r\nconfusion worse confounded.  A few shells, of an Arctic or northern \r\ntype, would be found in it here and there.  Some would have lived \r\nnear those later beaches, some in deeper water in the ancient ooze, \r\nwherever the iceberg had left it in peace long enough for sea-animals \r\nto colonise and breed in it.  But the general appearance of the dried \r\nsea-bottom would be a dreary and lifeless waste of sands, gravels, \r\nloose boulders, and boulder-bearing clays; and wherever a boss of \r\nbare rock still stood up, it would be found ground down, and probably \r\npolished and scored by the ponderous icebergs which had lumbered over \r\nit in their passage out to sea.\r\n\r\nIn a word, it would look exactly as vast tracts of the English, \r\nScotch, and Irish lowlands must have looked before returning \r\nvegetation coated their dreary sands and clays with a layer of brown \r\nvegetable soil.\r\n\r\nThus, and I believe thus only, can we explain the facts connected \r\nwith these boulder pebbles.  No agent known on earth can have stuck \r\nthem in the clay, save ice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNo known agent can have scratched them as they are scratched, save \r\nice, which is known to do so still elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNo known agent--certainly not, in my opinion, the existing rivers--\r\ncan have accumulated the vast beds of boulders which lie along the \r\ncourse of certain northern rivers; notably along the Dee about \r\nAboyne--save ice bearing them slowly down from the distant summits of \r\nthe Grampians.\r\n\r\nNo known agent, save ice, can have produced those rounded, and \r\npolished, and scored, and fluted rochers moutonnes \"sheep-backed \r\nrocks\"--so common in the Lake district; so common, too, in Snowdon, \r\nespecially between the two lakes of Llanberis; common in Kerry; to be \r\nseen anywhere, as far as I have ascertained, around the Scotch \r\nHighlands, where the turf is cleared away from an unweathered surface \r\nof the rock, in the direction in which a glacier would have pressed \r\nagainst it had one been there.  Where these polishings and scorings \r\nare found in narrow glens, it is, no doubt, an open question whether \r\nsome of them may not be the work of water.  But nothing but the \r\naction of ice can have produced what I have seen in land-locked and \r\nquiet fords in Kerry--ice-flutings in polished rocks below high-water \r\nmark, so large that I could lie down in one of them.  Nothing but the \r\naction of ice could produce what may be seen in any of our mountains-\r\n-whole sheets of rock ground down into rounded flats, irrespective of \r\nthe lie of the beds, not in valleys, but on the brows and summits of \r\nmountains, often ending abruptly at the edge of some sudden cliff, \r\nwhere the true work of water, in the shape of rain and frost, is \r\nactually destroying the previous work of ice, and fulfilling the rule \r\nlaid down (I think by Professor Geikie in his delightful book on \r\nScotch scenery as influenced by its geology), that ice planes down \r\ninto flats, while water saws out into crags and gullies; and that the \r\nrain and frost are even now restoring Scotch scenery to something of \r\nthat ruggedness and picturesqueness which it must have lost when it \r\nlay, like Greenland, under the indiscriminating grinding of a heavy \r\nsheet of ice.\r\n\r\nLastly; no known agent, save ice, will explain those perched \r\nboulders, composed of ancient hard rocks, which may be seen in so \r\nmany parts of these islands and of the Continent.  No water power \r\ncould have lifted those stones, and tossed them up high and dry on \r\nmountain ridges and promontories, upon rocks of a totally different \r\nkind.  Some of my readers surely recollect Wordsworth's noble lines \r\nabout these mysterious wanderers, of which he had seen many a one \r\nabout his native hills:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie\r\nCouched on the bald top of an eminence,\r\nWonder to all who do the same espy\r\nBy what means it could thither come, and whence;\r\nSo that it seems a thing endued with sense:\r\nLike a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf\r\nOf rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes; but the next time you see such a stone, believe that the wonder \r\nhas been solved, and found to be, like most wonders in Nature, more \r\nwonderful than we guessed it to be.  It is not a sea-beast which has \r\ncrawled forth, but an ice-beast which has been left behind; lifted up \r\nthither by the ice, as surely as the famous Pierre-a-bot, forty feet \r\nin diameter, and hundreds of boulders more, almost as large as \r\ncottages, have been carried by ice from the distant Alps right across \r\nthe lake of Neufchatel, and stranded on the slopes of the Jura, nine \r\nhundred feet above the lake. {4}\r\n\r\nThus, I think, we have accounted for facts enough to make it probable \r\nthat Britain was once covered partly by an ice-sheet, as Greenland is \r\nnow, and partly, perhaps, by an icy sea.  But, to make assurance more \r\nsure, let us look for new facts, and try whether our ice-dream will \r\naccount for them also.  Let us investigate our case as a good medical \r\nman does, by \"verifying his first induction.\"\r\n\r\nHe says:  At the first glance, I can see symptoms a, b, c.  It is \r\ntherefore probable that my patient has got complaint A.  But if he \r\nhas he ought to have symptom d also.  If I find that, my guess will \r\nbe yet more probable.  He ought also to have symptom e, and so forth; \r\nand as I find successively each of these symptoms which are proper to \r\nA, my first guess will become more and more probable, till it reaches \r\npractical certainty.\r\n\r\nNow let us do the same, and say--If this strange dream be true, and \r\nthe lowlands of the North were once under an icy sea, ought we not to \r\nfind sea-shells in their sands and clays?  Not abundantly, of course.  \r\nWe can understand that the sea-animals would be too rapidly covered \r\nup in mud, and too much disturbed by icebergs and boulders, to be \r\nvery abundant.  But still, some should surely be found here and \r\nthere.\r\n\r\nDoubtless; and if my northern-town readers will search the boulder-\r\nclay pits near them, they will most probably find a few shells, if \r\nnot in the clay itself, yet in sand-beds mixed with them, and \r\nprobably underlying them.  And this is a notable fact, that the more \r\nspecies of shells they find, the more they will find--if they work \r\nout their names from any good book of conchology--of a northern type; \r\nof shells which notoriously, at this day, inhabit the colder seas.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me here to enter at length on a subject on which \r\na whole literature has been already written.  Those who wish to study \r\nit may find all that they need know, and more, in Lyell's \"Student's \r\nElements of Geology,\" and in chapter xii. of his \"Antiquity of Man.\"  \r\nThey will find that if the evidence of scientific conchologists be \r\nworth anything, the period can be pointed out in the strata, though \r\nnot of course in time, at which these seas began to grow colder, and \r\nsouthern and Mediterranean shells to disappear, their places being \r\ntaken by shells of a temperate, and at last of an Arctic climate; \r\nwhich last have since retreated either toward their native North, or \r\ninto cold water at great depths.  From Essex across to Wales, from \r\nWales to the aestuary of the Clyde, this fact has been verified again \r\nand again.  And in the search for these shells, a fresh fact, and a \r\nmost startling one, was discovered.  They are to be found not only in \r\nthe clay of the lowlands, but at considerable heights up the hills, \r\nshowing that, at some time or other, these hills have been submerged \r\nbeneath the sea.\r\n\r\nLet me give one example, which any tourist into Wales may see for \r\nhimself.  Moel Tryfaen is a mountain over Carnarvon.  Now perched on \r\nthe side of that mountain, fourteen hundred feet above the present \r\nsea-level, is an ancient sea-beach, five-and-thirty feet thick, lying \r\non great ice-scratched boulders, which again lie on the mountain \r\nslates.  It was discovered by the late Mr. Trimmer, now, alas! lost \r\nto Geology.  Out of that beach fifty-seven different species of \r\nshells have been taken; eleven of them are now exclusively Arctic, \r\nand not found in our seas; four of them are still common to the \r\nArctic seas and to our own; and almost all the rest are northern \r\nshells.\r\n\r\nFourteen hundred feet above the present sea:  and that, it must be \r\nunderstood, is not the greatest height at which such shells may be \r\nfound hereafter.  For, according to Professor Ramsay, drift of the \r\nsame kind as that on Moel Tryfaen is found at a height of two \r\nthousand three hundred feet.\r\n\r\nNow I ask my readers to use their common sense over this astounding \r\nfact--which, after all, is only one among hundreds; to let (as Mr. \r\nMatthew Arnold would well say) their \"thought play freely\" about it; \r\nand consider for themselves what those shells must mean.  I say not \r\nmay, but must, unless we are to believe in a \"Deus quidam deceptor,\" \r\nin a God who puts shells upon mountain-sides only to befool honest \r\nhuman beings, and gives men intellects which are worthless for even \r\nthe simplest work.  Those shells must mean that that mountain, and \r\ntherefore the mountains round it, must have been once fourteen \r\nhundred feet at least lower than they are now.  That the sea in which \r\nthey were sunk was far colder than now.  That icebergs brought and \r\ndropped boulders round their flanks.  That upon those boulders a sea-\r\nbeach formed, and that dead shells were beaten into it from a sea-\r\nbottom close by.  That, and no less, Moel Tryfaen must mean.\r\n\r\nBut it must mean, also, a length of time which has been well called \r\n\"appalling.\"  A length of time sufficient to let the mountain sink \r\ninto the sea.  Then length of time enough to enable those Arctic \r\nshells to crawl down from the northward, settle, and propagate \r\nthemselves generation after generation; then length of time enough to \r\nuplift their dead remains, and the beach, and the boulders, and all \r\nSnowdonia, fourteen hundred feet into the air.  And if anyone should \r\nobject that the last upheaval may have been effected suddenly by a \r\nfew tremendous earthquakes, we must answer--We have no proof of it.  \r\nEarthquakes upheave lands now only by slight and intermittent upward \r\npulses; nay, some lands we know to rise without any earthquake \r\npulses, but by simple, slow, upward swelling of a few feet in a \r\ncentury; and we have no reason, and therefore no right, to suppose \r\nthat Snowdonia was upheaved by any means or at any rate which we do \r\nnot witness now; and therefore we are bound to allow, not only that \r\nthere was a past \"age of ice,\" but that that age was one of \r\naltogether enormous duration.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile some of you, I presume, will be ready to cry--Stop!  It \r\nmay be our own weakness; but you are really going on too fast and too \r\nfar for our small imaginations.  Have you not played with us, as well \r\nas argued with us, till you have inveigled us step by step into a \r\nconclusion which we cannot and will not believe?  That all this land \r\nshould have been sunk beneath an icy sea?  That Britain should have \r\nbeen as Greenland is now?  We can't believe it, and we won't.\r\n\r\nIf you say so, like stout common-sense Britons, who have a wholesome \r\ndread of being taken in with fine words and wild speculations, I \r\nassure you I shall not laugh at you even in private.  On the \r\ncontrary, I shall say--what I am sure every scientific man will say--\r\nSo much the better.  That is the sort of audience which we want, if \r\nwe are teaching natural science.  We do not want haste, enthusiasm, \r\ngobe-moucherie, as the French call it, which is agape to snap up any \r\nnew and vast fancy, just because it is new and vast.  We want our \r\nreaders to be slow, suspicious, conservative, ready to \"gib,\" as we \r\nsay of a horse, and refuse the collar up a steep place, saying--I \r\nmust stop and think.  I don't like the look of the path ahead of me.  \r\nIt seems an ugly place to get up.  I don't know this road, and I \r\nshall not hurry over it.  I must go back a few steps, and make sure.  \r\nI must see whether it is the right road; whether there are not other \r\nroads, a dozen of them perhaps, which would do as well and better \r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nThis is the temper which finds out truth, slowly, but once and for \r\nall; and I shall be glad, not sorry, to see it in my readers.\r\n\r\nAnd I am bound to say that it has been by that temper that this \r\ntheory has been worked out, and the existence of this past age of \r\nice, or glacial epoch, has been discovered, through many mistakes, \r\nmany corrections, and many changes of opinion about details, for \r\nnearly forty years of hard work, by many men, in many lands.\r\n\r\nAs a very humble student of this subject, I may say that I have been \r\nlooking these facts in the face earnestly enough for more than twenty \r\nyears, and that I am about as certain that they can only be explained \r\nby ice, as I am that my having got home by rail can only be explained \r\nby steam.\r\n\r\nBut I think I know what startles you.  It is the being asked to \r\nbelieve in such an enormous change in climate, and in the height of \r\nthe land above the sea.  Well--it is very astonishing, appalling--all \r\nbut incredible, if we had not the facts to prove it.  But of the \r\nfacts there can be no doubt.  There can be no doubt that the climate \r\nof this northern hemisphere has changed enormously more than once.  \r\nThere can be no doubt that the distribution of land and water, the \r\nshape and size of its continents and seas, have changed again and \r\nagain.  There can be no doubt that, for instance, long before the age \r\nof ice, the whole North of Europe was much warmer than it is now.\r\n\r\nTake Greenland, for instance.  Disco Island lies in Baffin's Bay, off \r\nthe west coast of Greenland, in latitude 70 degrees, far within the \r\nArctic circle.  Now there certain strata of rock, older than the ice, \r\nhave not been destroyed by the grinding of the ice-cap; and they are \r\nfull of fossil plants.  But of what kind of plants?  Of the same \r\nfamilies as now grow in the warmer parts of the United States.  Even \r\na tulip-tree has been found among them.  Now how is this to be \r\nexplained?\r\n\r\nEither we must say that the climate of Greenland was then so much \r\nwarmer than now, that it had summers probably as hot as those of New \r\nYork; or we must say that these leaves and stems were floated thither \r\nfrom the United States.  But if we say the latter, we must allow a \r\nchange in the shape of the land which is enormous.  For nothing now \r\ncan float northward from the United States into Baffin's Bay.  The \r\npolar current sets OUT of Baffin's Bay southward, bringing icebergs \r\ndown, not leaves up, through Davis's Straits.  And in any case we \r\nmust allow that the hills of Disco Island were then the bottom of a \r\nsea:  or how would the leaves have been deposited in them at all?\r\n\r\nSo much for the change of climate and land which can be proved to \r\nhave gone on in Greenland.  It has become colder.  Why should it not \r\nsome day become warmer again?\r\n\r\nNow for England.  It can be proved, as far as common sense can prove \r\nanything, that England was, before the age of ice, much warmer than \r\nit is now, and grew gradually cooler and cooler, just as, while the \r\nage of ice was dying out, it grew warmer again.\r\n\r\nNow what proof is there of that?\r\n\r\nThis.  Underneath London--as, I dare say, many of you know--there \r\nlies four or five hundred feet of clay.  But not ice-clay.  Anything \r\nbut that, as you will see.  It belongs to a formation late \r\n(geologically speaking), but somewhat older than those Disco Island \r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nAnd what sort of fossils do we find in it?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the shells, which are abundant, are tropical--\r\nNautili, Cones, and such like.  And more, fruits and seeds are found \r\nin it, especially at the Isle of Sheppey.  And what are they?  Fruits \r\nof Nipa palms, a form only found now at river-mouths in Eastern India \r\nand the Indian islands; Anona-seeds; gourd-seeds; Acacia fruits--all \r\ntropical again; and Proteaceous plants too--of an Australian type.  \r\nSurely your common sense would hint to you, that this London clay \r\nmust be mud laid down off the mouth of a tropical river.  But your \r\ncommon sense would be all but certain of that, when you found, as you \r\nwould find, the teeth and bones of crocodiles and turtles, who come \r\nto land, remember, to lay their eggs; the bones, too, of large \r\nmammals, allied to the tapir of India and South America, and the \r\nwater-hog of the Cape.  If all this does not mean that there was once \r\na tropic climate and a tropic river running into some sea or other \r\nwhere London now stands, I must give up common sense and reason as \r\ndeceitful and useless faculties; and believe nothing, not even the \r\nevidence of my own senses.\r\n\r\nAnd now, have I, or have I not, fulfilled the promise which I made--\r\nrashly, I dare say some of you thought--in my first paper?  Have I, \r\nor have I not, made you prove to yourself, by your own common sense, \r\nthat the lowlands of Britain were underneath the sea in the days in \r\nwhich these pebbles and boulders were laid down over your plains?  \r\nNay, have we not proved more?  Have we not found that that old sea \r\nwas an icy sea?  Have we not wandered on, step by step, into a whole \r\ntrue fairyland of wonders? to a time when all England, Scotland, and \r\nIreland were as Greenland is now? when mud streams have rushed down \r\nfrom under glaciers on to a cold sea-bottom, when \"ice, mast high, \r\ncame floating by, as green as emerald?\" when Snowdon was sunk for at \r\nleast fourteen hundred feet of its height? when (as I could prove to \r\nyou, had I time) the peaks of the highest Cumberland and Scotch \r\nmountains alone stood out, as islets in a frozen sea?\r\n\r\nWe want to get an answer to one strange question, and we have found a \r\ngroup of questions stranger still, and got them answered too.  But so \r\nit is always in science.  We know not what we shall discover.  But \r\nthis, at least, we know, that it will be far more wonderful than we \r\nhad dreamed.  The scientific explorer is always like Saul of old, who \r\nset out simply to find his father's asses, and found them--and a \r\nkingdom besides.\r\n\r\nI should have liked to have told you more about this bygone age of \r\nice.  I should have liked to say something to you on the curious \r\nquestion--which is still an open one--whether there were not two ages \r\nof ice; whether the climate here did not, after perhaps thousands of \r\nyears of Arctic cold, soften somewhat for a while--a few thousand \r\nyears, perhaps--and then harden again into a second age of ice, \r\nsomewhat less severe, probably, than the first.  I should have liked \r\nto have hinted at the probable causes of this change--indeed, of the \r\nage of ice altogether--whether it was caused by a change in the \r\ndistribution of land and water, or by change in the height and size \r\nof these islands, which made them large enough, and high enough, to \r\ncarry a sheet of eternal snow inland; or whether, finally, the age of \r\nice was caused by an actual change in the position of the whole \r\nplanet with regard to its orbit round the sun--shifting at once the \r\npoles and the tropics; a deep question that latter, on which \r\nastronomers, whose business it is, are still at work, and on which, \r\nere young folk are old, they will have discovered, I expect, some \r\nstartling facts.  On that last question, I, being no astronomer, \r\ncannot speak.  But I should have liked to have said somewhat on \r\nmatters on which I have knowledge enough, at least, to teach you how \r\nmuch there is to be learnt.  I should have liked to tell the student \r\nof sea-animals--how the ice-age helps to explain, and is again \r\nexplained by, the remarkable discoveries which Dr. Carpenter and Mr. \r\nWyville Thompson have just made, in the deep-sea dredgings in the \r\nNorth Atlantic.  I should have liked to tell the botanist somewhat of \r\nthe pro-glacial flora--the plants which lived here before the ice, \r\nand lasted, some of them at least, through all those ages of fearful \r\ncold, and linger still on the summits of Snowdon, and the highest \r\npeaks of Cumberland and Scotland.  I should have liked to have told \r\nthe lovers of zoology about the animals which lived before the ice--\r\nof the mammoth, or woolly elephant; the woolly rhinoceros, the cave \r\nlion and bear, the reindeer, the musk oxen, the lemmings and the \r\nmarmots which inhabited Britain till the ice drove them out \r\nsouthward, even into the South of France; and how as the ice \r\nretreated, and the climate became tolerable once more, some of them--\r\nthe mammoth and rhinoceros, the bison, the lion, and many another \r\nmighty beast reoccupied our lowlands, at a time when the \r\nhippopotamus, at least in summer, ranged freely from Africa and Spain \r\nacross what was then dry land between France and England, and fed by \r\nthe side of animals which have long since retreated to Norway and to \r\nCanada.  I should have liked to tell the archaeologist of the human \r\nbeings--probably from their weapons and their habits--of the same \r\nrace as the present Laplanders, who passed northward as the ice went \r\nback, following the wild reindeer herds from the South of France into \r\nour islands, which were no islands then, to be in their turn driven \r\nnorthward by stronger races from the east and south.  But space \r\npresses, and I fear that I have written too much already.\r\n\r\nAt least, I have turned over for you a few grand and strange pages in \r\nthe book of nature, and taught you, I hope, a key by which to \r\ndecipher their hieroglyphics.  At least, I have, I trust, taught you \r\nto look, as I do, with something of interest, even of awe, upon the \r\npebbles in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  THE STONES IN THE WALL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a large subject.  For in the different towns of these \r\nislands, the walls are built of stones of almost every age, from the \r\nearliest to the latest; and the town-geologist may find a quite \r\ndifferent problem to solve in the nearest wall, on moving from one \r\ntown to another twenty miles off.  All I can do, therefore, is to \r\ntake one set of towns, in the walls of which one sort of stones is \r\ncommonly found, and talk of them; taking care, of course, to choose a \r\nstone which is widely distributed.  And such, I think, we can find in \r\nthe so-called New Red sandstone, which, with its attendant marls, \r\ncovers a vast tract--and that a rich and busy one--of England.  From \r\nHartlepool and the mouth of the Tees, down through Yorkshire and \r\nNottinghamshire; over the manufacturing districts of central England; \r\ndown the valley of the Severn; past Bristol and the Somersetshire \r\nflats to Torquay in South Devon; up north-westward through Shropshire \r\nand Cheshire; past Liverpool and northward through Lancashire; \r\nreappearing again, north of the Lake mountains, about Carlisle and \r\nthe Scotch side of the Solway Frith, stretches the New Red sandstone \r\nplain, from under which everywhere the coal-bearing rocks rise as \r\nfrom a sea.  It contains, in many places, excellent quarries of \r\nbuilding-stone; the most famous of which, perhaps, are the well-known \r\nRuncorn quarries, near Liverpool, from which the old Romans brought \r\nthe material for the walls and temples of ancient Chester, and from \r\nwhich the stone for the restoration of Chester Cathedral is being \r\ntaken at this day.  In some quarters, especially in the north-west of \r\nEngland, its soil is poor, because it is masked by that very boulder-\r\nclay of which I spoke in my last paper.  But its rich red marls, \r\nwherever they come to the surface, are one of God's most precious \r\ngifts to this favoured land.  On them, one finds oneself at once in a \r\ngarden; amid the noblest of timber, wheat, roots, grass which is \r\ngreen through the driest summers, and, in the western counties, \r\ncider-orchards laden with red and golden fruit.  I know, throughout \r\nnorthern Europe, no such charming scenery, for quiet beauty and solid \r\nwealth, as that of the New Red marls; and if I wished to show a \r\nforeigner what England was, I should take him along them, from \r\nYorkshire to South Devon, and say--There.  Is not that a country \r\nworth living for,--and worth dying for if need be?\r\n\r\nAnother reason which I have for dealing with the New Red sandstone is \r\nthis--that (as I said just now) over great tracts of England, \r\nespecially about the manufacturing districts, the town-geologist will \r\nfind it covered immediately by the boulder clay.\r\n\r\nThe townsman, finding this, would have a fair right to suppose that \r\nthe clay was laid down immediately, or at least soon after, the \r\nsandstones or marls on which it lies; that as soon as the one had \r\nsettled at the bottom of some old sea, the other settled on the top \r\nof it, in the same sea.\r\n\r\nA fair and reasonable guess, which would in many cases, indeed in \r\nmost, be quite true.  But in this case it would be a mistake.  The \r\nsandstone and marls are immensely older than the boulder-clay.  They \r\nare, humanly speaking, some four or five worlds older.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean?  This--that between the time when the one, and the \r\ntime when the other, was made, the British Islands, and probably the \r\nwhole continent of Europe, have changed four or five times; in shape; \r\nin height above the sea, or depth below it; in climate; in the kinds \r\nof plants and animals which have dwelt on them, or on their sea-\r\nbottoms.  And surely it is not too strong a metaphor, to call such \r\nchanges a change from an old world to a new one.\r\n\r\nMind.  I do not say that these changes were sudden or violent.  It is \r\nfar more probable that they are only part and parcel of that vast but \r\nslow change which is going on everywhere over our whole globe.  I \r\nthink that will appear probable in the course of this paper.  But \r\nthat these changes have taken place, is my main thesis.  The fact I \r\nassert; and I am bound to try and prove it.  And in trying to do so, \r\nI shall no longer treat my readers, as I did in the first two papers, \r\nlike children.  I shall take for granted that they now understand \r\nsomething of the method by which geological problems are worked out; \r\nand can trust it, and me; and shall state boldly the conclusions of \r\ngeologists, only giving proof where proof is specially needed.\r\n\r\nNow you must understand that in England there are two great divisions \r\nof these New Red sandstones, \"Trias,\" as geologists call them.  An \r\nupper, called in Germany Keuper, which consists, atop, of the rich \r\nred marl, below them, of sandstones, and of those vast deposits of \r\nrock-salt, which have been long worked, and worked to such good \r\npurpose, that a vast subsidence of land has just taken place near \r\nNantwich in Cheshire; and serious fears are entertained lest the town \r\nitself may subside, to fill up the caverns below, from whence the \r\nsalt has been quarried.  Underneath these beds again are those which \r\ncarry the building-stone of Runcorn.  Now these beds altogether, in \r\nCheshire, at least, are about 3,400 feet thick; and were not laid \r\ndown in a year, or in a century either.\r\n\r\nBelow them lies a thousand feet of sandstones, known in Germany by \r\nthe name of \"Bunter,\" from its mottled and spotted appearance.  What \r\nlies under them again, does not concern us just now.\r\n\r\nI said that the geologists called these beds the Trias; that is, the \r\ntriple group.  But as yet we have heard of only two parts of it.  \r\nWhere is the third?\r\n\r\nNot here, but in Germany.  There, between the Keuper above and the \r\nBunter below, lies a great series of limestone beds, which, from the \r\nabundance of fossils which they contain, go by the name of \r\nMuschelkalk.  A long epoch must therefore have intervened between the \r\nlaying down of the Bunter and of the Keuper.  And we have a trace of \r\nthat long epoch, even in England.  The Keuper lies, certainly, \r\nimmediately on the Bunter; but not always \"conformably\" on it.  That \r\nis, the beds are not exactly parallel.  The Bunter had been slightly \r\ntilted, and slightly waterworn, before the Keuper was laid on it.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to suppose, that the Bunter in England \r\nwas dry land, and therefore safe from fresh deposit, through ages \r\nduring which it was deep enough beneath the sea in Germany, to have \r\nthe Muschelkalk laid down on it.  Here again, then, as everywhere, we \r\nhave evidence of time--time, not only beyond all counting, but beyond \r\nall imagining.\r\n\r\nAnd now, perhaps, the reader will ask--If I am to believe that all \r\nnew land is made out of old land, and that all rocks and soils are \r\nderived from the wear and tear of still older rocks, off what land \r\ncame this enormous heap of sands more than 5,000 feet thick in \r\nplaces, stretching across England and into Germany?\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to answer.  The shape and distribution of land in \r\nthose days were so different from what they are now, that the rocks \r\nwhich furnished a great deal of our sandstone may be now, for aught I \r\nknow, a mile beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nBut over the land which still stands out of the sea near us there has \r\nbeen wear and tear enough to account for any quantity of sand \r\ndeposit.  As a single instance--It is a provable and proven fact--as \r\nyou may see from Mr. Ramsay's survey of North Wales--that over a \r\nlarge tract to the south of Snowdon, between Port Madoc and Barmouth, \r\nthere has been ground off and carried away a mass of solid rock \r\n20,000 feet thick; thick enough, in fact, if it were there still, to \r\nmake a range of mountains as high as the Andes.  It is a provable and \r\nproven fact that vast tracts of the centre of poor old Ireland were \r\nonce covered with coal-measures, which have been scraped off in \r\nlikewise, deprived of inestimable mineral wealth.  The destruction of \r\nrocks--\"denudation\" as it is called--in the district round Malvern, \r\nis, I am told, provably enormous.  Indeed, it is so over all Wales, \r\nNorth England, and West and North Scotland.  So there is enough of \r\nrubbish to be accounted for to make our New Red sands.  The round \r\npebbles in it being, I believe, pieces of Old Red sandstone, may have \r\ncome from the great Old Red sandstone region of South East Wales and \r\nHerefordshire.  Some of the rubbish, too, may have come from what is \r\nnow the Isle of Anglesey.\r\n\r\nFor you find in the beds, from the top to the bottom (at least in \r\nCheshire), particles of mica.  Now this mica could not have been \r\nformed in the sand.  It is a definite crystalline mineral, whose \r\ncomposition is well known.  It is only found in rocks which have been \r\nsubjected to immense pressure, and probably to heat.  The granites \r\nand mica-slates of Anglesey are full of it; and from Anglesey--as \r\nlikely as from anywhere else--these thin scales of mica came.  And \r\nthat is about all that I can say on the matter.  But it is certain \r\nthat most of these sands were deposited in a very shallow water, and \r\nvery near to land.  Sand and pebbles, as I said in my first paper, \r\ncould not be carried far out to sea; and some of the beds of the \r\nBunter are full of rounded pebbles.  Nay, it is certain that their \r\nsurface was often out of water.  Of that you may see very pretty \r\nproofs.  You find these sands ripple-marked, as you do shore-sands \r\nnow.  You find cracks where the marl mud has dried in the sun:  and, \r\nmore, you find the little pits made by rain.  Of that I have no \r\ndoubt.  I have seen specimens, in which you could not only see at a \r\nglance that the marks had been made by the large drops of a shower, \r\nbut see also from what direction the shower had come.  These delicate \r\nmarkings must have been covered up immediately with a fresh layer of \r\nmud or sand.  How long since?  How long since that flag had seen the \r\nlight of the sun, when it saw it once again, restored to the upper \r\nair by the pick of the quarryman?  Who can answer that?  Not I.\r\n\r\nFossils are very rare in these sands; it is not easy to say why.  It \r\nmay be that the red oxide of iron in them has destroyed them.  Few or \r\nnone are ever found in beds in which it abounds.  It is curious, too, \r\nthat the Keuper, which is all but barren of fossils in England, is \r\nfull of them in Wurtemberg, reptiles, fish, and remains of plants \r\nbeing common.  But what will interest the reader are the footprints \r\nof a strange beast, found alike in England and in Germany--the \r\nCheirotherium, as it was first named, from its hand-like feet; the \r\nLabyrinthodon, as it is now named, from the extraordinary structure \r\nof its teeth.  There is little doubt now, among anatomists, that the \r\nbones and teeth of the so-called Labyrinthodon belong to the animal \r\nwhich made the footprints.  If so, the creature must have been a \r\nright loathly monster.  Some think him to have been akin to lizards; \r\nbut the usual opinion is that he was a cousin of frogs and toads.  \r\nLooking at his hands and other remains, one pictures him to oneself \r\nas a short, squat brute, as big as a fat hog, with a head very much \r\nthe shape of a baboon, very large hands behind and small ones in \r\nfront, waddling about on the tide flats of a sandy sea, and dragging \r\nafter him, seemingly, a short tail, which has left its mark on the \r\nsand.  What his odour was, whether he was smooth or warty, what he \r\nate, and in general how he got his living, we know not.  But there \r\nmust have been something there for him to eat; and I dare say that he \r\nwas about as happy and about as intellectual as the toad is now.  \r\nRemember always that there is nothing alive now exactly like him, or, \r\nindeed, like any animal found in these sandstones.  The whole animal \r\nworld of this planet has changed entirely more than once since the \r\nLabyrinthodon waddled over the Cheshire flats.  A lizard, for \r\ninstance, which has been found in the Keuper, had a skull like a \r\nbird's, and no teeth--a type which is now quite extinct.  But there \r\nis a more remarkable animal of which I must say a few words, and one \r\nwhich to scientific men is most interesting and significant.\r\n\r\nBoth near Warwick, and near Elgin in Scotland, in Central India, and \r\nin South Africa, fossil remains are found of a family of lizards \r\nutterly unlike anything now living save one, and that one is crawling \r\nabout, plentifully I believe--of all places in the world--in New \r\nZealand.  How it got there; how so strange a type of creature should \r\nhave died out over the rest of the world, and yet have lasted on in \r\nthat remote island for long ages, ever since the days of the New Red \r\nsandstone, is one of those questions--quite awful questions I \r\nconsider them--with which I will not puzzle my readers.  I only \r\nmention it to show them what serious questions the scientific man has \r\nto face, and to answer, if he can.  Only the next time they go to the \r\nZoological Gardens in London, let them go to the reptile-house, and \r\nask the very clever and courteous attendant to show them the \r\nSphenodons, or Hatterias, as he will probably call them--and then \r\nlook, I hope with kindly interest, at the oldest Conservatives they \r\never saw, or are like to see; gentlemen of most ancient pedigree, who \r\nhave remained all but unchanged, while the whole surface of the globe \r\nhas changed around them more than once or twice.\r\n\r\nAnd now, of course, my readers will expect to hear something of the \r\ndeposits of rock-salt, for which Cheshire and its red rocks are \r\nfamous.  I have never seen them, and can only say that the salt does \r\nnot, it is said by geologists, lie in the sandstone, but at the \r\nbottom of the red marl which caps the sandstone.  It was formed most \r\nprobably by the gradual drying up of lagoons, such as are depositing \r\nsalt, it is said now, both in the Gulf of Tadjara, on the Abyssinian \r\nfrontier opposite Aden, and in the Runn of Cutch, near the Delta of \r\nthe Indus.  If this be so, then these New Red sandstones may be the \r\nremains of a whole Sahara--a sheet of sandy and all but lifeless \r\ndeserts, reaching from the west of England into Germany, and rising \r\nslowly out of the sea; to sink, as we shall find, beneath the sea \r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as to the vast period of time--the four or five worlds, as I \r\ncalled it--which elapsed between the laying down of the New Red \r\nsandstones and the laying down of the boulder-clays.\r\n\r\nI think this fact--for fact it is--may be better proved by taking \r\nreaders an imaginary railway journey to London from any spot in the \r\nmanufacturing districts of central England--begging them, meanwhile, \r\nto keep their eyes open on the way.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must say that I wish folks in general would keep their \r\neyes a little more open when they travel by rail.  When I see young \r\npeople rolling along in a luxurious carriage, their eyes and their \r\nbrains absorbed probably in a trashy shilling novel, and never lifted \r\nup to look out of the window, unconscious of all that they are \r\npassing--of the reverend antiquities, the admirable agriculture, the \r\nrich and peaceful scenery, the like of which no country upon earth \r\ncan show; unconscious, too, of how much they might learn of botany \r\nand zoology, by simply watching the flowers along the railway banks \r\nand the sections in the cuttings:  then it grieves me to see what \r\nlittle use people make of the eyes and of the understanding which God \r\nhas given them.  They complain of a dull journey:  but it is not the \r\njourney which is dull; it is they who are dull.  Eyes have they, and \r\nsee not; ears have they, and hear not; mere dolls in smart clothes, \r\ntoo many of them, like the idols of the heathen.\r\n\r\nBut my readers, I trust, are of a better mind.  So the next time they \r\nfind themselves running up southward to London--or the reverse way--\r\nlet them keep their eyes open, and verify, with the help of a \r\ngeological map, the sketch which is given in the following pages.\r\n\r\nOf the \"Black Countries\"--the actual coal districts I shall speak \r\nhereafter.  They are in England either shores or islands yet \r\nundestroyed, which stand out of the great sea of New Red sandstone, \r\nand often carry along their edges layers of far younger rocks, called \r\nnow Permian, from the ancient kingdom of Permia, in Russia, where \r\nthey cover a vast area.  With them I will not confuse the reader just \r\nnow, but will only ask him to keep his eye on the rolling plain of \r\nNew Red sands and marls past, say, Birmingham and Warwick.  After \r\nthose places, these sands and marls dip to the south-east, and other \r\nrocks and soils appear above them, one after another, dipping \r\nlikewise towards the south-east--that is, toward London.\r\n\r\nFirst appear thin layers of a very hard blue limestone, full of \r\nshells, and parted by layers of blue mud.  That rock runs in a broad \r\nbelt across England, from Whitby in Yorkshire, to Lyme in \r\nDorsetshire, and is known as Lias.  Famous it is, as some readers may \r\nknow, for holding the bones of extinct monsters--Ichthyosaurs and \r\nPlesiosaurs, such as the unlearned may behold in the lake at the \r\nCrystal Palace.  On this rock lie the rich cheese pastures, and the \r\nbest tracts of the famous \"hunting shires\" of England.\r\n\r\nLying on it, as we go south-eastward, appear alternate beds of sandy \r\nlimestone, with vast depths of clay between them.  These \"oolites,\" \r\nor freestones, furnish the famous Bath stone, the Oxford stone, and \r\nthe Barnack stone of Northamptonshire, of which some of the finest \r\ncathedrals are built--a stone only surpassed, I believe, by the Caen \r\nstone, which comes from beds of the same age in Normandy.  These \r\nfreestones and clays abound in fossils, but of kinds, be it \r\nremembered, which differ more and more from those of the lias \r\nbeneath, as the beds are higher in the series, and therefore nearer.  \r\nThere, too, are found principally the bones of that extraordinary \r\nflying lizard, the Pterodactyle, which had wings formed out of its \r\nfore-legs, on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat, but with one \r\nexception.  In the bat, as any one may see, four fingers of the hand \r\nare lengthened to carry the wing, while the first alone is left free, \r\nas a thumb:  but in the Pterodactyle, the outer or \"little\" finger \r\nalone is lengthened, and the other four fingers left free--one of \r\nthose strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced \r\nin widely different plants and animals, and yet by slightly different \r\nmeans, on which a whole chapter of natural philosophy--say, rather, \r\nnatural theology--will have to be written some day.\r\n\r\nBut now consider what this Lias, and the Oolites and clays upon it \r\nmean.  They mean that the New Red sandstone, after it had been dry \r\nland, or all but dry land (as is proved by the footprints of animals \r\nand the deposits of salt), was sunk again beneath the sea.  Each \r\ndeposit of limestone signifies a long period of time, during which \r\nthat sea was pure enough to allow reefs of coral to grow, and shells \r\nto propagate, at the bottom.  Each great band of clay signifies a \r\nlong period, during which fine mud was brought down from some wasting \r\nland in the neighbourhood.  And that land was not far distant is \r\nproved by the bones of the Pterodactyle, of Crocodiles, and of \r\nMarsupials; by the fact that the shells are of shallow-water or shore \r\nspecies; by the presence, mixed with them, of fragments of wood, \r\nimpressions of plants, and even wing-shells of beetles; and lastly, \r\nif further proof was needed, by the fact that in the \"dirt-bed\" of \r\nthe Isle of Portland and the neighbouring shores, stumps of trees \r\nallied to the modern sago-palms are found as they grew in the soil, \r\nwhich, with them, has been covered up in layers of freshwater shale \r\nand limestone.  A tropic forest has plainly sunk beneath a lagoon; \r\nand that lagoon, again, beneath the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd how long did this period of slow sinking go on?  Who can tell?  \r\nThe thickness of the Lias and Oolites together cannot be less than a \r\nthousand feet.  Considering, then, the length of time required to lay \r\ndown a thousand feet of strata, and considering the vast difference \r\nbetween the animals found in them, and the few found in the New Red \r\nsandstone, we have a right to call them another world, and that one \r\nwhich must have lasted for ages.\r\n\r\nAfter we pass Oxford, or the Vale of Aylesbury, we enter yet another \r\nworld.  We come to a bed of sand, under which the freestones and \r\ntheir adjoining clays dip to the south-east.  This is called commonly \r\nthe lower Greensand, though it is not green, but rich iron-red.  Then \r\nsucceeds a band of stiff blue clay, called the Gault, and then \r\nanother bed of sand, the upper Greensand, which is more worthy of the \r\nname, for it does carry, in most places, a band of green or \r\n\"glauconite\" sand.  But it and the upper layers of the lower \r\nGreensand also, are worth our attention; for we are all probably \r\neating them from time to time in the form of bran.\r\n\r\nIt had been long remarked that certain parts of these beds carried \r\nadmirable wheatland; it had been remarked, too, that the finest hop-\r\nlands--those of Farnham, for instance, and Tunbridge--lay upon them:  \r\nbut that the fertile band was very narrow; that, as in the Surrey \r\nMoors, vast sheets of the lower Greensand were not worth cultivation.  \r\nWhat caused the striking difference?\r\n\r\nMy beloved friend and teacher, the late Dr. Henslow, when Professor \r\nof Botany at Cambridge, had brought to him by a farmer (so the story \r\nran) a few fossils.  He saw, being somewhat of a geologist and \r\nchemist, that they were not, as fossils usually are, carbonate of \r\nlime, but phosphate of lime--bone-earth.  He said at once, as by an \r\ninspiration, \"You have found a treasure--not a gold-mine, indeed, but \r\na food-mine.  This is bone-earth, which we are at our wits' end to \r\nget for our grain and pulse; which we are importing, as expensive \r\nbones, all the way from Buenos Ayres.  Only find enough of them, and \r\nyou will increase immensely the food supply of England, and perhaps \r\nmake her independent of foreign phosphates in case of war.\"\r\n\r\nHis advice was acted on; for the British farmer is by no means the \r\nstupid personage which townsfolk are too apt to fancy him.  This bed \r\nof phosphates was found everywhere in the Greensand, underlying the \r\nChalk.  It may be traced from Dorsetshire through England to \r\nCambridge, and thence, I believe, into Yorkshire.  It may be traced \r\nagain, I believe, all round the Weald of Kent and Sussex, from Hythe \r\nto Farnham--where it is peculiarly rich--and so to Eastbourne and \r\nBeachey Head; and it furnishes, in Cambridgeshire, the greater part \r\nof those so-called \"coprolites,\" which are used perpetually now for \r\nmanure, being ground up, and then treated with sulphuric acid, till \r\nthey become a \"soluble super-phosphate of lime.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the useless \"hobby,\" as some fancy it, of poking over old \r\nbones and stones, and learning a little of the composition of this \r\nearth on which God has placed us.\r\n\r\nHow to explain the presence of this vast mass of animal matter, in \r\none or two thin bands right across England, I know not.  That the \r\nfossils have been rolled on a sea-beach is plain to those who look at \r\nthem.  But what caused so vast a destruction of animal life along \r\nthat beach, must remain one of the buried secrets of the past.\r\n\r\nAnd now we are fast nearing another world, which is far younger than \r\nthat coprolite bed, and has been formed under circumstances the most \r\nopposite to it.  We are nearing, by whatever rail we approach London, \r\nthe escarpment of the chalk downs.\r\n\r\nAll readers, surely, know the white chalk, the special feature and \r\nthe special pride of the south of England.  All know its softly-\r\nrounded downs, its vast beech woods, its short and sweet turf, its \r\nsnowy cliffs, which have given--so some say--to the whole island the \r\nname of Albion--the white land.  But all do not, perhaps, know that \r\ntill we get to the chalk no single plant or animal has been found \r\nwhich is exactly like any plant or animal now known to be living.  \r\nThe plants and animals grow, on the whole, more and more like our \r\nliving forms as we rise in the series of beds.  But only above the \r\nchalk (as far as we yet know) do we begin to find species identical \r\nwith those living now.\r\n\r\nThis in itself would prove a vast lapse of time.  We shall have a \r\nfurther proof of that vast lapse when we examine the chalk itself.  \r\nIt is composed--of this there is now no doubt--almost entirely of the \r\nshells of minute animalcules; and animalcules (I use an unscientific \r\nword for the sake of unscientific readers) like these, and in some \r\ncases identical with them, are now forming a similar deposit of mud, \r\nat vast depths, over the greater part of the Atlantic sea-floor.  \r\nThis fact has been put out of doubt by recent deep-sea dredgings.  A \r\nwhole literature has been written on it of late.  Any reader who \r\nwishes to know it, need only ask the first geologist he meets; and if \r\nhe has the wholesome instinct of wonder in him, fill his imagination \r\nwith true wonders, more grand and strange than he is like to find in \r\nany fairy tale.  All I have to do with the matter here is, to say \r\nthat, arguing from the known to the unknown, from the Atlantic deep-\r\nsea ooze which we do know about, to the chalk which we do not know \r\nabout, the whole of the chalk must have been laid down at the bottom \r\nof a deep and still ocean, far out of the reach of winds, tides, and \r\neven currents, as a great part of the Atlantic sea-floor is at this \r\nday.\r\n\r\nProdigious! says the reader.  And so it is.  Prodigious to think that \r\nthat shallow Greensand shore, strewed with dead animals, should sink \r\nto the bottom of an ocean, perhaps a mile, perhaps some four miles \r\ndeep.  Prodigious the time during which it must have lain as a still \r\nocean-floor.  For so minute are the living atomies which form the \r\nooze, that an inch, I should say, is as much as we can allow for \r\ntheir yearly deposit; and the chalk is at least a thousand feet \r\nthick.  It may have taken, therefore, twelve thousand years to form \r\nthe chalk alone.  A rough guess, of course, but one as likely to be \r\ntwo or three times too little as two or three times too big.  Such, \r\nor somewhat such, is the fact.  It had long been suspected, and more \r\nthan suspected; and the late discoveries of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. \r\nWyville Thompson have surely placed it beyond doubt.\r\n\r\nThus, surely, if we call the Oolitic beds one new world above the New \r\nRed sandstone, we must call the chalk a second new world in like \r\nwise.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble the reader here with the reasons why geologists \r\nconnect the chalk with the greensands below it, by regular \r\ngradations, in spite of the enormous downward leap, from sea-shore to \r\ndeep ocean, which the beds seem (but only seem) to have taken.  The \r\nchange--like all changes in geology--was probably gradual.  Not by \r\nspasmodic leaps and starts, but slowly and stately, as befits a God \r\nof order, of patience, and of strength, have these great deeds been \r\ndone.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done with new worlds or new prodigies on our way \r\nto London, as any Londoner may ascertain for himself, if he will run \r\nout a few miles by rail, and look in any cutting or pit, where the \r\nsurface of the chalk, and the beds which lie on it, are exposed.\r\n\r\nOn the chalk lie--especially in the Blackheath and Woolwich district-\r\n-sands and clays.  And what do they tell us?\r\n\r\nOf another new world, in which the chalk has been lifted up again, to \r\nform gradually, doubtless, and at different points in succession, the \r\nshore of a sea.\r\n\r\nBut what proof is there of this?\r\n\r\nThe surface of the chalk is not flat and smooth, as it must have been \r\nwhen at the bottom of the sea.  It is eaten out into holes and \r\nfurrows, plainly by the gnawing of the waves; and on it lie, in many \r\nplaces, large rolled flints out of chalk which has been destroyed, \r\nbeds of shore-shingle, beds of oysters lying as they grew, fresh or \r\nbrackish water-shells standing as they lived, bits of lignite (fossil \r\nwood half turned to coal), and (as in Katesgrove pits at Reading) \r\nleaves of trees.  Proof enough, one would say, that the chalk had \r\nbeen raised till part of it at least became dry land, and carried \r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we have not done.  There is another world to tell of yet.\r\n\r\nFor these beds (known as the Woolwich and Reading beds) dip under \r\nthat vast bed of London clay, four hundred and more feet thick, which \r\n(as I said in my last chapter) was certainly laid down by the estuary \r\nof some great tropic river, among palm-trees and Anonas, crocodiles \r\nand turtles.\r\n\r\nIs the reader's power of belief exhausted?\r\n\r\nIf not:  there are to be seen, capping almost every high land round \r\nLondon, the remains of a fifth world.  Some of my readers may have \r\nbeen to Ascot races, or to Aldershot camp, and may recollect the \r\ntable-land of the sandy moors, perfectly flat atop, dreary enough to \r\nthose to whom they are not (as they have long been to me) a home and \r\na work-field.  Those sands are several hundred feet thick.  They lie \r\non the London clay.  And they represent--the reader must take \r\ngeologists' word for it--a series of beds in some places thousands of \r\nfeet thick, in the Isle of Wight, in the Paris basin, in the volcanic \r\ncountry of the Auvergne, in Switzerland, in Italy; a period during \r\nwhich the land must at first have swarmed with forms of tropic life, \r\nand then grown--but very gradually--more temperate, and then colder \r\nand colder still; till at last set in that age of ice, which spread \r\nthe boulder pebbles over all rocks and soils indiscriminately, from \r\nthe Lake mountains to within a few miles of London.\r\n\r\nFor everywhere about those Ascot moors, the top of the sands has been \r\nploughed by shore-ice in winter, as they lay a-wash in the shallow \r\nsea; and over them, in many places, is spread a thin sheet of ice \r\ngravel, more ancient, the best geologists think, than the boulder and \r\nthe boulder-clay.\r\n\r\nIf any of my readers ask how long the period was during which those \r\nsands of Ascot Heath and Aldershot have been laid down, I cannot \r\ntell.  But this we can tell.  It was long enough to see such changes \r\nin land and sea, that maps representing Europe during the greater \r\npart of that period (as far as we can guess at it) look no more like \r\nEurope than like America or the South Sea Islands.  And this we can \r\ntell besides:  that that period was long enough for the Swiss Alps to \r\nbe lifted up at least 10,000 feet of their present height.  And that \r\nwas a work which--though God could, if He willed it, have done it in \r\na single day--we have proof positive was not done in less than ages, \r\nbeside which the mortal life of man is as the life of the gnat which \r\ndances in the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, and more--as may be proved from the geology of foreign \r\ncountries--happened between the date of the boulder-clay, and that of \r\nthe New Red sandstone on which it rests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  THE COAL IN THE FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear town-dwelling readers, let me tell you now something of a \r\ngeological product well known, happily, to all dwellers in towns, and \r\nof late years, thanks to railroad extension, to most dwellers in \r\ncountry districts:  I mean coal.\r\n\r\nCoal, as of course you know, is commonly said to be composed of \r\nvegetable matter, of the leaves and stems of ancient plants and \r\ntrees--a startling statement, and one which I do not wish you to take \r\nentirely on trust.  I shall therefore spend a few pages in showing \r\nyou how this fact--for fact it is--was discovered.  It is a very good \r\nexample of reasoning from the known to the unknown.  You will have a \r\nright to say at first starting, \"Coal is utterly different in look \r\nfrom leaves and stems.  The only property which they seem to have in \r\ncommon is that they can both burn.\"  True.  But difference of mere \r\nlook may be only owing to a transformation, or series of \r\ntransformations.  There are plenty in nature quite as great, and \r\ngreater.  What can be more different in look, for instance, than a \r\ngreen field of wheat and a basket of loaves at the baker's?  And yet \r\nthere is, I trust, no doubt whatsoever that the bread has been once \r\ngreen wheat, and that the green wheat has been transformed into \r\nbread--making due allowance, of course, for the bone-dust, or gypsum, \r\nor alum with which the worthy baker may have found it profitable to \r\nadulterate his bread, in order to improve the digestion of Her \r\nMajesty's subjects.\r\n\r\nBut you may say, \"Yes, but we can see the wheat growing, flowering, \r\nripening, reaped, ground, kneaded, baked.  We see, in the case of \r\nbread, the processes of the transformation going on:  but in the case \r\nof coal we do not see the wood and leaves being actually transformed \r\ninto coal, or anything like it.\"\r\n\r\nNow suppose we laid out the wheat on a table in a regular series, \r\nsuch as you may see in many exhibitions of manufactures; beginning \r\nwith the wheat plant at one end, and ending with the loaf at the \r\nother; and called in to look at them a savage who knew nothing of \r\nagriculture and nothing of cookery--called in, as an extreme case, \r\nthe man in the moon, who certainly can know nothing of either; for as \r\nthere is neither air nor water round the moon, there can be nothing \r\nto grow there, and therefore nothing to cook--and suppose we asked \r\nhim to study the series from end to end.  Do you not think that the \r\nman in the moon, if he were half as shrewd as Crofton Croker makes \r\nhim in his conversation with Daniel O'Rourke, would answer after due \r\nmeditation, \"How the wheat plant got changed into the loaf I cannot \r\nsee from my experience in the moon:  but that it has been changed, \r\nand that the two are the same thing I do see, for I see all the \r\ndifferent stages of the change.\"  And so I think you may say of the \r\nwood and the coal.\r\n\r\nThe man in the moon would be quite reasonable in his conclusion; for \r\nit is a law, a rule, and one which you will have to apply again and \r\nagain in the study of natural objects, that however different two \r\nobjects may look in some respects, yet if you can find a regular \r\nseries of gradations between them, with all shades of likeness, first \r\nto one of them and then to the other, then you have a fair right to \r\nsuppose them to be only varieties of the same species, the same kind \r\nof thing, and that, therefore, they have a common origin.\r\n\r\nThat sounds rather magniloquent.  Let me give you a simple example.\r\n\r\nSuppose you had come into Britain with Brute, the grandson of AEneas, \r\nat that remote epoch when (as all archaeologists know who have duly \r\nread Geoffrey of Monmouth and the Arthuric legends) Britain was \r\ninhabited only by a few giants.  Now if you had met giants with one \r\nhead, and also giants with seven heads, and no others, you would have \r\nhad a right to say, \"There are two breeds of giants here, one-headed \r\nand seven-headed.\"  But if you had found, as Jack the Giant-Killer \r\n(who belongs to the same old cycle of myths) appears to have found, \r\ntwo-headed giants also, and three-headed, and giants, indeed, with \r\nany reasonable number of heads, would you not have been justified in \r\nsaying, \"They are all of the same breed, after all; only some are \r\nmore capitate, or heady, than others!\"\r\n\r\nI hope that you agree to that reasoning; for by it I think we arrive \r\nmost surely at a belief in the unity of the human race, and that the \r\nNegro is actually a man and a brother.\r\n\r\nIf the only two types of men in the world were an extreme white type, \r\nlike the Norwegians, and an extreme black type, like the Negros, then \r\nthere would be fair ground for saying, \"These two types have been \r\nalways distinct; they are different races, who have no common \r\norigin.\"  But if you found, as you will find, many types of man \r\nshowing endless gradations between the white man and the Negro, and \r\nnot only that, but endless gradations between them both and a third \r\ntype, whose extreme perhaps is the Chinese--endless gradations, I \r\nsay, showing every conceivable shade of resemblance or difference, \r\ntill you often cannot say to what type a given individual belongs; \r\nand all of them, however different from each other, more like each \r\nother than they are like any other creature upon earth; then you are \r\njustified in saying, \"All these are mere varieties of one kind.  \r\nHowever distinct they are now, they were probably like each other at \r\nfirst, and therefore all probably had a common origin.\"  That seems \r\nto me sound reasoning, and advanced natural science is corroborating \r\nit more and more daily.\r\n\r\nNow apply the same reasoning to coal.  You may find about the world--\r\nyou may see even in England alone--every gradation between coal and \r\ngrowing forest.  You may see the forest growing in its bed of \r\nvegetable mould; you may see the forest dead and converted into peat, \r\nwith stems and roots in it; that, again, into sunken forests, like \r\nthose to be seen below high-water mark on many coasts of this island.  \r\nYou find gradations between them and beds of lignite, or wood coal; \r\nthen gradations between lignite and common or bituminous coal; and \r\nthen gradations between common coal and culm, or anthracite, such as \r\nis found in South Wales.  Have you not a right to say, \"These are all \r\nbut varieties of the same kind of thing--namely, vegetable matter?  \r\nThey have a common origin--namely, woody fibre.  And coal, or rather \r\nculm, is the last link in a series of transformations from growing \r\nvegetation?\"\r\n\r\nThis is our first theory.  Let us try to verify it, as scientific men \r\nare in the habit of doing, by saying, If that be true, then something \r\nelse is likely to be true too.\r\n\r\nIf coal has all been vegetable soil, then it is likely that some of \r\nit has not been quite converted into shapeless coal.  It is likely \r\nthat there will be vegetable fibre still to be seen here and there; \r\nperhaps leaves, perhaps even stems of trees, as in a peat bog.  Let \r\nus look for them.\r\n\r\nYou will not need to look far.  The coal, and the sands and shales \r\nwhich accompany the coal, are so full of plant-remains, that three \r\nhundred species were known to Adolphe Brongniart as early as 1849, \r\nand that number has largely increased since.\r\n\r\nNow one point is specially noticeable about these plants of the coal; \r\nnamely, that they may at least have grown in swamps.\r\n\r\nFirst, you will be interested if you study the coal flora, with the \r\nabundance, beauty, and variety of the ferns.  Now ferns in these \r\nislands grow principally in rocky woods, because there, beside the \r\nmoisture, they get from decaying vegetable or decaying rock, \r\nespecially limestone, the carbonic acid which is their special food, \r\nand which they do not get on our dry pastures, and still less in our \r\ncultivated fields.  But in these islands there are two noble species, \r\nat least, which are true swamp-ferns; the Lastraea Thelypteris, which \r\nof old filled the fens, but is now all but extinct; and the Osmunda, \r\nor King-fern, which, as all know, will grow wherever it is damp \r\nenough about the roots.  In Hampshire, in Devon, and Cornwall, and in \r\nthe southwest of Ireland, the King-fern too is a true swamp fern.  \r\nBut in the Tropics I have seen more than once noble tree-ferns \r\ngrowing in wet savannahs at the sea-level, as freely as in the \r\nmountain-woods; ferns with such a stem as some of the coal ferns had, \r\nsome fifteen feet in height, under which, as one rode on horseback, \r\none saw the blazing blue sky, as through a parasol of delicate lace, \r\nas men might have long ages since have seen it, through the plumed \r\nfronds of the ferns now buried in the coal, had there only been a man \r\nthen created to enjoy its beauty.\r\n\r\nNext we find plants called by geologists Calamites.  There is no \r\ndoubt now that they are of the same family as our Equiseta, or horse-\r\ntails, a race which has, over most parts of the globe, dwindled down \r\nnow from twenty or thirty feet in height, as they were in the old \r\ncoal measures, to paltry little weeds.  The tallest Equisetum in \r\nEngland--the beautiful E. Telmateia--is seldom five feet high.  But \r\nthey, too, are mostly mud and swamp plants; and so may the Calamites \r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nThe Lepidodendrons, again, are without doubt the splendid old \r\nrepresentatives of a family now dwindled down to such creeping things \r\nas our club-mosses, or Lycopodiums.  Now it is a certain fact, which \r\ncan be proved by the microscope, that a very great part of the best \r\ncoal is actually made up of millions of the minute seeds of club-\r\nmosses, such as grow--a few of them, and those very small--on our \r\nmoors; a proof, surely, not only of the vast amount of the vegetation \r\nin the coal-making age, but also of the vast time during which it \r\nlasted.  The Lepidodendra may have been fifty or sixty feet high.  \r\nThere is not a Lycopodium in the world now, I believe, five feet \r\nhigh.  But the club-mosses are now, in these islands and elsewhere, \r\nlovers of wet and peaty soils, and so may their huger prototypes have \r\nbeen, in the old forests of the coal.\r\n\r\nOf the Sigillariae we cannot say as much with certainty, for \r\nbotanists are not agreed as to what low order of flowerless plants \r\nthey belong.  But that they rooted in clay beds there is proof, as \r\nyou will hear presently.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the Conifers, or pine-like trees--the Dadoxylon, of which \r\nthe pith goes by the name of Sternbergia, and the uncertain tree \r\nwhich furnishes in some coal-measures bushels of a seed connected \r\nwith that of the yew--we may suppose that they would find no more \r\ndifficulty in growing in swamps than the cypress, which forms so \r\nlarge a portion of the vegetation in the swamps of the Southern \r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI have given you these hints, because you will naturally wish to know \r\nwhat sort of a world it was in which all these strange plants grew \r\nand turned into coal.\r\n\r\nMy answer is, that it was most probably just like the world in which \r\nwe are living now, with the one exception that the plants and animals \r\nare different.\r\n\r\nIt was the fashion a few years since to explain the coal--like other \r\nphenomena of geology--by some mere hypothesis of a state of things \r\nquite unlike what we see now.  We were brought up to believe that in \r\nthe Carboniferous, or coal-bearing era, the atmosphere was intensely \r\nmoist and hot, and overcharged with carbonic acid, which had been \r\npoured out from the interior of the planet by volcanic eruptions, or \r\nby some other convulsion.  I forget most of it now:  and really there \r\nis no need to remember; for it is all, I verily believe, a dream--an \r\nattempt to explain the unknown not by the known, but by the still \r\nmore unknown.  You may find such theories lingering still in \r\nsensational school-books, if you like to be unscientific.  If you \r\nlike, on the other hand, to be scientific you will listen to those \r\nwho tell you that instead of there having been one unique \r\ncarboniferous epoch, with a peculiar coal-making climate, all epochs \r\nare carboniferous if they get the chance; that coal is of every age, \r\nfrom that of the Scotch and English beds, up to the present day.  The \r\ngreat coal-beds along the Rocky Mountains, for instance, are \r\ntertiary--that is, later than the chalk.  Coal is forming now, I \r\ndoubt not, in many places on the earth, and would form in many more, \r\nif man did not interfere with the processes of wild nature, by \r\ndraining the fens, and embanking the rivers.\r\n\r\nLet me by a few words prove this statement.  They will give you, \r\nbeside, a fresh proof of Sir Charles Lyell's great geological rule--\r\nthat the best way to explain what we see in ancient rocks is to take \r\nfor granted, as long as we can do so fairly, that things were going \r\non then very much as they are going on now.\r\n\r\nWhen it was first seen that coal had been once vegetable, the \r\nquestion arose--How did all these huge masses of vegetable matter get \r\nthere?  The Yorkshire and Derbyshire coal-fields, I hear, cover 700 \r\nor 800 square miles; the Lancashire about 200.  How large the North \r\nWales and the Scotch fields are I cannot say.  But doubtless a great \r\ndeal more coal than can be got at lies under the sea, especially in \r\nthe north of Wales.  Coal probably exists over vast sheets of England \r\nand France, buried so deeply under later rocks, that it cannot be \r\nreached by mining.  As an instance, a distinguished geologist has \r\nlong held that there are beds of coal under London itself, which \r\nrise, owing to a peculiar disturbance of the strata, to within 1,000 \r\nor 1,200 feet of the surface, and that we or our children may yet see \r\ncoal-mines in the marshes of the Thames.  And more, it is a provable \r\nfact that only a portion of the coal measures is left.  A great part \r\nof Ireland must once have been covered with coal, which is now \r\ndestroyed.  Indeed, it is likely that the coal now known of in Europe \r\nand America is but a remnant of what has existed there in former \r\nages, and has been eaten away by the inroads of the sea.\r\n\r\nNow whence did all that enormous mass of vegetable soil come?  Off \r\nsome neighbouring land, was the first and most natural answer.  It \r\nwas a rational one.  It proceeded from the known to the unknown.  It \r\nwas clear that these plants had grown on land; for they were land-\r\nplants.  It was clear that there must have been land close by, for \r\nbetween the beds of coal, as you all know, the rock is principally \r\ncoarse sandstone, which could only have been laid down (as I have \r\nexplained to you already) in very shallow water.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, then, to suppose that these plants and trees had been \r\nswept down by rivers into the sea, as the sands and muds which buried \r\nthem had been.  And it was known that at the mouths of certain \r\nrivers--the Mississippi, for instance--vast rafts of dead floating \r\ntrees accumulated; and that the bottoms of the rivers were often full \r\nof snags, etc.; trees which had grounded, and stuck in the mud; and \r\nwhy should not the coal have been formed in the same way?\r\n\r\nBecause--and this was a serious objection--then surely the coal would \r\nbe impure--mixed up with mud and sand, till it was not worth burning.  \r\nInstead of which, the coal is usually pure vegetable, parted sharply \r\nfrom the sandstone which lies on it.  The only other explanation was, \r\nthat the coal vegetation had grown in the very places where it was \r\nfound.  But that seemed too strange to be true, till that great \r\ngeologist, Sir W. Logan--who has since done such good work in Canada-\r\n-showed that every bed of coal had a bed of clay under it, and that \r\nthat clay always contained fossils called Stigmaria.  Then it came \r\nout that the Stigmaria in the under clay had long filaments attached \r\nto them, while when found in the sandstones or shales, they had lost \r\ntheir filaments, and seemed more or less rolled--in fact, that the \r\nnatural place of the Stigmaria was in the under clay.  Then Mr. \r\nBinney discovered a tree--a Sigillaria, standing upright in the coal-\r\nmeasures with its roots attached.  Those roots penetrated into the \r\nunder clay of the coal; and those roots were Stigmarias.  That seems \r\nto have settled the question.  The Sigillarias, at least, had grown \r\nwhere they were found, and the clay beneath the coal-beds was the \r\noriginal soil on which they had grown.  Just so, if you will look at \r\nany peat bog you will find it bottomed by clay, which clay is pierced \r\neverywhere by the roots of the moss forming the peat, or of the \r\ntrees, birches, alders, poplars, and willows, which grow in the bog.  \r\nSo the proof seemed complete, that the coal had been formed out of \r\nvegetation growing where it was buried.  If any further proof for \r\nthat theory was needed, it would be found in this fact, most \r\ningeniously suggested by Mr. Boyd Dawkins.  The resinous spores, or \r\nseeds of the Lepidodendra make up--as said above--a great part of the \r\nbituminous coal.  Now those spores are so light, that if the coal had \r\nbeen laid down by water, they would have floated on it, and have been \r\ncarried away; and therefore the bituminous coal must have been \r\nformed, not under water, but on dry land.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at length on these further arguments, because they seem \r\nto me as pretty a specimen as I can give my readers of that regular \r\nand gradual induction, that common-sense regulated, by which \r\ngeological theories are worked out.\r\n\r\nBut how does this theory explain the perfect purity of the coal?  I \r\nthink Sir C. Lyell answers that question fully in p. 383 of his \r\n\"Student's Elements of Geology.\"  He tells us that the dense growths \r\nof reeds and herbage which encompass the margins of forest-covered \r\nswamps in the valley and delta of the Mississippi, in passing through \r\nthem, are filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before they \r\nreach the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for \r\ncenturies, forming coal if the climate be favourable; and that in the \r\ncypress-swamps of that region no sediment mingles with the vegetable \r\nmatter accumulated from the decay of trees and semi-aquatic plants; \r\nso that when, in a very dry season, the swamp is set on fire, pits \r\nare burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as far as the fire can \r\ngo down without reaching water, and scarcely any earthy residuum is \r\nleft; just as when the soil of the English fens catches fire, red-hot \r\nholes are eaten down through pure peat till the water-bearing clay \r\nbelow is reached.  But the purity of the water in peaty lagoons is \r\nobservable elsewhere than in the delta of the Mississippi.  What can \r\nbe more transparent than many a pool surrounded by quaking bogs, \r\nfringed, as they are in Ireland, with a ring of white water-lilies, \r\nwhich you dare not stoop to pick, lest the peat, bending inward, \r\nslide you down into that clear dark gulf some twenty feet in depth, \r\nbottomed and walled with yielding ooze, from which there is no \r\nescape?  Most transparent, likewise, is the water of the West Indian \r\nswamps.  Though it is of the colour of coffee, or rather of dark \r\nbeer, and so impregnated with gases that it produces fever or cholera \r\nwhen drunk, yet it is--at least when it does not mingle with the salt \r\nwater--so clear, that one might see every marking on a boa-\r\nconstrictor or alligator, if he glided along the bottom under the \r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nBut now comes the question--Even if all this be true, how were the \r\nforests covered up in shale and sandstone, one after another?\r\n\r\nBy gradual sinking of the land, one would suppose.\r\n\r\nIf we find, as we may find in a hundred coal-pits, trees rooted as \r\nthey grew, with their trunks either standing up through the coal, and \r\nthrough the sandstone above the coal; their bark often remaining as \r\ncoal while their inside is filled up with sandstone, has not our \r\ncommon-sense a right to say--The land on which they grew sank below \r\nthe water-line; the trees were killed; and the mud and sand which \r\nwere brought down the streams enveloped their trunks?  As for the \r\ninside being full of sandstone, have we not all seen hollow trees?  \r\nDo we not all know that when a tree dies its wood decays first, its \r\nbark last?  It is so, especially in the Tropics.  There one may see \r\nhuge dead trees with their bark seemingly sound, and their inside a \r\nmere cavern with touchwood at the bottom; into which caverns one used \r\nto peep with some caution.  For though one might have found inside \r\nonly a pair of toucans, or parrots, or a whole party of jolly little \r\nmonkeys, one was quite as likely to find a poisonous snake four or \r\nfive feet long, whose bite would have very certainly prevented me \r\nhaving the pleasure of writing this book.\r\n\r\nNow is it not plain that if such trees as that sunk, their bark would \r\nbe turned into lignite, and at last into coal, while their insides \r\nwould be silted up with mud and sand?  Thus a core or pillar of hard \r\nsandstone would be formed, which might do to the collier of the \r\nfuture what they are too apt to do now in the Newcastle and Bristol \r\ncollieries.  For there, when the coal is worked out below, the \r\nsandstone stems--\"coal-pipes\" as the colliers call them--in the roof \r\nof the seam, having no branches, and nothing to hold them up but \r\ntheir friable bark of coal, are but too apt to drop out suddenly, \r\nkilling or wounding the hapless men below.\r\n\r\nOr again, if we find--as we very often find--as was found at \r\nParkfield Colliery, near Wolverhampton, in the year 1814--a quarter \r\nof an acre of coal-seam filled. with stumps of trees as they grew, \r\ntheir trunks broken off and lying in every direction, turned into \r\ncoal, and flattened, as coal-fossils so often are, by the weight of \r\nthe rock above--should we not have a right to say--These trees were \r\nsnapped off where they grew by some violent convulsion; by a storm, \r\nor by a sudden inrush of water owing to a sudden sinking of the land, \r\nor by the very earthquake shock itself which sank the land?\r\n\r\nBut what evidence have we of such sinkings?  The plain fact that you \r\nhave coal-seam above coal-seam, each with its bed of under-clay; and \r\nthat therefore the land MUST have sunk ere the next bed of soil could \r\nhave been deposited, and the next forest have grown on it.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Rocky Mountain coal-fields there are more than thirty \r\nseams of coal, each with its under-clay below it.  What can that mean \r\nbut thirty or more subsidences of the land, and the peat of thirty or \r\nmore forests or peat-mosses, one above the other?  And now if any \r\nreader shall say, Subsidence?  What is this quite new element which \r\nyou have brought into your argument?  You told us that you would \r\nreason from the known to the unknown.  What do we know of subsidence?  \r\nYou offered to explain the thing which had gone on once by that which \r\nis going on now.  Where is subsidence going on now upon the surface \r\nof our planet?  And where, too, upheaval, such as would bring us \r\nthese buried forests up again from under the sea-level, and make \r\nthem, like our British coal-field, dry land once more?\r\n\r\nThe answer is--Subsidence and elevation of the land are common now, \r\nprobably just as common as they were in any age of this planet's \r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nTo give two instances, made now notorious by the writings of \r\ngeologists.  As lately as 1819 a single earthquake shock in Cutch, at \r\nthe mouth of the Indus, sunk a tract of land larger than the Lake of \r\nGeneva in some places to a depth of eighteen feet, and converted it \r\ninto an inland sea.  The same shock raised, a few miles off, a \r\ncorresponding sheet of land some fifty miles in length, and in some \r\nparts sixteen miles broad, ten feet above the level of the alluvial \r\nplain, and left it to be named by the country-people the \"Ullah \r\nBund,\" or bank of God, to distinguish it from the artificial banks in \r\nthe neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAgain:  in the valley of the Mississippi--a tract which is now, it \r\nwould seem, in much the same state as central England was while our \r\ncoal-fields were being laid down--the earthquakes of 1811-12 caused \r\nlarge lakes to appear suddenly in many parts of the district, amid \r\nthe dense forests of cypress.  One of these, the \"Sunk Country,\" near \r\nNew Madrid, is between seventy and eighty miles in length, and thirty \r\nmiles in breadth, and throughout it, as late as 1846, \"dead trees \r\nwere conspicuous, some erect in the water, others fallen, and strewed \r\nin dense masses over the bottom, in the shallows, and near the \r\nshore.\"  I quote these words from Sir Charles Lyell's \"Principles of \r\nGeology\" (11th edit.), vol. i. p. 453.  And I cannot do better than \r\nadvise my readers, if they wish to know more of the way in which coal \r\nwas formed, to read what is said in that book concerning the Delta of \r\nthe Mississippi, and its strata of forests sunk where they grew, and \r\nin some places upraised again, alternating with beds of clay and \r\nsand, vegetable soil, recent sea-shells, and what not, forming, to a \r\ndepth of several hundred feet, just such a mass of beds as exists in \r\nour own coal-fields at this day.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the reader wishes to picture to himself the scenery of \r\nwhat is now central England, during the period when our coal was \r\nbeing laid down, he has only, I believe, to transport himself in \r\nfancy to any great alluvial delta, in a moist and warm climate, \r\nfavourable to the growth of vegetation.  He has only to conceive \r\nwooded marshes, at the mouth of great rivers, slowly sinking beneath \r\nthe sea; the forests in them killed by the water, and then covered up \r\nby layers of sand, brought down from inland, till that new layer \r\nbecame dry land, to carry a fresh crop of vegetation.  He has thus \r\nall that he needs to explain how coal-measures were formed.  I myself \r\nsaw once a scene of that kind, which I should be sorry to forget; for \r\nthere was, as I conceived, coal, making, or getting ready to be made, \r\nbefore my eyes:  a sheet of swamp, sinking slowly into the sea; for \r\nthere stood trees, still rooted below high-water mark, and killed by \r\nthe waves; while inland huge trees stood dying, or dead, from the \r\nwater at their roots.  But what a scene--a labyrinth of narrow \r\ncreeks, so narrow that a canoe could not pass up, haunted with \r\nalligators and boa-constrictors, parrots and white herons, amid an \r\ninextricable confusion of vegetable mud, roots of the alder-like \r\nmangroves, and tangled creepers hanging from tree to tree; and \r\noverhead huge fan-palms, delighting in the moisture, mingled with \r\nstill huger broad-leaved trees in every stage of decay.  The drowned \r\nvegetable soil of ages beneath me; above my head, for a hundred feet, \r\na mass of stems and boughs, and leaves and flowers, compared with \r\nwhich the richest hothouse in England was poor and small.  But if the \r\nsinking process which was going on continued a few hundred years, all \r\nthat huge mass of wood and leaf would be sunk beneath the swamp, and \r\ncovered up in mud washed down from the mountains, and sand driven in \r\nfrom the sea; to form a bed many feet thick, of what would be first \r\npeat, then lignite, and last, it may be, coal, with the stems of \r\nkilled trees standing up out of it into the new mud and sand-beds \r\nabove it, just as the Sigillariae and other stems stand up in the \r\ncoal-beds both of Britain and of Nova Scotia; while over it a fresh \r\nforest would grow up, to suffer the same fate--if the sinking process \r\nwent on--as that which had preceded it.\r\n\r\nThat was a sight not easily to be forgotten.  But we need not have \r\ngone so far from home, at least, a few hundred years ago, to see an \r\nexactly similar one.  The fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, before \r\nthe rivers were embanked, the water pumped off, the forests felled, \r\nand the reed-beds ploughed up, were exactly in the same state.  The \r\nvast deposits of peat between Cambridge and the sea, often filled \r\nwith timber-trees, either fallen or upright as they grew, and often \r\nmixed with beds of sand or mud, brought down in floods, were formed \r\nin exactly the same way; and if they had remained undrained, then \r\nthat slow sinking, which geologists say is going on over the whole \r\narea of the Fens, would have brought them gradually, but surely, \r\nbelow the sea-level, to be covered up by new forests, and converted \r\nin due time into coal.  And future geologists would have found--they \r\nmay find yet, if, which God forbid, England should become barbarous \r\nand the trees be thrown out of cultivation--instead of fossil \r\nLepidodendra and Sigillariae, Calamites and ferns, fossil ashes and \r\noaks, alders and poplars, bulrushes and reeds.  Almost the only \r\nfossil fern would have been that tall and beautiful Lastraea \r\nThelypteris, once so abundant, now all but destroyed by drainage and \r\nthe plough.\r\n\r\nWe need not, therefore, fancy any extraordinary state of things on \r\nthis planet while our English coal was being formed.  The climate of \r\nthe northern hemisphere--Britain, at least, and Nova Scotia--was \r\nwarmer than now, to judge from the abundance of ferns; and especially \r\nof tree-ferns; but not so warm, to judge from the presence of \r\nconifers (trees of the pine tribe), as the Tropics.  Moreover, there \r\nmust have been, it seems to me, a great scarcity of animal-life.  \r\nInsects are found, beautifully preserved; a few reptiles, too, and \r\nland-shells; but very few.  And where are the traces of such a \r\nswarming life as would be entombed were a tropic forest now sunk; \r\nwhich is found entombed in many parts of our English fens?  The only \r\nexplanation which I can offer is this--that the club-mosses, tree-\r\nferns, pines, and other low-ranked vegetation of the coal afforded \r\nlittle or no food for animals, as the same families of plants do to \r\nthis day; and if creatures can get nothing to eat, they certainly \r\ncannot multiply and replenish the earth.  But, be that as it may, the \r\nfact that coal is buried forest is not affected.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the shape and arrangements of sea and land must have been \r\nutterly different from what they are now.  Where was that great land, \r\noff which great rivers ran to deposit our coal-measures in their \r\ndeltas?  It has been supposed, for good reasons, that north-western \r\nFrance, Belgium, Holland, and Germany were then under the sea; that \r\nDenmark and Norway were joined to Scotland by a continent, a tongue \r\nof which ran across the centre of England, and into Ireland, dividing \r\nthe northern and southern coal-fields.  But how far to the west and \r\nnorth did that old continent stretch?  Did it, as it almost certainly \r\ndid long ages afterwards, join Greenland and North America with \r\nScotland and Norway?  Were the northern fields of Nova Scotia, which \r\nare of the same geological age as our own, and contain the same \r\nplants, laid down by rivers which ran off the same continent as ours?  \r\nWho can tell now?  That old land, and all record of it, save what \r\nthese fragmentary coal-measures can give, are buried in the dark \r\nabyss of countless ages; and we can only look back with awe, and \r\ncomfort ourselves with the thought--Let Time be ever so vast, yet \r\nTime is not Eternity.\r\n\r\nOne word more.  If my readers have granted that all for which I have \r\nargued is probable, they will still have a right to ask for further \r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThey will be justified in saying:  \"You say that coal is transformed \r\nvegetable matter; but can you show us how the transformation takes \r\nplace?  Is it possible according to known natural laws?\"\r\n\r\nThe chemist must answer that.  And he tells us that wood can become \r\nlignite, or wood-coal, by parting with its oxygen, in the shape of \r\ncarbonic acid gas, or choke-damp; and then common or bituminous coal, \r\nby parting with its hydrogen, chiefly in the form of carburetted \r\nhydrogen--the gas with which we light our streets.  That is about as \r\nmuch as the unscientific reader need know.  But it is a fresh \r\ncorroboration of the theory that coal has been once vegetable fibre, \r\nfor it shows how vegetable fibre can, by the laws of nature, become \r\ncoal.  And it certainly helps us to believe that a thing has been \r\ndone, if we are shown that it can be done.\r\n\r\nThis fact explains, also, why in mines of wood-coal carbonic acid, \r\ni.e. choke-damp, alone is given off.  For in the wood-coal a great \r\ndeal of the hydrogen still remains.  In mines of true coal, not only \r\nis choke-damp given off, but that more terrible pest of the miners, \r\nfire-damp, or explosive carburetted hydrogen and olefiant gases.  Now \r\nthe occurrence of that fire-damp in mines proves that changes are \r\nstill going on in the coal:  that it is getting rid of its hydrogen, \r\nand so progressing toward the state of anthracite or culm--stone-coal \r\nas it is sometimes called.  In the Pennsylvanian coal-fields some of \r\nthe coal has actually done this, under the disturbing force of \r\nearthquakes; for the coal, which is bituminous, like our common coal, \r\nto the westward where the strata are horizontal, becomes gradually \r\nanthracite as it is tossed and torn by the earthquake faults of the \r\nAlleghany and Appalachian mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd is a further transformation possible?  Yes; and more than one.  \r\nIf we conceive the anthracite cleared of all but its last atoms of \r\noxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, till it has become all but pure \r\ncarbon, it would become--as it has become in certain rocks of immense \r\nantiquity, graphite--what we miscall black-lead.  And, after that, it \r\nmight go through one transformation more, and that the most startling \r\nof all.  It would need only perfect purification and crystallisation \r\nto become--a diamond; nothing less.  We may consider the coal upon \r\nthe fire as the middle term of a series, of which the first is live \r\nwood, and the last diamond; and indulge safely in the fancy that \r\nevery diamond in the world has probably, at some remote epoch, formed \r\npart of a growing plant.\r\n\r\nA strange transformation; which will look to us more strange, more \r\ntruly poetical, the more steadily we consider it.\r\n\r\nThe coal on the fire; the table at which I write--what are they made \r\nof?  Gas and sunbeams; with a small percentage of ash, or earthy \r\nsalts, which need hardly be taken into account.\r\n\r\nGas and sunbeams.  Strange, but true.\r\n\r\nThe life of the growing plant--and what that life is who can tell?--\r\nlaid hold of the gases in the air and in the soil; of the carbonic \r\nacid, the atmospheric air, the water--for that too is gas.  It drank \r\nthem in through its rootlets:  it breathed them in through its leaf-\r\npores, that it might distil them into sap, and bud, and leaf, and \r\nwood.  But it has to take in another element, without which the \r\ndistillation and the shaping could never have taken place.  It had to \r\ndrink in the sunbeams--that mysterious and complex force which is for \r\never pouring from the sun, and making itself partly palpable to our \r\nsenses as heat and light.  So the life of the plant seized the \r\nsunbeams, and absorbed them, buried them in itself--no longer as \r\nlight and heat, but as invisible chemical force, locked up for ages \r\nin that woody fibre.\r\n\r\nSo it is.  Lord Lytton told us long ago, in a beautiful song, how\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wind and the Beam loved the Rose.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Nature's poetry was more beautiful than man's.  The wind and the \r\nbeam loved the rose so well that they made the rose--or rather, the \r\nrose took the wind and the beam, and built up out of them, by her own \r\ninner life, her exquisite texture, hue, and fragrance.\r\n\r\nWhat next?  The rose dies; the timber tree dies; decays down into \r\nvegetable fibre, is buried, and turned to coal:  but the plant cannot \r\naltogether undo its own work.  Even in death and decay it cannot set \r\nfree the sunbeams imprisoned in its tissue.  The sun-force must stay, \r\nshut up age after age, invisible, but strong; working at its own \r\nprison-cells; transmuting them, or making them capable of being \r\ntransmuted by man, into the manifold products of coal--coke, \r\npetroleum, mineral pitch, gases, coal-tar, benzole, delicate aniline \r\ndyes, and what not, till its day of deliverance comes.\r\n\r\nMan digs it, throws it on the fire, a black, dead-seeming lump.  A \r\ncorner, an atom of it, warms till it reaches the igniting point; the \r\ntemperature at which it is able to combine with oxygen.\r\n\r\nAnd then, like a dormant live thing, awaking after ages to the sense \r\nof its own powers, its own needs, the whole lump is seized, atom \r\nafter atom, with an infectious hunger for that oxygen which it lost \r\ncenturies since in the bottom of the earth.  It drinks the oxygen in \r\nat every pore; and burns.\r\n\r\nAnd so the spell of ages is broken.  The sun-force bursts its prison-\r\ncells, and blazes into the free atmosphere, as light and heat once \r\nmore; returning in a moment into the same forms in which it entered \r\nthe growing leaf a thousand centuries since.\r\n\r\nStrange it all is, yet true.  But of nature, as of the heart of man, \r\nthe old saying stands--that truth is stranger than fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  THE LIME IN THE MORTAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall presume in all my readers some slight knowledge about lime.  \r\nI shall take for granted, for instance, that all are better informed \r\nthan a certain party of Australian black fellows were a few years \r\nsince.\r\n\r\nIn prowling on the track of a party of English settlers, to see what \r\nthey could pick up, they came--oh joy!--on a sack of flour, dropped \r\nand left behind in the bush at a certain creek.  The poor savages had \r\nnot had such a prospect of a good meal for many a day.  With endless \r\njabbering and dancing, the whole tribe gathered round the precious \r\nflour-bag with all the pannikins, gourds, and other hollow articles \r\nit could muster, each of course with a due quantity of water from the \r\ncreek therein, and the chief began dealing out the flour by handfuls, \r\nbeginning of course with the boldest warriors.  But, horror of \r\nhorrors, each man's porridge swelled before his eyes, grew hot, \r\nsmoked, boiled over.  They turned and fled, man, woman, and child, \r\nfrom before that supernatural prodigy; and the settlers coming back \r\nto look for the dropped sack, saw a sight which told the whole tale.  \r\nFor the poor creatures, in their terror, had thrown away their pans \r\nand calabashes, each filled with that which it was likely to contain, \r\nseeing that the sack itself had contained, not flour, but quick-lime.  \r\nIn memory of which comi-tragedy, that creek is called to this day, \r\n\"Flour-bag Creek.\"\r\n\r\nNow I take for granted that you are all more learned than these black \r\nfellows, and know quick-lime from flour.  But still you are not bound \r\nto know what quick-lime is.  Let me explain it to you.\r\n\r\nLime, properly speaking, is a metal, which goes among chemists by the \r\nname of calcium.  But it is formed, as you all know, in the earth, \r\nnot as a metal, but as a stone, as chalk or limestone, which is a \r\ncarbonate of lime; that is, calcium combined with oxygen and \r\ncarbonic-acid gases.\r\n\r\nIn that state it will make, if it is crystalline and hard, excellent \r\nbuilding stone.  The finest white marble, like that of Carrara in \r\nItaly, of which the most delicate statues are carved, is carbonate of \r\nlime altered and hardened by volcanic heat.  But to make mortar of \r\nit, it must be softened and then brought into a state in which it can \r\nbe hardened again; and ages since, some man or other, who deserves to \r\nrank as one of the great inventors, one of the great benefactors of \r\nhis race, discovered the art of making lime soft and hard again; in \r\nfact of making mortar.  The discovery was probably very ancient; and \r\nmade, probably like most of the old discoveries, in the East, \r\nspreading Westward gradually.  The earlier Greek buildings are \r\ncyclopean, that is, of stone fitted together without mortar.  The \r\nearlier Egyptian buildings, though the stones are exquisitely squared \r\nand polished, are put together likewise without mortar.  So, long \r\nages after, were the earlier Roman buildings, and even some of the \r\nlater.  The famous aqueduct of the Pont du Gard, near Nismes, in the \r\nsouth of France, has, if I recollect right, no mortar whatever in it.  \r\nThe stones of its noble double tier of circular arches have been \r\ndropped into their places upon the wooden centres, and stand unmoved \r\nto this day, simply by the jamming of their own weight; a miracle of \r\nart.  But the fact is puzzling; for these Romans were the best mortar \r\nmakers of the world.  We cannot, I believe, surpass them in the art \r\neven now; and in some of their old castles, the mortar is actually to \r\nthis day harder and tougher than the stones which it holds together.  \r\nAnd they had plenty of lime at hand if they had chosen to make \r\nmortar.  The Pont du Gard crosses a limestone ravine, and is itself \r\nbuilt of limestone.  But I presume the cunning Romans would not trust \r\nmortar made from that coarse Nummulite limestone, filled with gritty \r\nsand, and preferred, with their usual carefulness, no mortar at all \r\nto bad.\r\n\r\nBut I must return, and tell my readers, in a few words, the chemical \r\nhistory of mortar.  If limestone be burnt, or rather roasted, in a \r\nkiln, the carbonic acid is given off--as you may discover by your own \r\nnose; as many a poor tramp has discovered too late, when, on a cold \r\nwinter night, he has lain down by the side of the burning kiln to \r\nkeep himself warm, and woke in the other world, stifled to death by \r\nthe poisonous fumes.\r\n\r\nThe lime then gives off its carbonic acid, and also its water of \r\ncrystallisation, that is, water which it holds (as do many rocks) \r\nlocked up in it unseen, and only to be discovered by chemical \r\nanalysis.  It is then anhydrous--that is, waterless--oxide of lime, \r\nwhat we call quick-lime; that which figured in the comi-tragedy of \r\n\"Flour-bag Creek;\" and then, as you may find if you get it under your \r\nnails or into your eyes, will burn and blister like an acid.\r\n\r\nThis has to be turned again into a hard and tough artificial \r\nlimestone, in plain words, into mortar; and the first step is to \r\nslack it--that is, to give it back the water which it has lost, and \r\nfor which it is as it were thirsting.  So it is slacked with water, \r\nwhich it drinks in, heating itself and the water till it steams and \r\nswells in bulk, because it takes the substance of the water into its \r\nown substance.  Slacked lime, as we all know, is not visibly wetter \r\nthan quick-lime; it crumbles to a dry white powder in spite of all \r\nthe water which it contains.\r\n\r\nThen it must be made to set, that is, to return to limestone, to \r\ncarbonate of lime, by drinking in the carbonic acid from water and \r\nair, which some sorts of lime will do instantly, setting at once, and \r\nbeing therefore used as cements.  But the lime usually employed must \r\nbe mixed with more or less sand to make it set hard:  a mysterious \r\nprocess, of which it will be enough to tell the reader that the sand \r\nand lime are said to unite gradually, not only mechanically, that is, \r\nby sticking together; but also in part chemically--that is, by \r\nforming out of themselves a new substance, which is called silicate \r\nof lime.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the mortar paste has now to do two things; first \r\nto dry, and next to take up carbonic acid from the air and water, \r\nenough to harden it again into limestone:  and that it will take some \r\ntime in doing.  A thick wall, I am informed, requires several years \r\nbefore it is set throughout, and has acquired its full hardness, or \r\nrather toughness; and good mortar, as is well known, will acquire \r\nextreme hardness with age, probably from the very same cause that it \r\ndid when it was limestone in the earth.  For, as a general rule, the \r\nmore ancient the strata is in which the limestone is found, the \r\nharder the limestone is; except in cases where volcanic action and \r\nearthquake pressure have hardened limestone in more recent strata, as \r\nin the case of the white marbles of Carrara in Italy, which are of \r\nthe age of our Oolites, that is, of the freestone of Bath, etc., \r\nhardened by the heat of intruded volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nBut now:  what is the limestone? and how did it get where it is--not \r\ninto the mortar, I mean, but into the limestone quarry?  Let me tell \r\nyou, or rather, help you to tell yourselves, by leading you, as \r\nbefore, from the known to the unknown.  Let me lead you to places \r\nunknown indeed to most; but there may be sailors or soldiers among my \r\nreaders who know them far better than I do.  Let me lead you, in \r\nfancy, to some island in the Tropic seas.  After all, I am not \r\nleading you as far away as you fancy by several thousand miles, as \r\nyou will see, I trust, ere I have done.\r\n\r\nLet me take you to some island:  what shall it be like?  Shall it be \r\na high island, with cliff piled on cliff, and peak on peak, all rich \r\nwith mighty forests, like a furred mantle of green velvet, mounting \r\nup and up till it is lost among white clouds above?  Or shall it be a \r\nmere low reef, which you do not see till you are close upon it; on \r\nwhich nothing rises above the water, but here and there a knot of \r\ncocoa-nut palms or a block of stone, or a few bushes, swarming with \r\ninnumerable sea-fowl and their eggs?  Let it be which you will:  both \r\nare strange enough; both beautiful; both will tell us a story.\r\n\r\nThe ship will have to lie-to, and anchor if she can; it may be a \r\nmile, it may be only a few yards, from the land.  For between it and \r\nthe land will be a line of breakers, raging in before the warm trade-\r\nwind.  And this, you will be told, marks the edge of the coral reef.\r\n\r\nYou will have to go ashore in a boat, over a sea which looks \r\nunfathomable, and which may be a mile or more in depth, and search \r\nfor an opening in the reef, through which the boat can pass without \r\nbeing knocked to pieces.\r\n\r\nYou find one:  and in a moment, what a change!  The deep has suddenly \r\nbecome shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at \r\nthe bottom.  But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of \r\nit; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the \r\ncoral is starred with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey, \r\nevery conceivable hue; and that these are the coral polypes, each \r\nwith its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up \r\ntheir common habitations of lime.  If you want to understand, by a \r\nrough but correct description, what a coral polype is:  all who have \r\nbeen to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones.  \r\nNow coral polypes are sea-anemones, which make each a shell of lime, \r\ngrowing with its growth.  As for their shapes, the variety of them, \r\nthe beauty of them, no tongue can describe them.  If you want to see \r\nthem, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and \r\njudge for yourselves.  Only remember that you must re-clothe each of \r\nthose exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate \r\nhue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living \r\nflower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower \r\ngarden, the gaudiest of shell-less sea-anemones, such as we have on \r\nour coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as \r\ngaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic \r\nand exuberant life.  You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially \r\nthe parrot-fish, some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend \r\ntheir lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and \r\ngrinding teeth, just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal \r\nmatter, and throwing away the lime in the form of an impalpable white \r\nmud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.\r\n\r\nThe bottom, just outside the reef, is covered with that mud, mixed \r\nwith more lime-mud, which the surge wears off the reef; and if you \r\nhave, as you should have, a dredge on board, and try a haul of that \r\nmud as you row home, you may find, but not always, animal forms \r\nrooted in it, which will delight the soul of a scientific man.  One, \r\nI hope, would be some sort of Terebratula, or shell akin to it.  You \r\nwould probably think it a cockle:  but you would be wrong.  The \r\nanimal which dwells in it has about the same relationship to a cockle \r\nas a dog has to a bird.  It is a Brachiopod; a family with which the \r\nancient seas once swarmed, but which is rare now, all over the world, \r\nhaving been supplanted and driven out of the seas by newer and \r\nstronger forms of shelled animals.  The nearest spot at which you are \r\nlikely to dredge a live Brachiopod will be in the deep water of Loch \r\nFyne, in Argyleshire, where two species still linger, fastened, \r\nstrangely enough, to the smooth pebbles of a submerged glacier, \r\nformed in the open air during the age of ice, but sunk now to a depth \r\nof eighty fathoms.  The first time I saw those shells come up in the \r\ndredge out of the dark and motionless abyss, I could sympathise with \r\nthe feelings of mingled delight and awe which, so my companion told \r\nme, the great Professor Owen had in the same spot first beheld the \r\nsame lingering remnants of a primaeval world.\r\n\r\nThe other might be (but I cannot promise you even a chance of \r\ndredging that, unless you were off the coast of Portugal, or the \r\nwindward side of some of the West India Islands) a live Crinoid; an \r\nexquisite starfish, with long and branching arms, but rooted in the \r\nmud by a long stalk, and that stalk throwing out barren side \r\nbranches; the whole a living plant of stone.  You may see in museums \r\nspecimens of this family, now so rare, all but extinct.  And yet \r\nfifty or a hundred different forms of the same type swarmed in the \r\nancient seas:  whole masses of limestone are made up of little else \r\nbut the fragments of such animals.\r\n\r\nBut we have not landed yet on the dry part of the reef.  Let us make \r\nfor it, taking care meanwhile that we do not get our feet cut by the \r\ncoral, or stung as by nettles by the coral insects.  We shall see \r\nthat the dry land is made up entirely of coral, ground and broken by \r\nthe waves, and hurled inland by the storm, sometimes in huge \r\nboulders, mostly as fine mud; and that, under the influence of the \r\nsun and of the rain, which filters through it, charged with lime from \r\nthe rotting coral, the whole is setting, as cement sets, into rock.  \r\nAnd what is this?  A long bank of stone standing up as a low cliff, \r\nten or twelve feet above high-water mark.  It is full of fragments of \r\nshell, of fragments of coral, of all sorts of animal remains; and the \r\nlower part of it is quite hard rock.  Moreover, it is bedded in \r\nregular layers, just such as you see in a quarry.  But how did it get \r\nthere?  It must have been formed at the sea-level, some of it, \r\nindeed, under the sea; for here are great masses of madrepore and \r\nlimestone corals imbedded just as they grew.  What lifted it up?  \r\nYour companions, if you have any who know the island, have no \r\ndifficulty in telling you.  It was hove up, they say, in the \r\nearthquake in such and such a year; and they will tell you, perhaps, \r\nthat if you will go on shore to the main island which rises inside \r\nthe reef, you may see dead coral beds just like these lying on the \r\nold rocks, and sloping up along the flanks of the mountains to \r\nseveral hundred feet above the sea.  I have seen such many a time.\r\n\r\nThus you find the coral being converted gradually into a limestone \r\nrock, either fine and homogeneous, composed of coral grown into pulp, \r\nor filled with corals and shells, or with angular fragments of older \r\ncoral rock.  Did you never see that last?  No?  Yes, you have a \r\nhundred times.  You have but to look at the marbles commonly used \r\nabout these islands, with angular fragments imbedded in the mass, and \r\nhere and there a shell, the whole cemented together by water holding \r\nin solution carbonate of lime, and there see the very same phenomenon \r\nperpetuated to this day.\r\n\r\nThus, I think, we have got first from the known to the unknown; from \r\na tropic coral island back here to the limestone hills of Great \r\nBritain; and I did not speak at random when I said that I was not \r\nleading you away as far as you fancied by several thousand miles.\r\n\r\nExamine any average limestone quarry from Bristol to Berwick, and you \r\nwill see there all that I have been describing; that is, all of it \r\nwhich is not soft animal matter, certain to decay.  You will see the \r\nlime-mud hardened into rock beds; you will see the shells embedded in \r\nit; you will see the corals in every stage of destruction; you will \r\nsee whole layers made up of innumerable fragments of Crinoids--no \r\nwonder they are innumerable, for, it has been calculated, there are \r\nin a single animal of some of the species 140,000 joints--140,000 \r\nbits of lime to fall apart when its soft parts decay.  But is it not \r\nall there?  And why should it not have got there by the same process \r\nby which similar old coral beds get up the mountain sides in the West \r\nIndies and elsewhere; namely, by the upheaving force of earthquakes?  \r\nWhen you see similar effects, you have a right to presume similar \r\ncauses.  If you see a man fall off a house here, and break his neck; \r\nand some years after, in London or New York, or anywhere else, find \r\nanother man lying at the foot of another house, with his neck broken \r\nin the same way, is it not a very fair presumption that he has fallen \r\noff a house likewise?\r\n\r\nYou may be wrong.  He may have come to his end by a dozen other \r\nmeans:  but you must have proof of that.  You will have a full right, \r\nin science and in common sense, to say--That man fell off the house, \r\ntill some one proves to you that he did not.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is nothing which you see in the limestones of these \r\nisles--save and except the difference in every shell and coral--which \r\nyou would not see in the coral-beds of the West Indies, if such \r\nearthquakes as that famous one at St. Thomas's, in 1866, became \r\ncommon and periodic, upheaving the land (they needs upheave it a very \r\nlittle, only two hundred and fifty feet), till St. Thomas's, and all \r\nthe Virgin Isles, and the mighty mountain of Porto Rico, which looms \r\nup dim and purple to the west, were all joined into dry land once \r\nmore, and the lonely coral-shoal of Anegada were raised, as it would \r\nbe raised then, into a limestone table-land, like that of Central \r\nIreland, of Galway, or of County Clare.\r\n\r\nBut you must clearly understand, that however much these coralline \r\nlimestones have been upheaved since they were formed, yet the sea-\r\nbottom, while they were being formed, was sinking and not rising.  \r\nThis is a fact which was first pointed out by Mr. Darwin, from the \r\nobservations which he made in the world-famous Voyage of the Beagle; \r\nand the observations of subsequent great naturalists have all gone to \r\ncorroborate his theory.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed at first, you must understand, that when a coral \r\nisland rose steeply to the surface of the sea out of blue water, \r\nperhaps a thousand fathoms or more, that fact was plain proof that \r\nthe little coral polypes had begun at the bottom of the sea, and, in \r\nthe course of ages, built up the whole island an enormous depth.\r\n\r\nBut it soon came out that that theory was not correct; for the coral \r\npolypes cannot live and build save in shallow water--say in thirty to \r\nforty fathoms.  Indeed, some of the strongest and largest species \r\nwork best at the very surface, and in the cut of the fiercest surf.  \r\nAnd so arose a puzzle as to how coral rock is often found of vast \r\nthickness, which Mr. Darwin explained.  His theory was, and there is \r\nno doubt now that it is correct, that in these cases the sea-bottom \r\nis sinking; that as it sinks, carrying the coral beds down with it, \r\nthe coral dies, and a fresh live crop of polypes builds on the top of \r\nthe houses of their dead ancestors:  so that, as the depression goes \r\non, generation after generation builds upwards, the living on the \r\ndead, keeping the upper surface of the reef at the same level, while \r\nits base is sinking downward into the abyss.\r\n\r\nApplying this theory to the coral reef of the Pacific Ocean, the \r\nfollowing interesting facts were made out:\r\n\r\nThat where you find an Island rising out of deep water, with a ring \r\nof coral round it, a little way from the shore--or, as in Eastern \r\nAustralia, a coast with a fringing reef (the Flinders reef of \r\nAustralia is eleven thousand miles long)--that is a pretty sure sign \r\nthat that shore, or mountain, is sinking slowly beneath the sea.  \r\nThat where you find, as you often do in the Pacific, a mere atoll, or \r\ncircular reef of coral, with a shallow pond of smooth water in the \r\ncentre, and deep sea round, that is a pretty sure sign that the \r\nmountain-top has sunk completely into the sea, and that the corals \r\nare going on building where its peak once was.\r\n\r\nAnd more.  On working out the geography of the South Sea Islands by \r\nthe light of this theory of Mr. Darwin's, the following extraordinary \r\nfact has been discovered:\r\n\r\nThat over a great part of the Pacific Ocean sinking is going on, and \r\nhas been going on for ages; and that the greater number of the \r\nbeautiful and precious South Sea Islands are only the remnants of a \r\nvast continent or archipelago, which once stretched for thousands of \r\nmiles between Australia and South America.\r\n\r\nNow, applying the same theory to limestone beds, which are, as you \r\nknow, only fossil coral reefs, we have a right to say, when we see in \r\nEngland, Scotland, Ireland, limestones several thousand feet thick, \r\nthat while they were being laid down as coral reef, the sea-bottom, \r\nand probably the neighbouring land, must have been sinking to the \r\namount of their thickness--to several thousand feet--before that \r\nlater sinking which enabled several hundred feet of millstone grit to \r\nbe laid down on the top of the limestone.\r\n\r\nThis millstone grit is a new and a very remarkable element in our \r\nstrange story.  From Derby to Northumberland it forms vast and lofty \r\nmoors, capping, as at Whernside and Penygent, the highest limestone \r\nhills with its hard, rough, barren, and unfossiliferous strata.  \r\nWherever it is found, it lies on the top of the \"mountain,\" or \r\ncarboniferous limestone.  Almost everywhere, where coal is found in \r\nEngland, it lies on the millstone grit.  I speak roughly, for fear of \r\nconfusing my readers with details.  The three deposits pass more or \r\nless, in many places, into each other:  but always in the order of \r\nmountain limestone below, millstone grit on it, and coal on that \r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNow what does its presence prove?  What but this?  That after the \r\ngreat coral reefs which spread over Somersetshire and South Wales, \r\naround the present estuary of the Severn,--and those, once perhaps \r\njoined to them, which spread from Derby to Berwick, with a western \r\nbranch through North-east Wales,--were laid down--after all this, I \r\nsay, some change took place in the sea-bottom, and brought down on \r\nthe reefs of coral sheets of sand, which killed the corals and buried \r\nthem in grit.  Does any reader wish for proof of this?  Let him \r\nexamine the \"cherty,\" or flinty, beds which so often appear where the \r\nbottom of the millstone grit is passing into the top of the mountain \r\nlimestone--the beds, to give an instance, which are now quarried on \r\nthe top of the Halkin Mountain in Flintshire, for chert, which is \r\nsent to Staffordshire to be ground down for the manufacture of china.  \r\nHe will find layers in those beds, of several feet in thickness, as \r\nhard as flint, but as porous as sponge.  On examining their cavities \r\nhe will find them to be simply hollow casts of innumerable joints of \r\nCrinoids, so exquisitely preserved, even to their most delicate \r\nmarkings, that it is plain they were never washed about upon a beach, \r\nbut have grown where, or nearly where, they lie.  What then, has \r\nhappened to them?  They have been killed by the sand.  The soft parts \r\nof the animals have decayed, letting the 140,000 joints (more or \r\nless) belonging to each animal fall into a heap, and be imbedded in \r\nthe growing sand-rock; and then, it may be long years after, water \r\nfiltering through the porous sand has removed the lime of which the \r\njoints were made, and left their perfect casts behind.\r\n\r\nSo much for the millstone grits.  How long the deposition of sand \r\nwent on, how long after it that second deposition of sands took \r\nplace, which goes by the name of the \"gannister,\" or lower coal-\r\nmeasures, we cannot tell.  But it is clear, at least, that parts of \r\nthat ancient sea were filling up and becoming dry land.  For coal, or \r\nfossilised vegetable matter, becomes more and more common as we \r\nascend in the series of beds; till at last, in the upper coal-\r\nmeasures, the enormous wealth of vegetation which grew, much of it, \r\nwhere it is now found, prove the existence of some such sheets of \r\nfertile and forest-clad lowland as I described in my last paper.\r\n\r\nThousands of feet of rich coral reef; thousands of feet of barren \r\nsands; then thousands of feet of rich alluvial forest--and all these \r\nsliding into each other, if not in one place, then in another, \r\nwithout violent break or change; this is the story which the lime in \r\nthe mortar and the coal on the fire, between the two, reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.  THE SLATES ON THE ROOF\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slates on the roof should be, when rightly understood, a pleasant \r\nsubject for contemplation to the dweller in a town.  I do not ask him \r\nto imitate the boy who, cliff-bred from his youth, used to spend \r\nstolen hours on the house-top, with his back against a chimney-stalk, \r\ntransfiguring in his imagination the roof-slopes into mountain-sides, \r\nthe slates into sheets of rock, the cats into lions, and the sparrows \r\ninto eagles.  I only wish that he should--at least after reading this \r\npaper--let the slates on the roof carry him back in fancy to the \r\nmountains whence they came; perhaps to pleasant trips to the lakes \r\nand hills of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and North Wales; and to \r\nrecognise--as he will do if he have intellect as well as fancy--how \r\nbeautiful and how curious an object is a common slate.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, not only for the compactness and delicacy of its texture, \r\nand for the regularity and smoothness of its surface, but still more \r\nfor its colour.  Whether merely warm grey, as when dry, or bright \r\npurple, as when wet, the colour of the English slate well justifies \r\nMr. Ruskin's saying, that wherever there is a brick wall and a slate \r\nroof there need be no want of rich colour in an English landscape.  \r\nBut most beautiful is the hue of slate, when, shining wet in the \r\nsunshine after a summer shower, its blue is brought out in rich \r\ncontrast by golden spots of circular lichen, whose spores, I presume, \r\nhave travelled with it off its native mountains.  Then, indeed, it \r\nreminds the voyager of a sight which it almost rivals in brilliancy--\r\nof the sapphire of the deep ocean, brought out into blazing intensity \r\nby the contrast of the golden patches of floating gulf-weed beneath \r\nthe tropic sun.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, I say, is the slate; and curious likewise, nay, venerable; \r\na most ancient and elaborate work of God, which has lasted long \r\nenough, and endured enough likewise, to bring out in it whatsoever \r\nlatent capabilities of strength and usefulness might lie hid in it; \r\nwhich has literally been--as far as such words can apply to a thing \r\ninanimate--\r\n\r\n\r\nHeated hot with burning fears,\r\nAnd bathed in baths of hissing tears,\r\nAnd battered by the strokes of doom\r\nTo shape and use.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was at first naught but an ugly lump of soft and shapeless \r\nooze.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the slates to me are as a parable, on which I will not \r\nenlarge, but will leave each reader to interpret it for himself.  I \r\nshall confine myself now to proofs that slate is hardened mud, and to \r\nhints as to how it assumed its present form.\r\n\r\nThat slate may have been once mud, is made probable by the simple \r\nfact that it can be turned into mud again.  If you grind tip slate, \r\nand then analyse it, you will find its mineral constituents to be \r\nexactly those of a fine, rich, and tenacious clay.  The slate \r\ndistricts (at least in Snowdon) carry such a rich clay on them, \r\nwherever it is not masked by the ruins of other rocks.  At \r\nIlfracombe, in North Devon, the passage from slate below to clay \r\nabove, may be clearly seen.  Wherever the top of the slate beds, and \r\nthe soil upon it, is laid bare, the black layers of slate may be seen \r\ngradually melting--if I may use the word--under the influence of rain \r\nand frost, into a rich tenacious clay, which is now not black, like \r\nits parent slate, but red, from the oxidation of the iron which it \r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nBut, granting this, how did the first change take place?\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed, at starting, that time enough has elapsed, and \r\nevents enough have happened, since our supposed mud began first to \r\nbecome slate, to allow of many and strange transformations.  For \r\nthese slates are found in the oldest beds of rocks, save one series, \r\nin the known world; and it is notorious that the older and lower the \r\nbeds in which the slates are found, the better, that is, the more \r\nperfectly elaborate, is the slate.  The best slates of Snowdon--I \r\nmust confine myself to the district which I know personally--are \r\nfound in the so-called \"Cambrian\" beds.  Below these beds but one \r\nseries of beds is as yet known in the world, called the \"Laurentian.\"  \r\nThey occur, to a thickness of some eighty thousand feet, in Labrador, \r\nCanada, and the Adirondack mountains of New York:  but their \r\nrepresentatives in Europe are, as far as is known only to be found in \r\nthe north-west highlands of Scotland, and in the island of Lewis, \r\nwhich consists entirely of them.  And it is to be remembered, as a \r\nproof of their inconceivable antiquity, that they have been upheaved \r\nand shifted long before the Cambrian rocks were laid down \r\n\"unconformably\" on their worn and broken edges.\r\n\r\nAbove the \"Cambrian\" slates--whether the lower and older ones of \r\nPenrhyn and Llanberris, which are the same--one slate mountain being \r\nworked at both sides in two opposite valleys--or the upper and newer \r\nslates of Tremadoc, lie other and newer slate-bearing beds of \r\ninferior quality, and belonging to a yet newer world, the \"Silurian.\"  \r\nTo them belong the Llandeilo flags and slates of Wales, and the \r\nSkiddaw slates of Cumberland, amid beds abounding in extinct fossil \r\nforms.  Fossil shells are found, it is true, in the upper Cambrian \r\nbeds.  In the lower they have all but disappeared.  Whether their \r\ntraces have been obliterated by heat and pressure, and chemical \r\naction, during long ages; or whether, in these lower beds, we are \r\nactually reaching that \"Primordial Zone\" conceived of by M. Barrande, \r\nnamely, rocks which existed before living things had begun to people \r\nthis planet, is a question not yet answered.  I believe the former \r\ntheory to be the true one.  That there was life, in the sea at least, \r\neven before the oldest Cambrian rocks were laid down, is proved by \r\nthe discovery of the now famous fossil, the Eozoon, in the Laurentian \r\nlimestones, which seems to have grown layer after layer, and to have \r\nformed reefs of limestone as do the living coral-building polypes.  \r\nWe know no more as yet.  But all that we do know points downwards, \r\ndownwards still, warning us that we must dig deeper than we have dug \r\nas yet, before we reach the graves of the first living things.\r\n\r\nLet this suffice at present for the Cambrian and Laurentian rocks.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian rocks, lower and upper, which in these islands have \r\ntheir chief development in Wales, and which are nearly thirty-eight \r\nthousand feet thick; and the Devonian or Old Red sandstone beds, \r\nwhich in the Fans of Brecon and Carmarthenshire attain a thickness of \r\nten thousand feet, must be passed through in an upward direction \r\nbefore we reach the bottom of that Carboniferous Limestone of which I \r\nspoke in my last paper.  We thus find on the Cambrian rocks forty-\r\nfive thousand feet at least of newer rocks, in several cases lying \r\nunconformably on each other, showing thereby that the lower beds had \r\nbeen upheaved, and their edges worn off on a sea-shore, ere the upper \r\nwere laid down on them; and throughout this vast thickness of rocks, \r\nthe remains of hundreds of forms of animals, corals, shells, fish, \r\nolder forms dying out in the newer rocks, and new ones taking their \r\nplaces in a steady succession of ever-varying forms, till those in \r\nthe upper beds have become unlike those in the lower, and all are \r\nfrom the beginning more or less unlike any existing now on earth.  \r\nWhole families, indeed, disappear entirely, like the Trilobites, \r\nwhich seem to have swarmed in the Silurian seas, holding the same \r\nplace there as crabs and shrimps do in our modern seas.  They vanish \r\nafter the period of the coal, and their place is taken by an allied \r\nfamily of Crustaceans, of which only one form (as far as I am aware) \r\nlingers now on earth, namely, the \"King Crab,\" or Limulus, of the \r\nIndian Seas, a well-known animal, of which specimens may sometimes be \r\nseen alive in English aquaria.  So perished in the lapse of those \r\nsame ages, the armour-plated or \"Ganoid\" fish which Hugh Miller made \r\nso justly famous--and which made him so justly famous in return--\r\nappearing first in the upper Silurian beds, and abounding in vast \r\nvariety of strange forms in the old Red Sandstone, but gradually \r\ndisappearing from the waters of the world, till their only \r\nrepresentatives, as far as known, are the Lepidostei, or \"Bony \r\nPikes,\" of North America; the Polypteri of the Nile and Senegal; the \r\nLepidosirens of the African lakes and Western rivers; the Ceratodus \r\nor Barramundi of Queensland (the two latter of which approach \r\nAmphibians), and one or two more fantastic forms, either rudimentary \r\nor degraded, which have lasted on here and there in isolated stations \r\nthrough long ages, comparatively unchanged while all the world is \r\nchanged around them, and their own kindred, buried like the fossil \r\nCeratodus of the Trias beneath thousands of feet of ancient rock, \r\namong creatures the likes whereof are not to be found now on earth.  \r\nAnd these are but two examples out of hundreds of the vast changes \r\nwhich have taken place in the animal life of the globe, between the \r\nlaying down of the Cambrian slates and the present time.\r\n\r\nSurely--and it is to this conclusion I have been tending throughout a \r\nseemingly wandering paragraph--surely there has been time enough \r\nduring all those ages for clay to change into slate.\r\n\r\nAnd how were they changed?\r\n\r\nI think I cannot teach my readers this more simply than by asking \r\nthem first to buy Sheet No. LXXVIII. S.E. (Bangor) of the Snowdon \r\ndistrict of the Government Geological Survey, which may be ordered at \r\nany good stationer's, price 3s.; and study it with me.  He will see \r\ndown the right-hand margin interpretations of the different colours \r\nwhich mark the different beds, beginning with the youngest (alluvium) \r\natop, and going down through Carboniferous Limestone and Sandstone, \r\nUpper Silurian, Lower Silurian, Cambrian, and below them certain \r\nrocks marked of different shades of red, which signify rocks either \r\naltered by heat, or poured out of old volcanic vents.  He will next \r\nsee that the map is covered with a labyrinth of red patches and \r\ncurved lines, signifying the outcrop or appearance at the surface of \r\nthese volcanic beds.  They lie at every conceivable slope; and the \r\nhills and valleys have been scooped out by rain and ice into every \r\nconceivable slope likewise.  Wherefore we see, here a broad patch of \r\nred, where the back of a sheet of Lava, Porphyry, Greenstone, or what \r\nnot is exposed; there a narrow line curving often with the curve of \r\nthe hill-side, where only the edge of a similar sheet is exposed; and \r\nevery possible variety of shape and attitude between these two.  He \r\nwill see also large spaces covered with little coloured dots, which \r\nsignify (as he will find at the margin) beds of volcanic ash.  If he \r\nlook below the little coloured squares on the margin, he will see \r\nfigures marking the strike, or direction of the inclination of the \r\nbeds--inclined, vertical, horizontal, contorted; that the white lines \r\nin the map signify faults, i.e. shifts in the strata; the gold lines, \r\nlodes of metal--the latter of which I should advise him strongly, in \r\nthis district at least, not to meddle with:  but to button up his \r\npockets, and to put into the fire, in wholesome fear of his own \r\nweakness and ignorance, any puffs of mining companies which may be \r\nsent him--as one or two have probably been sent him already.\r\n\r\nFurnished with which keys to the map, let him begin to con it over, \r\nsure that there is if not an order, still a grand meaning in all its \r\nseeming confusion; and let him, if he be a courteous and grateful \r\nperson, return due thanks to Professor Ramsay for having found it all \r\nout; not without wondering, as I have often wondered, how even \r\nProfessor Ramsay's acuteness and industry could find it all out.\r\n\r\nWhen my reader has studied awhile the confusion--for it is a true \r\nconfusion--of the different beds, he will ask, or at least have a \r\nright to ask, what known process of nature can have produced it?  How \r\nhave these various volcanic rocks, which he sees marked as Felspathic \r\nTraps, Quartz Porphyries, Greenstones, and so forth, got intermingled \r\nwith beds which he is told to believe are volcanic ashes, and those \r\nagain with fossil-bearing Silurian beds and Cambrian slates, which he \r\nis told to believe were deposited under water?  And his puzzle will \r\nnot be lessened when he is told that, in some cases, as in that of \r\nthe summit of Snowdon, these very volcanic ashes contain fossil \r\nshells.\r\n\r\nThe best answer I can give is to ask him to use his imagination, or \r\nhis common sense; and to picture to himself what must go on in the \r\ncase of a submarine eruption, such as broke out off the coast of \r\nIceland in 1783 and 1830, off the Azores in 1811, and in our day in \r\nmore than one spot in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nA main bore or vent--or more than one--opens itself between the \r\nbottom of the sea and the nether fires.  From each rushes an enormous \r\njet of high-pressure steam and other gases, which boils up through \r\nthe sea, and forms a cloud above; that cloud descends again in heavy \r\nrain, and gives out often true lightning from its under side.\r\n\r\nBut it does more.  It acts as a true steam-gun, hurling into the air \r\nfragments of cold rock rasped off from the sides of the bore, and \r\nfragments also of melted lava, and clouds of dust, which fall again \r\ninto the sea, and form there beds either of fine mud or of breccia--\r\nthat is, fragments of stone embedded in paste.  This, the reader will \r\nunderstand, is no fancy sketch, as far as I am concerned.  I have \r\nsteamed into craters sawn through by the sea, and showing sections of \r\nbeds of ash dipping outwards and under the sea, and in them boulders \r\nand pebbles of every size, which had been hurled out of the crater; \r\nand in them also veins of hardened lava, which had burrowed out \r\nthrough the soft ashes of the cone.  Of those lava veins I will speak \r\npresently.  What I want the reader to think of now is the immense \r\nquantity of ash which the steam-mitrailleuse hurls to so vast a \r\nheight into the air, that it is often drifted many miles down to \r\nleeward.  To give two instances:  The jet of steam from Vesuvius, in \r\nthe eruption of 1822, rose more than four miles into the air; the jet \r\nfrom the Souffriere of St. Vincent in the West Indies, in 1812, \r\nprobably rose higher; certainly it met the N.E. trade-wind, for it \r\npoured down a layer of ashes, several inches thick, not only on St. \r\nVincent itself, but on Barbadoes, eighty miles to windward, and \r\ntherefore on all the sea between.  Now let us consider what that \r\nrepresents--a layer of fine mud, laid down at the bottom of the \r\nocean, several inches thick, eighty miles at least long, and twenty \r\nmiles perhaps broad, by a single eruption.  Suppose that hardened in \r\nlong ages (as it would be under pressure) into a bed of fine grained \r\nFelstone, or volcanic ash; and we can understand how the ash-beds of \r\nSnowdonia--which may be traced some of them for many square miles--\r\nwere laid down at the bottom of an ancient sea.\r\n\r\nBut now about the lavas or true volcanic rocks, which are painted (as \r\nis usual in geological maps) red.  Let us go down to the bottom of \r\nthe sea, and build up our volcano towards the surface.\r\n\r\nFirst, as I said, the subterranean steam would blast a bore.  The \r\ndust and stones, rasped and blasted out of that hole would be spread \r\nabout the sea-bottom as an ash-bed sloping away round the hole; then \r\nthe molten lava would rise in the bore, and flow out over the ashes \r\nand the sea-bottom--perhaps in one direction, perhaps all round.  \r\nThen, usually, the volcano, having vented itself, would be quieter \r\nfor a time, till the heat accumulated below, and more ash was blasted \r\nout, making a second ash-bed; and then would follow a second lava \r\nflow.  Thus are produced the alternate beds of lava and ash which are \r\nso common.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that at this point the volcano was exhausted, and lay \r\nquiet for a few hundred years, or more.  If there was any land near, \r\nfrom which mud and sand were washed down, we might have layers on \r\nlayers of sediment deposited, with live shells, etc., living in them, \r\nwhich would be converted into fossils when they died; and so we \r\nshould have fossiliferous beds over the ashes and lavas.  Indeed, \r\nshells might live and thrive in the ash-mud itself, when it cooled, \r\nand the sea grew quiet, as they have lived and thriven in Snowdonia.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that after these sedimentary beds are laid down by water, \r\nthe volcano breaks out again--what would happen?\r\n\r\nMany things:  specially this, which has often happened already.\r\n\r\nThe lava, kept down by the weight of these new rocks, searches for \r\nthe point of least resistance, and finds it in a more horizontal \r\ndirection.  It burrows out through the softer ash-beds, and between \r\nthe sedimentary beds, spreading itself along horizontally.  This \r\nprocess accounts for the very puzzling, though very common case in \r\nSnowdon and elsewhere, in which we find lavas interstratified with \r\nrocks which are plainly older than those lavas.  Perhaps when that is \r\ndone the volcano has got rid of all its lava, and is quiet.  But if \r\nnot, sooner or later, it bores up through the new sedimentary rocks, \r\nfaulting them by earthquake shocks till it gets free vent, and begins \r\nits layers of alternate ash and lava once more.\r\n\r\nAnd consider this fact also:  If near the first (as often happens) \r\nthere is another volcano, the lava from one may run over the lava \r\nfrom the other, and we may have two lavas of different materials \r\noverlying each other, which have come from different directions.  The \r\nashes blown out of the two craters may mingle also, and so, in the \r\ncourse of ages, the result may be such a confusion of ashes, lavas, \r\nand sedimentary rocks as we find throughout most mountain ranges in \r\nSnowdon, in the Lake mountains, in the Auvergne in France, in Sicily \r\nround Etna, in Italy round Vesuvius, and in so many West Indian \r\nIslands; the last confusion of which is very likely to be this:\r\n\r\nThat when the volcano has succeeded--as it did in the case of Sabrina \r\nIsland off the Azores in 1811, and as it did, perhaps often, in \r\nSnowdonia--in piling up an ash cone some hundred feet out of the sea; \r\nthat--as has happened to Sabrina Island--the cone is sunk again by \r\nearthquakes, and gnawn down at the same time by the sea-waves, till \r\nnothing is left but a shoal under water.  But where have all its vast \r\nheaps of ashes gone?  To be spread about over the bottom of the sea, \r\nto mingle with the mud already there, and so make beds of which, like \r\nmany in Snowdon, we cannot say whether they are of volcanic or of \r\nmarine origin, because they are of both.\r\n\r\nBut what has all this to do with the slates?\r\n\r\nI shall not be surprised if my readers ask that question two or three \r\ntimes during this paper.  But they must be kind enough to let me tell \r\nmy story my own way.  The slates were not made in a day, and I fear \r\nthey cannot be explained in an hour:  unless we begin carefully at \r\nthe beginning in order to end at the end.  Let me first make my \r\nreaders clearly understand that all our slate-bearing mountains, and \r\nmost also of the non-slate-bearing ones likewise, are formed after \r\nthe fashion which I have described, namely, beneath the sea.  I do \r\nnot say that there may not have been, again, and again, ash-cones \r\nrising above the surface of the waves.  But if so, they were washed \r\naway, again and again, ages before the land assumed anything of its \r\npresent shape; ages before the beds were twisted and upheaved as they \r\nare now.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore I beg my readers to put out of their minds once and for \r\nall the fancy that in any known part of these islands craters are to \r\nbe still seen, such as exist in Etna, or Vesuvius, or other volcanoes \r\nnow at work in the open air.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to insist on this, because many people hearing that \r\ncertain mountains are volcanic, conclude--and very naturally and \r\nharmlessly--that the circular lakes about their tops are true \r\ncraters.  I have been told, for instance, that that wonderful little \r\nblue Glas Llyn, under the highest cliff of Snowdon, is the old crater \r\nof the mountain; and I have heard people insist that a similar lake, \r\nof almost equal grandeur, in the south side of Cader Idris, is a \r\ncrater likewise.\r\n\r\nBut the fact is not so.  Any one acquainted with recent craters would \r\nsee at once that Glas Llyn is not an ancient one; and I am not \r\nsurprised to find the Government geologists declaring that the Llyn \r\non Cader Idris is not one either.  The fact is, that the crater, or \r\nrather the place where the crater has been, in ancient volcanoes of \r\nthis kind, is probably now covered by one of the innumerable bosses \r\nof lava.\r\n\r\nFor, as an eruption ceases, the melted lava cools in the vents, and \r\nhardens; usually into lava infinitely harder than the ash-cone round \r\nit; and this, when the ash-cone is washed off, remains as the highest \r\npart of the hill, as in the Mont Dore and the Cantal in France, and \r\nin several extinct volcanoes in the Antilles.  Of course the lava \r\nmust have been poured out, and the ashes blown out from some vents or \r\nother, connected with the nether world of fire; probably from many \r\nsuccessive vents.  For in volcanoes, when one vent is choked, another \r\nis wont to open at some fresh point of least resistance among the \r\noverlying rocks.  But where are these vents?  Buried deep under \r\nsuccessive eruptions, shifted probably from their places by \r\nsuccessive upheavings and dislocations; and if we wanted to find them \r\nwe should have to quarry the mountain range all over, a mile deep, \r\nbefore we hit upon here and there a tap-root of ancient lava, \r\nconnecting the upper and the nether worlds.  There are such tap-\r\nroots, probably, under each of our British mountain ranges.  But \r\nSnowdon, certainly, does not owe its shape to the fact of one of \r\nthese old fire vents being under it.  It owes its shape simply to the \r\naccident of some of the beds toward the summit being especially hard, \r\nand thus able to stand the wear and tear of sea-wave, ice, and rain.  \r\nIts lakes have been formed quite regardless of the lie of the rocks, \r\nthough not regardless of their relative hardness.  But what forces \r\nscooped them out--whether they were originally holes left in the \r\nground by earthquakes, and deepened since by rain and rivers, or \r\nwhether they were scooped out by ice, or by any other means, is a \r\nquestion on which the best geologists are yet undecided--decided only \r\non this--that craters they are not.\r\n\r\nAs for the enormous changes which have taken place in the outline of \r\nthe whole of the mountains, since first their strata were laid down \r\nat the bottom of the sea:  I shall give facts enough, before this \r\npaper is done, to enable readers to judge of them for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe reader will now ask, naturally enough, how such a heap of beds as \r\nI have described can take the shape of mountains like Snowdon.\r\n\r\nLook at any sea cliff in which the strata are twisted and set on \r\nslope.  There are hundreds of such in these isles.  The beds must \r\nhave been at one time straight and horizontal.  But it is equally \r\nclear that they have been folded by being squeezed laterally.  At \r\nleast, that is the simplest explanation, as may be proved by \r\nexperiment.  Take a number of pieces of cloth, or any such stuff; lay \r\nthem on each other and then squeeze them together at each end.  They \r\nwill arrange themselves in folds, just as the beds of the cliff have \r\ndone.  And if, instead of cloth, you take some more brittle matter, \r\nyou will find that, as you squeeze on, these folds will tend to snap \r\nat the points of greatest tension or stretching, which will be of \r\ncourse at the anticlinal and synclinal lines--in plain English, the \r\ntops and bottoms of the folds.  Thus cracks will be formed; and if \r\nthe pressure goes on, the ends of the layers will shift against each \r\nother in the line of those cracks, forming faults like those so \r\ncommon in rocks.\r\n\r\nBut again, suppose that instead of squeezing these broken and folded \r\nlines together any more, you took off the pressure right and left, \r\nand pressed them upwards from below, by a mimic earthquake.  They \r\nwould rise; and as they rose leave open space between them.  Now if \r\nyou could contrive to squeeze into them from below a paste, which \r\nwould harden in the cracks and between the layers, and so keep them \r\npermanently apart, you would make them into a fair likeness of an \r\naverage mountain range--a mess--if I may make use of a plain old \r\nword--of rocks which have, by alternate contraction and expansion, \r\nhelped in the latter case by the injection of molten lava, been \r\nthrust about as they are in most mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThat such a contraction and expansion goes on in the crust of the \r\nearth is evident; for here are the palpable effects of it.  And the \r\nsimplest general cause which I can give for it is this:  That things \r\nexpand as they are heated, and contract as they are cooled.\r\n\r\nNow I am not learned enough--and were I, I have not time--to enter \r\ninto the various theories which philosophers have put forward, to \r\naccount for these grand phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable, perhaps, and the most probable, is the theory of \r\nM. Elie de Beaumont, which is, in a few words, this:\r\n\r\nThat this earth, like all the planets, must have been once in a state \r\nof intense heat throughout, as its mass inside is probably now.\r\n\r\nThat it must be cooling, and giving off its heat into space.\r\n\r\nThat, therefore, as it cools, its crust must contract.\r\n\r\nThat, therefore, in contracting, wrinkles (for the loftiest mountain \r\nchains are nothing but tiny wrinkles, compared with the whole mass of \r\nthe earth), wrinkles, I say, must form on its surface from time to \r\ntime.  And that the mountain chains are these wrinkles.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, we may safely say this.  That wherever the \r\ninternal heat of the earth tends (as in the case of volcanoes) \r\ntowards a particular spot, that spot must expand, and swell up, \r\nbulging the rocks out, and probably cracking them, and inserting \r\nmelting lava into those cracks from below.  On the other hand, if the \r\ninternal heat leaves that spot again, and it cools, then it must \r\ncontract more or less, in falling inward toward the centre of the \r\nearth; and so the beds must be crumpled, and crushed, and shifted \r\nagainst each other still more, as those of our mountains have been.\r\n\r\nBut here may arise, in some of my readers' minds, a reasonable \r\nquestion--If these upheaved beds were once horizontal, should we not \r\nbe likely to find them, in some places, horizontal still?\r\n\r\nA reasonable question, and one which admits of a full answer.\r\n\r\nThey know, of course, that there has been a gradual, but steady, \r\nchange in the animals of this planet; and that the relative age of \r\nbeds can, on the strength of that known change, be determined \r\ngenerally by the fossils, usually shells, peculiar to them:  so that \r\nif we find the same fashion of shells, and still more the same \r\nspecies of shells, in two beds in different quarters of the world, \r\nthen we have a right to say--These beds were laid down at least about \r\nthe same time.  That is a general rule among all geologists, and not \r\nto be gainsaid.\r\n\r\nNow I think I may say, that, granting that we can recognise a bed by \r\nits fossils, there are few or no beds which are found in one place \r\nupheaved, broken, and altered by heat, which are not found in some \r\nother place still horizontal, unbroken, unaltered, and more or less \r\nas they were at first.\r\n\r\nFrom the most recent beds; from the upheaved coral-rocks of the West \r\nIndies, and the upheaved and faulted boulder clay and chalk of the \r\nIsle of Moen in Denmark--downwards through all the strata, down to \r\nthat very ancient one in which the best slates are found, this rule, \r\nI believe, stands true.\r\n\r\nIt stands true, certainly, of the ancient Silurian rocks of Wales, \r\nCumberland, Ireland, and Scotland.\r\n\r\nFor, throughout great tracts of Russia, and in parts of Norway and \r\nSweden, Sir Roderick Murchison discovered our own Silurian beds, \r\nrecognisable from their peculiar fossils.  But in what state?  Not \r\ncontracted, upheaved, and hardened to slates and grits, as they are \r\nin Wales and elsewhere:  but horizontal, unbroken, and still soft, \r\nbecause undisturbed by volcanic rooks and earthquakes.  At the bottom \r\nof them all, near Petersburg, Sir Roderick found a shale of dried mud \r\n(to quote his own words), \"so soft and incoherent that it is even \r\nused by sculptors for modelling, although it underlies the great mass \r\nof fossil-bearing Silurian rocks, and is, therefore, of the same age \r\nas the lower crystalline hard slates of North Wales.  So entirely \r\nhave most of these eldest rocks in Russia been exempted from the \r\ninfluence of change, throughout those enormous periods which have \r\npassed away since their accumulation.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the many discoveries which science owes to that illustrious \r\nveteran, I know none more valuable for its bearing on the whole \r\nquestion of the making of the earth-crust, than this one magnificent \r\nfact.\r\n\r\nBut what a contrast between these Scandinavian and Russian rocks and \r\nthose of Britain!  Never exceeding, in Scandinavia, a thousand feet \r\nin thickness, and lying usually horizontal, as they were first laid \r\ndown, they are swelled in Britain to a thickness of thirty thousand \r\nfeet, by intruded lavas and ashes; snapt, turned, set on end at every \r\nconceivable angle; shifted against each other to such an extent, \r\nthat, to give a single instance, in the Vale of Gwynnant, under \r\nSnowdon, an immense wedge of porphyry has been thrust up, in what is \r\nnow the bottom of the valley, between rocks far newer than it, on one \r\nside to a height of eight hundred, on the other to a height of \r\neighteen hundred feet--half the present height of Snowdon.  Nay, the \r\nvery slate beds of Snowdonia have not forced their way up from under \r\nthe mountain--without long and fearful struggles.  They are set in \r\nplaces upright on end, then horizontal again, then sunk in an \r\nopposite direction, then curled like sea-waves, then set nearly \r\nupright once more, and faulted through and through, six times, I \r\nbelieve, in the distance of a mile or two; they carry here and there \r\non their backs patches of newer beds, the rest of which has long \r\nvanished; and in their rise they have hurled back to the eastward, \r\nand set upright, what is now the whole western flank of Snowdon, a \r\nmass of rock which was then several times as thick as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe force which thus tortured them was probably exerted by the great \r\nmass of volcanic Quartz-porphyry, which rises from under them to the \r\nnorth-west, crossing the end of the lower lake of the Llanberris; and \r\nindeed the shifts and convulsions which have taken place between them \r\nand the Menai Straits are so vast that they can only be estimated by \r\nlooking at them on the section which may be found at the end of \r\nProfessor Ramsay's \"Geological Survey of North Wales.\"  But anyone \r\nwho will study that section, and use (as with the map) a little \r\nimagination and common sense, will see that between the heat of that \r\nPorphyry, which must have been poured out as a fluid mass as hot, \r\nprobably, as melted iron, and the pressure of it below, and of the \r\nSilurian beds above, the Cambrian mud-strata of Llanberris and \r\nPenrhyn quarries must have suffered enough to change them into \r\nsomething very different from mud, and, therefore, probably, into \r\nwhat they are now--namely, slate.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, we have got to the slates on the roof, and may \r\ndisport ourselves over them--like the cats.\r\n\r\nLook at any piece of slate.  All know that slate splits or cleaves \r\nfreely, in one direction only, into flat layers.  Now any one would \r\nsuppose at first sight, and fairly enough, that the flat surface--the \r\n\"plane of cleavage\"--was also the plane of bedding.  In simpler \r\nEnglish we should say--The mud which has hardened into the slate was \r\nlaid down horizontally; and therefore each slate is one of the little \r\nhorizontal beds of it, perhaps just what was laid down in a single \r\ntide.  We should have a right to do so, because that would be true of \r\nmost sedimentary rocks.  But it would not be true of slate.  The \r\nplane of bedding in slate has nothing to do with the plane of \r\ncleavage.  Or, more plainly, the mud of which the slate is made may \r\nhave been deposited at the sea-bottom at any angle to the plane of \r\ncleavage.  We may sometimes see the lines of the true bedding--the \r\nlines which were actually horizontal when the mud was laid down--in \r\nbits of slate, and find them sometimes perpendicular to, sometimes \r\ninclined to, and sometimes again coinciding with the plane of \r\ncleavage, which they have evidently acquired long after.\r\n\r\nNay, more.  These parallel planes of cleavage, at each of which the \r\nslate splits freely, will run through a whole mountain at the same \r\nangle, though the beds through which they run may be tilted at \r\ndifferent angles, and twisted into curves.\r\n\r\nNow what has made this change in the rook?  We do not exactly know.  \r\nOne thing is clear, that the particles of the now solid rock have \r\nactually moved on themselves.  And this is proved by a very curious \r\nfact--which the reader, if he geologises about slate quarries much, \r\nmay see with his own eyes.  The fossils in the slate are often \r\ndistorted into quaint shapes, pulled out long if they lie along the \r\nplane of cleavage, or squeezed together, or doubled down on both \r\nsides, if they lie across the plane.  So that some force has been at \r\nwork which could actually change the shape of hard shells, very \r\nslowly, no doubt, else it would have snapped and crumbled them.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked what that force was, I do not know.  I should advise \r\nyoung geologists to read what Sir Henry de la Beche has said on it in \r\nhis admirable \"Geological Observer,\" pp. 706-725.  He will find \r\nthere, too, some remarks on that equally mysterious phenomena of \r\njointing, which you may see in almost all the older rocks; it is \r\ncommon in limestones.  All we can say is, that some force has gone \r\non, or may be even now going on, in the more ancient rocks, which is \r\nsimilar to that which produces single crystals; and similar, too, to \r\nthat which produced the jointed crystals of basalt, i.e. lava, at the \r\nGiant's Causeway, in Ireland, and Staffa, in the Hebrides.  Two \r\nphilosophers--Mr. Robert Were Fox and Mr. Robert Hunt--are of opinion \r\nthat the force which has determined the cleavage of slates may be \r\nthat of the electric currents, which (as is well known) run through \r\nthe crust of the earth.  Mr. Sharpe, I believe, attributes the \r\ncleavage to the mere mechanical pressure of enormous weights of rock, \r\nespecially where crushed by earthquakes.  Professor Rogers, again, \r\npoints out that as these slates may have been highly heated, thermal \r\nelectricity (i.e. electricity brought out by heat) may have acted on \r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne thing at least is clear.  That the best slates are found among \r\nancient lavas, and also in rocks which are faulted and tilted \r\nenormously, all which could not have happened without a \r\nproportionately enormous pressure, and therefore heat; and next, that \r\nthe best slates are invariably found in the oldest beds--that is, in \r\nthe beds which have had most time to endure the changes, whether \r\nmechanical or chemical, which have made the earth's surface what we \r\nsee it now.\r\n\r\nAnother startling fact the section of Snowdonia, and I believe of \r\nmost mountain chains in these islands, would prove--namely, that the \r\ncontour of the earth's surface, as we see it now, depends very \r\nlittle, certainly in mountains composed of these elder rocks upon the \r\nlie of the strata, or beds, but has been carved out by great forces, \r\nlong after those beds were not only laid down and hardened, but \r\nfaulted and tilted on end.  Snowdon itself is so remarkable an \r\ninstance of this fact that, as it is a mountain which every one in \r\nthese happy days of excursion-trains and steamers either has seen or \r\ncan see, I must say a few more words about it.\r\n\r\nAny one who saw that noble peak leaping high into the air, dominating \r\nall the country round, at least upon three sides, and was told that \r\nits summit consisted of beds much newer, not much older, than the \r\nslate-beds fifteen hundred feet down on its north-western flank--any \r\none, I say, would have the right at first sight, on hearing of \r\nearthquake faults and upheavals, to say--The peak of Snowdon has been \r\nupheaved to its present height above and out of the lower lands \r\naround.  But when he came to examine sections, he would find his \r\nreasonable guess utterly wrong.  Snowdon is no swelling up of the \r\nearth's crust.  The beds do not, as they would in that case, slope up \r\nto it.  They slope up from it, to the north-west in one direction, \r\nand the south-south-west in the other; and Snowdon is a mere \r\ninsignificant boss, left hanging on one slope of what was once an \r\nenormous trough, or valley, of strata far older than itself.  By \r\nrestoring these strata, in the direction of the angles, in which they \r\ncrop out, and vanish at the surface, it is found that to the north-\r\nwest--the direction of the Menai Straits--they must once have risen \r\nto a height of at least six or seven thousand feet; and more, by \r\nrestoring them, specially the ash-bed of Snowdon, towards the south-\r\neast--which can be done by the guidance of certain patches of it left \r\non other hills--it is found that south of Ffestiniog, where the \r\nCambrian rocks rise again to the surface, the south side of the \r\ntrough must have sloped upwards to a height of from fifteen to twenty \r\nthousand feet, whether at the bottom of the sea, or in the upper air, \r\nwe cannot tell.  But the fact is certain, that off the surface of \r\nWales, south of Ffestiniog a mass of solid rock as high as the Andes \r\nhas been worn down and carried bodily away; and that a few miles \r\nsouth again, the peak of Arran Mowddy, which is now not two thousand \r\nfeet high, was once--either under the sea or above it--nearer ten \r\nthousand feet.\r\n\r\nIf I am asked whither is all that enormous mass of rock--millions of \r\ntons--gone?  Where is it now?  I know not.  But if I dared to hazard \r\na guess, I should say it went to make the New Red sandstones of \r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe New Red sandstones must have come from somewhere.  The most \r\nlikely region for them to have come from is from North Wales, where, \r\nas we know, vast masses of gritty rock have been ground off, such as \r\nwould make fine sandstones if they had the chance.  So that many a \r\ngrain of sand in Chester walls was probably once blasted out of the \r\nbowels of the earth into the old Silurian sea, and after a few \r\nhundreds of thousands of years' repose in a Snowdonian ash-bed, was \r\nsent eastward to build the good old city and many a good town more.\r\n\r\nAnd the red marl--the great deposit of red marl which covers a wide \r\nregion of England--why should not it have come from the same quarter?  \r\nWhy should it not be simply the remains of the Snowdon Slate?  Mud \r\nthe slate was, and into mud it has returned.  Why not?  Some of the \r\nrichest red marl land I know, is, as I have said, actually being made \r\nnow, out of the black slates of Ilfracombe, wherever they are \r\nweathered by rain and air.  The chemical composition is the same.  \r\nThe difference in colour between black slate and red marl is caused \r\nsimply by the oxidation of the iron in the slate.\r\n\r\nAnd if my readers want a probable cause why the sandstones lie \r\nundermost, and the red marl uppermost--can they not find one for \r\nthemselves?  I do not say that it is the cause, but it is at least a \r\ncausa vera, one which would fully explain the fact, though it may be \r\nexplicable in other ways.  Think, then, or shall I think for my \r\nreaders?\r\n\r\nThen do they not see that when the Welsh mountains were ground down, \r\nthe Silurian strata, being uppermost, would be ground down first, and \r\nwould go to make the lower strata of the great New Red Sandstone \r\nLowland; and that being sandy, they would make the sandstones?  But \r\nwherever they were ground through, the Lower Cambrian slates would be \r\nlaid bare; and their remains, being washed away by the sea the last, \r\nwould be washed on to the top of the remains of the Silurians; and so \r\n(as in most cases) the remains of the older rock, when redeposited by \r\nwater, would lie on the remains of the younger rock.  And do they not \r\nsee that (if what I just said is true) these slates would grind up \r\ninto red marl, such as is seen over the west and south of Cheshire \r\nand Staffordshire and far away into Nottinghamshire?  The red marl \r\nmust almost certainly have been black slate somewhere, somewhen.  Why \r\nshould it not have been such in Snowdon?  And why should not the \r\nslates in the roof be the remnants of the very beds which are now the \r\nmarl in the fields?\r\n\r\nAnd thus I end my story of the slates in the roof, and these papers \r\non Town Geology.  I do so, well knowing how imperfect they are:  \r\nthough not, I believe, inaccurate.  They are, after all, merely \r\nsuggestive of the great amount that there is to be learnt about the \r\nface of the earth and how it got made, even by the townsman, who can \r\nescape into the country and exchange the world of man for the world \r\nof God, only, perhaps, on Sundays--if, alas! even then--or only once \r\na year by a trip in a steamer or an excursion train.  Little, indeed, \r\ncan he learn of the planet on which he lives.  Little in that \r\ndirection is given to him, and of him little shall be required.  But \r\nto him, for that very reason, all that can be given should be given; \r\nhe should have every facility for learning what he can about this \r\nearth, its composition, its capabilities; lest his intellect, crushed \r\nand fettered by that artificial drudgery which we for a time miscall \r\ncivilisation, should begin to fancy, as too many do already, that the \r\nworld is composed mainly of bricks and deal, and governed by acts of \r\nparliament.  If I shall have awakened any townsmen here and there to \r\nthink seriously of the complexity, the antiquity, the grandeur, the \r\ntrue poetry, of the commonest objects around them, even the stones \r\nbeneath their feet; if I shall have suggested to them the solemn \r\nthought that all these things, and they themselves still more, are \r\nordered by laws, utterly independent of man's will about them, man's \r\nbelief in them; if I shall at all have helped to open their eyes that \r\nthey may see, and their ears that they may hear, the great book which \r\nis free to all alike, to peasant as to peer, to men of business as to \r\nmen of science, even that great book of nature, which is, as Lord \r\nBacon said of old, the Word of God revealed in facts--then I shall \r\nhave a fresh reason for loving that science of geology, which has \r\nbeen my favourite study since I was a boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n{1}  See \"Nature,\" No.  XXV.
