The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may\r\nbe just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or\r\nperhaps—for the thing has happened again and again—there slowly unfolds\r\nbefore the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some\r\nnew variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the labellum, or\r\nsome subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and\r\nprofit blossom together on one delicate green spike, and, it may be,\r\neven immortality. For the new miracle of Nature may stand in need of a\r\nnew specific name, and what so convenient as that of its discoverer?\r\n“Johnsmithia”! There have been worse names.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made\r\nWinter-Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales—that hope,\r\nand also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest\r\ninterest to do in the world. He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual\r\nman, provided with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity,\r\nand not enough nervous energy to make him seek any exacting employments.\r\nHe might have collected stamps or coins, or translated Horace, or bound\r\nbooks, or invented new species of diatoms. But, as it happened, he grew\r\norchids, and had one ambitious little hothouse.\r\n\r\n“I have a fancy,” he said over his coffee, “that something is going to\r\nhappen to me to-day.” He spoke—as he moved and thought—slowly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t say _that_!” said his housekeeper—who was also his remote\r\ncousin. For “something happening” was a euphemism that meant only one\r\nthing to her.\r\n\r\n“You misunderstand me. I mean nothing unpleasant—though what I do mean I\r\nscarcely know.\r\n\r\n“To-day,” he continued after a pause, “Peters are going to sell a batch\r\nof plants from the Andamans and the Indies. I shall go up and see what\r\nthey have. It may be I shall buy something good, unawares. That may be\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nHe passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee.\r\n\r\n“Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told me of\r\nthe other day?” asked his cousin as she filled his cup.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast.\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever does happen to me,” he remarked presently, beginning to\r\nthink aloud. “I wonder why? Things enough happen to other people. There\r\nis Harvey. Only the other week, on Monday he picked up sixpence, on\r\nWednesday his chicks all had the staggers, on Friday his cousin came\r\nhome from Australia, and on Saturday he broke his ankle. What a whirl of\r\nexcitement!—compared to me.”\r\n\r\n“I think I would rather be without so much excitement,” said his\r\nhousekeeper. “It can’t be good for you.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s troublesome. Still—you see, nothing ever happens to me.\r\nWhen I was a little boy I never had accidents. I never fell in love as I\r\ngrew up. Never married—I wonder how it feels to have something happen to\r\nyou, something really remarkable.\r\n\r\n“That orchid-collector was only thirty-six—twenty years younger than\r\nmyself—when he died. And he had been married twice and divorced once; he\r\nhad had malarial fever four times, and once he broke his thigh. He\r\nkilled a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a poisoned dart. And in\r\nthe end he was killed by jungle-leeches. It must have all been very\r\ntroublesome, but then it must have been very interesting, you\r\nknow—except, perhaps, the leeches.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure it was not good for him,” said the lady, with conviction.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not.” And then Wedderburn looked at his watch. “Twenty-three\r\nminutes past eight. I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, so\r\nthat there is plenty of time. I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket—it\r\nis quite warm enough—and my grey felt hat and brown shoes. I suppose—”\r\n\r\nHe glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, and\r\nthen nervously at his cousin’s face.\r\n\r\n“I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to London,”\r\nshe said in a voice that admitted of no denial. “There’s all between\r\nhere and the station coming back.”\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he was in a state of mild excitement. He had made a\r\npurchase. It was rare that he could make up his mind quickly enough to\r\nbuy, but this time he had done so.\r\n\r\n“There are Vandas,” he said, “and a Dendrobe and some Palæonophis.” He\r\nsurveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup. They were laid\r\nout on the spotless table-cloth before him, and he was telling his\r\ncousin all about them as he slowly meandered through his dinner. It was\r\nhis custom to live all his visits to London over again in the evening\r\nfor her and his own entertainment.\r\n\r\n“I knew something would happen to-day. And I have bought all these. Some\r\nof them—some of them—I feel sure, do you know, that some of them will be\r\nremarkable. I don’t know how it is, but I feel just as sure as if some\r\none had told me that some of these will turn out remarkable.\r\n\r\n“That one”—he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome—“was not identified. It\r\nmay be a Palæonophis—or it may not. It may be a new species, or even a\r\nnew genus. And it was the last that poor Batten ever collected.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like the look of it,” said his housekeeper. “It’s such an ugly\r\nshape.”\r\n\r\n“To me it scarcely seems to have a shape.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like those things that stick out,” said his housekeeper.\r\n\r\n“It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“It looks,” said the housekeeper, “like a spider shamming dead.”\r\n\r\nWedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one side. “It\r\nis certainly not a pretty lump of stuff. But you can never judge of\r\nthese things from their dry appearance. It may turn out to be a very\r\nbeautiful orchid indeed. How busy I shall be to-morrow! I must see\r\nto-night just exactly what to do with these things, and to-morrow I\r\nshall set to work.\r\n\r\n“They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove swamp—I\r\nforget which,” he began again presently, “with one of these very orchids\r\ncrushed up under his body. He had been unwell for some days with some\r\nkind of native fever, and I suppose he fainted. These mangrove swamps\r\nare very unwholesome. Every drop of blood, they say, was taken out of\r\nhim by the jungle-leeches. It may be that very plant that cost him his\r\nlife to obtain.”\r\n\r\n“I think none the better of it for that.”\r\n\r\n“Men must work though women may weep,” said Wedderburn, with profound\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n“Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy being ill\r\nof fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine—if men were\r\nleft to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and quinine—and no one\r\nround you but horrible natives! They say the Andaman islanders are most\r\ndisgusting wretches—and, anyhow, they can scarcely make good nurses, not\r\nhaving the necessary training. And just for people in England to have\r\norchids!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy that\r\nkind of thing,” said Wedderburn. “Anyhow, the natives of his party were\r\nsufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until his\r\ncolleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the interior;\r\nthough they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had let it\r\nwither. And it makes these things more interesting.”\r\n\r\n“It makes them disgusting. I should be afraid of some of the malaria\r\nclinging to them. And just think, there has been a dead body lying\r\nacross that ugly thing! I never thought of that before. There! I declare\r\nI cannot eat another mouthful of dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the\r\nwindow-seat. I can see them just as well there.”\r\n\r\nThe next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy little\r\nhothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and all the\r\nother mysteries of the orchid cultivator. He considered he was having a\r\nwonderfully eventful time. In the evening he would talk about these new\r\norchids to his friends, and over and over again he reverted to his\r\nexpectation of something strange.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, but\r\npresently the strange orchid began to show signs of life. He was\r\ndelighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to see it\r\nat once, directly he made the discovery.\r\n\r\n“That is a bud,” he said, “and presently there will be a lot of leaves\r\nthere, and those little things coming out here are aërial rootlets.”\r\n\r\n“They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown. I\r\ndon’t like them,” said his housekeeper.\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. They look like fingers trying to get at you. I can’t help\r\nmy likes and dislikes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know for certain, but I don’t _think_ there are any orchids I\r\nknow that have aërial rootlets quite like that. It may be my fancy, of\r\ncourse. You see they are a little flattened at the ends.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like ’em,” said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and turning\r\naway. “I know it’s very silly of me—and I’m very sorry, particularly as\r\nyou like the thing so much. But I can’t help thinking of that corpse.”\r\n\r\n“But it may not be that particular plant. That was merely a guess of\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nHis housekeeper shrugged her shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow I don’t like it,” she said.\r\n\r\nWedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant. But that did\r\nnot prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this orchid\r\nin particular, whenever he felt inclined.\r\n\r\n“There are such queer things about orchids,” he said one day; “such\r\npossibilities of surprises. You know, Darwin studied their\r\nfertilisation, and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary\r\norchid-flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen\r\nfrom plant to plant. Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known\r\nthe flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that\r\nway. Some of the Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects known\r\nthat can possibly fertilise them, and some of them have never been found\r\nwith seed.”\r\n\r\n“But how do they form new plants?”\r\n\r\n“By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth. That is easily\r\nexplained. The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” he added, “_my_ orchid may be something extraordinary in\r\nthat way. If so, I shall study it. I have often thought of making\r\nresearches as Darwin did. But hitherto I have not found the time, or\r\nsomething else has happened to prevent it. The leaves are beginning to\r\nunfold now. I do wish you would come and see them!”\r\n\r\nBut she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the headache.\r\nShe had seen the plant once again, and the aërial rootlets, which were\r\nnow some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately reminded her\r\nof tentacles reaching out after something; and they got into her dreams,\r\ngrowing after her with incredible rapidity. So that she had settled to\r\nher entire satisfaction that she would not see that plant again, and\r\nWedderburn had to admire its leaves alone. They were of the ordinary\r\nbroad form, and a deep glossy green, with splashes and dots of deep red\r\ntowards the base. He knew of no other leaves quite like them. The plant\r\nwas placed on a low bench near the thermometer, and close by was a\r\nsimple arrangement by which a tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and\r\nkept the air steamy. And he spent his afternoons now with some\r\nregularity meditating on the approaching flowering of this strange\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAnd at last the great thing happened. Directly he entered the little\r\nglass house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great\r\n_Palæonophis Lowii_ hid the corner where his new darling stood. There\r\nwas a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that\r\noverpowered every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.\r\n\r\nDirectly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid. And,\r\nbehold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes of\r\nblossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded. He stopped\r\nbefore them in an ecstasy of admiration.\r\n\r\nThe flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals;\r\nthe heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, and a\r\nwonderful bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at\r\nonce that the genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable\r\nscent! How hot the place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe would see if the temperature was right. He made a step towards the\r\nthermometer. Suddenly everything appeared unsteady. The bricks on the\r\nfloor were dancing up and down. Then the white blossoms, the green\r\nleaves behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to sweep sideways, and\r\nthen in a curve upward.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their invariable\r\ncustom. But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.\r\n\r\n“He is worshipping that horrid orchid,” she told herself, and waited ten\r\nminutes. “His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him.”\r\n\r\nShe went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called his\r\nname. There was no reply. She noticed that the air was very close, and\r\nloaded with an intense perfume. Then she saw something lying on the\r\nbricks between the hot-water pipes.\r\n\r\nFor a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless.\r\n\r\nHe was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid. The\r\ntentacle-like aërial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but\r\nwere crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight with\r\ntheir ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.\r\n\r\nShe did not understand. Then she saw from under one of the exultant\r\ntentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.\r\n\r\nWith an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull him away\r\nfrom the leech-like suckers. She snapped two of these tentacles, and\r\ntheir sap dripped red.\r\n\r\nThen the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her head reel.\r\nHow they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and he and the white\r\ninflorescence swam about her. She felt she was fainting, knew she must\r\nnot. She left him and hastily opened the nearest door, and, after she\r\nhad panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had a brilliant\r\ninspiration. She caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the windows at\r\nthe end of the greenhouse. Then she re-entered. She tugged now with\r\nrenewed strength at Wedderburn’s motionless body, and brought the\r\nstrange orchid crashing to the floor. It still clung with the grimmest\r\ntenacity to its victim. In a frenzy, she lugged it and him into the open\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThen she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by one, and\r\nin another minute she had released him and was dragging him away from\r\nthe horror.\r\n\r\nHe was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches.\r\n\r\nThe odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the smashing of\r\nglass, and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with red-stained\r\nhands. For a moment he thought impossible things.\r\n\r\n“Bring some water!” she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies.\r\nWhen, with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found her\r\nweeping with excitement, and with Wedderburn’s head upon her knee,\r\nwiping the blood from his face.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter?” said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, and\r\nclosing them again at once.\r\n\r\n“Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr. Haddon at\r\nonce,” she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought the water; and\r\nadded, seeing he hesitated, “I will tell you all about it when you come\r\nback.”\r\n\r\nPresently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he was\r\ntroubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, “You\r\nfainted in the hothouse.”\r\n\r\n“And the orchid?”\r\n\r\n“I will see to that,” she said.\r\n\r\nWedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he had\r\nsuffered no very great injury. They gave him brandy mixed with some pink\r\nextract of meat, and carried him upstairs to bed. His housekeeper told\r\nher incredible story in fragments to Dr. Haddon. “Come to the\r\norchid-house and see,” she said.\r\n\r\nThe cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and the sickly\r\nperfume was almost dispelled. Most of the torn aërial rootlets lay\r\nalready withered amidst a number of dark stains upon the bricks. The\r\nstem of the inflorescence was broken by the fall of the plant, and the\r\nflowers were growing limp and brown at the edges of the petals. The\r\ndoctor stooped towards it, then saw that one of the aërial rootlets\r\nstill stirred feebly, and hesitated.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and\r\nputrescent. The door banged intermittingly in the morning breeze, and\r\nall the array of Wedderburn’s orchids was shrivelled and prostrate. But\r\nWedderburn himself was bright and garrulous upstairs in the story of his\r\nstrange adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ÆPYORNIS ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man with the scarred face leant over the table and looked at my\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n“Orchids?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“A few,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Cypripediums?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Chiefly,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Anything new?—I thought not. _I_ did these islands\r\ntwenty-five—twenty-seven years ago. If you find anything new here—well,\r\nit’s brand new. I didn’t leave much.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not a collector,” said I.\r\n\r\n“I was young then,” he went on. “Lord! how I used to fly round.” He\r\nseemed to take my measure. “I was in the East Indies two years, and in\r\nBrazil seven. Then I went to Madagascar.”\r\n\r\n“I know a few explorers by name,” I said anticipating a yarn. “Who did\r\nyou collect for?”\r\n\r\n“Dawsons. I wonder if you’ve heard the name of Butcher ever?”\r\n\r\n“Butcher—Butcher?” The name seemed vaguely present in my memory; then I\r\nrecalled _Butcher_ v. _Dawson_. “Why!” said I, “you are the man who sued\r\nthem for four years’ salary—got cast away on a desert island—”\r\n\r\n“Your servant,” said the man with the scar, bowing. “Funny case, wasn’t\r\nit? Here was me, making a little fortune on that island, doing nothing\r\nfor it neither, and them quite unable to give me notice. It often used\r\nto amuse me thinking over it while I was there. I did calculations of\r\nit—big—all over the blessed atoll in ornamental figuring.”\r\n\r\n“How did it happen?” said I. “I don’t rightly remember the case.”\r\n\r\n“Well—you’ve heard of the Æpyornis?”\r\n\r\n“Rather. Andrews was telling me of a new species he was working on only\r\na month or so ago. Just before I sailed. They’ve got a thigh bone, it\r\nseems, nearly a yard long. Monster the thing must have been!”\r\n\r\n“I believe you,” said the man with the scar. “It _was_ a monster.\r\nSinbad’s roc was just a legend of ’em. But when did they find these\r\nbones?”\r\n\r\n“Three or four years ago—’91 I fancy. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Why?—Because _I_ found ’em—Lord!—it’s nearly twenty years ago. If\r\nDawsons hadn’t been silly about that salary they might have made a\r\nperfect ring in ’em.—_I_ couldn’t help the infernal boat going adrift.”\r\n\r\nHe paused. “I suppose it’s the same place. A kind of swamp about ninety\r\nmiles north of Antananarivo. Do you happen to know? You have to go to it\r\nalong the coast by boats. You don’t happen to remember, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t. I fancy Andrews said something about a swamp.”\r\n\r\n“It must be the same. It’s on the east coast. And somehow there’s\r\nsomething in the water that keeps things from decaying. Like creosote it\r\nsmells. It reminded me of Trinidad. Did they get any more eggs? Some of\r\nthe eggs I found were a foot and a half long. The swamp goes circling\r\nround, you know, and cuts off this bit. It’s mostly salt, too. Well—What\r\na time I had of it! I found the things quite by accident. We went for\r\neggs, me and two native chaps, in one of those rum canoes all tied\r\ntogether, and found the bones at the same time. We had a tent and\r\nprovisions for four days, and we pitched on one of the firmer places. To\r\nthink of it brings that odd tarry smell back even now. It’s funny work.\r\nYou go probing into the mud with iron rods, you know. Usually the egg\r\ngets smashed. I wonder how long it is since these Æpyornises really\r\nlived. The missionaries say the natives have legends about when they\r\nwere alive, but I never heard any such stories myself.[1] But certainly\r\nthose eggs we got were as fresh as if they had been new-laid. Fresh!\r\nCarrying them down to the boat one of my nigger chaps dropped one on a\r\nrock and it smashed. How I lammed into the beggar! But sweet it was as\r\nif it was new-laid, not even smelly, and its mother dead these four\r\nhundred years perhaps. Said a centipede had bit him. However, I’m\r\ngetting off the straight with the story. It had taken us all day to dig\r\ninto the slush and get these eggs out unbroken, and we were all covered\r\nwith beastly black mud, and naturally I was cross. So far as I knew they\r\nwere the only eggs that had ever been got out not even cracked. I went\r\nafterwards to see the ones they have at the Natural History Museum in\r\nLondon: all of them were cracked and just stuck together like a mosaic,\r\nand bits missing. Mine were perfect, and I meant to blow them when I got\r\nback. Naturally I was annoyed at the silly devil dropping three hours’\r\nwork just on account of a centipede. I hit him about rather.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  No European is known to have seen a live Æpyornis, with the doubtful\r\n  exception of MacAndrew, who visited Madagascar in 1745. H. G. W.\r\n\r\nThe man with the scar took out a clay pipe. I placed my pouch before\r\nhim. He filled up absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\n“How about the others? Did you get those home? I don’t remember—”\r\n\r\n“That’s the queer part of the story. I had three others. Perfectly fresh\r\neggs. Well, we put ’em in the boat, and then I went up to the tent to\r\nmake some coffee, leaving my two heathens down by the beach—the one\r\nfooling about with his sting and the other helping him. It never\r\noccurred to me that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar\r\nposition I was in to pick a quarrel. But I suppose the centipede poison\r\nand the kicking I’d given him had upset the one—he was always a\r\ncantankerous sort—and he persuaded the other.\r\n\r\n“I remember I was sitting and smoking and boiling up the water over a\r\nspirit-lamp business I used to take on these expeditions. Incidentally I\r\nwas admiring the swamp under the sunset. All black and blood red it was,\r\nin streaks—a beautiful sight. And up beyond, the land rose grey and hazy\r\nto the hills, and the sky behind them red, like a furnace mouth. And\r\nfifty yards behind the back of me was these blessed heathen—quite\r\nregardless of the tranquil air of things—plotting to cut off with the\r\nboat and leave me all alone with three days’ provisions and a canvas\r\ntent, and nothing to drink whatsoever, beyond a little keg of water. I\r\nheard a kind of yelp behind me, and there they were in this canoe\r\naffair—it wasn’t properly a boat—and perhaps twenty yards from land. I\r\nrealised what was up in a moment. My gun was in the tent, and besides I\r\nhad no bullets—only duck shot. They knew that. But I had a little\r\nrevolver in my pocket and I pulled that out as I ran down to the beach.\r\n\r\n“‘Come back!’ says I, flourishing it.\r\n\r\n“They jabbered something at me, and the man that broke the egg jeered. I\r\naimed at the other—because he was unwounded and had the paddle, and I\r\nmissed. They laughed. However, I wasn’t beat. I knew I had to keep cool,\r\nand I tried him again and made him jump with the whang of it. The third\r\ntime I got his head, and over he went, and the paddle with him. It was a\r\nprecious lucky shot for a revolver. I reckon it was fifty yards. He went\r\nright under. I don’t know if he was shot, or simply stunned and drowned.\r\nThen I began to shout to the other chap to come back, but he huddled up\r\nin the canoe and refused to answer. So I fired out my revolver at him\r\nand never got near him.\r\n\r\n“I felt a precious fool, I can tell you. There I was on this rotten,\r\nblack beach, flat swamp all behind me, and the flat sea, cold after the\r\nsunset, and just this black canoe drifting steadily out to sea. I tell\r\nyou I damned Dawsons and Jamrachs and Museums and all the rest of it\r\njust to rights. I bawled to this nigger to come back, until my voice\r\nwent up into a scream.\r\n\r\n“There was nothing for it but to swim after him and take my luck with\r\nthe sharks. So I opened my clasp-knife and put it in my mouth and took\r\noff my clothes and waded in. As soon as I was in the water I lost sight\r\nof the canoe, but I aimed, as I judged, to head it off. I hoped the man\r\nin it was too bad to navigate it, and that it would keep on drifting in\r\nthe same direction. Presently it came up over the horizon again to the\r\nsouth-westward about. The afterglow of sunset was well over now and the\r\ndim of night creeping up. The stars were coming through the blue. I swam\r\nlike a champion, though my legs and arms were soon aching.\r\n\r\n“However, I came up to him by the time the stars were fairly out. As it\r\ngot darker I began to see all manner of glowing things in the\r\nwater—phosphorescence, you know. At times it made me giddy. I hardly\r\nknew which was stars and which was phosphorescence, and whether I was\r\nswimming on my head or my heels. The canoe was as black as sin, and the\r\nripple under the bows like liquid fire. I was naturally chary of\r\nclambering up into it. I was anxious to see what he was up to first. He\r\nseemed to be lying cuddled up in a lump in the bows, and the stern was\r\nall out of water. The thing kept turning round slowly as it drifted—kind\r\nof waltzing, don’t you know. I went to the stern and pulled it down,\r\nexpecting him to wake up. Then I began to clamber in with my knife in my\r\nhand, and ready for a rush. But he never stirred. So there I sat in the\r\nstern of the little canoe, drifting away over the calm phosphorescent\r\nsea, and with all the host of the stars above me, waiting for something\r\nto happen.\r\n\r\n“After a long time I called him by name, but he never answered. I was\r\ntoo tired to take any risks by going along to him. So we sat there. I\r\nfancy I dozed once or twice. When the dawn came I saw he was as dead as\r\na doornail and all puffed up and purple. My three eggs and the bones\r\nwere lying in the middle of the canoe, and the keg of water and some\r\ncoffee and biscuits wrapped in a Cape ‘Argus’ by his feet, and a tin of\r\nmethylated spirit underneath him. There was no paddle, nor in fact\r\nanything except the spirit tin that one could use as one, so I settled\r\nto drift until I was picked up. I held an inquest on him, brought in a\r\nverdict against some snake, scorpion, or centipede unknown, and sent him\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\n“After that I had a drink of water and a few biscuits, and took a look\r\nround. I suppose a man low down as I was don’t see very far; leastways,\r\nMadagascar was clean out of sight, and any trace of land at all. I saw a\r\nsail going south-westward—looked like a schooner, but her hull never\r\ncame up. Presently the sun got high in the sky and began to beat down\r\nupon me. Lord!—it pretty near made my brains boil. I tried dipping my\r\nhead in the sea, but after a while my eye fell on the Cape ‘Argus,’ and\r\nI lay down flat in the canoe and spread this over me. Wonderful things\r\nthese newspapers. I never read one through thoroughly before, but it’s\r\nodd what you get up to when you’re alone, as I was. I suppose I read\r\nthat blessed old Cape ‘Argus’ twenty times. The pitch in the canoe\r\nsimply reeked with the heat and rose up into big blisters.\r\n\r\n“I drifted ten days,” said the man with the scar. “It’s a little thing\r\nin the telling, isn’t it? Every day was like the last. Except in the\r\nmorning and the evening I never kept a look-out even—the blaze was so\r\ninfernal. I didn’t see a sail after the first three days, and those I\r\nsaw took no notice of me. About the sixth night a ship went by scarcely\r\nhalf a mile away from me, with all its lights ablaze and its ports open,\r\nlooking like a big firefly. There was music aboard. I stood up and\r\nshouted and screamed at it. The second day I broached one of the\r\nÆpyornis eggs, scraped the shell away at the end bit by bit, and tried\r\nit, and I was glad to find it was good enough to eat. A bit flavoury—not\r\nbad, I mean, but with something of the taste of a duck’s egg. There was\r\na kind of circular patch about six inches across on one side of the\r\nyolk, and with streaks of blood and a white mark like a ladder in it\r\nthat I thought queer, but I didn’t understand what this meant at the\r\ntime, and I wasn’t inclined to be particular. The egg lasted me three\r\ndays, with biscuits and a drink of water. I chewed coffee berries\r\ntoo—invigorating stuff. The second egg I opened about the eighth day.\r\nAnd it scared me.”\r\n\r\nThe man with the scar paused. “Yes,” he said—“developing.\r\n\r\n“I daresay you find it hard to believe. _I_ did, with the thing before\r\nme. There the egg had been, sunk in that cold black mud, perhaps three\r\nhundred years. But there was no mistaking it. There was the—what is\r\nit?—embryo, with its big head and curved back and its heart beating\r\nunder its throat, and the yolk shrivelled up and great membranes\r\nspreading inside of the shell and all over the yolk. Here was I hatching\r\nout the eggs of the biggest of all extinct birds, in a little canoe in\r\nthe midst of the Indian Ocean. If old Dawson had known that! It was\r\nworth four years’ salary. What do _you_ think?\r\n\r\n“However, I had to eat that precious thing up, every bit of it, before I\r\nsighted the reef, and some of the mouthfuls were beastly unpleasant. I\r\nleft the third one alone. I held it up to the light, but the shell was\r\ntoo thick for me to get any notion of what might be happening inside;\r\nand though I fancied I heard blood pulsing, it might have been the\r\nrustle in my own ears, like what you listen to in a seashell.\r\n\r\n“Then came the atoll. Came out of the sunrise, as it were, suddenly,\r\nclose up to me. I drifted straight towards it until I was about half a\r\nmile from shore—not more, and then the current took a turn, and I had to\r\npaddle as hard as I could with my hands and bits of the Æpyornis shell\r\nto make the place. However, I got there. It was just a common atoll\r\nabout four miles round, with a few trees growing and a spring in one\r\nplace and the lagoon full of parrot fish. I took the egg ashore and put\r\nit in a good place well above the tide lines and in the sun, to give it\r\nall the chance I could, and pulled the canoe up safe, and loafed about\r\nprospecting. It’s rum how dull an atoll is. When I was a kid I thought\r\nnothing could be finer or more adventurous than the Robinson Crusoe\r\nbusiness, but that place was as monotonous as a book of sermons. I went\r\nround finding eatable things and generally thinking; but I tell you I\r\nwas bored to death before the first day was out. It shows my luck—the\r\nvery day I landed the weather changed. A thunderstorm went by to the\r\nnorth and flicked its wing over the island, and in the night there came\r\na drencher and a howling wind slap over us. It wouldn’t have taken much,\r\nyou know, to upset that canoe.\r\n\r\n“I was sleeping under the canoe, and the egg was luckily among the sand\r\nhigher up the beach, and the first thing I remember was a sound like a\r\nhundred pebbles hitting the boat at once and a rush of water over my\r\nbody. I’d been dreaming of Antananarivo, and I sat up and holloaed to\r\nIntoshi to ask her what the devil was up, and clawed out at the chair\r\nwhere the matches used to be. Then I remembered where I was. There were\r\nphosphorescent waves rolling up as if they meant to eat me, and all the\r\nrest of the night as black as pitch. The air was simply yelling. The\r\nclouds seemed down on your head almost, and the rain fell as if heaven\r\nwas sinking and they were baling out the waters above the firmament. One\r\ngreat roller came writhing at me, like a fiery serpent, and I bolted.\r\nThen I thought of the canoe, and ran down to it as the water went\r\nhissing back again, but the thing had gone. I wondered about the egg\r\nthen, and felt my way to it. It was all right and well out of reach of\r\nthe maddest waves, so I sat down beside it and cuddled it for company.\r\nLord! What a night that was!\r\n\r\n“The storm was over before the morning. There wasn’t a rag of cloud left\r\nin the sky when the dawn came, and all along the beach there were bits\r\nof plank scattered—which was the disarticulated skeleton, so to speak,\r\nof my canoe. However, that gave me something to do, for, taking\r\nadvantage of two of the trees being together, I rigged up a kind of\r\nstorm shelter with these vestiges. And that day the egg hatched.\r\n\r\n“Hatched, sir, when my head was pillowed on it and I was asleep. I heard\r\na whack and felt a jar and sat up, and there was the end of the egg\r\npecked out and a rum little brown head looking out at me. ‘Lord!’ I\r\nsaid, ‘you’re welcome,’ and with a little difficulty he came out.\r\n\r\n“He was a nice friendly little chap, at first, about the size of a small\r\nhen—very much like most other young birds, only bigger. His plumage was\r\na dirty brown to begin with, with a sort of grey scab that fell off it\r\nvery soon, and scarcely feathers—a kind of downy hair. I can hardly\r\nexpress how pleased I was to see him. I tell you, Robinson Crusoe don’t\r\nmake near enough of his loneliness. But here was interesting company. He\r\nlooked at me and winked his eye from the front backwards like a hen, and\r\ngave a chirp and began to peck about at once, as though being hatched\r\nthree hundred years too late was just nothing. ‘Glad to see you, Man\r\nFriday!’ says I, for I had naturally settled he was to be called Man\r\nFriday if ever he was hatched, as soon as ever I found the egg in the\r\ncanoe had developed. I was a bit anxious about his feed, so I gave him a\r\nlump of raw parrot fish at once. He took it and opened his beak for\r\nmore. I was glad of that, for, under the circumstances, if he’d been\r\nfanciful, I should have had to eat him after all.\r\n\r\n“You’d be surprised what an interesting bird that Æpyornis chick was. He\r\nfollowed me about from the very beginning. He used to stand by me and\r\nwatch while I fished in the lagoon and go shares in anything I caught.\r\nAnd he was sensible, too. There were nasty green warty things, like\r\npickled gherkins, used to lie about on the beach, and he tried one of\r\nthese and it upset him. He never even looked at any of them again.\r\n\r\n“And he grew. You could almost see him grow. And as I was never much of\r\na society man, his quiet, friendly ways suited me to a T. For nearly two\r\nyears we were as happy as we could be on that island. I had no business\r\nworries, for I knew my salary was mounting up at Dawsons’. We would see\r\na sail now and then, but nothing ever came near us. I amused myself too\r\nby decorating the island with designs worked in sea-urchins and fancy\r\nshells of various kinds. I put ÆPYORNIS ISLAND all round the place very\r\nnearly, in big letters, like what you see done with coloured stones at\r\nrailway stations in the old country. And I used to lie watching the\r\nblessed bird stalking round and growing, growing, and think how I could\r\nmake a living out of him by showing him about if ever I got taken off.\r\nAfter his first moult he began to get handsome, with a crest and a blue\r\nwattle, and a lot of green feathers at the behind of him. And then I\r\nused to puzzle whether Dawsons had any right to claim him or not. Stormy\r\nweather and in the rainy season we lay snug under the shelter I had made\r\nout of the old canoe, and I used to tell him lies about my friends at\r\nhome. It was a kind of idyll, you might say. If only I had had some\r\ntobacco it would have been simply just like Heaven.\r\n\r\n“It was about the end of the second year our little Paradise went wrong.\r\nFriday was then about fourteen feet high to the bill of him, with a big\r\nbroad head like the end of a pickaxe, and two huge brown eyes with\r\nyellow rims set together like a man’s—not out of sight of each other\r\nlike a hen’s. His plumage was fine—none of the half mourning style of\r\nyour ostrich—more like a cassowary as far as colour and texture go. And\r\nthen it was he began to cock his comb at me and give himself airs and\r\nshow signs of a nasty temper.\r\n\r\n“At last came a time when my fishing had been rather unlucky and he\r\nbegan to hang about me in a queer, meditative way. I thought he might\r\nhave been eating sea-cucumbers or something, but it was really just\r\ndiscontent on his part. I was hungry too, and when at last I landed a\r\nfish I wanted it for myself. Tempers were short that morning on both\r\nsides. He pecked at it and grabbed it, and I gave him a whack on the\r\nhead to make him leave go. And at that he went for me. Lord!\r\n\r\n“He gave me this in the face.” The man indicated his scar. “Then he\r\nkicked me. It was like a cart horse. I got up, and seeing he hadn’t\r\nfinished I started off full tilt with my arms doubled up over my face.\r\nBut he ran on those gawky legs of his faster than a race horse, and kept\r\nlanding out at me with sledge-hammer kicks, and bringing his pickaxe\r\ndown on the back of my head. I made for the lagoon, and went in up to my\r\nneck. He stopped at the water, for he hated getting his feet wet, and\r\nbegan to make a shindy, something like a peacock’s, only hoarser. He\r\nstarted strutting up and down the beach. I’ll admit I felt small to see\r\nthis blessed fossil lording it there. And my head and face were all\r\nbleeding, and—well, my body just one jelly of bruises.\r\n\r\n“I decided to swim across the lagoon and leave him alone for a bit,\r\nuntil the affair blew over. I shinned up the tallest palm-tree and sat\r\nthere thinking of it all. I don’t suppose I ever felt so hurt by\r\nanything before or since. It was the brutal ingratitude of the creature.\r\nI’d been more than a brother to him. I’d hatched him. Educated him. A\r\ngreat, gawky, out-of-date bird! And me a human being—heir of the ages\r\nand all that.\r\n\r\n“I thought after a time he’d begin to see things in that light himself,\r\nand feel a little sorry for his behaviour. I thought if I was to catch\r\nsome nice little bits of fish, perhaps, and go to him presently in a\r\ncasual kind of way, and offer them to him, he might do the sensible\r\nthing. It took me some time to learn how unforgiving and cantankerous an\r\nextinct bird can be. Malice!\r\n\r\n“I won’t tell you all the little devices I tried to get that bird round\r\nagain. I simply can’t. It makes my cheek burn with shame even now to\r\nthink of the snubs and buffets I had from this infernal curiosity. I\r\ntried violence. I chucked lumps of coral at him from a safe distance,\r\nbut he only swallowed them. I shied my open knife at him and almost lost\r\nit, though it was too big for him to swallow. I tried starving him out\r\nand struck fishing, but he took to picking along the beach at low water\r\nafter worms, and rubbed along on that. Half my time I spent up to my\r\nneck in the lagoon, and the rest up the palm-trees. One of them was\r\nscarcely high enough, and when he caught me up it he had a regular Bank\r\nHoliday with the calves of my legs. It got unbearable. I don’t know if\r\nyou have ever tried sleeping up a palm-tree. It gave me the most\r\nhorrible nightmares. Think of the shame of it too! Here was this extinct\r\nanimal mooning about my island like a sulky duke, and me not allowed to\r\nrest the sole of my foot on the place. I used to cry with weariness and\r\nvexation. I told him straight that I didn’t mean to be chased about a\r\ndesert island by any damned anachronisms. I told him to go and peck a\r\nnavigator of his own age. But he only snapped his beak at me. Great ugly\r\nbird—all legs and neck!\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t like to say how long that went on altogether. I’d have\r\nkilled him sooner if I’d known how. However, I hit on a way of settling\r\nhim at last. It’s a South American dodge. I joined all my fishing lines\r\ntogether with stems of seaweed and things, and made a stoutish string,\r\nperhaps twelve yards in length or more, and I fastened two lumps of\r\ncoral rock to the ends of this. It took me some time to do, because\r\nevery now and then I had to go into the lagoon or up a tree as the fancy\r\ntook me. This I whirled rapidly round my head and then let it go at him.\r\nThe first time I missed, but the next time the string caught his legs\r\nbeautifully and wrapped round them again and again. Over he went. I\r\nthrew it standing waist-deep in the lagoon, and as soon as he went down\r\nI was out of the water and sawing at his neck with my knife—\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to think of that even now. I felt like a murderer while I\r\ndid it, though my anger was hot against him. When I stood over him and\r\nsaw him bleeding on the white sand and his beautiful great legs and neck\r\nwrithing in his last agony—Pah!\r\n\r\n“With that tragedy, Loneliness came upon me like a curse. Good Lord! you\r\ncan’t imagine how I missed that bird. I sat by his corpse and sorrowed\r\nover him, and shivered as I looked round the desolate, silent reef. I\r\nthought of what a jolly little bird he had been when he was hatched, and\r\nof a thousand pleasant tricks he had played before he went wrong. I\r\nthought if I’d only wounded him I might have nursed him round into a\r\nbetter understanding. If I’d had any means of digging into the coral\r\nrock I’d have buried him. I felt exactly as if he was human. As it was I\r\ncouldn’t think of eating him, so I put him in the lagoon and the little\r\nfishes picked him clean. Then one day a chap cruising about in a yacht\r\nhad a fancy to see if my atoll still existed.\r\n\r\n“He didn’t come a moment too soon, for I was about sick enough of the\r\ndesolation of it, and only hesitating whether I should walk out into the\r\nsea and finish up the business that way, or fall back on the green\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n“I sold the bones to a man named Winslow—a dealer near the British\r\nMuseum, and he says he sold them to old Havers. It seems Havers didn’t\r\nunderstand they were extra large, and it was only after his death they\r\nattracted attention. They called ’em Æpyornis—what was it?”\r\n\r\n“_Æpyornis vastus_,” said I. “It’s funny, the very thing was mentioned\r\nto me by a friend of mine. When they found an Æpyornis with a thigh a\r\nyard long they thought they had reached the top of the scale and called\r\nhim _Æpyornis maximus_. Then some one turned up another thigh bone four\r\nfeet six or more, and that they called _Æpyornis Titan_. Then your\r\n_vastus_ was found after old Havers died, in his collection, and then a\r\n_vastissimus_ turned up.”\r\n\r\n“Winslow was telling me as much,” said the man with the scar. “If they\r\nget any more Æpyornises, he reckons some scientific swell will go and\r\nburst a blood-vessel. But it was a queer thing to happen to a man;\r\nwasn’t it—altogether?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PLATTNER STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not, is a\r\npretty question in the value of evidence. On the one hand, we have seven\r\nwitnesses—to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of eyes,\r\nand one undeniable fact; and on the other we have—what is it?—prejudice,\r\ncommon sense, the inertia of opinion. Never were there seven more\r\nhonest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable fact than\r\nthe inversion of Gottfried Plattner’s anatomical structure, and—never\r\nwas there a more preposterous story than the one they have to tell! The\r\nmost preposterous part of the story is the worthy Gottfried’s\r\ncontribution (for I count him as one of the seven). Heaven forbid that I\r\nshould be led into giving countenance to superstition by a passion for\r\nimpartiality, and so come to share the fate of Eusapia’s patrons!\r\nFrankly, I believe there is something crooked about this business of\r\nGottfried Plattner; but what that crooked factor is, I will admit as\r\nfrankly, I do not know. I have been surprised at the credit accorded to\r\nthe story in the most unexpected and authoritative quarters. The fairest\r\nway to the reader, however, will be for me to tell it without further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nGottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a freeborn Englishman. His\r\nfather was an Alsatian who came to England in the Sixties, married a\r\nrespectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and died, after\r\na wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, chiefly to the\r\nlaying of parquet flooring), in 1887. Gottfried’s age is\r\nseven-and-twenty. He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages,\r\nModern Languages Master in a small private school in the South of\r\nEngland. To the casual observer he is singularly like any other Modern\r\nLanguages Master in any other small private school. His costume is\r\nneither very costly nor very fashionable, but, on the other hand, it is\r\nnot markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his height and his\r\nbearing, is inconspicuous. You would notice, perhaps, that, like the\r\nmajority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical, his right\r\neye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier on the\r\nright side. If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare his\r\nchest and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite like\r\nthe heart of any one else. But here you and the trained observer would\r\npart company. If you found his heart quite ordinary, the trained\r\nobserver would find it quite otherwise. And once the thing was pointed\r\nout to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity easily enough. It is\r\nthat Gottfried’s heart beats on the right side of his body.\r\n\r\nNow, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried’s structure, although\r\nit is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind. Careful\r\nsounding of Gottfried’s internal arrangements, by a well-known surgeon,\r\nseems to point to the fact that all the other unsymmetrical parts of his\r\nbody are similarly misplaced. The right lobe of his liver is on the left\r\nside, the left on his right; while his lungs, too, are similarly\r\ncontraposed. What is still more singular, unless Gottfried is a\r\nconsummate actor, we must believe that his right hand has recently\r\nbecome his left. Since the occurrences we are about to consider (as\r\nimpartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty in writing,\r\nexcept from right to left across the paper with his left hand. He cannot\r\nthrow with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal times between knife\r\nand fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road—he is a cyclist—are\r\nstill a dangerous confusion. And there is not a scrap of evidence to\r\nshow that before these occurrences Gottfried was at all left-handed.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.\r\nGottfried produces three photographs of himself. You have him at the age\r\nof five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid frock, and\r\nscowling. In that photograph his left eye is a little larger than his\r\nright, and his jaw is a trifle heavier on the left side. This is the\r\nreverse of his present living conditions. The photograph of Gottfried at\r\nfourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is because it is one\r\nof those cheap “Gem” photographs that were then in vogue, taken direct\r\nupon metal, and therefore reversing things just as a looking-glass\r\nwould. The third photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and\r\nconfirms the record of the others. There seems here evidence of the\r\nstrongest confirmatory character that Gottfried has exchanged his left\r\nside for his right. Yet how a human being can be so changed, short of a\r\nfantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly hard to suggest.\r\n\r\nIn one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the\r\nsupposition that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on\r\nthe strength of his heart’s displacement. Photographs may be fudged, and\r\nleft-handedness imitated. But the character of the man does not lend\r\nitself to any such theory. He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive, and\r\nthoroughly sane, from the Nordau standpoint. He likes beer, and smokes\r\nmoderately, takes walking exercise daily, and has a healthily high\r\nestimate of the value of his teaching. He has a good but untrained tenor\r\nvoice, and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a popular and cheerful\r\ncharacter. He is fond, but not morbidly fond, of reading,—chiefly\r\nfiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimism,—sleeps well, and rarely\r\ndreams. He is, in fact, the very last person to evolve a fantastic\r\nfable. Indeed, so far from forcing this story upon the world, he has\r\nbeen singularly reticent on the matter. He meets enquirers with a\r\ncertain engaging—bashfulness is almost the word, that disarms the most\r\nsuspicious. He seems genuinely ashamed that anything so unusual has\r\noccurred to him.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Plattner’s aversion to the idea of\r\npost-mortem dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive\r\nproof that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed.\r\nUpon that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs. There is no\r\nway of taking a man and moving him about _in space_, as ordinary people\r\nunderstand space, that will result in our changing his sides. Whatever\r\nyou do, his right is still his right, his left his left. You can do that\r\nwith a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course. If you were to cut a\r\nfigure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side, you could\r\nchange its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over. But with a\r\nsolid it is different. Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way\r\nin which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is by\r\ntaking that body clean out of space as we know it,—taking it out of\r\nordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space.\r\nThis is a little abstruse, no doubt, but any one with any knowledge of\r\nmathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth. To put the\r\nthing in technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner’s right\r\nand left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into what is\r\ncalled the Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again to our\r\nworld. Unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of an\r\nelaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost bound to believe\r\nthat this has occurred.\r\n\r\nSo much for the tangible facts. We come now to the account of the\r\nphenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the world. It\r\nappears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School Plattner not only\r\ndischarged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also taught\r\nchemistry, commercial geography, book-keeping, shorthand, drawing, and\r\nany other additional subject to which the changing fancies of the boys’\r\nparents might direct attention. He knew little or nothing of these\r\nvarious subjects, but in secondary as distinguished from Board or\r\nelementary schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very properly, by no\r\nmeans so necessary as high moral character and gentlemanly tone. In\r\nchemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing, he says, nothing\r\nbeyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases may be). As, however,\r\nhis pupils began by knowing nothing, and derived all their information\r\nfrom him, this caused him (or any one) but little inconvenience for\r\nseveral terms. Then a little boy named Whibble joined the school, who\r\nhad been educated (it seems) by some mischievous relative into an\r\nenquiring habit of mind. This little boy followed Plattner’s lessons\r\nwith marked and sustained interest, and in order to exhibit his zeal on\r\nthe subject, brought, at various times, substances for Plattner to\r\nanalyse. Plattner, flattered by this evidence of his power of awakening\r\ninterest, and trusting to the boy’s ignorance, analysed these, and even\r\nmade general statements as to their composition. Indeed, he was so far\r\nstimulated by his pupil as to obtain a work upon analytical chemistry\r\nand study it during his supervision of the evening’s preparation. He was\r\nsurprised to find chemistry quite an interesting subject.\r\n\r\nSo far the story is absolutely commonplace. But now the greenish powder\r\ncomes upon the scene. The source of that greenish powder seems,\r\nunfortunately, lost. Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of finding it\r\ndone up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the Downs. It would have\r\nbeen an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for Master Whibble’s\r\nfamily, if a match could have been applied to that powder there and\r\nthen. The young gentleman certainly did not bring it to school in a\r\npacket, but in a common eight-ounce graduated medicine bottle, plugged\r\nwith masticated newspaper. He gave it to Plattner at the end of the\r\nafternoon school. Four boys had been detained after school prayers in\r\norder to complete some neglected tasks, and Plattner was supervising\r\nthese in the small classroom in which the chemical teaching was\r\nconducted. The appliances for the practical teaching of chemistry in the\r\nSussexville Proprietary School, as in most small schools in this\r\ncountry, are characterised by a severe simplicity. They are kept in a\r\nsmall cupboard standing in a recess, and having about the same capacity\r\nas a common travelling trunk. Plattner, being bored with his passive\r\nsuperintendence, seems to have welcomed the intervention of Whibble with\r\nhis green powder as an agreeable diversion, and, unlocking this\r\ncupboard, proceeded at once with his analytical experiments. Whibble\r\nsat, luckily for himself, at a safe distance, regarding him. The four\r\nmalefactors, feigning a profound absorption in their work, watched him\r\nfurtively with the keenest interest. For even within the limits of the\r\nThree Gases, Plattner’s practical chemistry was, I understand,\r\ntemerarious.\r\n\r\nThey are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner’s\r\nproceedings. He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube,\r\nand tried the substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and\r\nsulphuric acid in succession. Getting no result, he emptied out a little\r\nheap—nearly half the bottleful, in fact—upon a slate and tried a match.\r\nHe held the medicine bottle in his left hand. The stuff began to smoke\r\nand melt, and then—exploded with deafening violence and a blinding\r\nflash.\r\n\r\nThe five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,\r\nducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt. The\r\nwindow was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on its\r\neasel was upset. The slate was smashed to atoms. Some plaster fell from\r\nthe ceiling. No other damage was done to the school edifice or\r\nappliances, and the boys at first, seeing nothing of Plattner, fancied\r\nhe was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks. They\r\njumped out of their places to go to his assistance, and were amazed to\r\nfind the space empty. Being still confused by the sudden violence of the\r\nreport, they hurried to the open door, under the impression that he must\r\nhave been hurt, and have rushed out of the room. But Carson, the\r\nforemost, nearly collided in the doorway with the principal, Mr.\r\nLidgett.\r\n\r\nMr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye. The boys\r\ndescribe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those tempered\r\nexpletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use—lest worse\r\nbefall. “Wretched mumchancer!” he said. “Where’s Mr. Plattner?” The boys\r\nare agreed on the very words. (“Wobbler,” “snivelling puppy,” and\r\n“mumchancer” are, it seems, among the ordinary small change of Mr.\r\nLidgett’s scholastic commerce.)\r\n\r\nWhere’s Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated many\r\ntimes in the next few days. It really seemed as though that frantic\r\nhyperbole, “blown to atoms,” had for once realised itself. There was not\r\na visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood nor a\r\nstitch of clothing to be found. Apparently he had been blown clean out\r\nof existence and left not a wrack behind. Not so much as would cover a\r\nsixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The evidence of his\r\nabsolute disappearance, as a consequence of that explosion, is\r\nindubitable.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in the\r\nSussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, by\r\nthis event. It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers of\r\nthese pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying version of\r\nthat excitement during the last summer holidays. Lidgett, it would seem,\r\ndid everything in his power to suppress and minimise the story. He\r\ninstituted a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention of Plattner’s\r\nname among the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that he was clearly\r\naware of his assistant’s whereabouts. He was afraid, he explains, that\r\nthe possibility of an explosion happening, in spite of the elaborate\r\nprecautions taken to minimise the practical teaching of chemistry, might\r\ninjure the reputation of the school; and so might any mysterious quality\r\nin Plattner’s departure. Indeed, he did everything in his power to make\r\nthe occurrence seem as ordinary as possible. In particular, he\r\ncross-examined the five eye-witnesses of the occurrence so searchingly\r\nthat they began to doubt the plain evidence of their senses. But, in\r\nspite of these efforts, the tale, in a magnified and distorted state,\r\nmade a nine days’ wonder in the district, and several parents withdrew\r\ntheir sons on colourable pretexts. Not the least remarkable point in the\r\nmatter is the fact that a large number of people in the neighbourhood\r\ndreamed singularly vivid dreams of Plattner during the period of\r\nexcitement before his return, and that these dreams had a curious\r\nuniformity. In almost all of them Plattner was seen, sometimes singly,\r\nsometimes in company, wandering about through a coruscating iridescence.\r\nIn all cases his face was pale and distressed, and in some he\r\ngesticulated towards the dreamer. One or two of the boys, evidently\r\nunder the influence of nightmare, fancied that Plattner approached them\r\nwith remarkable swiftness, and seemed to look closely into their very\r\neyes. Others fled with Plattner from the pursuit of vague and\r\nextraordinary creatures of a globular shape. But all these fancies were\r\nforgotten in enquiries and speculations when, on the Wednesday next but\r\none after the Monday of the explosion, Plattner returned.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his\r\ndeparture. So far as Mr. Lidgett’s somewhat choleric outline can be\r\nfilled in from Plattner’s hesitating statements, it would appear that on\r\nWednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former gentleman,\r\nhaving dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his garden, picking\r\nand eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is inordinately fond. It is\r\na large old-fashioned garden, secured from observation, fortunately, by\r\na high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. Just as he was stooping over a\r\nparticularly prolific plant, there was a flash in the air and a heavy\r\nthud, and before he could look round, some heavy body struck him\r\nviolently from behind. He was pitched forward, crushing the strawberries\r\nhe held in his hand, and that so roughly, that his silk hat—Mr. Lidgett\r\nadheres to the older ideas of scholastic costume—was driven violently\r\ndown upon his forehead, and almost over one eye. This heavy missile,\r\nwhich slid over him sideways and collapsed into a sitting posture among\r\nthe strawberry plants, proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried\r\nPlattner, in an extremely dishevelled condition. He was collarless and\r\nhatless, his linen was dirty, and there was blood upon his hands. Mr.\r\nLidgett was so indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours,\r\nand with his hat jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated\r\nvehemently with Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThis scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior\r\nversion of the Plattner story—its exoteric aspect. It is quite\r\nunnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr.\r\nLidgett. Such details, with the full names and dates and references,\r\nwill be found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid\r\nbefore the Society for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena. The\r\nsingular transposition of Plattner’s right and left sides was scarcely\r\nobserved for the first day or so, and then first in connection with his\r\ndisposition to write from right to left across the blackboard. He\r\nconcealed rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance,\r\nas he considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new\r\nsituation. The displacement of his heart was discovered some months\r\nafter, when he was having a tooth extracted under anæsthetics. He then,\r\nvery unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical examination to be made of\r\nhimself, with a view to a brief account in the “Journal of Anatomy.”\r\nThat exhausts the statement of the material facts; and we may now go on\r\nto consider Plattner’s account of the matter.\r\n\r\nBut first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion of\r\nthis story and what is to follow. All I have told thus far is\r\nestablished by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve.\r\nEvery one of the witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the\r\nleisure, may hunt the lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors of\r\nthe redoubtable Lidgett, and cross-examine and trap and test to his\r\nheart’s content; Gottfried Plattner, himself, and his twisted heart and\r\nhis three photographs are producible. It may be taken as proved that he\r\ndid disappear for nine days as the consequence of an explosion; that he\r\nreturned almost as violently, under circumstances in their nature\r\nannoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of those circumstances may\r\nbe; and that he returned inverted, just as a reflection returns from a\r\nmirror. From the last fact, as I have already stated, it follows almost\r\ninevitably that Plattner, during those nine days, must have been in some\r\nstate of existence altogether out of space. The evidence to these\r\nstatements is, indeed, far stronger than that upon which most murderers\r\nare hanged. But for his own particular account of where he had been,\r\nwith its confused explanations and well-nigh self-contradictory details,\r\nwe have only Mr. Gottfried Plattner’s word. I do not wish to discredit\r\nthat, but I must point out—what so many writers upon obscure psychic\r\nphenomena fail to do—that we are passing here from the practically\r\nundeniable to that kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled\r\nto believe or reject as he thinks proper. The previous statements render\r\nit plausible; its discordance with common experience tilts it towards\r\nthe incredible. I would prefer not to sway the beam of the reader’s\r\njudgment either way, but simply to tell the story as Plattner told it\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst, and\r\nso soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and wrote\r\ndown everything as I remembered it. Subsequently he was good enough to\r\nread over a typewritten copy, so that its substantial correctness is\r\nundeniable.\r\n\r\nHe states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought he\r\nwas killed. He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward. It\r\nis a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his\r\nbackward flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry\r\ncupboard or the blackboard easel. His heels struck ground, and he\r\nstaggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft and\r\nfirm. For a moment the concussion stunned him. He became aware at once\r\nof a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the voice of\r\nLidgett asking for him. You will understand that for a time his mind was\r\ngreatly confused.\r\n\r\nAt first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still in the\r\nclassroom. He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the boys and\r\nthe entry of Mr. Lidgett. He is quite positive upon that score. He did\r\nnot hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the deafening effect of\r\nthe experiment. Things about him seemed curiously dark and faint, but\r\nhis mind explained that on the obvious but mistaken idea that the\r\nexplosion had engendered a huge volume of dark smoke. Through the\r\ndimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys moved, as faint and silent\r\nas ghosts. Plattner’s face still tingled with the stinging heat of the\r\nflash. He was, he says, “all muddled.” His first definite thoughts seem\r\nto have been of his personal safety. He thought he was perhaps blinded\r\nand deafened. He felt his limbs and face in a gingerly manner. Then his\r\nperceptions grew clearer, and he was astonished to miss the old familiar\r\ndesks and other schoolroom furniture about him. Only dim, uncertain,\r\ngrey shapes stood in the place of these. Then came a thing that made him\r\nshout aloud, and awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity. _Two\r\nof the boys, gesticulating, walked one after the other clean through\r\nhim!_ Neither manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence. It\r\nis difficult to imagine the sensation he felt. They came against him, he\r\nsays, with no more force than a wisp of mist.\r\n\r\nPlattner’s first thought after that was that he was dead. Having been\r\nbrought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however, he was\r\na little surprised to find his body still about him. His second\r\nconclusion was that he was not dead, but that the others were: that the\r\nexplosion had destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School and every\r\nsoul in it except himself. But that, too, was scarcely satisfactory. He\r\nwas thrown back upon astonished observation.\r\n\r\nEverything about him was extraordinarily dark: at first it seemed to\r\nhave an altogether ebony blackness. Overhead was a black firmament. The\r\nonly touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow at the edge\r\nof the sky in one direction, which threw into prominence a horizon of\r\nundulating black hills. This, I say, was his impression at first. As his\r\neye grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to distinguish a faint\r\nquality of differentiating greenish colour in the circumambient night.\r\nAgainst this background the furniture and occupants of the classroom, it\r\nseems, stood out like phosphorescent spectres, faint and impalpable. He\r\nextended his hand, and thrust it without an effort through the wall of\r\nthe room by the fireplace.\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract attention.\r\nHe shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went to and\r\nfro. He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, whom he (as\r\nan Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room. He says the\r\nsensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it, was an\r\nextraordinarily disagreeable one. He compared his feelings, not inaptly,\r\nto those of a cat watching a mouse through a window. Whenever he made a\r\nmotion to communicate with the dim, familiar world about him, he found\r\nan invisible, incomprehensible barrier preventing intercourse.\r\n\r\nHe then turned his attention to his solid environment. He found the\r\nmedicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder of the\r\ngreen powder therein. He put this in his pocket, and began to feel about\r\nhim. Apparently, he was sitting on a boulder of rock covered with a\r\nvelvety moss. The dark country about him he was unable to see, the\r\nfaint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, but he had a\r\nfeeling (due perhaps to a cold wind) that he was near the crest of a\r\nhill, and that a steep valley fell away beneath his feet. The green glow\r\nalong the edge of the sky seemed to be growing in extent and intensity.\r\nHe stood up, rubbing his eyes.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and then\r\nstumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass of rock to\r\nwatch the dawn. He became aware that the world about him was absolutely\r\nsilent. It was as still as it was dark, and though there was a cold wind\r\nblowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the soughing of the\r\nboughs that should have accompanied it, were absent. He could hear,\r\ntherefore, if he could not see, that the hillside upon which he stood\r\nwas rocky and desolate. The green grew brighter every moment, and as it\r\ndid so, a faint, transparent blood-red mingled with, but did not\r\nmitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the rocky desolations\r\nabout him. Having regard to what follows, I am inclined to think that\r\nthat redness may have been an optical effect due to contrast. Something\r\nblack fluttered momentarily against the livid yellow-green of the lower\r\nsky, and then the thin and penetrating voice of a bell rose out of the\r\nblack gulf below him. An oppressive expectation grew with the growing\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the\r\nstrange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading slowly,\r\nin flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith. As it grew, the\r\nspectral vision of _our_ world became relatively or absolutely fainter.\r\nProbably both, for the time must have been about that of our earthly\r\nsunset. So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few\r\nsteps downhill, had passed through the floor of the classroom, and was\r\nnow, it seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom downstairs.\r\nHe saw the boarders distinctly, but much more faintly than he had seen\r\nLidgett. They were preparing their evening tasks, and he noticed with\r\ninterest that several were cheating with their Euclid riders by means of\r\na crib, a compilation whose existence he had hitherto never suspected.\r\nAs the time passed, they faded steadily, as steadily as the light of the\r\ngreen dawn increased.\r\n\r\nLooking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far down\r\nits rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss was now\r\nbroken by a minute green glow, like the light of a glow-worm. And almost\r\nimmediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing green rose over\r\nthe basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and the monstrous\r\nhill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in green light and\r\ndeep, ruddy black shadows. He became aware of a vast number of\r\nball-shaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over the high ground.\r\nThere were none of these nearer to him than the opposite side of the\r\ngorge. The bell below twanged quicker and quicker, with something like\r\nimpatient insistence, and several lights moved hither and thither. The\r\nboys at work at their desks were now almost imperceptibly faint.\r\n\r\nThis extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other universe\r\nrose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists. During the\r\nOther-World night, it is difficult to move about, on account of the\r\nvividness with which the things of this world are visible. It becomes a\r\nriddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no\r\nglimpse of the Other-World. It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively\r\nvivid illumination of this world of ours. Plattner describes the midday\r\nof the Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as\r\nthis world at full moon, while its night is profoundly black.\r\nConsequently, the amount of light, even in an ordinary dark room, is\r\nsufficient to render the things of the Other-World invisible, on the\r\nsame principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the\r\nprofoundest darkness. I have tried, since he told me his story, to see\r\nsomething of the Other-World by sitting for a long space in a\r\nphotographer’s dark room at night. I have certainly seen indistinctly\r\nthe form of greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must admit, very\r\nindistinctly indeed. The reader may possibly be more successful.\r\nPlattner tells me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and\r\nrecognised places in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his\r\nmemory of these scenes. It seems quite possible that people with\r\nunusually keen eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange\r\nOther-World about us.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is a digression. As the green sun rose, a long street of\r\nblack buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and indistinctly,\r\nin the gorge, and, after some hesitation, Plattner began to clamber down\r\nthe precipitous descent towards them. The descent was long and\r\nexceedingly tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary steepness,\r\nbut also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with which the whole\r\nface of the hill was strewn. The noise of his descent—now and then his\r\nheels struck fire from the rocks—seemed now the only sound in the\r\nuniverse, for the beating of the bell had ceased. As he drew nearer, he\r\nperceived that the various edifices had a singular resemblance to tombs\r\nand mausoleums and monuments, saving only that they were all uniformly\r\nblack instead of being white, as most sepulchres are. And then he saw,\r\ncrowding out of the largest building, very much as people disperse from\r\nchurch, a number of pallid, rounded, pale-green figures. These dispersed\r\nin several directions about the broad street of the place, some going\r\nthrough side alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill,\r\nothers entering some of the small black buildings which lined the way.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner stopped,\r\nstaring. They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, and they had\r\nthe appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung.\r\nHe was too astonished at their strangeness, too full, indeed, of\r\nstrangeness, to be seriously alarmed by them. They drove towards him, in\r\nfront of the chill wind that was blowing uphill, much as soap-bubbles\r\ndrive before a draught. And as he looked at the nearest of those\r\napproaching, he saw it was indeed a human head, albeit with singularly\r\nlarge eyes, and wearing such an expression of distress and anguish as he\r\nhad never seen before upon mortal countenance. He was surprised to find\r\nthat it did not turn to regard him, but seemed to be watching and\r\nfollowing some unseen moving thing. For a moment he was puzzled, and\r\nthen it occurred to him that this creature was watching with its\r\nenormous eyes something that was happening in the world he had just\r\nleft. Nearer it came, and nearer, and he was too astonished to cry out.\r\nIt made a very faint fretting sound as it came close to him. Then it\r\nstruck his face with a gentle pat,—its touch was very cold,—and drove\r\npast him, and upward towards the crest of the hill.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner’s mind that this\r\nhead had a strong likeness to Lidgett. Then he turned his attention to\r\nthe other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside. None\r\nmade the slightest sign of recognition. One or two, indeed, came close\r\nto his head and almost followed the example of the first, but he dodged\r\nconvulsively out of the way. Upon most of them he saw the same\r\nexpression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first, and heard\r\nthe same faint sounds of wretchedness from them. One or two wept, and\r\none rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of diabolical rage. But\r\nothers were cold, and several had a look of gratified interest in their\r\neyes. One, at least, was almost in an ecstasy of happiness. Plattner\r\ndoes not remember that he recognised any more likenesses in those he saw\r\nat this time.\r\n\r\nFor several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things\r\ndispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had\r\nceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did he\r\nresume his downward climb. The darkness about him increased so much that\r\nhe had a difficulty in stepping true. Overhead the sky was now a bright,\r\npale green. He felt neither hunger nor thirst. Later, when he did, he\r\nfound a chilly stream running down the centre of the gorge, and the rare\r\nmoss upon the boulders, when he tried it at last in desperation, was\r\ngood to eat.\r\n\r\nHe groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking vaguely\r\nfor some clue to these inexplicable things. After a long time he came to\r\nthe entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from which the heads had\r\nissued. In this he found a group of green lights burning upon a kind of\r\nbasaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry overhead hanging down into\r\nthe centre of the place. Round the wall ran a lettering of fire in a\r\ncharacter unknown to him. While he was still wondering at the purport of\r\nthese things, he heard the receding tramp of heavy feet echoing far down\r\nthe street. He ran out into the darkness again, but he could see\r\nnothing. He had a mind to pull the bell-rope, and finally decided to\r\nfollow the footsteps. But, although he ran far, he never overtook them;\r\nand his shouting was of no avail. The gorge seemed to extend an\r\ninterminable distance. It was as dark as earthly starlight throughout\r\nits length, while the ghastly green day lay along the upper edge of its\r\nprecipices. There were none of the heads, now, below. They were all, it\r\nseemed, busily occupied along the upper slopes. Looking up, he saw them\r\ndrifting hither and thither, some hovering stationary, some flying\r\nswiftly through the air. It reminded him, he said, of “big snowflakes;”\r\nonly these were black and pale green.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, in\r\ngroping into new regions of this endless devil’s dyke, in clambering up\r\nand down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, and in\r\nwatching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the better\r\npart of seven or eight days. He did not keep count, he says. Though once\r\nor twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with no living soul. He\r\nslept among the rocks on the hillside. In the gorge things earthly were\r\ninvisible, because, from the earthly standpoint, it was far underground.\r\nOn the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day began, the world became\r\nvisible to him. He found himself sometimes stumbling over the dark-green\r\nrocks, or arresting himself on a precipitous brink, while all about him\r\nthe green branches of the Sussexville lanes were swaying; or, again, he\r\nseemed to be walking through the Sussexville streets, or watching unseen\r\nthe private business of some household. And then it was he discovered,\r\nthat to almost every human being in our world there pertained some of\r\nthese drifting heads: that every one in the world is watched\r\nintermittently by these helpless disembodiments.\r\n\r\nWhat are they—these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned. But\r\ntwo, that presently found and followed him, were like his childhood’s\r\nmemory of his father and mother. Now and then other faces turned their\r\neyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had swayed him, or\r\ninjured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood. Whenever they\r\nlooked at him, Plattner was overcome with a strange sense of\r\nresponsibility. To his mother he ventured to speak; but she made no\r\nanswer. She looked sadly, steadfastly, and tenderly—a little\r\nreproachfully, too, it seemed—into his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain. We are\r\nleft to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or if they are\r\nindeed the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately watch a\r\nworld they have left for ever. It may be—indeed to my mind it seems\r\njust—that, when our life has closed, when evil or good is no longer a\r\nchoice for us, we may still have to witness the working out of the train\r\nof consequences we have laid. If human souls continue after death, then\r\nsurely human interests continue after death. But that is merely my own\r\nguess at the meaning of the things seen. Plattner offers no\r\ninterpretation, for none was given him. It is well the reader should\r\nunderstand this clearly. Day after day, with his head reeling, he\r\nwandered about this strange-lit world outside the world, weary and,\r\ntowards the end, weak and hungry. By day—by our earthly day, that is—the\r\nghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of Sussexville, all about\r\nhim, irked and worried him. He could not see where to put his feet, and\r\never and again with a chilly touch one of these Watching Souls would\r\ncome against his face. And after dark the multitude of these Watchers\r\nabout him, and their intent distress, confused his mind beyond\r\ndescribing. A great longing to return to the earthly life that was so\r\nnear and yet so remote consumed him. The unearthliness of things about\r\nhim produced a positively painful mental distress. He was worried beyond\r\ndescribing by his own particular followers. He would shout at them to\r\ndesist from staring at him, scold at them, hurry away from them. They\r\nwere always mute and intent. Run as he might over the uneven ground,\r\nthey followed his destinies.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible\r\nfootsteps approaching, far away down the gorge. He was then wandering\r\nover the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen in his\r\nentry into this strange Other-World of his. He turned to hurry down into\r\nthe gorge, feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the sight of the\r\nthing that was happening in a room in a back street near the school.\r\nBoth of the people in the room he knew by sight. The windows were open,\r\nthe blinds up, and the setting sun shone clearly into it, so that it\r\ncame out quite brightly at first, a vivid oblong of room, lying like a\r\nmagic-lantern picture upon the black landscape and the livid green dawn.\r\nIn addition to the sunlight, a candle had just been lit in the room.\r\n\r\nOn the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon the\r\ntumbled pillow. His clenched hands were raised above his head. A little\r\ntable beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some toast and\r\nwater, and an empty glass. Every now and then the lank man’s lips fell\r\napart, to indicate a word he could not articulate. But the woman did not\r\nnotice that he wanted anything, because she was busy turning out papers\r\nfrom an old-fashioned bureau in the opposite corner of the room. At\r\nfirst the picture was very vivid indeed, but as the green dawn behind it\r\ngrew brighter and brighter, so it became fainter and more and more\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nAs the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps that\r\nsound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, Plattner\r\nperceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering together\r\nout of the darkness and watching the two people in the room. Never\r\nbefore had he seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A multitude\r\nhad eyes only for the sufferer in the room, another multitude, in\r\ninfinite anguish, watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for\r\nsomething she could not find. They crowded about Plattner, they came\r\nacross his sight and buffeted his face, the noise of their unavailing\r\nregrets was all about him. He saw clearly only now and then. At other\r\ntimes the picture quivered dimly, through the veil of green reflections\r\nupon their movements. In the room it must have been very still, and\r\nPlattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly vertical\r\nline of smoke, but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat like a\r\nclap of thunder. And the faces! Two, more particularly near the woman’s:\r\none a woman’s also, white and clear-featured, a face which might have\r\nonce been cold and hard, but which was now softened by the touch of a\r\nwisdom strange to earth. The other might have been the woman’s father.\r\nBoth were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful\r\nmeanness, so it seemed, which they could no longer guard against and\r\nprevent. Behind were others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill,\r\nfriends whose influence had failed. And over the man, too—a multitude,\r\nbut none that seemed to be parents or teachers! Faces that might once\r\nhave been coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And in the forefront\r\none face, a girlish one, neither angry nor remorseful, but merely\r\npatient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief.\r\nHis powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of\r\nghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke of the bell. He saw\r\nthem all in the space of a second. It would seem that he was so worked\r\non by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless fingers\r\ntook the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before\r\nhim. But he does not remember that.\r\n\r\nAbruptly the footsteps ceased. He waited for the next, and there was\r\nsilence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected stillness\r\nlike a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell. At that the\r\nmultitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began all\r\nabout him. The woman did not hear; she was burning something now in the\r\ncandle flame. At the second stroke everything grew dim, and a breath of\r\nwind, icy cold, blew through the host of watchers. They swirled about\r\nhim like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring, and at the third stroke\r\nsomething was extended through them to the bed. You have heard of a beam\r\nof light. This was like a beam of darkness, and looking again at it,\r\nPlattner saw that it was a shadowy arm and hand.\r\n\r\nThe green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, and\r\nthe vision of the room was very faint. Plattner could see that the white\r\nof the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman looked round\r\nover her shoulder at it, startled.\r\n\r\nThe cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before the\r\nwind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the gorge. Then\r\nsuddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the shadowy black arm that\r\nstretched across his shoulder and clutched its prey. He did not dare\r\nturn his head to see the Shadow behind the arm. With a violent effort,\r\nand covering his eyes, he set himself to run, made, perhaps, twenty\r\nstrides, then slipped on a boulder, and fell. He fell forward on his\r\nhands; and the bottle smashed and exploded as he touched the ground.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting face\r\nto face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere the story of Plattner’s experiences ends. I have resisted, I\r\nbelieve successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to\r\ndress up incidents of this sort. I have told the thing as far as\r\npossible in the order in which Plattner told it to me. I have carefully\r\navoided any attempt at style, effect, or construction. It would have\r\nbeen easy, for instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed into\r\na kind of plot in which Plattner might have been involved. But, quite\r\napart from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true\r\nstory, any such trite devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar\r\neffect of this dark world, with its livid green illumination and its\r\ndrifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen and unapproachable to us,\r\nis yet lying all about us.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add, that a death did actually occur in Vincent Terrace,\r\njust beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved, at the\r\nmoment of Plattner’s return. Deceased was a rate-collector and insurance\r\nagent. His widow, who was much younger than himself, married last month\r\na Mr. Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the portion of\r\nthis story given here has in various forms circulated orally in\r\nSussexville, she has consented to my use of her name, on condition that\r\nI make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every\r\ndetail of Plattner’s account of her husband’s last moments. She burnt no\r\nwill, she says, although Plattner never accused her of doing so; her\r\nhusband made but one will, and that just after their marriage.\r\nCertainly, from a man who had never seen it, Plattner’s account of the\r\nfurniture of the room was curiously accurate.\r\n\r\nOne other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must\r\ninsist upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view.\r\nPlattner’s absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved. But\r\nthat does not prove his story. It is quite conceivable that even outside\r\nspace hallucinations may be possible. That, at least, the reader must\r\nbear distinctly in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE ARGONAUTS OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne saw Monson’s flying-machine from the windows of the trains passing\r\neither along the South-Western main line or along the line between\r\nWimbledon and Worcester Park,—to be more exact, one saw the huge\r\nscaffoldings which limited the flight of the apparatus. They rose over\r\nthe tree-tops, a massive alley of interlacing iron and timber, and an\r\nenormous web of ropes and tackle, extending the best part of two miles.\r\nFrom the Leatherhead branch this alley was foreshortened and in part\r\nhidden by a hill with villas; but from the main line one had it in\r\nprofile, a complex tangle of girders and curving bars, very impressive\r\nto the excursionists from Portsmouth and Southampton and the West.\r\nMonson had taken up the work where Maxim had left it, had gone on at\r\nfirst with an utter contempt for the journalistic wit and ignorance that\r\nhad irritated and hampered his predecessor, and had spent (it was said)\r\nrather more than half his immense fortune upon his experiments. The\r\nresults, to an impatient generation, seemed inconsiderable. When some\r\nfive years had passed after the growth of the colossal iron groves at\r\nWorcester Park, and Monson still failed to put in a fluttering\r\nappearance over Trafalgar Square, even the Isle of Wight trippers felt\r\ntheir liberty to smile. And such intelligent people as did not consider\r\nMonson a fool stricken with the mania for invention, denounced him as\r\nbeing (for no particular reason) a self-advertising quack.\r\n\r\nYet now and again a morning trainload of season-ticket holders would see\r\na white monster rush headlong through the airy tracery of guides and\r\nbars, and hear the further stays, nettings, and buffers snap, creak, and\r\ngroan with the impact of the blow. Then there would be an efflorescence\r\nof black-set white-rimmed faces along the sides of the train, and the\r\nmorning papers would be neglected for a vigorous discussion of the\r\npossibility of flying (in which nothing new was ever said by any\r\nchance), until the train reached Waterloo, and its cargo of\r\nseason-ticket holders dispersed themselves over London. Or the fathers\r\nand mothers in some multitudinous train of weary excursionists returning\r\nexhausted from a day of rest by the sea, would find the dark fabric,\r\nstanding out against the evening sky, useful in diverting some bilious\r\nchild from its introspection, and be suddenly startled by the swift\r\ntransit of a huge black flapping shape that strained upward against the\r\nguides. It was a great and forcible thing beyond dispute, and excellent\r\nfor conversation; yet, all the same, it was but flying in\r\nleading-strings, and most of those who witnessed it scarcely counted its\r\nflight as flying. More of a switchback it seemed to the run of the folk.\r\n\r\nMonson, I say, did not trouble himself very keenly about the opinions of\r\nthe press at first. But possibly he, even, had formed but a poor idea of\r\nthe time it would take before the tactics of flying were mastered, the\r\nswift assured adjustment of the big soaring shape to every gust and\r\nchance movement of the air; nor had he clearly reckoned the money this\r\nprolonged struggle against gravitation would cost him. And he was not so\r\npachydermatous as he seemed. Secretly he had his periodical bundles of\r\ncuttings sent him by Romeike, he had his periodical reminders from his\r\nbanker; and if he did not mind the initial ridicule and scepticism, he\r\nfelt the growing neglect as the months went by and the money dribbled\r\naway. Time was when Monson had sent the enterprising journalist, keen\r\nafter readable matter, empty from his gates. But when the enterprising\r\njournalist ceased from troubling, Monson was anything but satisfied in\r\nhis heart of hearts. Still day by day the work went on, and the\r\nmultitudinous subtle difficulties of the steering diminished in number.\r\nDay by day, too, the money trickled away, until his balance was no\r\nlonger a matter of hundreds of thousands, but of tens. And at last came\r\nan anniversary.\r\n\r\nMonson, sitting in the little drawing-shed, suddenly noticed the date on\r\nWoodhouse’s calendar.\r\n\r\n“It was five years ago to-day that we began,” he said to Woodhouse\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n“It’s the alterations play the devil with us,” said Monson, biting a\r\npaper-fastener.\r\n\r\nThe drawings for the new vans to the hinder screw lay on the table\r\nbefore him as he spoke. He pitched the mutilated brass paper-fastener\r\ninto the waste-paper basket and drummed with his fingers. “These\r\nalterations! Will the mathematicians ever be clever enough to save us\r\nall this patching and experimenting. Five years—learning by rule of\r\nthumb, when one might think that it was possible to calculate the whole\r\nthing out beforehand. The cost of it! I might have hired three senior\r\nwranglers for life. But they’d only have developed some beautifully\r\nuseless theorems in pneumatics. What a time it has been, Woodhouse!”\r\n\r\n“These mouldings will take three weeks,” said Woodhouse. “At special\r\nprices.”\r\n\r\n“Three weeks!” said Monson, and sat drumming.\r\n\r\n“Three weeks certain,” said Woodhouse, an excellent engineer, but no\r\ngood as a comforter. He drew the sheets towards him and began shading a\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nMonson stopped drumming and began to bite his finger-nails, staring the\r\nwhile at Woodhouse’s head.\r\n\r\n“How long have they been calling this Monson’s Folly?” he said suddenly.\r\n\r\n“_Oh!_ Year or so,” said Woodhouse, carelessly, without looking up.\r\n\r\nMonson sucked the air in between his teeth, and went to the window. The\r\nstout iron columns carrying the elevated rails upon which the start of\r\nthe machine was made rose up close by, and the machine was hidden by the\r\nupper edge of the window. Through the grove of iron pillars, red painted\r\nand ornate with rows of bolts, one had a glimpse of the pretty scenery\r\ntowards Esher. A train went gliding noiselessly across the middle\r\ndistance, its rattle drowned by the hammering of the workmen overhead.\r\nMonson could imagine the grinning faces at the windows of the carriages.\r\nHe swore savagely under his breath, and dabbed viciously at a blowfly\r\nthat suddenly became noisy on the window-pane.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” said Woodhouse, staring in surprise at his employer.\r\n\r\n“I’m about sick of this.”\r\n\r\nWoodhouse scratched his cheek. “Oh!” he said, after an assimilating\r\npause. He pushed the drawing away from him.\r\n\r\n“Here these fools—I’m trying to conquer a new element—trying to do a\r\nthing that will revolutionise life. And instead of taking an intelligent\r\ninterest, they grin and make their stupid jokes, and call me and my\r\nappliances names.”\r\n\r\n“Asses!” said Woodhouse, letting his eye fall again on the drawing.\r\n\r\nThe epithet, curiously enough, made Monson wince. “I’m about sick of it,\r\nWoodhouse, anyhow,” he said, after a pause.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing for it but patience, I suppose,” said Monson, sticking\r\nhis hands in his pockets. “I’ve started. I’ve made my bed, and I’ve got\r\nto lie on it. I can’t go back. I’ll see it through, and spend every\r\npenny I have and every penny I can borrow. But I tell you, Woodhouse,\r\nI’m infernally sick of it, all the same. If I’d paid a tenth part of the\r\nmoney towards some political greaser’s expenses—I’d have been a baronet\r\nbefore this.”\r\n\r\nMonson paused. Woodhouse stared in front of him with a blank expression\r\nhe always employed to indicate sympathy, and tapped his pencil-case on\r\nthe table. Monson stared at him for a minute.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _damn_!” said Monson, suddenly, and abruptly rushed out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse continued his sympathetic rigour for perhaps half a minute.\r\nThen he sighed and resumed the shading of the drawings. Something had\r\nevidently upset Monson. Nice chap, and generous, but difficult to get on\r\nwith. It was the way with every amateur who had anything to do with\r\nengineering—wanted everything finished at once. But Monson had usually\r\nthe patience of the expert. Odd he was so irritable. Nice and round that\r\naluminium rod did look now! Woodhouse threw back his head, and put it,\r\nfirst this side and then that, to appreciate his bit of shading better.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Woodhouse,” said Hooper, the foreman of the labourers, putting his\r\nhead in at the door.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said Woodhouse, without turning round.\r\n\r\n“Nothing happened, sir?” said Hooper.\r\n\r\n“Happened?” said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n“The governor just been up the rails swearing like a tornader.”\r\n\r\n“_Oh!_” said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n“It ain’t like him, sir.”\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“And I was thinking perhaps—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t think,” said Woodhouse, still admiring the drawings.\r\n\r\nHooper knew Woodhouse, and he shut the door suddenly with a vicious\r\nslam. Woodhouse stared stonily before him for some further minutes, and\r\nthen made an ineffectual effort to pick his teeth with his pencil.\r\nAbruptly he desisted, pitched that old, tried, and stumpy servitor\r\nacross the room, got up, stretched himself, and followed Hooper.\r\n\r\nHe looked ruffled—it was visible to every workman he met. When a\r\nmillionaire who has been spending thousands on experiments that employ\r\nquite a little army of people suddenly indicates that he is sick of the\r\nundertaking, there is almost invariably a certain amount of mental\r\nfriction in the ranks of the little army he employs. And even before he\r\nindicates his intentions there are speculations and murmurs, a watching\r\nof faces and a study of straws. Hundreds of people knew before the day\r\nwas out that Monson was ruffled, Woodhouse ruffled, Hooper ruffled. A\r\nworkman’s wife, for instance (whom Monson had never seen), decided to\r\nkeep her money in the savings-bank instead of buying a velveteen dress.\r\nSo far-reaching are even the casual curses of a millionaire.\r\n\r\nMonson found a certain satisfaction in going on the works and behaving\r\ndisagreeably to as many people as possible. After a time even that\r\npalled upon him, and he rode off the grounds, to every one’s relief\r\nthere, and through the lanes south-eastward, to the infinite tribulation\r\nof his house steward at Cheam.\r\n\r\nAnd the immediate cause of it all, the little grain of annoyance\r\nthat had suddenly precipitated all this discontent with his\r\nlife-work was—these trivial things that direct all our great\r\ndecisions!—half a dozen ill-considered remarks made by a pretty\r\ngirl, prettily dressed, with a beautiful voice and something more\r\nthan prettiness in her soft grey eyes. And of these half-dozen\r\nremarks, two words especially—“Monson’s Folly.” She had felt she was\r\nbehaving charmingly to Monson; she reflected the next day how\r\nexceptionally effective she had been, and no one would have been\r\nmore amazed than she, had she learned the effect she had left on\r\nMonson’s mind. I hope, considering everything, that she never knew.\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on with your flying-machine?” she asked. (“I wonder\r\nif I shall ever meet any one with the sense not to ask that,” thought\r\nMonson.) “It will be very dangerous at first, will it not?” (“Thinks I’m\r\nafraid.”) “Jorgon is going to play presently; have you heard him\r\nbefore?” (“My mania being attended to, we turn to rational\r\nconversation.”) Gush about Jorgon; gradual decline of conversation,\r\nending with—“You must let me know when your flying-machine is finished,\r\nMr. Monson, and then I will consider the advisability of taking a\r\nticket.” (“One would think I was still playing inventions in the\r\nnursery.”) But the bitterest thing she said was not meant for Monson’s\r\nears. To Phlox, the novelist, she was always conscientiously brilliant.\r\n“I have been talking to Mr. Monson, and he can think of nothing,\r\npositively nothing, but that flying-machine of his. Do you know, all his\r\nworkmen call that place of his ‘Monson’s Folly’? He is quite impossible.\r\nIt is really very, very sad. I always regard him myself in the light of\r\nsunken treasure—the Lost Millionaire, you know.”\r\n\r\nShe was pretty and well educated,—indeed, she had written an\r\nepigrammatic novelette; but the bitterness was that she was typical. She\r\nsummarised what the world thought of the man who was working sanely,\r\nsteadily, and surely towards a more tremendous revolution in the\r\nappliances of civilisation, a more far-reaching alteration in the ways\r\nof humanity than has ever been effected since history began. They did\r\nnot even take him seriously. In a little while he would be proverbial.\r\n“I must fly now,” he said on his way home, smarting with a sense of\r\nabsolute social failure. “I _must_ fly soon. If it doesn’t come off\r\nsoon, by God! I shall run amuck.”\r\n\r\nHe said that before he had gone through his pass-book and his litter of\r\npapers. Inadequate as the cause seems, it was that girl’s voice and the\r\nexpression of her eyes that precipitated his discontent. But certainly\r\nthe discovery that he had no longer even one hundred thousand pounds’\r\nworth of realisable property behind him was the poison that made the\r\nwound deadly.\r\n\r\nIt was the next day after this that he exploded upon Woodhouse and his\r\nworkmen, and thereafter his bearing was consistently grim for three\r\nweeks, and anxiety dwelt in Cheam and Ewell, Malden, Morden, and\r\nWorcester Park, places that had thriven mightily on his experiments.\r\n\r\nFour weeks after that first swearing of his, he stood with Woodhouse by\r\nthe reconstructed machine as it lay across the elevated railway, by\r\nmeans of which it gained its initial impetus. The new propeller\r\nglittered a brighter white than the rest of the machine, and a gilder,\r\nobedient to a whim of Monson’s, was picking out the aluminium bars with\r\ngold. And looking down the long avenue between the ropes (gilded now\r\nwith the sunset), one saw red signals, and two miles away an anthill of\r\nworkmen busy altering the last falls of the run into a rising slope.\r\n\r\n“I’ll _come_,” said Woodhouse. “I’ll come right enough. But I tell you\r\nit’s infernally foolhardy. If only you would give another year—”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I won’t. I tell you the thing works. I’ve given years\r\nenough—”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” said Woodhouse. “We’re all right with the machine. But\r\nit’s the steering—”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t I been rushing, night and morning, backwards and forwards,\r\nthrough this squirrel’s cage? If the thing steers true here, it will\r\nsteer true all across England. It’s just funk, I tell you, Woodhouse. We\r\ncould have gone a year ago. And besides—”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n“The money!” snapped Monson, over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Hang it! I never thought of the money,” said Woodhouse, and then,\r\nspeaking now in a very different tone to that with which he had said the\r\nwords before, he repeated, “I’ll come. Trust me.”\r\n\r\nMonson turned suddenly, and saw all that Woodhouse had not the dexterity\r\nto say, shining on his sunset-lit face. He looked for a moment, then\r\nimpulsively extended his hand. “Thanks,” he said.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Woodhouse, gripping the hand, and with a queer\r\nsoftening of his features. “Trust me.”\r\n\r\nThen both men turned to the big apparatus that lay with its flat wings\r\nextended upon the carrier, and stared at it meditatively. Monson, guided\r\nperhaps by a photographic study of the flight of birds, and by\r\nLilienthal’s methods, had gradually drifted from Maxim’s shapes towards\r\nthe bird form again. The thing, however, was driven by a huge screw\r\nbehind in the place of the tail; and so hovering, which needs an almost\r\nvertical adjustment of a flat tail, was rendered impossible. The body of\r\nthe machine was small, almost cylindrical, and pointed. Forward and aft\r\non the pointed ends were two small petroleum engines for the screw, and\r\nthe navigators sat deep in a canoe-like recess, the foremost one\r\nsteering, and being protected by a low screen, with two plate-glass\r\nwindows, from the blinding rush of air. On either side a monstrous flat\r\nframework with a curved front border could be adjusted so as either to\r\nlie horizontally, or to be tilted upward or down. These wings worked\r\nrigidly together, or, by releasing a pin, one could be tilted through a\r\nsmall angle independently of its fellow. The front edge of either wing\r\ncould also be shifted back so as to diminish the wing-area about\r\none-sixth. The machine was not only not designed to hover, but it was\r\nalso incapable of fluttering. Monson’s idea was to get into the air with\r\nthe initial rush of the apparatus, and then to skim, much as a\r\nplayingcard may be skimmed, keeping up the rush by means of the screw at\r\nthe stern. Rooks and gulls fly enormous distances in that way with\r\nscarcely a perceptible movement of the wings. The bird really drives\r\nalong on an aërial switchback. It glides slanting downward for a space,\r\nuntil it has gained considerable momentum, and then altering the\r\ninclination of its wings, glides up again almost to its original\r\naltitude. Even a Londoner who has watched the birds in the aviary in\r\nRegent’s Park knows that.\r\n\r\nBut the bird is practising this art from the moment it leaves its nest.\r\nIt has not only the perfect apparatus, but the perfect instinct to use\r\nit. A man off his feet has the poorest skill in balancing. Even the\r\nsimple trick of the bicycle costs him some hours of labour. The\r\ninstantaneous adjustments of the wings, the quick response to a passing\r\nbreeze, the swift recovery of equilibrium, the giddy, eddying movements\r\nthat require such absolute precision—all that he must learn, learn with\r\ninfinite labour and infinite danger, if ever he is to conquer flying.\r\nThe flying-machine that will start off some fine day, driven by neat\r\n“little levers,” with a nice open deck like a liner, and all loaded up\r\nwith bomb-shells and guns, is the easy dreaming of a literary man. In\r\nlives and in treasure the cost of the conquest of the empire of the air\r\nmay even exceed all that has been spent in man’s great conquest of the\r\nsea. Certainly it will be costlier than the greatest war that has ever\r\ndevastated the world.\r\n\r\nNo one knew these things better than these two practical men. And they\r\nknew they were in the front rank of the coming army. Yet there is hope\r\neven in a forlorn hope. Men are killed outright in the reserves\r\nsometimes, while others who have been left for dead in the thickest\r\ncorner crawl out and survive.\r\n\r\n“If we miss these meadows—” said Woodhouse, presently in his slow way.\r\n\r\n“My dear chap,” said Monson, whose spirits had been rising fitfully\r\nduring the last few days, “we mustn’t miss these meadows. There’s a\r\nquarter of a square mile for us to hit, fences removed, ditches\r\nlevelled. We shall come down all right—rest assured. And if we don’t—”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Woodhouse. “If we don’t!”\r\n\r\nBefore the day of the start, the newspaper people got wind of the\r\nalterations at the northward end of the framework, and Monson was\r\ncheered by a decided change in the comments Romeike forwarded him. “He\r\nwill be off some day,” said the papers. “He will be off some day,” said\r\nthe South-Western season-ticket holders one to another; the seaside\r\nexcursionists, the Saturday-to-Monday trippers from Sussex and Hampshire\r\nand Dorset and Devon, the eminent literary people from Hazlemere, all\r\nremarked eagerly one to another, “He will be off some day,” as the\r\nfamiliar scaffolding came in sight. And actually, one bright morning, in\r\nfull view of the ten-past-ten train from Basingstoke, Monson’s\r\nflying-machine started on its journey.\r\n\r\nThey saw the carrier running swiftly along its rail, and the\r\nwhite-and-gold screw spinning in the air. They heard the rapid rumble of\r\nwheels, and a thud as the carrier reached the buffers at the end of its\r\nrun. Then a whirr as the flying-machine was shot forward into the\r\nnetworks. All that the majority of them had seen and heard before. The\r\nthing went with a drooping flight through the framework and rose again,\r\nand then every beholder shouted, or screamed, or yelled, or shrieked\r\nafter his kind. For instead of the customary concussion and stoppage,\r\nthe flying-machine flew out of its five years’ cage like a bolt from a\r\ncrossbow, and drove slantingly upward into the air, curved round a\r\nlittle, so as to cross the line, and soared in the direction of\r\nWimbledon Common.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to hang momentarily in the air and grow smaller, then it\r\nducked and vanished over the clustering blue tree-tops to the east of\r\nCoombe Hill, and no one stopped staring and gasping until long after it\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nThat was what the people in the train from Basingstoke saw. If you had\r\ndrawn a line down the middle of that train, from engine to guard’s van,\r\nyou would not have found a living soul on the opposite side to the\r\nflying-machine. It was a mad rush from window to window as the thing\r\ncrossed the line. And the engine-driver and stoker never took their eyes\r\noff the low hills about Wimbledon, and never noticed that they had run\r\nclean through Coombe and Malden and Raynes Park, until, with returning\r\nanimation, they found themselves pelting, at the most indecent pace,\r\ninto Wimbledon station.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when Monson had started the carrier with a “_Now!_”\r\nneither he nor Woodhouse said a word. Both men sat with clenched teeth.\r\nMonson had crossed the line with a curve that was too sharp, and\r\nWoodhouse had opened and shut his white lips; but neither spoke.\r\nWoodhouse simply gripped his seat, and breathed sharply through his\r\nteeth, watching the blue country to the west rushing past, and down, and\r\naway from him. Monson knelt at his post forward, and his hands trembled\r\non the spoked wheel that moved the wings. He could see nothing before\r\nhim but a mass of white clouds in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe machine went slanting upward, travelling with an enormous speed\r\nstill, but losing momentum every moment. The land ran away underneath\r\nwith diminishing speed.\r\n\r\n“_Now!_” said Woodhouse at last, and with a violent effort Monson\r\nwrenched over the wheel and altered the angle of the wings. The machine\r\nseemed to hang for half a minute motionless in mid-air, and then he saw\r\nthe hazy blue house-covered hills of Kilburn and Hampstead jump up\r\nbefore his eyes and rise steadily, until the little sunlit dome of the\r\nAlbert Hall appeared through his windows. For a moment he scarcely\r\nunderstood the meaning of this upward rush of the horizon, but as the\r\nnearer and nearer houses came into view, he realised what he had done.\r\nHe had turned the wings over too far, and they were swooping steeply\r\ndownward towards the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe thought, the question, the realisation were all the business of a\r\nsecond of time. “Too much!” gasped Woodhouse. Monson brought the wheel\r\nhalf-way back with a jerk, and forthwith the Kilburn and Hampstead ridge\r\ndropped again to the lower edge of his windows. They had been a thousand\r\nfeet above Coombe and Malden station; fifty seconds after they whizzed,\r\nat a frightful pace, not eighty feet above the East Putney station, on\r\nthe Metropolitan District line, to the screaming astonishment of a\r\nplatform full of people. Monson flung up the vans against the air, and\r\nover Fulham they rushed up their atmospheric switchback again,\r\nsteeply—too steeply. The ’busses went floundering across the Fulham\r\nRoad, the people yelled.\r\n\r\nThen down again, too steeply still, and the distant trees and houses\r\nabout Primrose Hill leapt up across Monson’s window, and then suddenly\r\nhe saw straight before him the greenery of Kensington Gardens and the\r\ntowers of the Imperial Institute. They were driving straight down upon\r\nSouth Kensington. The pinnacles of the Natural History Museum rushed up\r\ninto view. There came one fatal second of swift thought, a moment of\r\nhesitation. Should he try and clear the towers, or swerve eastward?\r\n\r\nHe made a hesitating attempt to release the right wing, left the catch\r\nhalf released, and gave a frantic clutch at the wheel.\r\n\r\nThe nose of the machine seemed to leap up before him. The wheel pressed\r\nhis hand with irresistible force, and jerked itself out of his control.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse, sitting crouched together, gave a hoarse cry, and sprang up\r\ntowards Monson. “Too far!” he cried, and then he was clinging to the\r\ngunwale for dear life, and Monson had been jerked clean overhead, and\r\nwas falling backwards upon him.\r\n\r\nSo swiftly had the thing happened that barely a quarter of the people\r\ngoing to and fro in Hyde Park, and Brompton Road, and the Exhibition\r\nRoad saw anything of the aërial catastrophe. A distant winged shape had\r\nappeared above the clustering houses to the south, had fallen and risen,\r\ngrowing larger as it did so; had swooped swiftly down towards the\r\nImperial Institute, a broad spread of flying wings, had swept round in a\r\nquarter circle, dashed eastward, and then suddenly sprang vertically\r\ninto the air. A black object shot out of it, and came spinning downward.\r\nA man! Two men clutching each other! They came whirling down, separated\r\nas they struck the roof of the Students’ Club, and bounded off into the\r\ngreen bushes on its southward side.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps half a minute, the pointed stem of the big machine still\r\npierced vertically upward, the screw spinning desperately. For one brief\r\ninstant, that yet seemed an age to all who watched, it had hung\r\nmotionless in mid-air. Then a spout of yellow flame licked up its length\r\nfrom the stern engine, and swift, swifter, swifter, and flaring like a\r\nrocket, it rushed down upon the solid mass of masonry which was formerly\r\nthe Royal College of Science. The big screw of white and gold touched\r\nthe parapet, and crumpled up like wet linen. Then the blazing\r\nspindle-shaped body smashed and splintered, smashing and splintering in\r\nits fall, upon the north-westward angle of the building.\r\n\r\nBut the crash, the flame of blazing paraffin that shot heavenward from\r\nthe shattered engines of the machine, the crushed horrors that were\r\nfound in the garden beyond the Students’ Club, the masses of yellow\r\nparapet and red brick that fell headlong into the roadway, the running\r\nto and fro of people like ants in a broken anthill, the galloping of\r\nfire-engines, the gathering of crowds—all these things do not belong to\r\nthis story, which was written only to tell how the first of all\r\nsuccessful flying-machines was launched and flew. Though he failed, and\r\nfailed disastrously, the record of Monson’s work remains—a sufficient\r\nmonument—to guide the next of that band of gallant experimentalists who\r\nwill sooner or later master this great problem of flying. And between\r\nWorcester Park and Malden there still stands that portentous avenue of\r\niron-work, rusting now, and dangerous here and there, to witness to the\r\nfirst desperate struggle for man’s right of way through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE STORY OF THE LATE MR. ELVESHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nI set this story down, not expecting it will be believed, but, if\r\npossible, to prepare a way of escape for the next victim. He, perhaps,\r\nmay profit by my misfortune. My own case, I know, is hopeless, and I am\r\nnow in some measure prepared to meet my fate.\r\n\r\nMy name is Edward George Eden. I was born at Trentham, in Staffordshire,\r\nmy father being employed in the gardens there. I lost my mother when I\r\nwas three years old, and my father when I was five, my uncle, George\r\nEden, then adopting me as his own son. He was a single man,\r\nself-educated, and well known in Birmingham as an enterprising\r\njournalist; he educated me generously, fired my ambition to succeed in\r\nthe world, and at his death, which happened four years ago, left me his\r\nentire fortune, a matter of about five hundred pounds after all outgoing\r\ncharges were paid. I was then eighteen. He advised me in his will to\r\nexpend the money in completing my education. I had already chosen the\r\nprofession of medicine, and through his posthumous generosity, and my\r\ngood fortune in a scholarship competition, I became a medical student at\r\nUniversity College, London. At the time of the beginning of my story I\r\nlodged at 11A University Street, in a little upper room, very shabbily\r\nfurnished, and draughty, overlooking the back of Shoolbred’s premises. I\r\nused this little room both to live in and sleep in, because I was\r\nanxious to eke out my means to the very last shillingsworth.\r\n\r\nI was taking a pair of shoes to be mended at a shop in the Tottenham\r\nCourt Road when I first encountered the little old man with the yellow\r\nface, with whom my life has now become so inextricably entangled. He was\r\nstanding on the kerb, and staring at the number on the door in a\r\ndoubtful way, as I opened it. His eyes—they were dull grey eyes, and\r\nreddish under the rims—fell to my face, and his countenance immediately\r\nassumed an expression of corrugated amiability.\r\n\r\n“You come,” he said, “apt to the moment. I had forgotten the number of\r\nyour house. How do you do, Mr. Eden?”\r\n\r\nI was a little astonished at his familiar address, for I had never set\r\neyes on the man before. I was a little annoyed, too, at his catching me\r\nwith my boots under my arm. He noticed my lack of cordiality.\r\n\r\n“Wonder who the deuce I am, eh? A friend, let me assure you. I have seen\r\nyou before, though you haven’t seen me. Is there anywhere where I can\r\ntalk to you?”\r\n\r\nI hesitated. The shabbiness of my room upstairs was not a matter for\r\nevery stranger. “Perhaps,” said I, “we might walk down the street. I’m\r\nunfortunately prevented—” My gesture explained the sentence before I had\r\nspoken it.\r\n\r\n“The very thing,” he said, and faced this way and then that. “The\r\nstreet? Which way shall we go?” I slipped my boots down in the passage.\r\n“Look here!” he said abruptly; “this business of mine is a rigmarole.\r\nCome and lunch with me, Mr. Eden. I’m an old man, a very old man, and\r\nnot good at explanations, and what with my piping voice and the clatter\r\nof the traffic—”\r\n\r\nHe laid a persuasive, skinny hand that trembled a little upon my arm.\r\n\r\nI was not so old that an old man might not treat me to a lunch. Yet at\r\nthe same time I was not altogether pleased by this abrupt invitation. “I\r\nhad rather—” I began. “But _I_ had rather,” he said, catching me up,\r\n“and a certain civility is surely due to my grey hairs.” And so I\r\nconsented, and went with him.\r\n\r\nHe took me to Blavitski’s; I had to walk slowly to accommodate myself to\r\nhis paces; and over such a lunch as I had never tasted before, he fended\r\noff my leading questions, and I took a better note of his appearance.\r\nHis clean-shaven face was lean and wrinkled, his shrivelled lips fell\r\nover a set of false teeth, and his white hair was thin and rather long;\r\nhe seemed small to me,—though, indeed, most people seemed small to\r\nme,—and his shoulders were rounded and bent. And watching him, I could\r\nnot help but observe that he too was taking note of me, running his\r\neyes, with a curious touch of greed in them, over me, from my broad\r\nshoulders to my sun-tanned hands, and up to my freckled face again. “And\r\nnow,” said he, as we lit our cigarettes, “I must tell you of the\r\nbusiness in hand.\r\n\r\n“I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a very old man.” He paused\r\nmomentarily. “And it happens that I have money that I must presently be\r\nleaving, and never a child have I to leave it to.” I thought of the\r\nconfidence trick, and resolved I would be on the alert for the vestiges\r\nof my five hundred pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness,\r\nand the trouble he had to find a proper disposition of his money. “I\r\nhave weighed this plan and that plan, charities, institutions, and\r\nscholarships, and libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at\r\nlast,”—he fixed his eyes on my face,—“that I will find some young\r\nfellow, ambitious, pure-minded, and poor, healthy in body and healthy in\r\nmind, and, in short, make him my heir, give him all that I have.” He\r\nrepeated, “Give him all that I have. So that he will suddenly be lifted\r\nout of all the trouble and struggle in which his sympathies have been\r\neducated, to freedom and influence.”\r\n\r\nI tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent hypocrisy, I said,\r\n“And you want my help, my professional services, maybe, to find that\r\nperson.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled, and looked at me over his cigarette, and I laughed at his\r\nquiet exposure of my modest pretence.\r\n\r\n“What a career such a man might have!” he said. “It fills me with envy\r\nto think how I have accumulated that another man may spend—\r\n\r\n“But there are conditions, of course, burdens to be imposed. He must,\r\nfor instance, take my name. You cannot expect everything without some\r\nreturn. And I must go into all the circumstances of his life before I\r\ncan accept him. He _must_ be sound. I must know his heredity, how his\r\nparents and grandparents died, have the strictest inquiries made into\r\nhis private morals—”\r\n\r\nThis modified my secret congratulations a little. “And do I understand,”\r\nsaid I, “that I—?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, almost fiercely. “You. _You._”\r\n\r\nI answered never a word. My imagination was dancing wildly, my innate\r\nscepticism was useless to modify its transports. There was not a\r\nparticle of gratitude in my mind—I did not know what to say nor how to\r\nsay it. “But why me in particular?” I said at last.\r\n\r\nHe had chanced to hear of me from Professor Haslar, he said, as a\r\ntypically sound and sane young man, and he wished, as far as possible,\r\nto leave his money where health and integrity were assured.\r\n\r\nThat was my first meeting with the little old man. He was mysterious\r\nabout himself; he would not give his name yet, he said, and after I had\r\nanswered some questions of his, he left me at the Blavitski portal. I\r\nnoticed that he drew a handful of gold coins from his pocket when it\r\ncame to paying for the lunch. His insistence upon bodily health was\r\ncurious. In accordance with an arrangement we had made I applied that\r\nday for a life policy in the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum,\r\nand I was exhaustively overhauled by the medical advisers of that\r\ncompany in the subsequent week. Even that did not satisfy him, and he\r\ninsisted I must be re-examined by the great Dr. Henderson. It was Friday\r\nin Whitsun week before he came to a decision. He called me down, quite\r\nlate in the evening,—nearly nine it was,—from cramming chemical\r\nequations for my Preliminary Scientific examination. He was standing in\r\nthe passage under the feeble gas lamp, and his face was a grotesque\r\ninterplay of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when I had first seen\r\nhim, and his cheeks had sunk in a little.\r\n\r\nHis voice shook with emotion. “Everything is satisfactory, Mr. Eden,” he\r\nsaid. “Everything is quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all\r\nnights, you must dine with me and celebrate your—accession.” He was\r\ninterrupted by a cough. “You won’t have long to wait, either,” he said,\r\nwiping his handkerchief across his lips, and gripping my hand with his\r\nlong bony claw that was disengaged. “Certainly not very long to wait.”\r\n\r\nWe went into the street and called a cab. I remember every incident of\r\nthat drive vividly, the swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas,\r\nand oil, and electric light, the crowds of people in the streets, the\r\nplace in Regent Street to which we went, and the sumptuous dinner we\r\nwere served there. I was disconcerted at first by the well-dressed\r\nwaiters’ glances at my rough clothes, bothered by the stones of the\r\nolives, but as the champagne warmed my blood, my confidence revived. At\r\nfirst the old man talked of himself. He had already told me his name in\r\nthe cab; he was Egbert Elvesham, the great philosopher, whose name I had\r\nknown since I was a lad at school. It seemed incredible to me that this\r\nman, whose intelligence had so early dominated mine, this great\r\nabstraction, should suddenly realise itself as this decrepit, familiar\r\nfigure. I daresay every young fellow who has suddenly fallen among\r\ncelebrities has felt something of my disappointment. He told me now of\r\nthe future that the feeble streams of his life would presently leave dry\r\nfor me, houses, copyrights, investments; I had never suspected that\r\nphilosophers were so rich. He watched me drink and eat with a touch of\r\nenvy. “What a capacity for living you have!” he said; and then, with a\r\nsigh, a sigh of relief I could have thought it, “It will not be long.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said I, my head swimming now with champagne; “I have a future\r\nperhaps—of a passing agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have the\r\nhonour of your name. But you have a past. Such a past as is worth all my\r\nfuture.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head and smiled, as I thought, with half-sad appreciation\r\nof my flattering admiration. “That future,” he said, “would you in truth\r\nchange it?” The waiter came with liqueurs. “You will not perhaps mind\r\ntaking my name, taking my position, but would you indeed—willingly—take\r\nmy years?”\r\n\r\n“With your achievements,” said I, gallantly.\r\n\r\nHe smiled again. “Kummel—both,” he said to the waiter, and turned his\r\nattention to a little paper packet he had taken from his pocket. “This\r\nhour,” said he, “this after-dinner hour is the hour of small things.\r\nHere is a scrap of my unpublished wisdom.” He opened the packet with his\r\nshaking yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder on the paper.\r\n“This,” said he—“well, you must guess what it is. But Kummel—put but a\r\ndash of this powder in it—is Himmel.” His large greyish eyes watched\r\nmine with an inscrutable expression.\r\n\r\nIt was a bit of a shock to me to find this great teacher gave his mind\r\nto the flavour of liqueurs. However, I feigned a great interest in his\r\nweakness, for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.\r\n\r\nHe parted the powder between the little glasses, and, rising suddenly,\r\nwith a strange, unexpected dignity, held out his hand towards me. I\r\nimitated his action, and the glasses rang. “To a quick succession,” said\r\nhe, and raised his glass towards his lips.\r\n\r\n“Not that,” I said hastily. “Not that.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, with the liqueur at the level of his chin, and his eyes\r\nblazing into mine.\r\n\r\n“To a long life,” said I.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. “To a long life,” said he, with a sudden bark of laughter,\r\nand with eyes fixed on one another we tilted the little glasses. His\r\neyes looked straight into mine, and as I drained the stuff off, I felt a\r\ncuriously intense sensation. The first touch of it set my brain in a\r\nfurious tumult; I seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my\r\nskull, and a seething humming filled my ears. I did not notice the\r\nflavour in my mouth, the aroma that filled my throat; I saw only the\r\ngrey intensity of his gaze that burnt into mine. The draught, the mental\r\nconfusion, the noise and stirring in my head, seemed to last an\r\ninterminable time. Curious vague impressions of half-forgotten things\r\ndanced and vanished on the edge of my consciousness. At last he broke\r\nthe spell. With a sudden explosive sigh he put down his glass.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s glorious,” said I, though I had not tasted the stuff.\r\n\r\nMy head was spinning. I sat down. My brain was chaos. Then my perception\r\ngrew clear and minute as though I saw things in a concave mirror. His\r\nmanner seemed to have changed into something nervous and hasty. He\r\npulled out his watch and grimaced at it. “Eleven-seven! And to-night I\r\nmust—Seven—twenty-five. Waterloo! I must go at once.” He called for the\r\nbill, and struggled with his coat. Officious waiters came to our\r\nassistance. In another moment I was wishing him good-bye, over the apron\r\nof a cab, and still with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness, as\r\nthough—how can I express it?—I not only saw but _felt_ through an\r\ninverted opera-glass.\r\n\r\n“That stuff,” he said. He put his hand to his forehead. “I ought not to\r\nhave given it to you. It will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a\r\nminute. Here.” He handed me out a little flat thing like a\r\nseidlitz-powder. “Take that in water as you are going to bed. The other\r\nthing was a drug. Not till you’re ready to go to bed, mind. It will\r\nclear your head. That’s all. One more shake—Futurus!”\r\n\r\nI gripped his shrivelled claw. “Good-bye,” he said, and by the droop of\r\nhis eyelids I judged he too was a little under the influence of that\r\nbrain-twisting cordial.\r\n\r\nHe recollected something else with a start, felt in his breast-pocket,\r\nand produced another packet, this time a cylinder the size and shape of\r\na shaving-stick. “Here,” said he. “I’d almost forgotten. Don’t open this\r\nuntil I come to-morrow—but take it now.”\r\n\r\nIt was so heavy that I well-nigh dropped it. “All ri’!” said I, and he\r\ngrinned at me through the cab-window as the cabman flicked his horse\r\ninto wakefulness. It was a white packet he had given me, with red seals\r\nat either end and along its edge. “If this isn’t money,” said I, “it’s\r\nplatinum or lead.”\r\n\r\nI stuck it with elaborate care into my pocket, and with a whirling brain\r\nwalked home through the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back\r\nstreets beyond Portland Road. I remember the sensations of that walk\r\nvery vividly, strange as they were. I was still so far myself that I\r\ncould notice my strange mental state, and wonder whether this stuff I\r\nhad had was opium—a drug beyond my experience. It is hard now to\r\ndescribe the peculiarity of my mental strangeness—mental doubling\r\nvaguely expresses it. As I was walking up Regent Street I found in my\r\nmind a queer persuasion that it was Waterloo station, and had an odd\r\nimpulse to get into the Polytechnic as a man might get into a train. I\r\nput a knuckle in my eye, and it was Regent Street. How can I express it?\r\nYou see a skilful actor looking quietly at you, he pulls a grimace, and\r\nlo!—another person. Is it too extravagant if I tell you that it seemed\r\nto me as if Regent Street had, for the moment, done that? Then, being\r\npersuaded it was Regent Street again, I was oddly muddled about some\r\nfantastic reminiscences that cropped up. “Thirty years ago,” thought I,\r\n“it was here that I quarrelled with my brother.” Then I burst out\r\nlaughing, to the astonishment and encouragement of a group of night\r\nprowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and never in my life had I\r\nboasted a brother. The stuff was surely liquid folly, for the poignant\r\nregret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along Portland Road the\r\nmadness took another turn. I began to recall vanished shops, and to\r\ncompare the street with what it used to be. Confused, troubled thinking\r\nis comprehensible enough after the drink I had taken, but what puzzled\r\nme were these curiously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into my\r\nmind, and not only the memories that had crept in, but also the memories\r\nthat had slipped out. I stopped opposite Stevens’, the natural history\r\ndealer’s, and cudgelled my brains to think what he had to do with me. A\r\n‘bus went by, and sounded exactly like the rumbling of a train. I seemed\r\nto be dipped into some dark, remote pit for the recollection. “Of\r\ncourse,” said I, at last, “he has promised me three frogs to-morrow. Odd\r\nI should have forgotten.”\r\n\r\nDo they still show children dissolving views? In those I remember one\r\nview would begin like a faint ghost, and grow and oust another. In just\r\nthat way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sensations was\r\nstruggling with those of my ordinary self.\r\n\r\nI went on through Euston Road to Tottenham Court Road, puzzled, and a\r\nlittle frightened, and scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking,\r\nfor commonly I used to cut through the intervening network of back\r\nstreets. I turned into University Street, to discover that I had\r\nforgotten my number. Only by a strong effort did I recall 11A, and even\r\nthen it seemed to me that it was a thing some forgotten person had told\r\nme. I tried to steady my mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner,\r\nand for the life of me I could conjure up no picture of my host’s face;\r\nI saw him only as a shadowy outline, as one might see oneself reflected\r\nin a window through which one was looking. In his place, however, I had\r\na curious exterior vision of myself sitting at a table, flushed,\r\nbright-eyed, and talkative.\r\n\r\n“I must take this other powder,” said I. “This is getting impossible.”\r\n\r\nI tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle and the matches, and\r\nhad a doubt of which landing my room might be on. “I’m drunk,” I said,\r\n“that’s certain,” and blundered needlessly on the staircase to sustain\r\nthe proposition.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar. “What rot!” I said, and\r\nstared about me. I seemed to bring myself back by the effort, and the\r\nodd phantasmal quality passed into the concrete familiar. There was the\r\nold glass still, with my notes on the albumens stuck in the corner of\r\nthe frame, my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the floor. And\r\nyet it was not so real after all. I felt an idiotic persuasion trying to\r\ncreep into my mind, as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in a\r\ntrain just stopping, that I was peering out of the window at some\r\nunknown station. I gripped the bed-rail firmly to reassure myself. “It’s\r\nclairvoyance, perhaps,” I said. “I must write to the Psychical Research\r\nSociety.”\r\n\r\nI put the rouleau on my dressing-table, sat on my bed and began to take\r\noff my boots. It was as if the picture of my present sensations was\r\npainted over some other picture that was trying to show through. “Curse\r\nit!” said I; “my wits are going, or am I in two places at once?”\r\nHalf-undressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It\r\neffervesced, and became a fluorescent amber colour. Before I was in bed\r\nmy mind was already tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and\r\nthereupon I must have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke abruptly out of a dream of strange beasts, and found myself\r\nlying on my back. Probably every one knows that dismal, emotional dream\r\nfrom which one escapes, awake indeed, but strangely cowed. There was a\r\ncurious taste in my mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of\r\ncutaneous discomfort. I lay with my head motionless on my pillow,\r\nexpecting that my feeling of strangeness and terror would probably pass\r\naway, and that I should then doze off again to sleep. But instead of\r\nthat, my uncanny sensations increased. At first I could perceive nothing\r\nwrong about me. There was a faint light in the room, so faint that it\r\nwas the very next thing to darkness, and the furniture stood out in it\r\nas vague blots of absolute darkness. I stared with my eyes just over the\r\nbedclothes.\r\n\r\nIt came into my mind that some one had entered the room to rob me of my\r\nrouleau of money, but after lying for some moments, breathing regularly\r\nto simulate sleep, I realised this was mere fancy. Nevertheless, the\r\nuneasy assurance of something wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort\r\nI raised my head from the pillow, and peered about me at the dark. What\r\nit was I could not conceive. I looked at the dim shapes around me, the\r\ngreater and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains, table, fireplace,\r\nbookshelves, and so forth. Then I began to perceive something unfamiliar\r\nin the forms of the darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yonder should be\r\nthe bookshelves, and something shrouded and pallid rose there, something\r\nthat would not answer to the bookshelves, however I looked at it. It was\r\nfar too big to be my shirt thrown on a chair.\r\n\r\nOvercoming a childish terror, I threw back the bedclothes and thrust my\r\nleg out of bed. Instead of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor,\r\nI found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mattress. I made\r\nanother step, as it were, and sat up on the edge of the bed. By the side\r\nof my bed should be the candle, and the matches upon the broken chair. I\r\nput out my hand and touched—nothing. I waved my hand in the darkness,\r\nand it came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick in texture, which\r\ngave a rustling noise at my touch. I grasped this and pulled it; it\r\nappeared to be a curtain suspended over the head of my bed.\r\n\r\nI was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to realise that I was in a\r\nstrange room. I was puzzled. I tried to recall the overnight\r\ncircumstances, and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in my\r\nmemory: the supper, my reception of the little packages, my wonder\r\nwhether I was intoxicated, my slow undressing, the coolness to my\r\nflushed face of my pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that last\r\nnight, or the night before? At any rate, this room was strange to me,\r\nand I could not imagine how I had got into it. The dim, pallid outline\r\nwas growing paler, and I perceived it was a window, with the dark shape\r\nof an oval toilet-glass against the weak intimation of the dawn that\r\nfiltered through the blind. I stood up, and was surprised by a curious\r\nfeeling of weakness and unsteadiness. With trembling hands outstretched,\r\nI walked slowly towards the window, getting, nevertheless, a bruise on\r\nthe knee from a chair by the way. I fumbled round the glass, which was\r\nlarge, with handsome brass sconces, to find the blind-cord. I could not\r\nfind any. By chance I took hold of the tassel, and with the click of a\r\nspring the blind ran up.\r\n\r\nI found myself looking out upon a scene that was altogether strange to\r\nme. The night was overcast, and through the flocculent grey of the\r\nheaped clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn. Just at the\r\nedge of the sky, the cloud-canopy had a blood-red rim. Below, everything\r\nwas dark and indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague mass of\r\nbuildings running up into pinnacles, trees like spilt ink, and below the\r\nwindow a tracery of black bushes and pale grey paths. It was so\r\nunfamiliar that for the moment I thought myself still dreaming. I felt\r\nthe toilet-table; it appeared to be made of some polished wood, and was\r\nrather elaborately furnished—there were little cut-glass bottles and a\r\nbrush upon it. There was also a queer little object, horse-shoe-shaped\r\nit felt, with smooth, hard projections, lying in a saucer. I could find\r\nno matches nor candlestick.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes to the room again. Now the blind was up, faint spectres\r\nof its furnishing came out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained\r\nbed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white mantel with\r\nsomething of the shimmer of marble.\r\n\r\nI leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes and opened them again,\r\nand tried to think. The whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I was\r\ninclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in my memory, as a\r\nconsequence of my draught of that strange liqueur; that I had come into\r\nmy inheritance perhaps, and suddenly lost my recollection of everything\r\nsince my good fortune had been announced. Perhaps if I waited a little,\r\nthings would be clearer to me again. Yet my dinner with old Elvesham was\r\nnow singularly vivid and recent. The champagne, the observant waiters,\r\nthe powder, and the liqueurs—I could have staked my soul it all happened\r\na few hours ago.\r\n\r\nAnd then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so terrible to me that I\r\nshiver now to think of that moment. I spoke aloud. I said, “How the\r\ndevil did I get here?”—_And the voice was not my own._\r\n\r\nIt was not my own, it was thin, the articulation was slurred, the\r\nresonance of my facial bones was different. Then, to reassure myself, I\r\nran one hand over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony\r\nlaxity of age. “Surely,” I said, in that horrible voice that had somehow\r\nestablished itself in my throat, “surely this thing is a dream!” Almost\r\nas quickly as if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my fingers into my\r\nmouth. My teeth had gone. My finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of\r\nan even row of shrivelled gums. I was sick with dismay and disgust.\r\n\r\nI felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to realise at once in its\r\nfull horror the ghastly change that had come upon me. I tottered to the\r\nmantel, and felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking cough\r\nsprang up in my throat, and I clutched the thick flannel nightdress I\r\nfound about me. There were no matches there, and I suddenly realised\r\nthat my extremities were cold. Sniffing and coughing, whimpering, a\r\nlittle, perhaps, I fumbled back to bed. “It is surely a dream,” I\r\nwhimpered to myself as I clambered back, “surely a dream.” It was a\r\nsenile repetition. I pulled the bedclothes over my shoulders, over my\r\nears, I thrust my withered hand under the pillow, and determined to\r\ncompose myself to sleep. Of course it was a dream. In the morning the\r\ndream would be over, and I should wake up strong and vigorous again to\r\nmy youth and studies. I shut my eyes, breathed regularly, and, finding\r\nmyself wakeful, began to count slowly through the powers of three.\r\n\r\nBut the thing I desired would not come. I could not get to sleep. And\r\nthe persuasion of the inexorable reality of the change that had happened\r\nto me grew steadily. Presently I found myself with my eyes wide open,\r\nthe powers of three forgotten, and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled\r\ngums. I was, indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man. I had in some\r\nunaccountable manner fallen through my life and come to old age, in some\r\nway I had been cheated of all the best of my life, of love, of struggle,\r\nof strength, and hope. I grovelled into the pillow and tried to persuade\r\nmyself that such hallucination was possible. Imperceptibly, steadily,\r\nthe dawn grew clearer.\r\n\r\nAt last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in bed and looked about\r\nme. A chill twilight rendered the whole chamber visible. It was spacious\r\nand well-furnished, better furnished than any room I had ever slept in\r\nbefore. A candle and matches became dimly visible upon a little pedestal\r\nin a recess. I threw back the bedclothes, and, shivering with the\r\nrawness of the early morning, albeit it was summer-time, I got out and\r\nlit the candle. Then, trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher\r\nrattled on its spike, I tottered to the glass and saw—_Elvesham’s face_!\r\nIt was none the less horrible because I had already dimly feared as\r\nmuch. He had already seemed physically weak and pitiful to me, but seen\r\nnow, dressed only in a coarse flannel nightdress that fell apart and\r\nshowed the stringy neck, seen now as my own body, I cannot describe its\r\ndesolate decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the straggling tail of dirty\r\ngrey hair, the rheumy bleared eyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the\r\nlower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lining, and those horrible\r\ndark gums showing. You who are mind and body together, at your natural\r\nyears, cannot imagine what this fiendish imprisonment meant to me. To be\r\nyoung and full of the desire and energy of youth, and to be caught, and\r\npresently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a body....\r\n\r\nBut I wander from the course of my story. For some time I must have been\r\nstunned at this change that had come upon me. It was daylight when I did\r\nso far gather myself together as to think. In some inexplicable way I\r\nhad been changed, though how, short of magic, the thing had been done, I\r\ncould not say. And as I thought, the diabolical ingenuity of Elvesham\r\ncame home to me. It seemed plain to me that as I found myself in his, so\r\nhe must be in possession of _my_ body, of my strength, that is, and my\r\nfuture. But how to prove it? Then, as I thought, the thing became so\r\nincredible, even to me, that my mind reeled, and I had to pinch myself,\r\nto feel my toothless gums, to see myself in the glass, and touch the\r\nthings about me, before I could steady myself to face the facts again.\r\nWas all life hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and he me? Had I been\r\ndreaming of Eden overnight? Was there any Eden? But if I was Elvesham, I\r\nshould remember where I was on the previous morning, the name of the\r\ntown in which I lived, what happened before the dream began. I struggled\r\nwith my thoughts. I recalled the queer doubleness of my memories\r\novernight. But now my mind was clear. Not the ghost of any memories but\r\nthose proper to Eden could I raise.\r\n\r\n“This way lies insanity!” I cried in my piping voice. I staggered to my\r\nfeet, dragged my feeble, heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged\r\nmy grey head into a basin of cold water. Then, towelling myself, I tried\r\nagain. It was no good. I felt beyond all question that I was indeed\r\nEden, not Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham’s body.\r\n\r\nHad I been a man of any other age, I might have given myself up to my\r\nfate as one enchanted. But in these sceptical days miracles do not pass\r\ncurrent. Here was some trick of psychology. What a drug and a steady\r\nstare could do, a drug and a steady stare, or some similar treatment,\r\ncould surely undo. Men have lost their memories before. But to exchange\r\nmemories as one does umbrellas! I laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh,\r\nbut a wheezing, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elvesham\r\nlaughing at my plight, and a gust of petulant anger, unusual to me,\r\nswept across my feelings. I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I\r\nfound lying about on the floor, and only realised when I was dressed\r\nthat it was an evening suit I had assumed. I opened the wardrobe and\r\nfound some more ordinary clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and an\r\nold-fashioned dressing-gown. I put a venerable smoking-cap on my\r\nvenerable head, and, coughing a little from my exertions, tottered out\r\nupon the landing.\r\n\r\nIt was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the blinds were closely\r\ndrawn and the house quite silent. The landing was a spacious one, a\r\nbroad, richly-carpeted staircase went down into the darkness of the hall\r\nbelow, and before me a door ajar showed me a writing-desk, a revolving\r\nbookcase, the back of a study chair, and a fine array of bound books,\r\nshelf upon shelf.\r\n\r\n“My study,” I mumbled, and walked across the landing. Then at the sound\r\nof my voice a thought struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put\r\nin the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the ease of old habit.\r\n“That’s better,” said I, gnashing them, and so returned to the study.\r\n\r\nThe drawers of the writing-desk were locked. Its revolving top was also\r\nlocked. I could see no indications of the keys, and there were none in\r\nthe pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to the bedroom, and\r\nwent through the dress suit, and afterwards the pockets of all the\r\ngarments I could find. I was very eager, and one might have imagined\r\nthat burglars had been at work, to see my room when I had done. Not only\r\nwere there no keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of\r\npaper—save only the receipted bill of the overnight dinner.\r\n\r\nA curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down and stared at the\r\ngarments flung here and there, their pockets turned inside out. My first\r\nfrenzy had already flickered out. Every moment I was beginning to\r\nrealise the immense intelligence of the plans of my enemy, to see more\r\nand more clearly the hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose\r\nand hurried hobbling into the study again. On the staircase was a\r\nhousemaid pulling up the blinds. She stared, I think, at the expression\r\nof my face. I shut the door of the study behind me, and, seizing a\r\npoker, began an attack upon the desk. That is how they found me. The\r\ncover of the desk was split, the lock smashed, the letters torn out of\r\nthe pigeon-holes and tossed about the room. In my senile rage I had\r\nflung about the pens and other such light stationery, and overturned the\r\nink. Moreover, a large vase upon the mantel had got broken—I do not know\r\nhow. I could find no cheque-book, no money, no indications of the\r\nslightest use for the recovery of my body. I was battering madly at the\r\ndrawers, when the butler, backed by two women-servants, intruded upon\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat simply is the story of my change. No one will believe my frantic\r\nassertions. I am treated as one demented, and even at this moment I am\r\nunder restraint. But I am sane, absolutely sane, and to prove it I have\r\nsat down to write this story minutely as the things happened to me. I\r\nappeal to the reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the\r\nstyle or method of the story he has been reading. I am a young man\r\nlocked away in an old man’s body. But the clear fact is incredible to\r\nevery one. Naturally I appear demented to those who will not believe\r\nthis, naturally I do not know the names of my secretaries, of the\r\ndoctors who come to see me, of my servants and neighbours, of this town\r\n(wherever it is) where I find myself. Naturally I lose myself in my own\r\nhouse, and suffer inconveniences of every sort. Naturally I ask the\r\noddest questions. Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms of\r\ndespair. I have no money and no cheque-book. The bank will not recognise\r\nmy signature, for I suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I now\r\nhave, my handwriting is still Eden’s. These people about me will not let\r\nme go to the bank personally. It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in\r\nthis town, and that I have an account in some part of London. It seems\r\nthat Elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his\r\nhousehold—I can ascertain nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound\r\nstudent of mental science, and all my declarations of the facts of the\r\ncase merely confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of\r\novermuch brooding upon psychology. Dreams of the personal identity\r\nindeed! Two days ago I was a healthy youngster, with all life before me;\r\nnow I am a furious old man, unkempt, and desperate, and miserable,\r\nprowling about a great luxurious strange house, watched, feared, and\r\navoided as a lunatic by every one about me. And in London is Elvesham\r\nbeginning life again in a vigorous body, and with all the accumulated\r\nknowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He has stolen my life.\r\n\r\nWhat has happened I do not clearly know. In the study are volumes of\r\nmanuscript notes referring chiefly to the psychology of memory, and\r\nparts of what may be either calculations or ciphers in symbols\r\nabsolutely strange to me. In some passages there are indications that he\r\nwas also occupied with the philosophy of mathematics. I take it he has\r\ntransferred the whole of his memories, the accumulation that makes up\r\nhis personality, from this old withered brain of his to mine, and,\r\nsimilarly, that he has transferred mine to his discarded tenement.\r\nPractically, that is, he has changed bodies. But how such a change may\r\nbe possible is without the range of my philosophy. I have been a\r\nmaterialist for all my thinking life, but here, suddenly, is a clear\r\ncase of man’s detachability from matter.\r\n\r\nOne desperate experiment I am about to try. I sit writing here before\r\nputting the matter to issue. This morning, with the help of a\r\ntable-knife that I had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking\r\nopen a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked writing-desk. I\r\ndiscovered nothing save a little green glass phial containing a white\r\npowder. Round the neck of the phial was a label, and thereon was written\r\nthis one word, “_Release_.” This may be—is most probably, poison. I can\r\nunderstand Elvesham placing poison in my way, and I should be sure that\r\nit was his intention so to get rid of the only living witness against\r\nhim, were it not for this careful concealment. The man has practically\r\nsolved the problem of immortality. Save for the spite of chance, he will\r\nlive in my body until it has aged, and then, again, throwing that aside,\r\nhe will assume some other victim’s youth and strength. When one\r\nremembers his heartlessness, it is terrible to think of the ever-growing\r\nexperience, that—How long has he been leaping from body to body? But I\r\ntire of writing. The powder appears to be soluble in water. The taste is\r\nnot unpleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere the narrative found upon Mr. Elvesham’s desk ends. His dead body\r\nlay between the desk and the chair. The latter had been pushed back,\r\nprobably by his last convulsions. The story was written in pencil, and\r\nin a crazy hand, quite unlike his usual minute characters. There remain\r\nonly two curious facts to record. Indisputably there was some connection\r\nbetween Eden and Elvesham, since the whole of Elvesham’s property was\r\nbequeathed to the young man. But he never inherited. When Elvesham\r\ncommitted suicide, Eden was, strangely enough, already dead. Twenty-four\r\nhours before, he had been knocked down by a cab and killed instantly, at\r\nthe crowded crossing at the intersection of Gower Street and Euston\r\nRoad. So that the only human being who could have thrown light upon this\r\nfantastic narrative is beyond the reach of questions. Without further\r\ncomment I leave this extraordinary matter to the reader’s individual\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE STOLEN BACILLUS\r\n\r\n\r\n“This again,” said the Bacteriologist, slipping a glass slide under the\r\nmicroscope, “is a preparation of the celebrated Bacillus of cholera—the\r\ncholera germ.”\r\n\r\nThe pale-faced man peered down the microscope. He was evidently not\r\naccustomed to that kind of thing, and held a limp white hand over his\r\ndisengaged eye. “I see very little,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Touch this screw,” said the Bacteriologist; “perhaps the microscope is\r\nout of focus for you. Eyes vary so much. Just the fraction of a turn\r\nthis way or that.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! now I see,” said the visitor. “Not so very much to see, after all.\r\nLittle streaks and shreds of pink. And yet those little particles, those\r\nmere atomies, might multiply and devastate a city! Wonderful!”\r\n\r\nHe stood up, and releasing the glass slip from the microscope, held it\r\nin his hand towards the window. “Scarcely visible,” he said,\r\nscrutinising the preparation. He hesitated. “Are these—alive? Are they\r\ndangerous now?”\r\n\r\n“Those have been stained and killed,” said the Bacteriologist. “I wish,\r\nfor my own part, we could kill and stain every one of them in the\r\nuniverse.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” the pale man said with a slight smile, “that you scarcely\r\ncare to have such things about you in the living—in the active state?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, we are obliged to,” said the Bacteriologist. “Here,\r\nfor instance—” He walked across the room and took up one of several\r\nsealed tubes. “Here is the living thing. This is a cultivation of the\r\nactual living disease bacteria.” He hesitated. “Bottled cholera, so to\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\nA slight gleam of satisfaction appeared momentarily in the face of the\r\npale man. “It’s a deadly thing to have in your possession,” he said,\r\ndevouring the little tube with his eyes. The Bacteriologist watched the\r\nmorbid pleasure in his visitor’s expression. This man, who had visited\r\nhim that afternoon with a note of introduction from an old friend,\r\ninterested him from the very contrast of their dispositions. The lank\r\nblack hair and deep grey eyes, the haggard expression and nervous\r\nmanner, the fitful yet keen interest of his visitor were a novel change\r\nfrom the phlegmatic deliberations of the ordinary scientific worker with\r\nwhom the Bacteriologist chiefly associated. It was perhaps natural, with\r\na hearer evidently so impressionable to the lethal nature of his topic,\r\nto take the most effective aspect of the matter.\r\n\r\nHe held the tube in his hand thoughtfully. “Yes, here is the pestilence\r\nimprisoned. Only break such a little tube as this into a supply of\r\ndrinking-water, say to these minute particles of life that one must\r\nneeds stain and examine with the highest powers of the microscope even\r\nto see, and that one can neither smell nor taste—say to them, ‘Go forth,\r\nincrease and multiply, and replenish the cisterns,’ and\r\nDeath—mysterious, untraceable Death, Death swift and terrible, Death\r\nfull of pain and indignity—would be released upon this city, and go\r\nhither and thither seeking his victims. Here he would take the husband\r\nfrom the wife, here the child from its mother, here the statesman from\r\nhis duty, and here the toiler from his trouble. He would follow the\r\nwater-mains, creeping along streets, picking out and punishing a house\r\nhere and a house there where they did not boil their drinking-water,\r\ncreeping into the wells of the mineral-water makers, getting washed into\r\nsalad, and lying dormant in ices. He would wait ready to be drunk in the\r\nhorse-troughs, and by unwary children in the public fountains. He would\r\nsoak into the soil, to reappear in springs and wells at a thousand\r\nunexpected places. Once start him at the water-supply, and before we\r\ncould ring him in and catch him again he would have decimated the\r\nmetropolis.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped abruptly. He had been told rhetoric was his weakness.\r\n\r\n“But he is quite safe here, you know—quite safe.”\r\n\r\nThe pale-faced man nodded. His eyes shone. He cleared his throat. “These\r\nAnarchist—rascals,” said he, “are fools, blind fools—to use bombs when\r\nthis kind of thing is attainable. I think—”\r\n\r\nA gentle rap, a mere light touch of the finger-nails was heard at the\r\ndoor. The Bacteriologist opened it. “Just a minute, dear,” whispered his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nWhen he re-entered the laboratory his visitor was looking at his watch.\r\n“I had no idea I had wasted an hour of your time,” he said. “Twelve\r\nminutes to four. I ought to have left here by half-past three. But your\r\nthings were really too interesting. No, positively, I cannot stop a\r\nmoment longer. I have an engagement at four.”\r\n\r\nHe passed out of the room reiterating his thanks, and the Bacteriologist\r\naccompanied him to the door, and then returned thoughtfully along the\r\npassage to his laboratory. He was musing on the ethnology of his\r\nvisitor. Certainly the man was not a Teutonic type nor a common Latin\r\none. “A morbid product, anyhow, I am afraid,” said the Bacteriologist to\r\nhimself. “How he gloated on those cultivations of disease-germs!” A\r\ndisturbing thought struck him. He turned to the bench by the\r\nvapour-bath, and then very quickly to his writing-table. Then he felt\r\nhastily in his pockets, and then rushed to the door. “I may have put it\r\ndown on the hall table,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Minnie!” he shouted hoarsely in the hall.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear,” came a remote voice.\r\n\r\n“Had I anything in my hand when I spoke to you, dear, just now?”\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, dear, because I remember—”\r\n\r\n“Blue ruin!” cried the Bacteriologist, and incontinently ran to the\r\nfront door and down the steps of his house to the street.\r\n\r\nMinnie, hearing the door slam violently, ran in alarm to the window.\r\nDown the street a slender man was getting into a cab. The\r\nBacteriologist, hatless, and in his carpet slippers, was running and\r\ngesticulating wildly towards this group. One slipper came off, but he\r\ndid not wait for it. “He has gone _mad_!” said Minnie; “it’s that horrid\r\nscience of his;” and, opening the window, would have called after him.\r\nThe slender man, suddenly glancing round, seemed struck with the same\r\nidea of mental disorder. He pointed hastily to the Bacteriologist, said\r\nsomething to the cabman, the apron of the cab slammed, the whip swished,\r\nthe horse’s feet clattered, and in a moment cab, and Bacteriologist\r\nhotly in pursuit, had receded up the vista of the roadway and\r\ndisappeared round the corner.\r\n\r\nMinnie remained straining out of the window for a minute. Then she drew\r\nher head back into the room again. She was dumbfounded. “Of course he is\r\neccentric,” she meditated. “But running about London—in the height of\r\nthe season, too—in his socks!” A happy thought struck her. She hastily\r\nput her bonnet on, seized his shoes, went into the hall, took down his\r\nhat and light overcoat from the pegs, emerged upon the doorstep, and\r\nhailed a cab that opportunely crawled by. “Drive me up the road and\r\nround Havelock Crescent, and see if we can find a gentleman running\r\nabout in a velveteen coat and no hat.”\r\n\r\n“Velveteen coat, ma’am, and no ’at. Very good, ma’am.” And the cabman\r\nwhipped up at once in the most matter-of-fact way, as if he drove to\r\nthis address every day in his life.\r\n\r\nSome few minutes later the little group of cabmen and loafers that\r\ncollects round the cabmen’s shelter at Haverstock Hill were startled by\r\nthe passing of a cab with a ginger-coloured screw of a horse, driven\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nThey were silent as it went by, and then as it receded—“That’s ’Arry\r\n’Icks. Wot’s _he_ got?” said the stout gentleman known as Old Tootles.\r\n\r\n“He’s a-using his whip, he is, _to_ rights,” said the ostler boy.\r\n\r\n“Hullo!” said poor old Tommy Byles; “here’s another bloomin’ loonattic.\r\nBlowed if there ain’t.”\r\n\r\n“It’s old George,” said Old Tootles, “and he’s drivin’ a loonattic, _as_\r\nyou say. Ain’t he a-clawin’ out of the keb? Wonder if he’s after ’Arry\r\n’Icks?”\r\n\r\nThe group round the cabmen’s shelter became animated. Chorus: “Go it,\r\nGeorge!” “It’s a race.” “You’ll ketch ’em!” “Whip up!”\r\n\r\n“She’s a goer, she is!” said the ostler boy.\r\n\r\n“Strike me giddy!” cried Old Tootles. “Here! _I’m_ a-goin’ to begin in a\r\nminute. Here’s another comin’. If all the kebs in Hampstead ain’t gone\r\nmad this morning!”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fieldmale this time,” said the ostler boy.\r\n\r\n“She’s a followin’ _him_,” said Old Tootles. “Usually the other way\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“What’s she got in her ’and?”\r\n\r\n“Looks like a ’igh ’at.”\r\n\r\n“What a bloomin’ lark it is! Three to one on old George,” said the\r\nostler boy. “Nexst!”\r\n\r\nMinnie went by in a perfect roar of applause. She did not like it, but\r\nshe felt that she was doing her duty, and whirled on down Haverstock\r\nHill and Camden Town High Street, with her eyes ever intent on the\r\nanimated back view of old George, who was driving her vagrant husband so\r\nincomprehensibly away from her.\r\n\r\nThe man in the foremost cab sat crouched in the corner, his arms tightly\r\nfolded, and the little tube that contained such vast possibilities of\r\ndestruction gripped in his hand. His mood was a singular mixture of fear\r\nand exultation. Chiefly he was afraid of being caught before he could\r\naccomplish his purpose, but behind this was a vaguer but larger fear of\r\nthe awfulness of his crime. But his exultation far exceeded his fear. No\r\nAnarchist before him had ever approached this conception of his.\r\nRavachol, Vaillant, all those distinguished persons whose fame he had\r\nenvied dwindled into insignificance beside him. He had only to make sure\r\nof the water-supply, and break the little tube into a reservoir. How\r\nbrilliantly he had planned it, forged the letter of introduction and got\r\ninto the laboratory, and how brilliantly he had seized his opportunity!\r\nThe world should hear of him at last. All those people who had sneered\r\nat him, neglected him, preferred other people to him, found his company\r\nundesirable, should consider him at last. Death, death, death! They had\r\nalways treated him as a man of no importance. All the world had been in\r\na conspiracy to keep him under. He would teach them yet what it is to\r\nisolate a man. What was this familiar street? Great Saint Andrew’s\r\nStreet, of course! How fared the chase? He craned out of the cab. The\r\nBacteriologist was scarcely fifty yards behind. That was bad. He would\r\nbe caught and stopped yet. He felt in his pocket for money, and found\r\nhalf-a-sovereign. This he thrust up through the trap in the top of the\r\ncab into the man’s face. “More,” he shouted, “if only we get away.”\r\n\r\nThe money was snatched out of his hand. “Right you are,” said the\r\ncabman, and the trap slammed, and the lash lay along the glistening side\r\nof the horse. The cab swayed, and the Anarchist, half-standing under the\r\ntrap, put the hand containing the little glass tube upon the apron to\r\npreserve his balance. He felt the brittle thing crack, and the broken\r\nhalf of it rang upon the floor of the cab. He fell back into the seat\r\nwith a curse, and stared dismally at the two or three drops of moisture\r\non the apron.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered.\r\n\r\n“Well! I suppose I shall be the first. _Phew!_ Anyhow, I shall be a\r\nMartyr. That’s something. But it is a filthy death, nevertheless. I\r\nwonder if it hurts as much as they say.”\r\n\r\nPresently a thought occurred to him—he groped between his feet. A little\r\ndrop was still in the broken end of the tube, and he drank that to make\r\nsure. It was better to make sure. At any rate, he would not fail.\r\n\r\nThen it dawned upon him that there was no further need to escape the\r\nBacteriologist. In Wellington Street he told the cabman to stop, and got\r\nout. He slipped on the step, and his head felt queer. It was rapid\r\nstuff, this cholera poison. He waved his cabman out of existence, so to\r\nspeak, and stood on the pavement with his arms folded upon his breast\r\nawaiting the arrival of the Bacteriologist. There was something tragic\r\nin his pose. The sense of imminent death gave him a certain dignity. He\r\ngreeted his pursuer with a defiant laugh.\r\n\r\n“Vive l’Anarchie! You are too late, my friend. I have drunk it. The\r\ncholera is abroad!”\r\n\r\nThe Bacteriologist from his cab beamed curiously at him through his\r\nspectacles. “You have drunk it! An Anarchist! I see now.” He was about\r\nto say something more, and then checked himself. A smile hung in the\r\ncorner of his mouth. He opened the apron of his cab as if to descend, at\r\nwhich the Anarchist waved him a dramatic farewell and strode off towards\r\nWaterloo Bridge, carefully jostling his infected body against as many\r\npeople as possible. The Bacteriologist was so preoccupied with the\r\nvision of him that he scarcely manifested the slightest surprise at the\r\nappearance of Minnie upon the pavement with his hat and shoes and\r\novercoat. “Very good of you to bring my things,” he said, and remained\r\nlost in contemplation of the receding figure of the Anarchist.\r\n\r\n“You had better get in,” he said, still staring. Minnie felt absolutely\r\nconvinced now that he was mad, and directed the cabman home on her own\r\nresponsibility. “Put on my shoes? Certainly, dear,” said he, as the cab\r\nbegan to turn, and hid the strutting black figure, now small in the\r\ndistance, from his eyes. Then suddenly something grotesque struck him,\r\nand he laughed. Then he remarked, “It is really very serious, though.\r\n\r\n“You see, that man came to my house to see me, and he is an Anarchist.\r\nNo—don’t faint, or I cannot possibly tell you the rest. And I wanted to\r\nastonish him, not knowing he was an Anarchist, and took up a cultivation\r\nof that new species of Bacterium I was telling you of, that infest, and\r\nI think cause, the blue patches upon various monkeys; and, like a fool,\r\nI said it was Asiatic cholera. And he ran away with it to poison the\r\nwater of London, and he certainly might have made things look blue for\r\nthis civilised city. And now he has swallowed it. Of course I cannot say\r\nwhat will happen, but you know it turned that kitten blue, and the three\r\npuppies—in patches, and the sparrow—bright blue. But the bother is I\r\nshall have all the trouble and expense of preparing some more.\r\n\r\n“Put on my coat on this hot day! Why? Because we might meet Mrs. Jabber.\r\nMy dear, Mrs. Jabber is not a draught. But why should I wear a coat on a\r\nhot day because of Mrs. ——. Oh! _very_ well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE RED ROOM\r\n\r\n\r\n“I can assure you,” said I, “that it will take a very tangible ghost to\r\nfrighten me.” And I stood up before the fire with my glass in my hand.\r\n\r\n“It is your own choosing,” said the man with the withered arm, and\r\nglanced at me askance.\r\n\r\n“Eight-and-twenty years,” said I, “I have lived, and never a ghost have\r\nI seen as yet.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman sat staring hard into the fire, her pale eyes wide open.\r\n“Ay,” she broke in; “and eight-and-twenty years you have lived and never\r\nseen the likes of this house, I reckon. There’s a many things to see,\r\nwhen one’s still but eight-and-twenty.” She swayed her head slowly from\r\nside to side. “A many things to see and sorrow for.”\r\n\r\nI half-suspected the old people were trying to enhance the spiritual\r\nterrors of their house by their droning insistence. I put down my empty\r\nglass on the table and looked about the room, and caught a glimpse of\r\nmyself, abbreviated and broadened to an impossible sturdiness, in the\r\nqueer old mirror at the end of the room. “Well,” I said, “if I see\r\nanything to-night, I shall be so much the wiser. For I come to the\r\nbusiness with an open mind.”\r\n\r\n“It’s your own choosing,” said the man with the withered arm once more.\r\n\r\nI heard the sound of a stick and a shambling step on the flags in the\r\npassage outside, and the door creaked on its hinges as a second old man\r\nentered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He\r\nsupported himself by a single crutch, his eyes were covered by a shade,\r\nand his lower lip, half-averted, hung pale and pink from his decaying\r\nyellow teeth. He made straight for an arm-chair on the opposite side of\r\nthe table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with the\r\nwithered arm gave this new-comer a short glance of positive dislike; the\r\nold woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes\r\nfixed steadily on the fire.\r\n\r\n“I said—it’s your own choosing,” said the man with the withered arm,\r\nwhen the coughing had ceased for awhile.\r\n\r\n“It’s my own choosing,” I answered.\r\n\r\nThe man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time,\r\nand threw his head back for a moment and sideways, to see me. I caught a\r\nmomentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he\r\nbegan to cough and splutter again.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you drink?” said the man with the withered arm, pushing the\r\nbeer towards him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful with a\r\nshaky arm that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A\r\nmonstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall and mocked his action as\r\nhe poured and drank. I must confess I had scarce expected these\r\ngrotesque custodians. There is to my mind something inhuman in senility,\r\nsomething crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem to drop from\r\nold people insensibly day by day. The three of them made me feel\r\nuncomfortable, with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage, their\r\nevident unfriendliness to me and to one another.\r\n\r\n“If,” said I, “you will show me to this haunted room of yours, I will\r\nmake myself comfortable there.”\r\n\r\nThe old man with the cough jerked his head back so suddenly that it\r\nstartled me, and shot another glance of his red eyes at me from under\r\nthe shade; but no one answered me. I waited a minute, glancing from one\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\n“If,” I said a little louder, “if you will show me to this haunted room\r\nof yours, I will relieve you from the task of entertaining me.”\r\n\r\n“There’s a candle on the slab outside the door,” said the man with the\r\nwithered arm, looking at my feet as he addressed me. “But if you go to\r\nthe red room to-night—”\r\n\r\n(“This night of all nights!” said the old woman.)\r\n\r\n“You go alone.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I answered. “And which way do I go?”\r\n\r\n“You go along the passage for a bit,” said he, “until you come to a\r\ndoor, and through that is a spiral staircase, and half-way up that is a\r\nlanding and another door covered with baize. Go through that and down\r\nthe long corridor to the end, and the red room is on your left up the\r\nsteps.”\r\n\r\n“Have I got that right?” I said, and repeated his directions. He\r\ncorrected me in one particular.\r\n\r\n“And are you really going?” said the man with the shade, looking at me\r\nagain for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n(“This night of all nights!” said the old woman.)\r\n\r\n“It is what I came for,” I said, and moved towards the door. As I did\r\nso, the old man with the shade rose and staggered round the table, so as\r\nto be closer to the others and to the fire. At the door I turned and\r\nlooked at them, and saw they were all close together, dark against the\r\nfirelight, staring at me over their shoulders, with an intent expression\r\non their ancient faces.\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” I said, setting the door open.\r\n\r\n“It’s your own choosing,” said the man with the withered arm.\r\n\r\nI left the door wide open until the candle was well alight, and then I\r\nshut them in and walked down the chilly, echoing passage.\r\n\r\nI must confess that the oddness of these three old pensioners in whose\r\ncharge her ladyship had left the castle, and the deep-toned,\r\nold-fashioned furniture of the housekeeper’s room in which they\r\nforegathered, affected me in spite of my efforts to keep myself at a\r\nmatter-of-fact phase. They seemed to belong to another age, an older\r\nage, an age when things spiritual were different from this of ours, less\r\ncertain; an age when omens and witches were credible, and ghosts beyond\r\ndenying. Their very existence was spectral; the cut of their clothing,\r\nfashions born in dead brains. The ornaments and conveniences of the room\r\nabout them were ghostly—the thoughts of vanished men, which still\r\nhaunted rather than participated in the world of to-day. But with an\r\neffort I sent such thoughts to the right-about. The long, draughty\r\nsubterranean passage was chilly and dusty, and my candle flared and made\r\nthe shadows cower and quiver. The echoes rang up and down the spiral\r\nstaircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after me, and one fled before\r\nme into the darkness overhead. I came to the landing and stopped there\r\nfor a moment, listening to a rustling that I fancied I heard; then,\r\nsatisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door\r\nand stood in the corridor.\r\n\r\nThe effect was scarcely what I expected, for the moonlight, coming in by\r\nthe great window on the grand staircase, picked out everything in vivid\r\nblack shadow or silvery illumination. Everything was in its place: the\r\nhouse might have been deserted on the yesterday instead of eighteen\r\nmonths ago. There were candles in the sockets of the sconces, and\r\nwhatever dust had gathered on the carpets or upon the polished flooring\r\nwas distributed so evenly as to be invisible in the moonlight. I was\r\nabout to advance, and stopped abruptly. A bronze group stood upon the\r\nlanding, hidden from me by the corner of the wall, but its shadow fell\r\nwith marvellous distinctness upon the white panelling, and gave me the\r\nimpression of some one crouching to waylay me. I stood rigid for half a\r\nminute perhaps. Then, with my hand in the pocket that held my revolver,\r\nI advanced, only to discover a Ganymede and Eagle glistening in the\r\nmoonlight. That incident for a time restored my nerve, and a porcelain\r\nChinaman on a buhl table, whose head rocked silently as I passed him,\r\nscarcely startled me.\r\n\r\nThe door to the red room and the steps up to it were in a shadowy\r\ncorner. I moved my candle from side to side, in order to see clearly the\r\nnature of the recess in which I stood before opening the door. Here it\r\nwas, thought I, that my predecessor was found, and the memory of that\r\nstory gave me a sudden twinge of apprehension. I glanced over my\r\nshoulder at the Ganymede in the moonlight, and opened the door of the\r\nred room rather hastily, with my face half turned to the pallid silence\r\nof the landing.\r\n\r\nI entered, closed the door behind me at once, turned the key I found in\r\nthe lock within, and stood with the candle held aloft, surveying the\r\nscene of my vigil, the great red room of Lorraine Castle, in which the\r\nyoung duke had died. Or, rather, in which he had begun his dying, for he\r\nhad opened the door and fallen headlong down the steps I had just\r\nascended. That had been the end of his vigil, of his gallant attempt to\r\nconquer the ghostly tradition of the place, and never, I thought, had\r\napoplexy better served the ends of superstition. And there were other\r\nand older stories that clung to the room, back to the half-credible\r\nbeginning of it all, the tale of a timid wife and the tragic end that\r\ncame to her husband’s jest of frightening her. And looking around that\r\nlarge shadowy room, with its shadowy window bays, its recesses and\r\nalcoves, one could well understand the legends that had sprouted in its\r\nblack corners, its germinating darkness. My candle was a little tongue\r\nof light in its vastness, that failed to pierce the opposite end of the\r\nroom, and left an ocean of mystery and suggestion beyond its island of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nI resolved to make a systematic examination of the place at once, and\r\ndispel the fanciful suggestions of its obscurity before they obtained a\r\nhold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I\r\nbegan to walk about the room, peering round each article of furniture,\r\ntucking up the valances of the bed, and opening its curtains wide. I\r\npulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows\r\nbefore closing the shutters, leant forward and looked up the blackness\r\nof the wide chimney, and tapped the dark oak panelling for any secret\r\nopening. There were two big mirrors in the room, each with a pair of\r\nsconces bearing candles, and on the mantel-shelf, too, were more candles\r\nin china candlesticks. All these I lit one after the other. The fire was\r\nlaid,—an unexpected consideration from the old housekeeper,—and I lit\r\nit, to keep down any disposition to shiver, and when it was burning\r\nwell, I stood round with my back to it and regarded the room again. I\r\nhad pulled up a chintz-covered armchair and a table, to form a kind of\r\nbarricade before me, and on this lay my revolver ready to hand. My\r\nprecise examination had done me good, but I still found the remoter\r\ndarkness of the place, and its perfect stillness, too stimulating for\r\nthe imagination. The echoing of the stir and crackling of the fire was\r\nno sort of comfort to me. The shadow in the alcove, at the end in\r\nparticular, had that undefinable quality of a presence, that odd\r\nsuggestion of a lurking living thing, that comes so easily in silence\r\nand solitude. At last, to reassure myself, I walked with a candle into\r\nit, and satisfied myself that there was nothing tangible there. I stood\r\nthat candle upon the floor of the alcove, and left it in that position.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was in a state of considerable nervous tension, although\r\nto my reason there was no adequate cause for the condition. My mind,\r\nhowever, was perfectly clear. I postulated quite unreservedly that\r\nnothing supernatural could happen, and to pass the time I began to\r\nstring some rhymes together, Ingoldsby fashion, of the original legend\r\nof the place. A few I spoke aloud, but the echoes were not pleasant. For\r\nthe same reason I also abandoned, after a time, a conversation with\r\nmyself upon the impossibility of ghosts and haunting. My mind reverted\r\nto the three old and distorted people downstairs, and I tried to keep it\r\nupon that topic. The sombre reds and blacks of the room troubled me;\r\neven with seven candles the place was merely dim. The one in the alcove\r\nflared in a draught, and the fire-flickering kept the shadows and\r\npenumbra perpetually shifting and stirring. Casting about for a remedy,\r\nI recalled the candles I had seen in the passage, and, with a slight\r\neffort, walked out into the moonlight, carrying a candle and leaving the\r\ndoor open, and presently returned with as many as ten. These I put in\r\nvarious knick-knacks of china with which the room was sparsely adorned,\r\nlit and placed where the shadows had lain deepest, some on the floor,\r\nsome in the window recesses, until at last my seventeen candles were so\r\narranged that not an inch of the room but had the direct light of at\r\nleast one of them. It occurred to me that when the ghost came, I could\r\nwarn him not to trip over them. The room was now quite brightly\r\nilluminated. There was something very cheery and reassuring in these\r\nlittle streaming flames, and snuffing them gave me an occupation, and\r\nafforded a reassuring sense of the passage of time.\r\n\r\nEven with that, however, the brooding expectation of the vigil weighed\r\nheavily upon me. It was after midnight that the candle in the alcove\r\nsuddenly went out, and the black shadow sprang back to its place there.\r\nI did not see the candle go out; I simply turned and saw that the\r\ndarkness was there, as one might start and see the unexpected presence\r\nof a stranger. “By Jove!” said I aloud; “that draught’s a strong one!”\r\nand, taking the matches from the table, I walked across the room in a\r\nleisurely manner to relight the corner again. My first match would not\r\nstrike, and as I succeeded with the second, something seemed to blink on\r\nthe wall before me. I turned my head involuntarily, and saw that the two\r\ncandles on the little table by the fireplace were extinguished. I rose\r\nat once to my feet.\r\n\r\n“Odd!” I said. “Did I do that myself in a flash of absent-mindedness?”\r\n\r\nI walked back, relit one, and as I did so, I saw the candle in the right\r\nsconce of one of the mirrors wink and go right out, and almost\r\nimmediately its companion followed it. There was no mistake about it.\r\nThe flame vanished, as if the wicks had been suddenly nipped between a\r\nfinger and a thumb, leaving the wick neither glowing nor smoking, but\r\nblack. While I stood gaping, the candle at the foot of the bed went out,\r\nand the shadows seemed to take another step towards me.\r\n\r\n“This won’t do!” said I, and first one and then another candle on the\r\nmantel-shelf followed.\r\n\r\n“What’s up?” I cried, with a queer high note getting into my voice\r\nsomehow. At that the candle on the wardrobe went out, and the one I had\r\nrelit in the alcove followed.\r\n\r\n“Steady on!” I said. “These candles are wanted,” speaking with a\r\nhalf-hysterical facetiousness, and scratching away at a match the while\r\nfor the mantel candlesticks. My hands trembled so much that twice I\r\nmissed the rough paper of the matchbox. As the mantel emerged from\r\ndarkness again, two candles in the remoter end of the window were\r\neclipsed. But with the same match I also relit the larger mirror\r\ncandles, and those on the floor near the doorway, so that for the moment\r\nI seemed to gain on the extinctions. But then in a volley there vanished\r\nfour lights at once in different corners of the room, and I struck\r\nanother match in quivering haste, and stood hesitating whither to take\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs I stood undecided, an invisible hand seemed to sweep out the two\r\ncandles on the table. With a cry of terror, I dashed at the alcove, then\r\ninto the corner, and then into the window, relighting three, as two more\r\nvanished by the fireplace; then, perceiving a better way, I dropped the\r\nmatches on the iron-bound deed-box in the corner, and caught up the\r\nbedroom candlestick. With this I avoided the delay of striking matches;\r\nbut for all that the steady process of extinction went on, and the\r\nshadows I feared and fought against returned, and crept in upon me,\r\nfirst a step gained on this side of me and then on that. It was like a\r\nragged stormcloud sweeping out the stars. Now and then one returned for\r\na minute, and was lost again. I was now almost frantic with the horror\r\nof the coming darkness, and my self-possession deserted me. I leaped,\r\npanting and dishevelled, from candle to candle, in a vain struggle\r\nagainst that remorseless advance.\r\n\r\nI bruised myself on the thigh against the table, I sent a chair\r\nheadlong, I stumbled and fell and whisked the cloth from the table in my\r\nfall. My candle rolled away from me, and I snatched another as I rose.\r\nAbruptly this was blown out, as I swung it off the table, by the wind of\r\nmy sudden movement, and immediately the two remaining candles followed.\r\nBut there was light still in the room, a red light that staved off the\r\nshadows from me. The fire! Of course, I could still thrust my candle\r\nbetween the bars and relight it!\r\n\r\nI turned to where the flames were still dancing between the glowing\r\ncoals, and splashing red reflections upon the furniture, made two steps\r\ntowards the grate, and incontinently the flames dwindled and vanished,\r\nthe glow vanished, the reflections rushed together and vanished, and as\r\nI thrust the candle between the bars, darkness closed upon me like the\r\nshutting of an eye, wrapped about me in a stifling embrace, sealed my\r\nvision, and crushed the last vestiges of reason from my brain. The\r\ncandle fell from my hand. I flung out my arms in a vain effort to thrust\r\nthat ponderous blackness away from me, and, lifting up my voice,\r\nscreamed with all my might—once, twice, thrice. Then I think I must have\r\nstaggered to my feet. I know I thought suddenly of the moonlit corridor,\r\nand, with my head bowed and my arms over my face, made a run for the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBut I had forgotten the exact position of the door, and struck myself\r\nheavily against the corner of the bed. I staggered back, turned, and was\r\neither struck or struck myself against some other bulky furniture. I\r\nhave a vague memory of battering myself thus, to and fro in the\r\ndarkness, of a cramped struggle, and of my own wild crying as I darted\r\nto and fro, of a heavy blow at last upon my forehead, a horrible\r\nsensation of falling that lasted an age, of my last frantic effort to\r\nkeep my footing, and then I remember no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and the man\r\nwith the withered arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to\r\nremember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. I\r\nrolled my eyes into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer\r\nabstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial\r\ninto a glass. “Where am I?” I asked. “I seem to remember you, and yet I\r\ncannot remember who you are.”\r\n\r\nThey told me then, and I heard of the haunted red room as one who hears\r\na tale. “We found you at dawn,” said he, “and there was blood on your\r\nforehead and lips.”\r\n\r\nIt was very slowly I recovered my memory of my experience. “You believe\r\nnow,” said the old man, “that the room is haunted?” He spoke no longer\r\nas one who greets an intruder, but as one who grieves for a broken\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I; “the room is haunted.”\r\n\r\n“And you have seen it. And we, who have lived here all our lives, have\r\nnever set eyes upon it. Because we have never dared.—Tell us, is it\r\ntruly the old earl who—”\r\n\r\n“No,” said I; “it is not.”\r\n\r\n“I told you so,” said the old lady, with the glass in her hand. “It is\r\nhis poor young countess who was frightened—”\r\n\r\n“It is not,” I said. “There is neither ghost of earl nor ghost of\r\ncountess in that room, there is no ghost there at all; but worse, far\r\nworse—”\r\n\r\n“Well?” they said.\r\n\r\n“The worst of all the things that haunt poor mortal man,” said I; “and\r\nthat is, in all its nakedness—_Fear!_ Fear that will not have light nor\r\nsound, that will not bear with reason, that deafens and darkens and\r\noverwhelms. It followed me through the corridor, it fought against me in\r\nthe room—”\r\n\r\nI stopped abruptly. There was an interval of silence. My hand went up to\r\nmy bandages.\r\n\r\nThen the man with the shade sighed and spoke. “That is it,” said he. “I\r\nknew that was it. A Power of Darkness. To put such a curse upon a woman!\r\nIt lurks there always. You can feel it even in the daytime, even of a\r\nbright summer’s day, in the hangings, in the curtains, keeping behind\r\nyou however you face about. In the dusk it creeps along the corridor and\r\nfollows you, so that you dare not turn. There is Fear in that room of\r\nhers—black Fear, and there will be—so long as this house of sin\r\nendures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 A MOTH\r\n                            (GENUS UNKNOWN)\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably you have heard of Hapley—not W. T. Hapley, the son, but the\r\ncelebrated Hapley, the Hapley of _Periplaneta Hapliia_, Hapley the\r\nentomologist. If so, you know at least of the great feud between Hapley\r\nand Professor Pawkins, though certain of its consequences may be new to\r\nyou. For those who have not, a word or two of explanation is necessary,\r\nwhich the idle reader may go over with a glancing eye, if his indolence\r\nso incline him.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing how very widely diffused is the ignorance of such really\r\nimportant matters as this Hapley-Pawkins feud. Those epoch-making\r\ncontroversies, again, that have convulsed the Geological Society, are, I\r\nverily believe, almost entirely unknown outside the fellowship of that\r\nbody. I have heard men of fair general education even refer to the great\r\nscenes at these meetings as vestry-meeting squabbles. Yet the great Hate\r\nof the English and Scotch geologists has lasted now half a century, and\r\nhas “left deep and abundant marks upon the body of the science.” And\r\nthis Hapley-Pawkins business, though perhaps a more personal affair,\r\nstirred passions as profound, if not profounder. Your common man has no\r\nconception of the zeal that animates a scientific investigator, the fury\r\nof contradiction you can arouse in him. It is the _odium theologicum_ in\r\na new form. There are men, for instance, who would gladly burn Professor\r\nRay Lankester at Smithfield for his treatment of the Mollusca in the\r\nEncyclopædia. That fantastic extension of the Cephalopods to cover the\r\nPterpodos—But I wander from Hapley and Pawkins.\r\n\r\nIt began years and years ago, with a revision of the Microlepidoptera\r\n(whatever these may be) by Pawkins, in which he extinguished a new\r\nspecies created by Hapley. Hapley, who was always quarrelsome, replied\r\nby a stinging impeachment of the entire classification of Pawkins.[2]\r\nPawkins, in his “Rejoinder,”[3] suggested that Hapley’s microscope was\r\nas defective as his powers of observation, and called him an\r\n“irresponsible meddler”—Hapley was not a professor at that time. Hapley,\r\nin his retort,[4] spoke of “blundering collectors,” and described, as if\r\ninadvertently, Pawkins’s revision as a “miracle of ineptitude.” It was\r\nwar to the knife. However, it would scarcely interest the reader to\r\ndetail how these two great men quarrelled, and how the split between\r\nthem widened until from the Microlepidoptera, they were at war upon\r\nevery open question in entomology. There were memorable occasions. At\r\ntimes the Royal Entomological Society meetings resembled nothing so much\r\nas the Chamber of Deputies. On the whole, I fancy Pawkins was nearer the\r\ntruth than Hapley. But Hapley was skilful with his rhetoric, had a turn\r\nfor ridicule rare in a scientific man, was endowed with vast energy, and\r\nhad a fine sense of injury in the matter of the extinguished species;\r\nwhile Pawkins was a man of dull presence, prosy of speech, in shape not\r\nunlike a water-barrel, overconscientious with testimonials, and\r\nsuspected of jobbing museum appointments. So the young men gathered\r\nround Hapley and applauded him. It was a long struggle, vicious from the\r\nbeginning, and growing at last to pitiless antagonism. The successive\r\nturns of fortune, now an advantage to one side and now to another—now\r\nHapley tormented by some success of Pawkins, and now Pawkins outshone by\r\nHapley—belong rather to the history of entomology than to this story.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  “Remarks on a Recent Revision of Microlepidoptera.” _Quart. Journ.\r\n  Entomological Soc._ 1863.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  “Rejoinder to certain Remarks,” &c. _Ibid._ 1864.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  “Further Remarks,” &c. _Ibid._\r\n\r\nBut in 1891 Pawkins, whose health had been bad for some time, published\r\nsome work upon the “mesoblast” of the Death’s Head Moth. What the\r\nmesoblast of the Death’s Head Moth may be, does not matter a rap in this\r\nstory. But the work was far below his usual standard, and gave Hapley an\r\nopening he had coveted for years. He must have worked night and day to\r\nmake the most of his advantage.\r\n\r\nIn an elaborate critique he rent Pawkins to tatters,—one can fancy the\r\nman’s disordered black hair, and his queer dark eyes flashing as he went\r\nfor his antagonist,—and Pawkins made a reply, halting, ineffectual, with\r\npainful gaps of silence, and yet malignant. There was no mistaking his\r\nwill to wound Hapley, nor his incapacity to do it. But few of those who\r\nheard him—I was absent from that meeting—realised how ill the man was.\r\n\r\nHapley had got his opponent down, and meant to finish him. He followed\r\nwith a simply brutal attack upon Pawkins, in the form of a paper upon\r\nthe development of moths in general, a paper showing evidence of a most\r\nextraordinary amount of mental labour, and yet couched in a violently\r\ncontroversial tone. Violent as it was, an editorial note witnesses that\r\nit was modified. It must have covered Pawkins with shame and confusion\r\nof face. It left no loophole; it was murderous in argument, and utterly\r\ncontemptuous in tone; an awful thing for the declining years of a man’s\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe world of entomologists waited breathlessly for the rejoinder from\r\nPawkins. He would try one, for Pawkins had always been game. But when it\r\ncame it surprised them. For the rejoinder of Pawkins was to catch the\r\ninfluenza, to proceed to pneumonia, and to die.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps as effectual a reply as he could make under the\r\ncircumstances, and largely turned the current of feeling against Hapley.\r\nThe very people who had most gleefully cheered on those gladiators\r\nbecame serious at the consequence. There could be no reasonable doubt\r\nthe fret of the defeat had contributed to the death of Pawkins. There\r\nwas a limit even to scientific controversy, said serious people. Another\r\ncrushing attack was already in the press and appeared on the day before\r\nthe funeral. I don’t think Hapley exerted himself to stop it. People\r\nremembered how Hapley had hounded down his rival, and forgot that\r\nrival’s defects. Scathing satire reads ill over fresh mould. The thing\r\nprovoked comment in the daily papers. This it was that made me think\r\nthat you had probably heard of Hapley and this controversy. But, as I\r\nhave already remarked, scientific workers live very much in a world of\r\ntheir own; half the people, I dare say, who go along Piccadilly to the\r\nAcademy every year, could not tell you where the learned societies\r\nabide. Many even think that Research is a kind of happy-family cage in\r\nwhich all kinds of men lie down together in peace.\r\n\r\nIn his private thoughts Hapley could not forgive Pawkins for dying. In\r\nthe first place, it was a mean dodge to escape the absolute\r\npulverisation Hapley had in hand for him, and in the second, it left\r\nHapley’s mind with a queer gap in it. For twenty years he had worked\r\nhard, sometimes far into the night, and seven days a week, with\r\nmicroscope, scalpel, collecting-net, and pen, and almost entirely with\r\nreference to Pawkins. The European reputation he had won had come as an\r\nincident in that great antipathy. He had gradually worked up to a climax\r\nin this last controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had also thrown\r\nHapley out of gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised him to give up\r\nwork for a time, and rest. So Hapley went down into a quiet village in\r\nKent, and thought day and night of Pawkins, and good things it was now\r\nimpossible to say about him.\r\n\r\nAt last Hapley began to realise in what direction the preoccupation\r\ntended. He determined to make a fight for it, and started by trying to\r\nread novels. But he could not get his mind off Pawkins, white in the\r\nface, and making his last speech—every sentence a beautiful opening for\r\nHapley. He turned to fiction—and found it had no grip on him. He read\r\nthe “Island Nights’ Entertainments” until his “sense of causation” was\r\nshocked beyond endurance by the Bottle Imp. Then he went to Kipling, and\r\nfound he “proved nothing,” besides being irreverent and vulgar. These\r\nscientific people have their limitations. Then, unhappily, he tried\r\nBesant’s “Inner House,” and the opening chapter set his mind upon\r\nlearned societies and Pawkins at once.\r\n\r\nSo Hapley turned to chess, and found it a little more soothing. He soon\r\nmastered the moves and the chief gambits and commoner closing positions,\r\nand began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the\r\nopposite king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping\r\nineffectually against checkmate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the study of some new branch of science would after all be\r\nbetter diversion. The best rest is change of occupation. Hapley\r\ndetermined to plunge at diatoms, and had one of his smaller microscopes\r\nand Halibut’s monograph sent down from London. He thought that perhaps\r\nif he could get up a vigorous quarrel with Halibut, he might be able to\r\nbegin life afresh and forget Pawkins. And very soon he was hard at work,\r\nin his habitual strenuous fashion, at these microscopic denizens of the\r\nwayside pool.\r\n\r\nIt was on the third day of the diatoms that Hapley became aware of a\r\nnovel addition to the local fauna. He was working late at the\r\nmicroscope, and the only light in the room was the brilliant little lamp\r\nwith the special form of green shade. Like all experienced\r\nmicroscopists, he kept both eyes open. It is the only way to avoid\r\nexcessive fatigue. One eye was over the instrument, and bright and\r\ndistinct before that was the circular field of the microscope, across\r\nwhich a brown diatom was slowly moving. With the other eye Hapley saw,\r\nas it were, without seeing.[5] He was only dimly conscious of the brass\r\nside of the instrument, the illuminated part of the table-cloth, a sheet\r\nof notepaper, the foot of the lamp, and the darkened room beyond.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The reader unaccustomed to microscopes may easily understand this by\r\n  rolling a newspaper in the form of a tube and looking through it at a\r\n  book, keeping the other eye open.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his attention drifted from one eye to the other. The\r\ntable-cloth was of the material called tapestry by shopmen, and rather\r\nbrightly coloured. The pattern was in gold, with a small amount of\r\ncrimson and pale-blue upon a greyish ground. At one point the pattern\r\nseemed displaced, and there was a vibrating movement of the colours at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\nHapley suddenly moved his head back and looked with both eyes. His mouth\r\nfell open with astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt was a large moth or butterfly; its wings spread in butterfly fashion!\r\n\r\nIt was strange it should be in the room at all, for the windows were\r\nclosed. Strange that it should not have attracted his attention when\r\nfluttering to its present position. Strange that it should match the\r\ntable-cloth. Stranger far to him, Hapley, the great entomologist, it was\r\naltogether unknown. There was no delusion. It was crawling slowly\r\ntowards the foot of the lamp.\r\n\r\n“_Genus unknown_, by heavens! And in England!” said Hapley, staring.\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly thought of Pawkins. Nothing would have maddened Pawkins\r\nmore—And Pawkins was dead!\r\n\r\nSomething about the head and body of the insect became singularly\r\nsuggestive of Pawkins, just as the chess king had been.\r\n\r\n“Confound Pawkins!” said Hapley. “But I must catch this.” And, looking\r\nround him for some means of capturing the moth, he rose slowly out of\r\nhis chair. Suddenly the insect rose, struck the edge of the\r\nlamp-shade—Hapley heard the “ping”—and vanished into the shadow.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Hapley had whipped off the shade, so that the whole room was\r\nilluminated. The thing had disappeared, but soon his practised eye\r\ndetected it upon the wall-paper near the door. He went towards it,\r\npoising the lamp-shade for capture. Before he was within striking\r\ndistance, however, it had risen and was fluttering round the room. After\r\nthe fashion of its kind, it flew with sudden starts and turns, seeming\r\nto vanish here and reappear there. Once Hapley struck, and missed; then\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe third time he hit his microscope. The instrument swayed, struck and\r\noverturned the lamp, and fell noisily upon the floor. The lamp turned\r\nover on the table and, very luckily, went out. Hapley was left in the\r\ndark. With a start he felt the strange moth blunder into his face.\r\n\r\nIt was maddening. He had no lights. If he opened the door of the room\r\nthe thing would get away. In the darkness he saw Pawkins quite\r\ndistinctly laughing at him. Pawkins had ever an oily laugh. He swore\r\nfuriously and stamped his foot on the floor.\r\n\r\nThere was a timid rapping at the door.\r\n\r\nThen it opened, perhaps a foot, and very slowly. The alarmed face of the\r\nlandlady appeared behind a pink candle flame; she wore a night-cap over\r\nher grey hair and had some purple garment over her shoulders. “What\r\n_was_ that fearful smash?” she said. “Has anything—” The strange moth\r\nappeared fluttering about the chink of the door. “Shut that door!” said\r\nHapley, and suddenly rushed at her.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed hastily. Hapley was left alone in the dark. Then in the\r\npause he heard his landlady scuttle upstairs, lock her door and drag\r\nsomething heavy across the room and put against it.\r\n\r\nIt became evident to Hapley that his conduct and appearance had been\r\nstrange and alarming. Confound the moth! and Pawkins! However, it was a\r\npity to lose the moth now. He felt his way into the hall and found the\r\nmatches, after sending his hat down upon the floor with a noise like a\r\ndrum. With the lighted candle he returned to the sitting-room. No moth\r\nwas to be seen. Yet once for a moment it seemed that the thing was\r\nfluttering round his head. Hapley very suddenly decided to give up the\r\nmoth and go to bed. But he was excited. All night long his sleep was\r\nbroken by dreams of the moth, Pawkins, and his landlady. Twice in the\r\nnight he turned out and soused his head in cold water.\r\n\r\nOne thing was very clear to him. His landlady could not possibly\r\nunderstand about the strange moth, especially as he had failed to catch\r\nit. No one but an entomologist would understand quite how he felt. She\r\nwas probably frightened at his behaviour, and yet he failed to see how\r\nhe could explain it. He decided to say nothing further about the events\r\nof last night. After breakfast he saw her in her garden, and decided to\r\ngo out to talk to her to reassure her. He talked to her about beans and\r\npotatoes, bees, caterpillars, and the price of fruit. She replied in her\r\nusual manner, but she looked at him a little suspiciously, and kept\r\nwalking as he walked, so that there was always a bed of flowers, or a\r\nrow of beans, or something of the sort, between them. After a while he\r\nbegan to feel singularly irritated at this, and to conceal his vexation\r\nwent indoors and presently went out for a walk.\r\n\r\nThe moth—or butterfly, trailing an odd flavour of Pawkins with it, kept\r\ncoming into that walk, though he did his best to keep his mind off it.\r\nOnce he saw it quite distinctly, with its wings flattened out, upon the\r\nold stone wall that runs along the west edge of the park, but going up\r\nto it he found it was only two lumps of grey and yellow lichen. “This,”\r\nsaid Hapley, “is the reverse of mimicry. Instead of a butterfly looking\r\nlike a stone, here is a stone looking like a butterfly!” Once something\r\nhovered and fluttered round his head, but by an effort of will he drove\r\nthat impression out of his mind again.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon\r\ntheological questions. They sat in the little arbour covered with briar,\r\nand smoked as they wrangled. “Look at that moth!” said Hapley, suddenly,\r\npointing to the edge of the wooden table.\r\n\r\n“Where?” said the Vicar.\r\n\r\n“You don’t see a moth on the edge of the table there?” said Hapley.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not,” said the Vicar.\r\n\r\nHapley was thunderstruck. He gasped. The Vicar was staring at him.\r\nClearly the man saw nothing. “The eye of faith is no better than the eye\r\nof science,” said Hapley, awkwardly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see your point,” said the Vicar, thinking it was part of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nThat night Hapley found the moth crawling over his counterpane. He sat\r\non the edge of the bed in his shirt-sleeves and reasoned with himself.\r\nWas it pure hallucination? He knew he was slipping, and he battled for\r\nhis sanity with the same silent energy he had formerly displayed against\r\nPawkins. So persistent is mental habit, that he felt as if it were still\r\na struggle with Pawkins. He was well versed in psychology. He knew that\r\nsuch visual illusions do come as a result of mental strain. But the\r\npoint was, he did not only _see_ the moth, he had heard it when it\r\ntouched the edge of the lamp-shade, and afterwards when it hit against\r\nthe wall, and he had felt it strike his face in the dark.\r\n\r\nHe looked at it. It was not at all dreamlike, but perfectly clear and\r\nsolid-looking in the candlelight. He saw the hairy body, and the short,\r\nfeathery antennæ, the jointed legs, even a place where the down was\r\nrubbed from the wing. He suddenly felt angry with himself for being\r\nafraid of a little insect.\r\n\r\nHis landlady had got the servant to sleep with her that night, because\r\nshe was afraid to be alone. In addition she had locked the door, and put\r\nthe chest of drawers against it. They listened and talked in whispers\r\nafter they had gone to bed, but nothing occurred to alarm them. About\r\neleven they had ventured to put the candle out, and had both dozed off\r\nto sleep. They woke up with a start, and sat up in bed, listening in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThen they heard slippered feet going to and fro in Hapley’s room. A\r\nchair was overturned, and there was a violent dab at the wall. Then a\r\nchina mantel ornament smashed upon the fender. Suddenly the door of the\r\nroom opened, and they heard him upon the landing. They clung to one\r\nanother, listening. He seemed to be dancing upon the staircase. Now he\r\nwould go down three or four steps quickly, then up again, then hurry\r\ndown into the hall. They heard the umbrella-stand go over, and the\r\nfanlight break. Then the bolt shot and the chain rattled. He was opening\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the window. It was a dim grey night; an almost unbroken\r\nsheet of watery cloud was sweeping across the moon, and the hedge and\r\ntrees in front of the house were black against the pale roadway. They\r\nsaw Hapley, looking like a ghost in his shirt and white trousers,\r\nrunning to and fro in the road, and beating the air. Now he would stop,\r\nnow he would dart very rapidly at something invisible, now he would move\r\nupon it with stealthy strides. At last he went out of sight up the road\r\ntowards the down. Then, while they argued who should go down and lock\r\nthe door, he returned. He was walking very fast, and he came straight\r\ninto the house, closed the door carefully, and went quietly up to his\r\nbedroom. Then everything was silent.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Colville,” said Hapley, calling down the staircase next morning.\r\n“I hope I did not alarm you last night.”\r\n\r\n“You may well ask that!” said Mrs. Colville.\r\n\r\n“The fact is, I am a sleep-walker, and the last two nights I have been\r\nwithout my sleeping mixture. There is nothing to be alarmed about,\r\nreally. I am sorry I made such an ass of myself. I will go over the down\r\nto Shoreham, and get some stuff to make me sleep soundly. I ought to\r\nhave done that yesterday.”\r\n\r\nBut half-way over the down, by the chalk-pits, the moth came upon Hapley\r\nagain. He went on, trying to keep his mind upon chess problems, but it\r\nwas no good. The thing fluttered into his face, and he struck at it with\r\nhis hat in self-defence. Then rage, the old rage—the rage he had so\r\noften felt against Pawkins—returned once more. He went on, leaping and\r\nstriking at the eddying insect. Suddenly he trod on nothing, and fell\r\nheadlong.\r\n\r\nThere was a gap in his sensations, and Hapley found himself sitting on\r\nthe heap of flints in front of the opening of the chalk-pits, with a leg\r\ntwisted back under him. The strange moth was still fluttering round his\r\nhead. He struck at it with his hand, and turning his head saw two men\r\napproaching him. One was the village doctor. It occurred to Hapley that\r\nthis was lucky. Then it came into his mind, with extraordinary\r\nvividness, that no one would ever be able to see the strange moth except\r\nhimself, and that it behoved him to keep silent about it.\r\n\r\nLate that night, however, after his broken leg was set, he was feverish\r\nand forgot his self-restraint. He was lying flat on his bed, and he\r\nbegan to run his eyes round the room to see if the moth was still about.\r\nHe tried not to do this, but it was no good. He soon caught sight of the\r\nthing resting close to his hand, by the night-light, on the green\r\ntable-cloth. The wings quivered. With a sudden wave of anger he smote at\r\nit with his fist, and the nurse woke up with a shriek. He had missed it.\r\n\r\n“That moth!” he said; and then, “It was fancy. Nothing!”\r\n\r\nAll the time he could see quite clearly the insect going round the\r\ncornice and darting across the room, and he could also see that the\r\nnurse saw nothing of it and looked at him strangely. He must keep\r\nhimself in hand. He knew he was a lost man if he did not keep himself in\r\nhand. But as the night waned the fever grew upon him, and the very dread\r\nhe had of seeing the moth made him see it. About five, just as the dawn\r\nwas grey, he tried to get out of bed and catch it, though his leg was\r\nafire with pain. The nurse had to struggle with him.\r\n\r\nOn account of this, they tied him down to the bed. At this the moth grew\r\nbolder, and once he felt it settle in his hair. Then, because he struck\r\nout violently with his arms, they tied these also. At this the moth came\r\nand crawled over his face, and Hapley wept, swore, screamed, prayed for\r\nthem to take it off him, unavailingly.\r\n\r\nThe doctor was a blockhead, a half-qualified general practitioner, and\r\nquite ignorant of mental science. He simply said there was no moth. Had\r\nhe possessed the wit, he might still, perhaps, have saved Hapley from\r\nhis fate by entering into his delusion and covering his face with gauze,\r\nas he prayed might be done. But, as I say, the doctor was a blockhead,\r\nand until the leg was healed Hapley was kept tied to his bed, and with\r\nthe imaginary moth crawling over him. It never left him while he was\r\nawake and it grew to a monster in his dreams. While he was awake he\r\nlonged for sleep, and from sleep he awoke screaming.\r\n\r\nSo now Hapley is spending the remainder of his days in a padded room,\r\nworried by a moth that no one else can see. The asylum doctor calls it\r\nhallucination; but Hapley, when he is in his easier mood, and can talk,\r\nsays it is the ghost of Pawkins, and consequently a unique specimen and\r\nwell worth the trouble of catching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IN THE ABYSS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant stood in front of the steel sphere and gnawed a piece of\r\npine splinter. “What do you think of it, Steevens?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It’s an idea,” said Steevens, in the tone of one who keeps an open\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“I believe it will smash—flat,” said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“He seems to have calculated it all out pretty well,” said Steevens,\r\nstill impartial.\r\n\r\n“But think of the pressure,” said the lieutenant. “At the surface of the\r\nwater it’s fourteen pounds to the inch, thirty feet down it’s double\r\nthat; sixty, treble; ninety, four times; nine hundred, forty times; five\r\nthousand three hundred—that’s a mile—it’s two hundred and forty times\r\nfourteen pounds; that’s—let’s see—thirty hundredweight—a ton and a half,\r\nSteevens; _a ton and a half_ to the square inch. And the ocean where\r\nhe’s going is five miles deep. That’s seven and a half—”\r\n\r\n“Sounds a lot,” said Steevens, “but it’s jolly thick steel.”\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant made no answer, but resumed his pine splinter. The object\r\nof their conversation was a huge globe of steel, having an exterior\r\ndiameter of perhaps eight feet. It looked like the shot for some Titanic\r\npiece of artillery. It was elaborately nested in a monstrous scaffolding\r\nbuilt into the framework of the vessel, and the gigantic spars that were\r\npresently to sling it overboard gave the stern of the ship an appearance\r\nthat had raised the curiosity of every decent sailor who had sighted it,\r\nfrom the pool of London to the Tropic of Capricorn. In two places, one\r\nabove the other, the steel gave place to a couple of circular windows of\r\nenormously thick glass, and one of these, set in a steel frame of great\r\nsolidity, was now partially unscrewed. Both the men had seen the\r\ninterior of this globe for the first time that morning. It was\r\nelaborately padded with air cushions, with little studs sunk between\r\nbulging pillows to work the simple mechanism of the affair. Everything\r\nwas elaborately padded, even the Myer’s apparatus which was to absorb\r\ncarbonic acid and replace the oxygen inspired by its tenant, when he had\r\ncrept in by the glass manhole, and had been screwed in. It was so\r\nelaborately padded that a man might have been fired from a gun in it\r\nwith perfect safety. And it had need to be, for presently a man was to\r\ncrawl in through that glass manhole, to be screwed up tightly, and to be\r\nflung overboard, and to sink down—down—down, for five miles, even as the\r\nlieutenant said. It had taken the strongest hold of his imagination; it\r\nmade him a bore at mess; and he found Steevens, the new arrival aboard,\r\na godsend to talk to about it, over and over again.\r\n\r\n“It’s my opinion,” said the lieutenant, “that that glass will simply\r\nbend in and bulge and smash, under a pressure of that sort. Daubrée has\r\nmade rocks run like water under big pressures—and, you mark my words—”\r\n\r\n“If the glass did break in,” said Steevens, “what then?”\r\n\r\n“The water would shoot in like a jet of iron. Have you ever felt a\r\nstraight jet of high pressure water? It would hit as hard as a bullet.\r\nIt would simply smash him and flatten him. It would tear down his\r\nthroat, and into his lungs; it would blow in his ears—”\r\n\r\n“What a detailed imagination you have,” protested Steevens, who saw\r\nthings vividly.\r\n\r\n“It’s a simple statement of the inevitable,” said the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“And the globe?”\r\n\r\n“Would just give out a few little bubbles, and it would settle down,\r\ncomfortably against the day of judgment, among the oozes and the bottom\r\nclay—with poor Elstead spread over his own smashed cushions like butter\r\nover bread.”\r\n\r\nHe repeated this sentence as though he liked it very much. “Like butter\r\nover bread,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Having a look at the jigger?” said a voice behind them, and Elstead\r\nstood behind them, spick and span in white, with a cigarette between his\r\nteeth, and his eyes smiling out of the shadow of his ample hat-brim.\r\n“What’s that about bread and butter, Weybridge? Grumbling as usual about\r\nthe insufficient pay of naval officers? It won’t be more than a day now\r\nbefore I start. We are to get the slings ready to-day. This clean sky\r\nand gentle swell is just the kind of thing for swinging off twenty tons\r\nof lead and iron; isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“It won’t affect you much,” said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n“No. Seventy or eighty feet down, and I shall be there in a dozen\r\nseconds, there’s not a particle moving, though the wind shriek itself\r\nhoarse up above, and the water lifts halfway to the clouds. No. Down\r\nthere—.” He moved to the side of the ship and the other two followed\r\nhim. All three leant forward on their elbows and stared down into the\r\nyellow-green water.\r\n\r\n“_Peace_,” said Elstead, finishing his thought aloud.\r\n\r\n“Are you dead certain that clockwork will act?” asked Weybridge,\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n“It has worked thirty-five times,” said Elstead. “It’s bound to work.”\r\n\r\n“But if it doesn’t?”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t go down in that confounded thing,” said Weybridge, “for\r\ntwenty thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\n“Cheerful chap you are,” said Elstead, and spat sociably at a bubble\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand yet how you mean to work the thing,” said Steevens.\r\n\r\n“In the first place I’m screwed into the sphere,” said Elstead, “and\r\nwhen I’ve turned the electric light off and on three times to show I’m\r\ncheerful, I’m swung out over the stern by that crane, with all those big\r\nlead sinkers slung below me. The top lead weight has a roller carrying a\r\nhundred fathoms of strong cord rolled up, and that’s all that joins the\r\nsinkers to the sphere, except the slings that will be cut when the\r\naffair is dropped. We use cord rather than wire rope because it’s easier\r\nto cut and more buoyant—necessary points as you will see.\r\n\r\n“Through each of these lead weights you notice there is a hole, and an\r\niron rod will be run through that and will project six feet on the lower\r\nside. If that rod is rammed up from below it knocks up a lever and sets\r\nthe clockwork in motion at the side of the cylinder on which the cord\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n“Very well. The whole affair is lowered gently into the water, and the\r\nslings are cut. The sphere floats—with the air in it, it’s lighter than\r\nwater; but the lead weights go down straight and the cord runs out. When\r\nthe cord is all paid out, the sphere will go down too, pulled down by\r\nthe cord.”\r\n\r\n“But why the cord?” asked Steevens. “Why not fasten the weights directly\r\nto the sphere?”\r\n\r\n“Because of the smash down below. The whole affair will go rushing down,\r\nmile after mile, at a headlong pace at last. It would be knocked to\r\npieces on the bottom if it wasn’t for that cord. But the weights will\r\nhit the bottom, and directly they do the buoyancy of the sphere will\r\ncome into play. It will go on sinking slower and slower; come to a stop\r\nat last and then begin to float upward again.\r\n\r\n“That’s where the clockwork comes in. Directly the weights smash against\r\nthe sea bottom, the rod will be knocked through and will kick up the\r\nclockwork, and the cord will be rewound on the reel. I shall be lugged\r\ndown to the sea bottom. There I shall stay for half an hour, with the\r\nelectric light on, looking about me. Then the clockwork will release a\r\nspring knife, the cord will be cut, and up I shall rush again, like a\r\nsoda-water bubble. The cord itself will help the flotation.”\r\n\r\n“And if you should chance to hit a ship?” said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n“I should come up at such a pace, I should go clean through it,” said\r\nElstead, “like a cannon ball. You needn’t worry about that.”\r\n\r\n“And suppose some nimble crustacean should wriggle into your clockwork—”\r\n\r\n“It would be a pressing sort of invitation for me to stop,” said\r\nElstead, turning his back on the water and staring at the sphere.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had swung Elstead overboard by eleven o’clock. The day was serenely\r\nbright and calm, with the horizon lost in haze. The electric glare in\r\nthe little upper compartment beamed cheerfully three times. Then they\r\nlet him down slowly to the surface of the water, and a sailor in the\r\nstern chains hung ready to cut the tackle that held the lead weights and\r\nthe sphere together. The globe, which had looked so large on deck,\r\nlooked the smallest thing conceivable under the stern of the ship. It\r\nrolled a little, and its two dark windows, which floated uppermost,\r\nseemed like eyes turned up in round wonderment at the people who crowded\r\nthe rail. A voice wondered how Elstead liked the rolling. “Are you\r\nready?” sang out the Commander. “Aye, aye, sir!” “Then let her go!”\r\n\r\nThe rope of the tackle tightened against the blade and was cut, and an\r\neddy rolled over the globe in a grotesquely helpless fashion. Some one\r\nwaved a handkerchief, some one else tried an ineffectual cheer, a middy\r\nwas counting slowly: “Eight, nine, ten!” Another roll, then with a jerk\r\nand a splash the thing righted itself.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be stationary for a moment, to grow rapidly smaller, and\r\nthen the water closed over it, and it became visible, enlarged by\r\nrefraction and dimmer, below the surface. Before one could count three\r\nit had disappeared. There was a flicker of white light far down in the\r\nwater, that diminished to a speck and vanished. Then there was nothing\r\nbut a depth of water going down into blackness, through which a shark\r\nwas swimming.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the screw of the cruiser began to rotate, the water was\r\ncrickled, the shark disappeared in a wrinkled confusion, and a torrent\r\nof foam rushed across the crystalline clearness that had swallowed up\r\nElstead. “What’s the idee?” said one A. B. to another.\r\n\r\n“We’re going to lay off about a couple of miles, ’fear he should hit us\r\nwhen he comes up,” said his mate.\r\n\r\nThe ship steamed slowly to her new position. Aboard her almost every one\r\nwho was unoccupied remained watching the breathing swell into which the\r\nsphere had sunk. For the next half hour it is doubtful if a word was\r\nspoken that did not bear directly or indirectly on Elstead. The December\r\nsun was now high in the sky, and the heat very considerable.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be cold enough down there,” said Weybridge. “They say that below\r\na certain depth sea-water’s always just about freezing.”\r\n\r\n“Where’ll he come up?” asked Steevens. “I’ve lost my bearings.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the spot,” said the Commander, who prided himself on his\r\nomniscience. He extended a precise finger south-eastward. “And this, I\r\nreckon, is pretty nearly the moment,” he said. “He’s been thirty-five\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\n“How long does it take to reach the bottom of the ocean?” asked\r\nSteevens.\r\n\r\n“For a depth of five miles, and reckoning—as we did—an acceleration to\r\ntwo foot per second, both ways, is just about three-quarters of a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\n“Then he’s overdue,” said Weybridge.\r\n\r\n“Pretty nearly,” said the Commander. “I suppose it takes a few minutes\r\nfor that cord of his to wind in.”\r\n\r\n“I forgot that,” said Weybridge, evidently relieved.\r\n\r\nAnd then began the suspense. A minute slowly dragged itself out, and no\r\nsphere shot out of the water. Another followed, and nothing broke the\r\nlow oily swell. The sailors explained to one another that little point\r\nabout the winding-in of the cord. The rigging was dotted with expectant\r\nfaces. “Come up, Elstead!” called one hairy-chested salt, impatiently,\r\nand the others caught it up, and shouted as though they were waiting for\r\nthe curtain of a theatre to rise.\r\n\r\nThe Commander glanced irritably at them.\r\n\r\n“Of course, if the acceleration’s less than two,” he said, “he’ll be all\r\nthe longer. We aren’t absolutely certain that was the proper figure. I’m\r\nno slavish believer in calculations.”\r\n\r\nSteevens agreed concisely. No one on the quarter-deck spoke for a couple\r\nof minutes. Then Steevens’s watch-case clicked.\r\n\r\nWhen, twenty-one minutes after, the sun reached the zenith, they were\r\nstill waiting for the globe to reappear, and not a man aboard had dared\r\nto whisper that hope was dead. It was Weybridge who first gave\r\nexpression to that realisation. He spoke while the sound of eight bells\r\nstill hung in the air. “I always distrusted that window,” he said quite\r\nsuddenly to Steevens.\r\n\r\n“Good God!” said Steevens, “you don’t think—”\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Weybridge, and left the rest to his imagination.\r\n\r\n“I’m no great believer in calculations myself,” said the Commander,\r\ndubiously, “so that I’m not altogether hopeless yet.” And at midnight\r\nthe gunboat was steaming slowly in a spiral round the spot where the\r\nglobe had sunk, and the white beam of the electric light fled and halted\r\nand swept discontentedly onward again over the waste of phosphorescent\r\nwaters under the little stars.\r\n\r\n“If his window hasn’t burst and smashed him,” said Weybridge, “then it’s\r\na cursed sight worse, for his clockwork has gone wrong and he’s alive\r\nnow, five miles under our feet, down there in the cold and dark,\r\nanchored in that little bubble of his, where never a ray of light has\r\nshone or a human being lived, since the waters were gathered together.\r\nHe’s there without food, feeling hungry and thirsty and scared,\r\nwondering whether he’ll starve or stifle. Which will it be? The Myer’s\r\napparatus is running out, I suppose. How long do they last?\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” he exclaimed, “what little things we are! What daring\r\nlittle devils! Down there, miles and miles of water—all water, and all\r\nthis empty water about us and this sky. Gulfs!” He threw his hands out,\r\nand as he did so a little white streak swept noiselessly up the sky,\r\ntravelling more slowly, stopped, became a motionless dot as though a new\r\nstar had fallen up into the sky. Then it went sliding back again and\r\nlost itself amidst the reflections of the stars, and the white haze of\r\nthe sea’s phosphorescence.\r\n\r\nAt the sight he stopped, arm extended and mouth open. He shut his mouth,\r\nopened it again and waved his arms with an impatient gesture. Then he\r\nturned, shouted, “Elstead ahoy,” to the first watch, and went at a run\r\nto Lindley and the search light. “I saw him,” he said. “Starboard there!\r\nHis light’s on and he’s just shot out of the water. Bring the light\r\nround. We ought to see him drifting, when he lifts on the swell.”\r\n\r\nBut they never picked up the explorer until dawn. Then they almost ran\r\nhim down. The crane was swung out and a boat’s crew hooked the chain to\r\nthe sphere. When they had shipped the sphere they unscrewed the manhole\r\nand peered into the darkness of the interior (for the electric light\r\nchamber was intended to illuminate the water about the sphere, and was\r\nshut off entirely from its general cavity).\r\n\r\nThe air was very hot within the cavity, and the india-rubber at the lip\r\nof the manhole was soft. There was no answer to their eager questions\r\nand no sound of movement within. Elstead seemed to be lying motionless,\r\ncrumpled up in the bottom of the globe. The ship’s doctor crawled in and\r\nlifted him out to the men outside. For a moment or so they did not know\r\nwhether Elstead was alive or dead. His face, in the yellow glow of the\r\nship’s lamps, glistened with perspiration. They carried him down to his\r\nown cabin.\r\n\r\nHe was not dead they found, but in a state of absolute nervous collapse,\r\nand besides cruelly bruised. For some days he had to lie perfectly\r\nstill. It was a week before he could tell his experiences.\r\n\r\nAlmost his first words were that he was going down again. The sphere\r\nwould have to be altered, he said, in order to allow him to throw off\r\nthe cord if need be, and that was all. He had had the most marvellous\r\nexperience. “You thought I should find nothing but ooze,” he said. “You\r\nlaughed at my explorations, and I’ve discovered a new world!” He told\r\nhis story in disconnected fragments, and chiefly from the wrong end, so\r\nthat it is impossible to re-tell it in his words. But what follows is\r\nthe narrative of his experience.\r\n\r\nIt began atrociously, he said. Before the cord ran out the thing kept\r\nrolling over. He felt like a frog in a football. He could see nothing\r\nbut the crane and the sky overhead, with an occasional glimpse of the\r\npeople on the ship’s rail. He couldn’t tell a bit which way the thing\r\nwould roll next. Suddenly he would find his feet going up and try to\r\nstep, and over he went rolling, head over heels and just anyhow on the\r\npadding. Any other shape would have been more comfortable, but no other\r\nshape was to be relied upon under the huge pressure of the nethermost\r\nabyss.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the swaying ceased; the globe righted, and when he had picked\r\nhimself up, he saw the water all about him greeny-blue with an\r\nattenuated light filtering down from above, and a shoal of little\r\nfloating things went rushing up past him, as it seemed to him, towards\r\nthe light. And even as he looked it grew darker and darker, until the\r\nwater above was as dark as the midnight sky, albeit of a greener shade,\r\nand the water below black. And little transparent things in the water\r\ndeveloped a faint glint of luminosity, and shot past him in faint\r\ngreenish streaks.\r\n\r\nAnd the feeling of falling! It was just like the start of a lift, he\r\nsaid, only it kept on. One has to imagine what that means, that keeping\r\non. It was then of all times that Elstead repented of his adventure. He\r\nsaw the chances against him in an altogether new light. He thought of\r\nthe big cuttle-fish people knew to exist in the middle waters, the kind\r\nof things they find half-digested in whales at times, or floating dead\r\nand rotten and half eaten by fish. Suppose one caught hold and wouldn’t\r\nleave go. And had the clockwork really been sufficiently tested? But\r\nwhether he wanted to go on or go back mattered not the slightest now.\r\n\r\nIn fifty seconds everything was as black as night outside, except where\r\nthe beam from his light struck through the waters, and picked out every\r\nnow and then some fish or scrap of sinking matter. They flashed by too\r\nfast for him to see what they were. Once he thought he passed a shark.\r\nAnd then the sphere began to get hot by friction against the water. They\r\nhad underestimated this, it seems.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he noticed was that he was perspiring, and then he heard\r\na hissing, growing louder, under his feet, and saw a lot of little\r\nbubbles—very little bubbles they were—rushing upward like a fan through\r\nthe water outside. Steam! He felt the window and it was hot. He turned\r\non the minute glow lamp that lit his own cavity, looked at the padded\r\nwatch by the studs, and saw he had been travelling now for two minutes.\r\nIt came into his head that the window would crack through the conflict\r\nof temperatures, for he knew the bottom water was very near freezing.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the floor of the sphere seemed to press against his feet,\r\nthe rush of bubbles outside grew slower and slower and the hissing\r\ndiminished. The sphere rolled a little. The window had not cracked,\r\nnothing had given, and he knew that the dangers of sinking, at any rate,\r\nwere over.\r\n\r\nIn another minute or so, he would be on the floor of the abyss. He\r\nthought, he said, of Steevens and Weybridge and the rest of them five\r\nmiles overhead, higher to him than the very highest clouds that ever\r\nfloated over land are to us, steaming slowly and staring down and\r\nwondering what had happened to him.\r\n\r\nHe peered out of the window. There were no more bubbles now, and the\r\nhissing had stopped. Outside there was a heavy blackness—as black as\r\nblack velvet—except where the electric light pierced the empty water and\r\nshowed the colour of it—a yellow-green. Then three things like shapes of\r\nfire swam into sight, following each other through the water. Whether\r\nthey were little and near, or big and far off, he could not tell.\r\n\r\nEach was outlined in a bluish light almost as bright as the lights of a\r\nfishing-smack, a light which seemed to be smoking greatly, and all along\r\nthe sides of them were specks of this, like the lighted portholes of a\r\nship. Their phosphorescence seemed to go out as they came into the\r\nradiance of his lamp, and he saw then that they were indeed fish of some\r\nstrange sort, with huge heads, vast eyes, and dwindling bodies and\r\ntails. Their eyes were turned towards him, and he judged they were\r\nfollowing him down. He supposed they were attracted by his glare.\r\n\r\nPresently others of the same sort joined them. As he went on down he\r\nnoticed that the water became of a pallid colour, and that little specks\r\ntwinkled in his ray like motes in sunbeam. This was probably due to the\r\nclouds of ooze and mud that the impact of his leaden sinkers had\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was drawn down to the lead weights he was in a dense fog\r\nof white that his electric light failed altogether to pierce for more\r\nthan a few yards, and many minutes elapsed before the hanging sheets of\r\nsediment subsided to any extent. Then, lit by his light and by the\r\ntransient phosphorescence of a distant shoal of fishes, he was able to\r\nsee under the huge blackness of the super-incumbent water an undulating\r\nexpanse of greyish-white ooze, broken here and there by tangled thickets\r\nof a growth of sea lilies, waving hungry tentacles in the air.\r\n\r\nFarther away were the graceful translucent outlines of a group of\r\ngigantic sponges. About this floor there were scattered a number of\r\nbristling flattish tufts of rich purple and black, which he decided must\r\nbe some sort of sea-urchin, and small, large-eyed or blind things,\r\nhaving a curious resemblance, some to woodlice, and others to lobsters,\r\ncrawled sluggishly across the track of the light and vanished into the\r\nobscurity again, leaving furrowed trails behind them.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the hovering swarm of little fishes veered about and came\r\ntowards him as a flight of starlings might do. They passed over him like\r\na phosphorescent snow, and then he saw behind them some larger creature\r\nadvancing towards the sphere.\r\n\r\nAt first he could see it only dimly, a faintly moving figure remotely\r\nsuggestive of a walking man, and then it came into the spray of light\r\nthat the lamp shot out. As the glare struck it, it shut its eyes,\r\ndazzled. He stared in rigid astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, vertebrated animal. Its dark purple head was dimly\r\nsuggestive of a chameleon, but it had such a high forehead and such a\r\nbrain-case as no reptile ever displayed before; the vertical pitch of\r\nits face gave it a most extraordinary resemblance to a human being.\r\n\r\nTwo large and protruding eyes projected from sockets in chameleon\r\nfashion, and it had a broad reptilian mouth with horny lips beneath its\r\nlittle nostrils. In the position of the ears were two huge gill covers,\r\nand out of these floated a branching tree of coralline filaments, almost\r\nlike the tree-like gills that very young rays and sharks possess.\r\n\r\nBut the humanity of the face was not the most extraordinary thing about\r\nthe creature. It was a biped, its almost globular body was poised on a\r\ntripod of two frog-like legs and a long thick tail, and its fore limbs,\r\nwhich grotesquely caricatured the human hand much as a frog’s do,\r\ncarried a long shaft of bone, tipped with copper. The colour of the\r\ncreature was variegated: its head, hands, and legs were purple; but its\r\nskin, which hung loosely upon it, even as clothes might do, was a\r\nphosphorescent grey. And it stood there, blinded by the light.\r\n\r\nAt last this unknown creature of the abyss blinked its eyes open, and,\r\nshading them with its disengaged hand, opened its mouth and gave vent to\r\na shouting noise, articulate almost as speech might be, that penetrated\r\neven the steel case and padded jacket of the sphere. How a shouting may\r\nbe accomplished without lungs Elstead does not profess to explain. It\r\nthen moved sideways out of the glare into the mystery of shadow that\r\nbordered it on either side, and Elstead felt rather than saw that it was\r\ncoming towards him. Fancying the light had attracted it, he turned the\r\nswitch that cut off the current. In another moment something soft dabbed\r\nupon the steel, and the globe swayed.\r\n\r\nThen the shouting was repeated, and it seemed to him that a distant echo\r\nanswered it. The dabbing recurred, and the globe swayed and ground\r\nagainst the spindle over which the wire was rolled. He stood in the\r\nblackness, and peered out into the everlasting night of the abyss. And\r\npresently he saw, very faint and remote, other phosphorescent\r\nquasi-human forms hurrying towards him.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what he did, he felt about in his swaying prison for the\r\nstud of the exterior electric light, and came by accident against his\r\nown small glow lamp in its padded recess. The sphere twisted, and then\r\nthrew him down; he heard shouts like shouts of surprise, and when he\r\nrose to his feet he saw two pairs of stalked eyes peering into the lower\r\nwindow and reflecting his light.\r\n\r\nIn another moment hands were dabbing vigorously at his steel casing, and\r\nthere was a sound, horrible enough in his position, of the metal\r\nprotection of the clockwork being vigorously hammered. That, indeed,\r\nsent his heart into his mouth, for if these strange creatures succeeded\r\nin stopping that his release would never occur. Scarcely had he thought\r\nas much when he felt the sphere sway violently, and the floor of it\r\npress hard against his feet. He turned off the small glow lamp that lit\r\nthe interior, and sent the ray of the large light in the separate\r\ncompartment out into the water. The sea floor and the manlike creatures\r\nhad disappeared, and a couple of fish chasing each other dropped\r\nsuddenly by the window.\r\n\r\nHe thought at once that these strange denizens of the deep sea had\r\nbroken the wire rope, and that he had escaped. He drove up faster and\r\nfaster, and then stopped with a jerk that sent him flying against the\r\npadded roof of his prison. For half a minute perhaps he was too\r\nastonished to think.\r\n\r\nThen he felt that the sphere was spinning slowly, and rocking, and it\r\nseemed to him that it was also being drawn through the water. By\r\ncrouching close to the window he managed to make his weight effective\r\nand roll that part of the sphere downward, but he could see nothing save\r\nthe pale ray of his light striking down ineffectively into the darkness.\r\nIt occurred to him that he would see more if he turned the lamp off and\r\nallowed his eyes to grow accustomed to the profound obscurity.\r\n\r\nIn this he was wise. After some minutes the velvety blackness became a\r\ntranslucent blackness, and then far away, and as faint as the zodiacal\r\nlight of an English summer evening, he saw shapes moving below. He\r\njudged these creatures had detached his cable and were towing him along\r\nthe sea bottom.\r\n\r\nAnd then he saw something faint and remote across the undulations of the\r\nsubmarine plain, a broad horizon of pale luminosity that extended this\r\nway and that way as far as the range of his little window permitted him\r\nto see. To this he was being towed, as a balloon might be towed by men\r\nout of the open country into a town. He approached it very slowly, and\r\nvery slowly the dim irradiation was gathered together into more definite\r\nshapes.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly five o’clock before he came over this luminous area, and\r\nby that time he could make out an arrangement suggestive of streets and\r\nhouses grouped about a vast roofless erection that was grotesquely\r\nsuggestive of a ruined abbey. It was spread out like a map below him.\r\nThe houses were all roofless inclosures of walls, and their substance\r\nbeing, as he afterwards saw, of phosphorescent bones, gave the place an\r\nappearance as if it were built of drowned moonshine.\r\n\r\nAmong the inner caves of the place waving trees of crinoid stretched\r\ntheir tentacles, and tall, slender, glassy sponges shot like shining\r\nminarets and lilies of filmy light out of the general glow of the city.\r\nIn the open spaces of the place he could see a stirring movement as of\r\ncrowds of people, but he was too many fathoms above them to distinguish\r\nthe individuals in those crowds.\r\n\r\nThen slowly they pulled him down, and as they did so the details of the\r\nplace crept slowly upon his apprehension. He saw that the courses of the\r\ncloudy buildings were marked out with beaded lines of round objects, and\r\nthen he perceived that at several points below him in broad open spaces\r\nwere forms like the encrusted shapes of ships.\r\n\r\nSlowly and surely he was drawn down, and the forms below him became\r\nbrighter, clearer, were more distinct. He was being pulled down, he\r\nperceived, towards the large building in the centre of the town, and he\r\ncould catch a glimpse ever and again of the multitudinous forms that\r\nwere lugging at his cord. He was astonished to see that the rigging of\r\none of the ships, which formed such a prominent feature of the place,\r\nwas crowded with a host of gesticulating figures regarding him, and then\r\nthe walls of the great building rose about him silently, and hid the\r\ncity from his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd such walls they were, of water-logged wood, and twisted wire rope\r\nand iron spars, and copper, and the bones and skulls of dead men.\r\n\r\nThe skulls ran in curious zigzag lines and spirals and fantastic curves\r\nover the building; and in and out of their eye-sockets, and over the\r\nwhole surface of the place, lurked and played a multitude of silvery\r\nlittle fishes.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was at such a level that he could see these strange people of\r\nthe abyss plainly once more. To his astonishment, he perceived that they\r\nwere prostrating themselves before him, all save one, dressed as it\r\nseemed in a robe of placoid scales, and crowned with a luminous diadem,\r\nwho stood with his reptilian mouth opening and shutting as though he led\r\nthe chanting of the worshippers.\r\n\r\nThey continued worshipping him, without rest or intermission, for the\r\nspace of three hours.\r\n\r\nMost circumstantial was Elstead’s account of this astounding city and\r\nits people, these people of perpetual night, who have never seen sun or\r\nmoon or stars, green vegetation, nor any living air-breathing creatures,\r\nwho know nothing of fire, nor any light but the phosphorescent light of\r\nliving things.\r\n\r\nStartling as is his story, it is yet more startling to find that\r\nscientific men, of such eminence as Adams and Jenkins, find nothing\r\nincredible in it. They tell me they see no reason why intelligent,\r\nwater-breathing, vertebrated creatures inured to a low temperature and\r\nenormous pressure, and of such a heavy structure, that neither alive nor\r\ndead would they float, might not live upon the bottom of the deep sea,\r\nand quite unsuspected by us, descendants like ourselves of the great\r\nTheriomorpha of the New Red Sandstone age.\r\n\r\nWe should be known to them, however, as strange meteoric creatures wont\r\nto fall catastrophically dead out of the mysterious blackness of their\r\nwatery sky. And not only we ourselves, but our ships, our metals, our\r\nappliances, would come raining down out of the night. Sometimes sinking\r\nthings would smite down and crush them, as if it were the judgment of\r\nsome unseen power above, and sometimes would come things of the utmost\r\nrarity or utility or shapes of inspiring suggestion. One can understand,\r\nperhaps, something of their behaviour at the descent of a living man, if\r\none thinks what a barbaric people might do, to whom an enhaloed shining\r\ncreature came suddenly out of the sky.\r\n\r\nAt one time or another Elstead probably told the officers of the\r\n_Ptarmigan_ every detail of his strange twelve hours in the abyss. That\r\nhe also intended to write them down is certain, but he never did, and so\r\nunhappily we have to piece together the discrepant fragments of his\r\nstory from the reminiscences of Commander Simmons, Weybridge, Steevens,\r\nLindley, and the others.\r\n\r\nWe see the thing darkly in fragmentary glimpses—the huge ghostly\r\nbuilding, the bowing, chanting people, with their dark, chameleon-like\r\nheads and faintly luminous forms, and Elstead, with his light turned on\r\nagain, vainly trying to convey to their minds that the cord by which the\r\nsphere was held was to be severed. Minute after minute slipped away, and\r\nElstead, looking at his watch, was horrified to find that he had oxygen\r\nonly for four hours more. But the chant in his honour kept on as\r\nremorselessly as if it was the marching song of his approaching death.\r\n\r\nThe manner of his release he does not understand, but to judge by the\r\nend of cord that hung from the sphere, it had been cut through by\r\nrubbing against the edge of the altar. Abruptly the sphere rolled over,\r\nand he swept up, out of their world, as an ethereal creature clothed in\r\na vacuum would sweep through our own atmosphere back to its native ether\r\nagain. He must have torn out of their sight as a hydrogen bubble hastens\r\nupwards from our air. A strange ascension it must have seemed to them.\r\n\r\nThe sphere rushed up with even greater velocity than, when weighed with\r\nthe lead sinkers, it had rushed down. It became exceedingly hot. It\r\ndrove up with the windows uppermost, and he remembers the torrent of\r\nbubbles frothing against the glass. Every moment he expected this to\r\nfly. Then suddenly something like a huge wheel seemed to be released in\r\nhis head, the padded compartment began spinning about him, and he\r\nfainted. His next recollection was of his cabin, and of the doctor’s\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBut that is the substance of the extraordinary story that Elstead\r\nrelated in fragments to the officers of the _Ptarmigan_. He promised to\r\nwrite it all down at a later date. His mind was chiefly occupied with\r\nthe improvement of his apparatus, which was effected at Rio.\r\n\r\nIt remains only to tell that on February 2d, 1896, he made his second\r\ndescent into the ocean abyss, with the improvements his first experience\r\nsuggested. What happened we shall probably never know. He never\r\nreturned. The _Ptarmigan_ beat about over the point of his submersion,\r\nseeking him in vain for thirteen days. Then she returned to Rio, and the\r\nnews was telegraphed to his friends. So the matter remains for the\r\npresent. But it is hardly probable that any further attempt will be made\r\nto verify his strange story of these hitherto unsuspected cities of the\r\ndeep sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            UNDER THE KNIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n“What if I die under it!” The thought recurred again and again as I\r\nwalked home from Haddon’s. It was a purely personal question. I was\r\nspared the deep anxieties of a married man, and I knew there were few of\r\nmy intimate friends but would find my death troublesome chiefly on\r\naccount of the duty of regret. I was surprised indeed, and perhaps a\r\nlittle humiliated, as I turned the matter over, to think how few could\r\npossibly exceed the conventional requirement. Things came before me\r\nstripped of glamour, in a clear dry light, during that walk from\r\nHaddon’s house over Primrose Hill. There were the friends of my youth: I\r\nperceived now that our affection was a tradition, which we foregathered\r\nrather laboriously to maintain. There were the rivals and helpers of my\r\nlater career. I suppose I had been cold-blooded or undemonstrative—one\r\nperhaps implies the other. It may be that even the capacity for\r\nfriendship is a question of physique. There had been a time in my own\r\nlife when I had grieved bitterly enough at the loss of a friend; but as\r\nI walked home that afternoon the emotional side of my imagination was\r\ndormant. I could not pity myself, nor feel sorry for my friends, nor\r\nconceive of them as grieving for me.\r\n\r\nI was interested in this deadness of my emotional nature,—no doubt a\r\nconcomitant of my stagnating physiology; and my thoughts wandered off\r\nalong the line it suggested. Once before, in my hot youth, I had\r\nsuffered a sudden loss of blood, and had been within an ace of death. I\r\nremembered now that my affections as well as my passions had drained out\r\nof me, leaving scarce anything but a tranquil resignation and the\r\nfaintest dreg of self-pity. It had been weeks before the old ambitions,\r\nand tendernesses, and all the complex moral interplay of a man had\r\nreasserted themselves. It occurred to me that the real meaning of this\r\nnumbness might be a gradual slipping away from the pleasure-pain\r\nguidance of the animal man. It has been proven, I take it, as thoroughly\r\nas anything can be proven in this world, that the higher emotions, the\r\nmoral feelings, even the subtle tenderness of love, are evolved from the\r\nelemental desires and fears of the simple animal: they are the harness\r\nin which man’s mental freedom goes. And, it may be that, as death\r\novershadows us, as our possibility of acting diminishes, this complex\r\ngrowth of balanced impulse, propensity, and aversion, whose interplay\r\ninspires our acts, goes with it. Leaving what?\r\n\r\nI was suddenly brought back to reality by an imminent collision with a\r\nbutcher-boy’s tray. I found that I was crossing the bridge over the\r\nRegent’s Park Canal which runs parallel with the bridge in the\r\nZoölogical Gardens. The boy in blue had been looking over his shoulder\r\nat a black barge advancing slowly, towed by a gaunt white horse. In the\r\nGardens a nurse was leading three happy little children over the bridge.\r\nThe trees were bright green; the spring hopefulness was still unstained\r\nby the dusts of summer; the sky in the water was bright and clear, but\r\nbroken by long waves, by quivering bands of black, as the barge drove\r\nthrough. The breeze was stirring; but it did not stir me as the spring\r\nbreeze used to do.\r\n\r\nWas this dulness of feeling in itself an anticipation? It was curious\r\nthat I could reason and follow out a network of suggestion as clearly as\r\never; so, at least, it seemed to me. It was calmness rather than dulness\r\nthat was coming upon me. Was there any ground for the belief in the\r\npresentiment of death? Did a man near to death begin instinctively to\r\nwithdraw himself from the meshes of matter and sense, even before the\r\ncold hand was laid upon his? I felt strangely isolated—isolated without\r\nregret—from the life and existence about me. The children playing in the\r\nsun and gathering strength and experience for the business of life, the\r\npark-keeper gossiping with a nurse-maid, the nursing mother, the young\r\ncouple intent upon each other as they passed me, the trees by the\r\nwayside spreading new pleading leaves to the sunlight, the stir in their\r\nbranches—I had been part of it all, but I had nearly done with it now.\r\n\r\nSome way down the Broad Walk I perceived that I was tired, and that my\r\nfeet were heavy. It was hot that afternoon, and I turned aside and sat\r\ndown on one of the green chairs that line the way. In a minute I had\r\ndozed into a dream, and the tide of my thoughts washed up a vision of\r\nthe Resurrection. I was still sitting in the chair, but I thought myself\r\nactually dead, withered, tattered, dried, one eye (I saw) pecked out by\r\nbirds. “Awake!” cried a voice; and incontinently the dust of the path\r\nand the mould under the grass became insurgent. I had never before\r\nthought of Regent’s Park as a cemetery, but now, through the trees,\r\nstretching as far as eye could see, I beheld a flat plain of writhing\r\ngraves and heeling tombstones. There seemed to be some trouble, the\r\nrising dead appeared to stifle as they struggled upward, they bled in\r\ntheir struggles, the red flesh was tattered away from the white bones.\r\n“Awake!” cried a voice; but I determined I would not rise to such\r\nhorrors. “Awake!” They would not let me alone. “Wike up!” said an angry\r\nvoice. A cockney angel! The man who sells the tickets was shaking me,\r\ndemanding my penny.\r\n\r\nI paid my penny, pocketed my ticket, yawned, stretched my legs, and\r\nfeeling now rather less torpid, got up and walked on towards Langham\r\nPlace. I speedily lost myself again in a shifting maze of thoughts about\r\ndeath. Going across Marylebone Road into that crescent at the end of\r\nLangham Place, I had the narrowest escape from the shaft of a cab, and\r\nwent on my way with a palpitating heart and a bruised shoulder. It\r\nstruck me that it would have been curious if my meditations on my death\r\non the morrow had led to my death that day.\r\n\r\nBut I will not weary you with more of my experiences that day and the\r\nnext. I knew more and more certainly that I should die under the\r\noperation; at times I think I was inclined to pose to myself. The\r\ndoctors were coming at eleven, and I did not get up. It seemed scarce\r\nworth while to trouble about washing and dressing, and, though I read my\r\nnewspapers and the letters that came by the first post, I did not find\r\nthem very interesting. There was a friendly note from Addison, my old\r\nschool friend, calling my attention to two discrepancies and a printer’s\r\nerror in my new book; with one from Langridge, venting some vexation\r\nover Minton. The rest were business communications. I breakfasted in\r\nbed. The glow of pain at my side seemed more massive. I knew it was\r\npain, and yet, if you can understand, I did not find it very painful. I\r\nhad been awake and hot and thirsty in the night, but in the morning bed\r\nfelt comfortable. In the night-time I had lain thinking of things that\r\nwere past; in the morning I dozed over the question of immortality.\r\nHaddon came, punctual to the minute, with a neat black bag; and Mowbray\r\nsoon followed. Their arrival stirred me up a little. I began to take a\r\nmore personal interest in the proceedings. Haddon moved the little\r\noctagonal table close to the bedside, and with his broad black back to\r\nme began taking things out of his bag. I heard the light click of steel\r\nupon steel. My imagination, I found, was not altogether stagnant. “Will\r\nyou hurt me much?” I said, in an off-hand tone.\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” Haddon answered over his shoulder. “We shall chloroform\r\nyou. Your heart’s as sound as a bell.” And, as he spoke, I had a whiff\r\nof the pungent sweetness of the anæsthetic.\r\n\r\nThey stretched me out, with a convenient exposure of my side, and,\r\nalmost before I realised what was happening, the chloroform was being\r\nadministered. It stings the nostrils and there is a suffocating\r\nsensation, at first. I knew I should die,—that this was the end of\r\nconsciousness for me. And suddenly I felt that I was not prepared for\r\ndeath; I had a vague sense of a duty overlooked—I knew not what. What\r\nwas it I had not done? I could think of nothing more to do, nothing\r\ndesirable left in life; and yet I had the strangest disinclination to\r\ndeath. And the physical sensation was painfully oppressive. Of course\r\nthe doctors did not know they were going to kill me. Possibly I\r\nstruggled. Then I fell motionless, and a great silence, a monstrous\r\nsilence, and an impenetrable blackness, came upon me.\r\n\r\nThere must have been an interval of absolute unconsciousness, seconds or\r\nminutes. Then, with a chilly, unemotional clearness, I perceived that I\r\nwas not yet dead. I was still in my body; but all the multitudinous\r\nsensations that come sweeping from it to make up the background of\r\nconsciousness, had gone, leaving me free of it all. No, not free of it\r\nall; for as yet something still held me to the poor stark flesh upon the\r\nbed, held me, yet not so closely that I did not feel myself external to\r\nit, independent of it, straining away from it. I do not think I saw, I\r\ndo not think I heard; but I perceived all that was going on, and it was\r\nas if I both heard and saw. Haddon was bending over me, Mowbray behind\r\nme; the scalpel—it was a large scalpel—was cutting my flesh at the side\r\nunder the flying ribs. It was interesting to see myself cut like cheese,\r\nwithout a pang, without even a qualm. The interest was much of a quality\r\nwith that one might feel in a game of chess between strangers. Haddon’s\r\nface was firm, and his hand steady; but I was surprised to perceive\r\n(_how_ I know now) that he was feeling the gravest doubt as to his own\r\nwisdom in the conduct of the operation.\r\n\r\nMowbray’s thoughts, too, I could see. He was thinking that Haddon’s\r\nmanner showed too much of the specialist. New suggestions came up like\r\nbubbles through a stream of frothing meditation, and burst one after\r\nanother in the little bright spot of his consciousness. He could not\r\nhelp noticing and admiring Haddon’s swift dexterity, in spite of his\r\nenvious quality and his disposition to detract. I saw my liver exposed.\r\nI was puzzled at my own condition. I did not feel that I was dead, but I\r\nwas different in some way from my living self. The grey depression that\r\nhad weighed on me for a year or more, and coloured all my thoughts, was\r\ngone. I perceived and thought without any emotional tint at all. I\r\nwondered if every one perceived things in this way under chloroform, and\r\nforgot it again when he came out of it. It would be inconvenient to look\r\ninto some heads, and not forget.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did not think that I was dead, I still perceived, quite\r\nclearly, that I was soon to die. This brought me back to the\r\nconsideration of Haddon’s proceedings. I looked into his mind, and saw\r\nthat he was afraid of cutting a branch of the portal vein. My attention\r\nwas distracted from details by the curious changes going on in his mind.\r\nHis consciousness was like the quivering little spot of light which is\r\nthrown by the mirror of a galvanometer. His thoughts ran under it like a\r\nstream, some through the focus bright and distinct, some shadowy in the\r\nhalf-light of the edge. Just now the little glow was steady; but the\r\nleast movement on Mowbray’s part, the slightest sound from outside, even\r\na faint difference in the slow movement of the living flesh he was\r\ncutting, set the light-spot shivering and spinning. A new\r\nsense-impression came rushing up through the flow of thoughts; and lo!\r\nthe light-spot jerked away towards it, swifter than a frightened fish.\r\nIt was wonderful to think that upon that unstable, fitful thing depended\r\nall the complex motions of the man, that for the next five minutes,\r\ntherefore, my life hung upon its movements. And he was growing more and\r\nmore nervous in his work. It was as if a little picture of a cut vein\r\ngrew brighter, and struggled to oust from his brain another picture of a\r\ncut falling short of the mark. He was afraid: his dread of cutting too\r\nlittle was battling with his dread of cutting too far.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, like an escape of water from under a lock gate, a great\r\nuprush of horrible realisation set all his thoughts swirling, and\r\nsimultaneously I perceived that the vein was cut. He started back with a\r\nhoarse exclamation, and I saw the brown-purple blood gather in a swift\r\nbead, and run trickling. He was horrified. He pitched the red-stained\r\nscalpel on to the octagonal table; and instantly both doctors flung\r\nthemselves upon me, making hasty and ill-conceived efforts to remedy the\r\ndisaster. “Ice,” said Mowbray, gasping. But I knew that I was killed,\r\nthough my body still clung to me.\r\n\r\nI will not describe their belated endeavours to save me, though I\r\nperceived every detail. My perceptions were sharper and swifter than\r\nthey had ever been in life; my thoughts rushed through my mind with\r\nincredible swiftness, but with perfect definition. I can only compare\r\ntheir crowded clarity to the effects of a reasonable dose of opium. In a\r\nmoment it would all be over, and I should be free. I knew I was\r\nimmortal, but what would happen I did not know. Should I drift off\r\npresently, like a puff of smoke from a gun, in some kind of\r\nhalf-material body, an attenuated version of my material self? Should I\r\nfind myself suddenly among the innumerable hosts of the dead, and know\r\nthe world about me for the phantasmagoria it had always seemed? Should I\r\ndrift to some spiritualistic _séance_, and there make foolish,\r\nincomprehensible attempts to affect a purblind medium? It was a state of\r\nunemotional curiosity, of colourless expectation. And then I realised a\r\ngrowing stress upon me, a feeling as though some huge human magnet was\r\ndrawing me upward out of my body. The stress grew and grew. I seemed an\r\natom, for which monstrous forces were fighting. For one brief, terrible\r\nmoment sensation came back to me. That feeling of falling headlong which\r\ncomes in nightmares, that feeling a thousand times intensified, that and\r\na black horror swept across my thoughts in a torrent. Then the two\r\ndoctors, the naked body with its cut side, the little room, swept away\r\nfrom under me, and vanished, as a speck of foam vanishes down an eddy.\r\n\r\nI was in mid-air. Far below was the West End of London, receding\r\nrapidly,—for I seemed to be flying swiftly upward,—and, as it receded,\r\npassing westward like a panorama. I could see through the faint haze of\r\nsmoke the innumerable roofs chimney-set, the narrow roadways stippled\r\nwith people and conveyances, the little specks of squares, and the\r\nchurch steeples like thorns sticking out of the fabric. But it spun away\r\nas the earth rotated on its axis, and in a few seconds (as it seemed) I\r\nwas over the scattered clumps of town about Ealing, the little Thames a\r\nthread of blue to the south, and the Chiltern Hills and the North Downs\r\ncoming up like the rim of a basin, far away and faint with haze. Up I\r\nrushed. And at first I had not the faintest conception what this\r\nheadlong upward rush could mean.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the circle of scenery beneath me grew wider and wider, and\r\nthe details of town and field, of hill and valley, got more and more\r\nhazy and pale and indistinct, a luminous grey was mingled more and more\r\nwith the blue of the hills and the green of the open meadows; and a\r\nlittle patch of cloud, low and far to the west, shone ever more\r\ndazzlingly white. Above, as the veil of atmosphere between myself and\r\nouter space grew thinner, the sky, which had been a fair springtime blue\r\nat first, grew deeper and richer in colour, passing steadily through the\r\nintervening shades, until presently it was as dark as the blue sky of\r\nmidnight, and presently as black as the blackness of a frosty starlight,\r\nand at last as black as no blackness I had ever beheld. And first one\r\nstar, and then many, and at last an innumerable host, broke out upon the\r\nsky: more stars than any one has ever seen from the face of the earth.\r\nFor the blueness of the sky is the light of the sun and stars sifted and\r\nspread abroad blindingly; there is diffused light even in the darkest\r\nskies of winter, and we do not see their light by day because of the\r\ndazzling irradiation of the sun. But now I saw things—I know not how;\r\nassuredly with no mortal eyes—and that defect of bedazzlement blinded me\r\nno longer. The sun was incredibly strange and wonderful. The body of it\r\nwas a disc of blinding white light; not yellowish as it seems to those\r\nwho live upon the earth, but livid white, all streaked with scarlet\r\nstreaks, and rimmed about with a fringe of writhing tongues of red fire.\r\nAnd, shooting halfway across the heavens from either side of it, and\r\nbrighter than the Milky Way, were two pinions of silver-white, making it\r\nlook more like those winged globes I have seen in Egyptian sculpture,\r\nthan anything else I can remember upon earth. These I knew for the solar\r\ncorona, though I had never seen anything of it but a picture during the\r\ndays of my earthly life.\r\n\r\nWhen my attention came back to the earth again, I saw that it had fallen\r\nvery far away from me. Field and town were long since indistinguishable,\r\nand all the varied hues of the country were merging into a uniform\r\nbright grey, broken only by the brilliant white of the clouds that lay\r\nscattered in flocculent masses over Ireland and the west of England. For\r\nnow I could see the outlines of the north of France and Ireland, and all\r\nthis island of Britain, save where Scotland passed over the horizon to\r\nthe north, or where the coast was blurred or obliterated by cloud. The\r\nsea was a dull grey, and darker than the land; and the whole panorama\r\nwas rotating slowly towards the east.\r\n\r\nAll this had happened so swiftly that, until I was some thousand miles\r\nor so from the earth, I had no thought for myself. But now I perceived I\r\nhad neither hands nor feet, parts nor organs, and that I felt neither\r\nalarm nor pain. All about me, I perceived that the vacancy (for I had\r\nalready left the air behind) was cold beyond the imagination of man; but\r\nit troubled me not. The sun’s rays shot through the void, powerless to\r\nlight or heat until they should strike on matter in their course. I saw\r\nthings with a serene self-forgetfulness, even as if I were God. And down\r\nbelow there, rushing away from me,—countless miles in a second,—where a\r\nlittle dark spot on the grey marked the position of London, two doctors\r\nwere struggling to restore life to the poor hacked and outworn shell I\r\nhad abandoned. I felt then such release, such serenity, as I can compare\r\nto no earthly delight I have ever known.\r\n\r\nIt was only after I had perceived all these things that the meaning of\r\nthat headlong rush of the earth grew into comprehension. Yet it was so\r\nsimple, so obvious, that I was amazed at my never anticipating the thing\r\nthat was happening to me. I had suddenly been cut adrift from matter:\r\nall that was material of me was there upon earth, whirling away through\r\nspace, held to the earth by gravitation, partaking of the earth-inertia,\r\nmoving in its wreath of epicycles round the sun, and with the sun and\r\nthe planets on their vast march through space. But the immaterial has no\r\ninertia, feels nothing of the pull of matter for matter: where it parts\r\nfrom its garment of flesh there it remains (so far as space concerns it\r\nany longer) immovable in space. _I_ was not leaving the earth: the earth\r\nwas leaving _me_, and not only the earth but the whole solar system was\r\nstreaming past. And about me in space, invisible to me, scattered in the\r\nwake of the earth upon its journey, there must be an innumerable\r\nmultitude of souls, stripped like myself of the material, stripped like\r\nmyself of the passions of the individual and the generous emotions of\r\nthe gregarious brute, naked intelligences, things of newborn wonder and\r\nthought, marvelling at the strange release that had suddenly come on\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nAs I receded faster and faster from the strange white sun in the black\r\nheavens, and from the broad and shining earth upon which my being had\r\nbegun, I seemed to grow, in some incredible manner, vast: vast as\r\nregards this world I had left, vast as regards the moments and periods\r\nof a human life. Very soon I saw the full circle of the earth, slightly\r\ngibbous, like the moon when she nears her full, but very great; and the\r\nsilvery shape of America was now in the noonday blaze, wherein (as it\r\nseemed) little England had been basking but a few minutes ago. At first\r\nthe earth was large, and shone in the heavens, filling a great part of\r\nthem; but every moment she grew smaller and more distant. As she shrunk,\r\nthe broad moon in its third quarter crept into view over the rim of her\r\ndisc. I looked for the constellations. Only that part of Aries directly\r\nbehind the sun and the Lion which the earth covered were hidden. I\r\nrecognised the tortuous, tattered band of the Milky Way, with Vega very\r\nbright between sun and earth; and Sirius and Orion shone splendid\r\nagainst the unfathomable blackness in the opposite quarter of the\r\nheavens. The Polestar was overhead, and the Great Bear hung over the\r\ncircle of the earth. And away beneath and beyond the shining corona of\r\nthe sun were strange groupings of stars I had never seen in my life;\r\nnotably a dagger-shaped group that I knew for the Southern Cross. All\r\nthese were no larger than when they had shone on earth; but the little\r\nstars that one scarce sees shone now as brightly as the first magnitudes\r\nhad done, while the larger worlds were points of indescribable glory and\r\ncolour. Aldebaran was a spot of blood-red fire, and Sirius condensed to\r\none point the light of a world of sapphires. And they shone steadily:\r\nthey did not scintillate, they were calmly glorious. My impressions had\r\nan adamantine hardness and brightness; there was no blurring softness,\r\nno atmosphere, nothing but infinite darkness set with the myriads of\r\nthese acute and brilliant points and specks of light. Presently, when I\r\nlooked again, the little earth seemed no bigger than the sun, and it\r\ndwindled, and turned as I looked, until, in a second’s space (as it\r\nseemed to me), it was halved; and so it went on swiftly dwindling. Far\r\naway in the opposite direction a little pinkish pin’s head of light,\r\nshining steadily, was the planet Mars. I swam motionless in vacancy, and\r\nwithout a trace of terror or astonishment, watched the speck of cosmic\r\ndust we call the world fall away from me.\r\n\r\nPresently it dawned upon me that my sense of duration had changed: that\r\nmy mind was moving not faster, but infinitely slower; that between each\r\nseparate impression there was a period of many days. The moon spun once\r\nround the earth as I noted this; and I perceived, clearly, the motion of\r\nMars in his orbit. Moreover it appeared as if the time between thought\r\nand thought grew steadily greater, until at last a thousand years was\r\nbut a moment in my perception.\r\n\r\nAt first the constellations had shone motionless against the black\r\nbackground of infinite space; but presently it seemed as though the\r\ngroup of stars about Hercules and the Scorpion was contracting, while\r\nOrion and Aldebaran and their neighbours were scattering apart. Flashing\r\nsuddenly out of the darkness, there came a flying multitude of particles\r\nof rock, glittering like dust-specks in a sunbeam and encompassed in a\r\nfaintly luminous haze. They swirled all about me and vanished again in a\r\ntwinkling far behind. And then I saw that a bright spot of light, that\r\nshone a little to one side of my path, was growing very rapidly larger,\r\nand perceived that it was the planet Saturn rushing towards me. Larger\r\nand larger it grew, swallowing up the heavens behind it, and hiding\r\nevery moment a fresh multitude of stars. I perceived its flattened\r\nwhirling body, its disc-like belt, and seven of its little satellites.\r\nIt grew and grew, till it towered enormous, and then I plunged amid a\r\nstreaming multitude of clashing stones and dancing dust-particles and\r\ngas-eddies, and saw for a moment the mighty triple belt like three\r\nconcentric arches of moonlight above me, its shadow black on the boiling\r\ntumult below. These things happened in one tenth of the time it takes to\r\ntell of them. The planet went by like a flash of lightning; for a few\r\nseconds it blotted out the sun, and there and then became a mere black,\r\ndwindling, winged patch against the light. The earth, the mother mote of\r\nmy being, I could no longer see.\r\n\r\nSo with a stately swiftness, in the profoundest silence, the solar\r\nsystem fell from me, as it had been a garment, until the sun was a mere\r\nstar amid the multitude of stars, with its eddy of planet-specks lost in\r\nthe confused glittering of the remoter light. I was no longer a denizen\r\nof the solar system: I had come to the Outer Universe, I seemed to grasp\r\nand comprehend the whole world of matter. Ever more swiftly the stars\r\nclosed in about the spot where Antares and Vega had vanished in a\r\nluminous haze, until that part of the sky had the semblance of a\r\nwhirling mass of nebulæ, and ever before me yawned vaster gaps of vacant\r\nblackness, and the stars shone fewer and fewer. It seemed as if I moved\r\ntowards a point between Orion’s belt and sword; and the void about that\r\nregion opened vaster and vaster every second, an incredible gulf of\r\nnothingness into which I was falling. Faster and ever faster the\r\nuniverse rushed by, a hurry of whirling motes at last, speeding silently\r\ninto the void. Stars, glowing brighter and brighter, with their circling\r\nplanets catching the light in a ghostly fashion as I neared them, shone\r\nout and vanished again into inexistence; faint comets, clusters of\r\nmeteorites, winking specks of matter, eddying light points whizzed past,\r\nsome perhaps a hundred millions of miles or so from me at most, few\r\nnearer, travelling with unimaginable rapidity, shooting constellations,\r\nmomentary darts of fire through the black night. More than anything else\r\nit was like a dusty draught, sunbeam-lit. Broader and wider and deeper\r\ngrew the starless space, the vacant Beyond, into which I was being\r\ndrawn. At last a quarter of the heavens was black and blank, and the\r\nwhole headlong rush of stellar universe closed in behind me like a veil\r\nof light that is gathered together. It drove away from me like a\r\nmonstrous Jack-o’-lantern driven by the wind. I had come out into the\r\nwilderness of space. Even the vacant blackness grew broader, until the\r\nhosts of the stars seemed only like a swarm of fiery specks hurrying\r\naway from me, inconceivably remote, and the darkness, the nothingness\r\nand emptiness, was about me on every side. Soon the little universe of\r\nmatter, the cage of points in which I had begun to be, was dwindling,\r\nnow to a whirling disc of luminous glittering, and now to one minute\r\ndisc of hazy light. In a little while it would shrink to a point, and at\r\nlast would vanish altogether.\r\n\r\nSuddenly feeling came back to me: feeling in the shape of overwhelming\r\nterror,—such a dread of those dark vastitudes as no words can describe,\r\na passionate resurgence of sympathy and social desire. Were there other\r\nsouls, invisible to me as I to them, about me in the blackness? or was I\r\nindeed, even as I felt, alone? Had I passed out of being into something\r\nthat was neither being nor not-being? The covering of the body, the\r\ncovering of matter had been torn from me, and the hallucinations of\r\ncompanionship and security. Everything was black and silent. I had\r\nceased to be. I was nothing. There was nothing, save only that\r\ninfinitesimal dot of light that dwindled in the gulf. I strained myself\r\nto hear and see, and for a while there was naught but infinite silence,\r\nintolerable darkness, horror, and despair.\r\n\r\nThen I saw that about the spot of light into which the whole world of\r\nmatter had shrunk, there was a faint glow. And in a band on either side\r\nof that the darkness was not absolute. I watched it for ages, as it\r\nseemed to me, and through the long waiting the haze grew imperceptibly\r\nmore distinct. And then about the band appeared an irregular cloud of\r\nthe faintest, palest brown. I felt a passionate impatience; but the\r\nthings grew brighter so slowly that they scarce seemed to change. What\r\nwas unfolding itself? What was this strange reddish dawn in the\r\ninterminable night of space?\r\n\r\nThe cloud’s shape was grotesque. It seemed to be looped along its lower\r\nside into four projecting masses, and, above, it ended in a straight\r\nline. What phantom was it? I felt assured I had seen that figure before;\r\nbut I could not think what, nor where, nor when it was. Then the\r\nrealisation rushed upon me. _It was a clenched hand._ I was alone, in\r\nspace, alone with this huge, shadowy Hand, upon which the whole Universe\r\nof Matter lay like an unconsidered speck of dust. It seemed as though I\r\nwatched it through vast periods of time. On the forefinger glittered a\r\nring; and the universe from which I had come was but a spot of light\r\nupon the ring’s curvature. And the thing that the Hand gripped had the\r\nlikeness of a black rod. Through a long eternity I watched the Hand,\r\nwith the ring and the rod, marvelling and fearing and waiting helplessly\r\non what might follow. It seemed as though nothing could follow: that I\r\nshould watch forever, seeing only the Hand and the thing it held, and\r\nunderstanding nothing of its import. Was the whole universe but a\r\nrefracting speck upon some greater Being? Were our worlds but the atoms\r\nof another universe, and those again of another, and so on through an\r\nendless progression? And what was I? Was I indeed immaterial? A vague\r\npersuasion of a body gathering about me came into my suspense. The\r\nabysmal darkness about the Hand filled with impalpable suggestions, with\r\nuncertain, fluctuating shapes.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, came a sound, like the sound of a tolling bell: faint,\r\nas if infinitely far; muffled, as though heard through thick swathings\r\nof darkness,—a deep vibrating resonance with vast gulfs of silence\r\nbetween each stroke. And the Hand appeared to tighten on the rod. And I\r\nsaw far above the Hand, towards the apex of the darkness, a circle of\r\ndim phosphorescence, a ghostly sphere whence these sounds came\r\nthrobbing; and at the last stroke the Hand vanished, for the hour had\r\ncome, and I heard a noise of many waters. But the black rod remained as\r\na great band across the sky. And then a voice, which seemed to run to\r\nthe uttermost parts of space, spoke, saying: “There will be no more\r\npain.”\r\n\r\nAt that an almost intolerable gladness and radiance rushed in upon me,\r\nand I saw the circle shining white and bright, and the rod black and\r\nshining, and many other things else distinct and clear. And the circle\r\nwas the face of the clock, and the rod the rail of my bed. Haddon was\r\nstanding at the foot, against the rail, with a small pair of scissors on\r\nhis fingers; and the hands of my clock on the mantel over his shoulder\r\nwere clasped together over the hour of twelve. Mowbray was washing\r\nsomething in a basin at the octagonal table, and at my side I felt a\r\nsubdued feeling that could scarce be spoken of as pain.\r\n\r\nThe operation had not killed me. And I perceived suddenly that the dull\r\nmelancholy of half a year was lifted from my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE RECONCILIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTemple had scarcely been with Findlay five minutes before he felt his\r\nold resentments, and the memory of that unforgettable wrong growing\r\nvivid again. But with the infatuation of his good resolution still upon\r\nhim, he maintained the air of sham reconciliation that Findlay had\r\nwelcomed so eagerly. They talked of this and that, carefully avoiding\r\nthe matter of the separation. Temple at first spoke chiefly of his\r\ntravels. He stood between the cabinet of minerals and the fireplace, his\r\nwhiskey on the mantel-board, while Findlay sat with his chair pushed\r\nback from his writing-desk, on which were scattered the dozen little\r\nskulls of hedgehogs and shrew mice upon which he had been working.\r\n\r\nTemple’s eye fell upon them, and abruptly brought his mind round from\r\nthe topic of West Africa. “And you—” said Temple. “While I have been\r\nwandering I suppose you have been going on steadily.”\r\n\r\n“Drumming along,” said Findlay.\r\n\r\n“To the Royal Society and fame and all the things we used to dream\r\nabout—How long is it?”\r\n\r\n“Five years—since our student days.”\r\n\r\nTemple glanced round the room, and his eye rested for a moment on a\r\nround greyish-drab object that lay in the corner near the door. “The\r\nsame fat books and folios, only more of them, the same smell of old\r\nbones, and a dissection—is it the same one?—in the window. Fame is\r\n_your_ mistress?”\r\n\r\n“Fame,” said Findlay. “But it’s hardly fame. The herd outside say,\r\n‘Eminence in comparative anatomy.’”\r\n\r\n“Eminence in comparative anatomy. No marrying—no avarice.”\r\n\r\n“None,” said Findlay, glancing askance at him.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it’s the happiest way of living. But it wouldn’t be the thing\r\nfor me. Excitement—but, I say!”—his eye had fallen again on that fungoid\r\nshape of drabbish-grey—“there’s a limit to scientific inhumanity. You\r\nreally mustn’t keep your door open with a human brainpan.”\r\n\r\nHe went across the room as he spoke and picked the thing up. “Brainpan!”\r\nsaid Findlay. “Oh, _that_! Man alive, that’s not a brainpan. Where’s\r\nyour science?”\r\n\r\n“No. I see it’s not,” said Temple, carrying the object in his hand as he\r\ncame back to his former position and scrutinising it curiously. “But\r\nwhat the devil is it?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you know?” said Findlay.\r\n\r\nThe thing was about thrice the size of a man’s hand, like a rough\r\nwatch-pocket of thick bone.\r\n\r\nFindlay laughed almost naturally. “You have a bad memory—It’s a whale’s\r\near-bone.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Temple, his appearance of interest vanishing. “The\r\n_bulla_ of a whale. I’ve forgotten a lot of these things.”\r\n\r\nHe half turned, and put the thing on the top of the cabinet beside\r\nFindlay’s dumb-bells.\r\n\r\n“If you are serious in your music-hall proposal,” he said, reverting to\r\na jovial suggestion of Findlay’s, “I am at your service. I’m afraid—I\r\nmay find myself a little old for that sort of thing—I haven’t tried one\r\nfor ages.”\r\n\r\n“But we are meeting to commemorate youth,” said Findlay.\r\n\r\n“And bury our early manhood,” said Temple. “Well, well—yes, let us go to\r\nthe music hall, by all means, if you desire it. It is trivial—and\r\nappropriate. We want no tragic issues.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the men returned to Findlay’s study the little clock in the dimness\r\non the mantel-shelf was pointing to half-past one. After the departure\r\nthe little brown room, with its books and bones, was undisturbed, save\r\nfor the two visits Findlay’s attentive servant paid, to see to the fire\r\nand to pull down the blinds and draw the curtains. The ticking of the\r\nclock was the only sound in the quiet. Now and then the fire flickered\r\nand stirred, sending blood-red reflections chasing the shadows across\r\nthe ceiling, and bringing into ghostly transitory prominence some\r\ngrotesque grouping of animals’ bones or skulls upon the shelves. At last\r\nthe stillness was broken by the unlatching and slamming of the heavy\r\nstreet door and the sound of unsteady footsteps approaching along the\r\npassage. Then the door opened, and the two men came into the warm\r\nfirelight.\r\n\r\nTemple came in first, his brown face flushed with drink, his coat\r\nunbuttoned, his hands deep in his trousers’ pockets. His Christmas\r\nresolution had long since dissolved in alcohol. He was a little puzzled\r\nto find himself in Findlay’s company. And his fuddled brain insisted\r\nupon inopportune reminiscence. He walked straight to the fire and stood\r\nbefore it, an exaggerated black figure, staring down into the red glow.\r\n“After all,” he said, “we are fools to quarrel—fools to quarrel about a\r\nlittle thing like that. Damned fools!”\r\n\r\nFindlay went to the writing-table and felt about for the matches with\r\nquivering hands.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t my doing,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t your doing,” said Temple. “Nothing ever was your doing. You\r\nare always in the right—Findlay the all-right.”\r\n\r\nFindlay’s attention was concentrated upon the lamp. His hand was\r\nunsteady, and he had some difficulty in turning up the wicks; one got\r\njammed down and the other flared furiously. When at last it was lit and\r\nturned up, he came up to Temple. “Take your coat off, old man, and have\r\nsome more whiskey,” he said. “That was a ripping little girl in the\r\nskirt dance.”\r\n\r\n“Fools to quarrel,” said Temple, slowly, and then woke up to Findlay’s\r\nwords. “Heigh?”\r\n\r\n“Take off your coat and sit down,” said Findlay, moving up the little\r\nmetal table and producing cigars and a syphon and whiskey. “That lamp\r\ngives an infernally bad light, but it is all I have. Something wrong\r\nwith the oil. Did you notice the drudge of that stone-smashing trick?”\r\n\r\nTemple remained erect and gloomy, staring into the fire. “Fools to\r\nquarrel,” he said. Findlay was now half drunk, and his finesse began to\r\nleave him. Temple had been drinking heavily, and was now in a curious\r\nrambling stage. And Findlay’s one idea now was to close this curious\r\nreunion.\r\n\r\n“There’s no woman worth a man’s friendship,” said Temple, abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe sat down in an easy chair, poured out and drank a dose of whiskey and\r\nlithia. The idea of friendship took possession of him, and he became\r\nreminiscent of student days and student adventures. For some time it\r\nwas, “Do you remember” this, and “Do you remember” that. And Findlay\r\ngrew cheerful again.\r\n\r\n“They were glorious times,” said Findlay, pouring whiskey into Temple’s\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThen Temple startled him by abruptly reverting to that bitter quarrel.\r\n“No woman in the world,” he said. “Curse them!”\r\n\r\nHe began to laugh stupidly. “After all—” he said, “in the end.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, damn!” said Findlay.\r\n\r\n“All very well for you to swear,” said Temple, “but you forget about me.\r\n’Tain’t your place to swear. If only you’d left things alone—”\r\n\r\n“I thought the pass-word was forget,” said Findlay.\r\n\r\nTemple stared into the fire for a space, “Forget,” he said, and then\r\nwith a curious return to a clarity of speech, “Findlay, I’m getting\r\ndrunk.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense, man, take some more.”\r\n\r\nTemple rose out of his chair with the look of one awakening. “There’s no\r\nreason why I should get drunk, because—”\r\n\r\n“Drink,” said Findlay, “and forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Faugh! I want to stick my head in water. I want to think. What the\r\ndeuce am I doing here, with _you_ of all people.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! _Talk_ and forget it, if you won’t drink. Do you remember old\r\nJason and the boxing-gloves? I wonder whether you could put up your\r\nfives now.”\r\n\r\nTemple stood with his back to the fire, his brain spinning with drink,\r\nand the old hatred of Findlay came back in flood. He sought in his mind\r\nfor some offensive thing to say, and his face grew dark. Findlay saw\r\nthat a crisis was upon him and he cursed under his breath. His air of\r\nconviviality, his pose of hearty comforter, grew more and more\r\ndifficult. But what else was there to do?\r\n\r\n“Old Jason—full of science and as slow as an elephant!—but he made\r\nboxers of us. Do you remember our little set-to—at that place in Gower\r\nStreet?”\r\n\r\nTo show his innocent liveliness, his freedom from preoccupation, Findlay\r\npushed his chair aside, and stepped out into the middle of the room.\r\nThere he began to pose in imitation of Jason, and to give a colourable\r\ntravesty of the old prize-fighter’s instructions. He picked up his\r\nboxing-gloves from the shelf in the recess, and slipped them on. Temple,\r\nlowering there, on the brink of an explosion, was almost too much for\r\nhis nerves. He felt his display of high spirits was a mistake, but he\r\nmust go through with it now.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stand glooming there, man. You’re in just that state when the\r\nworld looks black as ink. Drink yourself merry again. There’s no woman\r\nin the world worth a man’s friendship—that’s agreed upon. Come and have\r\na bout with these gloves of mine—four-ounce gloves. There’s nothing sets\r\nthe blood and spirits stirring like that.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Temple, quite mechanically. And then, waking up to\r\nwhat he was doing, “Where are the other gloves?”\r\n\r\n“Over there in the corner. On the top of the mineral cabinet. By Jove!\r\nTemple, this is like old times!”\r\n\r\nTemple, quivering strangely, went to the corner. He meant to thrash\r\nFindlay, and knew that in spite of his lighter weight he would do it.\r\nYet it seemed puerile and inadequate to the pitch of absurdity for the\r\nwrong Findlay had done him was great. And, putting his hand on something\r\npale in the shadow, he touched the _bulla_ of the whale. The temptation\r\nwas like a lightning flash. He slipped one glove on his left hand, and\r\nthrust the fingers of his right into the cavity of the _bulla_. It took\r\nall his fingers, and covered his knuckles and all the back of his hand.\r\nAnd it was so oddly like a thumbless boxing-glove! Just the very shape\r\nof the padded part. His spirits rose abruptly at the sudden prospect of\r\na savage joke,—how savage it could be, he did not know. Meanwhile\r\nFindlay, with a nervous alacrity, moved the lamp into the corner behind\r\nthe armchair, and thrust his writing-desk into the window bay.\r\n\r\n“Come on,” said Findlay, behind him, and abruptly he turned.\r\n\r\nFindlay looked straight into his eyes, on guard, his hands half open. He\r\ndid not see the strange substitute for a glove that covered Temple’s\r\nright hand. Both men were gone so far towards drunkenness that their\r\npower of observation was obscured. For a moment they stood squaring at\r\none another, the host smiling, and his guest smiling also, but with his\r\nteeth set; two dark figures swaying in the firelight and the dim\r\nlamplight. Then Findlay struck at his opponent’s face with his left\r\nhand. As he did so Temple ducked slightly to the left, and struck\r\nsavagely over Findlay’s shoulder at his temple with the bone-covered\r\nfist. The blow was given with such tremendous force that it sent Findlay\r\nreeling sideways, half stunned, and overcome with astonishment. The\r\nthing struck his ear, and the side of his face went white at the blow.\r\nHe struggled to keep his footing, and as he did so Temple’s gloved right\r\nhand took him in the chest and sent him spinning to the foot of the\r\ncigar cabinet.\r\n\r\nFindlay’s eyes were wide open with astonishment. Temple was a lighter\r\nman by a stone or more than himself, and he did not understand how he\r\nhad been felled. He was not stunned, although he was so dulled by the\r\nblow as not to notice the blood running down his cheek from his ear. He\r\nlaughed insincerely, and, almost pulling the cigar cabinet over,\r\nscrambled to his feet, made as if he would speak, and put up his hand\r\ninstinctively as Temple struck out at him again, a feint with the left\r\nhand. Findlay was an expert boxer, and, anticipating another right-hand\r\nblow over the ear, struck sharply at once with his own left hand in\r\nTemple’s face, throwing his full weight into the blow, and dodging\r\nTemple’s reply.\r\n\r\nTemple’s upper lip was cut against his teeth, and the taste of blood and\r\nthe sight of it trickling down Findlay’s cheek destroyed the last\r\nvestiges of restraint that drink had left him, stripped off all that\r\neducation had ever done for him. There remained now only the savage\r\nman-animal, the creature that thirsts for blood. With a half bestial\r\ncry, he flung himself upon Findlay as he jumped back, and with a sudden\r\nsweep of his right arm cut down the defence, breaking Findlay’s arm just\r\nabove the wrist, and following with three rapid blows of the _bulla_\r\nupon the face. Findlay gave an inarticulate cry of astonishment,\r\ncountered weakly once, and then went down like a felled ox. As he fell,\r\nTemple fell kneeling upon the top of him. There was a smash as the lamp\r\nwent reeling.\r\n\r\nThe lamp was extinguished as it fell, and left the room red and black.\r\nFindlay struck heavily at Temple’s ribs, and Temple, with his left elbow\r\nat Findlay’s neck, swung up his right arm and struck down a\r\nsledge-hammer blow upon the face, and again and yet again, until the\r\nbody beneath his knees had ceased to writhe.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly his frenzy left him at the voice of a woman shrieking so\r\nthat it filled the room. He looked up and crouched motionless as he\r\nheard and saw the study door closing and heard the patter of feet\r\nretreating in panic. Then he looked down and saw the thing that had once\r\nbeen the face of Findlay. For an awful minute he remained kneeling\r\nagape.\r\n\r\nThen he staggered to his feet and stood over Findlay’s body in the glow\r\nof the dying fire, like a man awakening from a nightmare. Suddenly he\r\nperceived the _bulla_ on his hand, covered with blood and hair, and\r\nbegan to understand what had happened. In a sudden horror he flung the\r\ndiabolical thing from him. It struck the floor near the cigar cabinet,\r\nrolled for a yard or so on its edge, and came to rest in almost the\r\nposition it had occupied when he had first set eyes on it. To Temple’s\r\nexcited imagination it seemed to be lying at exactly the same spot, the\r\nsole and sufficient cause of Findlay’s death and his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      A SLIP UNDER THE MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the laboratory windows was a watery grey fog, and within a close\r\nwarmth and the yellow light of the green-shaded gas lamps that stood two\r\nto each table down its narrow length. On each table stood a couple of\r\nglass jars containing the mangled vestiges of the crayfish, mussels,\r\nfrogs, and guinea-pigs, upon which the students had been working, and\r\ndown the side of the room, facing the windows, were shelves bearing\r\nbleached dissections in spirit, surmounted by a row of beautifully\r\nexecuted anatomical drawings in white wood frames and overhanging a row\r\nof cubical lockers. All the doors of the laboratory were panelled with\r\nblackboard, and on these were the half-erased diagrams of the previous\r\nday’s work. The laboratory was empty, save for the demonstrator, who sat\r\nnear the preparation-room door, and silent, save for a low, continuous\r\nmurmur, and the clicking of the rocker microtome at which he was\r\nworking. But scattered about the room were traces of numerous students:\r\nhand-bags, polished boxes of instruments, in one place a large drawing\r\ncovered by newspaper, and in another a prettily bound copy of “News from\r\nNowhere,” a book oddly at variance with its surroundings. These things\r\nhad been put down hastily as the students had arrived and hurried at\r\nonce to secure their seats in the adjacent lecture-theatre. Deadened by\r\nthe closed door, the measured accents of the professor sounded as a\r\nfeatureless muttering.\r\n\r\nPresently, faint through the closed windows came the sound of the\r\nOratory clock striking the hour of eleven. The clicking of the microtome\r\nceased, and the demonstrator looked at his watch, rose, thrust his hands\r\ninto his pockets, and walked slowly down the laboratory towards the\r\nlecture-theatre door. He stood listening for a moment, and then his eye\r\nfell on the little volume by William Morris. He picked it up, glanced at\r\nthe title, smiled, opened it, looked at the name on the fly-leaf, ran\r\nthe leaves through with his hand, and put it down. Almost immediately\r\nthe even murmur of the lecturer ceased, there was a sudden burst of\r\npencils rattling on the desks in the lecture-theatre, a stirring, a\r\nscraping of feet, and a number of voices speaking together. Then a firm\r\nfootfall approached the door, which began to open, and stood ajar, as\r\nsome indistinctly heard question arrested the new-comer.\r\n\r\nThe demonstrator turned, walked slowly back past the microtome and left\r\nthe laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one,\r\nand then several students carrying note-books, entered the laboratory\r\nfrom the lecture-theatre, and distributed themselves among the little\r\ntables, or stood in a group about the doorway. They were an\r\nexceptionally heterogeneous assembly,—for while Oxford and Cambridge\r\nstill recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of\r\nScience anticipated America in the matter years ago,—mixed socially,\r\ntoo, for the prestige of the College is high, and its scholarships, free\r\nof any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch\r\nuniversities. The class numbered one and twenty, but some remained in\r\nthe theatre questioning the professor, copying the blackboard diagrams\r\nbefore they were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had\r\nproduced to illustrate the day’s teaching. Of the nine who had come into\r\nthe laboratory, three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman\r\nwearing spectacles and dressed in greyish green, was peering out of the\r\nwindow at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking,\r\nplain-faced school-girls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons\r\nthey wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory and\r\nsat down in their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man who had once\r\nbeen a tailor, the other a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty,\r\ndressed in a well-fitting brown suit, young Wedderburn, the son of\r\nWedderburn the eye-specialist. The others formed a little knot near the\r\ntheatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure with a hunch\r\nback, sat on a bent wood stool, two others, one a short, dark youngster,\r\nand the other a flaxen-haired, reddish-complexioned young man, stood\r\nleaning side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth stood\r\nfacing them and maintained the larger share of the conversation.\r\n\r\nThis last person was named Hill. He was a sturdily built young fellow of\r\nthe same age as Wedderburn, he had a white face, dark grey eyes, hair of\r\nan indeterminate colour, and prominent, irregular features. He talked\r\nrather louder than was needful, and thrust his hands deeply into his\r\npockets. His collar was frayed and blue with the starch of a careless\r\nlaundress, his clothes were evidently ready-made, and there was a patch\r\non the side of his boot near the toe. And as he talked or listened to\r\nthe others, he glanced now and again towards the lecture-theatre door.\r\nThey were discussing the depressing peroration of the lecture they had\r\njust heard, the last lecture it was in the introductory course in\r\nZoölogy. “From ovum to ovum is the goal of the higher vertebrata,” the\r\nlecturer had said in his melancholy tones, and so had neatly rounded off\r\nthe sketch of comparative anatomy he had been developing. The spectacled\r\nhunchback had repeated it, with noisy appreciation, had tossed it\r\ntowards the fair-haired student with an evident provocation, and had\r\nstarted one of those vague, rambling discussions on generalities so\r\nunaccountably dear to the student mind all the world over.\r\n\r\n“That is our goal, perhaps,—I admit it,—as far as science goes,” said\r\nthe fair-haired student, rising to the challenge. “But there are things\r\nabove science.”\r\n\r\n“Science,” said Hill, confidently, “is systematic knowledge. Ideas that\r\ndon’t come into the system must anyhow—be loose ideas.” He was not quite\r\nsure whether that was a clever saying or a fatuity, until his hearers\r\ntook it seriously.\r\n\r\n“The thing I cannot understand,” said the hunchback, at large, “is\r\nwhether Hill is a materialist or not.”\r\n\r\n“There is one thing above matter,” said Hill, promptly, feeling he had a\r\nbetter thing this time, aware too of some one in the doorway behind him,\r\nand raising his voice a trifle for her benefit, “and that is—the\r\ndelusion that there is something above matter.”\r\n\r\n“So we have your gospel at last,” said the fair-haired student. “It’s\r\nall a delusion, is it? All our aspirations to lead something more than\r\ndogs’ lives, all our work for anything beyond ourselves. But see how\r\ninconsistent you are! Your socialism, for instance. Why do you trouble\r\nabout the interests of the race? Why do you concern yourself about the\r\nbeggar in the gutter? Why are you bothering yourself to lend that\r\nbook”—he indicated William Morris by a movement of the head—“to every\r\none in the lab?”\r\n\r\n“Girl,” said the hunchback, indistinctly, and glanced guiltily over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nThe girl in brown, with the brown eyes, had come into the laboratory,\r\nand stood on the other side of the table behind him with her rolled-up\r\napron in one hand, looking over her shoulder, listening to the\r\ndiscussion. She did not notice the hunchback, because she was glancing\r\nfrom Hill to his interlocutor. Hill’s consciousness of her presence\r\nbetrayed itself to her only in his studious ignorance of the fact; but\r\nshe understood that and it pleased her. “I see no reason,” said he, “why\r\na man should live like a brute because he knows of nothing beyond\r\nmatter, and does not expect to exist a hundred years hence.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t he?” said the fair-haired student.\r\n\r\n“Why _should_ he?” said Hill.\r\n\r\n“What inducement has he?”\r\n\r\n“That’s the way with all you religious people. It’s all a business of\r\ninducements. Cannot a man seek after righteousness for righteousness’\r\nsake?”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. The fair man answered with a kind of vocal padding,\r\n“But—you see—inducement—when I said inducement—” to gain time. And then\r\nthe hunchback came to his rescue and inserted a question. He was a\r\nterrible person in the debating society with his questions, and they\r\ninvariably took one form,—a demand for a definition. “What’s your\r\ndefinition of righteousness?” said the hunchback, at this stage.\r\n\r\nHill experienced a sudden loss of complacency at this question, but even\r\nas it was asked, relief came in the person of Brooks, the laboratory\r\nattendant, who entered by the preparation-room door, carrying a number\r\nof freshly-killed guinea-pigs by their hind-legs. “This is the last\r\nbatch of material this session,” said the youngster who had not\r\npreviously spoken. Brooks advanced up the laboratory, smacking down a\r\ncouple of guinea-pigs at each table, and the discussion perished\r\nabruptly as the students who were not already in their places hurried to\r\nthem to secure the choice of a specimen. There was a noise of keys\r\nrattling on split rings as lockers were opened, and dissecting\r\ninstruments taken out. Hill was already standing by his table, and his\r\nbox of scalpels was sticking out of his pocket. The girl in brown came a\r\nstep towards him, and leaning over his table, said softly, “Did you see\r\nthat I returned your book, Mr. Hill?”\r\n\r\nDuring the whole scene, she and the book had been vividly present in his\r\nconsciousness, but he made a clumsy pretence of looking at the book and\r\nseeing it for the first time. “Oh, yes,” he said, taking it up. “I see.\r\nDid you like it?”\r\n\r\n“I want to ask you some questions about it—sometime.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Hill. “I shall be glad.” He stopped awkwardly. “You\r\nliked it?” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonderful book. Only some things I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the laboratory was hushed by a curious braying noise. It\r\nwas the demonstrator. He was at the blackboard ready to begin the day’s\r\ninstruction, and it was his custom to demand silence by a sound midway\r\nbetween the “Er” of common intercourse, and the blast of a trumpet. The\r\ngirl in brown slipped back to her place, it was immediately in front of\r\nHill’s, and Hill, forgetting her forthwith, took a note-book out of the\r\ndrawer of his table, turned over its leaves hastily, drew a stumpy\r\npencil from his pocket, and prepared to make a copious note of the\r\ncoming demonstration. For demonstrations and lectures are the sacred\r\ntext of the College students. Books, saving only the professor’s own,\r\nyou may—it is even expedient to—ignore.\r\n\r\n\r\nHill was the son of a Landport cobbler, and had been hooked by a chance\r\nblue paper the authorities had thrown out to the Landport Technical\r\nCollege. He kept himself in London on his allowance of a guinea a week,\r\nand found that with proper care this also covered his clothing\r\nallowance, an occasional waterproof collar, that is, and ink and needles\r\nand cotton and such-like necessaries for a man about town. This was his\r\nfirst year and his first session, but the brown old man in Landport had\r\nalready got himself detested in many public-houses by boasting of his\r\nson “the professor.” Hill was a vigorous youngster, with a serene\r\ncontempt for the clergy of all denominations, and a fine ambition to\r\nreconstruct the world. He regarded his scholarship as a brilliant\r\nopportunity. He had begun to read at seven, and had read steadily\r\nwhatever came in his way, good or bad, since then. His worldly\r\nexperience had been limited to the Island of Portsea, and acquired\r\nchiefly in the wholesale boot factory in which he had worked by day,\r\nafter passing the seventh standard of the Board School. He had a\r\nconsiderable gift of speech, as the College Debating Society, which met\r\namidst the crushing machines and mine models in the Metallurgical\r\nTheatre downstairs, already recognised, recognised by a violent\r\nbattering of desks whenever he rose. And he was just at that fine\r\nemotional age when life opens at the end of a narrow pass, like a broad\r\nvalley at one’s feet, full of the promise of wonderful discoveries and\r\ntremendous achievements. And his own limitations, save that he knew that\r\nhe knew neither Latin or French, were all unknown to him.\r\n\r\nAt first his interest had been divided pretty equally between his\r\nbiological work at the College and social and theological theorising, an\r\nemployment which he took in deadly earnest. Of a night, when the big\r\nmuseum library was not open, he would sit on the bed of his room in\r\nChelsea with his coat and a muffler on, and write out the lecture notes\r\nand revise his dissection memoranda until Thorpe called him out by a\r\nwhistle,—the landlady objected to open the door to attic visitors,—and\r\nthen the two would go prowling about the shadowy, shiny, gas-lit\r\nstreets, talking, very much in the fashion of the sample just given, of\r\nthe God Idea and Righteousness and Carlyle and the Reorganisation of\r\nSociety. And in the midst of it all, Hill, arguing not only for Thorpe\r\nbut for the casual passer-by, would lose the thread of his argument,\r\nglancing at some pretty, painted face that looked meaningly at him as he\r\npassed. Science and Righteousness! But once or twice lately there had\r\nbeen signs that a third interest was creeping into his life, and he had\r\nfound his attention wandering from the fate of the mesoblastic somites\r\nor the probable meaning of the blastopore, to the thought of the girl\r\nwith the brown eyes who sat at the table before him.\r\n\r\nShe was a paying student; she descended inconceivable social altitudes\r\nto speak to him. At the thought of the education she must have had and\r\nthe accomplishments she must possess, the soul of Hill became abject\r\nwithin him. She had spoken to him first over a difficulty about the\r\nalisphenoid of a rabbit’s skull, and he had found that, in biology at\r\nleast, he had no reason for self-abasement. And from that, after the\r\nmanner of young people starting from any starting-point, they got to\r\ngeneralities, and while Hill attacked her upon the question of\r\nsocialism,—some instinct told him to spare her a direct assault upon her\r\nreligion,—she was gathering resolution to undertake what she told\r\nherself was his æsthetic education. She was a year or two older than he,\r\nthough the thought never occurred to him. The loan of “News from\r\nNowhere” was the beginning of a series of cross loans. Upon some absurd\r\nfirst principle of his, Hill had never “wasted time” upon poetry, and it\r\nseemed an appalling deficiency to her. One day in the lunch hour, when\r\nshe chanced upon him alone in the little museum where the skeletons were\r\narranged, shamefully eating the bun that constituted his midday meal,\r\nshe retreated and returned, to lend him, with a slightly furtive air, a\r\nvolume of Browning. He stood sideways towards her and took the book\r\nrather clumsily, because he was holding the bun in the other hand. And\r\nin the retrospect his voice lacked the cheerful clearness he could have\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nThat occurred after the examination in comparative anatomy, on the day\r\nbefore the College turned out its students and was carefully locked up\r\nby the officials, for the Christmas holidays. The excitement of cramming\r\nfor the first trial of strength had for a little while dominated Hill to\r\nthe exclusion of his other interests. In the forecasts of the result in\r\nwhich every one indulged, he was surprised to find that no one regarded\r\nhim as a possible competitor for the Harvey Commemoration Medal, of\r\nwhich this and the two subsequent examinations disposed. It was about\r\nthis time that Wedderburn, who so far had lived inconspicuously on the\r\nuttermost margin of Hill’s perceptions, began to take on the appearance\r\nof an obstacle. By a mutual agreement the nocturnal prowlings with\r\nThorpe ceased for the three weeks before the examination, and his\r\nlandlady pointed out that she really could not supply so much lamp-oil\r\nat the price. He walked to and fro from the College with little slips of\r\nmnemonics in his hand, lists of crayfish appendages, rabbits’\r\nskull-bones, and vertebrate nerves, for example, and became a positive\r\nnuisance to foot-passengers in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nBut by a natural reaction Poetry and the girl with the brown eyes ruled\r\nthe Christmas holiday. The pending results of the examination became\r\nsuch a secondary consideration that Hill marvelled at his father’s\r\nexcitement. Even had he wished it, there was no comparative anatomy to\r\nread in Landport, and he was too poor to buy books, but the stock of\r\npoets in the library was extensive and Hill’s attack was magnificently\r\nsustained. He saturated himself with the fluent numbers of Longfellow\r\nand Tennyson, and fortified himself with Shakespeare, found a kindred\r\nsoul in Pope and a master in Shelley, and heard and fled the siren\r\nvoices of Eliza Cook and Mrs. Hemans. But he read no more Browning,\r\nbecause he hoped for the loan of other volumes from Miss Haysman when he\r\nreturned to London.\r\n\r\nHe walked from his lodgings to the College with that volume of Browning\r\nin his shiny black bag, and his mind teeming with the finest general\r\npropositions about poetry. Indeed he framed first this little speech and\r\nthen that with which to grace the return. The morning was an\r\nexceptionally pleasant one for London, there was a clear, hard frost and\r\nundeniable blue in the sky, a thin haze softened every outline, and warm\r\nshafts of sunlight struck between the houseblocks and turned the sunny\r\nside of the street to amber and gold. In the hall of the College he\r\npulled off his glove and signed his name with fingers so stiff with cold\r\nthat the characteristic dash under the signature he cultivated became a\r\nquivering line. He imagined Miss Haysman about him everywhere. He turned\r\nat the staircase, and there, below, he saw a crowd struggling at the\r\nfoot of the notice board. This, possibly, was the biology list. He\r\nforgot Browning and Miss Haysman for the moment, and joined the\r\nscrimmage. And at last with his cheek flattened against the sleeve of\r\nthe man on the step above him, he read the list:\r\n\r\n                              “_Class I._\r\n\r\n                        H. J. SOMERS WEDDERBURN.\r\n                        WILLIAM HILL.”\r\n\r\nAnd thereafter followed a second class that is outside our present\r\nsympathies. It was characteristic that he did not trouble to look for\r\nThorpe on the Physics list, but backed out of the struggle at once, and\r\nin a curious emotional state between pride over common second-class\r\nhumanity and acute disappointment at Wedderburn’s success, went on his\r\nway upstairs. At the top, as he was hanging up his coat in the passage,\r\nthe zoölogical demonstrator, a young man from Oxford, who secretly\r\nregarded him as a blatant “mugger” of the very worst type, offered his\r\nheartiest congratulations.\r\n\r\nAt the laboratory door Hill stopped for a second to get his breath, and\r\nthen entered. He looked straight up the laboratory and saw all five girl\r\nstudents grouped in their places, and Wedderburn, the once retiring\r\nWedderburn, leaning rather gracefully against the window, playing with\r\nthe blind tassel and talking, apparently, to the five of them. Now Hill\r\ncould talk bravely enough and even overbearingly to one girl, and he\r\ncould have made a speech to a roomful of girls, but this business of\r\nstanding at ease and appreciating, fencing, and returning quick remarks\r\nround a group, was, he knew, altogether beyond him. Coming up the\r\nstaircase his feelings for Wedderburn had been generous, a certain\r\nadmiration perhaps, a willingness to shake his hand conspicuously and\r\nheartily as one who had fought but the first round. But before Christmas\r\nWedderburn had never gone up to that end of the room to talk. In a flash\r\nHill’s mist of vague excitement condensed abruptly to a vivid dislike of\r\nWedderburn. Possibly his expression changed. As he came up to his place\r\nWedderburn nodded carelessly to him, and the others glanced round. Miss\r\nHaysman looked at him and away again, the faintest touch of her eyes. “I\r\ncan’t agree with you, Mr. Wedderburn,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I must congratulate you on your first class, Mr. Hill,” said the\r\nspectacled girl in green, turning round and beaming at him.\r\n\r\n“It’s nothing,” said Hill, staring at Wedderburn and Miss Haysman\r\ntalking together, and eager to hear what they talked about.\r\n\r\n“We poor folks in the second class don’t think so,” said the girl in\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nWhat was it Wedderburn was saying? Something about William Morris! Hill\r\ndid not answer the girl in spectacles, and the smile died out of his\r\nface. He could not hear and failed to see how he could “cut in.”\r\nConfound Wedderburn! He sat down, opened his bag, hesitated whether to\r\nreturn the volume of Browning forthwith, in the sight of all, and\r\ninstead drew out his new note-books for the short course in elementary\r\nbotany that was now beginning, and which would terminate in February. As\r\nhe did so a fat heavy man with a white face and pale grey eyes, Bindon,\r\nthe professor of Botany who came up from Kew for January and February,\r\ncame in by the lecture-theatre door and passed, rubbing his hands\r\ntogether and smiling in silent affability, down the laboratory.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent six weeks Hill experienced some very rapid and\r\ncuriously complex emotional developments. For the most part he had\r\nWedderburn in focus—a fact that Miss Haysman never suspected. She told\r\nHill (for in the comparative privacy of the museum she talked a good\r\ndeal to him of socialism and Browning and general propositions) that she\r\nhad met Wedderburn at the house of some people she knew, and “He’s\r\ninherited his cleverness; for his father, you know, is the great\r\neye-specialist.”\r\n\r\n“_My_ father is a cobbler,” said Hill, quite irrelevantly, and perceived\r\nthe want of dignity even as he said it. But the gleam of jealousy did\r\nnot offend her. She conceived herself the fundamental source of it. He\r\nsuffered bitterly from a sense of Wedderburn’s unfairness and a\r\nrealisation of his own handicap. Here was this Wedderburn had picked up\r\na prominent man for a father, and instead of his losing so many marks on\r\nthe score of that advantage, it was counted to him for righteousness!\r\nAnd while Hill had to introduce himself and talk to Miss Haysman\r\nclumsily over mangled guinea-pigs in the laboratory, this Wedderburn, in\r\nsome backstairs way, had access to her social altitudes, and could\r\nconverse in a polished argot that Hill understood perhaps, but felt\r\nincapable of speaking. Not of course that he wanted to. Then it seemed\r\nto Hill that for Wedderburn to come there day after day with cuffs\r\nunfrayed, neatly tailored, precisely barbered, quietly perfect, was in\r\nitself an ill-bred, sneering sort of proceeding. Moreover, it was a\r\nstealthy thing for Wedderburn to behave insignificantly for a space, to\r\nmock modesty, to lead Hill to fancy that he himself was beyond dispute\r\nthe man of the year, and then suddenly to dart in front of him, and\r\nincontinently to swell up in this fashion. In addition to these things\r\nWedderburn displayed an increasing disposition to join in any\r\nconversational grouping that included Miss Haysman, and would venture,\r\nand indeed seek occasion to pass opinions derogatory to Socialism and\r\nAtheism. He goaded Hill to incivilities by neat, shallow, and\r\nexceedingly effective personalities about the socialist leaders, until\r\nHill hated Bernard Shaw’s graceful egotisms, William Morris’s limited\r\neditions and luxurious wall-papers, and Walter Crane’s charmingly absurd\r\nideal working-men, about as much as he hated Wedderburn. The\r\ndissertations in the laboratory that had been his glory in the previous\r\nterm, became a danger, degenerated into inglorious tussles with\r\nWedderburn, and Hill kept to them only out of an obscure perception that\r\nhis honour was involved. In the Debating Society Hill knew quite clearly\r\nthat, to a thunderous accompaniment of banged desks, he could have\r\npulverised Wedderburn. Only Wedderburn never attended the Debating\r\nSociety to be pulverised, because—nauseous affectation!—he “dined late.”\r\n\r\nYou must not imagine that these things presented themselves in quite\r\nsuch a crude form to Hill’s perception. Hill was a born generaliser.\r\nWedderburn to him was not so much an individual obstacle as a type, the\r\nsalient angle of a class. The economic theories that, after infinite\r\nferment, had shaped themselves in Hill’s mind, became abruptly concrete\r\nat the contact. The world became full of easy-mannered, graceful,\r\ngracefully dressed, conversationally dexterous, finally shallow\r\nWedderburns, Bishops Wedderburn, Wedderburns, M.P., Professors\r\nWedderburn, Wedderburn landlords, all with finger-bowl shibboleths and\r\nepigrammatic cities of refuge from a sturdy debater. And every one ill\r\nclothed or ill dressed, from the cobbler to the cab runner, was a man\r\nand a brother, a fellow-sufferer, to Hill’s imagination. So that he\r\nbecame, as it were, a champion of the fallen and oppressed, albeit to\r\noutward seeming only a self-assertive, ill-mannered young man, and an\r\nunsuccessful champion at that. Again and again, a skirmish over the\r\nafternoon tea that the girl-students had inaugurated, left Hill with\r\nflushed cheeks and a tattered temper, and the Debating Society noticed a\r\nnew quality of sarcastic bitterness in his speeches.\r\n\r\nYou will understand now how it was necessary, if only in the interests\r\nof humanity, that Hill should demolish Wedderburn in the forthcoming\r\nexamination and outshine him in the eyes of Miss Haysman, and you will\r\nperceive, too, how Miss Haysman fell into some common feminine\r\nmisconceptions. The Hill-Wedderburn quarrel, for in his unostentatious\r\nway Wedderburn reciprocated Hill’s ill-veiled rivalry, became a tribute\r\nto her indefinable charm. She was the Queen of Beauty in a tournament of\r\nscalpels and stumpy pencils. To her confidential friend’s secret\r\nannoyance, it even troubled her conscience, for she was a good girl, and\r\npainfully aware, from Ruskin and contemporary fiction, how entirely\r\nmen’s activities are determined by women’s attitudes. And if Hill never\r\nby any chance mentioned the topic of love to her, she only credited him\r\nwith the finer modesty for that omission.\r\n\r\nSo the time came on for the second examination, and Hill’s increasing\r\npallor confirmed the general rumour that he was working hard. In the\r\nAërated Bread Shop near South Kensington Station you would see him,\r\nbreaking his bun and sipping his milk, with his eyes intent upon a paper\r\nof closely written notes. In his bedroom there were propositions about\r\nbuds and stems round his looking-glass, a diagram to catch his eye, if\r\nsoap should chance to spare it, above his washing-basin. He missed\r\nseveral meetings of the Debating Society, but he found the chance\r\nencounters with Miss Haysman in the spacious ways of the adjacent Art\r\nMuseum, or in the little Museum at the top of the College, or in the\r\nCollege corridors, more frequent and very restful. In particular they\r\nused to meet in a little gallery full of wrought-iron chests and gates,\r\nnear the Art Library, and there Hill used to talk, under the gentle\r\nstimulus of her flattering attention, of Browning and his personal\r\nambitions. A characteristic she found remarkable in him was his freedom\r\nfrom avarice. He contemplated quite calmly the prospect of living all\r\nhis life on an income below a hundred pounds a year. But he was\r\ndetermined to be famous, to make, recognisably in his own proper person,\r\nthe world a better place to live in. He took Bradlaugh and John Burns\r\nfor his leaders and models, poor, even impecunious, Great Men. But Miss\r\nHaysman thought that such lives were deficient on the æsthetic side, by\r\nwhich, though she did not know it, she meant good wall-paper and\r\nupholstery, pretty books, tasteful clothes, concerts, and meals nicely\r\ncooked and respectfully served.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day of the second examination, and the professor of\r\nbotany, a fussy conscientious man, rearranged all the tables in the long\r\nnarrow laboratory to prevent copying, and put his demonstrator on a\r\nchair on a table (where he felt, he said, like a Hindoo god) to see all\r\nthe cheating, and stuck a notice outside the door, “Door Closed,” for no\r\nearthly reason that any human being could discover. And all the morning\r\nfrom ten to one the quill of Wedderburn shrieked defiance at Hill’s, and\r\nthe quills of the others chased their leaders in a tireless pack. So\r\nalso it was in the afternoon. Wedderburn was a little quieter than\r\nusual, and Hill’s face was hot all day, and his overcoat bulged with\r\ntext-books and note-books against the last moment’s revision. And the\r\nnext day, in the morning and in the afternoon, was the practical\r\nexamination, when sections had to be cut and slides identified. In the\r\nmorning Hill was depressed because he knew he had cut a thick section,\r\nand in the afternoon came the Mysterious Slip.\r\n\r\nIt was just the kind of thing that the botanical professor was always\r\ndoing. Like the income tax, it offered a premium to the cheat. It was a\r\npreparation under the microscope, a little glass slip, held in its place\r\non the stage of the instrument by light steel clips, and the inscription\r\nset forth that the slip was not to be moved. Each student was to go in\r\nturn to it, sketch it, write in his book of answers what he considered\r\nit to be, and return to his place. Now to move such a slip is a thing\r\none can do by a chance movement of the finger, and in a fraction of a\r\nsecond. The professor’s reason for decreeing that the slip should not be\r\nmoved depended on the fact that the object he wanted identified was\r\ncharacteristic of a certain tree stem. In the position in which it was\r\nplaced it was a difficult thing to recognise, but once the slip was\r\nmoved so as to bring other parts of the preparation into view, its\r\nnature was obvious enough.\r\n\r\nHill came to this, flushed from a contest with staining reagents, sat\r\ndown on the little stool before the microscope, turned the mirror to get\r\nthe best light, and then out of sheer habit shifted the slip. At once he\r\nremembered the prohibition, and with an almost continuous motion of his\r\nhands, moved it back, and sat paralysed with astonishment at his action.\r\n\r\nThen slowly he turned his head. The professor was out of the room, the\r\ndemonstrator sat aloft on his impromptu rostrum, reading the “Q. Jour.\r\nMi. Sci.,” the rest of the examinees were busy and with their backs to\r\nhim. Should he own up to the accident now? He knew quite clearly what\r\nthe thing was. It was a lenticel, a characteristic preparation from the\r\nelder-tree. His eye roved over his intent fellow-students and Wedderburn\r\nsuddenly glanced over his shoulder at him with a queer expression in his\r\neyes. The mental excitement that had kept Hill at an abnormal pitch of\r\nvigour these two days gave way to a curious nervous tension. His book of\r\nanswers was beside him. He did not write down what the thing was, but\r\nwith one eye at the microscope he began making a hasty sketch of it. His\r\nmind was full of this grotesque puzzle in ethics that had suddenly been\r\nsprung upon him. Should he identify it? Or should he leave this question\r\nunanswered? In that case Wedderburn would probably come out first in the\r\nbotanical list. How could he tell now whether he might not have\r\nidentified the thing without shifting it? It was possible that\r\nWedderburn had failed to recognise it, of course. Suppose Wedderburn,\r\ntoo, had shifted the slide? He looked up at the clock. There were\r\nfifteen minutes in which to make up his mind. He gathered up his book of\r\nanswers and the coloured pencils he used in illustrating his replies,\r\nand walked back to his seat.\r\n\r\nHe read through his manuscript and then sat thinking and gnawing his\r\nknuckle. It would look queer now if he owned up. He _must_ beat\r\nWedderburn. He forgot the examples of those starry gentlemen, John Burns\r\nand Bradlaugh. Besides, he reflected, the glimpse of the rest of the\r\nslip he had had, was after all quite accidental, forced upon him by\r\nchance, a kind of providential revelation rather than an unfair\r\nadvantage. It was not nearly so dishonest to avail himself of that as it\r\nwas of Broome, who believed in the efficacy of prayer, to pray daily for\r\na First-Class. “Five minutes more,” said the demonstrator, folding up\r\nhis paper and becoming observant. Hill watched the clock hands until two\r\nminutes remained, then he opened the book of answers, and with hot ears\r\nand an affectation of ease, gave his drawing of the lenticel its name.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the second pass list appeared, the previous positions of Wedderburn\r\nand Hill were reversed, and the spectacled girl in green who knew the\r\ndemonstrator in private life (where he was practically human) said that\r\nin the result of the two examinations taken together, Hill had the\r\nadvantage of a mark, 167 to 166, out of a possible 200. Every one\r\nadmired Hill in a way, though the suspicion of “mugging” clung to him.\r\nBut Hill was to find congratulations and Miss Haysman’s enhanced opinion\r\nof him, and even the decided decline in the crest of Wedderburn tainted\r\nby an unhappy memory. He felt a remarkable access of energy at first,\r\nand the note of a Democracy marching to Triumph returned to his Debating\r\nSociety speeches; he worked at his comparative anatomy with tremendous\r\nzeal and effect, and he went on with his æsthetic education. But through\r\nit all, a vivid little picture was continually coming before his mind’s\r\neye, of a sneakish person manipulating a slide....\r\n\r\nNo human being had witnessed the act, and he was cocksure that no Higher\r\nPower existed to see it, but for all that it worried him. Memories are\r\nnot dead things, but alive; they dwindle in disuse, but they harden and\r\ndevelop in all sorts of queer ways if they are being continually\r\nfretted. Curiously enough, though at the time he perceived clearly that\r\nthe shifting was accidental, as the days wore on his memory became\r\nconfused about it, until at last he was not sure, although he assured\r\nhimself that he _was_ sure, whether the movement had been absolutely\r\ninvoluntary. Then it is possible that Hill’s dietary was conducive to\r\nmorbid conscientiousness,—a breakfast frequently eaten in a hurry, a\r\nmidday bun, and, at such hours after five as chanced to be convenient,\r\nsuch meat as his means determined, usually in a chophouse in a back\r\nstreet off the Brompton Road. Occasionally he treated himself to\r\nthreepenny and ninepenny classics, and they usually represented a\r\nsuppression of potatoes or chops. It is indisputable that outbreaks of\r\nself-abasement and emotional revival have a distinct relation to periods\r\nof scarcity. But apart from this influence on the feelings, there was in\r\nHill a distinct aversion to falsity, that the blasphemous Landport\r\ncobbler had inculcated by strap and tongue from his earliest years. Of\r\none fact about professed Atheists I am convinced: they may be, they\r\nusually are, fools, void of subtlety, revilers of holy institutions,\r\nbrutal speakers, and mischievous knaves; but they lie with difficulty.\r\nIf it were not so, if they had the faintest grasp of the idea of\r\ncompromise, they would simply be liberal Churchmen. And, moreover, this\r\nmemory poisoned his regard for Miss Haysman. For she now preferred him\r\nto Wedderburn so evidently that he felt sure he cared for her, and began\r\nreciprocating her attentions by timid marks of personal regard,—at one\r\ntime he even bought a bunch of violets, carried it about in his pocket,\r\nand produced it with a stumbling explanation, withered and dead, in the\r\ngallery of old iron. It poisoned, too, the denunciation of capitalist\r\ndishonesty that had been one of his life’s pleasures. And, lastly, it\r\npoisoned his triumph over Wedderburn. Previously he had been\r\nWedderburn’s superior in his own eyes, and had raged simply at a want of\r\nrecognition. Now he began to fret at the darker suspicion of a positive\r\ninferiority. He fancied he found justification for his position in\r\nBrowning; but they vanished on analysis. At last, moved curiously enough\r\nby exactly the same motive forces that had resulted in his dishonesty,\r\nhe went to Professor Bindon and made a clean breast of the whole affair.\r\nAs Hill was a paid student, Professor Bindon did not ask him to sit\r\ndown, and he stood before the Professor’s desk as he made his\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\n“It’s a curious story,” said Professor Bindon, slowly realising how the\r\nthing reflected on himself, and then letting his anger rise. “A most\r\nremarkable story. I can’t understand your doing it, and I can’t\r\nunderstand this avowal. You’re a type of student—Cambridge men would\r\nnever dream—I suppose I ought to have thought—Why _did_ you cheat?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t—cheat,” said Hill.\r\n\r\n“But you have just been telling me you did.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I explained—”\r\n\r\n“Either you cheated or you did not cheat.”\r\n\r\n“I said my motion was involuntary—”\r\n\r\n“I am not a metaphysician, I am a servant of science—of fact. You were\r\ntold not to move the slip. You did move the slip. If that is not\r\ncheating—”\r\n\r\n“If I was a cheat,” said Hill, with the note of hysterics in his voice,\r\n“should I come here and tell you?”\r\n\r\n“Your repentance, of course, does you credit,” said Professor Bindon;\r\n“but it does not alter the original facts.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” said Hill, giving in, in utter self-abasement.\r\n\r\n“Even now you cause an enormous amount of trouble. The examination list\r\nwill have to be revised.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose so, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose so! Of course it must be revised. And I don’t see how I can\r\nconscientiously pass you.”\r\n\r\n“Not pass me!” said Hill. “Fail me!”\r\n\r\n“It’s the rule in all examinations. Or where should we be? What else did\r\nyou expect? You don’t want to shirk the consequences of your own acts?”\r\n\r\n“I thought perhaps,” said Hill. And then, “Fail me! I thought, as I told\r\nyou, you would simply deduct the marks given for that slip—”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” said Bindon. “Besides, it would still leave you above\r\nWedderburn. Deduct only the marks! Preposterous! The Departmental\r\nRegulations distinctly say—”\r\n\r\n“But it’s my own admission, sir.”\r\n\r\n“The Regulations say nothing whatever of the manner in which the matter\r\ncomes to light. They simply provide—”\r\n\r\n“It will ruin me. If I fail this examination, they won’t renew my\r\nscholarship.”\r\n\r\n“You should have thought of that before.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, consider all my circumstances—”\r\n\r\n“I cannot consider anything. Professors in this College are machines.\r\nThe Regulations will not even let us recommend our students for\r\nappointments. I am a machine, and you have worked me. I have to do—”\r\n\r\n“It’s very hard, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly it is.”\r\n\r\n“If I am to be failed this examination I might as well go home at once.”\r\n\r\n“That is as you think proper.” Bindon’s voice softened a little, he\r\nperceived he had been unjust, and, provided he did not contradict\r\nhimself, he was disposed to amelioration. “As a private person,” he\r\nsaid, “I think this confession of yours goes far to mitigate your\r\noffence. But you have set the machinery in motion, you know, and now it\r\nmust take its course. I—I am really sorry you gave way.”\r\n\r\nA wave of emotion prevented Hill from answering. Suddenly very vividly\r\nhe saw the heavily-lined face of the old Landport cobbler, his father.\r\n“Good God!—What a fool I have been!” he said hotly and abruptly.\r\n\r\n“I hope,” said Bindon, “that it will be a lesson to you.”\r\n\r\nBut curiously enough they were not thinking of quite the same\r\nindiscretion.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n“I would like a day to think, sir, and then I will let you know—about\r\ngoing home, I mean,” said Hill, moving towards the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day Hill’s place was vacant. The spectacled girl in green was,\r\nas usual, first with the news. Wedderburn and Miss Haysman were talking\r\nof the Meistersingers, when she came up to them.\r\n\r\n“Have you heard?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Heard what?”\r\n\r\n“There was cheating in the examination.”\r\n\r\n“Cheating!” said Wedderburn, with his face suddenly hot. “How?”\r\n\r\n“That slide—”\r\n\r\n“Moved? Never!”\r\n\r\n“It was. That slide that we weren’t to move—”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Wedderburn. “Why! How could they find out? Who do they\r\nsay—”\r\n\r\n“It was Mr. Hill.”\r\n\r\n“_Hill_!”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hill!”\r\n\r\n“Not—surely not the immaculate Hill?” said Wedderburn, recovering.\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it,” said Miss Haysman. “How do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I _didn’t_,” said the girl in spectacles. “But I know it now for a\r\nfact. Mr. Hill went and confessed to Professor Bindon himself.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” said Wedderburn. “Hill of all people—But I am always inclined\r\nto distrust these philanthropists-on-principle—”\r\n\r\n“Are you quite sure?” said Miss Haysman, with a catch in her breath.\r\n\r\n“Quite. It’s dreadful, isn’t it? But you know, what can you expect? His\r\nfather is a cobbler—”\r\n\r\nThen Miss Haysman astonished the girl in spectacles.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care. I will not believe it,” she said, flushing darkly under\r\nher warm-tinted skin. “I will not believe it until he has told me so\r\nhimself—face to face. I would scarcely believe it then,” and abruptly\r\nshe turned her back on the girl in spectacles, and walked to her own\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n“It’s true, all the same,” said the girl in spectacles, peering and\r\nsmiling at Wedderburn.\r\n\r\nBut Wedderburn did not answer her. She was, indeed, one of those people\r\nwho are destined to make unanswered remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         IN THE AVU OBSERVATORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observatory at Avu, in Borneo, stands on the spur of the mountain.\r\nTo the north rises the old crater, black against the unfathomable blue\r\nof the sky. From the little circular building, with its mushroom dome,\r\nthe slopes plunge steeply downward into the black mysteries of the\r\ntropical forest beneath. The little house in which the observer and his\r\nassistant live is about fifty yards from the observatory, and beyond\r\nthis are the huts of their native attendants.\r\n\r\nThaddy, the chief observer, was down with a slight fever. His assistant,\r\nWoodhouse, paused for a moment in silent contemplation of the tropical\r\nnight before commencing his solitary vigil. The night was very silent.\r\nNow and then voices and laughter came from the native huts, or the cry\r\nof some strange animal was heard from the midst of the mystery of the\r\nforest. Nocturnal insects appeared in ghostly fashion out of the\r\ndarkness, and fluttered round his light. He thought, perhaps, of all the\r\npossibilities of discovery that still lay in the black tangle beneath\r\nhim; for to the naturalist the virgin forests of Borneo are still a\r\nwonderland, full of strange questions and half-suspected discoveries.\r\nWoodhouse carried a small lantern in his hand, and its yellow glow\r\ncontrasted vividly with the infinite series of tints between\r\nlavender-blue and black in which the landscape was painted. His hands\r\nand face were smeared with ointment against the attacks of the\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\nEven in these days of celestial photography, work done in a purely\r\ntemporary erection, and with only the most primitive appliances in\r\naddition to the telescope, still involves a very large amount of cramped\r\nand motionless watching. He sighed as he thought of the physical\r\nfatigues before him, stretched himself, and entered the observatory.\r\n\r\nThe reader is probably familiar with the structure of an ordinary\r\nastronomical observatory. The building is usually cylindrical in shape,\r\nwith a very light hemispherical roof capable of being turned round from\r\nthe interior. The telescope is supported upon a stone pillar in the\r\ncentre, and a clockwork arrangement compensates for the earth’s\r\nrotation, and allows a star once found to be continuously observed.\r\nBesides this, there is a compact tracery of wheels and screws about its\r\npoint of support, by which the astronomer adjusts it. There is, of\r\ncourse, a slit in the movable roof which follows the eye of the\r\ntelescope in its survey of the heavens. The observer sits or lies on a\r\nsloping wooden arrangement, which he can wheel to any part of the\r\nobservatory as the position of the telescope may require. Within it is\r\nadvisable to have things as dark as possible, in order to enhance the\r\nbrilliance of the stars observed.\r\n\r\nThe lantern flared as Woodhouse entered his circular den, and the\r\ngeneral darkness fled into black shadows behind the big machine, from\r\nwhich it presently seemed to creep back over the whole place again as\r\nthe light waned. The slit was a profound transparent blue, in which six\r\nstars shone with tropical brilliance, and their light lay, a pallid\r\ngleam, along the black tube of the instrument. Woodhouse shifted the\r\nroof, and then proceeding to the telescope, turned first one wheel and\r\nthen another, the great cylinder slowly swinging into a new position.\r\nThen he glanced through the finder, the little companion telescope,\r\nmoved the roof a little more, made some further adjustments, and set the\r\nclockwork in motion. He took off his jacket, for the night was very hot,\r\nand pushed into position the uncomfortable seat to which he was\r\ncondemned for the next four hours. Then with a sigh he resigned himself\r\nto his watch upon the mysteries of space.\r\n\r\nThere was no sound now in the observatory, and the lantern waned\r\nsteadily. Outside there was the occasional cry of some animal in alarm\r\nor pain, or calling to its mate, and the intermittent sounds of the\r\nMalay and Dyak servants. Presently one of the men began a queer chanting\r\nsong, in which the others joined at intervals. After this it would seem\r\nthat they turned in for the night, for no further sound came from their\r\ndirection, and the whispering stillness became more and more profound.\r\n\r\nThe clockwork ticked steadily. The shrill hum of a mosquito explored the\r\nplace and grew shriller in indignation at Woodhouse’s ointment. Then the\r\nlantern went out and all the observatory was black.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse shifted his position presently, when the slow movement of the\r\ntelescope had carried it beyond the limits of his comfort.\r\n\r\nHe was watching a little group of stars in the Milky Way, in one of\r\nwhich his chief had seen or fancied a remarkable colour variability. It\r\nwas not a part of the regular work for which the establishment existed,\r\nand for that reason perhaps Woodhouse was deeply interested. He must\r\nhave forgotten things terrestrial. All his attention was concentrated\r\nupon the great blue circle of the telescope field—a circle powdered, so\r\nit seemed, with an innumerable multitude of stars, and all luminous\r\nagainst the blackness of its setting. As he watched he seemed to himself\r\nto become incorporeal, as if he too were floating in the ether of space.\r\nInfinitely remote was the faint red spot he was observing.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the stars were blotted out. A flash of blackness passed, and\r\nthey were visible again.\r\n\r\n“Queer,” said Woodhouse. “Must have been a bird.”\r\n\r\nThe thing happened again, and immediately after the great tube shivered\r\nas though it had been struck. Then the dome of the observatory resounded\r\nwith a series of thundering blows. The stars seemed to sweep aside as\r\nthe telescope swung round and away from the slit in the roof.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” cried Woodhouse. “What’s this?”\r\n\r\nSome huge, vague, black shape, with a flapping something like a wing,\r\nseemed to be struggling in the aperture of the roof. In another moment\r\nthe slit was clear again, and the luminous haze of the Milky Way shone\r\nwarm and bright.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the roof was perfectly black, and only a scraping sound\r\nmarked the whereabouts of the unknown creature.\r\n\r\nWoodhouse had scrambled from the seat to his feet. He was trembling\r\nviolently and in a perspiration with the suddenness of the occurrence.\r\nWas the thing, whatever it was, inside or out? It was big, whatever else\r\nit might be. Something shot across the skylight, and the telescope\r\nswayed. He started violently and put his arm up. It was in the\r\nobservatory, then, with him. It was clinging to the roof, apparently.\r\nWhat the devil was it? Could it see him?\r\n\r\nHe stood for perhaps a minute in a state of stupefaction. The beast,\r\nwhatever it was, clawed at the interior of the dome, and then something\r\nflapped almost into his face, and he saw the momentary gleam of\r\nstarlight on a skin like oiled leather. His water-bottle was knocked off\r\nhis little table with a smash.\r\n\r\nThe sense of some strange bird-creature hovering a few yards from his\r\nface in the darkness was indescribably unpleasant to Woodhouse. As his\r\nthought returned he concluded that it must be some night-bird or large\r\nbat. At any risk he would see what it was, and pulling a match from his\r\npocket, he tried to strike it on the telescope seat. There was a smoking\r\nstreak of phosphorescent light, the match flared for a moment, and he\r\nsaw a vast wing sweeping towards him, a gleam of grey-brown fur, and\r\nthen he was struck in the face and the match knocked out of his hand.\r\nThe blow was aimed at his temple, and a claw tore sideways down to his\r\ncheek. He reeled and fell, and he heard the extinguished lantern smash.\r\nAnother blow followed as he fell. He was partly stunned, he felt his own\r\nwarm blood stream out upon his face. Instinctively he felt his eyes had\r\nbeen struck at, and, turning over on his face to protect them, tried to\r\ncrawl under the protection of the telescope.\r\n\r\nHe was struck again upon the back, and he heard his jacket rip, and then\r\nthe thing hit the roof of the observatory. He edged as far as he could\r\nbetween the wooden seat and the eyepiece of the instrument, and turned\r\nhis body round so that it was chiefly his feet that were exposed. With\r\nthese he could at least kick. He was still in a mystified state. The\r\nstrange beast banged about in the darkness, and presently clung to the\r\ntelescope, making it sway and the gear rattle. Once it flapped near him,\r\nand he kicked out madly and felt a soft body with his feet. He was\r\nhorribly scared now. It must be a big thing to swing the telescope like\r\nthat. He saw for a moment the outline of a head black against the\r\nstarlight, with sharply-pointed upstanding ears and a crest between\r\nthem. It seemed to him to be as big as a mastiff’s. Then he began to\r\nbawl out as loudly as he could for help.\r\n\r\nAt that the thing came down upon him again. As it did so his hand\r\ntouched something beside him on the floor. He kicked out, and the next\r\nmoment his ankle was gripped and held by a row of keen teeth. He yelled\r\nagain, and tried to free his leg by kicking with the other. Then he\r\nrealised he had the broken water-bottle at his hand, and, snatching it,\r\nhe struggled into a sitting posture, and feeling in the darkness towards\r\nhis foot, gripped a velvety ear, like the ear of a big cat. He had\r\nseized the water-bottle by its neck and brought it down with a shivering\r\ncrash upon the head of the strange beast. He repeated the blow, and then\r\nstabbed and jobbed with the jagged end of it, in the darkness, where he\r\njudged the face might be.\r\n\r\nThe small teeth relaxed their hold, and at once Woodhouse pulled his leg\r\nfree and kicked hard. He felt the sickening feel of fur and bone giving\r\nunder his boot. There was a tearing bite at his arm, and he struck over\r\nit at the face, as he judged, and hit damp fur.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then he heard the sound of claws and the dragging of\r\na heavy body away from him over the observatory floor. Then there was\r\nsilence, broken only by his own sobbing breathing, and a sound like\r\nlicking. Everything was black except the parallelogram of the blue\r\nskylight with the luminous dust of stars, against which the end of the\r\ntelescope now appeared in silhouette. He waited, as it seemed, an\r\ninterminable time.\r\n\r\nWas the thing coming on again? He felt in his trouser-pocket for some\r\nmatches, and found one remaining. He tried to strike this, but the floor\r\nwas wet, and it spat and went out. He cursed. He could not see where the\r\ndoor was situated. In his struggle he had quite lost his bearings. The\r\nstrange beast, disturbed by the splutter of the match, began to move\r\nagain. “Time!” called Woodhouse, with a sudden gleam of mirth, but the\r\nthing was not coming at him again. He must have hurt it, he thought,\r\nwith the broken bottle. He felt a dull pain in his ankle. Probably he\r\nwas bleeding there. He wondered if it would support him if he tried to\r\nstand up. The night outside was very still. There was no sound of any\r\none moving. The sleepy fools had not heard those wings battering upon\r\nthe dome, nor his shouts. It was no good wasting strength in shouting.\r\nThe monster flapped its wings and startled him into a defensive\r\nattitude. He hit his elbow against the seat, and it fell over with a\r\ncrash. He cursed this, and then he cursed the darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the oblong patch of starlight seemed to sway to and fro. Was he\r\ngoing to faint? It would never do to faint. He clenched his fists and\r\nset his teeth to hold himself together. Where had the door got to? It\r\noccurred to him he could get his bearings by the stars visible through\r\nthe skylight. The patch of stars he saw was in Sagittarius and\r\nsouth-eastward; the door was north—or was it north by west? He tried to\r\nthink. If he could get the door open he might retreat. It might be the\r\nthing was wounded. The suspense was beastly. “Look here!” he said, “if\r\nyou don’t come on, I shall come at you.”\r\n\r\nThen the thing began clambering up the side of the observatory, and he\r\nsaw its black outline gradually blot out the skylight. Was it in\r\nretreat? He forgot about the door, and watched as the dome shifted and\r\ncreaked. Somehow he did not feel very frightened or excited now. He felt\r\na curious sinking sensation inside him. The sharply-defined patch of\r\nlight, with the black form moving across it, seemed to be growing\r\nsmaller and smaller. That was curious. He began to feel very thirsty,\r\nand yet he did not feel inclined to get anything to drink. He seemed to\r\nbe sliding down a long funnel.\r\n\r\nHe felt a burning sensation in his throat, and then he perceived it was\r\nbroad daylight, and that one of the Dyak servants was looking at him\r\nwith a curious expression. Then there was the top of Thaddy’s face\r\nupside down. Funny fellow Thaddy, to go about like that! Then he grasped\r\nthe situation better, and perceived that his head was on Thaddy’s knee,\r\nand Thaddy was giving him brandy. And then he saw the eyepiece of the\r\ntelescope with a lot of red smears on it. He began to remember.\r\n\r\n“You’ve made this observatory in a pretty mess,” said Thaddy.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak boy was beating up an egg in brandy. Woodhouse took this and\r\nsat up. He felt a sharp twinge of pain. His ankle was tied up, so were\r\nhis arm and the side of his face. The smashed glass, red-stained, lay\r\nabout the floor, the telescope seat was overturned, and by the opposite\r\nwall was a dark pool. The door was open, and he saw the grey summit of\r\nthe mountain against a brilliant background of blue sky.\r\n\r\n“Pah!” said Woodhouse. “Who’s been killing calves here? Take me out of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThen he remembered the Thing, and the fight he had had with it.\r\n\r\n“What _was_ it?” he said to Thaddy—“the Thing I fought with?”\r\n\r\n“_You_ know that best,” said Thaddy. “But, anyhow, don’t worry yourself\r\nnow about it. Have some more to drink.”\r\n\r\nThaddy, however, was curious enough, and it was a hard struggle between\r\nduty and inclination to keep Woodhouse quiet until he was decently put\r\naway in bed, and had slept upon the copious dose of meat-extract Thaddy\r\nconsidered advisable. They then talked it over together.\r\n\r\n“It was,” said Woodhouse, “more like a big bat than anything else in the\r\nworld. It had sharp, short ears, and soft fur, and its wings were\r\nleathery. Its teeth were little, but devilish sharp, and its jaw could\r\nnot have been very strong or else it would have bitten through my\r\nankle.”\r\n\r\n“It has pretty nearly,” said Thaddy.\r\n\r\n“It seemed to me to hit out with its claws pretty freely. That is about\r\nas much as I know about the beast. Our conversation was intimate, so to\r\nspeak, and yet not confidential.”\r\n\r\n“The Dyak chaps talk about a Big Colugo, a Klang-utang—whatever that may\r\nbe. It does not often attack man, but I suppose you made it nervous.\r\nThey say there is a Big Colugo and a Little Colugo, and a something else\r\nthat sounds like gobble. They all fly about at night. For my own part I\r\nknow there are flying foxes and flying lemurs about here; but they are\r\nnone of them very big beasts.”\r\n\r\n“There are more things in heaven and earth,” said Woodhouse,—and Thaddy\r\ngroaned at the quotation,—“and more particularly in the forests of\r\nBorneo, than are dreamt of in our philosophies. On the whole, if the\r\nBorneo fauna is going to disgorge any more of its novelties upon me, I\r\nshould prefer that it did so when I was not occupied in the observatory\r\nat night and alone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE TRIUMPHS OF A TAXIDERMIST\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are some of the secrets of taxidermy. They were told me by the\r\ntaxidermist in a mood of elation. He told me them in the time between\r\nthe first glass of whiskey and the fourth, when a man is no longer\r\ncautious and yet not drunk. We sat in his den together; his library it\r\nwas, his sitting and his eating room—separated by a bead curtain, so far\r\nas the sense of sight went, from the noisome den where he plied his\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nHe sat on a deck chair, and when he was not tapping refractory bits of\r\ncoal with them, he kept his feet—on which he wore, after the manner of\r\nsandals, the holey relics of a pair of carpet slippers—out of the way\r\nupon the mantel-piece, among the glass eyes. And his trousers,\r\nby-the-by—though they have nothing to do with his triumphs—were a most\r\nhorrible yellow plaid, such as they made when our fathers wore\r\nside-whiskers and there were crinolines in the land. Further, his hair\r\nwas black, his face rosy, and his eye a fiery brown; and his coat was\r\nchiefly of grease upon a basis of velveteen. And his pipe had a bowl of\r\nchina showing the Graces, and his spectacles were always askew, the left\r\neye glaring nakedly at you, small and penetrating; the right, seen\r\nthrough a glass darkly, magnified and mild. Thus his discourse ran:\r\n“There never was a man who could stuff like me, Bellows, never. I have\r\nstuffed elephants and I have stuffed moths, and the things have looked\r\nall the livelier and better for it. And I have stuffed human\r\nbeings—chiefly amateur ornithologists. But I stuffed a nigger once.\r\n\r\n“No, there is no law against it. I made him with all his fingers out and\r\nused him as a hat-rack, but that fool Homersby got up a quarrel with him\r\nlate one night and spoilt him. That was before your time. It is hard to\r\nget skins, or I would have another.\r\n\r\n“Unpleasant? I don’t see it. Seems to me taxidermy is a promising third\r\ncourse to burial or cremation. You could keep all your dear ones by you.\r\nBric-à-brac of that sort stuck about the house would be as good as most\r\ncompany, and much less expensive. You might have them fitted up with\r\nclockwork to do things.\r\n\r\n“Of course they would have to be varnished, but they need not shine more\r\nthan lots of people do naturally. Old Manningtree’s bald head—Anyhow,\r\nyou could talk to them without interruption. Even aunts. There is a\r\ngreat future before taxidermy, depend upon it. There is fossils again—”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly became silent.\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t think I ought to tell you that.” He sucked at his pipe\r\nthoughtfully. “Thanks, yes. Not too much water.\r\n\r\n“Of course, what I tell you now will go no further. You know I have made\r\nsome dodos and a great auk? No! Evidently you are an amateur at\r\ntaxidermy. My dear fellow, half the great auks in the world are about as\r\ngenuine as the handkerchief of Saint Veronica, as the Holy Coat of\r\nTreves. We make ’em of grebes’ feathers and the like. And the great\r\nauk’s eggs too!”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we make them out of fine porcelain. I tell you it is worth while.\r\nThey fetch—one fetched £300 only the other day. That one was really\r\ngenuine, I believe, but of course one is never certain. It is very fine\r\nwork, and afterwards you have to get them dusty, for no one who owns one\r\nof these precious eggs has ever the temerity to clean the thing. That’s\r\nthe beauty of the business. Even if they suspect an egg they do not like\r\nto examine it too closely. It’s such brittle capital at the best.\r\n\r\n“You did not know that taxidermy rose to heights like that. My boy, it\r\nhas risen higher. I have rivalled the hands of Nature herself. One of\r\nthe _genuine_ great auks—” his voice fell to a whisper—“one of the\r\n_genuine_ great auks _was made by me_.\r\n\r\n“No. You must study ornithology, and find out which it is yourself. And\r\nwhat is more, I have been approached by a syndicate of dealers to stock\r\none of the unexplored skerries to the north of Iceland with specimens. I\r\nmay—some day. But I have another little thing in hand just now. Ever\r\nheard of the dinornis?\r\n\r\n“It is one of those big birds recently extinct in New Zealand. ‘Moa’ is\r\nits common name, so-called because extinct; there is no moa now. See?\r\nWell, they have got bones of it, and from some of the marshes even\r\nfeathers and dried bits of skin. Now, I am going to—well, there is no\r\nneed to make any bones about it—going to _forge_ a complete stuffed moa.\r\nI know a chap out there who will pretend to make the find in a kind of\r\nantiseptic swamp, and say he stuffed it at once, as it threatened to\r\nfall to pieces. The feathers are peculiar, but I have got a simply\r\nlovely way of dodging up singed bits of ostrich plume. Yes, that is the\r\nnew smell you noticed. They can only discover the fraud with a\r\nmicroscope, and they will hardly care to pull a nice specimen to bits\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\n“In this way, you see, I give my little push in the advancement of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n“But all this is merely imitating Nature. I have done more than that in\r\nmy time. I have—beaten her.”\r\n\r\nHe took his feet down from the mantel-board, and leant over\r\nconfidentially towards me. “I have _created_ birds,” he said in a low\r\nvoice. “_New_ birds. Improvements. Like no birds that was ever seen\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nHe resumed his attitude during an impressive silence.\r\n\r\n“Enrich the universe; _rath_-er. Some of the birds I made were new kinds\r\nof humming-birds, and very beautiful little things, but some of them\r\nwere simply rum. The rummest, I think, was the _Anomalopteryx Jejuna_.\r\n_Jejunus-a-um_—empty—so-called because there was really nothing in it; a\r\nthoroughly empty bird—except for stuffing. Old Javvers has the thing\r\nnow, and I suppose he is almost as proud of it as I am. It is a\r\nmasterpiece, Bellows. It has all the silly clumsiness of your pelican,\r\nall the solemn want of dignity of your parrot, all the gaunt\r\nungainliness of a flamingo, with all the extravagant chromatic conflict\r\nof a mandarin duck. _Such_ a bird. I made it out of the skeletons of a\r\nstork and a toucan and a job lot of feathers. Taxidermy of that kind is\r\njust pure joy, Bellows, to a real artist in the art.\r\n\r\n“How did I come to make it? Simple enough, as all great inventions are.\r\nOne of those young genii who write us Science Notes in the papers got\r\nhold of a German pamphlet about the birds of New Zealand, and translated\r\nsome of it by means of a dictionary and his mother-wit—he must have been\r\none of a very large family with a small mother—and he got mixed between\r\nthe living apteryx and the extinct anomalopteryx; talked about a bird\r\nfive feet high, living in the jungles of the North Island, rare, shy,\r\nspecimens difficult to obtain, and so on. Javvers, who even for a\r\ncollector, is a miraculously ignorant man, read these paragraphs, and\r\nswore he would have the thing at any price. Raided the dealers with\r\ninquiries. It shows what a man can do by persistence—will-power. Here\r\nwas a bird-collector swearing he would have a specimen of a bird that\r\ndid not exist, that never had existed, and which for very shame of its\r\nown profane ungainliness, probably would not exist now if it could help\r\nitself. And he got it. _He got it._\r\n\r\n“Have some more whiskey, Bellows?” said the taxidermist, rousing himself\r\nfrom a transient contemplation of the mysteries of will-power and the\r\ncollecting turn of mind. And, replenished, he proceeded to tell me of\r\nhow he concocted a most attractive mermaid, and how an itinerant\r\npreacher, who could not get an audience because of it, smashed it\r\nbecause it was idolatry, or worse, at Burslem Wakes. But as the\r\nconversation of all the parties to this transaction, creator, would-be\r\npreserver, and destroyer, was uniformly unfit for publication, this\r\ncheerful incident must still remain unprinted.\r\n\r\nThe reader, unacquainted with the dark ways of the collector, may\r\nperhaps be inclined to doubt my taxidermist; but so far as great auks’\r\neggs, and the bogus stuffed birds are concerned, I find that he has the\r\nconfirmation of distinguished ornithological writers. And the note about\r\nthe New Zealand bird certainly appeared in a morning paper of\r\nunblemished reputation, for the taxidermist keeps a copy and has shown\r\nit to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A DEAL IN OSTRICHES\r\n\r\n\r\n“Talking of the prices of birds, I’ve seen an ostrich that cost three\r\nhundred pounds,” said the taxidermist, recalling his youth of travel.\r\n“Three hundred pounds!”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me over his spectacles. “I’ve seen another that was refused\r\nat four.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “it wasn’t any fancy points. They was just plain\r\nostriches. A little off colour, too—owing to dietary. And there wasn’t\r\nany particular restriction of the demand either. You’d have thought five\r\nostriches would have ruled cheap on an East Indiaman. But the point was,\r\none of ’em had swallowed a diamond.\r\n\r\n“The chap it got it off was Sir Mohini Padishah, a tremendous swell, a\r\nPiccadilly swell you might say up to the neck of him, and then an ugly\r\nblack head and a whopping turban, with this diamond in it. The blessed\r\nbird pecked suddenly and had it, and when the chap made a fuss it\r\nrealised it had done wrong, I suppose, and went and mixed itself with\r\nthe others to preserve its _incog_. It all happened in a minute. I was\r\namong the first to arrive, and there was this heathen going over his\r\ngods, and two sailors and the man who had charge of the birds laughing\r\nfit to split. It was a rummy way of losing a jewel, come to think of it.\r\nThe man in charge hadn’t been about just at the moment, so that he\r\ndidn’t know which bird it was. Clean lost, you see. I didn’t feel half\r\nsorry, to tell you the truth. The beggar had been swaggering over his\r\nblessed diamond ever since he came aboard.\r\n\r\n“A thing like that goes from stem to stem of a ship in no time. Every\r\none was talking about it. Padishah went below to hide his feelings. At\r\ndinner—he pigged at a table by himself, him and two other Hindoos—the\r\ncaptain kind of jeered at him about it, and he got very excited. He\r\nturned round and talked into my ear. He would not buy the birds; he\r\nwould have his diamond. He demanded his rights as a British subject. His\r\ndiamond must be found. He was firm upon that. He would appeal to the\r\nHouse of Lords. The man in charge of the birds was one of those\r\nwooden-headed chaps you can’t get a new idea into anyhow. He refused any\r\nproposal to interfere with the birds by way of medicine. His\r\ninstructions were to feed them so-and-so and treat them so-and-so, and\r\nit was as much as his place was worth not to feed them so-and-so, and\r\ntreat them so-and-so. Padishah had wanted a stomach-pump—though you\r\ncan’t do that to a bird, you know. This Padishah was full of bad law,\r\nlike most of these blessed Bengalis, and talked of having a lien on the\r\nbirds, and so forth. But an old boy, who said his son was a London\r\nbarrister, argued that what a bird swallowed became _ipso facto_ part of\r\nthe bird, and that Padishah’s only remedy lay in an action for damages,\r\nand even then it might be possible to show contributory negligence. He\r\nhadn’t any right of way about an ostrich that didn’t belong to him. That\r\nupset Padishah extremely, the more so as most of us expressed an opinion\r\nthat that was the reasonable view. There wasn’t any lawyer aboard to\r\nsettle the matter, so we all talked pretty free. At last, after Aden, it\r\nappears that he came round to the general opinion, and went privately to\r\nthe man in charge and made an offer for all five ostriches.\r\n\r\n“The next morning there was a fine shindy at breakfast. The man hadn’t\r\nany authority to deal with the birds, and nothing on earth would induce\r\nhim to sell; but it seems he told Padishah that a Eurasian named Potter\r\nhad already made him an offer, and on that Padishah denounced Potter\r\nbefore us all. But I think the most of us thought it rather smart of\r\nPotter, and I know that when Potter said that he’d wired at Aden to\r\nLondon to buy the birds, and would have an answer at Suez, I cursed\r\npretty richly at a lost opportunity.\r\n\r\n“At Suez, Padishah gave way to tears—actual wet tears—when Potter became\r\nthe owner of the birds, and offered him two hundred and fifty right off\r\nfor the five, being more than two hundred per cent. on what Potter had\r\ngiven. Potter said he’d be hanged if he parted with a feather of\r\nthem—that he meant to kill them off one by one, and find the diamond;\r\nbut afterwards, thinking it over, he relented a little. He was a\r\ngambling hound, was this Potter, a little queer at cards, and this kind\r\nof prize-packet business must have suited him down to the ground.\r\nAnyhow, he offered, for a lark, to sell the birds separately to separate\r\npeople by auction at a starting price of £80 for a bird. But one of\r\nthem, he said, he meant to keep for luck.\r\n\r\n“You must understand this diamond was a valuable one—a little Jew chap,\r\na diamond merchant, who was with us, had put it at three or four\r\nthousand when Padishah had shown it to him—and this idea of an ostrich\r\ngamble caught on. Now it happened that I’d been having a few talks on\r\ngeneral subjects with the man who looked after these ostriches, and\r\nquite incidentally he’d said one of the birds was ailing, and he fancied\r\nit had indigestion. It had one feather in its tail almost all white, by\r\nwhich I knew it, and so when, next day, the auction started with it, I\r\ncapped Padishah’s eighty-five by ninety. I fancy I was a bit too sure\r\nand eager with my bid, and some of the others spotted the fact that I\r\nwas in the know. And Padishah went for that particular bird like an\r\nirresponsible lunatic. At last the Jew diamond merchant got it for £175,\r\nand Padishah said £180 just after the hammer came down—so Potter\r\ndeclared. At any rate, the Jew merchant secured it, and there and then\r\nhe got a gun and shot it. Potter made a Hades of a fuss because he said\r\nit would injure the sale of the other three, and Padishah, of course,\r\nbehaved like an idiot; but all of us were very much excited. I can tell\r\nyou I was precious glad when that dissection was over, and no diamond\r\nhad turned up—precious glad. I’d gone to one-forty on that particular\r\nbird myself.\r\n\r\n“The little Jew was like most Jews—he didn’t make any great fuss over\r\nbad luck; but Potter declined to go on with the auction until it was\r\nunderstood that the goods could not be delivered until the sale was\r\nover. The little Jew wanted to argue that the case was exceptional, and\r\nas the discussion ran pretty even, the thing was postponed until the\r\nnext morning. We had a lively dinner-table that evening, I can tell you,\r\nbut in the end Potter got his way, since it would stand to reason he\r\nwould be safer if he stuck to all the birds, and that we owed him some\r\nconsideration for his sportsman-like behaviour. And the old gentleman\r\nwhose son was a lawyer said he’d been thinking the thing over and that\r\nit was very doubtful if, when a bird had been opened and the diamond\r\nrecovered, it ought not to be handed back to the proper owner. I\r\nremember I suggested it came under the laws of treasure-trove—which was\r\nreally the truth of the matter. There was a hot argument, and we settled\r\nit was certainly foolish to kill the bird on board the ship. Then the\r\nold gentleman, going at large through his legal talk, tried to make out\r\nthe sale was a lottery and illegal, and appealed to the captain; but\r\nPotter said he sold the birds _as_ ostriches. He didn’t want to sell any\r\ndiamonds, he said, and didn’t offer that as an inducement. The three\r\nbirds he put up, to the best of his knowledge and belief, did _not_\r\ncontain a diamond. It was in the one he kept—so he hoped.\r\n\r\n“Prices ruled high next day all the same. The fact that now there were\r\nfour chances instead of five of course caused a rise. The blessed birds\r\naveraged 227, and, oddly enough, this Padishah didn’t secure one of\r\n’em—not one. He made too much shindy, and when he ought to have been\r\nbidding he was talking about liens, and, besides, Potter was a bit down\r\non him. One fell to a quiet little officer chap, another to the little\r\nJew, and the third was syndicated by the engineers. And then Potter\r\nseemed suddenly sorry for having sold them, and said he’d flung away a\r\nclear thousand pounds, and that very likely he’d draw a blank, and that\r\nhe always had been a fool, but when I went and had a bit of a talk to\r\nhim, with the idea of getting him to hedge on his last chance, I found\r\nhe’d already sold the bird he’d reserved to a political chap that was on\r\nboard, a chap who’d been studying Indian morals and social questions in\r\nhis vacation. That last was the three hundred pounds bird. Well, they\r\nlanded three of the blessed creatures at Brindisi—though the old\r\ngentleman said it was a breach of the Customs regulations—and Potter and\r\nPadishah landed too. The Hindoo seemed half mad as he saw his blessed\r\ndiamond going this way and that, so to speak. He kept on saying he’d get\r\nan injunction—he had injunction on the brain—and giving his name and\r\naddress to the chaps who’d bought the birds, so that they’d know where\r\nto send the diamond. None of them wanted his name and address, and none\r\nof them would give their own. It was a fine row I can tell you—on the\r\nplatform. They all went off by different trains. I came on to\r\nSouthampton, and there I saw the last of the birds, as I came ashore; it\r\nwas the one the engineers bought, and it was standing up near the\r\nbridge, in a kind of crate, and looking as leggy and silly a setting for\r\na valuable diamond as ever you saw—if it _was_ a setting for a valuable\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\n“_How did it end?_ Oh! like that. Well—perhaps. Yes, there’s one more\r\nthing that may throw light on it. A week or so after landing I was down\r\nRegent Street doing a bit of shopping, and who should I see arm in arm\r\nand having a purple time of it but Padishah and Potter. If you come to\r\nthink of it—\r\n\r\n“Yes. _I’ve_ thought that. Only, you see, there’s no doubt the diamond\r\nwas real. And Padishah was an eminent Hindoo. I’ve seen his name in the\r\npapers—often. But whether the bird swallowed the diamond certainly is\r\nanother matter, as you say.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE RAJAH’S TREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween Jehun and Bimabur on the Himalayan slopes, and between the\r\njungles and the higher country where the pines and deodars are gathered\r\ntogether, ruled the petty Rajah, of whose wonderful treasure I am\r\ntelling. Very great was the treasure, people said, for the Rajah had\r\nprospered all his days. He had found Mindapore a village, and, behold!\r\nit was a city. Below his fort of unhewn stone the flat-roofed huts of\r\nmud had multiplied; and now there sprang up houses with upstairs rooms,\r\nand the place which had once boasted no more than one buniah man,\r\nengendered a bazaar in the midst of it, as a fat oyster secretes a\r\npearl. And the Holy Place up the river prospered, and the road up the\r\npasses was made safe. Merchants and fakirs multiplied about the wells,\r\nmen came and went, twice even white men from the plain on missions to\r\nthe people over beyond the deodars, and the streets of the town were\r\never denser with poultry and children, and little dogs dyed yellow, and\r\nwith all the multitudinous rich odours of human increase. As at last, at\r\nthe crown of his prosperity, this legend of his treasures began.\r\n\r\nHe was a portly, yellow-faced man, with a long black beard, now steadily\r\ngrowing grey, thick lips, and shifty eyes. He was pious, very pious in\r\nhis daily routine, and swift and unaccountable in his actions. None\r\ndared withstand him to his face, even in little things. Golam Shah, his\r\nvizier, was but a servant, a carrier of orders; and Samud Singh, his\r\nmaster of horse, but a driller of soldiers. They were tools, he would\r\ntell them outright in his pride of power, staves in his hand that he\r\ncould break at his will. He was childless. And his cousin, the youth\r\nAzim Khan, feared him, and only in the remotest recesses of his heart\r\ndared to wish the Rajah would presently die and make a way for the\r\ncyons.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to say when first the rumour spread that the Rajah of\r\nlittle Mindapore was making a hoard. None knew how it began or where.\r\nPerhaps from merchants of whom he had bought. It began long before the\r\ndays of the safe. It was said that rubies had been bought and hidden\r\naway; and then not only rubies, but ornaments of gold, and then pearls,\r\nand diamonds from Golconda, and all manner of precious stones. Even the\r\nDeputy-Commissioner at Allapore heard of it. At last the story\r\nre-entered the palace at Mindapore itself, and Azim Khan, who was the\r\nRajah’s cousin and his heir, and nominally his commander-in-chief, and\r\nGolam Shah, the chief minister, talked it over one with another in a\r\ntentative way.\r\n\r\n“He has something new,” said Golam Shah, querulously; “he has something\r\nnew, and he is keeping it from me.”\r\n\r\nAzira Khan watched him cunningly. “I have told you what I have heard,”\r\nhe said. “For my own part I know nothing.”\r\n\r\n“He goes to and fro musing and humming to himself,” said Golam,\r\nmeditatively, “as one who thinks of a pleasure.”\r\n\r\n“More rubies, they are saying,” said Azim, dreamily, and repeated, as if\r\nfor his own pleasure, “Rubies.” For Azim was the heir.\r\n\r\n“Especially is it since that Englishman came,” said Golam, “three months\r\nago. A big old man, not wrinkled as an old man should be, but red, and\r\nwith red hair streaking his grey, and with a tight skin and a big body\r\nsticking out before. So. An elephant of a man, a great quivering\r\nmud-bank of a man, who laughed mightily, so that the people stopped and\r\nlistened in the street. He came, he laughed, and as he went away we\r\nheard them laugh together—”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Azim.\r\n\r\n“He was a diamond merchant, perhaps—or a dealer in rubies. Do Englishmen\r\ndeal in such things?”\r\n\r\n“Would I had seen him!” said Azim.\r\n\r\n“He took gold away,” said Golam.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent for a space, and the purring noise of the wheel of the\r\nupper well, and the chatter of voices about it rising and falling, made\r\na pleasant sound in the air. “Since the Englishman went,” said Golam,\r\n“he has been different. He hides something from me—something in his\r\nrobe. Rubies! What else can it be?”\r\n\r\n“He has not buried it?” said Azim.\r\n\r\n“He will. Then he will want to dig it up again and look at it,” said\r\nGolam, for he was a man of experience. “I go softly. Sometimes almost I\r\ncome upon him. Then he starts—”\r\n\r\n“He grows old and nervous,” said Azim, and there was a pause.\r\n\r\n“Before the English came,” said Golam, looking at the rings upon his\r\nfingers, as he recurred to his constant preoccupation; “there were no\r\nRajahs nervous and old.”\r\n\r\nThat, I say, was even before the coming of the safe. It came in a\r\npacking case. Such a case it was as had never been seen before on all\r\nthe slopes of the Himalayan mountains, it was an elephant’s burden even\r\non the plain. It was days drawing nearer and nearer. At Allapore crowds\r\nwent to see it pass upon the railway. Afterwards elephants and then a\r\ngreat multitude of men dragged it up the hills. And this great case\r\nbeing opened in the Hall of Audience revealed within itself a monstrous\r\niron box, like no other box that had ever come to the city. It had been\r\nmade, so the story went, by necromancers in England, expressly to the\r\norder of the Rajah, that he might keep his treasure therein and sleep in\r\npeace. It was so hard that the hardest files powdered upon its corners,\r\nand so strong that cannon fired point-blank at it would have produced no\r\neffect upon it. And it locked with a magic lock. There was a word, and\r\nnone knew the word but the Rajah. With that word, and a little key that\r\nhung about his neck, one could open the lock; but without it none could\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah caused this safe to be built into the wall of his palace in a\r\nlittle room beyond the Hall of Audience. He superintended the building\r\nup of it with jealous eyes. And thereafter he would go thither day by\r\nday, once at least every day, coming back with brighter eyes. “He goes\r\nto count his treasure,” said Golam Shah, standing beside the empty daïs.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days it was that the Rajah began to change. He who had been\r\ncunning and subtle became choleric and outspoken. His judgment grew\r\nharsh, and a taint that seemed to all about him to be assuredly the\r\ntaint of avarice crept into his acts. Moreover, which inclined Golam\r\nShah to hopefulness, he seemed to take a dislike to Azim Khan. Once\r\nindeed he made a kind of speech in the Hall of Audience. Therein he\r\ndeclared many times over in a peculiarly husky voice, husky yet full of\r\nconviction, that Azim Khan was not worth a half anna, not worth a half\r\nanna to any human soul.\r\n\r\nIn these latter days of the Rajah’s decline, moreover, when merchants\r\ncame, he would go aside with them secretly into the little room, and\r\nspeak low, so that those in the Hall of Audience, howsoever they\r\nstrained their ears, could hear nothing of his speech. These things\r\nGolam Shah and Azim Khan and Samud Singh, who had joined their councils,\r\ntreasured in their hearts.\r\n\r\n“It is true about the treasure,” said Azim; “they talked of it round the\r\nwell of the travellers, even the merchants from Tibet had heard the\r\ntale, and had come this way with jewels of price, and afterwards they\r\nwent secretly telling no one.” And ever and again, it was said, came a\r\nnegro mute from the plains, with secret parcels for the Rajah. “Another\r\nstone,” was the rumour that went the round of the city.\r\n\r\n“The bee makes hoards,” said Azim Khan, the Rajah’s heir, sitting in the\r\nupper chamber of Golam Shah. “Therefore, we will wait awhile.” For Azim\r\nwas more coward than traitor.\r\n\r\nAt last there were men in the Deccan even who could tell you particulars\r\nof the rubies and precious stones that the Rajah had gathered together.\r\nBut so circumspect was the Rajah that Azim Khan and Golam Shah had never\r\neven set eyes on the glittering heaps that they knew were accumulating\r\nin the safe.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah always went into the little room alone, and even then he\r\nlocked the door of the little room—it had a couple of locks—before he\r\nwent to the safe and used the magic word. How all the ministers and\r\nofficers and guards listened and looked at one another as the door of\r\nthe room behind the curtain closed!\r\n\r\nThe Rajah changed indeed, in these days, not only in the particulars of\r\nhis rule, but in his appearance. “He is growing old. How fast he grows\r\nold! The time is almost ripe,” whispered Samud Singh. The Rajah’s hand\r\nbecame tremulous, his step was now sometimes unsteady, and his memory\r\ncuriously defective. He would come back out from the treasure-room, and\r\nhis hand would tighten fiercely on the curtain, and he would stumble on\r\nthe steps of the daïs. “His eyesight fails,” said Golam. “See!—His\r\nturban is askew. He is sleepy even in the forenoon, before the heat of\r\nthe day. His judgments are those of a child.”\r\n\r\nIt was a painful sight to see a man so suddenly old and enfeebled still\r\nruling men.\r\n\r\n“He may go on yet, a score of years,” said Golam Shah.\r\n\r\n“Should a ruler hoard riches,” said Shere Ali, in the guardroom, “and\r\nleave his soldiers unpaid?” That was the beginning of the end.\r\n\r\nIt was the thought of the treasure won over the soldiers, even as it did\r\nthe mollahs and the eunuchs. Why had the Rajah not buried it in some\r\nunthinkable place, as his father had done before him, and killed the\r\ndiggers with his hand? “He has hoarded,” said Samud, with a chuckle,—for\r\nthe old Rajah had once pulled his beard,—“only to pay for his own\r\nundoing.” And in order to insure confidence, Golam Shah went beyond the\r\ntruth perhaps, and gave a sketchy account of the treasures to this man\r\nand that, even as a casual eyewitness might do.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly and swiftly, the palace revolution was accomplished. When\r\nthe lonely old Rajah was killed, a shot was to be fired from the harem\r\nlattice, bugles were to be blown, and the sepoys were to turn out in the\r\nsquare before the palace, and fire a volley in the air. The murder was\r\ndone in the dark save for a little red lamp that burnt in the corner.\r\nAzim knelt on the body and held up the wet beard, and cut the throat\r\nwide and deep to make sure. It was so easy! Why had he waited so long?\r\nAnd then, with his hands covered with warm blood, he sprang up\r\neagerly—Rajah at last!—and followed Golam and Samud and the eunuchs down\r\nthe long, faintly moonlit passage, towards the Hall of Audience.\r\n\r\nAs they did so, the crack of a rifle sounded far away, and after a pause\r\ncame the first awakening noises of the town. One of the eunuchs had an\r\niron bar, and Samud carried a pistol in his hand. He fired into the\r\nlocks of the treasure-room, and wrecked them, and the eunuch smashed the\r\ndoor in. Then they all rushed in together, none standing aside for Azim.\r\nIt was dark, and the second eunuch went reluctantly to get a torch, in\r\nfear lest his fellow murderers should open the safe in his absence.\r\n\r\nBut he need have had no fear. The cardinal event of that night is the\r\ntriumphant vindication of the advertised merits of Chobbs’ unrivalled\r\nsafes. The tumult that occurred between the Mindapore sepoys and the\r\npeople need not concern us. The people loved not the new Rajah—let that\r\nsuffice. The conspirators got the key from round the dead Rajah’s neck,\r\nand tried a multitude of the magic words of the English that Samud Singh\r\nknew, even such words as “Kemup” and “Gorblimey”—in vain.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the safe in the treasure-room remained intact and\r\ndefiant, the woodwork about it smashed to splinters, and great chunks of\r\nstone knocked out of the wall, dents abundantly scattered over its\r\nimpregnable door, and a dust of files below. And the shifty Golam had to\r\nexplain the matter to the soldiers and mollahs as best he could. This\r\nwas an extremely difficult thing to do, because in no kind of business\r\nis prompt cash so necessary as in the revolutionary line.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs for the next few days in Mindapore was exceedingly\r\nstrained. One fact stands out prominently, that Azim Khan was hopelessly\r\nfeeble. The soldiers would not at first believe in the exemplary\r\nintegrity of the safe, and a deputation insisted in the most occidental\r\nmanner in verifying the new Rajah’s statements. Moreover, the populace\r\nclamoured, and then by a naked man running, came the alarming\r\nintelligence that the new Deputy-Commissioner at Allapore was coming\r\nheadlong and with soldiers to verify the account of the revolution Golam\r\nShah and Samud Singh had sent him in the name of Azim.\r\n\r\nThe new Deputy-Commissioner was a raw young man, partly obscured by a\r\npith helmet, and chock full of zeal and the desire for distinction; and\r\nhe had heard of the treasure. He was going, he said, to sift the matter\r\nthoroughly. On the arrival of this distressing intelligence there was a\r\nhasty and informal council of state (at which Azim was not present), a\r\ncounter-revolution was arranged, and all that Azim ever learnt of it was\r\nthe sound of a footfall behind him, and the cold touch of a pistol\r\nbarrel on the neck.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commissioner arrived, that dexterous statesman, Golam Shah, and\r\nthat honest soldier, Samud Singh, were ready to receive him, and they\r\nhad two corpses, several witnesses, and a neat little story. In addition\r\nto Azim they had shot an unpopular officer of the Mindapore sepoys. They\r\ntold the Commissioner how Azim had plotted against the Rajah and raised\r\na military revolt, and how the people, who loved the old Rajah, even as\r\nGolam Shah and Samud Singh loved him, had quelled the revolt, and how\r\npeace was restored again. And Golam explained how Azim had fought for\r\nlife even in the Hall of Audience, and how he, Golam, had been wounded\r\nin the struggle, and how Samud had shot Azim with his own hand.\r\n\r\nAnd the Deputy-Commissioner, being weak in his dialect, had swallowed it\r\nall. All round the Deputy-Commissioner, in the minds of the people, the\r\npalace, and the city, hung the true story of the case, as it seemed to\r\nGolam Shah, like an avalanche ready to fall; and yet the\r\nDeputy-Commissioner did not learn of it for four days. And Golam and\r\nSamud went to and fro, whispering and pacifying, promising to get at the\r\ntreasure as soon as the Deputy-Commissioner could be got out of the way.\r\nAnd as they went to and fro so also the report went to and fro—that\r\nGolam and Samud had opened the safe and hidden the treasure, and closed\r\nand locked it again; and bright eyes watched them curiously and hungrily\r\neven as they had watched the Rajah in the days that were gone.\r\n\r\n“This city is no longer an abiding place for you and me,” said Golam\r\nShah, in a moment of clear insight. “They are mad about this treasure.\r\nGolconda would not satisfy them.”\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Commissioner, when he heard their story, did indeed make\r\nknowing inquiries (as knowing as the knowingness of the English goes) in\r\norder to show himself not too credulous; but he elicited nothing. He had\r\nheard tales of treasure, had the Commissioner, and of a great box? So\r\nhad Golam and Samud, but where it was they could not tell. They too had\r\ncertainly heard tales of treasure—many tales indeed. Perhaps there _was_\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\nHad the Deputy-Commissioner had the scientific turn of mind, he would\r\nhave observed that a strong smell of gunpowder still hung about the\r\nAudience Chamber, more than was explained by the narrative told him; and\r\nhad he explored the adjacent apartments, he would presently have\r\ndiscovered the small treasure-room with its smashed locks, and the\r\nceiling now dependent ruins, and amid the ruins the safe, bulging\r\nperilously from the partly collapsed walls, but still unconquered, and\r\nwith its treasures unexplored. Also it is a fact that Golam Shah’s\r\nbandaged hand was not the consequence of heroism in combat, but of\r\ncertain private blasting operations too amateurishly prosecuted.\r\n\r\nSo you have the situation: Deputy-Commissioner installed in the palace,\r\nsending incorrect information to headquarters and awaiting instructions,\r\nthe safe as safe as ever; assistant conspirators grumbling louder and\r\nlouder; and Golam and Samud getting more and more desperate lest this\r\nvoice should reach the Deputy’s ears.\r\n\r\nThen came the night when the Commissioner heard a filing and a tapping,\r\nand being a brave man, rose and went forthwith, alone and very quietly,\r\nacross the Hall of Audience, pistol in hand, in search of the sound.\r\nAcross the Hall a light came from an open door that had been hidden in\r\nthe day by a curtain. Stopping silently in the darkness of the outer\r\napartment, he looked into the treasure-room. And there stood Golam with\r\nhis arm in a sling, holding a lantern, while Samud fumbled with pieces\r\nof wire and some little keys. They were without boots, but otherwise\r\nthey were dressed ready for a journey.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Commissioner was, for a Government official, an exceedingly\r\nquick-witted man. He slipped back in the darkness again, and within five\r\nminutes, Golam and Samud, still fumbling, heard footsteps hurrying\r\nacross the Hall of Audience, and saw a flicker of light. Out went their\r\nlantern, with a groan because of a bandaged arm, but it was too late. In\r\nanother moment Lieutenant Earl, in pyjamas and boots, but with a brace\r\nof revolvers and a couple of rifles behind him, stood in the doorway of\r\nthe treasure-room, and Golam and Samud were caught. Samud clicked his\r\npistol and then threw it down, for it was three to one—Golam being not\r\nonly a bandaged man, but fundamentally a man of peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence of this treachery filtered from the palace into\r\nthe town, there was an outbreak of popular feeling, and a dozen\r\nofficious persons set out to tell the Deputy-Commissioner the true\r\nconnection between Golam, Samud, and the death of the Rajah. The first\r\nto penetrate to the Deputy-Commissioner’s presence was an angry fakir,\r\nfrom the colony that dwelt about the Holy place. And after a patient\r\nhearing the Deputy-Commissioner extracted the thread of the narrative\r\nfrom the fabric of curses in which the holy man presented it.\r\n\r\n“This is most singular,” said the Deputy-Commissioner to the Lieutenant,\r\nstanding in the treasure-room (which looked as though the palace had\r\nbeen bombarded), and regarding the battered but still inviolable safe.\r\n“Here we seem to have the key of the whole position.”\r\n\r\n“Key!” said the Lieutenant. “It’s the key they haven’t got.”\r\n\r\n“Curious mingling of the new and the old,” said the Deputy-Commissioner.\r\n“Patent safe—and a hoard.”\r\n\r\n“Send to Allapore and wire Chobbs, I suppose?” said the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Commissioner signified that was his intention, and they set\r\nguards before and behind and all about the treasure-room, until the\r\nproper instructions about the lock should come.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the _Pax Britannica_ solemnly took possession of the\r\nRajah’s hoard, and men in Simla heard the news, and envied that\r\nDeputy-Commissioner his adventure with all their hearts. For his\r\npromptitude and decision was a matter of praise, and they said that\r\nMindapore would certainly be annexed and added to the district over\r\nwhich he ruled. Only a fat old man named MacTurk, living in Allapore, a\r\nbig man with a noisy quivering laugh, and a secret trade with certain\r\nnative potentates, did not hear the news, excepting only the news of the\r\nmurder of the Rajah and the departure of the Deputy-Commissioner, for\r\nseveral days. He heard nothing of the disposition of the treasure—an\r\nunfortunate thing, since, among other things, he had sold the Rajah his\r\nsafe, and may even have known the word by which the lock was opened.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Commissioner had theatrical tastes. These he gratified under\r\nthe excuse that display was above all things necessary in dealing with\r\nOrientals. He imprisoned his four malefactors theatrically, and when the\r\ninstructions came from Chobbs he had the safe lugged into the Hall of\r\nAudience, in order to open it with more effect. The Commissioner sat on\r\nthe daïs, while the engineer worked at the safe on the crimson steps.\r\n\r\nIn the central space was stretched a large white cloth. It reminded the\r\nDeputy-Commissioner of a picture he had seen of Alexander at Damascus\r\nreceiving the treasures of Darius.\r\n\r\n“It is gold,” said one bystander to another. “There was a sound of\r\nchinking as they brought the safe in. My brother was among those who\r\nhauled.”\r\n\r\nThe engineer clicked the lock. Every eye in the Hall of Audience grew\r\nbrighter and keener, excepting the eyes of the Deputy-Commissioner. He\r\nfelt the dignity of his responsibilities, and sat upon the daïs looking\r\nas much like the _Pax Britannica_ as possible.\r\n\r\n“Holy Smoke!” said the engineer, and slammed the safe again. A murmur of\r\nexclamations ran round the hall. Every one was asking every one else\r\nwhat they had seen.\r\n\r\n“An asp!” said some one.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy-Commissioner lost his imperturbability. “What is it?” he\r\nsaid, springing to his feet. The engineer leant across the safe and\r\nwhispered two words, something indistinct and with a blasphemous\r\nadjective in front.\r\n\r\n“_What?_” said the Deputy-Commissioner, sharply.\r\n\r\n“Glass!” said the engineer, in a bitter whisper. “Broken bottles.\r\n’Undreds!”\r\n\r\n“Let me see!” said the Deputy-Commissioner, losing all his dignity.\r\n\r\n“Scotch, if I’m not mistaken,” said the engineer, sniffing curiously.\r\n\r\n“Curse it!” said the Deputy-Commissioner, and looked up to meet a\r\nmultitude of ironical eyes. “Er—\r\n\r\n“The assembly is dismissed,” said the Deputy-Commissioner.\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a _fool_ he must have looked!” wheezed MacTurk, who did not like\r\nthe Deputy-Commissioner. “What a _fool_ he must have looked!\r\n\r\n“Simple enough,” said MacTurk, “when you know how it came about.”\r\n\r\n“But how did it come about?” asked the station-master.\r\n\r\n“Secret drinking,” said MacTurk. “Bourbon whiskey. I taught him how to\r\ntake it myself. But he didn’t dare let on that he was doing it, poor old\r\nchap! Mindapore’s one of the most fanatically Mahometan states in the\r\nhills you see. And he always was a secretive kind of chap, and given to\r\ndoing things by himself. So he got that safe to hide it in, and keep the\r\nbottles. Broke ’em up to pack, I s’pose, when it got too full. Lord! I\r\nmight ha’ known. When people spoke of his treasure—I never thought of\r\nputting that and the safe and the Bourbon together! But how plain it is!\r\nAnd _what_ a sell for Parkinson. Pounded glass! The accumulation of\r\nyears! Lord!—I’d, ’a’ given a couple of stone off my weight to see him\r\nopen that safe!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE STORY OF DAVIDSON’S EYES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nThe transitory mental aberration of Sidney Davidson, remarkable enough\r\nin itself, is still more remarkable if Wade’s explanation is to be\r\ncredited. It sets one dreaming of the oddest possibilities of\r\nintercommunication in the future, of spending an intercalary five\r\nminutes on the other side of the world, or being watched in our most\r\nsecret operations by unsuspected eyes. It happened that I was the\r\nimmediate witness of Davidson’s seizure, and so it falls naturally to me\r\nto put the story upon paper.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that I was the immediate witness of his seizure, I mean that\r\nI was the first on the scene. The thing happened at the Harlow Technical\r\nCollege just beyond the Highgate Archway. He was alone in the larger\r\nlaboratory when the thing happened. I was in the smaller room, where the\r\nbalances are, writing up some notes. The thunderstorm had completely\r\nupset my work, of course. It was just after one of the louder peals that\r\nI thought I heard some glass smash in the other room. I stopped writing,\r\nand turned round to listen. For a moment I heard nothing; the hail was\r\nplaying the devil’s tattoo on the corrugated zinc of the roof. Then came\r\nanother sound, a smash—no doubt of it this time. Something heavy had\r\nbeen knocked off the bench. I jumped up at once and went and opened the\r\ndoor leading into the big laboratory.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to hear a queer sort of laugh, and saw Davidson standing\r\nunsteadily in the middle of the room, with a dazzled look on his face.\r\nMy first impression was that he was drunk. He did not notice me. He was\r\nclawing out at something invisible a yard in front of his face. He put\r\nout his hand, slowly, rather hesitatingly, and then clutched nothing.\r\n“What’s come to it?” he said. He held up his hands to his face, fingers\r\nspread out. “Great Scott!” he said. The thing happened three or four\r\nyears ago, when every one swore by that personage. Then he began raising\r\nhis feet clumsily, as though he had expected to find them glued to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“Davidson!” cried I. “What’s the matter with you?” He turned round in my\r\ndirection and looked about for me. He looked over me and at me and on\r\neither side of me, without the slightest sign of seeing me. “Waves,” he\r\nsaid; “and a remarkably neat schooner. I’d swear that was Bellows’s\r\nvoice. _Hullo!_” He shouted suddenly at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\nI thought he was up to some foolery. Then I saw littered about his feet\r\nthe shattered remains of the best of our electrometers. “What’s up,\r\nman?” said I. “You’ve smashed the electrometer!”\r\n\r\n“Bellows again!” said he. “Friends left, if my hands are gone. Something\r\nabout electrometers. Which way _are_ you, Bellows?” He suddenly came\r\nstaggering towards me. “The damned stuff cuts like butter,” he said. He\r\nwalked straight into the bench and recoiled. “None so buttery, that!” he\r\nsaid, and stood swaying.\r\n\r\nI felt scared. “Davidson,” said I, “what on earth’s come over you?”\r\n\r\nHe looked round him in every direction. “I could swear that was Bellows.\r\nWhy don’t you show yourself like a man, Bellows?”\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that he must be suddenly struck blind. I walked round\r\nthe table and laid my hand upon his arm. I never saw a man more startled\r\nin my life. He jumped away from me, and came round into an attitude of\r\nself-defence, his face fairly distorted with terror. “Good God!” he\r\ncried. “What was that?”\r\n\r\n“It’s I—Bellows. Confound it, Davidson!”\r\n\r\nHe jumped when I answered him and stared—how can I express it?—right\r\nthrough me. He began talking, not to me, but to himself. “Here in broad\r\ndaylight on a clear beach. Not a place to hide in.” He looked about him\r\nwildly. “Here! I’m _off_.” He suddenly turned and ran headlong into the\r\nbig electro-magnet—so violently that, as we found afterwards, he bruised\r\nhis shoulder and jawbone cruelly. At that he stepped back a pace, and\r\ncried out with almost a whimper, “What, in Heaven’s name, has come over\r\nme?” He stood, blanched with terror and trembling violently, with his\r\nright arm clutching his left, where that had collided with the magnet.\r\n\r\nBy that time I was excited, and fairly excited. “Davidson,” said I,\r\n“don’t be afraid.”\r\n\r\nHe was startled at my voice, but not so excessively as before. I\r\nrepeated my words in as clear and firm a tone as I could assume.\r\n“Bellows,” he said, “is that you?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you see it’s me?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed. “I can’t even see it’s myself. Where the devil are we?”\r\n\r\n“Here,” said I, “in the laboratory.”\r\n\r\n“The laboratory!” he answered, in a puzzled tone, and put his hand to\r\nhis forehead. “I _was_ in the laboratory—till that flash came, but I’m\r\nhanged if I’m there now. What ship is that?”\r\n\r\n“There’s no ship,” said I. “Do be sensible, old chap.”\r\n\r\n“No ship!” he repeated, and seemed to forget my denial forthwith. “I\r\nsuppose,” said he, slowly, “we’re both dead. But the rummy part is I\r\nfeel just as though I still had a body. Don’t get used to it all at\r\nonce, I suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly\r\nquick thing, Bellows—eigh?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk nonsense. You’re very much alive. You are in the laboratory,\r\nblundering about. You’ve just smashed a new electrometer. I don’t envy\r\nyou when Boyce arrives.”\r\n\r\nHe stared away from me towards the diagrams of cryohydrates. “I must be\r\ndeaf,” said he. “They’ve fired a gun, for there goes the puff of smoke,\r\nand I never heard a sound.”\r\n\r\nI put my hand on his arm again, and this time he was less alarmed. “We\r\nseem to have a sort of invisible bodies,” said he. “By Jove! there’s a\r\nboat coming round the headland! It’s very much like the old life after\r\nall—in a different climate.”\r\n\r\nI shook his arm. “Davidson,” I cried, “wake up!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nIt was just then that Boyce came in. So soon as he spoke Davidson\r\nexclaimed: “Old Boyce! Dead too! What a lark!” I hastened to explain\r\nthat Davidson was in a kind of somnambulistic trance. Boyce was\r\ninterested at once. We both did all we could to rouse the fellow out of\r\nhis extraordinary state. He answered our questions, and asked us some of\r\nhis own, but his attention seemed distracted by his hallucination about\r\na beach and a ship. He kept interpolating observations concerning some\r\nboat and the davits and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel\r\nqueer, in the dusky laboratory, to hear him saying such things.\r\n\r\nHe was blind and helpless. We had to walk him down the passage, one at\r\neach elbow, to Boyce’s private room, and while Boyce talked to him\r\nthere, and humoured him about this ship idea, I went along the corridor\r\nand asked old Wade to come and look at him. The voice of our Dean\r\nsobered him a little, but not very much. He asked where his hands were,\r\nand why he had to walk about up to his waist in the ground. Wade thought\r\nover him a long time—you know how he knits his brows—and then made him\r\nfeel the couch, guiding his hands to it. “That’s a couch,” said Wade.\r\n“The couch in the private room of Professor Boyce. Horsehair stuffing.”\r\n\r\nDavidson felt about, and puzzled over it, and answered presently that he\r\ncould feel it all right, but he couldn’t see it.\r\n\r\n“What _do_ you see?” asked Wade. Davidson said he could see nothing but\r\na lot of sand and broken-up shells. Wade gave him some other things to\r\nfeel, telling him what they were, and watching him keenly.\r\n\r\n“The ship is almost hull down,” said Davidson, presently, _apropos_ of\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“Never mind the ship,” said Wade. “Listen to me, Davidson. Do you know\r\nwhat hallucination means?”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said Davidson.\r\n\r\n“Well, everything you see is hallucinatory.”\r\n\r\n“Bishop Berkeley,” said Davidson.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mistake me,” said Wade. “You are alive, and in this room of\r\nBoyce’s. But something has happened to your eyes. You cannot see; you\r\ncan feel and hear, but not see. Do you follow me?”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me that I see too much.” Davidson rubbed his knuckles into\r\nhis eyes. “Well?” he said.\r\n\r\n“That’s all. Don’t let it perplex you. Bellows, here, and I will take\r\nyou home in a cab.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a bit.” Davidson thought. “Help me to sit down,” said he,\r\npresently; “and now—I’m sorry to trouble you—but will you tell me all\r\nthat over again?”\r\n\r\nWade repeated it very patiently. Davidson shut his eyes, and pressed his\r\nhands upon his forehead. “Yes,” said he. “It’s quite right. Now my eyes\r\nare shut I know you’re right. That’s you, Bellows, sitting by me on the\r\ncouch. I’m in England again. And we’re in the dark.”\r\n\r\nThen he opened his eyes. “And there,” said he, “is the sun just rising,\r\nand the yards of the ship, and a tumbled sea, and a couple of birds\r\nflying. I never saw anything so real. And I’m sitting up to my neck in a\r\nbank of sand.”\r\n\r\nHe bent forward and covered his face with his hands. Then he opened his\r\neyes again. “Dark sea and sunrise! And yet I’m sitting on a sofa in old\r\nBoyce’s room!—God help me!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning. For three weeks this strange affection of\r\nDavidson’s eyes continued unabated. It was far worse than being blind.\r\nHe was absolutely helpless, and had to be fed like a newly-hatched bird,\r\nand led about and undressed. If he attempted to move he fell over things\r\nor struck himself against walls or doors. After a day or so he got used\r\nto hearing our voices without seeing us, and willingly admitted he was\r\nat home, and that Wade was right in what he told him. My sister, to whom\r\nhe was engaged, insisted on coming to see him, and would sit for hours\r\nevery day while he talked about this beach of his. Holding her hand\r\nseemed to comfort him immensely. He explained that when we left the\r\nCollege and drove home,—he lived in Hampstead Village,—it appeared to\r\nhim as if we drove right through a sandhill—it was perfectly black until\r\nhe emerged again—and through rocks and trees and solid obstacles, and\r\nwhen he was taken to his own room it made him giddy and almost frantic\r\nwith the fear of falling, because going upstairs seemed to lift him\r\nthirty or forty feet above the rocks of his imaginary island. He kept\r\nsaying he should smash all the eggs. The end was that he had to be taken\r\ndown into his father’s consulting room and laid upon a couch that stood\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe described the island as being a bleak kind of place on the whole,\r\nwith very little vegetation, except some peaty stuff, and a lot of bare\r\nrock. There were multitudes of penguins, and they made the rocks white\r\nand disagreeable to see. The sea was often rough, and once there was a\r\nthunderstorm, and he lay and shouted at the silent flashes. Once or\r\ntwice seals pulled up on the beach, but only on the first two or three\r\ndays. He said it was very funny the way in which the penguins used to\r\nwaddle right through him, and how he seemed to lie among them without\r\ndisturbing them.\r\n\r\nI remember one odd thing, and that was when he wanted very badly to\r\nsmoke. We put a pipe in his hands—he almost poked his eye out with\r\nit—and lit it. But he couldn’t taste anything. I’ve since found it’s the\r\nsame with me—I don’t know if it’s the usual case—that I cannot enjoy\r\ntobacco at all unless I can see the smoke.\r\n\r\nBut the queerest part of his vision came when Wade sent him out in a\r\nbath-chair to get fresh air. The Davidsons hired a chair, and got that\r\ndeaf and obstinate dependent of theirs, Widgery, to attend to it.\r\nWidgery’s ideas of healthy expeditions were peculiar. My sister, who had\r\nbeen to the Dog’s Home, met them in Camden Town, towards King’s Cross.\r\nWidgery trotting along complacently, and Davidson evidently most\r\ndistressed, trying in his feeble, blind way to attract Widgery’s\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe positively wept when my sister spoke to him. “Oh, get me out of this\r\nhorrible darkness!” he said, feeling for her hand. “I must get out of\r\nit, or I shall die.” He was quite incapable of explaining what was the\r\nmatter, but my sister decided he must go home, and presently, as they\r\nwent up the hill towards Hampstead, the horror seemed to drop from him.\r\nHe said it was good to see the stars again, though it was then about\r\nnoon and a blazing day.\r\n\r\n“It seemed,” he told me afterwards, “as if I was being carried\r\nirresistibly towards the water. I was not very much alarmed at first. Of\r\ncourse it was night there—a lovely night.”\r\n\r\n“Of course?” I asked, for that struck me as odd.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said he. “It’s always night there when it is day here—\r\nWell, we went right into the water, which was calm and shining under the\r\nmoonlight—just a broad swell that seemed to grow broader and flatter as\r\nI came down into it. The surface glistened just like a skin—it might\r\nhave been empty space underneath for all I could tell to the contrary.\r\nVery slowly, for I rode slanting into it, the water crept up to my eyes.\r\nThen I went under, and the skin seemed to break and heal again about my\r\neyes. The moon gave a jump up in the sky and grew green and dim, and\r\nfish, faintly glowing, came darting round me—and things that seemed made\r\nof luminous glass, and I passed through a tangle of seaweeds that shone\r\nwith an oily lustre. And so I drove down into the sea, and the stars\r\nwent out one by one, and the moon grew greener and darker, and the\r\nseaweed became a luminous purple-red. It was all very faint and\r\nmysterious, and everything seemed to quiver. And all the while I could\r\nhear the wheels of the bath-chair creaking, and the footsteps of people\r\ngoing by, and a man with a bell crying coals.\r\n\r\n“I kept sinking down deeper and deeper into the water. It became inky\r\nblack about me, not a ray from above came down into that darkness, and\r\nthe phosphorescent things grew brighter and brighter. The snaky branches\r\nof the deeper weeds flickered like the flames of spirit lamps; but,\r\nafter a time, there were no more weeds. The fishes came staring and\r\ngaping towards me, and into me and through me. I never imagined such\r\nfishes before. They had lines of fire along the sides of them as though\r\nthey had been outlined with a luminous pencil. And there was a ghastly\r\nthing swimming backwards with a lot of twining arms. And then I saw,\r\ncoming very slowly towards me through the gloom, a hazy mass of light\r\nthat resolved itself as it drew nearer into multitudes of fishes,\r\nstruggling and darting round something that drifted. I drove on straight\r\ntowards it, and presently I saw in the midst of the tumult, and by the\r\nlight of the fish, a bit of splintered spar looming over me, and a dark\r\nhull tilting over, and some glowing phosphorescent forms that were\r\nshaken and writhed as the fish bit at them. Then it was I began to try\r\nto attract Widgery’s attention. A horror came upon me. Ugh! I should\r\nhave driven right into those half-eaten—things. If your sister had not\r\ncome! They had great holes in them, Bellows, and—Never mind. But it was\r\nghastly!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nFor three weeks Davidson remained in this singular state, seeing what at\r\nthe time we imagined was an altogether phantasmal world, and stone blind\r\nto the world around him. Then, one Tuesday, when I called, I met old\r\nDavidson in the passage. “He can see his thumb!” the old gentleman said,\r\nin a perfect transport. He was struggling into his overcoat. “He can see\r\nhis thumb, Bellows!” he said, with the tears in his eyes. “The lad will\r\nbe all right yet.”\r\n\r\nI rushed in to Davidson. He was holding up a little book before his\r\nface, and looking at it and laughing in a weak kind of way.\r\n\r\n“It’s amazing,” said he. “There’s a kind of patch come there.” He\r\npointed with his finger. “I’m on the rocks as usual, and the penguins\r\nare staggering and flapping about as usual, and there’s been a whale\r\nshowing every now and then, but it’s got too dark now to make him out.\r\nBut put something _there_, and I see it—I do see it. It’s very dim and\r\nbroken in places, but I see it all the same, like a faint spectre of\r\nitself. I found it out this morning while they were dressing me. It’s\r\nlike a hole in this infernal phantom world. Just put your hand by mine.\r\nNo—not there. Ah! Yes! I see it. The base of your thumb and a bit of\r\ncuff! It looks like the ghost of a bit of your hand sticking out of the\r\ndarkening sky. Just by it there’s a group of stars like a cross coming\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nFrom that time Davidson began to mend. His account of the change, like\r\nhis account of the vision, was oddly convincing. Over patches of his\r\nfield of vision the phantom world grew fainter, grew transparent, as it\r\nwere, and through these translucent gaps he began to see dimly the real\r\nworld about him. The patches grew in size and number, ran together and\r\nspread until only here and there were blind spots left upon his eyes. He\r\nwas able to get up and steer himself about, feed himself once more,\r\nread, smoke, and behave like an ordinary citizen again. At first it was\r\nvery confusing to him to have these two pictures overlapping each other\r\nlike the changing views of a lantern, but in a little while he began to\r\ndistinguish the real from the illusory.\r\n\r\nAt first he was unfeignedly glad, and seemed only too anxious to\r\ncomplete his cure by taking exercise and tonics. But as that odd island\r\nof his began to fade away from him, he became queerly interested in it.\r\nHe wanted particularly to go down into the deep sea again, and would\r\nspend half his time wandering about the low-lying parts of London,\r\ntrying to find the water-logged wreck he had seen drifting. The glare of\r\nreal daylight very soon impressed him so vividly as to blot out\r\neverything of his shadowy world, but of a night-time, in a darkened\r\nroom, he could still see the white-splashed rocks of the island, and the\r\nclumsy penguins staggering to and fro. But even these grew fainter and\r\nfainter, and, at last, soon after he married my sister, he saw them for\r\nthe last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nAnd now to tell of the queerest thing of all. About two years after his\r\ncure, I dined with the Davidsons, and after dinner a man named Atkins\r\ncalled in. He is a lieutenant in the Royal Navy, and a pleasant,\r\ntalkative man. He was on friendly terms with my brother-in-law, and was\r\nsoon on friendly terms with me. It came out that he was engaged to\r\nDavidson’s cousin, and incidentally he took out a kind of pocket\r\nphotograph case to show us a new rendering of his _fiancée_. “And,\r\nby-the-by,” said he, “here’s the old _Fulmar_.”\r\n\r\nDavidson looked at it casually. Then suddenly his face lit up. “Good\r\nheavens!” said he. “I could almost swear—”\r\n\r\n“What?” said Atkins.\r\n\r\n“That I had seen that ship before.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t see how you can have. She hasn’t been out of the South Seas for\r\nsix years, and before then—”\r\n\r\n“But,” began Davidson, and then, “Yes—that’s the ship I dreamt of. I’m\r\nsure that’s the ship I dreamt of. She was standing off an island that\r\nswarmed with penguins, and she fired a gun.”\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said Atkins, who had never heard the particulars of the\r\nseizure. “How the deuce could you dream that?”\r\n\r\nAnd then, bit by bit, it came out that on the very day Davidson was\r\nseized, H. M. S. _Fulmar_ had actually been off a little rock to the\r\nsouth of Antipodes Island. A boat had landed overnight to get penguins’\r\neggs, had been delayed, and a thunderstorm drifting up, the boat’s crew\r\nhad waited until the morning before rejoining the ship. Atkins had been\r\none of them, and he corroborated, word for word, the descriptions\r\nDavidson had given of the island and the boat. There is not the\r\nslightest doubt in any of our minds that Davidson has really seen the\r\nplace. In some unaccountable way, while he moved hither and thither in\r\nLondon, his sight moved hither and thither in a manner that\r\ncorresponded, about this distant island. _How_ is absolutely a mystery.\r\n\r\nThat completes the remarkable story of Davidson’s eyes. It is perhaps\r\nthe best authenticated case in existence of a real vision at a distance.\r\nExplanation there is none forthcoming, except what Professor Wade has\r\nthrown out. But his explanation invokes the Fourth Dimension, and a\r\ndissertation on theoretical kinds of space. To talk of there being “a\r\nkink in space” seems mere nonsense to me; it may be because I am no\r\nmathematician. When I said that nothing would alter the fact that the\r\nplace is eight thousand miles away, he answered that two points might be\r\na yard away on a sheet of paper and yet be brought together by bending\r\nthe paper round. The reader may grasp his argument, but I certainly do\r\nnot. His idea seems to be that Davidson, stooping between the poles of\r\nthe big electro-magnet, had some extraordinary twist given to his\r\nretinal elements through the sudden change in the field of force due to\r\nthe lightning.\r\n\r\nHe thinks, as a consequence of this, that it may be possible to live\r\nvisually in one part of the world, while one lives bodily in another. He\r\nhas even made some experiments in support of his views; but, so far, he\r\nhas simply succeeded in blinding a few dogs. I believe that is the net\r\nresult of his work, though I have not seen him for some weeks. Latterly,\r\nI have been so busy with my work in connection with the Saint Pancras\r\ninstallation that I have had little opportunity of calling to see him.\r\nBut the whole of his theory seems fantastic to me. The facts concerning\r\nDavidson stand on an altogether different footing, and I can testify\r\npersonally to the accuracy of every detail I have given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE CONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was hot and overcast, the sky redrimmed with the lingering\r\nsunset of midsummer. They sat at the open window trying to fancy the air\r\nwas fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff and\r\ndark; beyond in the roadway a gas lamp burnt, bright orange against the\r\nhazy blue of the evening. Further were the three lights of the railway\r\nsignal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one another\r\nin low tones.\r\n\r\n“He does not suspect?” said the man, a little nervously.\r\n\r\n“Not he,” she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. “He\r\nthinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no\r\nimagination, no poetry—”\r\n\r\n“None of these men of iron have,” he said sententiously. “They have no\r\nhearts.”\r\n\r\n“_He_ has not,” she said. She turned her discontented face towards the\r\nwindow. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew\r\nin volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the\r\ntender. As the train passed there was a glare of light above the cutting\r\nand a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,\r\neight black oblongs—eight trucks—passed across the dim grey of the\r\nembankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the throat of\r\nthe tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down train, smoke,\r\nand sound in one abrupt gulp.\r\n\r\n“This country was all fresh and beautiful once,” he said; “and now—it is\r\nGehenna. Down that way—nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching fire\r\nand dust into the face of heaven— But what does it matter? An end comes,\r\nan end to all this cruelty—_to-morrow_.” He spoke the last word in a\r\nwhisper.\r\n\r\n“_To-morrow_,” she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring\r\nout of the window.\r\n\r\n“Dear!” he said, putting his hand on hers.\r\n\r\nShe turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another’s. Hers\r\nsoftened to his gaze. “My dear one,” she said, and then: “It seems so\r\nstrange—that you should have come into my life like this—to open—” She\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n“To open?” he said.\r\n\r\n“All this wonderful world—” she hesitated and spoke still more\r\nsoftly—“this world of _love_ to me.”\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and\r\nhe started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great\r\nshadowy figure—silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with\r\nunexpressive dark patches under the pent-house brows. Every muscle in\r\nRaut’s body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened? What\r\nhad he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of questions.\r\n\r\nThe new-comer’s voice came at last, after a pause that seemed\r\ninterminable. “Well?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,” said the man at the window,\r\ngripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady.\r\n\r\nThe clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made no\r\nanswer to Raut’s remark. For a moment he stood above them.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s heart was cold within her. “I told Mr. Raut it was just\r\npossible you might come back,” she said, in a voice that never quivered.\r\n\r\nHorrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little\r\nwork-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his\r\neyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath. His\r\neyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had trusted,\r\nand then back to the woman.\r\n\r\nBy this time and for the moment all three half understood one another.\r\nYet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them.\r\n\r\nIt was the husband’s voice that broke the silence at last.\r\n\r\n“You wanted to see me?” he said to Raut.\r\n\r\nRaut started as he spoke. “I came to see you,” he said, resolved to lie\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“You promised,” said Raut, “to show me some fine effects of moonlight\r\nand smoke.”\r\n\r\n“I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,”\r\nrepeated Horrocks, in a colourless voice.\r\n\r\n“And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the\r\nworks,” proceeded Raut, “and come with you.”\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did\r\nhe after all know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the\r\nmoment when they heard the door, their attitudes—Horrocks glanced at the\r\nprofile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light. Then he glanced\r\nat Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. “Of course,” he said,\r\n“I promised to show you the works under their proper dramatic\r\nconditions. It’s odd how I could have forgotten.”\r\n\r\n“If I’m troubling you—” began Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry\r\ngloom of his eyes. “Not in the least,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and\r\nshadow you think so splendid?” said the woman, turning now to her\r\nhusband for the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her\r\nvoice just one half-note too high. “That dreadful theory of yours that\r\nmachinery is beautiful and everything else in the world ugly. I thought\r\nhe would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It’s his great Theory, his one\r\ndiscovery in Art—”\r\n\r\n“I am slow to make discoveries,” said Horrocks, grimly, damping her\r\nsuddenly. “But what I discover—” He stopped.\r\n\r\n“Well?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” and suddenly he rose to his feet.\r\n\r\n“I promised to show you the works,” he said to Raut, and put his big,\r\nclumsy hand on his friend’s shoulder. “And you are ready to go?”\r\n\r\n“Quite,” said Raut, and stood up also.\r\n\r\nThere was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness\r\nof the dusk at the other two. Horrocks’s hand still rested on Raut’s\r\nshoulder. Raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after\r\nall. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband better, knew that grim quiet in\r\nhis voice, and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical\r\nevil. “Very well,” said Horrocks, and, dropping his hand, turned towards\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“My hat?” Raut looked round in the half-light.\r\n\r\n“That’s my work-basket,” said Mrs. Horrocks, with a gust of hysterical\r\nlaughter. The hands came together on the back of the chair. “Here it\r\nis!” he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she\r\ncould not frame a word. “Don’t go!” and “Beware of him!” struggled in\r\nher mind, and the swift moment passed.\r\n\r\n“Got it?” said Horrocks, standing with door half open.\r\n\r\nRaut stepped towards him. “Better say good-bye to Mrs. Horrocks,” said\r\nthe ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before.\r\n\r\nRaut started and turned. “Good evening, Mrs. Horrocks,” he said, and\r\ntheir hands touched.\r\n\r\nHorrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him\r\ntowards men. Raut went out and then, after a wordless look at her, her\r\nhusband followed. She stood motionless while Raut’s light footfall and\r\nher husband’s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the passage\r\ntogether. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the window, moving\r\nslowly, and stood watching—leaning forward. The two men appeared for a\r\nmoment at the gateway in the road, passed under the street lamp, and\r\nwere hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The lamplight fell for\r\na moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning pale patches, telling\r\nnothing of what she still feared, and doubted, and craved vainly to\r\nknow. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude in the big arm-chair,\r\nher eyes wide open and staring out at the red lights from the furnaces\r\nthat flickered in the sky. An hour after she was still there, her\r\nattitude scarcely changed.\r\n\r\nThe oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They\r\nwent side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into\r\nthe cinder-made by-way that presently opened out the prospect of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nA blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with mystery.\r\nBeyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined thinly by\r\nthe rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there a gas-lit\r\nwindow, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or crowded\r\npublic-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the evening\r\nsky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a few\r\nsmokeless during a season of “play.” Here and there a pallid patch and\r\nghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank, or a\r\nwheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some colliery\r\nwhere they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at hand was\r\nthe broad stretch of railway, and half invisible trains shunted—a steady\r\npuffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing concussion and a rhythmic\r\nseries of impacts, and a passage of intermittent puffs of white steam\r\nacross the further view. And to the left, between the railway and the\r\ndark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view, colossal,\r\ninky black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great\r\ncylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of\r\nthe big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy\r\nand threatening, full of an incessant turmoil of flames and seething\r\nmolten iron, and about the feet of them rattled the rolling mills, and\r\nthe steam hammer beat heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither\r\nand thither. Even as they looked a truckful of fuel was shot into one of\r\nthe giants, and the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and\r\nblack dust came boiling upwards towards the sky.\r\n\r\n“Certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces,” said\r\nRaut, breaking a silence that had become apprehensive.\r\n\r\nHorrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down\r\nat the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as\r\nif he were thinking out some knotty problem.\r\n\r\nRaut glanced at him and away again. “At present your moonlight effect is\r\nhardly ripe,” he continued, looking upward; “the moon is still smothered\r\nby the vestiges of daylight.”\r\n\r\nHorrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly\r\nawakened. “Vestiges of daylight! Of course, of course.” He too looked up\r\nat the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. “Come along,” he said\r\nsuddenly, and, gripping Raut’s arm in his hand, made a move towards the\r\npath that dropped from them towards the railway.\r\n\r\nRaut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment\r\nthat their lips came near to say. Horrocks’s hand tightened and then\r\nrelaxed. He left go, and before Raut was aware, they were arm in arm,\r\nand walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path.\r\n\r\n“You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,” said\r\nHorrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast and tightening\r\nthe grip of his elbow the while. “Little green lights and red and white\r\nlights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect, Raut. It’s a\r\nfine effect. And look at those furnaces of mine, how they rise upon us\r\nas we come down the hill. That to the right is my pet—seventy feet of\r\nhim. I packed him myself, and he’s boiled away cheerfully with iron in\r\nhis guts for five long years. I’ve a particular fancy for _him_. That\r\nline of red there,—a lovely bit of warm orange you’d call it,\r\nRaut,—that’s the puddler’s furnaces, and there, in the hot light, three\r\nblack figures—did you see the white splash of the steam hammer\r\nthen?—that’s the rolling mills. Come along! Clang, clatter, how it goes\r\nrattling across the floor! Sheet tin, Raut,—amazing stuff. Glass mirrors\r\nare not in it when that stuff comes from the mill. And, squelch!—there\r\ngoes the hammer again. Come along!”\r\n\r\nHe had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into\r\nRaut’s with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black\r\npath towards the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not spoken\r\na word, had simply hung back against Horrocks’s pull with all his\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undernote of snarl\r\nin his voice, “why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks, and\r\ndragging me along like this?”\r\n\r\nAt length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. “Nipping your\r\narm off!” he said. “Sorry. But it’s you taught me the trick of walking\r\nin that friendly way.”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t learnt the refinements of it yet then,” said Raut, laughing\r\nartificially again. “By Jove! I’m black and blue.” Horrocks offered no\r\napology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close to the fence\r\nthat bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger and spread out\r\nwith their approach. They looked up to the blast furnaces now instead of\r\ndown; the further view of Etruria and Hanley had dropped out of sight\r\nwith their descent. Before them, by the stile, rose a notice board,\r\nbearing, still dimly visible, the words “BEWARE OF THE TRAINS,” half\r\nhidden by splashes of coaly mud.\r\n\r\n“Fine effects,” said Horrocks, waving his arm. “Here comes a train. The\r\npuffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of it,\r\nthe melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used to\r\nbe finer, before we shoved cones in their throats and saved the gas.”\r\n\r\n“How?” said Raut. “Cones?”\r\n\r\n“Cones, my man, cones. I’ll show you one nearer. The flames used to\r\nflare out of the open throats, great—what is it?—pillars of cloud by\r\nday, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it\r\noff in pipes and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a\r\ncone. You’ll be interested in that cone.”\r\n\r\n“But every now and then,” said Raut, “you get a burst of fire and smoke\r\nup there.”\r\n\r\n“The cone’s not fixed, it’s hung by a chain from a lever and balanced by\r\nan equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there’d be no\r\nway of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone dips and\r\nout comes the flare.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. “The moon gets\r\nbrighter,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Come along,” said Horrocks, abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and\r\nmoving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of\r\nthose swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful\r\nand reeling. Half-way across, Horrocks’s hand suddenly clenched upon him\r\nlike a vice, and swung him backward and through a half turn, so that he\r\nlooked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage-windows\r\ntelescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow\r\nlights of an engine grew larger and larger rushing down upon them. As he\r\ngrasped what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks and pushed with\r\nall his strength against the arm that held him back between the rails.\r\nThe struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was that\r\nHorrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been violently\r\nlugged out of danger.\r\n\r\n“Out of the way!” said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train came rattling\r\nby, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks.\r\n\r\n“I did not see it coming,” said Raut, still, even in spite of his own\r\napprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse.\r\n\r\nHorrocks answered with a grunt. “The cone,” he said, and then as one who\r\nrecovers himself—“I thought you did not hear.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t,” said Raut.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t have had you run over then for the world,” said Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“For a moment I lost my nerve,” said Raut.\r\n\r\nHorrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the\r\nironworks again. “See how fine these great mounds of mine, these clinker\r\nheaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up it goes,\r\nand out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go sliding down\r\nthe slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts the blast\r\nfurnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way! This way,\r\nbetween the block heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I want\r\nto show you the canal first.” He came and took Raut by the elbow, and so\r\nthey went along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely. What, he\r\nasked himself, had really happened on the line? Was he deluding himself\r\nwith his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held him back in the way\r\nof the train? Had he just been within an ace of being murdered?\r\n\r\nSuppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything? For a\r\nminute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood\r\npassed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have heard\r\nnothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time. His odd\r\nmanner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown once before.\r\nHe was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. “Eigh?” said\r\nHorrocks.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Raut. “Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!”\r\n\r\n“Our canal,” said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. “Our canal by moonlight\r\nand firelight is an immense effect. You’ve never seen it? Fancy that!\r\nYou’ve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle\r\nthere. I tell you, for real florid effects— But you shall see. Boiling\r\nwater—”\r\n\r\nAs they came out of the labyrinth of clinker heaps and mounds of coal\r\nand ore, the noises of the rolling mill sprang upon them suddenly, loud,\r\nnear, and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched their caps\r\nto Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut felt a futile\r\nimpulse to address them, and before he could frame his words they passed\r\ninto the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal close before them now: a\r\nweird-looking place it seemed, in the blood-red reflections of the\r\nfurnaces. The hot water that cooled the tuyeres came into it, some fifty\r\nyards up—a tumultuous, almost boiling affluent, and the steam rose up\r\nfrom the water in silent white whisps and streaks, wrapping damply about\r\nthem, an incessant succession of ghosts coming up from the black and red\r\neddies, a white uprising that made the head swim. The shining black\r\ntower of the larger blast-furnace rose overhead out of the mist, and its\r\ntumultuous riot filled their ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the\r\nwater and watched Horrocks.\r\n\r\n“Here it is red,” said Horrocks, “blood-red vapour as red and hot as\r\nsin; but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it and it drives\r\nacross the clinker heaps, it is as white as death.”\r\n\r\nRaut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his\r\nwatch on Horrocks. “Come along to the rolling mills,” said Horrocks. The\r\nthreatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a little\r\nreassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean about\r\n“white as death” and “red as sin”? Coincidence, perhaps?\r\n\r\nThey went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then\r\nthrough the rolling mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate\r\nsteam hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,\r\nhalf-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax, between\r\nthe wheels. “Come on,” said Horrocks in Raut’s ear, and they went and\r\npeeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres, and saw the\r\ntumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left one eye\r\nblinded for a while. Then with green and blue patches dancing across the\r\ndark they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and fuel and lime\r\nwere raised to the top of the big cylinder.\r\n\r\nAnd out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace Raut’s doubts\r\ncame upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did\r\nknow—everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent\r\ntrembling. Right underfoot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a\r\ndangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing\r\nthat crowned the place. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapour\r\nstreaked with pungent bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside of\r\nHanley quiver. The moon was riding out now from among a drift of clouds,\r\nhalf way up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of Newcastle.\r\nThe steaming canal ran away from below them under an indistinct bridge,\r\nand vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields towards Burslem.\r\n\r\n“That’s the cone I’ve been telling you of,” shouted Horrocks, “and,\r\nbelow that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the\r\nblast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.”\r\n\r\nRaut gripped the handrail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The heat\r\nwas intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast made a\r\nthunderous accompaniment to Horrocks’s voice. But the thing had to be\r\ngone through now. Perhaps, after all—\r\n\r\n“In the middle,” bawled Horrocks, “temperature near a thousand degrees.\r\nIf _you_ were dropped into it—flash into flame like a pinch of gunpowder\r\nin a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his breath. Why even\r\nup here I’ve seen the rain-water boiling off the trucks. And that cone\r\nthere. It’s a damned sight too hot for roasting cakes. The top side of\r\nit’s three hundred degrees.”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred degrees!” said Raut.\r\n\r\n“Three hundred centigrade, mind!” said Horrocks. “It will boil the blood\r\nout of you in no time.”\r\n\r\n“Eigh?” said Raut, and turned.\r\n\r\n“Boil the blood out of you in— No you don’t!”\r\n\r\n“Let me go!” screamed Raut “Let go my arm.”\r\n\r\nWith one hand he clutched at the handrail, then with both. For a moment\r\nthe two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk, Horrocks\r\nhad twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and missed, his\r\nfoot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted himself, and then\r\ncheek and shoulder, and knee struck the hot cone together.\r\n\r\nHe clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an\r\ninfinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared\r\nabout him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,\r\nflickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees, and\r\nhe could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his feet\r\nand tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his head.\r\nBlack and shining with the moonlight the throat of the furnace rose\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nHorrocks he saw stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the\r\nrail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight,\r\nand shouting, “Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You\r\nhot-blooded hound! Boil! boil! boil!”\r\n\r\nSuddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck and flung it\r\ndeliberately, lump after lump, at Raut.\r\n\r\n“Horrocks!” cried Raut, “Horrocks!”\r\n\r\nHe clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of the\r\ncone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and\r\nglowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped and a rush of hot\r\nsuffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nHis human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had passed\r\nHorrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked with blood,\r\nstill clutching and fumbling with the chain and writhing in agony—a\r\ncindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a sobbing,\r\nintermittent shriek.\r\n\r\nAbruptly at the sight the ironmaster’s anger passed. A deadly sickness\r\ncame upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting up to his\r\nnostrils. His sanity returned to him.\r\n\r\n“God have mercy upon me!” he cried. “Oh, God! what have I done?”\r\n\r\nHe knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was\r\nalready a dead man—that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in\r\nhis veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind and\r\novercame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and\r\nthen, turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the\r\nstruggling thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud and\r\nwent radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a\r\nboiling confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards him.\r\nAs it passed he saw the cone clear again.\r\n\r\nThen he staggered back and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with\r\nboth hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them.\r\n\r\nDown below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of\r\nrolling in the shed ceased abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PURPLE PILEUS\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes was sick of life. He walked away from his unhappy home, and,\r\nsick not only of his own existence, but of everybody else’s, turned\r\naside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing the wooden\r\nbridge that goes over the canal to Starling’s Cottages, was presently\r\nalone in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and sound of human\r\nhabitation. He would stand it no longer. He repeated aloud with\r\nblasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no longer.\r\n\r\nHe was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very black\r\nmoustache. He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, that\r\ngave him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby) was\r\ntrimmed with astrachan. His gloves were a bright brown with black\r\nstripes over the knuckles, and split at the finger-ends. His appearance,\r\nhis wife had said once in the dear, dead days beyond recall,—before he\r\nmarried her, that is,—was military. But now she called him— It seems a\r\ndreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife, but she called him\r\n“a little grub.” It wasn’t the only thing she had called him, either.\r\n\r\nThe row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again. Jennie was his\r\nwife’s friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came in every\r\nblessed Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon. She was a\r\nbig, noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident laugh; and\r\nthis Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions by bringing in a\r\nfellow with her, a chap as showy as herself. And Mr. Coombes, in a\r\nstarchy, clean collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had sat dumb and\r\nwrathful at his own table, while his wife and her guests talked\r\nfoolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud. Well, he stood that, and\r\nafter dinner (which, “as usual,” was late), what must Miss Jennie do but\r\ngo to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world as if it were a\r\nweek-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such goings-on. They would\r\nhear next door; they would hear in the road; it was a public\r\nannouncement of their disrepute. He had to speak.\r\n\r\nHe had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected his\r\nrespiration as he delivered himself. He had been sitting on one of the\r\nchairs by the window—the new guest had taken possession of the\r\narm-chair. He turned his head. “Sun Day!” he said over the collar, in\r\nthe voice of one who warns. “Sun Day!” What people call a “nasty” tone\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nJennie had kept on playing; but his wife, who was looking through some\r\nmusic that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him. “What’s\r\nwrong now?” she said; “can’t people enjoy themselves?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mind rational ’njoyment, at all,” said little Coombes; “but I\r\nain’t a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in this house.”\r\n\r\n“What’s wrong with my playing now?” said Jennie, stopping and twirling\r\nround on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.\r\n\r\nCoombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, as is\r\ncommon with your timid, nervous men all the world over. “Steady on with\r\nthat music-stool!” said he; “it ain’t made for ’eavy weights.”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind about weights,” said Jennie, incensed. “What was you\r\nsaying behind my back about my playing?”\r\n\r\n“Surely you don’t ’old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, Mr.\r\nCoombes?” said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, blowing a\r\ncloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying way. And\r\nsimultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about “Never mind ’im.\r\nYou go on, Jinny.”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest.\r\n\r\n“May I arst why?” said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his\r\ncigarette and the prospect of an argument. He was, by-the-by, a lank\r\nyoung man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, with a white cravat\r\nand a pearl and silver pin. It had been better taste to come in a black\r\ncoat, Mr. Coombes thought.\r\n\r\n“Because,” began Mr. Coombes, “it don’t suit me. I’m a business man. I\r\n’ave to study my connection. Rational ’njoyment—”\r\n\r\n“His connection!” said Mrs. Coombes, scornfully. “That’s what he’s\r\nalways a-saying. We got to do this, and we got to do that—”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mean to study my connection,” said Mr. Coombes, “what did\r\nyou marry me for?”\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” said Jennie, and turned back to the piano.\r\n\r\n“I never saw such a man as you,” said Mrs. Coombes. “You’ve altered all\r\nround since we were married. Before—”\r\n\r\nThen Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again.\r\n\r\n“Look here!” said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up and\r\nraising his voice. “I tell you I won’t have that.” The frock-coat heaved\r\nwith his indignation.\r\n\r\n“No vi’lence, now,” said the long young man in drab, sitting up.\r\n\r\n“Who the juice are you?” said Mr. Coombes, fiercely.\r\n\r\nWhereupon they all began talking at once. The new guest said he was\r\nJennie’s “intended,” and meant to protect her, and Mr. Coombes said he\r\nwas welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr. Coombes’) house; and Mrs.\r\nCoombes said he ought to be ashamed of insulting his guests, and (as I\r\nhave already mentioned) that he was getting a regular little grub; and\r\nthe end was, that Mr. Coombes ordered his visitors out of the house, and\r\nthey wouldn’t go, and so he said he would go himself. With his face\r\nburning and tears of excitement in his eyes, he went into the passage,\r\nand as he struggled with his overcoat—his frock-coat sleeves got\r\nconcertinaed up his arm—and gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began\r\nagain at the piano, and strummed him insultingly out of the house. Tum,\r\ntum, tum. He slammed the shop-door so that the house quivered. That,\r\nbriefly, was the immediate making of his mood. You will perhaps begin to\r\nunderstand his disgust with existence.\r\n\r\nAs he walked along the muddy path under the firs,—it was late October,\r\nand the ditches and heaps of fir-needles were gorgeous with clumps of\r\nfungi,—he recapitulated the melancholy history of his marriage. It was\r\nbrief and commonplace enough. He now perceived with sufficient clearness\r\nthat his wife had married him out of a natural curiosity and in order to\r\nescape from her worrying, laborious, and uncertain life in the workroom;\r\nand, like the majority of her class, she was far too stupid to realise\r\nthat it was her duty to co-operate with him in his business. She was\r\ngreedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and socially-minded, and evidently\r\ndisappointed to find the restraints of poverty still hanging about her.\r\nHis worries exasperated her, and the slightest attempt to control her\r\nproceedings resulted in a charge of “grumbling.” Why couldn’t he be\r\nnice—as he used to be? And Coombes was such a harmless little man, too,\r\nnourished mentally on “Self-Help,” and with a meagre ambition of\r\nself-denial and competition, that was to end in a “sufficiency.” Then\r\nJennie came in as a female Mephistopheles, a gabbling chronicle of\r\n“fellers,” and was always wanting his wife to go to theatres, and “all\r\nthat.” And in addition were aunts of his wife, and cousins (male and\r\nfemale), to eat up capital, insult him personally, upset business\r\narrangements, annoy good customers, and generally blight his life. It\r\nwas not the first occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his home in\r\nwrath and indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously and\r\neven aloud that he wouldn’t stand it, and so frothing away his energy\r\nalong the line of least resistance. But never before had he been quite\r\nso sick of life as on this particular Sunday afternoon. The Sunday\r\ndinner may have had its share in his despair—and the greyness of the\r\nsky. Perhaps, too, he was beginning to realise his unendurable\r\nfrustration as a business man as the consequence of his marriage.\r\nPresently bankruptcy, and after that— Perhaps she might have reason to\r\nrepent when it was too late. And destiny, as I have already intimated,\r\nhad planted the path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly\r\nand variously planted it, not only on the right side, but on the left.\r\n\r\nA small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns out\r\na disloyal partner. His capital is all tied up in his business, and to\r\nleave her, means to join the unemployed in some strange part of the\r\nearth. The luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether. So that the\r\ngood old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably for\r\nhim, and things work up to tragic culminations. Bricklayers kick their\r\nwives to death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the small\r\nclerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a cutting of\r\nthroats. Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable—and you\r\nmust take it as charitably as you can—that the mind of Mr. Coombes ran\r\nfor awhile on some such glorious close to his disappointed hopes, and\r\nthat he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives, and touching letters\r\nto the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, and praying piously for\r\nforgiveness. After a time his fierceness gave way to melancholia. He had\r\nbeen married in this very overcoat, in his first and only frock-coat\r\nthat was buttoned up beneath it. He began to recall their courting along\r\nthis very walk, his years of penurious saving to get capital, and the\r\nbright hopefulness of his marrying days. For it all to work out like\r\nthis! Was there no sympathetic ruler anywhere in the world? He reverted\r\nto death as a topic.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether he\r\nshouldn’t stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was while\r\ndrowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his eye. He\r\nlooked at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and stooped towards\r\nit to pick it up, under the impression that it was some such small\r\nleather object as a purse. Then he saw that it was the purple top of a\r\nfungus, a peculiarly poisonous-looking purple: slimy, shiny, and\r\nemitting a sour odour. He hesitated with his hand an inch or so from it,\r\nand the thought of poison crossed his mind. With that he picked the\r\nthing, and stood up again with it in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe odour was certainly strong—acrid, but by no means disgusting. He\r\nbroke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that\r\nchanged like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green\r\ncolour. It was even an inviting-looking change. He broke off two other\r\npieces to see it repeated. They were wonderful things, these fungi,\r\nthought Mr. Coombes, and all of them the deadliest poisons, as his\r\nfather had often told him. Deadly poisons!\r\n\r\nThere is no time like the present for a rash resolve. Why not here and\r\nnow? thought Mr. Coombes. He tasted a little piece, a very little piece\r\nindeed—a mere crumb. It was so pungent that he almost spat it out again,\r\nthen merely hot and full-flavoured,—a kind of German mustard with a\r\ntouch of horse-radish and—well, mushroom. He swallowed it in the\r\nexcitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not? His mind was\r\ncuriously careless. He would try another bit. It really wasn’t bad—it\r\nwas good. He forgot his troubles in the interest of the immediate\r\nmoment. Playing with death it was. He took another bite, and then\r\ndeliberately finished a mouthful. A curious tingling sensation began in\r\nhis finger-tips and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The blood in\r\nhis ears sounded like a mill-race. “Try bi’ more,” said Mr. Coombes. He\r\nturned and looked about him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw and\r\nstruggled towards a little patch of purple a dozen yards away. “Jol’\r\ngoo’ stuff,” said Mr. Coombes. “E—lomore ye’.” He pitched forward and\r\nfell on his face, his hands outstretched towards the cluster of pilei.\r\nBut he did not eat any more of them. He forgot forthwith.\r\n\r\nHe rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his face. His\r\ncarefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch. He pressed\r\nhis hand to his brow. Something had happened, but he could not rightly\r\ndetermine what it was. Anyhow, he was no longer dull—he felt bright,\r\ncheerful. And his throat was afire. He laughed in the sudden gaiety of\r\nhis heart. Had he been dull? He did not know; but at any rate he would\r\nbe dull no longer. He got up and stood unsteadily, regarding the\r\nuniverse with an agreeable smile. He began to remember. He could not\r\nremember very well, because of a steam roundabout that was beginning in\r\nhis head. And he knew he had been disagreeable at home, just because\r\nthey wanted to be happy. They were quite right; life should be as gay as\r\npossible. He would go home and make it up, and reassure them. And why\r\nnot take some of this delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A\r\nhatful, no less. Some of those red ones with white spots as well, and a\r\nfew yellow. He had been a dull dog, an enemy to merriment; he would make\r\nup for it. It would be gay to turn his coat sleeves inside out, and\r\nstick some yellow gorse into his waistcoat pockets. Then\r\nhome—singing—for a jolly evening.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, and\r\nturned round on the music-stool again. “What a fuss about nothing,” said\r\nJennie.\r\n\r\n“You see, Mr. Clarence, what I’ve got to put up with,” said Mrs.\r\nCoombes.\r\n\r\n“He is a bit hasty,” said Mr. Clarence, judicially.\r\n\r\n“He ain’t got the slightest sense of our position,” said Mrs. Coombes;\r\n“that’s what I complain of. He cares for nothing but his old shop; and\r\nif I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, or\r\nget any little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there’s\r\ndisagreeables. ‘Economy,’ he says; ‘struggle for life,’ and all that. He\r\nlies awake of nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of a\r\nshilling. He wanted us to eat Dorset butter once. If once I was to give\r\nin to him—there!”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Jennie.\r\n\r\n“If a man values a woman,” said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in the\r\narm-chair, “he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her. For my own\r\npart,” said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, “I shouldn’t think of\r\nmarrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style. It’s\r\ndownright selfishness. A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by\r\nhimself, and not drag her—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree altogether with that,” said Jennie. “I don’t see why a\r\nman shouldn’t have a woman’s help, provided he doesn’t treat her meanly,\r\nyou know. It’s meanness—”\r\n\r\n“You wouldn’t believe,” said Mrs. Coombes. “But I was a fool to ’ave\r\n’im. I might ’ave known. If it ’adn’t been for my father, we shouldn’t\r\nhave had not a carriage to our wedding.”\r\n\r\n“Lord! he didn’t stick out at that?” said Mr. Clarence, quite shocked.\r\n\r\n“Said he wanted the money for his stock, or some such rubbish. Why, he\r\nwouldn’t have a woman in to help me once a week if it wasn’t for my\r\nstanding out plucky. And the fusses he makes about money—comes to me,\r\nwell, pretty near crying, with sheets of paper and figgers. ‘If only we\r\ncan tide over this year,’ he says, ‘the business is bound to go.’ ‘If\r\nonly we can tide over this year,’ I says; ‘then it’ll be, if only we can\r\ntide over next year. I know you,’ I says. ‘And you don’t catch me\r\nscrewing myself lean and ugly. Why didn’t you marry a slavey,’ I says,\r\n‘if you wanted one—instead of a respectable girl?’ I says.”\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Coombes. But we will not follow this unedifying conversation\r\nfurther. Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed\r\nof, and they had a snug little time round the fire. Then Mrs. Coombes\r\nwent to get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the arm of Mr.\r\nClarence’s chair until the tea-things clattered outside. “What was that\r\nI heard?” asked Mrs. Coombes, playfully, as she entered, and there was\r\nbadinage about kissing. They were just sitting down to the little\r\ncircular table when the first intimation of Mr. Coombes’ return was\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nThis was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.\r\n\r\n“’Ere’s my lord,” said Mrs. Coombes. “Went out like a lion and comes\r\nback like a lamb, I’ll lay.”\r\n\r\nSomething fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like. Then there\r\nwas a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the passage. Then\r\nthe door opened and Coombes appeared. But it was Coombes transfigured.\r\nThe immaculate collar had been torn carelessly from his throat. His\r\ncarefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush of fungi, was under one\r\narm; his coat was inside out, and his waistcoat adorned with bunches of\r\nyellow-blossomed furze. These little eccentricities of Sunday costume,\r\nhowever, were quite overshadowed by the change in his face; it was livid\r\nwhite, his eyes were unnaturally large and bright, and his pale blue\r\nlips were drawn back in a cheerless grin. “Merry!” he said. He had\r\nstopped dancing to open the door. “Rational ’njoyment. Dance.” He made\r\nthree fantastic steps into the room, and stood bowing.\r\n\r\n“Jim!” shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence sat petrified, with a\r\ndropping lower jaw.\r\n\r\n“Tea,” said Mr. Coombes. “Jol’ thing, tea. Tose-stools, too. Brosher.”\r\n\r\n“He’s drunk,” said Jennie, in a weak voice. Never before had she seen\r\nthis intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agaric to Mr. Clarence. “Jo’\r\nstuff,” said he; “ta’ some.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment he was genial. Then at the sight of their startled faces\r\nhe changed, with the swift transition of insanity, into overbearing\r\nfury. And it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel of his\r\ndeparture. In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never heard before,\r\nhe shouted, “My house. I’m master ’ere. Eat what I give yer!” He bawled\r\nthis, as it seemed, without an effort, without a violent gesture,\r\nstanding there as motionless as one who whispers, holding out a handful\r\nof fungus.\r\n\r\nClarence approved himself a coward. He could not meet the mad fury in\r\nCoombes’ eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, and turned,\r\nstooping. At that Coombes rushed at him. Jennie saw her opportunity,\r\nand, with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door. Mrs. Coombes\r\nfollowed her. Clarence tried to dodge. Over went the tea-table with a\r\nsmash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and tried to thrust the\r\nfungus into his mouth. Clarence was content to leave his collar behind\r\nhim, and shot out into the passage with red patches of fly agaric still\r\nadherent to his face. “Shut ’im in!” cried Mrs. Coombes, and would have\r\nclosed the door, but her supports deserted her; Jennie saw the shop-door\r\nopen, and vanished thereby, locking it behind her, while Clarence went\r\non hastily into the kitchen. Mr. Coombes came heavily against the door,\r\nand Mrs. Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and locked\r\nherself in the spare bedroom.\r\n\r\nSo the new convert to _joie de vivre_ emerged upon the passage, his\r\ndecorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi\r\nstill under his arm. He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on the\r\nkitchen. Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, gave up the\r\nattempt to imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, only to be\r\ncaptured before he could open the door into the yard. Mr. Clarence is\r\nsingularly reticent of the details of what occurred. It seems that Mr.\r\nCoombes’ transitory irritation had vanished again, and he was once more\r\na genial playfellow. And as there were knives and meat-choppers about,\r\nClarence very generously resolved to humour him and so avoid anything\r\ntragic. It is beyond dispute that Mr. Coombes played with Mr. Clarence\r\nto his heart’s content; they could not have been more playful and\r\nfamiliar if they had known each other for years. He insisted gaily on\r\nClarence trying the fungi, and after a friendly tussle, was smitten with\r\nremorse at the mess he was making of his guest’s face. It also appears\r\nthat Clarence was dragged under the sink and his face scrubbed with the\r\nblacking-brush,—he being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any\r\ncost,—and that finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and\r\ndiscoloured condition, he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the\r\nback door, the shopway being barred by Jennie. Mr. Coombes’ wandering\r\nthoughts then turned to Jennie. Jennie had been unable to unfasten the\r\nshop-door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes’ latch-key, and\r\nremained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, still in\r\npursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank (or spilt\r\ndown the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than five\r\nbottles of the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her health’s\r\nsake. He made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks of the bottles\r\nwith several of his wife’s wedding-present dinner-plates, and during the\r\nearlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry ballads. He cut\r\nhis finger rather badly with one of the bottles,—the only bloodshed in\r\nthis story,—and what with that, and the systematic convulsion of his\r\ninexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand of Mrs. Coombes’ stout,\r\nit may be the evil of the fungus poison was somehow allayed. But we\r\nprefer to draw a veil over the concluding incidents of this Sunday\r\nafternoon. They ended in the coal cellar, in a deep and healing sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interval of five years elapsed. Again it was a Sunday afternoon in\r\nOctober, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pinewood beyond the\r\ncanal. He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached little man that\r\nhe was at the outset of the story, but his double chin was now scarcely\r\nso illusory as it had been. His overcoat was new, with a velvet lapel,\r\nand a stylish collar with turndown corners, free of any coarse\r\nstarchiness, had replaced the original all-round article. His hat was\r\nglossy, his gloves newish—though one finger had split and been carefully\r\nmended. And a casual observer would have noticed about him a certain\r\nrectitude of bearing, a certain erectness of head that marks the man who\r\nthinks well of himself. He was a master now, with three assistants.\r\nBeside him walked a larger sunburnt parody of himself, his brother Tom,\r\njust back from Australia. They were recapitulating their early\r\nstruggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been making a financial statement.\r\n\r\n“It’s a very nice little business, Jim,” said brother Tom. “In these\r\ndays of competition, you’re jolly lucky to have worked it up so. And\r\nyou’re jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who’s willing to help like yours\r\ndoes.”\r\n\r\n“Between ourselves,” said Mr. Coombes, “it wasn’t always so. It wasn’t\r\nalways like this. To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy. Girls are\r\nfunny creatures.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You’d hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, and\r\nalways having slaps at me. I was a bit too easy and loving, and all\r\nthat, and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her. Turned the\r\n’ouse into a regular caravansary, always having her relations and girls\r\nfrom business in, and their chaps. Comic songs a’ Sunday, it was getting\r\nto, and driving trade away. And she was making eyes at the chaps, too! I\r\ntell you, Tom, the place wasn’t my own.”\r\n\r\n“Shouldn’t ’a’ thought it.”\r\n\r\n“It was so. Well—I reasoned with her. I said, ‘I ain’t a duke, to keep a\r\nwife like a pet animal. I married you for ’elp and company.’ I said,\r\n‘You got to ’elp and pull the business through.’ She would n’t ’ear of\r\nit. ‘Very well,’ I says; ‘I’m a mild man till I’m roused,’ I says, ‘and\r\nit’s getting to that.’ But she wouldn’t ’ear of no warnings.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the way with women. She didn’t think I ’ad it in me to be roused.\r\nWomen of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don’t respect a man until\r\nthey’re a bit afraid of him. So I just broke out to show her. In comes a\r\ngirl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her chap. We ’ad a\r\nbit of a row, and I came out ’ere—it was just such another day as\r\nthis—and I thought it all out. Then I went back and pitched into them.”\r\n“You did?”\r\n\r\n“I did. I was mad, I can tell you. I wasn’t going to ’it ’er, if I could\r\n’elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show ’er what\r\nI could do. ’E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed\r\nthings about, and gave ’er a scaring, and she ran up and locked ’erself\r\ninto the spare room.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“That’s all. I says to ’er the next morning, ‘Now you know,’ I says,\r\n‘what I’m like when I’m roused.’ And I didn’t ’ave to say anything\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“And you’ve been happy ever after, eh?”\r\n\r\n“So to speak. There’s nothing like putting your foot down with them. If\r\nit ’adn’t been for that afternoon I should ’a’ been tramping the roads\r\nnow, and she’d ’a’ been grumbling at me, and all her family grumbling\r\nfor bringing her to poverty—I know their little ways. But we’re all\r\nright now. And it’s a very decent little business, as you say.”\r\n\r\nThey proceed on their way meditatively. “Women are funny creatures,”\r\nsaid brother Tom.\r\n\r\n“They want a firm hand,” says Coombes.\r\n\r\n“What a lot of these funguses there are about here!” remarked brother\r\nTom, presently. “I can’t see what use they are in the world.”\r\n\r\nMr. Coombes looked. “I dessay they’re sent for some wise purpose,” said\r\nMr. Coombes.\r\n\r\nAnd that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for maddening\r\nthis absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and so altering\r\nthe whole course of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A CATASTROPHE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little shop was not paying. The realisation came insensibly. Winslow\r\nwas not the man for definite addition and subtraction and sudden\r\ndiscovery. He became aware of the truth in his mind gradually, as though\r\nit had always been there. A lot of facts had converged and led him to\r\nconviction. There was that line of cretonnes—four half pieces—untouched,\r\nsave for half-a-yard sold to cover a stool. There were those shirtings\r\nat 4¾_d._—Bandersnatch, in the Broadway, was selling them at\r\n2¾_d._—under cost, in fact. (Surely Bandersnatch might let a man live!)\r\nThose servants’ caps, a selling line, needed replenishing, and that\r\nbrought back the memory of Winslow’s sole wholesale dealers, Helter,\r\nSkelter, & Grab. Why! How about their account?\r\n\r\nWinslow stood with a big green box open on the counter before him when\r\nhe thought of it. His pale grey eyes grew a little rounder, his pale\r\nstraggling moustache twitched. He had been drifting along, day after\r\nday. He went round to the ramshackle cash desk in the corner—it was\r\nWinslow’s weakness to sell his goods over the counter, give his\r\ncustomers a duplicate bill, and then dodge into the desk to receive the\r\nmoney, as though he doubted his own honesty. His lank forefinger with\r\nthe prominent joints ran down the bright little calendar (“Clack’s\r\nCottons last for All Time?”). “One—two—three; three weeks an’ a day!”\r\nsaid Winslow, staring. “March! Only three weeks and a day. It _can’t_\r\nbe.”\r\n\r\n“Tea, dear,” said Mrs. Winslow, opening the door with the glass window\r\nand the white blind that communicated with the parlour.\r\n\r\n“One minute,” said Winslow, and began unlocking the desk.\r\n\r\nAn irritable old gentleman, very hot and red about the face, and in a\r\nheavy fur-lined cloak, came in noisily. Mrs. Winslow vanished.\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said the old gentleman. “Pocket-handkerchief.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” said Winslow. “About what price—”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said the old gentleman. “Poggit handkerchief, quig!”\r\n\r\nWinslow began to feel flustered. He produced two boxes.\r\n\r\n“These, sir,” began Winslow.\r\n\r\n“Sheed tin!” said the old gentleman, clutching the stiffness of the\r\nlinen. “Wad to blow my nose—not haggit about.”\r\n\r\n“A cotton one, p’raps, sir?” said Winslow.\r\n\r\n“How much?” said the old gentleman, over the handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Sevenpence, sir. There’s nothing more I can show you? No ties, braces—”\r\n\r\n“Damn!” said the old gentleman, fumbling in his ticket-pocket, and\r\nfinally producing half-a-crown. Winslow looked round for his little\r\nmetallic duplicate book which he kept in various fixtures, according to\r\ncircumstances, and then he caught the old gentleman’s eye. He went\r\nstraight to the desk at once and got the change, with an entire\r\ndisregard of the routine of the shop.\r\n\r\nWinslow was always more or less excited by a customer. But the open desk\r\nreminded him of his trouble. It did not come back to him all at once. He\r\nheard a finger-nail softly tapping on the glass, and, looking up, saw\r\nMinnie’s eyes over the blind. It seemed like retreat opening. He shut\r\nand locked the desk, and went into the little room to tea.\r\n\r\nBut he was preoccupied. Three weeks and a day. He took unusually large\r\nbites of his bread and butter, and stared hard at the little pot of jam.\r\nHe answered Minnie’s conversational advances distractedly. The shadow of\r\nHelter, Skelter, & Grab lay upon the tea-table. He was struggling with\r\nthis new idea of failure, the tangible realisation, that was taking\r\nshape and substance, condensing, as it were, out of the misty uneasiness\r\nof many days. At present it was simply one concrete fact; there were\r\nthirty-nine pounds left in the bank, and that day three weeks Messrs.\r\nHelter, Skelter, & Grab, those enterprising outfitters of young men,\r\nwould demand their eighty pounds.\r\n\r\nAfter tea there was a customer or so—little purchases: some muslin and\r\nbuckram, dress-protectors, tape, and a pair of Lisle hose. Then, knowing\r\nthat Black Care was lurking in the dusky corners of the shop, he lit the\r\nthree lamps early and set to refolding his cotton prints, the most\r\nvigorous and least meditative proceeding of which he could think. He\r\ncould see Minnie’s shadow in the other room as she moved about the\r\ntable. She was busy turning an old dress. He had a walk after supper,\r\nlooked in at the Y. M. C. A., but found no one to talk to, and finally\r\nwent to bed. Minnie was already there. And there, too, waiting for him,\r\nnudging him gently, until about midnight he was hopelessly awake, sat\r\nBlack Care.\r\n\r\nHe had had one or two nights lately in that company, but this was much\r\nworse. First came Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab, and their demand for\r\neighty pounds—an enormous sum when your original capital was only a\r\nhundred and seventy. They camped, as it were, before him, sat down and\r\nbeleaguered him. He clutched feebly at the circumambient darkness for\r\nexpedients. Suppose he had a sale, sold things for almost anything? He\r\ntried to imagine a sale miraculously successful in some unexpected\r\nmanner, and mildly profitable in spite of reductions below cost. Then\r\nBandersnatch, Limited, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 107, Broadway, joined\r\nthe siege, a long caterpillar of frontage, a battery of shop fronts,\r\nwherein things were sold at a farthing above cost. How could he fight\r\nsuch an establishment? Besides, what had he to sell? He began to review\r\nhis resources. What taking line was there to bait the sale? Then\r\nstraightway came those pieces of cretonne, yellow and black with a\r\nbluish-green flower; those discredited shirtings, prints without\r\nbuoyancy, skirmishing haberdashery, some despairful four-button gloves\r\nby an inferior maker—a hopeless crew. And that was his force against\r\nBandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, and the pitiless world behind\r\nthem. What ever had made him think a mortal would buy such things? Why\r\nhad he bought this and neglected that? He suddenly realised the\r\nintensity of his hatred for Helter, Skelter, & Grab’s salesman. Then he\r\ndrove towards an agony of self-reproach. He had spent too much on that\r\ncash desk. What real need was there of a desk? He saw his vanity of that\r\ndesk in a lurid glow of self-discovery. And the lamps? Five pounds! Then\r\nsuddenly, with what was almost physical pain, he remembered the rent.\r\n\r\nHe groaned and turned over. And there, dim in the darkness, was the\r\nhummock of Mrs. Winslow’s shoulders. That set him off in another\r\ndirection. He became acutely sensible of Minnie’s want of feeling. Here\r\nhe was, worried to death about business, and she sleeping like a little\r\nchild. He regretted having married, with that infinite bitterness that\r\nonly comes to the human heart in the small hours of the morning. That\r\nhummock of white seemed absolutely without helpfulness, a burden, a\r\nresponsibility. What fools men were to marry! Minnie’s inert repose\r\nirritated him so much that he was almost provoked to wake her up and\r\ntell her that they were “Ruined.” She would have to go back to her\r\nuncle; her uncle had always been against him; and as for his own future,\r\nWinslow was exceedingly uncertain. A shop assistant who has once set up\r\nfor himself finds the utmost difficulty in getting into a situation\r\nagain. He began to figure himself “crib-hunting” again, going from this\r\nwholesale house to that, writing innumerable letters. How he hated\r\nwriting letters! “Sir, referring to your advertisement in the ‘Christian\r\nWorld.’” He beheld an infinite vista of discomfort and disappointment,\r\nending—in a gulf.\r\n\r\nHe dressed, yawning, and went down to open the shop. He felt tired\r\nbefore the day began. As he carried the shutters in he kept asking\r\nhimself what good he was doing. The end was inevitable, whether he\r\nbothered or not. The clear daylight smote into the place and showed how\r\nold, and rough, and splintered was the floor, how shabby the second-hand\r\ncounter, how hopeless the whole enterprise. He had been dreaming these\r\npast six months of a bright little shop, of a happy couple, of a modest\r\nbut comely profit flowing in. He had suddenly awakened from his dream.\r\nThe braid that bound his decent black coat—it was a little loose—caught\r\nagainst the catch of the shop-door, and was torn loose. This suddenly\r\nturned his wretchedness to wrath. He stood quivering for a moment, then,\r\nwith a spiteful clutch, tore the braid looser, and went in to Minnie.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he said, with infinite reproach, “look here! You might look\r\nafter a chap a bit.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t see it was torn,” said Minnie.\r\n\r\n“You never do,” said Winslow, with gross injustice, “until things are\r\ntoo late.”\r\n\r\nMinnie looked suddenly at his face. “I’ll sew it now, Sid, if you like.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s have breakfast first,” said Winslow, “and do things at their\r\nproper time.”\r\n\r\nHe was preoccupied at breakfast, and Minnie watched him anxiously. His\r\nonly remark was to declare his egg a bad one. It wasn’t; it was a little\r\nflavoury—being one of those at fifteen a shilling—but quite nice. He\r\npushed it away from him, and then, having eaten a slice of bread and\r\nbutter, admitted himself in the wrong by resuming the egg.\r\n\r\n“Sid!” said Minnie, as he stood up to go into the shop again, “you’re\r\nnot well.”\r\n\r\n“I’m _well_ enough.” He looked at her as though he hated her.\r\n\r\n“Then there’s something else the matter. You aren’t angry with me, Sid,\r\nare you?—about that braid. _Do_ tell me what’s the matter. You were just\r\nlike this at tea yesterday, and at supper-time. It wasn’t the braid\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“And I’m likely to be.”\r\n\r\nShe looked interrogation. “Oh! what _is_ the matter?” she said.\r\n\r\nIt was too good a chance to miss, and he brought the evil news out with\r\ndramatic force. “Matter!” he said. “I done my best, and here we are.\r\nThat’s the matter! If I can’t pay Helter, Skelter, & Grab eighty pounds,\r\nthis day three weeks—” Pause. “We shall be sold Up! Sold Up! That’s the\r\nmatter, Min! SOLD UP!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Sid!” began Minnie.\r\n\r\nHe slammed the door. For the moment he felt relieved of at least half\r\nhis misery. He began dusting boxes that did not require dusting, and\r\nthen re-blocked a cretonne already faultlessly blocked. He was in a\r\nstate of grim wretchedness,—a martyr under the harrow of fate. At any\r\nrate, it should not be said he failed for want of industry. And how he\r\nhad planned and contrived and worked! All to this end! He felt horrible\r\ndoubts. Providence and Bandersnatch—surely they were incompatible!\r\nPerhaps he was being “tried”? That sent him off upon a new tack, a very\r\ncomforting one. That martyr pose, the gold-in-the-furnace attitude,\r\nlasted all the morning.\r\n\r\nAt dinner—“potato pie”—he looked up suddenly, and saw Minnie regarding\r\nhim. Pale she looked, and a little red about the eyes. Something caught\r\nhim suddenly with a queer effect upon his throat. All his thoughts\r\nseemed to wheel round into quite a new direction.\r\n\r\nHe pushed back his plate, and stared at her blankly. Then he got up,\r\nwent round the table to her—she staring at him. He dropped on his knees\r\nbeside her without a word. “Oh, Minnie!” he said, and suddenly she knew\r\nit was peace, and put her arms about him, as he began to sob and weep.\r\n\r\nHe cried like a little boy, slobbering on her shoulder that he was a\r\nknave to have married her and brought her to this, that he hadn’t the\r\nwits to be trusted with a penny, that it was all his fault, that he\r\n“_had_ hoped _so_”—ending in a howl. And she, crying gently herself,\r\npatting his shoulders, said, “_Ssh!_” softly to his noisy weeping, and\r\nso soothed the outbreak. Then suddenly the crazy little bell upon the\r\nshop-door began, and Winslow had to jump to his feet, and be a man\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAfter that scene they “talked it over” at tea, at supper, in bed, at\r\nevery possible interval in between, solemnly—quite inconclusively—with\r\nset faces and eyes for the most part staring in front of them—and yet\r\nwith a certain mutual comfort. “What to do I don’t know,” was Winslow’s\r\nmain proposition. Minnie tried to take a cheerful view of service—with a\r\nprobable baby. But she found she needed all her courage. And her uncle\r\nwould help her again, perhaps, just at the critical time. It didn’t do\r\nfor folks to be too proud. Besides, “something might happen,” a\r\nfavourite formula with her.\r\n\r\nOne hopeful line was to anticipate a sudden afflux of customers.\r\n“Perhaps,” said Minnie, “you might get together fifty. They know you\r\nwell enough to trust you a bit.” They debated that point. Once the\r\npossibility of Helter, Skelter, & Grab giving credit was admitted, it\r\nwas pleasant to begin sweating the acceptable minimum. For some half\r\nhour over tea the second day after Winslow’s discoveries they were quite\r\ncheerful again, laughing even at their terrific fears. Even twenty\r\npounds, to go on with, might be considered enough. Then in some\r\nmysterious way the pleasant prospect of Messrs. Helter, Skelter, & Grab\r\ntempering the wind to the shorn retailer vanished—vanished absolutely,\r\nand Winslow found himself again in the pit of despair.\r\n\r\nHe began looking about at the furniture, and wondering idly what it\r\nwould fetch. The chiffonier was good, anyhow, and there were Minnie’s\r\nold plates that her mother used to have. Then he began to think of\r\ndesperate expedients for putting off the evil day. He had heard\r\nsomewhere of Bills of Sale—there was to his ears something comfortingly\r\nsubstantial in the phrase. Then why not “Go to the Money Lenders?”\r\n\r\nOne cheering thing happened on Thursday afternoon; a little girl came in\r\nwith a pattern of “print” and he was able to match it. He had not been\r\nable to match anything out of his meagre stock before. He went in and\r\ntold Minnie. The incident is mentioned lest the reader should imagine it\r\nwas uniform despair with him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, and the next, after the discovery, Winslow opened shop\r\nlate. When one has been awake most of the night, and has no hope, what\r\n_is_ the good of getting up punctually? But as he went into the dark\r\nshop on Friday a strange event happened. He saw something lying on the\r\nfloor, something lit by the bright light that came under the ill-fitting\r\ndoor—a black oblong. He stooped and picked up an envelope with a deep\r\nmourning edge. It was addressed to his wife. Clearly a death in her\r\nfamily—perhaps her uncle. He knew the man too well to have expectations.\r\nAnd they would have to get mourning and go to the funeral. The brutal\r\ncruelty of people dying! He saw it all in a flash—he always visualised\r\nhis thoughts. Black trousers to get, black crape, black gloves,—none in\r\nstock,—the railway fares, the shop closed for the day.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid there’s bad news, Minnie,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe was kneeling before the fireplace, blowing the fire. She had her\r\nhousemaid’s gloves on and the old country sun-bonnet she wore of a\r\nmorning, to keep the dust out of her hair. She turned, saw the envelope,\r\ngave a gasp, and pressed two bloodless lips together.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid it’s uncle,” she said, holding the letter and staring with\r\neyes wide open into Winslow’s face. “_It’s a strange hand!_”\r\n\r\n“The postmark’s Hull,” said Winslow.\r\n\r\n“The postmark’s Hull.”\r\n\r\nMinnie opened the letter slowly, drew it out, hesitated, turned it over,\r\nsaw the signature. “It’s Mr. Speight!”\r\n\r\n“What does he say?” said Winslow.\r\n\r\nMinnie began to read. “_Oh!_” she screamed. She dropped the letter,\r\ncollapsed into a crouching heap, her hands covering her eyes. Winslow\r\nsnatched at it. “A most terrible accident has occurred,” he read;\r\n“Melchior’s chimney fell down yesterday evening right on the top of your\r\nuncle’s house, and every living soul was killed—your uncle, your cousin\r\nMary, Will, and Ned, and the girl—every one of them, and smashed—you\r\nwould hardly know them. I’m writing to you to break the news before you\r\nsee it in the papers—.” The letter fluttered from Winslow’s fingers. He\r\nput out his hand against the mantel to steady himself.\r\n\r\nAll of them dead! Then he saw, as in a vision, a row of seven cottages,\r\neach let at seven shillings a week, a timber yard, two villas, and the\r\nruins—still marketable—of the avuncular residence. He tried to feel a\r\nsense of loss and could not. They were sure to have been left to\r\nMinnie’s aunt. All dead! 7 × 7 × 52 ÷ 20 began insensibly to work itself\r\nout in his mind, but discipline was ever weak in his mental arithmetic;\r\nfigures kept moving from one line to another, like children playing at\r\nWiddy, Widdy Way. Was it two hundred pounds about—or one hundred pounds?\r\nPresently he picked up the letter again, and finished reading it. “You\r\nbeing the next of kin,” said Mr. Speight.\r\n\r\n“How _awful_!” said Minnie, in a horror-struck whisper, and looking up\r\nat last. Winslow stared back at her, shaking his head solemnly. There\r\nwere a thousand things running through his mind, but none that, even to\r\nhis dull sense, seemed appropriate as a remark. “It was the Lord’s\r\nwill,” he said at last.\r\n\r\n“It seems so very, very terrible,” said Minnie; “auntie, dear\r\nauntie—Ted—poor, dear uncle—”\r\n\r\n“It was the Lord’s will, Minnie,” said Winslow, with infinite feeling. A\r\nlong silence.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Minnie, very slowly, staring thoughtfully at the crackling\r\nblack paper in the grate. The fire had gone out. “Yes, perhaps it was\r\nthe Lord’s will.”\r\n\r\nThey looked gravely at one another. Each would have been terribly\r\nshocked at any mention of the property by the other. She turned to the\r\ndark fireplace and began tearing up an old newspaper slowly. Whatever\r\nour losses may be, the world’s work still waits for us. Winslow gave a\r\ndeep sigh and walked in a hushed manner towards the front door. As he\r\nopened it a flood of sunlight came streaming into the dark shadows of\r\nthe closed shop. Brandersnatch, Helter, Skelter, & Grab, had vanished\r\nout of his mind like the mists before the rising sun.\r\n\r\nPresently he was carrying in the shutters, and in the briskest way; the\r\nfire in the kitchen was crackling exhilaratingly with a little saucepan\r\nwalloping above it, for Minnie was boiling two eggs—one for herself this\r\nmorning, as well as one for him—and Minnie herself was audible, laying\r\nbreakfast with the greatest _éclat_. The blow was a sudden and terrible\r\none—but it behoves us to face such things bravely in this sad,\r\nunaccountable world. It was quite midday before either of them mentioned\r\nthe cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            LE MARI TERRIBLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“You are always so sympathetic,” she said; and added, reflectively, “and\r\none can talk of one’s troubles to you without any nonsense.”\r\n\r\nI wondered dimly if she meant that as a challenge. I helped myself to a\r\nbiscuit thing that looked neither poisonous nor sandy. “You are one of\r\nthe most puzzling human beings I ever met,” I said,—a perfectly safe\r\nremark to any woman under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Do you find me so hard to understand?” she said.\r\n\r\n“You are dreadfully complex.” I bit at the biscuit thing, and found it\r\nfull of a kind of creamy bird-lime. (I wonder why women _will_ arrange\r\nthese unpleasant surprises for me—I sickened of sweets twenty years\r\nago.)\r\n\r\n“How so?” she was saying, and smiling her most brilliant smile.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt she thought we were talking rather nicely. “Oh!” said I,\r\nand waved the cream biscuit thing. “You challenge me to dissect you.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“And that is precisely what I cannot do.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you are very satirical,” she said, with a touch of\r\ndisappointment. She is always saying that when our conversation has\r\nbecome absolutely idiotic—as it invariably does. I felt an inevitable\r\ndesire to quote bogus Latin to her. It seemed the very language for her.\r\n\r\n“Malorum fiducia pars quosque libet,” I said, in a low voice, looking\r\nmeaningly into her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” she said, colouring a little, and turned to pour hot water into\r\nthe teapot, looking very prettily at me over her arm as she did so.\r\n\r\n“That is one of the truest things that has ever been said of sympathy,”\r\nI remarked. “Don’t you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Sympathy,” she said, “is a very wonderful thing, and a very precious\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“You speak,” said I (with a cough behind my hand), “as though you knew\r\nwhat it was to be lonely.”\r\n\r\n“There is solitude even in a crowd,” she said, and looked round at the\r\nsix other people—three discreet pairs—who were in the room.\r\n\r\n“I, too,” I was beginning, but Hopdangle came with a teacup, and seemed\r\ninclined to linger. He belongs to the “Nice Boy” class, and gives\r\nhimself ridiculous airs of familiarity with grown-up people. Then the\r\nGiffens went.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I always take such an interest in your work,” she was\r\nsaying to me, when her husband(confound him!) came into the room.\r\n\r\nHe was a violent discord. He wore a short brown jacket and carpet\r\nslippers, and three of his waistcoat buttons were (as usual) undone.\r\n“Got any tea left, Millie?” he said, and came and sat down in the\r\narm-chair beside the table.\r\n\r\n“How do, Delalune?” he said to the man in the corner. “Damned hot,\r\nBellows,” he remarked to me, subsiding creakily.\r\n\r\nShe poured some more hot water into the teapot. (Why must charming\r\nmarried women always have these husbands?)\r\n\r\n“It _is_ very hot,” I said.\r\n\r\nThere was a perceptible pause. He is one of those rather adipose people,\r\nwho are not disconcerted by conversational gaps. “Are _you_, too,\r\nworking at Argon?” I said. He is some kind of chemical investigator, I\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe began at once to explain the most horribly complex things about\r\nelements to me. She gave him his tea, and rose and went and talked to\r\nthe other people about autotypes. “Yes,” I said, not hearing what he was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n“‘No’ would be more appropriate,” he said. “You are absent-minded,\r\nBellows. Not in love, I hope—at your age?”\r\n\r\nReally, I am not thirty, but a certain perceptible thinness in my hair\r\nmay account for his invariably regarding me as a contemporary. But he\r\nshould understand that nowadays the beginnings of baldness merely mark\r\nthe virile epoch. “I say, Millie,” he said, out loud and across the\r\nroom, “you haven’t been collecting Bellows here—have you?”\r\n\r\nShe looked round startled, and I saw a pained look come into her eyes.\r\n“For the bazaar?” she said. “Not yet, dear.” It seemed to me that she\r\nshot a glance of entreaty at him. Then she turned to the others again.\r\n\r\n“My wife,” he said, “has two distinctive traits. She is a born poetess\r\nand a born collector. I ought to warn you.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know,” said I, “that she rhymed.”\r\n\r\n“I was speaking more of the imaginative quality, the temperament that\r\nfinds a splendour in the grass, a glory in the flower, that clothes the\r\nwhole world in a vestiture of interpretation.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” I said. I felt she was watching us anxiously. He could not, of\r\ncourse, suspect. But I was relieved to fancy he was simply talking\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n“The magnificent figures of heroic, worshipful, and mysterious womanhood\r\nnaturally appeal to her—Cleopatra, Messalina, Beatrice, the Madonna, and\r\nso forth.”\r\n\r\n“And she is writing—”\r\n\r\n“No, she is acting. That is the real poetry of women and children. A\r\nplatonic Cleopatra of infinite variety, spotless reputation, and a large\r\nfollowing. Her make-believe is wonderful. She would use Falstaff for\r\nRomeo without a twinge, if no one else was at hand. She could exert\r\nherself to break the heart of a soldier. I assure you, Bellows—”\r\n\r\nI heard her dress rustle behind me.\r\n\r\n“I want some more tea,” he said to her. “You misunderstood me about the\r\ncollecting, Millie.”\r\n\r\n“What were you saying about Cleopatra?” she said, trying, I think, to\r\nlook sternly at him.\r\n\r\n“Scandal,” he said. “But about the collecting, Bellows—”\r\n\r\n“You must come to this bazaar,” she interrupted.\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted,” I said, boldly. “Where is it, and when?”\r\n\r\n“About this collecting,” he began.\r\n\r\n“It is in aid of that delightful orphanage at Wimblingham,” she\r\nexplained, and gave me an animated account of the charity. He emptied\r\nhis second cup of tea. “May I have a third cup?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe two girls signalled departure, and her attention was distracted.\r\n“She collects—and I will confess she does it with extraordinary\r\nskill—the surreptitious addresses—”\r\n\r\n“John,” she said over her shoulder, “I wish you would tell Miss Smithers\r\nall those interesting things about Argon.” He gulped down his third cup,\r\nand rose with the easy obedience of the trained husband. Presently she\r\nreturned to the tea-things. “Cannot I fill your cup?” she asked. “I\r\nreally hope John was not telling you his queer notions about me. He says\r\nthe most remarkable things. Quite lately he has got it into his head\r\nthat he has a formula for my character.”\r\n\r\n“I wish _I_ had,” I said, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“And he goes about explaining me to people, as though I was a mechanism.\r\n‘Scalp collector,’ I think is the favourite phrase. Did he tell you?\r\nDon’t you think it perfectly horrid of him?”\r\n\r\n“But he doesn’t understand you,” I said, not grasping his meaning quite\r\nat the minute.\r\n\r\nShe sighed.\r\n\r\n“You have,” I said, with infinite meaning, “my sincere sympathy—” I\r\nhesitated—“my whole sympathy.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you _so much_,” she said, quite as meaningly. I rose forthwith,\r\nand we clasped hands, like souls who strike a compact.\r\n\r\nYet, thinking over what he said afterwards, I was troubled by a fancy\r\nthat there was the faintest suggestion of a smile of triumph about her\r\nlips and mouth. Possibly it was only an honourable pride. I suppose he\r\nhas poisoned my mind a little. Of course, I should not like to think of\r\nmyself as one of a fortuitously selected multitude strung neatly\r\ntogether (if one may use the vulgarism) on a piece of string,—a\r\nstringful like a boy’s string of chestnuts,—nice old gentlemen, nice\r\nboys, sympathetic and humorous men of thirty, kind fellows, gifted\r\ndreamers, and dashing blades, all trailing after her. It is confoundedly\r\nbad form of him, anyhow, to guy her visitors. She certainly took it like\r\na saint. Of course, I shall see her again soon, and we shall talk to one\r\nanother about one another. Something or other cropped up and prevented\r\nmy going there on her last Tuesday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE APPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“I must get rid of it,” said the man in the corner of the carriage,\r\nabruptly breaking the silence.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly. He had been lost in the\r\nrapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to his\r\nportmanteau handles—the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained\r\npedagogic position—in the rapt appreciation of the college cap and the\r\npleasant anticipations it excited. For Mr. Hinchcliff had just\r\nmatriculated at London University, and was going to be junior assistant\r\nat the Holmwood Grammar School—a very enviable position. He stared\r\nacross the carriage at his fellow-traveller.\r\n\r\n“Why not give it away?” said this person. “Give it away! Why not?”\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, dark, sunburnt man with a pale face. His arms were folded\r\ntightly, and his feet were on the seat in front of him. He was pulling\r\nat a lank, black moustache. He stared hard at his toes.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” he said.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff coughed.\r\n\r\nThe stranger lifted his eyes—they were curious, dark grey eyes—and\r\nstared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff for the best part of a minute, perhaps.\r\nHis expression grew to interest.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said slowly. “Why not? And end it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite follow you, I’m afraid,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, with\r\nanother cough.\r\n\r\n“You don’t quite follow me?” said the stranger, quite mechanically, his\r\nsingular eyes wandering from Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its\r\nostentatiously displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff’s downy face.\r\n\r\n“You’re so abrupt, you know,” apologised Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t I?” said the stranger, following his thoughts. “You are a\r\nstudent?” he said, addressing Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n“I am—by Correspondence—of the London University,” said Mr. Hinchcliff,\r\nwith irrepressible pride, and feeling nervously at his tie.\r\n\r\n“In pursuit of knowledge,” said the stranger, and suddenly took his feet\r\noff the seat, put his fist on his knees, and stared at Mr. Hinchcliff as\r\nthough he had never seen a student before. “Yes,” he said, and flung out\r\nan index finger. Then he rose, took a bag from the hat-rack, and\r\nunlocked it. Quite silently, he drew out something round and wrapped in\r\na quantity of silver-paper, and unfolded this carefully. He held it out\r\ntowards Mr. Hinchcliff,—a small, very smooth, golden-yellow fruit.\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff’s eyes and mouth were open. He did not offer to take this\r\nobject—if he was intended to take it.\r\n\r\n“That,” said this fantastic stranger, speaking very slowly, “is the\r\nApple of the Tree of Knowledge. Look at it—small, and bright, and\r\nwonderful—Knowledge—and I am going to give it to you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hinchcliff’s mind worked painfully for a minute, and then the\r\nsufficient explanation, “Mad!” flashed across his brain, and illuminated\r\nthe whole situation. One humoured madmen. He put his head a little on\r\none side.\r\n\r\n“The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!” said Mr. Hinchcliff,\r\nregarding it with a finely assumed air of interest, and then looking at\r\nthe interlocutor. “But don’t you want to eat it yourself? And\r\nbesides—how did you come by it?”\r\n\r\n“It never fades. I have had it now three months. And it is ever bright\r\nand smooth and ripe and desirable, as you see it.” He laid his hand on\r\nhis knee and regarded the fruit musingly. Then he began to wrap it again\r\nin the papers, as though he had abandoned his intention of giving it\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“But how did you come by it?” said Mr. Hinchcliff, who had his\r\nargumentative side. “And how do you know that it _is_ the Fruit of the\r\nTree?”\r\n\r\n“I bought this fruit,” said the stranger, “three months ago—for a drink\r\nof water and a crust of bread. The man who gave it to me—because I kept\r\nthe life in him—was an Armenian. Armenia! that wonderful country, the\r\nfirst of all countries, where the ark of the Flood remains to this day,\r\nburied in the glaciers of Mount Ararat. This man, I say, fleeing with\r\nothers from the Kurds who had come upon them, went up into desolate\r\nplaces among the mountains—places beyond the common knowledge of men.\r\nAnd fleeing from imminent pursuit, they came to a slope high among the\r\nmountain-peaks, green with a grass like knife-blades, that cut and\r\nslashed most pitilessly at any one who went into it. The Kurds were\r\nclose behind, and there was nothing for it but to plunge in, and the\r\nworst of it was that the paths they made through it at the price of\r\ntheir blood served for the Kurds to follow. Every one of the fugitives\r\nwas killed save this Armenian and another. He heard the screams and\r\ncries of his friends, and the swish of the grass about those who were\r\npursuing them—it was tall grass rising overhead. And then a shouting and\r\nanswers, and when presently he paused, everything was still. He pushed\r\nout again, not understanding, cut and bleeding, until he came out on a\r\nsteep slope of rocks below a precipice, and then he saw the grass was\r\nall on fire, and the smoke of it rose like a veil between him and his\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\nThe stranger paused. “Yes?” said Mr. Hinchcliff. “Yes?”\r\n\r\n“There he was, all torn and bloody from the knife-blades of the grass,\r\nthe rocks blazing under the afternoon sun,—the sky molten brass,—and the\r\nsmoke of the fire driving towards him. He dared not stay there. Death he\r\ndid not mind, but torture! Far away beyond the smoke he heard shouts and\r\ncries. Women screaming. So he went clambering up a gorge in the\r\nrocks—everywhere were bushes with dry branches that stuck out like\r\nthorns among the leaves—until he clambered over the brow of a ridge that\r\nhid him. And then he met his companion, a shepherd, who had also\r\nescaped. And, counting cold and famine and thirst as nothing against the\r\nKurds, they went on into the heights, and among the snow and ice. They\r\nwandered three whole days.\r\n\r\n“The third day came the vision. I suppose hungry men often do see\r\nvisions, but then there is this fruit.” He lifted the wrapped globe in\r\nhis hand. “And I have heard it, too, from other mountaineers who have\r\nknown something of the legend. It was in the evening time, when the\r\nstars were increasing, that they came down a slope of polished rock into\r\na huge, dark valley all set about with strange, contorted trees, and in\r\nthese trees hung little globes like glow-worm spheres, strange, round,\r\nyellow lights.\r\n\r\n“Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many miles away, far down it,\r\nwith a golden flame marching slowly athwart it, that made the stunted\r\ntrees against it black as night, and turned the slopes all about them\r\nand their figures to the likeness of fiery gold. And at the vision they,\r\nknowing the legends of the mountains, instantly knew that it was Eden\r\nthey saw, or the sentinel of Eden, and they fell upon their faces like\r\nmen struck dead.\r\n\r\n“When they dared to look again, the valley was dark for a space, and\r\nthen the light came again—returning, a burning amber.\r\n\r\n“At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and with a shout began to run\r\ndown towards the light; but the other man was too fearful to follow him.\r\nHe stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his companion recede\r\ntowards the marching glare. And hardly had the shepherd set out when\r\nthere came a noise like thunder, the beating of invisible wings hurrying\r\nup the valley, and a great and terrible fear; and at that the man who\r\ngave me the fruit turned—if he might still escape. And hurrying headlong\r\nup the slope again, with that tumult sweeping after him, he stumbled\r\nagainst one of these stunted bushes, and a ripe fruit came off it into\r\nhis hand. This fruit. Forthwith, the wings and the thunder rolled all\r\nabout him. He fell and fainted, and when he came to his senses, he was\r\nback among the blackened ruins of his own village, and I and the others\r\nwere attending to the wounded. A vision? But the golden fruit of the\r\ntree was still clutched in his hand. There were others there who knew\r\nthe legend, knew what that strange fruit might be.” He paused. “And this\r\nis it,” he said.\r\n\r\nIt was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third-class carriage\r\non a Sussex railway. It was as if the real was a mere veil to the\r\nfantastic, and here was the fantastic poking through. “Is it?” was all\r\nMr. Hinchcliff could say.\r\n\r\n“The legend,” said the stranger, “tells that those thickets of dwarfed\r\ntrees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that Adam carried\r\nin his hand when he and Eve were driven forth. He felt something in his\r\nhand, saw the half-eaten apple, and flung it petulantly aside. And there\r\nthey grow, in that desolate valley, girdled round with the everlasting\r\nsnows; and there the fiery swords keep ward against the Judgment Day.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought these things were—” Mr. Hinchcliff\r\npaused—“fables—parables rather. Do you mean to tell me that there in\r\nArmenia—”\r\n\r\nThe stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his open\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“But you don’t know,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, “that that _is_ the fruit of\r\nthe Tree of Knowledge. The man may have had—a sort of mirage, say.\r\nSuppose—”\r\n\r\n“Look at it,” said the stranger.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really an apple, Mr.\r\nHinchcliff saw, and a curious glowing golden colour, almost as though\r\nlight itself was wrought into its substance. As he looked at it, he\r\nbegan to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains, the\r\nguarding swords of fire, the strange antiquities of the story he had\r\njust heard. He rubbed a knuckle into his eye. “But—” said he.\r\n\r\n“It has kept like that, smooth and full, three months. Longer than that\r\nit is now by some days. No drying, no withering, no decay.”\r\n\r\n“And you yourself,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, “really believe that—”\r\n\r\n“Is the Forbidden Fruit.”\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the earnestness of the man’s manner and his\r\nperfect sanity. “The Fruit of Knowledge,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Suppose it was?” said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a pause, still staring at\r\nit. “But after all,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, “it’s not my kind of\r\nknowledge—not the sort of knowledge. I mean, Adam and Eve have eaten it\r\nalready.”\r\n\r\n“We inherit their sins—not their knowledge,” said the stranger. “That\r\nwould make it all clear and bright again. We should see into everything,\r\nthrough everything, into the deepest meaning of everything—”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you eat it, then?” said Mr. Hinchcliff, with an inspiration.\r\n\r\n“I took it intending to eat it,” said the stranger. “Man has fallen.\r\nMerely to eat again could scarcely—”\r\n\r\n“Knowledge is power,” said Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\n“But is it happiness? I am older than you—more than twice as old. Time\r\nafter time I have held this in my hand, and my heart has failed me at\r\nthe thought of all that one might know, that terrible lucidity—Suppose\r\nsuddenly all the world became pitilessly clear?”\r\n\r\n“That, I think, would be a great advantage,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, “on\r\nthe whole.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of every one about you, into\r\ntheir most secret recesses—people you loved, whose love you valued?”\r\n\r\n“You’d soon find out the humbugs,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, greatly struck\r\nby the idea.\r\n\r\n“And worse—to know yourself, bare of your most intimate illusions. To\r\nsee yourself in your place. All that your lusts and weaknesses prevented\r\nyour doing. No merciful perspective.”\r\n\r\n“That might be an excellent thing too. ‘Know thyself,’ you know.”\r\n\r\n“You are young,” said the stranger.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t care to eat it, and it bothers you, why don’t you throw it\r\naway?”\r\n\r\n“There again, perhaps, you will not understand me. To me, how could one\r\nthrow away a thing like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one has it, one\r\nis bound. But, on the other hand, to _give_ it away! To give it away to\r\nsome one who thirsted after knowledge, who found no terror in the\r\nthought of that clear perception—”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Mr. Hinchcliff, thoughtfully, “it might be some sort\r\nof poisonous fruit.”\r\n\r\nAnd then his eye caught something motionless, the end of a white board\r\nblack-lettered outside the carriage-window. “—MWOOD,” he saw. He started\r\nconvulsively. “Gracious!” said Mr. Hinchcliff. “Holmwood!”—and the\r\npractical present blotted out the mystic realisations that had been\r\nstealing upon him.\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was opening the carriage-door, portmanteau in hand.\r\nThe guard was already fluttering his green flag. Mr. Hinchcliff jumped\r\nout. “Here!” said a voice behind him, and he saw the dark eyes of the\r\nstranger shining and the golden fruit, bright and bare, held out of the\r\nopen carriage-door. He took it instinctively, the train was already\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\n“_No!_” shouted the stranger, and made a snatch at it as if to take it\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Stand away,” cried a country porter, thrusting forward to close the\r\ndoor. The stranger shouted something Mr. Hinchcliff did not catch, head\r\nand arm thrust excitedly out of the window, and then the shadow of the\r\nbridge fell on him, and in a trice he was hidden. Mr. Hinchcliff stood\r\nastonished, staring at the end of the last waggon receding round the\r\nbend, and with the wonderful fruit in his hand. For the fraction of a\r\nminute his mind was confused, and then he became aware that two or three\r\npeople on the platform were regarding him with interest. Was he not the\r\nnew Grammar School master making his début? It occurred to him that, so\r\nfar as they could tell, the fruit might very well be the naïve\r\nrefreshment of an orange. He flushed at the thought, and thrust the\r\nfruit into his side pocket, where it bulged undesirably. But there was\r\nno help for it, so he went towards them, awkwardly concealing his sense\r\nof awkwardness, to ask the way to the Grammar School, and the means of\r\ngetting his portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform\r\nthither. Of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow!\r\n\r\nHis luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence, he found, and he\r\ncould precede it on foot He fancied an ironical note in the voices. He\r\nwas painfully aware of his contour.\r\n\r\nThe curious earnestness of the man in the train, and the glamour of the\r\nstory he told, had, for a time, diverted the current of Mr. Hinchcliff’s\r\nthoughts. It drove like a mist before his immediate concerns. Fires that\r\nwent to and fro! But the preoccupation of his new position, and the\r\nimpression he was to produce upon Holmwood generally, and the school\r\npeople in particular, returned upon him with reinvigorating power before\r\nhe left the station and cleared his mental atmosphere. But it is\r\nextraordinary what an inconvenient thing the addition of a soft and\r\nrather brightly-golden fruit, not three inches in diameter, prove to a\r\nsensitive youth on his best appearance. In the pocket of his black\r\njacket it bulged dreadfully, spoilt the lines altogether. He passed a\r\nlittle old lady in black, and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence\r\nat once. He was wearing one glove and carrying the other, together with\r\nhis stick, so that to bear the fruit openly was impossible. In one\r\nplace, where the road into the town seemed suitably secluded, he took\r\nhis encumbrance out of his pocket and tried it in his hat. It was just\r\ntoo large, the hat wobbled ludicrously, and just as he was taking it out\r\nagain, a butcher’s boy came driving round the corner.\r\n\r\n“Confound it!” said Mr. Hinchcliff.\r\n\r\nHe would have eaten the thing, and attained omniscience there and then,\r\nbut it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a juicy fruit—and\r\nit certainly felt juicy. If one of the boys should come by, it might do\r\nhim a serious injury with his discipline so to be seen. And the juice\r\nmight make his face sticky and get upon his cuffs—or it might be an acid\r\njuice as potent as lemon, and take all the colour out of his clothes.\r\n\r\nThen round a bend in the lane came two pleasant, sunlit, girlish\r\nfigures. They were walking slowly towards the town and chattering—at any\r\nmoment they might look round and see a hot-faced young man behind them\r\ncarrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato! They would be sure to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“_Hang!_” said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift jerk sent the\r\nencumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted\r\non the road. As it vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted\r\nscarcely a moment. He adjusted the stick and glove in his hand, and\r\nwalked on, erect and self-conscious, to pass the girls.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff had a dream, and saw the\r\nvalley, and the flaming swords, and the contorted trees, and knew that\r\nit really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that he had thrown\r\nregardlessly away. And he awoke very unhappy.\r\n\r\nIn the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards it returned and\r\ntroubled him; never, however, when he was happy or busily occupied. At\r\nlast, one moonlight night about eleven, when all Holmwood was quiet, his\r\nregrets returned with redoubled force, and therewith an impulse to\r\nadventure. He slipped out of the house and over the playground wall,\r\nwent through the silent town to Station Lane, and climbed into the\r\norchard where he had thrown the fruit. But nothing was to be found of it\r\nthere among the dewy grass and the faint intangible globes of dandelion\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE SAD STORY OF A DRAMATIC CRITIC\r\n\r\n\r\nI was—you shall hear immediately why I am not now—Egbert Craddock\r\nCummins. The name remains. I am still (Heaven help me!) Dramatic Critic\r\nto the “Fiery Cross.” What I shall be in a little while I do not know. I\r\nwrite in great trouble and confusion of mind. I will do what I can to\r\nmake myself clear in the face of terrible difficulties. You must bear\r\nwith me a little. When a man is rapidly losing his own identity, he\r\nnaturally finds a difficulty in expressing himself. I will make it\r\nperfectly plain in a minute, when once I get my grip upon the story. Let\r\nme see—where _am_ I? I wish I knew. Ah, I have it! Dead self! Egbert\r\nCraddock Cummins!\r\n\r\nIn the past I should have disliked writing anything quite so full of “I”\r\nas this story must be. It is full of “I’s” before and behind, like the\r\nbeast in Revelation—the one with a head like a calf, I am afraid. But my\r\ntastes have changed since I became a Dramatic Critic and studied the\r\nmasters—G.R.S., G.B.S., G.A.S., and the others. Everything has changed\r\nsince then. At least the story is about myself—so that there is some\r\nexcuse for me. And it is really not egotism, because, as I say, since\r\nthose days my identity has undergone an entire alteration.\r\n\r\nThat past!—I was—in those days—rather a nice fellow, rather shy—taste\r\nfor grey in my clothes, weedy little moustache, face “interesting,”\r\nslight stutter which I had caught in early life from a schoolfellow.\r\nEngaged to a very nice girl, named Delia. Fairly new, she\r\nwas—cigarettes—liked me because I was human and original. Considered I\r\nwas like Lamb—on the strength of the stutter, I believe. Father, an\r\neminent authority on postage stamps. She read a great deal in the\r\nBritish Museum. (A perfect pairing ground for literary people, that\r\nBritish Museum—you should read George Egerton and Justin Huntly M’Carthy\r\nand Gissing and the rest of them.) We loved in our intellectual way, and\r\nshared the brightest hopes. (All gone now.) And her father liked me\r\nbecause I seemed honestly eager to hear about stamps. She had no mother.\r\nIndeed, I had the happiest prospects a young man could have. I never\r\nwent to the theatres in those days. My Aunt Charlotte before she died\r\nhad told me not to.\r\n\r\nThen Barnaby, the editor of the “Fiery Cross,” made me—in spite of my\r\nspasmodic efforts to escape—Dramatic Critic. He is a fine, healthy man,\r\nBarnaby, with an enormous head of frizzy black hair and a convincing\r\nmanner; and he caught me on the staircase going to see Wembly. He had\r\nbeen dining, and was more than usually buoyant. “Hullo, Cummins!” he\r\nsaid. “The very man I want!” He caught me by the shoulder or the collar\r\nor something, ran me up the little passage, and flung me over the\r\nwaste-paper basket into the arm-chair in his office. “Pray be seated,”\r\nhe said, as he did so. Then he ran across the room and came back with\r\nsome pink and yellow tickets and pushed them into my hand. “Opera\r\nComique,” he said, “Thursday; Friday, the Surrey; Saturday, the\r\nFrivolity. That’s all, I think.”\r\n\r\n“But—” I began.\r\n\r\n“Glad you’re free,” he said, snatching some proofs off the desk and\r\nbeginning to read.\r\n\r\n“I don’t quite understand,” I said.\r\n\r\n“_Eigh?_” he said, at the top of his voice, as though he thought I had\r\ngone, and was startled at my remark.\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to criticise these plays?”\r\n\r\n“Do something with ’em— Did you think it was a treat?”\r\n\r\n“But I can’t.”\r\n\r\n“Did you call me a fool?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve never been to a theatre in my life.”\r\n\r\n“Virgin soil.”\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know anything about it, you know.”\r\n\r\n“That’s just it. New view. No habits. No _clichés_ in stock. Ours is a\r\nlive paper, not a bag of tricks. None of your clockwork, professional\r\njournalism in this office. And I can rely on your integrity—”\r\n\r\n“But I’ve conscientious scruples—”\r\n\r\nHe caught me up suddenly and put me outside his door. “Go and talk to\r\nWembly about that,” he said. “He’ll explain.”\r\n\r\nAs I stood perplexed, he opened the door again, said, “I forgot this,”\r\nthrust a fourth ticket into my hand (it was for that night—in twenty\r\nminutes’ time), and slammed the door upon me. His expression was quite\r\ncalm, but I caught his eye.\r\n\r\nI hate arguments. I decided that I would take his hint and become (to my\r\nown destruction) a Dramatic Critic. I walked slowly down the passage to\r\nWembly. That Barnaby has a remarkably persuasive way. He has made few\r\nsuggestions during our very pleasant intercourse of four years that he\r\nhas not ultimately won me round to adopting. It may be, of course, that\r\nI am of a yielding disposition; certainly I am too apt to take my colour\r\nfrom my circumstances. It is, indeed, to my unfortunate susceptibility\r\nto vivid impressions that all my misfortunes are due. I have already\r\nalluded to the slight stammer I had acquired from a schoolfellow in my\r\nyouth. However, this is a digression—I went home in a cab to dress.\r\n\r\nI will not trouble the reader with my thoughts about the first-night\r\naudience, strange assembly as it is,—those I reserve for my Memoirs,—nor\r\nthe humiliating story of how I got lost during the _entr’acte_ in a lot\r\nof red plush passages, and saw the third act from the gallery. The only\r\npoint upon which I wish to lay stress was the remarkable effect of the\r\nacting upon me. You must remember I had lived a quiet and retired life,\r\nand had never been to the theatre before, and that I am extremely\r\nsensitive to vivid impressions. At the risk of repetition I must insist\r\nupon these points.\r\n\r\nThe first effect was a profound amazement, not untinctured by alarm. The\r\nphenomenal unnaturalness of acting is a thing discounted in the minds of\r\nmost people by early visits to the theatre. They get used to the\r\nfantastic gestures, the flamboyant emotions, the weird mouthings,\r\nmelodious snortings, agonising yelps, lip-gnawings, glaring horrors, and\r\nother emotional symbolism of the stage. It becomes at last a mere\r\ndeaf-and-dumb language to them, which they read intelligently _pari\r\npassu_ with the hearing of the dialogue. But all this was new to me. The\r\nthing was called a modern comedy; the people were supposed to be English\r\nand were dressed like fashionable Americans of the current epoch, and I\r\nfell into the natural error of supposing that the actors were trying to\r\nrepresent human beings. I looked round on my first-night audience with a\r\nkind of wonder, discovered—as all new Dramatic Critics do—that it rested\r\nwith me to reform the Drama, and, after a supper choked with emotion,\r\nwent off to the office to write a column, piebald with “new paragraphs”\r\n(as all my stuff is—it fills out so) and purple with indignation.\r\nBarnaby was delighted.\r\n\r\nBut I could not sleep that night. I dreamt of actors,—actors glaring,\r\nactors smiting their chests, actors flinging out a handful of extended\r\nfingers, actors smiling bitterly, laughing despairingly, falling\r\nhopelessly, dying idiotically. I got up at eleven with a slight\r\nheadache, read my notice in the “Fiery Cross,” breakfasted, and went\r\nback to my room to shave. (It’s my habit to do so.) Then an odd thing\r\nhappened. I could not find my razor. Suddenly it occurred to me that I\r\nhad not unpacked it the day before.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said I, in front of the looking-glass. Then “Hullo!”\r\n\r\nQuite involuntarily, when I had thought of my portmanteau, I had flung\r\nup the left arm (fingers fully extended) and clutched at my diaphragm\r\nwith my right hand. I am an acutely self-conscious man at all times. The\r\ngesture struck me as absolutely novel for me. I repeated it, for my own\r\nsatisfaction. “Odd!” Then (rather puzzled) I turned to my portmanteau.\r\n\r\nAfter shaving, my mind reverted to the acting I had seen, and I\r\nentertained myself before the cheval glass with some imitations of\r\nJafferay’s more exaggerated gestures. “Really, one might think it a\r\ndisease,”—I said,—“Stage-Walkitis!” (There’s many a truth spoken in\r\njest.) Then, if I remember rightly, I went off to see Wembly, and\r\nafterwards lunched at the British Museum with Delia. We actually spoke\r\nabout our prospects, in the light of my new appointment.\r\n\r\nBut that appointment was the beginning of my downfall. From that day I\r\nnecessarily became a persistent theatre-goer, and almost insensibly I\r\nbegan to change. The next thing I noticed after the gesture about the\r\nrazor, was to catch myself bowing ineffably when I met Delia, and\r\nstooping in an old-fashioned, courtly way over her hand. Directly I\r\ncaught myself, I straightened myself up and became very uncomfortable. I\r\nremember she looked at me curiously. Then, in the office, I found myself\r\ndoing “nervous business,” fingers on teeth, when Barnaby asked me a\r\nquestion I could not very well answer. Then, in some trifling difference\r\nwith Delia, I clasped my hand to my brow. And I pranced through my\r\nsocial transactions at times singularly like an actor! I tried not to—no\r\none could be more keenly alive to the arrant absurdity of the histrionic\r\nbearing. And I did!\r\n\r\nIt began to dawn on me what it all meant. The acting, I saw, was too\r\nmuch for my delicatelystrung nervous system. I have always, I know, been\r\ntoo amenable to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after night\r\nof concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation\r\nof the English stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage. I\r\nwas giving way to the infection of sympathetic imitation. Night after\r\nnight my plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing\r\ngesture, some new emotional exaggeration—and retained it. A kind of\r\ntheatrical veneer threatened to plate over and obliterate my private\r\nindividuality altogether. I saw myself in a kind of vision. Sitting by\r\nmyself one night, my new self seemed to me to glide, posing and\r\ngesticulating, across the room. He clutched his throat, he opened his\r\nfingers, he opened his legs in walking like a high-class marionette. He\r\nwent from attitude to attitude. He might have been clockwork. Directly\r\nafter this I made an ineffectual attempt to resign my theatrical work.\r\nBut Barnaby persisted in talking about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the\r\ntime I was with him, and I could get no opportunity of saying what I\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nAnd then Delia’s manner began to change towards me. The ease of our\r\nintercourse vanished. I felt she was learning to dislike me. I grinned,\r\nand capered, and scowled, and posed at her in a thousand ways, and\r\nknew—with what a voiceless agony!—that I did it all the time. I tried to\r\nresign again; and Barnaby talked about “X” and “Z” and “Y” in the “New\r\nReview,” and gave me a strong cigar to smoke, and so routed me. And then\r\nI walked up the Assyrian Gallery in the manner of Irving to meet Delia,\r\nand so precipitated the crisis.\r\n\r\n“Ah!—_Dear!_” I said, with more sprightliness and emotion in my voice\r\nthan had ever been in all my life before I became (to my own undoing) a\r\nDramatic Critic.\r\n\r\nShe held out her hand rather coldly, scrutinising my face as she did so.\r\nI prepared, with a new-won grace, to walk by her side.\r\n\r\n“Egbert,” she said, standing still, and thought. Then she looked at me.\r\n\r\nI said nothing. I felt what was coming. I tried to be the old Egbert\r\nCraddock Cummins of shambling gait and stammering sincerity, whom she\r\nloved; but I felt, even as I did so, that I was a new thing, a thing of\r\nsurging emotions and mysterious fixity—like no human being that ever\r\nlived, except upon the stage. “Egbert,” she said, “you are not\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Involuntarily I clutched my diaphragm and averted my head (as is\r\nthe way with them).\r\n\r\n“There!” she said.\r\n\r\n“_What do you mean?_” I said, whispering in vocal italics,—you know how\r\nthey do it,—turning on her, perplexity on face, right hand down, left on\r\nbrow. I knew quite well what she meant. I knew quite well the dramatic\r\nunreality of my behaviour. But I struggled against it in vain. “What do\r\nyou mean?” I said, and, in a kind of hoarse whisper, “I don’t\r\nunderstand!”\r\n\r\nShe really looked as though she disliked me. “What do you keep on posing\r\nfor?” she said. “I don’t like it. You didn’t use to.”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t use to!” I said slowly, repeating this twice. I glared up and\r\ndown the gallery, with short, sharp glances. “We are alone,” I said\r\nswiftly. “_Listen!_” I poked my forefinger towards her, and glared at\r\nher. “I am under a curse.”\r\n\r\nI saw her hand tighten upon her sunshade. “You are under some bad\r\ninfluence or other,” said Delia. “You should give it up. I never knew\r\nany one change as you have done.”\r\n\r\n“Delia!” I said, lapsing into the pathetic. “Pity me. Augh! Delia!\r\n_Pit_—y me!”\r\n\r\nShe eyed me critically. “_Why_ you keep playing the fool like this I\r\ndon’t know,” she said. “Anyhow, I really cannot go about with a man who\r\nbehaves as you do. You made us both ridiculous on Wednesday. Frankly, I\r\ndislike you, as you are now. I met you here to tell you so—as it’s about\r\nthe only place where we can be sure of being alone together—”\r\n\r\n“Delia!” said I, with intensity, knuckles of clenched hands white. “You\r\ndon’t mean—”\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Delia. “A woman’s lot is sad enough at the best of times.\r\nBut with you—”\r\n\r\nI clapped my hand on my brow.\r\n\r\n“So, good-bye,” said Delia, without emotion.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Delia!” I said. “Not _this_?”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr. Cummins,” she said.\r\n\r\nBy a violent effort I controlled myself and touched her hand. I tried to\r\nsay some word of explanation to her. She looked into my working face and\r\nwinced. “I _must_ do it,” she said hopelessly. Then she turned from me\r\nand began walking rapidly down the gallery.\r\n\r\nHeavens! How the human agony cried within me! I loved Delia. But nothing\r\nfound expression—I was already too deeply crusted with my acquired self.\r\n\r\n“Good-baye!” I said at last, watching her retreating figure. How I hated\r\nmyself for doing it! After she had vanished, I repeated in a dreamy way,\r\n“Good-baye!” looking hopelessly round me. Then, with a kind of\r\nheart-broken cry, I shook my clenched fists in the air, staggered to the\r\npedestal of a winged figure, buried my face in my arms, and made my\r\nshoulders heave. Something within me said, “Ass!” as I did so. (I had\r\nthe greatest difficulty in persuading the Museum policeman, who was\r\nattracted by my cry of agony, that I was not intoxicated, but merely\r\nsuffering from a transient indisposition.)\r\n\r\nBut even this great sorrow has not availed to save me from my fate. I\r\nsee it, every one sees it; I grow more “theatrical” every day. And no\r\none could be more painfully aware of the pungent silliness of theatrical\r\nways. The quiet, nervous, but pleasing E. C. Cummins vanishes. I cannot\r\nsave him. I am driven like a dead leaf before the winds of March. My\r\ntailor even enters into the spirit of my disorder. He has a peculiar\r\nsense of what is fitting. I tried to get a dull grey suit from him this\r\nspring, and he foisted a brilliant blue upon me, and I see he has put\r\nbraid down the sides of my new dress trousers. My hairdresser insists\r\nupon giving me a “wave.”\r\n\r\nI am beginning to associate with actors. I detest them, but it is only\r\nin their company that I can feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their\r\ntalk infects me. I notice a growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to\r\ndashes and pauses in my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes.\r\nBarnaby has remarked it too. I offended Wembly by calling him “Dear Boy”\r\nyesterday. I dread the end, but I cannot escape from it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I am being obliterated. Living a grey, retired life all\r\nmy youth, I came to the theatre a delicate sketch of a man, a thing of\r\ntints and faint lines. Their gorgeous colouring has effaced me\r\naltogether. People forget how much mode of expression, method of\r\nmovement, are a matter of contagion. I have heard of stage-struck\r\npeople before, and thought it a figure of speech. I spoke of it\r\njestingly, as a disease. It is no jest. It _is_ a disease. And I have\r\ngot it bad! Deep down within me I protest against the wrong done to my\r\npersonality—unavailingly. For three hours or more a week I have to go\r\nand concentrate my attention on some fresh play, and the suggestions\r\nof the drama strengthen their awful hold upon me. My manners grow so\r\nflamboyant, my passions so professional, that I doubt, as I said at\r\nthe outset, whether it is really myself that behaves in such a manner.\r\nI feel merely the core to this dramatic casing, that grows thicker and\r\npresses upon me—me and mine. I feel like King John’s abbot in his cope\r\nof lead.\r\n\r\nI doubt, indeed, whether I should not abandon the struggle\r\naltogether—leave this sad world of ordinary life for which I am so\r\nill-fitted, abandon the name of Cummins for some professional pseudonym,\r\ncomplete my self-effacement, and—a thing of tricks and tatters, of\r\nposing and pretence—go upon the stage. It seems my only resort—“to hold\r\nthe mirror up to Nature.” For in the ordinary life, I will confess, no\r\none now seems to regard me as both sane and sober. Only upon the stage,\r\nI feel convinced, will people take me seriously. That will be the end of\r\nit. I _know_ that will be the end of it. And yet—I will frankly\r\nconfess—all that marks off your actor from your common man—I _detest_. I\r\nam still largely of my Aunt Charlotte’s opinion, that play-acting is\r\nunworthy of a pure-minded man’s attention, much more participation. Even\r\nnow I would resign my dramatic criticism and try a rest. Only I can’t\r\nget hold of Barnaby. Letters of resignation he never notices. He says it\r\nis against the etiquette of journalism to write to your Editor. And when\r\nI go to see him, he gives me another big cigar and some strong whiskey\r\nand soda, and then something always turns up to prevent my explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE JILTING OF JANE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I sit writing in my study, I can hear our Jane bumping her way\r\ndownstairs with a brush and dustpan. She used in the old days to sing\r\nhymn tunes, or the British national song for the time being, to these\r\ninstruments; but latterly she has been silent and even careful over her\r\nwork. Time was when I prayed with fervour for such silence, and my wife\r\nwith sighs for such care, but now they have come we are not so glad as\r\nwe might have anticipated we should be. Indeed, I would rejoice\r\nsecretly, though it may be unmanly weakness to admit it, even to hear\r\nJane sing “Daisy,” or by the fracture of any plate but one of Euphemia’s\r\nbest green ones, to learn that the period of brooding has come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nYet how we longed to hear the last of Jane’s young man before we heard\r\nthe last of him! Jane was always very free with her conversation to my\r\nwife, and discoursed admirably in the kitchen on a variety of topics—so\r\nwell, indeed, that I sometimes left my study door open—our house is a\r\nsmall one—to partake of it. But after William came, it was always\r\nWilliam, nothing but William; William this and William that; and when we\r\nthought William was worked out and exhausted altogether, then William\r\nall over again. The engagement lasted altogether three years; yet how\r\nshe got introduced to William, and so became thus saturated with him,\r\nwas always a secret. For my part, I believe it was at the street corner\r\nwhere the Rev. Barnabas Baux used to hold an open-air service after\r\nevensong on Sundays. Young Cupids were wont to flit like moths round the\r\nparaffin flare of that centre of High Church hymn-singing. I fancy she\r\nstood singing hymns there, out of memory and her imagination, instead of\r\ncoming home to get supper, and William came up beside her and said,\r\n“Hello!” “Hello yourself!” she said; and, etiquette being satisfied,\r\nthey proceeded to talk together.\r\n\r\nAs Euphemia has a reprehensible way of letting her servants talk to her,\r\nshe soon heard of him. “He is _such_ a respectable young man, ma’am,”\r\nsaid Jane, “you don’t know.” Ignoring the slur cast on her acquaintance,\r\nmy wife inquired further about this William.\r\n\r\n“He is second porter at Maynard’s, the draper’s,” said Jane, “and gets\r\neighteen shillings—nearly a pound—a week, m’m; and when the head porter\r\nleaves he will be head porter. His relatives are quite superior people,\r\nm’m. Not labouring people at all. His father was a greengrosher, m’m,\r\nand had a chumor, and he was bankrup’ twice. And one of his sisters is\r\nin a Home for the Dying. It will be a very good match for me, m’m,” said\r\nJane, “me being an orphan girl.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are engaged to him?” asked my wife.\r\n\r\n“Not engaged, ma’am; but he is saving money to buy a ring—hammyfist.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Jane, when you are properly engaged to him you may ask him round\r\nhere on Sunday afternoons, and have tea with him in the kitchen.” For my\r\nEuphemia has a motherly conception of her duty towards her\r\nmaid-servants. And presently the amethystine ring was being worn about\r\nthe house, even with ostentation, and Jane developed a new way of\r\nbringing in the joint, so that this gage was evident The elder Miss\r\nMaitland was aggrieved by it, and told my wife that servants ought not\r\nto wear rings. But my wife looked it up in “Enquire Within” and “Mrs.\r\nMotherly’s Book of Household Management,” and found no prohibition. So\r\nJane remained with this happiness added to her love.\r\n\r\nThe treasure of Jane’s heart appeared to me to be what respectable\r\npeople call a very deserving young man. “William, ma’am,” said Jane, one\r\nday suddenly, with ill-concealed complacency, as she counted out the\r\nbeer bottles, “William, ma’am, is a teetotaller. Yes, m’m; and he don’t\r\nsmoke. Smoking, ma’am,” said Jane, as one who reads the heart, “_do_\r\nmake such a dust about. Beside the waste of money. _And_ the smell.\r\nHowever, I suppose it’s necessary to some.”\r\n\r\nPossibly it dawned on Jane that she was reflecting a little severely\r\nupon Euphemia’s comparative ill-fortune; and she added kindly, “I’m sure\r\nthe master is a hangel when his pipe’s alight. Compared to other times.”\r\n\r\nWilliam was at first a rather shabby young man of the ready-made\r\nblack-coat school of costume. He had watery grey eyes, and a complexion\r\nappropriate to the brother of one in a Home for the Dying. Euphemia did\r\nnot fancy him very much, even at the beginning. His eminent\r\nrespectability was vouched for by an alpaca umbrella, from which he\r\nnever allowed himself to be parted.\r\n\r\n“He goes to chapel,” said Jane. “His papa, ma’am—”\r\n\r\n“His _what_, Jane?”\r\n\r\n“His papa, ma’am, was Church; but Mr. Maynard is a Plymouth Brother, and\r\nWilliam thinks it Policy, ma’am, to go there too. Mr. Maynard comes and\r\ntalks to him quite friendly, when they ain’t busy, about using up all\r\nthe ends of string, and about his soul He takes a lot of notice, do Mr.\r\nMaynard, of William, and the way he saves string and his soul, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nPresently we heard that the head porter at Maynard’s had left, and that\r\nWilliam was head porter at twenty-three shillings a week. “He is really\r\nkind of over the man who drives the van,” said Jane, “and him married\r\nwith three children.” And she promised in the pride of her heart to make\r\ninterest for us with William to favour us so that we might get our\r\nparcels of drapery from Maynard’s with exceptional promptitude.\r\n\r\nAfter this promotion a rapidly increasing prosperity came upon Jane’s\r\nyoung man. One day, we learned that Mr. Maynard had given William a\r\nbook. “Smiles’ ’Elp Yourself, it’s called,” said Jane; “but it ain’t\r\ncomic. It tells you how to get on in the world, and some what William\r\nread to me was _lovely_, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nEuphemia told me of this laughing, and then she became suddenly grave.\r\n“Do you know, dear,” she said, “Jane said one thing I did not like. She\r\nhad been quiet for a minute, and then she suddenly remarked, ‘William is\r\na lot above me, ma’am, ain’t he?’”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see anything in that,” I said, though later my eyes were to be\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon about that time I was sitting at my\r\nwriting-desk—possibly I was reading a good book—when a something went by\r\nthe window. I heard a startled exclamation behind me, and saw Euphemia\r\nwith her hands clasped together and her eyes dilated. “George,” she said\r\nin an awe-stricken whisper, “did you see?”\r\n\r\nThen we both spoke to one another at the same moment, slowly and\r\nsolemnly: “_A silk hat! Yellow gloves! A new umbrella!_”\r\n\r\n“It may be my fancy, dear,” said Euphemia; “but his tie was very like\r\nyours. I believe Jane keeps him in ties. She told me a little while ago,\r\nin a way that implied volumes about the rest of your costume, ‘The\r\nmaster _do_ wear pretty ties, ma’am.’ And he echoes all your novelties.”\r\n\r\nThe young couple passed our window again on their way to their customary\r\nwalk. They were arm in arm. Jane looked exquisitely proud, happy, and\r\nuncomfortable, with new white cotton gloves, and William, in the silk\r\nhat, singularly genteel!\r\n\r\nThat was the culmination of Jane’s happiness. When she returned, “Mr.\r\nMaynard has been talking to William, ma’am,” she said, “and he is to\r\nserve customers, just like the young shop gentlemen, during the next\r\nsale. And if he gets on, he is to be made an assistant, ma’am, at the\r\nfirst opportunity. He has got to be as gentlemanly as he can, ma’am; and\r\nif he ain’t, ma’am, he says it won’t be for want of trying. Mr. Maynard\r\nhas took a great fancy to him.”\r\n\r\n“He _is_ getting on, Jane,” said my wife.\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am,” said Jane, thoughtfully, “he _is_ getting on.”\r\n\r\nAnd she sighed.\r\n\r\nThat next Sunday, as I drank my tea, I interrogated my wife. “How is\r\nthis Sunday different from all other Sundays, little woman? What has\r\nhappened? Have you altered the curtains, or rearranged the furniture, or\r\nwhere is the indefinable difference of it? Are you wearing your hair in\r\na new way without warning me? I clearly perceive a change in my\r\nenvironment, and I cannot for the life of me say what it is.”\r\n\r\nThen my wife answered in her most tragic voice: “George,” she said,\r\n“that—that William has not come near the place to-day! And Jane is\r\ncrying her heart out upstairs.”\r\n\r\nThere followed a period of silence. Jane, as I have said, stopped\r\nsinging about the house, and began to care for our brittle possessions,\r\nwhich struck my wife as being a very sad sign indeed. The next Sunday,\r\nand the next, Jane asked to go out, “to walk with William;” and my wife,\r\nwho never attempts to extort confidences, gave her permission, and asked\r\nno questions. On each occasion Jane came back looking flushed and very\r\ndetermined. At last one day she became communicative.\r\n\r\n“William is being led away,” she remarked abruptly, with a catching of\r\nthe breath, apropos of table-cloths. “Yes, m’m. She is a milliner, and\r\nshe can play on the piano.”\r\n\r\n“I thought,” said my wife, “that you went out with him on Sunday.”\r\n\r\n“Not out with him, m’m—after him. I walked along by the side of them,\r\nand told her he was engaged to me.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me, Jane, did you? What did they do?”\r\n\r\n“Took no more notice of me than if I was dirt. So I told her she should\r\nsuffer for it.”\r\n\r\n“It could not have been a very agreeable walk, Jane.”\r\n\r\n“Not for no parties, ma’am.\r\n\r\n“I wish,” said Jane, “I could play the piano, ma’am. But anyhow, I don’t\r\nmean to let _her_ get him away from me. She’s older than him, and her\r\nhair ain’t gold to the roots, ma’am.”\r\n\r\nIt was on the August Bank Holiday that the crisis came. We do not\r\nclearly know the details of the fray, but only such fragments as poor\r\nJane let fall. She came home dusty, excited, and with her heart hot\r\nwithin her.\r\n\r\nThe milliner’s mother, the milliner, and William had made a party to the\r\nArt Museum at South Kensington, I think. Anyhow, Jane had calmly but\r\nfirmly accosted them somewhere in the streets, and asserted her right to\r\nwhat, in spite of the consensus of literature, she held to be her\r\ninalienable property. She did, I think, go so far as to lay hands on\r\nhim. They dealt with her in a crushingly superior way. They “called a\r\ncab.” There was a “scene,” William being pulled away into the\r\nfour-wheeler by his future wife and mother-in-law from the reluctant\r\nhands of our discarded Jane. There were threats of giving her “in\r\ncharge.”\r\n\r\n“My poor Jane!” said my wife, mincing veal as though she was mincing\r\nWilliam. “It’s a shame of them. I would think no more of him. He is not\r\nworthy of you.”\r\n\r\n“No, m’m,” said Jane. “He _is_ weak.\r\n\r\n“But it’s that woman has done it,” said Jane. She was never known to\r\nbring herself to pronounce “that woman’s” name or to admit her\r\ngirlishness. “I can’t think what minds some women must have—to try and\r\nget a girl’s young man away from her. But there, it only hurts to talk\r\nabout it,” said Jane.\r\n\r\nThereafter our house rested from William. But there was something in the\r\nmanner of Jane’s scrubbing the front doorstep or sweeping out the rooms,\r\na certain viciousness, that persuaded me that the story had not yet\r\nended.\r\n\r\n“Please, m’m, may I go and see a wedding to-morrow?” said Jane, one day.\r\n\r\nMy wife knew by instinct whose wedding. “Do you think it is wise, Jane?”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“I would like to see the last of him,” said Jane.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said my wife, fluttering into my room about twenty minutes\r\nafter Jane had started, “Jane has been to the boot-hole and taken all\r\nthe left-off boots and shoes, and gone off to the wedding with them in a\r\nbag. Surely she cannot mean—”\r\n\r\n“Jane,” I said, “is developing character. Let us hope for the best.”\r\n\r\nJane came back with a pale, hard face. All the boots seemed to be still\r\nin her bag, at which my wife heaved a premature sigh of relief. We heard\r\nher go upstairs and replace the boots with considerable emphasis.\r\n\r\n“Quite a crowd at the wedding, ma’am,” she said presently, in a purely\r\nconversational style, sitting in our little kitchen, and scrubbing the\r\npotatoes; “and such a lovely day for them.” She proceeded to numerous\r\nother details, clearly avoiding some cardinal incident.\r\n\r\n“It was all extremely respectable and nice, ma’am; but _her_ father\r\ndidn’t wear a black coat, and looked quite out of place, ma’am. Mr.\r\nPiddingquirk—”\r\n\r\n“_Who?_”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Piddingquirk—William that _was_, ma’am—had white gloves, and a coat\r\nlike a clergyman, and a lovely chrysanthemum. He looked so nice, ma’am.\r\nAnd there was red carpet down, just like for gentlefolks. And they say\r\nhe gave the clerk four shillings, ma’am. It was a real kerridge they\r\nhad—not a fly. When they came out of church, there was rice-throwing,\r\nand her two little sisters dropping dead flowers. And some one threw a\r\nslipper, and then I threw a boot—”\r\n\r\n“Threw a _boot_, Jane!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, ma’am. Aimed at _her_. But it hit _him_. Yes, ma’am, hard. Gev him\r\na black eye, I should think. I only threw that one. I hadn’t the heart\r\nto try again. All the little boys cheered when it hit him.”\r\n\r\nAfter an interval—“I am sorry the boot hit _him_.”\r\n\r\nAnother pause. The potatoes were being scrubbed violently. “He always\r\n_was_ a bit above me, you know, ma’am. And he was led away.”\r\n\r\nThe potatoes were more than finished. Jane rose sharply, with a sigh,\r\nand rapped the basin down on the table.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care,” she said. “I don’t care a rap. He will find out his\r\nmistake yet. It serves me right. I was stuck up about him. I ought not\r\nto have looked so high. And I am glad things are as things are.”\r\n\r\nMy wife was in the kitchen, seeing to the higher cookery. After the\r\nconfession of the boot-throwing, she must have watched poor Jane fuming\r\nwith a certain dismay in those brown eyes of hers. But I imagine they\r\nsoftened again very quickly, and then Jane’s must have met them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, ma’am,” said Jane, with an astonishing change of note, “think of\r\nall that _might_ have been! Oh, ma’am, I _could_ have been so happy! I\r\nought to have known, but I didn’t know—You’re very kind to let me talk\r\nto you, ma’am—for it’s hard on me, ma’am—it’s har-r-r-r-d—”\r\n\r\nAnd I gather that Euphemia so far forgot herself as to let Jane sob out\r\nsome of the fulness of her heart on a sympathetic shoulder. My Euphemia,\r\nthank Heaven, has never properly grasped the importance of “keeping up\r\nher position.” And since that fit of weeping, much of the accent of\r\nbitterness has gone out of Jane’s scrubbing and brush-work.\r\n\r\nIndeed, something passed the other day with the butcher-boy—but that\r\nscarcely belongs to this story. However, Jane is young still, and time\r\nand change are at work with her. We all have our sorrows, but I do not\r\nbelieve very much in the existence of sorrows that never heal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LOST INHERITANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n“My uncle,” said the man with the glass eye, “was what you might call a\r\nhemi-semi-demi millionaire. He was worth about a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand. Quite. And he left me all his money.”\r\n\r\nI glanced at the shiny sleeve of his coat, and my eye travelled up to\r\nthe frayed collar.\r\n\r\n“Every penny,” said the man with the glass eye, and I caught the active\r\npupil looking at me with a touch of offence.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never had any windfalls like that,” I said, trying to speak\r\nenviously and propitiate him.\r\n\r\n“Even a legacy isn’t always a blessing,” he remarked with a sigh, and\r\nwith an air of philosophical resignation he put the red nose and the\r\nwiry moustache into his tankard for a space.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not,” I said.\r\n\r\n“He was an author, you see, and he wrote a lot of books.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“That was the trouble of it all.” He stared at me with the available\r\neye, to see if I grasped his statement, then averted his face a little\r\nand produced a toothpick.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he said, smacking his lips after a pause, “it was like this.\r\nHe was my uncle—my maternal uncle. And he had—what shall I call it?—a\r\nweakness for writing edifying literature. Weakness is hardly the\r\nword—downright mania is nearer the mark. He’d been librarian in a\r\nPolytechnic, and as soon as the money came to him he began to indulge\r\nhis ambition. It’s a simply extraordinary and incomprehensible thing to\r\nme. Here was a man of thirty-seven suddenly dropped into a perfect pile\r\nof gold, and he didn’t go—not a day’s bust on it. One would think a chap\r\nwould go and get himself dressed a bit decent—say a couple of dozen\r\npairs of trousers at a West End tailor’s; but he never did. You’d hardly\r\nbelieve it, but when he died he hadn’t even a gold watch. It seems wrong\r\nfor people like that to have money. All he did was just to take a house,\r\nand order in pretty nearly five tons of books and ink and paper, and set\r\nto writing edifying literature as hard as ever he could write. I _can’t_\r\nunderstand it! But he did. The money came to him, curiously enough,\r\nthrough a maternal uncle of _his_, unexpected like, when he was\r\nseven-and-thirty. My mother, it happened, was his only relation in the\r\nwide, wide world, except some second cousins of his. And I was her only\r\nson. You follow all that? The second cousins had one only son, too; but\r\nthey brought him to see the old man too soon. He was rather a spoilt\r\nyoungster, was this son of theirs, and directly he set eyes on my uncle,\r\nhe began bawling out as hard as he could. ‘Take ’im away—er,’ he says,\r\n‘take ’im away,’ and so did for himself entirely. It was pretty straight\r\nsailing, you’d think, for me, eh? And my mother, being a sensible,\r\ncareful woman, settled the business in her own mind long before he did.\r\n\r\n“He was a curious little chap, was my uncle, as I remember him. I don’t\r\nwonder at the kid being scared. Hair, just like these Japanese dolls\r\nthey sell, black and straight and stiff all round the brim and none in\r\nthe middle, and below, a whitish kind of face and rather large dark grey\r\neyes moving about behind his spectacles. He used to attach a great deal\r\nof importance to dress, and always wore a flapping overcoat and a\r\nbig-rimmed felt hat of a most extraordinary size. He looked a rummy\r\nlittle beggar, I can tell you. Indoors it was, as a rule, a dirty red\r\nflannel dressing-gown and a black skull-cap he had. That black skull-cap\r\nmade him look like the portraits of all kinds of celebrated people. He\r\nwas always moving about from house to house, was my uncle, with his\r\nchair which had belonged to Savage Landor, and his two writing-tables,\r\none of Carlyle’s and the other of Shelley’s, so the dealer told him, and\r\nthe completest portable reference library in England, he said he\r\nhad,—and he lugged the whole caravan, now to a house at Down, near\r\nDarwin’s old place, then to Reigate, near Meredith, then off to\r\nHaslemere, then back to Chelsea for a bit, and then up to Hampstead. He\r\nknew there was something wrong with his stuff, but he never knew there\r\nwas anything wrong with his brains. It was always the air, or the water,\r\nor the altitude, or some tommy-rot like that. ‘So much depends on\r\nenvironment,’ he used to say, and stare at you hard, as if he\r\nhalf-suspected you were hiding a grin at him somewhere under your face.\r\n‘So much depends on environment to a sensitive mind like mine.’\r\n\r\n“What was his name? You wouldn’t know it if I told you. He wrote nothing\r\nthat any one has ever read—nothing. No one _could_ read it. He wanted to\r\nbe a great teacher, he said, and he didn’t know what he wanted to teach\r\nany more than a child. So he just blethered at large about Truth and\r\nRighteousness, and the Spirit of History, and all that. Book after book\r\nhe wrote and published at his own expense. He wasn’t quite right in his\r\nhead, you know, really; and to hear him go on at the critics—not because\r\nthey slated him, mind you—he liked that—but because they didn’t take any\r\nnotice of him at all. ‘What do the nations want?’ he would ask, holding\r\nout his brown old claw. ‘Why, teaching—guidance! They are scattered upon\r\nthe hills like sheep without a shepherd. There is War, and Rumours of\r\nWar, the unlaid Spirit of Discord abroad in the land, Nihilism,\r\nVivisection, Vaccination, Drunkenness, Penury, Want, Socialistic Error,\r\nSelfish Capital! Do you see the clouds, Ted?’—my name, you know—‘Do you\r\nsee the clouds lowering over the land? and behind it all—the Mongol\r\nwaits!’ He was always very great on Mongols, and the Spectre of\r\nSocialism, and such-like things.\r\n\r\n“Then out would come his finger at me, and, with his eyes all afire and\r\nhis skull-cap askew, he would whisper: ‘And here am I. What do I want?\r\nNations to teach. Nations! I say it with all modesty, Ted, I _could_. I\r\nwould guide them; nay! but I _will_ guide them to a safe haven, to the\r\nland of Righteousness, flowing with milk and honey.’\r\n\r\n“That’s how he used to go on. Ramble, rave about the nations, and\r\nrighteousness, and that kind of thing. Kind of mincemeat of Bible and\r\nblethers. From fourteen up to three-and-twenty, when I might have been\r\nimproving my mind, my mother used to wash me and brush my hair (at least\r\nin the earlier years of it), with a nice parting down the middle, and\r\ntake me, once or twice a week, to hear this old lunatic jabber about\r\nthings he had read of in the morning papers, trying to do it as much\r\nlike Carlyle as he could; and I used to sit according to instructions,\r\nand look intelligent and nice, and pretend to be taking it all in.\r\nAfterwards, I used to go of my own free will, out of a regard for the\r\nlegacy. I was the only person that used to go and see him. He wrote, I\r\nbelieve, to every man who made the slightest stir in the world, sending\r\nhim a copy or so of his books, and inviting him to come and talk about\r\nthe nations to him; but half of them didn’t answer, and none ever came.\r\nAnd when the girl let you in—she was an artful bit of goods, that\r\ngirl—there were heaps of letters on the hall-seat waiting to go off,\r\naddressed to Prince Bismark, the President of the United States, and\r\nsuch-like people. And one went up the staircase and along the cobwebby\r\npassage,—the housekeeper drank like fury, and his passages were always\r\ncobwebby,—and found him at last, with books turned down all over the\r\nroom, and heaps of torn paper on the floor, and telegrams and newspapers\r\nlittered about, and empty coffee-cups and half-eaten bits of toast on\r\nthe desk and the mantel. You’d see his back humped up, and his hair\r\nwould be sticking out quite straight between the collar of that\r\ndressing-gown thing and the edge of the skull-cap.\r\n\r\n“‘A moment!’ he would say. ‘A moment!’ over his shoulder. ‘The _mot\r\njuste_, you know, Ted, _le mot juste_. Righteous thought righteously\r\nexpressed—Aah!—concatenation. And now, Ted,’ he’d say, spinning round in\r\nhis study chair, ‘how’s Young England?’ That was his silly name for me.\r\n\r\n“Well, that was my uncle, and that was how he talked—to me, at any rate.\r\nWith others about he seemed a bit shy. And he not only talked to me, but\r\nhe gave me his books, books of six hundred pages or so, with cock-eyed\r\nheadings, ‘The Shrieking Sisterhood,’ ‘The Behemoth of Bigotry,’\r\n‘Crucibles and Cullenders,’ and so on. All very strong, and none of them\r\noriginal. The very last time but one that I saw him he gave me a book.\r\nHe was feeling ill even then, and his hand shook and he was despondent.\r\nI noticed it because I was naturally on the look-out for those little\r\nsymptoms. ‘My last book, Ted,’ he said. ‘My last book, my boy; my last\r\nword to the deaf and hardened nations;’ and I’m hanged if a tear didn’t\r\ngo rolling down his yellow old cheek. He was regular crying because it\r\nwas so nearly over, and he hadn’t only written about fifty-three books\r\nof rubbish. ‘I’ve sometimes thought, Ted—’ he said, and stopped.\r\n\r\n“‘Perhaps I’ve been a bit hasty and angry with this stiff-necked\r\ngeneration. A little more sweetness, perhaps, and a little less blinding\r\nlight. I’ve sometimes thought—I might have swayed them. But I’ve done my\r\nbest, Ted.’\r\n\r\n“And then, with a burst, for the first and last time in his life he\r\nowned himself a failure. It showed he was really ill. He seemed to think\r\nfor a minute, and then he spoke quietly and low, as sane and sober as I\r\nam now. ‘I’ve been a fool, Ted,’ he said. ‘I’ve been flapping nonsense\r\nall my life. Only He who readeth the heart knows whether this is\r\nanything more than vanity. Ted, I don’t. But He knows, He knows, and if\r\nI have done foolishly and vainly, in my heart—in my heart—’\r\n\r\n“Just like that he spoke, repeating himself, and he stopped quite short\r\nand handed the book to me, trembling. Then the old shine came back into\r\nhis eye. I remember it all fairly well, because I repeated it and acted\r\nit to my old mother when I got home, to cheer her up a bit. ‘Take this\r\nbook and read it,’ he said. ‘It’s my last word, my very last word. I’ve\r\nleft all my property to you, Ted, and may you use it better than I have\r\ndone.’ And then he fell a-coughing.\r\n\r\n“I remember that quite well even now, and how I went home cock-a-hoop,\r\nand how he was in bed the next time I called. The housekeeper was\r\ndownstairs drunk, and I fooled about—as a young man will—with the girl\r\nin the passage before I went to him. He was sinking fast. But even then\r\nhis vanity clung to him.\r\n\r\n“‘Have you read it?’ he whispered.\r\n\r\n“‘Sat up all night reading it,’ I said in his ear to cheer him. ‘It’s\r\nthe last,’ said I, and then, with a memory of some poetry or other in my\r\nhead, ‘but it’s the bravest and best.’\r\n\r\n“He smiled a little and tried to squeeze my hand as a woman might do,\r\nand left off squeezing in the middle, and lay still. ‘The bravest and\r\nthe best,’ said I again, seeing it pleased him. But he didn’t answer. I\r\nheard the girl giggle outside the door, for occasionally we’d had just a\r\nbit of innocent laughter, you know, at his ways. I looked at his face,\r\nand his eyes were closed, and it was just as if somebody had punched in\r\nhis nose on either side. But he was still smiling. It’s queer to think\r\nof—he lay dead, lay dead there, an utter failure, with the smile of\r\nsuccess on his face.\r\n\r\n“That was the end of my uncle. You can imagine me and my mother saw that\r\nhe had a decent funeral. Then, of course, came the hunt for the will. We\r\nbegan decent and respectful at first, and before the day was out we were\r\nripping chairs, and smashing bureau panels, and sounding walls. Every\r\nhour we expected those others to come in. We asked the housekeeper, and\r\nfound she’d actually witnessed a will—on an ordinary half-sheet of\r\nnotepaper it was written, and very short, she said—not a month ago. The\r\nother witness was the gardener, and he bore her out word for word. But\r\nI’m hanged if there was that or any other will to be found. The way my\r\nmother talked must have made him turn in his grave. At last a lawyer at\r\nReigate sprang one on us that had been made years ago during some\r\ntemporary quarrel with my mother. I’m blest if that wasn’t the only will\r\nto be discovered anywhere, and it left every penny he possessed to that\r\n‘Take ’im away’ youngster of his second cousin’s—a chap who’d never had\r\nto stand his talking not for one afternoon of his life.”\r\n\r\nThe man with the glass eye stopped.\r\n\r\n“I thought you said—” I began.\r\n\r\n“Half a minute,” said the man with the glass eye. “_I_ had to wait for\r\nthe end of the story till this very morning, and I was a blessed sight\r\nmore interested than you are. You just wait a bit, too. They executed\r\nthe will, and the other chap inherited, and directly he was\r\none-and-twenty he began to blew it. How he did blew it, to be sure! He\r\nbet, he drank, he got in the papers for this and that. I tell you, it\r\nmakes me wriggle to think of the times he had. He blewed every ha’penny\r\nof it before he was thirty, and the last I heard of him was—Holloway!\r\nThree years ago.\r\n\r\n“Well, I naturally fell on hard times, because, as you see, the only\r\ntrade I knew was legacy-cadging. All my plans were waiting over to\r\nbegin, so to speak, when the old chap died. I’ve had my ups and downs\r\nsince then. Just now it’s a period of depression. I tell you frankly,\r\nI’m on the look-out for help. I was hunting round my room to find\r\nsomething to raise a bit on for immediate necessities, and the sight of\r\nall those presentation volumes—no one will buy them, not to wrap butter\r\nin, even—well, they annoyed me. I’d promised him not to part with them,\r\nand I never kept a promise easier. I let out at them with my boot, and\r\nsent them shooting across the room. One lifted at the kick, and spun\r\nthrough the air. And out of it flapped—You guess?\r\n\r\n“It was the will. He’d given it me himself in that very last volume of\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nHe folded his arms on the table, and looked sadly with the active eye at\r\nhis empty tankard. He shook his head slowly, and said softly, “I’d never\r\n_opened_ the book, much more cut a page!” Then he looked up, with a\r\nbitter laugh, for my sympathy. “Fancy hiding it there! Eigh? Of all\r\nplaces.”\r\n\r\nHe began to fish absently for a dead fly with his finger. “It just shows\r\nyou the vanity of authors,” he said, looking up at me. “It wasn’t no\r\ntrick of his. He’d meant perfectly fair. He’d really thought I was\r\nreally going home to read that blessed book of his through. But it shows\r\nyou, don’t it?”—his eye went down to the tankard again,—“it shows you,\r\ntoo, how we poor human beings fail to understand one another.”\r\n\r\nBut there was no misunderstanding the eloquent thirst of his eye. He\r\naccepted with ill-feigned surprise. He said, in the usual subtle\r\nformula, that he didn’t mind if he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       POLLOCK AND THE PORROH MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in a swampy village on the lagoon river behind the Turner\r\nPeninsula that Pollock’s first encounter with the Porroh man occurred.\r\nThe women of that country are famous for their good looks—they are\r\nGallinas with a dash of European blood that dates from the days of Vasco\r\nda Gama and the English slave-traders, and the Porroh man, too, was\r\npossibly inspired by a faint Caucasian taint in his composition. (It’s a\r\ncurious thing to think that some of us may have distant cousins eating\r\nmen on Sherboro Island or raiding with the Sofas.) At any rate, the\r\nPorroh man stabbed the woman to the heart as though he had been a mere\r\nlow-class Italian, and very narrowly missed Pollock. But Pollock, using\r\nhis revolver to parry the lightning stab which was aimed at his deltoid\r\nmuscle, sent the iron dagger flying, and, firing, hit the man in the\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe fired again and missed, knocking a sudden window out of the wall of\r\nthe hut. The Porroh man stooped in the doorway, glancing under his arm\r\nat Pollock. Pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted face in the\r\nsunlight, and then the Englishman was alone, sick and trembling with the\r\nexcitement of the affair, in the twilight of the place. It had all\r\nhappened in less time than it takes to read about it.\r\n\r\nThe woman was quite dead, and having ascertained this, Pollock went to\r\nthe entrance of the hut and looked out. Things outside were dazzling\r\nbright. Half a dozen of the porters of the expedition were standing up\r\nin a group near the green huts they occupied, and staring towards him,\r\nwondering what the shots might signify. Behind the little group of men\r\nwas the broad stretch of black fetid mud by the river, a green carpet of\r\nrafts of papyrus and water-grass, and then the leaden water. The\r\nmangroves beyond the stream loomed indistinctly through the blue haze.\r\nThere were no signs of excitement in the squat village, whose fence was\r\njust visible above the cane-grass.\r\n\r\nPollock came out of the hut cautiously and walked towards the river,\r\nlooking over his shoulder at intervals. But the Porroh man had vanished.\r\nPollock clutched his revolver nervously in his hand.\r\n\r\nOne of his men came to meet him, and as he came, pointed to the bushes\r\nbehind the hut in which the Porroh man had disappeared. Pollock had an\r\nirritating persuasion of having made an absolute fool of himself; he\r\nfelt bitter, savage, at the turn things had taken. At the same time, he\r\nwould have to tell Waterhouse—the moral, exemplary, cautious\r\nWaterhouse—who would inevitably take the matter seriously. Pollock\r\ncursed bitterly at his luck, at Waterhouse, and especially at the West\r\nCoast of Africa. He felt consummately sick of the expedition. And in the\r\nback of his mind all the time was a speculative doubt where precisely\r\nwithin the visible horizon the Porroh man might be.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps rather shocking, but he was not at all upset by the murder\r\nthat had just happened. He had seen so much brutality during the last\r\nthree months, so many dead women, burnt huts, drying skeletons, up the\r\nKittam River in the wake of the Sofa cavalry, that his senses were\r\nblunted. What disturbed him was the persuasion that this business was\r\nonly beginning.\r\n\r\nHe swore savagely at the black, who ventured to ask a question, and went\r\non into the tent under the orange-trees where Waterhouse was lying,\r\nfeeling exasperatingly like a boy going into the headmaster’s study.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse was still sleeping off the effects of his last dose of\r\nchlorodyne, and Pollock sat down on a packing-case beside him, and,\r\nlighting his pipe, waited for him to awake. About him were scattered the\r\npots and weapons Waterhouse had collected from the Mendi people, and\r\nwhich he had been repacking for the canoe voyage to Sulyma.\r\n\r\nPresently Waterhouse woke up, and after judicial stretching, decided he\r\nwas all right again. Pollock got him some tea. Over the tea the\r\nincidents of the afternoon were described by Pollock, after some\r\npreliminary beating about the bush. Waterhouse took the matter even more\r\nseriously than Pollock had anticipated. He did not simply disapprove, he\r\nscolded, he insulted.\r\n\r\n“You’re one of those infernal fools who think a black man isn’t a human\r\nbeing,” he said. “I can’t be ill a day without you must get into some\r\ndirty scrape or other. This is the third time in a month that you have\r\ncome crossways-on with a native, and this time you’re in for it with a\r\nvengeance. Porroh, too! They’re down upon you enough as it is, about\r\nthat idol you wrote your silly name on. And they’re the most vindictive\r\ndevils on earth! You make a man ashamed of civilisation. To think you\r\ncome of a decent family! If ever I cumber myself up with a vicious,\r\nstupid young lout like you again—”\r\n\r\n“Steady on, now,” snarled Pollock, in the tone that always exasperated\r\nWaterhouse; “steady on.”\r\n\r\nAt that Waterhouse became speechless. He jumped to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Look here, Pollock,” he said, after a struggle to control his breath.\r\n“You must go home. I won’t have you any longer. I’m ill enough as it is\r\nthrough you—”\r\n\r\n“Keep your hair on,” said Pollock, staring in front of him. “I’m ready\r\nenough to go.”\r\n\r\nWaterhouse became calmer again. He sat down on the camp-stool. “Very\r\nwell,” he said. “I don’t want a row, Pollock, you know; but it’s\r\nconfoundedly annoying to have one’s plans put out by this kind of thing.\r\nI’ll come to Sulyma with you, and see you safe aboard—”\r\n\r\n“You needn’t,” said Pollock. “I can go alone. From here.”\r\n\r\n“Not far,” said Waterhouse. “You don’t understand this Porroh business.”\r\n\r\n“How should _I_ know she belonged to a Porrohman?” said Pollock,\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n“Well, she did,” said Waterhouse; “and you can’t undo the thing. Go\r\nalone, indeed! I wonder what they’d do to you. You don’t seem to\r\nunderstand that this Porroh hokey-pokey rules this country, is its law,\r\nreligion, constitution, medicine, magic—They appoint the chiefs. The\r\nInquisition, at its best, couldn’t hold a candle to these chaps. He will\r\nprobably set Awajale, the chief here, on to us. It’s lucky our porters\r\nare Mendis. We shall have to shift this little settlement of\r\nours—Confound you, Pollock! And, of course, you must go and miss him.”\r\n\r\nHe thought, and his thoughts seemed disagreeable. Presently he stood up\r\nand took his rifle. “I’d keep close for a bit, if I were you,” he said,\r\nover his shoulder, as he went out. “I’m going out to see what I can find\r\nout about it.”\r\n\r\nPollock remained sitting in the tent, meditating. “I was meant for a\r\ncivilised life,” he said to himself, regretfully, as he filled his pipe.\r\n“The sooner I get back to London or Paris the better for me.”\r\n\r\nHis eye fell on the sealed case in which Waterhouse had put the\r\nfeatherless poisoned arrows they had bought in the Mendi country. “I\r\nwish I had hit the beggar somewhere vital,” said Pollock, viciously.\r\n\r\nWaterhouse came back after a long interval. He was not communicative,\r\nthough Pollock asked him questions enough. The Porroh man, it seems, was\r\na prominent member of that mystical society. The village was interested,\r\nbut not threatening. No doubt the witch-doctor had gone into the bush.\r\nHe was a great witch-doctor. “Of course, he’s up to something,” said\r\nWaterhouse, and became silent.\r\n\r\n“But what can he do?” asked Pollock, unheeded.\r\n\r\n“I must get you out of this. There’s something brewing, or things would\r\nnot be so quiet,” said Waterhouse, after a gap of silence. Pollock\r\nwanted to know what the brew might be. “Dancing in a circle of skulls,”\r\nsaid Waterhouse; “brewing a stink in a copper pot.” Pollock wanted\r\nparticulars. Waterhouse was vague, Pollock pressing. At last Waterhouse\r\nlost his temper. “How the devil should _I_ know?” he said to Pollock’s\r\ntwentieth inquiry what the Porroh man would do. “He tried to kill you\r\noff-hand in the hut. _Now_, I fancy he will try something more\r\nelaborate. But you’ll see fast enough. I don’t want to help unnerve you.\r\nIt’s probably all nonsense.”\r\n\r\nThat night, as they were sitting at their fire, Pollock again tried to\r\ndraw Waterhouse out on the subject of Porroh methods. “Better get to\r\nsleep,” said Waterhouse, when Pollock’s bent became apparent; “we start\r\nearly to-morrow. You may want all your nerve about you.”\r\n\r\n“But what line will he take?”\r\n\r\n“Can’t say. They’re versatile people. They know a lot of rum dodges.\r\nYou’d better get that copper-devil, Shakespear, to talk.”\r\n\r\nThere was a flash and a heavy bang out of the darkness behind the huts,\r\nand a clay bullet came whistling close to Pollock’s head. This, at\r\nleast, was crude enough. The blacks and half-breeds sitting and yarning\r\nround their own fire jumped up, and some one fired into the dark.\r\n\r\n“Better go into one of the huts,” said Waterhouse, quietly, still\r\nsitting unmoved.\r\n\r\nPollock stood up by the fire and drew his revolver. Fighting, at least,\r\nhe was not afraid of. But a man in the dark is in the best of armour.\r\nRealising the wisdom of Waterhouse’s advice, Pollock went into the tent\r\nand lay down there.\r\n\r\nWhat little sleep he had was disturbed by dreams, variegated dreams, but\r\nchiefly of the Porroh man’s face, upside down, as he went out of the\r\nhut, and looked up under his arm. It was odd that this transitory\r\nimpression should have stuck so firmly in Pollock’s memory. Moreover, he\r\nwas troubled by queer pains in his limbs.\r\n\r\nIn the white haze of the early morning, as they were loading the canoes,\r\na barbed arrow suddenly appeared quivering in the ground close to\r\nPollock’s foot. The boys made a perfunctory effort to clear out the\r\nthicket, but it led to no capture.\r\n\r\nAfter these two occurrences, there was a disposition on the part of the\r\nexpedition to leave Pollock to himself, and Pollock became, for the\r\nfirst time in his life, anxious to mingle with blacks. Waterhouse took\r\none canoe, and Pollock, in spite of a friendly desire to chat with\r\nWaterhouse, had to take the other. He was left all alone in the front\r\npart of the canoe, and he had the greatest trouble to make the men—who\r\ndid not love him—keep to the middle of the river, a clear hundred yards\r\nor more from either shore. However, he made Shakespear, the Freetown\r\nhalf-breed, come up to his own end of the canoe and tell him about\r\nPorroh, which Shakespear, failing in his attempts to leave Pollock\r\nalone, presently did with considerable freedom and gusto.\r\n\r\nThe day passed. The canoe glided swiftly along the ribbon of lagoon\r\nwater, between the drift of water-figs, fallen trees, papyrus, and\r\npalm-wine palms, and with the dark mangrove swamp to the left, through\r\nwhich one could hear now and then the roar of the Atlantic surf.\r\nShakespear told, in his soft blurred English, of how the Porroh could\r\ncast spells; how men withered up under their malice; how they could send\r\ndreams and devils; how they tormented and killed the sons of Ijibu; how\r\nthey kidnapped a white trader from Sulyma who had maltreated one of the\r\nsect, and how his body looked when it was found. And Pollock after each\r\nnarrative cursed under his breath at the want of missionary enterprise\r\nthat allowed such things to be, and at the inert British Government that\r\nruled over this dark heathendom of Sierra Leone. In the evening they\r\ncame to the Kasi Lake, and sent a score of crocodiles lumbering off the\r\nisland on which the expedition camped for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next day they reached Sulyma, and smelt the sea breeze; but Pollock\r\nhad to put up there for five days before he could get on to Freetown.\r\nWaterhouse, considering him to be comparatively safe here, and within\r\nthe pale of Freetown influence, left him and went back with the\r\nexpedition to Gbemma, and Pollock became very friendly with Perera, the\r\nonly resident white trader at Sulyma—so friendly, indeed, that he went\r\nabout with him everywhere. Perera was a little Portuguese Jew, who had\r\nlived in England, and he appreciated the Englishman’s friendliness as a\r\ngreat compliment.\r\n\r\nFor two days nothing happened out of the ordinary; for the most part\r\nPollock and Perera played Nap—the only game they had in common—and\r\nPollock got into debt. Then, on the second evening, Pollock had a\r\ndisagreeable intimation of the arrival of the Porroh man in Sulyma by\r\ngetting a flesh-wound in the shoulder from a lump of filed iron. It was\r\na long shot, and the missile had nearly spent its force when it hit him.\r\nStill it conveyed its message plainly enough. Pollock sat up in his\r\nhammock, revolver in hand, all that night, and next morning confided, to\r\nsome extent, in the Anglo-Portuguese.\r\n\r\nPerera took the matter seriously. He knew the local customs pretty\r\nthoroughly. “It is a personal question, you must know. It is revenge.\r\nAnd of course he is hurried by your leaving de country. None of de\r\nnatives or half-breeds will interfere wid him very much—unless you make\r\nit wort deir while. If you come upon him suddenly, you might shoot him.\r\nBut den he might shoot you.\r\n\r\n“Den dere’s dis—infernal magic,” said Perera. “Of course, I don’t\r\nbelieve in it—superstition; but still it’s not nice to tink dat wherever\r\nyou are, dere is a black man, who spends a moonlight night now and den\r\na-dancing about a fire to send you bad dreams—Had any bad dreams?”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said Pollock. “I keep on seeing the beggar’s head upside down\r\ngrinning at me and showing all his teeth as he did in the hut, and\r\ncoming close up to me, and then going ever so far off, and coming back.\r\nIt’s nothing to be afraid of, but somehow it simply paralyses me with\r\nterror in my sleep. Queer things—dreams. I know it’s a dream all the\r\ntime, and I can’t wake up from it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s probably only fancy,” said Perera. “Den my niggers say Porroh men\r\ncan send snakes. Seen any snakes lately?”\r\n\r\n“Only one. I killed him this morning, on the floor near my hammock.\r\nAlmost trod on him as I got up.”\r\n\r\n“_Ah!_” said Perera, and then, reassuringly, “Of course it is\r\na—coincidence. Still I would keep my eyes open. Den dere’s pains in de\r\nbones.”\r\n\r\n“I thought they were due to miasma,” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“Probably dey are. When did dey begin?”\r\n\r\nThen Pollock remembered that he first noticed them the night after the\r\nfight in the hut. “It’s my opinion he don’t want to kill you,” said\r\nPerera—“at least not yet. I’ve heard deir idea is to scare and worry a\r\nman wid deir spells, and narrow misses, and rheumatic pains, and bad\r\ndreams, and all dat, until he’s sick of life. Of course, it’s all talk,\r\nyou know. You mustn’t worry about it—But I wonder what he’ll be up to\r\nnext.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ shall have to be up to something first,” said Pollock, staring\r\ngloomily at the greasy cards that Perera was putting on the table. “It\r\ndon’t suit my dignity to be followed about, and shot at, and blighted in\r\nthis way. I wonder if Porroh hokey-pokey upsets your luck at cards.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at Perera suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“Very likely it does,” said Perera, warmly, shuffling. “Dey are\r\nwonderful people.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Pollock killed two snakes in his hammock, and there was\r\nalso an extraordinary increase in the number of red ants that swarmed\r\nover the place; and these annoyances put him in a fit temper to talk\r\nover business with a certain Mendi rough he had interviewed before. The\r\nMendi rough showed Pollock a little iron dagger, and demonstrated where\r\none struck in the neck, in a way that made Pollock shiver; and in return\r\nfor certain considerations Pollock promised him a double-barrelled gun\r\nwith an ornamental lock.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as Pollock and Perera were playing cards, the Mendi\r\nrough came in through the doorway, carrying something in a blood-soaked\r\npiece of native cloth.\r\n\r\n“Not here!” said Pollock, very hurriedly. “Not here!”\r\n\r\nBut he was not quick enough to prevent the man, who was anxious to get\r\nto Pollock’s side of the bargain, from opening the cloth and throwing\r\nthe head of the Porroh man upon the table. It bounded from there on to\r\nthe floor, leaving a red trail on the cards, and rolled into a corner,\r\nwhere it came to rest upside down, but glaring hard at Pollock.\r\n\r\nPerera jumped up as the thing fell among the cards, and began in his\r\nexcitement to gabble in Portuguese. The Mendi was bowing, with the red\r\ncloth in his hand. “De gun!” he said. Pollock stared back at the head in\r\nthe corner. It bore exactly the expression it had in his dreams.\r\nSomething seemed to snap in his own brain as he looked at it.\r\n\r\nThen Perera found his English again.\r\n\r\n“You got him killed?” he said. “You did not kill him yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I?” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“But he will not be able to take it off now!”\r\n\r\n“Take _what_ off?” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“And all dese cards are spoiled!”\r\n\r\n“_What_ do you mean by taking off?” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“You must send me a new pack from Freetown. You can buy dem dere.”\r\n\r\n“But—‘take it off’?”\r\n\r\n“It is only superstition. I forgot. De niggers say dat if de witches—he\r\nwas a witch—But it is rubbish—You must make de Porroh man take it off,\r\nor kill him yourself—It is very silly.”\r\n\r\nPollock swore under his breath, still staring hard at the head in the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n“I can’t stand that glare,” he said. Then suddenly he rushed at the\r\nthing and kicked it. It rolled some yards or so, and came to rest in the\r\nsame position as before, upside down, and looking at him.\r\n\r\n“He is ugly,” said the Anglo-Portuguese. “Very ugly. Dey do it on deir\r\nfaces with little knives.”\r\n\r\nPollock would have kicked the head again, but the Mendi man touched him\r\non the arm. “De gun?” he said, looking nervously at the head.\r\n\r\n“Two—if you will take that beastly thing away,” said Pollock.\r\n\r\nThe Mendi shook his head, and intimated that he only wanted one gun now\r\ndue to him, and for which he would be obliged. Pollock found neither\r\ncajolery nor bullying any good with him. Perera had a gun to sell (at a\r\nprofit of three hundred per cent.), and with that the man presently\r\ndeparted. Then Pollock’s eyes, against his will, were recalled to the\r\nthing on the floor.\r\n\r\n“It is funny dat his head keeps upside down,” said Perera, with an\r\nuneasy laugh. “His brains must be heavy, like de weight in de little\r\nimages one sees dat keep always upright wid lead in dem. You will take\r\nhim wiv you when you go presently. You might take him now. De cards are\r\nall spoilt. Dere is a man sell dem in Freetown. De room is in a filty\r\nmess as it is. You should have killed him yourself.”\r\n\r\nPollock pulled himself together, and went and picked up the head. He\r\nwould hang it up by the lamp-hook in the middle of the ceiling of his\r\nroom, and dig a grave for it at once. He was under the impression that\r\nhe hung it up by the hair, but that must have been wrong, for when he\r\nreturned for it, it was hanging by the neck upside down.\r\n\r\nHe buried it before sunset on the north side of the shed he occupied, so\r\nthat he should not have to pass the grave after dark when he was\r\nreturning from Perera’s. He killed two snakes before he went to sleep.\r\nIn the darkest part of the night he awoke with a start, and heard a\r\npattering sound and something scraping on the floor. He sat up\r\nnoiselessly, and felt under his pillow for his revolver. A mumbling\r\ngrowl followed, and Pollock fired at the sound. There was a yelp, and\r\nsomething dark passed for a moment across the hazy blue of the doorway.\r\n“A dog!” said Pollock, lying down again.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn he awoke again with a peculiar sense of unrest. The\r\nvague pain in his bones had returned. For some time he lay watching the\r\nred ants that were swarming over the ceiling, and then, as the light\r\ngrew brighter, he looked over the edge of his hammock and saw something\r\ndark on the floor. He gave such a violent start that the hammock overset\r\nand flung him out.\r\n\r\nHe found himself lying, perhaps, a yard away from the head of the Porroh\r\nman. It had been disinterred by the dog, and the nose was grievously\r\nbattered. Ants and flies swarmed over it. By an odd coincidence, it was\r\nstill upside down, and with the same diabolical expression in the\r\ninverted eyes.\r\n\r\nPollock sat paralysed, and stared at the horror for some time. Then he\r\ngot up and walked round it,—giving it a wide berth—and out of the shed.\r\nThe clear light of the sunrise, the living stir of vegetation before the\r\nbreath of the dying land-breeze, and the empty grave with the marks of\r\nthe dog’s paws, lightened the weight upon his mind a little.\r\n\r\nHe told Perera of the business as though it was a jest,—a jest to be\r\ntold with white lips. “You should not have frighten de dog,” said\r\nPerera, with poorly simulated hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe next two days, until the steamer came, were spent by Pollock in\r\nmaking a more effectual disposition of his possession. Overcoming his\r\naversion to handling the thing, he went down to the river mouth and\r\nthrew it into the sea-water, but by some miracle it escaped the\r\ncrocodiles, and was cast up by the tide on the mud a little way up the\r\nriver, to be found by an intelligent Arab half-breed, and offered for\r\nsale to Pollock and Perera as a curiosity, just on the edge of night.\r\nThe native hung about in the brief twilight, making lower and lower\r\noffers, and at last, getting scared in some way by the evident dread\r\nthese wise white men had for the thing, went off, and, passing Pollock’s\r\nshed, threw his burden in there for Pollock to discover in the morning.\r\n\r\nAt this Pollock got into a kind of frenzy. He would burn the thing. He\r\nwent out straightway into the dawn, and had constructed a big pyre of\r\nbrushwood before the heat of the day. He was interrupted by the hooter\r\nof the little paddle steamer from Monrovia to Bathurst, which was coming\r\nthrough the gap in the bar. “Thank Heaven!” said Pollock, with infinite\r\npiety, when the meaning of the sound dawned upon him. With trembling\r\nhands he lit his pile of wood hastily, threw the head upon it, and went\r\naway to pack his portmanteau and make his adieux to Perera.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, with a sense of infinite relief, Pollock watched the\r\nflat swampy foreshore of Sulyma grow small in the distance. The gap in\r\nthe long line of white surge became narrower and narrower. It seemed to\r\nbe closing in and cutting him off from his trouble. The feeling of dread\r\nand worry began to slip from him bit by bit. At Sulyma belief in Porroh\r\nmalignity and Porroh magic had been in the air, his sense of Porroh had\r\nbeen vast, pervading, threatening, dreadful. Now manifestly the domain\r\nof Porroh was only a little place, a little black band between the sea\r\nand the blue cloudy Mendi uplands.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Porroh!” said Pollock. “Good-bye—certainly not _au revoir_.”\r\n\r\nThe captain of the steamer came and leant over the rail beside him, and\r\nwished him good evening, and spat at the froth of the wake in token of\r\nfriendly ease.\r\n\r\n“I picked up a rummy curio on the beach this go,” said the captain.\r\n“It’s a thing I never saw done this side of Indy before.”\r\n\r\n“What might that be?” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“Pickled ’ed,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“_What?_” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“’Ed—smoked. ’Ed of one of these Porroh chaps, all ornamented with\r\nknife-cuts. Why! What’s up? Nothing? I shouldn’t have took you for a\r\nnervous chap. Green in the face. By gosh! you’re a bad sailor. All\r\nright, eh? Lord, how funny you went! Well, this ’ed I was telling you of\r\nis a bit rum in a way. I’ve got it, along with some snakes, in a jar of\r\nspirit in my cabin what I keeps for such curios, and I’m hanged if it\r\ndon’t float upsy down. Hullo!”\r\n\r\nPollock had given an incoherent cry, and had his hands in his hair. He\r\nran towards the paddle-boxes with a half-formed idea of jumping into the\r\nsea, and then he realised his position and turned back towards the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n“Here!” said the captain. “Jack Philips, just keep him off me! Stand\r\noff! No nearer, mister! What’s the matter with you? Are you mad?”\r\n\r\nPollock put his hand to his head. It was no good explaining. “I believe\r\nI am pretty nearly mad at times,” he said. “It’s a pain I have here.\r\nComes suddenly. You’ll excuse me, I hope.”\r\n\r\nHe was white and in a perspiration. He saw suddenly very clearly all the\r\ndanger he ran of having his sanity doubted. He forced himself to restore\r\nthe captain’s confidence, by answering his sympathetic inquiries, noting\r\nhis suggestions, even trying a spoonful of neat brandy in his cheek,\r\nand, that matter settled, asking a number of questions about the\r\ncaptain’s private trade in curiosities. The captain described the head\r\nin detail. All the while Pollock was struggling to keep under a\r\npreposterous persuasion that the ship was as transparent as glass, and\r\nthat he could distinctly see the inverted face looking at him from the\r\ncabin beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nPollock had a worse time almost on the steamer than he had at Sulyma.\r\nAll day he had to control himself in spite of his intense perception of\r\nthe imminent presence of that horrible head that was overshadowing his\r\nmind. At night his old nightmare returned, until, with a violent effort,\r\nhe would force himself awake, rigid with the horror of it, and with the\r\nghost of a hoarse scream in his throat.\r\n\r\nHe left the actual head behind at Bathurst, where he changed ship for\r\nTeneriffe, but not his dreams nor the dull ache in his bones. At\r\nTeneriffe Pollock transferred to a Cape liner, but the head followed\r\nhim. He gambled, he tried chess, he even read books; but he knew the\r\ndanger of drink. Yet whenever a round black shadow, a round black object\r\ncame into his range, there he looked for the head, and—saw it. He knew\r\nclearly enough that his imagination was growing traitor to him, and yet\r\nat times it seemed the ship he sailed in, his fellow-passengers, the\r\nsailors, the wide sea, were all part of a filmy phantasmagoria that\r\nhung, scarcely veiling it, between him and a horrible real world. Then\r\nthe Porroh man, thrusting his diabolical face through that curtain, was\r\nthe one real and undeniable thing. At that he would get up and touch\r\nthings, taste something, gnaw something, burn his hand with a match, or\r\nrun a needle into himself.\r\n\r\nSo, struggling grimly and silently with his excited imagination, Pollock\r\nreached England. He landed at Southampton, and went on straight from\r\nWaterloo to his banker’s in Cornhill in a cab. There he transacted some\r\nbusiness with the manager in a private room; and all the while the head\r\nhung like an ornament under the black marble mantel and dripped upon the\r\nfender. He could hear the drops fall, and see the red on the fender.\r\n\r\n“A pretty fern,” said the manager, following his eyes. “But it makes the\r\nfender rusty.”\r\n\r\n“Very,” said Pollock; “a _very_ pretty fern. And that reminds me. Can\r\nyou recommend me a physician for mind troubles? I’ve got a little—what\r\nis it?—hallucination.”\r\n\r\nThe head laughed savagely, wildly. Pollock was surprised the manager did\r\nnot notice it. But the manager only stared at his face.\r\n\r\nWith the address of a doctor, Pollock presently emerged in Cornhill.\r\nThere was no cab in sight, and so he went on down to the western end of\r\nthe street, and essayed the crossing opposite the Mansion House. The\r\ncrossing is hardly easy even for the expert Londoner; cabs, vans,\r\ncarriages, mailcarts, omnibuses go by in one incessant stream; to any\r\none fresh from the malarious solitudes of Sierra Leone it is a boiling,\r\nmaddening confusion. But when an inverted head suddenly comes bouncing,\r\nlike an india-rubber ball, between your legs, leaving distinct smears of\r\nblood every time it touches the ground, you can scarcely hope to avoid\r\nan accident. Pollock lifted his feet convulsively to avoid it, and then\r\nkicked at the thing furiously. Then something hit him violently in the\r\nback, and a hot pain ran up his arm.\r\n\r\nHe had been hit by the pole of an omnibus, and three of the fingers of\r\nhis left hand smashed by the hoof of one of the horses,—the very\r\nfingers, as it happened, that he shot from the Porroh man. They pulled\r\nhim out from between the horses’ legs, and found the address of the\r\nphysician in his crushed hand.\r\n\r\nFor a couple of days Pollock’s sensations were full of the sweet,\r\npungent smell of chloroform, of painful operations that caused him no\r\npain, of lying still and being given food and drink. Then he had a\r\nslight fever, and was very thirsty, and his old nightmare came back. It\r\nwas only when it returned that he noticed it had left him for a day.\r\n\r\n“If my skull had been smashed instead of my fingers, it might have gone\r\naltogether,” said Pollock, staring thoughtfully at the dark cushion that\r\nhad taken on for the time the shape of the head.\r\n\r\nPollock at the first opportunity told the physician of his mind trouble.\r\nHe knew clearly that he must go mad unless something should intervene to\r\nsave him. He explained that he had witnessed a decapitation in Dahomey,\r\nand was haunted by one of the heads. Naturally, he did not care to state\r\nthe actual facts. The physician looked grave.\r\n\r\nPresently he spoke hesitatingly. “As a child, did you get very much\r\nreligious training?”\r\n\r\n“Very little,” said Pollock.\r\n\r\nA shade passed over the physician’s face. “I don’t know if you have\r\nheard of the miraculous cures—it may be, of course, they are not\r\nmiraculous—at Lourdes.”\r\n\r\n“Faith-healing will hardly suit me, I am afraid,” said Pollock, with his\r\neye on the dark cushion.\r\n\r\nThe head distorted its scarred features in an abominable grimace. The\r\nphysician went upon a new track. “It’s all imagination,” he said,\r\nspeaking with sudden briskness. “A fair case for faith-healing, anyhow.\r\nYour nervous system has run down, you’re in that twilight state of\r\nhealth when the bogles come easiest. The strong impression was too much\r\nfor you. I must make you up a little mixture that will strengthen your\r\nnervous system—especially your brain. And you must take exercise.”\r\n\r\n“I’m no good for faith-healing,” said Pollock.\r\n\r\n“And therefore we must restore tone. Go in search of stimulating\r\nair—Scotland, Norway, the Alps—”\r\n\r\n“Jericho, if you like,” said Pollock, “where Naaman went.”\r\n\r\nHowever, so soon as his fingers would let him, Pollock made a gallant\r\nattempt to follow out the doctor’s suggestion. It was now November. He\r\ntried football; but to Pollock the game consisted in kicking a furious\r\ninverted head about a field. He was no good at the game. He kicked\r\nblindly, with a kind of horror, and when they put him back into goal,\r\nand the ball came swooping down upon him, he suddenly yelled and got out\r\nof its way. The discreditable stories that had driven him from England\r\nto wander in the tropics shut him off from any but men’s society, and\r\nnow his increasingly strange behaviour made even his man friends avoid\r\nhim. The thing was no longer a thing of the eye merely; it gibbered at\r\nhim, spoke to him. A horrible fear came upon him that presently, when he\r\ntook hold of the apparition, it would no longer become some mere article\r\nof furniture, but would _feel_ like a real dissevered head. Alone, he\r\nwould curse at the thing, defy it, entreat it; once or twice, in spite\r\nof his grim self-control, he addressed it in the presence of others. He\r\nfelt the growing suspicion in the eyes of the people that watched\r\nhim,—his landlady, the servant, his man.\r\n\r\nOne day early in December his cousin Arnold—his next of kin—came to see\r\nhim and draw him out, and watch his sunken, yellow face with narrow,\r\neager eyes. And it seemed to Pollock that the hat his cousin carried in\r\nhis hand was no hat at all, but a Gorgon head that glared at him upside\r\ndown, and fought with its eyes against his reason. However, he was still\r\nresolute to see the matter out. He got a bicycle, and, riding over the\r\nfrosty road from Wandsworth to Kingston, found the thing rolling along\r\nat his side, and leaving a dark trail behind it. He set his teeth and\r\nrode faster. Then suddenly, as he came down the hill towards Richmond\r\nPark, the apparition rolled in front of him and under his wheel, so\r\nquickly that he had no time for thought, and, turning quickly to avoid\r\nit, was flung violently against a heap of stones and broke his left\r\nwrist.\r\n\r\nThe end came on Christmas morning. All night he had been in a fever, the\r\nbandages encircling his wrist like a band of fire, his dreams more vivid\r\nand terrible than ever. In the cold, colourless, uncertain light that\r\ncame before the sunrise, he sat up in his bed, and saw the head upon the\r\nbracket in the place of the bronze jar that had stood there overnight.\r\n\r\n“I know that is a bronze jar,” he said, with a chill doubt at his heart.\r\nPresently the doubt was irresistible. He got out of bed slowly,\r\nshivering, and advanced to the jar with his hand raised. Surely he would\r\nsee now his imagination had deceived him, recognise the distinctive\r\nsheen of bronze. At last, after an age of hesitation, his fingers came\r\ndown on the patterned cheek of the head. He withdrew them spasmodically.\r\nThe last stage was reached. His sense of touch had betrayed him.\r\n\r\nTrembling, stumbling against the bed, kicking against his shoes with his\r\nbare feet, a dark confusion eddying round him, he groped his way to the\r\ndressing-table, took his razor from the drawer, and sat down on the bed\r\nwith this in his hand. In the looking-glass he saw his own face,\r\ncolourless, haggard, full of the ultimate bitterness of despair.\r\n\r\nHe beheld in swift succession the incidents in the brief tale of his\r\nexperience. His wretched home, his still more wretched schooldays, the\r\nyears of vicious life he had led since then, one act of selfish\r\ndishonour leading to another; it was all clear and pitiless now, all its\r\nsqualid folly, in the cold light of the dawn. He came to the hut, to the\r\nfight with the Porroh man, to the retreat down the river to Sulyma, to\r\nthe Mendi assassin and his red parcel, to his frantic endeavours to\r\ndestroy the head, to the growth of his hallucination. It was a\r\nhallucination! He _knew_ it was. A hallucination merely. For a moment he\r\nsnatched at hope. He looked away from the glass, and on the bracket, the\r\ninverted head grinned and grimaced at him—With the stiff fingers of his\r\nbandaged hand he felt at his neck for the throb of his arteries. The\r\nmorning was very cold, the steel blade felt like ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SEA RAIDERS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nUntil the extraordinary affair at Sidmouth, the peculiar species\r\n_Haploteuthis ferox_ was known to science only generically, on the\r\nstrength of a half-digested tentacle obtained near the Azores, and a\r\ndecaying body pecked by birds and nibbled by fish, found early in 1896\r\nby Mr. Jennings, near Land’s End.\r\n\r\nIn no department of zoölogical science, indeed, are we quite so much in\r\nthe dark as with regard to the deep-sea cephalopods. A mere accident,\r\nfor instance, it was that led to the Prince of Monaco’s discovery of\r\nnearly a dozen new forms in the summer of 1895, a discovery in which the\r\nbefore-mentioned tentacle was included. It chanced that a cachalot was\r\nkilled off Terceira by some sperm-whalers, and in its last struggles\r\ncharged almost to the Prince’s yacht, missed it, rolled under, and died\r\nwithin twenty yards of his rudder. And in its agony it threw up a number\r\nof large objects, which the Prince, dimly perceiving they were strange\r\nand important, was, by a happy expedient, able to secure before they\r\nsank. He set his screws in motion, and kept them circling in the\r\nvortices thus created until a boat could be lowered. And these specimens\r\nwere whole cephalopods and fragments of cephalopods, some of gigantic\r\nproportions, and almost all of them unknown to science!\r\n\r\nIt would seem, indeed, that these large and agile creatures, living in\r\nthe middle depths of the sea, must, to a large extent, for ever remain\r\nunknown to us, since under water they are too nimble for nets, and it is\r\nonly by such rare unlooked-for accidents that specimens can be obtained.\r\nIn the case of _Haploteuthis ferox_, for instance, we are still\r\naltogether ignorant of its habitat, as ignorant as we are of the\r\nbreeding-ground of the herring or the sea-ways of the salmon. And\r\nzoölogists are altogether at a loss to account for its sudden appearance\r\non our coast. Possibly it was the stress of a hunger migration that\r\ndrove it hither out of the deep. But it will be, perhaps, better to\r\navoid necessarily inconclusive discussion, and to proceed at once with\r\nour narrative.\r\n\r\nThe first human being to set eyes upon a living _Haploteuthis_—the first\r\nhuman being to survive, that is, for there can be little doubt now that\r\nthe wave of bathing fatalities and boating accidents that travelled\r\nalong the coast of Cornwall and Devon in early May was due to this\r\ncause—was a retired tea-dealer of the name of Fison, who was stopping at\r\na Sidmouth boarding-house. It was in the afternoon, and he was walking\r\nalong the cliff path between Sidmouth and Ladram Bay. The cliffs in this\r\ndirection are very high, but down the red face of them in one place a\r\nkind of ladder staircase has been made. He was near this when his\r\nattention was attracted by what at first he thought to be a cluster of\r\nbirds struggling over a fragment of food that caught the sunlight, and\r\nglistened pinkish-white. The tide was right out, and this object was not\r\nonly far below him, but remote across a broad waste of rock reefs\r\ncovered with dark seaweed and interspersed with silvery, shining, tidal\r\npools. And he was, moreover, dazzled by the brightness of the further\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn a minute, regarding this again, he perceived that his judgment was in\r\nfault, for over this struggle circled a number of birds, jackdaws and\r\ngulls for the most part, the latter gleaming blindingly when the\r\nsunlight smote their wings, and they seemed minute in comparison with\r\nit. And his curiosity was, perhaps, aroused all the more strongly\r\nbecause of his first insufficient explanations.\r\n\r\nAs he had nothing better to do than amuse himself, he decided to make\r\nthis object, whatever it was, the goal of his afternoon walk, instead of\r\nLadram Bay, conceiving it might perhaps be a great fish of some sort,\r\nstranded by some chance, and flapping about in its distress. And so he\r\nhurried down the long steep ladder, stopping at intervals of thirty feet\r\nor so to take breath and scan the mysterious movement.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the cliff he was, of course, nearer his object than he\r\nhad been; but, on the other hand, it now came up against the\r\nincandescent sky, beneath the sun, so as to seem dark and indistinct.\r\nWhatever was pinkish of it was now hidden by a skerry of weedy boulders.\r\nBut he perceived that it was made up of seven rounded bodies, distinct\r\nor connected, and that the birds kept up a constant croaking and\r\nscreaming, but seemed afraid to approach it too closely.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison, torn by curiosity, began picking his way across the wave-worn\r\nrocks, and, finding the wet seaweed that covered them thickly rendered\r\nthem extremely slippery, he stopped, removed his shoes and socks, and\r\ncoiled his trousers above his knees. His object was, of course, merely\r\nto avoid stumbling into the rocky pools about him, and perhaps he was\r\nrather glad, as all men are, of an excuse to resume, even for a moment,\r\nthe sensations of his boyhood. At any rate, it is to this, no doubt,\r\nthat he owes his life.\r\n\r\nHe approached his mark with all the assurance which the absolute\r\nsecurity of this country against all forms of animal life gives its\r\ninhabitants. The round bodies moved to and fro, but it was only when he\r\nsurmounted the skerry of boulders I have mentioned that he realised the\r\nhorrible nature of the discovery. It came upon him with some suddenness.\r\n\r\nThe rounded bodies fell apart as he came into sight over the ridge, and\r\ndisplayed the pinkish object to be the partially devoured body of a\r\nhuman being, but whether of a man or woman he was unable to say. And the\r\nrounded bodies were new and ghastly-looking creatures, in shape somewhat\r\nresembling an octopus, and with huge and very long and flexible\r\ntentacles, coiled copiously on the ground. The skin had a glistening\r\ntexture, unpleasant to see, like shiny leather. The downward bend of the\r\ntentacle-surrounded mouth, the curious excrescence at the bend, the\r\ntentacles, and the large, intelligent eyes, gave the creatures a\r\ngrotesque suggestion of a face. They were the size of a fair-sized swine\r\nabout the body, and the tentacles seemed to him to be many feet in\r\nlength. There were, he thinks, seven or eight at least of the creatures.\r\nTwenty yards beyond them, amid the surf of the now returning tide, two\r\nothers were emerging from the sea.\r\n\r\nTheir bodies lay flatly on the rocks, and their eyes regarded him with\r\nevil interest; but it does not appear that Mr. Fison was afraid, or that\r\nhe realised that he was in any danger. Possibly his confidence is to be\r\nascribed to the limpness of their attitudes. But he was horrified, of\r\ncourse, and intensely excited and indignant at such revolting creatures\r\npreying upon human flesh. He thought they had chanced upon a drowned\r\nbody. He shouted to them, with the idea of driving them off, and,\r\nfinding they did not budge, cast about him, picked up a big rounded lump\r\nof rock, and flung it at one.\r\n\r\nAnd then, slowly uncoiling their tentacles, they all began moving\r\ntowards him—creeping at first deliberately, and making a soft, purring\r\nsound to each other.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Mr. Fison realised that he was in danger. He shouted again,\r\nthrew both his boots, and started off, with a leap, forthwith. Twenty\r\nyards off he stopped and faced about, judging them slow, and, behold!\r\nthe tentacles of their leader were already pouring over the rocky ridge\r\non which he had just been standing!\r\n\r\nAt that he shouted again, but this time not threatening, but a cry of\r\ndismay, and began jumping, striding, slipping, wading across the uneven\r\nexpanse between him and the beach. The tall red cliffs seemed suddenly\r\nat a vast distance, and he saw, as though they were creatures in another\r\nworld, two minute workmen engaged in the repair of the ladder-way, and\r\nlittle suspecting the race for life that was beginning below them. At\r\none time he could hear the creatures splashing in the pools not a dozen\r\nfeet behind him, and once he slipped and almost fell.\r\n\r\nThey chased him to the very foot of the cliffs, and desisted only when\r\nhe had been joined by the workmen at the foot of the ladder-way up the\r\ncliff. All three of the men pelted them with stones for a time, and then\r\nhurried to the cliff top and along the path towards Sidmouth, to secure\r\nassistance and a boat, and to rescue the desecrated body from the\r\nclutches of these abominable creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nAnd, as if he had not already been in sufficient peril that day, Mr.\r\nFison went with the boat to point out the exact spot of his adventure.\r\n\r\nAs the tide was down, it required a considerable detour to reach the\r\nspot, and when at last they came off the ladder-way, the mangled body\r\nhad disappeared. The water was now running in, submerging first one slab\r\nof slimy rock and then another, and the four men in the boat—the\r\nworkmen, that is, the boatman, and Mr. Fison—now turned their attention\r\nfrom the bearings off shore to the water beneath the keel.\r\n\r\nAt first they could see little below them, save a dark jungle of\r\nlaminaria, with an occasional darting fish. Their minds were set on\r\nadventure, and they expressed their disappointment freely. But presently\r\nthey saw one of the monsters swimming through the water seaward, with a\r\ncurious rolling motion that suggested to Mr. Fison the spinning roll of\r\na captive balloon. Almost immediately after, the waving streamers of\r\nlaminaria were extraordinarily perturbed, parted for a moment, and three\r\nof these beasts became darkly visible, struggling for what was probably\r\nsome fragment of the drowned man. In a moment the copious olive-green\r\nribbons had poured again over this writhing group.\r\n\r\nAt that all four men, greatly excited, began beating the water with oars\r\nand shouting, and immediately they saw a tumultuous movement among the\r\nweeds. They desisted, to see more clearly, and as soon as the water was\r\nsmooth, they saw, as it seemed to them, the whole sea bottom among the\r\nweeds set with eyes.\r\n\r\n“Ugly swine!” cried one of the men. “Why, there’s dozens!”\r\n\r\nAnd forthwith the things began to rise through the water about them. Mr.\r\nFison has since described to the writer this startling eruption out of\r\nthe waving laminaria meadows. To him it seemed to occupy a considerable\r\ntime, but it is probable that really it was an affair of a few seconds\r\nonly. For a time nothing but eyes, and then he speaks of tentacles\r\nstreaming out and parting the weed fronds this way and that. Then these\r\nthings, growing larger, until at last the bottom was hidden by their\r\nintercoiling forms, and the tips of tentacles rose darkly here and there\r\ninto the air above the swell of the waters.\r\n\r\nOne came up boldly to the side of the boat, and, clinging to this with\r\nthree of its sucker-set tentacles, threw four others over the gunwale,\r\nas if with an intention either of oversetting the boat or of clambering\r\ninto it. Mr. Fison at once caught up the boathook, and, jabbing\r\nfuriously at the soft tentacles, forced it to desist. He was struck in\r\nthe back and almost pitched overboard by the boatman, who was using his\r\noar to resist a similar attack on the other side of the boat. But the\r\ntentacles on either side at once relaxed their hold at this, slid out of\r\nsight, and splashed into the water.\r\n\r\n“We’d better get out of this,” said Mr. Fison, who was trembling\r\nviolently. He went to the tiller, while the boatman and one of the\r\nworkmen seated themselves and began rowing. The other workman stood up\r\nin the fore part of the boat, with the boathook, ready to strike any\r\nmore tentacles that might appear. Nothing else seems to have been said.\r\nMr. Fison had expressed the common feeling beyond amendment. In a\r\nhushed, scared mood, with faces white and drawn, they set about escaping\r\nfrom the position into which they had so recklessly blundered.\r\n\r\nBut the oars had scarcely dropped into the water before dark, tapering,\r\nserpentine ropes had bound them, and were about the rudder; and creeping\r\nup the sides of the boat with a looping motion came the suckers again.\r\nThe men gripped their oars and pulled, but it was like trying to move a\r\nboat in a floating raft of weeds. “Help here!” cried the boatman, and\r\nMr. Fison and the second workman rushed to help lug at the oar.\r\n\r\nThen the man with the boathook—his name was Ewan, or Ewen—sprang up with\r\na curse, and began striking downward over the side, as far as he could\r\nreach, at the bank of tentacles that now clustered along the boat’s\r\nbottom. And, at the same time, the two rowers stood up to get a better\r\npurchase for the recovery of their oars. The boatman handed his to Mr.\r\nFison, who lugged desperately, and, meanwhile, the boatman opened a big\r\nclasp-knife, and, leaning over the side of the boat, began hacking at\r\nthe spiring arms upon the oar shaft.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison, staggering with the quivering rocking of the boat, his teeth\r\nset, his breath coming short, and the veins starting on his hands as he\r\npulled at his oar, suddenly cast his eyes seaward. And there, not fifty\r\nyards off, across the long rollers of the incoming tide, was a large\r\nboat standing in towards them, with three women and a little child in\r\nit. A boatman was rowing, and a little man in a pink-ribboned straw hat\r\nand whites stood in the stern, hailing them. For a moment, of course,\r\nMr. Fison thought of help, and then he thought of the child. He\r\nabandoned his oar forthwith, threw up his arms in a frantic gesture, and\r\nscreamed to the party in the boat to keep away “for God’s sake!” It says\r\nmuch for the modesty and courage of Mr. Fison that he does not seem to\r\nbe aware that there was any quality of heroism in his action at this\r\njuncture. The oar he had abandoned was at once drawn under, and\r\npresently reappeared floating about twenty yards away.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment Mr. Fison felt the boat under him lurch violently,\r\nand a hoarse scream, a prolonged cry of terror from Hill, the boatman,\r\ncaused him to forget the party of excursionists altogether. He turned,\r\nand saw Hill crouching by the forward rowlock, his face convulsed with\r\nterror, and his right arm over the side and drawn tightly down. He gave\r\nnow a succession of short, sharp cries, “Oh! oh! oh!—oh!” Mr. Fison\r\nbelieves that he must have been hacking at the tentacles below the\r\nwater-line, and have been grasped by them, but, of course, it is quite\r\nimpossible to say now certainly what had happened. The boat was heeling\r\nover, so that the gunwale was within ten inches of the water, and both\r\nEwan and the other labourer were striking down into the water, with oar\r\nand boathook, on either side of Hill’s arm. Mr. Fison instinctively\r\nplaced himself to counterpoise them.\r\n\r\nThen Hill, who was a burly, powerful man, made a strenuous effort, and\r\nrose almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out\r\nof the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes; and\r\nthe eyes of one of the brutes that had hold of him, glaring straight and\r\nresolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled more and\r\nmore, and the green-brown water came pouring in a cascade over the side.\r\nThen Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and his arm\r\nand the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water. He\r\nrolled over; his boot kicked Mr. Fison’s knee as that gentleman rushed\r\nforward to seize him, and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped\r\nabout his waist and neck, and after a brief, convulsive struggle, in\r\nwhich the boat was nearly capsized, Hill was lugged overboard. The boat\r\nrighted with a violent jerk that all but sent Mr. Fison over the other\r\nside, and hid the struggle in the water from his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe stood staggering to recover his balance for a moment, and as he did\r\nso, he became aware that the struggle and the inflowing tide had carried\r\nthem close upon the weedy rocks again. Not four yards off a table of\r\nrock still rose in rhythmic movements above the in-wash of the tide. In\r\na moment Mr. Fison seized the oar from Ewan, gave one vigorous stroke,\r\nthen, dropping it, ran to the bows and leapt. He felt his feet slide\r\nover the rock, and, by a frantic effort, leapt again towards a further\r\nmass. He stumbled over this, came to his knees, and rose again.\r\n\r\n“Look out!” cried some one, and a large drab body struck him. He was\r\nknocked flat into a tidal pool by one of the workmen, and as he went\r\ndown he heard smothered, choking cries, that he believed at the time\r\ncame from Hill. Then he found himself marvelling at the shrillness and\r\nvariety of Hill’s voice. Some one jumped over him, and a curving rush of\r\nfoamy water poured over him, and passed. He scrambled to his feet,\r\ndripping, and, without looking seaward, ran as fast as his terror would\r\nlet him shoreward. Before him, over the flat space of scattered rocks,\r\nstumbled the two workmen—one a dozen yards in front of the other.\r\n\r\nHe looked over his shoulder at last, and, seeing that he was not\r\npursued, faced about. He was astonished. From the moment of the rising\r\nof the cephalopods out of the water, he had been acting too swiftly to\r\nfully comprehend his actions. Now it seemed to him as if he had suddenly\r\njumped out of an evil dream.\r\n\r\nFor there were the sky, cloudless and blazing with the afternoon sun,\r\nthe sea, weltering under its pitiless brightness, the soft creamy foam\r\nof the breaking water, and the low, long, dark ridges of rock. The\r\nrighted boat floated, rising and falling gently on the swell about a\r\ndozen yards from shore. Hill and the monsters, all the stress and tumult\r\nof that fierce fight for life, had vanished as though they had never\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nMr. Fison’s heart was beating violently; he was throbbing to the\r\nfinger-tips, and his breath came deep.\r\n\r\nThere was something missing. For some seconds he could not think clearly\r\nenough what this might be. Sun, sky, sea, rocks—what was it? Then he\r\nremembered the boatload of excursionists. It had vanished. He wondered\r\nwhether he had imagined it. He turned, and saw the two workmen standing\r\nside by side under the projecting masses of the tall pink cliffs. He\r\nhesitated whether he should make one last attempt to save the man Hill.\r\nHis physical excitement seemed to desert him suddenly, and leave him\r\naimless and helpless. He turned shoreward, stumbling and wading towards\r\nhis two companions.\r\n\r\nHe looked back again, and there were now two boats floating, and the one\r\nfarthest out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nSo it was _Haploteuthis ferox_ made its appearance upon the Devonshire\r\ncoast. So far, this has been its most serious aggression. Mr. Fison’s\r\naccount, taken together with the wave of boating and bathing casualties\r\nto which I have already alluded, and the absence of fish from the\r\nCornish coasts that year, points clearly to a shoal of these voracious\r\ndeep-sea monsters prowling slowly along the sub-tidal coast-line. Hunger\r\nmigration has, I know, been suggested as the force that drove them\r\nhither; but, for my own part, I prefer to believe the alternative theory\r\nof Hemsley. Hemsley holds that a pack or shoal of these creatures may\r\nhave become enamoured of human flesh by the accident of a foundered ship\r\nsinking among them, and have wandered in search of it out of their\r\naccustomed zone; first waylaying and following ships, and so coming to\r\nour shores in the wake of the Atlantic traffic. But to discuss Hemsley’s\r\ncogent and admirably-stated arguments would be out of place here.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the appetites of the shoal were satisfied by the\r\ncatch of eleven people—for so far as can be ascertained, there were ten\r\npeople in the second boat, and certainly these creatures gave no further\r\nsigns of their presence off Sidmouth that day. The coast between Seaton\r\nand Budleigh Salterton was patrolled all that evening and night by four\r\nPreventive Service boats, the men in which were armed with harpoons and\r\ncutlasses, and as the evening advanced, a number of more or less\r\nsimilarly equipped expeditions, organised by private individuals, joined\r\nthem. Mr. Fison took no part in any of these expeditions.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight excited hails were heard from a boat about a couple of\r\nmiles out at sea to the south-east of Sidmouth, and a lantern was seen\r\nwaving in a strange manner to and fro and up and down. The nearer boats\r\nat once hurried towards the alarm. The venturesome occupants of the\r\nboat, a seaman, a curate, and two schoolboys, had actually seen the\r\nmonsters passing under their boat. The creatures, it seems, like most\r\ndeep-sea organisms, were phosphorescent, and they had been floating,\r\nfive fathoms deep or so, like creatures of moonshine through the\r\nblackness of the water, their tentacles retracted and as if asleep,\r\nrolling over and over, and moving slowly in a wedge-like formation\r\ntowards the south-east.\r\n\r\nThese people told their story in gesticulated fragments, as first one\r\nboat drew alongside and then another. At last there was a little fleet\r\nof eight or nine boats collected together, and from them a tumult, like\r\nthe chatter of a marketplace, rose into the stillness of the night.\r\nThere was little or no disposition to pursue the shoal, the people had\r\nneither weapons nor experience for such a dubious chase, and\r\npresently—even with a certain relief, it may be—the boats turned\r\nshoreward.\r\n\r\nAnd now to tell what is perhaps the most astonishing fact in this whole\r\nastonishing raid. We have not the slightest knowledge of the subsequent\r\nmovements of the shoal, although the whole southwest coast was now alert\r\nfor it. But it may, perhaps, be significant that a cachalot was stranded\r\noff Sark on June 3. Two weeks and three days after this Sidmouth affair,\r\na living _Haploteuthis_ came ashore on Calais sands. It was alive,\r\nbecause several witnesses saw its tentacles moving in a convulsive way.\r\nBut it is probable that it was dying. A gentleman named Pouchet obtained\r\na rifle and shot it.\r\n\r\nThat was the last appearance of a living _Haploteuthis_. No others were\r\nseen on the French coast. On the 15th of June a dead body, almost\r\ncomplete, was washed ashore near Torquay, and a few days later a boat\r\nfrom the Marine Biological station, engaged in dredging off Plymouth,\r\npicked up a rotting specimen, slashed deeply with a cutlass wound. How\r\nthe former specimen had come by its death it is impossible to say. And\r\non the last day of June, Mr. Egbert Caine, an artist, bathing near\r\nNewlyn, threw up his arms, shrieked, and was drawn under. A friend\r\nbathing with him made no attempt to save him, but swam at once for the\r\nshore. This is the last fact to tell of this extraordinary raid from the\r\ndeeper sea. Whether it is really the last of these horrible creatures it\r\nis, as yet, premature to say. But it is believed, and certainly it is to\r\nbe hoped, that they have returned now, and returned for good, to the\r\nsunless depths of the middle seas, out of which they have so strangely\r\nand so mysteriously arisen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN THE MODERN VEIN\r\n                      AN UNSYMPATHETIC LOVE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the cultivated reader has heard of Aubrey Vair. He has\r\npublished on three several occasions volumes of delicate verses,—some,\r\nindeed, border on indelicacy,—and his column “Of Things Literary” in the\r\n“Climax” is well known. His Byronic visage and an interview have\r\nappeared in the “Perfect Lady.” It was Aubrey Vair, I believe, who\r\ndemonstrated that the humour of Dickens was worse than his sentiment,\r\nand who detected “a subtle bourgeois flavour” in Shakespeare. However,\r\nit is not generally known that Aubrey Vair has had erotic experiences as\r\nwell as erotic inspirations. He adopted Goethe some little time since as\r\nhis literary prototype, and that may have had something to do with his\r\ntemporary lapse from sexual integrity.\r\n\r\nFor it is one of the commonest things that undermine literary men,\r\ngiving us landslips and picturesque effects along the otherwise even\r\ncliff of their respectable life, ranking next to avarice, and certainly\r\nabove drink, this instability called genius, or, more fully, the\r\nconsciousness of genius, such as Aubrey Vair possessed. Since Shelley\r\nset the fashion, your man of gifts has been assured that his duty to\r\nhimself and his duty to his wife are incompatible, and his renunciation\r\nof the Philistine has been marked by such infidelity as his means and\r\ncourage warranted. Most virtue is lack of imagination. At any rate, a\r\nminor genius without his affections twisted into an inextricable muddle,\r\nand who did not occasionally shed sonnets over his troubles, I have\r\nnever met.\r\n\r\nEven Aubrey Vair did this, weeping the sonnets overnight into his\r\nblotting-book, and pretending to write literary _causerie_ when his wife\r\ncame down in her bath slippers to see what kept him up. She did not\r\nunderstand him, of course. He did this even before the other woman\r\nappeared, so ingrained is conjugal treachery in the talented mind.\r\nIndeed, he wrote more sonnets before the other woman came than after\r\nthat event, because thereafter he spent much of his leisure in cutting\r\ndown the old productions, retrimming them, and generally altering this\r\nready-made clothing of his passion to suit her particular height and\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair lived in a little red villa with a lawn at the back and a\r\nview of the Downs behind Reigate. He lived upon discreet investment eked\r\nout by literary work. His wife was handsome, sweet, and gentle, and—such\r\nis the tender humility of good married women—she found her life’s\r\nhappiness in seeing that little Aubrey Vair had well-cooked variety for\r\ndinner, and that their house was the neatest and brightest of all the\r\nhouses they entered. Aubrey Vair enjoyed the dinners, and was proud of\r\nthe house, yet nevertheless he mourned because his genius dwindled.\r\nMoreover, he grew plump, and corpulence threatened him.\r\n\r\nWe learn in suffering what we teach in song, and Aubrey Vair knew\r\ncertainly that his soul could give no creditable crops unless his\r\naffections were harrowed. And how to harrow them was the trouble, for\r\nReigate is a moral neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nSo Aubrey Vair’s romantic longings blew loose for a time, much as a\r\nseedling creeper might, planted in the midst of a flower-bed. But at\r\nlast, in the fulness of time, the other woman came to the embrace of\r\nAubrey Vair’s yearning heart-tendrils, and his romantic episode\r\nproceeded as is here faithfully written down.\r\n\r\nThe other woman was really a girl, and Aubrey Vair met her first at a\r\ntennis party at Redhill. Aubrey Vair did not play tennis after the\r\naccident to Miss Morton’s eye, and because latterly it made him pant and\r\nget warmer and moister than even a poet should be; and this young lady\r\nhad only recently arrived in England, and could not play. So they\r\ngravitated into the two vacant basket chairs beside Mrs. Bayne’s deaf\r\naunt, in front of the hollyhocks, and were presently talking at their\r\nease together.\r\n\r\nThe other woman’s name was unpropitious,—Miss Smith,—but you would never\r\nhave suspected it from her face and costume. Her parentage was\r\npromising, she was an orphan, her mother was a Hindoo, and her father an\r\nIndian civil servant; and Aubrey Vair—himself a happy mixture of Kelt\r\nand Teuton, as, indeed, all literary men have to be nowadays—naturally\r\nbelieved in the literary consequences of a mixture of races. She was\r\ndressed in white. She had finely moulded, pale features, great depth of\r\nexpression, and a cloud of delicately _frisé_ black hair over her dark\r\neyes, and she looked at Aubrey Vair with a look half curious and half\r\nshy, that contrasted admirably with the stereotyped frankness of your\r\ncommon Reigate girl.\r\n\r\n“This is a splendid lawn—the best in Redhill,” said Aubrey Vair, in the\r\ncourse of the conversation; “and I like it all the better because the\r\ndaisies are spared.” He indicated the daisies with a graceful sweep of\r\nhis rather elegant hand.\r\n\r\n“They are sweet little flowers,” said the lady in white, “and I have\r\nalways associated them with England, chiefly, perhaps, through a picture\r\nI saw ‘over there’ when I was very little, of children making daisy\r\nchains. I promised myself that pleasure when I came home. But, alas! I\r\nfeel now rather too large for such delights.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see why we should not be able to enjoy these simple pleasures\r\nas we grow older—why our growth should have in it so much forgetting.\r\nFor my own part—”\r\n\r\n“Has your wife got Jane’s recipe for stuffing trout?” asked Mrs. Bayne’s\r\ndeaf aunt, abruptly.\r\n\r\n“I really don’t know,” said Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” said Mrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt. “It ought to please\r\neven you.”\r\n\r\n“Anything will please me,” said Aubrey Vair; “I care very little—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s a lovely dish,” said Mrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt, and relapsed into\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\n“I was saying,” said Aubrey Vair, “that I think I still find my keenest\r\npleasures in childish pastimes. I have a little nephew that I see a\r\ngreat deal of, and when we fly kites together, I am sure it would be\r\nhard to tell which of us is the happier. By-the-by, you should get at\r\nyour daisy chains in that way. Beguile some little girl.”\r\n\r\n“But I did. I took that Morton mite for a walk in the meadows, and\r\ntimidly broached the subject. And she reproached me for suggesting\r\n‘frivolous pursuits.’ It was a horrible disappointment.”\r\n\r\n“The governess here,” said Aubrey Vair, “is robbing that child of its\r\nyouth in a terrible way. What will a life be that has no childhood at\r\nthe beginning?\r\n\r\n“Some human beings are never young,” he continued, “and they never grow\r\nup. They lead absolutely colourless lives. They are—they are etiolated.\r\nThey never love, and never feel the loss of it. They are—for the moment\r\nI can think of no better image—they are human flowerpots, in which no\r\nsoul has been planted. But a human soul properly growing must begin in a\r\nfresh childishness.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the dark lady, thoughtfully, “a careless childhood, running\r\nwild almost. That should be the beginning.”\r\n\r\n“Then we pass through the wonder and diffidence of youth.”\r\n\r\n“To strength and action,” said the dark lady. Her dreamy eyes were fixed\r\non the Downs, and her fingers tightened on her knees as she spoke. “Ah,\r\nit is a grand thing to live—as a man does—self-reliant and free.”\r\n\r\n“And so at last,” said Aubrey Vair, “come to the culmination and crown\r\nof life.” He paused and glanced hastily at her. Then he dropped his\r\nvoice almost to a whisper—“And the culmination of life is love.”\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met for a moment, but she looked away at once. Aubrey Vair\r\nfelt a peculiar thrill and a catching in his breath, but his emotions\r\nwere too complex for analysis. He had a certain sense of surprise, also,\r\nat the way his conversation had developed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt suddenly dug him in the chest with her\r\near-trumpet, and some one at tennis bawled, “Love all!”\r\n\r\n“Did I tell you Jane’s girls have had scarlet fever?” asked Mrs. Bayne’s\r\ndeaf aunt.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and they are peeling now,” said Mrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt, shutting\r\nher lips tightly, and nodding in a slow, significant manner at both of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. All three seemed lost in thought, too deep for words.\r\n\r\n“Love,” began Aubrey Vair, presently, in a severely philosophical tone,\r\nleaning back in his chair, holding his hands like a praying saint’s in\r\nfront of him, and staring at the toe of his shoe,—“love is, I believe,\r\nthe one true and real thing in life. It rises above reason, interest, or\r\nexplanation. Yet I never read of an age when it was so much forgotten as\r\nit is now. Never was love expected to run so much in appointed channels,\r\nnever was it so despised, checked, ordered, and obstructed. Policemen\r\nsay, ‘This way, Eros!’ As a result, we relieve our emotional\r\npossibilities in the hunt for gold and notoriety. And after all, with\r\nthe best fortune in these, we only hold up the gilded images of our\r\nsuccess, and are weary slaves, with unsatisfied hearts, in the pageant\r\nof life.”\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair sighed, and there was a pause. The girl looked at him out of\r\nthe mysterious darkness of her eyes. She had read many books, but Aubrey\r\nVair was her first literary man, and she took this kind of thing for\r\ngenius—as girls have done before.\r\n\r\n“We are,” continued Aubrey Vair, conscious of a favourable\r\nimpression,—“we are like fireworks, mere dead, inert things until the\r\nappointed spark comes; and then—if it is not damp—the dormant soul\r\nblazes forth in all its warmth and beauty. That is living. I sometimes\r\nthink, do you know, that we should be happier if we could die soon after\r\nthat golden time, like the Ephemerides. There is a decay sets in.”\r\n\r\n“Eigh?” said Mrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt, startlingly. “I didn’t hear you.”\r\n\r\n“I was on the point of remarking,” shouted Aubrey Vair, wheeling the\r\narray of his thoughts,—“I was on the point of remarking that few people\r\nin Redhill could match Mrs. Morton’s fine broad green.”\r\n\r\n“Others have noticed it,” Mrs. Bayne’s deaf aunt shouted back. “It is\r\nsince she has had in her new false teeth.”\r\n\r\nThis interruption dislocated the conversation a little. However—\r\n\r\n“I must thank you, Mr. Vair,” said the dark girl, when they parted that\r\nafternoon, “for having given me very much to think about.”\r\n\r\nAnd from her manner, Aubrey Vair perceived clearly he had not wasted his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would require a subtler pen than mine to tell how from that day a\r\npassion for Miss Smith grew like Jonah’s gourd in the heart of Aubrey\r\nVair. He became pensive, and in the prolonged absence of Miss Smith,\r\nirritable. Mrs. Aubrey Vair felt the change in him, and put it down to a\r\nvitriolic Saturday Reviewer. Indisputably the “Saturday” does at times\r\ngo a little far. He re-read “Elective Affinities,” and lent it to Miss\r\nSmith. Incredible as it may appear to members of the Areopagus Club,\r\nwhere we know Aubrey Vair, he did also beyond all question inspire a\r\nsort of passion in that sombre-eyed, rather clever, and really very\r\nbeautiful girl.\r\n\r\nHe talked to her a lot about love and destiny, and all that bric-à-brac\r\nof the minor poet. And they talked together about his genius. He\r\nelaborately, though discreetly, sought her society, and presented and\r\nread to her the milder of his unpublished sonnets. We consider his\r\nByronic features pasty, but the feminine mind has its own laws. I\r\nsuppose, also, where a girl is not a fool, a literary man has an\r\nenormous advantage over any one but a preacher, in the show he can make\r\nof his heart’s wares.\r\n\r\nAt last a day in that summer came when he met her alone, possibly by\r\nchance, in a quiet lane towards Horley. There were ample hedges on\r\neither side, rich with honeysuckle, vetch, and mullein.\r\n\r\nThey conversed intimately of his poetic ambitions, and then he read her\r\nthose verses of his subsequently published in “Hobson’s Magazine:”\r\n“Tenderly ever, since I have met thee.” He had written these the day\r\nbefore; and though I think the sentiment is uncommonly trite, there is a\r\nredeeming note of sincerity about the lines not conspicuous in all\r\nAubrey Vair’s poetry.\r\n\r\nHe read rather well, and a swell of genuine emotion crept into his voice\r\nas he read, with one white hand thrown out to point the rhythm of the\r\nlines. “Ever, my sweet, for thee,” he concluded, looking up into her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBefore he looked up, he had been thinking chiefly of his poem and its\r\neffect. Straightway he forgot it. Her arms hung limply before her, and\r\nher hands were clasped together. Her eyes were very tender.\r\n\r\n“Your verses go to the heart,” she said softly.\r\n\r\nHer mobile features were capable of wonderful shades of expression. He\r\nsuddenly forgot his wife and his position as a minor poet as he looked\r\nat her. It is possible that his classical features may themselves have\r\nundergone a certain transfiguration. For one brief moment—and it was\r\nalways to linger in his memory—destiny lifted him out of his vain little\r\nself to a nobler level of simplicity. The copy of “Tenderly ever”\r\nfluttered from his hand. Considerations vanished. Only one thing seemed\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\n“I love you,” he said abruptly.\r\n\r\nAn expression of fear came into her eyes. The grip of her hands upon one\r\nanother tightened convulsively. She became very pale.\r\n\r\nThen she moved her lips as if to speak, bringing her face slightly\r\nnearer to his. There was nothing in the world at that moment for either\r\nof them but one another. They were both trembling exceedingly. In a\r\nwhisper she said, “You love me?”\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair stood quivering and speechless, looking into her eyes. He\r\nhad never seen such a light as he saw there before. He was in a wild\r\ntumult of emotion. He was dreadfully scared at what he had done. He\r\ncould not say another word. He nodded.\r\n\r\n“And this has come to me?” she said presently, in the same awe-stricken\r\nwhisper, and then, “Oh, my love, my love!”\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon Aubrey Vair had her clasped to himself, her cheek upon his\r\nshoulder and his lips to hers.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Aubrey Vair came by the cardinal memory of his life. To\r\nthis day it recurs in his works.\r\n\r\nA little boy clambering in the hedge some way down the lane saw this\r\ngroup with surprise, and then with scorn and contempt. Recking nothing\r\nof his destiny, he turned away, feeling that he at least could never\r\ncome to the unspeakable unmanliness of hugging girls. Unhappily for\r\nReigate scandal, his shame for his sex was altogether too deep for\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour after, Aubrey Vair returned home in a hushed mood. There were\r\nmuffins after his own heart for his tea—Mrs. Aubrey Vair had had hers.\r\nAnd there were chrysanthemums, chiefly white ones,—flowers he loved,—set\r\nout in the china bowl he was wont to praise. And his wife came behind\r\nhim to kiss him as he sat eating.\r\n\r\n“De lill Jummuns,” she remarked, kissing him under the ear.\r\n\r\nThen it came into the mind of Aubrey Vair with startling clearness,\r\nwhile his ear was being kissed, and with his mouth full of muffin, that\r\nlife is a singularly complex thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer passed at last into the harvest-time, and the leaves began\r\nfalling. It was evening, the warm sunset light still touched the Downs,\r\nbut up the valley a blue haze was creeping. One or two lamps in Reigate\r\nwere already alight.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way up the slanting road that scales the Downs, there is a\r\nwooden seat where one may obtain a fine view of the red villas scattered\r\nbelow, and of the succession of blue hills beyond. Here the girl with\r\nthe shadowy face was sitting.\r\n\r\nShe had a book on her knees, but it lay neglected. She was leaning\r\nforward, her chin resting upon her hand. She was looking across the\r\nvalley into the darkening sky, with troubled eyes.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair appeared through the hazel-bushes, and sat down beside her.\r\nHe held half a dozen dead leaves in his hand.\r\n\r\nShe did not alter her attitude. “Well?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Is it to be flight?” he asked.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair was rather pale. He had been having bad nights latterly,\r\nwith dreams of the Continental Express Mrs. Aubrey Vair possibly even in\r\npursuit,—he always fancied her making the tragedy ridiculous by\r\ntearfully bringing additional pairs of socks, and any such trifles he\r\nhad forgotten, with her,—all Reigate and Redhill in commotion. He had\r\nnever eloped before, and he had visions of difficulties with hotel\r\nproprietors. Mrs. Aubrey Vair might telegraph ahead. Even he had had a\r\nprophetic vision of a headline in a halfpenny evening newspaper: “Young\r\nLady abducts a Minor Poet.” So there was a quaver in his voice as he\r\nasked, “Is it to be flight?”\r\n\r\n“As you will,” she answered, still not looking at him.\r\n\r\n“I want you to consider particularly how this will affect you. A man,”\r\nsaid Aubrey Vair, slowly, and staring hard at the leaves in his hand,\r\n“even gains a certain éclat in these affairs. But to a woman it is\r\nruin—social, moral.”\r\n\r\n“This is not love,” said the girl in white.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dearest! Think of yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Stupid!” she said, under her breath.\r\n\r\n“You spoke?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“But cannot we go on, meeting one another, loving one another, without\r\nany great scandal or misery? Could we not—”\r\n\r\n“That,” interrupted Miss Smith, “would be unspeakably horrible.”\r\n\r\n“This is a dreadful conversation to me. Life is so intricate, such a web\r\nof subtle strands binds us this way and that. I cannot tell what is\r\nright. You must consider—”\r\n\r\n“A man would break such strands.”\r\n\r\n“There is no manliness,” said Aubrey Vair, with a sudden glow of moral\r\nexaltation, “in doing wrong. My love—”\r\n\r\n“We could at least die together, dearest,” she said discontentedly.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” said Aubrey Vair. “I mean—consider my wife.”\r\n\r\n“You have not considered her hitherto.”\r\n\r\n“There is a flavour—of cowardice, of desertion, about suicide,” said\r\nAubrey Vair. “Frankly, I have the English prejudice, and do not like any\r\nkind of running away.”\r\n\r\nMiss Smith smiled very faintly. “I see clearly now what I did not see.\r\nMy love and yours are very different things.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly it is a sexual difference,” said Aubrey Vair; and then,\r\nfeeling the remark inadequate, he relapsed into silence.\r\n\r\nThey sat for some time without a word. The two lights in Reigate below\r\nmultiplied to a score of bright points, and, above, one star had become\r\nvisible. She began laughing, an almost noiseless, hysterical laugh that\r\njarred unaccountably upon Aubrey Vair.\r\n\r\nPresently she stood up. “They will wonder where I am,” she said. “I\r\nthink I must be going.”\r\n\r\nHe followed her to the road. “Then this is the end?” he said, with a\r\ncurious mixture of relief and poignant regret.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this is the end,” she answered, and turned away.\r\n\r\nThere straightway dropped into the soul of Aubrey Vair a sense of\r\ninfinite loss. It was an altogether new sensation. She was perhaps\r\ntwenty yards away, when he groaned aloud with the weight of it, and\r\nsuddenly began running after her with his arms extended.\r\n\r\n“Annie,” he cried,—“Annie! I have been talking _rot_. Annie, now I know\r\nI love you! I cannot spare you. This must not be. I did not understand.”\r\n\r\nThe weight was horrible.\r\n\r\n“Oh, stop, Annie!” he cried, with a breaking voice, and there were tears\r\non his face.\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him suddenly, with a look of annoyance, and his arms\r\nfell by his side. His expression changed at the sight of her pale face.\r\n\r\n“You do not understand,” she said. “I have said good-bye.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him; he was evidently greatly distressed, a little out of\r\nbreath, and he had just stopped blubbering. His contemptible quality\r\nreached the pathetic. She came up close to him, and, taking his damp\r\nByronic visage between her hands, she kissed him again and again.\r\n“Good-bye, little man that I loved,” she said; “and good-bye to this\r\nfolly of love.”\r\n\r\nThen, with something that may have been a laugh or a sob,—she herself,\r\nwhen she came to write it all in her novel, did not know which,—she\r\nturned and hurried away again, and went out of the path that Aubrey Vair\r\nmust pursue, at the cross-roads.\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair stood, where she had kissed him, with a mind as inactive as\r\nhis body, until her white dress had disappeared. Then he gave an\r\ninvoluntary sigh, a large, exhaustive expiration, and so awoke himself,\r\nand began walking, pensively dragging his feet through the dead leaves,\r\nhome. Emotions are terrible things.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you like the potatoes, dear?” asked Mrs. Aubrey Vair at dinner. “I\r\ncooked them myself.”\r\n\r\nAubrey Vair descended slowly from cloudy, impalpable meditations to the\r\nlevel of fried potatoes. “These potatoes—” he remarked, after a pause\r\nduring which he was struggling with recollection. “Yes. These potatoes\r\nhave exactly the tints of the dead leaves of the hazel.”\r\n\r\n“What a fanciful poet it is!” said Mrs. Aubrey Vair. “Taste them. They\r\nare very nice potatoes indeed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at\r\nCamberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire,\r\nand his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but fond\r\nof whiskey, a heavy red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He doubted\r\nthe existence of the deity, but accepted Carnot’s cycle, and he had read\r\nShakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came out of the\r\nmysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd called him\r\nPooh-bah. Holroyd liked a nigger help because he would stand kicking—a\r\nhabit with Holroyd—and did not pry into the machinery and try to learn\r\nthe ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind brought into\r\nabrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd never fully\r\nrealised, though just at the end he got some inkling of them.\r\n\r\nTo define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid\r\nthan anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and\r\nhis nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black,\r\nand the whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheek-bones and narrow\r\nchin gave his face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was broad\r\nbehind, and low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had been\r\ntwisted round in the reverse way to a European’s. He was short of\r\nstature and still shorter of English. In conversation he made numerous\r\nodd noises of no known marketable value, and his infrequent words were\r\ncarved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to\r\nelucidate his religious beliefs, and—especially after whiskey—lectured\r\nto him against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however, shirked\r\nthe discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for it.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the\r\nstoke-hole of the _Lord Clive_, from the Straits Settlements, and\r\nbeyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness and\r\nriches of London, where all the women are white and fair, and even the\r\nbeggars in the streets are white; and he had arrived, with newly earned\r\ngold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilisation. The\r\nday of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a wind-worried\r\ndrizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he plunged boldly into\r\nthe delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast up, shattered in\r\nhealth, civilised in costume, penniless, and, except in matters of the\r\ndirest necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for James Holroyd\r\nand to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at Camberwell. And to James\r\nHolroyd bullying was a labour of love.\r\n\r\nThere were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that\r\nhave been there since the beginning are small machines; the larger one\r\nwas new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps\r\nhummed over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and\r\nfizzled, and the air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their\r\npoles. One was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating. But\r\nthe big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the sustained\r\ndrone of its iron core, which somehow set part of the iron-work humming.\r\nThe place made the visitor’s head reel with the throb, throb, throb of\r\nthe engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the spinning ball-valves,\r\nthe occasional spittings of the steam, and over all the deep, unceasing,\r\nsurging note of the big dynamo. This last noise was from an engineering\r\npoint of view a defect; but Azuma-zi accounted it unto the monster for\r\nmightiness and pride.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about\r\nthe reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an\r\naccompaniment. It was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked\r\nout first one thread and then another; there was the intermittent\r\nsnorting, panting, and seething of the steam-engines, the suck and thud\r\nof their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great\r\ndriving-wheels came round, a note the leather straps made as they ran\r\ntighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from the dynamos; and, over\r\nall, sometimes inaudible, as the ear tired of it, and then creeping back\r\nupon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine. The\r\nfloor never felt steady and quiet beneath one’s feet, but quivered and\r\njarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send any one’s\r\nthoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for three months, while the big\r\nstrike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a blackleg,\r\nand Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the stir and eddy\r\nof it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty between the shed\r\nand the gates.\r\n\r\nHolroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine\r\nsoon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. “Look\r\nat that,” said Holroyd; “where’s your ’eathen idol to match ’im?” And\r\nAzuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi\r\nheard: “Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent. on the ordinary shares,”\r\nsaid Holroyd, “and that’s something like a Gord!”\r\n\r\nHolroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and\r\npower to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that,\r\nand the incessant whirling and shindy, set up within the curly, black\r\ncranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so\r\nways in which a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a\r\nshock as a sample of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of\r\nhis labour—it was heavy labour, being not only his own but most of\r\nHolroyd’s—Azuma-zi would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then the\r\nbrushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would\r\nswear, but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The\r\nband ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched was\r\nthe complacent thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big airy\r\nshed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and slaving\r\nto drive a ship as the other engines he knew—mere captive devils of the\r\nBritish Solomon—had been, but a machine enthroned. Those two smaller\r\ndynamos, Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the large one he\r\nprivately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. They were fretful and\r\nirregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was! How serene\r\nand easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the Buddahs he had\r\nseen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! The great black\r\ncoils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the brushes, and the\r\ndeep note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected Azuma-zi queerly.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord\r\nof the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to\r\nget whiskey, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but\r\nbehind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he got\r\nhit for it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand close\r\nto the colossus and look up at the great leather band running overhead.\r\nThere was a black patch on the band that came round, and it pleased him\r\nsomehow among all the clatter to watch this return again and again. Odd\r\nthoughts spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people tell us that\r\nsavages give souls to rocks and trees—and a machine is a thousand times\r\nmore alive than a rock or a tree. And Azuma-zi was practically a savage\r\nstill; the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper than his slop suit, his\r\nbruises and the coal grime on his face and hands. His father before him\r\nhad worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred blood, it may be, had splashed\r\nthe broad wheels of Juggernaut.\r\n\r\nHe took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the\r\ngreat dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until\r\nthe metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of\r\nservice in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning coils\r\ngently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people in\r\nLondon hid their gods.\r\n\r\nAt last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts\r\nand acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he salaamed to\r\nthe Lord of the Dynamos; and then, when Holroyd was away, he went and\r\nwhispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant, and prayed\r\nit to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did so a rare\r\ngleam of light came in through the open archway of the throbbing\r\nmachine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and roared, was\r\nradiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service was\r\nacceptable to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he had\r\ndone, and he had indeed been very much alone in London. And even when\r\nhis work time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the shed.\r\n\r\nThen, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to\r\nthe Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, “Thou seest, O my Lord!” and the\r\nangry whirr of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it\r\nappeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different\r\nnote came into the sounds of the great dynamo. “My Lord bides his time,”\r\nsaid Azuma-zi to himself. “The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe.”\r\nAnd he waited and watched for the day of reckoning. One day there was\r\nevidence of short circuiting, and Holroyd, making an unwary\r\nexamination—it was in the afternoon—got a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi\r\nfrom behind the engine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil.\r\n\r\n“He is warned,” said Azuma-zi to himself. “Surely my Lord is very\r\npatient.”\r\n\r\nHolroyd had at first initiated his “nigger” into such elementary\r\nconceptions of the dynamo’s working as would enable him to take\r\ntemporary charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the\r\nmanner in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster, he became suspicious.\r\nHe dimly perceived his assistant was “up to something,” and connecting\r\nhim with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the varnish\r\nin one place, he issued an edict, shouted above the confusion of the\r\nmachinery, “Don’t ’ee go nigh that big dynamo any more, Pooh-bah, or a\r\n’ll take thy skin off!” Besides, if it pleased Azuma-zi to be near the\r\nbig machine, it was plain sense and decency to keep him away from it.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the\r\nLord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as\r\nhe turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and\r\nglared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery\r\ntook a new rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad. The\r\nincessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his\r\nlittle store of knowledge and big store of superstitious fancy, at last,\r\ninto something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of making\r\nHolroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to him, it\r\nfilled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion.\r\n\r\nThat night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed\r\ntogether. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and\r\nflickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball\r\ngovernors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their\r\npistons beat loud and steady. The world outside seen through the open\r\nend of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely\r\nsilent, too, since the riot of the machinery drowned every external\r\nsound. Far away was the black fence of the yard with grey, shadowy\r\nhouses behind, and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little\r\nstars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above\r\nwhich the leather bands were running, and went into the shadow by the\r\nbig dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the spin of the armature changed.\r\n\r\n“What are you dewin’ with that switch?” he bawled in surprise. “Ha’n’t I\r\ntold you—”\r\n\r\nThen he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi’s eyes as the Asiatic came\r\nout of the shadow towards him.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the\r\ngreat dynamo.\r\n\r\n“You coffee-headed fool!” gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his\r\nthroat. “Keep off those contact rings.” In another moment he was tripped\r\nand reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively loosened\r\nhis grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what\r\nhad happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter’s lodge by\r\nthe gate. Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could\r\nmake nothing of the black’s incoherent English, and hurried on to the\r\nshed. The machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be\r\ndisarranged. There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he\r\nsaw an odd-looking, crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big\r\ndynamo, and, approaching, recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd.\r\n\r\nThe man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face and shut his\r\neyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so that\r\nhe should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice\r\nand help.\r\n\r\nWhen Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had\r\nbeen a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt\r\nstrangely elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon\r\nhim. His plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the\r\nstation, and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene\r\njumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely\r\nnoticed Azuma-zi except to ask a few questions. Did he see Holroyd kill\r\nhimself? Azuma-zi explained he had been out of sight at the engine\r\nfurnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the dynamo. It was\r\nnot a difficult examination, being untinctured by suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from the\r\nmachine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained\r\ntable-cloth. Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man.\r\nThe expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for\r\nseven or eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the\r\nelectric railway. Azuma-zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions\r\nof the people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed, was\r\npresently sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of\r\ncourse a crowd collected outside the gates of the yard,—a crowd, for no\r\nknown reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden\r\ndeath in London; two or three reporters percolated somehow into the\r\nengine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert\r\ncleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist.\r\n\r\nPresently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with\r\nit. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over\r\nagain in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still. An\r\nhour after the murder, to any one coming into the shed it would have\r\nlooked exactly as if nothing remarkable had ever happened there. Peeping\r\npresently from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and\r\nwhirl beside his little brothers, the driving wheels were beating round,\r\nand the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been\r\nearlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view, it\r\nhad been a most insignificant incident—the mere temporary deflection of\r\na current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of the scientific\r\nmanager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling up and down\r\nthe lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps between the\r\nengines and the dynamos.\r\n\r\n“Have I not served my Lord?” said Azuma-zi, inaudibly, from his shadow,\r\nand the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked\r\nat the big, whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had\r\nbeen a little in abeyance since Holroyd’s death resumed its sway.\r\n\r\nNever had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big,\r\nhumming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from\r\nits steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him,\r\nscribbling on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the\r\nmonster.\r\n\r\n“Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready.”\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi made a stealthy step forward, then stopped. The scientific\r\nmanager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the shed to the\r\nendmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes.\r\n\r\nAzuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into the shadow\r\nby the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager’s footsteps could\r\nbe heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the\r\nstoker crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly\r\nfizzled, and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nFirst, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung\r\ntowards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his\r\nantagonist’s head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his waist\r\nand swung round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him again,\r\nputting a curly head against his chest, and they swayed and panted as it\r\nseemed for an age or so. Then the scientific manager was impelled to\r\ncatch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The black yelled\r\nhideously.\r\n\r\nThey rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently slipped\r\nfrom the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear—the scientific\r\nmanager wondered which at the time—tried to throttle him. The scientific\r\nmanager was making some ineffectual efforts to claw something with his\r\nhands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick footsteps sounded on\r\nthe floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him and darted towards the\r\nbig dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar.\r\n\r\nThe officer of the company, who had entered, stood staring as Azuma-zi\r\ncaught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion,\r\nand then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently distorted.\r\n\r\n“I’m jolly glad you came in when you did,” said the scientific manager,\r\nstill sitting on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the still quivering figure. “It is not a nice death to die,\r\napparently—but it is quick.”\r\n\r\nThe official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\nThe scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his\r\nfingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\n“Poor Holroyd! I see now.” Then almost mechanically he went towards the\r\nswitch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit\r\nagain. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine\r\nand fell forward on its face. The cone of the dynamo roared out loud and\r\nclear, and the armature beat the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most\r\nshort-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could boast a Martyrdom and\r\na Human Sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TREASURE IN THE FOREST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in\r\nthe white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the\r\nsea; the thicker and deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course\r\ndown the distant hill-slope. The forest here came close to the beach.\r\nFar beyond, dim and almost cloudlike in texture, rose the mountains,\r\nlike suddenly frozen waves. The sea was still save for an almost\r\nimperceptible swell. The sky blazed.\r\n\r\nThe man with the carved paddle stopped. “It should be somewhere here,”\r\nhe said. He shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely\r\nscrutinising the land. He had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.\r\n\r\n“Come and look at this, Evans,” he said.\r\n\r\nBoth men spoke in low tones, and their lips were hard and dry.\r\n\r\nThe man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look\r\nover his companion’s shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding it was\r\ncreased and worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the\r\ndiscoloured fragments together where they had parted. On it one could\r\ndimly make out, in almost obliterated pencil, the outline of the bay.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Evans, “is the reef and here is the gap.” He ran his\r\nthumb-nail over the chart.\r\n\r\n“This curved and twisting line is the river—I could do with a drink\r\nnow!—and this star is the place.”\r\n\r\n“You see this dotted line,” said the man with the map; “it is a straight\r\nline, and runs from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees.\r\nThe star comes just where it cuts the river. We must mark the place as\r\nwe go into the lagoon.”\r\n\r\n“It’s queer,” said Evans, after a pause, “what these little marks down\r\nhere are for. It looks like the plan of a house or something; but what\r\nall these little dashes, pointing this way and that, may mean I can’t\r\nget a notion. And what’s the writing?”\r\n\r\n“Chinese,” said the man with the map.\r\n\r\n“Of course! _He_ was a Chinee,” said Evans.\r\n\r\n“They all were,” said the man with the map.\r\n\r\nThey both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe\r\ndrifted slowly. Then Evans looked towards the paddle.\r\n\r\n“Your turn with the paddle now, Hooker,” said he.\r\n\r\nAnd his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket,\r\npassed Evans carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid,\r\nlike those of a man whose strength was nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nEvans sat with his eyes half closed, watching the frothy breakwater of\r\nthe coral creep nearer and nearer. The sky was like a furnace now, for\r\nthe sun was near the zenith. Though they were so near the Treasure he\r\ndid not feel the exaltation he had anticipated. The intense excitement\r\nof the struggle for the plan, and the long night voyage from the\r\nmainland in the unprovisioned canoe had, to use his own expression,\r\n“taken it out of him.” He tried to arouse himself by directing his mind\r\nto the ingots the Chinamen had spoken of, but it would not rest there;\r\nit came back headlong to the thought of sweet water rippling in the\r\nriver, and to the almost unendurable dryness of his lips and throat. The\r\nrhythmic wash of the sea upon the reef was becoming audible now, and it\r\nhad a pleasant sound in his ears; the water washed along the side of the\r\ncanoe, and the paddle dripped between each stroke. Presently he began to\r\ndoze.\r\n\r\nHe was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture\r\ninterwove with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and\r\nHooker had hit upon the Chinamen’s secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the\r\nlittle fire burning, and the black figures of the three\r\nChinamen—silvered on one side by moonlight, and on the other glowing\r\nfrom the firelight—and heard them talking together in pigeon-English—for\r\nthey came from different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of their\r\ntalk first, and had motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the\r\nconversation were inaudible and fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish\r\ngalleon from the Philippines hopelessly aground, and its treasure buried\r\nagainst the day of return, lay in the background of the story; a\r\nshipwrecked crew thinned by disease, a quarrel or so, and the needs of\r\ndiscipline, and at last taking to their boats never to be heard of\r\nagain. Then Chang-hi, only a year since, wandering ashore, had happened\r\nupon the ingots hidden for two hundred years, had deserted his junk, and\r\nreburied them with infinite toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid\r\ngreat stress on the safety—it was a secret of his. Now he wanted help to\r\nreturn and exhume them. Presently the little map fluttered and the\r\nvoices sank. A fine story for two stranded British wastrels to hear!\r\nEvans’ dream shifted to the moment when he had Chang-hi’s pigtail in his\r\nhand. The life of a Chinaman is scarcely sacred like a European’s. The\r\ncunning little face of Chang-hi, first keen and furious like a startled\r\nsnake, and then fearful, treacherous, and pitiful, became overwhelmingly\r\nprominent in the dream. At the end Chang-hi had grinned, a most\r\nincomprehensible and startling grin. Abruptly things became very\r\nunpleasant, as they will do at times in dreams. Chang-hi gibbered and\r\nthreatened him. He saw in his dream heaps and heaps of gold, and\r\nChang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him back from it. He took\r\nChang-hi by the pigtail—how big the yellow brute was, and how he\r\nstruggled and grinned! He kept growing bigger, too. Then the bright\r\nheaps of gold turned to a roaring furnace, and a vast devil,\r\nsurprisingly like Chang-hi, but with a huge black tail, began to feed\r\nhim with coals. They burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil was\r\nshouting his name: “Evans, Evans, you sleepy fool!”—or was it Hooker?\r\n\r\nHe woke up. They were in the mouth of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n“There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of\r\nbushes,” said his companion. “Mark that. If we go to those bushes and\r\nthen strike into the bush in a straight line from here, we shall come to\r\nit when we come to the stream.”\r\n\r\nThey could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the\r\nsight of it Evans revived. “Hurry up, man,” he said, “or, by heaven, I\r\nshall have to drink sea-water!” He gnawed his hand and stared at the\r\ngleam of silver among the rocks and green tangle.\r\n\r\nPresently he turned almost fiercely upon Hooker. “Give _me_ the paddle,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nSo they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water\r\nin the hollow of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further\r\nhe tried again. “This will do,” he said, and they began drinking\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n“Curse this!” said Evans, suddenly. “It’s too slow.” And, leaning\r\ndangerously over the fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the\r\nwater with his lips.\r\n\r\nPresently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a\r\nlittle creek, were about to land among the thick growth that overhung\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n“We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes\r\nand get the line to the place,” said Evans.\r\n\r\n“We had better paddle round,” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nSo they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the\r\nsea, and along the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew.\r\nHere they landed, pulled the light canoe far up the beach, and then went\r\nup towards the edge of the jungle until they could see the opening of\r\nthe reef and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had taken a native\r\nimplement out of the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece\r\nwas armed with polished stone. Hooker carried the paddle. “It is\r\nstraight now in this direction,” said he; “we must push through this\r\ntill we strike the stream. Then we must prospect.”\r\n\r\nThey pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young\r\ntrees, and at first it was toilsome going; but very speedily the trees\r\nbecame larger and the ground beneath them opened out. The blaze of the\r\nsunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool shadow. The trees\r\nbecame at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far\r\noverhead. Dim white flowers hung from their stems, and ropy creepers\r\nswung from tree to tree. The shadow deepened. On the ground, blotched\r\nfungi and a red-brown incrustation became frequent.\r\n\r\nEvans shivered. “It seems almost cold here after the blaze outside.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we are keeping to the straight,” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nPresently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white\r\nshafts of hot sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant\r\ngreen undergrowth, and coloured flowers. Then they heard the rush of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“Here is the river. We should be close to it now,” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet\r\nunnamed, grew among the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of\r\nhuge green fans towards the strip of sky. Many flowers and a creeper\r\nwith shiny foliage clung to the exposed stems. On the water of the\r\nbroad, quiet pool which the treasure-seekers now overlooked there\r\nfloated big, oval leaves and a waxen, pinkish-white flower not unlike a\r\nwater-lily. Further, as the river bent away from them, the water\r\nsuddenly frothed and became noisy in a rapid.\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Evans.\r\n\r\n“We have swerved a little from the straight,” said Hooker. “That was to\r\nbe expected.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked into the dim, cool shadows of the silent forest\r\nbehind them. “If we beat a little way up and down the stream we should\r\ncome to something.”\r\n\r\n“You said—” began Evans.\r\n\r\n“_He_ said there was a heap of stones,” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Let us try a little down-stream first,” said Evans.\r\n\r\nThey advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans\r\nstopped. “What the devil’s that?” he said.\r\n\r\nHooker followed his finger. “Something blue,” he said. It had come into\r\nview as they topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to\r\ndistinguish what it was.\r\n\r\nHe advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to\r\nthe limp hand and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the\r\nimplement he carried. The thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on\r\nhis face. The _abandon_ of the pose was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nThe two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this\r\nominous dead body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Near by was\r\na spade after the Chinese pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap\r\nof stones, close to a freshly dug hole.\r\n\r\n“Somebody has been here before,” said Hooker, clearing his throat.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Evans began to swear and rave, and stamp upon the ground.\r\n\r\nHooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate\r\nbody. He saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles\r\nswollen. “Pah!” he said, and suddenly turned away and went towards the\r\nexcavation. He gave a cry of surprise. He shouted to Evans, who was\r\nfollowing him slowly.\r\n\r\n“You fool! It’s all right. It’s here still.” Then he turned again and\r\nlooked at the dead Chinaman, and then again at the hole.\r\n\r\nEvans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch\r\nbeside them lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole,\r\nand, clearing off the soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of\r\nthe heavy masses out. As he did so a little thorn pricked his hand. He\r\npulled the delicate spike out with his fingers and lifted the ingot.\r\n\r\n“Only gold or lead could weigh like this,” he said exultantly.\r\n\r\nHooker was still looking at the dead Chinaman. He was puzzled.\r\n\r\n“He stole a march on his friends,” he said at last. “He came here alone,\r\nand some poisonous snake has killed him—I wonder how he found the\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\nEvans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman\r\nsignify? “We shall have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal,\r\nand bury it there for a while. How shall we get it to the canoe?”\r\n\r\nHe took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or\r\nthree ingots into it. Presently he found that another little thorn had\r\npunctured his skin.\r\n\r\n“This is as much as we can carry,” said he. Then suddenly, with a queer\r\nrush of irritation, “What are you staring at?”\r\n\r\nHooker turned to him. “I can’t stand—him.” He nodded towards the corpse.\r\n“It’s so like—”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish!” said Evans. “All Chinamen are alike.”\r\n\r\nHooker looked into his face. “I’m going to bury _that_, anyhow, before I\r\nlend a hand with this stuff.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be a fool, Hooker,” said Evans. “Let that mass of corruption\r\nbide.”\r\n\r\nHooker hesitated, and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil\r\nabout them. “It scares me somehow,” he said.\r\n\r\n“The thing is,” said Evans, “what to do with these ingots. Shall we\r\nre-bury them over here, or take them across the strait in the canoe?”\r\n\r\nHooker thought. His puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree-trunks,\r\nand up into the remote sunlit greenery overhead. He shivered again as\r\nhis eye rested upon the blue figure of the Chinaman. He stared\r\nsearchingly among the grey depths between the trees.\r\n\r\n“What’s come to you, Hooker?” said Evans. “Have you lost your wits?”\r\n\r\n“Let’s get the gold out of this place, anyhow,” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nHe took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands, and Evans took\r\nthe opposite corners, and they lifted the mass. “Which way?” said Evans.\r\n“To the canoe?”\r\n\r\n“It’s queer,” said Evans, when they had advanced only a few steps, “but\r\nmy arms ache still with that paddling.”\r\n\r\n“Curse it!” he said. “But they ache! I must rest.”\r\n\r\nThey let the coat down. Evans’ face was white, and little drops of sweat\r\nstood out upon his forehead. “It’s stuffy, somehow, in this forest.”\r\n\r\nThen with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger: “What is the good\r\nof waiting here all the day? Lend a hand, I say! You have done nothing\r\nbut moon since we saw the dead Chinaman.”\r\n\r\nHooker was looking steadfastly at his companion’s face. He helped raise\r\nthe coat bearing the ingots, and they went forward perhaps a hundred\r\nyards in silence. Evans began to breathe heavily. “Can’t you speak?” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with you?” said Hooker.\r\n\r\nEvans stumbled, and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He\r\nstood for a moment staring at Hooker, and then with a groan clutched at\r\nhis own throat.\r\n\r\n“Don’t come near me,” he said, and went and leant against a tree. Then\r\nin a steadier voice, “I’ll be better in a minute.”\r\n\r\nPresently his grip upon the trunk loosened, and he slipped slowly down\r\nthe stem of the tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot. His hands\r\nwere clenched convulsively. His face became distorted with pain. Hooker\r\napproached him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!” said Evans, in a stifled voice. “Put\r\nthe gold back on the coat.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t I do anything for you?” said Hooker.\r\n\r\n“Put the gold back on the coat.”\r\n\r\nAs Hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his\r\nthumb. He looked at his hand and saw a slender thorn, perhaps two inches\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nEvans gave an inarticulate cry and rolled over.\r\n\r\nHooker’s jaw dropped. He stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated\r\neyes. Then he looked at Evans, who was now crumpled together on the\r\nground, his back bending and straitening spasmodically. Then he looked\r\nthrough the pillars of the trees and network of creeper stems, to where\r\nin the dim grey shadow the blue-clad body of the Chinaman was still\r\nindistinctly visible. He thought of the little dashes in the corner of\r\nthe plan, and in a moment he understood.\r\n\r\n“God help me!” he said. For the thorns were similar to those the Dyaks\r\npoison and use in their blowing-tubes. He understood now what Chang-hi’s\r\nassurance of the safety of his treasure meant. He understood that grin\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n“Evans!” he cried.\r\n\r\nBut Evans was silent and motionless now, save for a horrible spasmodic\r\ntwitching of his limbs. A profound silence brooded over the forest.\r\n\r\nThen Hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball\r\nof his thumb—sucking for dear life. Presently he felt a strange aching\r\npain in his arms and shoulders, and his fingers seemed difficult to\r\nbend. Then he knew that sucking was no good.\r\n\r\nAbruptly he stopped, and sitting down by the pile of ingots, and resting\r\nhis chin upon his hands and his elbows upon his knees, stared at the\r\ndistorted but still stirring body of his companion. Chang-hi’s grin came\r\nin his mind again. The dull pain spread towards his throat and grew\r\nslowly in intensity. Far above him a faint breeze stirred the greenery,\r\nand the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through\r\nthe gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
