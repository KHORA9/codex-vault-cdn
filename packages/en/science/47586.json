As the former was founded on the _first_ series of a popular\r\nFrench work, \"Les Saisons,\" by M. Hoefer, so the present has been\r\nsuggested by the _second_ series; but in availing myself of it, I\r\nhave omitted much, I have revised more, and at various parts my\r\nadditions have been considerable. And here, as in my former effort, I\r\nhave written from a popular rather than a scientific point of view.\r\nIt has not been my object to sketch the outlines or lay down the\r\nfoundations of any science; but to show, as best I could, how much of\r\nwonder and beauty enters into our daily life, and what inexhaustible\r\nsources of study lie at our very feet. It is, perhaps, a misfortune\r\nof our common systems of education that they too much neglect the\r\ntuition of the eye; that the young are not taught to mark the curious\r\nand interesting objects which are comprehended within their daily\r\nvision; that they know so much about ancient mythology and so little\r\nabout modern science,--so much about gods and heroes, so little about\r\nstars and flowers.\r\n\r\nI have called this volume \"Everyday Objects,\" not because those which\r\nit describes may be seen every day, but because they mostly belong\r\nto the region of the commonplace and familiar; and I have called it\r\n\"Picturesque Aspects of Natural History,\" because I have endeavoured,\r\nin companionship with my French _collaborateur_, to indicate the\r\npoetical side of the various sciences into which I have presumed to\r\npenetrate. If it should awaken a love of nature in any breast, or\r\ndevelop a spirit of inquiry, which may lead the student further and\r\nfurther on the path of knowledge, the labour bestowed upon these\r\npages will not have been in vain.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of curiosity,--says M. Hoefer, in his preface to the\r\nfirst series of \"Les Saisons,\"--is the awakening of the intellectual\r\nlife: it commences with the lisping of the child, accompanies the\r\nadult in every phase of his existence, and, far from becoming extinct\r\nwith the last throb of the heart, revives before the unknown shadows\r\nof the grave. What, then, is there in the whole world of greater\r\nimportance to follow and direct than the movements and impulses of\r\nthis curiosity, of these uncertain pulsations of the soul? In this\r\nlies the secret of all education; and upon education depends the\r\nfuture of humanity.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he continues, the methods hitherto employed have been\r\nabsolutely insufficient. And the insufficiency is most notable as\r\nregards the imperfect and defective training given to the instinct\r\nof curiosity. Observe the child. Of everything which excites his\r\nattention, he never fails to ask you the _reason why_. It is thus\r\nthat he enters into the connexion of \"cause\" and \"effect.\" It is\r\na sign. But instead of following up this natural indication, and\r\ndeveloping the thought by the exercise of the reason, we proceed as\r\nif the being under our charge were incapable of reason; we overload\r\nthe memory of the child with a multitude of words, whose value he\r\ncannot understand until later in life, and perhaps never. The true\r\ndirection of the mind is to proceed from the thought to the word, and\r\nnot from the word to the thought. It is for want of having recognised\r\nand applied this principle that our educational systems have failed\r\nso utterly.\r\n\r\nLet us take, for example, the study of nature. No science, assuredly,\r\nought to prove more attractive to the mind than natural history. Yet\r\nmark how repulsive zoology, botany, and mineralogy are made at the\r\nvery outset, by the dryness of their nomenclatures and the dreariness\r\nof their classifications. Undoubtedly, it is necessary to lay down a\r\ncourse of study in the midst of the marvels which everywhere surround\r\nus; undoubtedly names are required for the objects which attract our\r\nnotice. But are not the methods we employ directly opposed to the end\r\nwe set before ourselves?\r\n\r\nI address myself to parents and teachers; and I say to them, Do you\r\nwish to inculcate a love of science, and yet put into the hands\r\nof your children or pupils books which differ as widely from the\r\nbook of nature as human brotherhood--(a fiction!)--differs from\r\nuniversal gravitation? Instead of familiarising us at first with the\r\nanimals and plants within our everyday reach, you collect, under\r\nthe same irrevocable iron \"form,\" genera and species never intended\r\nto meet in any one particular zone, and many of which are so rare\r\nthat few persons will ever be fortunate enough to see them except\r\nin collections and engravings. And, curious to state, the rarest\r\nspecies nearly always obtain your preferences; judging, at least,\r\nfrom the minute descriptions which you consecrate to them. Monstrous\r\nabsurdity! You seek at a distance that which lies close to your\r\nhands, as if the Everyday Objects above, beneath, and around, were\r\nunworthy of the science you profess.\r\n\r\nBut here we must pause. Upon the principles thus laid down by M.\r\nHoefer, have been founded the two unpretending companion volumes,\r\nof which the second is now submitted to the lenient judgment of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n    W.

J. BAILEY, _Festus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur observation of the celestial phenomena may most easily be made in\r\nthe winter-time. Then the nights are long, and the vault of heaven\r\nis crowded with stars, and, unilluminated by the moon, exhibits all\r\nits splendours. In the other seasons of the year, and particularly in\r\nsummer, the twilight gleam encroaches, so to speak, upon a portion of\r\nthe nights, which are otherwise so brief, and precludes our vision\r\nfrom any exact estimate of the stars. Those demitints, those soft\r\nsubdued reflections of light, scarcely permit the eye to distinguish\r\neven stars of the first and second magnitude, which shine like spots\r\nof dull gold on a background of pale silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER OF THE STARS.\r\n\r\nHow many are the stars?\r\n\r\nTo such a question comes the immediate answer, They are infinite in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nBut, after a little meditation, we begin to perceive that the\r\nquestion, apparently so simple, is, in reality, one of very great\r\ncomplexity. Let us endeavour to disentangle its various threads.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that, in every scientific analysis, it is\r\nimportant we should, in the first place, separate two intimately\r\nunited elements,--the individual who observes, and the product of\r\nthe observation. The former, the \"sensorial factor,\" is subject to\r\nevery condition of space and time; the second, the \"intellectual\r\nfactor,\" tends, by its generalisations, to free itself from those\r\nvery conditions which are the inseparable co-efficients of matter\r\nand movement. The individual passes; save from an outer standpoint,\r\nwe know not whence he comes, nor whither he goes. The product of the\r\nobservation remains; transmissible from generation to generation,\r\nit will gradually expand and increase, if it be founded upon truth;\r\nbut, on the contrary, its splendour will wane, and will eventually\r\ndisappear, if it be founded upon error. Eternal is this spectacle of\r\nactors and puppets succeeding one another uninterruptedly upon the\r\nsame stage! As one falls, another steps forward into his place, and\r\nso the great army marches forward with unbroken ranks.\r\n\r\nHe who, \"in cities pent,\" sees the sky only through a garret window,\r\nor in the narrow intervals between house and house, can form no\r\naccurate idea of the magnificence of the firmament. The peasant, the\r\nshepherd, or the labourer, spent with his daily work, prefers sleep\r\nto astronomical vigils; and even amongst those more favoured sons of\r\nfortune, who enjoy sufficient leisure, but few are found who feel\r\na genuine pleasure in the study of the stars. Though they are the\r\npoetry of heaven, their music is inaudible to the majority of souls.\r\nWe content ourselves with an occasional careless glance at their\r\nserene loveliness, and then turn again to the pleasures or avocations\r\nof commonplace life.\r\n\r\nBut, come; let us arouse ourselves! Let us quit the city for awhile;\r\nlet us throw off all thought of its too-engrossing pursuits; let us\r\nfind time to count the stars. Gentle readers, I ask you to follow me.\r\n\r\nAh, me! how small is the train of followers! How great my delusion\r\nin supposing that a complete phalanx of students of the celestial\r\nwonders would reply to my invitation!\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived in the open country; and here, on the summit of\r\nthis gentle ascent, crowned with a clump of leafless trees, we pause.\r\nThe sky glitters with a cold, keen light, which is reflected back by\r\nthe snowy plains. While the eye ranges delightedly over the starry\r\nvault, the ear is struck by the distant sound of bells, which, at\r\nthe midnight hour, ring in the infant year--ring in so many hopes\r\nand expected joys, and unexpected sorrows--ring out so many passing\r\npleasures and rudely dissipated visions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nAs the chime glides softly over the meadows, and along the resounding\r\nvales, and through the leafless woods, repeated by echo after echo,\r\nuntil its music dies away in the distance, like our recollections\r\nof the dreams of youth, we murmur to ourselves that solemn song of\r\nthe poet, which so aptly blends the regrets of the past with the\r\nanticipations of the future; we exclaim--\r\n\r\n    \"Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,\r\n      The flying cloud, the frosty light:\r\n      The year is dying in the night;\r\n    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.\r\n\r\n    \"Ring out false pride in place and blood,\r\n      The civic slander and the spite;\r\n      Ring in the love of truth and right,\r\n    Ring in the common love of good.\r\n\r\n    \"Ring out old shapes of foul disease;\r\n      Ring out the harrowing lust of gold;\r\n      Ring out the thousand wars of old,\r\n    Ring in the thousand years of peace.\r\n\r\n    \"Ring in the valiant man and free,\r\n      The larger heart, the kindlier hand;\r\n      Ring out the darkness of the land,\r\n    Ring in the Christ that is to be.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe spectacle is majestic and impressive. Let us seek, in the first\r\nplace, to ascertain our position in reference to the four points of\r\nthe compass--the four cardinal points. But how is this to be done?\r\nBy day it is easy enough. I have only to turn myself towards the sun\r\nwhen it has reached the highest point of its diurnal course, and\r\nthere, in front of me, lies the south, in my rear the north, the east\r\non my left, and on my right the west.\r\n\r\nBut is it possible to ascertain one's position during the absence of\r\nthe \"orb of day?\"\r\n\r\nBoth possible and easy, provided the sky be clear and cloudless.\r\n\r\nBut this condition is as necessary by day as by night. How can we\r\ndetermine in which direction lies the south, if the sun be hidden\r\nfrom our gaze by an uniformly opaque atmosphere, and if objects, lit\r\nup by a diffuse light, project no shadow at any time of the day?\r\n\r\nEndeavour to group together the stars which more particularly strike\r\nyour gaze; and be careful, in these groupings, to define every\r\nfantastic figure which is suggested by your vivid imagination.\r\nUndoubtedly, our earliest ancestors, the \"world's gray forefathers,\"\r\nproceeded in this manner, in their anxiety to lay hold of some\r\ndefinite guiding-marks in yonder ocean of sparkling atoms. And\r\nto study a science by its history is to follow up its successive\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AND THE LITTLE BEAR.\r\n\r\nObserve yonder very remarkable group of seven stars; nearly all are\r\nof the same splendour, and they are so arranged as to figure an\r\nantique chariot, provided with a somewhat curved axle pole.\r\n\r\nObserve it carefully. And not far from this group you will detect\r\nanother, by no means so conspicuous, but exactly resembling it in\r\nform. This second chariot is turned in an inverse direction, and the\r\nstars composing it, with three exceptions, are much less brilliant.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two groups of stars, clearly distinguished by their\r\nconfiguration--two _constellations_, for such is the scientific name\r\ngiven to all the stellar groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Great Bear and Little Bear.]\r\n\r\nIt has been the fortune of the first of these two groups to strike\r\nthe eye of the most indifferent observer from the remotest antiquity;\r\nand its likeness to a _quadriga_ early procured it the name of a\r\n_car_ or _chariot_. For those Christians who pleased themselves in\r\nstudding the sky with Biblical personages, it is _David's Chariot_.\r\nThis species of apotheosis was borrowed from the Pagans. They placed\r\nin the skies their divinities, their demigods, their heroes, and the\r\nprincipal facts and stories of their mythology. For the Greeks and\r\nRomans the \"Chariot of David\" was the female of the Bear, an ursa, or\r\nἀρκτὸς. Whence came this transfiguration? Listen to the fanciful\r\nold myth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCallisto was the most beautiful of the daughters of the King Lycaon.\r\nJupiter, who may appropriately be styled the \"Don Juan\" or \"Lovelace\"\r\nof the heathen Olympus, fell in love with her; and she bore him a\r\nson, named Arcas, who gave his name to Arcadia, that land of song\r\nand fable, groves and streams, where Lycaon exercised his sovereign\r\nsway. Juno, the queen of heaven, and wife of the so-called king of\r\ngods and men, transported by her jealous rage, changed Callisto into\r\na she-bear; who, one day, would have been unwittingly slain by Arcas,\r\nif Jupiter, opportunely appearing on the scene, had not metamorphosed\r\nthe hunter into another animal, _Ursa Minor_, or the Little Bear.\r\nAccording to this myth, the Little Bear will be but a transformation\r\nof the former, who was the Great Bear, or, before all and above all,\r\n_the_ Bear.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising, according to certain writers, that Homer\r\nshould refer to only one of these constellations:--\r\n\r\n    Ἄρκτοιθ᾿ ἥν καὶ ἄμαξαν ἐπίκλησιν\r\n     καλέουσιν.[2]\r\n    (The Bear, which men the Chariot also name).\r\n\r\nBut the learned commentators who have censured the poet for making\r\nno distinction between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, probably never\r\nlooked at the starry vault with an attentive eye; otherwise, like\r\nall the world, they might have convinced themselves that the seven\r\nstars, _septem triones_ (whence the word \"septentrion\"), forming the\r\nbeautiful constellation, which, undoubtedly, long before Homer's\r\ntime, was known as \"The Bear\" or \"The Celestial Chariot,\" were\r\nall that could be seen. With a single exception, these stars are\r\nof the second magnitude--that is to say, they, so far as regards\r\ntheir brilliancy, rank next to the most brilliant stars of the\r\nfirmament. The least conspicuous star in the group--one of the third\r\nmagnitude--occupies the base of the pole of the Celestial Chariot, or\r\nof the Bear's tail; it is the fourth star counting from the extremity\r\nof the tail. On celestial charts, it is particularised by the fourth\r\nletter of the Greek alphabet, δ (delta).\r\n\r\nObserve, in passing, that the first of these charts, wherein the\r\nstars of a constellation were indicated by Greek characters, appeared\r\nin 1603, at Augsburg, under the title of \"Uranometria.\" Its author,\r\nJean Bayer, an amateur astronomer, who died in 1660, conceived the\r\nidea of designating by the first letters of the Greek alphabet--α,\r\nβ, γ, δ, and so on--the most noticeable stars. The animals bearing\r\nthe names of the constellations are drawn in this map with very\r\nconsiderable care; but it requires, let us hasten to add, much\r\nimagination and good-will to recognise, in the form of a stellar\r\ngroup, the animal shown in the drawing.\r\n\r\nThus far Ursa Major. The four stars of the quadriga, or chariot, have\r\nbeen employed to form the dorso-lumbar region of the animal; the\r\nthree others define its tail; and, finally, twenty-four little stars,\r\nsome of which are hardly visible to the naked eye, compose the head\r\nand paws of the celestial \"plantigrade.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Ursa Minor, it is impossible to distinguish it immediately\r\nwhen you are unaccustomed to surveying or examining the celestial\r\nvault. To detect its position, you require to be forewarned of it; to\r\nknow, in the first place, that there exists in the vicinity of the\r\nBear an exactly similar stellar group. The point of the tail--α in\r\nUrsa Minor--alone possesses a splendour comparable to that of the\r\nprincipal stars in Ursa Major. But how construct a figure with one\r\nstar? The four other stars, two of which mark the anterior part of\r\nthe animal's body, and two others the tail, properly so called, are\r\nonly of the third magnitude: they are marked β, γ, δ, ε. Finally, the\r\nstars which define the posterior portion, marked ζ and η on Bayer's\r\nchart, are only of the fourth magnitude--in other words, are scarcely\r\nvisible. The eye, to detect them, must be wholly free from any gleam\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nMany generations passed before they succeeded in discovering what\r\na single individual solved during his brief career. All Homer's\r\ncontemporaries, and, prior to these, tens of millions of mortals,\r\nhad contemplated the sky, and yet none of them had detected the\r\ndifference between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. The distinction,\r\ntherefore, is of a comparatively recent date; probably does not date\r\nback earlier than the sixth century before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us recall ourselves, now, to the question propounded. The first\r\nimpression produced by the aspect of the sky during a beautiful\r\nwinter night is, we repeat, that the number of the stars is infinite.\r\nThis wholly spontaneous thought, which, to some extent, imposes\r\nitself on the mind long before the reason attempts any calculation,\r\nis, strange to say, both false and true.\r\n\r\nBut how can a thought be both false and true? Nothing is easier\r\nthan to explain the seeming contradiction. We shall return to it\r\nhereafter, after we have indulged in some indispensable digressions.\r\n\r\n\r\nORION.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest and loftiest flights of Longfellow's imagination is\r\nto be found in his poem on the occultation of Orion. He has seldom,\r\nif ever, sounded a more vigorous strain. After alluding to that music\r\nof the spheres which Pythagoras dreamed of, and which Shakespeare has\r\ndescribed in a passage of great beauty, he continues:--\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath the sky's triumphal arch\r\n    This music sounded like a march,\r\n    And with its chorus seemed to be\r\n    Preluding some great tragedy.\r\n    Sirius was rising in the east;\r\n    And, slow ascending one by one,\r\n    The kindling constellations shone.\r\n    Begirt with many a blazing star,\r\n    Stood the great giant Algebar,\r\n    Orion, hunter of the beast!\r\n    His sword hung gleaming by his side;\r\n    And, on his arm, the lion's hide\r\n    Scattered across the midnight air\r\n    The golden radiance of its hair.\"\r\n\r\nThe most ancient observer who wished, with his own eyes, to assure\r\nhimself whether the number of the stars was infinite, must have\r\nquickly perceived that, in spite of an apparent impossibility, it\r\nis no difficult task to complete their enumeration. To execute this\r\noperation conveniently, however, we must invent a process; and of all\r\nprocesses, the simplest, and that which first occurs to the mind,\r\nis to group the stars by configurations which, to a certain degree,\r\nare _mnemo-technical_. Such, in our belief, is the true origin--a\r\npoint so often and laboriously discussed--of the _asterisms_\r\nor _constellations_. Their fanciful, mythological, or poetical\r\nembellishments, are of later date.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe census or enumeration of the stars, which we suppose to have\r\ncommenced during our winter nights, must at first have been limited\r\nto the most characteristic groups, composed of the most brilliant\r\npoints. In this scientific labour the first rank would necessarily be\r\noccupied by Arctos (or Ursa Major) and Orion. Why? Because these two\r\nconstellations attract and rivet everybody's gaze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Orion.]\r\n\r\nOrion is situated on the side opposite to the Great Bear. It is\r\nthe most beautiful constellation in our western sky. You may\r\neasily recognise it by three stars, very close together, which are\r\ninscribed, as it were, in the centre of a great trapezium of four\r\nstars, two of which are of the first magnitude. Beneath the three\r\nfirst stars, called the Three Kings, or Orion's Belt, is visible a\r\nsmall stellar group of the fourth and fifth magnitude, near which,\r\nwith a good average glass, may be distinguished the largest and most\r\nremarkable of the nebulæ.\r\n\r\nHere we find the mythologists--those theologians of the Greco-Roman\r\npolytheism--at disagreement. According to an ancient legend,\r\nimmortalised by Homer--\r\n\r\n          \"Aurora sought Orion's love,...\r\n    Till, in Ortygia, Dian's wingèd dart\r\n    Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe giant, in the lower world, is still animated by a burning passion\r\nfor the chase--\r\n\r\n    \"There huge Orion, of portentous size,\r\n    Swift through the gloom a giant-hunter flies;\r\n    A ponderous mace of brass, with direful sway,\r\n    Aloft he whirls, to crush the savage prey;\r\n    Stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell,\r\n    Now, grisly forms, shoot o'er the lawns of hell.\"[4]\r\n\r\nAccording to later traditions, the giant Orion, son of Tura and\r\nNeptune, was endowed by his father with the faculty of walking upon\r\nthe sea as well as upon earth. He abandoned himself to the fierce\r\njoys of the chase in the wooded isle of Crete, to whose shades he\r\nhad accompanied Diana and Latona. Swollen with pride, he defied to\r\ncombat all the monsters of the universe, and was slain by a scorpion\r\nwhich the earth had engendered under his feet. But, through the\r\nintercession of Diana, a place was given to him in the firmament\r\nopposite Scorpio.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIURNAL MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nLet us put aside these dreams of the world's youth, and return to the\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nNature, transformed by the ancients into a multiple divinity, never\r\nfails to overwhelm with surprise the observer who interrogates her\r\nwith simplicity and without any preconcerted system. And it was thus\r\nthat he who first undertook to enumerate the stars, by the help of\r\nthe constellations, made at once the greatest and most unexpected\r\ndiscovery. What, in fact, was not his astonishment on seeing the\r\ngradual displacement of objects which, at the first glance, appeared\r\nimmovable!\r\n\r\nTo this very natural astonishment soon succeeded, we doubt not, a\r\ndesire to analyse the phenomenon. The most beautiful constellations\r\nof the firmament, Ursa and Orion, will have their points of repery on\r\nthe star-gemmed sphere. An attentive study, eagerly pursued through\r\na certain lapse of time, would teach him that Orion rises and sets\r\nlike the sun and the moon, while the Bear, remaining perpetually\r\nabove the horizon, neither rises nor sets. Stimulated by curiosity,\r\nthe observer would afterwards assure himself that the whole of the\r\ncelestial vault revolved upon an axis, while the stars divided into\r\ngroups; remain fixed, fixed in this sense, that they constantly\r\nmaintain among themselves the same relations of distance. The idea of\r\na solid sphere, to which the stars were attached like golden nails,\r\nthen came quite naturally to the human mind. Such, undoubtedly, was\r\nthe origin of the discovery of _diurnal movement_; of that general\r\nmovement which carries all the stars from west to east, to bring them\r\nback to the same points in the course of one complete day.\r\n\r\nTo hear our professors of astronomy invariably repeating, that\r\n\"the spectator of the starry vault may see, every moment, new stars\r\nrising above the horizon,--may see them mount the sky,--halt in their\r\nupward march when they have attained a certain elevation,--afterwards\r\nre-descend, and pass below the horizon;\"--to hear, we say, these\r\nwords incessantly reproduced, one would think that a cursory glance\r\nat the sky would suffice to reveal the general movement, and that\r\nwhat is within the ken of the first comer, should not be called a\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nBut we see in this another of those illusions which blind\r\ncontemporaries as to the time-long efforts of their predecessors to\r\ndiscover the very results which long ago became our common patrimony.\r\nUnquestionably, if you have eyes, you cannot fail to see the apparent\r\nmovement of the earth and moon; but from thence to the relation of\r\nthe whole celestial sphere is a wide interval. How many men are there\r\nwho possess, on the one hand, sufficient patience to fix their gaze\r\nonly for a couple of hours on the same point of the starry firmament;\r\nand, on the other, sufficient intelligence to estimate the relation\r\nof this point to a fixed point of the horizon, and to measure, by the\r\nthought, the interval separating these two points? Let each one ask\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF THE CARDINAL POINTS.\r\n\r\nHowever it may be, the discovery of the rotation of the celestial\r\nsystem must have been rapidly brought to perfection as it was\r\ntransmitted from one generation to another. It must soon have been\r\nrecognised that this sphere is inclined in such a manner that one\r\nof its _poles_--the _poles of the world_, which, in reality,\r\nare simply the prolonged extremities of the axis of terrestrial\r\nrotation--is always above the horizon, while the other remains below.\r\nAnd this phenomenon would lead to the geometrical conception of\r\nan axis of rotation of the celestial sphere. Thus we may explain,\r\nwith perfect ease, why the Bear and the neighbouring constellations\r\nshould describe perfect circles, and the other and more distant\r\nconstellations only arcs of circles, of a greater or lesser diameter;\r\nfinally, without even looking at the sky, we can understand that\r\nsome stars there are which show themselves on the horizon, only to\r\ndisappear immediately, and others which remain completely invisible\r\nto the inhabitants of our climates. By a singularly fortunate\r\ncoincidence, the pole, that geometrical point around which revolve\r\nthose circumpolar constellations that are continually above our\r\nhorizon, is occupied by a star \"well known to fame,\" and hence, on\r\nthe faith of its renown, supposed by many people to be a star of\r\npeculiar brilliancy.[5] It is named the _Polar Star_ (α in Ursa\r\nMinor), and is between the second and third magnitude.\r\n\r\nNow if, with arms extended, we so place ourselves that our back shall\r\nbe turned to Polaris, we shall have opposite to us the point of the\r\narc occupied by the sun at _noon_; on our left the east, and on our\r\nright the west. It is thus we may easily learn our position in the\r\nabsence of the orb of day.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this simple mode of guidance was, nevertheless, an\r\nepoch in history. From thence the mariner grew bold enough to quit\r\nthe coast, which he had hitherto hugged with timorous prudence, and\r\nventure out into the open sea. Thenceforth, the darkness disappeared;\r\nnew countries were revealed to one another, and nations, which from\r\ntime immemorial had remained apart, were brought into frequent\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nIt was with eyes fixed upon the Bear, which alone does not bathe\r\nitself in the waters of Ocean, that Ulysses set out from Calypso's\r\nenchanted island.\r\n\r\nAccording to Homer, who reflects in his immortal work the condition\r\nof scientific knowledge among his contemporaries, the ocean was a\r\ngreat broad river, surrounding the earth with circumfluent volume,\r\nand in its waves the stars were bathed or extinguished in the\r\nevening, to be rekindled in the morning on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nBy saying that the Bear alone does not bathe in the waters of\r\nOcean[6]--\r\n\r\n    Οῖη δʹ ἄμμορός ἐστι λοετρῶν ᾿Ωκεανοῑο--\r\n\r\nthe poet plainly shows that Ursa Minor, and the other circumpolar\r\nconstellations, were unknown in his time.\r\n\r\nIf the knowledge of these constellations was from the beginning so\r\nuseful and so necessary to navigation, the constellation nearest to\r\nthe pole could not, at first, have served as a guide to any but a\r\npeople essentially maritime. And here we find the Phœnicians, or\r\nTyrians, in the foremost rank.\r\n\r\nAfter reminding us that Ursa Major was also called Helice, or \"the\r\nspiral,\" as in the famous passage in the \"Argonauta\" of Apollonius\r\nRhodius,--\r\n\r\n    \"Night in the east poured darkness; on the sea\r\n    The wakeful sailor to Orion's star\r\n    And Helicè turned heedful,\"--\r\n\r\nand Ursa Minor, Cynosura,--that is, the dog's tail,--Manilius,[7] a\r\nLatin poet, who wrote at the beginning of the Christian era, goes on\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n\"At one of the extremities of the world's axis are two\r\nconstellations, well known to the hapless mariner: they are his\r\nguides when the bait of gain impels him across the ocean. Helice is\r\nthe larger, and describes the larger circle: it is recognised by its\r\nseven stars, which rival one another in splendour; and by this it is\r\nthat the Greeks steer their barks. The smaller, Cynosura, describes a\r\nlesser circle: it is inferior both in size and lustre; but, according\r\nto the witness of the Tyrians, is of greater importance. For the\r\nPhœnicians no safer guide exists when they seek to approach a coast\r\ninvisible from the high seas.\"\r\n\r\nThe testimony of Manilius is confirmed by that of Aratus and Strabo.\r\nThe pseudo-Eratosthenes, in his book on the constellations, refers to\r\nUrsa Minor under the name of Φοινίκη, the \"Phœnician.\" It appears,\r\nthen, to be established that the Phœnicians were the first to group\r\na constellation of the same general outline as Helice, the Little\r\nBear, or Ursa Minor. But that, as we have already explained, the two\r\nconstellations do not lie in the same direction, every one may see:\r\n\r\n    \"Nec paribus positæ sunt frontibus; utraque caudam\r\n    Vergit in alterius rostrum, sequiturque sequentem.\"[8]\r\n\r\n        Not in the same direction do they face:\r\n        The one its tail towards the other's snout\r\n        Turns, and they thus, pursuing, each pursue.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the Phœnicians, as experienced seamen, would\r\nguide their course by the constellation lying nearest to the pole.\r\nBut was this constellation the same which we now-a-days call Ursa\r\nMinor? It is quite allowable for us to put such a question, because\r\neverybody knows that, owing to the movement of the terrestrial\r\naxis around the poles of the ecliptic, the axis of the world (the\r\nterrestrial axis prolonged) is displaced to an extent which becomes\r\nperfectly appreciable at the end of a certain time.[9] We may\r\ncalculate, therefore, that the pole, now situated, as we have already\r\nsaid, near the star Polaris (α in Ursa Minor), was formerly at some\r\ndistance from it. So, at the epoch of the greatest prosperity of the\r\nPhœnician people, or about three thousand years ago, the north pole\r\nwould nearly correspond with a star in Draco, now 24° 52' distant.\r\n\r\n[This constellation is shown in fig. 2, between Ursa Major and Ursa\r\nMinor; the α in Draco is a star surrounded by a circle, like the\r\nPolar Star, α in Ursa Minor.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the constellation of Draco was well known to the ancients, we\r\nmay gather from a passage in the \"Phenomena\" of Aratus, a work partly\r\ntranslated by Cicero:--\r\n\r\n\"The Dragon, like the sinuous course of a river, uncoils his\r\nlong scaly body, and surrounds with undulating folds the two\r\nconstellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.\"\r\n\r\nBringing together these different facts for the sake of comparison,\r\nwe arrive at the conclusion that the Polar Star, by whose\r\nscintillating light the early mariners steered their tiny keels,\r\nwas not the Polaris of to-day--α in Ursa Minor--but α in the\r\nconstellation of the Dragon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, those navigators of the Waterless Sea (as they poetically\r\ndesignate the desert of Sahara), have bestowed particular\r\nappellations on several stars; but they guide themselves rather by\r\ntheir radiance than by their position. Thus, such stars as α Draco,\r\nα Cepheus, α Cygnus, which have occupied, and, in the course of\r\ncenturies, will again occupy the place of Polaris, have received\r\nno special denomination; while the stars of Ursa Major, α and β\r\n(occupying the posterior angles of the chariot), are called Dubke and\r\nMerak;[10] γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, which follow in due succession--Phegæa,\r\nor Phad, Megrez, Alioth, Mizar, and Ackaïr, or Benetnasch. Certain\r\nstars in the same constellation, which are barely visible, have also\r\nreceived distinctive names: such is Alcor, a star between the fifth\r\nand sixth magnitude, in the tail of Ursa Major, between Mizar and\r\nBenetnasch. This star, it is true, had a special use: it served the\r\nArabs as the test of a good eyesight.\r\n\r\nA further proof that the Arabs founded their stellar nomenclature\r\nalmost exclusively upon the lustre and colour of the stars, is\r\nobvious in the names which they gave to the stars forming the\r\nconstellation of Orion. (See Fig. 2.) Thus, α and β, two stars of the\r\nfirst magnitude, occupying the right or eastern shoulder, and the\r\nleft or western foot of the giant-hunter, are called respectively,\r\nBetelguese and Rigel; the star γ, named Bellatrix, in the left\r\nshoulder, is of the second magnitude, like the stars δ, ε, ζ, which\r\nrepresent Orion's Belt, and bear the names of \"the Three Kings\" and\r\n\"St James's Staff.\" Now the star η marking the right knee or inferior\r\neastern angle of the brilliant trapezium, is only of the third\r\nmagnitude; therefore, it has received no special designation.\r\n\r\nThe colour by which some stars are distinguished could not have\r\nfailed to be remarked by those observers who first began to\r\nenumerate, or take census of, the celestial bodies. Thus Sirius,\r\nthe most refulgent of the stars of heaven, situated in Canis Major,\r\nis of a bluish-white, like Rigel; and Arcturus, situated on the\r\nprolongation of the tail of Ursa Major, is reddish-yellow, like\r\nBetelguese.\r\n\r\nSirius, or the Dog-star, rose heliacally at the hottest time of\r\nthe year, and hence the Greeks were accustomed to ascribe all the\r\ndiseases of the season to its influence. It was--\r\n\r\n                      \"The star\r\n    Autumnal; of all stars, in dead of night,\r\n    Conspicuous most, and named Orion's dog:\r\n    Brightest it shines, but ominous, and dire\r\n    Disease portends to miserable man.\"\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the figurative grouping of the stars, the variety of\r\ntheir luminous magnificence, their position towards Polaris, the\r\ndetermination of that position by the longitudinal circles passing\r\nthrough the axis of the world, and twisted perpendicularly to this\r\naxis by the circles parallel to the Equator,--such is the aggregate\r\nof the elements which must, at a very early period, have presided\r\nover the enumeration of those sparkling points, each of which is the\r\ncentre of a system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, are there any stars which the eye cannot perceive? Such a\r\nquestion would never have been propounded to the ancients. And why?\r\nBecause no reasoning would have drawn from them an admission that\r\nit was possible by artificial means to enlarge the range of our\r\neyesight. They would have deemed it madness to pretend to improve\r\nand develope what is not of human creation; the visual apparatus, as\r\nit is bestowed on us by nature, they supposed to be the most perfect\r\ninstrument which man could imagine. And, in truth, nothing could\r\nfairly be objected to this way of looking at things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe 48 constellations (21 northern, 12 zodiacal, and 15 austral)\r\nindicated by Ptolemæus, contain a total of 1026 stars, whose relative\r\npositions had been determined by Hipparchus. To undertake an\r\nenumeration of the stars, and to transmit the result to posterity,\r\nappeared to Pliny an audacity before which even a god would have\r\nrecoiled (_Hipparchus--ausus, rem etiam Deo improbam, annumerare\r\nposteris stellas_).[11]\r\n\r\nYet numerous doubts had already risen in the mind of Hipparchus as\r\nto the accuracy of the number recognised. In the first place, the\r\nancients undoubtedly knew, as we do, that the visual faculty is not\r\nthe same in all individuals; that there are some who, in the same\r\ncelestial space, see more stars than others. Many persons can discern\r\nup to stars of the seventh magnitude, while with others the sight\r\nfails far within that limit. The ancients must also have known, as\r\nwe do, that, for the enumeration to be complete, the sky must be\r\nobserved from all the points of the terrestrial surface on which\r\nman is planted. Even in our own days the catalogues of the southern\r\nheavens are far from being perfect. Finally, more than two thousand\r\nyears before the time of Galileo, Democritus had already enunciated\r\nthe opinion that the Milky Way was a mass of innumerable stars. All\r\nthese signs should have been accepted as warnings against premature\r\naffirmations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe invention of telescopes suddenly enlarged the question, and it\r\nbecame necessary to establish a line of demarcation between the\r\nnumber of stars visible to the naked eye and the number visible\r\nthrough the agency of the telescope. Argelander, the author of the\r\n\"Uranometria,\" has found that the stars visible to the naked eye,\r\nover the entire surface of the heavens, range from 5000 to 5800. Otto\r\nStruve, employing Herschel's method of computation, has estimated at\r\nupwards of twenty millions (20,374,034) the number of stars visible\r\nwith the Herschel 20-feet telescope.\r\n\r\nBut, in presence of all the nebulæ resolvable into stellar\r\nmasses, and before the development of the artificial range of our\r\nsight,--in presence, finally, of that hopeless perspective which\r\nthe more we discover the more we perceive how much there remains to\r\ndiscover,--are we not forcibly carried back to our point of departure?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nOught not the imagination which, at the first glance, led us to\r\nbelieve the number of stars to be infinite,--ought it not to draw us\r\nnearer to the truth?\r\n\r\nHow should the imagination reveal to us, without difficulty, what\r\nthe intellect, assisted by the senses, can only discover after ages\r\nof assiduous exertion?\r\n\r\nThese questions, it seems to us, are worthy of our studious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a table of the constellations in both hemispheres, with\r\nthe number of stars in each, for the convenience of our younger\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NORTHERN CONSTELLATIONS.\r\n\r\n    Ursa Minor, the Lesser Bear,                           24\r\n    Ursa Major, the Great Bear,                            87\r\n    Perseus, and Head of Medusa,                           59\r\n    Auriga, the Charioteer,                                66\r\n    Boötes, the Herdsman,                                  54\r\n    Draco, the Dragon,                                     80\r\n    Cepheus,                                               35\r\n    Canes Venatici, the Greyhounds Asteria and Chara,      28\r\n    Cor Caroli (Heart of Charles II.),                      3\r\n    Triangulum, the Triangle,                              16\r\n    Triangulum Minus, the Lesser Triangle,                 10\r\n    Musca, the Fly,                                         6\r\n    Lynx,                                                  44\r\n    Leo Minor, the Lesser Lion,                            53\r\n    Coma Berenicis, Hair of Queen Berenice,                43\r\n    Cameleopardalis, the Giraffe,                          58\r\n    Mons Menelaus, Mt.

As early as the winter solstice the cold began\r\nto make itself felt. In a few days the centigrade thermometer sank to\r\n12° below zero, through the influence of a very keen north-east wind.\r\nAt Paris, where, on an average, the winter temperature is two degrees\r\nhigher than in the surrounding country, the Seine was completely\r\nfrozen for upwards of a fortnight. To meet with a similar phenomenon\r\nwe must go back as far as 1788. In January 1830, when, on the 17th,\r\nthe temperature sank down to 17°.3, the Seine was also frozen, but\r\nthe ice speedily melted. The extreme cold of 1788 coincides, like\r\nthat of 1830, with the appearance of two comets. In bringing together\r\nthese and other similar facts, some writers are induced to believe\r\nthemselves authorised in establishing theories which attribute a\r\ncertain frigorific influence to the comets. But no such coincidence\r\nexisted in the winter of 1867-68, nor in any other years signalised\r\nby the occurrence of excessive frost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat are we to think of the supposed influence of the moon upon the\r\nweather?\r\n\r\nThis question, so constantly revived, is here not out of place. The\r\nexceptionally prolonged cold, during which the thermometer remained\r\nfor three weeks below zero, the barometer oscillating between 76° and\r\n76°·5, commenced on the 22d of December, three days before the new\r\nmoon; now, it is on Christmas-day, at 48 min. past 11 p.m., that the\r\nmoon is found in conjunction,--that is to say, has become completely\r\ninvisible to us by passing between the earth and the sun. And the\r\nthaw, which terminated this period of frost, commenced on the 12th\r\nof the following January, just three days after the full moon; the\r\nexact moment of its opposition, when the moon reflected upon us the\r\nwhole hemisphere of its borrowed lustre, took place on the 9th, at 2\r\nmin. past 11 in the evening. It is then in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsyzygies (conjunction and opposition) of the moon that we must place\r\nthe commencement and termination of the cold period to which we have\r\nbeen alluding.\r\n\r\nWe should not have thought of recalling these coincidences, if\r\nit had not occurred to us that some meteorologists, in accordance\r\nwith the popular belief, have attributed to the syzygies a marked\r\ninfluence on the changes of the weather. Toaldo has deduced from\r\nhalf-a-century's observations, taken at Padua, this general fact,\r\nthat the maximum of influence manifests itself at the syzygies, and\r\nsomewhat more at the new than at the full moon; that the minimum\r\ncoincides with the first and second quarter; that the action of the\r\nperigee (_minima_ distance of the moon from the earth) is equal to\r\nthat of the full moon; and that the action of the apogee (_maxima_\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth) is double that of the quarters.\r\nObserve that the Italian meteorologist extended this influence to\r\nthree days before and three days after a phase, for the moon's\r\npassage through the syzygies; while he restricted it to a day before\r\nand a day after, for the quadratures.\r\n\r\nThe work which Toaldo did for the climate of Padua, Pilgram had\r\nalready executed for that of Vienna. But the result at which he\r\narrived, after five-and-twenty years of observation (from 1763 to\r\n1788), was the contrary to that of Toaldo: namely, that the new\r\nmoon is the least active of all the phases in reference to changes\r\nof weather. What, then, are we to conclude? That the problem is one\r\nof extreme difficulty, and that there are probably several elements\r\nnecessary to its solution, which at present escape us. Then, too,\r\nwe ought to have a clear understanding of what is meant by \"changes\r\nof weather;\" we must eliminate all vagueness from the word, and not\r\nallow it to be governed by any preconceived theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW.\r\n\r\n    Thick clouds ascend, in whose capacious womb\r\n    A vapoury deluge lies, to snow congealed.\r\n    Heavy they roll their fleecy world along,\r\n    And the sky saddens with the gathered storm.\r\n    Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends;\r\n    At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes\r\n    Fall broad, and wide, and fast, dimming the day\r\n    With a continual flow.\r\n\r\n    --THOMSON, _The Seasons_.\r\n\r\nThe earth is covered with snow; it is enveloped, as the poets say, in\r\na shroud of white. But this phrase, poetical as it may appear, is, in\r\nreality, inadmissible. A shroud is used to wrap round a dead body, a\r\ncorpse, whose elements, since they are no longer maintained united by\r\nthe undefinable principle of life, go to form other compounds,--more\r\npermanent and lasting,--which will mingle with the earth, the water,\r\nand the air. But the earth which the snow covers preserves, on the\r\ncontrary, the germ of life in the seeds and roots of plants; it\r\nrests itself, only for the purpose of communicating, at the return\r\nof spring, a new impulse to the sap, whose circulation sleeps during\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe moment is propitious for studying the snow: come, then, let us\r\nexamine it.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, what is snow? Put a little into the hollow of your hand,\r\nand see what transpires.\r\n\r\nIt melts, and leaves nothing but water as a residuum.\r\n\r\nSnow, then, is frozen water,--water which existed in the atmosphere\r\nin the state of vapour, and which, to speak the language of\r\nphysicists, has passed from the gaseous state into the liquid, and\r\nthence into the solid. If you doubt its identity with water, let a\r\nchemist analyse a portion of it for you: he will tell you that it\r\nis composed, like distilled water, of hydrogen and oxygen, in the\r\nproportion of two parts of the former to one part of the latter.\r\nThe reader will, of course, understand that we abstract all foreign\r\nsubstances which may accidentally have got mixed up with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A Snowy Landscape.]\r\n\r\nIt was once a wide-spread opinion that snow is favourable to\r\nvegetation, on account of the salts which it contains. Analysis,\r\nhowever, gave a negative result; it demonstrated the absence of these\r\nsalts. Recourse was then had to another hypothesis: it was supposed\r\nthat the air contained in snow is richer in oxygen than the free air,\r\nand that to the action of this gas must be attributed its fertilising\r\nproperty. Another error! The truth really is, that snow maintains the\r\nsoil which it covers at a perceptibly constant temperature, and that,\r\nwhen thawing, it mellows it by its aqueous infiltrations; so that\r\nif, before a fall of snow, the earth has experienced the action of a\r\nstrong frost capable of killing injurious insects, all the chances\r\nwill be in favour of a fertile year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSnow forms crystals. To observe them clearly, you must examine the\r\nsnow which falls in very cold and dry weather. It then appears to be\r\na dust composed of little thin plates. Look at the small flake which\r\nhas fallen on your coat-sleeve; it is isolated; hasten to examine\r\nit before it melts, or before other flakes become amalgamated with\r\nit. What a graceful star! (Fig. 6, _a_). It is formed of six regular\r\nrays. There are others which have only three, four, or five rays. But\r\non inspecting these more closely, you see that many of these rays\r\nare broken or abortive, and that, when finally analysed, each star\r\npossesses the same number of rays.\r\n\r\nWhy are there continually six rays? Why are there never more nor\r\nfewer than this number? One might suspect in nature a peculiar\r\naffection for the number _six_; as, for example, in the cells of the\r\nbees and the wasps, which form a regular hexagon (Fig. 6, _b_). Why,\r\nin the infinity of polygons, has the instinct of these insects only\r\nchosen one hexagon? What is the reason for this preference?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a b c_\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nIf you interrogate geometry, it will reply to you that, of all the\r\npolygons inscribed in a circle (Fig. 6, _c_), there is but one whose\r\nsides are equal to the radius of that circle; and this polygon is\r\nexactly that of the bee and wasp's cell. Here, then, is a very\r\nsingular coincidence. If you afterwards examine very minutely the\r\nwork of the bee, you will find in each cell of the honeycomb a\r\npyramidal base, composed of three equal rhombs, whose angles solve a\r\ngrand geometrical problem, that of giving the maximum of space with\r\nthe minimum of matter. The papier-maché combs of the wasp are formed\r\nof a single row of cells, each of which has a nearly level bottom.\r\nThis is all that is required; for these cells are destined, not for\r\nthe reception of honey, but only of the larvæ, the offspring of their\r\narchitects.\r\n\r\nDo not think that you have but to pick up a thumbful of snow to\r\nprocure your crystals! These change their form very quickly, and\r\nit is almost impossible to detect it in snow which has remained\r\nfor any length of time upon the ground. The great flakes which\r\nfall in relatively mild weather, when the temperature borders upon\r\nfreezing-point, are often nothing better than masses of small\r\namorphous atoms of ice; to get at the crystals, you must remove the\r\nkind of icy varnish which encases them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the accurate observation of the crystallisation of water which\r\nprecipitates itself in the air, we have at our disposal a means\r\nas simple as convenient--a pane of glass. All we have to do is to\r\narrange everything in such a manner that the congelation shall\r\nbe both slow and certain; on this condition alone can we obtain\r\nwell-defined crystals. A cold room is best adapted for this kind of\r\nexperimentation; and thus you will frequently see deposited upon the\r\nwindow-glass, in an uninhabited chamber, some exceedingly graceful\r\ndesigns, as follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nThese are asteriæ,--arborescent, and leaf-like crystals,--imitating\r\nthe beautiful foliage of ferns and mosses. The severer the cold, the\r\nmore regular, be it understood, is the formation of these crystals.\r\n\r\nOwing to its dazzling whiteness, snow is a great reflector of light,\r\nand singularly illuminates the darkness of the winter nights. The\r\nlong dreary nights of the polar world are lit up by the glories\r\nof the magnetic auroras, joined to the radiancy of the snow. This\r\ninduces us to repeat a question which we have often addressed to\r\nourselves, namely,--under what aspect must the very varied changes\r\nwhich the solar light experiences on the surface of our planet be\r\npresented to the inhabitants of Mars and Venus? A more attentive\r\nobservation of the ashen-gray light of the moon, which appears to be\r\nprincipally produced by the reflection of the more or less luminous\r\nface of the earth, may perhaps one day provide us with an answer to\r\nour question.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this subject, let us remember that both snow and\r\nfrost are of great utility to the husbandman. The latter, by\r\nexpanding the humidity with which the hard clods are penetrated,\r\ncrumbles them into powder, and renders stiff land porous, friable,\r\nand mellow. It also clears the soil from the plague of insect life,\r\nwhich, if it increased without so powerful a check, would probably\r\nprove a terrible injury to the crops. Moreover, it so hardens in\r\nwinter the moist soft ground as to permit of the necessary field\r\noperations being carried on. Snow, as Dr Child remarks,[12] is even\r\nmore useful. It covers up the tender plants with a thick mantle,\r\nwhich defends them against the attacks of excessive cold. \"God\r\ngiveth snow like wool,\" and for somewhat the same purposes as wool.\r\nThe mantle which so closely wraps about the gaunt limbs of the\r\nwinter-stricken earth neither allows the internal heat to escape\r\nnor the external cold to enter in. It has been found that the\r\ninner surface of the snow seldom falls much below 32° F., although\r\nthe temperature of the external air may be many degrees under the\r\nfreezing-point; and it is known that this amount of cold can be\r\nendured by the crops without injury, so long as their covering\r\nprotects them from the raking influence of the wind. In climates\r\nwhere the winter's cold is longer and more intense than in England,\r\nthe protective influence of snow is much more plainly shown. Where it\r\nlies long and deep, it opens out routes that were impracticable in\r\nsummer on account of their ruggedness, and prepares a smooth path for\r\nthe sledge, or for the \"lumberer,\" over which the largest trunks of\r\nthe forest may be carried with ease to the river or canal.\r\n\r\nIn the polar regions (we quote from Dr Child) snow supplies the\r\never-ready material out of which the Esquimaux construct their\r\nhouses, and hardy explorers extemporise the huts in which they find\r\nshelter when absent from their ships on distant expeditions. Nor are\r\nthe ships themselves considered \"snug winter quarters\" until their\r\nsides have been banked up in walls of snow, and the roof raised over\r\nthe deck has been thickly covered with it. Snow huts are warmer than\r\nmight have been expected. If built upon ice over the sea, their\r\ntemperature is sensibly influenced by the heat of the unfrozen water\r\nbelow, which is said seldom to fall much under 40º F. in any part of\r\nthe ocean. Even where the external temperature has sunk to 20º or\r\n30º below zero, sufficient warmth is produced in a snow hut by the\r\nhuddling together of three or four persons within it. When Dr Elisha\r\nKane, the American explorer, passed a cold arctic winter's night in a\r\nhut beyond Smith's Sound, the temperature produced by its complement\r\nof lodgers, and two or three oil lamps, reached 90º F.; so that he\r\nwas compelled by the heat to follow the example of the rest of the\r\nparty, and partially to divest himself of his clothing. Yet in lat.\r\n79º N., Dr Kane marked a temperature of 75º below zero in the month\r\nof February. No fluid could resist it. Even chloric ether became\r\nsolid, and the air was pungent and acrid in respiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SNOW.\r\n\r\nAs if it had been ordained that there should be nothing absolute in\r\nnature, snow itself, the very type of whiteness, sometimes exhibits\r\nthe most curious colouring. Who, for instance, has not heard tell of\r\n_red snow_? Its existence was even known to Pliny, the great Roman\r\nnaturalist, and he attributed it to a dust with which the snow became\r\ncovered after it had lain several days on the ground. \"Snow itself,\"\r\nhe says[13] \"reddens with old age\" (_Ipsa nix vetustate rubescit_).\r\n\r\nBenedict de Saussure was the first who described red snow like a\r\nnaturalist.[14] He observed it on the occasion of his ascent of\r\nMont Breven, near Chamounix, in 1760; and was greatly astonished\r\nat seeing the snow tinted in various places of an extremely vivid\r\nred. \"In the middle of each patch,\" he says, \"was the greatest\r\nintensity of colour, and the middle, moreover, was of a lower level\r\nthan the edges. On examining this red snow closely, I saw that its\r\ncolour depended upon a fine powder which mingled with it, and which\r\npenetrated to a depth of two or three inches. This powder could not\r\nhave descended from the summit of the mountain, since it was found in\r\nlocalities isolated and even remote from the rocks; nor did it seem\r\nto have been deposited by the winds, since it did not lie in drifts.\r\nOne would have said that it was a production of the snow itself, a\r\nresiduum of its thaw.... What at first suggested this opinion was the\r\nfact that the colour, extremely weak on the edges of each concave\r\npatch, gradually grew deeper as it approached the bottom, where the\r\ntrickling water had carried down a greater quantity of residuum.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe learned Swiss naturalist found this red snow on many other\r\nmountains, and during a certain period of thaw, subjected it to\r\nvarious experiments, which led him to the conclusion that it was a\r\nvegetable matter, \"a dust, or pollen, of the stamens of plants.\"\r\nSlightly odorous, it exhaled, during combustion, a scent not unlike\r\nthat of sealing-wax.\r\n\r\nRamond met with red snow in the Pyrenees, at an elevation of 7800\r\nfeet. He discovered in it, when burnt on incandescent coals, the\r\nodour of opium or of chicory. He supposed that the little deep red\r\nlamellæ which coloured the snow were mica, and looked upon the mica\r\nas a product of the decomposition of the rocks by the action of the\r\nsun and breezes of spring. But this opinion was overthrown by Captain\r\nRoss, who, in 1819, found red snow in Baffin's Bay (lat. 85° 54'\r\nN.), to a depth of thirteen feet, over a soil perfectly free from\r\nmica. Other explorers affirm that in those regions they have never\r\nmet with the red snow more than three to four inches deep. Captain\r\nParry, in his Polar voyage, found this coloured snow principally\r\nin the track of his sledges; and, agreeing with Sir John Ross, he\r\nsupposed it to derive its redness from the presence of a kind of\r\nmushroom, of the genus _Uredo_, to which Bauer has given the name\r\nof _Uredo nivalis_.[15] According to experiments made by Bauer on\r\nspecimens brought from the Polar regions, these tiny mushrooms are,\r\non the average, a fiftieth of a millimètre in diameter; they develop\r\nthemselves like vegetables; the youngest are sometimes colourless;\r\nwhen entirely freed from snow, they grow black under the influence of\r\nan intense cold, without losing their germinative faculty, and give\r\nbirth, under the influence of a higher temperature, to a green matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us continue to examine the difference of opinion between\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle declared the red snow of the polar regions to be\r\nidentical with that of the Alps, after having carefully compared\r\nthe two. But he saw in it a genus of cryptogams, differing from the\r\ngenus _Uredo_.[16] Robert Brown asserted that it was a kind of alga,\r\nallied to the _Tremella cruenta_. Azara was of this same opinion,\r\nexcept that, instead of a tremella, he recognised in it an alga of\r\nthe genus _Protococcus_, which he called _Protococcus kermesinus_,\r\nbecause its colour resembled that of the kermes, or cochineal.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the observers whom we have cited, the colouring\r\ncorpuscles of the snow belong to the vegetable kingdom. This opinion\r\nwas supported by numerous adherents, and soon acquired so great\r\nan authority, that, in an assembly of naturalists at Lausanne, De\r\nCandolle overwhelmed with sarcasm a communication from Lamont, Prior\r\nof the Hospice of St Bernard, on the \"animality of red snow.\" And yet\r\nthis last hypothesis was not so rash as might have been supposed; for\r\nDr Scoresby, to whom we owe a profound study on the crystalline forms\r\nof snow, had already attributed to an animal matter the colouring of\r\nthe snow and polar ice.\r\n\r\nNow-a-days, however, it may be regarded as finally settled that\r\nthis phenomenon is due to the immense aggregation of minute plants\r\nbelonging to the species called _Protococcus nivalis_;[17] so\r\ncalled in allusion to the extreme simplicity of its organisation,\r\nand the peculiar nature of its habitat. If we place a portion of\r\nthe snow coloured with this plant upon a piece of white paper,\r\nsays Mr Macmillan,[18] and allow it to melt and evaporate, we find\r\na residuum of granules just sufficient to give a faint crimson\r\ntinge to the paper. Placed under the microscope, these granules\r\nresolve themselves into spherical purple cells, from the 1/1000th\r\nto the 1/3000th part of an inch in diameter. Each of these cells\r\nhas an opening, surrounded by serrated or indented lines, whose\r\nsmallest diameter does not exceed the 1/5000th part of an inch! When\r\nperfect, the plant is not unlike a red-currant berry; as it decays,\r\nthe red colouring matter fades into a deep orange, and the deep\r\norange changes into a dull brown. The thickness of the wall of the\r\ncell does not exceed the 1/20000th part of an inch! Each cell may\r\nbe considered a distinct individual plant, since it is perfectly\r\nindependent of others with which it may be aggregated, and performs\r\nfor and by itself all the functions of growth and reproduction,\r\nhaving a containing membrane which absorbs liquids and gases from\r\nthe surrounding matrix or elements, a contained fluid of peculiar\r\ncharacter, formed out of these materials, and a number of excessively\r\nminute granules, equivalent to spores, or, as some would say, to\r\ncellular buds, which are to become the genus of new plants. There is\r\nsomething, adds Mr Macmillan, extremely mysterious in the performance\r\nof these widely different functions, by an organism which appears\r\nso excessively simple. That one and the same primitive cell should\r\nthus minister equally to absorption, nutrition, and reproduction,\r\nis an extraordinary illustration of the fact, that the smallest and\r\nsimplest organised object is, in itself, and for the part it was\r\ncreated to perform in the operations of nature, as admirably adapted\r\nas the largest and most complicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Protococcus nivalis.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ETERNAL SNOWS.\r\n\r\nThe epithet \"eternal\" or \"perpetual,\" applied to snow, would appear\r\nto savour of the ambitious, if not of the profane. Can we say of\r\nanything which belongs to earth that it is \"eternal?\" Assuredly not.\r\nThe earth has not always worn the aspect which it now wears, and, at\r\na period not far distant from its origin, could not in any region\r\nhave been covered with snow. Now, whatever has had a beginning cannot\r\nbe eternal. Many authors have, for this reason, substituted for\r\nthe word _eternal_ the word _perpetual_. But the latter is equally\r\ninapplicable. Who will venture to affirm that our globe or its system\r\nwill endure _perpetually_?\r\n\r\nThis difficulty, however, is one which need not particularly\r\nembarrass us. We have been long accustomed to look upon language as a\r\nsimple mask, or, at least, as a very dubious interpreter of thought.\r\nAnd we shall, therefore, continue to use indifferently the words\r\n\"eternal\" and \"perpetual.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that two travellers set out from the equator,\r\nthat plane of separation between the northern and the southern\r\nhemispheres. Let us also suppose that each proceeds in a\r\ndiametrically opposite direction to the other, pursuing his route\r\nalong one of those meridian lines which divide the earth into\r\nlongitudinal portions, like the slices of a melon (to compare great\r\nthings with small). The following will be their climatic stages:--\r\n\r\n At first the two travellers will each traverse a moiety of the\r\n _torrid zone_, limited below and above the Equator by two parallel\r\n circles,--in the northern hemisphere by the Tropic of Cancer, and in\r\n the southern by the Tropic of Capricorn. Do not let these appellations\r\n alarm you: they show, once more, the narrow connexity of the heaven\r\n with the earth; _tropic_, coming from the Greek τροπή signifies a\r\n return--the sun returns from his apparent excursions, after having\r\n passed from the tropics to the zenith. For these circles form the\r\n extreme limits of the sun's march towards the north and towards the\r\n south: they are the two solstices--the summer solstice, when the sun\r\n enters the zodiacal sign of Cancer, and the winter solstice, when it\r\n enters the sign of Capricorn. The torrid zone is the only one which\r\n is thus divided into two portions by the Equinoctial, and which the\r\n sun passes twice a year to the zenith, that is, to the point directly\r\n above the heads of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAfter having crossed the tropics, one of our two travellers will\r\nenter the _North Temperate Zone_, bounded by the Arctic Polar\r\nCircle--the other, the _South Temperate Zone_, bounded by the\r\nAntarctic Polar Circle. Having passed the polar circles, they will\r\nfind themselves speedily arrested by ice and snow which never\r\nmelt--by eternal ice and snow. These inhospitable regions compose\r\nthe two _frigid zones_, which cover, like two immense hoods (forming\r\nthe 0·82 parts of the terrestrial surface), the one, the northern\r\nhemisphere, the other, the southern.[19]\r\n\r\nIn their progress through these various climates, our two travellers\r\nwill arrive at a very curious comparative result,--that the southern\r\nhemisphere is colder than the northern. This difference becomes\r\nespecially recognisable below the 50th degree of south latitude;\r\nso that, after passing the Antarctic Circle, the ice opposes the\r\nvoyager's course with nearly insurmountable obstacles; while, in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, the whaler frequently penetrates to Spitzbergen,\r\nsituated much nearer to the Pole than to the Polar Circle. This is a\r\ngeneral fact; we confine ourselves to putting it forward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that our two travellers, always ready to compare\r\nthe results of their inquiries, accomplish the ascent of a very\r\nlofty mountain situated under the Equator, such as Chimborazo. In\r\nthe course of their ascent, they will traverse the same climates and\r\nthe same zones which had marked the stages of their journey from\r\nthe Equator to the Poles: at their starting-point they will find\r\nthemselves in the Torrid zone, then will come the Temperate and\r\nthe Frigid zones, the latter rendered inaccessible by glaciers and\r\neternal snows. These vertical zones of the mountain are characterised\r\nby vegetables and animals whose types are found in the corresponding\r\nhorizontal zones of the terrestrial surface. But what is most\r\nremarkable is, that there exists between the northern and the\r\nsouthern slopes of the mountain the same difference as between the\r\nsouthern and northern hemispheres: the line of the eternal snows\r\ndescends much lower on the northern than on the southern slope,\r\nin the same manner as, in the southern hemisphere, the polar ice\r\nadvances much nearer the Equator than in the northern.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general view-point which we must adopt for the clearer\r\ncomprehension of the details of observation. Of course, when speaking\r\nof the limit of the eternal snows, we refer only to the _lower_\r\nlimit, that is to say, to the greatest elevation attained by the\r\nsnow-line in the course of a single year. As for the _upper_ limit,\r\nit entirely escapes us; for the summits of the loftiest mountains\r\ndo not reach the atmospheric strata which, by virtue of their\r\nrefraction, cannot contain any vesicular, aqueous, or condensable\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nThe line of eternal snow which, _at the poles_, is found on the level\r\nof the ground, gradually rises as we approach the torrid zone, where\r\nit attains its maximum of elevation, from 13,000 to 17,000 feet.\r\nThis phenomenon does not exclusively depend upon the geographical\r\nlatitude, nor on the mean annual temperature of the locality: it is\r\nthe result of an aggregate of diverse circumstances which we have not\r\nthe space here to enumerate and discuss. We shall content ourselves\r\nwith placing before the reader a table which will show the remarkable\r\ndifferences existing in the height of the perpetual snow-line in\r\nvarious places.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW.\r\n\r\n    +-----------+-------------------------+----------------+\r\n    | Latitude. |         Place.          |   Height of    |\r\n    |  (Degs.)  |                         |   Snow-Line.   |\r\n    +-----------+-------------------------+----------------+\r\n    |    79 N.  | Spitzbergen             |          0     |\r\n    |    71     | Mageroe (Norway)        |      2,350     |\r\n    | 70 to 60  | Norway (Interior of)    | 3,500 to 5,100 |\r\n    |    65     | Iceland                 |      3,050     |\r\n    |    54     | Oonalashka (W.

They have never\r\npermanently inhabited the polar regions and the perpetually snowy\r\nsummits of the mountains: it is only at intervals that a few pioneers\r\nhave temporarily ventured thither. Starting from this fact, it was\r\nlong believed that the zone of eternal snows was not inhabited by\r\nany living being. Even men of science admitted, as an article of\r\nfaith, that where man could not fix his residence no animal could\r\nlive. They made, however, a concession with respect to vegetables,\r\nand particularly as regarded the lichens and the mosses.\r\n\r\nWell, observation and research conjointly, have erased this article\r\nof faith from the scientific code. It has been demonstrated that\r\nthe icy regions, which man visits only at rare intervals, and\r\nwhere he sojourns but for a time, are the home of a certain number\r\nof animal species, more or less allied to the human species. The\r\nscientific exploration of these regions dates only from our own time.\r\nSpitzbergen, and the summit of the Alps,--such are our points of\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive of anything more interesting than the\r\nhistorical exposition of the limited _Fauna glacialis_. First, let us\r\ntake the discovery, comparatively recent, of a small rodent of the\r\nmouse order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARVICOLA LEUCURUS, OR ARCTIC VOLE.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of January 1832, a Swiss naturalist, M. Hugi, started\r\nfrom Soleure to study the winter condition of the classic glacier of\r\nGrindelwald. The undertaking was in many respects a difficult one;\r\nthe sides of the Mettenberg, bordering on this glacier, were covered\r\nwith an uniform stratum of hardened snow; a pathway had to be cut out\r\nwith the pickaxe. M. Hugi and his companions did not arrive at the\r\nStierreg until towards evening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Among the Alps.]\r\n\r\nA goatherd lives there during the summer. They sought around and\r\nabout for his little cabin, but, on the uniform white carpet of snow\r\nwhich covered everything, no sign of it could be detected. At length\r\nthey came upon a little mound, which they immediately proceeded to\r\nexcavate; and late in the night they discovered the roof of the hut.\r\nThey then redoubled their efforts to sweep away the snow obstructing\r\nthe door. On opening it a score of mice emerged from the cabin, some\r\nof which they killed.\r\n\r\nFor a picture of the poor victims we are indebted to M. Hugi. \"These\r\nlittle rodents are of a yellowish gray, and very slender; from the\r\nhead to the tip of the tail they measure about nine inches. The hind\r\npaws are of a length wholly disproportionate to the fore paws. The\r\ntail and ears are naked; their transparency is remarkable.... This\r\nanimal,\" adds M. Hugi, \"appeared to me completely unknown, and I do\r\nnot remember to have seen it in any zoological collection.\"\r\n\r\nAfter determining its genus and species, the intrepid explorer of the\r\nAlps was entitled to have given it a name; but this honour escaped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--The Arctic Vole.]\r\n\r\nThe same little rodent has since been found in many other parts of\r\nthe Alps; notably among the rocks of the Grands-Mulets, some 12,500\r\nfeet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\nDesirous of comparing the climate of Spitzbergen with that of the\r\nsummit of the Alps, M. Martins established himself, in 1841, with\r\nhis friend, A. Bravais, on the Faulhorn. \"While,\" he says, \"we were\r\nengaged in our experiments, we often perceived a little animal\r\npassing swiftly by us, and stealthily gliding into its burrow. We\r\nremarked that it was also found in the _auberge_, or inn, and that\r\nit fed upon Alpine plants. At the first glance, its resemblance to\r\nthe common mouse led us to think that this inconvenient guest had\r\nfollowed man into his abode on the Faulhorn, as it had formerly\r\ncrossed the seas on board ship. But a more attentive examination\r\nshowed me that, far from being a mouse, it was a species of vole,\r\nwhich had hitherto escaped the researches of naturalists. I\r\ndesignated it by the name of the snow-vole, _Arvicola nivalis_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the same animal which M. Hugi had discovered nine years\r\nbefore. The ice was broken, and names, both generic and specific,\r\nafterwards fell like hail on the body of our poor little rodent. Some\r\nwould have had it called--\r\n\r\n    Hypudæus alpinus.\r\n    Hypudæus petrophilus.\r\n    Hypudæus nivicola.\r\n    Hypudæus Hugei.\r\n\r\nOthers, and fewer in number, preferred the designation of\r\n\"White-tailed Vole,\"--\r\n\r\n      Arvicola leucurus.\r\n\r\nOthers again, \"the Lebrun vole,\"--\r\n\r\n      Arvicola Lebrunii.\r\n\r\nWhich of all these names shall prevail? We cannot say, and it matters\r\nvery little to us. Perhaps the nomenclators may in time agree among\r\nthemselves upon the appellation of the genus. However this may be, we\r\nknow--and it is an important fact--that a mammal exists at altitudes\r\nwhere men could not live, and that he is found in the Alps, above\r\neven the lower limit of the perpetual snows. Is it the only mammal\r\nwhich can live at such a height?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MARMOT.\r\n\r\nWho, in the wide world of London, where so many waifs and strays are\r\ndrifting with the great current of human life, has not observed the\r\nSavoyard wanderer with his dancing marmot? If the man did not attract\r\nour notice, his curious companion would. In form he belongs partly\r\nto the bear, and partly to the rat. Naturalists have, therefore,\r\nexpressly created for him the genus _Arctomys_,--a Latinised Greek\r\nname, signifying \"The Bear-Rat.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, the marmot resembles Harlequin's cloak, or rather, if it\r\nbe permissible to compare little things with great, the Austrian\r\nEmpire,--a composite of territories and races; and Buffon has\r\ndescribed him very aptly. He has, he says, the nose, the lips,\r\nand the shape of the head of the hare; the hair and nails of the\r\nbadger; the teeth of the beaver; the cat's whiskers; the eyes of the\r\ndormouse; the feet of the bear, with a short tail and truncated ears.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that the marmot--he is a little larger than a rabbit--is\r\nomnivorous like man and the bear, with whom he shares his aptitude\r\nfor dance and sport. While he eats any and everything, he\r\nnevertheless prefers vegetable food to all other kinds; and with his\r\norange-coloured incisors gnaws the bark of shrubs. He rarely drinks,\r\nbut when he does drink takes a hearty draught; is particularly fond\r\nof milk; drinks it by raising his head at each mouthful, like a hen,\r\nand giving utterance to an audible murmur of contentment, just as\r\nif he were reciting his _Benedicite_. Will it be in allusion to\r\nthis characteristic that the common French phrase has originated,\r\n_Marmotter des prières_?[20]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the marmots inhabit the snowy summits of the Alps.\r\nAt the beginning of autumn they descend to a lower level, for the\r\npurpose of excavating the burrows in which they pass the winter,\r\ncompletely benumbed by the frost. This is the time when the hunters\r\neasily capture them; they have nothing to do but to dig (_creuser_\r\nis the technical word); and frequently they are found as many as ten\r\nor twelve in the same burrow, rolled up like balls, and buried in a\r\nlitter of hay. Their sleep, says De Saussure, is so profound, that\r\nthe hunter deposits them in his sack and carries them away without\r\nawakening them. The Chamounix hunters, he adds, have already entirely\r\nexpelled or destroyed the goats formerly so abundant on their\r\nmountains; and it is probable that, in less than a century, we shall\r\nsee neither chamois nor marmots.\r\n\r\nThis prophecy of De Saussure's is on the point of being realised.\r\nStill, even at the present day, marmots are not very rare in the\r\nValais and the canton of Ticino (du Tissin), where they are called\r\n_Mure montane_ (mountain rats); a phrase from which is derived,\r\nwithout doubt, the appellation _marmot_. They prefer as their abode\r\nthe stony islets which rise here and there in the midst of the rocks.\r\nThe ears of travellers who venture into the barrenest recesses of the\r\nAlps of the Bernese Oberland are sometimes struck by a very sharp\r\nwhistling, for which, at first, they find it difficult to account. It\r\nis the young marmot's cry of alarm; for the old appear to be deprived\r\nof this strident faculty.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable period only a single species was known--the marmot\r\nproperly so called (_Arctomys marmotta_, Gmelin); but four others\r\nmust now be added:--1st, The marmot of the Caucasus (_Arctomys\r\nmusicus_), still imperfectly known; 2d, The marmot of Canada\r\n(_Arctomys empetra_), who clambers up the trees like a cat, and is\r\ndistributed throughout all North America, particularly in Hudson's\r\nBay, and Alaska, on the north-west coast; 3d, The _Arctomys monax_,\r\nwho appears to be peculiar to Maryland; 4th, The Russian marmot\r\n(_Arctomys citillus_), of the size of a field-mouse, and of a brown\r\ncolour, spotted with white; 5th, The marmot of Siberia (_Arctomys\r\nbobac_), smaller than the common species, of a yellow gray, and\r\nbuilding vast burrows shaped like a funnel.\r\n\r\nWill the reader permit us an allusion, in passing, to a question\r\nwhich we do not see discussed in books of natural history? Formerly\r\namong the treasures of ancient druggists figured a kind of panacea,\r\ncalled \"Graetz's balls.\" What were these \"Graetz's balls,\" at one\r\ntime esteemed as a universal medicine, but no longer included in our\r\npharmacopeia?\r\n\r\nThis was their origin:--The subterranean dwellings which certain\r\nspecies of marmots construct with so much skill, are each composed\r\nof two galleries, which unite together like the arms of a Y, and\r\nterminate in a _cul-de-sac_. There are found the globules of clay\r\nknown as \"Graetz's balls.\" They are an industrial product of\r\nour rodents, as M. Oscar Schmidt established in 1866, by close\r\nobservation of the _Arctomys bobac_ of the Zoological Garden of\r\nVienna. The marmot creates these balls by scratching up the earth,\r\nand appears to amuse himself--a child's amusement!--by rolling them\r\nto and fro in his galleries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMOIS.\r\n\r\n                  \"Even so\r\n    This way the chamois leapt.\"[21]\r\n\r\nMust we omit this graceful ruminant from the number of mammals\r\ninhabiting the eternal snows? No; for it is not of his own will that\r\nthe chamois has taken refuge upon the snowy peaks of the Alps. If we\r\nmeet with him there, it is because he seeks to shelter himself from\r\nthe destructive instincts of man.\r\n\r\nThe chamois is one of those animal species which, before a century,\r\nperhaps, will have disappeared; his bones will then figure in the\r\npalæontological museums by the side of the skeletons of extinct\r\nspecies. There, too, will be displayed the famous _chamois balls_,\r\neach of the size of a nut, covered with a shining substance\r\nresembling leather, of an agreeable odour, and seeming to be a morbid\r\ndejection, composed of roots and other undigested matter. These\r\nballs, the _bezoars_ of the old physicians, were regarded as a remedy\r\nagainst every ill the human flesh is heir to; it was even professed\r\nthat they rendered soldiers invulnerable, and were a better defence\r\nagainst bullets than the finest armour ever wrought by the smiths of\r\nMilan. How precious a remedy for this epoch of civilisation, when\r\nman--is he much wiser than his supposed progenitor, the ape?--seeks\r\nto replace the cholera and the pestilence by the most terrific\r\nengines of destruction!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe birds inhabiting the inhospitable region of the snows are more\r\nnumerous than the mammals. Let us briefly refer to a few of the more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAGLE AND THE WREN.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the eagle, Tennyson's noble lines to that \"imperial\r\nbird\" will occur to every reader, from the force and clearness of the\r\npicture which they present:--\r\n\r\n    \"He clasps the crag with hookèd hands;\r\n    Close to the sun in lonely lands,\r\n    Ringed with the azure world, he stands.\r\n\r\n    \"The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;\r\n    He watches from his mountain walls,\r\n    And like a thunderbolt he falls.\"\r\n\r\nThe affection of the eagle for his \"mountain walls\" may be easily\r\nunderstood. This giant bird, with his carnivorous instincts, is\r\nendowed with a remarkable tenacity of life, and can exist in habitats\r\nwholly inaccessible to man. But it is strange that a bird, which\r\nis as common a type of humility as the eagle is of ambition, and\r\nwhich we almost always cite as a contrast to the eagle--we mean, the\r\ndelicate little wren--should also be found among the snow and ice,\r\nthe silence and solitude, of the loftiest mountain regions.\r\n\r\nTo study the flight of the eagle, we should repair to Alpine\r\nhighlands. When he has reached a certain altitude of the atmosphere,\r\nthe royal bird descends obliquely, as upon an inclined plane, with\r\na rush and a din of wings, and at a speed of upwards of thirty-six\r\nyards per second. We assured ourselves of the accuracy of this fact\r\nduring an ascent of Mount Hochkœrpf, in the canton of Glaris. The\r\nbird traversed in six minutes a space of 40,000 Swiss feet, which\r\nis equal to about forty yards per second. This result agrees, on\r\nthe whole, with the observations of a traveller, who wrote in the\r\n_Nouvelle Gazette de Zurich_, on the 26th of August 1863:--\r\n\r\n\"A society of tourists set out from Corri to climb the Stützerhorn,\r\nwhich is 8400 feet in height. From the summit they perceived an\r\nenormous eagle, which, having taken his flight from Calanda, beyond\r\nthe Rhine, directed his course towards the Stützerhorn, for the\r\npurpose of halting, after a certain inflection, on the side of the\r\nRothhorn.\"\r\n\r\nThe duration of the flight was five minutes; the interval between\r\nthe starting-point and the point of arrival, two French leagues and\r\na half. In three hundred seconds, therefore, the eagle must have\r\ntraversed a space of 3000 Swiss feet, which is equal to a speed of\r\nforty-five yards per second. Hence, the swiftness of the eagle's\r\nflight is nearly equal to the velocity of sound.\r\n\r\nOne of the most admirable descriptions of the habits of this bird\r\nwith which we are acquainted, is furnished by the well-known\r\nnaturalist Macgillivray:--\r\n\r\n\"There he stands\"--on his lonely crag--\"nearly erect, with his\r\ntail depressed, his large wings half raised by his side, his neck\r\nstretched out, and his eye glistening as he glances around. Like\r\nother robbers of the desert, he has a noble aspect, an imperative\r\nmien, a look of proud defiance; but his nobility has a cast of\r\nclownishness, and his falconship a vulturine tinge. Still he is a\r\nnoble bird, powerful, independent, proud, and ferocious, regardless\r\nof the weal or woe of others, and intent only on the gratification of\r\nhis own appetite; without generosity, without honour; bold against\r\nthe defenceless, but ever ready to sneak from danger. Such is his\r\nnobility, about which men have so raved.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly he raises his wings, for he has heard the whistle of the\r\nshepherd on the crag, and bounding forward, he springs into the air.\r\nHardly do those vigorous flaps serve at first to prevent his descent,\r\nbut now curving upwards, he glides majestically along. As he passes\r\nthe corner of that buttressed and battlemented crag, forth rush two\r\nravens from their nest, croaking fiercely. While one flies above\r\nhim, the other steals beneath, and they essay to strike him, but\r\ndare not, for they have an instinctive knowledge of the power of his\r\ngrasp; and, after following him a little way, they return to their\r\nhome, vainly exulting in the thought of having driven him from their\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n\"But on a far journey, he advances in a direct line, flapping his\r\ngreat wings at regular intervals, then shooting along without seeming\r\nto move them. In ten minutes he has progressed three miles, although\r\nhe is in no haste, and now disappears behind the shoulder of the\r\nhill. But we may follow him in imagination, for his habits being well\r\nknown to us, we may be allowed the ornithological license of tracing\r\nthem in continuance.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Eagle's Habitat.]\r\n\r\nHomeward bound,--Mr Macgillivray continues,--after having supplied\r\nhis own wants, he knows that his young must be provided with\r\nfood. Therefore he sweeps across the moor, at a height of two or\r\nthree hundred feet, bending his course to either side, his wings\r\nwide-spread, his neck and feet retracted, now beating the air, and\r\nagain sailing smoothly along. Suddenly he halts, poises himself for\r\na moment, stoops, but recovers himself without touching the ground.\r\nThe object of his regards, a golden plover, which he spied on her\r\nnest, has contrived to elude him, and he does not care to pursue\r\nher. Now, then, he ascends a little, wheels in short abrupt curves,\r\npresently rushes down headlong, assumes the horizontal position when\r\nclose to the ground, prevents himself from being dashed against it by\r\nexpanding his wings and tail, thrusts forth his talons, and grasping\r\na poor, terrified ptarmigan that sat cowering among the gray lichens,\r\nsqueezes it to death, raises his head exultingly, utters a clear,\r\nshrill cry, and, rising from the ground, pursues his journey.\r\n\r\nAs he passes a tall cliff overhanging a silent lake, he is attacked\r\nby a fierce peregrine falcon, which darts and plunges at him, as\r\nif resolved to deprive him of his booty, or drive him headlong to\r\nthe ground. A more formidable foe is this than the raven; and the\r\neagle, with a scream and a yelp, throws himself into postures of\r\ndefence, until, at length, the hawk, perceiving that the tyrant has\r\nno intention of plundering his nest, leaves him to pursue his course\r\nwithout further molestation. Over dense woods, and green fields,\r\nand scattered hamlets, the eagle speeds; and now he enters the long\r\nriver-valley, near whose upper end, cradled in mist, rises the rock\r\nof his eyrie. About a mile from it he meets his mate, who has been\r\nabroad on a similar design, and is returning with a white hare as\r\nher spoil. With loud strident cries they congratulate each other,\r\ncries that alarm the drowsy shepherd on the green strath below, who,\r\nremembering the lambs carried off in spring-time, discharges at them\r\na volley of maledictions.\r\n\r\nTheir nest is of considerable size, but rudely constructed; a pile\r\nof twigs and heather and dead sticks, somewhat hollow in the middle,\r\nwhere lies a thin deposit of wool and feathers. Here repose the\r\neaglets, two in number, and clothed in soft white down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The Lammergeier.]\r\n\r\nIndependently of the species which, like the _Pandion haliætus_, and\r\nthe _Aquila nævia_, inhabit the lower regions, the eagles which visit\r\nthe Alps are very remarkable. Thus, the species of _Gypaëtos_, which\r\nthe inhabitants designate under the name of the _Lammergeier_, or\r\n\"Lamb-slayer,\" is the European condor. The spread of his wings is\r\nabout ten feet; he weighs from eighteen to twenty-four pounds, and\r\ncan easily carry off in his talons kids, lambs, and even children.\r\n\r\nThe _Steinadler_, which, like the preceding, belongs to the\r\ninaccessible mountains of the cantons of Glaris, Schwyz, the Grisons,\r\nAppenzell, and Berne, would seem to be a variety or sub-species of\r\nthe _Aquila imperialis_. The inhabitants of Eblingen, a village on\r\nthe borders of the Lake of Brienz, hunt him vigorously. Finally, some\r\neagles there are which only sojourn in the Alps temporarily; they\r\nappear to be astray; such are--\r\n\r\n      The _Circæetus leucopsis_, which has a particular affection for\r\n      serpent-haunted districts;\r\n\r\n      The _Haliætus leucocephala_, with head and tail of a milky white,\r\n      belonging to the north of Europe and America; and\r\n\r\n      The _Neophron percnopterus_, or Egyptian eagle, of carrion-like\r\n      odour, which is sometimes met with in the neighbourhood of Geneva.\r\n\r\nThe tawny-headed vulture (_Vultur fulvus_), and the ashy vulture\r\n(_Vultur cinereus_), with gray-brown mouth, and a brownish collar\r\nround his bare neck, are extremely rare in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we now take leave of the eagle, and turn our attention to the\r\nlowly wren, whose charming but simple music has been described in\r\ncharming but simple verse by Bishop Mant:--\r\n\r\n    \"The quick note of the russet wren,\r\n    Familiar to the haunts of men;\r\n    He quits in hollowed wall his bower,\r\n    And through the winter's gloomy hour\r\n    Sings cheerily; nor yet hath lost\r\n    His blitheness, chilled by pinching frost,\r\n    Nor yet is forced for warmth to cleave\r\n    To caverned nook or straw-built cave,--\r\n    Sing, gentle bird! sing on, designed\r\n    A lesson for our anxious kind,\r\n    That we, like thee, with hearts content\"----\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The Wren.]\r\n\r\nThe wren here referred to is a British species, the common wren, or\r\n_Troglodytes vulgaris_, one of the smallest of our British songsters;\r\na restless, lively bird, which twitters about the hedgerows in\r\nsummer, and about the garden and shrubbery in winter, and chanting\r\nhis mellow song even under the gloomy sky of December. Allied to this\r\nfamiliar bird is the Gold-crowned Knight,[22] or _Sylvia regulus_,\r\nwhich is found in the Alpine deserts at an elevation of 9000 to\r\n10,000 feet. Like our own Jenny Wren, he has a very fine, slender\r\nbill, which denotes his insectivorous propensities. He is easily\r\nknown by the little crest of silky feathers which he wears on his\r\nhead, like a diadem, and also by his peculiar cry of _souci-î-î-î_.\r\n\r\nOur crowned knight is very partial to the society of the tits, and,\r\nlike them, he is easily caught with birdlime. He is so fond of\r\nthe company of other birds, that, when he finds himself alone, he\r\nbecomes disquieted; his prolonged tiny chirp grows plaintive; and\r\nhe flies to and fro in quest of comrades. He may be regarded as a\r\ntrustworthy barometer, for, prior to rainy weather, his song is\r\nvery loud and incessant. Devoted to the pursuit of insects or their\r\nlarvæ, he seems to pay no attention to the passer-by; he flutters\r\nvivaciously from branch to branch, and puts himself in all imaginable\r\npositions, sometimes with his head upwards, sometimes with his head\r\ndownwards. We have often watched, with extreme gratification, the\r\nacrobatic tricks of our Lilliputian gymnast. Occasionally, before\r\nhe perches, you will see him, in a frenzy of indecision, rapidly\r\nagitating his wings, and revolving them like a wheel. If you look\r\nat him, while thus engaged, _against_ the light, you will think you\r\nsee a tiny, ethereal, diaphanous spinning-top. After \"assisting\" at\r\nsuch a spectacle, which the first wood will furnish, you will not be\r\nindisposed to admit with us, that the bird designated by the Greeks\r\nτροχιλος, or \"little wheel,\" and whose identity has so often been\r\ndiscussed, was, in reality, our golden-crested knight. Moreover,\r\nhe is a true cosmopolite, in every acceptation of the word. Not\r\nonly does he never quit us, not only does he remain faithful to us\r\nthroughout the year, but we meet with him over all Europe. He is\r\nalso found in Asia, and even, it is said, in America, from the West\r\nIndies to Canada. His flight being very short, it is supposed that he\r\npassed from one hemisphere to another by way of Behring's Strait. It\r\nis certain, at all events, that he discovered the New World before\r\nChristopher Columbus.\r\n\r\nDuring the severe cold of the winter of 1867-8, we saw our knight--a\r\nvery rare circumstance--haunt the vicinity of our houses, though he\r\nprefers the green shade of the forests, and especially of the forests\r\nof pine and fir. He who has seen him pecking at the bark and leaves\r\nof these trees, while the ground was covered with snow, and during a\r\nfrost of 10° below zero (C.), will feel no astonishment at meeting\r\nhim upon the snowy summits of the Alps.\r\n\r\nYet this pet bird of ours, this Lilliputian warbler, does not weigh\r\nmore, with all his feathers, than a quarter of an ounce, or the two\r\nthousandth part of an eagle. Away with the hunter who would attempt\r\nsuch tiny game! A bird so small that he glides through the meshes\r\nof a net,--so delicate, that if you would not irreparably injure\r\nyour \"specimen,\" you must shoot him with a few grains of finest\r\nshot,--a bird of such frail appearance, withstanding all climates,\r\nand distributed over the entire surface of the globe,--here is a\r\nsubject worthy the meditation of man, who pretends to be the \"lord of\r\ncreation!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW-BUNTING--(_Emberiza plectrophanes nivalis_).\r\n\r\nThis is the snow-lark-bunting of Macgillivray, and a species of\r\nthe genus _Plectrophanes_. In Scotland, he is frequently called\r\nthe Snow-flake, and, in other parts of Great Britain, the Snow or\r\nOat-fowl. His weight does not exceed an ounce and a half. His bill\r\nand legs are black; his forehead and crown white, with an admixture\r\nof black on the hind part of the head; black are the back and sides,\r\nbut each wing is marked by a broad belt of white; the quill feathers\r\nare black, with white bases; the secondaries are white, with black\r\nspots on the interior webs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--The Crests of Inaccessible Rocks.]\r\n\r\nThe snow-bunting's favourite localities, where he loves to build his\r\nnest, are the crests of inaccessible rocks, surrounded by vast fields\r\nof snow, in whose midst the sun and tempest have created a few oases.\r\nThe most he does is to approach the hospices of Monts St Bernard and\r\nSt Gothard, and construct his nest under the eaves of their roofs.\r\nThis nest, made of long blades of grass, is lined internally with\r\nhair and the feathers of poultry. At the beginning of May, the female\r\nlays six eggs of a snowy whiteness, and the male assists in hatching\r\nthem, and bringing up the young. The bill of the latter is, at first,\r\nof a bright yellow, which turns black, like that of the parents, as\r\nthey grow older.\r\n\r\nThe snow-bunting rarely descends into the wooded region. Of a very\r\nsprightly disposition, he spends nearly all his life in the midst\r\nof the snows and the ice. His song somewhat resembles that of the\r\nfinch, which he also resembles in size and social instincts; for he\r\nmay frequently be seen in numerous bands hovering above the highest\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe snow-bunting is also met with in the northern districts of Asia\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED-BILLED CROW--(_Corvus pyrrhocorax_).\r\n\r\nThe familiar cry of this bird, who resembles the thrush,--the\r\n_krapp-krapp_ of the red-billed crow (_la corneille des\r\nnieges_),--agreeably falls on the ear of the traveller, when\r\nwandering through solitudes devoid of any other living being. By\r\ntheir cries and their presence these birds animate the denuded\r\nrocks which rise like promontories in seas of ice. They are easily\r\ndistinguished from other species by their coral-red bills; whence\r\ntheir name of _Pyrrhocorax_. They nest in troops in the crevices of\r\nthe most inaccessible rocks, and propagate there from generation to\r\ngeneration. Their presence is indicated by enormous heaps of ordure,\r\nveritable guano, which might well be used for manure. Their abrupt\r\nascents and strident cries are signs of bad weather, which the\r\nmountaineer knows how to profit by.\r\n\r\nIf caught when young, these birds are easily domesticated. M.\r\nTschudi, in his \"Life among the Alps,\" relates the history of one who\r\nhad been tamed. He would himself go in quest of the bread, cheese,\r\nand fruits which composed his repast; then, holding in his claws the\r\nprize he had coveted, devour it with avidity. What remained of his\r\nmeal he carefully concealed in paper, and would gallantly defend the\r\nhidden treasure against whomsoever dared to approach it, against\r\ndogs as well as man. Fire had a singular attraction for him; he\r\nwould extract from a lamp the burning wick, and swallow it without\r\nsustaining any injury; he would swallow even the _débris_ of the\r\ncharcoal as he fluttered about the chimney. He showed an excessive\r\njoy at the sight of smoke, and loudly clapped his wings. Whenever\r\nhe caught sight of any burning coal, he did not fail to pick up\r\nimmediately all the paper, rags, or twigs he could lay his claws on;\r\nthese he would place in the stove, and amuse himself by watching the\r\nsmoke they gave forth. If a stranger entered the room, he gave vent\r\nto the most deafening cries, though he was exceedingly gentle and\r\nfamiliar towards persons with whom he was acquainted. His friends and\r\nfavourites he distinguished in a peculiar manner; he ran in front\r\nof them, displayed his joy by expanding his wings, and alternately\r\nperched himself on their hands, their head, their shoulders, eyeing\r\nthem all over, and bending his head as if to kiss them. Every morning\r\nhe entered his master's bedroom, called him by his name, posted\r\nhimself on his pillow, and waited tranquilly until he awoke; then he\r\nexpressed his satisfaction by all kinds of gestures and noises.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPTILES.\r\n\r\nClose to the line of perpetual snow a black variety of vipers has\r\nbeen met with; but none of the serpent race ever _cross_ that line.\r\n\r\nThe only reptile found within the boundaries of the snowy region is\r\na kind of lizard (_Zootoca pyrrhogastra_), the only one, perhaps,\r\nof all the vertebrata which could live at an elevation above the\r\nsea-level of more than 9500 feet, buried in the snow for upwards of\r\nten months.\r\n\r\nDuring the few bright summer weeks, he feeds upon some rare insects\r\nand spiders.\r\n\r\nThe frigid zone is so far the natural habitat of these lizards, that\r\nthey would rather die of hunger than live in the more genial regions\r\nto which men have wished to transplant them. In length they nearly\r\nequal our common lizards, but they are not quite so big; their back\r\nis of a chesnut brown, marked with black streaks and dots; the throat\r\nis bluish; the belly of the male is of a greenish blue, spotted with\r\nblack, while that of the female is of so lively a red as to have\r\nsuggested the name of the species, _Pyrrhogastra_; just as the name\r\nof the genus is derived from the circumstance that the young are\r\nhatched in the mother's belly, and are born alive like the young of\r\na mammal. This statement, too, holds good with respect to the viper,\r\nwhich also endures the cold of elevated regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFERIOR ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nOur information is still very incomplete so far as relates to the\r\nmolluscs, the arachnida, and the insects which inhabit the frigid\r\nzone. The Alpine snail (_Helix Alpicola_), so remarkable for its\r\ntransparency, appears to be the sole mollusc which, in certain\r\nlocalities, attains to an elevation of 7000 feet. It is, however,\r\nsurpassed by the earthworm, which is not only distributed over the\r\nsurface of every country, but ascends to the snowy summits of the\r\nloftiest mountains. Few animals have their geographical distribution\r\nso extended both horizontally and vertically; and only some species\r\nof spiders and millepeds keep company with the earthworm.\r\n\r\nAmong the other inhabitants of the snows have also been observed a\r\ndozen species of butterflies,--nearly all diurnal,--for the phalænæ\r\n(?), or nocturnal Lepidoptera, appear to be much more sensible to\r\nthe cold. M. Agassiz saw the \"Little Vulcan\" (_Vanessa urticæ_)\r\nfluttering in the snowy desert which borders on the glacier of Aar,\r\nas if it were completely in its element. The wings of the majority of\r\nthese butterflies are sombre-coloured; their caterpillars live upon\r\nthe auriculas, and seem to accomplish their metamorphoses in regions\r\nuninhabitable to us. The leaf-wasp (_Tenthredo spinacula_) appears to\r\ndeposit its larvæ, at a height of nearly 10,000 feet, in the galls\r\nof the Alpine rose (_rhododendron ferrugineum_ and _rhododendron\r\nhirsutum_.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe coleoptera have also numerous representatives in the region of\r\nperpetual snows, with this difference--equally characteristic of\r\nother animals--that, upon the southern declivity, they ascend 1000 to\r\n1500 feet higher than on the northern. We may mention, as specially\r\ndistributed in the topmost zone of the Alpine world:--\r\n\r\n      The _Chrysomela salicina_, a pretty little beetle, sometimes\r\n      blue, sometimes deep green, and finely punctuated, which lives\r\n      almost exclusively upon a species of dwarf willow (_Salix\r\n      retusa_).\r\n\r\n      The _Nebria Escheri_, a black beetle, about two thirds of an inch\r\n      long, with feet and antennæ of a brownish red; and\r\n\r\n      The _Nebria Chevrierii_, with rust-coloured feet and antennæ,\r\n      common in the sources of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpecial mention must be made of the _Snow-Flea_. Do not think we\r\nare referring to an insect of the same species as our common fleas:\r\nthe snow-flea approximates much more closely to the lice family\r\nthan to the fleas, though it hops like the latter. The history of\r\nits discovery dates back as far as 1839. At this epoch, M. Desor, a\r\nlearned Swiss naturalist, had undertaken some researches upon the\r\nglaciers. Accompanied by some friends, he set out from the hospice\r\nof the Grimsel, and arrived in the vicinity of the glacier of the\r\nLower Aar. He had commenced his observations, when suddenly he heard\r\nAgassiz calling him, and shouting, \"Come, come, make haste; here are\r\nyour Mont Rosa fleas.\" Desor ran to the spot, and saw under a stone\r\nthe little creatures whom Agassiz persisted in taking to be veritable\r\nlice, pretending they had been accidentally brought to these heights.\r\n\r\n\"I recognised with extreme joy,\" says M. Desor, \"the little creatures\r\nwhose loss I had regretted a year before. They are not pretty, but,\r\non the contrary, very ugly. However, they showed, in opposition to\r\nthe opinion of Agassiz, that they really inhabited the glacier,\r\nand were not merely chance visitors. We found them by thousands\r\nunder other stones. ... Our guide, with whom the glaciers were old\r\nacquaintances, had never seen them before, and the tiny creatures\r\nexcited his astonishment. What surprised us most was the rapidity\r\nwith which they penetrated into even the most compact ice, till they\r\nresembled blood-corpuscles circulating in their vessels. This fact\r\nshows that there exist, in the hardest and most transparent ice,\r\ncertain capillary fissures which escape an unskilled eye: it also\r\nproves that the glaciers, on their surface, and down to a certain\r\ndepth, are by no means incompatible with the development of organised\r\nbeings.\"[23]\r\n\r\nThe tiny insect in question was at first baptized by the name of\r\n_Desoria saltans_ (order of the _Thysanouræ_ of Latreille), but has\r\nsince received definitively the name of _Desoria glacialis_. It\r\nbelongs to the family of the _Poduræ_, singular creatures which, by\r\nvirtue of their form, are a link between the earwigs and the spiders.\r\n\r\nThese are its generic characters:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--_Desoria glacialis_; _a_, natural size; _b_,\r\nenlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe body elongated, cylindrical, garnished with long setiform hairs,\r\nand composed of eight segments, six of which are perfectly distinct,\r\nand two (the two latter) very short, and scarcely perceptible;\r\nfour-jointed antennæ, longer than the head; long, slender,\r\ncylindrical feet; forked tail, silky, and transversely wrinkled;\r\nseven eyes, laterally grouped at the base of each antenna; body\r\nwithout scales.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--_Podura plumbea_; _a_, natural size; _b_,\r\nenlarged.]\r\n\r\nThe _Desoria glacialis_, a species at present unique, is of a velvety\r\nblack, and about one-sixth of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe _Podura plumbea_ (or \"Spring Tail\"), common enough in England,\r\nand found under all kinds of stones, will give the reader an idea of\r\nthe flea of the glaciers.\r\n\r\nOn comparing these two species, we remark, first, that the _Podura\r\nplumbea_ is somewhat longer and thicker in body than the flea of the\r\nglaciers (see Fig. 16; _a_, natural size; _b_, enlarged); but it is\r\nmore particularly by the length of its antennæ that we distinguish\r\nit. It owes its specific name of _Plumbea_ to the livid blue or\r\nleaden colour of the scales which cover its body. These scales\r\nresemble those of butterflies; only they are much smaller, more\r\nfinely situated, and very variable in form and size (Fig. 17). In\r\ncatching it great care is required, for it is so easily crushed; it\r\nis, besides, very soft to the touch, though, when examined with a\r\nmicroscope, it is seen to bristle all over with hairs, apparently\r\nvery hard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nOur _poduræ_ have also the faculty of leaping, and cling by thousands\r\nto humid places, especially to mosses and the under-surface of\r\nstones. The mechanism of their leap is explained by the presence of a\r\nforked, flexible, and elastic appendage, lodged in a kind of ventral\r\ngroove beneath the last segments; by projecting this rapidly behind,\r\nthe whole body of the animal is thrown forward. At the slightest\r\ncontact the insect folds up its caudal appendage under its belly,\r\nand you would then suppose it did not possess one. This circumstance\r\nexplains why, in many books of natural history of good repute, the\r\n_poduræ_, and especially so common a species as the _Podura plumbea_,\r\nare represented without this characteristic instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBACEOUS PLANTS WHICH BEST ENDURE THE COLD OF WINTER.\r\n\r\nThe \"way to look at things,\" which is the true foundation of science,\r\nvaries, not only according to a man's degree of intellectual\r\ncultivation, but according to his social condition or profession.\r\nThe herborist has eyes only for the plants in which he deals,--the\r\n\"simples\" which, as we read in old Gerarde, wrought such wonderful\r\ncures in the days of our forefathers,--and from the most exquisite\r\nflowers he turns with indifference. The gardener, on the other hand,\r\nis wholly absorbed by his love and his hate,--his charming exotics,\r\nand his troublesome weeds. The latter he regards with much the same\r\nfeelings as a society wholly composed of honest men would regard\r\nan infusion of the \"dangerous elements;\" for weeds, like rogues,\r\ntake what is not their own, and deprive others of their means of\r\nsustenance. But to classify plants according to their virtues or\r\nvices is not worthy of science, exclaims the rigid botanist. Would\r\nyou mingle vile self-interest with the pure study of the vegetable\r\nkingdom? Remember that all selfish feelings ought to be banished from\r\nthe sublime sanctuary of analysis and synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis sounds exceedingly well. Disinterested words, from whatever\r\nquarter they come, always produce--perhaps, on account of their\r\ncomparative rarity--an admirable effect. But what is their real\r\nvalue? To ascertain it, the listener must be able to seize, like so\r\nmany luminous threads, all the emotions which are acting upon the\r\nheart and tongue of the speaker. But we are very far from having\r\narrived at this degree of perfection. Shall we ever attain to it?\r\nYes, because we can conceive its possibility. But, until that golden\r\nepoch, the pure love of science will always remain a myth, and we\r\nshall not have universally understood the necessity of seeking in the\r\nprofound study of nature the grand destiny of man.\r\n\r\nIt is among the weeds and noxious plants that we shall find the\r\nspecies capable of enduring longest the cold of winter. What part,\r\nthen, do they fulfil in the economy of creation? An ambitious, but\r\nnot a novel question, which has often been propounded in reference to\r\nour parasitical insects.\r\n\r\nThe best answer which we can make to it is this: Everything invites\r\nus to work. Labour is imposed even upon him who least desires it.\r\nEarth will yield a return only in proportion to the care we bestow\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nIf, after having toiled and sown, we had nothing to do but to gather\r\nin the harvest, every person would become an agriculturist. But a\r\nsoil which is not manured will soon grow exhausted; and if it be\r\nneither ploughed nor harrowed, instead of barley or vegetables,\r\nit will soon be covered with tares; rank weeds will flourish in\r\nevery field. Such is the chastisement reserved for sloth,--the true\r\n\"original sin\" of the human race.\r\n\r\nWell, then, it is among the weeds, everywhere so common, that we meet\r\nwith the plants best able to brave the rigours of frost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG MERCURY.\r\n\r\nThe annual _Dog Mercury_ (_Mercurialis annua_) is one of the most\r\ntenacious. It attracts the passer-by, if he condescend to bestow a\r\nglance upon it, only by its extreme abundance; it propagates very\r\nlargely, though it is by no means partial to all localities. For\r\ninstance, it avoids the woods as persistently as its congener, the\r\ncommon Dog Mercury (_Mercurialis perennis_) seeks them. It prefers\r\nthe vicinity of human habitations and uncultivated fields. If let\r\nalone, it spreads with a dangerous rapidity, and invades every garden\r\nwhich is not kept in the most exquisite order. Still, we must not\r\ndeal too harshly with it. It is not altogether unfriendly to man. In\r\ntruth, owing to its laxative properties, it renders him invaluable\r\nservices. The country people have great faith in fomentations of\r\nDog Mercury and honey. Understand, we pray you, that not an atom of\r\nmercury enters into it, despite its significant name; but a decoction\r\nof the annual Dog Mercury, mixed with a little thick honey, answers\r\nall the purposes of those lenitive clysters which are so beneficial\r\nto excitable temperaments. The leaves of the plant are eaten in\r\nGermany like spinach.\r\n\r\nOf the _Mercurialis perennis_ Mr Sowerby writes:--\"This plant was\r\nformerly used in medicine, but has long been abandoned as a remedy.\r\nIt is extremely acrid, and even poisonous, though recommended in some\r\nold books as a good pot-herb, probably from being confounded with the\r\nannual species. When steeped in water, the leaves give out a fine\r\nblue colour resembling indigo. This colouring matter is turned red by\r\nacids, and destroyed by alkalis, but is otherwise permanent; it might\r\npossibly prove valuable as a dye, if any means could be discovered\r\nof fixing it, and the herb has been introduced into this work with\r\nthe view of drawing the attention of chemists to the subject; no\r\nexperiments seem to have been lately made upon it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nLet us now advise you how to distinguish our medicinal plant from\r\nthe \"ill weeds\" with which it loves to associate. Its ovate, rough,\r\nirregularly-dentated, and petiolated leaves would not give it a\r\nsufficiently marked character, had it no other features peculiar to\r\nitself. But observe the yellowish-green _glomerules_, arranged, like\r\nmillet, on a long frail spike. (Fig. 18, _a_.) They exhale, as your\r\nnose will inform you, a peculiar aroma, like that of spiced bread: no\r\nother plant but our Dog Mercury is gifted with this odour. Now, bring\r\nyour magnifying-glass to bear upon it; with the point of a knife or\r\na feather open one of the grains which form the _glomerules_ of the\r\nspike; out of it will leap, as if impelled by an invisible spring,\r\na large number of stamens, easily distinguished by their elastic\r\nthread-like anthers, covered with tiny yellow beads. Each greenish\r\ngrain is a _flower_; the calyx, which also serves as the corolla, is\r\nrepresented by three little petals, forming the external envelope of\r\nthe little flower. (Fig. 18, _b_.) But something essential is still\r\nwanting; in the centre of the stamens you do not find any pistil. Why\r\nis so important an organ wanting? Because our little rounded flowers,\r\nwith their spice-bread odour, have but one sex, are _unisexual_; they\r\nare male flowers, since they are furnished only with stamens. In\r\nvain do you hunt on the same stem for their companions, the female\r\nflowers. You will find them only upon _other_ stems, distinct from\r\nthose which bear the male flowers. The Dog Mercury, then, is a plant\r\nwhose two sexes are lodged in two different houses, οἴκοι--is, in\r\nfact, a _dioecious_ species.\r\n\r\nBut you are sure to find the female flowers in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the stems with the male flowers. They are easily\r\nrecognised by their larger and darker leaves (Fig. 18, _c_);\r\nand especially by their little twin pods, green, wrinkled, and\r\npedicellate,[24] which garnish the axil of the leaves. (Fig. 18,\r\n_d_.) From this characteristic the female mercury was formerly\r\nmistaken for the _male_; and many centuries elapsed before\r\nnaturalists recognised, what now-a-days seems so simple, that the\r\nlittle pods, joined in couples, and containing each a grain, composed\r\nthe _fruit_ of a single plant; that every fruit proceeds from an\r\novary; and that every ovary is a sign of the feminine sex.\r\n\r\nIn the _Historia Naturalis_ of Pliny, who was at once so acute and so\r\ncredulous an observer, we first meet with the name of _Mercurialis_.\r\n\r\n\"The plant is so denominated,\" he says,[25] \"because it was\r\ndiscovered by Mercury. Its juice, mingled with that of the _hibiscus_\r\n(a species of the _Malvaceæ_) and the purslain, forms a kind of\r\nunguent, with which, if you thoroughly rub the hands, they can touch\r\nmolten lead without being injured.\"\r\n\r\nThe description which Dioscorides[26] gives of the _Linozosis_, which\r\nhe also calls _Parthenion_, or _Mercury's Plant_ (Ἑρμου\r\nβοτάνιον), applies, in the main, to our Dog Mercury. It is true\r\nthat its leaves \"are not like those of the basilic\"\r\n(φίλλα ὄμοια ὁκίμῳ); but they resemble in all\r\nrespects those of the smooth variety of cultivated mint; and,\r\napparently, the basilic of Dioscorides was one of our mints. The fruit\r\nof the female, he adds,--evidently meaning the male flowers,--are\r\ndisposed in clusters.\r\n\r\nBoth species of the Herb or Dog Mercury belong to the family\r\n_Euphorbiaceæ_.\r\n\r\nOur attention must now be directed to another point. It is a fact,\r\nthat in winters of moderate severity the Mercury continues to infest\r\nour gardens and cultivated fields. It only succumbs to a frost equal\r\nto six to ten degrees below freezing-point; then its congealed stem\r\ntotters, and grows black, and its leaves mingle so completely with\r\nthe soil that it is difficult to discover any vestiges.\r\n\r\nHow singular a contrast! The plants most destructive in our kitchen\r\ngardens are frequently the most useful in medicine. There are no\r\ndrugs more popular than the weeds which we call Herb Mercury, Garden\r\nNightshade, and Dog's-tooth grass. All belong to families whose\r\nproperties are strongly marked. As already stated, the Mercury\r\nranks among the _Euphorbiaceæ_, remarkable for their acrid and\r\nmore or less purgative juice. In this family occur the most violent\r\ndrastics, such as the _Croton tiglium_, whose oil (expressed from the\r\nseeds) has long been considered an efficacious medicine. The Garden\r\nNightshade is one of the _Solanaceæ_, and cousin-german of the useful\r\npotato; and the Dog's-tooth grass, whose roots compose three-fourths\r\nof our possets, is of the same family as our cereals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GARDEN NIGHTSHADE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nIf you have seen--and who has not?--the flowers of the potato-plant,\r\nyou will immediately recognise the flowers of the Garden or Black\r\nNightshade. (Fig. 19.) This noxious herb--noxious in some, but\r\nuseful in other respects, and, therefore, not to be visited with too\r\nhasty a condemnation--flowers and fructifies throughout the year.\r\nIts fertility is extreme; only the severest winter-frosts can crush\r\nout its prolific life. The fruits which succeed to the flowers are\r\nsmaller berries or \"apples\" than those of the potato. (See Fig. 20.)\r\n\r\nIn the history of botany, and even in that of philosophy, the Black\r\nNightshade (_Solanum nigrum_) has a certain interest. Thus, says\r\nM. Hoefer, both Cordus and Jean Bauhin, botanists of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, have described the flower of this plant as if its corolla\r\nwere composed of five distinct petals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nWhere were the eyes of those great botanists? The corolla of the\r\nnightshade, like that of all the _Solanaceæ_, is plainly and\r\nobviously monopetalous,--that is, composed of a single piece; to\r\nassure yourself of this, you have but to open it out. (See Fig.\r\n21, _b_.) It was the sharp-pointed, ovate divisions of the limb\r\nwhich imposed on the old observers; a fresh proof that _seeing_ and\r\n_observing_ are two very distinct things. Our vision enters into full\r\nexercise from earliest infancy; observation is not acquired until\r\nafter much labour and many years.\r\n\r\nDo not forget to add, that the five stamens are brought very closely\r\ntogether by their elongated anthers, as is also seen in the flower of\r\nthe potato-plant. (Fig. 21, _a_.)\r\n\r\nThe same botanists who took our solanum for a plant with a\r\npolypetalous corolla, considered the Bitter-sweet (_Solanum\r\ndulcamara_) to be a metamorphosis of the Garden Nightshade! The\r\nformer they christened the red-berried solanum (_Solanum baccis\r\nrubris_), and the latter, the black-berried solanum (_Solanum baccis\r\nnigris_).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if we once launch into the hypothetical, we shall be unable to\r\nstop half-way. If the species of one and the same genus are the\r\nresult of a transformation, why may we not assert as much of the\r\ngenera of a family, or the families of an order?\r\n\r\nThus we should arrive, step by step, at an unique type, not\r\nonly for the vegetable kingdom, but for vegetables and animals,\r\nincluding man himself, and realise, to some extent, the ideal of the\r\nGreeks,--_unity in variety_.\r\n\r\nBe it acknowledged, however, that _we_ have no desire to rise to\r\nso lofty an elevation. The potato-plant--unknown to the ancients,\r\ninasmuch as it is a native of the New World--has not been found to\r\nlose its character since its introduction into the ancient continent;\r\nits congener, the nightshade--an old native, like every bad\r\nherb--accompanies it everywhere; but its fibrous roots are absolutely\r\nvirgin of every farinaceous tubercule.\r\n\r\nThough the nightshade is common everywhere, Tournefort was the first\r\nto describe it with complete accuracy. That great observer even\r\nspecifies various peculiarities which most of our botanists omit from\r\ntheir descriptions. Thus, he rightly remarks, that the peduncles\r\nbranch out so as to form a kind of umbel, and do not emerge, as\r\nis usually the case, from the axils of the leaves, but a little\r\nbelow, from the very branches of the stem. He was also the first\r\nto note--and it was a veritable discovery--that the white flowers\r\nof the nightshade, grouped in threes to eights, are each formed\r\nof a single cup-shaped leaf,--in other words, that the corolla is\r\nmonophyllous, and slightly bell-like or campanulated. Nor does he\r\nforget to describe the disposition of the five stamens, set close\r\naround the pistil, which, as it develops, forms a globular bacciform\r\nfruit, embraced by a five-lobed calyx. This fruit, which changes in\r\ncolour from green to black, is filled with a great number of grains\r\nin a thick liquid, exhaling a nauseous odour. As for the leaves, they\r\nresemble those of spinach, for which, in some countries, they serve\r\nas a substitute.\r\n\r\nLike all plants found by the wayside, and among heaps of refuse,\r\nthe nightshade loves to vary its form, and of its various forms\r\nsome nomenclators have made as many different species. The typical\r\nvariety, the _Solanum nigrum_, has glabrous stems and leaves, that\r\nis, they are covered with short, but hardly visible hairs; its\r\nberries are black.\r\n\r\nThe smooth variety, or _Solanum villosum_, is rather rare, and has\r\nswollen or bulging leaves and stems; its berries are red or of\r\na reddish yellow. The two varieties seem able, by sowing, to be\r\ntransformed into one another. A sub-variety of the _Solanum villosum_\r\nhas been described as a peculiar species, under the name of _Solanum\r\nminiatum_, so named on account of its vermilion-coloured berries.\r\nThe _Solanum ochroleucum_ and _Solanum luteovirens_, the first\r\nwith yellowish, and the second with greenish berries, are simply\r\nvarieties, and the same may be said of the dwarf form, known by the\r\nname of _Solanum humile_.\r\n\r\nBut the physician is more interested in the solanum than either the\r\ngardener or botanist. For him it is no useless or noxious weed, but,\r\non the contrary, is an eminently precious herb. And, in fact, if it\r\npossessed only one-half the virtues formerly attributed to it, we\r\nought to bow to the ground every time we encounter it.\r\n\r\nListen to our authorities even if you do not respect them.\r\n\r\nCæsalpin asserts that the decoction or juice of the nightshade is\r\na sovereign remedy for complaints of the stomach and the bladder,\r\nand regards nightshade-water, mixed with an equal quantity of\r\nabsinthe-water, as one of the best sudorifics.\r\n\r\nTragus, a physician and botanist like Cæsalpin, recommends the juice\r\nof the nightshade as anti-choleraic, as well as efficacious in\r\ninflammation of the liver and stomach. And yet, at the same time, he\r\ngrows emphatic in reference to its poisonous properties. \"Do not,\"\r\nhe says, \"employ this herb immoderately, lest it should happen to\r\nyou as, in 1541, I saw it happen to an inhabitant of Erbach, near\r\nHohenburg. After having eaten a few nightshade-berries, he was\r\nseized, on the following day, by a furious monomania, which led\r\nhis neighbours to believe him possessed of a devil. After having\r\nuselessly employed every kind of exorcism, they sent for me. I made\r\nmy patient swallow some very strong wine; he fell into a profound\r\nslumber; and, when he awoke, was cured.\"[27]\r\n\r\nWithering affirms that a couple of grains of the dried leaves will\r\nact as a powerful sudorific, and that they have also been found\r\nuseful in some cutaneous disorders.\r\n\r\nHere is another authority, before whom naturalists are accustomed\r\nto give way. We make use of the _Solanum nigrum_, says\r\nTournefort,[28] when it is necessary to subdue inflammation,\r\nor soften and relax the fibres. The pounded herb is applied\r\nto hæmorrhoids. The juice, with a sixth-part of rectified\r\nspirit-of-wine, is advantageous in cases of erysipelas, ringworm,\r\nwildfire, and all diseases of the skin. Nightshade is also employed\r\nin anodyne cataplasms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTournefort did not confine himself to simple botanical descriptions;\r\nhe did, what our modern botanists neglect doing,--he made\r\nexperiments, both physiological and chemical, on the plants employed\r\nin medicine. Thus, he began by tasting the different parts of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\"The root,\" he says, \"is almost insipid; the leaves taste like a\r\nsaltish herb; there is something sharp and vinegary in the fruit;\r\nthe whole plant has a narcotic odour. The _leaves_ do not redden\r\nturnsole,[29] but the ripe _fruit_ reddens it greatly; whence we\r\nmay conjecture that the _sal-ammoniac_ contained in this plant is\r\nmoderated in the leaves by a very considerable portion of fœtid\r\noil and earth, but that the acid portion of the salt is strongly\r\ndeveloped in the ripe fruit; so that we must choose our part of the\r\nplant according to the purposes we wish to employ it for. The fruits,\r\nfor instance, are more refreshing, but more repellant, than the\r\nleaves, which soften while resolving, cleansing, and absorbing.\"\r\n\r\nWe admit that these data leave much to be desired from a chemical\r\npoint of view. We may well ask, for example, how the illustrious\r\nphilosopher ascertained the presence of sal-ammoniac in nightshade?\r\nBut it is not fair to criticise the science of the past, by judging\r\nit through the deceitful prism of the science of to-day. We must\r\nadopt the methods of our predecessors, when discussing natural\r\nproductions from all the view-points of their applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOG'S-TOOTH GRASS.\r\n\r\nIn clearing an uncultivated field we uproot a great number of\r\nherbaceous plants of different families; but those of the _Gramineæ_,\r\nor Grasses, invariably predominate. They are the trailing roots,\r\nor _rhizomes_, of certain species which have been included under\r\nthe general denomination of Dog's-tooth. These tenacious and\r\nvigorous roots,--so wholesome in various maladies, so injurious\r\nto cultivation,--are, whatever certain botanists may say, far\r\nfrom tracing their origin in all cases to the _Triticum repens_\r\n(couch-grass) and _Panicum dactylon_--those terrible enemies of the\r\ncorn-field, which, once established in the soil, are with difficulty\r\nextirpated, and prove very injurious to the \"golden crops.\"\r\nNearly every grass which puts forth _rhizomes_ will furnish the\r\n_Dogs-tooth_. We may cite, for instance, several species of _Festuca_\r\n(as _Festuca rubra_ and _Festuca pinnata_), or fescue grass; at least\r\ntwo kinds of meadow grass (_Poa compressa_ and _Poa pratensis_), a\r\nspecies of wild-oats (_Avena elatior_), to say nothing of the weeds\r\n_Arundo phragmites_ and _Arundo epigeios_. The long _rhizomes_ of\r\nthese vivacious plants possess nearly the same properties, due to\r\ntheir saccharine principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A Corn-field.]\r\n\r\nHow shall we distinguish these plants from one another? Their leaves\r\nhave almost exactly the same configuration; they are linear;[30]\r\nand their flowers are not apparent,--they do not attract the gaze\r\nof the passer-by. Yet they possess all the organs necessary for the\r\nreproduction of their species:--three stamens, each composed of an\r\nanther and a characteristic filament; on this anther, whose two\r\nlobes are arranged like the branches of an X, the pistil softly and\r\ntenderly balances itself on the summit of a frail thread, to which it\r\nis attached by the back. Remark, too, the two styles with feathery\r\nstigmata,[31] like the barbs of feathers. Nothing is wanting to\r\nconstitute a complete flower.\r\n\r\nThere is even a perianth, or calyx, represented by a couple of\r\ntiny membraneous scales, scientifically known as _glumellulæ_;\r\nthen at the base of each spikelet, composed of one or two of these\r\nbright green lilliputian flowers, are two other and larger scales,\r\ncalled _glumellæ_: they represent an _involucre_.[32] It is almost\r\nunnecessary to add, that the free, unilocular ovary, or seed vessel,\r\nforms, as a result of its development, the seed, whose embryo adheres\r\nlaterally to a farinaceous kernel, or _perisperm_. The union of one\r\nor more of these flowers composes a spikelet, and the union of the\r\n_spikelets_ constitutes the spike, which may be disposed on a simple\r\nor ramified axis. Such are, in general, the characters we must keep\r\nbefore us in the difficult study of the Gramineæ.\r\n\r\nLet us now see, more closely, the two plants which, according to the\r\nbotanists, furnish the root of the Dog's-tooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--A River's Sandy Bank.]\r\n\r\nWhen walking along the sandy bank of a river, you must frequently\r\nhave trodden under foot a low, almost crawling herb, remarkable for\r\nits violet-red spikes, which, three to five in number, are arranged\r\nlike the fingers of a hand, on the summit of a short curving stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--(P. 93.)]\r\n\r\nThis glaucous-leaved herb is the _Panicum dactylon_ (_i.e._,\r\nfingered-millet) of Linnæus. The long trailing _rhizomes_, joined\r\nto some less prominent characters, have been sufficient for some\r\nbotanists to create a special genus, _Cynodon_, or _Kynodon_ (a Greek\r\nword, signifying literally \"Dog's-tooth\"), and to change the Linnean\r\ndenomination of our grass into _Cynodon dactylon_. It is seldom met\r\nwith in cultivated land; but in such a locality as we have already\r\ndescribed, and sometimes on open sandy shores, where the summer sea\r\ncomes with a gentle ripple and a subdued music, it may frequently\r\nbe found. Its long, tough runners creep through and over the loose\r\nsoil for many yards, rooting at every joint, and furnished with flat,\r\nrather short leaves, of a glaucous hue. The flowers grow in narrow,\r\nlinear spikes, arranged at the top of a short leafy stem in the form\r\nof an umbel, and give the grass, when in bloom, a very peculiar and\r\ncharacteristic aspect.\r\n\r\nBut if the _Cynodon dactylon_ is rare in cultivated fields, the\r\n_Triticum repens_--commonly called couch-grass, but, in our opinion,\r\nthe true and genuine dog's-tooth--is particularly abundant. (See Fig.\r\n23.) Its long subterranean stems increase with astonishing rapidity,\r\nand if the smallest fragment be left in the soil, it will vegetate,\r\nand speedily extend itself, until it becomes almost impossible to\r\nextirpate it. It is a kind of wild barley, with stiff leaves of a\r\nmoderate length, and of a bluish tint, and a double spike, composed\r\nof clusters of four to six flowers, each crowned by a narrow ridge.\r\nWe must not confound the _Triticum repens_ with the _Elymus caninus_\r\nof Linnæus, which has no trailing underground roots like the former.\r\nIt differs also from the latter in the roughness of _each_ side of\r\nits leaves,--only one side of the leaf of the _Triticum repens_ being\r\nrough,--and in the crests which rise above the flowers.\r\n\r\nWas the dog's-tooth known to the ancients? Undoubtedly, for the\r\ndog's-tooth flourishes in all climates,--is truly cosmopolitan. But\r\nit is difficult to decide whether their _Agrostis_ and their _Gramen_\r\napply to the above-mentioned species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to Diodorus, the primitive Egyptians lived upon herbs.\r\n\"They also eat,\" he says,[33] \"the stems and roots which grow in the\r\nmarshes. Especially did they hunt after the _Agrostis_, a plant\r\nremarkable for its sweet savour and the sufficient nourishment\r\nwhich it offers to the wants of man. It is likewise considered an\r\nexcellent provision for cattle, from its fattening properties. It is\r\nin remembrance of these benefits that the inhabitants of Egypt, when\r\nworshipping their gods, carry this plant in their hand.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Agrostis_ of Diodorus would apply to all the _Graminaceæ_ whose\r\nstems and roots contain nutritive and saccharine principles. Let us\r\nhere remind the reader that the sugar-cane belongs to the same family\r\nas barley and the dog's-tooth.\r\n\r\nPliny is much more explicit. What he says of the _Gramen_ (or\r\ngrass), the \"commonest of herbs\"--_inter herbas vulgatissimum_--and\r\nof the geniculated spaces between its knots (_geniculatis serpit\r\ninternodiis_), applies with tolerable accuracy to our _Triticum\r\nrepens_. He also speaks of the diuretic properties of a decoction\r\nfrom its trailing roots.[34] As for his _Gramen aculeatum_ (or\r\nneedle-like grass), it is positively our _Cynodon dactylon_. \"The\r\nfive spurs or needles which shoot out,\" he says, \"from the top of the\r\nstem, have procured it the name of _Dactylon_.\" To these digitiform\r\nspikes he attributes the property of checking the bleeding of the\r\nnose, when they are introduced into the nostrils. But a thorn is much\r\nbetter fitted to produce this effect; the spikes of the digitated\r\npanicle of the _Cynodon dactylon_ are much too soft to determine\r\nepistaxis by a mechanical action. So it is not improbable that they\r\nowe their putative virtue to their colouring, which is not unlike\r\nthat of blood, and which has even procured for the species the\r\nname of _Digitaria sanguinalis_. In the same manner the capricious\r\nmediæval imagination pronounced liverwort, with its marbled leaves,\r\na sovereign remedy for diseases of the lungs,--organs remarkable for\r\ntheir marbled appearance.\r\n\r\nDioscorides is quite as explicit as Pliny. What the latter names\r\n_Gramen_, he, however, calls _Agrostis_. After having particularised\r\nthe nodosities of the stem--a feature common to nearly all the\r\nGraminaceæ--he describes very clearly the long creeping roots put forth\r\nby the said stem; and he does not forget to mention the sugary savour,\r\nso characteristic of the rhizomes (ῥίζας γλυκείας) of the\r\n_Triticum repens_.[35] Theophrastus confines himself to indicating the\r\n_Agrostis_ as a herb which infests the fields.[36]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Cynodon dactylon_ is, at the present day, very common in Greece,\r\nwhere it is specially partial to low grounds, which are somewhat damp\r\nand sandy. The inhabitants call it _Agriada_, a name derived from\r\nἄγριος, \"wild.\" But if we may believe Fraas, the author of a _Flora\r\nClassica_, the genuine dog's-tooth, _Triticum repens_, is, on the\r\ncontrary, very rare in the land of Socrates. This is a curious fact,\r\nif a fact, for geographical botany.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages, and down to the eighteenth century,\r\nwere confounded, under the generic name of _Gramina_, or grasses,\r\nthe most diversely-featured herbs, including the dog's-tooth.\r\nTabernæmontanus, Dodonné, Mathiole, Jean and Gaspard Bauhin, were\r\nthe first to attempt the clearing of a path through this intricate\r\nwilderness. They eulogised, at the same time, the emollient\r\nproperties of the dog's-tooth.\r\n\r\nTournefort[37] and Bernard de Jussieu, who appear to have made a\r\nchemical analysis of it, pretend that the roots of the dog's-tooth\r\ncontain a large quantity of oil, earth, and several acid liquids,\r\nas well as a little fixed salt. \"According to all appearance,\" they\r\nadd, \"the roots act by means of a salt analogous to salt of coral,\r\nenveloped in a great deal of sulphur.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of mocking us with such fantastic analyses, which can only\r\nexcite the laughter of our modern chemists, Tournefort and Bernard\r\nde Jussieu would have deserved better of science if they had applied\r\nthemselves to the task of introducing light and order into the cloudy\r\nchaos of the _Graminaceæ_ of the botanists of their age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut winter is passing away, and the time for the singing of birds is\r\nat hand. Already the earth is awakening from her prolonged lethargy;\r\nthe hedgerows are green with budding leaves; the purple crocuses\r\nshine in many a sheltered field; on bank and brae, in glen and vale,\r\nthe glory of the primrose makes glad the heart of man; the wood\r\nanemone hangs its delicate head in the woodlands; and it seems as if\r\na gladder feeling animated the universal nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--On bank and brae, in glen and vale.]\r\n\r\nAnd the heart and the brain and the soul sympathise in this apparent\r\ndelight of material things; the heart beating more freely, the brain\r\nfeeling a stronger working power, and the soul rising to purer views\r\nof life and its duties:--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, who can speak the joys of spring's young morn,\r\n      When wood and pasture open on his view,\r\n    When tender green buds blush upon the thorn,\r\n      And the first primrose dips its leaves in dew!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Chaplin Child, \"Beredici,\" p. 171.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Pliny, \"Historia Naturalis,\" Book xi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: De Saussure, \"Voyage dans les Alpes,\" Book iii., p. 45\r\n(ed. 1803, Neufchâtel).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Annales de Chimie et de Physique, vol. xxvii., p. 134.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Philosophical Transactions, 1820, vol. ii., p. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: It is but fair to add, however, that Vogt and others\r\ncontend for the animal origin of this substance, and regard the\r\n_Protococcus nivalis_ as simply a development of the infusoria,\r\n_Disceræa nivalis_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Macmillan, \"Footnotes from the Page of Nature,\" pp.\r\n141-143.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The two temperate zones together represent perceptibly\r\nthe half, or 0.520, and the torrid zone, two-fifths, or, more\r\nexactly, 0.398, of the terrestrial surface.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: That is, muttering, marmot-wise, one's prayers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Byron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Also called the Golden-crested Wren.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: C.

He has, for\r\ninstance, some observations in his \"Considerations on the Usefulness\r\nof Experimental Philosophy,\" which are germane to the general purport\r\nand tone of our little book. He remarks, that the contemplation of\r\nthe vastness, beauty, and regular motions of the heavenly bodies,\r\nthe excellent structure of animals and plants, besides a multitude\r\nof other phenomena of nature, and the subserviency of most of these\r\nto man, ought, certainly, to induce him, as a rational creature, to\r\nconclude that this vast, beautiful, orderly, and, in a word, many\r\nways admirable, system of things, that we call the world, was framed\r\nby an Author supremely powerful, wise, and good.\r\n\r\nThe works of God, he adds, are so worthy of their Author, that,\r\nbesides the impresses of His wisdom and goodness that are left, as\r\nit were, upon their surfaces, there are a great many more curious\r\nand excellent tokens and effects of Divine artifice in the hidden\r\nand innermost recesses of them; and these are not to be discovered\r\nby the perfunctory looks of oscitant and unskilful beholders; but\r\nrequire, as well as deserve, the most attentive and prying inspection\r\nof inquisitive and well-instructed considerers. It is not by a slight\r\nsurvey, but by a diligent and skilful scrutiny of the works of God,\r\nthat a man must be, by a rational and affective conviction, engaged\r\nto acknowledge, with the prophet, that the Author of nature is\r\n\"wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.\"\r\n\r\nThat He is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working must be the\r\nconclusion of every devout student of the celestial phenomena; and\r\nto those we shall, therefore, devote the first portion of our Spring\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat reception would formerly have been given to any poet who had\r\ndared to exclaim--\r\n\r\n    \"The bright face of the heavens contemplate,\r\n    And then, as in a mirror, you shall see,\r\n    Outlined, the figure of the rounded earth\"?\r\n\r\nWould he not have been met with the reproach which Horace, in his\r\n_Ars Poetica_, so epigrammatically formulates?--\r\n\r\n                \"Pictoribus atque poetis\r\n    Quidlibet audendi semper fuit æqua potestas.\"\r\n\r\n    An equal licence ever was accorded\r\n    To poet as to painter, that he might\r\n    The boldest sweeps of fancy still essay!\r\n\r\nAs for men of science, they would not have condescended to honour\r\neven with a smile such strange and fantastic words.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, now, that our poetical astronomer, thus contemned,\r\nhad addressed his scientific censors in some such language as the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nDo not think, illustrious sirs, that it is by a purely poetical\r\nlicence I call the firmament a mirror in which the earth may be seen\r\nreflected. Only, to prevent all equivoque, we must understand one\r\nanother. The mirror to which I am alluding does not reflect _light_,\r\nbut _movement_. It is in a particular movement of the stars that the\r\ntrue figure of our planet is reflected, is revealed to us. But before\r\nthe human mind can appreciate this movement,--especially before it\r\ncan discover the cause,--we must be prepared to devote ourselves to\r\ncenturies of assiduous effort. In this long interval, philosophers of\r\nevery class will allow unrestricted scope to their imagination.\r\n\r\nShall we, then, recall some of these opinions,--some of these truly\r\npoetical licences?\r\n\r\nHomer and Hesiod represented the earth as a disc, or as a flat\r\nrondel, surrounded on all sides by a winding river which they called\r\nthe Ocean, and which, in the extreme East, communicated with the\r\nPhasis, in Colchis. Above this terrestrial disc the outspread sky was\r\narched like a vast dome; a dome supported by two massive pillars,\r\nresting on the shoulders of the god Atlas.\r\n\r\nSurely the ancient poets must have evolved the earth-disc from their\r\nown prolific imagination. Can they never have seen a far-off vessel,\r\nshowing, as it approached them, at first the tops of its masts, then\r\nits swelling sails, and finally its hull? They might have made so\r\nsimple an observation in any seaport; if they did, why did it not\r\nsuggest to them the idea that the earth, instead of being level, must\r\nbe round? Because it is easier to let the imagination speak than the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nThe fiction of the earth-disc remained long unshaken, with the\r\nexception of a few modifications. Thales figured to himself the earth\r\nas floating on a humid element. And, six centuries later, we find\r\nSeneca still adopting the opinion of the Greek philosopher. \"This\r\nhumid element (_humor_),\" he says, \"which sustains the disc of the\r\nearth like a ship, may be, perhaps, the ocean, or a liquid of simpler\r\nnature than water.\"[38]\r\n\r\nBut how, then, was the rising or setting of the stars explained?\r\nThe ancients supposed that they were extinguished at sunset, and\r\nrekindled at sunrise. Thus, an unfounded hypothesis has for its\r\nconsequence a still more baseless hypothesis; and in this manner we\r\nglide down the slope of fiction to fall eventually into an abyss of\r\ncontradictions. Such is the true punishment of error.\r\n\r\nLet us continue.--According to the Chaldeans, who were thought to\r\nbe profoundly versed in astronomy, the earth was hollow, and shaped\r\nlike an egg-shell. And,--adds Diodorus, from whom we have this\r\ndetail,--they adduce numerous and plausible proofs of this assertion.\r\n\r\nYet was this idea in direct opposition to the evidence of our senses\r\nwhen we travel over a wide plain, or navigate the great deep; at\r\nleast, unless we admit that the earth has the form of a reversed\r\negg-shell, with its convex face uppermost, and its concave one\r\nbeneath. Heraclitus of Ephesus introduced the Chaldean doctrine into\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nAnaximander represents the earth as a cylinder, whose upper face\r\nalone is inhabited. This cylinder, adds the philosopher, is a\r\nthird of its diameter in height, and floats freely in the midst\r\nof the celestial vault, because there is no reason why it should\r\nmove more to one side than the other. Leucippus, Democritus,\r\nHeraclitus, and Anaxagoras,--names of high repute in the history of\r\nphilosophy,--adopted Anaximander's system, though it was neither more\r\nnor less than a wild phantasy.\r\n\r\nAnaximenes and Zenophanes, without pronouncing dogmatically on\r\nthe form of the earth, represented it as resting,--the one upon\r\ncompressed air, the other upon roots which were prolonged _ad\r\ninfinitum_. But upon what was the compressed air supported? And of\r\nwhat nature were these mysterious roots?\r\n\r\nPlato, with a nearer approximation to the probable, gave to the earth\r\nthe form of a cube. The cube, bounded by six square equal surfaces,\r\nappeared to him the most perfect geometrical solid, and consequently\r\nthe most suitable for the earth, supposed to be the centre of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nEudoxes, who, in his long travels in Greece and Egypt, must have seen\r\nnew constellations rising in the south, while others disappeared\r\nin the north, never ventured to adduce from his astronomical\r\nobservations the sphericity of the earth.\r\n\r\nAristotle, bolder than Eudoxes, was led to the conception of this\r\nsphericity by simple consideration of mechanics. The earth, he\r\nsaid, must be a sphere, because each particle of matter is carried,\r\nby gravity, towards the centre; and as this fact is general, the\r\nsuperficial particles must be at an equal distance from the centre.\r\nThis theoretical view was adopted by Archimedes, who applied it to\r\nthe waters covering the terrestrial surface. Aristotle went further;\r\nhe saw the rotundity of the earth in the shadow thrown by the latter\r\non the bright face of the moon during its eclipses.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the arguments of Aristotle, founded\r\non a method to which all the progress of science is due, remained\r\nunaccepted for two thousand years. And why?\r\n\r\nWe shall attempt to explain.\r\n\r\nAmong those subjects whose comprehension seems to have been specially\r\ndifficult to the mind of man, we must include the fact that the\r\nearth floats without any solid support in the infinity of space, and\r\ncarries its denizens on its surface, both above and below.\r\n\r\nOur creeds, which have ever pretended to explain everything in the\r\nphysical as well as in the moral order, have here endeavoured to\r\ncome to the assistance of the weakness of the human mind. And as each\r\ncreed asserts itself to be the best, to the exclusion of every other,\r\nmen began to imagine for the earth a navel, and placed it where it\r\nwas supposed pleasing to the divinity.\r\n\r\nThe Greek priests dismissed a couple of eagles, one towards the west,\r\nthe other towards the east; the place where these favourite birds\r\nof Jove, of the \"Father of gods and men,\" encountered each other,\r\nwas to be considered the \"navel\" of the earth. It chanced to be\r\nDelphos, whose oracle was the most esteemed in the ancient world; the\r\nsacerdotal caste accumulated there immense wealth. The Greek priests\r\nprudently refrained from dealing with the difficult problem of the\r\nearth's solid support.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew pontiffs, however, were not so reserved. After having made\r\nJerusalem the \"navel of the world,\" they allowed for the earth itself\r\nseven solid columns as a foundation. The question of the Antipodes,\r\nin which the greatest intellects of antiquity believed,--Pythagoras,\r\nPlato, and Aristotle,--was thus pontifically judged and condemned.\r\nAnd Christians who preferred to follow the Judaical observance of\r\nexternal ceremonies to a true comprehension of the spirit of the\r\nGospels, exaggerated the application of this sentence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dogmatic condemnation of the existence of the Antipodes long\r\narrested man in his search for that fourth quarter of the world\r\nwhose inhabitants should have their feet directed towards ours. It\r\nwas one of the principal obstacles which Columbus was called upon\r\nto surmount in the realisation of his sublime idea. When cited\r\nbefore the Council of Salamanca,--composed of prelates and men\r\nof science,--he had to meet the revived objection of Lactantius,\r\na Christian apologist of the third century:[39]--\"Can there be\r\nanything more absurd than a belief in the existence of Antipodes,\r\nof inhabitants with their feet opposite to our feet, of people who\r\nwalk with their feet in the air, and their heads on the ground?--that\r\nthere is a part of the world where everything is inverted, where\r\ntrees throw out their branches from top to bottom, while it rains,\r\nand hails, and snows, from bottom to top?\"\r\n\r\nColumbus admirably demonstrated, from an artificial globe, that\r\nflies walked as easily on the lower as on the upper surface, and\r\nhence pointed out that men, compared with the size of the earth,\r\nare much smaller still than flies. But his judges persisted in\r\ntheir conviction, and did not fail to cast in his face the jesting\r\nwords of Plutarch: \"Philosophers, rather than renounce a favourite\r\nhypothesis, would make human beings crawl on the lower face of the\r\nearth like worms or lizards.\" But it was principally the authority of\r\nSt Augustine which they invoked to condemn a belief in the Antipodes.\r\nSt Augustine had declared such a belief incompatible with the dogmas\r\nof the faith; for to admit the existence of inhabitable lands, in the\r\nopposite hemisphere, would be to admit the existence of peoples not\r\ndescended from Adam, since it would have been impossible for him to\r\ntraverse the ocean lying between Asia and the Antipodes!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome authorities denied the Antipodes on the ground taken by certain\r\nclassic writers, that the regions of the opposite hemisphere were\r\nuninhabitable under the tropics, on account of the extreme heat,\r\nand near the Poles, on account of the extreme cold. Others cited\r\nEpicurus, affirming that the earth was inhabitable and roofed with\r\na celestial vault only in our western hemisphere, the other half\r\nbeing an inaccessible chaos. Others pretended that no traveller\r\ncould reach the east by way of the west, because the earth, being\r\npear-shaped, he would encounter on his road an insurmountable\r\ntuberosity,--undoubtedly the tail or stalk of the pear! Finally,\r\nthere were some who dwelt upon the magnitude of the earth, whose\r\ncircuit would occupy a voyage of upwards of three years.\r\n\r\nIt was to this objection, as the most serious, that Columbus\r\nprincipally addressed his reply. And he replied by discovering the\r\nNew World. But had not this daring genius been supported in his\r\nprojects by the Spanish sovereigns, Ferdinand and Isabella, he would\r\nhave been handed over to the Inquisition, and condemned as a heretic.\r\nIt was then so dangerous to believe in the Antipodes, that a Bishop\r\nof Salzburg was deposed from his episcopal throne, and deprived\r\nof his ecclesiastical dignity, by the Pope Zacharias, for having\r\ncountenanced the heresy.\r\n\r\nWe now know why, for a whole series of centuries, men would not\r\nfollow in the footsteps of Aristotle, who was the first to establish\r\ntheoretically the sphericity of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the New World, and the voyages of circumnavigation\r\nwhich rapidly succeeded one another, demonstrated, not only that\r\ninhabitants there are whose feet are opposite to ours, but that the\r\nearth does not rest upon any species of support; that it floats, like\r\na star, freely in space.\r\n\r\nThe ice was broken. The question of the earth's figure was revived,\r\nand, this time, discussed in a new light.\r\n\r\n_Is the earth perfectly round?_\r\n\r\nCopernicus never doubted it; he who was the first, after Pythagoras,\r\nto represent our planet as revolving round the sun. The geometrical\r\nsphericity of the earth wonderfully harmonised with the perfect\r\ncircles in which he supposed the planets to move. Kepler, who had\r\nfirst laid a sacrilegious hand on the holy figure of the circle,\r\nand on the circular orbits of the stars, never ventured, however,\r\nto dispute the perfect rotundity of the earth; it appeared to him\r\na matter beyond all controversy. Galileo was the first to hazard a\r\ndoubt. But this doubt became a certainty only through the labours of\r\nHuygens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGalileo, who died in the very year that Newton was born (1642),\r\nhad discovered, as we know, that all bodies, in falling, obey an\r\nuniformly accelerative force, called _gravitation_, and that the\r\nspace traversed increases as the square of the time occupied in\r\ntheir descent. Huygens perceived that gravity varies according to the\r\nparallels of latitude, and it was not long before he demonstrated,\r\nby the number of oscillations which a pendulum of a certain length\r\nperforms in a certain time, that it diminishes in a regular ratio as\r\nwe approach the Equator, where it reaches its _minimum_, and that\r\nit augments, on the contrary, in due proportion as we approach the\r\nPoles, where it must attain its _maximum_. Strong in this knowledge,\r\nand knowing, moreover, that the material molecules, uniformly\r\ndistributed in the volume of a sphere, act upon a point of its\r\nsurface as if they were all reunited in the centre of that sphere,\r\nHuygens deduced from it the inequality of the equatorial and the\r\npolar radius; he attempted even to determine how much the former\r\nexceeded the latter. We know, now-a-days, that this difference is\r\n139,670 feet (41,848,380-41,708,710 feet).\r\n\r\nNewton admits, with Huygens, that the earth bulges out at the Equator\r\nand is flattened at the Poles; that, in a word, it is a spheroid\r\nof revolution. He went much farther: he made the precession of\r\nthe Equinoxes depend upon this flattening; but he did not furnish\r\nits mathematical demonstration. What has been the result? A free\r\nskirmishing ground for all opinions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Sir Isaac Newton.]\r\n\r\nWhile Newton maintained that the form of the earth was that of a\r\nspheroid flattened at the poles, as a necessary sequence of the great\r\nnatural law which bears his name, Jacques Cassini declared himself\r\nin favour of an elongated spheroid. The difference between these\r\ntwo illustrious teachers originated a controversy which lasted for\r\nupwards of fifty years. The Academy of Sciences of Paris pronounced,\r\nnot unnaturally, in favour of the opinion of their colleague, though\r\nit was far from having the authority of Dominique Cassini, father\r\nof Jacques, and, still less, that of the illustrious President of\r\nthe Royal Society of London. But patriotic ardour supplemented the\r\nweakness of their arguments. The flattened spheroid and Newton's law\r\nwere rejected by France, because they were an English invention.\r\nUndoubtedly, no one _openly_ acknowledged so paltry a reason, but\r\nit was certainly true as a sentiment. As everybody knows, it was\r\nVoltaire who first removed the prohibition, and popularised the\r\nNewtonian philosophy in France.\r\n\r\nHow did our astronomers finally succeed in demonstrating\r\nmathematically the veritable form of our planet?\r\n\r\nTo obtain a clear and accurate conception, we are obliged to\r\ntransport ourselves back two thousand years. Let us recall, in the\r\nfirst place, that, owing to the diurnal movement, all the stars\r\nprogress from east to west; that they rise and set, to recommence\r\nthe same rotation. This is a general and conspicuous fact, which\r\neverybody can confirm for himself. But now for another, whose\r\nobservation requires a little more time and patience. During the\r\ndiurnal movement, which carries on all the stars and the sun himself,\r\nthe latter progresses independently, in the inverse direction of\r\nthe celestial vault, as a fly might do upon a revolving globe. But\r\nthis second fact is complicated with a third: While advancing on his\r\nown account, from west to east, the circle which the sun traverses\r\nis not parallel to the Equator; the radiant luminary transports\r\nhimself alternatively into the northern and southern hemispheres,\r\naccomplishing this rotation in 365 days and a fraction of a day, in\r\nan oblique plane, which cuts that of the Equator under an angle of\r\nabout 23-1/2°.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us here take advantage of a parenthesis to explain a few\r\nastronomical technicalities, necessary for the due comprehension of\r\nour subject.\r\n\r\nIt is in the plane, or _oblique circle_,--ὁ κῦκλος λοξός, as\r\nPtolemæus called it,--that eclipses occur, owing to the relative\r\npositions of the sun, earth, and moon; and it is for this reason\r\nmodern astronomers have denominated it the _Ecliptic_. The Ecliptic\r\nis the Equator of the _oblique sphere_ (σφαῖρα\r\nἐγκεκλιμμένη), properly so called, as the Equator is that of\r\nthe sphere of the world, or the _right sphere_ (σφαῖρα ὀρθή).\r\nThe circles parallel to the Ecliptic, which continue to diminish in\r\ndiameter up to the poles of the oblique sphere, bear the name of\r\n_parallels of latitude_; and we give that of _meridians of longitude_\r\nor _oblique ascensions_ (ἀναφοραὶ λοξαί) to the great\r\ncircles which cut the first rectangularly as they all pass through\r\nthe axis and the poles of the Ecliptic. The same division by circles\r\ncutting each other rectangularly has been made on the right sphere,\r\nor sphere of the world. Only, _there_ the latitudes are named\r\n_declinations_, and the longitudes _right ascensions_. The general\r\ndiurnal movement is a movement in right ascension; it is measured upon\r\nthe Equator. The individual annual movement of the sun is a movement in\r\nlongitude; it is measured upon the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe zone, or belt, which the sun seems to trace in its annual march,\r\nfrom the limit of its southern excursion (_the winter solstice_) to\r\nthe limit of its boreal excursion (_the summer solstice_), and in\r\nreturning from that limit to the other, after having twice passed\r\nthrough the equinoctial line (or Equator),--this zone is marked on\r\nthe firmament by a belt of constellations known as the _Zodiac_.\r\n\r\nThese constellations are named, according to the figurative grouping\r\nof the stars (on which we have commented in Book I.),--the Ram, the\r\nBull, the Twins, the Crab, the Lion, the Virgin, the Balance, the\r\nScorpion, the Archer, the Cow, the Water-bearer, the Fishes. There\r\nare twelve, three for each season. The constellations represented by\r\nthese figures, so singularly chosen, spread over the whole celestial\r\nvault,--that is, over an extent of 360°.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo resume.\r\n\r\nThe heavens, like earth, have their annals: everything changes\r\nthere as in the human world. In the age of Hipparchus,--or some two\r\nthousand years ago,--the sun entered, at the spring equinox, into the\r\nzodiacal sign of Aries; in the summer solstice, it entered into that\r\nof Cancer; at the autumnal equinox, into Libra; and at the winter\r\nsolstice, into Capricorn. These signs then corresponded exactly to\r\nthe constellations which they represent.\r\n\r\nNow, whatever Aristotle and his disciples may say, the firmament\r\nis not incorruptible (ἀφθαρτός) and immovable; even the _fixed_\r\nstars, as we call them, change their place in time. We have seen\r\nthat the whole celestial vault or \"right sphere\" runs, from east to\r\nwest, around the poles of the world; we have seen also that the sun\r\nmoves, on his own account, from west to east, around the poles of\r\nthe oblique sphere, or the Ecliptic. Well, this does not suffice;\r\nthere is a third movement to be observed,--that of the right sphere\r\nitself round the poles of the Ecliptic; and this, not like that of\r\nthe sun, from west to east, but inversely, from east to west. Only,\r\nthis movement of the starry sphere in longitude, or parallel to the\r\nplane of the Ecliptic, is extremely slow, compared with the movement\r\nof the same sphere in right ascension, or parallel to the Equator of\r\nthe world. While the former traverses in twenty-four hours the 360°\r\nof the circle, the latter occupies (in round numbers) 25,000 years.\r\n\r\nWho was the first discoverer of the slow movement of the heavens?\r\nHipparchus. This great astronomer, on comparing his own observations\r\nwith the more ancient ones of Aristillus and Timocharis, succeeded\r\nin ascertaining that the constellation which, 150 years before him,\r\ncorresponded to the spring equinox, did not, in _his_ time, any\r\nlonger coincide exactly with the same equinoctial point, but had\r\noutstripped or preceded it about 2°. This is what we mean by the\r\n_precession of the equinoxes_.\r\n\r\nHipparchus was at first of opinion that this movement affected only\r\nthe constellations of the Zodiac; but he soon became assured of its\r\nuniversality. He perceived that if it does not alter the parallels\r\nof latitude; because it has occurred parallel with the Ecliptic, it\r\nmakes the position of the equinox retrograde from east to west, and\r\nthe sun pass slowly through the same constellations in the reverse of\r\nthe order in which he annually traverses them.\r\n\r\nWe know this movement now to nearly the fraction of a second. By an\r\ninappreciable _daily_ quantity, it rises, at the end of the year, to\r\n50\".3,--in a century, to about 1-1/2°,--in twenty centuries, to 30°,\r\nor the twelfth part of the Zodiac. It is for this reason the Ram,\r\nwhich, in the days of Hipparchus, was occupied by the sun in spring,\r\nhas no longer any value as a commemorative sign; it gives place\r\nnow-a-days to the constellation of the Fishes, and corresponds to the\r\nconstellation of Taurus, or the Bull; the constellation of Taurus to\r\nGemini, or the Twins; the constellation of the Twins to Cancer, and\r\nso on. But little more than a month, then (a month of 2000 years!),\r\nof the _great year_ (a year of 25,000 years!) has elapsed since the\r\nepoch of Hipparchus. It is to astronomy especially that, with a\r\nslight variation, we may apply the aphorism of Hippocrates--\"_Brevis\r\nvita, ars longa_\" (Life is short, and art long).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe precession of the equinoxes explains why the pole of our starry\r\nvault does not occupy invariably the same point of the firmament, and\r\nwhy the constellations which we now see shining during the nights of\r\na given season change their places as time glides by.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what is the cause of this movement?\r\n\r\nBefore this question, as before a sovereign tribunal, appear the two\r\nopposite doctrines which have been enunciated on the value of the\r\nearth and the sun in the world's system. According to the doctrine at\r\nonce the oldest and most intolerant, the earth occupies immovably the\r\ncentre of the world; the sun and the planets are only its satellites;\r\nthey, like the moon, revolve around the earth; finally, all the\r\nstarry sphere, the whole celestial vault, rotates upon its own axis\r\nin four-and-twenty hours. We have been speaking as if this were\r\nreally and truly the condition of things. If we admit this doctrine,\r\nwhich bears the name of the Ptolemean system,--though, in truth, it\r\nis probably as old as humanity itself,--how shall we explain the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes? We cannot do otherwise than suppose,\r\nthat while the celestial sphere executes its diurnal movement round\r\nthe poles of the world, it executes another and much slower movement\r\nround the poles of the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nBut this assuredly is a most singular supposition. What! the same\r\nstarry sphere revolves at one and the same time parallel to the plane\r\nof the Equator, and parallel to another plane (the Ecliptic) inclined\r\nupon the first? After having imagined eight spheres of crystal to\r\nexplain the movements of the moon, the sun, the planets (Mercury,\r\nVenus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn), and the stars, do we require a ninth?\r\nWhere will you stop, if you begin to discover additional movements?\r\nYou are condemned to wander from hypothesis to hypothesis, until you\r\nfall into an abyss of contradictions!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is the language employed by the tribunal of posterity, in\r\naddressing itself to the error which would substitute appearance for\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the other theory, it is the _sun_ which occupies the\r\ncentre of the system, and it is the _earth_ which, accompanied by\r\nthe remainder of the planets, revolves around _it_. This theory is\r\nlikewise of considerable antiquity, though generally known as the\r\n_Copernican system_. But four-and-twenty centuries prior to the\r\nepoch of Nicholas Copernicus, it was taught by the \"Samian sage,\"\r\nPythagoras, and his disciples. The system then in acceptance,\r\nhowever, imposed upon them the necessity of silence. Ptolemæus was\r\nacquainted with it, but endeavoured to turn it into ridicule. \"There\r\nare people,\" he says, \"who pretend that heaven is immovable, and\r\nthat it is earth which revolves on its own axis; evidently these\r\nindividuals are unaware how supremely absurd is their opinion (πάνμ\r\nγελοιότατον).\" And it was in the name of logic and mathematics\r\nthat Ptolemæus thus treated the Pythagoreans!\r\n\r\nIn the system of Copernicus,--the diurnal movement of the right\r\nsphere,--it is the earth's rotation upon its own axis which, being\r\nprolonged into the heavens, marks there, by its extremities, what\r\nare called the _Poles of the world_, just as the _Equator of the\r\nworld_ is simply the prolongation of the terrestrial Equator. As for\r\nthe Equator of the oblique sphere (the Ecliptic), in which the sun\r\n_apparently_ moves, it is, in reality, the identical plane in which\r\nthe earth moves during its annual revolution round the sun. Now, in\r\nthis movement of translation, the axis of the earth does not remain\r\nconstantly parallel to itself; it deviates,--very slightly, it is\r\ntrue,--and so as to be scarcely perceptible to several generations\r\nof men. It is then quite natural that our successors should see, for\r\na long time to come, the northern pole of the starry sphere near the\r\nextremity of the tail of Ursa Minor. But, two thousand years hence,\r\nthis slow deviation will have become very perceptible; astronomers\r\nwill then see the pole of the world in another constellation, and, as\r\nthis displacement is continuous, the prolonged axis of the earth will\r\nhave traced on the firmament, in 25,000 to 26,000 years, a circle\r\nparallel to the plane of the Ecliptic, and having for its centre the\r\npole of that plane. This circle is the base of a cone whose summit\r\nrests upon the earth. (Fig. 27, _a_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nBut this imaginary defined circle (which appears elliptic on account\r\nof the perspective) is but the mean of a series of oscillations\r\naround the pole of the world, which changes its position, as we\r\nhave just shown. (Fig. 27, _b_.) These oscillations originate in\r\nthe circumstance that the axis of the earth inclines alternately\r\nforward and backward, in such wise, that a star, after having\r\napproached the Pole, immediately afterwards recedes from it; they\r\ncause the terrestrial globe to resemble the head of a man who, by an\r\nalternation of gesture, says alternately yes and no. Only, while man\r\n(the puppet!) occupies but a second or two in affirming and denying\r\nthe same thing, the earth employs about eighteen years and a half in\r\ninclining once forward to say _yes_ (in Latin, _adnuere_), and once\r\nbackward to say _no_ (in Latin, _abnuere_). This is scientifically\r\ndenominated the _nutation_ of the earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho was the fortunate mortal to discover a phenomenon so singular?\r\nBradley, the English astronomer; the same who discovered the\r\n_aberration of light_. It was in the course of his researches to\r\ndetermine the annual parallax or distance of the stars that, at an\r\ninterval of nineteen years, he made, in 1728, the discovery of the\r\naberration of light, and, in 1747, that of nutation.\r\n\r\nThe reader may not be displeased to know under what circumstances\r\nhe accomplished the latter discovery. While observing, for several\r\nsuccessive years, the circumpolar stars, and notably the star γ in\r\nDraco,--a constellation situated between Ursa Major and Ursa Minor\r\n(see Fig. 2, p. 9),--Bradley noticed that this star changed its\r\nposition by a movement constantly directed towards the north, from\r\n1727 to 1736, or for a period of nine years. When it had reached the\r\nlatter limit, the star appeared stationary for a moment, and then\r\nretraced its course in a southerly direction. Would it also occupy\r\na period of nine years to arrive at the limit of this contrary\r\nexcursion? Bradley affirmed that it would, and communicated his\r\nprediction to a French astronomer, Le Monnier.\r\n\r\nHow was Bradley led to appear in the new character of a seer?\r\n\r\nBy two special circumstances--the universality, and the duration of\r\nthe phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIf the star γ in Draco had been the only one to direct its course\r\ntowards the north, Bradley would probably have been led to believe\r\nthat the Pole exercised upon it a peculiar attraction; but he\r\nperceived that many other stars rose in like manner towards the\r\nPole with an uniform and constant march; it was, therefore, more\r\nnatural to suppose that the Pole advanced towards _them_. And what\r\nstrengthened the probability of this hypothesis was, that the stars\r\nsituated in the neighbourhood of the _course_ of the solstices\r\nexhibited a corresponding displacement. But there was already\r\nrecognised as in existence a peculiar movement which explained the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. Was it necessary, therefore, to suppose\r\na second, a kind of rotatory movement? Newton had already thought of\r\nit, by imagining a nutation, through which the Pole might alternately\r\nrise and sink on the plane of the Ecliptic in the space of a year.\r\nBut the displacement which occurs in that interval is too slight\r\nto be perceptible to observation. There might, therefore, be a\r\nreasonable doubt of the accuracy of Newton's idea.\r\n\r\nBradley resumed the idea of his illustrious compatriot. He recognised\r\nin the northward movement of the stars the effect of a similar\r\nrotation, but one which took much longer in its accomplishment. By\r\ndoubling the interval of nine years, to the term of which he had\r\nseen the movement become stationary, he obtained a period nearly\r\napproaching that which the moon employs in returning to the same\r\nnodes. This coincidence flashed upon him like a ray of light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must here remind the reader,--who, we hope, is not weary of\r\nour scientific or semi-scientific disquisition,--that the lunar\r\nnodes,--_i.e._, the points of the Ecliptic through which the moon\r\npasses when it proceeds from south to north (the ascending node),\r\nand from north to south (the descending node),--are the analogues\r\nof the solar equinoxes; the equatorial points through which the sun\r\npasses on its course from south to north (the spring equinox), and\r\nin returning from north to south (the autumn equinox),--points of\r\nintersection whose retrogradation constitutes, as we have seen, the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes. Well, the moon's nodes retrograde in a\r\nsimilar manner by a movement directed from east to west; only it is\r\na much slower movement. While the equinoxes are displaced but fifty\r\nseconds (50\") in a year, the lunar nodes, during the same period, and\r\nin the same direction, move over a space of 19° 20' 29\"; so that, in\r\nless than nineteen years, they have made the complete circuit of the\r\nheavens, to return to exactly the same point, after traversing 360°.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, then, we have explained the data on which Bradley rested his\r\nprediction. It was confirmed by Le Monnier, who observed, in fact,\r\nthat the star γ in Draco, and the neighbouring stars, observed by\r\nBradley from 1727 to 1736, moving from south to north, occupied\r\nthe same period of time, from 1736 to 1745, in accomplishing an\r\nequal excursion in a contrary direction, from north to south. These\r\nobservations enabled him to fix approximatively the quantity of the\r\nnutation.\r\n\r\nTo sum up; it was recognised that the angle made by the axis of the\r\nterrestrial poles with the axis of the poles of the Ecliptic, far\r\nfrom remaining constantly equal to itself (the amount was 23° 27' 30\"\r\nin the middle of the present century), varies by 0\".48 yearly, and\r\nthat this angle itself experiences a variation whose mean value is\r\n48\" in a century. It sometimes exceeds this mean value, and sometimes\r\nfalls below it, by an amount which rises to nearly 9\".65. Thus, while\r\ndescribing, in an interval of 25,000 to 26,000 years, its curve\r\naround the poles of the Ecliptic, the earth's axis describes, from\r\neast to west, a small ellipsis in the space of about eighteen and\r\ntwo-third years, and imperceptibly changes, moreover, its angle of\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nBut, in fine, what is the true cause of all these movements?\r\n\r\nWere the earth a perfect sphere, were all its radii of equal length,\r\nthe effect of the universal _ponderation_ would make itself felt\r\nas if all the material molecules were concentrated at a single\r\npoint--the centre; and, apart from this ponderation, which exercises\r\nitself in the direct ratio of the masses, and in the inverse ratio\r\nof the square of the distances, nothing exists which would sway\r\nour globe in one direction rather than in another,--no precession\r\nof the equinoxes would take place, the plane of the Ecliptic would\r\ninvariably coincide with the plane of the Equator, and an eternal\r\nspring would smile on the fortunate earth. The dream of the poet\r\nwould be realised, and light would spread\r\n\r\n    \"Through all the seasons of the golden year.\"\r\n\r\nBut, as observation shows, the contrary has taken place, since,\r\nbesides its movements of diurnal rotation and annual revolution,\r\nthe earth has its mobile axis, which is independently inclined and\r\ndisplaced. Thus, the material molecules of the planetary surface are\r\nnot all at an equal distance from the centre; and, consequently, the\r\nearth is not a perfect sphere. It is, as D'Alembert has demonstrated,\r\nthe bulging, equatorial portion which experiences, owing to the solar\r\nattraction, a retrograde movement, carrying onward the rest of the\r\nglobe in a general march, called the precession of the equinoxes.\r\n\r\nBut this general movement, as we have seen, is, in itself, simply the\r\nmean of a series of oscillations, which D'Alembert has also connected\r\nwith gravitation. He has shown that the nutation of the earth's axis\r\nresults from the moon's attraction on the bulging portion of our\r\nglobe. Finally, it has been mathematically demonstrated that the said\r\nbulging portion of the earth produces, under the continuous action\r\nof the sun, the precession of the equinoxes; just as this portion\r\ndetermines, by its continuous action, the nutation of the lunar axis.\r\nAs in this universal ponderation all the wheelwork of the world\r\ncatches (_tous les rouages du monde s'engrènent_), and the planets,\r\nsuch as Mars and Venus, must also have their share in the action,\r\nhowever weak it may be, we have contrived to render an exact account\r\nof the slow changes of the obliquity of the Ecliptic.\r\n\r\nLet us resume. Movement and matter, all is _ponderated_.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as matter is unequally distributed around the earth's\r\ncentre, being flattened at the Poles and bulging at the Equator, it\r\nfollows that the sun's enormous weight makes it vacillate, so that\r\nit describes at its axis a cone around the poles of the plane of its\r\norbit. Its movement we see in the heavens in the precession of the\r\nequinoxes. But the terrestrial axis traces it tremblingly, because\r\nthe moon, owing to its vicinity, exercises a perturbing action on\r\nour planet, which, in its turn, exercises on the moon a still more\r\nenergetic influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Seneca, \"Quæstiones Naturales,\" vi. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Lactantius, \"De Falsa Sapientia,\" iii. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_WHAT MAY BE SEEN UPON THE EARTH._\r\n\r\n    \"There lives and works\r\n    A soul in all things, and that soul is God.\"\r\n\r\n    --COWPER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe have returned, at least in an astronomical sense, to the budding,\r\nhappy, radiant spring; the sun, in its apparent course, crosses the\r\nequinoctial line; the duration of the day, transiently equal to\r\nthat of the night, will augment in proportion as the great luminary\r\ndescribes above our horizon greater and yet greater arcs of a circle.\r\nYet this is not the budding, happy, radiant spring of the poets. No,\r\nif it be spring according to the law of universal gravitation, it is\r\nwinter still by the law of life. The forest trees, such as the oak,\r\nthe ash, the fir, and the beech, continue to present the image of\r\ndeath; and the sap which should reanimate them has not awakened from\r\nits winter sleep.\r\n\r\nA solemn moment is it when the sap--that life-blood of the\r\nplant--arrested by the icy grasp of winter in its circulatory\r\nmovement--receives a new impulse through the vivifying action of\r\nthe central luminary of our system. What a subject for study and\r\nreflection!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Landscape in Winter.]\r\n\r\nIt has been very finely dealt with by Longfellow.\r\n\r\nHow wonderful! he exclaims,--and we only regard the wonder with\r\nindifference, because it is repeated annually,--how wonderful is\r\nthe advent of spring!--the great annual miracle, as he calls it, of\r\nthe blossoming of Aaron's rod, repeated on myriads and myriads of\r\nbranches!--the gentle progression and growth of herbs, flowers,\r\ntrees,--gentle, and yet irrepressible,--which no force can stay, no\r\nviolence restrain,--like the influence of love, which wins its way,\r\nand cannot be withstood by any human power, because itself is divine\r\npower. True enough it is, that if spring came but once in a century,\r\nor burst forth with the terror of an earthquake, and not in silence,\r\nwhat wonder and expectation there would be in all hearts to behold\r\nthe miraculous change! But now the silent succession suggests nothing\r\nbut necessity. To most men, only the _cessation_ of the miracle would\r\nbe miraculous, and the perpetual exercise of God's power seems less\r\nwonderful than its withdrawal would be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMay we venture on another quotation? We take it, gentle reader, from\r\na living poet, whose works are not so widely read as their genuine\r\npoetical feeling and wealth of language deserve--I mean Sydney Dobell.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the return of Spring, and her grief and astonishment\r\nat the spectacle of earth, pale, frozen, seemingly dead, he\r\ncontinues,--\r\n\r\n                            \"She fell upon\r\n    The corse, and warmed it. The natural earth,\r\n    Which was not _dead_ but _slept_, unclosed her eyes;\r\n    Then Spring, o'erawed at her own miracle,\r\n    Fell on her knees.\r\n      Meanwhile the attendant birds,--her haste outstript,--\r\n    Chasing her voice, crowd round, and fill the air\r\n    With jocund loyalty.\r\n                          With flowers Spring dressed the Earth;\r\n    Then did her mother, Earth, rejoice in her;\r\n    And she, with filial love and joy, admired,\r\n    Weeping and trembling, in the wont of maids.\r\n    Meantime her pious fame had filled the skies.\r\n    He that begat her, the almighty Sun,\r\n    Passing in regal state, did call her 'child,'\r\n    And blessed her and her mother where they sat--\r\n    Her by the imposition of bright hands,\r\n    The Earth with kisses. Then the Spring would go,\r\n    Abashed with bliss,--decorous in the face\r\n    Of love parental. But the Earth stood up,\r\n    And held her there; and, these encircling, came\r\n    All kind of happy shapes that wander space,\r\n    Brightening the air. And they two sang like gods\r\n    Under the answering heavens.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--\"The attendant birds crowd round, and fill\r\nthe air.\"]\r\n\r\nWe think that the ancients, if they had seriously reflected upon\r\nthe important part played by the sun in the economy of nature; how\r\nit is the heart, and spring, and inner power of every movement and\r\nmanifestation of life; how it is, as Sir David Brewster says, the\r\ncentre and soul of our world, the lamp that lights it, the fire that\r\nheats it, the magnet that guides and controls it, the fountain of\r\ncolour, which gives its azure to the sky, its verdure to the fields,\r\nits rainbow-hues to the gay world of flowers, and the purple light\r\nof love to the marble cheek of youth and beauty;--we think that the\r\nancients, if they had thought upon, or had known, all this, would not\r\nhave given the earth a chief place in our system. And that they did\r\nso is all the more strange when we remember that they attributed to\r\nthe world a _soul_ (the \"soul of the world\" is a favourite idea with\r\nthe great philosophers of antiquity), and looked upon the planets as\r\nliving creatures.\r\n\r\nBut they were swayed by that egotistical instinct which leads man to\r\nrefer everything to himself, even the very gods which he has created\r\nafter his own image. The Bible teaches us that there is but one God.\r\nAlas! are there not as many gods as there are men? Does not each of\r\nus create a deity in accordance with his own inclinations, his mode\r\nof thought, his degree of mental culture, the sphere of his ideas? Is\r\nthe God of a tolerant philosopher identical with that of a bigoted\r\nfanatic? It is not so much due to a deceitful appearance, an optical\r\nillusion, as to a kind of innate infatuation, that the human race\r\nhave come to consider the planet they inhabit as the centre of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE SAP.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the sap, the life-blood of vegetation.\r\n\r\nHow is it that its movement does not recommence at the same time in\r\nall plants? Why are some clothed with leaves when the others are\r\nscarcely budding? Wherefore, in certain genera, do the flowers appear\r\nbefore the leaves?\r\n\r\nSome authorities assert,--but facts show it to be a purely gratuitous\r\nsupposition,--that the flower, which, with the fruit, seems to be\r\nthe goal or object of vegetation, demands a greater activity on the\r\npart of the sap. But, in truth, many trees and shrubs, such as the\r\npoplar, the willow, and the hazel, flourish at an epoch when the sap\r\nis barely aroused from its protracted lethargy.\r\n\r\nThese are questions which have still to be answered.\r\n\r\nBut upon yet another question we may dwell at some detail. What is\r\nthe cause of the circulation of the sap?\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this important problem has never been\r\npropounded as it should have been. And for this reason: all observers\r\nwho have taken up its consideration have had in view only the _rising\r\nsap_, and the cause of its rising. Evidently this is but a _part_\r\nof the problem. The ascending sap, after undergoing an important\r\nmodification in the leaves, becomes the _descending_ sap; just as the\r\nvenous blood is transformed, on coming into contact with the air in\r\nthe lungs, into arterial blood. It is this alternative movement of\r\n_going and coming_ which constitutes the circulation both of the sap\r\nand the blood, and which ceases completely only with the life of the\r\nplant or the animal. We must, therefore, bear in mind,--which has not\r\nbeen hitherto done,--these two opposite, yet indissolubly connected,\r\nmovements, before we can approach with advantage the solution of the\r\nproposed question.[40]\r\n\r\nScience consists in discovering, among the different ways of looking\r\nat things which present themselves to the mind, the one which appears\r\nto explain most clearly the phenomena submitted to observation. He\r\nwho doubts the accuracy of our remark need only join us in reviewing\r\nthe different opinions enunciated up to the present time on the cause\r\nof the rise of the sap.\r\n\r\nGrew, an English botanist, a contemporary of Newton, and his\r\nfellow-member in the Royal Society of London, attributed the rise of\r\nthe sap to the play of the utricles of which the plant is composed.\r\nThese utricles, he said, maintain a close intercommunication; through\r\ntheir contraction, the sap passes from the lower to the upper, and\r\nthus arrives almost at the top of the plant. Grew's authority carried\r\nconviction to the minds of many botanists, particularly to those\r\nof his compatriots. Yet was his opinion altogether imaginary; the\r\nsupposed contraction of the utricles does not exist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLa Hire, a French botanist, who flourished at the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century,--son of the geometrician of the same\r\nname,--pretended that he could account for the rise of the sap by the\r\nplay of the little valves with which the interior of the sap-vessels\r\nwas furnished; at the same time he assigned a very active _rôle_\r\nto the fibres of the roots. The fibres elevate, he said, the whole\r\ncolumn of superimposed liquid, incessantly introducing, by a kind of\r\nsuction, new fluids into the organs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the \"play of the little valves, with which the\r\ninterior of the sap-vessels is furnished,\" is a pure invention of La\r\nHire's. Instead of growing wise by experiment, he suffered himself\r\nto be led astray by a false analogy. Valves are found in the veins\r\nof man and the mammals; but no one has ever seen the sides of the\r\nvessels of a plant garnished with valves to induce a circulation of\r\nthe sap.\r\n\r\nMariotte, so well known by his researches into the compressibility\r\nof air, represented the rise of the sap as dependent upon what he\r\ncalled \"the attraction taking place in the narrow tubes\"--upon what,\r\nin fact, we now term _capillarity_. \"This first entrance of water\r\ninto the roots is in obedience,\" he said, \"to a law of nature; for\r\nwherever very narrow tubes exist which touch the water, it enters\r\ninto them, and even rises, contrary to its natural inclination.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany botanists adopted the opinion of Mariotte. But if it were\r\nwell founded, all _capillary_ bodies, even inorganic ones, ought\r\nto present a circulatory movement analogous to that of the sap.\r\nNow, this is not the case. A body must be animated, must be living,\r\nfor attraction to take place in the narrow tubes, and to produce a\r\nmovement comparable to that of the nutritive liquid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMalpighi attributed the rise of the sap to the alternating\r\nrarefaction and condensation of this liquid by heat; Perrault, to a\r\nkind of fermentation; De Saussure, to a peculiar irritability of the\r\nvessels. Of these three hypotheses, the first is purely physical; the\r\nsecond, chemical; the third, vital. So, as we see, there is something\r\nfor everybody--_chacun à son gout!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same question has, in our own day, been taken up from a new point\r\nof view, on the occasion of Dutrochet's discovery of the endosmose.\r\nThis philosopher was one of the first to perceive that two liquids,\r\nseparated from one another by a membrane, quickly effect or induce a\r\ncurrent which always carries the thinner liquid towards the denser,\r\nand ends by mingling the two completely. \"It is endosmose,\" he said,\r\n\"which produces at one and the same time the progression of the sap\r\nby _impulsion_, and its progression by _affluxion_. The sap would\r\nreceive its impulse in the spongioles of the roots; thence would be\r\ncarried towards the upper parts by the turgescence of the organs--by\r\nthe affluxion, which would thus act as a forcible mode of suction.\"\r\n\r\nThe basis of this theory is, that the sap contained in the upper\r\nparts will be more concentrated or denser than that in the lower\r\nportions of the same plant. But this is a mere supposition. And even\r\nthis supposition has been swept away by the recent experiments of\r\nHartig and others, which show that the difference in density between\r\nthe two saps is not only almost null, but in many ligneous plants the\r\nlower sap is, on the contrary, denser than the upper.[41]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, and more recently, M. Joseph Boehm has put forth a theory\r\nwhich offers some points of analogy with that of Grew. According to\r\nBoehm, the rise of the sap is the effect of a suction, the cause of\r\nwhich must be sought both in the atmospheric pressure and in the\r\ntranspiration which takes place through the organs, and notably\r\nthrough the leaves of the plant. The part which he attributes to the\r\ncellules, of which the organs are composed, he thus describes:--\"When\r\nthe superficial cellules of the plant lose water by transpiration,\"\r\nhe says, \"of two things, one will happen: either these cellules will\r\ncontract and shrivel, or they carry up, by a kind of aspiration, to\r\nthe neighbouring cellules, situated in deeper layers, a quantity of\r\nwater equivalent to what they had lost. In the normal condition, the\r\nlatter is always the result; each cellule takes from its neighbour\r\nwhat itself has lost, and this action, becoming more and more\r\ngeneral, is continued from the leaves to the extremities of the\r\nroots. The cellules of the spongioles replace the water which they\r\nhave yielded, from the humid medium surrounding them.\"\r\n\r\nIn support of this theory,[42] M. Boehm has made several experiments,\r\nwhich, we fear, will not carry conviction to every mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the different theories which we have been attempting to explain,\r\ntheir authors, as it seems to us, have neglected an essential\r\nelement--the _life_ of the plant. Then, the experiments undertaken\r\nby way of proof, have been made upon cut stems or branches, which,\r\nconsequently, did not enjoy their integral vitality. In fact, the\r\nresults indicated could just as well have been obtained with inert as\r\nwith living matter.\r\n\r\nTaking into account all these considerations, we are doubtful whether\r\nany value can be placed on the theories just enunciated. Undoubtedly,\r\nphysical causes, such as capillarity, heat, evaporation, atmospheric\r\npressure, electricity, have a certain marked and constant action. But\r\nthis action is here complex; it is found combined with a new force,\r\nwhose effects constitute precisely the profound difference which\r\nexists between the massive mineral framework of the globe and the\r\ntransitory beings peopling its surface. It matters little whether we\r\ncall it _vital force_, or otherwise; sufficient that it _exists_. We\r\nmust, therefore, allow for its influence when endeavouring to explain\r\nthe varied movements of which plants, as well as animals, may be the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._--PLANTS.\r\n\r\n_The Daisy_ (_Bellis perennis_).\r\n\r\n    \"Wel by reason men it call maie\r\n    The daisie, or els the eye of the daie.\"[43]\r\n\r\nAmong all the treasures of the floral world, that which should excite\r\nin each of us the tenderest emotion, and most readily stir up in our\r\nminds thoughts too deep for tears, is the Daisy,--that favourite of\r\nour innocent and happy childhood.\r\n\r\nAh! would we were now as content with simple joys as in the days when\r\nthat wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower was to us a beauty, a prize,\r\nand a charm!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--\"The Daisie scattered in each mead and\r\ndown.\"]\r\n\r\nWe wonder how many of our poets have done homage to the sweet and\r\nsimple \"nursling,\" or rather, whether by any _true_ poet it has been\r\nneglected. Cowper reminds us that in\r\n\r\n    \"The spring and play-time of the year\"\r\n\r\nthe village-wife and her little ones go forth to\r\n\r\n    \"Prank their hair with daisies.\"\r\n\r\nJames Montgomery, whose admiration of nature is somewhat frigid, can\r\nyet remind us that--\r\n\r\n    \"The rose has but a summer reign,\r\n        The daisy never dies.\"\r\n\r\nChaucer warms into enthusiasm when he thinks of its pastoral,\r\ninnocent gracefulness (\"simplex munditiis\"):--\r\n\r\n    \"So glad am I when in the Daisy's presence,\r\n    That I am fain to do her reverence;\r\n    For she of all sweet flowers is the flower\r\n    With virtue filled, and honourable power;\r\n    For ever fair alike, and fresh of hue,\r\n    As well in winter as in summer new.\"\r\n\r\nLet us not omit a reference to quaint but genial William Browne:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Daisie, scattered on each meade and down,\r\n    A golden tuft within a silver crowne:\r\n    Fair fall that dainty flower! and may there be\r\n    No shepherd graced that does not honour thee!\"\r\n\r\nYes! let no poet be taken to your heart of hearts who has no love\r\nfor the \"flower white and rede,\"--in French, called \"La Belle\r\nMarguerite,\"--\r\n\r\n    \"The op'ning gowan, wet wi' dew,\"\r\n\r\n--Burns's \"bonnie gem,\"--the flower of the meadow and the lea, of the\r\nwoodland and the vale.\r\n\r\nA modest, unassuming flower, destined to be trodden under the feet\r\nof the thoughtless, it withstands the rigorous breath of winter, is\r\nbeautiful throughout the circle of the year--_Bellis perennis_, as\r\nthe Swedish botanist not infelicitously called it. Its vegetation\r\nis arrested only during the harshest frosts; but it resumes its\r\nliving growth as soon as it becomes sensible of the first rays of the\r\nspring-time sun.\r\n\r\nIt is at the moment of nature's awakening, about \"the solemn\r\nEaster-tide,\" that this \"sweet nursling of the vernal year\" displays\r\nall the simple coquettishness of its chaplet of flowers,--that\r\nchaplet which has also procured for it the name of the tiny\r\n\"Marguerite,\"--that is, \"little pearl,\"--a name which the French have\r\nadopted from the Latin--_Margarita_.\r\n\r\nHere let us pause, and propound a question.\r\n\r\nHow would you propose to test the real character, the genuine nature,\r\nof friend or acquaintance?\r\n\r\nYour answers, dear readers (believe me, I hear them clearly!), are\r\nvery various. Some of you say, that the best means of sounding the\r\ndepths of the human heart is by bringing before it a misery which\r\nneeds to be relieved. Others recommend the bestowal of a benefit. But\r\nsuch processes of analysis appear to me far from being infallible;\r\ntoo wide a margin is left for the operation of sentiments of pride\r\nor vanity. Why not conduct the man whose real character you wish\r\nto discover into a meadow enamelled with sparkling daisies? Thus\r\nyou would impose upon nature the task of interrogating him. If he\r\nmanifest feelings of indifference, you will do well to regard him\r\nwith suspicion: take care how you admit him into your intimacy; for\r\nhis heart must be cold, and his mind troubled--\r\n\r\n    \"The man that takes not daisies to his soul\r\n    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to our daisy. Observe how, by its organs, it yields\r\nitself--in anticipation, as it were--to its fate. And, first, its\r\nlong and fibrous roots anchor it so solidly in the soil that the\r\ncattle which browse it cannot tear it up. Next, its stem is so short\r\nthat it seems to be blended with the roots; one might almost doubt\r\nwhether any existed. But, if you look at it more closely, you may\r\nreadily assure yourself that the stem is the point whence issue the\r\nrecumbent branches which bear the leaves. Why does not the daisy\r\nboast of stems erect and free? Would they not be incessantly bent or\r\nbroken by the merry troops of children who love to play and dance\r\nupon Nature's carpet, the soft green sward?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe leaves of our daisy, then, seem to issue directly from the roots,\r\nwithout the intermediary of an _apparent_ stem, which must not be\r\nconfounded--recollect this, dear reader!--with the stalk or peduncle\r\nthat bears the crown of petals. These leaves in form resemble tiny\r\ncrenelated spatules, with the handles flattened, and the edges\r\ntrimmed with little hairs or fibres. The peduncle, too, seems to\r\nstart immediately from the roots. The principal part of the peduncle\r\nis surmounted, as already hinted, by the flower, to which we next\r\ndirect our inquisitive and searching gaze.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we call it? To what shall we liken it? To a gilded\r\nbutton framed in a pearl. This button, this \"yellow eye,\" as\r\nTabernæmontanus, a botanist of the sixteenth century, named\r\nit,--the \"eye of day\" of our old poets,--a drop of gold in a rim of\r\nsilver,--is not like any other flower; is quite a world or system of\r\nLilliputian blossoms, each of which is represented by a miniature\r\ntube, yellow at the summit, and of a greenish white at the base,--the\r\nsaid tube being the union, or combination, of the tops or summits\r\nforming the central gem, the gilded button, the drop of gold. You may\r\nreadily note this arrangement in the larger variety of daisy, the\r\n_Chrysanthemum leucanthum_ of Linnæus,--two Latinised Greek words\r\nwhich signify, literally, \"golden-blossomed white flower.\"\r\n\r\nIf you doubt whether each of these tiny tubes be a flower, you have\r\nonly to analyse them with the assistance of your ever-useful lens.\r\nThe analysis of one will suffice; for all the others resemble it.\r\nNow, with your penknife, split the tube throughout its entire length:\r\nyou will thus lay bare all the parts which enter into the composition\r\nof a veritable flower, commencing with the most conspicuous. Through\r\nthe magnifying glass you can see five stamens,--free as regards\r\ntheir short filaments, but united by their elongated anthers;\r\na characteristic which gives name to the great family of the\r\n_Synantheraceæ_, of which family our daisy is an honoured member;--a\r\nbifid (_i.e._, cloven in two) style traversing the middle of the\r\nanthers, which form for it a kind of sheath (see Fig. 31, _a_);--a\r\nmonopetalous, tubular, and obscurely bilabiated (two-lipped) corolla,\r\ninserted at the summit of an unilocular (one-lobed) ovary, which is\r\nattached to the calyx (see Fig. 31, _b_). In these tiny flowers,\r\nthen, which we call in Latin _flosculi_, in French _fleurons_, in\r\nEnglish _florets_, nothing is deficient. As they are shaped like\r\ntubes, we call them, by way of distinction, _tubulifloral_.\r\n\r\nBut what are these white rays, lightly shaded with pink, which\r\nenclose or encircle the florets? (See Fig. 32, _a_.) Examine them\r\nat their points of insertion. You will perceive there some traces\r\nof reproductive organs, among which the style is most prominent. As\r\nfor the corolla, it is represented only by its brown lip, which is\r\nimmeasurably developed. It is this exaggerated development which\r\nconstitutes the _white rays_, or petals, that prove so attractive to\r\nthe eye. (See Fig. 32, _b_.) Do not forget to observe, by the way,\r\nthat they are rose-tinted only on the side which directly undergoes\r\nthe action of the light. To distinguish them from the tubular\r\nflorets,--the _tubulifloræ_,--these \"white rays\" have been called\r\n_ligulate florets_, or _ligulifloræ_.\r\n\r\nThe complete flowers (or the florets) and the rays (or partially\r\nabortive flowers) form, in their aggregate, what our botanists\r\nhave agreed to call an _inflorescence of the capitula_. Disposed\r\nquincuncially on an ovoid receptacle, or _phoranth_, both are grouped\r\n(Fig. 32, _c_) in alternating rows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nTo explain thoroughly this species of inflorescence, we will venture\r\nupon an hypothesis. Let us suppose that we could elongate the said\r\novoid receptacle as if it were a ball of wax,--it would be changed\r\ninto a sheath-like inflorescence; all our smaller florets, whose\r\nunion composes what is improperly called the _flower_ of the daisy,\r\nwould be ranged around an elongated, instead of being placed upon a\r\nflattened axis. This axis characterises all the Synantheraceæ of the\r\nfamily of the Compositæ (a sub-order); sometimes naked, sometimes\r\ngarnished with varied hairs, either shrunken or persistent, it has\r\nfurnished several characters useful in the classification of genera\r\nand species. But possessed with a mania for complicating everything,\r\nbotanists designate it indifferently _receptacle_, _phoranthe_,\r\n_clinanthe_, etc. Why not employ one and the same word to distinguish\r\none and the same thing? Why not have preserved the name _axis_, and\r\nhave attached to it such qualifying terms as might be necessary to\r\nindicate simple differences of forms?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancients looked upon nature,--I cannot sufficiently insist\r\nupon this theme,--with quite other eyes than we do. The study and\r\ndescription of characters, so indispensable to our classifications\r\nand nomenclatures, appeared to them a useless labour; they had not\r\neven an idea of its value. But it was of signal importance to them\r\nto investigate the virtues and properties of plants, so far as they\r\nmight be rendered available for the preservation of health and the\r\ncure of disease.\r\n\r\nOur daisy is common in Greece. Theophrastus, therefore, ought to\r\nhave known it, though he does not refer to it. It is common also in\r\nthe plains of Italy. Pliny was the first to describe it, under the\r\nname of _bellis_; he attributes to it the properties of the St John's\r\nwort.[44] And it is noteworthy that the daisy belongs to the same\r\nfamily as the latter; a circumstance certainly not known in the days\r\nof Pliny.\r\n\r\nThe botanists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are by no\r\nmeans niggards in the eulogiums which they lavish on the medicinal\r\nproperties of our graceful Synantheracea. Bock (better known,\r\nperhaps, under the name of _Tragus_, a Goat), who mistook the yellow\r\nanthers for the seeds, recommended the leaves of the _Gänzeblume_\r\n(goose-flower, as he called it) as a laxative. Tabernæmontanus\r\nprescribed them as a remedy for cramps in the stomach and the\r\nspitting of blood.\r\n\r\nRay, who expresses his astonishment that the Greeks had not spoken of\r\nit, looked upon the daisy as an excellent vulnerary. \"Externally,\"\r\nsays he, \"we employ it with success in the form either of a poultice\r\nor a fomentation; for internal treatment, we mix its juice with\r\nvulnerary potions.\"--These properties procured it the name of\r\n_Consolida minor_, which would make it the pendant of the larger\r\nConsolida, _Symphytum officinale_, a species of the Boraginaceæ, very\r\ncommon in damp and shady localities.\r\n\r\nRuel recommended cataplasms of daisies and cowslips for gout and\r\nscrofulous tumours. Chomel affirmed that he knew by experience\r\nthat the flowers of the daisy and the _herb robert_[45] (_Geranium\r\nRobertianum_), if dried in a hot dish, and applied to the head,\r\nconsiderably relieved headache.[46]\r\n\r\nWepfer set great value on a mixture of daisy, cress, and rummularia\r\nin the treatment of pneumonia; and Michaelis assures us that he had\r\ncured dropsies by the use of the flowers of the daisy cooked as a\r\nbroth.\r\n\r\nTournefort, who was very partial to this kind of observation,--now\r\nrepudiated by our botanists,--says, that the daisy, taken as a\r\nwarm drink or a decoction, quickens the blood when congealed by a\r\nvery severe attack of cold, as happens in pneumonia; it removes\r\nobstructions, facilitates the circulation, and gives the fibres an\r\nopportunity of recovering their elasticity.[47]\r\n\r\nGaridel sums up in the following words the result of his personal\r\nobservations:--\"I have frequently remarked that the juice of the\r\ndaisy acts as a laxative, and even as a purgative; the decoction does\r\nnot have that effect so often as Schroeder observes, who says that\r\nmothers frequently give the leaves as a gentle aperient to their\r\nchildren.... Care should be taken not to administer this remedy\r\nindifferently to all pleuretics, nor at any season; for if we give it\r\nwhen the expectoration is easy, we run the risk, by the employment\r\nof a laxative at a wrong time, of spoiling everything, and checking\r\nthe expectoration. This I have seen occur in several cases, where the\r\nremedy had been administered by a hermit.\"[48]\r\n\r\nCan it be true that the commonest plants are the most useful? Nature\r\nis quite capable of affording us these surprises; nature, who, by her\r\nshifting and proteiform movements, never ceases to laugh at human\r\ntheories. But men, as was said long ago, have eyes, though not to\r\nsee; and everybody also knows, from his own experience, that he has\r\nears, not to understand!\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the daisy, which, as we have seen, was formerly\r\nso extolled for its officinal properties, is now-a-days completely\r\nignored by physicians. What, then, are we to conclude? That all the\r\nremedies in vogue--melancholy to confess!--are an affair of fashion.\r\nWhen men shall have resumed perukes, and women abandoned chignons\r\nfor furbelows, we shall remember, perhaps, the virtues of the lowly,\r\ntender daisy.\r\n\r\nWe cannot take leave of our favourite wild-flower without repeating\r\nWordsworth's beautiful stanzas. He takes as his motto a fine passage\r\nfrom Wither, quaint old George Wither:--\r\n\r\n    \"Her [the Muse's] divine skill taught me this,\r\n    That from everything I saw\r\n    I could some instruction draw,\r\n    And raise pleasure to the height\r\n    Through the meanest object's sight.\r\n    By the murmur of a spring\r\n    Or the least bough's rustelling;\r\n    By a daisy whose leaves spread\r\n    Shut when Titan goes to bed;...\r\n    She could more infuse in me\r\n    Than all Nature's beauties can\r\n    In some other wiser man.\"\r\n\r\nOn this hint our great meditative poet speaks, and speaks most\r\ntenderly and truly:--\r\n\r\n    \"In youth from rock to rock I went,\r\n    From hill to hill, in discontent\r\n    Of pleasure high and turbulent,\r\n        Most pleased when most uneasy;\r\n    But now my own delights I make,--\r\n    My thirst at every rill can slake,\r\n    And gladly Nature's love partake\r\n        Of thee, sweet daisy!...\r\n\r\n    \"By violets in their secret mews\r\n    The flowers the wanton zephyrs choose;\r\n    Proud be the rose, with rains and dews\r\n        Her head impearling;\r\n    Thou liv'st with less ambitious aim,\r\n    Yet hast not gone without thy fame;\r\n    Thou art, indeed, by many a claim,\r\n        The poet's darling.\r\n\r\n    \"If to a rock from rains he fly,\r\n    Or, some bright day of April sky,\r\n    Imprison'd by hot sunshine lie,\r\n        Near the green holly,\r\n    And wearily at length should fare;\r\n    He need but look about, and there\r\n    Thou art! a friend at hand, to scare\r\n        His melancholy.\r\n\r\n    \"A hundred times, by rock or bower,\r\n    Ere thus I have lain couch'd an hour,\r\n    Have I derived from thy sweet power\r\n        Some apprehension;\r\n    Some steady love; some brief delight;\r\n    Some memory that had taken flight;\r\n    Some chime of fancy, wrong or right,\r\n        Or stray invention....\r\n\r\n    \"Oft do I sit by thee at ease,\r\n    And weave a web of similes,\r\n    Loose types of things through all degrees.\r\n        Thoughts of thy raising;\r\n    And many a fond and idle name\r\n    I give to thee, for praise or blame,\r\n    As is the humour of the game,\r\n        While I am gazing.\r\n\r\n    \"A nun demure, of lowly port,\r\n    Or sprightly maiden of Love's court,\r\n    In thy simplicity the sport\r\n        Of all temptations;\r\n    A queen in crown of rubies dress'd;\r\n    A starveling in a scanty vest;\r\n    Are all, as seem to suit thee best,\r\n        Thy appellations.\r\n\r\n    \"A little cyclops, with one eye\r\n    Staring to threaten and defy,--\r\n    That thought comes next; and instantly\r\n        The freak is over;\r\n    The shape will vanish, and, behold!\r\n    A silver shield with boss of gold,\r\n    That spreads itself, some fairy bold\r\n        In fight to cover.\r\n\r\n    \"I see thee glittering from afar,\r\n    And there thou art a pretty star;\r\n    Not quite so fair as many are\r\n        In heaven above thee!\r\n    Yet like a star, with glittering crest,\r\n    Self-pois'd in air, thou seem'st to rest:\r\n    May peace come never to his breast\r\n        Who shall reprove thee!\"\r\n\r\nWe may add that we know but of four references to the daisy in\r\nShakspeare. In _Cymbeline_, act iv., scene 2:--\r\n\r\n                              \"Let us\r\n    Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Love's Labour's Lost_, act v., scene 2:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where daisies pied[49] and violets blue\r\n    Do paint the meadows with delight.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, in _Hamlet_, act iv., scene 7:--\r\n\r\n    \"There with fantastic garlands did she come\r\n    Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, in _Hamlet_, act iv., scene 5:--\r\n\r\n      \"There's a daisy; I would give you some violets, but they\r\n      withered all when my father died.\"\r\n\r\nIn Milton there are but two allusions. In the Masque of _Comus_:--\r\n\r\n    \"By dimpled brook and fountain-brim,\r\n    The wood-nymphs, deck'd with daisies trim,\r\n    Their merry wakes and pastimes keep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in _L'Allegro_:[50]--\r\n\r\n    \"Meadows trim with daisies pied.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TULIP.\r\n\r\n    \"The pied windflowers and the tulip tall.\"\r\n\r\n    --SHELLEY.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, for the majority of floral amateurs, the name\r\nof the tulip is inseparable from a plant which, with the hyacinth\r\nand the lily, becomes, in the merry spring-time, the ornament of\r\nour gardens. Yet, towards the end of March, the observer will\r\noccasionally discover, in the woods and groves, the _wild tulip_,[51]\r\nthe _Tulipa sylvestris_ of Linnæus, which may, perhaps, be very\r\nproperly taken for the type of a small tribe of the Liliaceæ. It\r\nis easily recognised by its flower, which resembles a large yellow\r\ncampanula, slightly green on the exterior. Like all plants of the\r\nsame family, it has but a single floral envelope or perianth, which\r\nmay be either a corolla or a calyx as you will. The initiated protest\r\nand asseverate that it is a calyx; but the _profanum vulgus_, who\r\ncompose the majority, will have it to be a corolla, on account of its\r\ncolouring. To cut the knot, and please all parties, our beautiful\r\nfloral envelope has been denominated a _petaloid perianth_.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of this perianth, six in number, may, in truth, be\r\nconsidered as _petals_; they are detached down to the base, and full\r\nin proportion as the pistil is developed. The latter is composed\r\nof three stigmata, attached, without the intermediary of a stylus\r\n(sessile stigmata), to a free ovary (that is, an ovary not joined\r\nto the perianth), which, as it develops, forms a capsule with three\r\nangular projections marking so many lobes; each of these lobes\r\nincludes a great number of compressed seeds. As in all the Liliaceæ,\r\nand in many other vegetable families, the stamens, six in number, are\r\n_hypogynous_,--that is to say, inserted at the base of the division\r\nof the perianth. The stem, nearly two feet in height, bears a single\r\nflower only: the leaves are lanceolate, like all of the family,\r\nand the root is formed of a bulb, with thin and brownish-coloured\r\nexternal _tunicæ_.\r\n\r\nIs the wild tulip an original species, or only a degenerate variety\r\nof the cultivated tulip (_Tulipa Gesneriana_)? The question is one\r\nnot very easily solved.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that the cultivated tulip,--which everybody\r\nknows,--was introduced into Europe from the East, towards the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century. It is, at all events, certain that none of\r\nour older botanists speak of our wild tulip. Dodonnée himself refers\r\nto the Eastern tulip only, of which he was the first to give, in his\r\n\"Historia Stirpium,\" a tolerable delineation.\r\n\r\nA circumstance which would favour the belief that the tulip was\r\nimported from the East is the Oriental derivation of its name:\r\n_tulipa_, in Italian _tulipano_, comes to us, it is said, from the\r\nTurkish _tuliband_, or the Persian _dulbend_, whence is obtained, by\r\ncorruption, _turban_, the characteristic head-gear of the Orientals.\r\nThus, at bottom, _tulip_ and _turban_ are the same word, only altered\r\nin form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWho does not know with what a glory of colours the skill of our\r\nhorticulturists has succeeded in clothing the tulip?\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the cultivated species bears the distinctive addition\r\nof _Gesneriana_,--and of this species all existing tulips are but\r\nvarieties,--we might reasonably suppose that Gesner, the celebrated\r\nSwiss naturalist (who died at Zurich, aged sixty-nine, in 1565),\r\nwas the first to speak of it. But he makes no allusion to it in his\r\n\"Historia Plantarum\" (printed at Bâle in 1541); he only refers to it\r\nin his \"Additions\" to the works of Valerius Cordus, published in 1561.\r\n\r\nWe subjoin a literal translation of the words of Conrad Gesner:--\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1559, at the beginning of April, I saw at Augsburg, in\r\nthe garden of F. H. Herwart, magistrate of that town, a plant whose\r\nseed had been brought from Constantinople, or, according to some,\r\nfrom Cappadocia. It was called _tulip_.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the same epoch, this plant was cultivated at Vienna, in the\r\ngardens of some wealthy amateurs; whence several tulip-bulbs were\r\nafterwards sent into England.\r\n\r\nThis ornamental plant, whose splendour is of such brief duration,\r\nbecame, towards the middle of the sixteenth century, the object of\r\na commercial speculation, which marks an epoch in horticultural\r\nannals. The towns of Amsterdam, Haarlem, Utrecht, Alkmar, Leyden, and\r\nRotterdam, were the head-quarters of the new trade.\r\n\r\nThe years 1634 to 1637 marked its apogee, its culmination; it was\r\nthe reign of the _tulipomania_,--a malady which, notwithstanding\r\nits severity, does not figure among our pathological nomenclatures.\r\nBulbs of the variety called _Viceroy_ were sold for 3000 florins\r\n(£235) each; and amateurs paid even as high as 5000 florins (£430)\r\nfor the _Semper Augustus_ variety! Those who had not the needful\r\namount of ready money disposed of their goods, their cattle, and\r\ntheir furniture. And not only the horticulturists, but the seamen,\r\nand artisans, and servants, plunged headlong, into this frantic\r\ngambling. Tulip bulbs were then as eagerly sought after as shares in\r\nthe company of the Mississippi in the days of Law,--or in the South\r\nSea Stocks, also set afloat by that ingenious financier.\r\n\r\nBut it was not so much a love of flowers as a lust of speculation\r\nwhich lay at the bottom of this famous mania. For example, a\r\ngentleman engaged a merchant to deliver, at the end of six months,\r\na bulb worth 1000 florins. When the time came, the price of the\r\nbulb had either gone up or down, and the contractor paid only the\r\ndifference; as for delivering the wares, neither party cared about\r\nit. It was, therefore, the exact equivalent of a speculation in the\r\nfunds or in railway shares. The transactions took place on the public\r\nexchanges, as well as in coffee-houses, inns, and on the promenades.\r\nThey originated a fertile crop of abuses, and to put an end to them\r\nthe intervention of the Government was required.\r\n\r\nHowever, we may cite several examples of distinguished men who have\r\ncherished a partiality for the tulip, in the better sense of the\r\nword. Among these was Justus Lipsius, the great philologist. In his\r\ngarden he cultivated with his own hands, it is said, the rarest\r\nvarieties, and his floricultural tastes were shared by two of his\r\nintimate friends, Dodonée (Diodati) and L'Écluse, the two most\r\nillustrious botanists of their time.\r\n\r\nBut all these details, however curious and interesting, do not teach\r\nus whether our wild tulip has sprung from the cultivated germs. As it\r\nis impossible to solve this problem experimentally, we are forced to\r\nbe satisfied with a simple conjecture.\r\n\r\nAnd, for our own part, we are strongly of opinion that the wild\r\nand cultivated tulips may, from their very origin, have co-existed\r\nindependently of one another. And now to put forward a fact in\r\nsupport of this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HELIOTROPE.\r\n\r\nWith the Heliotrope every lover of flowers is familiar; it is not\r\nless prized for its delicate fragrance than the tulip for its\r\nglowing colours. No doubt exists as to the country from which we\r\nhave imported the cultivated heliotrope, nor as to the epoch when it\r\nwas introduced: it came from Peru, whence the name given to it by\r\nLinnæus, _Heliotropium Peruvianium_; and was brought into Europe,\r\nin 1740, by Joseph de Jussieu. Although not known in Europe above\r\na hundred and thirty years, it is now an \"old, familiar face\" in\r\nevery garden. Now, by the side of the cultivated species, a native\r\nof the New World, we can place a wild variety, indigenous to the Old\r\nWorld, common in our own country, and, indeed, in all the countries\r\nof temperate Europe; whence it has received the appellation of\r\n_Heliotropium Europæum_.\r\n\r\nThe European species, let me state, is in every respect similar to\r\nthe Peruvian species, except that its flowers are inodorous and of a\r\npaler blue. Yet it was known before the discovery of America,--before\r\nthe discovery of those regions from which we have obtained the\r\ncultivated heliotrope. Thus, the two varieties have existed\r\ncontemporaneously, and have flourished independently of each other,\r\nfrom their very origin. Why should not such be the case with the wild\r\nand cultivated tulip?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANEMONES.\r\n\r\nFrom our Spring posy the delicate Anemones must not be omitted.\r\nMore than twenty species are cultivated in Great Britain, and I\r\nhardly know to which I would give the preference. They are called\r\nby that most unmeaning term, \"florist's flowers,\" and from the\r\nattention bestowed upon them, the cultivated varieties have been\r\ngreatly improved. But you and I, dear reader, will go forth into\r\nthe \"wild woods,\" and enjoy the rich gifts of nature untampered\r\nby horticultural science. It is towards the end of March that the\r\nwood anemone (_Anemone nemorosa_) begins to expand its graceful\r\nleaves and snow-white buds to the stray sunbeams that force their\r\nway through the embowering branches of stately elms and spreading\r\nbeeches, and in April it has attained its full glory, contributing\r\nlargely to the beauty and the show which then embellish the\r\nforest glade. Snow-white, and faint rose-red, and soft delicate\r\nlilac,--these are the prevailing hues of its tender petals.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the wood anemone never blossoms earlier than March\r\n16, and never later than April 2. It opens out its loveliness to\r\nthe sun about the same time as the swallow returns from the genial\r\nSouth to our land of pleasant verdure. Country children associate it\r\nwith the appearance of the cuckoo, and call it the \"cuckoo flower,\"\r\nbut the \"wandering voice\" is later than the woodland blossom in its\r\nwelcome to the spring.\r\n\r\nWhy is it called _Anemone_? Of course, the English name is derived\r\nfrom the Greek άνεμος, \"wind;\" but what connexion is there between\r\nthe wind and the flower? Credulous old Pliny asserted that it never\r\nbloomed except when the wind blew. Some of our botanical writers\r\nexplain that it shivers and bends before the winds of March and the\r\nbreezes of April. Others remind us that though generally found in the\r\nshelter of the groves, it will thrive lustily in windy and exposed\r\nlocalities. But I suspect the true reason of the name is its peculiar\r\nsensitiveness to atmospheric changes. As a foreteller of the storm it\r\nis not less trustworthy than a barometer, never failing to fold up\r\nits exquisite petals when the winds are gathering over the distant\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nOur plant is considered injurious food for cattle; and it was on\r\naccount of its unwholesome properties, perhaps, that the Egyptians\r\nregarded it as an emblem of sickness; or the idea may have been\r\nsuggested by its frail and feeble appearance.\r\n\r\nThe yellow wood anemone is a rare and beautiful variety, which I have\r\nsometimes met with among the chalky downs of Kent. Its botanical\r\ndesignation is _Anemone ranunculoides_.\r\n\r\nA still richer species is the _Anemone pulsatilla_, or Pasque Flower\r\nAnemone; a silky downy plant, easily recognised by its blossom of\r\nglowing purple. The blue mountain anemone (_Anemone Apennina_) is\r\nonly to be found, as its name indicates, on the bold rugged sides of\r\nlofty mountain-heights.\r\n\r\nThe Anemones belong to a very important order,--the _Ranunculaceæ_,\r\nor Crowfoot family,--which is divided into five sub-orders: 1.\r\nClematidæ; 2. Anemoneæ; 3. Ranunculaceæ; 4. Helliboreæ; and 5.\r\nActœæ, or Pœniæ. Linnæus distinguishes forty-one known genera,\r\ncomprising a thousand species. There are nine British genera of\r\nAnemoneæ.\r\n\r\nIn Drayton's \"Poly-Olbion\" occurs a rich descriptive passage,--an\r\nexquisite \"flower-piece,\"--which, on account of its beauty, deserves\r\nto be better known, and more frequently quoted. The poet is enlarging\r\nupon the floral rites which were celebrated at the espousals of the\r\nrivers Thame and Isis, and sets before us a bright bevy of Nymphs\r\nand Naiads; engaged in twining \"dainty chaplets\" to deck the persons\r\nof the bride and bridegroom. The stalwart Thame,--so it seems to\r\nthem,--should not be \"dressed with flowers to gardens that belong,\"\r\nbut with blossoms plucked from his own meads and pastures. As most of\r\nthose selected are fit for a spring-time nosegay, we may well enrich\r\nour pages with quaint old Drayton's enumeration of them:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Primrose placing first, because that in the Spring\r\n    It is the first appears; then only flourishing;\r\n    The azured Harebell next with them they neatly mixt,\r\n    T' allay whose luscious smell they Woodbine placed betwixt.\r\n    Among those things of scent there prick they in the Lily,\r\n    And near to that again her sister Daffodilly.\r\n    To sort these flowers of show with others that were sweet,\r\n    The Cowslip there they couch, and the Oxlip for her meet;\r\n    The Columbine amongst them they sparingly do set,\r\n    The yellow King-cup, wrought in many a curious fret;[52]\r\n    And now and then among, of Eglantine a spray,\r\n    By which again a course of Lady-mocks they lay;\r\n    The Crow-flower, and thereby the Clorra-flower they stick,\r\n    The Daisy over all those sundry sweets so thick,\r\n    As Nature doth herself to imitate her right;\r\n    Who seems in that her 'pearl' so greatly to delight,\r\n    That every plain therewith she powdereth to behold.\r\n    The crimson Darnel-flower, the Blue-bottle and gold,\r\n    Which, though esteemed but weeds, yet, for their dainty hues,\r\n    And for their scent, not ill, they for their purpose choose.\r\n    Thus, having told you how the Bridegroom Thames was drest,\r\n    I'll show you how the Bride, fair Isis, they invest.\"\r\n\r\nHere the poet resorts to the garden for his decorative wreath, but\r\nis careful, as we shall see, to eschew \"florist's flowers,\" and to\r\nselect only our dear old favourites:--\r\n\r\n    \"The red, the dainty white, the gaudy Damask Rose,\r\n    The brave Carnation, then, of sweet and sovereign power\r\n    (So of his colour called, although a July flower),\r\n    With the other of his kind, the speckled and the pale;\r\n    Then the odoriferous Pink that sends forth such a gale\r\n    Of sweetness, yet in scents as various as in sorts;\r\n    The purple Violet then the Pansy there supports;\r\n    The Marigold above t' adorn the arched bar;\r\n    The double Daisy, Thrift, the Button-Bachelor;\r\n    Sweet William, Sops in Wine, the Campion, and to these\r\n    Some Lavender they put, and Rosemary, and Bays;\r\n    Sweet Marjoram with her like, sweet Basil rare for smell,\r\n    With many a flower whose name were now too long to tell.\"\r\n\r\nIf our space permitted, we should like to gossip awhile about each\r\nof the flowers commemorated by our old poet, for to each attaches\r\nsome legend, or romantic tradition, some rural observance, or sweet\r\npoetical association. But we must continue our researches, and they\r\nbring us now to the _Arum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARUM.\r\n\r\nTo the French the Arum is commonly known as the Calf's foot (_Pied de\r\nveau_). It is a common enough plant, growing on the borders of the\r\nwood, and delighting especially in the shade of the hazel trees, but\r\nit bears not the slightest resemblance to the hoof of any quadruped\r\nwhatsoever, unless, indeed, to a very fervid imagination there should\r\nbe visible a shadowy similitude in its leaf.\r\n\r\nAnd it is, in truth, asserted--but, not having the eye of faith, the\r\neditor cannot see any ground for the assertion--that its sagillate\r\nor arrow-headed leaves, marked by a strongly-defined midrib, bear a\r\ncertain likeness to the \"under bi-ungulated face\" of the foot of a\r\nyoung ruminant. Appearing in the early days of spring, they contrast\r\nagreeably, by their shining verdure, with the colour of the dead\r\nleaves heaped up at the base of the hedgerows. Simultaneously with\r\nits leaves comes forth a curious organ,--rare in vegetables of\r\ntemperate regions, common in the tropical palms, and characteristic\r\nof the family of the Aroidaceæ, to which our Arum belongs. This\r\norgan, rolled up in a coil or spiral, is named the _spathe_.\r\nIt protects the flowers in their young state, and, as they are\r\ndeveloped, gradually falls off. Its colour is a greenish yellow; at\r\nthe summit it is sometimes streaked with purplish veins, and at the\r\nbase it swells out in a globose fashion.\r\n\r\nA small thermometer, introduced into the interior of the rolled-up\r\nspathe, indicates a rise of temperature equal to one or two degrees\r\nabove that of the external atmosphere. Whence comes this difference?\r\nBecause in the spathe is frequently found imprisoned another organ,\r\nthe seat of the mystery of reproduction. This organ is a fleshy axis,\r\non which are arranged the flowers in two distinct rings; the upper is\r\noccupied by the stamens, reduced to simple anthers (sessile stamens);\r\nobserve the filamentous appendages--they are abortive ovaries. These\r\nsame appendages also surmount the lower ring, where several rows\r\nare set of sessile ovaries; each ovary composed of a single lobe,\r\ncontaining a very small number of ovules, the majority of which\r\nmiscarry as the ovaries become metamorphosed into bright red berries:\r\nthese are the fruits which appear in autumn; they form a spike or ear\r\nof coral, each containing, ordinarily, a single seed. The flowers, as\r\na consequence of this separation of the two sexes, are _monœcious_;\r\nthe succulent axis which bears them is called a spadix.[53] On\r\ntearing open the spathe, our glance first rests upon the apex of the\r\nspadix, which has a club-like form, and is of a beautiful violet-red\r\ncolour. The two rings of sexual organs have much less attraction for\r\nthe profane; the lower ring, loaded with female flowers, is more\r\nprominent than the upper ring, which bears the male flowers.\r\n\r\nThe root of our Arum also deserves a particular examination. It is\r\na white tubercular stock or stem, containing a quantity of fecula,\r\nmixed, as in the West Indian manioc, with an acrid poisonous\r\nprinciple which produces a burning painful heat in the throat. This\r\ninjurious principle is destroyed by exposure to the fire, and by\r\nrepeatedly boiling the plant in water. After being thus heated, there\r\nremains only the fecula, in the form of a white powder, which, in\r\ntimes of scarcity, supplies a very nutritious food. \"I made use of\r\nit,\" says Bosc, \"during the storms of the Revolution, when I had\r\ntaken refuge in the solitudes of the forest of Montmorency. This\r\nplant is so abundant in this forest, and in many other localities,\r\nthat, at the epoch I speak of, it would have ensured the subsistence\r\nof several thousands of men, if they had known its alimentary\r\nproperties. I was seriously counting on the resources which it would\r\nplace at my disposal, when the death of Robespierre relieved me from\r\nmy difficulties.\"[54]\r\n\r\nOur _arum_, which we have taken as a type of the family of the\r\nAroidaceæ, is called _maculatum_, or \"spotted,\" in allusion to the\r\nwhite and violet spots with which its leaves are besprinkled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--The _Arum arisarum_.]\r\n\r\nAnother, and not less interesting species, is the _Arum arisarum_.\r\n(See Fig. 34, _a_.) It loves to display its exquisite leafage on the\r\nrocks bordering the \"sea-marge,\" and is found in profusion along\r\nalmost the entire littoral of the Mediterranean. It is a precocious\r\nflower--making its appearance about the end of December, and\r\nflourishing until the beginning of Spring. The spathe, which in the\r\n_Arum maculatum_ has all the aspect of an etiolated leaf, assumes,\r\nin the _Arum arisarum_, the tints of a corolla,--is of a beautiful\r\nwarm red violet, streaked with white. The fleshy axis, which ought\r\nrather to be called gynandrous (both male and female) than a spadix,\r\nis of a red colour; naked in its upper portion, which terminates with\r\na kind of apple. It would remind a drummer-boy of the formidable\r\nstaff carried by his drum-major (see Fig. 34, _b_.); the stamens,\r\nreduced to the condition of bilobed anthers, are mounted around the\r\ncentral part; and the ovaries, less numerous than the stamens, occupy\r\nthe base of the axis. Each monocular ovary is crowned by a sessile\r\nstigma, and each lobe contains a great number of erect ovules. In\r\nthe _Arum maculatum_, the number of ovules does not exceed six. Some\r\nbotanists have laid hold of this characteristic as an excuse for\r\nwithdrawing the Mediterranean species from the _arums_, and creating\r\na new genus, _arisarum_. The variety we have just described is, in\r\nthat case, denominated the _Arisarum vulgare_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancients have mentioned numerous species of the _arum_. But\r\nit is a very difficult task to bring their nomenclature into any\r\nkind of agreement with the species described by modern botanists.\r\nHowever, we may, I think, regard the _arisarum_ of Pliny and\r\nDioscorides as positively identical with our _Arum arisarum_.\r\nBut we are unable to admit that the _aron_, the _hepha_, the\r\n_dracunculus_, the _dracontium_, can be, as commentators represent,\r\none and the same plant; still less can we admit that this plant is\r\nour _Arum maculatum_, which is very much rarer in the south than in\r\nthe north and centre of Europe. In the solution of such problems\r\nas these, geographical botany is an element which must not be\r\nneglected. Unfortunately it has never been taken into account by the\r\ncommentators on the great classical authorities.\r\n\r\nLet me advance a simple proposition. Since the potatoe has become\r\ndiseased, and the species tends to degenerate, may we not find a\r\nsubstitute for it,--at least, a partial one,--among our Aroids, and,\r\nnotably, in the _Arum maculatum_?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RANUNCULACEÆ.\r\n\r\nLet us return for a while to the order of Ranunculaceæ, of which\r\nthe Anemones have already furnished us with a specimen. Several very\r\npoisonous plants are members of this order; and, in truth, very few\r\ncan be pronounced wholly innocent. I do not think there is much\r\nharm in the _Lesser Celandine_, however--the glossy, starry flower,\r\nyellow as a buttercup, with heart-shaped leaves, which Wordsworth has\r\ncelebrated:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ere a leaf is on the bush,\r\n    In the time before the thrush\r\n    Has a thought about its nest,\r\n    Thou wilt come with half a call,\r\n    Spreading out thy glossy breast,\r\n    Like a careless prodigal;\r\n    Telling tales about the sun,\r\n    When we've little warmth or none.\"\r\n\r\nThere cannot be much harm in it, for in the north of Europe the\r\npeasantry boil its leaves, and eat them as greens. It thrives in\r\nall parts of England, in green woods and meadows, and on wild furzy\r\nwastes and open commons; under leafy hedges, and even in the gay\r\npastures, among the primroses and hepaticas. A number of small,\r\ngrain-like tubers lie around it, close to the surface of the earth;\r\nwhence it was a common saying in \"the days of old\" that this plant\r\nshowered down wheat in its vicinity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the same order belongs the _Buttercup_ (_Ranunculus bulbosus_),\r\nwhose bulbous root procured for it from our forefathers the name of\r\n\"St Anthony's turnip.\"\r\n\r\nIf the good saint ever partook of buttercup-corms, we do not envy\r\nhim his sensations; when boiled, they disorder the stomach, and if\r\neaten raw, act as an emetic.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly thought, says a pleasing writer, that crowfoot (the\r\nbuttercup is a species of crowfoot), mingled with the pasture,\r\nimproved its nature, and that the butter yielded by cows which fed\r\nupon this mixture was of a superior quality. _Nous avons changé tout\r\ncela_; we are wiser now; and have discovered that cows carefully\r\navoid eating buttercups, and that several kinds of crowfoot are even\r\npoisonous to cattle. On some pasture-lands, in those countries where\r\nthe produce of the dairy receives particular attention, women and\r\nchildren are employed to destroy the crowfoot, which they do either\r\nby pulling up the root, or by plucking off the flower, and preventing\r\nit from dispersing its seed. The root of the buttercup is of a highly\r\nstimulating property if taken in an uncooked state, and its juice\r\nwill occasion sneezing; but boiling deprives this, as well as many\r\nother vegetable productions, of its injurious properties. A similar\r\neffect is produced by drying it in the sun; wherefore the hay crop is\r\nnot at all deteriorated by its acrid nature.\r\n\r\nA very beautiful ornament of still pools and gently-flowing streams\r\nis the _Water-ranunculus_ (_Ranunculus aqua atilis_), whose leaves\r\nvary according to the depth, or calmness, or swiftness of their\r\nwatery habitat, and are thus adapted to permit the passage of water\r\nwithout suffering any injury from its force. The leaves on the\r\nsurface have a round lobed shape; those immersed hang down in thin\r\nsmall fibres, which offer but little resistance to the current.\r\n\r\nThe RANUNCULACEÆ also include the _Black Hellebore_, or Christmas\r\nrose (_Helleborus niger_), one of our most splendid winter-garden\r\ndecorations, whose juice the ancients considered a wonderful remedy\r\nfor mental disorders. In whiteness it rivals the snow, which often\r\naccumulates around it, and the snow-drop, which is frequently bound\r\nup in the same wreath. It is called the _Black Hellebore_, to\r\ndistinguish it from the two wild species which grow in our woods, its\r\nroot being covered with a thick black skin.\r\n\r\nThe fragrant white _Clematis_ must not be omitted; its starry drops\r\nare \"things of beauty,\" which every true poetic eye will know how to\r\nappreciate. It is sometimes called \"Traveller's Joy,\" and sometimes\r\n\"Virgin's Bower;\" either name is richly suggestive of pleasant\r\nfancies. Do you remember the beautiful picture in Keats's \"Endymion,\"\r\nof the shady sacred retreat where Adonis lay and slumbered? The\r\nclematis was one of the precious flowers that adorned it:--\r\n\r\n                    \"Above his head\r\n    Four lily stalks did their white honours wed,\r\n    To make a coronal, and round him grew\r\n    All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,\r\n    Together intertwined and trammelled fresh;\r\n    The vine of glossy sprout,--the ivy mesh,\r\n    Shading its Ethiop berries,--and woodbine,\r\n    Of velvet leaves and bugle blooms divine;--\r\n    Convolvulus in streakèd vases blush,\r\n    The creeper mellowing for an autumn flush,--\r\n    And _Virgin's Bower_ trailing airily,\r\n    With others of the sisterhood.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, our order comprises the _Hepatica_, with its blue or\r\npink blossoms and three-lobed leaves, which, from their fancied\r\nresemblance to the form of the liver, procured the plant its English\r\nname of liverwort; the _Flos Adonis_, or pheasant's eye,--the\r\n_goutte-de-sang_ of the French,--so called because the ancients\r\nfabled that it sprang from the blood of Adonis, when wounded by the\r\nbear; the marsh marigold; the gay and vivacious larkspur; the deadly\r\nwolfsbane, or aconite, which secretes so potent a poison; and the\r\naromatic love-in-a-mist, or French flower.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n_B._--ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nUnder the soft moss, under the stones, in all localities where\r\nmouldiness is easily developed, under the closed doors of cellars,\r\nyou must certainly have more than once observed a tiny creature of\r\nthe form of a horse-bean, of a gray leaden colour, and supplied with\r\na considerable number of feet. This last characteristic will induce\r\nyou immediately to abandon the idea that you have before you an\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nCatch hold of it, and count its feet.\r\n\r\nWell said; but it runs much more quickly than I would have suspected\r\nfrom its previously dilatory movements.\r\n\r\nBecause it knows that danger threatens it, instinct impels it to\r\nescape at its utmost speed. Do not be afraid to handle it; the poor\r\ncreature can do you no harm.\r\n\r\nUnable to escape, it counterfeits death, and remains perfectly\r\nimmovable.\r\n\r\nNow examine it. It has fourteen feet, symmetrically arranged in\r\ncouples; their size perceptibly increases from the first to the last.\r\nWhen the animal is at rest, they are coiled inside, so as to form an\r\nangle whose opening faces the medial line. But here is something much\r\nmore curious; its body, which does not possess the vestige of a wing,\r\nis also without those segments which would divide it visibly, as in\r\nthe case of insects, into head, thorax, and abdomen; but is composed\r\nof rings, hard and scaly, like those of a shrimp.\r\n\r\nCan it be a crustacean?\r\n\r\nYes; the animal you hold in your hand, and which everybody knew\r\nby the name of wood-louse long before our naturalists knew how\r\nto classify it, belongs to the great animal division of the\r\n_Articulata_, which, instead of having their skeleton _inside_ the\r\nbody, like the Vertebrates, have it externally. The Crustacea form\r\na class of this division, to which also belong the Insects, the\r\nArachnida, and the Myriapoda.\r\n\r\nLet us continue to anatomise our crustacean.\r\n\r\nIn front of its first ring (a transversal segment) you see a little\r\nblack head, with two lateral bead-like eyes, and a couple of antennæ.\r\nThe latter are each composed of three joints, which are extremely\r\nmobile; their base is covered by the edges of the sloping head. The\r\nmost conspicuous rings of the body are seven in number; their lateral\r\nborders are pointed in front, and rounded behind. But, if you look\r\nclosely, you will see some other rings, a little less projecting\r\nthan the former; they circumscribe the abdominal region, the belly,\r\nproperly so called, in which the intestines are lodged. These rings,\r\nor abdominal segments, are six in number; but they have not all the\r\nsame form. The one which occupies the tail is triangular, pointed,\r\nand surrounded by four (caudal) appendages. The three next segments,\r\ncounting from the front to the rear, are prolonged laterally in\r\na very marked manner; the two anterior, on the contrary, have no\r\nsuch distinction. As for the caudal appendages, the two outer ones\r\nare very strong, conical, and composed of two articulations, while\r\nthe inner, situated above the former, are frail, cylindrical, and\r\nterminated by a tuft of hairs, whence issues a viscous liquid. (See\r\nFig. 35, _a_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. The Wood-Louse.]\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of these characteristics is tedious, but necessary\r\nfor the determination of the genus and the species. They belong\r\nto the _Oniscus asellus_, or common wood-louse. But why, you ask,\r\nwhy such a strange conjunction of names,--one Greek, ὀνίσκος, the\r\nother Latin, _asellus_? Both carry the same meaning: why not, then,\r\nhave called our tiny crustacean an ass-ass (if such a compound be\r\npossible)? Why, neither close at hand nor at a distance, has it\r\nthe slightest resemblance to an ass; and to say that we have only\r\nborrowed these names from the ancients, is neither an explanation nor\r\na justification.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet done with the wood-lice. Are these interesting\r\nlittle creatures (they _are_ interesting, are they not?) oviparous\r\nor viviparous? I defy you to show me anywhere a single wood-louse's\r\negg. Have the patience to observe our crustaceans more nearly. Among\r\nthe crowd, you will remark some--they are the females--with a kind\r\nof membraneous pouch underneath the body, stretching from the head\r\nto the fifth pair of legs. The pellicle which forms this pouch is so\r\nthin, and so transparent, that you can distinguish the eggs within\r\nit. These eggs, instead of being expelled for incubation, remain\r\nin the mother's pouch until they are hatched. At that felicitous\r\nmoment, the membranous bag splits cross-wise, longitudinally and\r\ntransversally, to permit the emergence of the young wood-lice. The\r\nlatter are extremely small, and in form resemble nothing in the world\r\nso much as a little white line (Fig. 35, _b_). They differ from\r\ntheir parents only in having one pair of feet, and one ring less\r\nthan they have. They undergo no metamorphoses. After their birth,\r\nthe little ones, which have proportionally very large antennæ, do\r\nnot immediately separate from their mother. By a wonderful act of\r\nforethought on the part of Nature,[56] they keep themselves concealed\r\nin the middle of the respiratory _laminæ_, which garnish the under\r\npart of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe specific characters of the _Oniscus asellus_ are tolerably\r\nwell defined. By its rings of dark gray, a little lighter at the\r\nedges, which form for it an articulated, glossy carapace, marked\r\nwith white spots, longitudinally arranged; by the uniform pale gray\r\ncolour of its belly and its legs, covered with scattered hairs;\r\nand, particularly, by its habits, our wood-louse, which the Germans\r\ncall cellar-louse (_Kellerlaus_), is distinguished from its kindred\r\nspecies, of which naturalists have made distinct genera. Thus, the\r\n_asellus_ found generally under stones, which counterfeits death by\r\nrolling itself up in a ball like a hedgehog, and will rather suffer\r\nitself to be crushed than unfold, is the _Oniscus armadillo_, which\r\nsome naturalists transform into the _Armadillo vulgaris_. (See Fig.\r\n36.) This species prefers the solitude of the field to inhabited\r\nplaces. Its body is considerably expanded, and its rings do not\r\nterminate in a point on their lateral and posterior edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. _Oniscus armadillo._]\r\n\r\nAnother species, equally common underneath stones, has its head and\r\ntail covered over with granulations; its antennæ are composed of\r\nseven joints, of which the fourth and fifth are perceptibly situated\r\nlengthwise. This is the _Oniscus granulatus_ of some entomologists;\r\nothers have designated it the _Porcellio scaber_. Why not simplify\r\nthe study of species?\r\n\r\nThe wood-lice seem to live upon decomposed vegetable matter. But in\r\ndefault of other food, they devour their own kind; in this respect\r\nresembling beings who are supposed to rank much higher in the animal\r\nhierarchy.\r\n\r\nIn the pharmacopœia of the ancients our wood-lice found a place.\r\nReduced into powder, and mixed with various substances, they were\r\nprescribed as diuretic and aperient; but they were long ago abandoned\r\nin medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRAGON-FLIES (_Libellulæ_).\r\n\r\nIn walking along the banks of a river, you must frequently have seen\r\nhovering around you a cloud of insects, whom you would readily take\r\nto be butterflies, were not you arrested in your conjecture by the\r\nlargeness of their head, the length of their body, the form of their\r\nvivid, diaphanous, gauze-like wings, and, generally,--which will most\r\nastonish you,--by their carnivorous instincts. You have about you and\r\nbefore, then, not butterflies, but Dragon-flies--the _Libellulæ_ of\r\nnaturalists. They are the _demoiselles_, or \"ladies,\" of the French;\r\nso called, perhaps, in allusion to their airy and graceful flight.\r\n\r\nAmong these Libellulæ, one is called _Eleanora_. If she does\r\nnot shine so brightly as the others--if her colours are less\r\nbrilliant--she has, at least, the advantage of being so common that\r\nyou can easily obtain a specimen.\r\n\r\nBut, first, let us pause to think of the strange dissimilarity in\r\nthe names bestowed on the _Libellulæ_ by the English and French\r\nrespectively. They are the _Dragon-flies_ of the former,--fierce,\r\nrapacious, formidable; the _Ladies_ of the latter,--elegant, light,\r\nand radiant. Here we have a glimpse of national character. With the\r\nFrenchman, \"appearance\" counts for so much; with the Englishman,\r\neverything depends upon the \"reality.\" Yet our English poets can\r\nappreciate their gay exterior. Moore speaks of them as--\r\n\r\n    \"Those bright things which have their dwelling\r\n    Where the little streams are welling!\"\r\nPoor Clare, the Northamptonshire poet, correctly studied--\r\n\r\n    \"The great dragon-fly with gauzy wings,\r\n    In gilded coat of purple, green, and brown,\r\n    That on broad leaves of hazel basking clings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Mary Howitt has seen them--\r\n\r\n    \"Here and there they dart,\r\n    And flush like gleams of green and azure light.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--The Common Dragon-fly.]\r\n\r\nBeautiful as they are, they must be ranked among Nature's fiercest\r\nand most insatiable destroyers. They are the terror of the insect\r\nworld. On this point we shall hereafter enlarge, but before I\r\nforget it, I would fain relate an anecdote, in illustration of\r\ntheir voracity, which I have read somewhere or other. A naturalist\r\nrecounts with what interest he has often watched the proceedings of\r\nthe dragon-fly. He has seen it, in a locality where white butterflies\r\nwere numerous, dart down as a hawk upon a quarry, seize with its legs\r\na firm hold of a butterfly, and carry it to a branch of an adjoining\r\ntree. In a moment one of the white wings would drop from the boughs,\r\nand then another would come wavering downwards, and so on, until all\r\nfour had fallen; and the dragon-fly, after a short pause, would again\r\ndart forth in pursuit of a fresh victim. He never launched himself on\r\nhis prey when on a perfect horizontal line with it; but took care to\r\nbe either somewhat higher, or somewhat lower, so that he could seize\r\nit with his feet.\r\n\r\nBut now let us consider by what characteristics the reader is to\r\nrecognise his Libellulæ.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are very large, the size of the insect considered; of a\r\nbrown colour, and nearly joined together at the top of the head; in\r\nfront of this point of junction a tiny vesicle is visible, carrying\r\nthree _ocelli_ (_i.e._, little, simple, glossy eyes), two on each\r\nside, and the third on the anterior margin: the thorax is large,\r\nhairy, and composed of two yellow plates; the abdomen laterally\r\ndepressed, in such a manner as to give great prominence to the medial\r\nline. This last and well-marked feature it is which has procured for\r\nthe Eleanora the scientific name of _Libellula depressa_,--a name\r\nproposed by Linnæus, and unanimously adopted; such unanimity being\r\na rare occurrence among naturalists, though, to parody a phrase of\r\nSheridan's, when naturalists _do_ agree, it is something wonderful!\r\n\r\nIn the male Libellulæ, the upper surface of the abdomen is bluish in\r\nhue, and covered as it were with an ashy dust, while in the female it\r\nis olive; in both sexes the first and last abdominal segment are of a\r\ndeeper shade than the other segments. The feet are black, and bristle\r\nall over with stiff hairs; the thighs are of a brownish red. The\r\ntwo pairs of wings, each strongly reticulated, present, towards the\r\nextremity of the upper border, a black rectangular spot; their base,\r\nmoreover, is edged with brown spots; the spots of the lower pair are\r\ntriangular and larger than those of the upper pair, which are nearly\r\nlinear. They form, to a certain extent, the reservoir of the liquid\r\nwhich nourishes and maintains the circulation of the network of the\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe Libellula, which Geoffroy calls (in his \"Histoire des Insectes\")\r\nthe _Philinta_, is simply the male of the species we have just been\r\ndescribing. You may see them\r\n\r\n    \"Where water-lilies mount their snowy buds,\"\r\n\r\npursuing one another with an abrupt, jerking--I had almost said\r\n_staccato_--flight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA species less common than the preceding, but closely resembling\r\nit, is the _Françoise_ of Geoffroy, the _Libellula quadrimaculata_\r\nof Linnæus. It owes its descriptive or specific designation to the\r\ncolours which diversify its wings. On the outer edge of each, two\r\nbrown marginal spots are conspicuous: the first at the place where\r\nin the Eleanora (and other species) the black spot is found, and the\r\nsecond nearly in the centre of the external border, which, at this\r\npoint, is considerably compressed; moreover, the lower wings are\r\nmarked, beneath their yellow base, with a kind of triangular spot of\r\nblackish brown, finely reticulated with yellow. Externally, there is\r\nno difference of appearance between male and female, except that the\r\nabdomen of the latter is somewhat the larger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow we come to the _Sylvia_, the _Libellula cancellata_ of Linnæus.\r\nIts eyes and thorax wear a greenish hue; the diaphanous wings are\r\nspotted with brown near the outer margin; the abdomen is of a\r\nbluish-gray; the extremity of the sixth segment, and the following\r\nsegments, are wholly black.\r\n\r\nThe _Julia_, or _Libellula grandis_ (Linn.), has been separated\r\nfrom the Libellulæ by the great entomologists, such as Fabricius\r\nand Latreille, and included in the genus _Aeshna_ (Phœbus, what a\r\nname!), preserving the descriptive adjective _grandis_. What are the\r\nreasons put forward to justify this separation? Principally, the\r\nform of the abdomen, and the position of those little smooth and\r\nsimple eyes, like tiny pearls or _pearlets_, which we call _ocelli_.\r\nIn the Libellulæ, properly so called, the ocelli, three in number,\r\nare situated on either side and on the exterior margin of a kind of\r\nsemi-triangular vesicle, and the abdomen is slightly depressed, and\r\nnot unlike a club; while in the _Aeshnæ_ the ocelli are placed on a\r\nsimple keel-shaped transversal embossment, and the abdomen is narrow,\r\nelongated, and almost cylindrical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Aeshna grandis_ (or the \"Julia\") is one of the largest of the\r\nBritish species. Its head is large, and its eyes are of a brown\r\ncolour shading into blue; the yellow thorax has two bright yellow\r\nbands or stripes obliquely painted on each side. The abdomen is of a\r\nreddish or even rusty brown; generally spotted with white and yellow\r\nat the top and bottom of each wing. This species haunts the vicinity\r\nof streams and \"silent pools.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come, in due order, to the _Aeshna forcipata_, or \"Carolina,\" with\r\nits dirty yellow head, and its greenish-yellow thorax, the latter\r\nmarked on each side with three oblique lines of black: the abdomen\r\nis black, and composed of segments laterally spotted with yellow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Libellula_, which the illustrious Geoffroy designates \"Louisa,\"\r\nis, according to modern entomologists, neither a _Libellula_ nor\r\na _Aeshna_, but a species of _Agarion_,--the _Agarion virgo_\r\n(_Libellula virgo_, Linn.) The Agarions are distinguishable from\r\nthe Libellula and the Aeshna by their remarkably thin, filiform,\r\nand exceedingly elongated abdomen, and by the three ocelli arranged\r\ntriangle-wise on the top of the head.\r\n\r\nThe \"Louisa\" (_Agarion virgo_) is by no means uncommon in England,\r\nand may be found along the upper course of the Thames, the Avon, and\r\nother rivers. It is easily recognised by its frail slender body,\r\nshining with metallic blue reflexes. There are numerous varieties,\r\ndistinguished by their varieties of \"light and shade.\" The spotless\r\ngreen-winged species is the \"Ulrica\" of Geoffroy. The two sexes are\r\nnot alike. In the centre of their delicately-reticulated wings the\r\nmales have a large bluish-brown spot, which is wanting in the females.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Male and Female of the _Agarion virgo_.]\r\n\r\nThe genera _Libellula_, _Aeshna_, and _Agarion_ compose the small\r\nfamily of the _Libellulites_--a family plainly and conspicuously\r\ncharacterised by the size of their head, and by the two pairs of\r\ndiaphanous wings of almost equal dimensions (the posterior pair is\r\na _little_ shorter than the anterior), which, while the animal is at\r\nrest, are kept horizontally extended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--\"A sunny pool, half-fringed with trees.\"]\r\n\r\nThese are the characteristics which present themselves to the\r\nobservant eye at the first glance. Do you doubt me? Betake yourself,\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n    \"The bird is building in the tree,\r\n    And the flower has opened to the bee,\"--\r\n\r\nbetake yourself, I say, to any sunny pool, half-fringed with trees,\r\nor pleasant river-margin; go, armed with net and microscope, and,\r\nhaving secured a specimen of these terrors of the insect world, where\r\n\r\n    \"The strong on weak, cunning on simple, prey,\"\r\n\r\ndevote yourself to its patient examination.\r\n\r\nIt is only such an examination that can reveal to us some equally\r\nimportant, but less obvious features of the insect. But to catch\r\na Dragon-fly is not always an easy task; the Libellulæ are very\r\ntimorous, or else they are suspicious of the prowling naturalist who\r\nseeks what he can entrap. Their flight is livelier and swifter than\r\neven that of the butterfly: when disturbed in their repose, they fly\r\naway abruptly, their wings rustling or crackling like a sheet of\r\nparchment; if obstinately pursued, they grow irritated, and in their\r\nquick jerking movements exhibit all the rage of the Carnivora.\r\n\r\nBut can our Libellulæ be carnivorous? Most undoubtedly. To convince\r\nyourself of it, you have but to glance at their mouth, which is\r\nwholly unlike a butterfly's. What an arsenal of weapons adapted for\r\nseizing and crushing a victim! How strong are those saw-toothed scaly\r\nmandibles! How strong their auxiliaries, the jaws, which terminate\r\nin that dentated spring projection, furnished internally with ciliæ!\r\nSurely, such instruments testify to their ferocious instincts,\r\nand should induce our French neighbours to deny them the graceful\r\nname of \"les demoiselles.\" What a libel on tender woman,--on man's\r\n\"ministering angel!\" Do but observe them. They do not rest upon the\r\nblossom to extract its nectared sweets; in truth, they could not\r\ndo so, for they are not furnished with a proboscis. Warlike as the\r\nAmazons,--the only portion of the female sex they can justly be said\r\nto resemble,--they hover in the air to pounce, like vultures, upon\r\nwhatever insects may come within their reach; they quickly transfix,\r\nand as quickly devour them. If they love to fly about the pools, the\r\nmarshes, and the streams, it is because they are sure of prey in\r\nthese localities. And, in fact, they there encounter and devour an\r\ninnumerable quantity of flies, moths, gnats, and the like.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there is another reason why the Dragon-flies, obeying the secret\r\nimpulse of nature, resort to the haunts we have been describing. They\r\nwere their cradles or nurseries, and they become, in due time, the\r\nscenes of their espousals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the singular metamorphosis they afterwards\r\naccomplish, we must touch lightly on the subject of the mode of\r\nreproduction of our brilliant _demoiselles_.\r\n\r\nIt is laid down as a law that, in the insect world, the males are\r\ninvariably smaller or weaker than the females. Yet this law does not\r\nhold good with reference to the Libellulæ, whose males are, on the\r\ncontrary, larger and stronger than their females. Man may lay down\r\nlaws, and extort obedience to them, within his own domain; but nature\r\nlaughs at human rules, and gives up her secrets only to the free\r\nthought, unshackled by the fetters of authority.\r\n\r\nBut why is the male Dragon-fly stronger than the female? Because\r\nthe former must make the first advances, and carry off his aërial\r\ncompanion to celebrate their bridal. For this purpose, he holds her\r\ntightly by the neck, and continues to fly in this way for some few\r\nminutes. At length, he perches himself on the branch of a willow, or\r\nthe leaf of an aquatic plant, along with his companion.\r\n\r\nThe eggs laid by the female are oblong in shape, and sometimes united\r\ntogether in clusters: the female deposits them in the water, or on\r\nsome water-floated leaf plant, shortly after their fecundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHOSIS OF THE DRAGON-FLY.\r\n\r\n    \"To-day I saw the Dragon-fly\r\n    Come from the wells where he did lie;\r\n    An inner impulse rent the veil\r\n    By his old husk: from head to tail\r\n    Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\r\n    He dried his wings: like gauze they grew,\r\n    Through croft and pasture wet with dew,\r\n    A living flash of light he flew.\"\r\n\r\n    --TENNYSON.\r\n\r\nIf in your walks abroad you should meet with a pool of turbid water,\r\ndo not object to linger for a moment on its brink. Nature, as a\r\nreward for your trouble, will gratify you with an extraordinary\r\nsurprise. Stir up the mud with a stick, or, better still, with your\r\nhand; and then, as the children say, you shall see--what you shall\r\nsee!\r\n\r\nOh, what an ugly creature is struggling in this handful of slime! It\r\nlooks like a large spider!\r\n\r\nNay, examine it more attentively; it can do you no harm.\r\n\r\nWell, it is a singular animal; greenish in colour, bristling with\r\nhairs, and covered with mud. It is not a spider, for it has only six\r\nlegs and these are exactly like the legs of insects. I can distinctly\r\nmake out three joints (articulations) to each tarsus, which\r\nterminates in a simple hook. The belly is formed of regular segments;\r\nis rounded above, and flat underneath. What do I see? On the top, and\r\nnearly in the middle, each ring is armed with a spine, so that the\r\nrow of spiny projections remind one of the back of a crocodile. Pray\r\ntell me, what is this curious creature?\r\n\r\nBefore I tell you, I would have you more thoroughly acquainted with\r\nit. Continue your examination.\r\n\r\nThe face has a strange expression; it looks--the insect, I mean--like\r\na masked knight. Its mask, formed of a scaly substance and thoroughly\r\ncompact, is composed of two pieces, which are separated from one\r\nanother by a transversal suture: the upper, which is broader than it\r\nis high, we may call the vizor; it consists of two lobes, soldered\r\ntogether longitudinally; the lower, which is higher than it is broad,\r\nwill be the chin-piece; it is triangular in shape, and its base rests\r\nagainst the vizor, while the summit is jointed or articulated with a\r\nsupport, which acts as a hinge when the mask is raised or lowered.\r\n\r\nThese movements, let me tell you, are voluntary; the animal raises\r\nits mask to arrest on their way the Infusoria and other animalcules\r\non which it feeds. For crushing them, it is provided with strong\r\nmandibles, which you can detect by lowering the mask with a pin, or\r\nthe point of a penknife. The eyes, which resemble little mammillary\r\nprotuberances, are situated above and outside of the vizor. On the\r\nanimal's back, where the belly joins the thorax, do you observe those\r\nfour little sheath-like or scabbard-like tongues? The extremity\r\nof the body, the tail, is marked by three conspicuous triangular\r\npoints, lying close to the opening, through which the water enters\r\nand issues, as if it were alternately sucked in and poured out by a\r\npiston. This, you must understand, is the respiratory apparatus. (See\r\nFig. 40.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Larva of the _Libellula depressa_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Larva of the _Agarion virgo_.]\r\n\r\nWell, then, what is the name of this most singular creature, this\r\nmasked knight?\r\n\r\nIt is the larva of the _Libellula depressa_; the dismal envelope\r\nwhence will issue the gaudy Dragon-fly. Listen to a graphic\r\ndescription of the mask you are looking at:--\r\n\r\n\"Conceive your under-lip to be horny instead of fleshy, and to be\r\nelongated perpendicularly downwards, so as to wrap over your chin\r\nand extend to its bottom; that this elongation is there expanded\r\ninto a triangular convex plate attached to it by a joint, so as\r\nto bend upwards again and fold over the face as high as the nose,\r\nconcealing not only the chin and the first-mentioned elongation, but\r\nthe mouth and part of the cheeks; conceive, moreover, that to the\r\nend of this last-mentioned plate are fixed two other convex ones,\r\nso broad as to cover the nose and temples; that these can open at\r\npleasure transversely, like a pair of jaws, so as to expose the\r\nnose and mouth, and that their inner edges, where they meet, are\r\ncut into numerous short teeth, or spines, or armed with one or more\r\nsharp claws;--you will then have as accurate an idea as any powers of\r\ndescription can give you of the strange conformation of the under-lip\r\nof the larva of those insects, which conceals the mouth and face\r\nprecisely as I have supposed a similar construction of _your_ lip\r\nwould do yours. When at rest, this mask applies closely to and covers\r\nthe face; when they would make use of it, they unfold it like an\r\narm, catch the prey at which they aim by means of the mandibuliform\r\nplates, and then partly refold it, so as to hold the prey to the\r\nmouth in the most convenient position for the operation of the two\r\npairs of jaws with which they are provided.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the creature I have been examining is only a larva! How\r\nstrange to compare it,--thick, ugly, unwieldy,--with the insect that\r\nissues from it, so aërial, so graceful, so light, so beautiful! The\r\nmore I think of the contrast, the more it interests me.\r\n\r\nThis larva, however, has all the characteristics of a perfect insect,\r\nand I will wager that more than one observer has described it as\r\nsuch, and classified it among aquatic insects. Yet it is but a larva!\r\nAnd each species has its own special larva (see Figs. 40 and 41).\r\n\r\nThis seems to me as difficult to believe as if you told me that John,\r\nJames, Peter,--in fact, all men,--were only temporary bodies from\r\nwhich more perfect beings would one day emerge. For the medium in\r\nwhich these masked creatures live,--the troubled and muddy medium for\r\nwhich they are adapted by their organisation, and in which they seem\r\ndestined to live out their life,--differs wholly and absolutely from\r\nthe aërial medium wherein, you tell me, they will one day rejoice.\r\n\r\nDo you see, on the brink of the pond, those dried-up bodies? They are\r\nthose of your aquatic insects, the mortal remains of Libellulites;\r\nthey have rent open their vest, as you would do a garment which had\r\nbecome too narrow; the rent is very conspicuous along the back;\r\nand through the fissure issue the winged and aërial resuscitated\r\nDragon-flies, summoned to live in a world differing so widely from\r\ntheir former one! Under the tongues were folded up the wings, and the\r\nmask that puzzled you so greatly is split open on the level of the\r\nsutures, so as to represent a ⟙, wanting only a handle to reproduce\r\none of those hieroglyphics (☥) which are found so frequently on the\r\nEgyptian monuments, and which, according to some Egyptologists,\r\nsignify _eternal life_.\r\n\r\nAnd here, my friend and companion, we may take leave of\r\n\r\n    \"The great Dragon-fly with gauzy wings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The best means of ascertaining the coexistence of an\r\nascending and descending sap have been indicated in \"The Circle of\r\nthe Year,\" pp. 163-8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: See the _Botanische Zeitung_ (\"Botanical Gazette\") for\r\nthe years 1853, 1856, 1859, and 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Boehm, \"Sur la Cause de l'Ascension de la Séve,\"\r\nMémoire communiqué à l'Académie des Sciences de Vienne, juillet 1863.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Chaucer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Pliny, \"Historia Naturalis,\" xxvi. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See \"The Circle of the Year.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Chomel, \"Histoire des Plantes Usuelles,\" ii. 282.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Tournefort, \"Histoire des Plantes,\" i. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: Garidel, \"Histoire des plantes qui naissent aux\r\nenvirons d'Aix,\" p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: \"Pied,\" that is, vari-coloured, motley-coated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See also Shelley's \"Sensitive Plant,\" &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: This is common enough in Germany and France, especially\r\nin the vineyards, but very rare in England.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: So we say, \"fretted roof.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: When the spike bears numerous flowers, surrounded by a\r\nspathe, or sheathing bract, it is called a spadix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Bosc, a distinguished naturalist, died in 1828, aged\r\n69.

It\r\nis impossible to explain _them_ unless we contemplate _it_ on high,\r\nrelegating our planet into the great chorus of the worlds, where it\r\nholds but a modest rank. Only, to perform this miracle, we must for\r\na moment repress in ourselves the senses which deceive us by their\r\nexaggeration or appearances, and give free course to enlightened\r\nthought. It is by this means alone that we can succeed in fully\r\ndemonstrating the close and perpetual relationship which exists\r\nbetween our planet and the other spheres composing what we call the\r\nSolar System.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPermit us here a parenthesis, or, shall we say, a digression?\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of science, the whole secret of human knowledge--in\r\ntruth, the whole future of humanity--lies in these two\r\nwords--_Enlightened Thought_.\r\n\r\nAnd here, gentle reader, I solicit your assistance in endeavouring\r\nto elucidate a question which has a for a long time puzzled me. Why\r\ndo we apply the word \"light\" to that which sets in motion the eye\r\nof the body, and to that which induces the operation of the eye\r\nof the mind,--to the singularly mysterious physical agent without\r\nwhose intervention all the external world would be to man a dream or\r\na void, as well as to the still more mysterious moral agent which\r\nilluminates the world within?\r\n\r\nI anticipate your answer. \"The light,\" you say, \"which opens up to me\r\nthe material world is a reality; the other is only an image.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is true that this is the solution which first presents itself\r\nto the mind. But the longer you reflect upon it, the more you will\r\nbe inclined to agree with me that it is unsatisfactory. What,\r\nthen, means this agreement among all peoples, past and present, to\r\ndesignate by the same words--as\r\n\r\n    Light             To illuminate\r\n    Obscurity         To obscure\r\n    Shadow            To overshadow\r\n    Morning           To darken\r\n    Day               To clear away\r\n    Twilight          To blind\r\n    Gloom             To cloud\r\n\r\n--those actions, processes, or operations which take place or are\r\nproduced in the outer world, physical or material, and in the inner\r\nworld, intellectual or moral.\r\n\r\nWere your pretended \"image\" the result of purely personal\r\nimpressions,--all persons are not equally apt in apprehending those\r\nfictitious relations which are the food of poetry,--were it, in\r\na word, no more than an individual conception, and, therefore,\r\neminently variable, I should not hesitate to accept your opinion: we\r\nshould simply be discussing what are called, in scholastic language,\r\nthe individual sense (_sens propre_) and the imaginative sense (_sens\r\nfiguré_). But there exists upon this point an unanimous and universal\r\nagreement: all languages, living or dead, attest it; it embraces the\r\naggregate of the members of the human family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the _first_ point which induces me to doubt the legitimacy\r\nof the proposed explanation. But I am confirmed in my hesitation by\r\nnumerous other facts.\r\n\r\nLet us emerge from the domain of rhetoric to enter that of\r\nexperimental physiology and psychology. Too powerful a light\r\nblinds the organs of seeing. No mortal eye, unless with the aid of\r\nartificial appliances, can gaze upon the sun, the great source of\r\nlight. If the vision is to act clearly, we must proceed step by\r\nstep. If from a very light apartment we pass rapidly, and without\r\ntransition, into a darkened room, or _vice versâ_, we feel\r\ntemporarily blinded: the eye demands a short time to recover, as\r\nit were, from its astonishment. If we fix our gaze for one or two\r\nminutes on a star of the first magnitude, as, for example, Sirius,\r\nand afterwards turn away abruptly, the eye will for a while remain\r\ninsensible to stars of a less intense splendour.\r\n\r\nThese are incontestable physiological facts, which anybody may easily\r\nverify for himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, in the psychological order facts exist which are in all\r\nrespects analogous. Take one of those truths which the human thought,\r\nlabouring generation after generation, has taken centuries to\r\ndiscover or elucidate; place it suddenly before an unprepared mind;\r\nhowever luminous may be this truth, it will be simply shadow and\r\ndarkness to the mind we speak of; it will not comprehend an iota\r\nof it. Why? For the very obvious reason that it lies outside its\r\nsphere of ideas, in every respect comparable to the sphere of vision,\r\nbeyond which and within which there is no more room for the sensorial\r\nimpressions. There, as here, we must proceed gradually, and arrange\r\nthe transitions so as to produce the desired results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be easy for me to develop this parallel by other and still\r\nmore remarkable facts; but what I have just said will suffice to\r\nshow that the line of demarcation which philosophers have, upon\r\nprinciple, desired to trace between the physical and moral order,\r\nhas turned the mind aside from many fertile fields of research and\r\nspeculation. Let us cite an example. The sun is the visible centre\r\nof light, heat, organic life; in fine, of all the movements of our\r\nmaterial world. Yet it is but a relative focus, since the sun, with\r\nits planetary train, revolves, probably, in company with other suns\r\nor systems, around a centre as yet unknown; and as there is no reason\r\nwhy we should pause in this cycloidal progression, this second centre\r\nor focus of systems may revolve around a third, the third around\r\na fourth, and so on. Thus we shall have an indeterminate series\r\nof relative centres; for the term does not exist of which we can\r\nsay,--there is the beginning, or here is the end of the series.\r\n\r\nWe do not meet with the absolute in the material, any more than in\r\nthe intellectual world. Truth, by its power of attraction, sets in\r\nmotion all the wheels of our understanding; we seek after it eagerly,\r\nin the doubt which torments us, in the obscurity which surrounds us;\r\nwe all feel the need of being enlightened by it, and warmed, and\r\nrevivified; we all are in need of belief, and, at the same time, of\r\npossessing--let there be no illusion in this respect--a certainty or\r\ndemonstration of what we believe.\r\n\r\nBut the truth which we think our own does not leave the mind at rest;\r\na slight effort suffices, in fact, to teach us that the truth we\r\naccept depends upon another and remoter truth, and that the world\r\nof thought is thus carried onward in an interminable series of\r\nrelative truths; unless we find it more convenient to pause here at a\r\nprimary cause, as elsewhere at a primordial centre, which we may ever\r\nidentify with the primary cause. But is this truth, supposed to be\r\nfinal, capable of satisfying equally every mind? With this question,\r\ndear reader, I close my parenthesis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo understand clearly the variable duration of the day at all points\r\nof the terrestrial surface, let us so place ourselves as to see our\r\nplanet distinctly in front. I need hardly say that this invitation is\r\nnot addressed to the visual organs of the body, but to the \"mind's\r\neye, Horatio.\" With the former, fixed as we are on the surface of\r\nthe globe, we can only see the shadows of objects standing out in\r\nrelief upon it, and still, with the sun at our back, can perceive\r\nbut a comparatively insignificant portion. With the second, on the\r\ncontrary, we may detach ourselves from the earth, may mount afar\r\ninto space, may plant ourselves on some aërial height, whence we may\r\nembrace, at a single glance, all the illuminated hemisphere of our\r\nglobe: we shall have but a single shadow on the prospect,--that which\r\nour brightened planet casts behind it, and which, in four-and-twenty\r\nhours, traverses the entire surface of the globe, producing light\r\nwherever it passes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving completed our preparations, let us note what we perceive with\r\nour eye thus disjoined from our body,--an eye equally well adapted to\r\nfix every moving object, and to see at any distance bodies extremely\r\nsmall, or bodies extremely large. What a marvellous eye! And it is\r\nfor us to develop its power, and freely to increase its range. What\r\nan arduous task!\r\n\r\nThe luminous envelope, the photosphere of the sun, simultaneously\r\ndarts its rays in all directions, with an intensity which diminishes\r\nwith the square of the distance.\r\n\r\nLet us follow those which direct their course towards our planet.\r\n\r\nSo long as the rays do not come into collision, or strike against\r\nresistant matter, they neither warm nor enlighten. Confirming the\r\nNewtonian hypothesis of emission, they travel straight as arrows\r\nthrough the icy space, the shadowy ocean in which the waves of the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere are lost. But the moment they encounter a\r\nmaterial obstacle, the rays partly penetrate it, and are partly\r\nthrown back, in such a manner as to form a series of undulations like\r\nthose which the falling of a stone into a pond produces. As they\r\nrecede from these repeated shocks, the rays come under that theory of\r\nundulation which Huygens promoted.[57]\r\n\r\nLet us trace the rays of light back to their origin. These encounter\r\nfirst the globes nearest to the sun: the almost imperceptible\r\nasteroids, which, on account of the solar splendour, can scarcely be\r\ndetected, and which, as yet, have received no baptismal names. Yonder\r\nbeams illuminate other revolving globes,--Mercury, Venus, the Earth.\r\nIf we here arrest our gaze, we are influenced by a vague and mournful\r\nrecollection; the Earth was our place of sojourn at an epoch when\r\nthought, formerly shackled, had become free. It is thus that a seed,\r\nremoved from the stem which nourished it, wanders afar to diffuse\r\nand perfect its species. Our planet, of an ochreous yellow, relieved\r\nwith green and white, possesses no special privileges; it shares in\r\nthe ponderated movements of the spheres; it is neither the largest,\r\nnor the smallest, nor the heaviest, nor the lightest, nor the nearest\r\nto, nor the farthest from, the sun. And shall Earth alone, of all the\r\nplanets, nourish that kind of \"thinking seed\" which we name the human\r\nrace? It seems improbable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the great orb of light. It illuminates exactly\r\none half of our earth; the other half lies in shade. And as the earth\r\nrotates upon its own axis, every point of its surface is necessarily\r\nexposed to the action of the solar rays. This action varies in\r\nduration and intensity.\r\n\r\nAll this I was taught, when I was still at school on our revolving\r\nplanet. I remember, too, as a lesson learned by heart, that, under\r\nthe Equator, or, more exactly, in 0° 0´ latitude, as well as at\r\nthe Poles, or under 90° latitude; the duration of the day is equal\r\nto that of the night, with this difference, that, while under the\r\nEquator, a day of twelve hours alternates invariably with a night\r\nof the same duration, at the Poles a day of six months succeeds\r\ncontinually to a night of six months. I also recollect that, at\r\na given moment, namely, at the spring and autumn equinoxes, the\r\nduration of the day, over all the terrestrial surface, is equal to\r\nthat of the night, just as under the Equator; and that, after these\r\ntwo epochs, under the intermediary latitudes, between the Equator\r\nand the Poles, the length of the days and their corresponding nights\r\nvaries according to the seasons; that, in our northern hemisphere,\r\nafter the spring equinox, the days increase while the nights\r\ndiminish, to such an extent that, at the summer solstice,--21-22\r\nJune,--they attain their _maximum_ of length (and the nights their\r\n_minimum_), the reverse taking place during the period that elapses\r\nbetween the autumn equinox and the winter solstice.\r\n\r\nI remember that I learned these data when I was living rooted to or\r\nanchored upon the earth; but the explanation which my masters gave\r\nme was not so clear as I could have wished. Their considerations on\r\nthe declensions of the sun, on the obliquity of the ecliptic, on the\r\nnecessity of exactly reducing the earth to a simple point in relation\r\nto the distance of the stars, to the end that the phenomena occurring\r\n(_rapportés_) on parallel planes would be nearly identical with those\r\nobserved from the centre of the globe, or from a point situated on\r\nits surface; all these fine things, which demanded a certain faculty\r\nof geometrical intuition, left a curious vagueness of idea upon my\r\nmind. I accepted them, under the influence of authority, as beyond\r\ndiscussion, but I was by no means satisfied whenever I wished to\r\nascertain their foundation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut now--in the regions of space--everything grows simple before the\r\nmind, in which, apparently, all my power of thought is concentrated.\r\n\r\nBehold the illuminated atmosphere; it reminds me vividly of the\r\ndisc of the full moon. Ah, what exquisite iris colours! They mark\r\nthe meeting-points of the bright with the obscured hemisphere: a\r\ncircular line carried through all these points would exactly separate\r\nday and night. On the one side, motion and life and glow; on the\r\nother, silence and shade and calm. This line _moves_, carrying\r\nwith it in its movement day and night, the illuminated and the\r\ndarkened hemisphere; it moves from east to west, so that the bright\r\nhemisphere and the shadowy one, whose union forms what may be called\r\nthe _photo-adumbrated_ sphere, revolves, in four-and-twenty hours,\r\nround an axis which coincides at this moment--the 21st day of March,\r\naccording to the \"terrestrial worms,\"--with the axis of the earth\r\nrotating on itself in an inverse direction, that is to say, from west\r\nto east. Let us note this coincidence: it is remarkable; inasmuch\r\nas, at the equinoxes, the terrestrial equator divides exactly the\r\nilluminated and the obscured hemisphere into two equal parts, one of\r\nwhich is situated to the north, the other to the south, and their\r\nline of separation coincides with a meridian circle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I see another, and much slower movement, very clearly defined.\r\nThe axis of rotation of the _photo-adumbrated sphere_ does not remain\r\nparallel with the terrestrial axis of rotation; it retires from it\r\nlittle by little, so as to form with it an angle which attains its\r\nmaximum at the summer solstice (21-22 June); afterwards, returning\r\nupon itself, it coincides anew with the terrestrial axis of rotation\r\n(the autumn equinox), to make an angle in the contrary direction,\r\nwhose maximum, of the same value as the former, corresponds to the\r\nwinter solstice (21-22 December). This movement, which is annual,\r\ncomplicates itself with the diurnal. It is rendered visible by\r\nthe displacement of the polar shroud of snow: the portion which,\r\nat the moment of the spring equinox, belonged, in the northern\r\nhemisphere, to the obscured hemisphere, moves onward, as a result\r\nof the inclination of its axis, to become an integral part of the\r\nilluminated hemisphere; while, at the same time, the portion which,\r\nin the southern hemisphere, belonged to the illuminated hemisphere,\r\nmoves onward to become an integral part of the darkened hemisphere.\r\nOwing to this displacement, the sun shows itself for six consecutive\r\nmonths above the horizon, for the North Pole; at the spring equinox\r\nit begins to rise, at the summer solstice it attains its maximum\r\nelevation, and from the summer solstice it begins to decline. Thus,\r\nthen, we have in reality _a day six months long_, of which the\r\nmorning and the evening are the two equinoxes, its noon the summer\r\nsolstice.\r\n\r\nIn the same periods an exactly opposite order of things prevails in\r\nthe southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nEverything, even to the minutest detail, is in this way very clearly\r\nexplained. Two facts--like the touches of a painter's brush--suffice\r\nto impress the whole upon the mind, namely:--\r\n\r\n      That, first, one half of the terrestrial surface is constantly\r\n      illuminated by the sun, while the other half remains in darkness;\r\n\r\n      That, secondly, the rotation of the earth upon its axis produces\r\n      day and night, by carrying from east to west the illuminated\r\n      hemisphere, always diametrically opposite to the darkened\r\n      hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis being thoroughly understood, let us place ourselves in the\r\nequatorial plane, so as to embrace at a single glance a quarter of\r\nthe illuminated and a quarter of the darkened hemisphere. If the\r\nequator of the photo-adumbrated sphere perpetually coincided with the\r\nterrestrial equator,--if, in other words, the earth, in revolving\r\nround the sun, invariably occupied the plane of the Equator, which,\r\nwhen prolonged, would pass through the centre of the illuminating\r\norb,--the diurnal rotation would not cease to divide equally the\r\nlight and the darkness over the earth's surface, as is shown in Fig.\r\n42 _a_, where S indicates the sun, EE the terrestrial equator, and\r\nN S the extremities (or North and South Poles) of the axis which\r\ndivides the globe into an illuminated and a darkened half. This\r\nphenomenon of coincidence exists; but only for a very brief period,\r\nand is only repeated twice a year,--that is, at the equinoxes. At\r\nall other times, the equator of the photo-adumbrated sphere, in\r\nwhose plane the orb of light is situated, passes sometimes above and\r\nsometimes below the terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--S, the Sun; EE, the Equator; N, North Pole;\r\nS, South Pole.]\r\n\r\nBut this alternate movement of northern and southern declination has\r\nits limits; it stops at 23° 27' 30\" on either side of the Equator;\r\nthis, too, is the maximum of the distance which the imaginary axis\r\nof the photo-adumbrated sphere retires from the axis of terrestrial\r\nrotation; it is at the same time the value of the obliquity of the\r\necliptic, or of the inclined plane which the earth traverses in its\r\nannual movement of revolution.\r\n\r\nFig. 42 _b_, which represents the photo-adumbrated sphere at the\r\nsummer solstice, will enable the reader to comprehend with the utmost\r\nfacility the six months' day of the North Pole, coinciding with the\r\nsix months' night of the South Pole; for the triangle N C D indicates\r\nthe amount by which the illuminated moiety increases in the northern\r\nhemisphere between the spring equinox and the summer solstice, the\r\namount being equal to that by which the adumbrated moiety overspreads\r\nin a contrary direction the South Pole in the southern hemisphere.\r\nThe superfluous quantity of the photo-adumbrated sphere is _nil_ at\r\nthe apex of the two opposite triangles, or in the equinoctial region.\r\nAnd then, in effect, both day and night are always twelve hours\r\nlong. Starting from the equinoctial line, we see how easy it is to\r\ncalculate for each locality the variable dimensions of the arc which\r\nthe sun, in its apparent course, traces above the horizon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo see very distinctly the portion of the illuminated hemisphere,\r\nwhich, passing beyond the North Pole, forms a luminous course on\r\nthe darkened moiety of our globe, I have but to place myself at\r\nmidnight, on the 21st of June, in the prolongation of the terrestrial\r\nequator; in the same way, to see the corresponding portion of the\r\ndarkened hemisphere, which advances beyond the South Pole to invade\r\nthe illuminated, I have but to occupy at noon, on the 21st of June, a\r\npoint of the same equatorial prolongation. Six months later, the same\r\nspectacle will be presented, inversely, on the 21st of December, in\r\nthe southern hemisphere. See Fig. 43 _a_, where the pole N indicates\r\nthe six months' day of the northern hemisphere (from the spring to\r\nthe autumn equinox); while in Fig. 43 _b_, the pole S indicates the\r\nsix months' night of the northern hemisphere (during the same period).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--The Six Months' Day and Night.]\r\n\r\nNow, no effort of the imagination is required to understand why the\r\ninhabitants of the northern hemisphere enjoy summer while those of\r\nthe southern are enduring winter; why it is \"blossoming spring\"\r\nto the former when it is \"purple autumn\" to the latter, and _vice\r\nversâ_. Equally easy is it to comprehend why, after the equinox,\r\n_day_, or the duration of the sun above the horizon, gradually\r\ndiminishes in one hemisphere and increases in the other; why, in\r\nsummer, and in both hemispheres, the longest days alternate with the\r\nshortest nights, and in winter, the longest nights with the shortest\r\ndays. It will not be more difficult to explain the cause of the\r\nprevailing cold in the polar zones, despite the prolonged sojourn of\r\nthe sun above the horizon for a great part of the year. Observe how\r\nobliquely the solar rays are directed towards yonder shrouds of ice\r\nand snow: how can they warm them? They nearly all vanish into space.\r\n(See Fig. 42.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFinally, there is not a phenomenon, even to that of dawn and\r\ntwilight, which cannot, on these principles, be very fully and\r\nclearly explained. I have indicated, in a preceding paragraph, the\r\nrainbow-glories of colour noticeable on the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the illuminated and the darkened hemispheres. They are\r\nwanting where the rays of light strike vertically or nearly\r\nvertically. It is this circumstance which explains why, in the\r\nintertropical regions, the crepuscular phenomena are nearly null; why\r\nthe sun, so to speak, sets and rises abruptly, like a taper which\r\nwe extinguish or rekindle. These iris-gleams increase, on the other\r\nhand, in intensity, in proportion as we recede from tropical regions:\r\nthe red touches the horizon, while the violet blends with the azure\r\nof the sky; between these two extremes, which are always very clearly\r\nmarked, are arranged in less perceptible fashion, and in the order of\r\nrefraction, the other colours of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat time and labour does it not require for the mind to disengage,\r\nto free itself from the fetters and incumbrances of sensorial\r\nappearances, the illusions of the senses, and to rise sufficiently\r\nhigh to seize at a glance all the dynamics of the world!\r\n\r\nIt is this faculty, however, which distinguishes the intellect from\r\nthe imagination.\r\n\r\nThat he may abandon himself to the enjoyment of those pleasures\r\nwhich, like Dead Sea apples, crumble to ashes on his lips, the\r\nfool puts aside all mental toil, and disregards the shortness of\r\nhis time,--ignores the brief period allowed for the development\r\nof the understanding. But, at least, let Imagination abstain\r\nfrom substituting its idle dreams for the assured results which\r\ncan be only the reward of reason, conscientiousness, and labour!\r\nUnfortunately, here as elsewhere, it is _vox clamantis_, and we\r\npreach in the desert!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: No one, I think, has ever before attempted to\r\nreconcile, in this way, the two principal theories which have been\r\nput forth on the propagation of light.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_WHAT MAY BE SEEN ON THE EARTH._\r\n\r\n                  \"Now the shining meads\r\n    Do boast the pansy, lily, and the rose,\r\n    And every flower doth laugh as zephyr blows.\"\r\n\r\n    --BEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Flower seems to have been created expressly to say to\r\nmen:--\"Listen! Those things which most attract your glance are but\r\nsubordinate, and the principal escape you.\"\r\n\r\nThat the warning is true, all history attests. It is only, so to\r\nspeak, from yesterday that the discovery of the sex of plants is to\r\nbe dated; the tiny organs occupying the centre of the flower having\r\nalways appeared so insignificant that they had passed, for some\r\nthousands of years, completely unnoticed. The eye of the spectator\r\nwas caught by the calyx and the corolla; these envelopes, though of\r\nsecondary importance so far as the reproduction of the vegetable is\r\nconcerned, seemed to eyes dazzled by their glowing colours the true\r\nflower,--in fact, the _entire_ flower. Science, which is the slow\r\nelaboration of thought matured by the study of objects of no human\r\norigin, has completely swept aside this premature judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIANTH.\r\n\r\nWe have already, and more than once, employed the word _perianth_[58]\r\nto designate the calyx or corolla, whether taken separately or\r\ntogether. In the former case, the _perianth_ is _simple_; in the\r\nlatter, it is _double_. A more appropriate word could not be made use\r\nof. It is derived from the Greek πεσὶ, around, and ἃνθος,\r\nflower; and literally signifies, \"floral envelope.\" Simple or double,\r\nthis envelope is the metamorphosis of several leaves, never of a\r\nsolitary one, inserted upon planes so closely brought together that\r\nthey seem confounded. Observe, in fact, how the leaves tend to efface\r\ntheir intervals on the blossom-bearing spray; they draw towards each\r\nother, they are apparently in eager haste to accomplish their destined\r\ntransformation. What eloquence there is in this simple language of\r\nnature!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Calyx._--The outermost whorl, or verticle, of the flower is\r\ncalled the _calyx_. And why? Out of a notion altogether incorrect.\r\nIt is true that this foliaceous envelope may often assume the shape\r\nof a cup (in Latin, _calix_), and hence that the name has about it a\r\nsemi-poetical air. But this only occurs when the calyx is composed of\r\na _single_ leaf, which has procured for it the special designations\r\nof _monosepalous_, _gamopetalous_, and _monophyllous_,--three\r\ndifferent words expressing one and the same thing! The violet and\r\nthe primrose are examples of a monophyllous, monosepalous, or\r\ngamopetalous calyx.\r\n\r\nI see, dear reader, that you are puzzled by the word _sepal_.\r\nCertainly you would look for it in vain in any classical dictionary;\r\nit is neither Greek nor Latin. It was only invented, scarce a century\r\nago, by a Swiss botanist, whose works have chiefly remained in\r\nmanuscript,--by Necker, brother of the celebrated minister of Louis\r\nXVI., and uncle of the illustrious Madame de Staël. Let me explain\r\nthe circumstance which determined, I suspect, the choice of this\r\nfanciful word,--a word belonging to no language but that of modern\r\nbotanists.\r\n\r\nThe botanists of antiquity called the coloured leaflets of the\r\ncorolla, _petals_. In this they were doubly right; for, first, they\r\nare, in reality, nothing but metamorphosed leaves; second, the word\r\n_petal_ (in Greek, πέταλον) signified \"a leaf\" as early as the days\r\nof Homer, who, when speaking of the nightingale, says, like a keen\r\nobserver of nature, that this bird, on the return of spring, sings--\r\n\r\n    \"Couched among the thick leaves of the grove.\"\r\n\r\n    (Δενδρέων ἐν πετάλοισι καθεζομένη\r\n       πυκινοῖσιν.)[59]\r\n\r\nThe word _petal_ was preserved by Tournefort, handed down by Linnæus\r\nand the two De Jussieus, and afterwards adopted by all botanists with\r\nthe signification given to it by the ancients. Now, as the calyx may\r\nalso consist of leaflets, which are generally green, Necker conceived\r\nthe idea of applying to them the same term, after substituting an\r\n_s_ for the initial letter _p_. Thus was created the word _sepal_.\r\nThe innovation, I must point out, was not unanimously adopted. Many\r\nbotanists continued to use the words \"calicinal leaflets,\" introduced\r\nby Linnæus; others, though they adopted the innovation, protested\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nBut leaving the _word_, let us return to the _thing_.\r\n\r\nThe calyx consists originally of several leaflets. Is the\r\nmonophyllous or monosepalous calyx a transformation due to the\r\njunction of the primitive leaflets? Observation replies in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of junctures or adhesions nature proceeds from\r\nbeneath to above. Our language proceeds inversely to nature: we speak\r\nof a lobed, dentated, or partite calyx, as if it were primarily\r\nmonophyllous, and its more or less profound divisions (indicated\r\nby the words \"lobed,\" \"dentated,\" \"partite\") were but consecutive\r\nresults, produced from above to below.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that the calicinal divisions, which we call _lobes_,\r\n_lacinias_, and the like, are but the tops of leaflets united\r\nat their base. The monophyllous calyx (formed of one piece) is,\r\ntherefore, simply the result of a more or less complete union of the\r\nleaflets composing, properly speaking, the calicinal whorl. This\r\nwhorl is originally _polyphyllous_; that is to say, formed of several\r\ndistinct parts. If it were, in the first place, _monophyllous_, it\r\nwould be impossible to understand how its divisions are made from top\r\nto bottom, since nature, in its developments, proceeds from bottom\r\nto top. In the final analysis, then, it is an error to consider the\r\ncalyx as a cup, primarily formed of a single piece.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrew, an English botanist of the eighteenth century, seems to have\r\nbeen the first who made use of the word _calyx_. \"I call a calyx,\"\r\nhe says,[60] \"the external portion of the flower, which enfolds\r\nthe others, whether it be all in one piece, as in the violets, or\r\ndivided, as in the roses.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we wish to conform to the truth, as brought before us by nature,\r\nwe must revolutionize our terminology. Instead of speaking of\r\nbipartite, tripartite, quadripartite, or of bilobed and trilobed\r\ncalices,--terms all signifying that the monophyllous calyx is cloven\r\nmore or less deeply from top to bottom, we must say that the calyx\r\nin such and such a species has its leaflets united at the base, or\r\none third, fourth, or half of its height; the _polyphyllous_ or\r\n_polysepalous_ calyx will be that whose leaflets remain detached,\r\nas was the case in the monophyllous or monosepalous calyx. This\r\nlanguage, recommended by the authority of Auguste Saint-Hilaire,\r\nwould be more precise and exact: therefore, it will not be very\r\nquickly adopted. One would say that the human mind condemns itself\r\nto pass through the purgatory of what is false and complex, before\r\nresolving to adopt the simple and the true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we admit the theory according to which all the organs of the\r\nvegetable are the result of a metamorphosis of the leaf, we shall\r\nask what place is to be given to the calyx in the series of these\r\ntransformations?--Answer: The calyx is a foliaceous transformation,\r\nintermediary between the bracts and the corolla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in the study of the calyx that the attentive eye\r\nis struck by those proteiform movements in which nature makes sport\r\nof our absolute rules.\r\n\r\nFor example: in the _Berberis vulgaris_, the young calicinal\r\nleaflets have less resemblance to the bracts than to the petals of\r\nthe corolla, and hence they have received the name of _petaloid\r\nsepals_. In other flowers this morphogenic wavering inclines towards\r\nthe bracts rather than towards the corolla. We hesitate, therefore,\r\nwhether we must give the name of _calyx_ or _bracts_ to the three\r\nunder leaflets which are visible beneath the petaloid envelope of\r\nthe _Anemone nemorosa_, or wood anemone. The calyx of the Celandine\r\n(_Ranunculus ficaria_), which also flowers in spring, is exactly like\r\na whorl or involucre formed by the union of the bracts.\r\n\r\nA similar embarrassment takes place when the calyx, in its\r\nmetamorphosis, inclines too visibly in the direction of the corolla.\r\nThus, in the _Polygala vulgaris_,--a little, vivacious, and very\r\nabundant plant,--the two inner leaflets of the calyx are not only\r\nlarger than the three other outer leaves, but they are coloured like\r\nthe petals, and become, towards the close of their flowering time,\r\nmembranous, herbaceous, and marked with three strong veins: they\r\nresemble the wings of a butterfly, and have been called wings.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities are useful in the distinction of certain species,\r\nwhich, at bottom, are simply varieties. Thus, in the _Polygala\r\nAustriaca_ (_Polygala amara_ of Keoch, _Polygala uliginosa_ of\r\nReichenbach),--a plant with small white or bluish leaves, which is\r\nsometimes met with on the borders of peaty swamps,--the central vein\r\nor ridge of the wings is simple, and never anastomoses with the\r\nlateral veins; while, in the _Polygala vulgaris_, as well as in the\r\n_Polygala depressa_ and _Polygala amarella_, the vein is ramified,\r\nand anastomoses more or less widely with the laterals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut since we are upon this subject, why should we not seize the\r\nopportunity of familiarising ourselves, under the form of a\r\ndigression, with the little family of the Polygalaceæ? But no; we\r\nwill adjourn the episode, since it would cut the thread of our\r\ndiscourse upon the calyx, our _calicology_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome calices there are, which, by their colouring, approximate so\r\nclosely to the second floral envelope, that one is always tempted to\r\ncall them corollas.\r\n\r\nSuch are:--The red calyx of the fuchsia;\r\n\r\nThe yellow calyx of the furze (_Ulex Europæus_), and of a kind of\r\nhellebore (_Helleborus hyemalis_);\r\n\r\nThe rosy calyx of the Christmas rose (_Helleborus niger_);\r\n\r\nThe blue calyx of the larkspur (_Delphinium Ajacis_); and the Napel\r\naconite (_Aconitum Napellus_).\r\n\r\nIn the _Aquilegia vulgaris_, and in the _Trollius Europæus_, the\r\ncalyx, by the form and colouring of its leaflets, is confounded with\r\nthe second whorl so completely, that Linnæus gave it the name of\r\n_corolla_.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the midst of these waverings, which lead us to\r\nmistake the calicinal leaflets sometimes for bracts, sometimes for\r\npetals, we recognise perfectly the foliaceous type. Independently\r\nof its colour, which is generally green, the calyx has the same\r\norganisation as the leaf; we find in it the same tracheæ and the\r\nsame stomata, the same glands and the same hairs; the veins and\r\nramifications are also the same; and, in more than one instance,\r\nthe calicinal leaflet resumes the character of a veritable leaf.\r\nLook, for example, at the five leaflets, united so strongly at the\r\nbase but so free at the top, arranged in the form of a quincunx, of\r\nthe hundred-leaved rose. The two external, enlarged, and lanceolate\r\npieces are garnished on the right and left, and often at the point,\r\nwith tiny foliaceous appendages, which, in every respect, imitate the\r\ncomposite leaf that carries the slender stem. And if we move aside\r\nthe external or bearded parts of the calyx, we see that the internal\r\nbear less and less resemblance to a leaf. Thus, the part which\r\ncomes next is _semi-bearded_; that is to say, it is furnished with\r\nfoliaceous appendages only on one side; and the two upper pieces are\r\n_beardless_, that is, reduced to the dilated central vein.\r\n\r\nIt was these metamorphic forms of the free portion of the calicinal\r\nfoliola (united below) of the rose, which originated a well-known\r\nenigma, conveyed in the following Latin distich:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quique sumus fratres, unus barbatus et alter,\r\n    Imberbes duo, sum semi-berbes duo, sum semi-berbes ego.\"\r\n\r\n      (\"We are brothers, both bearded, two beardless; I am two\r\n      half-bearded, and I myself am half-bearded.\")\r\n\r\nThey are specially noticeable in a variety of the Rose of Bengal, in\r\nwhich all the petals seem to be transformed into calicinal leaves.\r\n(Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe part of the calyx formed by the union of the sepals is called the\r\n_tube_: it is invariably the lower part. The upper portion, where the\r\nsepals are free, is the _limb_.\r\n\r\nThroughout the vegetable kingdom you will not find a calyx in which\r\nthe union of the sepals takes place at the top.\r\n\r\nThis time, at all events, we have found--what is exclusively rare in\r\nnature--a rule without an exception.\r\n\r\nGenerally, it is almost impossible to disunite, without rending, the\r\nfoliola composing the tube of the calyx, their union is so complete.\r\nThis circumstance prevented the first observers from accurately\r\napprehending the composition and true development of the calyx. There\r\nare cases, nevertheless, in which Nature--the coquette!--suffers\r\nherself to be surprised, if her lover have patience. As an example we\r\nshall cite the monophyllous calyx of the Œnotheræ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Rose of Bengal.]\r\n\r\nLet us take the species known as _Œnothera biennis_. It belongs,\r\nwith the fuchsia, circæa, trapa, and others, to the Evening Primrose\r\nfamily, or Onograceæ.\r\n\r\nIts pale yellow blossoms are unfolded during the hush of evening-time\r\nin almost every garden, shedding abroad on the breeze its delicate\r\nbut delicious odour. Its petals open in a remarkable manner. The\r\ncalyx, as we shall see, has small hooks attached to its upper\r\nextremity, by which it holds the flower together before expansion.\r\nThe calicinal divisions gradually unfold at the lower part, and\r\nreveal the yellow flower, which remains awhile closed at the upper\r\nparts of the hooks. The flower then suddenly opens half-way, when it\r\nstops; afterwards completing its expansion gradually, and finally\r\nopening with a loud noise.\r\n\r\nThis curious plant is of American origin, and was unknown in\r\nour country until 1674, when it was introduced by some French\r\nfloriculturists.\r\n\r\nIt opens generally at about six or seven o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nAnd this statement induces me to digress. Where can I better\r\nintroduce to the reader's notice a Floral Dial? It is not so complete\r\nas it might be made if I had space to enlarge upon the subject. My\r\nobject, however, is simply to _suggest_; and this brief allusion to\r\nthe hours at which flowers fold and unfold may induce the reader to\r\nstudy in more detail a very pleasant branch of botanical science. He\r\nwill find full particulars in Mr Loudon's excellent \"Encyclopædia of\r\nGardening.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated that the first Floral Dial, or clock, which\r\nshowed the time by the opening or shutting up of blossoms throughout\r\nthe day, was a fancy or invention of the great Swedish naturalist,\r\nLinnæus. But there is a distinct allusion to this poetical\r\nmeasurement of the \"fleeting hours\" in Marvell's poem on \"The\r\nGarden:\"--\r\n\r\n    \"How well the skilful gardener drew\r\n    By flowers and herbs this dial new!\r\n    Where, from above, the milder sun\r\n    Does through a fragrant zodiac run;\r\n    And, as it works, the industrious bee\r\n    Computes its time as well as we.\r\n    How could such sweet and wholesome hours\r\n    Be reckoned but with herbs and flowers?\"\r\n\r\nWhether the idea first occurred to Englishman or Swede, poet or\r\nbotanist, matters but little; it is a graceful, a suggestive, a\r\nbeautiful idea, and might well be reproduced in some of our large\r\npublic gardens.\r\n\r\n    \"'Twas a lovely thought to mark the hours,\r\n      As they floated in light away,\r\n    By the opening and the folding flowers,\r\n      As they laugh to the summer's day.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus had each moment its own rich hue,\r\n      And its graceful cup and bell,\r\n    In whose coloured vase might sleep the dew,\r\n      Like a pearl in an ocean shell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORAL DIAL.\r\n\r\nTIME AT WHICH THE FOLLOWING FLOWERS FOLD AND UNFOLD.\r\n\r\n                                                      Open.

The Pythagorean tetrad (_i.e._, the\r\nnumber 4 and its double) predominates in all its organs: 4 stigmata\r\ncrowning a filiform stylus; quadrangular capsule with 4 polyspermous\r\nlobes; opening at top by the separation of 4 valves; twice 4 stamens;\r\n4 petals on a large, emarginated limb; 4 sepals. These are united at\r\nthe base, but not so as to prevent the observer from distinguishing\r\ntheir number.\r\n\r\nThe general terms \"regular\" and \"irregular,\" applied to the calyx,\r\nas to every other organ, require to be employed with considerable\r\nreserve. The delicate shades, which ought to separate regularity from\r\nirregularity, are often so inappreciable that it is almost impossible\r\nto say where one begins and the other ends. See, for example, the\r\nLabiatæ. In most genera and species of this family, the two lips,\r\none of which consists of two and the other of three foliola, bring\r\nout very completely the inequality of the calyx. But there are also\r\nLabiatæ, the inequality of whose sepals completely effaces the\r\ncharacter of the irregular bilabiated calyx.\r\n\r\nIn certain inflorescences, where the flowers comprising them are\r\nvery close together, as, for example, in the capitules of the\r\nSynantheraceæ, the free upper portions of the calyx may take the\r\nmost irregular forms; as, sometimes, a tuft, simple or feathery;\r\nsometimes, membranous or scarious spangles; and, sometimes, bristles\r\nof greater or less stiffness. What elements of the calyx do these\r\ntransformations represent? The veins, and notably the midrib of the\r\nlimb of the sepals, united underneath.\r\n\r\nThe free foliola of the _polyphyllous_ calyx may vary in form, like\r\nthe caulinary leaves whence they issue by way of metamorphosis; they\r\nmay be oval, elliptical, linear, &c. Yet none have ever been observed\r\nof a heart-shape (_cordiform_).\r\n\r\nCertain foliola of the polyphyllous calyx affect fantastic outlines.\r\nIn the _Delphinium_, the upper sepal is prolonged into a spur. In the\r\naconites it is hollow like a helmet. The spur of the calyx of the\r\nmonk's-hood (_Capucine_) is the result of the united prolongation of\r\nthese foliola. The buckler (_Scutellum_), from which is named the\r\n_Scutellaria_, a genus of Labiatæ, is a demi-orbicular boss formed\r\nbelow the inferior lip of the calyx.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe union of the calicinal foliola sometimes forms a conical calyx,\r\nas in the _Silena conica_, and sometimes a cup-shaped calyx, as\r\nin the orange; sometimes, moreover, an urceolate calyx, as in the\r\nhenbane (_Hyosciamus niger_). These forms may vary singularly. The\r\ncalyx of the black alder (_Rhamnus frangula_) is shaped like a top;\r\nthat of the haricot (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), like a bell; that of the\r\ntobacco-plant, or the _Mollucella spinosa_, is infundibuliform (or\r\nfunnel-shaped).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--The Henbane.]\r\n\r\nThe observer is sometimes embarrassed in deciding to which whorl he\r\nshould refer the foliola he is examining. Thus, the tiny foliola\r\nwhich, in the strawberry and the potentilla, alternate with others\r\nand larger ones, are stipules rather than sepals. Ought the sepals\r\nof the calyx in the Malvaceæ to be assimilated in like manner to the\r\nstipules? It is difficult to reply to this question satisfactorily.\r\nTake, for example, the _Hibiscus Syriacus_, an ornamental shrub,\r\nbetter known by the name of the garden-hemp. The inner calyx, or\r\ncalyx properly so called, of this Malvacea has five sepals, while\r\nthe outer calyx, or calicule, has twelve. Now, a leaf cannot have\r\nmore than two stipules, one on each side. For an outer calyx, then,\r\nthe proper number of foliola is ten, not twelve. To look upon the\r\nsecond calyx as a \"supernumerary development,\" would be to hazard a\r\nsupposition contrary to the unity of plan of the floral organs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe calyx, like the corolla, is not an absolutely indispensable\r\norgan. Sometimes, therefore, it is _caducous_--that is, falls off\r\nbefore the flower expands,--as in poppies; sometimes, _persistent_,\r\nor remains after flowering,--as in roses and the majority of\r\nplants. In some cases it is persistent only until after the act of\r\nfecundation, but this act accomplished, it falls with the corolla in\r\nmost of the Cruciferæ and Ranunculaceæ. This is a _deciduous_ calyx.\r\n\r\nThe \"caducity\" and \"persistency\" of floral envelopes furnish some\r\nvaluable characteristics for the distinction of species. Thus, two\r\nclosely-allied Cruciferæ, the _Alyssum calicinum_, so common in\r\nspring upon stony soils, and the _Alyssum montanum_, can only be\r\ndistinguished from one another by the fact that the calyx of the\r\nformer is persistent, of the latter caducous. It is true that the\r\nflowers of the _Alyssum calicinum_ are of a yellow which easily\r\npasses into white, while those of the _Alyssum montanum_ are of a\r\nbeautiful permanent yellow. But this latter distinction is not so\r\ngood as the former.\r\n\r\nThe persistent calyx sometimes assumes a considerable increase of\r\nvery common appearance. For example, take the _Physalis alkekengi_,\r\na member of the Nightshade family or Solanaceæ. The red bladder-like\r\naccrescence surrounding the scarlet fruit is the calyx, which, after\r\nflowering, has grown much larger than it was before. And these\r\nbright flowers which resemble large strawberries, and abound on the\r\nborders of meadow-paths, if you look at them closely, you find to be\r\nthe accrescent calices of the _Trifolium fragiferum_. The very word\r\n_fragiferum_ reminds us of the strawberry.\r\n\r\nThe calyx may change in consistency and texture in proportion as\r\nthe ovary, to which it adheres, changes into fruit. The fleshy\r\npulpy substance of the apple, and, in general, of the fruits of\r\nthe Pomaceæ, is simply an excessive development of the calicinal\r\ntube united all around the ovary, and recognisable in the pips,\r\nimprisoned, towards the centre, in horny lobes. In other plants, as\r\nthe flower develops into fruit, the calyx becomes woody: such is the\r\ncase with the Water Chestnut (_Trappa natans_).\r\n\r\nFinally, the calyx may even contribute to the dissemination of the\r\nseed. We may cite, as an example, a Brazilian species of Urticaceæ,\r\nwhich Saint-Hilaire named the _Elasticaria_. The fleshy and\r\ncylindrical parts of the calyx are curved inwards, and thus defend,\r\nas one might do with one's bended fingers, the young fruit until it\r\nis completely developed; as soon as the fruit is ripe, they spring up\r\nerect, and launch it to a distance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Corolla._--If from the circumference we proceed to the centre\r\nof the flower, the calyx being the first, the _corolla_ will be its\r\nsecond envelope.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, we proceed from the centre to the circumference,\r\nthe corolla will form the fourth whorl; the pistil (consisting of\r\nstigmata, stylus, and ovary) being the first; the nectariferous\r\ndisc (often wanting) the second; and the stamens the third whorl.\r\nRemarkable for its varied tints, the corolla, to indifferent or\r\nignorant eyes, seems the entire flower.\r\n\r\nA black or blackish colour is exceedingly rare. Out of 300 vegetable\r\nspecies which compose the flora of Central Europe, there are not six\r\nwith blackish or even grayish flowers. No hypothesis has yet been put\r\nforward to explain this mark-worthy rarity.\r\n\r\nSpecies with a yellow corolla are the most numerous, forming more\r\nthan a sixth of the European flora: then come, in their order of\r\nfrequency, species with green, white, red, and blue flowers; the\r\nwhite increasing in number as we approach the Pole.\r\n\r\nDividing the flora into twenty parts, we may ascribe to each colour,\r\nand its various tints, the following proportion:--\r\n\r\n    Yellow,      6.0\r\n    Green,       4.50\r\n    White,       4.0\r\n    Red,         3.50\r\n    Blue,        1.50\r\n    Black,       0.50\r\n\r\nThe analogy between the parts or _petals_ of the corolla and the\r\nleaf, is perhaps not quite so striking as between the leaf and the\r\n_sepals_ of the calyx. The phrase \"rose-leaves\" is an expression\r\nconsecrated by immemorial usage. Why not prefer the term \"corollary\r\nleaves or leaflets (_foliola_)\" to that of petals?\r\n\r\nThe corollary leaves, or petals, are organised like true leaves.\r\nThey have the same system of venation; their _lamina_ correspond\r\nto the \"limb,\" or \"blade;\" and their _unguis_, or \"claw,\" to the\r\n\"petiole,\" or stalk. (See Fig. 46, _a_.) The upper margin of petals\r\nis frequently more obtuse than the overspreading margin of the blade\r\nof a leaf, which, in most cases, is pointed. Non-_unguiculate_ petals\r\nrepresent the _sessile_ leaves. (Fig. 46, _b_.) Their form is much\r\nmore varied than that of the calicinal foliola, which are never\r\nunguiculate or petiolated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46, _a_.--Unguis of the Corolla.\r\n\r\nFIG. 46, _b_.--A Sessile Petal.]\r\n\r\nThe petal is defined as _regular_ when its two halves, folded\r\none upon another at the midrib, exactly cover each other; in the\r\nopposite case it is called _irregular_. In certain species, the\r\npetals are furnished with characteristic appendages. But observe,\r\nthese appendages, which generally affect the form of a spur, have no\r\ncharacter of generality. Thus, for example, in the violet, a single\r\npetal is prolonged into a spur below its point of attachment; in\r\nlarkspur, and the other _Delphiniums_, there are two which terminate\r\nin the same manner; in the _Aquilegia vulgaris_, all the petals are\r\n_calcarate_ (_calcar_, a spur).\r\n\r\nAccording as the veins of the petal proceed in a straight or curved\r\ndirection, its limb may be flat, or concave, or hollowed like\r\na boat--_i.e._, _cymbiform_ (_cymba_, a boat), or _naviculate_\r\n(_navis_, a ship), or like a spoon, _cochleariform_ (_cochleare_, a\r\nspoon). When the spur is very short, as in Antirrhinum and Valerian,\r\nthe corolla or petal is termed _gibbous_ (_gibbus_, a swelling), or\r\n_saccate_ at the base.\r\n\r\nIf a petal continue narrow, so as to seem formed by the prolongation\r\nof the claw, it is called _linear_; if the limb be prolonged below,\r\nso as to form two lobes, it is _cordate_, as in _Genista caudicans_;\r\nor if the lobes be acute, it may be _sagittate_ or _hastate_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _number_ of petals varies from two to twelve, and more. A corolla\r\nwith a single petal, _unipetalous_, which we must not confound with\r\nthe _monopetalous_ corolla, is a monstrosity, created by defective\r\ndevelopment; the other petals or foliola are abortive. A corolla with\r\ntwo petals, or _dipetalous_, as in _Circæa Lutetiana_, is rare. A\r\n_tripetalous_ corolla occurs only when the calyx has likewise three\r\nfoliola. But in this instance opinions are divided: the majority\r\nwill not admit more than a single floral envelope,--a perianth of\r\nsix foliola, of which three, herbaceous and internal, alternate with\r\nthree petaloid and external.\r\n\r\nMany of our aquatic plants may be quoted as examples: such as the\r\n_Butomus umbellatus_, or flowering rush; the little frog-bit, or\r\n_Hydrocharis morsus ranæ_; and the water plantain, _Alisma plantago_.\r\n\r\nThe _tetrapetalous_ (or four-petalled) corolla is usually arranged\r\nlike a cross, and is much more frequent than the _dipetalous_ or\r\n_tripetalous_; for examples, we need only refer to the large and\r\nimportant family of the Cruciferæ.\r\n\r\nThe number five (_pentapetalous_) is still more common; but we meet\r\nwith it in other organs besides petals, and it seems particularly\r\ncharacteristic of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThus, all the Umbelliferæ have five sepals, five petals, and five\r\nstamens; in all the Crassulaceæ, the number five applies, not only to\r\nthe sepals and the petals, as well as to the stamens, but also to the\r\ncarpels which compose the ovary.\r\n\r\nCorollas with six, eight, nine, ten, or twelve petals are relatively\r\nrarer; and when the petals become so numerous that we cannot count\r\nthem, we have to deal with transformations of stamens into petals,\r\nwith those monstrosities of cultivation which we call double flowers,\r\n_flores pleni_, where all the male organs have disappeared,--flowers\r\nwholly unfit for fructification.\r\n\r\nThe petals of the corolla are not always free. Like those of the\r\ncalyx, they may be attached to one another by their edges, but this\r\nunion invariably takes place, as in the former, from bottom to top.\r\nTherefore, we never see any petals united at the top, and disengaged\r\nat the bottom (see Fig. 47, _a_.) But the reader must take careful\r\nnote that this invariable characteristic is not peculiar only to the\r\nfloral envelopes; it is not met with in the stamens, for these may\r\nbe united, either by their anthers, as in the whole family of the\r\nSynantheræ, or by their filaments, as in the Leguminosæ. And what\r\nwe have said of the stamens applies also to the parts constituting\r\nthe pistil. This radical difference between the perianth and the\r\ntrue reproductive organs ought, from the beginning, to have fixed\r\nthe attention of botanists on the centripetal and centrifugal\r\nmetamorphosis of the leaf, which we have spoken of in \"The Circle of\r\nthe Year.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47, _a_.--Natural junction of Petal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47, _b_.--Unnatural (and impossible) junction.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn many plants we are permitted to follow step by step, as it were,\r\nthe union of the petals, and their definitive transformation into\r\nwhat is called the _monopetalous_ corolla. The term _monopetaloid_\r\nought then to be rejected, if we are to believe that the\r\n_monopetalous_ corolla is the result of the metamorphosis of a\r\nsingle leaf. The word _gamopetalous_, or, rather, _gamophyllous_,\r\nis preferable. As we have remarked in reference to the calyx, we\r\nshall here repeat that the expressions _bilobed_, _trilobed_,\r\n_quadrilobed_, or _bipartite_, _tripartite_, _quadripartite_\r\ncorollas, are radically vicious, because they are the consequence of\r\na false point of view, according to which the _monopetalous_ corolla\r\nwill be simply a single metamorphosed leaf, susceptible of being more\r\nor less deeply divided from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nThe polypetalous corolla, as well as the gamophyllous corolla,\r\nmay be regular or irregular, according as the foliola are equally\r\nor unequally united. But here again we must be careful not to lay\r\ndown too absolute rules. Examine, for instance, the gamophyllous\r\ncorolla of the gentians; their two lobes are very unequal, and yet\r\nthe corolla is regular: five very large lobes alternate with five\r\nvery small, in such wise that each of the latter is situated between\r\ntwo larger lobes. Each division of the corolla of the periwinkle is\r\nirregular, and yet the aggregate of their divisions is regular: these\r\nare all of the same form and the same size.\r\n\r\nIn the gamophyllous corolla we are able to discern, through the\r\ndifferent forms it assumes, the form of the parts which compose\r\nthe union. Thus, for example, the _tubulate_ corolla supposes the\r\npre-existence of unguiculate petals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInequality of union produces the _bilabiate_ corolla, which is\r\ninvariably tubular. This is the case in the natural family of the\r\nLabiatæ. The upper lip is composed of two petals, and the lower of\r\nthree. The parts of the upper are sometimes so closely joined that\r\nthey appear to be but one, as in the _Lamium_; and the lower often\r\nbecomes quadrilobed by the division of the middle petal, as in the\r\n_Stæcha_.\r\n\r\nIn the labiated corolla, the mouth of the tube is open, while in\r\nthe _personate_ or _masked_ (_persona_, a mask) it is closed by\r\nthe pressure of the lower lip against the upper; as in Snapdragon\r\nand Frogsmouth, the projection of the lower lip being called the\r\n_palate_. By this feature the family of the Scrophulariaceæ is\r\neasily distinguished from that of the Labiatæ.\r\n\r\nIn some corollas, the two lips are hollowed out in a very singular\r\nfashion, as in the Calceolaria; assuming a \"slipper-like appearance,\"\r\nsimilar to what takes place in the labellum of certain orchids,--to\r\nwit, the _Cypripedium_. These _calceolate_ (_calceolus_, a slipper)\r\ncorollas may be looked upon as consisting of two slipper-like lips.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe forms of the bilabiate, tubular, and ligulose florets, of the\r\ncapitula of the Synantheræ, are likewise due to simple differences of\r\nunion. The floscular capitulum comprises the tubular florets, and the\r\nsemi-floscular capitulum, the ligulate florets; the radiate capitulum\r\nconsists of florets ligulate or bilabiate at the circumference, and\r\nof tubular florets over the rest of the receptacle. By considering\r\nthe capitula, as the vulgar do, to be flowers, Tournefort introduced\r\nconsiderable confusion into the nomenclature of the Synantheræ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n    \"Dawn, gentle flower,\r\n      From the morning earth!\r\n    We will gaze and wonder\r\n      At thy wondrous birth!\r\n\r\n    \"Bloom, gentle flower,\r\n      Lover of the light,\r\n    Sought by wind and shower,\r\n      Fondled by the night!\"[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRUNELLA, OR SELF-HEAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--\"Rejoicing in the shade of over-arching\r\nelms.\"]\r\n\r\nIn your summer-walks, dear reader,--summer-walks through green lanes\r\nrejoicing in the shade of over-arching elms, or along woodland\r\nglades, carpeted with odorous turf,--you must frequently have met\r\nwith an herbaceous plant, whose purple-blue flowers, arranged in\r\nregular succession, form the prettiest coloured cones imaginable at\r\nthe extremity of the stem and branches. To this plant, the self-heal,\r\nwe shall return immediately. Perhaps you have passed it by somewhat\r\nindifferently, for we pay little heed to common things, and on the\r\nthreshold of woods, and in their winding avenues, the self-heal\r\nis very common. The celebrated German botanist, Bock (or Tragus)\r\nbestowed upon it, two centuries before the epoch of Linnæus, the name\r\nof _Prunella vulgaris_. The specific appellation, _vulgaris_, is here\r\nemployed very appropriately, but we should commit a grave error if we\r\nsupposed every species qualified as _vulgaris_ to be \"common.\" For\r\nexample, the _Lysimachia vulgaris_, a species of Primulaceæ, is far\r\nfrom being found everywhere.\r\n\r\nPray, take the trouble to pick one lowly specimen; being specially\r\ncareful to take up the whole plant, stem, root, and branch. Lying\r\nalong the ground, it seems larger than it really is. Its root is\r\na creeper; at the level of the insection of the leaves some small\r\nshoots project, the fibrous radicles which compel the lower part of\r\nthe stem to crawl like the bugle, _Ajuga reptans_.\r\n\r\nDoes the prunella belong to the family of Labiatæ, like the bugle?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--The Prunella.]\r\n\r\nSee for yourself. The stem is quadrangular; the branches and leaves\r\ncomposed of two lips. The stamens are four in number, two of which\r\nare longer than the others; finally, by means of a lens, you can\r\neasily distinguish, at the very bottom of the calyx, four tiny seeds\r\n(a _tetrachænium_) grouped around the style. These features indicate\r\nthat our plant belongs, in effect, like the bugle, to the Labiatæ\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nBut mark the difference. In the bugle, as in all the species of the same\r\ngenus (_Ajuga_), as well as in all the _Teucriums_--of which wild sage\r\n(_Teucrium scorodonia_) is the most widely-diffused type--in all the\r\nLabiatæ, the corolla is apparently _unilabiate_,--that is to say, the\r\nupper lip is so shortened that only the lower is prominently visible.\r\nThis is not the case with our self-heal: it is distinctly bilabiate. The\r\nupper lip of the corolla here forms a positive _hood_, sufficiently ample\r\nto protect the didynamous stamens (two long and two short), as in Fig.\r\n50, _a_; the lower lip is three-lobed, and the central lobe is largest of\r\nthe three. By separating the two lips, you can see the two short stamens\r\nfixed to the base of the lower one, and the two long attached to the\r\ncentral part of the upper. (See Fig. 50, _b_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--The Lips of the _Prunella vulgaris_.]\r\n\r\nLet us pursue the analysis of the flowery cone you hold in your hand.\r\n\r\nThe least practical eye is immediately struck by the arrangement of\r\nthe parts and the variety of the colours. To recognise these things\r\nmore thoroughly, please to cast your glances alternately from the top\r\nto the base, and from the base to the apex of its terminal flower. A\r\nlittle below the base you will see a pair of opposite, entire, and\r\nsinuous leaves, with shorter stalks than any of the others. The base\r\nis defined by two opposite, whitish, and nearly triangular leaves,\r\nwith green points. The top of the floral spike is likewise marked by\r\na couple of bracts; but these are much smaller, and red-coloured,\r\nlike the two leaves of the calyx. The interval is occupied by bracts,\r\nwhich diminish in size from the base to the top of the spike; on a\r\nlevel with each pair six flowers are inserted, three for each bract.\r\n\r\nThe flowers, thus arranged by whorls, present some interesting\r\npeculiarities. The lower and upper show only their reddish calices;\r\nthe middle, for the most part, display both a calyx and a corolla,\r\nvarying from blue to pale-rose, which gives the plant a very peculiar\r\nappearance. In the under flowers, the corolla has already fallen;\r\nby separating the lips of the calyx, you may catch sight of the\r\ntetrachænium, that is, the four-seeded fruit, which is developed at\r\nthe bottom of the tube. In the upper flowers, the corolla is not yet\r\nexpanded. It resembles a small deep-coloured globe; you may say an\r\neye, a bull's-eye, which, from the depths of the calyx, regards you\r\nwith a piercing glance. Hence, perhaps, the French name for this\r\nplant, _prunelle_, an eye.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe often meet with a variety of self-heal with a white corolla,\r\ngreen calyx, and pinnatifid leaves, a variety of which some\r\nbotanists have erroneously made a separate species, under the name\r\nof _Prunella alba_. It is equally wrong, in our opinion, to convert\r\nthe large-flowered variety into a distinct species, by taking as its\r\nspecific character the _lateral cleft of the upper lip of the calyx\r\noverlapping the middle cleft_; for this same characteristic is found\r\nin many individuals of the common species. The _dentiform appendage_\r\nwhich the two longest stamens exhibit at the top of their filaments\r\nis also an uncertain feature; you must have recourse to your\r\nmagnifying-glass to see if this appendage is _obtuse_ and very short,\r\nas in the large-flowered prunella, or _sharp_, as in the common\r\nspecies. As for the size of the corolla, it is, in fact, very marked;\r\nbut, as a characteristic, is wholly insufficient. The creation of the\r\nvarieties _Pinnatifida_, _Laciniifolia_, and _Integrifolia_ is no\r\nbetter justified. For it is no rare thing to see on the same stalk,\r\nat different heights, pinnatifid, whole, and laciniate leaves.\r\n\r\nThe prunella is remarkable for the long hairs which garnish the\r\ncalyx, and, principally, the edges of the bracts. Examined in the\r\nmicroscope, they assume the form of tiny, pointed bamboos; the knots\r\nbulge out a little, and the intervals are punctuated.\r\n\r\nThe botanists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are by no\r\nmeans sparing in their eulogiums on the marvellous virtues of our\r\nflower, which, by the way, Bock (Tragus) was the first to figure with\r\ntolerable accuracy.[62]\r\n\r\nTournefort thus dwells upon its medicinal properties:--\r\n\r\n\"It forms an ingredient in arquebusade water and vulnerary potions.\r\nIt is ordered in possets and broths, in apozèmes for the spitting of\r\nblood, dysentery, hæmorrhages, and the like. It has also been used\r\nfor ulcers in the mouth, and a remedy against headaches; after being\r\nmixed with rose-oil and vinegar, the temples were bathed with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Pharmacopœia of to-day, however, it finds no place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCUTELLARIA.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance, the Scutellaria has no resemblance to the\r\nprunella. Yet the classificators have united these plants in one\r\nsmall tribe, under the name of _Scutellarinaceæ_. These are the\r\ncharacters which they give to them: Lower or anterior stamens longer\r\nthan the superior or posterior; calyx closed at maturity by the\r\napproximation of the two lips. The latter character is not nearly so\r\nmarked in the prunella as in the scutellaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--_Scutellaria galericulata._]\r\n\r\nThe two commonest species of scutellaria in England are the\r\n_Scutellaria galericulata_ and _Scutellaria minor_. They do not\r\ninhabit the same localities. The former, which is at the same time\r\nthe commonest, grows on the river-banks, and especially delights in\r\nthe mould accumulated in the hollow trunks of old willows. It is\r\neasily known by its tender blue corolla, but especially by its calyx,\r\nwhich, after the fall of the corolla, develops itself in a singular\r\nmanner. If you compress its sides, it will open so as to disclose,\r\nat the bottom of its throat, its seeds, which are white, red, or\r\nbrown, according to their degrees of maturity. (Fig. 52, _a_.) Now\r\nlook at these two _jaws_: the upper resembles a small helmet (Lat.\r\n_galericula_), or, if you prefer it, a judge's cap. As for the lower,\r\nit has exactly the shape of a shield (Lat. _scutum_),--whence its\r\nname, _scutellaria_. (Fig. 52, _b_.) Thus, the emblems of military\r\nand judicial rank are found united in the calyx of our pretty labiate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Calyx of the Scutellaria.]\r\n\r\nThe second species (_Scutellaria minor_), rarer than the former,\r\nis met with on the banks of ponds and in damp woodland paths. It\r\nattracts your gaze by its tiny caps or helmets: the moment you see\r\nit, you exclaim, \"That's a scutellaria!\" More diminutive in all its\r\nparts than its congener, it is also distinguished by its whole leaves\r\n(they are crenelated or dentate in the _Scutellaria galericulata_),\r\nby its soft, rose-hued corolla, with brown lips coquettishly pointed\r\nwith red, and by its hairy calyx.\r\n\r\nThe _Scutellaria Columnæ_[63] is very rare. It may be recognised\r\nby its erect stems and flowers of a bright violet hue, arranged in\r\nterminal spikes and garnished with bracts; while the flowers are\r\naxillary, and form no spike, in the two species above described.\r\n\r\nThe _Scutellariæ_ were first described with accuracy and classified\r\nby Linnæus, who included them among his _Didynamia_, a class of\r\nvegetables distinguished by the unequal length of the stamens.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORGET-ME-NOT.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye field flowers! the gardens eclipse you, 'tis true;\r\n    Yet, wildlings of nature, I dote upon you,\r\n      For ye waft me to summers of old,\r\n    When the earth beamed around me with fairy delight,\r\n    And daisies and buttercups gladdened my sight,\r\n      Like treasures of silver and gold.\r\n\r\n    \"Even now, what affections the violet awakes!\r\n    What loved little islands, far seen in the lakes,\r\n      Can the wild water-lily restore!\r\n    What landscapes I read in the primrose's looks!\r\n    What pictures of pebbles and minnowy brooks\r\n      In the vetches that tangle the shore!\"[64]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--\"A loved little island, far seen in the\r\nlake.\"]\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful,\" says Miss Pratt, in one of her agreeable little\r\nbooks,[65]--\"how beautiful are the little islands of the stream,\r\nedged with the tall white meadow sweet, which sends its perfume\r\nfar up over the green lands that lie around, and contrasts with\r\nthe deep blue colour of the purple loose-strife! The willow herb,\r\nor codlins-and-cream, as the children call it, grows in perfection\r\nthere; and there, too, bloom the little yellow water-flag, and the\r\nvetches, and the rich water-lily, which, seated on its round leaf,\r\nseems to swim over the crystal stream. The water-plantain, with its\r\nnumerous small pink blossoms, grows in thick clusters quite down in\r\nthe water, mingling with the white flowers and large spear-shaped\r\nleaves of the arrow-head, or half shading the large cup of the\r\nyellow water-lily. Then, too, the blue-eyed forget-me-not covers\r\nthe little isles in such abundance that many of them well deserve\r\nthe name of azure islands. The water-rat hides among the flowers,\r\nnibbling with much glee at the arrow-head, or rushing out from under\r\nits broad green leaves; and the water-fowl, followed by her young,\r\nsails across the stream in all the stateliness of matron dignity;\r\nand the little meek-eyed daisy grows beside the yellow velvet flower\r\nof the silver-weed, or the blue blossoms and succulent leaves of the\r\nbrook-lime.\"\r\n\r\nThe _true_ Forget-me-not, _Myosotis palustris_, is invariably found\r\nin marshy localities or on the banks of streams; but the Meadow\r\nScorpion-grass, _Myosotis arvensis_, is frequently mistaken for it.\r\nThe \"genuine article\" has a bright blue blossom, much smaller than,\r\nbut in shape something resembling, the primrose; in its bract it has\r\na drop of gold, and on each segment of the coloured portion of the\r\nflower is a small streak or fleck of white.\r\n\r\nBoth the true forget-me-not and the false belong to the Borage\r\nfamily, or Boraginaceæ, which includes sixty-seven known genera, and\r\nnearly nine hundred species.\r\n\r\nIt is said that after the battle of Waterloo, a remarkable number of\r\nforget-me-nots sprung up all over the fatal field. The circumstance\r\nmight well be made the theme of a poet's lay, were it not for a\r\nsuspicion that the little blue flowers belonged to the _Myosotis\r\narvensis_ species, and not to the _Myosotis palustris_.\r\n\r\nBut why _Myosotis_? This Greek compound surely means \"mouse-ear,\"\r\nand what have these plants to do with the auricular organs of mice?\r\nWhy, their leaves were supposed to resemble in form the ear of _Mus\r\ndomesticus_. The name of \"scorpion-grass\" originated in the fact that\r\nthe top of the stem coils round while the buds are unblown, like a\r\nscorpion's tail. It is strange how quick the common people have been\r\nto detect these analogies, and to perpetuate them in the appellations\r\nthey have bestowed on the flowers of the meadow, the wood, and the\r\ngreen lane.\r\n\r\nThe singularly beautiful name of the _Myosotis palustris_--we mean\r\nits common and non-scientific name,--is ascribed, in a well-known\r\nGerman legend, to the dying knight who, having ventured at a\r\ndangerous spot to pluck a handful of the bright blue blossoms for\r\nhis lady-love, fell into the stream, and as he sank, flung the\r\ndear-bought spoil towards her, exclaiming, \"Forget me not!\"\r\n\r\nA more probable origin is suggested by Miss Strickland. \"Henry of\r\nLancaster (Henry IV.),\" she says, \"appears to have been the person\r\nwho gave it its emblematical and poetical meaning, by uniting it, at\r\nthe period of his exile, with the initial letters of his watchword,\r\n_Souveigne vous de moi_; thus rendering it the symbol of remembrance,\r\nand, like the subsequent fatal roses of York and Lancaster and\r\nStuart, the lily of Bourbon, and the violet of Napoleon, an\r\nhistorical flower.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have said that the scorpion-grass belongs to the natural family\r\nBoraginaceæ, which receives its name from the common borage, a bright\r\nblue flower with very rough leaves. All its members are rough or\r\nhairy, except those which, like the forget-me-not, become smooth\r\nfrom living partly under water. The black stalks of the borage\r\nburn, it is said, like match-paper, and its root enters largely\r\ninto the composition of rouge. Its flowers were at one time held\r\nin great respect as a wholesome bitter ingredient for a tankard of\r\nale. According to Pliny, \"if the leaves and flowers of the borage\r\nbe immersed in wine, and that wine drunken, the potion will make\r\nmen blithe and merry, and drive away all heavy sadness and dull\r\nmelancholy.\"\r\n\r\nBurton, in his \"Anatomy of Melancholy,\" also says of it--\r\n\r\n    \"Borage and hellebore fill two scenes,\r\n    Sovereign plants to purge the veins\r\n    Of melancholy, and cheer the heart\r\n    Of those black fumes which make it smart.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the Boraginaceæ are weeds, but they include a few ornamental\r\ngarden-flowers; as, for example, the Peruvian heliotrope--the\r\n\"cherry-pie\" of the children--which is well known for the fragrance\r\nof its blue blossoms. Its Greek name refers to an ancient belief\r\nthat it always \"turned\" to meet the sun; but neither heliotrope nor\r\nsunflower exhibits any such devotedness towards the great \"orb of\r\nday.\" The poet's comparison--\r\n\r\n    \"As the sunflower turns to his God, when he sets,\r\n    The same look that he turned when he rose\"--\r\n\r\nis very pretty and suggestive, but unfortunately it is not true.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LILIES.\r\n\r\nAre we justified in classing these among our summer flowers? Well,\r\nthe lily of the valley may, perhaps, be more justly claimed by\r\nSpring, as it generally unveils its beauty in the month of May; but\r\nthe water-lily belongs to Summer; and, at all events, it will be most\r\nconvenient to speak of them in this category.\r\n\r\nThe lily of the valley (_Convallaria majalis_),--the May-lily of\r\nold writers,--has long been a favourite type of retiring modesty\r\nand tender loveliness. It affects the silence and solitude of\r\nthe woodlands, where, in the shadow of broad leaves and sweeping\r\nbranches, the inquiring botanist discovers--\r\n\r\n                      \"Like detected light,\r\n    Its little green-tipt lamps of white.\"\r\n\r\nShakspeare, who neglected nothing, refers to its gentle humility of\r\nattitude:--\r\n\r\n    \"Shipwrecked upon a kingdom where no pity,\r\n    No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me;\r\n    Almost no grave allowed me! like the lily\r\n    That once was mistress of the field, and flourished,\r\n    I'll hang my head and perish.\"\r\n\r\nOur lily is a native of cold and temperate countries, and never\r\nshakes its pendant bells at the bidding of a hot Eastern breeze.\r\nIt is very abundant in Norway. That agreeable writer and observant\r\ntraveller, Henry Inglis, says:--\"It stood everywhere around, scenting\r\nthe air, and in such profusion, that it was scarcely possible to step\r\nwithout bruising its tender stalks and blossoms. I have not seen this\r\nflower mentioned in any enumeration of Norwegian plants, but it grows\r\nin all the western parts of Norway in latitude 59° and 60°, wherever\r\nthe ground is free from forest, in greater abundance than any other\r\nwild-flower.\"\r\n\r\nAs it will not live in hot countries, it cannot be the \"lily of\r\nthe field\" which furnished our Saviour with so fruitful a text for\r\nwarning and instruction. This, in all probability, was the yellow\r\namaryllis, or _Amaryllis lutea_, a flower bearing some resemblance\r\nto our yellow crocus, but much larger, and with broader leaves.\r\nIts delicate blossoms escape from an undivided spathe, or sheath,\r\nand are bell-shaped, with six clefts and six stamens, which are\r\nalternately short and long. The flower seldom rises more than three\r\nor four inches above the soil, accompanied by green leaves, which,\r\nafter the flowering has passed, continue to preserve their freshness\r\nthroughout the winter.\r\n\r\nBut some authorities are not content with the yellow amaryllis, and\r\nput forth as the _true_ \"lily of the field,\" either the narcissus, or\r\nthe golden lily, or the stately crinum, according to their several\r\ntastes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot connected with these flowers by any botanical relationship, and\r\nsurpassing them all in beauty, is the _Water-lily_ (_Nymphæa alba_),\r\nwhose large round leaves and full white blossoms are the glory of so\r\nmany of our secluded lakes and quiet streams. Everybody knows old\r\nIzaak Walton's quaint eulogium on the strawberry: \"Doubtless God\r\n_could_ have made a better fruit, but doubtless He never hath.\" In\r\nlike manner I am inclined to say: \"Doubtless God might have created a\r\nfairer flower, but doubtless He never hath.\" Alas! like most things\r\nrare and beautiful, its existence is very brief! pluck it, and\r\nstraightway it vanishes,--like a poet's dream, the moment he attempts\r\nto realise it.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes asserted of our wild water-lily that it retires below\r\nthe surface of the stream shortly after noon, remaining in the liquid\r\ndepths during night, and rising again into the light of day at early\r\ndawn. Those who are acquainted with the haunts and habits of these\r\nbeautiful flowers know that this is not strictly correct, as they may\r\noften be seen, \"by the pale moonlight,\" lying folded above the water.\r\nIt is not impossible, however, that _some_ may sink; and certain it\r\nis, that as the sun sets they close their silver vases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--\"Brightened by the uplifted cups of our\r\ndelicate naiads.\"]\r\n\r\n    \"Broad-leaved are they, and their white canopies\r\n    Are upward turned to catch the heaven's dew.\"\r\n\r\nSo says Keats; but this is true only while the sun is asserting\r\nhis supremacy in the azure sky. And then, the spectacle of a calm,\r\nrush-fringed pool, nestling in the shadow of some ancient elms or\r\ndrooping willows, and brightened by the uplifted cups of our delicate\r\nnaiads, is a scene of surpassing beauty. We turn from this favourite\r\nflower regretfully, \"murmuring,\" as novelists say, Mrs Hemans's\r\ngraceful apostrophe:--\r\n\r\n        \"Oh! beautiful thou art,\r\n    Thou sculpture-like and stately river queen,\r\n    Crowning the depths as with the light serene\r\n        Of a pure heart!\r\n\r\n        \"Bright lily of the wave!\r\n    Rising in fearless grace with every swell,\r\n    Thou seem'st as if a spirit meekly brave\r\n        Dwelt in thy cell!\"\r\n\r\nPermit me, reader, another quotation. I take it from your and my\r\nfavourite, Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n    \"Rapturously we gather flowery spoils\r\n    From land and water; lilies of each hue,\r\n    _Golden and white_, that float upon the waves,\r\n    And court the wind.\"\r\n\r\nThe lily of golden hue, the _yellow water-lily_, is the _Nuphar\r\nlutea_ of botanists. The country people, on account of its\r\npeculiar scent, most unpoetically call it \"brandy-bottle.\" It is\r\nfar more plentiful than the regal nymphæa; its flower is not so\r\nfull of petals; and it is by no means so handsome. Yet, with its\r\nsmooth, glossy leaves, and golden cups, and long floating stems,\r\nit favourably attracts the eye. We are told that \"its roots are\r\nnutritious, and are frequently powdered and eaten for bread in\r\nSweden;\" that, mixed with the bark of the Scotch fir, they form a\r\ncake much relished by the Swedes; in which case the Swedish palate\r\ncertainly cannot be censured as fastidious. \"These roots are also\r\nburnt on the hearths of farmhouses, because their smoke is reputed\r\nto drive away the crickets, whose chirping is sometimes too loud\r\nand shrill to be deemed musical.\" Assuredly this is untrue of many\r\nparts of England, as the cricket is popularly supposed to be \"lucky,\"\r\nand no old country-wife would allow it to be driven away from her\r\nsanctum.\r\n\r\nThe water-lily of the East, the beautiful Lotus,--the _Nelumbium\r\nspeciosum_, which is figured on so many Egyptian and Indian\r\nmonuments,--is rich in blue and red, as well as in white blossoms.\r\nThese are said to sink quite below the surface in the evening and\r\nduring the night shadows; whence Moore says of them, with his\r\nartificial prettiness--\r\n\r\n    \"Those virgin lilies, all the night\r\n      Bathing their beauties in the lake,\r\n    That they may rise more fresh and bright\r\n      When their beloved sun's awake.\"\r\n\r\nIt was formerly abundant on the Nile, and the Egyptians consecrated\r\nit to their supreme god, Osiris; but, with the splendour and\r\nmysticism of ancient Egypt, it has completely passed away.\r\n\r\nBut it is scarcely less prized by the Hindus, who have also\r\nconsecrated it to one of their deities. A traveller thus speaks of\r\nthe sacred Ganges in connexion with it:--\"The rich and luxuriant\r\nclusters of the lotus float in quick succession upon the silvery\r\ncurrent. Nor is it the sacred lotus alone which embellishes the\r\nwavelets of the Ganges; large white, yellow, and scarlet flowers\r\npay an equal tribute; and the prows of the numerous native vessels\r\nnavigating the stream are garlanded by long wreaths of the most\r\nbrilliant daughters of the parterre. India may be called a paradise\r\nof flowers: the most beautiful lilies grow spontaneously upon the\r\nsandy shores of the rivers, and from every projecting cliff some\r\nshrub dips its flowers in the waters below.\"\r\n\r\nNo reader of English poetry but is familiar with Tennyson's\r\n\"Lotus-Eaters\"--a poem founded on the old myth of a people who lived\r\nupon the insane root that takes the reason prisoner, and, beguiled\r\nby its sweet intoxication, abandoned themselves to a state of dreamy\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\n    \"And round about the keel with faces pale,\r\n    Dark faces, pale against that rosy flame,\r\n    The mild-eyed, melancholy Lotus-eaters came.\r\n\r\n    \"Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,\r\n    Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave\r\n    To each, but whoso did receive of them,\r\n    And taste, to him the gushing of the wave\r\n    Far, far away did seem to mourn and rave\r\n    On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,\r\n    His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;\r\n    And deep asleep he seemed, yet all awake,\r\n    And music in his ears his beating heart did make.\r\n\r\n    \"They sat them down upon the yellow sand,\r\n    Between the sun and moon upon the shore;\r\n    And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland,\r\n    Of wife, and child, and slave; but evermore\r\n    Most weary seemed the sea, weary the oar,\r\n    Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.\r\n    Then some one said, 'We will return no more;'\r\n    And all at once they sang, 'Our island home\r\n    Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam.'\"\r\n\r\nBut the lotus of poetry is not the _Nelumbium speciosum_. There\r\nis some difficulty in identifying it with any modern plant; but\r\nthe general opinion seems to be, that it was the _Zizyphus lotus_,\r\na species allied to the _Zizyphus jujuba_, and included in the\r\nBuckthorn family (_Rhamnaceæ_).\r\n\r\nThe reader will be by this time aware that of the plants called by\r\nthe general English name of \"lily,\" some have very little kinship\r\nto each other, and others none at all. The little garden flowers\r\nnamed _Lilium_ (from the Celtic word _lis_, \"whiteness\") are mostly\r\nvery handsome. Ben Jonson, speaking of the ordinary lily, says, very\r\nfinely--\r\n\r\n    \"It is not growing like a tree\r\n    In bulk, doth make man better be,\r\n    Or standing long, an oak, three hundred year,\r\n    To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sear:\r\n    A lily of a day\r\n    Is fairer far in May,\r\n    Although it fall and die that night,--\r\n    It was the plant and flower of light.\"\r\n\r\nThe white garden-lily is a native of the Levant, but has become\r\nthoroughly naturalised in England, and is one of the commonest but\r\nmost admired ornaments of our cottage-gardens. The old herbalists\r\nthought highly of its medicinal properties, and pronounced it a\r\ncertain remedy for the bite of a serpent. It is true, at all events,\r\nthat its bruised petals are an excellent cure for any ordinary wound\r\nor bruise.\r\n\r\nOur ancestors, among their other superstitious fancies, entertained\r\nthe extraordinary belief that the price of a bushel of wheat in the\r\nensuing season was foretold by the number of white cups which crowned\r\nthe white lily's stem, each cup being estimated at one shilling. I\r\nopine that our modern farmers would feel dissatisfied if the Mark\r\nLane averages were regulated by this simple standard.\r\n\r\nThe common Turk's-cap lily (_Lilium martagon_) is identified with\r\nthe ancient hyacinth, the \"sanguine flower inscribed with woe.\" The\r\norange lily (_Lilium bulbiferum_) is a native of Southern Europe.\r\nWhen the Dutch were at feud with the House of Orange, they were\r\naccustomed to root up this flower from their gardens, as some solace\r\nto their indignant feelings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Lily of the Valley.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe garden lilies belong to the natural family of the _Liliaceæ_,\r\nwhich includes the following sub-orders:--\r\n\r\n1. _Tulipeæ_, tulip tribe; bulbous plants, with the segments of the\r\nperianth scarcely adherent in a tube.\r\n\r\n2. _Hemerocallideæ_, day-lily tribe; bulbous plants, with a tubular\r\nperianth.\r\n\r\n3. _Scilleæ_, or _Alliæ_, squill or onion tribe; bulbous, with black\r\nand brittle testa.\r\n\r\n4. _Anthericeæ_ or _Asphodeleæ_, asphodel tribe; roots fascicled or\r\nfibrous, leaves neither coriaceous nor permanent.\r\n\r\n5. _Convollarieæ_, lily of the valley tribe; stem developed as a\r\nrhizome or tuber.\r\n\r\n6. _Asparageæ_, asparagus tribe; stem usually fully developed,\r\narborescent, branched in some cases, and leaves frequently permanent\r\nand coriaceous.\r\n\r\n7. _Alonieæ_, aloes tribe; stem usually developed, arborescent, with\r\nsucculent leaves.\r\n\r\n8. _Aphyllantheæ_, grass-tree tribe; characterised by a rush-like\r\nhabit and membranous imbricated bracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENTIANS.\r\n\r\nLet me now direct your attention, reader, to a pretty plant, of very\r\nelegant appearance: crowned, as it is, by a cluster of rosy flowers,\r\nit would not disgrace our well-kept parterres. It is called the\r\ncommon Centaury (_Erythræa centaurium_). You will never see it in the\r\nfields side by side with the _Delphinium_; but in July and August\r\nwill meet with it frequently on the borders of woodland paths and\r\nopen glades.\r\n\r\nWould you create for yourself by the study of nature a source\r\nof enjoyment equally pure and inexhaustible, adopt a method of\r\nclassification for your own use, and, to facilitate you in the task,\r\ntake for your types those plants which are at once the commonest\r\nand most characteristic of each season. Quite at your ease, you may\r\nbegin your analysis by examining the parts which, like the calyx\r\nand the corolla, most attract your attention. The most rational\r\nplan, however, would be, to commence with the seed, and to follow it\r\nthrough all the wonderful phases of its life, from the development of\r\nthe embryo to the maturity of the fruit. Unfortunately, we are all\r\ncompelled to take time into account; time is so much more precious\r\nthan money,--it is the measurement of our existence. Undoubtedly, the\r\nmind, with its gigantic strides, like those of an Homeric god, tends\r\nto overleap the confines both of time and space. But the senses,\r\nwithout whose co-operation the intellect could not create science,\r\nnever fail to remind us that we are, alas! but mortals. By this\r\nincessant appeal to order, we are under the necessity of doing, not\r\nwhat we _would_, but what we _can_. And the part we really play is,\r\nconsequently, much more modest than that which we love to imagine\r\nourselves as playing.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our flowers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat see you in the little centaury which you hold in your hand?\r\n(Fig. 56.)\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a corolla with five petals of a delicate\r\nrose-hue, very pleasant to the sight.\r\n\r\nTake care! those foliola are not _petals_, if you give that name\r\nto the free parts of the corolla. Look at them thoroughly. Your\r\nfoliola are prolonged at their base in a narrow tube, which is easily\r\nremoved. If you had begun here,--if, instead of proceeding from the\r\ntop to the bottom, you had, in your analysis, proceeded from the\r\nbottom to the top, you would have acquired a wholly different view\r\nof things. You would have said that the corolla is tubular, greenish,\r\nwith a rosy limb, deeply divided into five lobes. And in so doing,\r\nyou would have run no risk of deceiving yourself. The indications\r\ngiven by Nature herself are the most precious; they are the lessons\r\nof a teacher who cannot err: never pass them by with indifference or\r\nneglect. In your study of the different parts of a vegetable, follow,\r\nas far as possible, the actual movement of the sap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--The Common Centaury.]\r\n\r\nThe calyx of our gentian has, like its corolla, the form of a\r\nfive-divided tube; which, indeed, is one of the usual characters of\r\nthe Gentian family.\r\n\r\nBut it is important here to take notice of this fact, because it\r\nis not, as at first sight you would suppose, the corolla, but the\r\ncalyx, which encircles the base of the ovary. The tube of the corolla\r\nstops towards the middle of the latter organ, and nearly on a level\r\nwith the linear divisions of the calyx. You must be careful not to\r\nconfound with these calycine divisions the green foliola which lie\r\naround the base of the flower, and which are neither more nor less\r\nthan abortive leaves.\r\n\r\nNow call to mind that the flower is an union of concentric whorls,\r\nor of rings set one within another. The _staminal_ whorl and the\r\n_carpellary_ whorl, surrounded by a double perianth (corolla and\r\ncalyx), are here composed--the first, of five stamens, and the second\r\nof a bilobed ovary, surmounted by a twisted style. We may now\r\nexamine more closely the reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nThe stamens are inserted upon the top of the tube of the corolla,\r\nand if you look at the base of their filaments you would be inclined\r\nto pronounce it a foliaceous expansion, or, rather, a metamorphic\r\ndoubling of the corolla. Suppose the stamens to be the result of the\r\ntransformation of the petals, the filament would be the \"claw,\" and\r\nthe anther the \"limb\" of a foliole. At least, theory would tell you\r\nso. But observation will show that these are not petals changing into\r\nstamens, but, on the contrary, stamens changing into petals; as is\r\nseen in the sterile (or \"double\") flowers of many of our ornamental\r\nplants, and even of some of our fruit trees. How, then, shall we\r\nconciliate theory with observation? Look, and you shall find.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nObserve the anthers which surmount the filaments. There is something\r\npeculiarly characteristic in them. As they open and spread abroad\r\nthe pollen, they visibly coil themselves up in the form of a spiral.\r\n(Fig. 58.) Owing to this twisting, they are found more or less\r\ninclined upon their filaments, and are gifted with a considerable\r\nmobility. Thoroughly to understand the relation between the\r\ncontinuous anther and the filament, we must examine the stamens\r\nbefore their expansion, while they are still folded up within the\r\nfloral bud, their matrix. The anthers are then quite straight, and,\r\nwith a magnifying-glass, you can easily see how they are inserted,\r\nby the lower part of their back, upon the top of the filament, whose\r\n(so-called) _connective_ prolongation separates the two lobes of\r\nthe pollen receptacle. The anthers are then _introrse_ (_introrsum_,\r\ninwardly)--that is to say, their face being inclined inwards, they\r\nlook towards the centre of the flower, occupied by the style, a\r\nfiliform prolongation of the ovary; the apex of the style (stigma) is\r\nthick, globulose, and of a glandular structure. The fruit, resulting\r\nfrom the metamorphosis of the ovary, is an elongated fusiform\r\ncapsule, composed of two lobes, each containing a very large number\r\nof extremely small seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Anthers of the Centaury.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe characters we have just enumerated apply, or the majority of\r\nthem, to the interesting family of the Gentianaceæ--a natural group\r\nof plants, nearly all remarkable for their bitter, febrifugal,\r\nand anti-scrofulous properties. The flowering cymes of the common\r\ncentaury are very frequently employed as a substitute for the\r\nmedicinal gentian, so well known as a valuable tonic.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal gentian is the _Gentiana lutea_,--a plant growing about\r\nthree feet high,--which thrives abundantly on the Pyrenees, and the\r\nAlps of Switzerland and Austria, at an elevation of 3000 to 5000\r\nfeet. It is not, however, so common now as formerly on the Alpine\r\nheights, owing probably to its great consumption, but it is spreading\r\ninto many districts of Central Europe.\r\n\r\nFrequent enough in the vicinity of Paris is the _Chlora perforata_,\r\na gentian remarkable for its glaucous leaves and yellow terminal\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe _Gentiana kurroo_ of the Himalayas, and the British species,\r\n_Gentiana campestris_ and _Gentiana amarella_, possess the tonic\r\nproperties of the family. The _Cheritta_ of the pharmacopœia is\r\nthe herb and root of _Agathotes chirayta_ (_Ophelia chirata_), a\r\nherbaceous plant which flourishes in the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe must not omit a reference to a Lilliputian gentian, the _filiform\r\ngentian_ of Linnæus, and the _Exacum filiforme_ or _Cicendia\r\nfiliformis_ of other botanical authorities.\r\n\r\nIts stem, from two and a half to four inches in length, is\r\nembellished with radical oblong leaves, disposed in fours, and short\r\ncaulinary leaves, opposite and linear; the corolla is yellow, the\r\ncalyx has four triangular lobes; the stamens also are four. It is\r\nthis predominant number which has induced some botanists to elevate\r\nour little gentian into a species of _Exacum_ or _Cicendia_,--two\r\ngenera, of which the first was named by Adamson, the second by De\r\nCandolle. As for the tiny _Gentiana pusilla_, or _Exacum pusillum_,\r\nwe may look upon it as a simple variety of the _Exacum filiforme_,\r\ndiffering from the latter only in its shorter and feebler stem, in\r\nthe somewhat narrower divisions of its calyx, and the tint of its\r\ncorolla, which is of a paler yellow, sometimes inclining to rose.\r\n\r\nBotanists, or lovers of flowers, may grow as passionately fond of\r\ngentians as some persons do of tulips or hyacinths. But it is not\r\nin England or Scotland, it is in the Alpine pastures of Switzerland\r\nonly, that you can hope to satisfy your _Gentianomania_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ALPINE EXCURSION.\r\n\r\nPermit me, dear reader, to set down a few hints, in case you should\r\nat any time be disposed to make a pilgrimage into the Golden Land, or\r\nEl Dorado, of botanists and geologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--An Alpine Landscape.]\r\n\r\nBefore you plunge into the Alps, you will meet, in the sub-alpine\r\nregions, among the valleys which intersect and the meadows which\r\nclothe the lower spurs of the Jura, the _Gentiana campestris_. It is\r\na plant of from five to six inches in height, whose blue, five-lobed\r\ncorolla, with its velvety gorge, changes into yellow when dried; the\r\ntwo outer teeth of the calyx are elliptical, and much larger than\r\nthe others. Your attention will hardly be drawn to this tiny gentian\r\namong the crowd of more beautiful and attractive plants blooming\r\naround it.\r\n\r\nOne excursion which you should not fail to make is the ascent\r\nof the Dent de Jaman,--the hieroglyphic summit of one of those\r\ncharming mountains which mirror themselves in the Lake of Geneva.\r\nThis classical, and, moreover, very easy ascent, has the advantage\r\nof carrying you up a series of terraces, so that the character of\r\nthe vegetation changes rapidly. The acclivity begins at the little\r\ntown of Montreux, situated near the point where the blue arrowy\r\nRhone pours its waters into the enchanted lake. From Montreux to\r\nthe village of Glion, you will be delighted to greet your old\r\nacquaintances: the familiar faces of your native fields, meadows, and\r\nwoodlands. But soon a difference in the character of the flora forces\r\nitself upon you. Species which are rarer at home become tolerably\r\ncommon, as, for instance, the yellow digitalis (_Digitalis lutea_),\r\nso easily recognised by its cymes of tiny flowers. The vulneraria\r\n(_Anthyllis vulneraria_) is as widely diffused as the trefoil in our\r\nEnglish pastures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little above Glion,--a picturesque village apparently hung over the\r\nlake--the _sub-alpine region_ commences. Around villas and mansions,\r\nnearly all inhabited by English families, you will find in abundance\r\nthe English mercury (_Chenopodium Bonus Henricus_), and in the shady\r\nhedges the narcotic Herb-Paris (_Paris quadrifolia_).\r\n\r\nThe apparition of the _Astrantia major_, which resembles an\r\nartificial or fancy-created flower, warns us that we are passing\r\nbeyond the limits of the ordinary flora. I believe that we have no\r\nrepresentative in England of that singular umbellifer. The Alpine\r\npastures of the narrow-ridged Mount Caü, which resembles the back\r\nof a dromedary, exhale a fragrance like that of the famous Swiss\r\ntea, so much extolled as a remedy against cholera. The odour of the\r\nhay-lofts attached to the châlets--true shepherd's huts--which rise\r\nat intervals along the back of Mont Dromedary, is so penetrating\r\nas to produce headache. The hay owes its aromatic fragrance to the\r\nmusk-chervil (_Myrrhis odorata_), whose strong stems form such thick\r\nluxuriant pasturages; to various orchideæ, particularly to the\r\n_Nigritella suaveolens_, remarkable for the intense colour--nearly\r\nblack--of its flowers; and finally, to the gentians, whose scent is\r\nstrongly brought out by drying.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rich close sward which borders on the Dent de Jaman provides\r\nthe herboriser with more than one agreeable surprise. You will be\r\nstruck by the beauty of the flowery tufts of the _Linaria Alpina_,\r\nrejoicing in a deep sapphire blue. You will also have an opportunity\r\nof making acquaintance with a campanula which is abundant on Mont\r\nCenis (_Campanula Cœnisia_); its beautiful terminal flower, of a\r\npale blue, is characterised by the long hairs which line the opening\r\nof the corolla.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the gentians, those great ornaments of the Alpine pasturages,\r\nwe shall direct the attention of our readers to--\r\n\r\nThe purple gentian (_Gentiana purpurea_), and the spotted gentian\r\n(_Gentiana punctata_). These are distinguished by their plentiful\r\nappearance: their large oval leaves, and the height of their vigorous\r\nstems, recall those of the yellow gentian. The features which\r\nseparate these two species are not very distinct: the corolla of the\r\nformer is purple without and yellow within; that of the latter is of\r\na bright yellow, marked by spots of deep purple, which, however, are\r\nnot permanent; the calyx is campanulated, with upright and lanceolate\r\nfoliola.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Gentiana acaulis_ contrasts singularly with the preceding\r\nspecies, its stem being so short that one is almost tempted to deny\r\nthe existence of any; its large corollas, of a bright celestial blue,\r\nlie on the ground as if they had fallen fresh from a bouquet. We must\r\nnot confound this species with the _Gentiana pumila_, a much smaller\r\nplant, with a very elongated calyx, which grows abundantly on the\r\nturf of Mont St Bernard.\r\n\r\nThe _Gentiana verna_ and the _Gentiana nivalis_, with a corolla of\r\nthe finest azure, inhabit the loftiest points of the Alps, where all\r\nvegetation begins to disappear. The former, or the gentian of spring,\r\nflowers, in these frozen regions, in June and July; it is one of\r\ntwenty-four phanerogamous plants of the last vegetable station of\r\nMont Blanc. This station is formed by a series of vertical layers of\r\nprotogene, which separates the upper part of the Glacier des Bossons\r\nfrom that of Taconay. The débris of the rock, decomposed under the\r\ninfluence of atmospheric agencies, form, in the midst of the _nevé_,\r\ntiny flowering parterres--oases in the desert, islands in the vast\r\nocean of ice and snow. There, sheltered by the rocks, and warmed by\r\nthe sun, and refreshed by the snow, which rapidly melts in summer,\r\nthese pretty plants thrive and grow beautiful, though their brief\r\nexistence is summed up in a few short weeks.\r\n\r\nAccording to Charles Martins, the phanerogamous plants which flourish\r\nat an elevation of 10,000 feet are the following:--\r\n\r\n      _Mean temperature, 47° to 36°._\r\n\r\n    1. Gentiana verna.\r\n    2. Silena acaulis.\r\n    3. Draba frigida.[66]\r\n    4. Draba fladnizensis.\r\n    5. Cardamine bellidifolia.\r\n    6. Cardamine resedifolia.\r\n    7. Potentilla frigida.\r\n    8. Phyteuma hemisphericum.\r\n    9. Pyrethrum Alpinum.\r\n    10. Erigeron uniflorum.\r\n    11. Saxifraga bryoides.\r\n    12. Saxifraga Groenlandica.\r\n    13. Saxifraga muscoides.\r\n    14. Saxifraga oppositifolia.\r\n    15. Androsace Helvetica.\r\n    16. Androsace pubescens.\r\n    17. Lazula spicata.\r\n    18. Festuca Halleri.\r\n    19. Poa laxa.[67]\r\n    20. Poa cæsia.\r\n    21. Poa Alpina.\r\n    22. Trisetum subspicatum.\r\n    23. Agrostis rupestris.\r\n    24. Carex nigra (Cariceæ).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIMPERNEL.\r\n\r\nAccompany me to the corn-field; not for any discourse upon the state\r\nand prospect of the crops, or on the comparative value to man of\r\nwheat or barley, but for the sake of the little red flower which\r\nshines like a star among the growing harvest.\r\n\r\nYou cannot mistake it, for, with the exception of the tiny\r\nchaff-weed, the smallest wild plant which bears a distinct flower,\r\nit is the only scarlet blossom in the wheat-field, except, indeed,\r\nthe red poppy, which every good farmer seeks to banish from his land.\r\nMark me,--I say the only _scarlet_ flower; for there are several--as,\r\nfor instance, the pheasant's eye, or Adonis--of a deep crimson.\r\n\r\nThe pimpernel belongs to the Primrose family, or Primulaceæ. It has\r\na five-cleft calyx, and a monopetalous corolla. Its stamens, of an\r\nequal number, are inserted on the corolla, opposite its segments.\r\nIt is a _meteoric_ flower; so-called, because it keeps itself shut\r\nduring wet or cloudy weather. Hence, it is known among country people\r\nas \"the shepherd's warning\" or \"poor man's weather-glass.\" And\r\nDarwin, enumerating the various signs of rain, says of it--\r\n\r\n    \"Closed is the pink-eyed pimpernel;\r\n    In fiery red the sun doth rise,\r\n    Then wades through clouds to mount the skies:\r\n    'Twill surely rain, we see 't with sorrow;\r\n    No working in the fields to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be added, however, that if the rain continue for several\r\ndays, the pimpernel will lose its sensibility, and cease to act as a\r\nnatural weather-glass.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may observe, that singular as is the habit of the flowers\r\nanticipating rain by folding their petals within their calices,\r\nthe way which the Siberian sow-thistle has with it is still more\r\ncurious. This plant, during that clear weather which most flowers\r\naffect, keeps entirely shut; but as soon as a thick mist overspreads\r\nthe earth, or a cloud obscures the bright face of heaven, it begins\r\nto open its light blue corolla.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows, or should know, that when the robin looks sad and\r\ndrooping, and ceases to greet you with his wonted blithesome strain,\r\n\"foul weather\" is at hand. Many animals, by their peculiar habits,\r\nafford equally certain indications of approaching atmospheric changes.\r\n\r\nThis does not seem strange to us; we account for it by the instinct\r\nwhich every animal possesses, in a larger or smaller degree. But the\r\nsame anticipatory faculty is possessed by several plants; they feel\r\nthe increasing moisture of the air long before it can be detected by\r\nourselves. Thus, when a storm is at hand, some species of anemones\r\nfold up their blossoms; the fragrant flowers of the wild pink\r\nconvolvulus wind themselves together; the awns of the wild oat, and\r\nthe sweet-scented meadow-grass, stand in an erect position, and the\r\nclover leaves are drawn closely up.\r\n\r\nNaturalists, says Pratt, are unable to discover why some plants\r\nshould be affected by moisture and others not; but the regular\r\nchanges of these natural barometers seem a providential arrangement\r\nto supply certain wants of the flowers in which they occur. We may\r\ndraw this inference from the different positions of several flowers\r\naccording to their circumstances. Thus the poppy, when in bud, hangs\r\ndown on its stem, and preserves its petals from rain and wind; but\r\nas soon as it is fully developed, and has acquired strength, and\r\nthe sun's rays are necessary to perfect its colours, it expands to\r\nthe full light of day. The violet, again, while its seed is forming,\r\nshades the capsule by its purple corolla; but as soon as the seeds\r\nare ripe, and they are required to spring to some distance from\r\ntheir capsules, the flower immediately rises up with the cup for\r\nits support, and flings abroad its offering on the earth's maternal\r\nbosom. Adaptations of this kind are frequent and striking in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, and surely one is justified in regarding them as\r\nthe work of an all-powerful and all-wise Creative Mind. Look, for\r\ninstance, at the orchis: it grows on the ground in Europe, and is\r\nconsequently provided with roots formed of large lobes; but when it\r\nfestoons the pillar of the virgin forests of the New World, its roots\r\nare formed of a number of fibres, so that they may penetrate the bark\r\nof the tree.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our pimpernel. It was at one time called\r\n_Centunculus_, from _cento_, a covering, because it spread in\r\nsuch abundance over the cultivated fields. Its botanical name was\r\nafterwards changed to _Anagallis arvensis_. _Anagallis_ signifies\r\n\"to laugh,\" and there existed an old belief that a decoction of the\r\npimpernel acted as a remedy against melancholy, and a provocative of\r\nmirth.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of this plant are very numerous. They are enclosed in small\r\ncapsules, and eaten by the birds.\r\n\r\nThere is only one other _British_ species of pimpernel, the\r\n_Anagallis linetta_, or bog pimpernel, which it would be unpardonable\r\nif the botanist omitted to notice, so delicately beautiful are\r\nits pale-rose blossoms and tiny clusters of leaves. As its name\r\nindicates, it is found only in marshy localities.\r\n\r\nThe blue pimpernel (_Anagallis cerulea_), though not a native of\r\nEngland, is found occasionally. It is described as growing in\r\nbeautiful little tufts about the hills of Madeira, and enlivening\r\nthem by its cheerful colour, which may bear comparison with the azure\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--\"The Wheat-field, with its mass of emerald\r\nwaves.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd here we will take leave of the wheat-field, with its mass of\r\nemerald waves, now beginning to wear a golden glory on their crests,\r\nas they ripple in the genial sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\n_The Mole, the Staphylinus, and the Mole-Cricket._\r\n\r\nDo you hear that noise? It seems to issue from beneath yonder heap of\r\npebbles at the foot of the garden-wall. Surely the stones are moving;\r\nthey seem to be walking alone, and of their own impulse, for I cannot\r\nsee anything to set them in motion.\r\n\r\nLet us draw near and examine the mystery. \"Ah, what a hideous black\r\ncreature!\" It is retreating in a terrible state of alarm, as if it\r\nfelt itself pursued by some formidable enemy.\r\n\r\nThis \"hideous creature\" is known to French gardeners by the name of\r\n_courtilière_; to naturalists, as a species of _Staphylinus_. (Fig.\r\n61.) Its great and persistent adversary is the mole: a mammal at war\r\nwith an insect!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--The _Staphylinus olens_.]\r\n\r\nWatch well, I pray you, the mole's movements, which you can do\r\nthe more easily that here, contrary to his ordinary custom, he is\r\nwandering in the open day; the light blinds him,--accustomed as he\r\nis to pass his life in the subterranean galleries which he excavates\r\nby his own labour. But if he does not see us, he hears us; the sound\r\nof our footsteps was sufficient to make him prick up his ears (if\r\nwe may so speak of a mole), and he remains motionless. Do not stir,\r\nor he will betake himself to flight, and we shall lose an excellent\r\nopportunity of being present at a very curious spectacle.\r\n\r\nHe is now reassured. He recommences his manœuvres, pushing before\r\nhim every little pebble which he meets with. For this purpose\r\nhe employs his elongated snout, exactly as a pig grubs among\r\nthe uncleanness of his sty. But his next movements are not of a\r\nporcine character. With feet broad as battledores, the mole, while\r\nmanœuvring with his nose, quietly pushes aside every clod which\r\nthreatens to obstruct his progress. These sidelong, abrupt, and\r\njerking movements remind you of those of a dog, seeking with his\r\npaws to enlarge the opening of the burrow wherein a rabbit has\r\ntaken refuge. The mole has thus the habit of a hunting-dog; and, to\r\ncomplete the resemblance, he stops at intervals in his scratching,\r\nand shakes the dust off his head. One is quite surprised to see\r\na little mammal executing the movements we are wont to regard as\r\npeculiar to an animal much larger than he is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe beetle quits in affright the heap of stones where it had hoped to\r\nfind an asylum; it now crosses our path, holding itself erect, with a\r\nmenacing air, and its tail armed with a forked barb. The mole follows\r\nin close pursuit: who would have believed he could run so quickly?\r\nLet us bar his passage, and study him at our leisure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first thing we remark is his glossy hair, which is softer to the\r\ntouch than the finest velvet. Where are his eyes? Blow aside the hair\r\nwhich covers his face. There they are, and they resemble miniature\r\npearls of a shining black.\r\n\r\nHow could Aristotle say that the mole had no eyes? To believe it\r\nyou must read the assertion for yourself. And here are the very\r\nwords of the authority who, for so many centuries, was accepted as\r\ninfallible:--\r\n\r\n\"All viviparous animals have eyes, _except the mole_\" (πλὴν\r\nἀσπάλακος).\r\n\r\nThen, as if a sudden doubt had seized him, and he were frightened\r\nat his own statement, the illustrious Stagyrite hastens to add: \"We\r\nmight, perhaps, strictly admit that he has.\" But another change comes\r\nover the spirit of the philosopher's dream; his hesitation vanishes,\r\nand he immediately repeats and justifies his former assertion in\r\nthese terms:--\r\n\r\n\"But, carefully considered, the mole does _not see_, because he has\r\nno apparent eyes externally\" (ὅλως μὲν γὰρ οὔθ' ὁρᾷ,\r\nοὔτ' ἔχει εἰς τὸ φανερὸν δήλους\r\nὀφθαλμούς).[68]\r\n\r\nThese last words denote--I beg pardon of the manes of a great\r\nphilosopher--an absolute want of observation. Evidently, Aristotle\r\nhad not taken the trouble to _look_ before he made his statement. And\r\ndo not think that this curious indifference was peculiar to the great\r\nmaster of the Peripatetic School; it characterises more or less all\r\nthe philosophers of antiquity, as well as too many who have followed\r\nin their footsteps.\r\n\r\nPliny has simply translated Aristotle when he says:--\"Among\r\nquadrupeds the moles are wanting in the sense of sight\" (_quadrupedum\r\ntalpis visus non est_).[69]\r\n\r\nBut it is a curious thing that both Aristotle and Pliny maintain,\r\nthat if you lift up the skin where the eyes _ought_ to be, you will\r\nperceive the organs of vision. How could they remove the skin without\r\ndistinguishing in it the eyes, like black and brilliant beads? Did\r\nthey practise anatomy, like their own imaginary mole, without eyes?\r\nThe whole matter would be inexplicable if we did not take into\r\naccount that force of inertia which binds man in chains of iron, in\r\nthe moral world as well as in the physical.\r\n\r\nTo see, to observe; to retrace one's steps, that one may see and\r\nobserve more distinctly; is a labour repugnant to the human mind.\r\nTo create systems, in order that he may proclaim himself a great\r\ndoctrinal teacher, is the work which flatters man, or the creative\r\npower of his imagination. Centuries of effort are needed before he\r\ncan disentangle himself from his self-woven thrall in presence of the\r\nphenomena of nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA striking peculiarity in the mole's structure is his hands, or\r\nfeet, with their five fingers, or toes, turned outward, and their\r\ncurious resemblance to the human hand. Few animals exhibit a similar\r\nconformation. Everything in the structure of the fore-limbs indicates\r\nthe animal's burrowing instinct,--the length of the bone, which\r\ncorresponds to the human _radius_, or fore-arm,--the breadth of the\r\nhands,--and the bend of the arms, which are so fashioned that the\r\nelbows project outwardly.\r\n\r\nDoes the mole's burrowing instinct lead it in quest of insects or of\r\nvegetable roots?\r\n\r\nAccording to the old traditional belief, the mole feeds upon\r\nroots. From time immemorial, it has been looked upon as an animal\r\nso destructive, that, in every country, its destruction has been\r\nencouraged by large rewards. Well, this belief, transmitted from\r\ngeneration to generation, owes, like so many other traditions, its\r\nauthority to its antiquity, and is devoid of foundation.\r\n\r\nThe mole is an essentially carnivorous animal, and no more lives\r\nupon roots than the dog or the cat. He is pre-eminently the hunter\r\nof the white-worm and beetle; and therefore, instead of vowing its\r\nextermination, we ought to take every possible means to preserve and\r\nmultiply his race. These absurd traditions and credulous notions,\r\nwholly without any experimental confirmation, frequently lead us to\r\ntake steps in diametrical opposition to our own interests.\r\n\r\nMoles are particularly partial to meadows which are somewhat damp,\r\nas, for instance, those where the leafless colchicum displays, in\r\nautumn, its pale-rose flowers. In summer, the fields are covered\r\nwith mole-hills. It will be said, perhaps, that these conical heaps\r\nof earth are injurious to vegetation. But that will be an error,\r\ncontradicted by observation. Meadows besprinkled with mole-hills\r\ngrow excellent hay, if care be taken to level them; for the earth\r\nthus distributed serves as manure. If they are visited by the moles,\r\nit is because these animals find there a plentiful supply of the\r\n_rhizophagous_ (root-eating) insects, on which they feed.\r\n\r\nThe forest is also a favourite haunt of the moles. Apparently they\r\nfind, under the layers of leaves and roots, so rich in larvæ of\r\nevery kind, the wherewithal to satisfy amply their insectivorous\r\ntastes. It is the mole which generally produces that rustling of\r\nthe dry leaves the wanderer is so apt to attribute to a snake or an\r\nadder. Stand still for a moment, and patiently watch. Do you see that\r\nundulatory movement? Thrust your stick rapidly into the uplifted\r\nheap. There is our persevering hunter; he struggles hard to escape\r\nfrom his terrible enemy, but, with a little alacrity, you will not\r\nfind it difficult to capture him.\r\n\r\nMoles are among the most prolific of mammals; and, in fact, were it\r\nnot so, their race would have been long ago exterminated. We may,\r\nperhaps, venture to say, that by multiplying so prodigiously, they\r\nwish to do us a service in spite of ourselves. How tender is the\r\nsolicitude of nature for the ungrateful human species!\r\n\r\nTo see the marvellous qualities ascribed to the mole by the ancients,\r\none would suppose that they had made him the object of their special\r\nstudy. Yet, as we have shown, they could never have watched his\r\nhabits with any degree of patience. They saw everything through the\r\ndelusive prism of their imagination. As a proof, we will tell you\r\nwhat they said of the mole.\r\n\r\n\"Since this animal has been doomed to a perpetual blindness, and\r\nlives interred beneath the surface of the earth, like the dead, he\r\npossesses, by way of compensation, some extraordinary qualities.\r\nHis subterranean existence renders him, of all animals, the most\r\ncapable of religion (_nullum religionis capacius animal_). To acquire\r\nthe gift of second-sight, you must eat the heart of a mole, while\r\nstill beating, and freshly plucked from the animal's body. To cure\r\ntoothache, suspend to your neck the tooth of a live mole. Lymphatic\r\npeople will gain in strength if sprinkled with a mole's blood. The\r\nashes of a mole are a sovereign remedy for scrofula; some recommend\r\nfor this disease the animal's liver, others the right foot, and\r\nothers the head. The earth of mole-hills, fashioned into pastilles,\r\nand preserved in a tin box, is an excellent cure for all kinds of\r\ntumours, and especially for abscesses on the neck.\"[70]\r\n\r\nSuch, according to Pliny's report, are the virtues of the mole, as\r\ntaught by the Magi. The Middle Ages adopted this teaching, and even\r\nto-day, in obscure rural districts, you will meet with superstitious\r\nnotions which remind you of the ideas of the ancient wise men and\r\nnecromancers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nWe have thus summarised the natural history of our _hunter_, let us\r\nnow say a few words respecting the _game_ he pursues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe insect before us is the _Staphylinus olens_. Its study has been\r\nmuch neglected, probably on account of its repulsive appearance.\r\nBut, conquering our repugnance, let us take the creature between\r\nour forefinger and thumb. See how vigorously it defends itself! Its\r\nforked appendage is not formidable, it is too soft; but take care of\r\nits mandibles! With these hard, horny, pointed pincers, it pricks the\r\nskin and draws blood. Now, bring your nose close to the frightful\r\nblack insect at the very moment when it appears the most irritated.\r\nCome! A little courage will conquer your new feeling of disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat do you smell?\r\n\r\nA pleasant odour of rennet apples! It reminds me of that diffused\r\nby another insect, much less ugly than your _Staphylinus_, the\r\n_Cicondela campestris_.\r\n\r\nIt is this peculiarity which explains the specific name of\r\n\"odorous\" (_olens_) given to your captive. As for its generic name,\r\n_Staphylinus_, I have no means of interpreting its etymology; for the\r\ninsect's shape has no resemblance to that of a bunch or cluster,--in\r\nGreek, ςταφυλή. But this last word also signifies the _uvula_, and,\r\nperhaps, by the effort of a little imagination, the naturalist may\r\ntrace a similitude between that organ of the throat and the body of\r\nthe _Staphylinus_.\r\n\r\nThe _Staphylini_ are characterised by a very narrow neck, which\r\nseparates, as by a kind of web, the head from the thorax. In\r\ndiffusing the peculiar odour of which we have just spoken, they\r\nsimultaneously eject a musky volatile liquid contained in two\r\nretractile whitish bladders, situated near the anus. They run\r\nquickly, elevating their abdomen like the earwig. The antennæ,\r\ninserted in the rear of the strong mandibles, are each composed\r\nof eleven articulations, of which the first is the longest; these\r\njoints, rounded in form, are arranged like the beads of a necklace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Staphylini belong to that numerous section of insects whose\r\n_tarsi_ are composed of five articulations, and which have thence\r\nreceived the name of Pentaceii.\r\n\r\nIn this section they form, with some other genera, the family of\r\n_Brachelytræ_, so called because their elytra, or wing-sheaths, are\r\nmuch shorter than the abdomen.\r\n\r\nOur _Staphylinus olens_ is finely punctuated, somewhat hairy, and\r\nof a dull black colour. Though very common in our gardens, and\r\nwherever any putrefying substances are to be found, its habits\r\nare not very well known. For if it were generally understood that\r\nit is an essentially carnivorous animal, that it carries on a\r\ndetermined warfare against the caterpillar, larvæ, and especially the\r\nwhite-worm, far from seeking to destroy it, men would surely attempt\r\nto increase its numbers. It is a proof that the Staphylini are useful\r\ninsects, that they are rare in seasons when the white-worms abound,\r\nas was the case, for example, in the years 1867 and 1868. The larva\r\nof the Staphylinus is as carnivorous as the perfect insect, which it\r\nlikewise resembles in form.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: in every phase of their existence, the Staphylini render\r\nimmense services to the agriculturist. It is very desirable that\r\nthis fact should be generally recognised, and their rehabilitation\r\ngenerally proclaimed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOLE-CRICKET.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the mole-cricket are nearly the same as those of the\r\nmole. When winter approaches, it takes refuge underneath the surface\r\nof the earth, and remains benumbed and lethargic in its nest so long\r\nas the cold lasts. On the welcome return of spring, it makes its way\r\nback to the light by a vertical gallery, on which a great number of\r\nlateral galleries abut, the said lateral galleries being the roads\r\nit travels in pursuit of its prey. This subterranean work it executes\r\nwith its strong fore-feet, which are broad, and unguiculated, or\r\nindented, much like those of a mole. Hence its popular name of the\r\n_mole-cricket_ (Fig. 62, _a_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.]\r\n\r\nThese insects (of the _Orthoptera_ order) belong to the small family\r\nof the crickets--a family closely akin to that of the grasshoppers.\r\nThis close kinship has been recognised by the poets, and we find\r\nthem brought together in a very charming sonnet, which cannot be\r\ntoo frequently perused by any reader, and which may therefore be\r\nintroduced as a relief to our duller prose:--\r\n\r\n    \"Green little vaulter in the sunny grass,\r\n      Catching your heart up at the feel of June,\r\n      Sole voice that's heard amidst the lazy noon,\r\n    When even the bees lag at the summoning brass;\r\n    And you, warm little housekeeper, who class\r\n      With those who think the candles come too soon,\r\n      Loving the fire, and with your tricksome tune\r\n    Nick the glad silent moments as they pass;\r\n    Oh, sweet and tiny cousins, that belong,\r\n      One to the fields, the other to the hearth,\r\n    Both have your sunshine; both, though small, are strong\r\n      At your clear hearts; and both were sent on earth\r\n    To sing in thoughtful ears this natural song--\r\n      Indoors and out, summer and winter, mirth.\"\r\n\r\nSo sings Leigh Hunt--a poet, by the way, whose heart was ever open\r\nat \"the feel of June,\" and whose genial writings, whether prose or\r\nverse, whether delightful essays or melodious songs, should be read\r\nin the \"happy summer-time,\" when the idler, reclining on the sunny\r\ngrass, with the beauty of an English landscape around him, wants the\r\ncompanionship of a gentle spirit and a refined and healthy intellect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--The idler, reclining on the sunny grass.]\r\n\r\nThe mole-cricket is, like the grasshopper, a child of summer. It\r\ndiffers, moreover, from the \"cricket on the hearth\" in lacking those\r\norgans of _stridulation_ (excuse the word, kind reader!) which\r\nmark \"the glad silent moments\" with their tricksome (and sometimes\r\ninconvenient) tune. Their posterior thighs have an apparent bulging\r\nabout them, but the legs are very short; so short, that our little\r\nfriend could not compete with its cousin, the grasshopper, in\r\nvaulting exercises, even were it not otherwise prevented by its large\r\nabdomen. Nor is it much assisted by its wings, for though they are\r\nbroad, they are not organised for rapid flight, and the mole-cricket\r\nmakes but little use of them. Nature, however, has compensated it\r\nfor all these disadvantages by the gift of those strong, powerful,\r\nflexible fore-feet of which I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe species generally met with in gardens, corn-fields, and orchards\r\nis the _Gryllotalpa vulgaris_ of Latreille, identical with the\r\n_Gryllus gryllotalpa_ of Linnæus. It has a brown head, garnished with\r\nrusty-coloured mandibles; the thorax is of a brownish-gray, velvety,\r\ntinged with red in the fore parts; the elytra, or wing-sheaths, which\r\nare much shorter than the abdomen, are gray, and marked by black and\r\nconspicuously prominent nerves; the wings, folded back like a fan,\r\nare about one-fourth longer than the abdomen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mole-cricket,--mark me!--is no more of a root-eater than the\r\nmole; it is carnivorous, like the Staphylinus. As an experiment in\r\nconfirmation of this statement, we shut up one of these curious\r\nOrthopteras in a large chest filled with mould. Concealed in the\r\ngalleries which it speedily constructed for its use, it fed upon\r\nlarvæ, and never touched the cereals which we had sown in the earth.\r\nHere was a proof that we had to plead the cause of another of man's\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nThe mole-cricket ejects, when pursued or tormented, a blackish\r\nliquid, whose etherealised odour reminds one of the peculiar smell\r\nof certain rotten apples. The female, larger than the male, lays\r\nher eggs, which are, comparatively speaking, of a tolerable size\r\n(Fig. 62, _b_), at some depth underground. The young, when hatched,\r\nresemble their parents, except that they are white, and possess\r\nmerely the rudiments of wings.\r\n\r\nIf the mole-cricket, in its subterranean progress, encounters any\r\nroots, it cuts them with its mandibles, not to feed upon them, but\r\nto get rid of an obstacle; hence the mischief of which the farmer\r\naccuses it, though this slight amount of injury is altogether\r\noutweighed by its services in destroying a swarm of insects.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, therefore, we must not blame the farmer for the hostility\r\nwith which he pursues it, especially if we are to accept as a true\r\npicture of its doings the sketch recently drawn by a popular writer:--\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to understand that an insect which undermines land in\r\nthis way must cause great damage to cultivation (!). Whether the\r\ncrops serve it for food or not, they are not the less destroyed by\r\nits underground burrowings. Lands infested by the mole-cricket are\r\nrecognisable by the colour of the vegetation, which is yellow and\r\nwithered; and the rubbish which these miners heap up at the side of\r\nthe openings leading to their galleries, resembling mole-hills in\r\nminiature, betrays their presence to the farmer.\"\r\n\r\nIf, I say, this be a true picture, we cannot wonder at the means\r\nemployed by the farmer to clear his fields of such dangerous tenants.\r\nThe plan generally adopted is to dig, at intervals, a number of\r\nlittle trenches, which are filled up with cow-dung, well trodden\r\ndown. The supposed root-eaters assemble in these warm nests; and\r\nevery fourth or fifth day, a labourer, armed with a pitchfork, scoops\r\nup the manure at a single stroke, and scatters it over the ground,\r\nwhile another crushes the unfortunate _Gryllotalpæ_ as fast as they\r\nmake their appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARWIG.\r\n\r\nNext to the domestic fly, the earwig is, perhaps, one of our\r\ncommonest, and, let us add, one of our most troublesome, insects.\r\nWhence comes its popular appellation? From a mere fable. To amuse\r\nthe silly--alas! how great their number!--marvelling, without doubt,\r\nat the spectacle of an insect's tail armed with strong pincers, some\r\njester wished to transform it into a terrible animal; and therefore\r\nhe pretended that it introduced itself into the human ear, and from\r\nthence penetrated to the brain, with the view of driving out its\r\nproprietor,--_i.e._, the mind or spirit which animates it. Only,\r\nthe originator of this absurd bugbear forgot one little fact: there\r\nis no opening by which the ear can communicate with the brain! As\r\nfor the pincers, they are not so formidable as they appear. This\r\ncharacter, however, has been considered a sufficient foundation\r\nby the naturalists, even by Linnæus himself, for the insect's\r\nscientific name, _Forficula auricularia_, which is almost literally\r\ntranslated by the French _oreille-pince_,--our English _earwig_ or\r\n_ear-piercer_. (Fig. 64.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--The Earwig (_Forficula auricularia_).]\r\n\r\nWhat dress is to man, their wings are to insects; by these\r\nwe distinguish them, at the first glance, from one another.\r\nThe elytra,--those horny sheaths which protect the membranous\r\nwings,--embrace, in the Coleoptera, the entire upper surface of the\r\nlong annulated abdomen, and resemble vari-coloured _chlamydes_. But\r\nnow, look for the elytra of our Forficula. You will hardly believe\r\nthat they are represented by this kind of abbreviated light-brown\r\njacket, which does not extend below the middle of the back. Do you\r\nobserve yonder whitish spots? They indicate the tips of the wings,\r\nwhich are longer than their covers. Lift up one of the elytra with\r\nyour penknife, and you will find that the wing which it partly\r\nscreens is worth your attention. The fore part (we should call it\r\nthe _upper_, if the animal walked erect like a man) is straight, and\r\nwithout a fold. Raise it with a pin to see the posterior or lower\r\npart. Observe, it curves underneath so as to bind the intermediate\r\nportion like a fan. But this flabelliform wing,--of tolerable\r\ndimensions when unfolded,--seems intended by the Creative Thought\r\nonly to mark its unity of plan: the earwig does not fly,--it secures\r\nits food by crawling.\r\n\r\nThe elytra and the wings, inconspicuous as they are, produced so\r\ngreat an impression on the early naturalists, that they made them\r\nthe principal characteristics of an entire order of insects. De\r\nGeer, a celebrated Swedish naturalist, named them the _Dermaptera_\r\n(from δέρμα, skin, and πτερόν, wing), in allusion to the\r\ntransparent skin-like appearance of the elytra. This name, though\r\nadopted by Kirby, has not been preserved. A French entomologist\r\nsuggested the designation which is now in use,--_Orthoptera_ (from\r\nὀρθός, straight, and πτερόν),--referring to the manner in\r\nwhich the wings are folded underneath the elytra.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere we must pause to recapitulate for the benefit of our younger\r\nreaders, and to avoid confusion, the various orders into which the\r\ninsect world is divided.\r\n\r\n1. _Aptera_ (from α, without, and πτερόν, a wing),--wingless.\r\nExamples--Flea, louse, chigo.\r\n\r\n2. _Diptera_ (δίς, two, and πτερόν),--two-winged. Sub-divided\r\ninto Nemocera, having six-jointed antennæ; Brachycera, having\r\nthree-jointed antennæ. Examples--Gnat, tipula; May-fly, gad-fly.\r\n\r\n3. _Hemiptera_ (ἕμι, half, and πτερόν),--half-winged.\r\nSub-divided into Heteroptera, with wings of different textures;\r\nHomoptera, with wings of one substance. Examples--Land-bug, water-bug;\r\ncicada, lantern-fly.\r\n\r\n4. _Lepidoptera_ (λεπίς, a scale, and πτερόν),--scaly-winged.\r\nExamples--Tiger-moth, butterfly, silkworm.\r\n\r\n5. _Orthoptera_ (ὀρθός, straight, and\r\nπτερόν),--straight-winged. Examples--Earwig, cockroach,\r\nlocust.\r\n\r\n6. _Stymenoptera_ (ὑμήν, a membrane, and\r\nπτερόν),--membranous-winged. Examples--Bee, wasp, ant.\r\n\r\n7. _Neuroptera_ (νευρόν, nerve, and πτερόν),--nerve-marked\r\nwings. Examples--Dragon-fly, caddis-fly, ant-lin.\r\n\r\n8. _Strepsiptera_ (στρεψις, a twisting, and πτερόν),--curled\r\nor twisted wings. Examples--Xenos, elenchus.\r\n\r\n9. _Coleoptera_ (κολεός, a sheath, and πτερόν),--sheathed\r\nwings. Examples--Beetle, cockchafer.\r\n\r\nThe order of _Orthoptera_, with which we are now concerned, is not\r\nvery well known. The reason is, perhaps, that the insects belonging\r\nto it--earwigs, cockroaches, grasshoppers, crickets--are not less\r\ndisagreeable than useless, so far as man is concerned. Being nearly\r\nall of them omnivorous, like man himself, they frequently aid him,\r\nvery much against his inclination, in the consumption of natural\r\nproducts of every kind.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the species of great animals are far fewer\r\nin number than those of the little. This remark applies with peculiar\r\nforce to the Orthoptera, which do not include nearly so many small\r\nspecies as the Coleoptera.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earwig is the type of the tiny group of the Forficulidæ, of\r\nwhich two species only are known to the common world--the _Forficula\r\nauricularia_ and the _Forficula minor_.\r\n\r\nThe first species everybody is acquainted with. We have already\r\nspoken of its elytra and its wings; but we now say a word upon the\r\ntwo extremities of its body. The two antennæ, which crown the head,\r\nare extremely mobile, owing, of course, to the numerous articulations\r\nof which they are made up. These are fourteen in number (if we\r\ninclude the base, which is itself composed of two movable parts). In\r\nreality, however, there are but twelve; for we ought to eliminate\r\nthe base,--because, in form and size, it differs greatly from\r\narticulations properly so called,--and, at the same time, to regard\r\nas one the articulation or joint inserted in it. In fine, I am of\r\nopinion, contrary to the general conclusion, that the antennæ of the\r\nearwig consist but of twelve articulations, bristling with hairs,\r\nand easily counted almost by the unassisted eye. With the help of a\r\nmicroscope, the observer can easily distinguish the large nervure\r\ntraversing them from top to bottom, and communicating to the antennæ\r\ntheir characteristic sensibility and mobility.\r\n\r\nThe brownish-coloured abdomen, composed of imbricated rings, forms,\r\nin itself alone, upwards of half the body. The animal can move itself\r\nin every direction; can bend and twist like a young eel. To the last\r\nof its rings, which is larger than the others, are attached the two\r\ncurved branches of the forceps (_forficula_). These are weapons of\r\ndefence rather than of attack. At the same time, they are useful as\r\na sexual distinction. The forceps of the male are strongly arched,\r\nand furnished with indentations perfectly visible to the naked eye\r\n(see Fig. 64, _a_); those of the female are scarcely bent at all, and\r\ntheir indentations can only be seen with the microscope. In numerous\r\nindividuals, the last ring of the abdomen is provided with four\r\ntubercles, one in each side and two in the middle; but this is not a\r\nuniform characteristic.\r\n\r\nThe earwig is a _trimeral_ insect; that is, its tarsi are each\r\ncomposed of three joints. Its mandibles are comparatively weak. The\r\nmoment you touch it, the insect raises, with great quickness, the\r\nextremity of its supple body, and endeavours to defend itself with\r\nits pincers. The female lays her eggs chiefly in the chinks and\r\ncrannies of time-worn timber, and the larvæ issuing from them do not\r\ndiffer, in any material respect, from the perfect insect. (See Fig.\r\n64, _b_.)\r\n\r\nThe small species, known as _Forficula minor_, is not very common.\r\nIt is about half the size of its better-known congener, and is also\r\ndistinguished from it by its joints, ten in number,--by its legs,\r\nof a very pale yellow,--and by its pincers, which are not only very\r\nshort, but almost straight, and scarcely marked, even in the male,\r\nwith any indentations. More, the wings are of the colour of the\r\nelytra, and without any white spots. This species is chiefly met with\r\nin the spring-time, and then in damp sandy localities, near ponds and\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother, and still rarer species, to which we may permit ourselves\r\nan allusion, has yellow pincers, rather black at the extremity,\r\nand garnished inside, towards the middle, with a horny tubercular\r\nprojection. In the Pyrenees a species has been found which has no\r\nwings at all, and has therefore been named _Forficula aptera_.\r\n\r\nOur readers will now inquire, What is the use of this curiously\r\nconstructed animal? Is it not an abomination to the gardener? Well,\r\nwe admit that it eats up the leaves of his plants, and the petals of\r\nhis flowers, especially of the dahlia; but, on the other hand, it\r\ndestroys those far more injurious insects, _thrips_, _aphis_, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nBut it has a peculiar interest for the scientific student from the\r\npoint of view of what we may call its _muscular dynamometry_,--its\r\npower of traction, which is far superior to that of our strongest\r\nquadrupeds.\r\n\r\nDo you doubt the truth of this assertion? Try, then, the following\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nFasten to the insect's pincer, or forceps, with a thread, a\r\nhalfpenny, which will weigh about two grains, while the weight of\r\nits body, on an average, will not exceed five centigrammes. Give\r\nthe insect free course over a sheet of paper, and you will see it\r\ndrag along the coin like a light chariot. Our animal is, therefore,\r\ncapable of drawing a burden fifty times heavier than its own body.\r\nA man of eleven stone would, in the same ratio, be able to drag\r\n7700 lbs. Neither man nor horse can enter, in this respect, into\r\ncompetition with the earwig. If all the members of the animal kingdom\r\nwere classified according to their power of traction, it is probable\r\nthat the post of honour at the top of the list would be occupied by\r\nour despised _Forficula auricularia_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe idea of a _muscular dynamometry_ of insects is not so new as\r\none might be tempted to think it. From time immemorial men have\r\nbeen struck, without being able to account for it, by the enormous\r\ndisproportion existing between the weight of a flea and the force or\r\nenergy displayed by its extraordinary bounds. Hence the popularity of\r\na recent exhibition in London of Performing Fleas. Pliny, eighteen\r\ncenturies ago, asserted that the muscular strength of the ants\r\nexceeded that of all other animals, if we compared the burden they\r\nwere able to carry with the diminutiveness of their bodies. \"_Si quis\r\ncomparet onera corporibus earum, fateatur nullis portione vires esse\r\nmajores._\"[71]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, this interesting\r\nquestion was taken up by Borelli, Lahire, Buffon, and Gueneau de\r\nMontbeliard. Recently it has been revived, with much ability, by\r\nFelix Plateau, whose experiments have proved that the insects, in\r\ncomparison with their weight, possess an uncommon muscular force, far\r\nbeyond that of vertebrate animals; that in the same group of insects\r\nthis force varies in different species; and that in the small species\r\nit is often of astounding energy.\r\n\r\nThe muscles are enclosed in solid sheaths (so to speak), which\r\nconstitute the jointed limbs of insects, and the thickness of the\r\nsides of these sheaths seems to decrease in ratio with the size. No\r\nrelation, therefore, exists between the stature of individuals and\r\nthe volume and strength of their muscles. A giant may be weaker than\r\na dwarf. Here is another mystery for science to reveal!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut we must take leave of our earwig. Its English name is derived by\r\nsome authorities from _ear_, and the old English _wiega_, a worm or\r\ngrub,--identical with the German _oberwurm_, and based, of course, on\r\nthe fiction which we have already exploded.\r\n\r\nNewman, however, suggests a somewhat different name, and,\r\nconsequently, a different etymology:[72]--\"The shape of the hind\r\nwings,\" he says, \"when fully opened, is nearly that of the human ear;\r\nand from this circumstance it seems highly probable that the original\r\nname of this insect was _earwing_.\" But we cannot agree with Mr\r\nNewman.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be added, that the female earwig sits upon her eggs,\r\nand hatches them like a hen; and like a hen, too, she gathers her\r\nyoung around her with evident affection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Landscape.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: \"The term _perianth_ is usually confined to the flowers\r\nof Endogens, whatever colours they present, whether green, as in\r\nasparagus, or coloured, as in tulip.

The first to discern this point\r\nin astronomy, the illustrious Kepler thereby succeeded in formulating\r\nthose laws, or rather rules, by which the movements of the stars are\r\nregulated. How did he succeed? How did he arrive at a goal so much\r\nto be desired? By intelligence in full possession of itself. It was\r\nby abstracting his thoughts from all systematic conceptions,--the\r\nshackles of science; it was by defying the traditional authority\r\nwhich had so long enslaved men's minds; it was by interrogating\r\nnature, which leaves all liberty to her interrogator, that Kepler\r\nwas able to deserve and win the glorious title of \"legislator of\r\nthe heavens,\"--a title which we must not, however, understand too\r\nliterally; it bears witness only to the power of intellect.\r\n\r\nLet us attempt, at a modest distance, to proceed like Kepler; let us\r\nmake astronomy without troubling ourselves concerning astronomers.\r\nThis is the sole means of seizing the luminous point which should\r\nguide our steps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe movement, in virtue of which every star performs the circuit\r\nof heaven in four-and-twenty hours, is incessantly reproduced in a\r\nuniform and a constant manner. The acquisition of this first fact,\r\nsimple as it seems, was a somewhat laborious task, and undoubtedly\r\ndates back to a distant antiquity. But now comes another fact, where\r\nobservation demands the closest mental attention, and which is of a\r\nmore recent discovery.\r\n\r\nTo comprehend it clearly, let us first call to mind that the moment\r\nwhen the sun crosses the Equator,--whether to return into the\r\nnorthern hemisphere (at the _spring equinox_), or into the southern\r\n(at the _autumn equinox_),--is instantaneous. More than one way\r\nexists of determining this moment exactly; but here we need not enter\r\nupon the subject.\r\n\r\nIs the interval of time occupied by the sun in travelling from the\r\nspring to the autumn equinox equal to the interval which our luminary\r\nrequires to pass from the autumn equinox to the vernal?\r\n\r\nA singular question, you reply. Who, indeed, would venture to\r\nmaintain that the number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, was not\r\nexactly the same in the one case as in the other?\r\n\r\nWell, the period is _not_ the same; and, therefore, merely to\r\npropound _this_ question was a masterpiece of genius. For no ordinary\r\nintellectual audacity was needed to doubt the reality of the supposed\r\nperfect circle which the sun apparently describes--according to the\r\nrecognised authorities--in its uniform progress around the globe;\r\nthat globe believed by all the early astronomers to be imperturbably\r\nand everlastingly situated in the centre of their thrice-sacred\r\ngeometrical figure. This dogma being accepted as infallible, there\r\nwas every evidence that the two intervals of time, which divided the\r\nastronomical year into two moieties, would be of equal duration. It\r\ndid not occur to the mind of any one of the faithful that the sojourn\r\nof the sun, in his circular and uniform movement, might be longer or\r\nshorter in the northern than in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the name of the audacious innovator who ventured upon\r\nputting forth so revolutionary a suggestion?\r\n\r\nIt was Hipparchus. At least it was he who, confidently relying upon\r\nhis observations, was the first to affirm that the sun remains longer\r\nin the northern than in the southern hemispheres; or, more accurately\r\nspeaking, that its passage from the spring to the autumn equinox\r\noccupies 187 days, while from the autumn to the spring equinox the\r\nduration of its course is only 178 days 6 hours (nearly). The year\r\nof 365-1/4 days--that is, the Egyptian year, which was universally\r\nadopted by the ancient astronomers--was thus discovered to be really\r\ndivided into two unequal portions, although, _theoretically_, the sun\r\nought to occupy exactly the same space of time in passing from the\r\nspring to the autumn, as from the autumn to the spring equinox.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fact pointed out and attested by Hipparchus had an influence\r\nwhich he never anticipated on the progress of science. In opposition\r\nto all the systems previously designed by man, it followed, in the\r\nfirst place, that the movement of the sun, in relation to a mean\r\nmovement, must sometimes be accelerated, sometimes be retarded; that\r\nthe solar arc described in a given time would be greater in winter\r\nthan in summer.\r\n\r\nAstronomers who, trammelled by particular theories, were unable\r\nand unwilling to accept of any new light, immediately hastened\r\nto raise, as is invariably the case with those who defend a bad\r\ncause, a subsidiary and damaging question. They asked whether those\r\ninequalities of the sun's movement were real, or only apparent;\r\nwhether they were more than a mere optical phenomenon, arising\r\nfrom the sun's position _vis-à-vis_ to an observer placed on the\r\nearth's surface. And they unhesitatingly pronounced in favour of the\r\nappearance, and against the reality.\r\n\r\nBut man, says an old adage, is always punished after the manner\r\nof his sin. Dogmatic and obstinate authority involved our\r\nanti-revolutionary astronomers in fresh complications. Such is the\r\ncase, too, very frequently, in the domain of theology!\r\n\r\nDoes the sun--the sun as each of us beholds him--ever change his\r\nsize? Does he ever shrink in his majestic proportions? Is the\r\nmagnitude of his broad golden disc ever lessened?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAssuredly this new question, which was not less audacious than its\r\npredecessor, did not come--there is sacrilege in the thought--from\r\nthe conservative areopagus of all ancient doctrines; the learned\r\nareopagus, or supreme tribunal, which had erected into a dogma the\r\ncircular orbit and uniform movement of the sun around the earth, the\r\ncentre of the universe! It could only have been suggested by some\r\nunworthy heterodoxical disturber of men's minds,--his name, alas! has\r\nnot been handed down to us,--who had dared to look upon the heavens,\r\nand learn from their bright and beautiful face, without a master, the\r\nA B C of science. This \"pestilent heretic\" had, probably, remarked\r\none of the commonest phenomena connected with the celestial bodies,\r\nwhich astronomers hitherto had not deigned to notice.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, dear reader, you will have been more than once impressed\r\nby the appearance of the solar orb, when obscured in one of those\r\nmists so frequent towards the end of autumn:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cold grew the foggy morn, the day was brief;\r\n    Loose on the cherry hung the crimson leaf;\r\n    The dew dwelt ever on the herb; the woods\r\n    Roared with strong blasts, with mighty showers the floods.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--\"When the glory of the woods is rapidly\r\ndeparting.\"]\r\n\r\nSuch a day, in this sad season of the year, when the glory of\r\nthe woods is rapidly departing, and from the swollen streams and\r\ndewy pastures the vapours ascend in a dense whirl of clouds, is\r\nof frequent occurrence; and on such a day, the solar sphere, as\r\nit struggles through the screening mists, seems like the face of\r\nthe moon at its full, when slightly veiled. Your eye rests upon\r\nit without pain. And as observation sharpens your mind, you put\r\nto yourself the natural question, Is not the sun farther from the\r\nearth at this epoch when it affords us the least heat, than at that\r\nperiod of the year when its vivifying power is greatest? I think it\r\nis obvious that, to the unexperienced, such a method of explaining\r\nthe cold of winter and the heat of summer by the variation in the\r\ndistance of our great solar luminary would naturally occur.\r\n\r\nBut the demon of certainty--an excellent demon, whatever the orthodox\r\nmay say--is present, to stimulate us all. You may have just formed\r\nyour theories, you may cite your traditional authorities, but these\r\nwill not satisfy our awakened curiosity. We ask for demonstrations,\r\nfor irrefragable proofs drawn from the Bible of Nature. We will\r\nlisten to no oracles but those which are confirmed by the voices of\r\nGod's second revelation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, men required to be assured that the sun was really nearer\r\nto us in summer than in winter. For this purpose, it was requisite\r\nto make, at the beginning of summer, an observation analogous to\r\nthat which had been made at the beginning of winter, and afterwards\r\nto compare the apparent magnitudes of the solar disc at these two\r\nopposite periods of the year.\r\n\r\nBehold us, then, at work. You are perfectly tranquil as to the\r\nresult; for you are persuaded beforehand that the sun _must_ be\r\nfarther from us in the cold season than in the hot. You regard this\r\nas a self-evident truth, like an axiom of Euclid's.\r\n\r\nBut Nature is a great magician; she contrives the most dramatic\r\nsurprises for the mind which takes the trouble to interrogate her in\r\nall simplicity and without dogmatic pretensions.\r\n\r\nWhat a _coup-de-théâtre_ it was for the observer who first\r\nestablished experimentally that the apparent diameter of the sun is\r\ngreater in winter than in summer--that we are _nearer_ the sun in the\r\ncold season, than in the hot!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn more closely examining a result apparently so paradoxical, man\r\ndiscovered that the angle which subtracts the sun, as seen from\r\nthe earth,--the _visual angle_ which gives the sun's apparent\r\ndiameter,--varies necessarily throughout the year. Thus, the\r\nsemi-diameter, or radius, which on the 24th of June equals 15' 45\",\r\nwill, a month later, have increased one second (15' 46\"); on the 2d\r\nof August will equal 15' 47\"; on the 2d September, 15' 53\", and so\r\non.

Is it this fact which suggested the idea of\r\ndividing the circle into 720/2 = 360°?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the discovery of the variations of the solar\r\ncharioteer, it was ascertained that the moments of the sun's passage\r\nof the meridian--moments which measure the 365 different positions\r\noccupied by the sun in the 365 days of the year--are not separated by\r\nequal intervals, or that equal intervals of time do not correspond\r\nto the equal angular displacements,--in fine, that the maximum and\r\nminimum of the sun's angular velocity coincide with the maximum and\r\nminimum of its apparent diameter. Now, remember that the extreme\r\npoints where the sun experiences its maximum and minimum angular\r\ndisplacement are named, according to Ptolemæus, the former the\r\n_perigee_, the latter the _apogee_; or, if we follow Copernicus, the\r\nformer the _perihelion_, and the latter the _aphelion_.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of these facts was known to the ancients; but the\r\nmanner in which it was sought to explain them merits notice as a\r\nspecimen of blind attachment to a preconceived system.\r\n\r\nPtolemæus, the organ of the dictatorial astronomy of antiquity,\r\ndeclares, _ex cathedrâ_, that \"the inequalities of the sun's\r\nmovements are only apparent; that they are simply the effects of\r\nthe position and of the arrangements of the circles in which these\r\nmovements are accomplished; and that, in this _apparent disorder of\r\nthe phenomena_ (περί τὴν ὑπονουμένην τῶν\r\nφαινομένων ἀταξίαν), nothing really occurs contrary\r\nto their actual immobility (τῷ ὄντι πέφυκε\r\nσυμβαίνειν οὐδὲν ἀλλότριον αὐτῶν\r\nτῆς ἀΐδιοτητος).\"\r\n\r\nNow, according to this dogmatic immutability, the straight lines, or\r\nradii, which proceed from the revolving star to the centre of the\r\ncircle, would describe \"equal angles in equal times.\" This is exactly\r\nthe contrary of the result obtained, as we have seen, by careful\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nBut this difficulty no more embarrassed the great pontiff of\r\nastronomy than a conscientious scruple would perplex the author of a\r\ntheological dogma. Listen to him:--\r\n\r\n\"The true cause of these apparent irregularities is explained by two\r\nvery simple hypotheses. Either the one or the other would account\r\nfor the phenomena. In fact, if we suppose the movement to occur in\r\na circle described around the centre of the world, and in the plane\r\nof the ecliptic, so that the point whence we are looking corresponds\r\nwith this centre, we must admit either that the planets make their\r\nmovements equal in non-concentric circles, or that, if these circles\r\nare concentric, it is not simply in these circles that they move, but\r\nin others, called _epicycles_, carried through the concentric.\"[73]\r\n\r\nExamine Fig. 67. Here A B G D represent the ecliptic, E its centre,\r\nand A E G its diameter; Z H T K is the epicycle, in which the planet\r\nmoves uniformly around the centre A, while the epicycle uniformly\r\ntraverses the circle A B G D. Now, suppose that the star has arrived\r\nat H; it would appear to an observer at E to be more advanced by the\r\nuniform movement of all the arc A H; if it be at K, it would appear,\r\non the contrary, to be less advanced by all the arc A K. At Z the\r\nstar would appear more distant, and at T, nearer than if it were at A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--The Circle and the Epicycle.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo explain the other phenomena, such as the stations and\r\nretrocessions of the planets, recourse was again had to the epicycles\r\nor deferred eccentric circles. By multiplying these it was possible\r\nto account for all the angular inequalities in the movements of a\r\nplanet. It is of importance to note this point, in order to show\r\nhow very dangerous it is to trust absolutely to mathematics in our\r\nsearch after the truth; that science which, by the certainty of its\r\ndemonstrations, nourishes our intellectual pride, and may, therefore,\r\noccasionally lull the mind into a false security. The theory of\r\nepicycles, from a mathematical point of view, was irreproachable, and\r\nit sufficiently accounted for the facts which threatened to overthrow\r\nthe dogma of circular orbits and uniform planetary movement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut by degrees, as observations grew more accurate and\r\ncomprehensive, these and other theories, however fine in\r\nappearance,--_teres atque rotundus_,--gradually disappeared, if\r\nfundamentally erroneous. By the invention of micrometers, we were\r\nenabled to measure more exactly than had formerly been possible\r\nthe variations of diameter or the modifications of distance, and\r\nafterwards to compare them with the changes of velocity. From\r\nthis comparison it results that the latter are not greater than\r\nis compatible with the alterations of distance indicated by the\r\nvariations of diameter; in a word, that the hypothesis of epicycles\r\nis decidedly insufficient to account for all the inequalities\r\ndetected by careful investigation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKepler was the first to break the charm which had held captive the\r\nmind of astronomers, including even Copernicus and Tycho Brahé.\r\nPtolemæus had considered the mean positions of the stars to be\r\nreal. Kepler, strong in his researches, declared that they were\r\nbut a factitious mode of calculation by which the _true_ positions\r\nmight be ascertained; that the mean movement is simply an artifice\r\nrepresenting the star's place, _if_ no inequality existed; in fine,\r\nthat we must take the movements as they are in nature,--the true\r\nmovements, given by observation,--and not the mean movements, deduced\r\nfrom an erroneous hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis declaration of principles met, at the time, with the hostility\r\nof all astronomers of any reputation, but it has become the\r\nstarting-point of the discovery of the laws on which the whole\r\nedifice of astronomy reposes. Had Kepler, however, been left to\r\ndepend entirely on his own resources, he might, perhaps, have\r\nnever completed his task. A fortunate circumstance brought him an\r\nunexpected ally. Tycho, having taken refuge in Bohemia, sent for the\r\nyoung astronomer (Kepler then was but twenty-nine years old), to\r\nassist him in the composition of the \"Rudolphine Tables.\"[74]\r\n\r\n\"This,\" says Kepler, \"was a providential interposition. I repaired\r\nto Bohemia early in the year 1600, in the hope of learning the\r\ncorrection of the eccentricities of the planets. Perceiving that\r\nTycho made use of a mixed system (which made Mercury and Venus\r\nrevolve around the sun, and all these planets, with their companions,\r\naround the earth), I asked his permission to follow out my own\r\nideas. It was the will of Providence again, that we should occupy\r\nourselves with Mars. My whole attention, therefore, was directed to\r\nthis planet: and it is through the movements of Mars we must obtain\r\nour insight into the secrets of astronomy, or remain ignorant of them\r\nfor ever (_ex Martis motibus omnino necesse est nos in cognitionem\r\nastronomiæ arcanorum venire aut ea perpetuo nescire_).\"[75]\r\n\r\nWhy this preference given to Mars? In the first place, because, among\r\nall the planets then known, it was Mars which, in its movement round\r\nthe sun, departed most from the circle; next, its orbit approaches\r\nnearest to the earth's; the earth is very near to Mars when she\r\npasses between that planet and the sun,--that is to say, when she is\r\nin _opposition_, while she retires from it triple the distance when\r\nin _conjunction_,--that is, when the sun is between her and Mars.\r\nHence arise certain variations of aspect, particularly adapted to\r\nmake manifest the form of the orbit, and the law of the real movement\r\nof the \"red planet, Mars.\" As for the other planets, as far as they\r\nwere then known, their orbits differ so little from the circle, that\r\nthe nature of the curve which they describe in reality would never\r\nhave been exactly recognised by any inexperienced star-gazer.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Kepler regarded as providential the choice he had\r\nbeen led to make of Mars at the outset of his astronomical career.\r\nBefore the close of 1601, Tycho died, bequeathing to his young\r\nfellow-worker a treasury of observation. Thenceforth Kepler undertook\r\nto finish without assistance the famous Rudolphine Tables. They cost\r\nhim five-and-twenty years of assiduous labour. Looking upon Tycho's\r\nobservations, because of their exactness, as \"a gift from the Divine\r\nGoodness,\" he employed them, in the first place, as a test of the old\r\nhypotheses of planetary orbits and movements. Let us do our best to\r\ngrasp the range and bearing of this part of his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the system of Copernicus, which Kepler ardently adopted, the\r\nearth revolves around the sun. Now, observation having shown that\r\nthe sun remains seven or eight days longer in the northern than in\r\nthe southern signs of the Zodiac, we must of necessity admit that\r\nthe sun, instead of being situated in the centre of the terrestrial\r\norbit, occupies a point _outside_ that centre, in such a manner that\r\nthe earth must sometimes be nearer to, and sometimes farther from,\r\nthe sun. The distance by which it departs from the centre of its\r\norbit, which Copernicus, like the ancients, supposed to be circular,\r\nis called its _eccentricity_.\r\n\r\nAstronomers were long preoccupied with the idea of seeking in this\r\n_eccentricity_ a point where the movements should appear equal. This\r\npoint was the centre of the _equant_,--a name given to the eccentric\r\ncircle described from the point of equality or from the centre of the\r\nmean movements.\r\n\r\nNow, let us recall the principal condition of the problem which\r\nKepler had undertaken to solve. This condition required that the\r\nstraight line drawn from the centre of our globe to the centre of the\r\nsun,--in a word, that the _vector radius_, as it is called, should\r\ndescribe around the sun certain angles, whose variability should\r\nagree with the results of observation.\r\n\r\nStarting from this point, Kepler found that, for certain positions\r\nof Mars (in the _aphelion_ and _perihelion_, corresponding to the\r\n_minimum_ and _maximum_ of velocity), the centre of the orbit,\r\nalways supposing it to be circular, divided into two equal parts\r\n(or _bisected_) the total eccentricity: in other words, that it\r\nexactly occupied the middle between the centre of the eccentric and\r\nthe _equant_ of Ptolemæus; but it did not appear to him necessary\r\nto bisect it in other positions, intermediate between those of the\r\naphelion and the perihelion. He established that the differences\r\nin longitude amounted to eight or nine minutes. Now, observations\r\nso exact as those of Tycho were altogether incompatible with such\r\ngreat error.[76] Therefore, the geometrical hypothesis which gave\r\nthese errors was false; the orbit of Mars could not be a circle, and\r\nto save these eight or nine minutes, furnished by observation but\r\nin disaccord with theory, it would be needful to recommence all the\r\ncalculations of astronomy. This conclusion, not less legitimate than\r\ndaring, supplied Kepler with the first decisive step in the task he\r\nhad undertaken.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to relate all the essays and miscarriages\r\nthrough which this man of genius passed before finally completing his\r\ndiscovery of the rules that bear his name. But we may put before the\r\nreader the construction which led to them.\r\n\r\nOn a sheet of paper let us mark down by a point (Fig. 68) the place\r\noccupied by the earth in relation to the sun.[77] From this point\r\n_o_, we draw a right line terminating at _a_, the sun's noon-day\r\nposition (for example, on the 1st of January); the succeeding lines\r\nshall touch upon _a´ a´´_, which the sun occupies successively after\r\nthe same interval of time (twenty-four hours, or the exact duration\r\nof the earth's rotation on its axis);--and let us continue after\r\nthis mode until the sun has accomplished, by its own proper movement\r\nfrom west to east, the whole circuit of the heavens, traversing\r\n360 degrees in the space of a year. If we ascribe to the radius\r\n_o a_ a certain length, corresponding to a definite solar diameter,\r\nthe lengths of all the others, corresponding to the variations of\r\nthe same diameter, will depend upon that of the first, which, for\r\nfacility of calculation, we suppose to be divided into one thousand\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Diagram for Kepler's Laws.]\r\n\r\nAfter having thus allotted to each straight line its approximate\r\nlength, let us join their extremities by a curve. What do we see\r\nbefore us? A geometrical figure widely different from a circle, for\r\nthe diameters (_i.e._, the straight lines passing through the centre)\r\nare far from being equal. The figure is an ellipse.\r\n\r\nIf now we pass from the appearance to the reality, _o_ will be the\r\nsun, and _a a´ a´´_, _m m´_ will indicate the terrestrial orbit,\r\nor the points of the curve successively occupied by the earth in\r\nmovement. The moveable straight lines, free at one extremity, and at\r\nthe other attached to the centre of the sun, are called the _Vector\r\nheliocentric radii_. By the help of this construction, you see that\r\nthe point occupied by the sun is beyond or without the centre; this\r\neccentric point is the _focus_ of the ellipse, and the distance\r\nfrom this focus to the centre, its _eccentricity_. The extremity\r\nof the major axis, the nearest to the focus, is the _perihelion_,\r\nand its farthest extremity the _aphelion_. The difference of the\r\nangles formed by the vector radii indicate the inequality of the\r\nmovements: to the greatest angle, the perihelion, corresponds the\r\n_maximum_ of velocity (_a a´ a´´_), just as to the smallest, or\r\naphelion, corresponds the _minimum_ (_m m´_); the other angles mark\r\nthe velocities intermediary between these two extremes. We have thus\r\nbefore us a series of triangles with their apices at the focus of the\r\nellipse, and their bases on the contour of the curve.\r\n\r\nBut these latter are not sufficient for the mind, whose principal\r\nfunction lies in seeking unity among the variety of phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn what way are the variations of distance connected with the\r\nvariations of velocity? What is the simplest expression of their\r\nrelationship? These are questions which naturally presented\r\nthemselves to Kepler's inquiring intellect. By dint of immeasurable\r\npatience, and recommencing more than once the same toil, this great\r\nastronomer discovered that the variable arc traversed by the earth\r\n(or, in appearance, the sun), in four-and-twenty hours, multiplied by\r\none half the corresponding vector radius, is a constant quantity: is\r\nthe product which, as elementary geometry teaches, gives the surface\r\nof a triangle. And, in fact, look at the matter carefully: the\r\n_vector radii_ form triangles whose base is the arc traversed in the\r\nsame interval of time, and whose apices rest upon the centre of the\r\nsun (or, in appearance, the observer, or the centre of the earth).\r\n\r\nTo fix these ideas thoroughly in our minds,--and a superficial\r\nknowledge is worse than useless,--let us imagine to ourselves a man\r\nholding horizontally extended a tube of a certain length, capable,\r\nlike a telescope, of being lengthened or shortened at pleasure;\r\nand let us fancy him pivoting upon himself, in such a manner that\r\nhe sweeps, every minute, exactly the same area or same quantity\r\nof surface, while varying perpetually the swiftness of movement\r\nand the length of the tube; this \"ideal man\" will have solved the\r\nproblem whose solution is inscribed, in ineffaceable letters, on the\r\nmachinery of our globe; he will describe around him an ellipse, of\r\nwhich he himself occupies one of the foci.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy this method of investigation and deduction, Kepler succeeded in\r\nbreaking up the traditionary authority of the circle and of uniform\r\nmovement. He broke it up for ever by two of his celebrated laws,\r\nwhich may be rendered in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n      1st, _The orbit of the earth, as well as the curves described by\r\n      the other planets, are ellipses, one of whose foci is represented\r\n      by the sun_;\r\n\r\n      2d, _The heliocentric vector radius of a planet describes around\r\n      the sun areas equal with the times; or, in other words, the\r\n      surfaces described by the vector radii, in equal times, are also\r\n      equal._\r\n\r\nThe ancients had looked for equality in the movements of planets\r\ntraversing the circumferences of circles: they were mistaken. It is\r\ntrue this equality exists; only, not where they supposed. If they had\r\nsought it in the surfaces described by the vector radii, they would\r\nhave anticipated Kepler's discovery of the laws which govern our\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut their astronomical dogmas prevented them from seeing the path\r\nwhich led to this great discovery.\r\n\r\nHence we may conclude that Dogma is an evil thing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: Ptolemæus, \"Syntaxis Mathematicalis,\" iii. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: Certain astronomical calculations, so called because\r\nbegun under the patronage of Rudolf II., Emperor of Germany\r\n(1576-1612).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: Kepler, \"Astronomia Nova, seu de Motibus Stellæ\r\nMartis,\" p. 53 (ed. 1609).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: The reader should turn to Kepler's immortal work, \"De\r\nMotibus Stellæ Martis,\" for the manifold attempts of the astronomer\r\nto bring calculation into agreement with observation.

It is on the surface of the globe that men play\r\ntheir various parts. And why? Can it be for no other purpose than to\r\nmodify, in some degree, its aspect, that they occupy the terrestrial\r\nsurface? One would be tempted to think so on consulting what these\r\nmajestic _bimanes_ pompously designate their \"Universal History.\"\r\nRegions formerly blooming with fertility,--gay with gardens, and\r\norchards, and meadows,--musical with brooks, and glorious with\r\nharvest,--are now uncultivated and barren. Monuments which seemed\r\nadapted to defy the winds and the rains, and the corroding touch of\r\nthe years, lie shattered in ruins; and with them the once populous\r\ncities and the once mighty empires of which they were the pride. The\r\njackal howls among the broken columns of Tadmor; the sand-drifts have\r\naccumulated above the splendour of Memphis and Thebes. With their\r\nstones other monuments are raised, other cities are embellished, and\r\nother empires, which, in their turn, undergo the same unalterable\r\nfate: a perpetual relation of human forms, in every respect\r\ncomparable with that which transpires in the bosom of the prolific\r\nearth, our common mother and nurse.\r\n\r\nBut why do men wander so far from the straight way? Why do they their\r\nbest to ensure each other's unhappiness? They seem, alas! ignorant of\r\nthe tendency of their actions, while attaching themselves to things\r\ntransitory, and despising things imperishable. These, indeed, they\r\nwould utterly ignore; they would live, like the brutes, unconscious\r\nof their destiny, if, at the bottom of their indestructible\r\nconscience, there did not prevail a glimmer of light, though more\r\nor less eclipsed, if they did not all feel themselves attracted, if\r\nthey did not all irresistibly gravitate, some more quickly, others\r\nmore slowly, towards the sun of eternal truth and justice. Instead\r\nof moving with sidelong sinuous pace, instead of taking ninety-nine\r\nsteps backward for every one hundred taken in advance, they would\r\nall march onward in the way of progress; were it not that they pass\r\ntheir time in clipping their own wings; were it not that, to bend\r\ntheir heads the better--_Veluti pecora ventri obedientia_--they\r\ncheck the aspiring flight of that thought which would soar beyond\r\nthe present; in a word, were it not that they lay a sacrilegious\r\nhand--unfortunate wretches!--on that which God Himself has respected\r\nin His creature--Liberty! The doubt which perplexes us as to the\r\ngreat problem of our destiny,--the doubt which allows so much\r\nlatitude to the workings of our conscience,--does it not indicate the\r\npath we ought to follow? Should not men regard their freedom with\r\npeculiar reverence, when the Divinity they invoke has mercifully\r\nrefrained from fettering it? Creatures of a day, who live as if you\r\nwould never die! the contradictions and the miseries of which you so\r\nincessantly complain, are your own work. Help, help yourselves, by\r\nthe development of your faculties, by the cultivation of your heart\r\nand mind, for herein you shall see the law and the prophets. Barren\r\nlip-service is nothing better than blasphemy!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut let us return to the ground which we tread, and where our\r\nlife-companions are the animals and the plants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe uppermost stratum of our globe undergoes the direct action of\r\nthe light and heat of the all-vivifying \"orb of day.\" This action,\r\nvery unequal in its effects, and most important to understand, has\r\nscarcely been touched as yet by scientific research. Our geologists,\r\nhaving been more busily engaged with the inside than the outside\r\nof the earth, have broached certain plausible theories--for the\r\nmost part of a very dubious character--respecting the central fire,\r\nPlutonism and Neptunism, the stratification of the planets, the\r\nformation of mountains, valleys, and basins. Our mineralogists,\r\nthinking far less of the chemical molecular constitution of the\r\ndifferent formations than of their crystalline constitution, have\r\nminutely studied the physical qualities and geometrical forms of the\r\nintegral parts of the rocks; but neither have condescended to direct\r\ntheir inquiries to the layer of soil trodden underneath their feet.\r\nYet this very layer of arable earth, to which all bodies must return\r\nafter death what they have taken from it during life,--this much\r\ndespised _humus_, furnishes all our agricultural products, the very\r\nfoundation and support of our material existence.\r\n\r\nTo touch industrial occupations--to meddle with trade, commerce, or\r\nagriculture--is unworthy of Science! Such is the silly cry of the\r\nmany distinguished savants who pride themselves on what they call\r\ntheir \"freedom from selfish considerations.\"\r\n\r\nBe it so; but then you ought surely to be consistent, and never\r\nregard science as a profession or a bread-winner.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy study to investigate the modifications and chemical\r\neffects which the terrestrial surface is capable of receiving or\r\nundergoing, either from the direct rays of the sun, or from diffused\r\nlight. It requires new methods of inquiry,--methods frequently\r\nof extreme delicacy, as the labours of Bunsen and Roscoe, of\r\nKirchhofer and Tyndall, have abundantly demonstrated. Let us here\r\nconfine ourselves to establishing the fact that the chemical action\r\nof light varies according to the geological constitution of the\r\nsoil,--according to the diurnal and annual obliquity of the solar\r\nrays,--according to the hours of the day,--according to the latitudes\r\nand seasons. The maximum of effects is manifested about the times of\r\nthe solstices.\r\n\r\nFor the better co-ordination of these phenomena, might we not, as has\r\nbeen done in regard to the distribution of heat over the terrestrial\r\nsurface,[78] link together by lines the points of equality? We should\r\nthus create an aggregate of _iso-photo-chemical_ lines,--diurnal,\r\nmensual, and annual,--of incontestible utility for the progress of\r\ngeneral physics and meteorology, which are still in their infancy.\r\n\r\nBut to realise this magnificent programme, the union and agreement is\r\nnecessary of scientific men in every region of the globe; an ideal,\r\ntherefore, as yet, is very far from being attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe earth is subject to the influence of two different sources of\r\nheat. One, like the arterial blood, strikes from the centre to the\r\ncircumference: this internal heat it is which has been stored up\r\nsince the unknown epoch when our globe was nothing more than an\r\nincandescent nucleus, surrounded by condensable vapours. The other,\r\nlike the venous blood, flows from the circumference towards the\r\ncentre: this is the solar heat which the earth continues to receive\r\nthrough its crust.\r\n\r\nThe first of these sources lies beyond the domain of experiment. It\r\nhas been the object of numerous hypotheses and diverse speculations,\r\nwith which we shall not here concern ourselves. The second source\r\nis alone accessible to our investigations, and yet the network of\r\n_isothermal lines_ is scarcely defined.\r\n\r\nSince the year 1817, when Alexander von Humboldt conceived the\r\nfelicitous idea of representing by lines the same mean temperatures\r\nenjoyed, in a given space of time, by the different regions of the\r\nglobe, researches of this nature have very considerably multiplied.\r\nBut these researches--do not forget--refer rather to the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere than to the heating of the inferior stratum of that\r\ngaseous ocean whose bed or foundation is the terrestrial crust. And\r\nit is the penetration of the latter by the sun's calorific rays which\r\nwe would especially desire to understand. Here, then, a sufficient\r\nmargin is left for our curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"If the king, my father, does not rest from his conquests,\" cried\r\nAlexander of Macedon, while still a child, \"he will leave me nothing\r\nto do when I shall have reached manhood.\" To such a complaint, be you\r\nsure, dear reader, that the conquests made by science will never give\r\nrise. Every step in advance is but a step into the infinite: what we\r\nhave done only shows us the boundless extent of what we have to do.\r\n\r\nIt is this reflection which must always teach humility to the\r\nscientific student, even while he rejoices in the achievements of\r\nhuman patience and genius. He will not despair for he knows that\r\ngreat victories have been won: he will not grow arrogant, for he\r\nknows that he is still on the threshold of eternal truth. As Sir\r\nJ. Herschel has justly said:--\"He who has seen obscurities, which\r\nappeared impenetrable, in physical and mathematical science, suddenly\r\ndispelled, and the most barren and unpromising fields of inquiry\r\nconverted, as if by inspiration, into rich and inexhaustible springs\r\nof knowledge and power, on a simple change of our point of view, or\r\nby merely bringing them to bear on some principle which it never\r\noccurred before to try, will surely be the very last to acquiesce\r\nin any dispiriting prospects of either the present or the future\r\ndestinies of mankind; while, on the other hand, the boundless views\r\nof intellectual and moral, as well as material relations, which open\r\nto him on all hands in the course of these pursuits,--the knowledge\r\nof the trivial place he occupies in the scale of creation, and the\r\nsense continually pressed upon him of his own weakness and incapacity\r\nto suspend or modify the slightest movement of the vast machinery\r\nhe sees in action around him, must effectually convince him that\r\nhumility of pretension, no less than confidence of hope, is what best\r\nbecomes his character.\"[79]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the terrestrial surface perpetually varies under\r\nthe influence of local as well as general causes. Had this fact\r\nbeen known to the philosophers of antiquity, they would have taken\r\nadvantage of it to liken the earth to an animal whose skin is more or\r\nless sensible of heat, not only according to the difference of the\r\nseasons, but according to the different hours of the day.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal thermometrical variations are those which penetrate the\r\nleast profoundly into the interior of the soil. At a depth of about\r\nfive feet they cease to be perceptible. The maxima and minima of the\r\nyear, however, can be detected at a sufficiently considerable depth.\r\nThe limit descends as low as 80 to 100 feet. Below 100 feet, the\r\nterrestrial stratum is found invariable,--that is, inaccessible to\r\nthe thermometrical changes of the atmosphere. It is remarkable that\r\nthe temperature of this stratum differs but little from the mean\r\nannual temperature of the air, which, in the latitude of London, is\r\n49°.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe maxima and minima of the yearly heat are propagated very slowly\r\nin the earth, and their difference gradually becomes less and\r\nless. Thermometers buried 26 feet deep in the ground, mark, in our\r\nlatitudes, the maximum of temperature only on the 10th of December,\r\nand the minimum on the 15th of June. But there are certain elements\r\nwhich we must take into account. Thus, the depth of the invariable\r\nthermometrical curve depends both on the latitude of the place,\r\non the conductibility of the strata, and the difference between\r\nthe highest and lowest temperature of the year. The less this\r\ndifference, the more nearly does the invariable stratum approach the\r\nsurface. Here we have the reason why, in the intertropical torrid\r\nzone, where the temperature scarcely varies above two or three\r\ndegrees in the whole year, the invariable curve is not found more\r\nthan forty centimetres beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the temperate zone, lying between the torrid and the frigid zones,\r\nthe same phenomena assume, apparently, a more complex character;\r\nthe isogeothermal lines inflect as diversely as the isothermal, and\r\nthe former are far from running parallel with the latter. And this\r\nis easily understood, even without any experiment, for there is no\r\nrelation between the ever-varied composition of the terrestrial\r\nstrata, and the much more uniform composition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the frigid zone, the soil remains constantly frozen for an\r\ninsignificant depth, whatever may be the temperature of the\r\nencircling atmosphere. In some regions a stratum of ice and snow\r\neternally reposes on the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the observations, which require to be undertaken on an\r\nuniform plan and under well-weighed conditions, at various points\r\nover the whole globe, are as yet far too few to assist us in defining\r\nany general currents of heat or cold, whether variable or constant,\r\nas prevailing in the lower strata of the gaseous ocean of our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nARABLE LAND.\r\n\r\nA more useful picture than that of the isogeothermal lines would be\r\none of all the arable land covering the continents of the Old World\r\nand the New,--indicating the composition of this nutritive earth, the\r\nnature of the soil on which it reposes, as well as the various kinds\r\nof cultivation appropriate in different climates. Here is a work to\r\nbe achieved,--a work which would benefit the whole human race,--a\r\nwork differing vastly from the conquests and achievements of too many\r\nof those \"heroes\" the world delights to honour.\r\n\r\n            \"Peace hath her victories\r\n    More renowned than war.\"\r\n\r\nIn this immense task, of which, as yet, not even the outlines have\r\nbeen sketched, particular attention would require to be paid to the\r\n_subsoil_; for upon this the success of all cultivation literally\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--_a_, Humus, or stratum of arable earth,--the\r\nhorizontal line shows the depth reached by the labourer; _b_,\r\nsubsoil; _c_, subsoil; _d_, arable earth; _e_, humus in an inclined\r\nstratum; _f_, humus mixed with subsoil.]\r\n\r\nArable land is the most superficial stratum of the cultivable\r\nterrestrial crust; it is this which the plough turns up and\r\nsubdues; it is this which, properly manured, and enriched by the\r\ndecomposition of organic matter, furnishes to vegetables their\r\nprincipal nourishment. As it varies in thickness, it necessarily\r\npresents one or other of the following circumstances:--1st, The\r\nlabourer, penetrating the entire stratum of arable earth (Fig. 69,\r\n_a_), will strike down to the subsoil (Fig. 69, _b_); or, 2d, he will\r\nnot traverse the entire stratum (Fig. 69, _c_); or, 3d, after having\r\ntraversed the entire depth of the humus, he will reach a portion of\r\nthe subsoil (Fig. 69, _d_); or, 4th, after having gone through both\r\nhumus and subsoil, he will discover another layer of arable earth,\r\nwhich may be either pure humus, in a thick inclined stratum (Fig. 69,\r\n_e_), or humus mixed with the débris of the subsoil.\r\n\r\nAs for the subsoil, it may, by its composition, completely modify,\r\nstimulate, or delay the action of the vegetable mould, however rich\r\nthis may be in assimilating principles. Thus, where the subsoil is\r\nargillaceous, the pluvial waters are arrested by it as by a bed of\r\nimpervious cement, and render the ground too damp and cold to yield\r\nabundant harvests. In such a case subsoil-drainage is the best\r\nremedy. But if the earth be porous, the moisture gradually percolates\r\nthrough its various layers, fertilising and warming, communicating\r\nto the plants the needful humidity, and assisting in the production\r\nof that most glorious of all the scenes of cultivated nature--a\r\ncorn-field thickly ripe with golden grain. In the poet's \"Palace of\r\nArt\" no finer picture can be seen than this:\r\n\r\n    \"The reapers at their sultry toil.\r\n      In front they bind the sheaves. Behind\r\n    Are realms of upland, prodigal in oil,\r\n      And hoary to the wind.\"\r\n\r\nOh! a sight to thank God for, and rejoice in, is the field all aglow\r\nwith the splendour of the harvest!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--\"Behind are realms of upland.\"]\r\n\r\nWithout having recourse to chemical analysis, which is within the\r\nreach of a very limited number of persons, _clayey_ soils may be\r\ndistinguished by the vegetable species that most commonly flourish in\r\nthem: as--\r\n\r\n      I. _Plants belonging to clayey soils._--The Queen of the\r\n      Meadows, _Spiræa ulmaria_ (order _Rosaceæ_). Wild Angelica,\r\n      _Angelica sylvestris_. Common Sorrel, _Rumex acetosa_ (order\r\n      _Polygonaceæ_), and various kinds of Ranunculaceæ, as _Ranunculus\r\n      lingua_, _Ranunculus flamma_, and _Ranunculus sceleratus_.\r\n\r\n      II. _Plants belonging to sandy soils._--Horny Lotus, _Lotus\r\n      corniculatus_ (order _Rhamnaceæ_).

Wild Mustard, _Sinapis\r\n      arvensis_ (order _Cruciferæ_). Buckwheat, _Polygonum aviculare_\r\n      (order _Polygonaceæ_).\r\n\r\n      IV. _Plants belonging to a sandy and calcareous soil._--Broom,\r\n      _Genista scoparia_ (order _Leguminosæ_). Centaury, _Centaurea\r\n      nigra_ (order _Gentianaceæ_). _Galium verum_ (order _Rubiaceæ_).\r\n      The Jacobea, _Seneecio Jacobæa_.\r\n\r\n      V. _Plants belonging to alluvial and marshy soils._--Reed,\r\n      _Arundo phragmites_, _Poa aquatica_, _Poa fluitans_. Rush,\r\n      _Juncus conglomeratus_ (order _Juncaceæ_).\r\n\r\nAfter these different soils have been brought under cultivation, the\r\ncharacteristic species, which we have just enumerated, disappear,\r\nand are replaced by other plants, which grow, to all appearance,\r\nspontaneously, under the name of _weeds_; but, in reality, spring\r\nfrom germs or seeds too frequently mixed up with the different\r\nmanures, or spread abroad by the agency of birds or the wind.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this latter consideration, the diffusion of plants,\r\nwe shall transcribe an interesting passage from Balfour's excellent\r\n\"Manual of Botany.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some plants,\" he remarks, \"are disseminated generally over the\r\nglobe, while others are confined within narrow limits. Some of the\r\ncommon weeds in Britain, such as chickweed, shepherd's purse, and\r\ngroundsel, are found at the southern extremity of South America.\r\n_Laura minor_ and _trisulca_, _Convolvulus sepium_, _Phragmites\r\ncommunis_, _Cedium Mariscus_, _Scirpus lacustris_, _Juncus effusus_,\r\nand _Solanum nigrum_, are said to be common to Great Britain and New\r\nHolland. _Nasturtium officinale_, and _Samolus Valerandi_ are very\r\nextensively diffused, and they may be reckoned true cosmopolites.\r\nThey are both natives of Europe, and they occur, the former near\r\nRio Janeiro, the latter at St Vincent. _The lower the degree of\r\ndevelopment, the greater seems to be the range._ Some cryptogamic\r\nplants, as _Lecanora subfusca_, are found all over the globe.\r\n\r\n\"Man has been instrumental in widely distributing culinary\r\nvegetables, such as the potato, and the cereal grains, as well as\r\nmany other plants useful for food and manufacture. Corn plants,\r\nsuch as barley, oats, rye, wheat, spelt, rice, maize, and millet,\r\nare so generally cultivated over the globe, that almost all trace\r\nis lost of their native country. They can arrive at perfection in a\r\ngreat variety of circumstances, and they have thus probably a wider\r\ngeographical range than any other kind of plants.\r\n\r\n\"As regards these plants, the globe may be divided into _five_ grand\r\nregions--the region of _rice_, which may be said to support the\r\ngreatest number of the human race; the region of _maize_; of _wheat_;\r\nof _rye_; and lastly, of _barley_ and _oats_. The first three are the\r\nmost extensive, and maize has the greatest range of temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--The Rye District.]\r\n\r\n\"The grains extending farthest north in Europe are barley and oats.\r\nRye is the next, and is the prevailing grain in Sweden and Norway,\r\nand all the lands bordering on the Baltic, the North of Germany, and\r\npart of Siberia. Wheat follows rye; it is cultivated in the middle\r\nand South of France, England, part of Scotland, part of Germany,\r\nHungary, Crimea, and the Caucasus. We next come to a district where\r\nwheat still abounds, but no longer exclusively furnishes bread,--rice\r\nand maize becoming frequent. To this zone belong Portugal, Spain,\r\npart of France, Italy, and Greece, Persia, Northern India, Arabia,\r\nEgypt, the Canary Islands, &c. Wheat can be reared wherever the mean\r\ntemperature of the whole year is not under 37° or 39° F., and the\r\nmean summer heat, for a period of at least three or four months, is\r\nabove 55°. It succeeds best on the limits of the sub-tropical region.\r\nIn the Scandinavian peninsula, the cultivation of barley extends to\r\n70° N. latitude, rye to 67°, and oats to 65°. The cultivation of rice\r\nprevails in Eastern and Southern Asia, and it is a common article\r\nof subsistence in various countries bordering on the Mediterranean.\r\nMaize succeeds best in the hottest and dampest parts of tropical\r\nclimates. It may be reared as far as 40° N. and S. latitude on the\r\nAmerican continent, on the western side; while in Europe it can grow\r\neven to 50° or 52° of latitude. It is now cultivated in all regions\r\nin the tropical and temperate zones which are colonised by Europeans.\r\nMillet of different kinds is met with in the hottest parts of Africa,\r\nin the South of Europe, in Asia Minor, and in the East Indies.\"[80]\r\n\r\nProfessor Houston furnishes the following table in illustration of\r\nthe distribution of _wheat_ and _barley_. It also shows the mean\r\ntemperature which they require:--\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\n                                 Winter  Summer  Annual\r\n                                 Mean.   Mean.

Many seeds, with winged and feathery appendages, are easily\r\nwafted about; others are carried by rivers and streams, and some can\r\nbe transported by the ocean currents to a great distance, with their\r\ngenerating powers unimpaired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS OR AGARICS (_Order_ FUNGI).\r\n\r\nEvery year--principally in autumn--we are startled by hearing or\r\nreading of cases of poisoning by mushrooms. Erudite connoisseurs,\r\nhowever, who have profited by Dr Badham's book on \"Esculent Fungi,\"\r\ndo not suffer themselves to be intimidated by these sad narratives,\r\nthough, unfortunately, they are frequently too well founded; because\r\nthey know how to distinguish the good from the ill, the true from\r\nthe false, the edible from the poisonous mushroom. But this security\r\nought not to embolden the inexperienced amateur in risking his\r\nlife for the sake of a delicacy. It is true, nevertheless, that we\r\nfrequently see men's lives exposed for something less.\r\n\r\n\"Look, what a splendid mushroom I have discovered!\" a lady said to\r\nme, the other day; a lady who knew something of flowers, but nothing\r\nof _cryptogams_. \"Take care!\" I replied, taking from her hand the\r\nsupposed prize; \"this is the false mushroom; and would suffice, if\r\nserved up at your table, to poison yourself and all your guests.\"\r\n\r\nI ought here to observe that my friend had narrowly escaped death\r\ntwo years before, through regaling herself with a dish of mushrooms\r\nof very dubious character. Among the symptoms which she experienced,\r\nand which she described with medical exactness, she particularly\r\ndwelt upon the cold sweats, accompanied by a sentiment of undefinable\r\nterror, which is nothing else than the dread of death: it was the\r\nspecial symptom of poisoning with an unwholesome fungus.\r\n\r\nLet us endeavour to make ourselves better acquainted with this\r\nformidable enemy of epicures. You will have no difficulty in finding\r\nit in any warm, close season, but especially in spring and autumn.\r\nThe toadstool thrives indifferently in the shade of all the forest\r\ntrees, but seems to prefer the oak and birch to the pine and fir.\r\nA patch of soft greensward, at the foot of an old oak, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of a \"brawling stream\" or \"tranquil pool,\" will\r\ngenerally be covered with fungi of this description. The numerous\r\nsynonyms attaching to it show how greatly it has exercised the\r\n_classifying spirit_ of our naturalists. Some call it _Agaricus\r\nmuscarius_, as if we should say \"kill-fly mushroom;\" others,\r\nchanging only the specific designation, designate it _Agaricus\r\npseudo-aurantiacus_,--which signifies, literally, \"false orange,\" in\r\nallusion to the beautiful yellow colour of the _true_ aurantiacus.\r\nWhat is certain is, that our mushroom, which can kill men as well as\r\nflies, belongs to the genus _Agaric_, so numerous in species that it\r\ncan be formed into a family, that of the _Agariceæ_. The Agarics, of\r\nwhich the esculent mushroom (_Agaricus edulis_) represents the type,\r\nare easily recognised by their more or less fleshy _pileus_, or cap,\r\ngarnished underneath with _lamellæ_, or gills, which radiate from the\r\ncentre to the circumference, when the pedicel is in the centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--\"At the foot of an old oak.\"]\r\n\r\nBut some cryptogamists are unwilling to recognise the _orange\r\nmushrooms_ (_les oronges_), whether true or false, as Agarics. They\r\nplace them in a separate genus, the genus _Amanita_, though without\r\ninforming us where they found the name. Meanwhile, they justify the\r\nformation of the new genus by the presence of the white swelling,\r\nthe _volva_, or wrapper, of the _mycelium_, or spawn, which entirely\r\ncovers both the true and the false mushroom on its emergence from the\r\nearth. Each, then, is an _Amanita_. But now remark their specific\r\ndifference. The true mushroom, as it develops, ruptures its ovoid\r\nwrapper, or volva, leaving the remains entirely at the base of the\r\npedicel; while, in the false mushroom, the débris of the volva are\r\nformed, not only at the base of the pedicel, as in the real Agaric,\r\nbut even upon the red surface of the pileus itself: these are the\r\nwhite irregular warts characteristic of the Amanita, but wholly\r\nwanting in the Agaricus. Thus, there are two Amanitas: the _Amanita\r\nmuscaria_, or \"fly agaric,\" and the _Amanita aurantiaca_, or, as the\r\nEnglish botanists call it, _Agaricus Cæsareus_, the imperial mushroom.\r\n\r\nThis fanciful \"study\" in nomenclature has the advantage of initiating\r\nus into the most essential distinctive characters of the two species\r\nin question. However, a few additional details are necessary to\r\ncomplete our history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLY AGARIC, OR AMANITA MUSCARIA.\r\n\r\nThe species seems to have been expressly created to teach our\r\ngourmands the necessity of vigilance; that before enjoying a dainty\r\nthey must first learn to distinguish, under penalty of death, the\r\npoisonous fungus from that which safely and pleasantly tickles\r\nthe palate. The warning is useful, moreover, as showing that even\r\nsensualists are not wholly exempt from the law of work.\r\n\r\nThe _Amanita_, like most falsehoods, is pleasant to the sight. Its\r\nround pileus, of a beautiful orange-red colour, spotted with white\r\nwarts, and lined with white gills, seems to invite your attention.\r\n(Fig. 73.) Strike it down with your stick; the lamellæ or gills\r\nunderneath resemble the white leaves of a book. Its graceful stalk,\r\nornamented on the upper part by a well-designed necklet, is bulbous\r\nin its lower portion; its flesh is dazzlingly white; in short, its\r\nentire appearance is attractive. Yet it is a traitor! You little know\r\nthe depth of its wickedness. Mix a few shreds of its white flesh with\r\na little milk; every fly which drinks of the mixture will, in a few\r\nseconds, fall dead, their swollen abdomen bearing testimony to the\r\neffect of the poison. And in many districts of Germany, particularly\r\nin Thuringia, the peasants make use of it to rid themselves of the\r\nswarms of flies which, towards the close of summer, infest their\r\nhabitations. It is thus that man may frequently turn to his advantage\r\nthose objects of nature which, at the first glance, appear injurious\r\nrather than useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--The _Amanita Muscaria_.]\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have been essayed to test the intoxicating\r\ninfluence of our _Amanita_. Bulliard, author of the \"Histoire des\r\nChampignons de France,\" made two cats partake of it. Six hours\r\nafterwards, these animals, who are so tenacious of life, were dead.\r\n\r\nHaller, in his \"Histoire des Plantes Vénéneuses de la Suisse,\" says\r\nthat \"the _Agaricus muscarius_ (_Amanita muscaria_) cannot be eaten\r\nwith impunity, six Lithuanians having died of it; and in Kamtschatka\r\nit has been known to excite deadly attacks of delirium, accompanied\r\nby so deep a despondency, that those who have eaten of it would\r\nfain fling themselves into the fire, or fall upon their knives or\r\ndaggers.\" This, however, we take to be an exaggeration. The truth\r\nis, that in Kamtschatka it is used to produce intoxication; and such\r\nis its strength, it imparts an intoxicating property to the urine\r\nof those who swallow it. When the fungus itself is not at hand, the\r\nwould-be drunkard frequently resorts to this nauseous potion.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the _Amanita_ is not yellow. Yet Vicat speaks of\r\npoisonings produced by the _Yellow Amanita_. \"I had much difficulty,\"\r\nsays this physician, \"in saving two families of Lausanne, poisoned\r\nthrough eating a very small quantity of mushrooms, which the father\r\nin the one case, and the mother in the other, had mistaken for\r\n_Agarici Cæsarei_, though they were both esteemed great connoisseurs,\r\nand especially in this species; nor had they been once deceived for\r\nupwards of thirty years, until they indulged themselves in this\r\ndelicious but deceitful dish.\"\r\n\r\nThese poisonings could have been occasioned only by the _Amanita_.\r\nSome varieties exist, in which the under surface of the pileus is\r\nyellow, but the flesh is white. To one of these varieties Vicat's\r\nanecdote probably refers.\r\n\r\nThus, the _Amanita formosa_ of Persoon has pedicel, pileus, and\r\nwarts of the pileus, of a citron yellow. It is but a variety of the\r\n_Amanita muscaria_.\r\n\r\nThe _Amanita umbrina_ of the same botanist (the _Agaricus\r\npantherinus_ of De Candolle) has an olive-coloured pileus; its\r\nsurface, like that of _Amanita muscaria_, is covered with white\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThe _Amanita solitarius_ is distinguished by the size of its\r\numbilical cap,--sometimes depressed in the centre,--which is\r\nfurnished with a great number of white or pale brown scales; when\r\nfully developed, it measures from thirty to forty centimetres in\r\ndiameter. The pedicel is bulbous, with a membranous ring, white as\r\nsnow, clasped around it; at the base it is clothed in pellicles, the\r\nremains of its scaly volva. The flesh is firm, thick, and white.\r\nYou rarely meet with more than two or three individuals in the\r\nsame locality; hence its name of _solitarius_. Bulliard speaks of\r\nthe flesh as good to eat, when cooked on a gridiron, and seasoned\r\nwith fresh butter, salt, and pepper. It is possible. But as it is\r\nso easily confused with the poisonous species, the author of the\r\n\"Histoire des Champignons\" would have done better to prohibit its\r\nconsumption, whether eatable or not.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to the method adopted by Dr Vicat to save the lives\r\nof the two families at Lausanne, who, as we have seen, were poisoned\r\nby partaking of the _Amanita_:--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI dissolved, he says, six grains of tartar emetic in a litre of\r\nwater, and from time to time administered a spoonful to my patients;\r\nmoreover, I made them swallow floods of warm water, sweetened with a\r\nlittle honey,--that is, a large tea-spoonful of honey to a cupful of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nI had much difficulty to get one of the sufferers, who was sixty\r\nyears old, to swallow the first few spoonfuls. He was plunged into\r\na lethargic insensibility differing in no respect from complete\r\napoplexy; his teeth were closely set. Those whom I had ordered\r\nto administer the mixture had given it up, after several useless\r\nattempts; and in all probability the old man would have sunk, had I\r\nnot had the patience to hold, for some hours, against his teeth the\r\nback of the blade of a small silver knife, so as to profit by the\r\nfew moments when the teeth were a little less firmly clenched. I\r\nused some force to make the blade act as a wedge, and after a while\r\nopened up a passage to the handle, which, serving as a lever, forced\r\nthe jaws sufficiently apart to admit the introduction of a spoonful\r\nof the emetic. It was not, however, until fully two hours had passed\r\nthat the patient, having undoubtedly swallowed the necessary dose,\r\nbegan to vomit, with strenuous efforts and frightful cries. This\r\nwas at midnight. Four in the morning arrived before, after numerous\r\nalternations of vomiting and profound lethargy, he began to speak,\r\nand then like a man in delirium. After the first vomit, which was\r\ninconsiderable, the convulsions of his whole body were so very\r\nviolent as to require four men to hold him, while I continued to make\r\nuse of my knife as at first. Nor did I desist until I was satisfied\r\nthat his stomach had been sufficiently cleansed. After this, I\r\napplied two strong blisters to the back of his legs. As these acted,\r\nthe purging subsided, and at the end of twenty-four hours it had\r\npassed away entirely, the invalid finding himself as well as could\r\nbe expected after sustaining so severe a shock. The other patients,\r\nwho were not in so much danger, experienced twitchings and tremblings\r\nin the face, which quite disfigured them; the brain seemed a blank;\r\nthough awake, they felt as in a dream, and their visions were most\r\nfrightful.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from these particulars, that mushroom-poisoning\r\nspecially affects the encephalic nervous system, and that the best\r\nremedies are emetics and antispasmodics. In our present ignorance of\r\nwhat are the poisonous principles in the _Amanita_, we can adopt no\r\nother method than a chemical neutralisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGARICUS CÆSAREUS, OR IMPERIAL MUSHROOM.\r\n\r\nIn this mushroom, for which, as we have seen, the _Amanita_ is too\r\nfrequently mistaken, the inside as well as the outside is yellow;\r\nthe upper surface of the pileus, which is equally free from scales\r\nand warts, is, however, of a reddish yellow, like that of an orange\r\n(whence the popular French name, _la vrai oronge_); all the other\r\nparts are of a beautiful citron hue. This agaric exhales an agreeable\r\nodour, combined apparently of the scent of the vanilla and the\r\ntruffle. It decomposes rapidly, and when in a state of advanced\r\nputridity, the fragrance I speak of is succeeded by--well, by a\r\nfearful stench! When young, and still completely covered with its\r\nwrapper or _volva_ (this, in the _Amanita_, is imperfect), it is very\r\nlike a hen's egg which has been partly buried in the ground so as\r\nto expose only the larger end. It seems partial to solitude; more\r\nthan four or five are seldom found in the same locality. Moreover,\r\nin autumn it affects the same habitats as the _Amanita_,--which is\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that our imperial mushroom was specially appreciated by\r\nthe ancients, and it is said that Nero pronounced it a dish fit for\r\nthe gods. In this circumstance originated the scientific name which\r\nhas now become popular, and which was first applied to it by the\r\ncryptogamist Fries, _Agaricus Cæsareus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--The Imperial Mushroom.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Boletus_ of Pliny appears to have been our Agaricus, and not\r\none of our _Boleti_, which are easily recognised by the numerous\r\ntubercular projections covering the under part of the pileus. In\r\nproof of this I would point out that the Roman naturalist, after\r\nspeaking of the _Boleti_ as genuine delicacies, immediately inveighs\r\nagainst them as dangerously poisonous. He relates that it was with\r\none of these, or rather with one of the false mushrooms so easily\r\nmistaken for the true, that Agrippina poisoned the Emperor Claudius,\r\nto secure the imperial crown for her son Nero.[81]\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the mushrooms have been sung by Juvenal and Martial.\r\nThe latter accurately distinguishes the true from the false, when\r\nreproaching Cæcilianus with his gluttony.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you are used to devour your _Boleti_ alone, in the face of your\r\ninvited guests; eat then, the _Boletus_ which Claudius ate!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Dic mihi, quis furor est? Turba spectante vocata,\r\n    Solus boletos, Cæciliane, voras.\r\n    Quid dignum tanto tibi ventri, gulaque precabor?\r\n    Boletum, qualem Claudius edit, edas.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThe best known and most valuable species of Agarici may be briefly\r\nenumerated:--\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus campestris_, or _Common Mushroom_, found in nearly all\r\n      temperate regions: pileus convex, and white, with a tinge of\r\n      brown; thick set on the under side with dark brown gills; stem\r\n      firm and fleshy, and surrounded by a white membranous ring.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus Cæsareus_, or _Imperial Mushroom_, the _Kaiserling_ of\r\n      the Germans, already described.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus deliciosus_, or _Orange-milked Agaric_, found in\r\n      coverts of fir and juniper; pileus viscid, orange, and upwards of\r\n      four inches broad; gills and juice of a fine orange colour.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus procerus_, or _Parasol Mushroom_, found in the shade of\r\n      trees, on meadows with a sandy soil; stem from eight to twelve\r\n      inches high, with a thick spongy ring; pileus bell-shaped, and\r\n      covered with brown scales.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus Virgineus_, or _White Field Agaric_, found in rich\r\n      moist pastures; pileus whitish, and convex; gills of a light\r\n      chocolate shade; stem nearly two inches broad.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus eburneus_, or _Ivory Mushroom_, found in beech woods;\r\n      grayish-yellow pileus; broad gills; stem long and scaly.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus Georgii_, _St George's Agaric_, or _Whitecaps_, found\r\n      in moist pastures, and in the shelter of old barns, farmhouses,\r\n      and churches; flesh yellow; gills yellowish-white; pileus twelve\r\n      to eighteen inches broad; the least valuable of British species\r\n      of agaric, but useful in ketchup-making.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus oreades_, _Fairy-ring Mushroom_, or _Scotch bonnets_,\r\n      found in meadows, where it grows in circles known as \"fairy\r\n      rings;\" pileus seldom exceeds an inch in diameter; stem solid,\r\n      tough, and fibrous, with a boss or _umbo_ in the centre, of a\r\n      light brown colour; the flesh white, and of a pleasant odour.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus odorus_, _Anise Mushroom_, or _Sweet-scented Agaric_;\r\n      pileus slightly convex, about three inches broad, and with pale\r\n      gills; the scent like that of anise; stem strong, fleshy, but not\r\n      very tall.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus formosus_, or _Smoky Mushroom_; so called from the\r\n      colour of the upper surface of the pileus; the stalk and gills of\r\n      a pale yellow; grows in fir woods.\r\n\r\n      _Agaricus primulus_, or _Mousseron_, grows in woods and pastures,\r\n      where the soil is sandy; pileus convex, yellow, about three or\r\n      four inches in diameter; gills change from white to flesh colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How many Vegetable Species exist over the whole surface of the\r\nGlobe?_\r\n\r\nI will not do my readers the injustice to suppose that they are\r\nunacquainted with the writings of our greatest English poetess,\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning. They will not fail to have been attracted\r\nby the prodigal genius, the superabundant power, the exquisite\r\nimagery, the profound spirit of tenderness, the high, pure thoughts,\r\nwhich render almost every page such delightful reading. Successful as\r\nshe was, however, in giving expression to the most subtle emotions\r\nand the intensest feeling, I think she was even happier in her\r\ndescriptions of scenery. These are invariably aglow with life and\r\ncolour, and have all the fidelity of Creswick with the imaginative\r\ninsight of Turner. Turning over her \"Aurora Leigh,\" the other day, I\r\nlighted on the following beautiful picture:--\r\n\r\n    \"I flattered all the beauteous country round,\r\n    As poets use--the skies, the clouds, the fields,\r\n    The happy violets, hiding from the roads\r\n    The primroses run down to, carrying gold--\r\n    The tangled hedgerows, where the rows push out\r\n    Their tolerant horns and patient churning mouths\r\n    'Twixt dripping ash-boughs--hedgerows all alive\r\n    With birds, and gnats, and large white butterflies,\r\n    Which look as if the May-flower had caught life\r\n    And palpitated forth upon the wind:\r\n    Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist;\r\n    Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills,\r\n    And cattle grazing in the watered vales,\r\n    And cottage chimneys smoking from the woods,\r\n    And cottage gardens smelling everywhere,\r\n    Confused with smell of orchards.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--\"And cattle grazing in the watered vales.\"]\r\n\r\nAs I read this fine passage, the thought occurred to me, how many\r\nthousands there are who, in such a scene as it so vividly depicts,\r\nwould see no beauty whatever, whose heart would not respond to\r\nit, whose sympathies would not be aroused by all its variety of\r\noutline and all its rich magnificence of colour! Yet not in so wide\r\na landscape alone, but in the smallest nook,--in the little clump\r\nof elms by the side of the stream, in yonder grassy knoll rising\r\nstraight up from the old churchyard, in the quiet angle of the green\r\npasture-meadows,--there is a whole world of wonder and beauty for him\r\nwho has eyes to see and a heart to feel! Look at the flowery bank\r\nwhich runs along the side of an English lane. Is it not crowded with\r\nobjects of the rarest and purest interest? Count the many varieties\r\nof grasses which clothe it so abundantly, count the many species of\r\nflowers and herbs which adorn it with a grace beyond all human skill,\r\nand acknowledge that in itself it might supply the inquirer with\r\nmatter for years of study and meditation.\r\n\r\nPursuing this train of thought, I was led to think of the number\r\nof genera and species into which the plant world is divided,--a\r\nremarkable proof, not only of the power and wisdom, but of the\r\ngoodness of the Creator, of His desire to furnish man with\r\ninexhaustible sources of pleasure and entertainment; and finally, to\r\nput to myself the question, How many vegetable species exist over the\r\nwhole surface of the globe? If this corner of a leafy English lane is\r\nso rich in variety, what must be the case with \"the wide, wide world?\"\r\n\r\nI was now brought to see that a question so difficult could, like so\r\nmany others, be usefully approached only by its _inferior limit_;\r\nin other words, that in the actual condition of botanical science,\r\nwe can but affirm the number which certainly _exceeds_ the sum of\r\nthe vegetable species scattered over the surface of our earth. To\r\ndetermine this total with mathematical accuracy, we should need to\r\nhave explored the terrestrial crust, liquid and solid, land and\r\nwater, from the bed of ocean to the line of perpetual snow, and\r\nfrom the equator to the poles. And as yet we are very far from\r\nhaving obtained so complete a possession of the planet which has\r\nbeen assigned as a dwelling-place to our poor humanity,--alas, more\r\npresumptuous than powerful!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of plants mentioned by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and\r\nPliny, whom we take to be the representatives of ancient botany,\r\ndoes not exceed five hundred species. How very few, compared with\r\nthe presumable total! The Middle Ages added scarcely anything to the\r\nbotanical researches of antiquity. It is only since the discovery of\r\nAmerica that we have seen the domain of Flora extending itself in\r\nunexpected proportions. But we must come down to the epoch of Linnæus\r\n(the middle of the eighteenth century) before we can obtain an\r\naccurate list of species, scientifically classified. Murray's edition\r\nof the \"_Specilegium_\" of Linnæus contains two thousand and forty-two\r\nspecies, including the Cryptogams. Wildmore, in another edition of\r\nthe same great work, raised the total to twenty thousand. And this\r\nwas the point at which our botanists had arrived when the nineteenth\r\ncentury opened.\r\n\r\nBut it was not long before they perceived that all these estimates,\r\nlarge as they seemed, fell immeasurably short of the reality. In\r\nattempting to distribute the different species among the then known\r\nregions of the globe, Alexander von Humboldt arrived at a total of\r\nforty-four thousand species, Phanerogams and Cryptogams included. De\r\nCandolle extended the estimate to upwards of fifty-six thousand.\r\n\r\nLet us divide, in fancy, the earth into two parts,--one which has\r\nbeen visited by travellers, and one which still remains to be\r\nexplored. Can you determine which would present the larger area? The\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThus we possess but a very imperfect knowledge of the luxuriant, the\r\nglowing vegetation of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the\r\nNew World, in spite of the labours of Bates, Agassiz, Wallace, and\r\nothers. To the north of the equator, we know very little of the flora\r\nof Yucatan, Guatemala, Nicaragua, the isthmus of Panama, the Chaco\r\nof Antioquius, the province of Los Pastos. We are not much better\r\nacquainted with the vegetation of the countries south of the equator.\r\nWhat do we know of the manifold species flourishing in Paraguay, in\r\nthe province of the Missions, in the immense wooded region between\r\nthe Ucayali, the Rio de la Madeira, and the Tocantin, three affluents\r\nof the mighty river Amazon? We know scarcely anything.\r\n\r\nOur ignorance increases if from America we pass to Africa. Nearly\r\nthe whole interior of this continent, from 15° N. latitude to 20°\r\nS. latitude, is, botanically speaking, a blank to us. The same is\r\nthe case with the greater portion of Central Asia. The floras of the\r\nsouth and south-east of Arabia are still sealed letters,--treasuries\r\nto which we have not found the key. As much may be said of the floras\r\nof the countries situated between the Thian-Schan, the Kuenlung, and\r\nthe Himalaya, as well as of the floras of western China, and most of\r\nthe trans-Gangetic countries. We know still less of the vegetation of\r\nthe interior of Madagascar, Borneo, New Guinea, and the greater part\r\nof Australia. To conclude: we are probably not acquainted with more\r\nthan one-fifth of the vegetable species which cover the surface of\r\nour globe.\r\n\r\nThere are regions, moreover, which we imagine will always lie\r\noutside of our sphere of investigation; such, for instance, are\r\nthe Polar regions, properly so called. Undoubtedly, it is open to\r\nus to conjecture that the Poles--those two extremities of our axis\r\nof planetary rotation--are not the home of any form of life. But\r\nthis is only a conjecture; we are even without an analogy for it;\r\nsince we have found, as shown in an earlier chapter of the present\r\nvolume, living beings, plants, and animals, among the snows of our\r\nloftiest mountains. Moreover, might not the auroras, whose maximum\r\nof intensity occurs exactly at the poles, render life possible in\r\nregions where we at present suppose it to be _im_possible? Conjecture\r\nfor conjecture,--acknowledge that we here touch in both cases upon an\r\nelement completely beyond our human power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the reasons why, at present, we can only venture\r\nupon defining the _lower_ limit, the _restricted_ number, above which\r\nwe are unable to fix the total of vegetable species living on the\r\nsurface of our planet.\r\n\r\nThe method to be adopted has been indicated by Alexander von Humboldt\r\nin his \"Ansichten der Natur\" (\"Pictures of Nature\"). His method\r\nconsists in the comparison of the vegetable families whose numerical\r\nrelations are _known_, with the number of species contained in our\r\nherbariums, or cultivated in our botanical gardens.\r\n\r\nBut here, at the outset, a difficulty confronts us. Does any relation\r\nexist between the classification of plants by natural families and by\r\ntheir geographical distribution?\r\n\r\nTo group plants according to their analogies of structure, we study\r\nthem from an abstract point of view, and without any regard to the\r\nmedium in which they flourish. The question grows complicated if we\r\nalso take into consideration their characteristic conditions and\r\ntheir distribution over the terrestrial surface. Families are then\r\nsplit asunder, and the importance of our scientific classifications\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nThe gathering together of a small number of species, represented by\r\ninnumerable individuals, confined within the same area, may suffice\r\nto communicate to a landscape its characteristic physiognomy: as,\r\nfor example, is the case with the Asiatic steppes, the _landes_ of\r\nBrittany, the moors of Scotland, the palm-groves and the clumps of\r\nCactaceæ of tropical America. By the side of species which impress us\r\nby their _mass_--that is, by the frequent reproduction of the same\r\nindividuals at an infinitesimal distance from one another--are placed\r\nthose much more numerous species which are everywhere very thinly\r\nsown.\r\n\r\nBut do the plants themselves follow, from the equator to the poles,\r\nthe same law of _decrease_ as obtains from the base to the summit of\r\nthe loftiest equatorial mountains?\r\n\r\nUnder identical isothermal lines, is the ratio of families known and\r\nidentified to the probable aggregate of Phanerogams the same, in the\r\ntemperate zone, on either side of the equator?\r\n\r\nWhat are the vegetable families which preponderate at the two\r\nextremes, represented by the torrid and the frigid zones?\r\n\r\nUnder the same geographical latitude, or between the same isothermal\r\nlines, are the Synantheræ, the Gramineæ, the Leguminosæ, the Labiatæ,\r\nthe Cruciferæ, the Umbelliferæ, more numerous in the Old than in the\r\nNew World?\r\n\r\nWhat families, either through their mass of individuals or their\r\nnumber of species, take precedence of the other Phanerogams?\r\n\r\nHow many species of one and the same family belong to any particular\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nWhat groups or families are characteristic of each zone?\r\n\r\nIs the present classification of genera and species in all respects\r\nwhat could be desired?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese are questions that require to be considered, and to some of\r\nthem we shall presently attempt replies.\r\n\r\nHerbariums, though their classification is too frequently imperfect,\r\nmay furnish us with data of great utility. The great herbarium of\r\nBenjamin Delessert was estimated, after his death, to contain 86,000\r\nspecies,--a total not widely differing from that which Lindley, in\r\n1835, estimated as the probable aggregate of the vegetable species of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nGreat in importance are botanic gardens. Loudon, in his _Hortus\r\nBritannicus_ (ed. 1832), places at 22,660 the number of Phanerogams\r\ncultivated in the gardens of the Bristol amateur botanists. With\r\nthis number we must not confound the living species exhibited, in\r\nother counties, in gardens designed for the instruction of students,\r\nnor the grand total reared for a similar purpose at Kew. Kunth's\r\nenumeration, in 1861, of the plants at the Botanic Gardens at Berlin,\r\none of the richest in Europe, amounted to upwards of 14,000 species,\r\nincluding 375 heaths. Among the Phanerogams were 1600 Synantheræ,\r\n1150 Leguminosæ, 428 Labiatæ, 370 Umbelliferæ, 460 Orchidaceæ, 60\r\nPalmaceæ, 600 Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ, &c. By comparing these data\r\nwith the number of species described in the works of De Candolle,\r\nWalpers, Bentham, Lindley, Kunth, and others, we find that in the\r\nBerlin gardens are cultivated only one-seventh of the known species\r\nof the Synantheræ, one-eighth of the Leguminosæ, one-ninth of the\r\nGramineæ, and about one-fiftieth of the smaller families, such as the\r\nLabiatæ and Umbelliferæ.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow, if we admit that, on the one hand, the number of phanerogamous\r\nspecies cultivated in all the great gardens of Europe is about\r\n30,000, and, on the other, that the cultivated Phanerogams form about\r\none-eighth part of the species described in books and preserved in\r\nherbariums, we obtain a total of 24,000 species.\r\n\r\nBut the Cryptogams, or Agams, such as heaths, mosses, lichens,\r\nmushrooms, fungi, mould, and the like, of which our knowledge, as\r\nyet, is very imperfect, are probably much more numerous in species\r\nthan the Phanerogams; for these vegetables, mostly microscopical,\r\ndevelop themselves wherever life can manifest itself--on the barren\r\nand denuded rocks, as well as in the air and in the depths of the\r\nocean. If we suppose that they exceed only by 2000 the estimated\r\nnumber of Phanerogams, we shall obtain a total of just half-a-million!\r\n\r\nSuch, in our opinion, is the number which approximatively represents\r\nthe lower limit of the aggregate of vegetable species (phanerogamous\r\nand cryptogamous) inhabiting our planet. The innumerable individuals\r\nof this half-million of species are born, and live, and reproduce\r\ntheir kind, and die, like the twelve hundred millions of individuals\r\nof our solitary human species. The former, it is true, remain fixed\r\nto the soil which has witnessed their birth, while the latter wander,\r\nmore or less freely over the terrestrial surface. Do not animals\r\nenjoy the same privilege of locomotion? Undoubtedly. But men boast of\r\nthe reason and the conscience with which they are endowed. Agreed.\r\nBut with the exception of a small number--the infinite minority of\r\nprogress--to what advantage have men employed the reason and the\r\nconscience of which they boast?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut this is a digression. We proceed to place before the reader\r\na few final data in illustration of the subject we have been\r\nconsidering--the number of existing vegetable species.\r\n\r\nThe following is an estimate of the known species of plants on the\r\nglobe at different dates:--\r\n\r\n                                 Phanerogams.

If there should be one to\r\nsell, pray let me know of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long before an opportunity arose for my friend to satisfy\r\nhis desire. But after I had made him acquainted with it, he declared\r\nhimself no longer willing to purchase a property in a district where,\r\nas he had learned, one was devoured by _red beasts_ all through the\r\nfinest months of the year. What a frightful neighbourhood to live\r\nin, where you were forbidden to walk in your garden under pain of\r\ncatching an itch in your legs!\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, it is only too true that the cultivated ground,\r\nwhether on the northern or the southern slope of the forest, is\r\ninfested, from the beginning of summer to the beginning of winter,\r\nby Lilliputian horrors, like so many tiny red points, which cling\r\nobstinately to the skin, and there deposit, under the epidermis,\r\ntheir microscopic brood. Once planted there, the _rougets_, as the\r\nFrench call them, or _harvest bugs_, as we English call them, effect\r\nconsiderable mischief; and if, to relieve one's self, one indulges\r\nin \"a scratch,\" the cutaneous surface is quickly covered by small\r\nblisters, which on a cursory examination might be taken for a skin\r\naffection not generally named in polite hearing.\r\n\r\nBut one does not perceive the galleries excavated by these annoying\r\ninsects, positive tunnels or covered ways, through which they proceed\r\nto pour forth elsewhere the superfluity of their numerous progeny.\r\nLess prolific than the _Acari_, which create upon the skin immense\r\npatches of irritation, the harvest bugs confine themselves to a few\r\ncircumscribed localities: their favourite choice being the legs, the\r\narms, and the corners of the eyes, especially among young children.\r\nThey are not above domestic animals; cats and dogs frequently suffer\r\nfrom them,--not, indeed, over the whole surface of the body, for they\r\nare not so wandering as the _Acari_,--but particularly inside the\r\nshell of the ear.\r\n\r\nAt the first glance you would scarcely believe that those red points,\r\napparently immovable, could be living beings,--could be animals\r\nbelonging to an order of some importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us attempt to isolate one of the animalcules with the point of a\r\npin: it is not an easy thing to do, because they usually adhere to\r\nthe epidermis in clusters of three or four individuals. There, now we\r\nhave succeeded, and here is one before us: it is only the fifth of\r\na millimètre in diameter, which is, for most people, the very last\r\nlimit of the visual function (see the small white line in Fig. 76,\r\n_a_). And, in truth, it _would_ be imperceptible to the eye but for\r\nits bright red colour. To study it carefully, of course, you must\r\nmake use of a very strong lens, or, rather, of a microscope. (See\r\nFig. 76, _b_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--_a Leptus Autumnalis_ (nat. size). _b_ Ditto\r\n(mag.).]\r\n\r\nTo this tiny animal has been given the name of _Leptus autumnalis_;\r\nthe first, on account of its extreme delicacy; the second, because\r\nit is visible up to the end of autumn.\r\n\r\nWhen examined through a microscope, it produces on the spectator the\r\nimpression of a spider; but, like all other insects, it has only six\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nOur naturalists, however, have found some difficulty in classifying\r\nit; and by way of cutting the Gordian knot of their embarrassments,\r\nsome have placed it in a separate family of _Microphthiræ_ (literally\r\n\"little lice\"), which is made to include all Arachnidæ with six legs.\r\nOthers, who regard the wheat worm as an insect, rank it among the\r\nparasitical Apteræ.\r\n\r\nIn effect, it has all the characters of the parasitical insect--its\r\nprotracted head, distinct from the rest of its body, is sometimes\r\nthrust forward in quest of its food, sometimes drawn back or\r\nconcealed, to protect it from danger. Intended to suck rather than\r\nto knead or bruise, it has a sucker, but no mandibles. The head is\r\nwithout antennæ, and its palpi are very short, barely visible, and\r\nof a conical form. The body is ovular and very soft (whence the\r\nGrecian name _leptus_, λεπτός, signifying \"soft\"). The anterior\r\npart, corresponding to the thorax, is broader than it is long, and\r\nis marked underneath, on each side of the central line, by a black\r\npoint: these two points, symmetrically placed, appear to represent\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nThe posterior portion, corresponding to the abdomen, is longer than\r\nit is broad, and covered with hairs. Each leg consists of six joints,\r\neasily distinguished by the hairs inserted at each articulation; and\r\neach terminates in a couple of strong crooked _claws_, which enable\r\nthe animal to obtain a firm hold on the skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, then, to judge from the aggregate of its characters, the\r\nharvest bug, _Leptus autumnalis_, belongs to the class Arachnidæ,\r\nwhile the number of its feet places it in the class Insects. But this\r\nis a detail which causes little annoyance to a person being devoured\r\nby the \"red beasts,\" and only anxious to rid himself of them.\r\n\r\nBut if such be his desire, let me tell him that the best remedies are\r\nbathing the afflicted part with lotions of vinegar, or rubbing it\r\nwith sulphur ointment.\r\n\r\nI have been asked whether certain tiny parasites, such as the\r\n_Ocypete rubra_,--which is also red, and has six feet like the\r\n_Leptus autumnalis_, but which, instead of attacking man and his\r\ndomestic companions, attaches itself to flies,--I have been asked\r\nwhether these insectiform Arachnidæ may not be species of larva not\r\nyet arrived at their matured condition.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I must acknowledge that, whether the _Ocypete rubra_\r\nis or is not the transitory state of a more perfect animal, I do\r\nnot know. But I am sure that the _Leptus autumnalis_ lives and dies\r\non the skin where it has selected its dwelling-place,--a _living_\r\ndwelling-place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be too circumspect in the determination of\r\ncertain genera and species, whose different phases of existence\r\nare little known, and which seem, so far as their characteristics\r\nare concerned, to participate of several orders or classes of\r\narticulated animals. The errors which have been committed in this\r\nrespect ought at least to teach us caution.\r\n\r\nThus, the red, oval, six-legged animalcules, whose mobile heads are\r\nfurnished with a proboscis shaped like an angular beak, and whose\r\ntwo palpi are large and semi-transparent,--the singular animalcules\r\nwhich, in June or July, are hatched in the spongy stems of certain\r\naquatic vegetables,--notably the _Potamogeton natans_,--have been\r\ndescribed[83] as forming a peculiar genus of Arachnidæ, the genus\r\n_Achlysia_; and this genus, created by Audouin, was ranked along\r\nwith the _Leptus_ and _Ocypete_ in the family of Microphthiræ. Yet\r\nnothing is less exact. These Achlysia are simply the larvæ of a kind\r\nof _Hydrachna_ or water-acarus. To be convinced of this, you have\r\nbut to watch their development. At first very small and pear-shaped,\r\nthese larvæ, deprived, like all larvæ, of the reproductive organs,\r\nrapidly increase in size. At the end of a few weeks you will see\r\nthem adhering to a leaf of potamogeton; they thrust their proboscis\r\ninto the stem, and cling to it with their palpi. Little by little,\r\nthe legs, the proboscis, and the palpi, are drawn back towards the\r\nbody, abandoning the skin which has hitherto formed for each of these\r\norgans a kind of horny sheath. From the larva state, the animal\r\npasses into that of the nymph. But this nymph continues to feed and\r\nenlarge; proboscis, legs, and palpi grow thinner and harder; claws,\r\nciliæ, and hairs are developed; and, finally, through a fissure in\r\nthe skin emerges the perfect animal, red as wine, with eight feet,\r\nand about two millimetres in length. This animal, placed in the\r\nfamily of the _Hydrachnellæ_, has been described by De Geer under\r\nthe name of _Acarus aquaticus globosus_, and by Dugès under that of\r\n_Hydrachna globosa_, on account of its globular form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEESE MITE.\r\n\r\nFrom the crust of a dry old cheese,--such a kind of cheese as a\r\n_bon-vivant_ likes with a glass of \"good old ale,\"--a very fine\r\npowder often crumbles off, like the dust made by wood-eating worms.\r\n\r\nExamine this powder with your lens, or if you have good eyes, you may\r\nmake use of _them_. You will quickly detect something moving in it,\r\nand by degrees you will see that this movement pervades the whole\r\nmass; that there is a general stir and commotion in all directions.\r\n\r\nBut you find it impossible to distinguish clearly the form of the\r\nanimals which are thus agitated. You are certain, however, that they\r\nare not maggots, for _they_ affect moist cheeses; besides, they are\r\nvisible enough to everybody, and at need can make themselves _felt_\r\nupon your hands, and even upon your face, for they have a faculty of\r\nlaunching themselves to a distance by a little manœuvre familiar\r\nenough to serpents: bringing the head round towards the tail, they\r\ncurve themselves like the spring of a watch, then abruptly uncoiling\r\nthemselves with the help of some solid _appui_, they fling forth into\r\nthe air, and are thus launched to very considerable distances. It is\r\na curious species of locomotion, not unworthy the attention of the\r\nmechanician.\r\n\r\nTo clear up the mystery of a movement whose cause is not apparent at\r\nthe first glance, let us sprinkle with this impalpable débris,--with\r\nthis kind of sawdust, or _cheese_-dust,--a little strip of glass, and\r\nplace it beneath the focus of a microscope.\r\n\r\nAh! you exclaim, what a frightful creature! These long sharp ciliæ\r\nseem to be so many lancets covering the whole body, and especially\r\nthe legs; its head, like that of the harvest-bug, protrudes and\r\nrecedes under a transparent carapace; thus communicating to the\r\nanimal something of the aspect of a turtle. In all other respects\r\nits form exactly resembles the harvest-bug; only its body is more\r\nelongated towards the anterior extremity than that of the latter.\r\nWhile the harvest-bug makes us think of a spider, the body of the\r\nAcarus has a greater likeness to an insect's. (Fig. 77.) Yet the\r\nAcarus has eight legs, like a spider, and the harvest-bug six, like\r\nan insect. Attempt, then, to establish your absolute rules!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--The _Acarus domesticus_.]\r\n\r\nLet us continue our observation of this cheese-worm. The well-defined\r\nthorax forms nearly one-third of the fore-part of the body, which is\r\nof a shining whitish-red or reddish-white. The proboscis, shaped like\r\na conical tube, is armed with two projecting mandibles, which, like\r\ntrue pincers, can be brought close together, or moved wide apart,\r\nthrust forward singly or simultaneously. Our animal, which a small\r\nlens makes very distinct, has been more than once confounded with the\r\n_Sarcoptes scabiei_.\r\n\r\nLet us resume. Our cheese-dust, which to all appearance walks alone,\r\nencloses legions of mites; the old you may detect by their eight\r\nfeet, the young by having six. The germs, or eggs, whence they\r\nspring, are found mixed among the excrements of the living, and the\r\ndébris of the dead.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way that a crust of cheese offers us a true, a vivid\r\nimage of the terrestrial crust. So may we learn to compare small\r\nthings with great.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY ANIMAL SPECIES ARE THERE DISTRIBUTED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE\r\nGLOBE?\r\n\r\nIn the present condition of scientific knowledge, no satisfactory\r\nanswer can be given to this important and most interesting question.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that what we may call Geographical Zoology is as yet\r\nin its very infancy. The few works which have been published on the\r\nsubject have been published within the last eighty or ninety years;\r\nand they embrace only the vertebrate animals, notably the mammals,\r\nbirds, and reptiles, or amphibia. We shall attempt to place before\r\nthe reader an outline of the results that have so far been obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all the Vertebrata, we are best acquainted with the mammals. And\r\nyet our zoologists differ very widely in respect to the number of\r\ntheir species, though the calculations have been made at very short\r\nintervals. For instance, in 1829, Minding computed that the globe\r\ncontained 1230 species of mammals. In 1832, Charles Bonaparte reduced\r\nthe total to 1149. Oken estimates it at 1500; and this last figure\r\nwould seem to be the most probable.\r\n\r\nNothing is more curious than the distribution of these 1500 species\r\nof mammals, according to the different regions and climates of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nMan, according to the best-considered data of science, forms a single\r\nfamily, a single genus, a single species. He alone possesses the\r\npower of adapting himself to every climate, and of taking possession\r\nof countries the most widely opposite in character. We find him\r\namong the snows of the North Pole; we find him under the blazing\r\nsun of the Tropics. We find him in the palm-fringed islands of\r\nSouthern Seas, and in the barren burning waste of the inhospitable\r\nSahara. Considered as an animal who feeds and reproduces himself,\r\nhe forms alone the order of _Bimana_; so named in opposition to the\r\n_Quadrumana_, or apes, who make use of their fore-feet as we do of\r\nour two hands. Deprive man of his progressive and transmissible\r\nintellect--of those mysterious powers which we call the mind and\r\nthe soul--and he would become at once the most useless and the most\r\nwretched member of the animal world.\r\n\r\nThe warm regions of the old and new continents are the true home and\r\nhaunt of the apes. They are not sufficiently developed to be able to\r\nfrequent the temperate or frigid zone. In our European menageries the\r\nspecimens nearly all die of consumption. The Quadrumana form about\r\none-fourteenth of the whole number of species of Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Carnivora_, characterised by the development of their canine\r\n      teeth, are spread over the whole globe. They are found in greater\r\n      numbers in the torrid, however, than in the frigid zone. Their\r\n      species compose at least one-third of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Rodentia_, characterised by the development of the incisors,\r\n      are wanting in Polynesia, and are rare in Australia. They are\r\n      found in their maximum number in the torrid zone. Like the\r\n      Carnivora, they form about one-third of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Ruminantia_, remarkable for the development of their\r\n      digestive apparatus, are distributed into 165 species,\r\n      representing something less than one-ninth of the Mammalia.\r\n      Africa, of all the continents, is richest in the Ruminants.\r\n\r\n      The _Marsupialia_, so strangely distinguished by the membranous\r\n      pouch in which they enclose their young, belong to America, and\r\n      especially Australia. At present about 123 species are known, or\r\n      a little more than one-thirteenth of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Edentata_, so named on account of their incomplete\r\n      dentition, inhabit the tropical regions of the Old and New\r\n      World. They are distributed into 32 species, 19 of which belong\r\n      to America. The Edentata, therefore, do not form more than\r\n      one-fiftieth of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Pachydermata_, which owe their name to the thickness of\r\n      their skin or hide, almost exclusively belong to the Old World.\r\n      None are found in Australia. The number of their species is 38,\r\n      of which 5 only belong to Southern and Central America. The\r\n      Pachyderms form, therefore, nearly one-thirty-seventh of the\r\n      Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Cetaceæ_,--which the naturalists of antiquity ranked among\r\n      the fishes, though the females bear their young alive, and\r\n      are furnished with a mammary apparatus,--chiefly frequent the\r\n      Northern waters, but some of their species are found in the South\r\n      Pacific. They represent, it may be assumed, about a one-hundredth\r\n      part of the Mammalia.\r\n\r\n      The _Birds_, by their feather-clad bodies, and by the\r\n      transformation of their two fore-limbs into wings, form the\r\n      best-characterised class in the whole animal kingdom. But\r\n      naturalists can no more agree as to the number of their species\r\n      than as to the number of species composing the Mammalia. Some,\r\n      taking as a foundation the rich ornithological collection in the\r\n      Berlin Museum, allow for 6000 species being distributed over the\r\n      surface of the globe; others, like Lessen, increase the total to\r\n      6266; while Dr Gray, no mean authority, raises it to at least\r\n      8000.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the _Raptores_, or birds of prey (vulture, falcon,\r\neagle), as well as nearly all the _Waders_ (stork, crane, heron), and\r\n_Palmipedes_ (duck, goose, water-hen), are cosmopolitan birds. The\r\nother orders, such as the _Scansores_ (parrot, parroquet, magpie),\r\nthe _Passeres_ (comprising nearly all the singing birds), and the\r\n_Gallinaceæ_ (pheasant, pintado), prefer, as a general rule, the warm\r\ntemperate regions. They are not found in the extreme north, nor in\r\nthe equatorial climes, except in limited numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n_Assumed total, 1600 species._\r\n\r\n    Bimana             form   1     species.\r\n    Quadrumana          \"   105 (?)    \"\r\n    Carnivora           \"   510 (?)    \"\r\n    Rodentia            \"   508 (?)    \"\r\n    Ruminantia          \"   165        \"\r\n    Marsupialia         \"   123        \"\r\n    Edentata            \"   152        \"\r\n    Pachydermata        \"    38        \"\r\n    Cetaceæ             \"    18 (?)    \"\r\n                           ----\r\n                           1600\r\n\r\n[Of course, the foregoing is but an approximative estimate, but it\r\nwill provide the reader with a tolerably accurate notion of the\r\nproportion borne by the different classes of Mammalia.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout 5000 species of birds have been classified. By Cuvier's system\r\nthey are divided into six orders:--\r\n\r\n      1. _Raptores_, or birds of prey.\r\n\r\n      2. _Passerine birds_, now generally called _Insessores_, or\r\n      Perching-birds.\r\n\r\n      3. _Scansores_, or Climbing, frequently called _Zygodactyli_ or\r\n      _Zygodactylous_ birds.\r\n\r\n      4. _Gallinaceæ_, now more frequently known as _Rasores_.\r\n\r\n      5. _Grallatores_, Waders, or Stilt birds.\r\n\r\n      6. _Palmipedes_, or Web-footed birds, now more generally\r\n      recognised as _Natatores_, or Swimmers.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to separate the _Brevipennes_, or short-winged\r\nbirds, from the Grallatores, and erect them into a separate order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Reptiles_, of which the majority possess the faculty of living\r\nupon land and in water,--whence their name of Amphibia,--never pass\r\nbeyond the limits of warm and temperate climates: their blood, which\r\nhas the same temperature as the medium wherein they live--whence\r\ntheir name of \"cold-blooded animals\"--does not circulate where the\r\nmean annual temperature descends below freezing-point. Yet frogs and\r\nsalamanders have been met with in Greenland, and on the banks of the\r\nMackenzie River, in North America, under 67° latitude.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLinnæus was not acquainted with more than 215 species of _Amphibia_,\r\ndivided into four orders:--the Chelonians, or tortoises; the Saurians\r\n(as the lizard and crocodile); the Ophidians (serpents); and the\r\nBatrachians (frogs). In 1789, Lacépède raised the total to 303; in\r\n1820, Merrem estimated it at 677. At present, the number of species\r\nof Reptilia classified and described amounts to 2000, and the four\r\norders into which they are distributed are--\r\n\r\n    1. _Ophidia_, or Serpents.\r\n    2. _Sauria_, or Lizards.\r\n    3. _Loricata_, or Crocodiles.\r\n    4. _Chelonia_, or Tortoises.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sching, there are 7 tortoises, 33 serpents, and 35\r\nlizards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Fishes_ are the least known of those superior animals whose skeleton\r\nand vertebral column are situated in the interior of the body, and\r\nwhich are thence named _Vertebrata_. The richest collections, such\r\nas those of the British Museum, and those of the Museum of Natural\r\nHistory in Paris, which contain about 3000 species, do not represent\r\nprobably more than a fourth of the existing total, including\r\nfresh-water and salt-water fish. How many rivers and streams in\r\nboth hemispheres still remain to be explored! How far we are from\r\na knowledge of the fishes which people the different strata of the\r\ngreat ocean.\r\n\r\nAgassiz divides this great class of vertebrated animals into the\r\nfour orders of _Cycloid, Ctenoid, Placoid, and Ganoid_, according\r\nto the character of their scales. Cuvier, into _Osseous_ fishes\r\n(with true bones), and _Cartilaginous_; subdividing the former into\r\n_Acanthopterygii_ and _Malacopterygii_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the problem we are here considering increases when\r\nwe come to the inferior animals. Who would pretend to determine the\r\nnumber of species of _Mollusca_ which inhabit the earth, the fresh\r\nwaters and the salt? This much is certain, that it cannot be less\r\nthan that of the Vertebrates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the vast aggregate of the _Articulata_, the inquirer finds himself\r\nutterly astray and bewildered. This great division is not divided\r\ninto those which have, and those which have not, articulated members.\r\n\r\nThe first subdivision includes _Insects_, _Arachnida_, _Crustacea_,\r\nand _Myriapoda_; the second, _Annelida_ and _Entozoa_.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists, be it said, rank the _Cirrhopoda_ as intermediate\r\nbetween the two; others place them among the Mollusca. Others, again,\r\ninclude the _Rotifera_ in the second subdivision.\r\n\r\nWe shall in this place confine our remarks to the _Insects_.\r\nAccording to the most distinguished entomologists, the average number\r\nof species at present, described or not described, and preserved in\r\nentomological collections, is between 150,000 and 170,000.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is obviously below the truth. Take only the Coleoptera,\r\nwhich forms but one, though, it is true, the most numerous order of\r\ninsects. Thirty years ago the most complete collections contained\r\nabout 7000 species. In 1850, the museum at Berlin, according to\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, contained nearly 32,000. We would here\r\ncall the reader's attention to the just remarks of the author of\r\nthe \"Natural History of the Coleoptera,\" an entomologist of great\r\nauthority, whom a long residence in America had peculiarly qualified\r\nto pronounce an opinion on the subject before us:--\r\n\r\n\"If we remember,\" says the Count de Castelnau, \"that there are\r\nimmense regions in Asia and the two Americas of which we do not\r\npossess a single coleoptera; if we reflect that the interior of the\r\nvast continent of New Holland is, from this standpoint, entirely\r\nunknown, and that most of the archipelagoes of the great ocean have\r\nnever been entomologically explored, we may conclude, without any\r\nfear of mistake, that the number of existing coleopteras exceeds\r\n_one hundred thousand_. However frightful this number may appear, it\r\nwill seem less so if we examine only the species discovered in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris, within a radius of twelve to fifteen leagues;\r\nand we do not hesitate to say, that in a few years the Parisian fauna\r\nalone will present material for a considerable work, which shall not\r\ntreat of less than 3000 to 4000 species of Coleoptera.\"[84]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the other orders of insects, the Lepidoptera, the\r\nHemiptera, the Hymenoptera, the Neuroptera, the Orthoptera, the\r\nDiptera, the Strepsiptera, comprise, taken altogether, at least the\r\nsame number of species as the Coleoptera alone, we shall gain, for\r\nthe class of insects, a total of 200,000. And we shall certainly\r\nkeep within the truth if we assign the same number of species to\r\nthe Annelida, the Crustacea, the Arachnida, the Myriapoda, and the\r\nMonomorpha, to which, with some modification, we may apply the\r\nremarks already called forth by the Coleoptera.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate. The four classes of _Vertebrate Animals_ include\r\napproximatively:--\r\n\r\n     1,600 species    Mammals.\r\n     5,000    \"       Birds.\r\n     2,000    \"       Reptiles.\r\n    12,000    \"       Fishes.\r\n    ------\r\n    20,600\r\n\r\nIf we add to these 20,600 species of Vertebrate Animals, 200,000\r\nspecies of Articulata, and 22,000 Mollusca (a minimum), we shall have\r\na total of 242,600.\r\n\r\nBut to complete the grand whole of beings \"who grow, and live,\r\nand feel\" (the definition of animals laid down by Linnæus), we\r\nmust add the Intestinal Worms, the Echinodermata, the Acalephæ\r\n(or Sea-nettles), and the Polypes. The history of these singular\r\ncreatures, which apparently form the transition between the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdom, and have thence been designated _Zoophytes_,\r\nleaves much, very much, to be desired before it will be possible to\r\nindicate, even approximatively, the number of their species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, what shall we say of the Infusoria? These microscopic\r\nforms of life seem, by their extreme multiplicity, to animate\r\nall nature. It is in studying these that the inquirer needs to\r\nbe constantly on his guard, that he may not mistake transitory\r\nconditions--or larvæ--for actual species, and it behoves him to\r\nunderstand thoroughly the difficult delimitation of specific\r\ncharacters. It would be far easier to ascertain the exact number of\r\nhuman beings who at present people the terrestrial surface, than to\r\nfix the total of the species of Infusoria now in existence; assuredly\r\nit exceeds 250,000. What an infinite variety of design is here! What\r\na picture it presents of the inexhaustibility of the Creative Mind!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAdd, then,--let us say, in conclusion,--to this last great total the\r\naggregate of the Vertebrates, the Articulates, and the Molluscs, and\r\nfor our grand whole we have a minimum of _half a million_ of ANIMAL\r\nSPECIES! This is the very figure, observe, at which we arrived as\r\nrepresenting the lowest limit of the totality of VEGETABLE SPECIES,\r\nliving and moving, flourishing, and dying, and reproducing, on the\r\nsurface of the globe.\r\n\r\nWe leave the reader to meditate--as meditate he surely must--on the\r\nsublime thoughts, the overpowering ideas of Power and Wisdom which\r\nthese considerations suggest.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS CHLOROPHYLL?\r\n\r\nWe are drawing towards the close of autumn; we shall soon be in sight\r\nof the \"melancholy days of the year;\" when, for a while, the \"voice\r\nof the turtle\" will cease in the leafless groves, and the banks and\r\nbraes will be sadly bare of their floral garniture. As yet, however,\r\nthe trees retain their glorious vesture, though streaked and varied\r\nwith the gorgeous colours of decay; and in the sheltered corners\r\nof the woods, on the sunny southern slope of the grassy hill, and\r\nbeneath the covert of the still fragrant hedgerow, many a blossom\r\nappeals to our souls with its promptings of sweet images and tender\r\nfancies. The arum still raises its clusters of deep-scarlet berries,\r\nand spreads its spotted leaf--\r\n\r\n    \"Armed with keen tortures for the unwary tongue;\"\r\n\r\nthe blue-bells hang their delicate cups among the thick herbage;\r\nand the wild marigold contrasts its yellow splendour with all this\r\ncrimson and azure magnificence. The daisy, too, has not forsaken\r\nus--sweet shield of silver, embossed with gold!--but brightens still\r\nthe pleasant meadow and the sloping bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--\"As yet, the trees retain their glorious\r\nvesture.\"]\r\n\r\n    \"The rose has but a summer reign,\r\n      The daisy never dies;\"\r\n\r\nand though it first makes its appearance in the merry spring-time,\r\nand is truly a child of the early year, it lingers on to become\r\na precious ornament of our scanty autumn wreaths. Sweet flower\r\nof song!--dearer to the poet than even lily or violet!--who does\r\nnot remember, and remembering feel, all the pathos of the dying\r\nexclamation of poor Keats,--\"I feel the daisies already growing over\r\nme!\" They heighten the commonest and cheer the saddest corners of\r\nthe earth, and are ever ready, in their simple loveliness, to awaken\r\nthoughts of grateful tenderness and love--\r\n\r\n    \"So glad am I when in the daisy's presence,\r\n    That I am fain to do it reverence.\"\r\n\r\nTo what do the leaves, now changing their hues so rapidly, and\r\nvarying through all the tints of purple, brown, and yellow,--to what\r\ndo they owe their normal colour, the fresh, vivid, beautiful green?\r\n\r\nTo a substance called _chlorophyll_--(χλωρὸς, green, and\r\nφυλλον, a leaf).\r\n\r\nWell, what _is_ chlorophyll?\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter of plants, which, accompanied by grains of\r\nstarch, floats like very minute seeds in the fluid of their cells. In\r\nsome respects it is analogous to wax; it will not dissolve in water,\r\nbut is easily affected by ether or alcohol.\r\n\r\nChlorophyll is dependent upon the action of light, if not for its\r\nformation, at all events for its development. Keep a plant in a\r\ndark room or cellar, and it will become blanched and sickly; the\r\ncolouring matter dries up, and the white, wan tissue of the leaf is\r\nall that survives. The more a plant is exposed to the light, the\r\ndeeper will be its green. In a shrubbery you may notice that the\r\nbrown leaves of any particular ever-green or bush, if so situated as\r\nto lose the direct action of the sun's rays, will soon change colour.\r\nInstead of their natural brightness of tint, they assume a sickly\r\ngreenish-yellow hue, and are said to be suffering from _chlorosis_.\r\nThe formation of the chlorophyll is obstructed, or takes place too\r\nslowly. Of course, this peculiar condition will frequently arise from\r\nbad soil, or a long continuance of damp weather; but it is also the\r\nresult of a want of light.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that young leaves are always of a lighter green\r\nthan old; simply because the latter have been exposed for a longer\r\ntime to the light. And so the leaf goes on deepening and deepening in\r\ncolour, until the sad days of autumn come, and the green gives way\r\nto yellow and brown and red, owing to the influence of the changing\r\nseason on the chlorophyll of the plant.\r\n\r\nIn reference to this interesting subject,--which deserves to be more\r\nclosely investigated,--we may place before the reader the results of\r\ncertain recent experiments.[85]\r\n\r\nMM. Prillieux, Brongniart, and Roze (_Comptes Rendus_, Jan. 3 and 17)\r\nhave made some important observations on the apparently spontaneous\r\nmovements of the grains of chlorophyll within the leaves of plants.\r\nThese had been observed by Böhm to congregate under the direct action\r\nof the sun; Famitzin, confirmed by Borodine, had also recorded\r\nvery marked movements in the leaves of a moss under the influence\r\nof light. This class of plants offer great facilities for these\r\nobservations, inasmuch as the movements can be observed in them under\r\nthe microscope without dissection. M. Prillieux kept a moss in the\r\ndark for several days, when the cells presented the appearance of a\r\ngreen network, between the meshes of which was a clear transparent\r\nground. All the grains of chlorophyll were applied to the walls which\r\nseparate the cells from one another; there were none on the upper or\r\nunder walls which form the surfaces of the leaf. Under the influence\r\nof light the grains change their position from the lateral to the\r\nsuperficial walls; under favourable circumstances this change takes\r\nplace in about a quarter of an hour. On attaining their new position,\r\nthe grains do not remain absolutely immovable, but continually\r\napproach and separate from one another. If again darkened, they\r\nleave their new position and return to the lateral walls. Artificial\r\nlight produces the same effect as daylight. M. Brongniart further\r\nobserved that this movement of the chlorophyll, under the influence\r\nof light, does not consist in the change of position of isolated\r\ngrains, but of masses of network, each containing a certain number\r\nof grains. In addition, M. E. Roze states that, besides the grains\r\nof chlorophyll which coat the walls of the cell, each cell is lined\r\nwith a transparent mucous plasma formed of very fine threads, the\r\nextremities of which unite together the grains of chlorophyll. This\r\nprotoplasm exhibits, under a high magnifying power, a very slow\r\nmotion, and carries the grains of chlorophyll along with it. M. Roze\r\nbelieves, therefore, that the motion is a plasmic one, the protoplasm\r\nbeing the vital and animating part of the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNATIONS AND PINKS.\r\n\r\nAmong the latest flowers of the autumnal garden are those old\r\nfavourites, the \"July-flowers,\" or _Carnations_, which, because they\r\nwere \"fair and sweet and medicinal,\" Jeremy Taylor preferred to \"the\r\nprettiest tulips, that are good for nothing.\" I remember a time when\r\nthey were among the best-prized ornaments of our parterres, and very\r\ndelicious it was to inhale the balmy breath that rose into the warm\r\nair of an autumn evening from rich masses of carnations and pinks.\r\nThe carnations were also called--_sub consule Planco_--in the merry\r\ndays when I haunted the green lanes of a pretty Devonshire village,\r\ncarnations, and clove July-flowers or gilliflowers; and an ancient\r\nname for the pink was that of sops-in-wine, because they were infused\r\nin the wine-cups of our much-drinking ancestors. So Drayton says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bring hither the pink and purple columbine,\r\n            With gilliflowers;\r\n    Bring coronations, and sops-in-wine,\r\n            Worn of paramours.\"\r\n\r\nThe same poet alludes to them under their more modern appellations:--\r\n\r\n    \"The brave carnation, then, of sweet and sovereign power\r\n    (So of his colour called, although a July flower),\r\n    With the other of his kind, the speckled and the pale;--\r\n    Then the odoriferous pink, that sends forth such a gale\r\n    Of sweetness, yet in scents as various as in sorts.\"\r\n\r\nThe scientific name of this beautiful family of plants, whose\r\nrich dyes are not less conspicuous than their Sabæan odours, is\r\n_Dianthus_, or \"Flower of God.\" They form a genus of the natural\r\norder Carophyllaceæ; the calyx is tubular, and five-toothed; there\r\nare five petals, which at the throat of the corolla are lightened\r\n(as it were) into a linear \"claw.\" The stamens are double the\r\nnumber of the petals; the capsule is of a cylindrical outline, and\r\none-celled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--\"When I haunted the green lanes of a\r\nDevonshire village.\"]\r\n\r\nI am quite prepared to agree with a sympathetic writer on flowers\r\nthat, during summer, and far into the autumn months, the greatest\r\nbeauty of our gardens is the varied tribe of Carnations, while their\r\nexquisite, subtle, yet potent aroma is not to be excelled, I think,\r\nor, at all events, is not far surpassed, in strength and sweetness,\r\nby the much-lauded rose. A carnation seems, to my humble taste, the\r\nvery embodiment, as it were, of the favourite qualities so insisted\r\nupon by Mr Matthew Arnold, \"sweetness and light.\" And even in winter,\r\nwhen its radiant petals have disappeared, there is something graceful\r\nto the eye in the long slender leaves of the pink, covered with their\r\nsea-green powdery bloom.\r\n\r\nThe two species commonly grown in gardens are, the garden pink\r\n(_Dianthus hortensis_) and the carnation proper (_Dianthus\r\ncaryophyllus_); both of which are generally referred to one original,\r\nthe castle-pink, July-flower, or clove-gilliflower. The carnation, as\r\na garden flower, was originally brought into England from Germany,\r\nwhere it has always been a favourite object of cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere are several hundred varieties of it, which are arranged\r\ninto three principal divisions: _flakes_, which are diversified\r\nby broad stripes of two colours only; _bizarres_, which are of\r\nseveral colours, and very irregularly streaked; and _picotees_ (from\r\n_piquetté_, spotted), whose flowers are besprinkled with different\r\ncolours, and their petals fringed or serrated.\r\n\r\nIn England, the _native_ species of pink are five in number, but\r\nthey are mostly rare, or, when abundant, are found in very limited\r\nhabitats.\r\n\r\nThe commonest kind is the little _Deptford Pink_ (_Dianthus\r\nArmeria_), which sometimes grows in thick clusters among the meadow\r\ngrass. In shape, its blossom resembles that of the garden pink; in\r\nsize, it is about equal to that of the sweet william; and its flowers\r\ngrow in a very similar manner. It is a scentless pink, however, with\r\nserrated or notched petals, and its rose-coloured petals curiously\r\nbesprinkled with tiny spots of white.\r\n\r\nA very pretty species is the _Maiden Pink_ (_Dianthus deltoides_),\r\nwhich some botanists think to have been the original of our garden\r\nfavourite; and a kind deserving notice for its large and fragrant\r\nflowers is the _Dianthus superbus_.\r\n\r\nThe maiden pink, I should add, has delicate rose-coloured blossoms,\r\ndaintily touched with silver, and a white eye encircled by a deep\r\npurple ring. It is not unworthy of its fanciful and highly suggestive\r\nname.\r\n\r\nA rare British variety is the _Clustered Pink_, or _Childing Pink_\r\n(_Dianthus prolifer_), which produces its flowers in plentiful\r\nclusters, but is only allowed a season's sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe _India_ or _China Pink_ (_Dianthus chinensis_) is a native of\r\nEastern Asia, but has now become a frequent denizen in our English\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\nOne wild species, the _Mountain Pink_ (_Dianthus cœsius_), it has\r\nnever been my fortune to gather in its native home. It is described\r\nas a large handsome flower, and it loves to breathe the \"difficult\r\nair\" of the lofty mountain-top. \"Never,\" we are told, \"is it found\r\nin plain or valley; but it is one of those blossoms whose beauty\r\ngladdens the mountaineer, or bids the traveller wonder that so lovely\r\na flower should be blushing on the lone summit, scarcely accessible\r\nto his footstep; or cheering a rock, where only the yellow lichen,\r\nor the verdant or gray moss, reminds him of vegetation. Such a\r\nsight might bid one think of the old motto, which accompanied a\r\nwild flower, 'I trust only in Heaven.' How beautiful is it in its\r\nloneliness! Scarce an eye meets it but that of the towering bird, as\r\nhe dashes through the air above it, yet is it as full of lustre as\r\nthe flowers we daily see and admire. Surely it should arrest the eye\r\nand the thoughts of the traveller as certainly as would a monument of\r\nhuman skill on such a spot. Like a lone ruin, it is a page of story,\r\ntelling not only of the past, but the present, and reminding us of a\r\nBeing who has reared it there, where it stands a memento of power and\r\ngoodness.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,\r\n      Thanks to its tenderness, its joys and fears,\r\n    To me the meanest flower that blows can give\r\n      Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.\"\r\n\r\n    --WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\nOf greater interest, however, because a native species, and more\r\neasily attained, is the _Castle Pink_, to which brief reference has\r\nalready been made. Its perfume is like that of precious spices, and\r\nafter a shower of rain, the air, for some distance, is actually\r\ninterpenetrated with it. As its name indicates, it loves to grow upon\r\nthe shattered walls of\r\n\r\n    \"Chiefless castles breathing stern farewells;\"\r\n\r\nand it may be found, unless swept away by barbarous \"improvements,\"\r\nadorning the gray old masonry of Sandown Castle, and on ruins in the\r\nneighbourhood of Norwich. On the walls of Rochester's stately keep\r\nit grows at a height which defies the spoiler's hand; and on the\r\ntime-worn ruins of an ancient minster, it shines, in the summer-noon,\r\n\"with a flush of flowers.\" It blossoms in July, and there are not,\r\nit is said, more than half-a-dozen spots in England where it may be\r\nfound wild.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--\"On the time-worn ruins of an ancient\r\nminster.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this dainty and beautiful tribe belongs that common but handsome\r\nand most fragrant flower, the _Bearded Pink_ or _Sweet William_\r\n(_Dianthus barbatus_),--a native of central Europe and southern\r\nFrance, with long lanceolate leaves, bearded petals, ornamental\r\nbracts, and dense clusters or tufts of crimson or rose-coloured\r\nblossoms. It has long been a favourite with the cottager, for it is\r\nso hardy that it will grow in any soil, and will flourish even in\r\nthe odd corner known as the \"children's garden.\" Its popular name,\r\n\"long, long ago,\" was \"London tuftes;\" and it owes its specific\r\nappellation of _barbatus_, or \"bearded,\" to the nature of its calyx.\r\nThat quaintest of quaint old botanists, delightful Gerarde, lavishes\r\nencomiums upon its beauty, and pronounces it meet \"to deck up the\r\nbosoms of the beautiful, and garlands and crowns for pleasure.\" I\r\nsuspect that now-a-days it seldom figures in a posy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the same order as the Dianthi--that is, to the\r\n_Caryophyllaceæ_--belong many wild flowers of lowly growth but\r\nabounding interest; as, for example, the corn-cockle, whose\r\nlilac-coloured petals, soaring conspicuously among the tall\r\nwaving corn, have procured for it the right royal appellation of\r\n_Agrostemma_, or \"the crown of the field.\" So, too, the numerous\r\nspecies of campion and catchfly (_Silene_), with their singular\r\nexpanded calices; and those handsome flowers, the white and rosy\r\nlychnises, which love to air their charms by the side of running\r\nwaters. The cottony down upon these plants was wont to be much used\r\nfor the wicks of lamps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, too, the whole tribe of chickweeds are included in the\r\nCaryophyllaceæ. They are spring flowers, with pearly white blossoms,\r\nfive-petalled, like a five-rayed star, and long slender drooping\r\nleaves. Their resemblance to a star has suggested their scientific\r\nname, _Stellaria_; and they are truly the \"stars of the earth,\"\r\nglistering among the thick herbage with a modest beauty. The\r\n_Stellaria media_ supplies our song-birds with an abundant and a\r\nwholesome provision.\r\n\r\nA handsome wild plant of this order is the Soapwort (_Saponaria\r\nofficinalis_). It is common in Kent, and some of the neighbouring\r\nshires, but in many parts of England is never seen. Its full cluster\r\nof rose-hued blossoms is rather larger, and more loosely set\r\ntogether, than those of the sweet william; which, however, it much\r\nresembles in its leaves, these being opposite to each other, and\r\nnearly sheathing or surrounding the stalk at their bases.\r\n\r\n\"The juice of the soapwort,\" says Miss Pratt, \"is one of those\r\nvegetable substances which, by making a lather with water, will\r\ncleanse linen, and remove grease as effectually as soap. It grows\r\nmore generally in the neighbourhood of villages than in any other\r\nsituation, as if providence had placed it there especially for\r\nthe service of the cottager; yet it is very little used, either\r\nfrom ignorance of its properties, or because it would require\r\nsome cultivation to render it sufficiently plentiful for household\r\npurposes. It needs the addition of ashes to make it a good soap\r\nfor washing linen; but it is of much service to the shepherds on\r\nthe Alps, who wash their flocks, previously to shearing them, with\r\nsoapsuds made by boiling this plant in water. The large fruit of the\r\nhorse-chestnut has similar cleansing properties, and may be used by\r\ncutting it into small pieces, or scraping it into water. It has even\r\nbeen suggested that if the nuts were reduced to powder, and made\r\ninto balls, with some unctuous substance, they would answer all the\r\npurposes of our manufactured soap; and yet numbers of poor people see\r\nthese nuts lying decaying in their neighbourhood, and have no idea of\r\nmaking them of any service.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Continent, however, the peasantry are wiser, and not\r\nonly provide themselves with chestnuts for soap, but gather the\r\nbeech-leaves to stuff their mattresses.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Caryophyllaceæ, we may add that some of the\r\nplants of this order have poisonous qualities, which are due to\r\nthe principle called _saponine_ existing in many of the species of\r\nSaponaria, Silene, Lychnis, and Dianthus.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lindley, the order includes no less than 53 genera, and\r\n1055 species. They inhabit chiefly temperate and cold regions, and\r\nare ranked in three sub-orders,--Alsineæ, Sileneæ, and Mollugineæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EGLANTINE AND THE CONVOLVULUS.\r\n\r\nWhat plant do our poets mean by the eglantine? What by the woodbine?\r\nAre they one and the same, or are they different?\r\n\r\nWe cannot answer those questions until we have referred to three or\r\nfour passages in which they are introduced. And, first, let us take\r\nan example from Spenser:--\r\n\r\n        \"And over him, art striving to compare\r\n        With nature, did an arbour green dispread,\r\n        Framèd of wanton ivy, flowering fair,\r\n        Through which the fragrant eglantine did spread\r\n        His pricking arms, entrailed with roses red,\r\n        Which dainty odours round about them threw,\r\n        And all within with flowers was garnishèd,\r\n        That when wild Zephyrus amongst them blew,\r\n    Did breathe out bounteous smells, and painted colours shew.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now from Milton:--\r\n\r\n    \"Through the sweetbriar, or the vine,\r\n    Or the twisted eglantine.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from Sir Walter Scott:--\r\n\r\n                          \"On the hill\r\n    Let the white heath-bell flourish still,\r\n    Cherish the tulip, prune the vine,\r\n    But freely let the woodbine twine,\r\n    And leave untrimmed the eglantine.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Burns:--\r\n\r\n    \"The woodbine I will pu' when the evening star is near,\r\n    And the diamond draps of dew shall be her een sae clear.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Michael Drayton:--\r\n\r\n    \"The azured harebell next with them they neatly mixt:\r\n    T' allay whose luscious smell they woodbine placed betwixt ...\r\n    The columbine amongst they sparingly do set,\r\n    And now and then among, of eglantine a spray.\"\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, from Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n    \"And leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,\r\n    Out-sweetened not thy breath.\"\r\n\r\nThere is evidently some confusion here, and the eglantine of one poet\r\nis not the eglantine of another. Sir Walter Scott, we take it, is\r\nthinking of the wild clematis or virgin's bower, when he wishes the\r\neglantine to remain untrimmed. And Milton undoubtedly refers to the\r\nhoneysuckle, which, twisting round the framework of a cottage-porch,\r\ntempts the neighbouring bees to rifle its calyxes of their honeyed\r\nsweets. But the _true_ eglantine of our earlier poets seems to have\r\nbeen the prickly sweetbriar, formerly called _Rosa eglantina_; now\r\nknown as _Rosa rubiginosa_. No plant is of greater value for a garden\r\nhedge, owing to the delicious fragrance exhaled not only by its\r\nflowers but by its leaves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the \"lush woodbine,\" which so often finds\r\nhonourable mention in our poets, is none other than the honeysuckle,\r\nthe \"twisted eglantine\" of Milton. Its botanical name is\r\n_Caprifolium_.\r\n\r\nThe eglantine and the woodbine, therefore, though occasionally\r\nconfounded by careless writers, are two entirely distinct plants; the\r\nformer being the sweetbriar of modern gardens, and the latter the\r\nhoneysuckle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--\"Our leafy hedgerows.\"]\r\n\r\nIt has been justly said by a writer (whom we have already quoted),\r\nthat of all the flowers which, towards the end of summer and the\r\nbeginning of autumn, adorn our pastoral scenery, \"filling the air\r\nwith fragrance, and the earth with beauty,\" none are more generally\r\nattractive than the wild climbing plants of our leafy hedgerows.\r\nBy interlacing their delicate boughs, covered with foliage and\r\nflowers,--or with berries bright and sparkling,--or, as in the wild\r\nclematis, crowned with the lightest, feathery seeds,--they wind\r\nabout the trees and bushes in festoons and wreaths of the utmost\r\nelegance,--and contribute in no slight degree to the aspect of\r\nrichness and beauty which the landscape exhibits at this time of the\r\nyear. As their stems are so slender and delicate that they would be\r\ncrushed by the burthen of their flowery clusters and numerous leaves,\r\nor rent and uprooted by the wind, unless they found support from\r\nother plants, we see them hanging by their tendrils, or by their\r\npliant arms, about the trunks of aged trees,--the ancestral elms,\r\nor \"those green-robed senators of mighty woods, tall oaks,\"--like a\r\nfrail maiden to the sturdy arm of some strong-shouldered brother, or,\r\nit may be, of some one \"nearer and dearer still.\"\r\n\r\nIn reference to those climbing plants, one curious circumstance\r\ndeserves to be noted.\r\n\r\nSome of them follow the sun's apparent course, that is, from east to\r\nwest,--and always twine around the stem which supports them in the\r\ndirection of left to right. Such is the case with the common black\r\nbriony, so common in our woods and groves.\r\n\r\nOthers invariably twine _contrary_ to the sun, or from right to left;\r\nas is the case with the convolvulus, or large white bindweed.\r\n\r\nThis singular tendency, be it observed, is always constant in each\r\nindividual of the species, and if you endeavour to train one of these\r\nplants in a different direction, you will infallibly kill it.\r\n\r\nThe convolvulus will not grow from left to right, and the black\r\nbriony will not grow from right to left. _Crede experto._\r\n\r\nThe convolvulus, or white bindweed (_Convolvulus sepium_, or\r\n_Calystegia sepium_), is one of the most elegant, though one of\r\nthe commonest climbing plants which festoon our willows, or creep\r\nover our grassy banks, or wind in and about our hedges. Its large\r\nwhite bells, which the country people unpoetically call \"old men's\r\nnightcaps,\" are remarkable for their purity of hue and exquisite\r\nbeauty of outline; and the leaves, which are heart-shaped, equally\r\nclaim our admiration. Like the pink field-convolvulus (_Convolvulus\r\narvensis_), or the rosy-hued seaside bindweed (_Calystegia\r\nsoldanella_), it is very tenacious of life, and if it once secures\r\na footing, is eradicated with difficulty. Hence it is dearer to the\r\npoet and artist than to the farmer and gardener, each of whom pursues\r\nit with a determined hostility.\r\n\r\nThe Convolvulaceæ form a distinct family or order, containing\r\nforty-five genera, and upwards of seven hundred species. They are\r\nfound in temperate and tropical countries; and include the dodder,\r\nsweet potato, scammony, spomœa, and the jalap plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAMORPHOSIS.--A PHYSICO-PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATION.[86]\r\n\r\nIf we are to understand by the term _metamorphosis_ simply \"a\r\nchange,\" it is evident that everybody undergoes metamorphosis, is\r\nchanged or transformed; nothing _is_, all _becomes_.\r\n\r\nThe water which flows on for ever, but never twice washes the same\r\npebbly bed, will afford us an apt image of this perpetual \"to become.\"\r\n\r\nBut even the said pebbly bed, like the hardest rock, like the\r\nseemingly everlasting granite, must and does change. The compact,\r\nchrystalline, azoic rock, without a trace of life in its dense mass,\r\nwould eventually decompose if constantly assailed and affected by\r\nthe moving waves of that gaseous ocean whose bed is formed by the\r\nterrestrial crust. If the rock is found covered by more or less\r\nstratified layers, its presence in the bosom of the earth will\r\nattest to passing generations the primordial incandescence of our\r\nplanet at some epoch when life as yet was _not_,--when the liquid\r\nelement, hurled far away into space under the form of vapour,\r\nexhibited the aspect of a \"bearded meteor,\" or a comet, with blazing\r\nnucleus and incandescent tail. Many the changes which since that\r\ndistant epoch have taken place upon the earth, and many more must\r\noccur before our planet ceases to contribute its strain to the grand\r\nharmony of the spheres. Our world will _end_ as surely as it once\r\nhad a beginning: its duration, though it be computed by hundreds of\r\nthousands of years, is nothing, will be nothing, compared with that\r\nof the revolution of yonder sun, circling, with its wondrous train of\r\nplanets, around some mysterious centre as yet unknown. And in this\r\nperiod, hitherto incalculable, what chances of perturbation will\r\nnecessarily arise?\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the centre around which oscillates, on the one\r\npart, the moon while drawing near and receding from the earth; on the\r\nother, the earth while drawing near and receding from the sun: let\r\nus suppose that these centres oscillate in the same manner around\r\nother centres as yet undetermined,--and this hypothesis is very\r\nrational, since it is based on the principle that everything moves\r\nor changes,--it may happen that in these periodical oscillations,\r\none or more of the circulating masses will eventually fall into\r\ntheir focus of attraction, or will start so widely astray that the\r\nwheelwork of our world, the various parts of our planetary system,\r\nwill separate,--not to be annihilated, for nothing in the universe\r\ncan be _annihilated_,--but to be metamorphosed, and group themselves\r\nelsewhere in a different order.[87]\r\n\r\nIt is thus that in chemistry, which I would call the _astronomy of\r\natoms_, it is shown that bodies are only so far decomposed as to\r\nadmit of their recombination in new forms; the end of one is the\r\nbeginning of another.\r\n\r\nNow, that which is true of the systems of the elementary bodies\r\ncomposing terrestrial matter, is, in all probability, true also--why\r\nshould it not be?--of the systems of the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\nDifferences of magnitude, of space, and of time, which overwhelm\r\nour feeble imaginations, vanish before the unity of plan of the\r\nCreator's thought. A crystalline molecule, which will not affect\r\nthe finest balance, is a world, with an equator and poles of its\r\nown, and its central atom round which atomic satellites gravitate.\r\nWhether these atoms are infinitely small or infinitely great,\r\nwhether the time of their revolutions is measured by thousandths\r\nof a second or by myriads of years, is of little importance so far\r\nas their gravitation (_ponderation_, or _poising_) is concerned.\r\nFor this ponderation is absolutely identical, whether we call it\r\n_affinity_,--when speaking of the atomic movements of chemically\r\ndecomposable matter; or _gravitation_ or _attraction_, when referring\r\nto those atoms of the great whole which we call stars, and whose\r\nmetamorphic scale is far beyond the range of beings planted on the\r\nsurface of one of the stellar atoms. However profound may be the\r\nresearches of our astronomers, they will never attain to a knowledge\r\nof the metamorphoses of worlds. The spectacle of celestial spheres\r\nrising anew from their ashes, like \"the Arabian bird\" of fable, will\r\nbe as impossible for them as the knowledge of the decompositions and\r\nrecompositions of our material bodies would be for chemists, planted\r\non the surface of an atom of carbon. How, from such a standpoint,\r\ncould they contemplate the manifold forms of matter, and embrace at\r\na glance all its changes?... Well, we are relatively as powerless as\r\nthese imaginary denizens of an atom of matter, rooted as we are to\r\nthe crust of a planet,--a molecule suspended in the eternal ocean.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we now say of the forms and movements of _living matter_?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, that they are infinitely more varied and more\r\nchangeful than those of inanimate nature. Next, that the difference\r\nbetween their metamorphoses is very wide. The eye can follow the\r\ntransformations of a rock exposed to the decomposing action of the\r\nagents which surround us on every side. This action is calculable,\r\nand the elements which it has dissociated may be determined and\r\nweighed. The effects of the force, called either affinity or\r\nattraction, which maintains these elements united, are not beyond the\r\nrange of our observation; tables of affinity, and of atomic weights,\r\nhave been constructed, which enable the chemist to dominate over\r\nmatter, just as the astronomer embraces the stars, the atoms of the\r\nworld, by the law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner is matter interpenetrated by that mysterious force\r\nwhich we call life, than our most potent means of investigation\r\nsuddenly cease to be efficient. Undoubtedly, you may analyse the\r\nseed before you sow it, and thus may ascertain that it consists\r\nof _carbon_, _hydrogen_, _oxygen_, and _azote_. But with the same\r\nelements attempt to recompose your seed, using exactly the same\r\nproportions as those you discovered in it; and if you think that\r\nyour synthesis has been successful, ensure that your grain, once\r\nconfided to the earth, shall become a focus of divers movements,\r\ngiving birth below to the ramifications of the root, terminated by\r\nthe spongioles,--above, to the ramifications of the stem, garnished\r\nwith leaves, flowers, and fruits; finally, ensure that this aggregate\r\nof organs, multiplying millions of times the weight and volume of the\r\nseed, shall always and exactly reproduce the same type or the same\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIf, with your apparatus,--if, with the means at the disposal of\r\nhumanity,--you should succeed in achieving all these marvels of\r\nnature; then perhaps you might settle the great problem of what life\r\nis,--whether an independent force, or a simple modification of an\r\nuniversal force, of which heat, light, electricity, and magnetism,\r\nwill be but different modes of manifestation.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even in such a case, you must not boast too loudly of your\r\npower; for you will find it necessary to turn and return the term you\r\nhave arrived at, in every direction; nor will it furnish you with the\r\nrelation or the cause of the formidable progression whose _alpha_ and\r\n_omega_, whose beginning and end, escape us so absolutely.\r\n\r\nWhence, in all its interminable metamorphoses, whence comes life?\r\nWhither goes it? Were our world to perish, its ruins would not\r\ncease, in their apparently disordered movements, to obey the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation: they would so group themselves as to form\r\nother worlds, resembling the system of which they were anteriorly\r\nthe framework. But this force in no wise tells you why, when, and\r\nhow life will make its appearance on these spheroids of revolution,\r\nwhich, in their state of ponderation, are attracted in the direct\r\nratio of their masses and in the inverse ratio of the square of their\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is not all. Man justly plumes himself on having arrived, by a\r\nprocess of experiment, at the following irrefragable axiom: that \"the\r\nmatter which serves for the movements of life renews itself, while\r\nthe mould or form remains.\" You may even affirm, without appearing\r\ntoo adventurous, that the innumerable whirling globules which enter\r\ninto the composition of the human blood are so many microscopical\r\nindividuals, each with its own proper life,--infinitesimal forms\r\nwhich are born, and move to and fro, and disappear, and are renewed,\r\nwithout the individual--whose aggregate they perform--having any\r\nconsciousness of all this activity.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the collective integral being which we call humanity,\r\nlives and is developed through the removal of the individuals\r\ncomposing it,--ephemeral creatures, each of whom thinks himself a god!\r\n\r\nMust we stop there? That would be to declare humanity the last\r\nterm of a progression whose commencement and end, according to our\r\nown acknowledgment, completely escape us: it would be at once a\r\ncontradiction and a flagrant violation of the great law of infinite\r\ncontinuity which reigns everywhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo suppose that beyond humanity there is only nothingness, would be\r\nto enunciate an hypothesis as puerile as that which pretended the\r\nearth was not only the centre of our system, but the sole inhabited\r\nor inhabitable point in the immensity of space, and that the stars\r\nof the firmament were created for the service and pleasure of\r\nmortals. Suppose that this absurd belief were true; of what use, I\r\nask you, would be all our agitations, all our flutterings, all our\r\nconceptions, all our conquests, all our glories, all our memories,\r\nwhen the end of the world would sweep away and annihilate our race?\r\nIt was well worth the trouble, truly, of being born, of living, and\r\nof suffering, to terminate, after all, in so inglorious a fashion!...\r\nAdhere to your hypothesis, materialist, if you have the courage;\r\nsurely, no man of sense can accept it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us now resume the thread of our meditations.\r\n\r\nThe end of our system has come at last: the sun, the planets, and\r\ntheir satellites form but one chaotic igneous mass,--a brilliant\r\nfugitive luminary, new-born to the inhabitants of worlds which have\r\nescaped intact.\r\n\r\nThe dust of our extinguished world will not be scattered hap-hazard;\r\nthe molecules of matter, indissolubly linked together by universal\r\ngravitation, will so arrange themselves as to constitute a new, and\r\nperhaps a more perfect world. But in the constitution of this new\r\nworld, balanced like the old, our human bones, our ashes united\r\nwith those of our ancestors, may have, as far as they are matter,\r\ntheir due share. As for the Thought which makes the true power of\r\nhumanity, which gives to man all his value,--Thought, perfectible and\r\ntransmissible,--it will contribute nothing, because it is absolutely\r\nimponderable and impassible. Will it then be lost for ever?\r\n\r\nIf the world is to last for ever, you may justly regard as immortal\r\nthe indefinite transmission of Thought, and the perpetuity of the\r\nmemory of certain great men. But will all this avail, if the world\r\nmust perish?\r\n\r\nThe world will never end, you say; it is eternal.\r\n\r\nBut how do you know this? If it has had a beginning, as geology and\r\nastronomy prove,[90] it will also have an end. This end, however,\r\nwill not be an annihilation; it will simply be, as we have already\r\npointed out, a transformation of matter. As for the problems, whether\r\nnature itself was created, and whether it is eternal, let us leave\r\nthem to the discussion of heated theoricians, who are too blind to\r\nperceive that some questions it is wisest neither to affirm nor deny,\r\nbut _to know how to ignore_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe error, then, which we have been considering, destroys itself\r\nthrough its consequences. Let us admit, in effect, that our\r\nworld--such as it is, just as it is--will last for ever. In that case\r\nwhat becomes of the power and travail of humanity? All they have\r\naccomplished are some slight changes of the terrestrial crust, barely\r\nsufficient, here and there, to modify the influences of climate.\r\nA limited number of men labour, it is true, for the progress and\r\nfull development of transmissible thought. But even supposing that,\r\nin the course of centuries, humanity succeeds in comprehending, it\r\ncan only _grow_ through the development of the faculties of all its\r\nmembers, and the due balance of all the social forces by means of\r\nliberty. Supposing that reason, united to science and conscience,\r\nshould finally combine in one family the various tribes and peoples\r\nscattered over the earth's broad surface; do you indulge yourself\r\nin the hope of crossing the limits of the human organization, and\r\nestablishing the royalty of man \"through the interpretation and\r\nimitation of Nature?\"\r\n\r\nDo you cherish the idea of penetrating, through the perfect union of\r\nall your intellectual forces, the mysteries of creation?\r\n\r\nNo; you would never dare to form such a hope, to nourish such an\r\nidea, at least unless you felt that the earth (which you must\r\nfirst demonstrate) comprehends in itself the whole universe, that\r\nthe humanity swarming on its surface is eternal, that every other\r\ncreature is absolutely subordinate to it: in a word, that Man is all!\r\n\r\nBut we know how limited is human power. We are not masters even\r\nof the mechanism of the body; the movements of organic life are\r\nindependent of our will; we can neither command the stomach, the\r\nlungs, nor the heart: that marvellous process of absorption and\r\nelimination, that perpetual movement hither or thither which\r\nconstitutes the essence of the assimilative function, goes on in\r\nus--as in all living beings, animal or vegetable--completely outside\r\nour sphere of activity. Then, without quitting our planet, how\r\nnumerous are the movements which still escape the human will!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is quite different when we lift up our eyes to examine the face of\r\nheaven. We have no grasp whatever of the incommensurable spiraloids\r\nof innumerable worlds to which our own belongs; we have no means\r\nof communicating with the inhabitants of other planets; we cannot\r\nestablish any interchange of thought with the _men_ (if there be\r\nany) of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,--who form, perhaps,\r\nlike the _men_ of the earth, the most elevated circle of material\r\nlife, varying under an infinity of forms upon each of their floating\r\ndomiciles.... I see you smiling, reader, because you do not believe\r\nthat these _other earths_--satellites of the sun, like our own--are\r\ninhabited by beings analagous to our human race. You are at liberty\r\nnot to believe it. But then, to be in agreement with yourselves,\r\nyou ought to declare in favour of the Science of the Past, though\r\ndemonstrated to be false, against the Science of the Present. Will\r\nyou do so? Certainly not. But then, of two things, one: either you\r\nwill be obliged to make the earth an unique exception, a kind of\r\nmonstrosity in the midst of the other mechanism of the universe,\r\nwhich will be to throw yourself back upon the erroneous science\r\nof the ancients; or you must perforce admit that the earth is not\r\nspecially privileged, and that the other planets, its companions,\r\nhave also their human inhabitants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIs this all? Alas, all this is nothing! The other worlds whose suns\r\nappear to us under the form of scintillating points or stars, will,\r\nundoubtedly, in like manner, possess their systems of planets and\r\nsatellites. Why should they divaricate from the general plan of the\r\nuniverse? Now, multiply the number of the stars--who has counted\r\nthem?--with the probable number of their planets, and you will gain,\r\nif this be permitted you, the number of _humanities_ who people\r\nyonder star-sown space. And it is not only with _these_ we must be\r\nable to correspond, but with the humanities of all the nebulæ of\r\nall the firmaments--for remember our starry heaven itself is but\r\na nebula--that we must establish an interchange of ideas, if you\r\nwould have your power, and civilisation, and intellectual royalty,\r\nsomething more than a mere optical illusion of your pride.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYou do not cease to proclaim as an axiom that \"there are no abrupt\r\nintervals in Nature;\" that Nature never ventures upon sudden leaps\r\nor bounds (\"in natura non datur saltus\"), and yet you would make\r\nan exception for the world of thought--a world which no more lies\r\noutside the laws of nature than does the physical world. The former\r\nought even to secure our preference; it is there only that we are\r\nfree, that we can become true creators, by creating for ourselves\r\nour own happiness; that we can grow great before our own eyes, by\r\nfollowing, not the tyrannous will of the _brute_, but the tender\r\nvoice of the _angel_; by listening to conscience--that pure and\r\ninfallible counsellor--conscience, the foundation of all justice, the\r\nlatent force of generations passing away and coming, the universal\r\ngravitation of our species as of all the ultra-terrestrial humanities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut how can the humanities, with which we suppose the universe to be\r\npeopled,--how can they communicate with one another?\r\n\r\nThe law of attraction comprehends not only the celestial bodies,\r\nbut also their intervals, the intersidereal spaces. Do these spaces\r\npresent a void to the thinking beings who probably people the stars?\r\n\r\nEverything, force and matter, testifies to an entire unity of plan\r\nor thought, and the mind which is powerful enough to rise above all\r\nthe attractions and influences of the body, the mind which, by its\r\ncontinuous labour, alone renders life and man of any importance, the\r\nmind once detached from the animal nature which it drags behind it\r\nlike a prisoner to the chariot of his conqueror, shall it be inferior\r\nto inert matter? shall it be less than a ship without its compass?\r\nContinuous here, shall that continuity be elsewhere broken up? Surely\r\nthis is impossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut how are we to recognise this continuity of essence in a spirit\r\nwhich, like man's, appears unavoidably fixed, like a parasite, to the\r\nsurface of a planet?\r\n\r\nHere lies the whole difficulty of the question; a question all the\r\nmore perplexing because, in the search after scientific truth,\r\nthe mind walks surely and steadily, except when resting upon the\r\nsenses,--which are the backbone, so to speak, of the experimental\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nAnswers, indeed, are not wanting, for each religion has its own.\r\nEvery creed attempts to solve the problem. But then, faith is\r\nrequired to accept the answer or solution, and alas! faith is not\r\nimplanted in every soul. It is useless, therefore, to wish that it\r\nmight be the gift of those who, to the authority of tradition and\r\nlong-established dogmas, prefer the liberty of discussion and the\r\naxioms of science. Are our bigots actually aware of what they do when\r\nthey seek to compel into their circle of belief those minds which\r\ntend to escape from it at a tangent? We assert that in so doing they\r\nare guilty of an act of iniquity, of a veritable blasphemy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome explanation is necessary here. You believe, we hope, in the\r\nmajesty, power, wisdom, and mercy of God, in the revelations He has\r\nvouchsafed to man, in the immortality of the soul. These are great\r\nproblems, however; the greatest problems a mortal can venture to\r\ndiscuss. Already I see the bigot frowning; he professes to be shocked\r\nby the word \"problem,\" he would fain substitute for it that of\r\n\"certainty\" or \"truth.\" Well, through faith we accept them as truths;\r\nbut, metaphysically speaking, they may be regarded as problems which\r\nthe All-wise has submitted to man's earnest consideration. In fact,\r\nthe God in whom you and we believe, in whom you and we put all\r\nour trust, has surrounded them with something of uncertainty, has\r\ninvested them with so much of doubtfulness as may test our faith.\r\n\r\nYes, in doing so, He has had a purpose to fulfil. Let us think of a\r\ngeometrician--and an ancient writer said that God, by creating the\r\nworld, created geometry--for the sake of exercising the minds of his\r\npupils, his children, giving them a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nIf at the same time, he placed before them the solution, he would\r\nassuredly fail in his object. No means would remain of distinguishing\r\nthe capable from the incapable, the studious from the indifferent,\r\nthe idler from the worker, if they all found the question answered\r\nbeforehand!\r\n\r\nTrue, if the problem is too difficult, if the solution lies beyond\r\nthe faculties of those whom he wishes to test and put to the proof,\r\nthe master will not fail to furnish them with all the elements\r\nnecessary for their guidance, whether they consider it from without,\r\nor whether they consider it with the help of their own inner\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nBut science and conscience stand in need of an equally difficult\r\ntask; the first, that it may learn to observe clearly, the latter\r\nthat it may learn to act purely. And it is here, above all, that the\r\ntwo-fold nature of man becomes a perplexity and a stumbling-block. On\r\nthe one hand, man creates theories, in order to disembarrass himself\r\nof the science which calls for the exercise of powerful and laborious\r\nobservation; on the other, he creates dogmas, which he hopes may lull\r\nto sleep that ever active, ever restless conscience, which demands\r\nfertile and beneficial actions, and rejects barren or deceitful\r\nphrases.\r\n\r\nIt is true that to many minds the discussion of the questions at\r\nwhich we have hinted seems a sorry work, because the time given\r\nfor their discussion is necessarily so limited. What is life? they\r\nsay. What can be effected in so short an interval? What can man\r\nhope to accomplish in the few short years that intervene between\r\nmanhood, when the mind is mature, and old age, when the intellect\r\ngrows enfeebled? These are the men who echo the old poet's mournful\r\ncry:--[91]\r\n\r\n    \"A good that never satisfies the mind,\r\n    A beauty fading like the April flowers,\r\n    A sweet with floods of gall that runs combined,\r\n    A pleasure passing ere in thought made ours,\r\n    An honour that more fickle is than wind,\r\n    A glory at opinion's frown that lowers,\r\n    A treasury which bankrupt Time devours,\r\n    A knowledge than grave ignorance more blind,\r\n    A vain delight our equals to command,\r\n    A style of greatness in effect a dream,\r\n    A swelling thought of holding sea and land,\r\n    A servile lot, decked with a pompous name;\r\n    Are the strange ends we toil for here below,\r\n    Till wisest death make us our urns know.\"\r\n\r\nBut the poet, while taking this despondent view of life, forgets--not\r\nonly that it is an opportunity, but--that it is the first stage of an\r\neternal existence, and that the progress begun now shall be continued\r\nhereafter, when the mind, freed from its material clogs, shall enter\r\nupon the full fruition of its wondrous powers. And however brief it\r\nmay be, is it not better it should be devoted to noble work than to\r\nignoble idleness? Is it not better to use it as a time of preparation\r\nthan to waste it in empty pleasures? To the despairing wail of the\r\npoet just quoted we would oppose, as far worthier of a gallant\r\nspirit, Ben Jonson's admirable conclusions:--\r\n\r\n          \"It is not growing like a tree\r\n          In bulk, doth make men better be;\r\n    Or standing long an oak, three hundred year,\r\n    To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere.\r\n               A lily of a day\r\n               Is fairer far in May,\r\n        Although it fall and die that night;\r\n        It was the plant and flower of light.\r\n    In small proportions we just beauties see,\r\n    And in short measure life may perfect be.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the true philosophy; to make our life as perfect as our\r\nfaculties will permit, and to look upon it as the introduction to\r\na grander life, where the problems here discussed shall find a\r\nsatisfactory solution.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh for the time when in our seraph wings\r\n      We veil our brows before the Eternal Throne--\r\n    The day when, drinking knowledge at its springs,\r\n      We know as we are known.\"\r\n\r\nLet us beware, however, when we devote our life to the pursuit of\r\nwisdom, that we do not make a false start. Do not let us diverge into\r\nthe narrow way of bigotry and dogma. It is the property of exclusive\r\nand intolerant error to dominate and to reign alone. For this\r\nreason we systematically refuse and reject all control; and it is\r\nthus men have been fatally led to lay a rash hand upon intellectual\r\nliberty,--liberty, which the All-wise Himself has refrained from\r\ntouching! Such is the early taint of our race, the moral situation of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nBut retribution has followed close upon this violation of all that\r\nis most sacred in our human world. The schools of philosophy, and\r\nthe infallible creeds, founded upon authority to the exclusion of\r\nall mental and spiritual freedom, have never ceased to be at war\r\nwith one another, and instead of labouring for that union which is\r\nstrength,--that union so necessary to the happiness and advancement\r\nof humanity,--they have everywhere sown irreconcilable antipathies\r\nand bloody discords. Such is the religion of those who, under a\r\npretence of worshipping God, worship only themselves! History affords\r\nus abundant illustrations of this melancholy truth.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us return to our metamorphosis. The butterfly,\r\nwhich the Greeks designated by the same word as the soul, ψυχή,\r\nsprings, like every living creature, from an egg. But see what a\r\ntransformation this egg undergoes! It becomes a caterpillar--a\r\ntransitory form of animal life, remarkable for its voracity; this\r\ncaterpillar is in its turn transformed; it grows into a chrysalis,--a\r\ntemporary tomb, and whence issues the winged insect, alone adapted to\r\nthe discharge of all the functions of a perfect animal. Gluttonous\r\nand greedy of enjoyment, the caterpillar lived for itself. So the\r\ncaterpillar has no sex; while the butterfly hovers from flower to\r\nflower, has to seek therein its own nourishment, there to find the\r\ncompanion with whom its being is to be united.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis metamorphosis impresses the observer; principally because its\r\nperiods are so distinct, and are so plainly marked by stages, which\r\nhave all the appearance of veritable species. But he would greatly\r\nerr if he thought it confined to a certain class of insects. All\r\ninsects,--nay, more, all animals, including man himself,--undergo\r\ncertain transformations in the course of their lives. Metamorphosis\r\nplays an important part in the unity of the general scheme of\r\nCreative Thought. If it is not always recognised, the reason is, that\r\nits phases are not boldly marked, that the periods blend into one\r\nanother, that the various stages are effaced in the continuousness of\r\nthe transformation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut let not this continuity prevent the observer from detecting\r\nor discerning _in that which is, that which is to come_. In the\r\ncaterpillar he must learn to see the chrysalis; in the chrysalis he\r\nmust be ready to recognise the future butterfly. And in all these\r\nchanges the thoughtful mind may acknowledge a significant emblem of\r\nthat immortality of the soul, that final transformation of humanity,\r\nwhich the Word of God has promised to us:--\r\n\r\n    \"Child of the sun! pursue thy rapturous flight,\r\n    Mingling with her thou lov'st in fields of light;\r\n    And, where the fields of Paradise unfold,\r\n    Quaff fragrant nectars from their cups of gold.\r\n    There shall thy wings, rich as an evening sky,\r\n    Expand and shut with silent ecstasy!\r\n    Yet wert thou once a worm, a thing that crept\r\n    On the bare earth, then wrought a tomb and slept.\r\n    And such is man; soon from his cell of clay\r\n    To burst a seraph in the blaze of day.\"[92]\r\n\r\nTo assure ourselves by observation that, in living matter, there\r\nare organs irrevocably destined to decay or disappear, while others\r\nincline and grow towards perfection, is certainly one of the noblest\r\nstudies imaginable. If philosophers, instead of employing their time\r\nin profitless speculations, devoted themselves to the examination of\r\nthe great Book of Nature, God's second revelation, they would long\r\nago have discovered what they are still seeking.\r\n\r\nAnd we should now know how to distinguish, in man as in the insect,\r\nthe rudimentary condition of his future life; and the belief in the\r\nimmortality of the soul would not only be the creed of the Christian,\r\nbut a scientific truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Reference is here invited to Humboldt's _thermal_ and\r\n_isothermal_ lines.

Hoefer, without\r\naddition or alteration.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: From these slow movements, which have been designated\r\nthe \"secular inequalities,\" we might with some probability infer\r\nthe end of the world, which even Newton regarded as certain,--at\r\nleast, unless \"the Great Architect at times retouched His work.\"\r\nThe inequalities or secular variations affect the elements of the\r\norbits, such as the inclination of the plane of the orbit,--the\r\nsemi-major axis of the ellipse, or the mean distance of the planet\r\nfrom the sun,--the eccentricity of the ellipse, or the relation\r\nbetween the distance which separates the forces from the centre\r\nand the semi-major axis assumed to be unity,--and the movements of\r\nthe perihelions and the nodes. These elements change with extreme\r\nslowness. Thus, the inclination of Jupiter diminishes by 8\" in a\r\ncentury; and that of Saturn increases by 9\"; but the very ecliptic\r\nvaries,--it diminishes 33\" in a century.\r\n\r\nThe variations of the eccentricities are scarcely computable by\r\ncenturies; their effect is, that the ellipses insensibly approach or\r\nrecede from a circular form.\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrated by mathematical analysis that these variations are\r\nperiodical, and confined within narrow limits, in such wise that \"the\r\nplanetary system can oscillate only round a certain mean, from which\r\nit never departs except by a very small quantity.\" But may not this\r\nvery mean, which we have taken to be constant, oscillate round a more\r\ndistant and still more constant mean?\r\n\r\nObservation had long ago detected a continual acceleration in the\r\nmovement of Jupiter, and a not less certain diminution in the\r\nmovement of Saturn. Now, to say of a star that its velocity augments,\r\nis to declare that it draws nearer its centre of movement. To say\r\nthat its velocity decreases, is to affirm that it is retiring from\r\nthat centre.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that Jupiter,[88] the greatest of our\r\nplanets, is destined to be swallowed up, or absorbed, in the\r\nincandescent mass of the Sun, while Saturn,[89] with its belt and\r\neight satellites, will gradually wander further and further into\r\nthe mysterious infinity of space. It is true enough that these\r\ncatastrophes are very distant,--distant to a period of time which\r\nthe human imagination cannot even grasp,--and the \"common herd\" will\r\ncertainly feel no anxious apprehension about an event which will not\r\ntake place until myriads of years have elapsed.\r\n\r\nYet, in the last century, the question excited the curiosity of\r\ncertain scientific societies, and they directed the attention of the\r\ngeometers to these formidable perturbations. Euler and Lagrange spent\r\ntheir keen intellects upon them to no profit. Laplace discovered that\r\nbetween the mean velocities of Jupiter and Saturn the ratios are\r\nsimple, and capable of calculation; five times the velocity of Saturn\r\nperceptibly equals ten times the velocity of Jupiter. These terms,\r\nwhich, in the regularly-decreasing and indefinite series, might have\r\nbeen neglected, have acquired a value which was worthy of being taken\r\ninto consideration. From thence result, in the movements of the two\r\nplanets, those perturbations whose complete development necessitates\r\na period of upwards of nine hundred years.... This will be, then,\r\nanother periodic inequality.\r\n\r\nBut, independently of the centres, which we suppose to be in\r\nthemselves variable, may there not exist, in the space traversed by\r\nour planet, some cause of perturbation? Is our system so isolated in\r\nthe universe that it neither receives nor loses aught of that which\r\nconstitutes its force and matter? Is there no solidarity between\r\nits different worlds? And if this solidarity exists, is not their\r\ntransformation a necessity?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: The equatorial diameter of Jupiter in English miles is\r\n56,065; its density is ·24 of the Earth's; its distance from the sun,\r\n494,270,000 miles; inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic, 1° 18'\r\n51\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: The equatorial diameter of Saturn in English miles is\r\n79,147; its density, ·12, the Earth = 1; its distance from the sun,\r\n906,200,000 miles; and the inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic,\r\n2° 29' 36\".]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Our author, it must be understood, is considering these\r\nquestions apart from the Scriptural standpoint.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: William Drummond.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: Samuel Rogers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total Solar Eclipse, which is to render famous the month of\r\nDecember in the present year--famous, that is, in astronomical\r\nannals--deserves, we think, some special notice in our pages. In\r\n1860, the _Himalaya_ was fitted out by Government for the use of\r\nthe _savants_ desirous of observing the Solar Eclipse visible that\r\nyear in Spain, and the results of the expedition were so important\r\nas fully to warrant the liberality of the Government. The eclipse of\r\nthe present year will also be visible in Spain, but the path of the\r\nsun's shadow will pass as far north as Cape Spartel, and, crossing\r\nAlgeria, will go northwards, _via_ Sicily, and in the direction of\r\nConstantinople. The totality of the eclipse will not last so long\r\nas that of the Indian eclipse in 1868. The sun will be hidden from\r\nsight for no longer period than about two minutes twelve seconds, and\r\nwhatever observations our astronomers are anxious to make must be\r\nmade in that brief interval. It may not unreasonably be suggested\r\nthat, in so short a time, no data can be ascertained worth the\r\ncost and trouble the proposed expedition will necessitate; but the\r\nreader requires to be informed that the most valuable acquisitions\r\nlately won in the region of solar physics have been the result of\r\nobservations which may almost be described as momentary.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the important point on which our astronomers hope to\r\ngain information from a close examination of the approaching eclipse?\r\n\r\nThis question has been ably answered by a well-informed writer in\r\nthe _Daily News_. The great problem to be solved is that of the\r\nstrange appearance of the solar corona; of that glory of light which\r\nrings round the great luminary when totally eclipsed, to it, as some\r\nastronomers assert, a purely optical phenomenon, or, as others more\r\nreasonably declare, \"one of the most imposing of all the features\r\nof the solar system.\" It is true that the former opinion is held by\r\nsuch men as Faye, Lockyer, and Professor Airy; but if it be founded\r\non fact, the phenomenon loses all its importance, and nearly all\r\nits interest. If the other opinion prove correct, and the corona is\r\ndiscovered to be in reality an appendage of the orb of day, then\r\nthe mind must at once acknowledge its unsurpassed splendour, its\r\nmagnificent proportions. As its glow and ethereal radiancy often\r\nextends several degrees from the eclipsed sun, its diameter cannot be\r\nless than 2,800,000 miles.\r\n\r\nAssume, then, that it is shaped like a globe, that it is the globular\r\nenvelope (so to speak) of the sun, and we may conclude that its outer\r\nboundary would at most enclose a volume twenty-seven times as large\r\nas the sun's, or, in other words, _twenty-seven million times_ larger\r\nthan our terrestrial world.\r\n\r\nIt is in reference to this magnificent phenomenon that we hope to\r\nobtain some satisfactory information in December 1870. The results\r\nascertained from the eclipse of 1868 proved to be almost directly\r\ncontradictory to those obtained last year in the United States,\r\nand the problem now is, to discover _why_ these results were\r\ncontradictory.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime,--observes the writer already quoted,--some\r\nastronomers say that the observations already made suffice to show\r\nthe real nature of the solar corona. \"It has frequently happened\r\nthat, with the means of solving a problem ready at their hands,\r\nastronomers have been content rather to wait till new observations\r\nremoved their doubts, than to undertake the work of carefully\r\nanalysing the facts already discovered. It is urged that the\r\natmospheric explanation (Faye's and Lockyer's) is opposed by simple\r\noptical considerations; that the blackness of the moon's disc, in\r\nthe very heart of the corona, affords the most unmistakable evidence\r\nthat the moon lies nearer to us than the corona.\" The solar glare\r\nwhich, according to Faye's theory, illuminates our atmosphere,\r\nought, according to this view--and ordinary reasoners will think\r\nthis argument irrefragable--to cover the lunar disc as well as the\r\nsurrounding heavens.\r\n\r\nIt is also argued, very forcibly, that the active atmosphere above\r\nthe horizon of the observer is partially obscured during total\r\neclipse, while all that part lying in the direction in which the\r\ncorona is seen is wholly shielded from the direct rays of the sun,\r\nand cannot, therefore, furnish the \"atmospheric glare\" on which M.\r\nFaye relies.\r\n\r\nM. Faye's theory is powerfully combated in a paper read by Mr Proctor\r\nbefore the Royal Astronomical Society, and a summary of which\r\nappeared in \"Nature.\"[93]\r\n\r\nHe remarked that if we in reality possess sufficient evidence to\r\ndetermine whether the corona is or is not a solar appendage, it would\r\nbe unfortunate for, and in some sense a discredit to science, if the\r\nprecious seconds available for observers in December next were wasted\r\nupon observations directed to such a point determinable beforehand.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to express his belief that the corona was no terrestrial\r\nphenomenon, arguing that the very blackness of the moon as compared\r\nwith the corona (to which we have already referred), shows that\r\nthe coronal splendour is _behind_ the moon. In fact, the moon is\r\nprojected on the corona as on a background; whereas, if the light be\r\ndue to atmospheric glare, the corona ought to be a foreground.\r\n\r\nThis argument, however, may fail on the ground of its very\r\nsimplicity. Mr Proctor, therefore, proceeded to inquire whether air\r\nwhich lies between the observer and the corona is really illuminated.\r\nHe pointed out that all round the sun, for many degrees, perfect\r\ndarkness should prevail if the illumination of the atmosphere by\r\ndirect solar light were in question. As to the atmospheric glare\r\ncaused by the coloured flames and prominences of the sun's disc, it\r\nmust be comparatively small, bearing no higher proportion to the\r\nactual light of the atmosphere than ordinary atmospheric glare bears\r\nto actual sunlight,--a very small proportion indeed.\r\n\r\nBut a fatal objection to the theory that the corona is due either\r\nto the glare from the prominences or to light reflected from the\r\nsurrounding air, consisted in the fact that the so-called glare ought\r\nto cover the moon's disc.\r\n\r\nMr Proctor next referred to a number of observations in support\r\nof the view that the coronal light is not terrestrial; such as\r\nthe appearance of glare during partial eclipses, the glare always\r\ntrenching on the lunar disc; the relatively greater darkness of the\r\ncentral part of the lunar disc in annular eclipses; the visibility\r\nof that part of the lunar disc which lies beyond the sun in partial\r\neclipses, the limb being seen dark on the background of the sky; and\r\nthe visibility of the corona in partial eclipses;--were its most\r\ndistinctive peculiarities, having been recognised when the sun's face\r\nis not wholly covered.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, _is_ the actual nature of the corona?\r\n\r\nMay it not consist of the denser parts of meteoric systems travelling\r\nround the sun?\r\n\r\nLeverrier has shown, and Mr Buxendell has helped to show, that the\r\nmotion of Mercury's perihelion indicates the presence of a ring\r\nof bodies in the vicinity of the sun; but we have good reason for\r\nbelieving that for each meteor system our earth encounters, there\r\nmust be millions on millions whose perihelia lie within the earth's\r\norbit. Since the earth meets with fifty-six such systems, it will be\r\nseen how enormous probably is the total number.\r\n\r\nIs, then, the corona simply the projection of these systems,\r\nilluminated as they must be by an intensity of solar light exceeding\r\nmany hundred-fold that which illumines our summer days, nay, in\r\ncertain places, were raised by his heat to a state of incandescence?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the questions which, it is hoped, the eclipse of\r\nDecember 1870 will help to solve; and we think our readers will\r\nadmit that their importance justifies us in looking forward to the\r\napproaching phenomenon with anxious curiosity. The bounds of human\r\nknowledge are gradually enlarging; and as they enlarge, they do but\r\nmore vividly illustrate the infinite wisdom and perfectness of the\r\nscheme of creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURED STARS.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing these pages to a close, and appending to our\r\ndescription of Everyday Objects (everyday, but not commonplace) the\r\nword \"Finis,\" we wish to direct the reader's attention to the subject\r\nof coloured stars; not because these beautiful spheres can be fairly\r\nclassed under our general title, but because they serve to show the\r\npeculiar attractiveness and novelty of scientific inquiry, and the\r\nwonderful results that spring from the persevering study of God's\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nTo the eye of the ordinary observer, one star seems much like\r\nanother; these \"lamps of night\" differ, indeed, in brilliancy, in\r\ntheir distance from the earth, in their relative magnitudes; but\r\nto all appearance they exhibit a complete identity in physical\r\nconstitution, and their white light has furnished poetry with one of\r\nits commonest images.\r\n\r\nBut the astronomer, armed with his wonder-revealing glass, has\r\ndiscovered that innumerable stars are exquisitely coloured; that some\r\nare blue, and others green, and others red. If on a clear night you\r\nexamine Perseus with your telescope, you will find that the star Eta\r\nis of a glowing red. In the system of Ophiuchus you will encounter a\r\nblue star; in that of Draco, a deep red star; Taurus has a large red\r\nand a small bluish star; and in Argo, a blue sun is attended by a\r\ndark-red satellite.\r\n\r\nThe stars occur in double, triple, or multiple groups or clusters;\r\nand the systems so constituted differ from what we presumptuously\r\ncall _the_ Solar System in their colouring; and in this variety\r\nor diversity, yet another variety is visible. The binary coloured\r\nsystems are not all composed of blue and red suns. In that of Gamma\r\nAndromedæ the great central orb is of an orange hue, the moon\r\nrevolving round it green as emerald. What results from the marriage\r\nof these two colours--from this union of orange and emerald? Do\r\nwe not see in it, says a French astronomer,[94] a combination,\r\nif the phrase is allowable, full of youth (_assortiment plein de\r\njeunesse_)--a grand, a magnificent orange-coloured sun in the\r\nmidst of the firmament--next to it, a resplendent emerald, which\r\ninterweaves with the gold its greenish gleams?\r\n\r\nThe following lively picture is borrowed from the graphic pages of M.\r\nFlammarion.\r\n\r\nThere is more variety, he says, in the innumerable star-systems which\r\ncrowd the fields of space, than in all the changes which the most\r\nskilful opticians can project on the screen of a magic lantern. Some\r\nof the planetary universes lighted up by two suns display the entire\r\ngamut of colours above blue, but are without the sparkling tints of\r\ngold and purple which contribute so greatly to the luminosity of our\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn this category may be placed certain systems situated in the\r\nconstellations of Andromedæ, the Serpent, Ophiuchus, and Coma\r\nBerenices.\r\n\r\nOthers are illuminated by red suns, as, for example, a double star in\r\nLeo.\r\n\r\nOthers, again, are wholly dominated by blue and yellow, or, at least,\r\nare kindled by a blue sun and a yellow sun, which afford but a\r\nlimited series of the tints or shades comprised in the combinations\r\nof these primitive colours; such are the systems of Ceta, Eridanus\r\n(where one is straw-coloured, the other blue), Cameleopardalis,\r\nOrion, Rhinoceros, Gemini, Boötes (where the greater one is yellow,\r\nand the lesser a greenish blue), and Cygnus (where the smaller is\r\n\"blue as a sapphire\"). On the other hand, combinations of red and\r\ngreen may be found in Cassiopeia, Coma Berenices, and Hercules.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are other stellar systems which, according to Flammarion,\r\nmore nearly approximate to our own, in the sense that one of the\r\nsuns illuminating them has, like ours, a white light,--the source\r\nof all colours,--while its neighbouring luminary casts a permanent\r\nreflection upon everything. Such, for instance, are the worlds\r\nrevolving round the great sun of Alpha, in Aries; this great sun is\r\nwhite, but a smaller sun is constantly visible in the sky, whose\r\nazure reflections cover as with \"a diaphanous veil\" the various\r\nobjects exposed to its rays. Number 26 in Ceta presents the same\r\nconditions, which are those, too, of a great number of the most\r\nbrilliant stars. In the case of the worlds gravitating round the\r\nprincipal world of these binary systems, the originative white\r\nlustre would appear to create the infinite varieties noticeable upon\r\nthe earth, with the distinction, of course, that an azure gleam\r\nconstantly issues from the other sun; but for the planets gravitating\r\nround the latter, the predominant colouring will be blue, tempered by\r\nthe action of the remoter white sun.\r\n\r\nAnd just as white suns have blue suns for their companions, so\r\nhave red suns yellow, or _vice versâ_. What a strange and curious\r\nradiance--like that of \"a dome of many-coloured glass\"--must be shed\r\nupon a planet by its red and green or yellow and blue suns! What\r\nstriking contrasts, what fairylike changes, must be produced by a red\r\nday and a green day succeeding alternately to a white day, or a day\r\nof darkness! Why do not our poets take up such a theme as this? Can\r\nthey find aught more remarkable or more eëry in the dreams of their\r\nimagination?\r\n\r\nSupposing that these wonderful spheres are surrounded, like Jupiter\r\nor Saturn, by a ring of satellites, what can be their aspect when lit\r\nup by several suns, each sun a source of different-coloured light?\r\n\r\nThis one, we may imagine, will be divided into hemispheres, red\r\nand blue, that will suspend in the firmament a crescent of gold;\r\nanother will seem to drop from the azure circle like a gorgeous\r\ncluster of emerald fruit. Ruby moons, opaline moons, moons of\r\njasper and amethyst,--all shining with a mystic and indescribable\r\nradiance,--surely the heavens are decked with jewels like an Eastern\r\nqueen!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--\"Bright with the beauty of the silver moon.\"]\r\n\r\nOur poets may chant the praises of our modest, simple nights, of our\r\ncalm, hushed heavens, bright only with the beauty of the silver moon,\r\nwhich pours its pale lustre with a winning charm on town and tree, on\r\nwood and lake. They may sing, as Barry Cornwall sings--\r\n\r\n    \"Now to thy silent presence, night!\r\n      Is this my first song offer'd: oh! to thee\r\n    That lookest with thy thousand eyes of light--\r\n      To thee and thy starry nobility\r\n    That float with a delicious murmuring--\r\n      Though unheard here--about thy forehead blue;\r\n      And as they ride along in order due,\r\n    Circling the round globe in their wandering.\r\n    To thee their ancient queen and mother sing....\r\n    Not dull and cold and dark art thou:\r\n    Who that beholds thy clearer brow,\r\n    Endiademed with gentlest streaks\r\n      Of fleecy-silver'd cloud, adorning\r\n    Thee, fair as when the young sun wakes....\r\n      But must feel thy powers.\"\r\n\r\nIn some such ecstatic strains as this we may laud our moonlit nights,\r\nacknowledging in our heart of hearts the power of their silent,\r\nsubtle loveliness; but how shall we compare them with nights made\r\nwonderful by a blending of golden and emerald fires? by the shifting\r\ncoruscations of stars of many colours?\r\n\r\nBut here we must conclude a dissertation which threatens to become a\r\nrhapsody. It is difficult, however, to treat of such a theme, and to\r\nfollow up all its strange and startling suggestions, in sober prose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALPINE FLORA.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine Flora, of which in a preceding section we have given a\r\nvery imperfect sketch, has been examined with loving minuteness by\r\nMessrs Elijah Walton and T. G. Bonney; and other united results of\r\npen and pencil have been placed before the public in a handsome\r\nvolume entitled \"Flowers from the Upper Alps, with Glimpses of\r\ntheir Homes.\" A somewhat similar subject has been treated with much\r\ndelicacy of feeling and fervour of description by the Rev. Hugh\r\nMacmillan, in his \"Holidays in High Lands.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the Alpine plants sketched and described by Messrs Walton\r\nand Bonney are the beautiful _Lychnis_, a close relative of our\r\ncorn-cockle and garden pink, and so called, says Gerard, the quaint\r\nold botanist, because it is a \"light-giving flower.\" He also met with\r\nimmense breadths of violet _pansies_,--\"that's for thoughts,\" says\r\nOphelia,--covering the sloping pasture-grounds of the Col d'Autune,\r\nand blending with rose and star gentians, soldanellas, primulas, and\r\nanemones. The pink blossoms and bare stem of the _house leek_ is\r\nfound \"among the blocks tumbled down from the ice-streams, and its\r\nsparkling clusters seem to glow with a richer hue on the stony ruin\r\nwhich has shattered the pine, and crushed the life even out of the\r\nrhododendron.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Glarus Alps the odorous crimson tufts of the _Kammblume_\r\nare discovered in a profusion which rejoices and astonishes the\r\ntraveller. The yellow-blossomed _ragwort_ spreads its stem over\r\nthe rugged mountain-sides in every Alpine district. But next in\r\nfame and beauty to the gentians,--which is, _par excellence_, the\r\nmountain-flower,--must be placed the _edelwein_, celebrated by Kobele\r\nand other famous poets, and growing in almost every part of the Alps\r\nfrom Dauphiné to the Dolomites.\r\n\r\nFor further details respecting a most interesting branch of botany,\r\nwe refer the reader to the two works already named, and he will find\r\nthat the barrenest, stoniest slope of the Alpine rocks, the bleak\r\nrecesses where the ice river has its origin, and the rugged ledge\r\nwhere the pitiless winds seem to expend their wildest fury, have\r\ntheir objects of grace and beauty,--their gentle and ever-welcome\r\nevidence of the Divine love, the Divine wisdom, and the Divine power,\r\nas exercised for the delight of man in the remotest wildernesses of\r\nthe earth. The love of God is everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: \"Nature,\" vol. i. p. 543.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: Flammarion, \"Les Merveilles Celestes,\" pp. 160, 161.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Academy,\" the, quoted, 369-371.\r\n\r\n    Achtysia, the genus, characteristics of, 353.\r\n\r\n    _Aeshna grandis_, described, 178;\r\n      _forcipata_, 178, 179.\r\n\r\n    _Agaricus Cæsareus_, the, description of, 333, 334.\r\n\r\n    Agarics, varieties of, characterised, 335, 336.\r\n\r\n    Agarions, the, general characteristics of their form, 79.\r\n\r\n    _Agarion virgo_, the, described, 179.\r\n\r\n    Alps, the, an excursion among, 256-260.\r\n\r\n    Alpine snail, the, remarkable transparency of, 71.\r\n\r\n    _Amanita muscaria_, the, described, 328-330;\r\n      its poisonous properties, 331-333.\r\n\r\n    _Amanita solitarius_, the, description of, 331.\r\n\r\n    Amphibia, the, number of species of, 361, 362.\r\n\r\n    Anaximander, the author of the \"Uranometria,\" his enumeration of\r\n      the stars, 25.\r\n\r\n    Ancients, the, their notion of the earth's shape, 104-107.\r\n\r\n    Anemones, the, blossoming time of, 157, 158;\r\n      their sensitiveness to atmospheric changes, 158;\r\n      varieties of, 159;\r\n      references to, by Drayton, 159-161.\r\n\r\n    Animal life, distribution of, 357, 366.\r\n\r\n    Antipodes, the, existence of, believed in by the ancients, 107;\r\n      proved by Columbus, 108, 109.\r\n\r\n    Arabs of the desert, the, their nomenclature for the stars, 22, 23.\r\n\r\n    Aratus, the author of \"Phenomena,\" quoted, 22.\r\n\r\n    Arctic vole, the, discovery of, by M.
