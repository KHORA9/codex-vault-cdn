They\r\nwill apply equally well to young and old. 'Let the business of every\r\none alone, and attend to your own.--Don't buy what you don't want. Use\r\nevery hour to advantage, and study even to make leisure hours useful.\r\nThink twice before you spend a shilling; remember you have another to\r\nmake for it. Find recreation in looking after your business, and so\r\nyour business will not be neglected in looking after recreation.--Buy\r\nfair, sell fair, take care of the profits; look over the books\r\nregularly, and if you find an error, trace it out. Should a stroke of\r\nmisfortune come upon you in trade, retrench--work harder, but never\r\nfly the track; confront difficulties with unflinching perseverance,\r\nand they will disappear at last, and you will be honored; but shrink\r\nfrom the task, and you will be despised.'\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn Russia, coffins are generally brown, but children have pink, grown\r\nup unmarried girls sky blue, while other females are indulged with a\r\nviolet color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barnum's Safety Apparatus]\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--Much has been said of late in and about New York on the\r\nsubject of the adoption by steamboat proprietors of some apparatus\r\nthat will in some measure secure the passengers against such\r\ncasualties as have occurred on board the Excelsior and several other\r\nboats. There have been a great variety of inventions introduced for\r\nthe purpose of preventing explosions; but from the best information we\r\ncan obtain on the subject, we are of the opinion that Mr. Barnum's\r\napparatus takes a general preference over all others. It consists of\r\nan arrangement of machinery, partly within the boiler, and which is\r\nconstructed on such a self-regulating principle as to keep up a supply\r\nof water within the boiler, without any attention from the engineer;\r\nand in case that the apparatus itself should become impaired or cease\r\nto operate regular, the engineer becomes instantly notified thereof.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.--It is inexpedient for us to give a full and minute\r\ndescription of the several points and peculiarities of the mechanism\r\nof this apparatus; but we may so far explain as to say that a\r\nhorizontal lever inside of the boiler, being mounted on a pivot near\r\nits centre, and connected to a buoy or float at one end, as\r\nrepresented in the engraving, (a part of the surface of the boiler\r\nbeing omitted for that purpose, and not, as some might infer, to\r\nrepresent the apparatus attached to a boiler already burst by an\r\nexplosion.) One of these floats is placed within a small enclosed box\r\nwithin the boiler, that it may be secure from the effect of foam which\r\nsometimes pervades the surface of the water in a steam boiler.--This\r\nlever, near its bearing, is connected to a short valve-rod, which\r\ngoverns the valves in a small valve-chamber, whereby the steam is\r\noccasionally admitted to operate a small steam engine, placed directly\r\nover the boiler; and this engine puts in motion a pump, by which the\r\nwater in the boiler is replenished. This engine, it will be\r\nunderstood, is never put in operation except when the water in the\r\nboiler becomes too low: and when the water rises, the elevation of the\r\nencased float closes the valve and stops the engine. The ball on the\r\nend of the lever acts as a counterpoise to the float, (which is of\r\nstone) that it may be freely influenced by the rising or falling of\r\nthe surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe small engine constructed by Mr. Barnum for this purpose, is well\r\nadapted to its place, and has several peculiarities whereby the\r\nvalves, and consequent reciprocal motion of the engine are regulated\r\nwithout the use of a crank or fly-wheel: but of these we cannot at\r\npresent give a minute description. The whole of this apparatus evinces\r\nmuch scientific ability of the inventor, Daniel Barnum, Esq., resident\r\nat present in this city, and who has received many certificates from\r\nthe first scientific men in the Union, in commendation of his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Piggish Parvenue.=\r\n\r\nA proud porker, fancying that it was degrading to his dignity to root\r\nin the gutter, came upon the sidewalk, and full of his consequence,\r\npromenaded from morning till night, leaving his humbler companions to\r\nmunch corn, husks and potatoe parings. He fared as people usually do,\r\nwho from vanity assume a station they are not qualified to fill. In\r\nthe gutter he would have lived in unnoticed enjoyment. On the walk he\r\ngot kicked by every passenger and bitten by every cur, till hungry and\r\nbruised he was glad to return to his proper station.--[Ex, paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wanting Workmen back Again.=\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of the cotton mill in Schuylerville, N. Y., who\r\nreduced the wages of their hands, a week or two since, says the\r\nSchuylerville Herald, twenty-five per cent., are now, and have been\r\nfor several days, endeavoring to induce them to return to their work,\r\nat the old wages; but they are too late, as most of them are engaged\r\nto work in other mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hard Climbing.=\r\n\r\nA man in Orange county was found one night climbing an over-shot wheel\r\nin a fulling mill. He was asked what he was doing. He said he was\r\n'trying to go up to bed, but some how or other these stairs won't hold\r\nstill.' There are many unlucky wights who are laboriously endeavoring\r\nto climb fortune's ladder on the same principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Power of Imagination.=\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident recently occurred at Williams College, which is\r\nthus related by a correspondent of the Springfield Gazette:\r\n\r\nThe professor of chemistry, while administering, in the course of his\r\nlectures, the protoxide of nitrogen, or, as it is commonly called,\r\nlaughing gas, in order to ascertain how great an influence the\r\nimagination had in producing the effects consequent on respiring it,\r\nsecretly filled the India rubber gas-bag with common air instead of\r\ngas. It was taken without suspicion, and the effects, if anything,\r\nwere more powerful than upon those who had really breathed the pure\r\ngas. One complained that it produced nausea and dizziness, another\r\nimmediately manifested pugilistic propensities, and before he could be\r\nrestrained, tore in pieces the coat of one of the bystanders, while\r\nthe third exclaimed, 'this is life. I never enjoyed it before.' The\r\nlaughter that followed the exposure of this gaseous trick may be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=True Policy.=\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances there is but one honest course; and that is,\r\nto do right and trust the consequences to Divine Providence. 'Duties\r\nare ours: events are God's.' Policy, with all her cunning, can devise\r\nno rule so safe, salutary and effective, as this simple maxim.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nSix thousand pounds of Saxony wool have been purchased in Pennsylvania,\r\nat sixty-two and a half cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF PATENTS\r\n\r\n_Issued from the 20th of July to the 28th of July, 1846, inclusive._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo M.

Terms $1 per annum. By J. K.\r\nWellman, 116 Nassau street.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Delicate Compliment.=\r\n\r\nWashington was sometimes given to pleasantry. Journeying east on one\r\noccasion, attended by two of his aids, he asked some young ladies at a\r\nhotel where he breakfasted, how they liked the appearance of his young\r\nmen! One of them promptly replied, 'We cannot judge of the STARS in\r\nthe presence of the SUN!'\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fatal Deer Fight.=\r\n\r\nThe skeleton heads of two deers, their antlers so closely interlocked\r\nthat they cannot be disengaged without violence, were found about a\r\nmonth ago by a gentleman while hunting in Nassau county, East Florida.\r\nThe ground for a quarter of an acre was completely cut up by their\r\nhoofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Provoking Blunder.=\r\n\r\nThe letter bags for the steamer Cambria, despatched from this city,\r\nand containing upwards of ten thousand letters for Europe, was taken\r\nfrom the Boston Post Office by a country stage driver, through\r\nmistake, and the Cambria was compelled to sail without them. They were\r\nreturned to this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curious Needlework.=\r\n\r\nA complete map of the State of Pennsylvania, wrought in lace--in which\r\nthe town, counties, rivers, &c., are all distinctly shown, each county\r\nbeing worked in a style of lace different from those adjoining--is\r\nbeing exhibited in Baltimore, and commands much admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Credit System.=\r\n\r\nWe infer, from certain polite hints and intimation, in the\r\n'Massachusetts Farmers' and Mechanics' Leger,' that that paper is\r\ncirculated on trust. If so, the publishers are in no danger of wanting\r\nbusiness for some years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Charcoal Road.=\r\n\r\nThe citizens of Yazoo, Miss., have determined to make a charcoal road\r\nover the valley swamp of that place. Sixty hands cutting timber will\r\nburn and spread the coal over two miles in thirty days--the\r\nembankments being already thrown up.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Quick Work.=\r\n\r\nThe Baltimore Sun says--'A communication was made from _Buffalo to\r\nBaltimore_ last week, and an answer was received at the telegraph\r\noffice in the former city in about _two hours_!'\r\n\r\n\r\n=Oregon Currency.=\r\n\r\nBy an act of the Oregon Legislature, wheat is made a lawful tender, in\r\npayment of debts or taxes, at the market prices, when delivered at\r\nsuch places as it is customary for the merchants to receive it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Suffering by Success.=\r\n\r\nIt is reported that a gentleman congratulated Mr. Polk on having\r\ncarried all his measures through Congress. Mr. Polk replied, 'Yes, I\r\nhave carried all of them through, and am the weaker for the passage of\r\neach one of them.'\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Rich Ore.=\r\n\r\nThe Detroit Advertiser, in an article upon the nature of the ores in\r\nthe Lake Superior region, remarks that Messrs. Robbins and Hubbard, of\r\nthat city, have recently assayed a specimen of native copper from Lake\r\nSuperior, and found in 12 ounces of copper, not only 1-3/4 ounces of\r\npure silver, but several grains of gold!\r\n\r\n\r\n=Musical.=\r\n\r\nThe gross receipts of a late musical festival at Birmingham, amounted\r\nto $56,000.

J. ANDREWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I ask not for the glittering wreath,\r\n      Of India's sparkling diamonds rare,\r\n    To deck my brow, while oft beneath,\r\n      There throbs a heart with heaviest care.\r\n\r\n    I ask not for the gilded chain,\r\n      Of perishing and worthless gold,\r\n    To clasp my neck, while oft in vain\r\n      The heart's best sympathies unfold.\r\n\r\n    Oh! give me not the worthless dust,\r\n      For which vain, anxious mortals toil,\r\n    To treasure up where moth and rust,\r\n      Doth soon corrupt the hoarded pile.\r\n\r\n    I covet not the gay attire,\r\n      In which vain beauty oft appears,\r\n    Oft that which wondering crowds admire,\r\n      Needeth far more their heartfelt tears.\r\n\r\n    But there's an ornament I crave;--\r\n      To grant, vain world, it is not thine,\r\n    It floateth not o'er yon proud wave,\r\n      Nor yields it me earth's richest mine.\r\n\r\n    Oh, may it be a guileless heart!\r\n      In heaven's own sight of priceless worth!\r\n    Where nought corrupting e'er hath part,\r\n      Pure, as the source which gave it birth.\r\n\r\n    _A spirit meek and pure within;_\r\n      May this, alone, my life adorn,\r\n    Unsullied by the touch of sin,\r\n     Though subject to the proud world's scorn.\r\n\r\n    This ornament, O God of Love!\r\n      'Tis Thine, and Thine alone, to give;\r\n    Oh, may I its rich beauties prove,\r\n      And in its full possession, _live_!\r\n\r\n    _Bethel, Conn._, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Female Piety.=\r\n\r\nThe gem of all others which enriches the coronet of woman's character,\r\nis unaffected piety. Nature may lavish much on her person; the\r\nenchantment of her countenance, the grace of her mind, the strength of\r\nher intellect; yet her loveliness is uncrowned till piety throws\r\naround the whole the sweetness and power of its charms. She then\r\nbecomes unearthly in her desires and associations. The spell which\r\nbound her affections to the things below is broken, and she mounts on\r\nthe silent wings of her fancy and hope to the habitation of God, where\r\nit is her delight to hold communion with the spirits that have been\r\nransomed from the thraldom of Earth and wreathed with a garland of\r\nglory. Her beauty may throw a magical charm over many; princes and\r\nconquerors may bow with admiration at the shrine of her beauty and\r\nlove; the sons of science may embalm her memory in the page of\r\nhistory; yet her piety must be her ornament, her pearl. Her name must\r\nbe written in 'The Book of Life,' that when the mountains fade away,\r\nand every memento of earthly greatness is lost in the general wreck of\r\nnature, it may remain and swell the list of that mighty throng who\r\nhave been clothed in the mantle of righteousness, and their voices\r\nattuned to the melody of Heaven. With such a treasure, every lofty\r\ngratification on earth may be purchased; friendship will be doubly\r\nsweet; and sorrow will lose their sting; and the character will\r\npossess a price far above rubies: life will be but a pleasant visit to\r\nearth, and entrance upon a joyful and perpetual home. And when the\r\nnotes of the last trump shall be heard, and sleeping millions awake to\r\njudgment, its possessor shall be presented faultless before the throne\r\nof God with exceeding joy, and a crown of glory that shall never wear\r\naway. Such is piety. Like a tender flower, planted in the fertile soil\r\nof woman's heart, it grows, expanding in its foliage, and imparting\r\nits fragrance to all around, till transplanted, and set to bloom in\r\nperpetual vigor and unfading beauty, in the Paradise of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Iron Ore.=\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable beds of iron ore ever discovered has been\r\nfound in the northeast corner of Dodge county, Wisconsin, and is said\r\nto yield ninety per cent. The deposit is 30 feet thick.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\n'Pursue your calling with diligence, and your creditor shall not\r\ninterrupt you.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lewis's Reversible Faucet Filters.=\r\n\r\nHighly favorable as our opinion may be of the several excellent\r\nfilters which have been introduced, we cannot avoid giving a\r\npreference to the one recently invented by Mr. S. H. Lewis. It\r\nconsists of a very neat faucet, calculated to be attached to a common\r\nCroton or other hydrant, and in connection with the faucet key, is a\r\ncircular chamber, three inches in diameter, within which is a circular\r\nfilter consisting of a quantity of cotton cloth, flannel sponge or\r\nporous porcelain (which is preferred) compressed between two\r\nperforated metallic disks: and the faucet key is so constructed that\r\nby turning it to the right, the water is permitted to flow through the\r\nfilter in one direction; but its course is reversed and it is made to\r\nflow in the opposite direction through the filter by turning the key\r\nto the left. The filter is thus cleansed at pleasure without any\r\ntrouble, on examination of the filter or chamber. They may be seen at\r\n28 1-2 Broadway.\r\n\r\n\r\n=West's Cheap and Convenient Filter.=\r\n\r\nFor the thousands of families in this city whose houses are not\r\nfurnished with the Croton water-pipes, a neat portable filter,\r\nrecently invented by Mr. N. West, of this city, is as near perfection,\r\nin convenience and utility, as could be furnished for the low price of\r\n_one dollar_, and should find a place in every house or shop where the\r\nCroton water is used. It consists of two conical pails, one within the\r\nother; the first is furnished with an efficient filter at the bottom\r\nthereof; and the other has a faucet, by which the water is drawn off\r\nas occasion requires. They may be found at 156 Delancy street.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Improved Yoke for Oxen.=\r\n\r\nThis yoke is constructed with sliding blocks attached to the under\r\nside of the beam of the yoke, near each end, and each sliding block is\r\nattached to the beam by bolts which pass through mortises so that the\r\nblocks may be made to slide occasionally to the right or left. To\r\nthese blocks are attached the bows, the position of which are adjusted\r\nby gauge screws; and by the sliding of the blocks, the distance of the\r\noxen from each other may be regulated. The middle of the yoke is\r\nfurnished with a draught staple or eye-bolt which is moveable and\r\nregulated by a hand screw at the top, whereby the _pitch_ of the\r\ndraught it regulated. Invented by David Chappel, and entered at the\r\nPatent Office, Sept. 3d.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Another Improvement In Stoves.=\r\n\r\nMessrs. Hartshorn, Payson & Ring entered at the Patent Office,\r\nSeptember 3d, an improved stove, in which they claim the combination\r\nof the common wood stove and cylinder coal stove, so that the coal may\r\nbe burned alone, and the draught so arranged as at the same time to\r\nheat the wood stove with the same heat, and if wood alone should be\r\nburned, then the draught should be so managed and arranged as at the\r\nsame time to heat the side radiators and coal cylinders. A minute\r\ndescription of this improvement, is not, in this place, essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Iron Shingles.=\r\n\r\nWe have never been able to understand the reason why iron has so long\r\nbeen neglected as a covering for roofs, but are gratified to learn\r\nthat Mr. Wm. Beach, of Troy, N. Y., has invented and patented a mode\r\nof using cast iron plates for covering roofs. They are about one foot\r\nsquare, and are made to fit one into another, so as to render the roof\r\nwater tight, by applying white lead to the joints. It can be afforded\r\nat 16 cents the square foot, and probably may be so far improved as to\r\ncost no more than slate, and will be much more permanent and safe. We\r\nsee no difficulty in dispensing with white lead, however, and making\r\nthe seams tight without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Improvement in the Railroad Track.=\r\n\r\nThis improvement was entered Sept. 5th, by John F. Rogers. What he\r\nclaims is the combination of the balance beam with the centre beam, by\r\nmeans of the recesses in the centre beam, spring plates, having tubes\r\nthereon on which the springs rest, and attached to the beam by bolts,\r\nby which a compact and secure connection is formed, while all the\r\nnecessary flexibility is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE GREAT FAIR.=\r\n\r\nThe American Institute appears emblematical of the genius of our\r\ncountrymen--unsubdued even by conflagration, and looking upon\r\nobstacles as incentives to redoubled effort. Contrast the smoking\r\nruins of Niblo's with Castle Garden, having its whole amphitheatre\r\nenriched with a tastefully arranged collection of the most varied\r\nproducts of American arts and manufactures, and behold an evidence\r\nthat we even inherit perseverance, enterprize and skill. We here see\r\nthe embodiment of the excellence of greatness of our country--an\r\nunerring index of our future advance--if it be not that the signs of\r\nthe times indicate that madness in our rulers which precedes and\r\nforebodes heaven's wrath. But it cannot, it must not be, that the\r\nblood of _labor_ shall cry from the ground of America. It must be\r\nsheathed, it must be protected. Protection is nature's first law.\r\nExpose the bleating flocks to the hungry beasts of the forest; cut the\r\nwings and pluck the feathers of her whom nature teaches to protect her\r\nbrood from cold and rain; say to the mother to leave her babe\r\nunprotected and in free competition with all the elements of\r\ndestruction, sooner than refuse the protection of our Government to\r\nthe hitherto flourishing American manufactures.\r\n\r\nCastle Garden, or more correctly Castle Clinton, is at the southern\r\nextremity of our city. It was built for a fort--is of a circular form,\r\nof solid mason work, surrounded by the waters of the bay--connected to\r\nthat ornament of the city, the Battery, by a long bridge. This bridge\r\nthe managers have covered with a roof, and thus secured a very\r\neligible and spacious apartment for the exhibition of carriages,\r\nsleighs, carts, farming implements and machinery in great variety.\r\nThence the ingress suddenly opens into view the whole interior,\r\ncreating the most lively and pleasing emotions.\r\n\r\nIn the columns of the Scientific American we shall endeavor to give\r\nthose details that will, we trust, interest our readers and promote\r\nthe cause of American improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n=BATHS.=\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the bridge, the passage way to the interior of the\r\nCastle is ornamented on both sides with a pleasing display of\r\nBaths--the immersion bath made of tin and of iron, and these combined\r\nwith the showering apparatus. The shower baths are variously\r\nconstructed, and some of them are of finished workmanship and costly\r\nmaterial. Stebbin's Patent Furniture shower Bath presents itself first\r\nin the form of a very convenient washstand, with all its out fit; it\r\nis next easily converted into a work stand; with equal dispatch it\r\nassumes the form of a shower bath, furnished with every requisite. We\r\nregard this as an ingenious piece of furniture, that will greatly\r\nincrease the use of the shower-bath, and thus add to the health of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SOFA BEDSTEADS.=\r\n\r\nMuch ingenuity has been expended in combining the Sofa and Bedstead.\r\nThe first that attracted our attention was that manufactured by Mr.\r\nJohn A. Robson, 30th st. and 8th Avenue. It is on the double cone\r\nspring, so constructed that using it as a bed does not affect the\r\ncushion, and vice versa. The matrass or bed is 4 by 6 feet, without an\r\nintervening bar. It is exceedingly simple, of admirable contrivance,\r\nand of moderate price.\r\n\r\n\r\n=CUTLERY.=\r\n\r\nThe display of American Cutlery is rich, affording a most gratifying\r\nevidence of the progress of the useful arts among us. Our neighbors,\r\nJ. C. Nixon & Sons, in the Sun Buildings, feel quite confident that\r\nthey will, as usual, carry off the premiums, particularly for their\r\nmuch celebrated tailor's shears. In the manufacture of engravers'\r\ntools; they challenge not only all America, but the world\r\nitself.--They manufacture for customers, from whom their articles have\r\nderived their just and solid reputation.\r\n\r\n(_To be Continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Improved Steam Printing Press.=\r\n\r\nWe have recently seen a model of a new Steam Printing Press, the\r\ninvention of Mr. Wm. W. Marston, a young and ingenious mechanic of\r\nthis city. A mass of other matters prevents our giving a description\r\nat present; we shall probably procure an engraving, however, and\r\npublish a full description in a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Information to persons having business to transact at the Patent\r\nOffice.=\r\n\r\nOF MODELS.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from No. 2._)\r\n\r\n\r\nSEC. 26. The law requires that the inventor shall deliver a model of\r\nhis invention or improvement when the same admits of a model. The\r\nmodel should he neatly made, and as small as a distinct representation\r\nof the machine or improvement, and its characteristic properties, will\r\nadmit; the name of the inventor should be printed or engraved upon, or\r\nfixed to it, in a durable manner. Models forwarded without a name,\r\ncannot be entered on record, and therefore liable to be lost or\r\nmislaid.\r\n\r\nSEC. 27. When the invention is of 'a composition of matter,' the law\r\nrequires that the application be accompanied with specimens of\r\ningredients, and of the composition of matter, sufficient in quantity\r\nfor the purpose of experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\nON GRANTING ANEW LOST PATENTS.\r\n\r\nSEC. 28. The third sec. of the act of March 3, 1837, provides:\r\n\r\n'SEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That whenever it shall appear to\r\nthe Commissioner that any patent was destroyed by the burning of the\r\nPatent Office building on the aforesaid fifteenth day of December, or\r\nwas otherwise lost prior thereto, it shall be his duty, on application\r\ntherefor by the patentee, or other persons interested therein, to\r\nissue a new patent for the same invention or discovery, bearing the\r\ndate of the original patent, with his certificate thereon, that it was\r\nmade and issued pursuant to the provisions of the third section of\r\nthis act; and shall enter the same of record; Provided, however, That\r\nbefore such patent shall be issued, the applicant therefor shall\r\ndeposit in the Patent Office a duplicate, as near as may be, of the\r\noriginal model, drawings, and description, with specification of the\r\ninvention or discovery, verified by oath, as it shall be required by\r\nthe Commissioner; and such patent and copies of such drawings and\r\ndescriptions, duly certified, shall be admissible as evidence in any\r\njudicial court of the United States, and shall protect the rights of\r\nthe patentee, his administrators, heirs, and assigns, to the extent\r\nonly in which they would have been protected by the original patent\r\nand specification.'\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS ON APPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS, AND ON APPEALS FROM DECISIONS\r\nOF THE COMMISSIONER.\r\n\r\n(Act of 1836, Section, 7.)\r\n\r\nSEC. 29. 'That on the filing of any such application (consisting of\r\npetition, specification, model, and drawings, or specimens,) and the\r\npayment of the duty hereinafter provided, the Commissioner shall make,\r\nor cause to be made, an examination, of the alleged new invention or\r\ndiscovery; and if, on any such examination, it shall not appear to the\r\nCommissioner that the same had been invented or discovered by any\r\nother person in this country prior to the alleged invention or\r\ndiscovery thereof by the applicant, or that it had been patented or\r\ndescribed in any printed publication in this or any foreign country,\r\nor had been in public use or on sale, with the applicant's consent or\r\nallowance, prior to the application, if the Commissioner shall deem it\r\nto be sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to\r\nissue a patent therefor. But whenever on such examination it shall\r\nappear to the Commissioner that the applicant was not the original and\r\nfirst inventor or discoverer thereof, or that any part of that which\r\nis claimed as new had before been invented or discovered or patented,\r\nor described in any printed publication in this or any foreign country\r\nas aforesaid, or that the description is defective and insufficient,\r\nhe shall notify the applicant thereof, giving him briefly such\r\ninformation and references as may be useful in judging of the\r\npropriety of renewing his application, or of altering his\r\nspecification to embrace only that part of the invention or discovery\r\nwhich is new. In every such case, if the applicant shall elect to\r\nwithdraw his application, relinquishing his claim to the model, he\r\nshall be entitled to receive back twenty dollars, part of the duty\r\nrequired by this act, on filing a notice in writing of such election\r\nin the Patent Office; a copy of which, certified by the Commissioner,\r\nshall be a sufficient warrant to the Treasurer for paying back to the\r\nsaid applicant the said sum of twenty dollars. But if the applicant,\r\nin such case, shall persist in his claim for a patent, with or without\r\nany alteration his specification, he shall be required to make oath or\r\naffirmation anew, in manner as aforesaid; and if specification and\r\nclaim shall not have been so modified as, in the opinion of the\r\nCommissioner, shall entitle the applicant to a patent, he may appeal\r\nto the Chief Justice of the United States Court for the District of\r\nColumbia, who may affirm or reverse the decision of the Commissioner\r\nof Patents, in whole or in part, and may order a patent to issue; or\r\nhe may have remedy against the decision of the Commissioner of\r\nPatents, or the decision of the Chief Justice of the United States\r\nCourt for the District of Columbia, by filing a bill in equity in any\r\nof the United States Courts having jurisdiction, as hereinafter\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n=Consolation for the Christian.=\r\n\r\n'Eye hath not seen; nor ear heard; neither have entered into the heart\r\nof man, the things which God hath prepared for those that love\r\nHim.'--1 Cor. ii: 9. But it is said in the words following, that God\r\nhath revealed them unto us by his Spirit. In this, we are not to\r\nunderstand, that the excellent things spoken of, are _communicated_ to\r\nmen; but that by the aid of the divine Spirit they are enabled to\r\nreceive such sublime and brilliant ideas of the glorious things which\r\nare prepared for them, that they are filled with sublime and\r\nunspeakable joy, though they find it utterly impracticable to\r\ndescribe these things to another, so as to be understood. It is like\r\nthe new name which no man can know, but him to whom it is given: and\r\nalthough, in the solicitude of those who have been favored with a view\r\nof these things, to represent them to others, the most full and\r\nexpressive forms of language have been put in requisition, it has in\r\nevery instance failed to convey the least correct idea on the subject:\r\nbecause no man can see, or in anywise appreciate the excellence of\r\nthese things, without the aid of the Spirit of Truth. But to those who\r\nobtain such enlightened views--and every man may, or might, obtain\r\nthem,--the glorious things prepared are as the 'pearl of great price,'\r\nwhich, when a man hath found, he is ready to sacrifice all things\r\nelse,--riches, honors, friends, pleasures, reputation in the world, or\r\neven life itself,--to obtain it. Neither Adam nor Eve, in their\r\nsinless, paradisaical state, could have had any correct idea of such\r\ndelectable and glorious excellence of blessings as are prepared for\r\nthese who become 'joint heirs of the Son of God,' through the blood of\r\na crucified Saviour: for, had they been capable of seeing or imagining\r\nsuch things, they would never have fallen. There can be no question\r\nbut that the glorious consolation of the faithful and obedient\r\nbelievers, will incomparably, not to say infinitely, excel that of the\r\nprimitive state of man, or anything which could have been by man\r\nattained, if the blessed SON had not suffered. Let the most brilliant\r\nand soaring imagination exert its most strenuous and happy efforts in\r\nconceiving, arranging and representing to itself the highest possible\r\nstate of bliss and glory, and it will fall as far short of the reality\r\nof the immortal state of the glorified saints,--the salvation\r\npurchased by the suffering of Christ,--as a mere shadow of the most\r\nbeautiful picture comes short of the rich coloring of the original.\r\nAnd this fact is well known to those who have had the beauties of the\r\n'world to come' revealed to them by the divine Spirit. These\r\nstatements may appear strange to those who are accustomed to look upon\r\nthe popular _reverend clergy_, fashionable church members and wealthy\r\ndeacons, as choice specimens of the saints of the Lord. The true, and\r\nmost favored saints, are generally found among those who are subject\r\nto poverty and tribulation, in this world. But these blessings of the\r\ngospel are free for all who will conform to the requisitions plainly\r\nexpressed by our Savior, and recorded by the evangelist, and\r\npracticable by all who are willing to forsake all things else, for the\r\nsake of this great and everlasting salvation.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nA cotton manufacturer in New-Haven lost his operatives, last week, by\r\nattempting to reduce their wages.\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE COLOR PRINTING MACHINE.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.--There have appeared, in modern times, but few machines,\r\nto which more importance apparently attaches, than to the one here\r\npresented. It is well known that the best paper hangings, or\r\nroom-papers command from $1 to $1,50 per piece, of eight yards, while\r\nmost of those of American manufacture are sold for 25 to 50 cents per\r\npiece; and this difference is occasioned by the difficulty and extra\r\nlabor of applying a great variety of different colors. But by means of\r\nthis machine, seven, twelve, or even twenty different colors, may be\r\naccurately applied by one operation, and with less labor than is\r\nrequired to print with a single color, by the ordinary method; and\r\nthus the manufacturer will be enabled to sell, for 50 cents, such\r\npatterns as ordinarily cost a dollar or more, to either import or\r\nmanufacture them.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.--The first row of gear wheels, A B, are attached to the\r\nends of a row of cylinders, each cylinder being 30 inches long, and 3\r\ninches in diameter. These cylinders support a broad, endless apron or\r\nbelt, which passes over the whole series, and supports the strip of\r\npaper as it passes through the machine to receive the colors. The\r\nsecond series of wheels, C D, are attached to cylinders of the same\r\ndimensions of those in the first row, and are connected to each other\r\nby intervening pinions, whereby a uniform velocity is maintained\r\nthrough the whole series. The peripheries of this row of cylinders are\r\ncut in figures, according to the design of the pattern to be worked.\r\nThe figures are left prominent, so as to come in contact with the\r\npaper upon the apron, as the cylinder revolves; the surface between\r\nthe figures, being cut away to the depth of one eighth of an inch.\r\nEach of these printing cylinders contains sections of the figures to\r\nbe printed, and is calculated to work a different color from the\r\nothers; and the sections of figures on each cylinder are calculated to\r\nmatch those of the others, so as to complete the entire figure in all\r\nits colors on the paper. The entire machine is put in operation by a\r\nband, passing over the band-wheel, H. The third row of cylinders, E F,\r\nare distributing cylinders, which are put in motion by mere contact\r\nwith the series below, and receives the several colors from the small\r\ncylinders in the upper rows, and distributes the same upon the\r\nprominent figures of the printing cylinders. The fourth series, I J,\r\nare called the receiving cylinders, because they receive the colors\r\nfrom the hoppers or reservoirs, M N, and impart them to the series\r\nbelow. The cylinders of the third and fourth rows, are covered with\r\ncloth, and the bottom of each hopper is so nicely fitted to its\r\nrespective cylinder, that but a small quantity of each color (which\r\npasses through an aperture at the bottom of the hopper) adheres to the\r\ncloth periphery of the cylinder. The colors ordinarily used consist of\r\nvarious pigments, ground and mixed in water, with a solution of glue.\r\nThe principles of this mode of color printing have been satisfactorily\r\ntested, though the entire machine has not yet been constructed: and\r\nany person who may be disposed to construct and enjoy the exclusive\r\nuse of this invention, may have the most favorable terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n=A New Brick Machine.=\r\n\r\nMessrs. Culbertson, McMillen & Co. of Cincinnati, have recently put in\r\nsuccessful operation, a new machine, a description of which is given\r\nin a Cincinnati paper, as follows:\r\n\r\n'A frame of fourteen moulds, one brick to each is drawn by the power\r\nof steam between two press rollers, the lower one of which enables the\r\nframe to support the pressure of the upper roller, and being run\r\nthrough backwards and forwards equalizes the pressure over the entire\r\nface of the brick. These, after undergoing in this mode a pressure of\r\nnearly one hundred tons to each brick, a pressure which covers clay,\r\napparently perfectly dry, with a coat of glossy moisture, are raised\r\nabove the surface of the mould by parallel levers, and are then\r\ndelivered over to a bench or table by self-acting machinery, whence\r\nthey are taken in barrows to the stacker at the kiln.\r\n\r\nThe dry clay is shoveled into a hopper, and if more of the material is\r\npressed into a mould than serves to make a brick, a knife which ranges\r\nwith the surface of the mould, shaves off the surplus.\r\n\r\nTwo hands shoveling, two more taking off, and one at the barrow,\r\nconstitute a gang of five persons who turn out from 30,000 to 35,000\r\nper day of ten hours. As brick makers' days are from sun to sun, say\r\ntwelve working hours per day, during the season, from 46 to 50,000\r\nbricks, per day, may be made by a single machine. This is, however, by\r\nno means the most important feature in the invention.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary mode of making bricks, the manufacturer cannot begin\r\noperations for the season, until the spring has so far advanced that\r\nworking in wet clay will no longer chill his moulders' hands. On the\r\nsame account, he loses also morning hours, until the advance of summer\r\nenables his hands to put in the whole period of daylight. He loses,\r\nalso, sometimes days together--from the entire stoppage of his\r\noperations in the rainy weather, which forbids the bricks being put\r\nout to dry. In making press brick, all these difficulties are\r\nobviated. As a theory, operations in this mode can go on throughout\r\nthe entire winter, frost never extending into solid clay; but as a\r\npractical business, it can be conveniently carried on two months\r\nearlier and one month later than in the ordinary mode. Pressed brick,\r\nmade by these machines, are also stronger than their competitive\r\narticle, the last of equal hardness in burning, always giving way\r\nwhen struck by the pressed bricks, as I have witnessed. Indeed, it\r\ncannot be otherwise, the one being porous and the other as compact as\r\nthe enormous pressure employed can make it.\r\n\r\nThe machine, it must be apparent, offers peculiar advantages in\r\nturning out brick without occupying the ordinary brick yard space\r\nnecessary for spreading wet brick out to dry. It affords great economy\r\nin time, owing to its operations being independent of frost or rains.\r\nTo every new and thriving place commencing the making of bricks, it\r\ndispenses with the necessity of bringing skilful workmen from other\r\nplaces--in short, it enables every man to be his own brick-maker.\r\nUnder these considerations, I anticipate an extensive sale of these\r\nmachines, especially for places at a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Marble Saw Mills.=\r\n\r\nWe are informed that a large mill for sawing marble is in course of\r\nerection at Brandon, Vt. The marble in that vicinity is principally of\r\na beautiful white, and of a fine texture, though not very hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Railroad Locks.=\r\n\r\nIt is reported that locks for elevating railroad trains, from one\r\nlevel to another, are coming into successful use in France. It appears\r\nto us to be much behind the age, since, by certain American\r\ninventions, an ordinary train may be elevated 100 feet in five\r\nminutes, by the engine alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Vertical Propeller.]\r\n\r\nWe have alluded to this subject in a former number, and now present\r\none of the several plans which have been introduced within the present\r\nyear, although we are not fully authorised to give the name of the\r\ninventor of this particular plan. We have preferred to represent the\r\npaddles and crank unconnected with an apparent vessel or section\r\nthereof, but must require the reader to suppose that the line A B is\r\nthe level of the railing of the boat, and that the crank-shaft E\r\nprojects from the side, while the crank-pivot governs the motion of\r\nthe walking bar D E, and with it the paddles, which are supposed to be\r\njust now dipping in the surface of the water. It will be understood\r\nthat the motion of the walking bar being circular, and that of the\r\nheads of the paddles being vertical and nearly rectilinear, the motion\r\nof the blades of the paddles must be elliptical, inclining to the\r\nhorizontal; and that the position of the paddles is kept so nearly\r\nvertical that they will meet with less resistance in entering or\r\nleaving the water than those of a common paddle wheel, while the\r\natmospheric resistance to be encountered thereby is much less. There\r\nappears no reasonable doubt that this plan might be made to succeed\r\nwell on a larger scale, though it is very doubtful whether any of the\r\nsteamboat proprietors can be persuaded to adopt it until it has been\r\nmore thoroughly tested by experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Great Astronomical Discovery.=\r\n\r\nA late number of an astronomical journal published at Altona, near\r\nHamburg, contains a long article by Dr. Maedler, director of the\r\nDorpat Observatory, Russia, well known to the astronomical world, in\r\nwhich he announces the extraordinary discovery of the _grand central\r\nstar or sun_, about which the universe of stars is revolving, our own\r\nsun and system among the rest.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, the result of many years of incessant toil and\r\nresearch, has been deduced by a train of reasoning and an examination\r\nof facts scarcely to be surpassed in the annals of science.\r\n\r\nHe announces his discovery in the following language: 'I therefore\r\npronounce the Pleiades to be the central group of that mass of fixed\r\nstars limited by the stratum composing the Milky Way and Alcyene as\r\nthe individual star of this group, which, among all others, combines\r\nthe greatest probability of being the true Central Sun.'\r\n\r\nBy a train of reasoning, which I shall not attempt to explain, he\r\nfinds the probable parallax of this great central star to be six\r\nthousandths of one second of arc, and its distance to be 34 millions\r\nof times the distance of the sun, or so remote that light, with a\r\nvelocity of 12 millions of miles per minute, requires a period of 537\r\nyears to pass from _the great centre_ to our sun.\r\n\r\nAs a first rough approximation, he deduces the period of the\r\nrevolution of our sun, with all its train of planets, satellites and\r\ncomets, about the grand centre, to be _eighteen millions two hundred\r\nthousand years_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ocean Steam Navigation.=\r\n\r\nThe 'Ocean Steam Company,' which has the patronage of the United\r\nStates Government to the amount of $400,000 per annum, are getting on\r\nrapidly with the first steamship of their line. She is to be completed\r\nand commence running on the first of March next.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, OCTOBER 10, 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Employment.=\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous for a man of superior ability to find himself thrown\r\nupon the world without some regular employment. The restlessness\r\ninherent in genius, being thus undirected by any permanent influence,\r\nframes for itself occupations out of accidents. Moral integrity\r\nsometimes falls a prey to the want of a fixed pursuit, and the man who\r\nreceives his direction in active life from the fortuitous impulse of\r\ncircumstances, will be very apt to receive his principles likewise\r\nfrom chance. Genius, under such guidance, attains no noble ends, but\r\nresembles rather a copious spring conveyed in a falling aqueduct,\r\nwhere the waters continually escape through the frequent crevices, and\r\nwaste themselves ineffectually on their passage. The law of nature is\r\nhere, as elsewhere, binding, and no powerful results ever ensue from\r\nthe trivial exercise of high endowments. The finest mind, when thus\r\ndestitute of a fixed purpose, passes away without leaving permanent\r\ntraces of its existence; losing its energy by turning aside from its\r\ncourse, it becomes as harmless and inefficient as the lightning,\r\nwhich, of itself irresistible, may yet be rendered powerless by a\r\nslight conductor.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Editor.=\r\n\r\nWrite--keep writing--is the motto of an editor. If he has no ideas, he\r\nmust dig for them; if he has but little time to arrange them, no\r\nmatter, the work must be done. Sickness may come upon him; want may\r\nstare him in the face, but he must cogitate something for the dear\r\npublic. Perhaps in his darkest moments, he indites a paragraph that\r\ncheers thousands. When almost desponding, his words may put courage\r\ninto the hearts of millions. Who would be an editor? Yet he has much\r\nto encourage him. If he can call no time his own, he is not rusting\r\nout, or in unprofitable society. A faithful contributor of the public\r\npress, is a man of great influence. No person has more power than\r\nhimself. He instructs tens of thousands, and leads them to virtue, to\r\nhonor, to happiness. No man will have more to answer for than the\r\nconductor of a corrupt and vacillating press.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Mountain in Labor.=\r\n\r\nThe workmen, says a Paris paper, are still busily engaged in\r\nexcavating Montmarte in quest of holy vases and other riches said to\r\nhave been deposited there in the early days of the French revolution\r\nby the orders of the Lady Superior of the Abbey of Montmarte.--Two\r\nworkmen, who were at the time charged with transporting the wealth to\r\nthe place designated, were never after seen, and it is supposed that\r\nthey were sacrificed to the necessity of the secret. The Superior, at\r\nher death, bequeathed the secret to a lady friend, who, in turn, on\r\nher death bed, divulged it to her daughter, then thirteen years of\r\nage. The child, now a sexagenary, disclosed it to the municipality.\r\nHer statements have thus far been found scrupulously correct. The\r\n_cesarian_ operation is actively going on, an excavation of 50 feet\r\nhaving been made, and the mountain's speedy deliverance of a mine of\r\nwealth is anticipated. May it not prove a mouse!\r\n\r\n\r\n=That Editorial Committee.=\r\n\r\nWe are informed that the Editorial Committee of the National\r\nAssociation of Inventors have by _their own request_ been discharged\r\nfrom the supervision of the new periodical which has recently appeared\r\nunder the title of 'The Eureka.'\r\n\r\n\r\n=News by Telegraph.=\r\n\r\nThe news by the Great Western which arrived on Wednesday week, was\r\npublished within four hours in Boston, New Haven, Springfield, Albany,\r\nUtica, Rochester, Buffalo, Philadelphia and Baltimore.\r\n\r\nThe following beautiful extract we find in a recent number of the New\r\nYork Sun. It is from the pen of Mr. C. D. Stuart, the able\r\ncorrespondent of that paper, now in London.\r\n\r\n      \"On remarking to an Englishman, that I did not see\r\n      here in London as at home, the artizan, the drayman,\r\n      the laborer of every kind, with a newspaper in his\r\n      pocket, which at intervals in his toil he could glance\r\n      at and be as learned in the condition of his country\r\n      and the world as the man of fortune, he replied--\"No,\r\n      they have something better to do, they attend to their\r\n      work.\" Here lies the rub, and it may be a fear of the\r\n      sedition of thought that has put these close hampers\r\n      upon the English press. It would seem by such an\r\n      argument that the differences of condition are not\r\n      induced by unholy oppressions, by the trampling for\r\n      ages of one class upon another until servitude became\r\n      almost a birth-right--and the law of strength that\r\n      proved itself in barbarous times the \"Supremacy\" had\r\n      at last from concession so long made, become the law\r\n      of human justice and divine right. The steer may work\r\n      under his yoke an appointed time, the slave bow mutely\r\n      through his whole life, but the freeman--has he so\r\n      fallen, that while the lord revels in his \"club-room\"\r\n      and reads not only papers, but gilt edged and velvet\r\n      bound books, he forsooth being a common \"poor devil\"\r\n      not able to enjoy a tithe of his unearned luxury--has\r\n      something better than reading to do. Let him dig\r\n      then! There are those in the young republic whose\r\n      spirit begins to animate the world, who, though they\r\n      toil, remember, that it was said in the beginning to\r\n      all men, \"thou shalt earn thy bread by the sweat of\r\n      thy brow,\" and will read freely as they drink in the\r\n      common air, and enjoy the common light. There are\r\n      classes in England intelligent no doubt beyond any\r\n      other people in the world--classes that enjoy the\r\n      means of making themselves so, but as a mass they will\r\n      in no-wise compare with their progeny, the\r\n      Anglo-Saxons. All that they have here in the main we\r\n      have got, and our wits have not been blunted by a\r\n      contact with the wilderness, and the difficulties of\r\n      founding an empire \"in the Woods.\" I see now more\r\n      clearly than ever where our faults lie; contrast\r\n      exposes them; but they are all twigs upon the rising\r\n      trunk, which the keen knife of national experience,\r\n      age, and the calm that must succeed the rush and\r\n      tumult of our giant and boisterous infancy will cut\r\n      off.--With greater pride than ever, however much I may\r\n      like the Old World, and especially England, I look\r\n      over the Ocean to America for an exemplification of\r\n      what the world has not known, an _Earthly_ paradise\r\n      for humanity.--It is but three quarters of a century,\r\n      remember, since we were nationally born: give as the\r\n      fourteen hundred years that have nursed and cultivated\r\n      this Island, and where is the limit of our perfection\r\n      and strength? On either side of that Mississippi\r\n      back-bone of ours to the Oceans, and as far north and\r\n      south as freedom and knowledge can pierce, America\r\n      must be a garden and a goal, filled with every\r\n      excellence and beauty, beyond which there can be no\r\n      advance. We shall not live to see it, but it will\r\n      come, only let us pull careful and steady. We have\r\n      been Dickens'd and Trollop'd, and it should do us\r\n      good. Nothing but the grandeur that lies germinating\r\n      in our heart provokes this idle spleen from our\r\n      neighbors, and the moment we cool down and think and\r\n      curb ourselves the rest is secure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Glass Factory.=\r\n\r\nErastus Corning & Co. are about establishing a factory near the ferry\r\nat Troy, for the manufacture of all kinds of glass ware. The work is\r\nfast progressing, and in about four weeks they will commence blowing.\r\nIt will afford employment to a large number of men, and will, no\r\ndoubt, meet with that success which it certainly merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Result of Observation.=\r\n\r\nThe editor of the New Haven Herald sets it down as a fact in natural\r\nhistory, proved by his experience for years, that when a traveller\r\nrides up to a toll gate, the keeper--if a man, invariably brings out a\r\nbox, or a handful of change; but if a woman, she comes out and takes\r\nthe traveller's coin, and then goes back for the change.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nSnags and other obstructions in the Western rivers, are now\r\ndenominated _Polk stalks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Science of Astronomy.=\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nMercury, the nearest planet to the sun, is a globe of about 3140 miles\r\nin diameter, rotating on its axis in 24 hours and 5 1-2 minutes, and\r\nrevolving round the central luminary, at a distance of 37,000,000 of\r\nmiles, in 88 days.--From the earth it can only be seen occasionally in\r\nthe morning or evening, as it never rises before, or sets after the\r\nsun, at a greater distance of the time than 1 hour and 50 minutes. It\r\nappears to the naked eye as a small and brilliant star, but when\r\nobserved through a telescope, is horned like the moon, because we only\r\nsee a part of the surface which the sun is illuminating. Mountains of\r\ngreat height have been observed on the surface of this planet,\r\nparticularly in its lower or southern hemisphere. One has been\r\ncalculated at 10 3-4 miles in height, being about eight times higher,\r\nin proportion to the bulk of the planet, than the loftiest mountains\r\nupon earth. The matter of Mercury is of much greater density than that\r\nof the earth, equalling lead in weight; so that a human being placed\r\nupon its surface would be so strongly drawn towards the ground as\r\nscarcely to be able to crawl.\r\n\r\nVenus is a globe of about 7800 miles in diameter, or nearly the size\r\nof the earth, rotating on its axis in 23 hours, 21 minutes, and 19\r\nseconds, and revolving round the sun, at the distance of 68,000,000 of\r\nmiles in 225 days.--Like Mercury, it is visible to an observer on the\r\nearth only in the morning and evening, but for a greater space of time\r\nbefore sunrise and after sunset. It appears to us the most brilliant\r\nand beautiful of all the planetary and stellar bodies, occasionally\r\ngiving so much light as to produce a sensible shadow. Observed through\r\na telescope, it appears horned, on account of our seeing only a part\r\nof its luminous surface. The illuminating part of Venus occasionally\r\npresents slight spots. It has been ascertained that its surface is\r\nvery unequal, the greatest mountains being in the southern hemisphere,\r\nas in the case of both Mercury and the Earth. The higher mountains in\r\nVenus range between 10 and 22 miles in altitude. The planet is also\r\nenveloped in an atmosphere like that by which animal and vegetable\r\nlife is supported on earth; and it has consequently a twilight. Venus\r\nperforms its revolution round the sun in 225 days. Mercury and Venus\r\nhave been termed the Inferior Planets, as being placed within the\r\norbit of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Earth, the third planet in order, and one of the smaller size,\r\nthough not the smallest, is important to us, as the theatre on which\r\nour race have been placed to 'live, move, and have their being.' It is\r\n7902 miles in mean diameter, rotating on its axis in 24 hours, at a\r\nmean distance of 95,000,000 of miles from the sun, round which it\r\nrevolves in 365 days, 5 hours, 50 minutes, and 57 seconds. As a planet\r\nviewed from another of the planets, suppose the moon, 'It would\r\npresent a pretty, variegated, and sometimes a mottled appearance. The\r\ndistinction between its seas, oceans, continents, and islands, would\r\nbe clearly marked; they would appear like brighter and darker spots\r\nupon its disc. The continents would appear bright, and the ocean of a\r\ndarker hue, because water absorbs the greater part of the solar light\r\nthat falls upon it. The level plains, (excepting perhaps, such regions\r\nas the Arabian deserts of sand) would appear of a somewhat darker\r\ncolor than the more elevated and mountainous regions, as we find to be\r\nthe case on the surface of the moon. The islands would appear like\r\nsmall bright specks on the darker surface of the ocean; and the lakes\r\nand mediterranean seas like darker spots or broad streaks intersecting\r\nthe bright parts, or the land. By its revolution round its axis,\r\nsuccessive portions of the surface would be brought into view, and\r\npresent a different aspect from the parts which preceded,'--(Dick's\r\nCelestial Scenery, 135.)\r\n\r\nThe form of the earth, and probably that of every other planet, is not\r\nstrictly spheroidal; that is, flattened a little at the poles, or\r\nextremities of the axis. The diameter of the earth at the axis is 56\r\nmiles less than in the cross direction. This peculiarity of the form\r\nis a consequence of the rotatory motion, as will be afterwards\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATEST NEWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Late Foreign News.=\r\n\r\nThe steamer Hibernia arrived at Boston on Saturday last, thirteen days\r\nfrom Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe British Government and people have manifested so much violent\r\nopposition to the marriage of the youngest son of Louis Phillipe to a\r\nsister of the Queen of Spain, that the celebration of the nuptials has\r\nbeen postponed for the present, if not forever; and there is apparent\r\ndanger of a rupture between England and France on this account.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, Don Carlos having escaped from imprisonment, it is expected\r\nthat a serious insurrection will immediately take place.\r\n\r\nProperty to the amount of $800,000 has been destroyed by incendiary\r\nfires at Leipsic.

Armijo had\r\nassembled 5000 troops to defend the Canon Pass, but on account of the\r\ndisaffection and insubordination of his officers and men, he was\r\nconstrained to retreat on the approach of a few companies of\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nGen.

What can we do? The Mexicans will\r\nneither treat nor fight; and although our armies move as slow as\r\npossible, they cannot well avoid progressing through the country in\r\ntime, and are bound to furnish protection as far as they go.

J. L. SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe great difference existing between metallurgical operations of the\r\npresent day, and those of a former period, is owing chiefly to the\r\nameliorations produced by the application of the science of chemistry\r\nto the _modus operandi_ of the various changes taking place during the\r\noperations, from their commencement to their termination.\r\n\r\nCopper and some other metals are now made to assume forms in the\r\nchemist's laboratory, that formerly required great artistical skill\r\nfor their production--the chemist simply making use of such agents and\r\nforces as are at his command, and over which he has, by close\r\nanalytical study, acquired perfect control. Our object, at present, is\r\nonly to advert to the chemical investigations more recently made on\r\nthe manufacture of iron, treating of those changes that occur in the\r\nore, coal and flux, that are thrown in at the mouth of the furnace,\r\nand in the air thrown in from below. For most that will be said on\r\nthis subject, we are principally indebted to the recent interesting\r\nresearches of M. Ebelman.\r\n\r\nThe importance of a knowledge of the facts to be brought forward, in\r\nthis article, will be apparent to every one in any way acquainted with\r\nthe manufacture of iron. It will be seen that the time is not far\r\ndistant when the economy in the article of fuel will amount in value\r\nto the present profit of many of the works. The consequences must be,\r\nthat many of those works that are abandoned will be resumed, and\r\nothers erected in localities formerly thought unfit.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the blast furnace is the first into which the\r\nore is introduced, for the purpose of converting it into malleable\r\niron, and much, therefore, depends upon the state in which the pig\r\nmetal passes from this furnace, whether subsequent operations will\r\nfurnish an iron of the first quality or not.\r\n\r\nIn putting the blast furnace into operation, the first step is to heat\r\nit for some time with coal only. After the furnace has arrived at a\r\nproper temperature, ore, fuel and flux, are thrown in alternately, in\r\nsmall quantities, so as to have the three ingredients properly mixed\r\nin their descent. In from 25 to 48 hours from the time when the ore is\r\nfirst thrown in, the entire capacity of the furnace, from the tuyer to\r\nthe mouth, is occupied with the ore, fuel and flux, in their various\r\nstages of transformation.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain clearly, and in as short space as possible, what\r\nthese transformations are, and how they are brought about, we may\r\nconsider:--1. The changes that take place in the descending mass,\r\ncomposed of ore, fuel and flux. 2. The changes that take place in the\r\nascending mass, composed of air and its hygrometric moisture, thrown\r\nin at the tuyer. 3. The chemical action going on between the ascending\r\nand descending masses. 4. The composition of the gases in various\r\nparts of the furnace during its operation. 5. The causes that render\r\nnecessary the great heat of the blast furnace.\r\n\r\n1. _Changes that take place in the descending mass, composed of ore,\r\ncoal and flux._--By coal is here meant charcoal; when any other\r\nspecies of fuel is alluded to, it will be specified. In the upper half\r\nof the fire-room the materials are subjected to a comparatively low\r\ntemperature, and they lose only the moisture, volatile matter,\r\nhydrogen, and carbonic acid, that they may contain; this change taking\r\nplace principally in the lower part of the upper half of the\r\nfire-room.\r\n\r\nIn the lower half of the fire-room, the ore is the only material that\r\nundergoes a change, it being converted wholly or in part into iron or\r\nmagnetic oxide of iron--the coal is not altered, no consumption of it\r\ntaking place from the mouth down to the commencement of the boshes.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the boshes down to the tuyer, the reduction\r\nof the ore is completed. Very little of the coal is consumed between\r\nthe boshes and in the upper part of the hearth; the principal\r\nconsumption of it taking place in the immediate neighborhood of the\r\ntuyer.\r\n\r\nThe fusion of the iron and slag occurs at a short distance above the\r\ntuyer, and it is in the hearth of the furnace that the iron combines\r\nwith a portion of coal to form the fusible carburet or pig-iron. It is\r\nalso on the hearth that the flux combines with the siliceous and other\r\nimpurities of the ore. This concludes the changes which the ore, coal\r\nand flux, undergo, from the mouth of the furnace to the tuyer.\r\n\r\nIf the fuel used be wood, or partly wood, it is during its passage\r\nthrough the upper half of the fire-room that its volatile parts are\r\nlost, and it becomes converted into charcoal. M. Ebelman ascertained\r\nthat wood, at the depth of ten feet, in a fire-room twenty-six feet\r\nhigh, preserved its appearance after an exposure for 1 3-4 of an hour,\r\nand that the mineral mixed with it preserved its moisture at this\r\ndepth; but three and a half feet lower, an exposure of 3 1-4 hours\r\nreduced the wood to perfect charcoal, and the ore to magnetic oxide.\r\nThe temperature of the upper half of the fire-room, when wood is used,\r\nis lower than in the case of charcoal, from the great amount of heat\r\nmade latent by the vapor arising from the wood. In the case of\r\nbituminous coal, Bunsen and Playfair find that it has to descend still\r\nlower before it is perfectly coked.\r\n\r\nAfter the wood is completely charred, or the coal become coked, the\r\nsubsequent changes are the same that happen in the charcoal furnaces.\r\n\r\n_To be continued._\r\n\r\n\r\n=ANIMALCULAE IN WATER.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nThe fact is generally known that nearly all liquids contain a variety\r\nof minute living animals, though in some they are too small for\r\nobservation, even with a microscope. In others, especially in water\r\nthat has been long stagnant, these animals appear not only in hideous\r\nforms, but with malignant and voracious propensities. The print at the\r\nhead of this article purports to be a microscopic representation of a\r\nsingle drop of such water, with the various animals therein, and some\r\nof the inventors and venders of the various improved filters for the\r\nCroton water, would have no objection to the prevalence of the opinion\r\nthat this water contains all the variety of monsters represented in\r\nthis cut. But the fact is far otherwise; and it is doubtful whether\r\nthese animals could frequently be detected in the Croton water, with\r\nthe best solar microscope. Nevertheless, the fact is readily and\r\nclearly established that the Croton water contains a quantity of\r\ndeleterious matter, which is arrested by the filters; and, on this\r\naccount, we cheerfully and heartily recommend the adoption of filters\r\nby all who use this water, from either the public or private hydrants.\r\nTo this end we would call the special attention of our city readers to\r\nthe improved filters noticed under the head of \"New Inventions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Length of Days.=\r\n\r\nAt Berlin and London the longest day has sixteen and a half hours. At\r\nStockholm and Upsal, the longest has eighteen and a half hours, and\r\nthe shortest five and a half. At Hamburg, Dantzic, and Stettin, the\r\nlongest day has seventeen hours, and the shortest seven. At St.\r\nPetersburg and Tobolsk, the longest has nineteen, and the shortest\r\nfive hours. At Toreno, in Finland, the longest day has twenty-one\r\nhours and a half, and the shortest two and a half. At Wandorbus, in\r\nNorway, the day lasts from the 21st of May to the 22d of July, without\r\ninterruption; and in Spitzbergen, the longest day lasts three months\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Excitement of Curiosity.=\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer, having been one of a recent\r\nexcursion party on the opening of a new section of railroad, remarks\r\non the occasion, 'It is really amusing to see the sensation a train of\r\nrailroad cars produces on all animate beings, human and brute, for the\r\nfirst few times it passes over a section of road. We saw herds of\r\ncattle, sheep, and horses, stand for a few seconds and gaze at the\r\npassing train, then turn and run for a few rods with all possible\r\nspeed, stop and look again with eyes distended, and head and ears\r\nerect, seemingly so frightened at the tramp of the iron horse as to\r\nhave lost the power of locomotion. Men women and children also seemed\r\ndumbfounded at the strange and unusual spectacle. As the cars came\r\nrumbling along early in the morning, they seemed to bring everybody\r\nout of bed, all eager to catch a glance as we whirled past. Old men\r\nand women, middle-aged and youth, without waiting to put on a rag in\r\naddition to their night gear, were seen at the doors, windows and\r\nround the corners of log huts and dwellings, gaping with wonder and\r\nastonishment at the new, and to them grand and terrific sight.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[COMMUNICATED.]\r\n\r\nAt the last special meeting of the National Association of Inventors,\r\ncalled to hear the report on the rights and duties of the Editors of\r\nthe Eureka, on a resolution offered by one of the Editorial Committee\r\nwho had been dissatisfied by the proceedings of the 'Acting Editors,'\r\nand refused to attend their sittings, it was reported that the 'Acting\r\nEditors,' had exceeded their authority, and a majority of the\r\nEditorial Committee resigned and a resolution was passed that the\r\nresignation should be published in the Eureka, but it has not\r\nappeared. Mr. Kingsley, one of the 'Acting Editors,' spoke at the said\r\nmeeting of having consulted counsel who had declared that the\r\nAssociation were under a legal obligation to furnish Messrs. Kingley &\r\nPirsson with matter for publication in the Eureka, and on the\r\nunderstanding that they had advanced money they were allowed to have\r\nthe first use of the reports and advertisements of the Association.\r\nBut as they in effect refuse to publish a resolution of great\r\nimportance to the reputation of all the parties interested, it is\r\nleft for the public to decide whether the 'Acting Editors' are in any\r\nrespect entitled to the name they have assumed for their paper.\r\n\r\nONE OF THE EDITORIAL COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMOROUS.\r\n\r\n=To my Sweetheart.=\r\n\r\n      You're a broth of creature,\r\n      In form and in feature,--\r\n    It's myself that now tells you that same,\r\n      And sure, by my troth,\r\n      I'll not be very wroth.\r\n    If you'll plaze me by changing your name\r\n\r\n      What a swate little wife,\r\n      As a partner for life,\r\n    My darlint, 'tis you might be living;\r\n      And I'm just the boy,\r\n      To wish you much joy,\r\n    When your heart it's to me you'll be giving.\r\n\r\n      I'm half dead--botheration!\r\n      With sad consternation--\r\n    Of your flirting it is that I'm speaking;\r\n      So plaze to be thinking,\r\n      When you're winking and blinking.\r\n    It's my own honest heart that you're braking.\r\n\r\n      The divil a haper,\r\n      Will I stand of a caper,--\r\n    'Twould kill me to find you deceiving;\r\n      By my sowl and I'd die,\r\n      And that same is no lie,\r\n    Before I'd be kilt by me grieving.\r\n\r\n      Then spake but the word.\r\n      My nate little bird,\r\n    That you're niver a man's but mine;\r\n      And straight to the praist,\r\n      It's myself that'll haste,\r\n    To make you my _swate waluntine_!\r\n\r\n                        [_Teddy Magowan._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boys and Men.=\r\n\r\nA youthful volunteer, the other day, out in Arkansas, was taunting a\r\nmarried gentleman, who had a wife and three small children depending\r\nupon him, for not rallying to the standard of his country, soon after\r\nthe requisition upon that State arrived. 'Tom,' said our friend, 'you\r\n_boys_ can whip the Mexicans, but should old England take a hand in\r\nthe pie, _I'll_ join, for it will require _men_ to whip the English.'\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trusting too Long.=\r\n\r\nWe recollect that a weekly paper was started, some years ago, in one\r\nof the Western States, the terms of which were $2,50 in advance, $3 at\r\nthe end of the year--to which the editor jocosely added in a\r\nparagraph, 'and $5 if never paid.' We think that most of his\r\nsubscribers took the paper upon the latter terms, since it has been\r\nnon est. He played a joke upon himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Business Stand.=\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, being about to remove his shop, his landlord inquired the\r\nreason, stating, at the time, that it was considered a very good\r\nstand for business. He replied, with a shrug of the shoulders, \"Oh,\r\nyes, he's very good stand for de businis; by gar, me stan' all day,\r\nfor nobody come to make me _move_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plain Directions.=\r\n\r\nRepresent me in my portrait, said a gentleman to his painter, with a\r\nbook in my hand reading aloud.

No person who carefully\r\nexamines the subject, can fail of seeing that the cause of justice and\r\nequity, as well as the advance of improvement, would be promoted by\r\nthe substitution of the principles therein expressed, in place of some\r\nof those embraced in the existing patent laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"We advance the principle, which may be novel to some, that if the\r\ninventor apply genius, time, toil, and capital, to produce anything he\r\nmay consider valuable, he has the same right to the exclusive use and\r\nenjoyment of it as the man who may apply time, and toil, and capital,\r\nwithout genius. That the application of genius does not divest him of\r\nany right enjoyed by all others in society.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the creations of genius are sometimes intangible, but that\r\nis no objection; all rights are abstractions, until embodied in\r\nconstitutions and laws, and rendered practical by penalties.\r\n\r\nIf an inventor can define the limits of his claim, he is entitled to\r\nprotection in it just the same as when a deed is put on record,\r\nlimiting the boundaries of a lot of ground. All rights to real\r\nproperty are traced back to original discovery and occupancy, and now\r\nall the inventor desires, or nearly all, in any patent law, is a\r\nsimple registry, just as we find in our Halls of Record. The\r\nCommissioner of Patents should be called the Register of Patents.\r\nIndeed, grants of land, as they are termed, have frequently been\r\nregistered by the name of patents, in our Halls of Records, so strong\r\nis the analogy, if not perfect similarity.\r\n\r\nThen what should be the Patent Law? We answer, by sections, at once.\r\nThe first should be declaratory of the rights of inventors, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nSEC. 1. The application of capital, time, skill and ingenuity, to the\r\nproduction of new and useful discoveries, shall be protected under the\r\n5th article of the Amendments to the Constitution, which forbids\r\nprivate use without the consent of the owner, and for public use\r\nwithout just compensation.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2. Should any invention or discovery be deemed of great\r\nimportance to the general prosperity, its value shall he appraised on\r\nthe requisition of the Secretary of State, which value, which\r\nascertained, as hereinafter provided, shall be paid to the inventor\r\nfrom the Treasury of the United States, and, until this payment shall\r\ntake place, the discovery of any inventor duly qualified to take out a\r\npatent, shall remain his property, and inalienable without his consent\r\nor the consent of his legal representatives.\r\n\r\nSEC. 3. Any inventor or discoverer who may desire a patent for any\r\ndiscovery of his own, shall make oath or solemnly affirm thereto, and\r\nany specification, drawing or model, he may see fit to deposit with\r\nthe Register of Patents, shall be received by him and recorded, as a\r\nmatter of evidence of original right.\r\n\r\nSEC. 4. There shall be no salaried Examiners of Patents, but each\r\npatentee may contract on any terms he may see fit with any Patent\r\nAgent or Examiner, to examine the Records of the Patent office, on the\r\npayment of ten dollars fee for the use of the books and privilege of\r\nthe Patent Office, and no more fees than this first $10 shall be\r\ncharged on any single patent, excepting five dollars each for every\r\nrecord of transfer of rights or parts of rights. Nor shall the fees be\r\nraised until it may be discovered that they will not support the\r\nexpenses of the Patent Office. And it is provided, no expenses for the\r\nimprovement of agriculture, or any purpose foreign to the business of\r\nthe registry of Patents, and the necessary books and buildings, and\r\nsalaries of the register, librarian and two clerks and door-keeper,\r\nshall be charged upon the Patent Fund.\r\n\r\nSEC. 5. The Commissioner of Patents shall give advice of a scientific\r\nand legal character as he may be desired and qualified to do, to\r\ninventors. He may guaranty the originality of any invention at his own\r\nrisk, at any price be may agree upon with any inventor to give\r\ncertificates thereof, and this shall not interfere with his regular\r\nsalary. But it is provided that the Commissioner shall not in any\r\nmanner prevent others from examining and guarantying the originality\r\nof any invention for which a patent may be desired. And it is also\r\nprovided that any Commissioner, Register, Clerk, Attorney, Examiner or\r\nAgent, who may give a guaranty or warrant of the novelty of any\r\ninvention shall be held responsible in costs on any information to be\r\nfiled by any party who may feel himself aggrieved, to rescind the\r\npatent which may not be an original invention of the claimant so\r\nguarantied.\r\n\r\nSEC. 6. To rescind a patent, any party feeling himself aggrieved may\r\nfile information in the District Court of the United States, of the\r\ndistrict in which the patentee resides, notifying the patentee of such\r\ninformation filed, with what the former intends to prove, and where\r\nthe patentee may discover the evidence relied upon by the informer, on\r\nwhich, the patentee may surrender his patent without costs should he\r\nso elect. But should the patentee determine to stand trial, he shall\r\nplead to such information within twenty days, denying the allegations\r\nof the informer, on which the trial shall proceed in its regular order\r\non the calendar, and the patentee, if found wilfully and knowingly a\r\nmonopolizer of the public rights, shall suffer costs and the\r\nreasonable expenses and counsel fee of the informer. And if such\r\ninventor shall make oath he has not been enabled to examine the proofs\r\non which the informer relies to rescind his patent, he shall be\r\nallowed such further time as the court having jurisdiction may\r\nprescribe. And the court may make an order to the informer to exhibit\r\nfully his evidence of priority of invention, and no other evidence\r\nthan has been exhibited to the inventor excepting rebutting, shall be\r\nintroduced on the trial to rescind the patent.\r\n\r\nSEC. 7. The Commissioner of Patents shall collect and keep in the\r\nPatent Office all the scientific works published and useful for\r\nreferences, and pay the expenses of the same from the patent fund. But\r\nthe Commissioner shall not subscribe for more than three copies of any\r\npublication for the use of the office as aforesaid out of the Patent\r\nFund.\r\n\r\nSEC. 8. The application of any known machinery or matter of\r\ncombination of machinery, or matter to new purposes or old purposes\r\nafter a new method, or any means by which useful results are to be\r\nmore advantageously produced than formerly, shall be the subject of a\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nSEC. 9. A method, plan, design, or any new and useful idea, which can\r\nbe defined, shall be the subject of a patent.\r\n\r\nSEC. 10. A simple change of form shall not entitle any one to evade\r\nthe patent of any inventor by a new patent.\r\n\r\nThe above are the principal improvements desired by inventors. Some\r\nthink it not well to ask for all they want at once, but we think\r\ndifferently, for it will be said hereafter, when new amendments are\r\ndesired, 'Gentlemen, you petitioned for the very provisions you now\r\nseek to have annulled. Your own committee was here at Washington\r\nassenting.' What answer will there be to this? None can be made\r\nwithout confusion of face for having over assented to a wrong.\r\n\r\nWe do not desire to censure the committee charged with the mission to\r\nWashington.--They have thought to act prudently and for the greatest\r\ngood. We differ only on the real expediency of the case. We do not\r\nbelieve that such men as Benton, Calhoun, and other kindred spirits,\r\nask or desire anything but what they think is right.\r\n\r\nThey will not sacrifice their reputation against a body of men to whom\r\nthe Republic owe so much, and who have so long suffered in silence.\r\nThe law as it now stands, is an improvement on the former law, and\r\nconsidering how low was the state of morals in former times respecting\r\ninventors, such sentiments as have been advanced by Judge Woodbury,\r\nand which are in spirit the same as the above, are destined ultimately\r\nto prevail. And those who choose to record their names in opposition\r\nare free to do so, as are also the tribe of persecutors who in all\r\nages have stoned the prophets.\r\n\r\nThe principle endeavored to be followed throughout, is that of the\r\ncommon and statutes laws respecting the rights to real property. It\r\nmay tend to create litigation, as to claims which are now refused\r\nentirely, but if no litigation or less is the grand desideratum, why\r\nnot establish a dictatorship at once? The _ipse dixit_ of one man will\r\nthen prevent all argument. But the rights of property and jury trial\r\nin all cases are ours by the constitution--and equally are we entitled\r\nby the constitution to the pursuit of happiness and wealth in ærial\r\nregions as on the common earth--and if we may not be divested of our\r\nother property without certain laws and a fair jury trial, why should\r\nwe be of patent property? And if patent agents presume to beguile\r\nhonest inventors, why should they not be held responsible? They may\r\nrefuse to back their operation by a guaranty, but then the inventor\r\nhas a right to know it, and to know he has a remedy, should they do so\r\nimproperly. The Clerk of one of our Courts guarantied the searches of\r\none of his Clerks as to a piece of real property, and had to pay some\r\nten thousand dollars, and why should it not be so.\r\n\r\nWhen a tailor makes a coat he warrants it to fit, and when a surgeon\r\nsets a leg unscientifically he is also responsible in damages to his\r\npatient, and as is an attorney for negligent practice. Holding\r\nexaminers responsible will leave the patent office open to the filing\r\nof new claims at the same time that it will prevent a world of\r\nlitigation, favoritism and corruption.\r\n\r\nWe are not striking at our present worthy Commissioner, Mr. Burke. We\r\nare friendly to him. But the more honest a man may be, the sooner will\r\nhe find himself displaced, if the office he holds may be used to grasp\r\na vast amount of patronage and property.'\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENTS.\r\n\r\n[**hand pointing right]This paper circulates in every State in the\r\nUnion, and is seen principally by mechanics and manufacturers.

Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Engraving on Wood.=\r\n\r\nNEATLY AND PROMPTLY EXECUTED AT the Office of the Scientific American,\r\n128 Fulton st, three doors from the Sun Office. Designs, DRAWINGS of\r\nall kinds for PATENTS, &c., also made, as above, at very low\r\ncharges.       1\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURIOUS ARTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Labor to make a Watch.=\r\n\r\nMr. Dent, in a lecture delivered before the London Royal Institute,\r\nmade an allusion to the formation of a watch, and stated that a watch\r\nconsists of 992 pieces; and that 40 trades, and probably 215 persons\r\nare employed in making one of these little machines. The iron of which\r\nthe balance wheel is formed, is valued at something less than a\r\nfarthing; this produces an ounce of steel, worth 4 1-2 pence, which is\r\ndrawn into 2,250 yards of steel wire, and represents in the market,\r\n13_l._ 3_s._; but still another process of hardening this originally a\r\nfarthing's worth of iron, renders it workable into 7,050 balance\r\nsprings, which will realize, at the common price, of 2_s._ 6_d_ each\r\n746_l_. 5_s_, the effect of labor alone. Thus it may be seen that the\r\nmere labor bestowed upon one farthing's worth of iron, gives it the\r\nvalue of 950_l._ 5_s_, or $4,552, which is 75,680 times its original\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mule Boats.=\r\n\r\nThis kind of conveyance is, we believe, peculiar to the Illinois\r\nRiver, for we never remember to have seen one belonging to any other\r\nstream. A year or two since, we were perfectly astonished at beholding\r\nthe first one that ever arrived in this port; but now they are as\r\ncommon as the species usually termed _broad horns_, and their\r\nappearance creates about as much surprise and curiosity among the more\r\naristocratic order of steam and sail. A genuine mule boat is not\r\nunlike an ocean steamer, as they are susceptible of being propelled\r\nboth by steam and wind; with this difference, the mule-boat steam is\r\ngenerated upon the tread-mill plan, and by the united exertions of\r\nsome half dozen quadrupeds, generally of the long-eared kind. To this\r\ntreading or pulling apparatus are attached cylinder, pitt-man,\r\nboilers, &c., in the shape of some three or more cog-wheels, and\r\nimmediately connected with them is a couple of shafts, which give a\r\nrotary motion to a couple of water-wheels, one on each side, and which\r\nusually propel a keel about 100 feet in length, and of about 75 tons\r\nburthen; over it is a roof and covering, usually called a cargo box,\r\nto protect the inside from the weather, and the whole making an\r\nappearance similar to an Ohio river keel boat, with the exception of a\r\nspace left her to operate in. The difficulty and danger attending the\r\nmanagement of a boat propelled by steam, is upon the mule boat\r\nentirely dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThere is no firing up, or blowing up; all that is necessary, when\r\nwishing to commence a journey, is to start, and when tired of going,\r\nall that is to be done is to stop the mules; in giving a lick ahead,\r\nthey are all made to bounce at once, and in giving a lick back, they\r\nare turned around and made to pull the other way: and should the wind\r\nprove favorable, by means of a mast, with which they are all\r\nprovided, sails can be hoisted, and the the double power of mules and\r\nwind be put in requisition. This description of boat is getting to be\r\nquite fashionable on the Illinois and tributaries, and some two or\r\nthree extend their trips to this city. They are a great benefit in low\r\nwater, as they are of exceeding light draught, and the running of them\r\nis attended with but trifling expense. We learn that several new ones\r\nare in a state of completion, on the line of the Illinois, intended as\r\nregular traders up the Sangamon river, and from the head of navigation\r\non the Illinois to this city. There is nothing like enterprise, or a\r\nmule boat on the Illinois, in a low stage of water, to get\r\nalong.--[St. Louis New Era.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Discovery of Glass.=\r\n\r\n'As some merchants,' says Pliny, 'were carrying nitre, they stopped\r\nnear a river which issues from Mount Carmel. As they could not readily\r\nfind stones to rest their kettles on, they used for this purpose some\r\nof these pieces of nitre. The fire, which gradually dissolved the\r\nnitre, and mixed it with the sand, occasioned a transparent matter to\r\nflow, which in fact was nothing less than glass.'\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pumping the water out of Lake Michigan.=\r\n\r\nIt is well known to our readers that, by an arrangement with the\r\nEnglish bond holders, the State of Illinois has given over to them the\r\nunfinished canal, from the waters of Lake Michigan, at Chicago, to the\r\nIllinois river.--They are about completing it, but the principal\r\ndifficulty now is, to supply it with water, owing to the level of the\r\nlake being _eight_ feet below the bottom of the canal. To overcome\r\nthis, the present company, after various propositions, finally\r\nbethought themselves of raising the water of the lake, so as to supply\r\nthe canal. They went to Messrs. Knapp & Totten, of this city, and\r\nfurnished them with a data to calculate whether it could be done, and\r\nwhat force and what machinery would accomplish it. These gentlemen\r\nsoon furnished an answer to build some powerful machinery for that\r\npurpose,--a steam engine and _eight_ pumps of four and a half bore and\r\nsix feet stroke. We are glad to hear that this eminently scientific\r\nfirm have been selected to execute this order. Their shop and\r\nmechanical force are not excelled by any establishment in the United\r\nStates.--[Pittsburg Gaz.\r\n\r\n=The Self-Regulating Ventilator.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nExplanation:--This is a cheap and simple but scientific apparatus for\r\nregulating the air-vent of a common, cheap stove, according to the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere in the room in which it is located. The\r\ndraught door is a plain iron door, hung by a common hinge joint at the\r\nupper end; and to the front of the hinge is attached a piece of brass\r\nwire, which extends vertically nearly to the top of the room, and is\r\nconnected at B to a horizontal brass wire C D. This is the only\r\napparatus required, but must be so adjusted as to allow the door to be\r\nclosed, or nearly so, when the temperature is about right. If the\r\ntemperature rises above that point, the horizontal wire will\r\nimmediately expand so as to allow the door to close. But as soon as\r\nthe temperature begins to fail, the wire contracts and opens the vent.\r\nOn this principle the apparatus will readily find a medium, and there\r\nremain, varying only occasionally to accommodate itself to the\r\nvariations of the quantity of fuel in the stove. The entire expense of\r\nthis apparatus, exclusive of the stove, will not exceed 50 cents. It\r\nis generally conceded that a large portion of cases of colds, coughs,\r\n&c. are occasioned by irregularities of the temperature of\r\nsitting-rooms but with this plan of regulation this evil may be\r\navoided without any material expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Paper Mill.=\r\n\r\nMr. C. C. P. Moses has erected a line brick building, 75 by 38 feet,\r\nthree stories high, on the site of the old foundry, at Dover, N. H.,\r\n$12,000 to $15,000. The rooms are constructed and furnished in a\r\ncomplete manner for carrying on the paper making business in all its\r\ndepartments. The works are nearly completed, and will be in operation\r\nin five or six weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=New Mill at Lowell.=\r\n\r\nThe Merrimack Company have in progress of erection the largest mill in\r\nLowell, and which is calculated to employ from 300 to 400 operatives.\r\nThe building is nearly finished, and the machinery is to embrace the\r\nlatest improvements in this or any other country.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Machine Shop.=\r\n\r\nA new machine shop is about commencing operation in Norwich: about\r\nhalf a mile northeast from the railroad depot. The building is 100 by\r\n40 feet, and is calculated to employ 60 hands in the manufacture of\r\nsteam engines and manufacturing machinery. The work at this shop will\r\nbe finished in the best style and at moderate prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ornamental Kites.=\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nThis month being considered as one of the best for flying kites, we\r\nmay indulge our young friends with an article on that subject. The\r\nprinciple on which kites are made to ascend by the action of the wind,\r\nis too well understood, even by children, to require explanation. We\r\nshall merely introduce and describe some fancy models of kites, which\r\nare not often seen. The pattern, fig. 1, which is the figure called a\r\nstar, is very easily made. The frame consists simply of the strips, or\r\nrods of light wood; spruce timber, willow twig's--and interlocked, as\r\nshown in the cut; so that each rod shall pass alternately over and\r\nunder the other rods at each intersection. These rods being lashed\r\ntogether at the points, the whole frame is covered with white or\r\nyellow paper, and the twine is attached to three of the angles of the\r\nstar.\r\n\r\nThe eagle, fig. 2, is but little more difficult; a rod extends from\r\nthe beak to the tail, and is crossed by another which extends from tip\r\nto tip of the wings. The rods being lashed together, a small thread is\r\ndrawn from the place of the head of the eagle, to the two extremities\r\nof the wings, and thence to the leeward end of the centre rod. This\r\nthread should be white or light blue, and will not be visible when\r\naloft; but the form of the eagle should be made of black, dark or\r\nbrown paper. The paper eagle must be sewed to the several threads, and\r\ntwo or more threads may extend from the wings to the centre rod to\r\nsupport the feathers of the wings. The eagle kite appears curious,\r\nbut is not so elegant as\r\n\r\nThe Rose, fig. 3. To construct this figure there must be four light\r\nrods of wood, made to cross each other in the centre, being there\r\nlashed together, and thus constituting eight arms. From the end of\r\neach arm, a thin strip of light wood or reed, is bent in a curved form\r\nto the next arm on either side: the bow being lashed to the arms. This\r\nframe is covered with white paper, which is to be afterward colored\r\nwith rose color, with the yellow centre. The twine must be fastened to\r\nfour of the arms, and the tail of the kite should be covered with\r\ngreen paper, which by the contrast, will have a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rochester Edge Tools in England.=\r\n\r\nSome time since, a Mr. Ash, an extensive manufacturer of Mechanics'\r\nTools at Sheffield, England, sent to this country for patterns of the\r\nlatest improvements, and amongst the rest, ordered a variety from\r\nMessrs. Barton & Belden of Rochester, which were promptly forwarded.\r\nOn their arrival there, it seems that their make gave such universal\r\nsatisfaction, that they were immediately copied, and the fact that\r\nthey came from this country made prominent, by stamping upon them\r\n'Rochester Pattern.'\r\n\r\n\r\n=An Animal Curiosity.=\r\n\r\nTravellers state that there is on the island of St. Luce a cavern, in\r\nwhich is a large basin twelve or fifteen feet deep, at the bottom of\r\nwhich are rocks. From these rocks proceed certain substances that\r\npresent at first, sight beautiful flowers, but on the approach of a\r\nhand or instrument, retire like a snail, out of sight! On examination,\r\nthere appears in the middle of a disk, filaments resembling spiders'\r\nlegs, which moved briskly round a kind of petal. The filaments, or\r\nlegs, have pincers to seize their prey, when the petals close, so that\r\nit cannot escape. Under this flower is the body of an animal, and it\r\nis probable he lives on the marine insects thrown by the sea into his\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe first clock that ever measured time was made for the Caliph of\r\nBagdad. This art was afterwards lost for several centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Skate Runners.=\r\n\r\nAt Drontheim, in Norway, they have a regiment of soldiers, called\r\nSkate Runners. They wear leg gaiters for travelling in deep snow, and\r\ngreen uniform. They carry a short sword, a rifle fastened by a broad\r\nstrap passing over the shoulder, and a climbing staff seven feet long,\r\nwith a spike in the end. They move so fast in the snow that no cavalry\r\ncan overtake them, and it does little good to fire cannon balls at\r\nthem, as they go two or three hundred feet apart. They are very useful\r\nsoldiers in following an enemy on a march. They go over marshes,\r\nrivers and lakes at a great rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Receipt to make Peach Wine.=\r\n\r\nTake four or five bushels of ripe juicy peaches, mash or bruise them\r\nin a tub, and pour them into a barrel, large enough to contain them,\r\nand place it in a cool place. At the bottom of the barrel, before\r\nputting in the peaches, some clean straw must be placed to prevent the\r\npumice from filling up the spigot. The head of the barrel must be\r\ncovered. In about three days the Peach Wine is ready for use. Draw it\r\noff, from the spigot, and if care and attention have been adopted, a\r\ndelicious beverage will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A Novel Enterprise.=\r\n\r\nAn expedition, which promises the most important results both to\r\nscience and commerce is at this moment fitting out in England, for the\r\npurpose of navigating some of the more important unexplored rivers in\r\nSouth America It is to be under the command of Lord Ranelagh. Several\r\nnoblemen and gentlemen have already volunteered to accompany his\r\nlordship, and the enterprising and scientific band, it is said, will\r\nsail as soon as the necessary arrangements shall be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK\r\n\r\n=SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:=\r\n\r\n_Published Weekly at 128 Fulton Street., (Sun Building,) New York._\r\n\r\nBY MUNN & COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN is the Advocate of Industry and Journal of\r\nMechanical and other Improvements: as such its contents are probably\r\nmore varied and interesting, than those of any other weekly newspaper\r\nin the United States, and certainly more useful. It contains as much\r\ninteresting Intelligence as six ordinary daily papers, while for _real\r\nbenefit_, it is unequalled by any thing yet published. Each number\r\nregularly contains from THREE to SIX ORIGINAL ENGRAVINGS, illustrated\r\nby NEW INVENTIONS, American and Foreign,--SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES and\r\nCURIOSITIES,--Notices of the progress of Mechanical and other\r\nScientific Improvements, Scientific Essays on the principles of the\r\nSciences of MECHANICS, CHEMISTRY and ARCHITECTURE,--Catalogues of\r\nAmerican Patents,--INSTRUCTION in various ARTS and TRADES, _with\r\nengravings_,--Curious Philosophical Experiments,--the latest RAIL\r\nROAD INTELLIGENCE in EUROPE and AMERICA,--Valuable information on the\r\nArt of GARDENING, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis paper is especially entitled to the patronage of MECHANICS and\r\nMANUFACTURERS, being devoted to the interests of those classes. It is\r\nparticularly useful to FARMERS, as it will not only apprise them of\r\nIMPROVEMENTS in AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS, but INSTRUCT them in various\r\nMECHANICAL TRADES, and guard against impositions. As a FAMILY\r\nNEWSPAPER, it will convey more USEFUL Intelligence to children and\r\nyoung people, than five times its cost in school instruction.\r\n\r\nBeing published in QUARTO FORM, it is conveniently adapted to\r\nPRESERVATION and BINDING.\r\n\r\nTERMS.--The Scientific American is sent to subscribers in the country\r\nat the rate of $2 a year, ONE DOLLAR IN ADVANCE, the remainder in 6\r\nmonths.
