Some of these\r\nfunctions are, however, exercised in a mode apparently so dissimilar\r\nfrom what obtains in the higher animals, that upon a first view we are\r\ninclined to pronounce them the effect of processes altogether peculiar.\r\nThus, though insects respire _air_, they do not receive it by the\r\n_mouth_, but through little orifices in the _sides_ of the body; and\r\ninstead of _lungs_, they are furnished with a system of air-vessels,\r\nramified _ad infinitum_, and penetrating to every part and organ of\r\ntheir frame; and though they are nourished by a fluid prepared from\r\nthe food received into the stomach, this fluid, unlike the blood of\r\nvertebrate animals, is _white_, and the mode in which it is distributed\r\nto the different parts of the system, except in the case of the true\r\n_Arachnida_, in which a circulation in the ordinary way has been\r\ndetected, is altogether obscure.\r\n\r\nIn order that you may more clearly understand the variations\r\nthat occur in insects, and in what respects they differ amongst\r\nthemselves, and from the higher animals, in the vital functions\r\nand their organs, I shall consider them as to their organs of\r\n_sensation_, _respiration_, _circulation_, _nutrition_, _generation_,\r\n_secretion_, and _muscular motion_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Organs of Sensation._--The nervous system of animals is one of\r\nthe most wonderful and mysterious works of the CREATOR. Its pulpy\r\nsubstance is the _visible_ medium by which the governing principle[1]\r\ntransmits its commands to the various organs of the body, and they\r\nmove instantaneously--yet this appears to be but the conductor of some\r\nhigher principle, which can be more immediately acted upon by the mind\r\nand by the will. This principle, however, whatever it be, whether we\r\ncall it the nervous _fluid_, or the nervous _power_[2], has not been\r\ndetected, and is known only by its effects. The system of which we are\r\nspeaking may therefore be deemed the foundation and root of the animal,\r\nthe centre from which emanate all its powers and functions.\r\n\r\nComparative anatomists have considered the nervous system of\r\nanimals as formed upon _four_ primary types, which may be\r\ncalled the _molecular_, the _filamentous_, the _ganglionic_,\r\nand _cerebro-spinal_[3]. The _first_ is where invisible nervous\r\nmolecules are dispersed in a gelatinous body, the existence of\r\nwhich has only been ascertained by the nervous irritability of such\r\nbodies, their fine sense of touch, their perceiving the movements\r\nof the waters in which they reside, and from their perfect sense\r\nof the degrees of light and heat[4]. Of this description are the\r\ninfusory animals, and the _Polypi_. The nervous molecules in these\r\nare conjectured to constitute so many ganglions, or centres of\r\nsensation and vitality[5]. The _second_, the filamentous, is where\r\nthe nervous system consists of nervous threads radiating from the\r\nmouth, as in the _Radiata_, or star-fish and sea-urchins[6]. The\r\n_third_, the ganglionic, is where the nervous system consists of\r\na series of ganglions connected by nervous threads or a medullary\r\nchord, placed, except the first ganglion, below the intestines, from\r\nwhich proceed nerves to the various parts of the body. This system\r\nmay be considered as divisible into two--the _proper ganglionic_,\r\nin which it is ganglionic with the ganglions arranged in a series\r\nwith a double spinal chord. This prevails in the classes _Insecta_,\r\n_Crustacea_, _Arachnida_, &c., and the _improper ganglionic_, in\r\nwhich it is ganglionic with the ganglions dispersed irregularly,\r\nbut connected by nervous threads, as in the _Mollusca_[7]. In the\r\n_fourth_, the cerebro-spinal, the nervous tree may be said to be\r\ndouble, or to consist of _two_ systems--the first taking its origin\r\nin a brain formed of two hemispheres contained in the cavity of the\r\nhead, from which posteriorly proceeds a spinal marrow, included\r\nin a dorsal vertebral column. These send forth numerous nerves to\r\nthe organs of the senses and the muscles of the limbs. The second\r\nconsists of two principal ventral chords, which by their ganglions,\r\nbut without any direct communication, anastomose with the spinal\r\nnerves and some of those of the brain, and run one on each side from\r\nthe base of the skull to the extremity of the _sacrum_. This system\r\nconsists of an assemblage of nervous filaments bearing numerous\r\nganglions, from which nervous threads are distributed to the organs\r\nof nutrition and reproduction[8]. Its chords are called the _great\r\nsympathetic_, the _intercostal_, or _trisplanchnic_ nerves[9].\r\nWhile the first of these two systems is the messenger of the will,\r\nby means of the organs of the senses connects us with the external\r\nworld, and is subject to have its agency interrupted by sleep or\r\ndisease[10]; the latter is altogether independent of the will and of\r\nthe intellect, is confined to the internal organic life, its agency\r\ncontinues uninterrupted during sleep, and is subject to no paralysis.\r\nWhile the former is the seat of the intellectual powers, the latter\r\nhas no relation to them, but is the focus from whence _instincts_\r\nexclusively emanate: from it proceed spontaneous impulses and\r\nsympathies, and those passions and affections that excite the agent\r\nto acts in which the will and the judgement have no concern[11].\r\n\r\nIt is probable, though the above appear to exhibit the _primary_ types\r\nof nervous systems, that others exist of an _intermediate_ nature, with\r\nwhich future investigators may render us better acquainted[12]: but as\r\nour business is solely with that upon which _insects_ in this respect\r\nhave been modelled, without expatiating further in this interesting\r\nfield, I shall therefore now confine myself to them.\r\n\r\nWe have before seen[13] that the nervous system of insects belongs to\r\nthe _ganglionic_ type: but it requires a more full description, and\r\nthis is the place for it. It originates in a small brain placed in\r\nthe head, and consisting almost universally of two lobes, sometimes\r\nextremely distinct. It is placed over or upon the _œsophagus_ or\r\ngullet, and from its posterior part proceeds a double nervous chord,\r\nwhich embracing that organ as a collar dips below the intestines, and\r\nproceeds towards the anus, forming knots or ganglions at intervals,\r\nin many cases corresponding in number with the segments of the body,\r\nand sending forth nerves in pairs, the ramifications of which are\r\ndistributed to every part of the frame. In the perfect insect the\r\nbilobed ganglion of the head or the brain is usually of greater volume\r\nthan in the larva, and the ganglions of the spinal chord are fewer,\r\nwhich gives a more decided character of _centricity_ to the whole\r\nnervous system[14]. This may be considered more particularly with\r\nrespect to its _substance_ and _colour_; its _tunics_, and _parts_.\r\n\r\nI. _Substance and Colour._--The nervous apparatus of insects is\r\nstated by those who have examined it most narrowly, though consisting\r\nof a cortical and medullary part, the latter more delicate and\r\ntransparent than the former, to be less tender and less easy to\r\nseparate than the human brain[15]. It has a degree of tenacity,\r\nand does not break without considerable tension; in general, it\r\nis clammy and flabby, and under a microscope a number of minute\r\ngrains are discoverable in it, and when left to dry upon glass, it\r\nappears to contain a good deal of oil, which does not dry with the\r\nrest[16]. That of the ganglions differs from the substance of the\r\nrest of the spinal chord, in being filled with very fine aërial\r\nvessels, which are not discoverable in the latter[17]. With regard\r\nto _colour_, Lyonet states that the chords of the spinal marrow in\r\nthe larva of the great goat-moth are of a blueish gray, and have some\r\ntransparence[18]; Malpighi and Swammerdam observed that the cortical\r\npart of the ganglions of that of the silk-worm and the hive-bee had a\r\nreddish hue, while the medullary part was white[19]; Cuvier relates\r\nthat the brain and the third ganglion in _Hypogymna dispar_, with\r\nus a scarce moth, differed in colour from all the rest, being quite\r\nwhite, while the others were more or less tinted, and examined under\r\na lens appeared variegated by reddish sinuous markings, resembling\r\nblood vessels as they are seen in injected glands[20].\r\n\r\nII. _Tunics._--The coats that inclose the various branches of the\r\nnervous system in insects seem analogous to those of vertebrate\r\nanimals. The first thing that strikes the eye, when these parts in\r\na recent subject are submitted to a microscope, is a tissue of very\r\ndelicate vessels, which ramify beyond the reach of the assisted\r\nsight; these are merely air-vessels or _bronchiæ_ derived originally\r\nfrom the _tracheæ_ of the animal: but besides these is an exterior\r\nand an interior tunic; the first corresponding with the _dura mater_\r\nof anatomists; and the other, which is the most delicate and\r\nincloses the cortical and medullary parts, with the _pia mater_[21].\r\n\r\nIII. _Parts._--The nervous system of insects consists of the _brain_;\r\nthe _spinal marrow_ and its _ganglions_; and the _nerves_.\r\n\r\ni. _Brain_.[22] Linné denied the existence of a _brain_ in insects,\r\nand most modern physiologists seem to be of the same opinion. A\r\npart however, analogous to this important organ--at least in its\r\nsituation, and in its emission of nerves to the principal organs of\r\nthe _senses_, in which respect it certainly differs very materially\r\nfrom the upper cervical ganglion, which Dr. Virey regards as its\r\nanalogue[23]--is certainly to be found in them; and as Messrs. Cuvier\r\nand Lamarck distinguish this part by the name of _brain_, we may\r\ncontinue to call it by that name without impropriety. The _brain_\r\nof insects, then, is distinguished from the succeeding ganglions of\r\nthe spinal chord by its _situation_ in the head, the middle of the\r\ninternal cavity of which it occupies, and by being the only ganglion\r\n_above_ the œsophagus. It is usually small, though in some cases\r\nlarger than they are[24]. It consists of two lobes, more or less\r\ndistinct and generally of a spherical form. In _Oryctes nasicornis_\r\nand _Pontia Brassicæ_ the lobes are separated both before and\r\nbehind[25]; while in the larva of _Dytiscus marginalis_, but not in\r\nthe imago, in which there are two large hemispheres separated by a\r\nfurrow, the brain is undivided[26]. Cuvier mentions the larva of a\r\nsaw-fly in which this part is formed of _four_ nearly equal spherical\r\nbulbs[27]: in the Scorpion (to judge by the figure of Treviranus[28])\r\nthe two lobes represent an equilateral triangle, the exterior angle\r\nof which terminates in several lesser spherical bulbs; in _Acrida\r\nviridissima_, _Nepa cinerea_, _Clubiona atrox_, and the common Louse,\r\nthe lobes are pear-shaped[29].\r\n\r\nii. _The spinal marrow and its ganglions_[30]. From the _posterior_\r\npart of the brain of insects, but in the ground and water beetles\r\n(_Eutrech_in_a_ and _Eunech_in_a_) from its _sides_ below[31], issue\r\ntwo chords which diverging embrace the _œsophagus_, and dipping\r\nbelow it and the intestines,--a situation they maintain to the end\r\nof their course,--and in their further progress uniting at intervals\r\nand dilating into several knots or ganglions, compose their spinal\r\nmarrow. This part is so named, from a supposed analogy to the spinal\r\nmarrow of vertebrate animals, which however admits of some degree of\r\ndoubt; yet, since it mixes the functions of that organ with those\r\nof the great sympathetic nerves, the denomination is not wholly\r\nimproper, and may be retained. Though this chord is usually _double_\r\nwhen it first proceeds from the brain, and surrounds the _œsophagus_\r\nlike a collar, yet in some insects it may be called a _single_ chord.\r\nThis is the case with that of the common louse, in which Swammerdam\r\ncould perceive no opening for the transmission of the part just\r\nnamed[32]; if he was not mistaken in this, the brain, as well as\r\nthe rest of the spinal marrow in that animal, would be below the\r\nintestines; from the figures of Treviranus it should seem that the\r\nspiders, at least _Clubiona atrox_, are similarly circumstanced[33];\r\nin the cheese-maggot, which turns to a two-winged fly (_Tyrophaga\r\nCasei_), the chord is also single, but it has a small orifice\r\nthrough which the gullet passes[34]. At the union of the chords in\r\nother cases below that organ, a knot or ganglion is usually formed,\r\nand an alternate succession of internodes and ganglions commonly\r\nfollows to the end. The internodes also may generally be stated to\r\nconsist of a _double_ chord, though in many cases the two chords\r\nunite and become one, or are distinguished only by a longitudinal\r\nfurrow, and even where they are really distinct and separable, in the\r\nbody of the insect they lie close together[35]. In the rhinoceros\r\nbeetle (_Oryctes nasicornis_) and _Acrida viridissima_ &c. _all_\r\nthe internodes consist of a double chord[36]; but in many other\r\ninsects numerous variations in this respect occur.--Thus in the\r\nstag-beetle the _last_ internode is single[37]; in the caterpillar\r\nof the cabbage butterfly (_Pontia Brassicæ_) the _five first_ are\r\ndouble, and the _six last_ single[38]; in that of the great goat-moth\r\n(_Cossus ligniperda_) the _three first_ only are double, but the\r\nothers terminate in a fork[39]; in the cockroaches (_Blatta_) the\r\n_four first_, in _Hydrophilus piceus_ the _three first_, and in\r\n_Eristalis tenax_ the _two first_ only are double, the rest being all\r\nsingle[40]. A singular variation takes place in _Hypogymna dispar_;\r\n_all_ the internodes are single, except the _second_, the chords of\r\nwhich at first are separate, and afterwards united[41]; and, to name\r\nno more, in _Clubiona atrox_ there is only _one_ internode, which is\r\nsingle, with a longitudinal furrow[42]. In some, as in the louse, the\r\ngrub of _Oryctes nasicornis_, and the cheese-maggot, there are no\r\ninternodes, the spinal marrow being formed of knots separated only by\r\nslight or deep constrictions[43].\r\n\r\nI must next say something of the _ganglions_[44]. Lyonet has observed\r\nthat, in the caterpillar of the great goat-moth, these in one respect\r\ndiffer remarkably from the chords that connect them; in the latter\r\nthe air-vessels or bronchiæ only cover the _outside_ of the tunic,\r\nwhile in the former they enter the _substance_ of the ganglion, which\r\nis quite filled with their delicate and numberless branches[45].\r\nEvery ganglion may be regarded in some degree as a centre of vitality\r\nor little brain[46], and in many cases, as well as the brain,\r\nthey are formed of two lobes[47]. I shall now consider them more\r\nparticularly as to their _station_, _number_, and _shape_.\r\n\r\n1. With regard to the first head, their _station_, they are most\r\ncommonly divided between the trunk and abdomen; but in some cases,\r\nas in _Hydrophilus piceus_ and _Acrida viridissima_, the _first_\r\nganglion is in the _head_[48]; in others, as in the louse, the\r\nwater-scorpion, and the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle, they are\r\nconfined to the _trunk_, their functions in the abdomen being\r\nsupplied by numerous radiating nerves[49]; in others again, as in\r\nthe scorpion, they are all _abdominal_. The ganglions vary also in\r\ntheir situation with respect to each other. Thus in some, as in the\r\nlarva of the Chamæleon-fly (_Stratyomis Chamæleon_), they are so near\r\nas to appear like a string of beads[50]; in that of the ant-lion\r\n(_Myrmeleon_) the two ganglions of the trunk are separated by an\r\ninterval from those of the abdomen, which are so contiguous as to\r\nresemble the rattle of the rattle-snake[51]. In others the internodes\r\nare longer, and the ganglions occur at nearly equal intervals, as in\r\nthe larva of the _Ephemeræ_[52]; but in the majority they are unequal\r\nin length: thus in the scorpion the three first ganglions are the\r\nmost distant[53]; in the hive-bee the third and fourth[54]; and in\r\nthe spider the last[55].\r\n\r\n2. The ganglions also in different species, and often in the same\r\ninsect in its different states, vary in their _number_. Thus in\r\nthe grub of the rhinoceros-beetle the whole spinal marrow appears\r\nlike a _single_ ganglion divided only by transverse furrows[56];\r\nin the water-scorpion there are _two_[57]; in the louse there\r\nare _three_[58]; in the rhinoceros-beetle there are _four_[59];\r\n_five_ in the stag-beetle[60]; _seven_ in the hive-bee and some\r\n_Lepidoptera_[61]; _eight_ in the grub of the stag-beetle[62]; _nine_\r\nin the great _Hydrophilus_[63]; _ten_ in _Dytiscus_[64]; _eleven_\r\nin the grub of the great _Hydrophilus_[65]; _twelve_ in the grub of\r\n_Dytiscus_ and the caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_[66]; _thirteen_\r\nin the larva of _Æshna_[67]; and _twenty-four_ in _Scolopendra\r\nmorsitans_[68]. You must observe that, generally speaking, the number\r\nof ganglions is less in the _imago_ than in the _larva_. With regard\r\nto the distribution of these knots to the different primary parts\r\nof the body, the following table will exhibit it, as far as I am\r\nacquainted with it, at one view. I omit those in which the ganglions\r\nare only in _one_ of these parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Head.  Trunk. Abdomen.\r\n\r\n  _Acrida viridissima_     1      3      6[69]\r\n\r\n  _Hydrophilus piceus_     1      6      2\r\n\r\n  _Clubiona atrox_         0      2      1\r\n\r\n  _Gryllotalpa vulgaris_   0      2      7[70]\r\n\r\n  _Myrmeleon, Larva_       0      2      8[71]\r\n\r\n  _Eristalis tenax_        0      3      2[72]\r\n\r\n  _Apis mellifica_         0      3      4\r\n\r\n  _Ephemera, Larva_        0      3      7\r\n\r\n  _Æshna, Larva_           0      6      7\r\n\r\n3. I am next to say a few words upon the _shape_ of the ganglions.\r\nMost commonly it approaches to a _spherical_ figure, but in many\r\ninstances, as I said before, they, as well as the brain, consist\r\nof _two_ lobes: they are, however, seldom all precisely of the same\r\nshape. In the _Dytisci_, and _Carabi_, the last is marked with a\r\ntransverse furrow, which seems to indicate the reunion of two[73];\r\nin the stag-beetle, the first ganglion is oval or elliptical, the\r\nsecond hexagonal; the third and fourth shaped like a crescent, and\r\nthe last like an olive[74]; in the caterpillar of the great goat-moth\r\nthe first is oblong and constricted in the middle, and the seven last\r\nare rhomboidal[75]; in the great _Hydrophilus_ the _second_, and in\r\nthe silk-worm _all_ the ganglions are quadrangular[76]; in _Hypogymna\r\ndispar_ the _third_ is heart-shaped[77]; the great ganglion which\r\nforms the spinal marrow of the cheese-maggot is pear-shaped[78];\r\nthat of the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle is fusiform[79]; and in\r\nthe scorpion all the ganglions are lenticular[80]. But the most\r\nremarkable in this respect are those of a spider (_Clubiona atrox_):\r\nin this insect the brain sits upon a bilobed ganglion of the ordinary\r\nform, which is immediately followed without any internode by another\r\nbilobed one, terminating on each side in four pear-shaped processes\r\nor fingers, which give it a very singular appearance[81].\r\n\r\niii. The _nerves_[82] of insects, as of other animals, are white\r\nfilaments running from the brain and spinal marrow to every part\r\nof the body which they are destined to animate; and their numerous\r\nramifications, when delineated, form no unpleasing picture[83].\r\nIn the caterpillar of the goat-moth the accurate Lyonet counted\r\n_forty-five_ pairs of them, and _two_ single ones, making in all\r\n_ninety-two_ nerves; whereas in the _human_ body anatomists count only\r\n_seventy-eight_[84]. From the brain issue several pairs, which go to\r\nthe _eyes_, _antennæ_, _palpi_, and other parts of the mouth: sometimes\r\nthose that render to the mandibles issue from the first ganglion, as\r\nin the larva of _Dytiscus marginalis_, the stag-beetle, &c.[85]; those\r\nboth of _mandibles_ and _palpi_ in the great _Hydrophilus_[86]; and in\r\n_Blatta_ some which act also upon the _antennæ_[87].\r\n\r\nThe _optic_ are usually the most conspicuous and remarkable of the\r\nnerves. In some insects with large eyes, as many _Neuroptera_,\r\n_Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_, their size is considerable; in the\r\nhive-bee they present the appearance of a pair of kidney-shaped\r\nlobes, larger than the brain[88]; in the dragon-flies, whose brain\r\nconsists of two very minute lobes, these nerves dilate into two large\r\nplates of a similar shape, which line all the inner surface of the\r\neyes[89]; in the stag-beetle they are pear-shaped, and terminate in\r\na bulb, from which issue an infinity of minute nerves[90]; it is\r\nprobable that this takes place in all cases, and that a separate\r\nnerve renders to every separate lens in a compound eye[91]; the optic\r\nnerve in _Dytiscus_ and _Carabus_ is pyramidal, with the base of the\r\npyramid at the eye and the summit at the brain[92]; in _Eristalis\r\ntenax_ it is very large, cylindrical, and of a diameter equal to\r\nthe length of the last-mentioned part, upon the side of which it is\r\nsupported; it terminates in a very large bulb corresponding to the\r\neye[93]: in _Scolopendra morsitans_ the optic nerves divide into four\r\nbranches long before they arrive at the eyes, and in this insect the\r\nnerves which render to the antennæ are so thick as to appear portions\r\nof the brain, which they equal in diameter[94]. Swammerdam discovered\r\nin the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle and in the caterpillar of\r\nthe silk-worm, a pair of nerves which he regarded as analogous\r\nto the _recurrent nerves_ in the human subject, and therefore he\r\ndistinguishes them by the same name[95]: they issue from the lower\r\nsurface of the brain, or that which rests on the _œsophagus_, and at\r\nfirst go towards the mouth, but afterwards turn back, and uniting\r\nform a small ganglion; this produces a single nerve, which passing\r\nbelow the brain follows the œsophagus to the stomach, where it swells\r\ninto another ganglion, from which issue some small nerves that\r\nrender to the stomach, and one more considerable which accompanies\r\nthe intestinal canal, producing at intervals lateral filaments which\r\nlose themselves in the tunics of that tube[96]. Lyonet afterwards\r\ndiscovered these nerves in the caterpillar of the goat-moth[97], and\r\nCuvier in other insects[98].\r\n\r\nThe other nerves which issue from the brain exhibit no remarkable\r\nfeatures. Those which originate in the spinal marrow are mostly derived\r\nfrom the ganglions, and are sometimes interwoven with the muscles, as\r\nthe woof with the warp in a piece of cloth[99]; those from the three\r\nor four first commonly rendering to the muscles of the legs, wings,\r\nand other parts of the _trunk_, and those from the remainder to the\r\n_abdomen_. After their origin they often divide and subdivide, and\r\nterminate in numerous ramifications that connect every part of the body\r\nwith the _sensorium commune_. A _pair_ of nerves is the most usual\r\nnumber that proceeds from each side of a ganglion[100]; but this is\r\nby no means constant, since in the louse, the hive-bee, and several\r\nother insects, only a _single_ nerve thus proceeds[101]; and in the\r\nlarva of _Ephemeræ_, while _two_ pairs issue from the _six first_\r\nganglions, only a _single_ one is emitted by the _five last_[102].\r\nIn the spinal marrow of the rhinoceros-beetle, both larva and imago,\r\nthe nerves consist of simple filaments which diverge like rays in all\r\ndirections[103]: the same circumstance distinguishes the cheese-maggot,\r\nonly some of the nerves appear to branch at the end[104]: in the\r\nlouse, the last ganglion sends forth posteriorly three pairs of nerves\r\nwhich render to the abdomen[105]. Sometimes, though rarely, nerves\r\noriginate in the _internodes_ of the spinal marrow. Cuvier indeed\r\nhas asserted that in invertebrate animals _all_ the nerves spring\r\nfrom the ganglions, and never immediately from the spinal marrow; but\r\nSwammerdam, in describing those of the silk-worm, mentions and figures\r\nfour pairs as proceeding from the four anterior internodes, excluding\r\nthe first[106]; and at the same time he gives it as his opinion, that\r\nall the nerves in insects really originate from the marrow itself, and\r\nnot from the ganglions, which he asserts are of a different substance,\r\nand are inclosed in the marrow for the sake of giving it greater\r\nfirmness[107]. In this opinion, however, he seems singular[108]. Those\r\nremarkable nerves described by Lyonet under the name of _spinal bridle_\r\n(_bride épinière_) also take their origin, not from the ganglions, but\r\nfrom a bifurcation of the spinal marrow. Of these, in the caterpillar\r\nof the goat-moth there are _ten_, the first issuing from the\r\nbifurcation of the internode between the fourth and fifth ganglions,\r\nand the remainder from the succeeding ones. After approaching the\r\nsucceeding ganglion, these nerves form a pair of branches that diverge\r\nnearly at right angles from the bridle, and producing several lesser\r\nbranches, lose themselves in the sides of the animal[109]. Besides the\r\nnerves above mentioned, two generally issue from the posterior part\r\nof the last ganglion, diverging in opposite and oblique directions:\r\nsome of these render to the parts of generation; and in the silk-worm,\r\nand probably other species, the innermost pair is perforated for the\r\npassage of the _vasa deferentia_[110].\r\n\r\nAfter duly considering this general outline of the nervous system\r\nof insects, the question will continually occur to you,--is then\r\nwhat you have called the _brain_ the _sensorium commune_ of these\r\nanimals, in the same manner as it is in those with warm blood? To\r\nthis query a negative must be returned. In the latter, the brain is\r\nthe common centre to which, by means of the nerves and spinal marrow,\r\nall the sensations of the animal are conveyed, and in which all its\r\nperceptions terminate. The nerves and spinal marrow are merely the\r\n_roads_ by which the sensations travel; and if their communication\r\nwith the brain, by any means be cut off at the neck, the whole\r\ntrunk of the animal becomes paralytic, evidently proving that the\r\norgan by which it feels is the brain. This, however, is so far from\r\nbeing the case in insects, that in them, if the head be cut off,\r\nthe remainder of the body will continue to give proofs of life and\r\nsensation longer than the head: both portions will live after the\r\nseparation, sometimes for a considerable period; but the largest\r\nwill survive the longest, and will _move_, _walk_, and occasionally\r\neven _fly_, at first almost as actively without the head, as when\r\nunited to it. Lyonet informs us, that he has seen motion in the body\r\nof a wasp _three_ days after it had been separated from the head;\r\nand that a caterpillar even _walked_ some days after that operation;\r\nand when touched, the headless animal made the same movements as\r\nwhen intire[111]. Dr. Shaw has observed--an observation confirmed in\r\nUnzer's _Kleine Schriften_,--that if _Geophilus electricus_ be cut in\r\ntwo, the halves will live and appear vigorous even for a _fortnight_\r\nafterwards; and what is more remarkable, that the _tail_ part always\r\nsurvives the _head_ two or three days[112]. The _sensorium commune_\r\nof insects, therefore, does not, as in the warm-blooded animals,\r\nreside in the brain alone, but in the spinal marrow also. It was on\r\nthis account probably that Linné denied the existence of a _brain_ in\r\ninsects, regarding it merely as the first ganglion of the spine.\r\n\r\nCuvier and other modern physiologists, from the ganglionic structure\r\nof this organ, are of opinion that it is not the analogue of the\r\n_cerebro-spinal_ system of vertebrate animals, but rather of\r\ntheir _great sympathetic_ nerves. Indeed, considering solely the\r\n_external_ structure of the nervous system of insects, a great\r\nresemblance strikes us between it and these nerves; for besides\r\nits general ganglionic structure, there is also in them an _upper_\r\nganglion in the neck, seemingly corresponding with what we have\r\nnamed the brain of insects, from which the nervous chord dips to\r\nthe lower part of the neck, where it forms a _second_ ganglion,\r\nwhich appears to correspond with what we have considered as their\r\nsecond ganglion[113]. We may observe, however, that at least in\r\none respect there is even an _external_ resemblance between the\r\nbrain of insects and that of vertebrate animals:--it most commonly\r\nconsists, as has been stated, like them, of two lobes, often very\r\ndistinct; a circumstance which not unfrequently distinguishes the\r\nother ganglions[114], and is not borrowed from the ganglions of\r\nthe great sympathetics. With respect to the internal structure\r\nof the ganglions and spinal marrow of insects, we know little to\r\nbuild any theory upon, except that the internal substance of the\r\nformer is filled with air-vessels; at least so Lyonet, as has been\r\nalready observed, found in the goat-moth, while only the tunics of\r\nthe latter are covered by them. Taking the above resemblance to the\r\nbrain of vertebrates into consideration, there appears ground for\r\nthinking that the nervous system of insects, like some of their\r\narticulations[115], is of a _mixed_ kind, combining in it both the\r\ncerebro-spinal and the ganglionic systems; and this will appear\r\nfurther if we consider its _functions_.\r\n\r\nThat learned and acute physiologist Dr. Virey, assuming as an\r\nhypothesis, that the structure of the system in question is simply\r\nganglionic, and merely analogous to the sympathetic system of\r\nvertebrate animals, has built a theory upon the assumption, which\r\nappears evidently contradicted by facts. Because, as he conceives\r\nafter Cuvier, insects are not gifted with a real brain and spinal\r\nmarrow, he would make it a necessary consequence that they have no\r\ndegree of _intellect_, no memory, judgement or free will; but are\r\nguided in every respect by instinct and spontaneous impulses,--that\r\nthey are incapable of instruction, and can superadd no acquired\r\nhabits to those which are instinctive and inbred[116]. This\r\nconsequence would certainly necessarily follow, was their nervous\r\nsystem perfectly analogous to the sympathetic of warm-blooded\r\nanimals. But when we come to take into consideration the _functions_\r\nthat in insects this system confessedly discharges, we are led to\r\ndoubt very strongly the correctness of the assumption. Now in these\r\nanimals the system in question not only renders to the nutritive and\r\nreproductive organs, which is the principal function of the great\r\nsympathetic nerves in the vertebrates; but by the common organs\r\nmaintains a connexion with the external world, and acquires ideas\r\nof things without, which in them is a function of the cerebral\r\nsystem: from the same centre also issue those powers which at the\r\nbidding of the will put the limbs in action, which also belongs to\r\nthe cerebral system. That insects have memory, and consequently a\r\nreal brain, has been before largely proved, as also that they have\r\nthat degree of intellect and judgement which enables them to profit\r\nby the notices furnished by their senses[117]. What can be the use\r\nof eyes,--of the senses of hearing, smelling, feeling, &c. if they\r\nare not instructed by them what to choose and what to avoid? And\r\nif they _are_ thus instructed--they must have sufficient intellect\r\nto apprehend it, and a portion of free will to enable them to act\r\naccording to it. With regard to the assertion that they are incapable\r\nof instruction, or of acquiring new habits; few or no experiments\r\nhave been tried with the express purpose of ascertaining this point:\r\nbut some well-authenticated facts are related, from which it seems to\r\nresult that insects may be taught some things, and acquire habits not\r\ninstinctive. They could scarcely be brought from their wild state,\r\nand domesticated, as bees have been so universally, and both ants\r\nand wasps occasionally[118], without some departure from the habits\r\nof their wild state; and the fact of the corsair-bees, that acquire\r\npredatory habits before described[119], shows this more evidently:\r\nbut one of the most remarkable stories to our purpose upon record,\r\nis that of M. Pelisson, who, when he was confined in the Bastile,\r\ntamed a spider, and taught it to come for food at the sound of an\r\ninstrument. A manufacturer also in Paris, fed 800 spiders in an\r\napartment, which became so tame that whenever he entered it, which he\r\nusually did bringing a dish filled with flies but not always, they\r\nimmediately came down to him to receive their food[120].\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances having their due consideration and weight,\r\nit seems, I think, most probable, that as insects have their\r\ncommunication with the external world by means of certain organs in\r\nconnexion with their nervous system, and appear to have some degree\r\nof intellect, memory, and free will, all of which in the higher\r\nanimals are functions of a cerebral system, and at the same time in\r\nother respects manifest those which are peculiar to the sympathetic\r\nsystem,--it is most probable, I say, as was above hinted, that in\r\ntheir system _both_ are _united_.\r\n\r\nI must bespeak your attention to a circumstance connected with the\r\nsubject of this letter, which merits particular consideration: I\r\nmean the gradual change that takes place in the nervous system\r\nwhen insects undergo their metamorphoses; so that, except in the\r\n_Orthoptera_, _Hemiptera_, and _Neuroptera_ Orders, in which no\r\nchange is undergone, the number of ganglions of the spinal chord is\r\nless in the imago than in the larva. There seems an exception indeed\r\nto this rule in the case of the rhinoceros-beetle, in the larva of\r\nwhich there is only _one_ ganglion, while in the imago there are\r\n_four_[121]. But as this one ganglion occupies the whole spinal\r\nmarrow, it is really of greater extent than the four of the imago;\r\nso that even in this case there is a concentration of the cerebral\r\npulp. In some cases, as in _Dytiscus marginalis_, and _Hydrophilus\r\npiceus_[122], the imago has only _one_ ganglion less than the larva,\r\nbut more generally it loses _four_ or _five_. Dr. Herold has traced\r\nthe gradual changes that take place in the spinal marrow of the\r\ncommon cabbage-butterfly (_Pontia Brassicæ_), from the time that it\r\nhas attained its full size to its assumption of the imago. Of these I\r\nshall now give you some account.\r\n\r\nIn the full-grown caterpillar, besides the brain there are _eleven_\r\nganglions, the chords of the four first internodes being double, and\r\nthe rest single: from each ganglion proceed two pairs of nerves, one\r\nfrom each side. In this the lobes of the brain form an angle with\r\neach other[123]. In two days the double chords mutually recede, so\r\nas to diminish the interval between the ganglions, and the single\r\nones have become curved: thus the length of the spinal marrow is\r\nshortened about a _fourth_, and the fourth and fifth ganglions\r\nhave made an approach to each other[124]. On the eighth day, when\r\nthe insect has assumed the pupa but remains still in the skin of\r\nthe caterpillar, the flexure of the internodes is much increased;\r\nthe first ganglion is now united to the brain, and the fourth and\r\nfifth have joined each other, though they are still distinct; the\r\nspinal marrow has now lost considerably more than a _third_ of\r\nits length[125]. On the fourteenth day, the internodes, except the\r\ndouble ones, have become nearly straight again; the fourth and\r\nfifth ganglions have coalesced so as to form one, and the sixth and\r\nseventh have each lost their pairs of nerves[126]. Shortly after\r\nthis, these last ganglions have nearly disappeared, and the chords\r\nof the three first internodes have again approached each other[127].\r\nThe next change exhibited is the absorption of the first ganglion by\r\nthe brain, the union of the chords of the first internode, which is\r\nnow straight, the approximation of the second and third ganglions,\r\nand the enlargement of the one formed by the union of the fourth\r\nand fifth, at the expense perhaps of the sixth and seventh, which\r\nhave now intirely disappeared, and in their place is a very long\r\ninternode. These united ganglions retain the pairs of nerves they\r\nhad when separate[128]. Just before the assumption of the _imago_,\r\nthe direction of the lobes of the brain becomes horizontal, the\r\nsecond and third ganglions unite, and the internode between the third\r\nand fourth is shortened[129]. Lastly, when the animal is become a\r\nbutterfly, the second and third ganglions have coalesced, and are\r\njoined to that formed by the union of the fourth and fifth; a short\r\nisthmus or rather constriction, with an orifice, being their only\r\nseparation: each of these united ganglions send forth laterally four\r\npairs of nerves[130]. In his figure, Dr. Herold has not represented\r\nthe orifice for the passage of the gullet, but doubtless one exists,\r\nwhich for an animal that imbibes only fluid food is probably very\r\nminute. In _Hypogymna dispar_, we learn from Cuvier, this orifice is\r\nof that description, and of a triangular shape[131].\r\n\r\nIt can admit of no reasonable doubt that one of the principal\r\nintentions of these changes is to accommodate the nervous system to\r\nthe altered functions of the animal in its new stage of existence,\r\nin which the antennæ, eyes, and other organs of the senses, as well\r\nas the limbs and muscles moving them, and the sexual organs, being\r\nvery different from those of the larva, and if not wholly new, yet\r\nexpanded from minute germs to their full size, may well demand\r\ncorresponding changes in the structure of the nervous system by which\r\nthey are acted upon.\r\n\r\nBut are these changes also concerned, as Dr. Virey conjectures,\r\nin producing that remarkable alteration which usually takes place\r\nbetween the _instincts_ of the larva and imago? In order to answer\r\nthis question, it will be requisite first to quote the ingenious\r\nillustration with which this able physiologist elucidates his ideas\r\non this point. \"The more readily,\" he observes, \"to comprehend\r\nthe action of instinct, let us compare the insect to one of those\r\nhand-organs in which a revolving cylinder presents different tunes\r\nnoted at its surface, and pressing the keys of the pipes of the\r\norgan, gives birth to all the tones of a song: if the tune is to\r\nbe changed, the cylinder must be pulled out or pushed in one or\r\nmore notches, to present other notes to the keys. In the same\r\nmanner let us suppose that nature has impressed or engraved certain\r\ndeterminations or notes of action, fixed in a determinate series\r\nin the nervous system and the ganglions of the caterpillar, by\r\nwhich alone she lives, she will act according to a certain sequence\r\nof operations; and, so to speak, she will sing the air engraven\r\nwithin her. When she undergoes her metamorphosis into a butterfly,\r\nher nervous system being, if I may so express myself, pulled out a\r\nnotch, like the cylinder, will present the notes of another tune,\r\nanother series of instinctive operations; and the animal will even\r\nfind itself as perfectly instructed and as capable of employing its\r\nnew organs, as it was to use the old ones. The relations will be the\r\nsame; it will always be the play of the instrument[132].\"\r\n\r\nThis illustration is doubtless at the first glance very striking and\r\nplausible: but a closer examination will, I think, show, that, as\r\nin so many other instances in metaphysical reasoning, when fanciful\r\nanalogies are substituted for a rigid adherence to stubborn facts, it\r\nis satisfactory only on a superficial view, and will not stand the test\r\nof investigation; and as this is a question intimately connected with\r\nwhat I have advanced on the subject of instinct in a former letter, I\r\nmust be permitted to go somewhat into detail in considering it.\r\n\r\nTo prove his position, Dr. Virey ought at least to be able to show\r\nthat, whenever a change takes place in the instincts of insects in\r\ntheir different states of larva and imago, a corresponding change\r\ntakes place in the external structure of the nervous chord. But what\r\nare the facts? In three whole orders, viz. _Orthoptera Hemiptera_,\r\nand _Neuroptera_, as mentioned above[133], the structure of the\r\nnervous chord is _not_ changed; and yet we know that many tribes\r\nof these orders acquire instincts in their imago state altogether\r\ndifferent from those which directed them in their state of larvæ. A\r\nperfect _Locust_, for instance, acquires the new instincts of using\r\nits wings; of undertaking those distant migrations of which so many\r\nremarkable instances were laid before you in a former letter[134];\r\nand, if a female, of depositing its eggs in an appropriate situation.\r\nBut if such striking changes in the instinct of these tribes can be\r\neffected without any perceptible alteration in the structure of the\r\nnervous chord, it is contrary to the received rules of philosophical\r\ninduction to refer to this alteration the changes in the instincts of\r\nother tribes where it is found. Is it not far more probable that this\r\nalteration has in fact no connexion with the changes of instinct,\r\nbut is solely concerned with those remarkable changes in the organs\r\nof sense and motion, which occur in the larva and imago states\r\nof the orders in which it is observed? In a common caterpillar,\r\nthe form of the body, the legs, the eyes, and other organs of the\r\nsenses, all strikingly differ from those of the imago; whereas, with\r\nthe exception of the acquisition of new wings, a perfect locust\r\ndiffers little from its larva: so that we may reasonably expect a\r\ncorresponding change, such as we find it, in the structure of the\r\nnervous chord of the lepidopterous insect, not called for in that of\r\nthe neuropterous species, in which accordingly it does not take place.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning, in opposition to Dr. Virey's theory, that the changes\r\nof instinct depend on the altered structure of the nervous system,\r\nbecomes greatly strengthened when we advert to the higher classes of\r\nanimals, which surely in any investigation of the nature of instinct\r\nought to be closely kept in view; for the faculty, though often less\r\nperfect in them than in insects, is still of the _same kind_, and may\r\nconsequently be expected to follow the same general laws. In a young\r\nswallow, for example, all its instincts are not developed at once any\r\nmore than in an insect. The instinct which leads it to migrate does\r\nnot appear for some months after its birth, and that of building a\r\nnest still later. But we have not the slightest ground for believing\r\nthat these new instincts are preceded by any change in the structure\r\nof the great sympathetic nerve, or of any other portion of the\r\nnervous system: and the same may be said as to the sexual instincts\r\ndeveloped in quadrupeds some years subsequent to their birth. If,\r\nthen, these remarkable changes in the instinct of the higher classes\r\nof animals can take place independently of any visible change in the\r\nnerves, what substantial reason can be assigned why they may not also\r\nin the class of insects?\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think you will agree with me, that there is nothing\r\nin Dr. Virey's hypothesis which should lead me to alter the opinion\r\nI have already so strongly expressed in a former letter[135],\r\nas to the insufficiency of the mechanical theories of instinct\r\nhitherto promulgated, adequately to explain _all_ the phenomena;\r\nand unless they do this they are evidently of small value. Such\r\ntheories as I have there adverted to may often seem to be supported\r\nby a few insulated facts, but with others, far more numerous, they\r\nare utterly at variance; and, to omit many other instances, I am\r\nstrongly inclined to doubt the possibility of satisfactorily\r\nexplaining the _variety_ of instincts exercised by a bee[136], or the\r\n_extraordinary_ development of new ones in particular circumstances\r\nonly[137], on any merely mechanical grounds.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, even suppose it could be demonstratively shown that\r\n_every_ instinct is as clearly dependent on secondary causes, as I have\r\nformerly admitted that _some_ doubtless seem to be, yet what would\r\nthis teach us as to the essential nature of instinct? We have advanced\r\nindeed a step; but still, as I have before observed in referring to the\r\ntheories of Brown and Tucker, we have only placed the world upon the\r\ntortoise, and instinct, as to its _essence_, which is what we want to\r\ndetect, is as mysterious as ever: just as, though we can clearly prove\r\nthat the mind is acted upon by the senses, yet this throws no light\r\nupon the essential nature of the mind, which we are forced to admit\r\nis inscrutable, as if to teach us humility, and prevent our vainly\r\nfancying, that though allowed to discover some of the arcana of nature,\r\nwe shall ever be able to penetrate into her inmost sanctuaries.\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Virey should regard instinct in insects as purely mechanical\r\nwas the natural consequence of his denying them any portion of\r\nintellect; but his opinion cannot I think be consistently assented\r\nto, if it be the fact, as I have just shown[138], that they are not\r\nwholly devoid of the intellectual principle. Whatever is merely\r\nmechanical, must, under similar circumstances, always act precisely\r\nin the same way. An automaton once constructed, whilst its machinery\r\nremains in order, will invariably perform the same actions; and Des\r\nCartes, when he had constructed his celebrated female automaton,\r\nimagined that he had irrefragably proved his principle, that brutes\r\nare mere machines. But if, instead of losing himself in the wilds\r\nof metaphysical speculation, he had soberly attended to facts, he\r\nwould have seen that the instinct of animals can be modified and\r\ncounteracted by their intellect, and consequently cannot be regarded\r\nas simply mechanical. Though the instinctive impulse of an empty\r\nstomach powerfully impel a dog to gratify his appetite, yet, if\r\nhe be well tutored, the fear of correction will make him abstain\r\nfrom the most tempting dainties: and in like manner a bee will quit\r\nthe nectary of a flower, however amply replenished with sweets, if\r\nalarmed by any interruption. The ants on which Buonaparte amused\r\nhimself with experiments at St. Helena, though they stormed his\r\nsugar-basin when defended by a fosse of water, controlled their\r\ninstinct and desisted when it was surrounded with vinegar[139]: and\r\nin the remarkable instance communicated to Dr. Leach by Sir Joseph\r\nBanks, the instinct of a crippled spider so completely changed,\r\nthat from a sedentary web-weaver it became a hunter[140]. There is\r\nevidently, therefore, no analogy between actions strictly mechanical\r\nand instincts, which, though they may often seem to be excited by\r\nmechanical causes, are liable to be restrained or modified by the\r\nconnexion of the instinctive and intellectual faculties[141]; and\r\nwhile we are ignorant how this connexion takes place, it is obviously\r\nimpossible to reason logically on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn thus denying that any existing _mechanical_ theory of instinct\r\nis satisfactory, I by no means intend to assert that instinct is\r\npurely _intellectual_. I have already given you my opinion[142],\r\nthat it is not the effect of any immediate agency of the Deity; nor\r\nam I prepared to assent to the doctrine of a writer, who has in some\r\nrespects written ably on the subject in question, who says, that \"the\r\nDivine Energy does in reality act not _immediately_, but _mediately_,\r\nor through the medium of _moral_ and _intellectual influences_ upon\r\nthe nature or consciousness of the creature, in the production of\r\nthe various, and in many instances truly wonderful, actions which\r\nthey perform[143].\" The same objection applies to this as to so many\r\nother metaphysical theories, that it is not adequately supported by\r\n_facts_; and all theories not so supported are injurious to science\r\nin proportion as their plausibility is greater, by leading the\r\nstudent to relax in that observation of nature and attentive study\r\nof the instincts of animals, on which alone sound hypothesis on this\r\nsubject can be ultimately founded.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude these remarks on the nature of instinct with a few\r\nobservations as to the circumstances in which insects may be supposed\r\nto be guided by this faculty, and those in which _intellect_ seems\r\nto direct them. The bee, when it takes its flight to a field where\r\nflowers abound, is governed by intellect in the use of its senses;\r\nfor these are given to it as _guides_: and when it arrives there,\r\nthey direct it to the flowers, and enable it to ascertain which\r\ncontains the treasures it is in search of; but having made this\r\ndiscovery, its instinct teaches it to imbibe the nectar and load its\r\nhind legs with pollen.--Again: its senses, aided by memory, enable\r\nit to retrace its way to the hive, where instinct once more impels\r\nit in its various operations. So that when we ascribe a certain\r\ndegree of intellect to these animals, we do not place them upon a\r\npar with man; since all the most wonderful parts of their economy,\r\nand those manipulations that exceed all our powers, we admit not\r\nto be the contrivance of the animals themselves, but the necessary\r\nresults of faculties implanted in their constitution at the first\r\ncreation by their MAKER. I may further repeat, that the mere fact of\r\nbeing endowed with the external organs of sense, proves a certain\r\ndegree of intellect in insects. For if in all their actions they were\r\ndirected merely by their instinct, they might do as well without\r\nsight, hearing, smell, touch, &c. but having these senses and their\r\norgans, it seems to me a necessary consequence, that they must have a\r\nsufficient degree of intellect, memory, and judgement, to enable them\r\nadvantageously to employ them.\r\n\r\nThere is this difference between intellect in man, and the rest of\r\nthe animal creation. Their intellect teaches them to follow the lead\r\nof their senses, and make such use of the external world as their\r\nappetites or instincts incline them to,--and _this is their wisdom_;\r\nwhile the intellect of man, being associated with an immortal\r\nprinciple, and being in connexion with a world above that which his\r\nsenses reveal to him, can, by aid derived from heaven, control those\r\nsenses, and bring under his instinctive appetites, so as to render\r\nthem obedient to the το ἡγεμονικον, or governing power of his nature:\r\nAND THIS IS HIS WISDOM.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Το Ἡγεμονικον.\r\n\r\n[2] See Hooper's _Medical Dictionary_, under _Nervous Fluid_, and Mr.\r\nSandwith's useful _Introduction to Anatomy and Physiology_, 83.\r\n\r\n[3] _N.

But the microscopic and anatomical observations of\r\nMalpighi, Swammerdam and Lyonet, and the experiments of more modern\r\nphysiologists, have incontestably proved that insects are provided with\r\nrespiratory organs, and that the respiration of air is as necessary\r\nto them as to other animals. They can exist indeed for a time in\r\nirrespirable air; and immersion in hydrogen or carbonic acid gases is\r\nnot, as I have often ascertained, so instantly fatal to them as it\r\nwould be to vertebrate animals; but like them, they speedily perish in\r\nair altogether deprived of its oxygen, or placed in situations to which\r\nall access to this essential element is excluded. Their respiration\r\ntoo of atmospheric air produces the same change in it with that of the\r\nvertebrate animals, the oxygen disappearing, and carbonic acid gas\r\nbeing produced in its place. Boyle had long since ascertained, that\r\nwhen bees, flies, and other insects were placed under an exhausted\r\nreceiver, they often perished[146]: and the same effect was even\r\nobserved by the ancients to ensue, when their bodies were by any means\r\ncovered with oil or grease, which necessarily closed the orifices of\r\ntheir respiratory organs[147].\r\n\r\nBut for the first series of experiments ascertaining the necessity of\r\na supply of air to insects, and their conversion of it into carbonic\r\nacid, we are indebted to the illustrious Scheele[148]; and his\r\nexperiments have been repeated and confirmed by Spallanzani, Vauquelin,\r\nand other chemists. The former found, that when caterpillars and\r\nmaggots were confined in vessels containing only about eleven cubic\r\ninches of atmospheric air, though furnished with sufficient food,\r\nthey soon died, and sooner when the space was more confined[149]. He\r\nascertained too, that a larva weighing only a few grains consumed, in\r\na given time, as much oxygen as an amphibious animal a thousand times\r\nas voluminous[150]. A male grasshopper (_Acrida viridissima_) in six\r\ncubic inches of oxygen lived but eighteen hours, and the female placed\r\nin eight cubic inches of atmospheric air, only thirty-six hours. The\r\nusual tests in both instances detected the conversion of the oxygen\r\npresent into carbonic acid[151]. Precisely the same result was obtained\r\nby Sorg and Ellis, who, having placed a number of flies in nine cubic\r\ninches of atmospheric air, found them all dead by the third day, the\r\noxygen intirely vanished, and a quantity of carbonic acid nearly equal\r\nin bulk produced[152].\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained too, that insects like other animals require in\r\nthe process of respiration not merely oxygen, but such a mixture of\r\nit with nitrogen or azote as composes atmospheric air: for Vauquelin\r\nfound that a grasshopper placed in six cubic inches of oxygen lived\r\nonly half as long (eighteen hours) as another placed in eight\r\ninches of atmospheric air; its breathing was much more laborious,\r\nand it died when not more than one-twentieth of the oxygen had\r\nbeen converted into carbonic acid[153]. That a large quantity of\r\n_oxygen_ penetrates all parts of insects, is evident also from the\r\n_acid_ prevalent in the fluids of most of them, as likewise from the\r\nwonderful power of their muscles. That _azote_ is also received,\r\nseems probable from the _ammonia_ which has been extracted from the\r\nfluids of many, and from the rapid putrescence of these animals[154].\r\n\r\nThe mode, however, in which the respiration of insects is carried on,\r\ndiffers greatly from that which obtains in the higher animals. They\r\nhave no lungs, no organs confined to a particular part of the body,\r\nby means of which the whole of the blood is regularly exposed to the\r\naction of the inspired air. They do not breathe through the _mouth_,\r\nbut through numerous orifices called _spiracles_, and the respiratory\r\nvessels connected with these are conducted to every part of the\r\nbody. In some indeed, that we have included under the denomination\r\nof insects, as the _Arachnida_, an approach is made to the branchial\r\nrespiration of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe respiratory apparatus of insects may be considered under\r\n_two_ principal heads:--viz. the orifices or spiracles, and other\r\n_external_ organs by which the air is alternately received and\r\nexpelled; and the _internal_ ones, by which it is distributed. Each\r\nof these is well worthy of your attention.\r\n\r\nI. The _external_ respiratory organs of insects may be divided into\r\n_three_ kinds. _Spiracles_; _Respiratory plates_; and _branchiform_\r\nand _other pneumatic appendages_.\r\n\r\ni. _Spiracles_[155] (_Spiracula_), or breathing pores, are small\r\norifices in the trunk or abdomen of insects, opening into the\r\n_tracheæ_, by which the air enters the body, or is expelled from\r\nit[156]. They may be considered principally as to their _composition_\r\nand _substance_; _shape_; _colour_; _magnitude_; _situation_; and\r\n_number_.\r\n\r\n1. _Composition_ and _substance_. Perhaps you may not be aware that\r\nthe structure of these minute apertures is not so simple as at the\r\nfirst view it may seem; but when you recollect that by them the insect\r\n_breathes_, you will suspect that provision may be made for their\r\nopening and shutting. A spiracle therefore, speaking analogically,\r\nmay be regarded in numerous cases as a _mouth_ closed by _lips_. In\r\ncaterpillars and many other insects, the substance of the crust where\r\nit surrounds the spiracle, is elevated so as to form a ring round it.\r\nThe lips, properly speaking, are formed of a single cartilaginous\r\npiece or platform, with a central longitudinal cleft or opening, when\r\nclosed often extending the whole length of the piece[157]; but in some\r\nappearing always open and circular: of the former description are those\r\ncovered by the elytra in the common cockchafer; and of the latter,\r\nthose that are not so covered: in some, as in the antepectoral pair of\r\nthe mole-cricket, there appear to be no lips, the orifice being merely\r\nclosed with hairs[158]. Though the aperture is usually in the middle\r\nof the platform, in the female of _Dytiscus marginalis_, it is nearer\r\nthe posterior side, the anterior or upper lip being the longest. In the\r\nmajority, the mouth or cleft is nearly as long as the spiracle; yet in\r\nthe puss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_) it is shorter[159]. Some spiracles,\r\nhowever, are unilabiate, or have only _one_ lip. This is the case with\r\n_Gonyleptes_ and perhaps others[160]. The lips are usually horizontal,\r\nbut sometimes they dip so as to make the spiracle appear open.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _substance_ of these organs, it is more or less\r\ncartilaginous, and probably elastic; the surface frequently appears\r\nto be corrugate or plaited; this is very distinctly seen in the\r\nstag-beetle and the cockchafer: in the last insect, under a powerful\r\nmagnifier, we are told that the lips appear to consist of parallel\r\ncartilaginous processes, separated by a cellular web[161]. In some\r\nspecies of _Copris_ the corrugations form a perplexed labyrinth;\r\nin the caterpillar of the puss-moth the plaits are so narrow as\r\nto look like rays[162]; and in some _Dynastidæ_ the lips approach\r\nto a lamellated structure. Again, in _Hydrophilus caraboides_ the\r\n_upper_ lip, and in _Dytiscus circumflexus_, _both_ lips seem formed\r\nof elegant plumes[163]: a similar ornament distinguishes the inner\r\nedge of the lips in the caterpillar of the great goat-moth (_Cossus\r\nligniperda_) and others[164]. In the grub of the rhinoceros-beetle\r\n(_Oryctes nasicornis_) the margin of the lower or inner lip is\r\ndecorated by pinnated rays, which enter the cellular membrane that\r\ncovers the upper lip[165]: in this larva, and that likewise of the\r\ncockchafer, the two lips are formed of different substances; in\r\nthe last the upper or outer one consists of a perforated cellular\r\nmembrane, through which the air can pass, while the lower or inner\r\none is a cartilaginous valve that closes the orifice[166]: in\r\nthe former this valve is surmounted by a boss[167]. In the pupa\r\nof _Smerinthus Populi_, a hawk-moth not uncommon, and of some\r\ndragon-flies (_Libellula depressa_), the margin of the two lips is\r\ncrenated, probably with notches which alternate, that the mouth\r\nof the spiracle may shut more accurately[168]. The substance is\r\nunusually thick in the spinose caterpillars of butterflies; and in\r\nthe pupa of one, _Uria Proteus_, it is villose.\r\n\r\nUnder the present head I may observe, that in some cases, as in the\r\npuss-moth, and the larva of the common water-beetle (_Dytiscus\r\nmarginalis_), the spiracles are closed by a semifluid substance,\r\nwhich however, according to Sprengel, is permeable to the air[169].\r\nThe animal, where these organs are furnished with lips, has\r\ndoubtless, by means of a muscular apparatus, the power of _opening_\r\nand _shutting_ them: this is done, we are told, by elevating and\r\ndepressing, or rather by contracting and relaxing them. Sorg counted\r\nin one case (_Oryctes nasicornis_) _twenty_, and in another (_Acrida\r\nviridissima_) _fifty_, of these motions to take place in little\r\nmore than _two_ minutes[170]: but the quickness and force of this\r\nmotion is not always uniform; for the same physiologist observed,\r\nthat in _Carabus auratus_, when feeding or moving its body rapidly,\r\nthe contraction of the spiracles took place at very short intervals;\r\nbut when it was fasting, and its motions were slow, the intervals\r\nwere longer[171]: it is probable also, that the temperature may\r\naccelerate or retard the motion. In the summer I examined a specimen\r\nof _Phyllopertha horticola_, that had indeed been somewhat injured,\r\nwith this view: the pulses of the abdomen, which alternately rose\r\nand fell, were at about the rate of the pulse of a man in health,\r\nsixty in a minute, and the spiracles appeared to me to keep pace with\r\nthis motion: later in the year, when the temperature was lower, as\r\nI was walking, I took a specimen of some grasshopper (_Locusta_).\r\nUpon viewing it under a lens, I observed one of the convex pectoral\r\nspiracles open and shut, and the interval between two breathings\r\nappeared nearly half a minute.\r\n\r\n2. With regard to their _shape_, spiracles vary considerably. In\r\ngeneral we may observe that the abdominal ones are usually flat,\r\nwhile those of the trunk are often convex[172]. Sometimes they are\r\nvery narrow and nearly linear, as in many pupæ of _Lepidoptera_,\r\nand those in the _metathorax_ of the sand-wasps (_Ammophila_) and\r\naffinities; at others they are wider and nearly elliptical, as in\r\n_Lucanus_ and many Lamellicorn beetles: again, in _Copris_ they are\r\ncircular; in _Cordylia Palmarum_ ovate; in _Dytiscus_ oblong[173]; in\r\n_Goerius olens_ lunulate; in _Gonyleptes_ nearly of the shape of a\r\nhorse-shoe[174]; and probably many other forms might be traced, if a\r\nthorough investigation with this view were undertaken.\r\n\r\n3. The _colour_ of spiracles will not detain us long. In the\r\ncaterpillars of _Lepidoptera_ this is often so contrasted with that\r\nof the rest of the body, as to produce a striking and pleasing\r\neffect. Thus when the body is of a _dark_ colour, they are usually of\r\na _pale_ one[175]; or if the body is _pale_, they are _dark_[176],\r\nor surrounded with a dark ring[177]. This contrast is often rendered\r\nmore striking by their position with regard to the partial colours\r\nthat often ornament caterpillars: in those whose sides are decorated\r\nby a longitudinal stripe, the spiracles are often planted in it[178];\r\nor just above it[179]; or between two[180]: in some hawkmoths the\r\nintermediate ones are set in white or pale spots, which gives great\r\nlife to the appearance of the animal. In general, in perfect insects\r\nthe most prevalent colour is buff, or reddish-yellow. In the larva\r\nof the great water-beetle these organs resemble the iris of the eye,\r\nbeing circular with concentric rings alternately pale and dark[181].\r\n\r\n4. The _size_ of spiracles varies considerably. Those in the larva\r\nlast mentioned are so minute as to be scarcely visible except under a\r\nlens, while those behind the fore-legs in the mole-cricket are a full\r\nline in length, and those in the _pleura_ of _Acrocinus accentifer_, a\r\nBrazilian Capricorn beetle, are more than twice as long. In the same\r\nspecies they are often found of different sizes;--thus the _anal_ pairs\r\nin the water-beetle lately alluded to, I mean in the perfect insect,\r\nare much larger than the rest[182], probably that the animal may imbibe\r\na larger quantity of air when it rises to the surface of the water,\r\nwhere it suspends itself by the _tail_. In those Lamellicorn beetles in\r\nwhich the terminal part of the abdomen is not protected by the elytra,\r\nthe _covered_ spiracles are the largest.\r\n\r\n5. Under the next head, the _situation_ of spiracles, I shall not\r\nonly consider the part of the body in which they are situated, but\r\nlikewise their _position_ in the crust; to which last, as it will not\r\ndetain us long, I shall first call your attention. Their position in\r\nthis respect is most commonly _oblique_: but in the abdomen of the\r\nabove water-beetle they are _transverse_, and in a larva I possess,\r\nprobably of an _Elater_, they are _longitudinal_. In spinose\r\ncaterpillars these organs are generally planted between two spines,\r\none being above and the other below. The _lateral_ line of the body\r\nmost commonly marks their situation; but in many cases they become\r\n_ventral_, and in others _dorsal_. The most important circumstance,\r\nhowever, connected with the present head is their appropriation to\r\nparticular segments or parts of the body, for, like the ganglions of\r\nthe spinal marrow, they are distributed to almost every segment. Let\r\nus take a summary view of their arrangement in this respect.\r\n\r\nNo insect has any spiracle in the _head_; but in caterpillars and many\r\nother _larvæ_ there is a pair in the _first_ segment of the trunk. This\r\nis also to be found in the other states, but is not easily detected in\r\nthe _pupæ_ of _Lepidoptera_: in the _Coleoptera_ order, in the grub\r\nof the Lamellicorn beetles, it is extremely conspicuous, and planted\r\nin the side of the first segment[183]; in other Coleopterous grubs\r\nit is not so readily found, but probably its station is somewhere\r\nbehind the base of the arms, where it is very visible in that of\r\nthe _Staphylinidæ_. In the _imago_ of insects of this order, this\r\nantepectoral spiracle has been overlooked, and indeed is not soon\r\ndiscovered: to see it clearly, the manitrunk should be separated from\r\nthe alitrunk; and then if you examine the _lower_ side of the cavity,\r\nyou will see a pair of, usually, large spiracles planted just above\r\nthe arms, in the ligament that unites these two parts of the trunk to\r\neach other: in the common rove-beetle, however, (_Goerius olens_)you\r\nmay easily see it without dissection[184]. In the _Orthoptera_ it is\r\nsituated behind the arms, as in _Gryllotalpa_: or between them and\r\nthe _prothorax_, as in _Blatta_: in the _Hemiptera_ and _Neuroptera_\r\nprobably the situation is not very different. In the _Lepidoptera_\r\nthis pair of spiracles is planted just before the base of the upper or\r\nprimary wings[185]: a similar situation, I suspect, is appropriated to\r\nit in the _Trichoptera_, but covered by a tubercle or scale. Something\r\nsimilar has been noticed by M. Chabrier, in the same situation and\r\ncircumstances, in the collar of _Hymenoptera_[186]. In numerous\r\n_Diptera_ this breathing pore is planted on each side between the\r\ncollar and the _dorsolum_ above the arms[187], and in _Hippobosca_ in\r\nthe collar itself[188].\r\n\r\nIn _Lepidopterous_, _Coleopterous_, and some other larvæ, the\r\ntwo segments of the body corresponding with the alitrunk in the\r\nperfect insect, are without spiracles, neither have they in this\r\nstate, though pneumatic organs have been discovered[189], any real\r\nones in that part: but not so the _remaining_ orders, all of which\r\nhave these organs in that section of the trunk. To begin with the\r\n_Orthoptera_:--in _Blatta_ there seems to be a long narrow one\r\nbehind the intermediate leg; in the _Gryllotalpa_ there is one in\r\nthe posterior part of the _pleura_; and in _Locusta_, above both the\r\nintermediate and hind legs[190]. It is probable, that in general\r\nthose that have _no_ spiracles in the manitrunk have _four_ in the\r\nalitrunk, which seems the natural number belonging to the trunk.\r\nIn many of the Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ in the _parapleura_\r\nthere is an open spiracle without lips[191], to which, as in that\r\nbeautiful bug _Scutellera Stockeri_, a channel sometimes leads. The\r\nspace in which this spiracle is planted in other genera of bugs\r\n(_Pentatoma_ &c.) is covered with a kind of membranous skin, often\r\nmuch corrugated[192]. In the aquatic insects of this section, and\r\nmany terrestrial ones, as _Reduvius_, &c. this spiracle is obsolete.\r\nThere is another circumstance, possibly connected with their\r\nrespiration, relating to many of the bugs, which may be mentioned\r\nhere. If you examine _Pentatoma rufipes_, a very common one, you will\r\nfind between the _scapula_ and _parapleura_ a long orifice or chink;\r\nthis upon a closer inspection, under a good magnifier, you will see\r\ncompletely filled with minute stiff hairs or bristles, which fringe\r\nthe posterior margin of the _scapula_[193]. In a Brazilian species of\r\n_Lygæus_ (_sexmaculatus_ K. M. S.) with incrassated posterior thighs,\r\nthese hairs are replaced by lamellæ which have the aspect of _gills_.\r\nA red, vertical, convex spiracle, with its orifice towards the head,\r\nand terminating posteriorly in a kind of conical sac, is situated\r\ntowards the hinder part of the _pleura_ in the giant water-scorpion\r\n(_Belostoma grandis_[194]); this seems analogous to one lately\r\nmentioned in the mole cricket. In the other section of this Order it\r\nis not easy to decipher the parts of the under side of the alitrunk.\r\nIn _Fulgora_, _Cicada_, and many others of its genera, there appears\r\nto be more than one opening into the chest; but whether they are of a\r\npneumatic nature or not, can only be ascertained by an inspection of\r\nthe living animal. There is a very visible spiracle over each of the\r\nfour last legs of the _Libellulina_[195], but in the remainder of the\r\n_Neuroptera_ Order they have eluded my search. In the _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_ they are nearly in the same situation, being placed\r\nbehind the wings on each side of the _metathorax_; in the latter\r\nOrder with the poiser near them on the inner side[196]: in this also,\r\nthe spiracles of the _trunk_ are without _lips_, except in the larvæ,\r\nbut are often merely an orifice, sometimes fringed with hairs; this\r\nis particularly conspicuous in _Syrphus_, in which these orifices are\r\nvery large, and in some species closed by an elegant double fringe\r\nof white hairs. This is doubtless to prevent the entrance of any\r\nparticles of dust or the like.\r\n\r\nWe are next to consider the situation of the spiracles of the\r\n_abdomen_: these which are supposed to be appropriated exclusively\r\nto _inspiration_, are usually more numerous than those of the\r\ntrunk, by which it is probable that _expiration_ is performed, and\r\nhave principally attracted the notice of Entomologists: they are\r\neither dorsal, lateral, or ventral. In _Dytiscus_, _Copris_, &c.\r\namongst the beetles, all the spiracles are _dorsal_; in the larvæ\r\nof _Coleoptera_ and _Lepidoptera_ they are _lateral_; and in the\r\nHeteropterous _Hemiptera_ they are usually _ventral_: in _Dynastes_\r\nthey are commonly found of all three descriptions;--the _three_\r\nfirst being _dorsal_, the _two_ next _lateral_, and the _last_\r\npair _ventral_[197]. In some instances, as in _Perga Kirbii_, and\r\nprobably other _Hymenoptera_, these organs are planted in that\r\nportion of the dorsal segment which turns under, as was observed\r\nin a former letter[198], and becomes ventral. Generally there is\r\na _pair_ of spiracles to _each_ segment, and in those insects that\r\nhave a hypochondriack joint[199] there is often a spiracle in it.\r\nThe last segment of the abdomen is always without these orifices,\r\nas is the basal one in _Velia_, _Ranatra_, and some other bugs. A\r\nsingular anomaly distinguishes the _Libellulina_: they appear to\r\nhave no _abdominal_ spiracles[200], yet I have seen the abdomen of\r\n_Libellula depressa_ when reposing, contract and dilate alternately,\r\nfrom whence it follows that this part is concerned in respiration.\r\nSprengel says that the larvæ in this tribe have seven or nine on\r\neach side[201], and Reaumur speaks of them as discoverable in the\r\npupa[202]. I have carefully examined the pupa-skin of most of the\r\ngenera of _Libellulina_, under a powerful magnifier, but have not\r\nsucceeded in discovering any thing like these organs in the abdomen.\r\nThe _Ephemera_ and probably the other _Neuroptera_ have abdominal\r\nspiracles[203]. M. Latreille observed one on each side of the base\r\nof the scale on the footstalk of the abdomen in ants[204]. Generally\r\nthe abdominal spiracles may be described as planted in the _crust_\r\nof the insect; but in many cases their station is in the membranous\r\nfolds, which I have therefore named the _pulmonarium_, that sometimes\r\nseparate the dorsal from the ventral segments: these folds allow\r\nof a considerable distention of the abdomen, which is probably\r\nnecessary when all the air-vessels are full. In a gravid _Ichneumon_\r\nI once saw it enlarged to more than twice its natural size by\r\nmeans of this membrane, through which the eggs were distinctly\r\nvisible.--Before I bid adieu to this subject, I must say a few words\r\nupon the situation of the organs in question in the _myriapods_. In\r\n_Iulus_, in each segment is a pair of orifices which have usually\r\nbeen regarded as spiracles, but M. Savi found that these orifices\r\nopened into vesicles containing a fetid fluid, and upon a very close\r\nexamination he discovered the real spiracles above the base of the\r\nlegs, in connexion with _tracheæ_[205]. In some of the larger species\r\nof _Scolopendræ_ large open spiracles in the same situation are\r\nextremely visible[206]. _Cermatia_ presents a singular anomaly:--a\r\nsingle series of spiracles of the usual form, each planted in a cleft\r\nof the posterior margin of the dorsal _scuta_, runs along the back\r\nof the animal[207]: unless we may suppose that, like the seeming\r\nspiracles of _Iulus_ just mentioned, these are merely orifices by\r\nwhich it covers itself with some secretion.\r\n\r\n6. A few words upon the _number_ of spiracles.--If you examine the\r\ncommon dog-tick (_Ixodes Ricinus_), you will find only _one_ of these\r\norgans on each side of the abdomen[208]; the _Libellulina_, as we\r\nhave seen, have only _four_, all in the trunk; in the _Dynastidæ_,\r\n_Melolontha_, and the larva of _Dytiscus_, there are _fourteen_;\r\n_sixteen_ in the _Copridæ_; _eighteen_ in _Dytiscus_, and probably the\r\nmajority of _Coleoptera_, both larva and imago, and _Lepidoptera_; and\r\na pair to each segment except the last, in the _Myriapods_.\r\n\r\nii. _Respiratory plates_ (_Respiratoria_). The nearest approach to\r\nspiracles is made by those remarkable plates that are found in such\r\nlarvæ of _Diptera_, as in that state inhabit substances that might\r\nimpede or altogether stop the entrance or exit of the air by the\r\nordinary spiracles, such as dead or living flesh, dung, or the like.\r\nThe CREATOR therefore, as he has seen it good for wise reasons[209] to\r\ncommission certain insects to feed on unclean food, has fitted them for\r\nthe offices that devolve upon them, and has placed their orifices for\r\nbreathing in plates at each extremity of the body. There are usually\r\ntwo of these plates at the head, and two at the tail. In the grub of\r\nthe common flesh-fly (_Sarcophaga carnaria_), at the junction of the\r\nfirst segment of the body with the second, two of these plates are\r\nplanted, which are concave and circular, with a denticulated margin; in\r\nthe cavity near the lower side is a round spiracle. These plates the\r\nanimal can withdraw within the body, so as to prevent this spiracle\r\nfrom being stopped up by any greasy substance[210]. The posterior\r\nextremity of this grub is truncated, and has a large and deep cavity\r\nsurrounded by several fleshy prominences: at the bottom of this are\r\ntwo oval brown plates, in each of which are _three_ oval spiracles,\r\nplaced obliquely: by the contraction of the fleshy prominences, this\r\ncavity also can be closed at the will of the animal[211]. In some\r\ncases, several stiff rays or spines replace the prominences[212].\r\nIn _Echinomyia grossa_ and others the anal plates appear not to be\r\nperforated, being surmounted only by a central boss[213]; but this,\r\nmost probably, as in the case of _Œstrus Ovis_[214], is a _valve_\r\nthat closes the respiratory orifices. In the gad-fly of the ox (_Œ.\r\nBovis_) there are no plates at the _anterior_ extremity of the body;\r\nbut those planted in the _other_ end are very remarkable, and demand\r\nparticular attention. Each is separated by a curved line into two\r\nunequal portions; the smallest of which is contiguous to the convex\r\nbelly, and the largest to the concave back of the animal. This\r\nlast is distinguished by two hard, brown, kidney-shaped pieces, a\r\nlittle elevated with the concave sides turned towards each other: in\r\nthis sinus is a _single_, small, white spot, which appears to be a\r\nspiracle: in the smallest portion are _eight_ minute circular orifices,\r\narranged in a line[215]. As the only communication which this grub has\r\nwith the atmosphere is at its _anal_ extremity, it has no occasion\r\nfor respiratory organs at the _other_. The gad-fly of the horse\r\n(_Gasterophilus Equi_, &c.) which has no communication at all with the\r\nexternal air, breathing that which is received into the stomach, has\r\nthese plates at _both_ ends of the body.\r\n\r\niii. _Respiratory Appendages_[216]. These may be divided into _two_\r\nkinds; those by which the animal has _immediate_ communication with\r\nthe _atmosphere_, and those by which it extracts _air_ from _water_.\r\n\r\n1. To begin with the _first_. These are often found in insects\r\nwhich, during their two first states, live in the water. No better\r\nexample, nor one more easy to be examined, of this structure, can\r\nbe selected, than the gnat (_Culex_). You must have occasionally\r\nobserved in tubs of rain-water, numerous little wriggling worm-like\r\nanimals, which frequently ascend to the surface; there remain a\r\nwhile, and then bending their head under the body rapidly sink to\r\nthe bottom again. These are the larvæ of some species of the genus\r\njust named; and if you take one out of the water and examine it, you\r\nwill perceive that it is furnished near the end of its body with a\r\nsingular organ, which varies in length according to the species, and\r\nforms an angle with the last segment but one[217]. The mouth of this\r\norgan is tunnel-shaped, and terminates in five points like a star;\r\nand by this it is usually suspended at the surface of the water, and\r\npreserves its communication with the atmosphere: in its interior is a\r\ntube which is connected with the _tracheæ_, and terminates in several\r\nopenings, visible under a microscope, at the mouth of the organ. The\r\npoints or rays of the mouth when the animal is disposed to sink in\r\nthe water, are used to close it, and cut off its communication with\r\nthe atmosphere. When the animal is immersed, a globule of air remains\r\nattached to the end of the tube, so that it is in fact of less\r\nspecific gravity than that element, and it is not without some effort\r\nthat it descends to the bottom; but when it wishes to rise again,\r\nit has only to unclose the tube, and it rises without an effort to\r\nthe surface, and remains suspended for any length of time. Its anal\r\nextremity is clothed with bunches of hairs, which are furnished with\r\nsome repellent material which prevents their becoming wet[218]: it is\r\nthis repellent quality that probably causes a dimple or depression of\r\nthe surface, which if you look narrowly you will discover round the\r\nmouth of the tube[219].\r\n\r\nWhen the gnat undergoes its first change and assumes the pupa,\r\ninstead of a _single_ respiratory appendage it is furnished with\r\na _pair_, each in shape resembling a cornucopia, and, what is\r\nremarkable, placed near the opposite extremity of the body, for they\r\nproceed from the upper side of the trunk[220]. By these tubular\r\nhorns, which Reaumur compares to asses' ears[221], they respire, and\r\nare suspended at the surface.\r\n\r\nOther respiratory tubes or horns are more complex. The rat-tailed grub\r\nof a fly (_Helophilus pendulus_), like the gnat, breathes by a tube:\r\nbut as if the CREATOR willed to show those whose delight it is to\r\ninvestigate his works, by how many varying processes he can accomplish\r\nthe same end, this respiratory organ is of a construction totally\r\ndifferent from that we have been considering. It is not fixed to the\r\nside of the tail, but is a continuation of the tail itself, and is\r\ncomposed of two tubes, the inner one, like the tube of a telescope,\r\nbeing retractile within the other[222]. The extremity, which is very\r\nslender, and through which the air finds admission by a pair of\r\nspiracles, terminates in five diverging hairs or rays, which probably\r\nmaintain it _in equilibrio_ at its station at the surface[223]. As\r\nthese larvæ seek their food amongst the mud at the bottom of shallow\r\npools, in which they are constantly employed, they require an apparatus\r\ncapable of being lengthened or shortened, to suit the depth of the\r\nwater, that they may maintain their necessary communication with the\r\natmosphere; and for this purpose a _single_ tube would not have been\r\nsufficient: therefore PROVIDENCE has furnished them with _two_, and\r\nboth are extremely elastic, consisting of annular fibres, so as to\r\nadmit their being stretched to an extraordinary length. Reaumur found\r\nthat these animals could extend their tails to near _twelve_ times\r\ntheir own length. The mechanism by which the terminal piece is pushed\r\nforth or retracted, is very curious, though extremely simple. Two large\r\nparallel _tracheæ_, the direction of which is from the head[224] of\r\nthe grub to its tail, occupy a considerable portion of its interior:\r\nnear the origin of the tail, where they are very ample, they suddenly\r\ngrow very small, so as to form a pair of very slender tubes, but so\r\nlong that, in order to find room in a very contracted space, they form\r\nnumerous zigzag folds attached to the terminal tube; when this issues\r\nfrom the outer tube they consequently begin to unfold, and when it is\r\nintirely disengaged, they are become quite straight and parallel to\r\neach other. Reaumur has figured them as being united at the _base_ of\r\nthe inner tube[225]; most probably, however, they do not here stop\r\nshort, but, as in other instances, proceed to the end, and terminate\r\nin the two spiracles mentioned above: he conjectures that when the\r\nanimal has occasion to push forth its respiratory apparatus, it injects\r\ninto these vessels part of the air contained in the body of the\r\n_tracheæ_, which of course would cause them to unfold and push forth\r\nthe tube[226]. When this insect assumes the pupa, instead of its anal\r\nrespiratory organ it has _four_ respiratory horns in the trunk near the\r\nhead[227].\r\n\r\nThe larva of the chamæleon-fly (_Stratyomis Chamæleon_) is furnished\r\nwith a respiratory organ of a still different and more elegant\r\nstructure, exhibiting some resemblance to the _tentacula_ of what\r\nare called sea anemones. In this larva the last joint of the body is\r\nextremely long, and terminates in an orifice to receive the air, which\r\nis surrounded by a circle of about thirty diverging rays, consisting\r\nof beautifully feathered hairs or plumes[228]. This apparatus serves\r\nthe same purpose with that above described of the larva of the gnat.\r\nThe feathery hairs are so prepared as to repel the water, and thus to\r\nsuspend the animal by its tail at the surface, and preserve a constant\r\naccess of air. When it has occasion to sink, it turns these hairs in\r\nand shuts the orifice, carrying down with it an air-bubble that shines\r\nlike quicksilver, and which Swammerdam conjectures enables it again to\r\nbecome buoyant when it wants to breathe[229].\r\n\r\nIn the red aquatic larva of a small gnat (_Chironomus plumosus_)\r\nthere are _two_ anal respiratory subcylindrical horns, with the\r\norifice fringed with hairs[230]; and in another gnat Reaumur\r\ndiscovered _four_[231]. The larva of _Tanypus maculatus_, whose\r\nremarkable _legs_ I formerly noticed[232], exhibits in the _interior_\r\nof its trunk two long, oval, opaque bodies, which De Geer conjectures\r\nmay be air-reservoirs; these, when the animal assumes the pupa,\r\naccording to every appearance become _external_, and are placed on\r\nthe back, precisely where the respiratory horns of aquatic pupæ\r\nare usually situated,--they appear to terminate in a transparent\r\npoint[233]. The pupa of a _Tipula_ observed by Reaumur, instead of\r\n_two_ has only _one_ of these respiratory organs, in the form of a\r\nvery fine hair proceeding from the anterior end of the trunk, and\r\nconsiderably longer than the animal itself[234].\r\n\r\nIt is observable that aquatic insects that come to the surface of the\r\nwater for air, receive it at the anus, often carrying it down with\r\nthem as a brilliant bubble of quicksilver. This is generally done\r\nby means of spiracles in perfect insects, but in the water-scorpion\r\ntribe in that state respiration is by means of a long hollow tube,\r\nconsisting of two concavo-convex pieces which apply exactly to each\r\nother. This is found in both sexes, and therefore cannot be an\r\n_ovipositor_, as some have thought[235].\r\n\r\nThese respiratory organs, however, are not invariably confined to\r\n_aquatic_ larvæ and pupæ, for those of some aphidivorous flies have\r\nanal ones, and the pupa of _Dolichopus nobilitatus_, or a fly nearly\r\nrelated to it, which is _terrestrial_, has likewise a pair of long\r\nsigmoidal ones on the back of the trunk[236]. The pupa also of the\r\nrat-tailed larva just noticed as having _four_ horns, resides under\r\nthe _earth_, the insect being only _aquatic_ in its grub state.\r\n\r\n2. I am next to consider those respiratory appendages by which aquatic\r\ninsects, since they do not come to the surface for that purpose, appear\r\nto extract air for respiration from the _water_; so that they may be\r\nlooked upon in some degree as analogous to the _gills_ of fishes:\r\nthere is, however, this difference between them--in fishes, the blood\r\nis conveyed in minute ramifications of the arteries to the surface of\r\nthe branchial laminæ, through the membranes of which they abstract the\r\nair combined with the water; but as insects have no circulation, the\r\nprocess in them must be different, and their branchiform appendages may\r\nbe regarded as presenting some _analogy_ rather than any _affinity_\r\nto those of fishes. The first approach to this structure is exhibited\r\nby the pupa of a gnat lately mentioned (_Chironomus plumosus_); for\r\non each side of the trunk this animal has a pencil consisting of five\r\nhairs elegantly feathered, which, when they diverge, form a beautiful\r\nstar; its anus also is furnished with a fan-shaped pencil of diverging\r\nhairs[237].\r\n\r\nOn most of the abdominal segments of the larvæ and pupæ of the\r\n_Trichoptera_ are a number of white membranous floating threads,\r\narranged in bundles, _four_ on each segment, two above and two below,\r\nand traversed longitudinally by several air-vessels or _bronchiæ_,\r\nwhich run in a serpentine direction, growing more slender as they\r\napproach the extremity, and in some places sending forth very\r\nfine ramifications,--these are their respiratory organs[238]. The\r\ncaterpillar also of a little aquatic moth (_Hydrocampa stratiotata_)\r\nat first sight appears to be covered on each side with hairs, but\r\nwhich examined under a microscope are found to be branching flattish\r\nfilaments, each furnished with tubes from the _tracheæ_. These\r\ncaterpillars have also the semblance of spiracles, but apparently\r\nfound in the usual situation[239]. The larva of a little beetle often\r\nmentioned in my letters (_Gyrinus Natator_), is furnished on each\r\nside of every abdominal segment with a long, hairy, slender, acute,\r\nconical process, of the substance of the segment, through each of\r\nwhich an air-tube meanders; the last segment but one has _four_ of\r\nthese processes, longer than the rest[240].\r\n\r\n_Laminose_ or foliaceous respiratory appendages distinguish the\r\nsides of the abdomen of the larvæ and pupæ of the _Ephemeræ_, whose\r\nhistory you found so interesting[241]. In them these organs wear\r\nmuch the appearance of _gills_. In the different species they vary\r\nboth in their number and structure. With regard to their number,\r\nsome have only _six_ pair of them, while others have _seven_. In\r\ntheir _structure_ the variations are more numerous, and sometimes\r\npresent to the admiring physiologist very beautiful forms[242].\r\nThey usually consist of two branches, but occasionally are single,\r\nwith one part folding over the other, as in one figured by Reaumur,\r\nwhich precisely resembles the leaf of some plant, the air-vessels or\r\n_bronchiæ_ in connexion with the _tracheæ_ branching and traversing\r\nit in all directions, like the veins of leaves[243]. The double ones\r\ndiffer in form. In the larva and pupa of _Ephemera vulgata_ there\r\nare _six_ of these double false gills on each side of the abdomen,\r\nthe three last segments being without them; each branch consists\r\nof a long fusiform piece, rather tumid and terminating in a point,\r\nwhich is fringed on each side with a number of flattish filaments,\r\nblunt at the end. An air-vessel from the _trachea_ enters the gill at\r\nits base; is first divided into two larger branches, each of which\r\nenters a branch of the false gill. These branches send forth on each\r\nside numerous lesser ramifications, one of which enters each of the\r\nfilaments[244]. In another species (_E. vespertina_) each false gill\r\npresents the appearance of a pair of ovate leaves with a long acumen,\r\nand the air-vessels represent the midrib of the leaf, with veins\r\nbranching from it on each side[245]; and, to name no more, in _E.\r\nfusco-grisea_, one branch represents the leaf of a _Begonia_, the\r\nsides not being symmetrical, with its veins, while the other consists\r\nonly of numerous branching filaments[246]. In other aquatic larvæ, as\r\nin that of the common May-fly (_Sialis lutaria_), these appendages\r\nconsist of several joints[247].\r\n\r\nBy the above apparatus these aquatic animals are enabled to separate\r\nthe air from the water, as the fish by their gills; but how this\r\nseparation is made has not been precisely explained. The false gills\r\nin many species are kept in continual and intense agitation. When\r\nthey move briskly to one side, Reaumur conjectures they may receive\r\nthe air, and when they return back they may emit it[248]. This brisk\r\nmotion probably disengages it from the water. In many species, when\r\nin repose, they are laid upon the back of the animal[249], but in\r\nothers they are not[250].\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the _Agrionidæ_ appear to respire like those of the\r\n_Ephemeræ_, &c. by means of long foliaceous laminæ or false gills\r\nfilled with air-vessels; but instead of being _ventral_, they\r\nproceed from the _anus_. They are three in number, one dorsal and\r\ntwo lateral, perpendicular to the horizon, of a lanceolate shape,\r\nbeautifully veined, with a longitudinal middle nervure, from which\r\nothers diverge towards the margin, which are probably _bronchiæ_.\r\nThey are used by the animal, which swims like a fish, as fins, but it\r\ndoes not appear to imbibe the water like the other _Libellulinæ_, nor\r\nto propel itself by ejecting it,--a circumstance which furnishes an\r\nadditional argument for the more received opinion, that this action\r\nin them is for the purpose of respiration as much as for motion[251].\r\n\r\nThe larvæ and pupæ of the _Libellulinæ_, receive the water and\r\nair that they respire by a large anal aperture, which is closed\r\nat the will of the animal by five hard, moveable, triangular,\r\nconcavo-convex pieces, all very acute and fringed with hairs. These\r\npieces are placed so that there is one above, which is the largest\r\nof all; one on each side, which are the smallest, and two below;\r\nwhen these are closed they form together a conical point[252].\r\nSometimes only three of these pieces are conspicuous[253]: three\r\nother cartilaginous pieces, resembling the valves of a bivalve shell,\r\nclose the passage within the pointed pieces[254]. At this orifice the\r\nwater is received; and when, by an internal process to be described\r\nafterwards, it has parted with its oxygen, is again expelled.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I shall mention a fact which may be connected with\r\nrespiration of the insects concerned. In dissecting a moth related\r\nto _Catocala Pronuba_, but I do not recollect the particular\r\nspecies,--at the base of the abdomen of the male I discovered two\r\nbunches of long fawn-coloured parallel hairs, planted each in an oval\r\nplate, plane above, but below convex and fleshy; while the plates\r\nremained attached to the insect, they appeared to have a distinct\r\npulsation. The hairs, which are about half an inch long, diverge a\r\nlittle, and form a tuft not very unlike a shaving-brush[255]. I have\r\nnot since met with this species, but I have preserved the brush and\r\nscale. Somewhere in Bonnet's works, but I do not recollect where, I\r\nhave since found mention of a similar fact in another moth.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Having considered the _external_ respiratory organs of insects,\r\nby which the air is _received_, we are next to consider the\r\n_internal_ ones, by which it is _distributed_. These are _gills_;\r\n_tracheæ_ and _bronchiæ_; and _sacs_ or _pouches_[256].\r\n\r\ni. Gills (_Branchiæ_[257]). Having lately described what may be\r\ndenominated _false_ gills, or branchiform appendages, I shall now\r\ncall your attention to what may be denominated _true_ ones, which are\r\npeculiar to the _Arachnida_ Class: but what is remarkable, the animals\r\nthat breathe by them are very rarely inhabitants of the water, so that\r\ntheir functions cannot be perfectly analogous to those of fishes.\r\n\r\nIn the _Scorpion_, on each side of the four first ventral segments a\r\nspiracle may be discovered, which has no _lip_ as in other insects,\r\nbut is merely a circular _orifice_. These orifices do not lead to\r\n_tracheæ_ or _vesicles_, but to _true gills_, which are situated\r\nbelow a muscular web which clothes the internal surface of the\r\ncrust. Each gill consists of many semicircular very thin plates, of\r\na dead milky white, which are connected together at the dorsal end\r\nlike the leaves of a book. There appear to be more than _twenty_ of\r\nthese leaves, which when strongly magnified look transparent and\r\ndestitute of any vessels. Each gill is fastened at the back to the\r\nspiracle[258]. In the _spiders_ also, gills are discoverable, but\r\ndifferently circumstanced. On the under side of the abdomen, near\r\nthe base, is a transverse depression, on each side of which is a\r\nlongitudinal opening leading to a cavity, which is covered from above\r\nby a cartilaginous plate. In this cavity is situated a true gill,\r\nwhich is white, triangular, and covered with a fine skin; the leaves\r\nof this gill are far more numerous and much finer and softer than\r\nthose of the gills of the scorpion. On account of their softness\r\nthey have often the appearance of a slimy skin; but their laminated\r\nstructure shows itself very clearly in old specimens, and in such as\r\nhave been immersed in boiling water[259].\r\n\r\nii. _Tracheæ_ and _Bronchiæ_[260]. Parallel with each side of the body\r\nof most _insects_ and extending its whole length, run _two_ cylindrical\r\ntubes[261], which communicate with the spiracles[262], and from which\r\nissue, at points opposite to those organs, other tubes which ramify\r\n_ad infinitum_, and are distributed to every part of the body[263].\r\nThe first of these tubes are called the _tracheæ_ and the latter the\r\n_bronchiæ_. This structure appears, however, not to be universal: it\r\nis to be found in caterpillars and many _Dipterous_ larvæ; but in that\r\nof the rhinoceros-beetle and other Lamellicorns, the _bronchiæ_ branch\r\n_directly_ from the spiracle, the bottom or interior mouth of which is\r\nlined by a membrane from which they proceed[263]: something similar\r\nhas been observed to take place in many insects in other states, as\r\nthe common cockchafer[264]; in the pupa of _Smerinthus Populi_[265];\r\nin the _Cicadæ_[266]; in the Locust tribe[267]; and many others. In\r\nthe _Cossus_, or larva of the great goat-moth, the _trachea_ commences\r\nwith the first spiracle, and finishes a little beyond the last, after\r\nwhich it diminishes considerably in diameter, and terminates in several\r\nbranches or _bronchiæ_, which proceed to the anal extremity of the\r\nbody[268]. The _bronchiæ_ which originate from the _tracheæ_ in the\r\nvicinity of each spiracle, may be considered as consisting in general\r\nof _three_ packets;--_dorsal_ ones, which are distributed to the back\r\nand sides of the animal; _visceral_ ones, which enter the cavity of\r\nthe body, and are lost amongst the viscera and the caul; and _ventral_\r\nones, which dipping from the _tracheæ_ overrun the lower part of the\r\nsides and belly[269].\r\n\r\nThe _tracheæ_ and _bronchiæ_ consist of _three_ tunics[270]: the\r\n_first_ or external one is a thickish membrane, strengthened by\r\na vast number of fibres or vessels, which form round it a number\r\nof irregular circles; the _second_ is a membrane more thin and\r\ntransparent, without a vascular covering[271]; the _third_ is formed\r\nof a cartilaginous thread running in a spiral direction, which may\r\nbe easily unwound[272]. This structure gives a great elasticity to\r\nthese organs, so that they are capable of considerable tension,\r\nafter which they return to their usual length[273]. The _Bronchiæ_\r\nare cylindrical or slightly conical, insensibly diminishing in size\r\nas they leave the trunk, in which they originate. In larvæ, after\r\nlosing their spiral fibre, they appear to terminate in membrane,\r\nbut in perfect insects they pass into vesicles[274]. In the\r\n_Cossus_ the _trachea_ is flattened, and in every segment, except\r\nthe first and two last, is bound by a fleshy cord four or five\r\ntimes as thick as its threads. Where this occurs, there is a slight\r\nconstriction,--probably here is a sphincter, by the contraction of\r\nwhich Lyonet supposes the _trachea_ may be shut when it is necessary\r\nto stop the passage of the air, and direct it to any particular\r\npoint[275]. The structure here described is admirably adapted for the\r\npurpose it is intended to serve; for had these vessels been composed\r\nof _membrane_, they could not possibly have been prevented from\r\ncollapsing; but by the intervention of a spiral cartilaginous thread\r\nthis accident is effectually guarded against, and the necessary\r\ntension of the tubes provided for. However violent the contortions\r\nof the insect, however small the diameter of these vessels, they are\r\nsure to remain constantly open, and pervious to the air. And by this\r\ncircumstance they may be always distinguished from the other organs\r\nof the animal, and likewise by their pearly or silvery hue, for from\r\nbeing constantly filled with air, these tubes, when viewed under a\r\npowerful microscope in a recently dissected insect, present a most\r\nbeautiful and brilliant appearance, resembling a branching tree of\r\nhighly polished silver or pearl:--though sometimes they are blue, or\r\nof a lead colour, and sometimes assume a tint of gold. In the dead\r\ninsect the larger tubes soon turn brown, but the finer ones preserve\r\ntheir lustre several weeks[276]. The ramifications of the tracheal\r\ntree may be seen without dissection through the transparent skin of\r\nthe common louse[277] and most of the thin skinned larvæ.\r\n\r\nYou will not expect to view in this way the minuter ramifications of\r\nthe _bronchiæ_, when I have mentioned their number and incredible\r\nsmallness. Nothing but the scalpel of a Lyonet and the most powerful\r\nlenses are adequate to trace the extremities of these vessels; and\r\neven with every help, they at last become so inconceivably slender as\r\nto elude the most piercing sight. That illustrious anatomist found\r\nthat the two _tracheæ_ of the larva of the _Cossus_ gave birth to\r\n236 bronchial tubes, and that these ramify into no less than 1336\r\nsmaller tubes, to which, if 232, the number of the detached bronchiæ,\r\nbe added, the whole will amount to 1804 branches[278]. Surprising\r\nas this number may appear, it is not greater than we may readily\r\nconceive to be necessary for communicating with so many different\r\nparts. For, like the arterial and venous trees, which convey and\r\nreturn the blood to and from every part of the body in vertebrate\r\nanimals, the _bronchiæ_ are not only carried along the intestines and\r\nspinal marrow, each ganglion of which they penetrate and fill, but\r\nthey are distributed also to the skin and every organ of the body,\r\nentering and traversing the legs and wings, the eyes, antennæ, and\r\npalpi, and accompanying the most minute nerves through their whole\r\ncourse[279]. How essential to the existence of the animal must the\r\nelement be that is thus anxiously conveyed by a thousand channels,\r\nso exquisitely formed, to every minute part and portion of it! Upon\r\nconsidering this wonderful apparatus we may well exclaim, _This hath\r\nGOD wrought, and this is the work of his hands_.\r\n\r\nThough in general there is only a _pair_ of _tracheæ_, yet in\r\nsome larvæ a larger number have been discovered. In those of the\r\n_Libellulinæ_ there are _six_. According to M. Cuvier, Reaumur,\r\nwho mentions only _four_, overlooked the two lateral ones that are\r\nconnected with the spiracles[280]. The reason of this and other parts\r\nof their internal structure I shall explain under the next head.\r\nIn the grub of the gad-flies of the horse (_Gasterophili_,) Mr. B.\r\nClark discovered _eight_ longitudinal _tracheæ_,--_six_ arranged in a\r\ncircle and _two_ minute ones, which appeared to him to terminate in a\r\npair of external nipples (spiracles) in the neck of the animal[281].\r\nThis is a singular anomaly, as the other _Œstridæ_ have only a _pair_\r\nof _tracheæ_[282].\r\n\r\niii. _Respiratory Sacs or Pouches._ Besides their _tracheæ_ and\r\n_bronchiæ_, many insects are furnished with reservoirs for the air,\r\nunder the form of sacs, pouches, or vesicles. These are commonly formed\r\nby the bronchial tubes being dilated at intervals, especially in the\r\nabdomen, into oblong inflated vesicles; from which other bronchial\r\ntubes diverge, and again at intervals expand into smaller vesicles, so\r\nas to exhibit no unapt resemblance--as Swammerdam has observed with\r\nrespect to those of the rhinoceros-beetle--to a specimen of _Fucus\r\nvesiculosus_. Cuvier compares them in the Lamellicorn beetles in\r\ngeneral to a tree very thickly laden with leaves[283]; and Chabrier\r\nobserves that they particularly occur in the intestinal canal[284].\r\nThis structure of the pulmonary organs may be seen also in the common\r\nhive-bee, and other _Hymenoptera_; but the vesicles are less numerous,\r\nand those at the base of the abdomen much larger than the rest[285].\r\nThese vesicles, by a very rough dissection, may be distinctly seen in\r\nthe abdomen of the cockchafer, which appears to be almost filled with\r\nthem. Not being composed of cartilaginous rings like the air-tubes,\r\nbut of mere membrane, if a pin pierces one, the air that inflates it\r\nescapes, and it collapses. In the larva of a little gnat (_Corethra\r\nculiciformis_) the _tracheæ_ appear to proceed from a pair of oblong\r\nvesicles of considerable size[286] in the trunk, and towards the anus\r\nthey form two other smaller ones[287],--upon piercing the former, De\r\nGeer observed a considerable quantity of air to make its escape[288].\r\nAnother species, probably of the same genus, described by Reaumur,\r\nexhibits something similar[289].\r\n\r\nBut one of the most remarkable structures, in this respect, is to\r\nbe seen in the larva and pupa of the dragon-flies (_Libellulina_).\r\nI have before noticed the _number_ of their _tracheæ_, but I shall\r\nhere describe their whole internal respiratory apparatus. I must\r\nobserve that _Reaumur_, _Cuvier_, and most modern writers on the\r\nphysiological department of Entomology, have affirmed that they\r\nrespire the _water_, and that they receive it for that purpose at\r\ntheir anal extremity: but M. Sprengel, from having observed in the\r\nlarvæ abdominal spiracles, is unwilling to admit this as a fact[290];\r\nand De Geer also seems to hesitate upon it, especially as he\r\ndiscovered that the animal seemed to absorb the water to aid it in\r\nits _motions_[291]. But when we consider that it is by the action\r\nof a _pneumatic_ apparatus that the absorption and expulsion of the\r\nwater takes place, and that the animal when it has been taken out\r\nof that element, upon being restored to it, immediately has _eager_\r\nrecourse to this action[292], we shall feel inclined rather to adopt\r\nthe opinion of those great physiologists Reaumur, Lyonet, and Cuvier,\r\nand admit that it absorbs water for the purpose of _respiration_.\r\nI shall now explain how this takes place. The pieces both internal\r\nand external that close the anal orifice have been before described;\r\nthe others employed in the admission and expulsion of the water are\r\nevidently _respiratory_ organs. When this orifice is opened, the\r\nparts that are above it are drawn back in an opposite direction, so\r\nthat the five last segments of the abdomen become entirely empty,\r\nand form a chamber to receive the water that enters by it. When the\r\nwater is to be expelled, the whole mass of air-vessels which had\r\nreceded towards the trunk, is pushed forwards, and forms a piston\r\nthat again expels the water in a jet. It consists of an infinite\r\nnumber of _bronchiæ_, entangled with each other, which proceed from\r\nthe middle and posterior end of the _tracheæ_. M. Cuvier in the\r\ninterior of the _rectum_ of the larva discovered twelve longitudinal\r\nrows of little black spots, in pairs, which exhibited the resemblance\r\nof six pinnated leaves. These are minute conical tubes, of the spiral\r\nstructure of _tracheæ_, which decompose the water, and absorb the\r\nair contained in it. He also discovered that each of these tubes\r\ngave birth to another outside the _rectum_, which connected itself\r\nwith one of the six great longitudinal _tracheæ_; two of which are\r\nof enormous size, and appear to serve as reservoirs, since they\r\nfurnish air by transverse branches to two other tubes; they have each\r\na recurrent branch, which follows the course of the intestinal canal,\r\nand furnishes it with an infinity of _bronchiæ_[293]. These _tracheæ_\r\nare found in the perfect insect. The principal ones in some send\r\nforth many branches, terminating in vesicles, which in shape resemble\r\nthe seed-vessels of some species of _Thlaspi_, while others appear to\r\nform a file of oblong ones[294]. Near each of their spiracles also is\r\na vesicle which appears to be a reservoir[295].\r\n\r\nBut this kind of structure is not confined to insects strictly\r\n_aquatic_. Even such species of _terrestrial_ ones as live upon aquatic\r\nplants, and are, consequently, necessarily or accidentally often a\r\nconsiderable time under water, are furnished with some apparatus by\r\nmeans of which they can exist in this element for a considerable\r\nperiod. For example, most of the Weevils (_Rhyncophora_) die in a short\r\ntime if immersed in water; yet the species of the genera _Tanysphyrus_,\r\n_Bagous_, and _Ceutorhynchus_ which feed on aquatic plants, can\r\nexist for days under water, as I have ascertained by experiment. _C.\r\nleucogaster_ and another of the same tribe, swims like a _Hydrophilus_,\r\nand will live a long time in a bottle filled with water and corked\r\ntight. Other insects also, that are not at all aquatic, have pneumatic\r\npouches. A striated or channeled vesicle I have found under the lateral\r\nangles of the _collar_ in the humble-bee, where Chabrier supposes the\r\nvocal spiracles are situate; and also at the mouth of the spiracles\r\nof the _metathorax_ in _Vespa_, &c.[296] In _Sphinx Ligustri_ the\r\n_bronchiæ_ terminate in oblong vesiculoso-cellular bodies, almost\r\nlike lungs[297]; in _Smerinthus Tiliæ_ these are preceded by a simple\r\nvesicle bound with spiral fibres[298]. M. Chabrier thinks that these\r\nair-bladders of insects, amongst other functions, give more fixity and\r\nforce to the muscles for flight[299].\r\n\r\nMany physiologists have seen an analogy between the _spiral_ vessels\r\nof _plants_ and the _tracheæ_ of _insects_; and some of great name,\r\nas Comparetti, Decandolle, and Kieser, have thought that in some\r\ninstances they terminated in the _oscula_ or cortical pores: but\r\nSprengel contends that they are not accurate in this opinion[300]. In\r\nfact, the principal analogy seems to be in the _spiral_ structure of\r\nboth these vessels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving considered the different organs of respiration both external\r\nand internal, I shall make a few further observations upon this\r\nfunction. We know little more respecting the mode in which insects\r\n_respire_, except that they breathe out the air by the same kind of\r\norgans by which they receive it,--namely, the _spiracles_, or their\r\nrepresentatives. This has been satisfactorily proved by Bonnet, who\r\nshowed that the experiments by which Reaumur thought it established\r\nthat insects inspire by their spiracles, but expire through the mouth,\r\nanus, or pores of the skin, are founded on an erroneous assumption.\r\nThis physiologist, having observed on the surface of submerged insects\r\nnumerous bubbles of air, concluded that they had passed through the\r\nabove orifices[301]: but Bonnet found by various experiments carefully\r\nconducted, that this appearance was caused by air which adhered to the\r\nskin and its hairs, and that when the access of this was precluded by\r\ncarefully moistening the skin with water previously to immersion, this\r\naccumulation of air-bubbles on its surface did not take place[302]. And\r\nin a variety of instances he observed large ones issue from all the\r\nspiracles, especially the anterior ones. These bubbles sometimes were\r\nalternately emitted and absorbed without quitting the spiracle[303],\r\nand at others were darted with force to the surface of the water, where\r\nthey appeared to burst with noise[304]. This author is of opinion that\r\nthe _first_ and _last_ pair of these organs are of most importance to\r\nrespiration[305]. Reaumur subsequently owned that Bonnet's arguments\r\nhad shaken his opinion[306]; and some observations of his own, with\r\nrespect to the respiration of the _bot_ of the _ox_, go to prove\r\nthat expiration and inspiration are not by the _same_ spiracles;\r\nfor he found that the air in this animal was _expired_ by the eight\r\nlittle _lower_ orifices before mentioned[307], from which he clearly\r\nsaw the air-bubbles issue--the _upper_ one he conjectures receives\r\nthe air[308]. As the only communication that this grub has with the\r\natmosphere is by its _posterior_ extremity, it follows, reasoning from\r\nanalogy, that the anterior respiratory plates of Dipterous larvæ, which\r\nmay be regarded as representing the spiracles of the trunk in insects\r\nin general, are destined for the escape of the air, after it has\r\nparted with its oxygen, received by the anal ones[309]. So that there\r\nseems very good ground for M. Chabrier's opinion that _inspiration_ is\r\nordinarily by the _abdominal_ spiracles, and _expiration_ by those of\r\nthe _trunk_ of insects[310]. He seems to have been led to the adoption\r\nof this opinion, not so much by experiments similar to that of Reaumur\r\njust stated, but by observing that in many instances these two sets\r\nof spiracles differ from each other, the latter having a _convex_ and\r\nthe former a _concave_ mouth or bed[311]. In some cases, however,--for\r\ninstance during flight,--he supposes the spiracles of the trunk may\r\n_receive_ as well as _emit_ the air[312]: he likewise is of opinion,\r\nand it seems not improbable, that by means of these openings in the\r\ntrunk, from the rush of the superfluous air through them, insects\r\nproduce those sounds for which they are remarkable,--as the humming\r\nof bees and flies. In the former he thinks the sound is produced by\r\nthe pneumatic apparatus covered by the ends of the _collar_; while\r\nin the latter he attributes it to the spiracles in the _metathorax_\r\nbehind the wings attended by a poiser[313]. I incline, however, to M.\r\nDufour's opinion[314],--that the vocal spiracles in the _Hymenoptera_,\r\nas well as in the _Diptera_, are those _behind_ the wings. Perhaps\r\nboth theories may be right; for if you take any common humble-bee, you\r\nwill find that, in the hand, it produces one kind of sound when its\r\nwings are motionless, and another more complex and intense when they\r\nvibrate. In numerous instances, however, there is no very striking\r\n_external_ difference between the spiracles of the _trunk_ and those\r\nof the _abdomen_: this observation applies more particularly to the\r\ncaterpillars of _Lepidoptera_; but whether these receive the air by\r\nthose of the abdomen, and return it by those of the trunk, has not yet\r\nbeen ascertained; and indeed, too little is at present known upon the\r\nsubject, and too few facts have been collected, to admit of dogmatizing.\r\n\r\nThe _external signs_ of respiration in insects are not universally\r\nto be discovered. The alternate contraction and expansion of the\r\nabdomen is, however, very visible in some beetles, bees, the larger\r\ndragon-flies, and grasshoppers. In one of the latter, _Acrida\r\nviridissima_, Vauquelin observed that the inspirations were from\r\nfifty to fifty-five times in a minute in atmospheric air, and from\r\nsixty to sixty-five when in oxygen gas[315]. But M. Chabrier has\r\ngiven the most satisfactory account of these signs: The abdomen,\r\nsays he, is the principal organ of inspiration; it can dilate and\r\ncontract, lengthen and shorten, elevate and depress itself. In\r\nflight, in elevating its extremity at the same time with the wings,\r\nit contracts itself, pushes the air into the trunk, and diminishes\r\nthe weight of the body by the centrifugal ascending force[316].\r\nIn the majority of insects perhaps the dilatation of the abdomen\r\ntakes place by the recession of the segments from each other by\r\nmeans of the elastic ligaments that connect them; in others, as the\r\n_Dynastidæ_, _Galeodes_, &c. by the longitudinal folded membrane\r\nthat unites the dorsal and ventral segments--in the _Libellulina_\r\nby similar _ventral_ folds; and in _Cimbex_ by membranous pieces in\r\nthe first dorsal segment, which De Geer observed was elevated and\r\ndepressed at the will of the animal[317].\r\n\r\nAir is as essential to insects in their _pupa_ as in their _larva_\r\nor _perfect_ states. Lyonet, however, Musschenbroek, Martinet, and\r\nsome other physiologists, have doubted whether _quiescent_ pupæ\r\nbreathed[318]; but Reaumur and De Geer seem to have proved that they\r\ndo[319]: and if thrown into water, the same proof of respiration,\r\nby the emission and retraction of a bubble of air takes place, as\r\nin the larvæ; and De Geer found that if one be transferred under\r\nwater from one spiracle to another, it will be absorbed by it[320].\r\nIndeed, unless these pupæ had breathed, where would have been the\r\nnecessity for the spiracles with which all are furnished? It is\r\nremarkable, however, that all these spiracles do not seem of equal\r\nimportance in this respect. Reaumur found that if the _posterior_\r\nspiracles only were closed with oil, the insect suffered no injury;\r\nbut that if the _anterior_ ones were similarly treated, it infallibly\r\ndied[321]. The respiration however of pupæ seems more perfect in\r\nthose that have recently assumed that state, than in those that are\r\nmore advanced towards the imago; in which at first, from Reaumur's\r\nexperiments[322], it appears that the posterior spiracles were\r\nstopped; and in others still older, from Musschenbroek's[323], even\r\nthe anterior ones. Those quiescent pupæ that during that state remain\r\n_submerged_, respire air. De Geer has given an interesting record\r\nof this, in the case of _Hydrocampa stratiotata_. This insect spins\r\na double cocoon, the outer one thin, and the inner one of a close\r\ntexture. In the pupa there are three pair of conspicuous spiracles\r\non the second, third, and fourth segments of the abdomen, which\r\nare placed on cylindrical tubes, and they appear to have no other\r\nair-vessels. The respiratory gills of the larva having vanished,\r\nlike some others of the same genus, they know how to surround\r\nthemselves with an atmosphere of air in the midst of the water, so\r\nthat the interior of their inner cocoon is impervious to the latter\r\nelement--how they renew the air has not been ascertained. Though they\r\nrespire air, water is equally necessary, for the animal died when\r\nkept out of water[324].\r\n\r\nThe great majority of insects respire in much the same manner in\r\nall their states, particularly as to their _external_ organs; for\r\nwhen the larva breathes by the lateral spiracles, the pupa and imago\r\nusually do the same. The converse of this, however, by no means\r\nholds; for it not unfrequently happens that the two latter breathe\r\nby means of lateral spiracles, though they received the air in their\r\nlarva state by an apparatus altogether different. Thus the larvæ of\r\nmany _Diptera_ breathe by an anal tube, while the pupa and imago\r\nfollow the general system. Sometimes a tribe of insects breathe by an\r\napparatus quite different in all their states, as we have seen to be\r\nthe case with the common gnat[325], which has an _anal_ respiratory\r\n_tube_ in its _first_ state, _thoracic_ respiratory _horns_ in its\r\n_second_, and the _ordinary_ lateral _spiracles_ in its _third_.\r\n\r\nChanges also take place in their _internal_ organs. In the larvæ the\r\nrespiratory apparatus, especially the tracheal tubes, is often much\r\nlarger and more ramified than in the imago; and as the former is the\r\nprincipal _feeding_ state, there seems good ground for Mr. B. Clark's\r\nopinion--that the respiration is intimately connected with the\r\nconversion of the food[326]. In the _imago_, there appears to be more\r\nprovision for storing up the air in vesicular reservoirs, than in the\r\n_larva_. Wonderful is the mode in which some of the changes in the\r\ninternal structure, which these variations indicate, must necessarily\r\ntake place. They are, however, probably not more singular than those\r\nwhich less obviously occur in the air-vessels of all insects in their\r\ngreat change out of the larva into the pupa state. But having before\r\nenlarged on this subject, I need not repeat my observations[327].\r\n\r\nThe access of air is as necessary to insects even in their _egg_\r\nstate[328], and in many cases its presence seems provided for with\r\nequal care, by means as beautiful as those Sir H. Davy and Sir\r\nE. Home have shown to occur in the oxygenation of the eggs and\r\nfœtuses of vertebrate animals[329]. It is only necessary to view\r\nthe admirable net-work of air-vessels which Swammerdam discovered\r\nspread over the surface of the eggs of the hive-bee while in the\r\novaries[330],--a provision which, from analogy, we may conclude\r\nobtains generally; from the importance which nature has attached\r\nto the oxygenation of the germ while in the matrix. And judging\r\nfrom analogy, we may infer that the access of this element is as\r\ncarefully secured after the egg is laid, as before. The eggs of most\r\ninsects being of a porous texture, often attached to the leaves\r\nof plants, and some of them embedded in the very substance of a\r\nleaf or twig[331], are in a situation for the abundant absorption\r\nof oxygen: and the pouch of silk in which the eggs of spiders and\r\n_Hydrophili_ are deposited, may probably, from Count Rumford's\r\nexperiments, be of utility in the same point of view. In the case\r\nof the _Trichoptera_ and other insects[332] whose eggs are dropped\r\ninto the water enveloped in a mass of jelly, this substance perhaps\r\nserves for aërating the included embryo, in the same way with the\r\njelly surrounding the eggs of the frog, dog-fish, &c. It would be\r\ndesirable to ascertain whether the former jelly be of the same nature\r\nas the experiments of Mr. Brande have shown the latter to be[333]. It\r\nis not improbable that the singular rays that terminate the eggs of\r\n_Nepa_[334] may in some way be connected with the aëration of the egg.\r\n\r\nTo what I have before remarked with regard to the _vital heat_\r\nof insects[335], I may under this head very properly add a few\r\nfurther observations. I there stated, that the temperature of these\r\nanimals is usually that of the medium they inhabit, but that bees,\r\nand perhaps other gregarious ones, furnish an exception to this\r\nrule[336]. A confirmation of this remark is afforded by Inch, a\r\nGerman writer, who, upon putting a thermometer into a bee-hive\r\nin winter, found it stand 27° higher than in the open air; in an\r\nanthill, he found it 6° or 7° higher; in a vessel containing many\r\nblister-beetles (_Cantharis vesicatoria_,) 4° or 5° higher. A\r\nthermometer, standing in the air at 14° R., put into a glass vessel\r\nwith _Acrida viridissima_, in nine minutes rose to 17°, and a similar\r\nresult was observed with respect to other insects[337]. Dr. Martine\r\nsays that caterpillars have but two degrees of heat above that of\r\nthe air they live in[338]. Coleopterous insects are said to move\r\nslowly and with difficulty when the thermometer sinks to 36°, to\r\nbecome torpid at 34°, and to lose muscular irritability at a lower\r\ndegree[339]. I have before observed that some insects will bear to be\r\nfrozen into an icicle, and yet survive[340]: they share this power\r\nwith reptiles, fishes, and amphibia. But, however small the excess of\r\nit in some insects above that of the medium they inhabit, it proves\r\nthat they possess the power of _generating_ heat. Whether, like the\r\nwarm-blooded animals, they generally possess that of _resisting_\r\nheat by perspiration, &c. is not so clear. Yet the heat to which\r\nsome can bear to be exposed, basking at noon, as Dr. Clarke informs\r\nus[341], on rocky and sandy places, exposed to the full action of\r\nthe sun, appears sufficient, if not resisted by some principle of\r\ncounteraction, to roast them to a cinder. That bees perspire is well\r\nknown, but probably not singly.\r\n\r\nWhen the respiration of insects is suspended by immersion in any\r\nfluid, it is often resumed, even when it has been long and they are\r\napparently dead, if they be brought into contact with the atmosphere.\r\nReaumur found this to be the case with bees[342]; and Swammerdam\r\ntells us that the maggot of the cheese-fly (_Tyrophaga Casei_) lived\r\nsix or seven days in rain-water[343]: he found it so difficult to\r\nkill the larva of _Stratyomis Chamæleon_, which he first immersed\r\ntwenty-four hours in spirits of wine, and then put them several days\r\nin water, without killing them,--that he lost his patience, and\r\ndissected them alive. He tried to drown them also in vinegar, in\r\nwhich they held out more than two days[344].\r\n\r\nThat the suspended animation and subsequent death of most terrestrial\r\ninsects when thrown into water is caused by the want of _air_, is\r\nevident from this,--that the same effect ensues if the spiracles\r\nbe covered with any oily or fatty matter. In this case too, their\r\nvital powers soon become suspended: they revive, if the suffocating\r\nmatter be soon removed; and if this be not done, infallibly perish.\r\nThis fact was known to the ancients, for Pliny observes that bees\r\ndie if dipped in oil or honey[345]. One exception to this law has\r\nbeen before mentioned[346]: a similar contrivance secures the\r\ncheese-maggot from having its respiration interrupted by its moist\r\nand greasy food; the grub also of _Sarcophaga carnaria_, and of other\r\n_Muscidæ_ probably, has its posterior spiracles placed in a plate\r\nat the bottom of a kind of fleshy pouch, which has the shape of a\r\nhollow, truncated, and reversed cone. This pouch the grub can close\r\nwhenever it pleases, so as to cover its spiracles[347]. And numerous\r\nother larvæ, both of _Diptera_ and _Coleoptera_ that devour unclean\r\nand oily food, have doubtless some protection of this kind for their\r\nspiracles and respiratory plates.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[144] _Anat.

But the GREAT AUTHOR of nature has\r\nvaried the _machinery_ by which this nutritive fluid is formed and\r\ndistributed, gradually proceeding from the most _simple_ to the most\r\n_complex_ structure; in which he seems to have seen it fit to _invert_\r\nthe process observable in the systems of sensation and respiration,\r\nwhere the ascent is from the most _complex_, to the most _simple_\r\nstructure. In the lowest members of the animal creation, the blood\r\nseems the portion they imbibe of the fluid medium in which they reside,\r\nwhich when chylified, distributes new molecules to all parts of their\r\nframe[350]. In others, as in insects, it is formed by the chyle that\r\ntranspires through the intestinal canal into the general cavity of the\r\nbody, where it receives oxygen from the air-vessels, and is fitted for\r\nnutrition[351]. In these animals it is accompanied by a long dorsal\r\nvessel, the first step towards a _heart_, which alternately contracts\r\nand dilates with an irregular systole and diastole, but appears to\r\nhave no vascular system connected with it, though in their preparatory\r\nstates it has an _extra-vascular_ circulation which ceases in the\r\nperfect insect. Again: in others, as the _Tubicoles_, _Annelida_, &c.,\r\na real _circulation_ has been discovered; that is to say, a system of\r\nveins and arteries, but unaccompanied by a muscular heart[352]. In\r\nthe _Arachnida_ and _Branchiopod Crustacea_ the long dorsal vessel is\r\nalso found; but in these it is connected with an arterial and venous\r\nsystem, which receives, distributes, and returns the blood[353].\r\nIt has therefore now become a true _heart_, and there is a regular\r\n_circulation_; and in the _Decapod Crustacea_ the dorsal vessel is\r\ncontracted into an oval form, and placed nearly in the centre of the\r\ntrunk[354]. In the great majority of invertebrate animals the blood\r\nis _white_, but in the _Annelida_, to which Class the common dew-worm\r\nbelongs, a curious anomaly takes place--for it is _red_[355]. Thus a\r\ngradual ascent is made to the circulating system of the vertebrate and\r\nred-blooded animals. In all, however, the _blood_ is the principal\r\ninstrument of nutrition and accretion; and is on that account properly\r\nso denominated, though not connected with a circulating system.\r\n\r\nHaving given you this general outline of the means by which the\r\nblood is distributed in the different Classes of animals, I shall now\r\nconfine myself to the case of insects and _Arachnida_, beginning with\r\nthe _former_.\r\n\r\nI. If you examine attentively the back of any smooth caterpillar\r\nwith a transparent skin, you will perceive in that part an evident\r\npulsation, as though a fluid were pushed at regular intervals\r\ntowards the head, along a narrow tube which seems to run the whole\r\nlength of the body. Accurate dissections have proved that this\r\nappearance is real, that there is actually present in the back of\r\nmost insects, placed immediately under the skin and furnished with\r\nnumerous air-vessels, a longitudinal vessel[356] originating in\r\nthe head near the mouth[357], running parallel with the alimentary\r\ncanal nearly to the anus, containing a fluid which is propelled in\r\nregular pulsations of from 20 to 100 per minute, more or less as\r\nthe weather is colder or warmer[358], causing a sensible alternate\r\nsystole and diastole from the anal extremity towards the head. In\r\nthe _Cossus_ these pulses were observed by Lyonet to begin in the\r\n_eleventh_ segment, from which they passed from segment to segment,\r\ntill they arrived at the _fourth_, where they terminated[359]. This\r\nvessel is what Malpighi, who first discovered it, termed a _heart_,\r\nor rather series of hearts[360]; but which Reaumur, who injected it,\r\nregarded as a simple _artery_ without striking contractions[361]:\r\nbut to steer clear of any hypothesis, I shall merely call it the\r\n_dorsal vessel_ (_Pseudo-cardia_). When carefully taken out of the\r\nbody it is found to be a membranous tube, appearing to be closed\r\nat each end[362], in many larvæ of equal diameter every where, but\r\nin perfect insects usually widest at the _anal_ extremity[363], and\r\nattenuated into a very slender filament towards the head. In some\r\ninsects, however, as in the larva of the chamæleon-fly (_Stratyomis\r\nChamæleon_), it is attenuated at _both_ ends, and in the _Ephemera_\r\nis alternately constricted and dilated as Malpighi describes that of\r\nthe silkworm[364], a dilated portion belonging to each segment[365].\r\nIn the _Cossus_, and probably others, after the _third_ segment,\r\nit is furnished with nine pair, the three posterior pair being the\r\nlargest, of triangular transverse bundles of muscular fibres, which\r\nLyonet denominates its _wings_[366], the action of which produces its\r\nsystole and diastole, and their propagation from the tail towards the\r\nhead[367]. Under the last pair of these wings it is strengthened by\r\na large number of circular muscular fibres[368]. I have stated it as\r\n_appearing_ to be closed at each extremity, because Cuvier and most\r\nwriters have so regarded it, and probably it is so closed in the\r\nperfect insect; but from Lyonet's words it should seem that, in the\r\nlarva of the _Cossus_, he considered it as open and expanded at its\r\nanterior end[369]. He seems also to suspect, that, by means of what\r\nhe calls the frontal ganglions, a fluid is derived from the dorsal\r\nvessel to the spinal marrow. He likewise describes a large nerve as\r\npassing through it and becoming recurrent[370]. Carus, as we shall\r\nsoon see, has also proved that this tube is not closed in larvæ.\r\n\r\nThe _fluid_ which this vessel contains is very abundant; in the\r\nanimal it appears colourless and transparent like water, but\r\nwhen collected in drops it becomes more or less yellow, and even\r\norange[371]. Examined under the microscope it appears filled\r\nwith a prodigious number of transparent globules, of incredible\r\nminuteness[372]. When mixed with water, which it does readily, its\r\nglobules lose all their transparency, and coagulate into small clammy\r\nmasses. After evaporation it becomes hard, and cracks like gum, as\r\nblood does also. This gummy substance is so abundant, that the fluid\r\ncontained in the dorsal vessel of the caterpillar of the _Cossus_\r\nyields a mass of it of the size of a grey pea[373].\r\n\r\nFrom the situation of this dorsal vessel, which is precisely the\r\nsame with that of the heart in _Arachnida_ and the Branchiopod\r\n_Crustacea_, and from the systole and diastole which keep its fluid\r\ncontents in constant motion, who can wonder that the physiologists\r\nwho first discovered it, reasoning analogically, maintained that it\r\nwas a true _heart_? But modern comparative anatomists, and those\r\nof the highest name, from the absence of a vascular system for a\r\ncirculation, have contended that it is not a true heart, but an organ\r\nappropriated to other purposes: a third hypothesis, and intermediate\r\nbetween these two, has very recently been promulgated, that the\r\norgan in question, namely, is a real heart, and in the preparatory\r\nstates of insects, the centre of a real circulation, which, in the\r\nimago state, ceases with the full development of the wings; but that\r\nthis circulation is _extravascular_, or without peculiar vessels\r\nanalogous to veins and arteries.\r\n\r\nI shall now enlarge a little upon each of these hypotheses, beginning\r\nwith the first or original one.\r\n\r\nNo one will deny that the argument from analogy is strongly in favour\r\nof this: I need not therefore dwell upon it, but proceed to others.\r\nSwammerdam, to whose exactness in observing, and scrupulous accuracy,\r\nevery reader of his immortal work will bear testimony, expressly\r\nasserts that he has seen vessels issuing from the dorsal vessel in\r\nthe silkworm, and even succeeded in injecting them with a coloured\r\nfluid[374]. Now it seems extremely improbable that so practised and\r\nexpert an anatomist should have been deceived, especially upon a\r\npoint which would naturally excite his most earnest and undivided\r\nattention. Without this _recorded_ experiment, perhaps, it might\r\nbe thought, though this was very unlikely, that he had mistaken\r\n_bronchiæ_ for veins and arteries: but how could they have been\r\n_injected_ from the supposed heart? Another great physiologist,\r\nReaumur, in the caterpillar of the saw-fly of the rose (_Hylotoma\r\nRosæ_) observed, besides the _dorsal_ vessel, a _ventral_ one of\r\nsimilar form, in which also was a pulsation, but slower than that\r\nof the other. This he supposes may be the principal trunk of the\r\nveins[375]. Bonnet thought he discovered a similar vessel in a large\r\ncaterpillar, but with all his attention could perceive no motion\r\nin it[376]. Reaumur also fancied he perceived in the grub of _Musca\r\nvomitoria_, in which he in vain looked for the dorsal vessel, a\r\nfleshy part which exhibited alternate pulsations; and when with a\r\npair of scissors he made a lateral incision in the insect, amongst\r\nother parts that came out, there was one that had movements of\r\ncontraction and dilatation for several minutes,--this experiment\r\nwas repeated with the same result upon several grubs[377]. De Geer,\r\nwhose love of truth and accuracy no one will call in question,\r\nsaw the appearance of blood-vessels in the leg of the larva of a\r\n_Phryganea_ L. (as Lyonet did in those of a flea[378]); and in the\r\ntransparent thigh of _Ornithomia avicularia_ he discovered a pulse\r\nlike that of an artery[379]. Baker, whose only object was to record\r\nwhat he _saw_, speaks of the _current_ of the blood being remarkably\r\nvisible in the legs of some small _bugs_[380]: what he meant by\r\nthat term is uncertain, but they could not be _spiders_, which he\r\nhad just distinguished. This author has likewise seen a green fluid\r\npassing through the vessels of the wings of grasshoppers[381]; and M.\r\nChabrier is of opinion that insects possess the power of propelling\r\na fluid into the nervures of their wings and withdrawing it at\r\npleasure, as they are elevated or depressed[382]; but this last fact\r\nmay be independent of a circulation.\r\n\r\nBut though these arguments, which I have stated in their full force,\r\nappear strong, and at first sight conclusive, those which may be\r\nurged for the more modern opinion--that no circulation exists in\r\ninsects, properly so called,--appear to have still greater weight.\r\nLyonet, whose piercing eye and skilful hand traced the course of so\r\nmany hundred nerves and _bronchiæ_ long after they became invisible\r\nto the unassisted eye, and which were a thousand times smaller\r\nthan the principal blood-vessels, opening into so large an organ\r\nas the supposed heart of insects, might be expected to be, could\r\nnever discover any thing like them. His most painful researches,\r\nand repeated attempts to inject them with coloured liquors, were\r\nunable to detect the most minute opening in the dorsal vessel,\r\nor the slightest trace of any artery or vein proceeding from or\r\ncommunicating with it[383]. And Cuvier, whose unrivalled skill in\r\nComparative Anatomy peculiarly qualified him for the investigation,\r\nrepeated these inquiries, and tried all the known modes of injection,\r\nwith equal want of success; and is thus led to the conclusion,\r\nthat insects have no circulation, that their dorsal vessel is no\r\nheart, and therefore ought not to be called by that name: that it is\r\nrather a secretory vessel, like many others of that kind in those\r\nanimals. As to the nature of the fluid that it secretes, and its\r\nuse, he thinks it impossible, from our present information on the\r\nsubject, to form any satisfactory conclusion[384]. Marcel de Serres\r\ninforms us--which further seems to prove that it can be no real\r\nheart--that this vessel may be totally removed without causing the\r\nimmediate death of the insect[385]. This opinion receives additional\r\nconfirmation from the mode in which _respiration_ is performed in\r\ninsects. In those animals that have a circulation, this takes\r\nplace by means of _lungs_ or _gills_;--thus we find, even in the\r\n_Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ so nearly related to insects, that the\r\norgans of this function are true _gills_; whereas in insects, though\r\nin some of their states their respiratory tubes are branchiform, yet\r\nthey are _not_ gills, and the respiration is by tubes and spiracles.\r\nAnd these tubes, as you have seen, are so numerous and so infinitely\r\nramified and dispersed, as to occupy the place of arteries and veins,\r\nand to imitate their distribution,--and thus to oxygenate what may be\r\ndeemed the real analogue of the blood, which bathes every internal\r\npart of the body of an insect. Those animals likewise that have a\r\ncirculation are furnished with a _liver_, as is the case with the\r\n_Arachnida_ and even many aggregate animals that have a heart; but\r\nin insects there are only hepatic ducts. M. Cuvier has also proved\r\nthat the _conglomerate glands_, which exist in all animals that have\r\na heart and blood-vessels, do not exist in insects, in which they\r\nare replaced by long slender secretory tubes, which without being\r\nunited float in the interior of the body: from this circumstance,\r\nhe is led to conclude that their nutrition is by _imbibition_ or\r\nimmediate absorption, as in the _Polypi_ and other zoophytes, the\r\nchyle transpiring through the alimentary canal, and running uniformly\r\nto all parts of the body[386].\r\n\r\nThese arguments appear so satisfactory, that Physiologists in\r\ngeneral seem to have been convinced by them that no circulation, at\r\nany time, takes place in insects, and that their supposed heart is\r\nmerely a secretory vessel, though of what kind they were at a loss\r\nto conjecture[387]. But, convincing as they seem, they appear to\r\nhave been founded in _error_, and on the idea that a _circulation_,\r\nas well as a _heart_, necessarily implies a _vascular system_\r\nconsisting of veins and arteries; for by the recent discoveries\r\nof M. Carus, it has been satisfactorily proved that insects in\r\ntheir preparatory states, have an _extravascular_ circulation, the\r\narterial and venose currents not being confined by _parietes_. The\r\nobservations upon which M. Carus' hypothesis is founded, were made\r\nin the Autumn of 1826; and an abstract of their results presented\r\nto the Union of German Naturalists and Physicians, which then held\r\nits meeting at Dresden, many of the members of which, as MM. Oken,\r\nHusche, Heyne, Purkinje, Otto, Weber, and Müller, had ocular proofs\r\nof the reality of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nHis first observations were made on the larva of _Agrion Puella_,\r\nwhich swims by means of three vertical laminæ attached to the\r\ntail; which, when the wings first appear as rudiments, begin to be\r\nexsiccated and are finally detached. Each of these laminæ, in its\r\nnatural vertical position, presents an inferior abdominal and a\r\nsuperior dorsal edge, has two tracheæ running along its centre with\r\nramifying bronchiæ, and consists of granular substance contained\r\nbetween two strata of the external integuments. A current of\r\nblood-globules enters each lamina somewhat nearer to its abdominal\r\nthan to its dorsal edge, and running through the greater part of\r\nits length suddenly turns and bends its course back towards the\r\nbody, somewhat nearer to the dorsal than to the abdominal margin of\r\nthe lamina. The channel thus formed in the midst of the granular\r\nsubstance is perfectly transparent, except where it is occupied by\r\nthe blood-globules, or crossed by the bronchiæ. The parietes of\r\nthe channel are not strictly defined, nor formed by any thing like\r\nthe coats of a vessel, the blood circulating through the granular\r\n_Parenchyma_; a circumstance however which is not peculiar to\r\nthis case, but also occurs generally in the first states of the\r\ncirculation, as it presents itself for instance in the embryo of\r\n_Fishes_, and in the _figura venosa_ of the incubated egg[394]. The\r\nblood-globules are elongated like a grain of wheat, considerably\r\nlarger than those of the human blood, and float in a fluid which is\r\ninvisible because of its transparency, but the existence of which\r\nis proved by the variations in the position of the globules in the\r\ncurrent, sometimes following its direction, at others crossing it\r\ntransversely, or more or less obliquely.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is vigorous, the current is uninterrupted, although\r\nits velocity is accelerated at regular intervals; and that not only\r\nin the excurrent (_arterial_), but also in the recurrent (_venous_)\r\npart of its course through the lamina. When the animal becomes\r\nexhausted, or the laminæ exsiccated, the circulation is interrupted,\r\nand in the same manner, as under the same circumstances, in the larvæ\r\nof frogs and lizards; the disturbance displaying itself not merely by\r\na cessation of the process, but also by retrograde movements of the\r\ncurrents, or by oscillatory motions of the blood-globules.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the wings are developed, the circulation in the\r\nlaminæ diminishes, and ultimately ceases, preparatory to the\r\ndetachment of the laminæ themselves. At the same time, however, it\r\npresents itself under a new form in the wings. In these the excurrent\r\nor arterial stream takes its course along the inner margin of the\r\nwing, and the recurrent or venous returning along the outer; whilst,\r\noccasionally, other transverse currents take their course through the\r\nnet-work of the wing from its inner to its outer margin. As the wings\r\nare further developed, the circulation in them, like that in the\r\ncaudal laminæ, gradually becomes weaker and ultimately ceases[395].\r\n\r\nThe next observations were made on the transparent larva of a\r\nneuropterous insect (probably a _Semblis_ or _Sialis_), in which\r\nthe pulsations of the dorsal vessel were distinctly seen at its\r\nposterior extremity, from which they were propagated towards the\r\nanterior; these two divisions of that vessel appearing to bear\r\nto each other the relation of a _heart_ and _aorta_. There were\r\nno traces of other vessels, though regular and rapid currents of\r\nblood-globules, exterior to the tracheæ, proceeded from the head\r\ntowards the posterior extremity of the body, where each of these\r\ncurrents entered the heart, which again propelled its contents with\r\naccelerated velocity through the anterior part of the dorsal vessel\r\ntowards the head. The lateral currents also were accelerated upon\r\neach contraction of the heart, proving that they must communicate\r\nwith the dorsal vessel at the anterior part of the body, though the\r\nopacity of the head rendered it impossible to ascertain the mode of\r\n_anastomosis_. An excurrent and returning current were also traced\r\nto each of the legs[396]. But the phenomena of the circulation was\r\nmost distinctly visible in the larva of _Ephemera vulgata_, even\r\nmore distinctly than it is possible to trace it in the larvæ of\r\nfrogs and newts. In this animal the circulation, with the help of\r\nthe microscope, is at once visible in the three last segments of\r\nthe body; and with a little attention is discoverable not only in\r\nthe three terminal _caudulæ_, and in the upper joints of the legs,\r\nbut also in the head, and particularly the roots of the antennæ. In\r\nthe posterior part of the body there are on each side two currents\r\nof blood, not bounded by parietes, situate on each side of the\r\nintestinal canal, the inner one being the most considerable. The\r\nexternal one communicates with the internal by several intermediate\r\nbranches; from this probably the streams are detached, which in the\r\nform of loops are seen at the upper joints of the legs, though it\r\nis not possible precisely to ascertain this, nor even whether these\r\nlateral currents continue distinct in the thorax, which probably\r\nthey do. At the ninth abdominal segment these currents which flow\r\nposteriorly from the head, change their direction, and are inflected\r\nso as to enter the pulsating heart, from which the current again\r\nflows towards the head. Before they enter the heart they give off\r\nthree streams, one for each of the three _caudulæ_. The currents\r\nin these _caudulæ_ present the phenomena of the circulation with\r\npeculiar distinctness, and are particularly remarkable from the\r\ncircumstance, that the excurrent and recurrent streams, though\r\nclosely approximated without any visible separation, flow without\r\ndisturbing each other. The excurrent stream is accelerated in\r\ncorrespondence with the pulsations of the heart; the recurrent on\r\nthe contrary being always somewhat more sluggish, and the first to\r\nstagnate and cease when the strength of the animal is impaired. In\r\nthe anterior part of the head currents can be discovered, forming\r\nloops like those of the legs, at the roots of the antennæ; each\r\ncurrent proceeding from the cranial surface, and in returning taking\r\nits course towards the region of the larynx[397].\r\n\r\nM. Carus has likewise observed currents of blood in the larvæ of\r\nwater-beetles (_Hydrophilus_ and _Dytiscus_)[398]; but at present he\r\nappears to have detected it in no terrestrial larva. Whether this is\r\noccasioned by their opacity, or it exists only in the ovum, as he seems\r\nto suspect[399], must be left for determination to future observers;\r\nit is scarcely probable, however, that the larvæ of _Dytisci_ and\r\n_Hydrophili_ should differ from other _Coleoptera_ in their circulation.\r\n\r\nThe endeavours of M. Carus to discover any proofs of a circulation\r\nin insects in their last state, except in the wings at their first\r\ndevelopment, were without success[400]. He observes that the fact\r\nof the currents of fluids in larvæ not being defined by vascular\r\nparietes, enables us to comprehend the rapidity and facility with\r\nwhich the traces of the circulation are lost in the perfect insect.\r\nOn the other hand, that the existence of a circulation at one period,\r\nand its cessation at another, elucidate many circumstances connected\r\nwith the physiology of these animals: for instance, the contrast\r\nbetween the rapid growth and transformations of the larvæ, and the\r\nstationary existence of the imago, &c. Lastly he remarks, that the\r\nphenomena of this circulation do not throw any light on the obscure\r\nsubject of the mode of nutrition in perfect insects; which therefore\r\nmust still be supposed to be effected according to the idea of\r\nCuvier, without the intervention of vessels[401].\r\n\r\nWhatever be the functions of the dorsal vessel, this seems the most\r\nproper place to state to you what further is known respecting it.\r\nIts construction is nearly alike in insects in all their states,\r\nexcept that in the imago it is shorter and narrower. Reaumur has\r\naffirmed, and before him Malpighi made a similar observation, that\r\nin chrysalises newly disclosed from the larva, and yet transparent,\r\nthe motion of the included fluid is the reverse of what it has been\r\nin that state, it being propelled from the head to the tail, which\r\nhe found to be the case also in the imago[402]. If this be true,\r\nand there is no reason to doubt his accuracy, when they are more\r\nadvanced, it resumes its old course, as Lyonet observed, from the\r\ntail to the head[403]. But probably it is not always uniformly in\r\nthe same direction, since Malpighi states that a very slight cause\r\nwill change its course, and that the pulsations differ in quickness\r\nin different portions of the heart[404]. If its course were really\r\nalways the same, and in one direction, without any reflux, it would\r\nseem to follow that the fluid must be absorbed at one end, and, if\r\nthere was no outlet, transpire at the other, which would be a kind\r\nof circulation. In _Syrphus Pyrastri_ and other aphidivorous flies,\r\nthis dorsal vessel, instead of the usual form which it had in the\r\nlarva, assumes a very peculiar appearance. If, taking one of these\r\nflies by the head and wings and holding it up to the light, you\r\nsurvey under a lens the base of the lower part of its abdomen, you\r\nwill see through its transparent skin, which exactly forms such a\r\nwindow as physicians have sometimes wished for in order to view the\r\ninterior of their patients, a flask-shaped vessel having its long end\r\ndirected towards the trunk, in which there is a manifest pulsation\r\nand transmission of some fluid. This vessel extends in length from\r\nthe junction of the trunk with the abdomen to about the termination\r\nof the second segment. The included fluid does not run in the dorsal\r\nvessel in a regular course, but is propelled at intervals by drops,\r\nas if from a syringe, first from the wide end towards the trunk,\r\nand then in the contrary direction, forming a very interesting and\r\nagreeable spectacle. One circumstance led Reaumur to conjecture that\r\nthe neck of this vessel, which he at first regarded as simple, is\r\nin fact composed of two or more approximated tubes, and that the\r\nblood is conveyed forward by the outward ones, and backward by the\r\nintermediate one[405]: he even thinks that he saw a kind of secondary\r\nheart, at the extremity next the trunk, for the purpose of causing\r\nthe reflux. This illustrious author observed the above remarkable\r\nstructure not only in the _Syrphi_, but in many of their affinities,\r\nand thinks that it is also widely diffused amongst the _Muscidæ_[406].\r\n\r\nI must now say something upon what I conceive to be the real _blood_\r\nof insects; for I think no one will object to that name being given\r\nto their nutritive fluid, especially in the larva, though it\r\ndoes not circulate by means of a vascular system. The chyle that\r\nis produced in the intestines of animals from the food, is that\r\nfluid substance from which their blood is formed: in insects it is\r\nnot absorbed by the lacteals, but transpires through the pores of\r\nthe intestinal canal into the general cavity of the body, where,\r\nbeing exposed to the influence of the oxygen in the air-vessels, it\r\nbecomes, though retaining its colour, a different fluid from what\r\nit was before, and analogous to blood in its use and office[407];\r\nonly that in these animals, as Cuvier has observed, at least in\r\ntheir perfect state, the blood, for want of a circulating system,\r\nnot being able to seek the air, the air goes to seek the blood[408].\r\nThe dispersion of this fluid appears to be universal, so that all\r\nthe parts and organs contain it in a greater or less degree[409]. In\r\nmany insects, if you break only an antenna or a leg, a drop of fluid\r\nflows out at the wound. In larvæ, the fluid which bathes[410], or\r\nvisits, all the internal parts and organs is not only sufficient for\r\ntheir nutriment, but a large quantity of seemingly superfluous blood\r\nremains that is not wanted for this purpose. This is expended in the\r\nproduction of the caul or _epiploon_ (_Corps graisseux_ Reaum.),\r\nwhich laps over and defends all the viscera of the animal, and goes\r\nprincipally to the formation of the imago[411]. I have said that\r\nCuvier conceives nutrition in insects to take place by _imbibition_\r\nor immediate absorption; that is, I suppose, the different parts\r\nand organs thus constantly bathed in the blood, imbibe from it the\r\nparticles necessary for their constant accretion. M. Chabrier seems\r\nto think that it is the compression and dilatation of the trunk\r\nthat duly distributes the nutritive fluid[412]; Lyonet compares the\r\nnutrition of insects by their fibres from this fluid, when formed\r\ninto the _corps graisseux_, to that of plants that draw their\r\nsupport by their roots from the earth[413]. Much obscurity, however,\r\nat present rests upon this subject--much for future investigation\r\nto explore; but in all the works of the MOST HIGH there is always\r\nsomething inscrutable, something beyond the reach of our senses and\r\nfaculties, which teaches us humbly to adore his infinite perfections.\r\n\r\nII. The circulation of the _Arachnida_ is next to be considered;\r\nand the term applied to these becomes strictly proper. Two great\r\ntribes, in our view of the subject, constitute this Class,--the\r\nspiders (_Araneidea_) and scorpions (_Scorpionidea_): I shall give\r\nyou some account of the circulating vessels of each.--In _spiders_,\r\nthe heart in general is a long dorsal vessel as in insects, but\r\nsupposed to be confined to the _abdomen_, growing slenderer towards\r\neach extremity, particularly the anal. In some also, as in _Aranea\r\ndomestica_, like that of insects, it has lateral muscular appendages;\r\nbut in others, as in _Clubiona atrox_, it is without them[414]. It\r\nexhibits a pair of vessels that appear to connect with the gills,\r\nby which the oxygenation of the blood takes place, and a number of\r\nothers that ramify minutely and are lost in the analogue of the\r\n_epiploon_, supposed to be their _liver_[415]. Whether these last are\r\nto be regarded merely as _veins_, has not been ascertained; they seem\r\nrather to convey the blood outwards, than to return it back to the\r\nheart: but this question must be left for future investigation. I may\r\nobserve, however, that though the heart of the spider has been traced\r\nonly in the _abdomen_, it may probably extend into the _trunk_.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the _scorpion_ has been examined both by Treviranus\r\nand Marcel de Serres; but I shall principally confine myself to the\r\ndescription of the latter, as the most clear and intelligible. The\r\nheart, then, of these animals is elongated, almost cylindrical,\r\nbut attenuated at each end; it is extended from the head to the\r\nextremity of the tail, and appears to have four pairs of lateral\r\nmuscles. On each side are four pairs of principal vessels, which go\r\nto the pulmonary pouches, and there ramify. These may be assimilated\r\nto _veins_. Besides these, there are four other vessels that cross\r\nthem, forming with them an acute angle, and which, with four branches\r\nof smaller size, receive the blood from the pulmonary pouches, and\r\ndistribute it to the different parts of the body,--these are the\r\n_arteries_. Before it enters the tail, the heart throws out two\r\nvascular branches which do not go to the gills, but distributing the\r\nblood to different parts, ought to be considered as arteries[416].\r\nTreviranus mentions bunches of reticulated vessels, concerning the\r\nuse and origin of which he seems uncertain[417]; but as they approach\r\nthe gills they are probably the branching extremities of what M. de\r\nSerres considers as the veins.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[348] _Genes._ ix. 4.\r\n\r\n[349] _N.

Nat._ xvi. 208.\r\n\r\n[387] Marcel de Serres, in his _Observations on the Dorsal Vessel of\r\nInsects_[388], endeavours to prove that the principal use of that\r\nvessel is the more perfect animalization of the chyle that, transuding\r\nthrough the pores of the intestinal canal, is imbibed by it. In\r\ninsects, he observes, that undergo metamorphoses, in which the growth\r\nor development of parts is often very rapid, it is requisite that\r\na considerable portion of the chyle should be in reserve for this\r\npurpose. On this account it is that the _Epiploon_ or adipose tissue\r\nis so abundant in larvæ to what it is in the perfect insect. That the\r\nimportance also of this part to insects is proved by the circumstance,\r\nthat all their interior parts communicate by fibrils with this tissue,\r\nand that probably their various organs derive the nutriment from\r\nit by their means. He then asks by which of the viscera is the fat\r\nelaborated, or by what means does the chyle which transudes from the\r\nintestinal canal pass to the state of fat? Facts seem to indicate, says\r\nhe, that the function of the dorsal vessel is to pump up the chyle,\r\nand to cause it then to transude through the meshes of the adipose\r\ntissue, where it finishes by elaborating that mass of fat so abundant\r\nin larvæ and certain perfect insects, which are thus enabled to sustain\r\nthe effects of a long fast. So that this vessel is only a _secretory_\r\norgan, analogous to so many others that exist in insects; but the\r\nsecretion which it has to produce is the most important of all, since\r\nthe support of the vital powers depends upon it: it is, in effect,\r\nthat vessel which completes the function of animalization, and which\r\nitself prepares the nutritive fluid[389]. He observes, amongst other\r\nreasons he brings to support his theory, that the colour of the fluid\r\nwhich it contains is always analogous to that of the adipose tissue\r\nthat surrounds it, and that the colour of that tissue never changes\r\nwithout that of the fluid undergoing a corresponding alteration,--that\r\nwhen, as in many perfect insects, the quantity of fat diminishes, the\r\ndorsal vessel also diminishes in size, and that the same reagents which\r\ncoagulate the fat, coagulate equally the fluid in the dorsal vessel,\r\nwhich seems to indicate an identity between them[390].\r\n\r\nBut there are circumstances that militate against this hypothesis.\r\nThe analysis which Lyonet has given of the fluid contained in the\r\ndorsal vessel of the _Cossus_[391], seems to prove that it is more\r\nanalogous to gum or varnish. He saw indeed a few globules, which\r\nappeared ten times as big as the others, which swam upon the water,\r\nbut which he did not regard as component parts of the fluid, but as\r\nlittle drops of grease extravasated by dissection. The fluid of the\r\nvessel itself easily mixed with water, and appeared to sink in it to\r\nthe bottom[392]. This proves that it is not of a fatty or oleaginous\r\nnature. But the strongest objection is stated by M. Carus, who\r\njudiciously observes[393], That it is contradictory to suppose that\r\na canal should absorb or exude fluids by its parietes in a different\r\nform. Further experiments however seem necessary to ascertain the\r\nnature of the fluid and its object.\r\n\r\n[388] _Mem. du Mus._ 1819.\r\n\r\n[389] _Ibid._ 68--.\r\n\r\n[390] _Ibid._ 69--.\r\n\r\n[391] See above, p. 85.\r\n\r\n[392] Lyonet _Anat._ 426--.\r\n\r\n[393] _Introd. to Comp.

Thus the voracious larvæ of the _Scarabæi_\r\nand butterflies have intestines ten times as large as the winged and\r\nsober insects--if I may use such an expression--to which they give\r\nbirth[418].\"\r\n\r\nIn the natural families of these creatures, the same analogy takes\r\nplace with respect to this part that is observable in the rest of the\r\nAnimal Kingdom; the length and complication of the intestines are\r\nhere, as in the other Classes, often an index of a less substantial\r\nkind of nutriment; while their shortness and slenderness indicate\r\nthat the insect lives by prey[419].\r\n\r\nIn considering therefore the parts connected with the digestive\r\nfunctions of the insect world, it will not be amiss to have reference\r\nto their _food_, and their mode of taking it; but first it will be\r\nproper to state and define the parts of this important organ.\r\n\r\nIn general the alimentary canal[420] is composed of the same\r\nessential _tunicks_ as that of the vertebrate animals, consisting\r\nof an interior epidermis, a papillary and cellular tunick, and an\r\nexterior muscular one[421]. The first is usually tender, smooth,\r\nand transparent; but not always discoverable, perhaps on account of\r\nits tender substance[422]. Ramdohr does not notice the papillary\r\nand cellular tunicks; they are probably synonymous with what he\r\ndenominates--the _flocky layer_ (_Die flockige lage_), and which\r\nhe describes, when highly magnified, as appearing to consist of\r\nvery minute globules or dark points, and as being of a cellular\r\nstructure[423]. The _exterior_ tunick is thicker and stronger than\r\nthe _interior_, and composed of muscular fibres, running either\r\nlongitudinally, or transversely so as to form rings round the canal.\r\nThis tunick mostly begins at the mouth, and goes to the anus,\r\nchanging its conformation in different parts of the above intestine.\r\nSometimes however it originates only at the beginning of the\r\nstomach[424]. With respect to its general disposition, that canal--in\r\nits relative length, in the size of its different parts, in the\r\nnumber and form of its dilatations, and particularly of its stomachs\r\nand its cœcums, and in the folds of its interior--exhibits variations\r\naltogether analogous to those of vertebrate animals, and which\r\nproduce similar effects[425]. As to its _parts_, it may be considered\r\nas consisting of _two_ larger portions, between which the biliary or\r\nhepatic vessels form the point of separation. In the first, the most\r\nuniversal parts are the gullet and the stomach; and in the second,\r\nthe small intestine and the large intestine[426].\r\n\r\n1. The _gullet_ (_Œsophagus_[427]) is that portion of the intestinal\r\ncanal which, receiving the food from the pharynx, or immediately\r\nfrom the mouth, conveys it to the stomach. Though it often ends just\r\nbehind the _head_[428], it is usually continued through the _trunk_,\r\nand sometimes even extends into the middle of the _abdomen_[429];\r\nit therefore seldom much exceeds in length half the body. It is\r\nconstantly long when the head is connected with the trunk by a narrow\r\ncanal--as in the _Hymenoptera_, _Neuroptera_, _Lepidoptera_, &c.; but\r\nis frequently short when these parts are more intimately united[430].\r\nIt often ends in a kind of sac analogous to the crop of birds.\r\nUnder this head I must mention a part discovered by Ramdohr, which\r\nhe calls the _food-bag_ (_Speisesack_), as he thinks, peculiar to\r\n_Diptera_[431]. From the mouth in these proceeds a narrow tube into\r\nthe abdomen, where it expands into a blind sac having no connexion\r\nwith the stomach; so that the fluid food, as blood, &c. stored in\r\nit, must be regurgitated into the mouth before it can pass into\r\nthat organ[432]. Thus these animals, besides their stomach, have a\r\n_reservoir_ in which to store up their food; the product therefore of\r\na single meal will require several days to digest it.\r\n\r\n2. The _stomach_ (_Ventriculus_[433]) is that part of the intestinal\r\ncanal immediately above the bile-vessels, which receives the food\r\nfrom the gullet for digestion, and transmits it when digested to\r\nthe lower intestines[434]. By its admixture with the gastric juice,\r\nthe food acquires in the stomach a quite different colour from\r\nwhat it had in the gullet. In herbivorous _insects_ it contains no\r\nacid, but, like the gastric juice of herbivorous _quadrupeds_, is\r\nof an alkaline nature[435]. The chyle is forced through this organ,\r\nprobably in part by the pressure of the muscular fibres during the\r\nperistaltic motion; and being pressed through the _inner_ skin, is\r\nfirst collected in the intermediate cellular part, and ultimately\r\nforced through the _outer_ skin[436]. At its posterior end it\r\nterminates in the _pylorus_, a fleshy ring or sphincter formed of\r\nannular muscular fibres[437]. The stomach often consists of two or\r\nmore successive divisions, which are separated from each other, and\r\nare often of an entirely different conformation and shape[438]. In\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, Predaceous _Coleoptera_, and several other insects,\r\nan organ of this kind precedes the ordinary stomach, which from its\r\nstructure Cuvier denominates a second stomach or _gizzard_[439];\r\nPosselt improperly calls it _Cardia_[440]; and by Ramdohr it is\r\nnamed the _plaited-stomach_ (_Falten-magen_[441]). It is a short\r\nfleshy part consisting of two skins, placed above the opening of the\r\nstomach, and perhaps rather belongs to the gullet. The _inner_ skin\r\nis formed into longitudinal folds, and sometimes armed with horns,\r\nteeth, or bristles. Its cavity is very small and compressed, so as\r\nto admit only small masses of food, and yet present them to a wide\r\nsurface for the action of the teeth or bristles;--in this stomach\r\ntherefore, as in the gizzard of birds, to which it seems clearly\r\nanalogous[442], the food is more effectually comminuted and rendered\r\nfit for digestion. The muscles, by which its action upon the food is\r\nsupported, in some species amount to many thousands[443]. Rudiments\r\nof a gizzard are sometimes found concealed in the gullet of many\r\ninsects[444]. The idea of Swammerdam, Cuvier, &c. that grasshoppers\r\nand other insects that have this kind of stomach, chew the cud[445],\r\nRamdohr affirms is entirely erroneous[446]. Besides its divisions,\r\nthe stomach has other _appendages_ that require notice. In most\r\n_Orthoptera_, a pair or more of blind intestines or _cœca_ may be\r\nfound at the point of union of the gizzard with the stomach[447],\r\nwhich have been regarded as forming a _third_ stomach: they also\r\nbegin the stomach in the louse[448]; they form a coronet round the\r\napex of that organ, in the grub of the cockchafer[449]; and in that\r\nof the rose-beetle, there is one at the apex, one in the middle,\r\nand a third at the base[450]. Besides these appendages, which are\r\nformed of the skin of the stomach, there are others that are not\r\nso. In the Predaceous and some other beetles, the whole external\r\nsurface of this organ is covered with small blind appendages opening\r\ninto the space between its two skins, which cause it to resemble a\r\nshaggy cloth; these Ramdohr calls _shags_ (_zotte_[451]), and Cuvier,\r\n_hairs_[452] (_villi_). These appendages the latter author seems to\r\nregard as organs that secrete the gastric juice and render it to the\r\nstomach[453]; but the former thinks their use uncertain[454].\r\n\r\n3. The _small intestines_ (_Intestina parva_) are the portion\r\nof intestines next the stomach, and consist often of _three_\r\ndistinct canals;--the first is supposed to be analogous to the\r\n_duodenum_; it is found only in the Coleopterous genera _Silpha_\r\nL. and _Lampyris_ L., and is distinguished from the succeeding\r\nintestine by being perfectly smooth[455]. Next follows the _thin\r\nintestine_ (_Dünndarm_), which in the above insects is wrinkled;\r\nit most commonly immediately follows the stomach. Sometimes it is\r\nwholly wanting, as in _Agrion_, the _Hemiptera_[456], &c. Ramdohr\r\nconjectures that it is not solely destined for conveying the\r\nexcrement, but that probably some juices are separated in it from\r\nthe food especially for the nutrition of the gall-vessels, as their\r\nprincipal convolutions are mostly near this intestine[457]; which\r\nperhaps may in some cases be regarded as analogous to the _jejunum_\r\nin vertebrate animals. The third pair of the small intestines, which\r\nperhaps represents the _ileum_, Ramdohr distinguishes by the name\r\nof _club-shaped_ (_Keulförmigen Darm_[458]). It may generally be\r\nregarded as only a continuation of the former thickened at the end so\r\nas to resemble a club reversed. It is however sometimes _separated_\r\nfrom the thin intestine, as in _Cerambyx moschatus_[459].\r\n\r\n4. The _large intestines_ (_Intestina magna_) consist sometimes\r\nof two portions. The _thick intestine_ (_Dicken-darm_), which may\r\nbe regarded as a kind of _cœcum_, is found only in the larvæ of\r\nthe Lamellicorn beetles, but never in the perfect insect. In shape\r\nit is oval and folded; whence it is thicker than the rest of the\r\nintestinal canal, and is constantly filled with excrement[460]. The\r\nsecond portion of these intestines is the _rectum_ (_Mastdarm_),\r\nwhich terminates in the anal passage. This part is scarcely ever\r\nwanting, except when the insect evacuates no excrement, which is the\r\ncase with the grubs of bees, wasps, and the antlion (_Myrmeleon_).\r\nIn the imago of _Telephorus_, at least in _T. fuscus_, it is also\r\nobsolete[461]: in most cases, however, it is very distinct from\r\nthe preceding intestine. Sometimes it consists of only one tunick\r\ncomposed of muscular fibres[462]. When the gullet is wide, the\r\n_rectum_ is usually so likewise; but when it follows a club-shaped\r\nor thick intestine, it is narrow[463]. It generally may be termed\r\n_short_[464]. When wide, it often contains a great quantity of\r\nexcrement, as the gullet does of undigested food; but when narrow,\r\nthe excrement seldom remains long in it. This intestine also in a few\r\ncases has a lateral enlargement or _cœcum_ (_Blind-darm_), being a\r\ncontinuation of the same skin; but perhaps this enlargement is really\r\nanalogous to what Ramdohr calls the _thick intestine_, though in\r\nthese cases he regards it as an appendage of the rectum[465].\r\n\r\nI must now call your attention to the _bile-vessels_ of insects.\r\nThese, by Malpighi[466] and the earlier physiologists, who regarded\r\nthem as a kind of _lacteals_, were denominated _varicose_ vessels:\r\nbut Cuvier--and his opinion after some hesitation has been adopted by\r\nRamdohr--considers them as vessels for the secretion of _bile_, and as\r\nanalogous to the _liver_ of animals that have a circulation[467]. As\r\nthe want of blood-vessels prevents insects from having any gland, the\r\nbile is produced with them, as all their other secretions, by slender\r\nvessels that float in their nutritive fluid, and from thence secrete\r\nthe elements proper to form that important product, which usually\r\ntinges them with its own yellow hue; though in the Lamellicorns and\r\nCapricorns they are of an opaque white, and in the _Dytisci_ of a\r\ndeep brown colour[468]. Their bitter taste further proves that they\r\ncontain the bile[469]. They are long, slender, filiform, tortuous or\r\nconvoluted, and mostly simple vessels; sometimes gradually smaller\r\ntoward the base[470], at others towards the apex[471]. In some,\r\nscrew-shaped[472]: in one larva, with hemispherical elevations[473]: in\r\nthe cockchafer, part of them are fringed on each side with an infinity\r\nof short, blind, minute, setiform tubes, while the rest are naked[474];\r\nthey are composed of a single, thin, transparent membrane, according\r\nto Ramdohr[475]; but Cuvier thinks their texture is spongy[476]. They\r\nappear to contain a number of small, irregular, dark granules, which\r\nfloat in a peculiar fluid, with which, however, they are not always\r\nfilled throughout, nor are they constantly permeable from one end to\r\nthe other. Thus in the meal-worm beetle (_Tenebrio Molitor_), the\r\ncommon trunk by which they are attached to the intestinal canal is\r\ncomposed of gelatinous granules[477]. The place of their insertion is\r\ngenerally a little below the _pylorus_, but in the common cockroach\r\nthey are inserted into the stomach just above that part[478]. Usually\r\neach vessel opens singly into the intestinal canal, which the whole\r\nnumber surround at an equal distance from each other[479]. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, they are connected with it by a common tube in which they\r\nall unite, as in the asparagus-beetle (_Lema Asparagi_[480]), and\r\nthe mole-cricket (_Gryllotalpa vulgaris_[481]); in the house-fly\r\n(_Musca domestica_), and other _Muscidæ_, each pair unites so as to\r\nform a single branch on each side of the canal previously to their\r\ninsertion[482]; in the field-cricket (_Gryllus campestris_) they are\r\nall inserted in one spot[483]; and when numerous, they are generally\r\nattached singly though irregularly[484]. These vessels at their base do\r\nnot open into the cavity of the intestinal canal, but merely into the\r\nspace between its outer and inner tunicks, the last being constantly\r\nimperforated[485].\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _apex_, the bile-vessels are sometimes _fixed_\r\nsingly or connectedly to the intestine merely by a few muscular fibres;\r\nfor they do not enter it, their ends having no orifice. This structure\r\nis mostly to be met with in the _Coleoptera_[486]. In caterpillars,\r\nthe tops of these vessels perforate the outer skin of the rectum, and\r\nproceeding in dense convolutions to the anus, become at last so fine\r\nthat their terminations cannot be discovered[487]. In other cases,\r\nthe extremities of a pair of these vessels _unite_ so as to form a\r\ndouble one: this may be seen in those of _Philonthus politus_[488], and\r\nprobably other rove-beetles: and lastly, in others the bile-vessels are\r\n_free_, hanging down by the intestinal canal, without being attached\r\nto it or to each other. This structure is constantly found in the\r\n_Orthoptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ Orders, &c.[489].\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _number_, the bile-vessels vary from two to\r\nupwards of one hundred and fifty, yet so that their whole amount is\r\nconstantly the product of the number two,--at least as far as they\r\nhave been counted: and even when those on one side are not alike,\r\na similar variation takes place in the other, as may be seen in\r\n_Galleruca Vitellinæ_, where on each side are two long ones and one\r\nshorter[490]; the most usual numbers are, _four_--_six_--or _many_,\r\nthat is, more than _twenty_--\r\n\r\n  _Two_ bile-vessels are found in the larva of _Cetonia aurata_[491].\r\n\r\n  _Four_                          most _Coleoptera_, _Diptera_,\r\n                                         and _Hemiptera_[492].\r\n\r\n  _Six_                           _Lepidoptera_, some _Coleoptera_[493],\r\n                                         &c.\r\n\r\n  _Eight_                         _Myrmeleon_, _Hemerobius_[494].\r\n\r\n  _Fourteen_                      _Formica rufa_[495].\r\n\r\n  _Twenty_                        larva of _Clavellaria Amerinæ_[496].\r\n\r\n  _Many_                          _Libellulina_, _Orthoptera_, and\r\n                                          _Hymenoptera_[497].\r\n\r\nThe bile-vessels vary considerably in _length_: in many cases where\r\nthey are _free_ they are _short_[498]; they are often very long,\r\nand perhaps those that are _fixed_ may be generally stated as the\r\nlongest. In the Lamellicorn beetles they are remarkable for their\r\ngreat length[499].\r\n\r\nHaving given you this general account of the intestinal canal and its\r\nparts and appendages, I shall now state some of the peculiarities\r\nthat in this respect distinguish particular tribes and families.\r\n\r\nThe _Coleoptera_ alone, exhibit as many variations in the\r\nstructure of the alimentary tube as all the other Orders of\r\ninsects together:--to particularize these would occupy too large\r\na portion of this letter, I shall therefore only notice a few\r\nof the most remarkable. In general they may be stated as having\r\nuniversally a stomach, a small intestine and rectum, and not more\r\nthan _three_ pairs of _fixed_ or _united_ bile-vessels. In the\r\nPredaceous beetles, the _gullet_ mostly widens at the base into a\r\nconsiderable _crop_, followed by a _gizzard_, a shaggy _stomach_,\r\nand two pairs of _united_ bile-vessels. The whole alimentary canal\r\nin these, is never less than _double_, and sometimes _treble_ the\r\nlength of the body[500]. In the _carnivorous_ beetles, at least the\r\n_Staphylinidæ_ and _Silphidæ_, there is little or no _crop_, and\r\nthe _gizzard_ is hidden: in the former, the whole length of the\r\nintestinal canal is not _twice_, while in the latter it is more than\r\n_four_ times that of the body[501]. In these also the intermediate\r\nportion of the large intestine is singularly annulated[502]. In the\r\n_Petalocera_ the _stomach_ is usually longer than all the rest of\r\nthe intestines together, and often convoluted: in the cockchafer\r\nthe whole intestinal canal is nearly _five_ times the length of the\r\nbody, _four_ parts of which is occupied by the stomach[503]. In\r\nthe grub the canal scarcely exceeds the length of the animal[504].\r\nIn _Lampyris_ the stomach exhibits a remarkable appearance, having\r\non each side a series of spherical _folds_ or _vesicles_[505].\r\nHave these any thing to do with the secretion of its phosphoric\r\nmatter? _Tenebrio_ has a _gizzard_ armed internally with calluses,\r\nand a shaggy stomach, and _Blaps_ does not differ materially;\r\ntheir entire canal is more than twice the length of the body[506].\r\nIn the _vesicatory_ beetles (_Cantharis_, _Meloe_, &c.) there is\r\nno _gizzard_, and the canal is less than twice the length of the\r\nbody[507]. Little is known with regard to the alimentary canal of\r\nthe beetles distinguished by a _rostrum_ (_Rhyncophora_). In the\r\nonly two that appear to have been examined, _Rhynchites Betuleti_ and\r\n_Cryptorhynchus Lapathi_, that canal is moderately long, the stomach\r\npartially shaggy, and the small intestine inversely claviform; but\r\nin other respects they differ materially[508]. In the former there\r\nis no crop or gizzard, the stomach is fringed on each side, except\r\nat its upper extremity, with a series of small _cœca_ or shags, and\r\nthere are _three_ pairs of bile-vessels[509]; while in the latter\r\nthe gullet is dilated into a crop which includes a gizzard in which\r\nthe skill of a DIVINE artist is singularly conspicuous:--though\r\nso minute as scarcely to exceed a large pin's head in size, it is\r\nstated to be armed internally with more than 400 pairs of teeth,\r\nmoved by an infinitely greater number of muscles[510]. A transverse\r\nsection of this gizzard represents two concentric stars, with nine\r\nrays each[511]: the object of this structure is, the comminution\r\nof the timber which this beetle has to perforate and probably\r\ndevour[512]. The stomach is very slender, but dilates in the middle\r\ninto a spherical vesicle[513], and there are only two pairs of\r\nbile-vessels[514]. In the _Capricorn_ beetles, the part we are\r\nconsidering varies much: in general we may observe that it is more\r\nthan _double_ the length of the body, that the stomach is long\r\nand slender, and usually naked, that the gullet terminates in a\r\ncrop without a distinct gizzard, and that there are _three_ pairs\r\nof bile-vessels[515]. In the Herbivorous beetles (_Chrysomela_,\r\n_Cassida_, &c.) the canal is more than double the length of the\r\nbody, and in some much longer[516], the stomach is long, and commonly\r\nnaked; but in _Chrysomela violacea_ it is covered with hemispherical\r\nprominences[517], and in _Chrysomela Populi_ it is shaggy[518]; in\r\nthe insect last named and _Galleruca Vitellinæ_ the rectum consists\r\nof _two_ pieces[519]. In this tribe the intestines of the larva\r\nresemble those of the perfect insect[520].\r\n\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_ the alimentary canal, which continues the same in\r\nevery state, is short, or only moderately long; the gullet has one\r\nor two lateral pouches or crops[521], and terminates in a gizzard\r\nof curious construction, with singular folds and teeth[522]; then\r\nfollows a short stomach, usually with a pair or more of _cœca_ at its\r\nupper extremity[523]; the lower intestines are not distinct, and the\r\nbile-vessels numerous, short and free[524].\r\n\r\nIn the _Neuroptera_, many of the genera are distinguished by the\r\nremarkable length of the gullet, and by the lower intestines forming\r\none short piece[525]. In the _Libellulina_ the bile-vessels are\r\nnumerous, short, and free, as in the _Orthoptera_[526]. In _Hemerobius_\r\nand _Myrmeleon_ there is a gizzard[527], and just above it a _cœcum_,\r\nin the former very remarkable, is connected with the gullet[528].\r\n\r\nThe _Hymenoptera_ appear all to be distinguished by a long slender\r\ngullet, terminating in a dilated crop forming the honey-bag; their\r\nstomach is variable, their small intestine slender, and the rectum\r\ndilated;--their bile-vessels, like those of the two preceding\r\nOrders, are numerous, short, and free[529]. In the ants and\r\nichneumons there is an approach to a gizzard[530]. In the wasp and\r\nhumble-bee the stomach is very long, with muscular rings surrounding\r\nit[531]. In this Order the larvæ at first have no lower intestines\r\nand void no excrement[532], but as they approach to the pupa state\r\none begins to appear[533].\r\n\r\nThe next insects whose alimentary canal we are to consider, are those\r\nwhich, taking their food by _suction_, have no occasion for masticating\r\norgans: this may in part be predicated of the preceding Order, in\r\nwhich most of the tribes in their perfect state _imbibe_ fluid food,\r\nand use the ordinary organs of _mastication_ principally in operations\r\nconnected with their economy; and their crop, in which the honey in\r\nmany is stored up for regurgitation, may be regarded in some degree as\r\nanalogous to the food-bag of the _Diptera_ and other suctorious insects.\r\n\r\nThe two sections of the _Hemiptera_ Order differ widely in the canal\r\nwe are considering, and I shall therefore give a separate account of\r\neach. In the _Heteropterous_ section, appended to the gullet by a\r\nlong convoluted capillary tube, besides the usual saliva-reservoirs\r\nthere is often a double vessel, which Ramdohr regards as discharging\r\nthe same function, but which in many respects seems rather analogous\r\nto the food-reservoir of the _Diptera_[534]. As I have had no\r\nopportunity of examining this vessel, I shall content myself with\r\nstating this idea, and describe the vessel more fully hereafter. The\r\ngullet, in these, usually terminates in an ample crop consisting\r\nof many folds[535], followed by a long, slender, cylindrical tube,\r\ndilated at its base into a spherical tumour; these two may be said to\r\nform the first stomach: to this succeeds a second[536], which Ramdohr\r\ndenominates the _bug_-stomach (_Wanzen-magen_), which varies in its\r\nfigure, and in _Pentatoma_ consists of four demi-tubes, so as to form\r\na quadrangular canal[537]. In the _Homopterous_ section of this Order\r\nRamdohr seems to have examined but few; _Chermes_ however and _Aphis_\r\nexhibit one remarkable feature; they have _no bile-vessels_, at least\r\nhe could discover no trace of these organs[538]. Their intestinal\r\ncanal is very simple, their stomach very long, widest above, and\r\nsomewhat convoluted, with a very slender gullet[539]. In _Cercopis\r\nspumaria_ the structure is more complex, and extremely singular. It\r\nhas _two_ or rather _three_ stomachs; the two first of a _horny_\r\nsubstance, and the last a slender somewhat convoluted _membranous_\r\ntube, which becoming reversed, is attached by what should be deemed\r\nits lower extremity to the first stomach, from the other side of\r\nwhich emerge the lower intestines, terminating in a thick pear-shaped\r\nrectum. At the same point of the first stomach the four bile-vessels\r\nare attached, they grow gradually thicker for about a third of their\r\nlength, when they become twisted like a cord, and taper towards the\r\nrectum, to which also they are attached[540]. From this structure\r\nit should seem that the food has to pass twice through the first\r\nstomach, before the process of digestion is complete, and it is\r\nrejected at the anus.\r\n\r\nThe next suctorious Order is the _Lepidoptera_: in these the gullet\r\nis long and slender, surrounded at the beginning with a loose\r\ntransparent skin, and at the base furnished with a pair of lateral\r\nsacs, forming the honey-stomach, and probably analogous to the\r\nfood-reservoirs of the _Diptera_, which when blown up are of an oval\r\nform; the stomach, as in the bugs, consists of _two_ portions, the\r\nfirst being the longest[541]. There are three _free_ bile-vessels\r\non each side, proceeding from a single branch[542]. It will not be\r\nuninteresting here to abstract from Herold the progressive changes\r\nwhich take place in the intestinal canal in this Order, during the\r\ntransition of the animal from the larva to the imago state. In the\r\n_larva_, the gullet, the small intestine, and the rectum, are short\r\nand thick[543], there are a pair of silk reservoirs (_sericteria_),\r\nas well as vessels for the secretion of saliva (_sialisteria_):\r\nif you examine it two days after its first change, you will find\r\nthe gullet and the small intestine much lengthened and become very\r\nslender; the stomach contracted both in length and size; the rectum\r\nalso changed, and the silk vessels contracted[544]. These in a\r\n_pupa_ eight days old have wholly disappeared; the gullet is become\r\nstill longer, its base is dilated into a crop or food-reservoir;\r\nthe stomach is still more contracted, and instead of a cylinder\r\nrepresents a spindle; the small intestine also is lengthened[545]:\r\nat a still more advanced period, when it is near appearing under\r\nits last form, the gullet and small intestine are still more drawn\r\nout; and the honey-bag, though very minute, has become a lateral\r\nappendage of the gullet[546]; and lastly, in the butterfly it appears\r\nas a large vesicle[547]; the small intestine is grown very long[548];\r\nand the rectum has changed its form and acquired a cœcum[549]. When\r\nwe consider the adaptation of all these changes of form, the loss\r\nof old organs and the acquisition of new ones, to the new functions\r\nand mode of life of the animal, we see evidently the all-powerful\r\nhand of that ALMIGHTY BEING who created the universe, upholding by\r\nhis providence, and the law that he has given to every creature, the\r\nsystem that he at first brought into existence.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the _Diptera_. These have a very slender gullet, to\r\nwhich is attached on one side a long filiform tube, terminating in\r\nthe food-reservoir, which in some instances is simple[550], but\r\nmost generally consists of two or more vessels[551], collapsing\r\nwhen empty, but varying in shape and size when inflated with food:\r\nthe mouth of the stomach in many cases is dilated into a kind of\r\nring[552]; sometimes there is on each side a blind appendage or\r\n_cœcum_ opening into it, in _Bombylius_ covered with shags, which\r\nthough not connected with the mouth by a tube, Ramdohr regards as\r\nsaliva-reservoirs[553]; in _Musca vomitoria_ the beginning of this\r\norgan below the mouth is covered with hemispherical prominences, and\r\nin _Tipula_ it is dilated and marked with transverse folds. There are\r\nusually _two_ pairs of bile-vessels; in the _Muscidæ_ pedunculate\r\nand _free_[554]; in _Tipula_, _Bombylius_, and _Leptis_, sessile\r\nand _united_[555]; and in _Tabanus_ sessile and _fixed_[556]. It is\r\nremarkable that in some of this Order--the reverse of what usually\r\nhappens--the alimentary canal appears to be much longer in the larva\r\nthan it is in the imago; in _Musca vomitoria_, its length in the\r\n_former_ is two inches and a quarter, while in the _latter_ it is\r\nonly one inch and one third[557]. A singular organ distinguishes the\r\nimago of this species, the use of which appears not to be discovered.\r\nIt succeeds the _rectum_, and has on each side two short club-shaped\r\nappendages, open at the end, which receive _tracheæ_, and terminate\r\nin a short piece that opens into the anus[558].\r\n\r\nIn _Hippobosca_ and its affinities the canal in question differs\r\nfrom that of other _Diptera_, in having no food-reservoir; in other\r\nrespects it resembles it[559].\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement it appears that the principal character\r\nwhich distinguishes those that take their food by _suction_,\r\nfrom those that _masticate_ it, is the faculty with which they\r\nare furnished by means of an ample crop, honey-stomach, or\r\nfood-reservoir, of _regurgitating_ the food they may have stored\r\nup. Another distinction still more striking, which will appear more\r\nevidently hereafter, is to be seen in the _saliva-secretors_ with\r\nwhich the _suctorious_ tribes are furnished, to be found in very few\r\n_masticators_, by which they are enabled to render the juices more\r\nfluid and fit for suction.\r\n\r\nThe only insect amongst the _Aptera_ whose alimentary canal I\r\nshall notice, is the common harvest-man (_Phalangium Opilio_): in\r\nthis, though the stomach and lower intestine are remarkably simple,\r\nyet their cœcal appendages are numerous and singular: the former,\r\nwhich has no distinct gullet, is pear-shaped[560]; and the latter,\r\ntapering downwards, and truncated at the end[561]; connected with\r\nit above are no less than twenty-three _cœca_ or blind appendages,\r\nof various forms and dimensions; the last pair but one of which is\r\nvery remarkable, being bent like a bow, and furnished externally with\r\nfour short clavate processes[562]. It is probable that some of these\r\norgans are analogous to the bile-vessels of other insects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the CREATOR in his wisdom fixed the limits of the various tribes\r\nof animals, he united them all into one harmonious system by means\r\nof certain intermediate forms, exhibiting characters taken some\r\nfrom those that were to precede, and others from those that were\r\nto follow them, and this not only in their _external_ structure,\r\nbut likewise in their _internal_ organization; so that we are\r\nnot to wonder if in the same individual we meet with organs that\r\nbelong to two distinct tribes, or if, remaining nearly the _same_\r\nin their _prima facie_ appearance, they begin to exercise _new_\r\nfunctions. An instance of this we have seen in the dorsal vessel of\r\ninsects, which in the _Arachnida_, though not materially different\r\nin situation or general form, by the addition of a small apparatus\r\nof arteries and veins becomes the centre and fountain of a regular\r\nsystem of circulation[563]. From the circumstances here alluded to,\r\nphysiologists have been led to entertain very different sentiments\r\nwith regard to the structure of the alimentary organs of the Class we\r\nare now to enter upon, the _Arachnida_: what some regard as a real\r\n_liver_, others look upon as an _epiploon_ or caul; and what the\r\nlast denominate _bile_-vessels are by some of the former considered\r\nas appropriated to the secretion of _chyle_[564]. Yet both these\r\nopinions have some foundation in nature. When, in the _Arachnida_,\r\nwe discover a lobular substance consisting of granules filling the\r\nwhole cavity of the body and wrapped round the intestines, every one\r\nwill see in it no small analogy to the _epiploon_ which in insects\r\nperforms the same function: but when, upon a further examination,\r\nwe detect certain vessels communicating with this substance and the\r\nintestinal canal[565], the idea that these may be _hepatic ducts_,\r\nand this substance analogous to the _liver_, immediately strikes us\r\nas not improbable. Again: when we discover pairs of other capillary\r\nand tortuous vessels connecting with the intestinal canal either at\r\nthe _pylorus_[566] or below it[567], which in appearance strikingly\r\nresemble the bile-vessels which we so constantly find in insects,\r\nwe seem warranted in concluding that they are of the same nature\r\nand use: but when a nearer inspection enables us to detect the\r\nhepatic ducts just mentioned in the scorpion, and we find that these\r\ncapillary vessels in the spider are in a very different situation\r\nfrom those in insects which we suppose them to represent, it occurs\r\nto us as not unlikely, that their _function_ may be different.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how the intestinal canal is circumstanced in\r\nthe two sections into which the Class _Arachnida_ is divided; the\r\n_Scorpionidea_, and _Araneidea_. In the Scorpions, this organ proceeds\r\nfrom the mouth to the anus without any flexure or convolution, so that\r\nits length is scarcely equal to that of the body[568]; it is slender,\r\nand its diameter, with the exception of an irregular dilatation here\r\nand there, is nearly the same in its whole extent; the gullet is short;\r\nthe stomach long, and nearly cylindrical; the _duodenum_ shorter and\r\nthicker than the stomach, from which, as well as from the _rectum_, it\r\nis separated by a valve; the latter is cylindrical, and opens at the\r\nanus above the insertion of the vesicle that secretes the poison[569].\r\nWith regard to the _biliary_ system and its organs: The _liver_ is of\r\na pulpy granular consistence and of a brownish colour, fills the whole\r\ncavity of the trunk and abdomen, and serves as a bed for the other\r\nintestines. It is divided longitudinally into two portions, by the\r\nchannel in which the heart reposes--its anterior part is formed into\r\nmany irregular lobes, by the sinuosities of the trunk; at the other\r\nextremity, it terminates in two acute ends, which enter the first joint\r\nof the tail; its surface presents a reticular appearance, the result of\r\nthe approximation of polygonous _lobuli_; its interior is a tissue of\r\ninfinitely minute glands: in _Scorpio occitanus_ there are about forty\r\npyramidal _lobuli_ detached from each other, the summits of which, by\r\ntheir union, form bunches that have their excretory canals, varying in\r\nnumber in different species, which convey the bile to the alimentary\r\ntube; in the above insect there are six pairs, three in the trunk and\r\nthree in the abdomen, and in _S. Europæus_ a smaller number[570]; these\r\nvessels run transversely from the liver, or aggregation of conglomerate\r\nglands, to the intestinal canal[571]; the bunches consist of an\r\ninfinite number of spherical glands, generally filled with a brown\r\nthick fluid[572]: besides the transverse vessels, from the base of the\r\nstomach there issue two pairs of very slender tortuous ones, seemingly\r\nanalogous to the common bile-vessels; one pair of which runs upwards,\r\none on each side that organ towards the mouth, forming here and there\r\nsome ramifications which enter the liver; and the other runs nearly\r\ntransversely to it[573]. As the fluid contained in these vessels is\r\ndifferent from that contained in the glands of the liver, M. Marcel de\r\nSerres supposes they may be chyliferous[574].\r\n\r\nIn the _Araneidea_ also the alimentary canal is nearly straight,\r\nand scarcely exceeds the length of the body: the _gullet_ is rather\r\nthick and cylindrical[575]; the _stomach_ is distinguished anteriorly\r\nby two pairs of sacs, the upper pair being much the largest and\r\nnearly triangular, the lower linear[576]; from these sacs a narrow\r\ntube runs towards the _rectum_, but which is so entangled with the\r\nliver, muscles, &c., as not to be easily made out[577]; the _rectum_\r\nis rather tumid, and has a lateral _cœcum_[578]. The disposition of\r\nthe liver or conglomerate glands is stated to be similar to that of\r\nthe scorpion[579]; it is usually white, but in some species it is\r\nyellowish, or reddish, and its lower surface has sometimes regular\r\nexcavations[580]; no transverse hepatic ducts connecting it with the\r\nalimentary canal, as in the scorpion, appear to have been at present\r\ndiscovered: two pairs of capillary _free_ vessels are attached to the\r\nbase of the _rectum_ on one side, which, except in their situation,\r\nseem analogous to the bile-vessels of insects[581].\r\n\r\nFrom the above detailed account of the alimentary canal of the\r\nanimals whose internal anatomy we are considering, it appears that\r\nM. Cuvier's observation--that the length and complication of the\r\nintestines indicate a less substantial kind of nutriment--does not\r\nhold universally: thus, in _Necrophorus_ and _Silpha_, _carnivorous_\r\ninsects, the intestinal canal in its length and convolutions exceeds\r\nthose of most _herbivorous_ ones, and in _Cassida viridis_ and\r\nsome others of the _latter_ tribe are not longer than those of the\r\n_predaceous_ beetles. In _herbivorous larvæ_ also, in general, the\r\nlength of the alimentary canal does not exceed that of the body, but\r\nin those of some _flesh_-flies (_Musca vomitoria_) it very greatly\r\nexceeds it[582]. So true is the observation--that there is no general\r\nrule without exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn this letter it may not be out of place to say a few words upon the\r\n_excrements_ of insects; which, strange as the observation may seem,\r\nbut it is no less true than strange, are sometimes pleasing to the\r\neye, from their symmetry, and to the taste, from their sweetness. In\r\nthose that masticate their food they are solid, and in those that\r\ntake it by suction, fluid or semi-fluid. In the caterpillars of\r\n_Lepidoptera_ they are of the former description, and every grain\r\nwears some resemblance to an insect's egg: as the passage in many\r\nof these consists of _six_ fleshy parts separated by channels,\r\nso the excrement represents six little prisms separated by six\r\nchannels[583]. The _Aphides_ all secrete a fluid excrement as sweet\r\nas honey, of which the ants are so fond[584], which is ejected not\r\nonly at the anal passage, but, in many, by two little siphonets also\r\nabove it[585]. A semi-fluid excrement is produced by some species of\r\n_Chermes_, as that which inhabits the Box, which often comes from the\r\nanimal in long convoluted strings resembling vermicelli. Reaumur says\r\nits taste is agreeable, much more so than that of manna[586]. Under\r\nthis head should be included the abundant spume with which the larva\r\nof _Cercopis spumaria_ envelopes itself[587].\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[418] _Anat.

Though no individual amongst\r\nthem perhaps secretes so many different substances as the warm-blooded\r\nanimals; yet in general the Class abounds in secretions perhaps as\r\nnumerous and extraordinary as in the last-mentioned tribes, to some\r\nof which a few of them are analogous, while others are altogether\r\npeculiar. We know little or nothing of the mode in which the process\r\nof secretion in insects is accomplished; in most cases we cannot even\r\ndiscover, except in general, whence the secreted substance originates;\r\nand in others, though we are able to trace the vessels that contain\r\nit, we are often in the dark as to their structure.--Cuvier, as has\r\nbeen before hinted, from not being able to detect any thing in them\r\nlike _glands_, and from their being constantly bathed in the _blood_ or\r\nnutritive fluid, conceives that they separate the peculiar substances\r\nthey contain, by imbibition or infiltration, through the pores of\r\nthe skin[588]; a circumstance which seems to indicate a certain\r\nconformation of the pores both as to size and figure, so as to enable\r\nthem to admit only one peculiar product.\r\n\r\nIn treating on this subject, I shall first consider the _organs_ of\r\nsecretion, and next their _products_.\r\n\r\nI. _Organs of Secretion._ In general, these are membranous vessels\r\nthat float in the blood or nutritive fluid, and secrete from it\r\na peculiar substance. They may be denominated according to their\r\nproducts--_Silk-secretors_, _Saliva-secretors_, _Varnish-secretor_,\r\n_Jelly_ or _Gluten-secretor_, _Poison-secretor_, and _Scent-secretors_.\r\n\r\ni. _Silk-Secretors_ (_Sericteria_). These organs are most remarkable in\r\nthe caterpillars of the _nocturnal Lepidoptera_ or moths, especially\r\nin that tribe called _Bombyces_, to which the silkworm belongs: but\r\nthis faculty is not confined to these insects, but is shared by many\r\nother _larvæ_ in different Orders; and in one instance at least, by\r\nthe _imago_. In general, the outlet of the silk-secretors is at the\r\n_mouth_; sometimes, however, as in the larva of _Myrmeleon_ and the\r\nimago of _Hydrophilus_, its exit is at the _anus_. The first is the\r\norgan which in the silk-worm provides for us that beautiful substance\r\nfrom which the animal takes its name. There are always _two_ of these\r\nvessels, which are long floating tubes, growing slender towards the\r\nhead of the insect, where they unite to form the spinneret (_fusulus_)\r\nbefore described[589], which renders the silk. Their lower extremity\r\nalso is commonly more slender than the middle, and is closed at the\r\nend. These organs are usually very much convoluted and twisted[590].\r\nAccording to Ramdohr[591], they consist of two transparent membranes,\r\nbetween which is found a yellow or transparent jelly. The greater the\r\nquantity of silk employed by the caterpillar in the construction of its\r\ncocoon, &c., the longer are the silk-secretors. Those of the silkworm\r\nare a _foot_ long[592], while those of the larva of the goat-moth are\r\nlittle more than _three inches_[593].\r\n\r\nOther insects spin silk with the _posterior_ extremity of their\r\nbody. In the great water-beetle (_Hydrophilus piceus_) the\r\nanus is furnished with two spinnerets, with which it spins its\r\negg-pouch[594]; these are in connexion, probably, with the five long\r\nand large vessels containing a green fluid, described by Cuvier[595],\r\nwhich surround the base of each branch of the ovaries. The larva\r\nof _Myrmeleon_, which also spins a cocoon with its anus, differs\r\nremarkably in this respect from other insects, since its reservoir\r\nfor the matter of silk is the _rectum_; this is connected with a\r\nhorny tube, which the animal can protrude, and thus agglutinate the\r\nsilk and grains of sand that compose its cocoon[596].\r\n\r\nThe _web_ of spiders is also a kind of _silk_ remarkable for its\r\nlightness and extreme tenuity. It is spun from four anal spinnerets,\r\nwhich never vary in number; two longer organs peculiar to some species\r\nhave been mistaken for additional ones, but Treviranus affirms that\r\nthey are merely a kind of anal _feeler_. Their structure, as far\r\nas known, has been before described[597]. The web is secreted in\r\nvessels varying in form. In some (_Clubiona atrox_) they consist of\r\ntwo larger and two smaller ones, at the base of which lie many still\r\nmore minute[598]. The four larger vessels are wide in the middle,\r\nbranching at top, and below terminating in a narrow canal leading to\r\nthe spinnerets[599]. Treviranus thinks the fluid contained in the lower\r\nminute vessels different from that furnished by the larger ones--but\r\nfor what purpose it is employed has not been ascertained.\r\n\r\nii. _Saliva-secretors_ (_Sialisteria_). These are organs, rendering\r\na fluid to the mouth or stomach, that are found in many insects,\r\nespecially those that take their food by _suction_, as the\r\n_Hemiptera_, _Lepidoptera_, and _Diptera_, though they are not\r\nconfined to the perfect insect, being also in some cases visible in\r\nthe larva. Swammerdam was one of the first that discovered them,\r\nand he suspects that they may be _salival_ vessels; though he, as\r\nwell as Ramdohr, thinks they are the same with the _silk_ vessels\r\nof the caterpillar[600]; an opinion which Herold has sufficiently\r\ndisproved, by showing that at one period of the insect's life they\r\nco-exist[601], and Lyonet discovered a very conspicuous pair in the\r\ncaterpillar of the Cossus, co-existent with the silk-secretors[602].\r\nBut the physiologist who has given the fullest account of these\r\norgans is Ramdohr:--I shall therefore extract chiefly from him what I\r\nhave further to communicate with respect to them.\r\n\r\nThey are variously constructed blind vessels, that are present in\r\nalmost all insects that take their food by _suction_, but are mostly\r\nwanting in those that _masticate_ it. They have been found, however, in\r\n_Cryptorhynchus Lapathi_, _Chrysopa Perla_, and _Iulus terrestris_.\r\nThe most usual number of the saliva-secretors is _two_[603]; but\r\nsometimes, as in the first of the last-named insects, there is only\r\n_one_[604]; in others (_Pentatoma Baccarum_) there are _three_, the\r\nexterior one consisting of a pair of reservoirs connecting with the\r\ngullet by a single capillary tube[605]; in _Pentatoma prasina_ there\r\nappear to be _four_[606]; in _Nepa cinerea_, even _six_--the exterior\r\ndouble pair in this insect, under a powerful lens, is found to consist\r\nof spherical vesicles, resembling somewhat a bunch of currants[607];\r\nand in _Syrphus arcuatus_ they are covered with _four_ rows of\r\nsimilar ones[608]. In the flea they consist of two pair of spherical\r\nreservoirs, each of which is connected with a short tube, which uniting\r\nwith that of the other forms a common capillary one connecting with the\r\nmouth or gullet[609]; these organs sometimes terminate below in slender\r\nvessels;--thus, in _Nepa_, the inner pair terminates in a single vessel\r\nof this description[610], and in _Tabanus_ and _Hemerobius_ apparently\r\nin many[611]. It admits of a doubt however, as was lately observed,\r\nwhether in the _Hemiptera_, which have usually more than a _pair_ of\r\nthese organs, some are not rather _food-reservoirs_ as in the _Diptera_.\r\n\r\nThe saliva-secretors open either into the _instruments_ of _suction_\r\nthemselves (_Tabanus_, _Musca_); or into the entrance of the _gullet_\r\n(_Pentatoma_, &c.); or, lastly, into that of the _stomach_ (_Syrphus_,\r\n_Bombylius_). Those which lie at the entrance of the _stomach_ consist\r\nonly of a blind uniform _tube_[612]; but there is commonly to be\r\ndistinguished in those that open into the _mouth_, a _reservoir_,\r\nvarying in shape in different species, and terminating in a capillary\r\ntube, or tubes, at one or both extremities[613]. In Bugs, _two_ pair\r\nof these vessels are often present, one of which opens into the\r\nstomach (_Reduvius_), or gullet (_Pentatoma_), but the other into\r\nthe instruments of suction[614]. In the _Diptera_ they open into\r\nthe stomach when the insect feeds only upon the nectar of flowers\r\n(_Syrphus_), and into the proboscis when it feeds upon both animal\r\nand vegetable juices (_Tabanus_, _Musca_). The function of the fluid\r\nsecreted by these organs is to moisten or dilute the food before it is\r\nreceived by the instruments of suction and passed to the stomach[615].\r\nWhen a common house-fly applies its proboscis to a piece of sugar, it\r\nis easy to see that it moistens and dissolves it by some fluid.\r\n\r\niii. _Varnish-secretor_ (_Colleterium_). In butterflies, moths, and\r\nseveral other insects, one or more vessels called blind vessels open\r\ninto the oviduct, concerning the use of which, physiologists are not\r\nagreed. In the cabbage butterfly there is a pair of ovate ones, or\r\nrather a bilobed one, each lobe of which externally terminates in\r\nlong perplexed convolutions, not easily traced, filled with a yellow\r\nfluid, which Reaumur and Herold think is used for varnishing or\r\ngumming the eggs, so that they may adhere to the leaves on which they\r\nare deposited: it may probably serve likewise for other uses[616].\r\nAnother vessel is also to be found in the above butterfly, which\r\nenters the oviduct above this, filled with a thick white fluid, the\r\nfunction of which is, probably, to lubricate the passage[617]. A\r\nsimilar organ is found in _Phryganea grandis_[618].\r\n\r\niv. _Jelly-secretor_ (_Corysterium_). This is a remarkable organ,\r\nrelated to the preceding, which secretes the jelly of _Trichoptera_,\r\nsome _Diptera_, &c.; this organ in the former, at least in _Phryganea\r\ngrandis_, is of an irregular shape, with four horns or processes[619].\r\n\r\n_Poison-secretor_ (_Ioterium_). This organ, which is most conspicuous\r\nin the _Hymenoptera_ Order, has not received much notice, except in\r\nthe case of the Hive-bee and the _Scolia_: in the former, it is an\r\nelliptical membranous vesicle or reservoir, furnished at its lower\r\nextremity with a tube which renders to the sting, and at the other by a\r\nblind, long, filiform, secretory, vessel, which according to Swammerdam\r\ndivides into _two_ terminal blind branches[620], though Reaumur could\r\ndetect but _one_[621]; in this vessel the poison is secreted and\r\nstored up. In _Scolia_ there are two secretory vessels, which enter\r\nthe reservoir in the middle on each side[622]. In the _Scorpion_,\r\nwe learn from Marcel de Serres that the poison-secretor is clothed\r\nexternally with a horny thickish membrane, containing two yellowish\r\nglands, composed of an infinity of spherical glandules, terminating\r\nin a canal, enlarged towards its base so as to form a reservoir, and\r\nleading to the extremity of the sting[623]. Connected by a slender\r\ntube with each mandible in _spiders_ is a vessel with spiral folds,\r\nwhich seems properly to belong to _this_ head--though Treviranus\r\ncalls it a _saliva_-vessel[624]--since in the _Mygale avicularia_ and\r\nother spiders, the effect of the bite is said to be so venomous as to\r\noccasion considerable inflammation, and sometimes death[625].\r\n\r\nv. _Scent-secretors_ (_Osmateria_). Amongst other means with which\r\ninsects are gifted for the annoyance of their foes and pursuers, are\r\nthe powerful _scents_ which many of them emit when alarmed and in\r\ndanger. Concerning the _internal_ organs by which these effluvia are\r\n_secreted_ we possess but little information, but more notice has\r\nbeen taken of the _external_ ones by which they are _emitted_. We may\r\nconclude in general, that the secretory organs are membranous sacs\r\nor vesicles, perhaps terminating in longer or shorter blind filiform\r\nvessels, sometimes secreting a fetid fluid, and at others a fetid\r\ngaseous effluvium. The _Iulidæ_, at least _Iulus_ and _Porcellio_[626],\r\ncover themselves when alarmed, with a _fluid_ of this kind, or emit\r\none, for this faculty is not peculiar to the species noticed by Savi. I\r\nobserved early in the year, when I handled _Iulus terrestris_, that it\r\nwas covered with a slimy secretion, of a powerful scent, which stained\r\nmy fingers of an orange colour. The spiraculiform pores that mark the\r\nsides of the animal are the outlets by which this fluid is emitted,\r\nand not spiracles as has been supposed: each of these orifices, as\r\nwe learn from Savi, terminates internally in a black vesicle, which\r\nis the reservoir of the fluid[627]. The most remarkable insect for\r\nits powers of annoyance in this way, is one on that account called\r\nthe _bombardier_ (_Brachinus crepitans_), which can fire numerous\r\nvolleys of stinking vapour at its assailants before its ammunition is\r\nexhausted[628]. M. Dufour has given a very particular account of the\r\norgan that secretes this vapour;--it consists of a double apparatus,\r\none on each side, in the cavity of the abdomen, both formed of two\r\ndistinct vessels. The _first_, which is the innermost, presents\r\nitself under two different aspects, according as it is contracted or\r\ndilated: in the former case it is a whitish, irregularly rounded, soft\r\nbody, apparently glandular, placed under the last abdominal segments;\r\ncommunicating at one end with the reservoir, and terminating constantly\r\nat the other in a very long and slender filament: in the second case,\r\nor when it is dilated, it resembles an oblong, membranous, diaphanous\r\nsac, filled with air, then occupying the whole length of the abdomen,\r\nand appearing free except where it communicates with the reservoir. The\r\n_second_ vessel or reservoir is a small, spherical, brown or reddish\r\nbody, constant in its form, internally hollow, placed under the last\r\ndorsal segment, precisely above the _rectum_, and opening by a small\r\npore into the _anus_[629]: so that the tail of this little beetle may\r\nbe regarded as a battery mounted with two pieces of cannon, which our\r\nalert bombardier fires alternately without intermission till all his\r\nammunition is expended. The ground-beetles (_Eutrech_in_a_) in general\r\nhave a pair of these anal scent-secretors, which discharge an acrid\r\nand caustic fluid, and sometimes a volatile one[630]. The external\r\norgan of the scent-secretors in _Gyrinus_ consists of two minute hairy\r\ncylindrical retractile tubes, of a red colour[631]. Numerous insects\r\nof other tribes and genera emit _scents_ from their anus, and from\r\nvarious other parts of the body, of which having before given you a\r\nvery full account[632], I shall proceed to the consideration of the\r\nsecretions themselves: but first I must observe, that in many cases,\r\nas in some of the cottony and powdery _Aphides_, _Chermes_, &c., the\r\nsubstance secreted appears to be a transpiration through the pores of\r\nthe body, a kind of excretion from the superabundance of its fluid\r\ncontents[633]. In many, however, this secretion transpires through\r\nappropriate orifices: thus in _Chermes Abietis_, which produces those\r\ncurious galls resembling the cone of a fir[634], the flocoons of\r\nseeming cotton that cover it proceed from little oval concavities on\r\nits back, four of which are arranged in a transverse line on each\r\ndorsal segment of the abdomen: these concavities have minute tubercles\r\nprobably terminating in a pore[635]. In _Aphis Fagi_ the cottony\r\nflocoons are almost an inch long[636].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _secretions_ of insects may be considered under the following\r\nheads--_Silk_; _Saliva_; _Varnish_ or _Gum_; _Jelly_; _Oils_;\r\n_Milk_; _Honey_; _Wax_; _Poisons_ and _Acids_; _Odorous fluids_ and\r\n_Vapours_; and _Luminous matter_.\r\n\r\ni. _Silk._ This valuable product of insects, while in the\r\nsilk-secretor, assumes in the _Lepidoptera_ the appearance of a viscid\r\ngum, but the moment it is exposed to the air it hardens into a silken\r\nthread. It is remarkable for the following qualities:--it dries the\r\ninstant it comes in contact with the air; it is then insoluble not\r\nonly in water but in the most active solvents, and even _heat_ has no\r\neffect upon it to melt or soften it: indeed, without these qualities\r\nit would be of no use to us[637]. As soon as it leaves the spinneret\r\nit becomes the thread we call silk, which being drawn through _two_\r\norifices is necessarily _double_ through its whole length. This\r\nthread varies considerably in colour and texture, as has been before\r\nstated[638], and sometimes resembles cotton or wool rather than silk.\r\nIn spiders it is of a much softer and more tender texture than that of\r\nother spinning insects; and Mr. Murray seems to have proved that it is\r\nimbued, in the case of the gossamer, with negative electricity: in the\r\n_sericterium_ the fluid that produces it is sometimes white or grey,\r\nand at others yellow[639]. A remarkable gnat (_Ceroplatus tipuloides_),\r\nliving on an agaric, carpets its station of repose and its paths with\r\nsomething between silk and varnish, which it spins, not in a _thread_,\r\nbut in a _broad_ riband[640].\r\n\r\nii. _Saliva._ Many insects have the power of discharging from their\r\nmouth a fluid which seems in some degree analogous to the _saliva_ of\r\nlarger animals. Thus many, as _Lepidoptera_, _Hemiptera_, _Diptera_,\r\n&c., can dilute their food, and render it fitter for deglutition. I\r\nhave seen a common fly when not employed in eating, emit a globule\r\nof fluid as big as a grain of mustard-seed from its proboscis, and\r\nretract it again. On a former occasion I observed to you that many\r\npredaceous, carnivorous, and some herbivorous beetles, when alarmed\r\nemit a drop of coloured acrid fluid from the mouth[641]. That this\r\nis not secreted in any of the ordinary salival vessels is evident\r\nfrom Ramdohr's dissections of those beetles[642], who, had there\r\nbeen such an organ, would doubtless have discovered it: but as the\r\nstomach of all of them is distinguished by those minute _cœca_ or\r\nblind vessels, which he denominates shags (_zotten_)[643], perhaps\r\nthese may be the secretors of this fluid, probably analogous to the\r\ngastric juice[644]; in which case its _primary_ office would be the\r\n_digestion_ of the food. We are not however warranted in considering\r\n_every_ fluid effused from the mouth as saliva. The glutinous\r\nmaterial with which wasps cement the woody fibres for their paper\r\nedifices[645]; that with which some sand-wasps moisten the sand\r\nwhich they scrape away, of which they form the singular tubes that\r\nlead to their nests[646]; and that with which the aphidivorous larvæ\r\nfix themselves previously to their becoming pupæ[647],--may be a\r\nsecretion distinct from saliva; possibly intermediate between it and\r\ngum or the matter of silk, and secreted by peculiar organs. In the\r\nwasp, however, Ramdohr discovered nothing of the kind[648]; and in\r\n_Syrphus_, as before observed, the saliva-secretors are very peculiar\r\nin their structure, as if appropriated to the secretion of a peculiar\r\nfluid[649]. Something similar has been observed by Reaumur with\r\nregard to the larva of _Crioceris merdigera_, which forms its cocoon\r\nwith a kind of froth produced from the mouth[650].\r\n\r\niii. _Varnish_ or _Gum_. The eggs of various insects, when they leave\r\nthe oviduct, are covered with a kind of varnish or gum by which they\r\nadhere to the substances that the young larvæ are to feed upon, or\r\nare placed in a proper position for their hatching in an appropriate\r\nstation. Several instances of this have been already mentioned[651];\r\nI shall therefore not enlarge further upon the subject. With\r\nregard to the secretion itself, little has been recorded except\r\nits _colour_, which has been before noticed. Some _Lepidoptera_\r\nalso as we learn from Reaumur and Bonnet[652], use a varnish in the\r\nconstruction of their cocoons.\r\n\r\niv. _Jelly_ or _Gluten_. This secretion is particularly conspicuous\r\nin the _Trichoptera_ and some _Diptera_, serving as a bed or _nidus_\r\nfor those eggs that are committed to the water,--upon which I have\r\nnothing to add to what has been before said[653]. Under this head\r\nalso may be noticed the fluid, secreted in peculiar vesicles, that\r\nlubricates the oviduct and the passages of the sexual organs[654].\r\n\r\nv. _Oils._ Oily substances are sometimes produced by insects. The\r\ncommon oil-beetle (_Meloe Proscarabæus_) when touched sends forth\r\na drop of this kind of fluid, of an orange colour, from each joint\r\nof its legs[655]: something similar I have observed in _Coccinella\r\nbipunctata_: Ray mentions a locust taken in Spain which emits a\r\nyellow oleaginous fluid from between the claws of its fore legs[656];\r\nbut the precise nature of these substances has not been ascertained,\r\nnor whether they are secreted by peculiar organs.\r\n\r\nvi. _Milk._ A milky fluid is produced by the larva of _Chrysomela\r\nPopuli_. Willughby observed a similar effusion from pores in the\r\nupper surface of the body of _Acilius sulcatus_; and other insects\r\nemit it from other parts of their body[657].\r\n\r\nvii. _Honey._ It is certain that honey is not an _animal_ secretion;\r\nyet the saccharine matter collected from the nectaries of flowers,\r\nfrom which it is derived, seems to undergo some _alteration_ in the\r\nstomach; for the consistence of honey is greater than that of any\r\nvegetable nectar, and its taste does not vary greatly, while that of\r\nthe nectar in different plants is probably not the same. Reaumur also\r\nhas observed, that each honey-cell in a bee-hive is always covered\r\nby a cream-like layer of a thicker consistence than the rest, which\r\napparently serves to prevent the more liquid honey, which from time to\r\ntime is introduced under it, from running out[658]. Now if honey were\r\nthe unaltered nectar of plants, it is difficult to conceive how this\r\ncream could be collected in proper proportions. The last-mentioned\r\nnaturalist likewise ascertained, that if bees, in a season in which\r\nthe fields afford a scarcity of food, be supplied with _sugar_, they\r\nwill from this substance fill their cells with _honey_ which differs\r\nin no respect from the common sort, except that its flavour is a\r\nlittle heightened[659]:--a similar argument may be deduced from the\r\ncircumstance of the bees imbibing the juices of _fruits_ of various\r\nkinds as they are well known to do[660]. It seems therefore evident\r\nthat the honey collected by bees undergoes some modification in their\r\nhoney-stomach before it is regurgitated into the cells, and therefore\r\nmay be regarded in some degree as a peculiar secretion.\r\n\r\nHuber says that he has ascertained by a great number of observations\r\nthat electricity is singularly favourable to the secretion of the\r\nsubstance of which honey is formed by flowers; the bees never collect\r\nit in greater abundance, nor is the formation of wax ever more\r\nactive, than when the wind is in the south, the air humid and warm,\r\nand a storm gathering[661].\r\n\r\nviii. _Wax_ generally transpires through the pores of the skin of\r\nthose insects that produce it, either partially or generally, and it\r\nis secreted from honey or other saccharine substances taken into the\r\nstomach. In the hive-bee, as has been before stated, it is produced\r\n_partially_[662], but in many other insects it is a _general_\r\ntransudation of the body. This is particularly the case with a large\r\nnumber of the _Homopterous Hemiptera_; and those flocoons that look\r\nlike cotton, and cover the body of several _Chermes_ and _Aphides_,\r\nif closely examined will be found of the nature of _wax_: this I have\r\nparticularly noticed with respect to _Chermes Fagi_, in which the\r\ncotton-like flocoons are often so long as to cause the insect to look\r\nlike a feather, and a leaf covered by them exhibits a very singular\r\nappearance, as if clothed with the fine down of a swan[663].\r\nProbably the white powder or threads that appear to transpire through\r\nthe skin of many other insects is of a waxy nature. In the larva of a\r\nbeetle described by Reaumur, the flocoons are so arranged as to give\r\nthe animal some resemblance to a hedgehog, and when rubbed off they\r\nare reproduced in twelve hours[664]. Gyllenhal, speaking of _Peltis\r\nlimbata_, observes, that when alive it is covered with a white powder\r\nresembling mould, which if rubbed off returns again as long as the\r\nanimal lives[665].\r\n\r\nIt will not be improper to include under this head what further\r\naccount I have to give of _Lac_, which though regarded as a _resin_,\r\nsince _Cocci_ sometimes certainly produce _wax_[666], probably has\r\nsome analogy with the latter substance. When the females of this\r\n_Coccus_ (_C. Lacca_) have fixed themselves to a part of the branch\r\nof the trees on which they feed (_Ficus religiosa_ and _indica_,\r\n_Butea frondosa_, and _Rhamnus Jujuba_[667]), a pellucid and\r\nglutinous substance begins to exude from the margins of the body, and\r\nin the end covers the whole insect with a cell of this substance,\r\nwhich when hardened by exposure to the air becomes lac. So numerous\r\nare these insects, and so closely crowded together, that they often\r\nentirely cover a branch; and the groups take different shapes, as\r\nsquares, hexagons, &c., according to the space left round the insect\r\nwhich first began to form its cell. Under these cells the females\r\ndeposit their eggs, which after a certain period are hatched, and\r\nthe young ones eat their way out. Though indisputably an _animal_\r\nsecretion, many of the properties of lac are not very different from\r\nthose of the juices of the trees on which the animal feeds, and which\r\ntherefore would seem to undergo but little alteration.\r\n\r\nWax seems also to form a constituent part of some insects which are\r\nnot found to secrete it. The yellow substance deposited in vessels\r\ncontaining _spiders_ in alcohol is said to be a true _wax_, and may\r\nbe obtained from these animals by gently heating them[668].\r\n\r\nix. _Poisons_ and _Acids_. The _bite_ as well as the _sting_ of many\r\ninsects is followed by inflamed tumours, so that the _sialisteria_ of\r\nsome _bugs_, _Diptera_, _Aptera_ and _spiders_, may be regarded as\r\nproducing a poisonous fluid; but we know nothing of the real nature\r\nof it, nor of that of other venomous insects, except the _ant_--whose\r\ncelebrated _acid_ may be considered under the present head,--the\r\n_bee_, the _wasp_, and the _scorpion_.\r\n\r\nContrary to the once received doctrine that no _acid_ was to be found\r\nin any animal, except as the effect of disease in the alimentary canal,\r\nmany insects secrete peculiar and powerful ones. I have on a former\r\noccasion related an instance in which an acid of this description,\r\nsecreted in its _sialisteria_, is employed by a moth to soften its\r\ncocoon[669]; and Lister mentions a species of _Iulus_ which produced\r\none resembling that of ants[670]; but this last is the most powerful\r\nof all. The fact that blue flowers when thrown into an ant-hill become\r\ntinged with red has been long known; but Mr. Fisher of Sheffield, about\r\n1670, seems to have been the first who ascertained that this effect is\r\ncaused by an _acid_ with which ants abound, and which may be obtained\r\nfrom them by distillation or infusion in water[671]. Margraff and\r\nother chemists confirmed this discovery[672]; and concluding that this\r\nacid was of a peculiar kind, they gave it the name of the _Formic\r\nacid_. This name, however, is now exploded; the subsequent experiments\r\nof Deyeux, Fourcroy and Vauquelin having ascertained that the acid\r\nof ants is not of a distinct kind, but a mixture of the _Acetic_ and\r\n_Malic_[673]. These acids are in such considerable quantities, and so\r\nconcentrated in these animals, that, when a number of _Formica rufa_\r\nare bruised in a mortar, the vapour is so sharp that it is scarcely\r\npossible to endure it at a short distance. It also transpires from\r\nthem, for they leave traces of it on the bodies which they traverse:\r\nand hence, according to the experiments of Mr. Coleridge, the vulgar\r\nnotion that ants cannot pass over a line of chalk is correct; the\r\neffervescence produced by the contact of the acid and alkaline\r\nbeing so considerable, as in some degree to burn their legs[674].\r\nThe circumstance of much of the food of ants being of a saccharine\r\nnature may account for this copious secretion of acid, the use of\r\nwhich is probably to defend themselves and their habitations from the\r\nattack and intrusion of their enemies: if a frog be put into a nest\r\nof _Formica rufa_ that has been deranged, it will be suffocated in\r\nfive minutes[675]. That which they _ejaculate_ from their _anus_ when\r\nattacked, as formerly stated[676], must be secreted in an _ioterium_;\r\nbut their very _blood_ seems of an acid nature. It is very probable,\r\nas Dr. Thomson has observed[677], that acids may be obtained from many\r\nother insects, and that they are various modifications of the acetic.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance that water is absorbed by _greasy_ moths,\r\nthat crystals of a salt are occasionally found adhering to them,\r\nthat they change blue litmus paper _red_,--it has been inferred that\r\ntheir supposed _oiliness_ is in fact an _acid_ or acid salt, having\r\nthe property of attracting moisture from the air, the infected moths\r\nbeing in fact not greasy, but _wet_; hence the application of chalk\r\nand clay, usually recommended in this case, can have only a temporary\r\nand superficial effect. The only effectual remedy, is steeping the\r\nbody in spirits of wine till all the acid is extracted[678]. This\r\nacid is probably the same as Chaussier obtained from silkworms, since\r\ncalled _Bombic Acid_[679].\r\n\r\nThe _poison_ of _bees_ and _wasps_, as to its chemical qualities, is\r\na transparent fluid, at first sweet to the taste, but immediately\r\nafterwards hot and acrid like the milky juice of the _spurge_[680];\r\nsoluble in water, but not in alcohol; and separable from the former in\r\nthe state of white powder, when the latter is added giving a slight\r\n_red_ tinge to paper stained with vegetable blue, and when dry and\r\nchewed appearing tenacious, gummy and elastic. This last property,\r\nas well as solubility in water and not in alcohol, is common also to\r\nthe poison of the _viper_, which however differs in being tasteless,\r\nand not affecting vegetable blues. From hence Fontana concludes that\r\nthis fluid is united with an _acid_, but in a very small proportion,\r\nand not with an _alkali_[681]. The venom of bees is extremely active;\r\na grain in weight, it is conjectured, would kill a pigeon in a\r\nfew seconds[682]. It is remarkable, however, that while in some\r\nconstitutions the sting of a single bee or wasp is sufficient sometimes\r\nto induce alarming symptoms, in others numerous punctures will produce\r\nlittle or no pain or inflammation. That this fluid, and not the\r\npuncture of the sting, is the sole cause of the inflammation that\r\nusually follows the wound inflicted by one of these animals, is proved\r\nby the facts, that if it be introduced into one made by a needle, the\r\nsame effect ensues, and that when the whole contents of the poison-bag\r\nhave been exhausted by the insect's stinging three or four times in\r\nsuccession, its weapon then becomes harmless[683].\r\n\r\nThe venom of _scorpions_, though much more potent, probably resembles\r\nthat of bees, &c., in many of its chemical qualities: it issues from\r\ntwo pores in the sting before described[684], where, when the animal\r\nis irritated, it accumulates under the form of two little drops of\r\na whitish colour: spread upon paper this fluid produces a spot like\r\nwhat would be caused by oil or grease, and this part of the paper\r\nbecomes by desiccation firmer and transparent[685].\r\n\r\nx. _Odorous fluids_ and _Vapours_[686]. The powerful scents which\r\ndifferent insects emit are extremely numerous, much more so indeed\r\nthan the generality of Entomologists have been aware, for there is\r\nscarcely a scent odious or agreeable that may not be met with in the\r\ninsect world. This you will be convinced of, by following a practice\r\nwhich I would recommend to you--that of smelling the insects you\r\ntake. Some of these scents are peculiar to particular parts or\r\norgans, and some are exhaled generally by the whole body; some are\r\nemitted by a fluid secretion, and others are gaseous effluvia. On a\r\nformer occasion I gave you a rather full account of these scents and\r\ntheir organs[687]; I shall relate here only what I there omitted. To\r\nbegin with _sweet_ odours. Many beetles emit an agreeable scent. The\r\nrose-scented Capricorn or musk-beetle (_Cerambyx moschatus_) has long\r\nbeen noted for the delicious scent of roses which it exhales; this is\r\nso powerful as to fill a whole apartment, and the insect retains it\r\nlong after its death. Captain Hancock also informed me that another\r\nspecies of the same genus, _C. sericeus_, has in a high degree a\r\nscent resembling that of the cedar[688] on which they feed. Though\r\nmost of the micropterous tribes (_Brachyptera_) have a _fetid_ smell,\r\nyet there are some exceptions to this amongst them. One species\r\n(_Philonthus suaveolens_ K. MS.) related to _P. micans_, which I once\r\ntook, smelt precisely like a fine high-scented ripe pear; another,\r\n_Oxytelus morsitans_, like the water-lily; a third, _O. rugosus_,\r\nlike water-cresses; and lastly, a fourth (_P. fuscipes_) like\r\nsaffron[689]: _Trichius Eremita_, one of the Petalocerous beetles,\r\nis stated to have the scent of Russia leather; _Geotrupes vernalis_,\r\nin spite of its stercorarious food, of lavender-water[690]. Mr.\r\nSheppard has observed that _Dytiscus marginalis_ when recently taken\r\nsmells not unlike liquorice: Bonnet mentions a caterpillar that had\r\nthe scent of new hay. A little gall-fly (_Cynips Quercus Ramuli_)\r\nhas the remarkable odour of Fraxinella: the larva of another species\r\nof this genus (_C. Rosæ_) has an odour which seemed to Reaumur\r\nas attractive to cats as that of _Nepeta cataria_ or _Teucrium\r\nMarum_[691]: some _Phalangia_ smell like walnut leaves[692]; and the\r\nvarious species of the genus _Prosopis_ (_Melitta_ * b. K.) have a\r\nvery agreeable scent of _Dracocephalum moldavicum_[692].\r\n\r\nWe next come to _fetid_ odours. These in numerous cases are known\r\nto be secreted and emitted by appropriate vessels and organs; they\r\nare often exhaled from a fluid secretion, of which, in the letter\r\nlately referred to, I gave you almost all the known instances. Savi,\r\nin his history of _Iulus fœtidissimus_, informs us that it emits a\r\nyellow fetid fluid from its supposed spiracles, which if applied in\r\nsufficient quantity imparts a red colour to the skin, to be removed\r\nneither by friction nor washing, but only disappearing by time; when\r\nremoved from the black vesicles in which it is stored, it shoots into\r\nvery transparent octahedral crystals[693].\r\n\r\nI have before mentioned the coloured fluid which some insects emit\r\nwhen they are disclosed from the pupa, and that it probably exhales\r\nsome powerful odour which attracts the males[694].\r\n\r\nThe great _Hydrophilus_, in its larva state, when first taken into\r\nthe hand remains without motion; in a minute afterwards it renders\r\nitself so flaccid as to appear like a cast skin. Taken by the tail it\r\ncontracts itself considerably, it then agitates itself briskly, and\r\nejaculates with a slight noise a fetid and blackish fluid[695].\r\n\r\nIn other cases these odours are produced by _gaseous vapours_.\r\nThat of the Bombardiers (_Brachinus_) is the most celebrated and\r\nremarkable. It is whitish, of a powerful and stimulating odour, very\r\nlike that exhaled by nitrous acid. It is caustic, producing upon the\r\nskin the sensation of burning, and forming instantly upon it red\r\nspots which soon turn brown, and which, in spite of frequent lotions,\r\nremain several days. It turns blue paper red[696]. That amiable,\r\nintelligent, and unfortunate traveller Mr. Ritchie,--whose premature\r\ndeath, when attempting to penetrate to the interior of Africa, all\r\nlovers of Natural History so deeply lamented, and whose ardour in the\r\npursuit of that science I had an opportunity of witnessing, when,\r\nin company with him, Messrs. Savigny, Du Fresne, and W. S. MacLeay\r\nin 1817, I visited the forest of Fontainebleau,--in a letter to the\r\nlast-mentioned gentleman[697], relates that his companion M. Dupont,\r\nnear Tripoli took a nest consisting of more than a thousand of a\r\nspecies of this genus. \"I am making a few experiments,\" says he, \"on\r\nthe substance which they emit when they crepitate, but do not know\r\nwhether I can collect enough to arrive at any conclusion. It made\r\nDupont's fingers entirely black when he took them. It is neither\r\nalkaline nor acid, and it is soluble in water and in alcohol.\" From\r\nthis we may conjecture that it formed crystals.\r\n\r\nxi. _Phosphorus._ On this remarkable secretion I have so fully\r\nenlarged on a former occasion[698], that here I shall merely add a\r\nfew observations which Mr. Murray obligingly communicated to me. He\r\nremarks that in a box in which glow-worms were kept--five luminous\r\nspecks were found secreted by the animal, which seemed to glow and\r\nwere of a different tinge of light. One put into olive oil at eleven\r\nP. M. continued to yield a steady and uninterrupted light until five\r\no'clock the following morning, and then seemed, like the stars, to be\r\nonly absorbed by superior effulgence. The luminous spherical matter\r\nof the glow-worm is evidently enveloped in a sac or capsule perfectly\r\ndiaphanous, which when ruptured discloses it in a liquid form, of the\r\nconsistency of cream. M. Macaire, he observes, in the _Bibliothèque\r\nUniverselle_, draws the following conclusions from experiments made\r\non the luminous matter of this animal;--that a _certain_ degree of\r\nheat is necessary to their voluntary phosphorescence--that it is\r\nexcited by a degree of heat superior to the first, and inevitably\r\ndestroyed by a higher--that bodies which coagulate albumen take\r\naway the power--that phosphorescence cannot take place but in a gas\r\ncontaining no oxygen--that it is not excited by common electricity,\r\nbut is so by the Voltaic pile--and lastly, that the matter is chiefly\r\ncomposed of _albumen_.\r\n\r\nxii. _Fat._ There is one product found in the body of insects most\r\ncopiously in their larva state, but more or less also in the imago,\r\nwhich may be called their _fat_. In the former it is a many-lobed mass,\r\noccupying the whole of the interior, except the space that is required\r\nfor the muscles and the internal organs, which it wraps round and\r\nprotects. It is contained in floating membranes, very numerous, which\r\nfill all the interstices, and assume the appearance sometimes of small\r\nglobules, and sometimes of a thickish mucilage, which easily melts and\r\ninflames; in colour it is most commonly white, but sometimes yellow\r\nor green. It is imagined to be a kind of _epiploon_ or _caul_, and is\r\naccumulated in the _larva_ as a store of nutriment for the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the organs of the perfect insect while in the _pupa_\r\nstate[699]. The blood in which the different organs float that is\r\nnot required for their nutriment, is supposed to be expended in the\r\nformation of this substance. Marcel de Serres is of opinion that it\r\nis secreted from the chyle by passing through the pores of the dorsal\r\nvessel, formerly called the heart of insects[700].\r\n\r\nUnder this head I may mention what little is known with regard to the\r\n_perspiration_ of these animals[701]. That a considerable quantity of\r\nfluid passes off from them when in the pupa state, is sufficiently\r\nproved by the loss of weight which they undergo, and by the experiments\r\nof Reaumur, who collected the fluid in closed glass tubes; and that in\r\ntheir perfect state they are constantly passing off perspirable matter\r\nby the pores of their skin or crust, is not only rendered probable\r\nby the succulent nature of their food and the absence of any urinary\r\ndischarge, but is proved by what takes place in a swarm of bees. These\r\ninsects, when crowded together in hot weather in a large mass, become\r\nheated to such a degree, and perspire so copiously, that those near\r\nthe bottom are quite drenched with the moisture it produces, which so\r\nrelaxes their wings that they are unable to fly[702].\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[588] Cuv. _Anat.

I shall not\r\nnow, however, enter at large upon this subject, but confine myself\r\nprincipally to the consideration of those organs in the female which\r\nare appropriated to the formation, fecundation, maturation, exclusion\r\nand deposition of their eggs, and other circumstances relating\r\nto that subject. The organs connected with this function are the\r\n_Sperm-reservoir_; the _Oviduct_; the _Ovaries_; and the _Ovipositor_.\r\n\r\nI. The Sperm-reservoir (_Spermatheca_) is an organ connecting the\r\nvagina with the oviduct, which, according to Herold, receives the\r\nmale sperm as into a reservoir[703], and fecundates the eggs in\r\ntheir transit through that passage. This vessel, which consists of\r\na double tunic, in the cabbage-butterfly terminates the vagina,\r\nand is connected with the oviduct by a lateral undulating tube: in\r\nshape it is a rather irregular oblong, and is surmounted by a small\r\norbicular vesicle, connected by a short tubular footstalk with the\r\nmain reservoir[704]. A similar organ was discovered by Malpighi\r\nin the imago of the silkworm, who denominates it the _uterus_; to\r\nwhich indeed it seems analogous, and which he also regards as a\r\nreservoir for the sperm for the gradual fecundation of the eggs[705].\r\nBut in that fly the organ is of a rather different shape, and the\r\ninterior vessel terminates in several spherical vesicles[706].\r\nJohn Hunter by the most decisive experiments, such as covering the\r\neggs of the unimpregnated moth, after exclusion, with the liquor\r\ntaken from the spermatheca in those which had been impregnated,\r\nand rendering them fertile, he demonstrated that this organ was a\r\nreservoir for the spermatic fluid, to impregnate the eggs as they\r\nwere ready for exclusion, and that coition and impregnation were\r\nnot simultaneous[707]. It is not improbable that in all insects\r\nwhose eggs are gradually laid, this provision for their gradual\r\nfecundation, if carefully sought for, might be detected[708].\r\nRifferschweils is of opinion, that in these cases the eggs are\r\nfertilized in their transit through the oviduct by sperm adhering\r\nto the folds of the _cloacæ_[709]: but this opinion seems less\r\nanalogous to what takes place in other cases, with regard to the due\r\npreparation of the eggs for a safe and effectual transit[710].\r\n\r\nII. The Oviduct (_Oviductus_) is the canal, always separate from the\r\nvagina, which receives the eggs from the ovary, transmitting them,\r\noften by a peculiar and complex instrument in which it terminates,\r\nto their proper station. This canal sometimes opens into the anal\r\npassage or _cloaca_, and at others, as in the cabbage-butterfly[711],\r\nis distinct, and lies between the sexual organ and the anus. In the\r\n_Arachnida_ there are _two_ oviducts[712].\r\n\r\nIII. The Ovaries (_Ovaria_) in insects are the viscera in which the\r\neggs are generated and grow till they arrive at maturity, when they\r\npass through the oviduct, and are extruded or deposited in their\r\nappropriate station. They vary considerably in their structure. In\r\nall however, except the _Iulidæ_, in which there is only a _single_\r\novary[713], the oviduct at its upper or inner extremity terminates in\r\n_two_ branches, usually further subdivided into a number of smaller\r\nconical ones, which several ramifications constitute the _ovaries_,\r\nor egg-tubes as they are sometimes called: these tubes generally\r\nconsist of a single membrane, and are joined to the oviduct by\r\nmembranous rugose _cloacæ_[714]: in the _Phalangia_, however,\r\nthere are _two_ tunics; the outer one of a cellular substance, and\r\nthe inner one consisting of spiral fibres like _tracheæ_--a kind\r\nof structure which renders them capable of great extension[715].\r\nRifferschweils considers the ovaries as formed upon _two_ primary\r\ntypes.--_First_, _flagelliform_ ovaries, consisting of conical\r\ntubes equal in length, and inserted at the same place at the end\r\nof the primary branches as in the _Lepidoptera_, the Bee, &c.\r\n_Secondly_, _racemose_ ovaries, consisting of short conical tubes,\r\nso proceeding from the primary branches as to render the ovary\r\nracemose or pinnated, as in certain _Neuroptera_, _Coleoptera_, and\r\n_Diptera_[716]: but perhaps their structure will be better understood\r\nif they are divided into _agglomerate_ ovaries and _branching_\r\novaries: in the _first_ the egg-tubes form _two_ bundles, in\r\nwhich the branches are not discernible, as in the _Ephemera_, the\r\nchamæleon-fly, and spiders[717]: and in the _second_ the branches are\r\ndistinct, as in the _Lepidoptera_ and the majority of insects.\r\n\r\nThe number of branches varies in different genera and species. In\r\n_Echinomyia grossa_, a large fly, there are only the _two_ primary\r\nbranches[718]; in the common dung-beetle (_Geotrupes stercorarius_)\r\nthese appear divided at their apex into fingers[719]: in _Scolia_, a\r\nHymenopterous genus, and the butterfly of the nettle, there are _three_\r\nsecondary branches on each side[720]: in many other _Lepidoptera_ and\r\nthe humble-bee there are _four_[721]; in the common louse there are\r\n_five_[722]; in the rhinoceros-beetle and the cockchafer, _six_[723];\r\nin the wasp, _seven_[724]; _eight_ in the cockroach[725]; _twelve_\r\nin the _Carabi_ and the mealworm-beetle[726]; _thirty_ in the large\r\ngreen grasshopper (_Acrida viridissima_[727]); _thirty-two_ in the\r\ncheese-maggot-fly[728]; and in the hive-bee more than _a hundred and\r\nfifty_[729].\r\n\r\nThe number of _eggs_ also contained in the ovaries varies. In\r\n_Echinomyia grossa_ there is only _one_ egg in each, and only\r\n_two_ at once in the matrix[730]: in another fly produced by\r\nthe cheese-maggot there are _four_[731]; in the louse there are\r\n_five_; in the cockchafer _six_[732]; in the hive-bee _sixteen_\r\nor _seventeen_ are visible at the same time[733]; and in the\r\nsilkworm-moth _sixty_ or _seventy_[734]. Besides the eggs, the\r\ntubes contain a pellucid mucus, and at their upper extremity the\r\neggs are lost in a granular mucous mass, in which, however, they\r\nmay still be discovered with a microscope[735]. With regard to the\r\ntermination of the ovaries or egg-tubes internally,--in those that\r\nhave agglomerated ones it is not to be traced, the whole appearing\r\nlike an oblong obtuse or acute body[736]: but in the branching ones\r\nit is more easily traced; at first they converge in most cases\r\nto a point; this is seen to advantage in the caterpillar of some\r\nbutterflies, when near assuming the pupa, in which they are readily\r\ndiscovered, and represent with great truth and elegance the bud of\r\nsome blossom[737]; but in time they diverge, and sometimes become\r\nconvoluted[738]; they generally terminate in a slender simple\r\nfilament, but in the louse in a fork[739]; they are sometimes\r\nextremely long, as in the wasp and _Lepidoptera_[740]; in the\r\nhive-bee they appear to be shorter[741].\r\n\r\nIV. We are next to consider the _Ovipositor_, or instrument by which\r\nnumerous insects are enabled to introduce their eggs into their\r\nappropriate situations, and where the new-born larva may immediately\r\nmeet with its destined food. As this instrument is one of the most\r\nstriking peculiarities with which the wisdom of the CREATOR has\r\ngifted these little animals, and in many cases is extremely curious\r\nand wonderful, both in its structure and modes of operation--though\r\non a former occasion I gave you a brief account of several kinds of\r\nthem[742], I shall now enter more at large into the subject, and\r\ndescribe these often complex machines, as they are exhibited in most\r\nof the different Orders of insects.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _Coleoptera_ Order, there are doubtless numerous\r\nvariations in the structure of this organ; but very few have been\r\nnoticed, and those chiefly belong to insects whose grubs feed on\r\ntimber. In these it is usually retractile one part within another,\r\nlike the pieces of a telescope: in _Buprestis_ it consists of three\r\nlong and sharp _laminæ_, the two lateral ones forming a sheath to\r\nthe intermediate one, which probably conveys the eggs[743]: in\r\n_Elater_ it is a cylindrical organ, terminating in a pair of conical\r\njoints, which seem to form a forceps, and including a tube probably\r\nconveying the egg to the forceps, which perhaps introduces it[744].\r\nThe Ovipositor of _Prionus coriarius_ differs from that of _Callidium\r\nviolaceum_, and many Capricorns before described[745]: it consists\r\nmerely of a long bivalve piece ending in a kind of forceps, and\r\nhollowed above into a channel for the passage of the eggs[746].\r\n\r\nIn the _Orthoptera_ the instrument of oviposition is more simple;\r\nin _Locusta_ consisting merely of four robust three-sided pieces,\r\ntwo above and two below, the former pair at the end curving upwards\r\nand the latter downwards[747], these pieces seem calculated when\r\nthey have entered the earth to enlarge the burrow, and the animal\r\nappears able to separate them very widely from each other[748].\r\nThe ovipositor of _Acrida viridissima_, which like that of many\r\nHymenopterous insects forms a kind of appendage or tail to the body,\r\nhas been described both by De Geer and Latreille as consisting of\r\n_two_ valves only[749]; but in reality it consists of _six_, two\r\nupper and four lower, as you may ascertain by means of a pin or\r\nthe point of a penknife, which will readily separate them. This is\r\nconfirmed by a figure of Stoll's of a species which seems to connect\r\n_Conocephalus_ with _Gryllus_. In this the ovipositor is considerably\r\nlonger than the body of the animal, and is composed of _six_ distinct\r\npieces; viz. _two_ external ones stouter than the rest, and within\r\nthese _four_ others finer than a hair and convolute at the apex[750].\r\nThere is a considerable variety in the shape of the ovipositors of\r\nthe _Acridæ_ and the cognate genera:--thus in _A. viridissima_\r\nthis organ is straight, in _A. verrucivora_ bent like a sabre, and\r\nin _Pterophylla citrifolia_ and some others, the whole machine is\r\nshort and boat-shaped; in _Scaphura Vigorsii_ it is also rough with\r\nsharp little tubercles[751]. I had an opportunity of observing,\r\nwith respect to the first of these insects, that in boring, as is\r\nthe case with the _Cicadæ_ and saw-flies, the motion of the valves\r\nwas alternately backwards and forwards. It appeared also to me that\r\nthe two outer pieces of each of the apparent valves were fixed in a\r\ngroove in the margin of the intermediate one. I saw this clearly with\r\nrespect to the _upper_ pieces, and it is most probable that the lower\r\nare similarly circumstanced. In the cricket tribe (_Gryllus_) the\r\novipositor is as long as the abdomen, very slender, terminating in a\r\nknob[752]. It is _apparently_ bivalve like that of _Acrida_, but I\r\nbelieve is resolvable into the same number of pieces.\r\n\r\nIn the _Homopterous Hemiptera_ there seems to be more than one type\r\non which the ovipositor is constructed. In an insect very common with\r\nus, the froth froghopper (_Cercopis spumaria_), some approach is made\r\nto the ovipositors last described, at least the number of pieces is\r\nthe same--for it has a pair of external valves forming a sheath, which\r\nincludes three sharp _laminæ_ resembling the blades of a lancet, the\r\nmiddle one of which can be separated into two; this instrument De Geer\r\nhad reason to think was scored transversely like a file[753]. In the\r\ninsects of this Order so noted for their song[754] (_Cicada_), there\r\nare only _five_ pieces; namely, two valves forming the sheath, two\r\naugers or borers, and an intermediate piece upon which they slide,\r\neach being furnished with an internal groove for that purpose, and the\r\nmiddle piece with a ridge to fit; a contrivance of Divine Wisdom, to\r\nprevent their dislocation when employed in boring; the augers terminate\r\nin a knob which is externally toothed[755]. This structure approaches\r\nthat of the _Hymenoptera_, especially the saw-flies. With regard to the\r\n_Heteropterous_ section of this Order--as they usually do not introduce\r\ntheir eggs _into_ any substance, they have no call for any remarkable\r\novipositor, and therefore are not so furnished. A remark which will\r\nalso apply to the _Lepidoptera_ Order.\r\n\r\nIn the _Libellulina_ amongst the _Neuroptera_, an organ of this kind\r\nis sometimes discoverable. In _Agrion_, Reaumur noticed a part which\r\nhe conjectured to be an _ovipositor_; it consists of four _laminæ_\r\nor lancets, the interior pair slender, the exterior wider, and all\r\nexternally serrated[756].\r\n\r\nThe insects of the _Hymenoptera_ Order have long been celebrated for\r\nthe organs we are describing, whether used as _saws_, _augers_, or\r\n_darts_. I formerly gave you a very _general_ account of the _saws_,--I\r\nshall now give you a very interesting one in _detail_ copied from an\r\nadmirable little essay of Professor Peck. \"This instrument,\" says\r\nhe, \"is a very curious object; and in order to describe it it will\r\nbe proper to compare it with the _tenon-saw_ used by cabinet-makers,\r\nwhich being made of a very thin plate of steel, is fitted with a back\r\nto prevent its bending. The back is a piece of iron, in which a narrow\r\nand deep groove is cut to receive the plate, which is fixed: the saw\r\nof the _Tenthredo_ is also furnished with a back, but the groove is\r\nin the plate, and receives a prominent ridge of the back, which is\r\nnot fixed, but permits the saw to slide forward and backward as it is\r\nthrown out or retracted. The saw of artificers is _single_, but that\r\nof the _Tenthredo_ is _double_, and consists of two distinct saws with\r\ntheir backs: the insect in using them, first throws out one, and while\r\nit is returning pushes forward the other; and this alternate motion is\r\ncontinued till the incision is effected, when the two saws receding\r\nfrom each other, conduct the egg between them into its place. In the\r\nartificial saw the teeth are alternately bent toward the sides, or\r\nout of the right line, in order that the fissure or kerf may be made\r\nsufficiently wide for the blade to move easily. To answer this purpose\r\nin some measure, in that of the _Tenthredo_ the teeth are a little\r\ntwisted, so as to stand obliquely with respect to the right line, and\r\ntheir point of course projects a little beyond the plane of the blade,\r\nwithout being laterally bent; and all those in each blade thus project\r\na little outwards: but the kerf is more effectually made, and a free\r\nrange procured for the saws, by small teeth placed on the outer side\r\nof each; so that while their vertical effect is that of a _saw_, their\r\nlateral effect is that of a _rasp_. In the artificial saw the teeth\r\nall point outward (_towards the end_) and are simple; but in the saw\r\nof the _Tenthredo_ they point inward, or toward the handle, and their\r\nouter edge is beset with smaller teeth which point outwards (_towards\r\nthe end_)[757].\" Valisnieri, Reaumur, and De Geer describe the groove\r\nas being in the back; but in Mr. Peck's insect, if there is no error in\r\nhis account, it is, as in the _Cicadæ_, in the saw itself[758]. In the\r\ngenus _Cimbex_, belonging to the same tribe, the saw differs in shape,\r\nbeing somewhat _sigmoidal_ or resembling the letter S, while in that\r\nof other saw-flies it is _cultriform_ with a concave edge: other minor\r\ndifferences distinguish them, which need not be particularized.\r\n\r\nA similar structure, with regard to the organ in question, obtains\r\nin the rest of the _Hymenoptera_, even those that use it as a weapon\r\nof offence; but the backs of the saws in them, composed of a single\r\npiece, become a sheath for the darts. The valves, however, vary. In\r\nmost of those with an exerted sting, as _Pimpla_, they are linear,\r\nexerted, and as long as the aculeus itself[759]. In _Proctotrupes_\r\nthey appear to be united so as to form a tube for the ovipositor,\r\nand are produced by a prolongation of the last abdominal segment.\r\nThe darts usually run in two grooves of the sheath, and at their\r\napex are retroserrulate[760]. In some cases the sheath itself is\r\nserrated[761]. The shanks of the darts are connected with the valves;\r\nso that when these open they are pushed out: sometimes on their outer\r\nside they have a triangular plate towards the base, which prevents\r\ntheir being pushed out too far[762].\r\n\r\nIn _Sirex_ and many ichneumons, in which the ovipositor is too long\r\nto be withdrawn within the abdomen, it remains always exerted; but\r\nin general it is retracted within that part when unemployed. In\r\nthe gall-fly (_Cynips_) this instrument is really as long as in\r\n_Pimpla_, &c.; but as it is infinitely more slender, when in repose\r\nit is rolled up spirally and concealed within the abdomen. It is\r\nthe puncture of this minute organ that produces the curious galls\r\nformerly described to you[763]. But the most anomalous ovipositor in\r\nthis Order appears to be that of _Chrysis_ (_C. ignita_, &c.), which\r\nis covered by several demi-tubes or scales enveloping and sliding\r\nover each other: when these scales are removed, the true ovipositor\r\nappears, which is of a structure similar to that of the rest of\r\nthe Order, but the valves are long and slender with their summit\r\ngenerally visible without the anus[764].\r\n\r\nThough the ovipositor of the majority of _Dipterous_ insects is a\r\ntube with retractile joints[765], in the crane-flies this organ is\r\ndifferent, and, like that of _Acrida_ above described, consists of what\r\nat first sight appear two valves, but each of which is formed of two\r\npieces, the upper ones sharp and longer, and the lower pair blunt. The\r\nupper pair forms the auger that bores a hole in the ground, and the\r\nlower conducts the eggs into it after it is bored[766].\r\n\r\nIn the _Aptera_ and _Arachnida_ in general there seems no remarkable\r\ninstrument of this kind; but Treviranus has described one in spiders\r\nfor extruding the eggs of a singular construction. It is an oval\r\nplate lying between the external genitals and spinning organs, and\r\nis composed of a number of small screw-shaped cartilages, connected\r\ntogether in the most wonderful manner. There are few organs, he\r\nobserves, in the animal kingdom which for their artificial mechanism\r\ncan be compared with this. Each cartilage inosculates very closely\r\nin the adjoining one, and all are besides bound together by a strong\r\nskin[767].\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the eggs of insects are _fecundated_ by the\r\nmale sperm is one of those mysteries of Nature that are not yet\r\nfully elucidated and understood. We can readily conceive that all\r\nthe eggs may be fertilized by a single intercourse in the case of\r\ninsects which, like the _Ephemeræ_ and _Trichoptera_, exclude the\r\nwhole mass at once; or like many moths and butterflies, in a very\r\nshort time afterwards; but the subject becomes much more difficult\r\nto explain when we advert to the female of the hive-bee, the whole\r\nnumber of whose eggs, deposited in _two years_, are, as Huber has\r\ndemonstrated, in like manner fertilized by a single act[768]:--if you\r\nbear in mind, however, what I have lately observed with regard to\r\nMalpighi's discovery of a sperm-reservoir in insects, you will more\r\nreadily comprehend how in this case a _gradual_ fecundation may take\r\nplace. The principal objection to this solution of the difficulty in\r\nthe case before us, is derived from the very small size of the organ\r\nsupposed to be destined for this purpose--it being scarcely bigger\r\nthan the head of a pin[769]: it seems therefore incredible that it\r\nshould retain any portion of an extraneous fluid at the end of twelve\r\nor eighteen months, and still more unlikely that the fluid should in\r\nthe interval have sufficed for the slightest moistening of not fewer\r\nthan 30,000 or 40,000 eggs. The only hypothesis that seems at all to\r\nsquare with this fact, is that of Dr. Haighton,--that impregnation\r\nis the result not of any actual contact of the sperm with the eggs,\r\nbut of some unknown sympathetic influence[770], or rather perhaps of\r\nsome penetrating effluvia or _aura seminalis_, which, though small in\r\nquantity, it may retain the power of emitting for a long period.\r\n\r\nCertain female moths, of the species of that family which, from\r\nthe remarkable cases or sacs the larvæ inhabit, the Germans call\r\n_sack--träger_, before noticed[771], have been supposed to have the\r\nfaculty of producing fertile eggs without any sexual intercourse;\r\nand various observers, after taking great pains, appeared to have\r\nsatisfactorily proved the fact; so that some doubted whether these\r\ninsects produced any males at all[772]. The enigma was at length\r\nexplained by the accurate Von Scheven. At first his experiments were\r\nattended with the same result as those of his predecessors; but upon\r\nmaking them more carefully, and separating what he conceived to be\r\nthe female from the male pupæ, he ascertained not only the existence\r\nof a _female_ in the species he examined (_Psyche vestita_), but that\r\nwhen thus secluded she laid _barren_ eggs; evidently proving that\r\nin the contrary instances above alluded to, an unperceived sexual\r\nintercourse must have taken place[773]. Though he thus ascertained that\r\nthese insects do not in this respect deviate from the general rule,\r\nhe remarked or confirmed several facts in their economy sufficiently\r\nanomalous and striking;--as that the female is not only without wings,\r\nbut with scarcely any feature of a _moth_, much more closely resembling\r\na _caterpillar_; and that in ordinary circumstances she never attempts\r\nto leave the pupa-case in which she has been disclosed, but that being\r\nthere impregnated by the male, she there also, apparently after the\r\nmanner of the female _Cocci_, deposits her eggs, which hatching produce\r\nyoung larvæ that make their way out of the case, and thus seem to\r\noriginate without maternal interference[774].\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable fact bearing upon this head, though as relating\r\nto a _viviparous_ insect it does not strictly belong to it, is the\r\nimpregnation of the female _Aphides_, or plant-lice, before alluded\r\nto[775]. If you take a young female _Aphis_ at the moment of its\r\nbirth, and rigorously seclude it from all intercourse with its kind,\r\nonly providing it with proper food, it will produce a brood of young\r\nones: and not only this; but if one of these be treated in the same\r\nway, a similar result will ensue, and so on, at least to the _fifth_\r\ngeneration!! to which period Bonnet, who first made an accurate\r\nseries of observations on this almost miraculous fact, successfully\r\ncarried his experiments, till the approach of winter and the want of\r\nproper food forced him to desist[776]; and Lyonet extended it still\r\nfurther[777]. It is now generally admitted as an incontestible fact,\r\nthat female _Aphides_ have the faculty of giving birth to young ones\r\nwithout having had any intercourse with the other sex. How are we to\r\nexplain this most extraordinary fact? Are we to suppose with Bonnet\r\nthat these insects are truly androgynous, as strictly uniting both\r\nsexes in one? This supposition, however, is completely overturned by\r\nthe circumstance, that there are actually _male_ as well as _female\r\nAphides_, and that these, as was first observed by Lyonet, are united\r\ntowards the close of the summer in the usual manner[778]. The most\r\nlikely supposition therefore is, that one conjunction of the sexes\r\nsuffices for the impregnation of all the females that in a succession\r\nof generations spring from that union. It is true that at the first\r\nview this supposition appears incredible, contradicting the general\r\nlaws and course of nature in the production of animals. But the case\r\nof the hive-bee, stated above, in which a single intercourse with the\r\nmale fertilizes all the eggs that are laid for the space of _two_\r\nyears, and in the case of a common spider mentioned by Audebert[779],\r\nfor _many_ years, shows that the sperm preserves its vivifying powers\r\nunimpaired for a long period, indeed a longer period than is requisite\r\nfor the impregnation of all the broods that a female Aphis can produce;\r\nand if immediate contact with the fluid be not necessary, who can say\r\nthat this is impossible? It is, however, one of those mysteries of the\r\nCREATOR that human intellect cannot fully penetrate. But this anomaly\r\nin nature is not wholly confined to the Aphides; since Jurine has\r\nascertained that the same thing takes place with _Daphnia pennata_ Müll\r\n(_Monoculus Pulex_ L.), one of Branchiopod _Crustacea_[780]. It is\r\nworth observing whether the female _Aphides_ in their natural state, I\r\nmean those of the summer or viviparous broods, have intercourse with\r\nthe male. I think I have noticed males amongst them; but they seem to\r\nbecome most numerous in the autumn, preparatory to the impregnation\r\nof the oviparous females. The object of this law of the CREATOR is\r\nprobably the more ready multiplication of the species[781].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the period of _gestation_, most insects begin to lay their eggs\r\nsoon after fecundation has taken place: but in some _Arachnida_, as the\r\nScorpion, which seems to be both oviparous and ovo-viviparous, nearly\r\na year intervenes, and the eggs increase to _four_ times the size\r\nwhich they had attained at that period, before they are extruded[782].\r\nThe time that is required to lay the whole they are to produce,\r\nvaries also in _insects_. In this respect they may be divided into\r\ntwo great classes:--those namely which deposit the whole at _once_,\r\nas _Ephemerina_, _Trichoptera_, &c., and those which deposit them in\r\n_succession_, occupying in this operation a longer or shorter period.\r\nMany in the _first_ class, as the _Trichoptera_ or caseworm-flies,\r\nenvelope their eggs in a gelatinous substance[783], which renders their\r\nextrusion in a mass more easy. Of the _second_ class, which includes\r\nby far the greater proportion of insects, some exclude the whole\r\nnumber in a very short period, others require two or three days or a\r\nweek, as the cockroach[784]; and others, as the queen-bee, not less\r\nthan two years. The eggs in the ovaries of the last vary infinitely in\r\nsize; those that have entered the oviduct have arrived at maturity,\r\nwhile the rest grow gradually smaller as they approach the capillary\r\nextremity of the tubes, where they become at length invisible to the\r\nhighest magnifier[785]. In many insects the eggs seem nearly to have\r\nreached their full growth previously to the exclusion of the female\r\nfrom the pupa; and this exclusion and the impregnation and laying of\r\nthe eggs rapidly succeed each other. One moth (_Hypogymna dispar_),\r\nwhich is remarkable for the number of eggs she contains, sometimes\r\ndeposits them, even before they are fecundated, in the pupa-case[786].\r\nBut in other cases the sexual union is not so immediate, and some\r\ntime, longer or shorter, is requisite for the due expansion of the\r\neggs; and the ovaries of the animal swell so much, as often to enlarge\r\nthe abdomen to an extraordinary bulk: this is seen in a very common\r\nbeetle (_Chrysomela Polygoni_) that feeds upon the knot-grass; but in\r\nno insect is it so striking as in the female of the white ants, whose\r\nwonderful increase of size after impregnation I have related to you on\r\na former occasion[787].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this subject with a few observations upon\r\n_ovo-viviparous insects_; _supposed neuters_, and _hybrids_, which,\r\nthough they do not fall in regularly under any of the foregoing\r\nheads, may very well have a place in this letter.\r\n\r\n1. It has already been observed that there are a few\r\n_ovo-viviparous_ insects[788], the young of which exist in the\r\novaries at first as eggs, but are hatched within the body of the\r\nmother, and come forth in the living form of a larva and sometimes\r\neven of a pupa. Of the first description are certain _Diptera_, the\r\n_Aphides_, and the _Scorpion_.\r\n\r\nReaumur has described two modes in which the larvæ of the first\r\nare arranged in the matrix of the mother. In some they are heaped\r\ntogether without much appearance of order, being placed merely\r\nparallel to each other[789]; but in others they are arranged in a\r\nkind of riband--the length of the little animals, which are also\r\nparallel, forming its thickness--rolled up like the mainspring of\r\na watch[790]. These larvæ in general are not divided into _two_\r\nmasses corresponding with the pair of ovaries in other insects,\r\nbut form only a single one[791]. You must not suppose that these\r\nlittle fetuses lie naked in the womb of the mother; each has its\r\nown envelope formed of the finest membrane, which, however, is not\r\nentirely divided from that of those adjoining to it, but appears to\r\nbe one tube, which becomes extremely slender between each individual,\r\nso as when drawn out to look like a chain[792]. Reaumur seems to\r\nhave thought that in these flies the larvæ were never confined in\r\nany other case or egg[793]; but De Geer sometimes found _eggs_ in\r\nthe body of _Sarcophaga carnaria_, though most generally larvæ, from\r\nwhich he conjectures that it is really _ovo-viviparous_, the eggs\r\nbeing hatched in the body of the mother[794]. As these flies are\r\nall carnivorous, and their office is to remove putrescent flesh,\r\nyou may see at one glance the object of PROVIDENCE in this law\r\nof nature--that no time may be lost, and the animal exercise its\r\nfunction as soon as it is disclosed from the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe _Aphides_, so fruitful in singular anomalies, are ovo-viviparous,\r\nas I have before hinted[795], at one period of the year, that is\r\nduring the summer, but strictly oviparous at its close. From the\r\nexperiments of De Geer, however, upon _Aphis Rosæ_, it would appear\r\nthat this faculty is not conferred upon the _same_ individuals, but\r\nonly upon those of _different_ generations of the same species; all\r\nthe generations being ovo-viviparous except the _last_, which is\r\noviparous[796]: nor does it appear, as has been sometimes imagined,\r\nthat it is common to the whole genus. De Geer observed a species in\r\nthe fir, which makes curious galls resembling a fir cone (_Aphis\r\nAbietis_), which appeared never to be ovo-viviparous[797].\r\n\r\nWith regard to _scorpions_, it does not seem clear that they are\r\n_always_ ovo-viviparous: M. Dufour twice found in the midst of the\r\neggs nearly mature, a young scorpion which appeared to him at large\r\nin the cavity of the abdomen; it was so large that it was difficult\r\nto comprehend how it could possibly be excluded from the animal,\r\nwithout an extraordinary operation[798]. The _pupiparous_ insects\r\n(_Hippobosca_, &c.) have been sufficiently noticed before[799].\r\n\r\n2. I have already in several of my former letters stated to you\r\nwhat the modern doctrine of physiologists is with respect to certain\r\nindividuals, usually forming the most numerous part of the community\r\nwith insects living in society, that were formerly supposed to be\r\n_neuters_, or as to their sex neither male nor female--that they\r\nare in almost every instance a kind of abortive females, fed with\r\na different and less stimulating food than that appropriated to\r\nthose whose ovaries are to be developed, and in consequence in most\r\ninstances incapable of conception[800]. Upon these sterile females,\r\nyou also heard, devolve in general the principal labours of their\r\nrespective colonies, showing the beneficent design of PROVIDENCE\r\nin exempting them from sexual cares and desires, and meriting for\r\nthem the more appropriate name, now generally used, of _workers_.\r\nThe differences in the structure of the female bee and the workers\r\nwere also then accounted for; and similar reasoning may be had\r\nrecourse to with regard to those of ants, in which the worker and\r\nthe female differ still more materially. My reason for introducing\r\nthis subject here, is to observe to you that I have some grounds for\r\nthinking that this system extends further than is usually supposed,\r\nand that to each species in some _Coleopterous_ and other genera\r\nthere are certain individuals intermediate between the male and\r\nfemale; this I seem to have observed more especially in _Copris_ and\r\n_Onthophagus_. For in almost every British species in my cabinet of\r\nthese genera I possess such an individual, distinguished particularly\r\nby having a horn on the head longer than that of the female, but much\r\nshorter than that of the male. I once observed a pair of _Pentatoma\r\noleracea_, a very pretty bug, _in coitu_, both sexes being ornamented\r\nwith _white_ spots, and by them stood a third distinguished from them\r\nby _red_ ones. I do not, however, build on this circumstance, though\r\nsingular; but mention it merely that you may keep it in your eye. It\r\nwould be curious should it turn up, that, to answer some particular\r\nend of PROVIDENCE, in some tribes of insects there are two kinds of\r\n_males_, as in the gregarious ones two descriptions of _females_.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[703] Herold _Schmetterl._ tab. expl. vii.\r\n\r\n[704] Herold _Schmetterl._ _t._ iv. _f._ 1. _x._ &c.

When we reflect upon the wonderful velocity,\r\ntheir size considered, with which many insects move, and the\r\nunparalleled degree of muscular force that many exert[802], we feel\r\nno small degree of curiosity to know something of that part of their\r\ninternal structure that produces these almost incredible effects. I\r\nshall in the present letter endeavour in some degree to gratify that\r\ncuriosity, and give you an account of the _muscles_ of these little\r\nanimals,--first considering them in _general_; and then, as far as my\r\ninformation goes, adverting to those in _particular_ that move the\r\ndifferent parts and organs of an insect's body.\r\n\r\nI. The muscles of insects may be considered in general as to their\r\n_Origin_; _Substance_ and _Parts_; _Shape_; _Colour_; _Kinds_;\r\n_Attachment_; and _Motions_.\r\n\r\ni. _Origin._ The origin of the muscular fibre in the higher animals\r\nis from the _blood_, the globules of which, by their coagulation in a\r\n_series_, appear to form it[803]; and in insects it is derived from\r\nthe same universal source of nutrition and accretion, but not till\r\nit has been concreted into the adipose tissue or _epiploon_ before\r\nnoticed[804]. In the pupa of the cabbage-butterfly, Herold observed\r\nthat this substance first assumed a fine flocky appearance and a\r\nblue-green colour, and that from it so changed were produced tender\r\nbundles of muscular fibres, extending in various directions, the\r\nepiploon itself decreasing in proportion as they were formed[805].\r\n\r\nii. _Substance_ and _Parts_. The muscular fibre in vertebrate animals\r\nappears to consist of globules arranged in a series, and of no larger\r\ndiameter than those of the blood,--the mean diameter of which in the\r\nhuman subject, when measured under the microscope by a micrometer, is\r\nfound to be about 1/5000th part of an inch[806]. When Cuvier published\r\nhis immortal work in 1805, the powers of any magnifier then constructed\r\nwere not sufficient to enable this great physiologist to arrive at\r\nthe simple fibre[807]; but Mr. Bauer, by the use of improved glasses,\r\namongst other discoveries that will immortalize his name, was the first\r\nto detect, under the directions of Sir E. Home, the ultimate thread\r\nof which the muscular bundles are composed[808]. Chemists distinguish\r\nthe substance of which we are speaking, by the name of _fibrine_. By\r\nthe abundance of azote or nitrogen that enters into its composition,\r\nit possesses a character of animalization more marked than any other\r\nanimal substance; and its elements are so approximated in the blood,\r\nthat the slightest stagnation causes them to coagulate: and the muscles\r\nare without doubt, in the living subject, the only organs that can\r\nseparate this matter from the mass of blood, and appropriate it to\r\nthemselves[809]. The _primary_ bundles of muscles are formed of the\r\nsimple fibres, and the _secondary_ are the result of an aggregation of\r\nthe primary. The smaller bundles are not always exactly parallel to\r\neach other, but must in many cases diverge more or less, to produce\r\nthose variations in shape observable in the muscles themselves: there\r\nare intervals therefore between the bundles, which in some animals are\r\nfilled by a cellular substance[810]. Probably much of this statement\r\nwill apply in most instances to the muscles of _insects_, but we may\r\nconclude that the globules that form them are infinitely smaller[811].\r\nLyonet has given some interesting observations with regard to those\r\nof the caterpillar of the _Cossus_: he describes them as of a soft\r\ntransparent substance, capable of great extension, covered and filled\r\nby silver tubes of the _bronchiæ_, penetrated by the nerves, and\r\ncontaining oily particles. Each muscle was enveloped in membrane, and\r\nwas composed of many parallel bands, consisting of bundles of fibres\r\nenveloped likewise in separate membranes. The fibres themselves, (but\r\nit is doubtful whether he arrived at the ultimate term of muscular\r\nfibre,) in a favourable light and under a good magnifier, appeared\r\nto be twisted spirally[812]. In spiders the muscles seemed to him\r\nto consist of _two_ substances, the one soft and the other hard,\r\nthe last forming a kind of stiff twisted filament[813]. A muscle\r\nthus composed of different bundles of fibres may be stated as to its\r\n_parts_, in _insects_, to consist of base, middle, and apex: the\r\n_base_ is that part by which they are fixed to any given point of\r\nthe internal surface of the crust, or of one of its processes, which\r\nserves as their fulcrum; the _apex_ is that part by which they are\r\nfixed, either mediately or immediately, to the organ to be moved; and\r\nthe _middle_ is the remainder of the muscle. We usually discover in\r\nthem no inflation of the middle corresponding with the _belly_ of the\r\nmuscles in vertebrate animals; they occasionally, however, terminate in\r\na _tendon_, as those of the thighs and legs; but these tendons are of\r\na different nature from the fibrous ones of warm-blooded animals; for\r\nthey are hard, elastic, and without apparent fibres: the fleshy ones of\r\nthe muscle envelope them, and are inserted in their surface[814].\r\n\r\niii. _Shape._ The muscles of insects are usually _linear_, with\r\nparallel sides; some are _cylindrical_, as those of the wings of the\r\n_Libellulina_[815]; and others, as those that move the legs in the\r\ncaterpillar of the _Cossus_, are triangular[816]. In the suctorious\r\nmandibles of the grub of a common water-beetle[817] they are\r\n_penniform_, or shaped like a feather; and some in the _Cossus_ are\r\nforked[818]. Under this head I may also observe, that the muscles\r\nare sometimes extremely slender threads, crossing each other, and\r\noften curiously interwoven in various directions, so as to resemble\r\nlace or fine gauze, as may be seen in the alimentary canal of some\r\ncaterpillars[819]; sometimes also they surround part of this organ,\r\nlike a series of minute rings[820].\r\n\r\niv. _Colour._ The most usual colour of the muscles of insects is\r\n_white_: those for flight however, according to Chabrier, differ\r\nfrom the rest, by being of a deeper and _reddish_ colour[821]; and\r\nI have observed likewise that those in the head of the stag-beetle,\r\nwhen dried at least, are _red_, and look something like the flesh of\r\nwarm-blooded animals.\r\n\r\nv. _Kinds_ and _Denomination_. In general, muscles may be regarded as\r\ndivided into _primary_ and _secondary_--the _primary_ being the muscles\r\nby which the _principal_ movements of any organs are effected, and the\r\n_secondary_ their auxiliaries which are the cause of _subordinate_\r\nmovements[822]. Every muscle almost has its _antagonist_, the action of\r\nwhich is in an opposite direction; so that when it is equal, the organ\r\nto which they are attached remains without motion; but when that of one\r\npreponderates, a movement in proportion takes place[823]. The principal\r\nantagonist muscles that may be found in insects are the following.\r\n1. _Levator muscles_ that _raise_ an organ, and _Depressors_ that\r\n_depress_ it. 2. _Flexors_ that _bend_ an organ, and _Extensors_ that\r\n_unbend_ or extend it. 3. _Abductors_ that draw an organ _back_, and\r\n_Adductors_ that draw it _forwards_. 4. _Constrictors_ that _contract_\r\nan opening, and _Laxators_ that _relax_ it. 5. _Supinators_ that _turn_\r\nthe underside of an organ upwards, and _Pronators_ that _return_ it\r\nto its natural situation. Some of these muscles in insects, like some\r\nof their articulations and their spinal chord[824], seem to exercise\r\na _double_ function,--thus the levators and depressors of the _wings_\r\nare constrictors and laxators of the _trunk_[825]. At first it may\r\nseem that insects, not having the power of turning up the hand, cannot\r\nhave the _Supinator_ and _Pronator_ muscles; but some muscle of this\r\nkind must be in the _Gryllotalpa_, and in those that have a versatile\r\nhead[826].\r\n\r\nv. _Attachment_ and _Insertion_. The attachment and insertion of the\r\nmuscles in insects in general is to the _interior_ of the crust, or\r\nto some of its internal processes as a fulcrum, and to the organ to\r\nbe moved. In some cases, however, the muscles act upon the organ by\r\nthe intervention of other bodies. Thus, those that move the wings\r\nare often attached to little _bones_, as Chabrier calls them[827],\r\nwhich are connected with the base of the wings by ligaments. In the\r\n_Dynastidæ_ and other Lamellicorns, and the _Libellulina_, &c., a\r\nremarkable provision is made for giving a vast increment of force to\r\nthe muscles of the wings, by means of caps or cupules surmounted by\r\na tendon, which receive their extremity; the tendon terminating in a\r\nfine point attached to the wing, and thus more muscles are brought to\r\nbear upon it[828]. Chabrier seems to think that, in some cases, the\r\n_back_ that intervenes between each pair of wings is the medium by\r\nwhich the muscles act upon it[829].\r\n\r\nvi. _Motions._ Irritability is the universal distinction of the\r\nmuscular fibre,--when put in action by the will or involuntarily, it\r\ncauses it to contract or become shorter; and the intermediate agents\r\nof the will and other causes are the _nerves_, which, as galvanic\r\nexperiments seem in some degree to prove, are the conductors of an\r\ninvisible fluid or power which immediately causes that action. If a\r\nnerve is divided, the muscles to which it renders obey it no longer,\r\nevidently proving that the nerves cause muscular irritability[830].\r\nHow this contraction is immediately effected,--whether the fibre, as\r\nsome suppose, undergoes any _crispation_, or becomes zigzag[831], or\r\nwhether there is any sudden change in their _chemical_ composition\r\nthat rapidly and strongly augments their cohesion, as Cuvier\r\nhints[832], cannot be clearly ascertained, unless a Bauer could\r\nsubmit the _living_ fibre to his glasses. All that we know certainly\r\non the subject is, that muscles alternately contract and relax at\r\nthe bidding of the will or involuntarily, and so occasion all the\r\nmovements of animal bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Having considered the muscles of insects in _general_, I must next\r\nmake a few observations, as far as my means of information will enable\r\nme, upon those that move their different _parts_ and _organs_--at least\r\nthe principal ones; since to descend to minutiæ would be an endless\r\nand unprofitable labour. As _larvæ_, except those whose metamorphosis\r\nis _semicomplete_[833], differ widely in their system of muscles from\r\n_perfect insects_, I shall begin my observations with them.\r\n\r\nWe owe by far the most accurate and detailed account of the muscles\r\nof larvæ to the illustrious Lyonet, who, with incredible labour and\r\npatience without example, dissected the caterpillar of the _Cossus_,\r\nand has described every air-vessel, every nerve, and every muscle\r\nthat could be detected by the microscope. Cuvier also has given a\r\ndescription of the muscles not only of caterpillars, but of the larvæ\r\nof the Lamellicorn beetles, the _Hydrophili_, and the Capricorn\r\nbeetles[834]. From these sources are derived what I have now to lay\r\nbefore you. If you look at one of Lyonet's plates[835], the layers of\r\n_longitudinal_ muscles look like so many parallel ribands, others run\r\nin an _oblique_, and others again in a _transverse_ direction[836].\r\nHe divides them into _dorsal_, _ventral_, and _lateral_ muscles[837],\r\nterms which sufficiently explain themselves. Of the _longitudinal_\r\nmuscles there are _four_ principal rows[838], the others are more\r\nnumerous. The principal object of these muscles, which are flexors\r\nand extensors, is to shorten or lengthen the body, or to act on any\r\nparticular segment as the circumstances of the animal may require. I\r\nshall not here notice the muscles of the _head_ and _legs_, as they\r\nare not _remarkably_ different from those of perfect insects. The\r\n_prolegs_ are moved by _two_ muscles--the anterior one covering in\r\npart the posterior--of a remarkable structure: one of their points\r\nof attachment is by many branches or tails to the sole of the foot,\r\nand by several heads to the skin of the animal; so that they can\r\ndraw the proleg within the body or push it out, and perform other\r\nnecessary movements[839].\r\n\r\nI shall now call your attention to the muscles of the _perfect_\r\ninsect, as they move the _head_ and its organs; the _Trunk_; the\r\n_Abdomen_; and the _Viscera_.\r\n\r\ni. The _Head_. This part in insects moves upwards, downwards,\r\ninwards, to right and left, is pushed forth or drawn in, is often\r\ncapable in part of a rotatory movement, and is sometimes versatile,\r\nturning as it were upon a pivot. All these movements are of course\r\nproduced by an appropriate apparatus of _muscles_, which have their\r\nattachment in the _anterior_ part of the trunk, mostly in the\r\n_manitrunk_, while their insertion is in the _posterior_ part of\r\nthe head, in the margin of the occipital cavity. To enumerate and\r\ndescribe them all would be tedious and uninteresting--I shall only\r\nmention some of the principal ones. The _levators_ of the head are\r\nusually a _pair_ of muscles situated in the manitrunk, to the upper\r\nside of which they are attached, and perhaps in _Coleoptera_ and\r\nsome others to the _phragma_, which probably Cuvier means by the\r\n_anterior_ part of the _scutellum_[840]; they are inserted in the\r\nposterior margin of the upper part of the head, in _Coleoptera_ in\r\na _pair_ of notches (_Myoglyphides_[841]), or a single one[842].\r\nIn _Cordylia Palmarum_ these muscles as they approach the head, to\r\njudge from the _dead_ animal, divide into _two_ branches or a fork:\r\nthus, as the muscle-notches are wide in this insect, the muscle\r\nacts upon each extremity of the sinus--these branches appear to be\r\n_tendinous_[843]. The _depressors_ of the head are the antagonist\r\nmuscles to the above, and have their attachment to the _antepectus_\r\nand its _antefurca_[844]. A circumstance distinguishes these muscles\r\nin many _Coleoptera_, that seems hitherto to have been overlooked.\r\nIf you take the common dung-beetle (_Geotrupes stercorarius_), and\r\ncarefully extract the _head_ with its muscles from the trunk, you\r\nwill see on each side of the depressors a subovate corneous scale,\r\nof a pitch colour[845], which is attached only to the muscle, and\r\ndesigned to strengthen it: if you then examine the anterior cavity\r\nof the _manitrunk_, you will perceive on each side, just within the\r\nlower margin, a minute triangular scale, of a similar substance;\r\nthese ligaments, like the pax-wax, or _ligamenta nuchæ_, in\r\n_mammalia_, though in a lower situation, are doubtless intended to\r\nsustain the action of the muscles.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the moveable _organs_ of the head--the _antennæ_,\r\n_maxillæ_, _palpi_, _tongue_, _mandibulæ_, &c., have each their\r\nappropriate apparatus of muscles: but I shall only notice those\r\nof the last, the _mandibulæ_. These are principally _abductors_\r\nand _adductors_ to open and shut them: from the work that the jaws\r\nof some insects have to do, you may conjecture that they must be\r\nfurnished with powerful muscles. In caterpillars and other larvæ,\r\nin which state the action of the mandibles is most in requisition,\r\nthe muscles are what Cuvier calls _penniform_[846], and are\r\nattached on each side to a tendinous lamina or cartilage. In\r\nthe grub of _Dytiscus_ the power and magnitude of the _adductor_\r\nmuscle is wonderful[847]. In the _Orthoptera_ this structure of the\r\nmandibular muscles takes place also in the _imago_[848]; but in\r\nthe _Coleoptera_, at least in the stag-beetle and some others that\r\nI have examined, these muscles in this state have no cartilage or\r\ntendon. Their attachment is always to the _parietes_ of the head,\r\nof the cavity of which the _adductors_, in some cases, occupy a\r\nconsiderable portion[849]. As to their insertion--these last, in some\r\n_Orthoptera_, enter more or less the interior of the mandible[850];\r\nbut commonly they are inserted at or near the _interior_ angle of the\r\nmandibular basal cavity, and the _abductors_ at the _exterior_.\r\n\r\nii. The _Trunk_. We have little information with regard to the\r\nmuscles of the parts of the trunk itself, by which, in some insects,\r\nthe manitrunk is enabled to move independently of the alitrunk:\r\nit is more probable that the levators have in part at least their\r\nattachment to the anterior surface of the prophragm[851], than that\r\nthe levators of the head should be there fixed, as Cuvier seems to\r\nthink; since both the _phragma_ and the ligament that appears in many\r\ncases to close the cavity of the manitrunk round the viscera[852],\r\nwould prevent all communication between those muscles and any part\r\nconnected with the scutellum: probably the depressors have their\r\nattachment partly on the anterior face of the _medifurca_[853]. These\r\npoints, however, must be left to future investigators.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _organs_ of the trunk, we have more certain\r\nand satisfactory information;--the muscles of the _legs_ having\r\nbeen described by Lyonet and Cuvier, and those of the wings most\r\nparticularly by Chabrier. In caterpillars, the muscles are situated\r\nin the interior of the articulations that form the legs: they consist\r\nof several bundles appropriated to each, which have their attachment\r\nin the _parietes_ of the preceding joint, near the margin, and\r\nare inserted in the margin of that they move[854]. Lyonet counted\r\n_twenty-one_ muscles in the leg of the caterpillar of the _Cossus_;\r\nbut eight of these were appropriated to the claw, or rather formed a\r\npair of _semipenniform_ muscles, having their insertion at the inner\r\nangle of its base[855]. In _perfect_ insects, according to Cuvier,\r\neach joint of the legs is furnished with a _pair_ of antagonist\r\nmuscles--a flexor and extensor, the former being the _lower_, and\r\nthe latter the _upper_ muscle; and this pair has its insertion in\r\nthe joint it moves, and its attachment usually in the preceding one:\r\nbut those of the coxæ--which are _rotators_, causing it to turn\r\nbackwards or forwards--and the extensor of the thigh, have their\r\nattachment in the _parietes_ of the trunk, and to the _endosternum_;\r\none of the _rotators_ of the _anterior_ coxa, and the extensor of\r\nthe _anterior_ thigh to the _antefurca_; of the _intermediate_ pairs\r\nto the _medifurca_, and of the _posterior_ to the _postfurca_[856].\r\nEvery joint of the _tarsus_ has also its flexor and extensor. In\r\nthe ground- and water-beetles (_Eutrech_in_a_ and _Eunech_in_a_),\r\n&c., whose posterior coxæ are immoveable, the thigh includes two\r\npair of antagonist muscles[857]. In extracting the posterior leg\r\nof _Necrophorus Vespillo_ I observed more than a _single_ pair of\r\nmuscles that had their attachment in the coxa; and probably many\r\nother variations in this respect exist.\r\n\r\nLittle was known with respect to the most interesting part of the\r\nmuscular apparatus of insects, that by which such wonderfully rapid\r\nand varied motions are imparted to their organs of flight, till\r\nChabrier undertook to elucidate it; which he has done in a manner\r\nthat will confer a lasting honour upon his name, as one of the\r\nmost able successors to Swammerdam and Lyonet in their peculiar\r\ndepartment. He has given a most admirable account of the internal\r\nanatomy of the trunk of insects in general, as far as it relates to\r\ntheir flight; particularly of that of the cockchafer (_Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_), of one of the _Libellulina_ (_Æshna grandis_), and of a\r\nbumble-bee (_Bombus_); and I believe he has thus illustrated insects\r\nof some of the other Orders, but his memoirs on these I have not had\r\nan opportunity of consulting. What I have to say on this subject,\r\ntherefore, will be principally derived from what he has communicated\r\nwith respect to the above insects.\r\n\r\nA considerable difference in the volume of the muscles of the wings\r\ntakes place in insects according to the force of their flight. Where\r\nit is rapid and powerful, the alitrunk is nearly filled by them,\r\nand the alimentary canal is much attenuated; but in those whose\r\nflight is feeble, they occupy less space, and the alimentary canal\r\nis proportionally enlarged[858]. In the _Lepidoptera_, _Hymenoptera_\r\nand _Diptera_, the principal muscles of _both_ wings have their\r\nattachment in the _anterior_ portion of the alitrunk[859]; in the\r\n_Coleoptera_, in the _posterior_[860]; and in the _Libellulina_, those\r\nof the _anterior_ wings are confined to the _anterior_ portion, and\r\nthose of the _posterior_ pair to the _posterior_[861]. The muscles\r\nfor flight in general differ from others by their mass, length,\r\nand colour; the bundles of fibres are very distinct, strong, and\r\nparallel; their direction is uniform, according to the motion they\r\nare to produce; their fibres are either attached to the solid parts\r\nto be moved, or to cupules, but they never terminate in a tendon;\r\nthe muscles are perfectly independent of each other, and the wings\r\ncan be moved by them separately[862]. As to their _denomination_ and\r\nkind--the principal ones are the _levators_ and _depressors_, which\r\nwith respect to the _trunk_, as was before observed, are _constrictors_\r\nand _laxators_. The _levator_ muscles form several distinct bundles\r\nin _Coleoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, &c.; in the _Diptera_ there are\r\nthree[863]; in the _Libellulina_ they seem to be _single_, are all\r\nenvironed with a blackish pellicle, with numerous aërial vesicles,\r\nsymmetrically arranged, filling the interstices[864]. The most common\r\nnumber is a levator to each wing; there are often, however, as in\r\nthe cockchafer and the dragon-fly, _two_ depressors[865]: but in the\r\n_Hemiptera_, _Lepidoptera_, and saw-flies (_Serrifera_) amongst the\r\n_Hymenoptera_, the secondary wings have distinct levators, but not\r\ndepressors[866]; the other insects of that Order have only a pair of\r\neach[867]. The other wing-muscles are of a _secondary_ description,\r\nand auxiliary to the above. Their office is to extend and close the\r\nwings: so that though the denomination of _extensor_ will suit the\r\nformer, that of _flexor_ is not so proper for their antagonists;\r\ntheir office being not so much to _bend_, as to bring back the wing\r\nto its station of repose. The folding of certain wings, as those of\r\n_Coleoptera_, _Dermaptera_, the _Vespidæ_, &c., seems more the function\r\nof the _abdomen_ than of the wing-muscles; this you may easily see,\r\nas I have often done, if you attend to any _Staphylinus_, when after\r\nalighting from flight it proceeds to fold up its wings under the\r\nelytra. Perhaps the term _retractor_ might not be inapplicable to the\r\nmuscles in question. Both these and the extensors are usually small\r\nslender muscles, but sometimes numerous[868]. They are larger in the\r\n_Coleoptera_, _Lepidoptera_, and saw-flies[869]. The muscles that open\r\nand shut the _elytra_ of _Coleoptera_, and probably of _Heteropterous\r\nHemiptera_, and which also aid their movements during flight, are\r\nvery slender[870]. With regard to the attachment and insertion of\r\nthe wing-muscles, it is according to two very distinct types, one of\r\nwhich appertains to insects in general, and the other is peculiar to\r\nthe _Libellulina_. In insects in _general_, the principal muscles for\r\nflight have not their insertion in the wings, but act upon their bases\r\nby the intervention of small long pieces. The depressors occupy the\r\nmiddle and upper region of the alitrunk, and are inserted anteriorly\r\nand posteriorly upon the concave surfaces of two transverse horny\r\nsemi-partitions, adapted by their elasticity to dilate the trunk--and\r\nthus acting the part of both diaphragm and ribs[871]: but in the\r\n_Libellulina_, as in birds, these muscles are placed on each side\r\nof the point of support of the humerus[872]; the _depressors_ being\r\nattached immediately to the wings _without_ it, and the _levators\r\nwithin_ it, with this sole difference, that they are connected to the\r\ninternal extremity of the base of the wing by the intervention of a\r\ncupule terminating in a tendon; all are disposed _perpendicularly_\r\nto the arms of the levers on which they act, and all incline more or\r\nless _outwards_, the one to _dilate_, and the other to _contract_ the\r\ntrunk[873]. It may be observed in general, that in insects formed upon\r\nthe _first_ type, the _great_ action of these muscles is the dilatation\r\nand contraction of the alitrunk, the main tendency of which is to\r\n_depress_ and _raise_ the wings[874]. I shall add here a few words\r\nupon the attachment of the wing-muscles in the different Orders: but\r\nfirst I must request you to read what I have said on the partitions\r\nand chambers of the alitrunk in a former letter[875]. In most insects\r\nof the _first_ type, the depressors are longitudinal dorsal muscles\r\nthat have their _posterior_ point of attachment in the _metaphragm_\r\n(_costale_ Chabr.); but the _anterior_ varies:--in those that have\r\n_elytra_, _tegmina_, or _hemelytra_, the muscles for them seem to\r\nbe contained in the chamber, varying in size, that lies between the\r\n_prophragm_ and _mesophragm_; and the anterior point of attachment of\r\ntheir depressor muscles is the _mesophragm_: they are also attached\r\nin some to the _metathorax_ or back of the posterior portion of the\r\nalitrunk[876]. The levator muscles in _Coleoptera_, at least in the\r\ncockchafer, by a long tendon have their posterior attachment in the\r\nlower part of the posterior coxæ[877], their anterior attachment to\r\nthe solid parts to be moved. In the _Cockchafer_ and the _Dynastidæ_,\r\nbut _not_ in _Geotrupes_, on each side of the cavity of the metathorax\r\nunder the base of the wing is a large and small cupule, which from\r\ntheir _lateral_ situation one would think must receive the _levator_\r\nmuscles--apparently unnoticed by M. Chabrier; but as there is a _pair_\r\nof these cupules on each side, there must have been also a _pair_ of\r\nmuscles attached to them, which does not agree with his statement[878].\r\nIn the _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_ the anterior attachment of the\r\n_depressors_ is to the back of the alitrunk and to the prophragm,\r\nand the levators to the breast, and the sides of the back of the\r\ntrunk[879]. In the _Libellulina_ the depressors and levators that\r\nterminate, by a tendon surmounting a cupule, in the base of the wings,\r\nhave their posterior attachment in the breast. These cylindrical\r\nmuscles with their cupule and tendon look like so many syringes[880].\r\n\r\nHaving thus described to you the powerful muscular apparatus by\r\nwhich, either mediately or immediately, the _wings_ of insects\r\nare moved, it will not be out of place if I add a few words upon\r\ntheir _flight_ itself. The great object in this is to generate a\r\ncentrifugal force which may counteract the weight of the body.\r\nIts wings are the _external_ organs by which the insect as it\r\nwere takes hold of the air when they fall, and is impelled by it\r\nwhen they rise; its head makes way for it; its abdomen, as a\r\nrudder, steers it; and by alternately increasing and diminishing\r\nin volume, and rising and falling, enables it to win an easy way\r\nthrough the fluctuations of the atmospheric sea. The trunk by its\r\nelasticity admits the internal action of antagonist muscles, which\r\nby turns compress and dilate it; an action promoting the elevation\r\nand depression of the wings, and keeping up the elasticity of the\r\ninternal air, which is thus now rarified and now condensed: in the\r\n_former_ state flowing like a tide, accompanied by the blood, into\r\nthe nervures of the wings[881], and thus increasing their tension and\r\ncentrifugal force;--in the _latter_ ebbing and receding to the trunk,\r\nthus relaxing the one and diminishing the other. The spiracles by\r\nwhich the air enters or is expelled, open and shut at the animal's\r\npleasure[882]; and besides, many insects are furnished, as we have\r\nseen[883], with numerous vesicles or reservoirs, which can give out\r\na supply of internal air when wanted: and thus they can vary their\r\naërial motions, diminish or increase the counteracting centrifugal\r\nforce; rise and fall, and move onwards and in different directions,\r\nas their occasions demand.\r\n\r\niii. The _Abdomen_ is perhaps capable of the greatest variety of\r\nmotions of the three primary sections of the body. Even when the\r\ninsect is reposing, a constant dilatation and contraction usually\r\ntakes place in it[884]; and from its annular structure, its parts\r\ncapable of separate motion are numerous:--it expands and contracts;\r\nit rises and falls; it bends in various directions; and its segments\r\ncan often be lengthened or retracted. Besides all this, its spiracles\r\nopen and shut, and its reproductive and other anal organs have their\r\nappropriate motions. In numerous _Coleoptera_, however, and some\r\n_Hemiptera_, the _upper-side_ of the abdomen is almost the only part\r\nthat is moveable, especially near the trunk; the _under-side_, having\r\nits first segments soldered together, is only capable of motion near\r\nthe tail[885]. The muscles that produce the various motions of this\r\npart must be entitled to all the denominations stated above[886]. I\r\nhave on a former occasion explained to you how, in insects that have\r\na petiolate abdomen, that part is elevated and depressed[887]. In\r\nthose with a sessile one the base is attached to the metaphragm by\r\nstrong ligaments[888], and the muscles that move the first piece act\r\nfrom one segment to another. The _partial_ movements of the segments\r\nof this part, where they have place, are produced by muscular fibres\r\nwhich extend from the whole _anterior_ margin of one to the whole\r\n_posterior_ one of that which precedes it. If those, for example,\r\nof the back contract, the abdomen becoming shorter above, bends\r\nupwards; and if those of the sides or belly, it bends sideways or\r\ndownwards[889]: this is a beautiful as well as simple contrivance.\r\n\r\nThe alternate rush of air from the abdomen into the alitrunk, and\r\nfrom the atmosphere into the abdomen, is attended by the constriction\r\nor expansion of that part as it rises or falls in flight[890], which\r\nseems to require the action of constrictor and laxator muscles.\r\n\r\niv. The _Viscera_. Having before had occasion sufficiently to notice\r\nthe muscles by which the systole and diastole of the _dorsal vessel_\r\nof insects is maintained[891], I shall now only mention those that\r\nare _woven_ round their alimentary canal, by which the peristaltic\r\nmotion of that organ, causing its contractions and the propulsion of\r\nits contents, takes place. One would at first think that a view of the\r\n_intestines_ of any animal could under no circumstances afford any\r\nvery pleasing spectacle to the eye of any but a scientific spectator;\r\nbut any _lady_ who is fond of going to Disons to be tempted with an\r\nexhibition of fine lace, would experience an unexpected gratification\r\ncould she be brought to examine those of a caterpillar under a\r\nmicroscope: with wonder and delight she would survey the innumerable\r\nmuscular threads that in various directions envelope the gullet,\r\nstomach, and lower intestines of one of these little animals; some\r\nrunning longitudinally, others transversely, others crossing each\r\nother obliquely, so as to form a pattern of rhomboids or squares;\r\nothers again, surrounding the intestine like so many rings, and\r\nalmost all exhibiting the appearance of being woven, and resembling\r\nfine lace,--one pattern ornamenting one organ; another, a second; and\r\nanother, a third. This will suffice to give some idea of this part of\r\nthe muscular structure of these little animals[892].\r\n\r\nLyonet counted the muscles contained in the body of the caterpillar\r\nof the _Cossus_. In the head he found 228; in the body, 1647; and\r\nenveloping the intestines, no less than 2186; which, after deducting\r\n20 that are common to the gullet and the head, gives a total of\r\n4061[893]. In the human subject only 529 have been counted[894]: so\r\nthat this minute animal has 3532 muscles more than the Lord of the\r\ncreation!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the _Arachnida_ seem less numerous than those of\r\ninsects. In the _Scorpionidea_ they appear to be robust, formed of\r\nsimple straight fibres, of a whitish gray colour: a muscular web,\r\nrather strong, clothes the _parietes_, but rarely adheres to them,\r\nof the abdomen, and envelopes the _viscera_, with the exception of\r\nthe lungs, and probably of the heart. The dorsal part of this web\r\ngives birth to seven pairs of filiform muscles, which traverse the\r\nliver, and are attached to a muscular riband which, passing above\r\nthe lungs, runs the whole length of the ventral _parietes_. These\r\nmuscles when exposed to view resemble extended cords. The abdominal\r\nsegment preceding the tail is filled with a powerful muscular mass\r\nwhich moves that organ[895]. Treviranus discovered two longitudinal\r\nmuscles in _Scorpio europæus_, running from the breast to the tail,\r\nwhich above and below each gill were connected by another running\r\ntransversely across the heart, thus forming a quadrangular area in\r\nwhich the gills are situate[896]. The heart appears to be moved by\r\nmuscles not very dissimilar to those of the _Cossus_[897], as is\r\nlikewise that of the _Araneidea_; in _Clubiona atrox_ the wider part\r\nof this organ is muscular, and incloses a considerable cavity[898].\r\nIn this tribe the muscles of the abdomen, the skin of which is soft\r\nand unfit to act as a lever to them, are attached to a cartilage, and\r\nthus their action is better sustained[899].\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid before you all of importance that I can collect\r\nwith regard to the apparatus of muscles discoverable in insects,\r\nI shall next say something upon a few other points connected with\r\nthat subject. When I enlarged upon their _motions_, I related a\r\nfew instances of the extraordinary power of that apparatus[900] in\r\n_leaping_ ones; but this power is not confined to that circumstance.\r\nThe _flea_, not more remarkable for its compressed form, enabling\r\nit to glide between the hairs of animals, and its elastic coat of\r\nmail, by which it can resist the ordinary pressure of the fingers,\r\nthan for its muscular strength, has attracted notice on this account\r\nfrom ancient times. Mouffet relates that an ingenious English\r\nmechanic, named Mark, made a golden chain of the length of a finger,\r\nwith a lock and key, which was dragged by a flea;--he had heard of\r\nanother that was harnessed to a golden chariot, which it drew with\r\nthe greatest ease[901]. Another English workman made an ivory coach\r\nwith six horses, a coachman on the seat with a dog between his\r\nlegs, a postillion, four persons in the coach, and four lacqueys\r\nbehind--which also was dragged by a single flea. At such a spectacle\r\none would hardly know which most to admire, the strength and agility\r\nof the insect, or the patience of the workman. Latreille mentions a\r\nflea of a moderate size dragging a silver cannon on wheels, that was\r\ntwenty-four times its own weight, which being charged with powder,\r\nwas fired without the flea appearing alarmed[902]. Many caterpillars\r\nare accustomed to extend their bodies from a twig, supported merely\r\nby the four hind feet, in one fixed attitude, either in an oblique,\r\nhorizontal, or vertical direction, either upwards or downwards, and\r\nthat for hours together. We may conceive what prodigious muscular\r\nforce must be exerted upon this occasion, by reflecting that the\r\nmost expert rope-dancer, though endued with the power of grasping\r\nwith his feet like a bird with its claws, could not maintain himself\r\nin a horizontal position even for an instant. Bradley asserts that\r\nhe has seen a stag-beetle carry a wand half a yard long and half an\r\ninch thick, and fly with it several yards[903]. Some insects have the\r\nfaculty of resisting pressure in a wonderful degree. If you take a\r\ncommon dung-chafer (_Geotrupes_) in your hand and press it with all\r\nyour strength, you will find with what wonderful force it resists\r\nyou; and that you can scarcely overcome the counteraction, and retain\r\nthe insect in your hand: was it not for this quality, the grub of\r\nthe gad-fly must be crushed probably in passing through the anal\r\nsphincter of the horse[904]. But that of _Eristalis tenax_ affords\r\na more surprising instance of this power of counteraction:--an\r\ninhabitant of muddy pools, it has occasionally been taken up with\r\nthe water used in paper-making, and strange to say, according to\r\nLinné, has resisted without injury the immense pressure given to\r\nthe surrounding pulp[905]; like _leather-coat Jack_ mentioned by\r\nMr. Bell[906], who, from a similar force of muscle, could suffer\r\ncarriages to drive over him without receiving any injury. Almost\r\nas remarkable is the state of extreme relaxation into which the\r\nmuscles of some larvæ fall, when their animation is suspended; and\r\nthe revived tension to which a subsequent resumption of the vital\r\npowers restores them. Bonnet having suspended the animation of the\r\ncaterpillar of _Sphinx Ligustri_ by keeping it submerged, squeezed\r\nit between his fingers, until it had wholly lost its cylindrical\r\nform and was as flat and supple as the empty finger of a glove; yet\r\nin less than an hour the very same caterpillar became as firm, as\r\ncompact, as cylindrical, and in short, as well, as though it had\r\nnever been submitted to treatment so rough[907].\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate that animals of a large size, as has been well\r\nremarked, especially noxious ones, have not been endowed with a\r\nmuscular power proportionable to that of insects. A _cockchafer_,\r\nrespect being had to their size, would be _six_ times stronger than\r\na _horse_; and if the _elephant_, as Linné has observed, was strong\r\nin proportion to the _stag-beetle_, it would be able to pull up rocks\r\nby the root, and to level mountains[908]. Were the _lion_ and the\r\n_tiger_ as strong and as swift for their magnitude as the _Cicindela_\r\nand the _Carabus_, nothing could have escaped them by precaution, or\r\nwithstood them by strength. Could the _viper_ and the _rattlesnake_\r\nmove with a rapidity and force equivalent to that of the _Iulus_ and\r\n_Scolopendra_, who could have avoided their venemous bite? But the\r\nCREATOR in these little creatures has manifested his Almighty POWER,\r\nin showing what he could have done had he so willed; and his GOODNESS\r\nin not creating the higher animals endued with powers and velocity\r\nupon the same scale with that of insects, which would probably\r\nhave caused the early desolation of the world that he has made.\r\nFrom this instance we may conjecture, that after the resurrection,\r\nour bodies by a change in the structure and composition of their\r\nmuscular fibre--for we know that their locomotive powers and organs,\r\nas far as the muscle is concerned, will then be of a very different\r\nnature[909]--may become fitted for motions and a potent agency of\r\nwhich we have now no conception.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful strength of insects is doubtless the result of something\r\npeculiar in the structure and arrangement of their muscles, and\r\nprincipally their extraordinary power of contraction, excited by the\r\nextent of their respiration: for animals that respire but little, as\r\nthe fœtus in the womb and the pullet in the egg, have very little\r\ncontractile muscular power[910]. To get some idea from facts of this\r\nextraordinary contractile power in insects,--extract the sting of a bee\r\nor a wasp, with its muscles, which appear to be attached to powerful\r\ncartilaginous plates[911], and you will find it continue for a long\r\ntime to dart forth its spicula, almost as powerfully as when moved\r\nby the will of the animal. A still more extraordinary instance of\r\nirritability is exhibited by the _antlia_, or instrument of suction of\r\nthe butterfly. If this organ, which the insect can roll up spirally\r\nlike a watchspring or extend in a straight direction, be cut off as\r\nsoon as the animal is disclosed from the chrysalis, it will continue\r\nto roll up and unroll itself as if still attached to its head: and if\r\nafter having apparently ceased to move for three or four hours it be\r\nmerely touched, it will again begin to move and resume the same action.\r\nThis surprising irritability and contractility of muscle doubtless\r\ndepends upon the peculiar structure of the antlia, which is composed of\r\nan infinite number of horny rings, acted upon by muscles, more numerous\r\nprobably than those which move the trunk of the elephant. The motion\r\nonly ceases when the muscles become dry and rigid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have already, under another head[912], considered the _annual_\r\nsleep, or winter state of torpidity of insects, during which an\r\nintermission for the most part of muscular motion and action takes\r\nplace. I shall now make a few observations with respect to their\r\n_diurnal_ sleep, which may very properly have its place in the\r\npresent letter. That insects, usually so incessantly busy and moving\r\nin every direction, require their intervals of repose, seems to\r\ncall for no proof. We see some that appear only in the _day_, and\r\nothers only in the _night_, others again only at certain hours;\r\nwhich leads to the conclusion, that when they withdraw from action\r\nand observation, it is to devote themselves to rest and sleep. The\r\ncockchafer flies only in the evening; but if you chance to meet\r\nwith it roosting in a tree in the earlier part of the day, you will\r\nfind it perfectly still and motionless, with its antennæ folded and\r\napplied to the breast:--we cannot indeed say that its eyes are shut;\r\nfor as insects have no eyelids, that sign of sleep can never be found\r\nin them. Again, if a Lepidopterist goes into the wood to capture\r\nmoths in the day-time, he finds them often perched on the lichens\r\nthat cover the north side of the trunk of a tree, with their wings\r\nand antennæ folded, and themselves without motion, and insensible of\r\nhis approach and their own danger. Thus it was that I captured that\r\nrare insect the lobster-moth (_Stauropus Fagi_) in the New Forest.\r\nSome, however, have asserted that the caterpillar of the silkworm,\r\nexcept when they moult, never intermits feeding day or night, and\r\nconsequently does not sleep: but the accuracy of this statement, both\r\nfrom analogy and observation, admits of great doubt. Malpighi informs\r\nus that these caterpillars for an hour and more, twice a day, remain\r\nimmoveable with their heads bent down as though asleep, and even if\r\ndisturbed, resume again the same inactive posture[913]; and other\r\nlarvæ in great numbers certainly seem to have regular intermissions\r\nfrom eating of considerable duration: those called Geometers, for\r\nhours together remain motionless projected from a twig, to which\r\nthey adhere by their posterior prolegs alone; and the processionary\r\ncaterpillars make only _nightly_ sorties from their nests, passing\r\nthe day in inaction and repose[914]. Bees have been often seen by\r\nHuber, when apparently wearied with exertion, even in the middle of\r\nthe day, to insert the half of their bodies into an empty cell, and\r\nremain there, as if taking a nap, without motion for half an hour\r\nor longer[915]; and at night they regularly muster in a state of\r\nsleep-like silence. Mr. Brightwell once observed an individual living\r\nspecimen of _Haltica concinna_, which appeared to remain motionless\r\non the same spot of a wall for three successive days.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding these remarks on the Internal Anatomy and\r\nPhysiology of Insects, I shall explain to you, as you will probably\r\nfeel inclined occasionally to pursue the subject, the best mode of\r\n_dissecting_ them.--By far the most useful dissecting instruments\r\nfor this purpose are very fine-pointed and sharp _scissors_, as\r\nthese will enable you to divide the integument and separate other\r\nparts with much less risk of injuring their delicate structure than\r\nany knife. These scissors are what Swammerdam chiefly used; and he\r\nhad some so extremely small and fine, that he was necessitated to\r\nemploy a lens when he sharpened them. If to these be added a sharp\r\nand fine-pointed _knife_ or two, some _needles_ fixed in handles,\r\nalso fine-pointed--(you will find them more convenient than any other\r\ninstrument for detaching minute parts and fibres,) a pair of fine\r\nand accurately adjusted _pliers_, and an assortment of camel's-hair\r\n_brushes_,--you will be nearly set up as an Entomological dissector.\r\nYou will still, however, require a small dissecting table, with a\r\nprojecting and moveable arm for lenses of various descriptions, so\r\nas to admit both the hands to be employed upon the subject under\r\nexamination; and for this purpose probably no contrivance can be\r\nbetter adapted than that of Lyonet, of which the figure in Adams _On\r\nthe Microscope_ will convey a better idea than any description[916].\r\n\r\nPreviously to dissecting any insect, it must be killed by plunging\r\nit into boiling water, which is recommended by Lyonet, or spirits of\r\nwine or of turpentine; and it is often useful to let _larvæ_ remain\r\na few days in the latter, by which means the vessels become firmer\r\nand stronger. The parts of _pupæ_ become much more distinct if they\r\nare boiled for a few minutes: and the same mode may be adopted in the\r\nexamination of spiders.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient mode of proceeding, which was that also of\r\nLyonet, is to dissect the insect in water, or, to avoid putridity,\r\nin diluted spirits,--if small, upon a concave glass, to which it\r\nshould be fastened by means of a little melted wax; if larger, in\r\nthe bottom of a common chip box, surrounded with a border of wax to\r\nretain the fluid. The integuments of the insect, being carefully\r\ndivided longitudinally with scissors, should if flexible be turned\r\nback, and fixed by small pins stuck in by a fine pair of pliers,\r\nwhile the skin at the same time is stretched by another. After\r\nmaking such observations as present themselves without further\r\ndissection, the viscera must be cautiously extracted, washing away\r\nthe fat which surrounds them with spirits of turpentine, in which it\r\nis soluble, applied by camel's-hair pencils. After separation they\r\nmay conveniently be examined by putting them into water, and gently\r\nshaking them so as to cause the parts to unfold. If endowed with the\r\npatience of Swammerdam, you may even arrive at injecting these minute\r\nparts with wax or coloured fluids, conveyed by delicate glass tubes\r\nhaving one end as fine as a hair, which he also employed to fill\r\nthe viscera with air; and afterwards drying them in the shade, and\r\nanointing them with oil of spike in which a little resin had been\r\ndissolved, he succeeded in preserving them. If it is not convenient\r\nto finish the dissection of an insect at once, it should be covered\r\nwith spirits of wine. Swammerdam found a mixture of spirits and\r\ndistilled vinegar very useful for keeping caterpillars previously to\r\ndissecting them, as it consolidated the parts[917].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now having brought to a close my long wanderings in this ample\r\nand intricate field, and having threaded, as well as my slender\r\npowers and limited knowledge enabled me, the infinite turnings\r\nand convolutions of this Dædalean labyrinth--the _Anatomy_ and\r\n_Physiology_ of insects,--will you not own that the volume of wonders\r\nI have laid before you proves irrefragably that, though these minims\r\nof nature apparently rank so low in the scale of being, yet in their\r\nstructure, instead of being, as might be expected, more simple,\r\nthey are infinitely more complex and highly wrought than those\r\nanimals that are placed the nearest to ourselves? the CREATOR in the\r\nlatter doing every thing by a beautiful _simplicity_; while in the\r\nformer, the more to magnify his power and skill, because they afford\r\nno apparent space for it, by a wonderfully curious and intricate\r\n_multiplicity_: and whether we study the one or the other, we shall\r\nin both trace the footsteps of that adorable LOVE which has shown\r\nattention to the comfort and well-being of the lowest insect, as well\r\nas of the highest of his creatures.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[801] VOL.

That they have their diseases is certain; but,\r\nexcept in the case of their appropriate parasitic assailants, which\r\nis a part of their economy, it does not appear that their maladies\r\nare more numerous and frequent than those of other animals. The\r\nsame ALMIGHTY POWER which endowed them with so complex a structure,\r\ngenerally upholds them in health during their destined career, until\r\nthey have fulfilled the purpose of their creation, when _they die and\r\nreturn again to their dust_[918].\r\n\r\nBut perhaps I may seem to you as making too great a parade about\r\nthese little insignificant creatures if I assign a separate letter\r\nto the consideration of their _diseases_: but when you recollect\r\nthat Aristotle has a chapter on this subject[919], and that the\r\nlearned Willdenow has devoted a distinct portion of his excellent\r\nintroductory work on Botany to the diseases of Plants[920],--you will\r\nperhaps be of a different mind: indeed, some facts I shall have to\r\ncommunicate are so remarkable and interesting, that I am sure, when\r\nyou have read this letter, you will not think the subject one that\r\ndeserves to be slighted.\r\n\r\nInsect diseases may, I think, be divided into two great classes;\r\nthose resulting, namely, from some accidental _external_ injury or\r\n_internal_ derangement, and those produced by _parasitic_ assailants.\r\n\r\nI. Under the _first_ head we may begin with _wounds_, _fractures_,\r\n_mutilations_, and other _extraneous_ causes of disease. To\r\nthese--insects are peculiarly subject; and though they are not, like\r\nthe _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_[921] and some other invertebrate\r\nanimals, endowed with the power of _reproducing_ a mutilated limb,\r\nyet their wounds appear to heal very rapidly, and at the time they\r\nare inflicted to produce little pain[922]. But if those important\r\nmembers, their _antennæ_, are mutilated, insects seem to suffer a\r\nkind of derangement; the great organ of their communication with\r\neach other, and in various respects with the external world, being\r\nremoved, all their instincts at once fail them. I formerly related\r\nhow the amputation of these affects the _queen-bee_[923]. A similar\r\nresult, as Huber tells us[924], follows, when the same experiment is\r\nrepeated on the _workers_ or _drones_: they immediately become unable\r\nto take any further part in the labours of the hive; they can no longer\r\nguide themselves except in the light; if they petition one of their\r\nfellow-citizens for honey, they are unable to direct their tongue to\r\nits mouth to receive it; they remain near the entrance of the hive, and\r\nwhen the light is intercepted they rush out of it to return no more.\r\n\r\nInsects occasionally are subject to _tumours_ or a preternatural\r\nenlargement of their parts and organs. The antennæ of bees sometimes\r\nswell at their extremity so as to resemble the bud of a flower ready\r\nto open, becoming at the same time very yellow, as does the fore part\r\nof the head[925]. I once saw a specimen of a _Hydrobius_--agreeing\r\nwith _H. fuscipes_ in every other respect even to the most minute\r\npunctum--which had a large tumour on each side of the _prothorax_,\r\nevidently accidental, occasioned probably by the stoppage of the\r\npores by which the superfluous moisture and air escape when it\r\nundergoes its last change. The converse of this I have observed to\r\ntake place sometimes in the same part of _Geotrupes foveatus_, the\r\nordinary lateral _foveæ_ becoming very considerably enlarged;--this\r\nwas the case with the specimen from which Mr. Marsham made his\r\ndescription of that insect. The species is, however, very distinct in\r\nother respects, and may always be known by its small size. It happens\r\nnow and then also, that these tumours represent _blisters_. I saw\r\none once on one elytrum of a beetle and not on the other. Those of\r\n_Serropalpus_ (as Mr. MacLeay, on the authority of M. Clairville,\r\ninforms me) are particularly subject to this disease. But, of all\r\nthe organs, the wings are most exposed to derangements of this kind.\r\nDe Geer, in a specimen of _Pieris Cratægi_ just excluded from the\r\nchrysalis, observed that one of these was distended by a considerable\r\nquantity of extravasated green fluid--two or three large drops\r\nfollowing an incision. This disease appeared to arise from the lower\r\nmembrane not adhering to the upper; so that the nervures--which are\r\nrather longitudinal channels, being open below, than tubes--were\r\nnot closed to confine the fluid to its proper course. The malady,\r\nwhich might be called a dropsy of the wing, carried off the insect\r\nthe day after its exclusion[926]. Reaumur observed that the wings of\r\nsome flies were affected by an _air_-dropsy, as he calls it, which\r\nappeared to arise from the air escaping from its natural channels,\r\nand thus separating, the two membranes that form the wing, and\r\nfilling the cavity produced by their separation[927].\r\n\r\nSometimes also _monstrosities_ are to be met with in these animals,\r\nor variations from a symmetrical structure in organs that are pairs.\r\nI have a beetle in which the terminal joint of one of the maxillary\r\npalpi is short, ovate, and acute; and that of the other, long,\r\nsemiovate, and rather obtuse. A specimen of _Blaps mortisaga_ in\r\nmy cabinet, taken by Mr. Denny, besides the terminal mucro of the\r\n_elytra_, has a long diverging lateral one. Goeze had the larva\r\nof a _Semblis_ brought to him in which one of the two fore-legs,\r\nthough perfect in all its parts, was only half the length of the\r\nother[928]; which he regarded as a reproduction, but it seems rather\r\na malformation. Müller mentions a most extraordinary fact of one of\r\nthe _Noctuidæ_, which when disclosed from the pupa retained the head\r\nof the larva[929]. One of the most remarkable instances of this kind\r\nthat have fallen under my own observation, may be seen in a specimen\r\nof _Chrysomela hæmoptera_ in the cabinet of our friend Curtis; in\r\nwhich one of the thighs produces a double tibia, but only one of\r\nthese is furnished with a tarsus.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of insects which arise from some _internal_ cause are\r\nnot very numerous. The first that I shall mention is a kind of\r\n_vertigo_. \"Ants have also their maladies,\" says M. P. Huber: \"I\r\nhave noticed one extremely singular; the individuals attacked by it\r\nlose their power of guiding themselves in a straight line, they can\r\nwalk only by turning round in a circle of small diameter and always\r\nin the same direction. A virgin female shut up in one of my glasses\r\nwas seized on a sudden with this distemper; she described a circle\r\nof an inch in diameter, and made about a thousand turns in an hour,\r\nor not quite seventeen in a minute. She continued constantly turning\r\nround for seven days, and when I visited her in the night I found\r\nher still in motion. I gave her honey--and I think that she ate some\r\nof it.\" He observed that some workers were attacked by a similar\r\ndisease: one of these, however, had the power of walking from time\r\nto time in a straight line; when placed upon its head it continued\r\nits gyrations[930]. Similar motions of a little moth, mentioned on\r\na former occasion[931], may perhaps have been produced by the same\r\ncause. Bees are also subject to vertigo, which has been attributed\r\nto their eating poisonous honey[932]--but may not this disease in all\r\nthese cases arise from some derangement of the nervous system? One\r\nof the ants which was so affected had lost one of its antennæ; but\r\nas this was not the case with the others, no great stress is to be\r\nlaid upon the circumstance. Huber does not inform us whether those\r\nattacked by this disease recovered or not.\r\n\r\nI have observed more than once, that the _flesh-fly_ and some others\r\nof the same tribe are subject in particular seasons to a kind of\r\n_convulsions_. When thus attacked, they kick and struggle, and seem\r\nunable to fly. Sometimes they lie upon their backs without motion,\r\nbut if a finger be placed near them their convulsive motions are\r\nrenewed. When thrown into the air, instead of flying, they fall to\r\nthe ground. Had this distemper occurred earlier or later in the year\r\nI should have attributed it to the benumbing effects of cold; but as\r\nmy observations were made one year (1816) in _May_, and in another\r\n(1811) in the latter end of _June_, this could scarcely be the case.\r\nIn the year last mentioned I observed that many flies died under its\r\ninfluence. In wet seasons this tribe is subject to another disease,\r\nwhich proves fatal to many of them, and indeed to other _Diptera_.\r\nA white crust appears to be formed upon the abdomen both above and\r\nbelow, of a granular appearance, much resembling fine moist sugar.\r\nOn the back of that part this crust does not cover the margins of\r\nthe segments, which gives it the appearance of white bands; so\r\nthat deceived by it, I have often at first flattered myself that I\r\nhad met with some new species. The under-side of the abdomen is\r\nwholly covered by it, divided in the middle into two longitudinal\r\nmasses, the anal segment being bare. De Geer has noticed this or\r\na similar disease, which, when flies are attacked by it, causes\r\nthe abdomen to swell so as even to burst, and the segments become\r\ndislocated. Upon opening the abdomen it is found filled with a white\r\nunctuous substance, which often accumulates (as above described)\r\non its external surface[933]. Dr. Host says that in this disease\r\nwhen the animal is dead, the wings, which were before incumbent,\r\nbecome extended, and its almost invisible pubescence grows into long\r\nhairs[934]. De Geer seems to think that these flies are thus affected\r\nin consequence of having eaten some poisonous food[935]; but I rather\r\nsuspect, as I have observed it become prevalent chiefly in wet\r\nseasons, that it arises from a superabundance of the nutritive fluid,\r\nor of the fat, so that it seems to be a kind of _plethora_. I once\r\nobserved a fly fixed to a pane of glass, round which was a semicircle\r\nof what appeared to be merely vapour, whose radius was nearly\r\nthree-fourths of an inch. Taking it for an aqueous fluid that had\r\ntranspired from the dead animal, I paid no further attention to it at\r\nthat time: but observing from day to day that the moisture did not\r\nevaporate, after two or three months had elapsed, I had the curiosity\r\nto examine it more closely, and, upon scraping some of it off with a\r\npenknife, I found it was a white substance of a fatty nature. In this\r\ncase, then, the fat must have exploded on all sides with considerable\r\nviolence from half the body or the abdomen. Probably this was a more\r\nintense degree of plethora. When I examined this appearance the fly\r\nhad fallen off, and I could not find it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheppard once brought me a panicle of grass, the glumes of which\r\nwere rough with hairs, or small bristles, to which several specimens\r\nof a fly related to _Xylota pipiens_ adhered by their proboscis.\r\nAt first I thought that having been entrapped by the bristles, and\r\nunable to extricate themselves, they had perished from want of food;\r\nbut since when touched they readily dropped from the glumes, some\r\nother cause, perhaps disease, probably occasioned this singular\r\nsuspension of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe maladies to which _bees_ and _silkworms_ are subject are more\r\ninteresting to us than those of _flies_, on account of their utility\r\nas _cultivated_ insects. One of the worst distempers which attacks\r\nthe first of these animals is a kind of _looseness_ or _dysentery_:\r\nthis happens early in the year, when they are fed with too much honey\r\nwithout any portion of bee-bread[936], and sometimes destroys whole\r\nhives. Their excrements, instead of a yellowish red, then become\r\nblack, and the odour they emit is insupportable; the bees no longer\r\nobserve their usual neatness, inducing them to leave the hive when\r\nthey void their excrements, but they defile it, their cells, and each\r\nother. Several remedies have been prescribed for this disease. To\r\nprevent it, a syrup made by an equal mixture of good wine and honey\r\nis recommended; and as a cure, to place in the hive combs containing\r\ncells filled with bee-bread[937]. But one of the worst maladies to\r\nwhich these useful animals are subject, is that called by Schirach\r\n_Faux Couvain_. It originates with the larvæ; and is caused either\r\nby their being fed with unwholesome food, or when the queen, as\r\nsometimes happens, lays her eggs so that the head of the grub is not\r\nin a proper position for emerging from the cell when the period for\r\nits disclosure is arrived:--the consequence is, that in both cases it\r\ndies and becomes putrid, which sometimes produces a real pestilence\r\nin a hive. The remedy for this evil is to cut away the infected\r\ncombs, and to make the bees undergo a fast of two days[938]. The hive\r\nshould be cleaned and fumigated, by burning under it aromatic plants.\r\n\r\nThe cultivators of the _silkworm_ in France have given names to\r\nseveral diseases to which that animal is subject. One is called _La\r\nRouge_, and is supposed to be occasioned either by too great heat,\r\nor by too sudden a transition from cold to heat. It takes place\r\nwhen the caterpillar is first hatched; which lives perhaps, but in\r\na very sickly state, till it should spin its cocoon and assume the\r\npupa, when it expires. Another degree of the same disease is called\r\n_Les Harpions_ or _Passis_. A second distemper of this animal is\r\n_Des Vaches_, _Le Gras_ or _La Saune_: this is a mortal disease,\r\nsupposed to be of a putrid nature, and produced by mephitic air; it\r\nshows itself after the second moult, but rarely after the subsequent\r\nones. When a caterpillar is first attacked, changing the air may\r\nprove a remedy; but when the disease has made progress, it is best\r\nto burn or bury them, since if the poultry pick them up they might\r\nbe poisoned by them. A third disease of silkworms is called _Les\r\nMorts Blancs_, or _Tripes_, which is also occasioned by impure air,\r\nwhen the leaves the animal feeds upon are heaped so as to produce\r\nfermentation. The caterpillars attacked by it die suddenly, and\r\npreserve after their death the semblance of life and health. Too\r\ngreat heat, whether artificial or natural, occasions _La Touffe_, a\r\nfourth, which, when the heat continues long, destroys all those that\r\nare arrived at their last stage of existence in their larva state.\r\nBlack points scattered over different parts of the body, or livid\r\nand blackish spots in the vicinity of the spiracles, followed by a\r\nyellowish or reddish tint, are symptoms of a fifth malady, called _La\r\nMuscardine_. After this the animal soon dies, and becomes mouldy, but\r\ndoes not stink. This disease is not contagious, and is thought to\r\nbe caused by a moist heat, attended by pernicious exhalations. _La\r\nLuzette_, _Luisette_, or _Clairène_, is another malady, which shows\r\nitself most commonly after the _fourth_ moult. It seems to arise from\r\nsome original defect in the _egg_. The caterpillars attacked by it\r\nmay be known by their clear red and afterwards dirty white colour;\r\ntheir body becomes transparent, and the matter of silk exudes in\r\ndrops from their spinnerets; consequently, though as voracious as\r\nthe rest, they are never able to construct a cocoon, and should be\r\ndestroyed. _Les Dragées_ is the name given to cocoons which include\r\na larva that never becomes a pupa. The cause of this disorder has\r\nnot been ascertained, and whole broods are sometimes subject to it,\r\nwhich, as in the last, seems to imply some defect in the _eggs_.\r\nBut as the caterpillar spins its cocoon, and the silk is as good as\r\nusual, it is a malady of no great importance. Lastly, sometimes the\r\nmulberry leaves have a gummy rather acrid secretion, which purges the\r\nsilkworms; their excrement is no longer solid; they become weak and\r\nlanguid; and if the secretion is abundant, their transpiration is\r\nimpeded, and at the time of moulting they are become so feeble as to\r\nbe unable to cast their skin[939].\r\n\r\nIn the case of many caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_ that died, Bonnet\r\nfound by dissection that the disease was remotely occasioned by a\r\n_diarrhea_, which taking place immediately before they became pupæ,\r\nprevented the inner membrane of their intestines from being rejected,\r\nas it would have been if no extraordinary cause had prevented it,\r\nattached to the hard excrement. He found this membrane converted into\r\na jelly occupying great part of the stomach, which he conjectured was\r\nthe proximate cause of their death[940].\r\n\r\nTo conclude this head--_spiders_ are reputed to be subject to the\r\n_stone_: I do not say _Calculus in Vesica_; but we are informed by\r\nLesser that Dr. John Franck having shut up fourteen spiders in a\r\nglass with some valerian root, one of them voided an ash-coloured\r\ncalculus with small black dots[941].\r\n\r\nII. I now come to that class of diseases which appears to prevail\r\nalmost universally amongst insects--I mean those resulting from the\r\nattack of _parasitic_ enemies. Thus millions and millions annually\r\nperish before they have arrived at their perfect state. Diseases of\r\nthis kind proceed either from _vegetable_ or _animal_ parasites. I\r\nshall begin with the first, which will not occupy us long.\r\n\r\ni. As insects pass often no small portion of their life in a state\r\nof torpidity, in which they remain chiefly without motion, it\r\nwill not seem wonderful, should any partial moisture accidentally\r\naccumulate upon them, that it affords a seed plot for certain minute\r\nfungi to come up and grow in. Persoon observes with regard to his\r\ngenus _Isaria_, that one species grows upon the _larvæ_ of insects\r\n(_I. truncata_), and another upon _pupæ_ (_I. crassa_[942]):--as\r\nhe does not say upon _dead_ larvæ and pupæ, as upon a former\r\noccasion[943], perhaps in these cases these plants may constitute an\r\ninsect disease; but I lay no stress upon it, and only mention the\r\ncircumstance here as connected with the history of these animals. Mr.\r\nDickson has described a _Sphæria_ under the name of _entomorhiza_\r\nthat grows upon _dead_ larvæ; it has a slender long stipes and\r\nspherical granulated head: on the pupa of a species of _Cicada_ in my\r\ncabinet, another kind of _Sphæria_, with a twisted thickish stipes\r\nand oblong head, springs up in the space between the eyes. I observed\r\nsomething similar but longer, in the grub of some large beetle in\r\nM. Du Fresne's museum at Paris; and I have a memorandum of having\r\nnoticed something of the kind on the rostrum of a _Calandra_. Bees\r\nand humble-bees have been sometimes thought to have some species\r\nof _mucor_ or other _Fungilli_ occasionally growing upon them; but\r\nMr. Brown is of opinion that _stamina_ which they have filched\r\nfrom flowers have been mistaken for these _Fungilli_, since he has\r\ndetected those of _Orchideæ_ in some of this tribe, and upon a beetle\r\nshown to him by Mr. MacLeay, one which he knew to be the stamen of\r\nan _Aristolochia_. I once observed a bunch of what I mistook for a\r\nsingular _mucor_ that adorned the vertex of a humble-bee, between the\r\nantennæ, which doubtless were of the same description; and I even\r\nsaw one upon its wing. Upon a former occasion I mentioned a parallel\r\ncircumstance with respect to a species of _Xylocopa_[944].\r\n\r\nii. The _animal_ parasites that infest insects are either themselves\r\n_insects_; or _worms_.\r\n\r\n1. Their _insect_ infesters, as far as we know at present, are\r\nconfined to the Orders _Strepsiptera_, _Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_,\r\nand _Aptera_: they attack them sometimes in their _egg_ state, most\r\nfrequently when they are larvæ, occasionally when pupæ, and very\r\nrarely in their perfect state. Upon many of these I have formerly\r\nenlarged[945], and I shall now add such further circumstances as\r\nI then omitted. The _Strepsiptera_ Order, as at present known,\r\nconsists only of two genera, _Stylops_ and _Xenos_; the first being\r\nappropriated to the imago of _Andrena_, a kind of _bee_, and the\r\nlatter to that of the _wasps_. Their eggs appear to be deposited in\r\nthe abdomen of these insects in which they feed, till having attained\r\ntheir full growth they perforate the membrane that connects its\r\nsegments; and at the proper time their pupa-case bursts, they emerge,\r\nand take their flight. Sometimes four or five infest a single bee.\r\nWhether the latter dies upon their quitting it I have not been able\r\nto ascertain, but from their flying, when the little parasite is very\r\nnear leaving them, with their usual activity, it should seem that\r\nthis disease is not mortal; but it probably prevents their breeding:\r\nI do not recollect observing the exuviæ of one in a _male_ bee[946].\r\n\r\nThe great body of insect parasites, however, belong to the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ Order, and chiefly to the Linnean genus _Ichneumon_.\r\nThe insects of this order have been denominated _Principes_, because\r\nof the wonderful instincts of ants, wasps, bees, and other gregarious\r\ntribes that belong to it; and they merit a name of honour not less\r\nfor the benefits that they confer upon mankind, by keeping within\r\ntheir proper limits the various insect-destroyers of the produce of\r\nthe globe. It deserves notice that when these latter increase to a\r\ndegree to occasion alarm, their parasites are observed to increase\r\nin a much greater, so as to prevent the great majority of them from\r\nbreeding[947]. Though these benefactors of the human race constitute\r\nnumerous genera, at present not well ascertained, I shall speak of\r\nmost of them under the common name of _Ichneumon_.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of these little four-winged flies puzzled much the\r\nearlier naturalists:--that a caterpillar usually turning to a\r\n_moth_ or _butterfly_ should give birth to myriads of _flies_, was\r\none of those deep mysteries of nature which they knew not how to\r\nfathom[948]: even the penetrating genius of our great Ray, though he\r\nultimately ascertained the real fact[949], was at one time here quite\r\nat fault; for he seems at first to have thought, when from any defect\r\nor weakness nature could not bring a caterpillar to a butterfly, in\r\norder that her aim might not be entirely defeated, that she stopped\r\nshort, and formed them into more imperfect animals[950].\r\n\r\nBefore I detail more particularly the proceedings of Ichneumons, I\r\nshall make a few general remarks upon them. The structure of the\r\ninstrument by which they are enabled to deposit their eggs in their\r\nappropriate station has been before sufficiently described[951]; it\r\nis long or short according to the situation and circumstances of the\r\nlarva which receives them: if this lives in the open air, and the\r\naccess to it is easy, it is usually _short_ and retracted within the\r\nbody; but if it lies concealed in deep holes or cavities, or shuns\r\nall approach, it is often very long. Thus in _Pimpla Manifestator_,\r\nwhich commits its eggs to the grub of a wild bee inhabiting the bottom\r\nof deep holes bored in posts and rails, the ovipositor is nearly an\r\ninch and half in length, and in some extra-European species three\r\ninches. How the egg is propelled so as to pass in safety from the\r\noviduct, along this extended and very slender instrument to the grub\r\nfor which it is destined, has not been certainly ascertained: but from\r\nan observation of Reaumur's[952] it should seem that it is aided in\r\nits passage by some fluid ejected at the same time with it, or is so\r\nlubricated as to slide easily without being displaced. The flies we are\r\nspeaking of, by some authors are called _Muscæ vibrantes_, because when\r\nsearching for the destined nidus of their eggs their antennæ vibrate\r\nincessantly, and it is by the use of these wonderful organs that they\r\ndiscover it wherever it lurks. Bergman observed that _Fœnus Jaculator_\r\nsearches for the latent grub of certain bees and other _Hymenoptera_\r\nwith its antennæ[953]: and from Mr. Marsham we learn that _Pimpla\r\nManifestator_, before it inserts its ovipositor in the nest of the grub\r\nof _Chelostoma maxillosa_, explores it first with one antenna and then\r\nwith the other, plunging them all the while intensely quivering up\r\nto the very root[954]. With respect to their _size_, Ichneumons vary\r\ngreatly; some being so extremely minute as to be invisible to the naked\r\neye, unless moving upon glass; while others, as to their _length_,\r\nemulate the giants amongst insects. The former, unless appropriated\r\nto the eggs themselves, usually commit many eggs to a single larva,\r\nwhile the latter are directed by their instinct to introduce into\r\nthem only one. Some of the former description are endowed with the\r\nfaculty of leaping[955]. The food of Ichneumons, and indeed of other\r\ninternal parasites, is chiefly the _epiploon_ or fat of the larva, but\r\nthey never touch any vital organ; so that it continues to feed, and\r\nprobably more voraciously, grow, cast its skin, and often it changes to\r\na chrysalis, although at the same time inhabited by an army of these\r\nlittle devourers.\r\n\r\nIchneumons, as far as has been at present ascertained, are parasitic\r\nupon other insects chiefly in their _three_ first states, a solitary\r\ninstance only having been observed of their inhabiting an _imago_;\r\nbut from their first exclusion as eggs from the ovary till their\r\nassumption of that state they give them no rest. I shall therefore\r\nfirst treat of those that infest the _eggs_; next those appropriated\r\nto _larvæ_; and lastly those that devour _pupæ_.\r\n\r\nVallisnieri appears to have been the first naturalist who discovered\r\nthat Ichneumons were appropriated to the _eggs_ of other insects.\r\nHe observed one proceed from those of the emperor-moth (_Saturnia\r\nSpini_): finding two holes in each egg, one larger than the other,\r\nhe conjectured that one was made when it entered, and the other when\r\nit emerged. In this case the egg of the Ichneumon must be fixed on\r\nthe outside of the egg it was to feed upon; though some appear\r\nto pierce it with their ovipositor, and consequently introduce\r\ntheir egg within: for he says afterwards; \"I have seen with my own\r\neyes a certain kind of wild flies deposit their eggs _upon_ other\r\neggs, and _bore_ and pierce others with an aculeus--by which they\r\nhave introduced the egg[956].\" Count Zinanni, a correspondent of\r\nReaumur's, saw an Ichneumon pierce the eggs with her ovipositor\r\nrepeatedly; which in about fifteen days were filled with the pupa,\r\nand in six more produced the imago[957]. _I. Ovulorum_ L. is the\r\nonly _known_ species of egg-devourers; but most likely there are\r\nmany, varying in size, according to the size of the egg they\r\ninhabit. Probably _I. Atomus_ L., and _I. Punctum_ Shaw, are of this\r\ndescription[958]. It is wonderful what a number these little flies\r\ndestroy:--out of a mass of more than _sixty_ eggs which was brought\r\nto De Geer, not _one_ had escaped the Ichneumon[959]. But the most\r\nextraordinary thing is, that even these little creatures we are told\r\nare destroyed by another still more minute[960].\r\n\r\nThough the animals we are speaking of usually destroy only a _single_\r\negg, yet some appear not so to confine themselves. Geoffrey informs\r\nus that the larva of one of the Ichneumons whose females are without\r\nwings (_Cryptus_) devours the eggs of the nests of spiders, and from\r\nits size--it is nearly a quarter of an inch long--it must require\r\nseveral of them to bring it to maturity[961]. One of those also\r\nwhich destroys the gnat infesting the wheat (_I. inserens_) appears\r\nto devour them in their _egg_ state, and could not be brought to\r\nperfection by the food that a single one would furnish[962].\r\n\r\nThe Ichneumons that are parasitic upon _larvæ_ are the most numerous\r\nof all. Some of them are deposited by the parent fly on the _outside_\r\nof their prey, and others introduced into its _interior_. _Ophion\r\nluteum_ is one of the former tribe; it plants its eggs in the skin\r\nof the caterpillar of the puss-moth (_Cerura Vinula_). Each egg\r\nis furnished with a footstalk terminating in a bulb[963], which\r\nis so deeply and firmly fixed that it is impossible to extract it\r\nwithout detaching a portion of the animal with it, and even when\r\nthe caterpillar changes its skin it is not displaced. After it is\r\nhatched, the grub, while feeding, keeps its posterior extremity in\r\nthe egg-shell, to which it adheres so pertinaciously, that it is\r\nscarcely possible to disengage it without crushing it. It fixes\r\nitself by its mandibles to the skin of the caterpillar, and keeps\r\nconstantly sucking the contents of its body till it dies: sometimes\r\nnine or ten of these larvæ inhabit a single caterpillar[964].\r\nReaumur has given an account of other external Ichneumons. Upon one\r\ncaterpillar that he examined, they were so numerous as to render the\r\npoor animal quite a spectacle, and they underwent their metamorphosis\r\nattached to it[965]. One species of this description avenges the\r\ncause of insects upon their most pitiless foes, the all-devouring\r\nspider--for in the midst of her toils and lines of circumvallation it\r\nmakes her its prey. De Geer, meeting one day with a young spider of a\r\ncommon kind, observed with surprise, engaged in sucking it, a small\r\nwhite grub, which was firmly attached to the abdomen near the trunk.\r\nPutting it by in a glass, after some days he examined it again;\r\nwhen he observed that it had spun the outline of a vertical web, had\r\nstretched threads from the top to the bottom of the glass and from\r\none side to the other, and had also spun the radii that meet in the\r\ncentre, and this was all;--but what was remarkable, the larva that\r\nhad fed upon it was suspended in the centre of this web, where it\r\nwas engaged in spinning its own cocoon, while the spider, exhausted\r\nby this last effort, had fallen dead to the bottom of the glass. It\r\ncannot be asserted positively that this suspension of the larva of\r\nthe Ichneumon in the centre of the web _always_ takes place; but if\r\nit does, as seems most probable, it shows that this little parasite\r\nis endowed with an instinct which causes it so to act upon the spider\r\nas may induce it to spin a web so nicely timed as to be sufficiently\r\ncomplete at the period of its death and of the change of the\r\nIchneumon, for the latter to cast it down and assume its station[966].\r\n\r\nBut the great bulk of the parasitic Hymenopterous devourers of larvæ\r\nhave their assigned station _within_ the body. As Entomologists in\r\nbreeding insects have paid their principal attention to _Lepidoptera_,\r\nit necessarily follows that their Ichneumon infesters must be most\r\ngenerally known; but doubtless the larvæ of the other Orders are not\r\nwholly liberated from this scourge: they also require to be kept within\r\ndue limits, and have their appropriate parasites. Some, however, in\r\nmost of them have been detected: of which I shall now proceed to state\r\nto you the most interesting examples, beginning with the _Coleoptera_.\r\n\r\n_Alysia Manducator_[967], remarkable for having mandibulæ that do\r\nnot close, and toothed at the end, usually attends masses of dung,\r\nboth of man and cattle, probably for the purpose of depositing\r\nits eggs in some of the _Coleopterous_ larvæ that inhabit it. Mr.\r\nStephens, one of the most accurate observers as well as one of the\r\nbest Entomologists of the present day, informs me that he once\r\ncaptured three specimens of _Timarcha tenebricosa_, from each of\r\nwhich forty or fifty minute Ichneumons emerged. An insect also of\r\nthis Order, that is a great benefactor to mankind, as a destroyer\r\nof the plant-lice,--I mean the lady-bird (_Coccinella_), in its\r\nlarva state is itself subject to the attack, as we learn from De\r\nGeer, of one of these small parasites[968]. He detected them also\r\nin that of two species of weevils: and in the pupa of some large\r\ngrub of a beetle inhabiting the wood of the elm, perhaps that of the\r\nstag-beetle, he found the pupa of one of those Ichneumons that have\r\nan exserted ovipositor[969]. Doubtless, did we know their history, we\r\nshould find that numberless species have their internal assailants\r\nbelonging to this tribe.\r\n\r\n_Orthopterous_ larvæ seem not to have been yet announced as affording\r\na pabulum to these animals: but the late Dr. Arnold, whose tact\r\nfor observation with regard to the manners and economy of insects\r\nhas rendered his loss irreparable, discovered that the remarkable\r\nparasitic genus _Evania_ was appropriated to the all-devouring\r\n_Blatta_. Whether it attacked it in its egg or larva state I have\r\nnot been informed. This little benefactor is here extremely rare,\r\nat least in the _country_; perhaps in _towns_, where the cock-roach\r\nabounds, it may be more common.\r\n\r\nThe observations of naturalists have chiefly been confined to the\r\n_Hemipterous_ genus _Aphis_; but these early attracted their notice.\r\nLeeuwenhoek has given a particular and entertaining account of the\r\nproceedings of _I. Aphidum_. As soon as the little flies approached\r\ntheir prey, they bent their abdomen, which is rather long, between\r\ntheir legs, so that the anus projected beyond the head; then with\r\ntheir ovipositor they pierced the body of the Aphis, at the same time\r\ncarefully avoiding all contact with it in every other part: whenever\r\nthey succeeded in their attempt, a tremulous motion of the abdomen\r\nsucceeded. Only a single egg is committed to one Aphis: when hatched,\r\nthe latter becomes very smooth and appears swelled; it is, however,\r\nfull of life, and moves when touched. Those that are thus pricked\r\nseparate themselves from their sound companions, and take their\r\nstation on the _underside_ of a leaf. After some days the inclosed\r\ngrub pierces the belly of the Aphis, and attaches the margin of the\r\norifice to the leaf by silken threads; upon this it dies, becomes\r\nwhite, and resembles a brilliant bead or pearl[970]. De Geer observed\r\nalso an Ichneumon on the Coccus of the elm, _I. Coccorum_[971].\r\n\r\nAmongst the _Neuropterous_ tribes likewise, probably the _Ichneumonidæ_\r\ncommit their usual ravages; but their exploits, as far as I recollect,\r\nhave met with no historian. I have a small species related to\r\n_Chelonus_, which a memorandum made when I took it tells me was\r\nobtained from _Æshna viatica_; yet I do not remember ever tracing that\r\nspecies to its final change, so that I must have taken this Ichneumon\r\nfrom the _perfect insect_. It suffices, however, to prove that this\r\ntribe is also exposed to the attack of these parasites. Where larvæ\r\nand pupæ are _aquatic_, it seems probable, if any attack is made upon\r\nthem, that it must take place after they have quitted the water.\r\n\r\nIn the _Hymenoptera_ Order itself, almost every genus has been\r\nascertained to have its Ichneumon parasites. Not even the fortified\r\nhabitations of the gall-flies (_Cynips_) can escape them, almost\r\nevery species becoming their prey; a circumstance which puzzled\r\nnot a little some of the older naturalists, when they at one time\r\nsaw a fly not remarkable for its colours or brilliancy emerge from\r\nthe curious moss-like _Bedeguar_ of the wild rose, and at another\r\nwere struck by the appearance of one of those splendid minims of\r\nnature which almost dazzle the sight of the beholder[972]. Immunity,\r\nhowever, from this pest seems to have been granted to the _gregarious\r\nHymenoptera_; at least none has yet been discovered to attack the\r\nant, the wasp, the humble-bee, or the hive-bee; in which last, had\r\nthere been one appropriated to it, it could never have escaped the\r\nnotice of the Reaumurs and the Hubers. The _solitary_ bees, however,\r\nas we have seen above[973], do not escape; and _Epipona spinipes_,\r\na _solitary_ wasp which feeds its own young with a number of green\r\ncaterpillars[974], is itself, when a larva, though concealed in a\r\ndeep burrow, the prey of the grub of an Ichneumon, which by means\r\nof a long ovipositor introduces its egg into its body[975]. Even\r\nthese parasites, whose universal office it is in their first state\r\nto prey upon insects, are themselves subject to the same malady.\r\nIchneumonidan devourers are kept in check by other Ichneumonidan\r\ndevourers. These in some cases are so numerous as to destroy the\r\ntithe of the kinds they attack[976]. Thus an ever-watchful PROVIDENCE\r\nprevents these parasites from becoming so numerous as to annihilate\r\nin any place the species necessary for the maintenance of the general\r\neconomy and proportion of animal and vegetable productions. Amongst\r\nthe assailants of the _Hymenoptera_, none seem to have a more\r\nlaborious task assigned them than those that pierce the various galls\r\nin which the larvæ of the _Cynips_ tribe are inclosed. To look at an\r\noak-apple, we should think it a work of difficulty, requiring much\r\nsagacity and address, for one of our little flies to discover the\r\nseveral chambers lurking in its womb, and to direct their ovipositor\r\nto each of them. Its CREATOR, however, has enabled it instinctively\r\nto discover this, and furnished it with an appropriate elongated\r\ninstrument, which will open a way to the deep and hidden cells in\r\nwhich the grubs reside, penetrate their bodies, and to each commit\r\nan egg. When it prepares to perforate the gall, the Ichneumon begins\r\nby depressing this organ, that it may extricate it from its sheath;\r\nit next elevates its body as high as possible, and bending the\r\ninstrument till it becomes perpendicular to the body and to the gall,\r\nso as to touch the latter with its point, it then gradually plunges\r\nit in, till it is quite buried[977]. A very remarkable Hymenopterous\r\nparasite (_Leucospis_), which when unemployed turns its ovipositor\r\nover the back of its abdomen, so that its end points to its head, is\r\nsaid to deposit its eggs in the nest of the mason-bee, most probably\r\nin the larva: but the curious observations that are stated to have\r\nbeen made by M. Amédée Lepelletier upon its history have not yet\r\nbeen given to the public[978].\r\n\r\n_Dipterous_ insects, likewise, do not escape from these pests of\r\ntheir Class: but few observations, however, have been recorded as\r\nto the species assailed by them. We learn from De Geer, that a\r\ngnat (_Cecidomyia Juniperi_), which forms galls upon the juniper\r\nis devoured by an external Ichneumon[979]; that which injures the\r\nwheat in the ear, whose ravages I formerly mentioned to you[980],\r\naffords food to three of these parasites,--one I lately mentioned\r\nas probably devouring its eggs; another pierces the glumes of the\r\nfloret, where its destined prey is concealed; and the third enters\r\nit. I once placed a number of the larvæ of the gnat upon a sheet of\r\npaper, at no great distance from each other, and then set down one\r\nof these last Ichneumons in the midst of them. She began immediately\r\nto pace about, vibrating her antennæ very briskly: a larva was soon\r\ndiscovered, upon which she fixed herself, the motion of her antennæ\r\nincreasing intensely; then bending her abdomen obliquely under her\r\nbreast, she inserted her ovipositor, and while the egg was depositing\r\nthese organs became perfectly motionless. The larva when pricked gave\r\na violent wriggle. This operation was repeated with all that had not\r\nalready received an egg, for only one is committed to each larva. I\r\nhave often seen it mount one that was already pricked, but it soon\r\ndiscovered its mistake, and quitted it untouched[981]. The Hessian\r\nFly also (_Cecidomyia Destructor_) related to the preceding, whose\r\nalarming ravages I formerly described to you[982], has a peculiar\r\nparasite attached to it, which keeps it in check. The only other\r\nDipterous insects that I have seen mentioned as affording pabulum\r\nto an Ichneumon, are--one of the aphidivorous flies mentioned by\r\nDe Geer, who does not note the species, to the larva of which the\r\nIchneumon commits only a single egg, producing a grub that intirely\r\ndevours its interior[983];--and two described by Scopoli, one, the\r\nlarva of a _fly_ frequenting hemp; and the other, which feeds on a\r\n_Boletus_, that of a _gnat_[984].\r\n\r\nThe _Lepidoptera_, however, is the Order over the larvæ of which the\r\nIchneumons reign with undisputed sway; attacking all indiscriminately,\r\nfrom the minute one that forms its labyrinth within the thickness of\r\na leaf, to the giant caterpillar of the hawk-moth. The most useful\r\nof all, however, the silkworm, appears at least with us, exempted\r\nfrom this scourge. De Geer, out of fifteen larvæ that were mining\r\nbetween the two cuticles of a rose-leaf, belonging to the first tribe\r\nhere alluded to, found that _fourteen_ were destroyed by one of\r\nthese parasites, only one coming forth to display itself in all its\r\nbrilliancy and miniature magnificence[985]. One of the most useful to\r\nus is that which destroys the clothes-moth, which the same writer also\r\ntraced[986]. Another, equally serviceable, takes up its abode in the\r\ncaterpillar that ravages our cabbages and brocoli (_Pontia Brassicæ_)\r\nwhich perish by hundreds from its attacks. As this falls frequently\r\nunder our notice, it will not be uninteresting to give a fuller account\r\nof it. Reaumur has traced and related its whole history. One of these\r\nlittle flies that he observed, was so intent upon the business in which\r\nshe was engaged, that she suffered him to watch her motions under a\r\nlens, without being discomposed. She pursued nearly the same plan of\r\nproceeding with that of the Ichneumon of the wheat-gnat just described;\r\nexcept that she repeated her operations frequently on the same\r\ncaterpillar in different parts, alternately plunging in and extracting\r\nher ovipositor. She seemed to prefer the spot where the segments of the\r\nbody are united, particularly where the eighth meets the ninth, and the\r\nninth the tenth. When the fly had completed its work and quitted the\r\ncaterpillar, Reaumur gave it food, and it did not seem less lively and\r\nvigorous than others of its kind; in less than a fortnight it assumed\r\nthe pupa; and in four days the whole of its interior being devoured,\r\nit died: but its parasites, perhaps not finding a sufficient supply of\r\nnutriment in it, never came to perfection[987]. Sometimes, however,\r\nthese little grubs arrive at maturity before the caterpillar has become\r\na chrysalis, when they pierce the skin and begin to emerge. First\r\nappears a little white tubercle, which gradually elevates itself in\r\na direction perpendicular to the body; while this is doing, a second\r\nappears in another place; and so on, till fifteen or sixteen are seen\r\non each side, giving the caterpillar a very grotesque appearance. By\r\nthe alternate contraction and relaxation of their bodies the grubs\r\neffect their complete liberation, which takes place with respect to\r\nthe whole in less than half an hour. When entirely disengaged, they\r\nplace themselves close to the sides of the caterpillar: even before\r\nthis they begin spinning, and draw unequal threads in different\r\ndirections, of which they form a cottony bed, which serves as the base\r\nof the separate cocoon of each individual, which they next construct\r\nof a beautiful silk thread of a lovely yellow, which, if it could be\r\nunwound and in sufficient quantity, would yield a silk unrivalled in\r\nlustre and fineness[988].\r\n\r\nDe Geer has recorded a very singular fact which deserves your notice.\r\nAn Ichneumon, appropriated to one of the _Tortrices_, had deposited\r\nits eggs in two of their caterpillars; each produced a considerable\r\nnumber; but those that emerged from one were all _females_, and\r\nthose from the other, _males_[989]. He observed a similar fact take\r\nplace with _Misocampus Puparum_[990]. One might conjecture from this\r\ncircumstance, that as in the queen-bee[991], so in these Ichneumons,\r\nthe eggs producing the two sexes were arranged separately in the\r\novaries. Reaumur has related, that in one instance three or four\r\nmales were produced to one female; and in another four or five\r\nfemales to one male[992].\r\n\r\nBut though the great majority of insects are subject to this\r\n_Scolechiasis_[993] in their larva state, yet sometimes they are not\r\nattacked by the _Ichneumon_ till they have become _pupæ_. Of this\r\nkind is one just mentioned (_M. Puparum_), which commits its eggs to\r\nthe chrysalis of the butterfly of the nettle, _Vanessa Urticæ_: the\r\nmoment this caterpillar quits its skin to assume that state, while it\r\nis yet soft they pierce it and confide to it their eggs[994]. De Geer\r\nand others have supposed that this same Ichneumon attacks the _Cocci_\r\nand _Coccinellæ_[995]; but this probably is an erroneous supposition.\r\n_Cryptus Compunctor_ also attacks the pupæ of butterflies[996].\r\n\r\nIf we consider the great purpose of PROVIDENCE in giving being\r\nto this tribe of destroyers--the keeping of insects within their\r\nproper limits,--we may readily conceive that this purpose is more\r\neffectually answered by destroying them in their _preparatory_\r\nthan in their _ultimate_ state, since at that time the laying\r\nof their eggs and a future progeny could not so effectually be\r\nprevented;--this will account for there being few or no Ichneumons\r\nappropriated to them in their latter state.\r\n\r\nThe next tribe of insect parasites are to be found in the _Diptera_\r\nOrder. The species that has been particularly noticed as such is\r\nthe _Tachina Larvarum_; its larva is polyphagous, laying its eggs\r\n_upon_ the bodies of caterpillars of different kinds. Sometimes a\r\npair is placed on the first segment, sometimes on the head itself,\r\nand sometimes near the anus. These eggs are very hard, convex, of an\r\noval figure, polished and shining like a mirror. They are fixed so\r\nfirmly that if you attempt to remove them with a penknife the skin\r\ncomes off with them. When hatched, they enter the body and feed on\r\nthe interior, and, undergoing their metamorphosis within it, do not\r\nemerge till they enter their perfect state. The caterpillar thus\r\nattacked lives long enough to spin its cocoon, when it dies[997].\r\nSometimes, however, these animals quit their prey sooner. Reaumur\r\nsaw a grub of one of the _Muscidæ_ come out of a caterpillar, and\r\nthen become a pupa, which was so large that he wondered how it could\r\nhave been contained in the animal it had quitted[998].\r\n\r\nWe have now done with those parasites that produce in insects the\r\ndisease I have called _Scolechiasis_[999]: the rest, which belong to\r\nthe _Aptera_ Order, will afford us examples both of _Phthiriasis_ and\r\n_Acariasis_[1000].\r\n\r\nI begin with the _first_. Mr. Sheppard once brought me a specimen\r\nof a bird-louse (_Nirmus_) which he took upon a butterfly (_Vanessa\r\nIo_): and should such a capture be more than once repeated, it would\r\nafford a _certain_ instance of the _first_ of these diseases amongst\r\ninsects;--but most probably the specimen in question had dropped from\r\nsome bird upon the butterfly. The only remaining animal belonging\r\nto the apterous hexapods that is parasitic on insects, is by many\r\nsupposed to be the larva of a giant-beetle (_Meloe Proscarabæus_). I\r\nhave before alluded to this animal[1001], and shall now resume the\r\nsubject. Gœdart, Frisch, and De Geer, observed that it deposited in\r\nthe earth one or two considerable masses, containing an infinite\r\nnumber of very minute orange-coloured eggs adhering to each other,\r\nwhich in about a month were hatched, and produced a number of small\r\nhexapods distinguished by two pairs of anal setæ and a proleg, by\r\nmeans of which they could move readily upon glass, as I have myself\r\nseen: these little animals precisely corresponded with one found by\r\nthe latter author upon _Eristalis intricarius_; and when that fly\r\nwas placed amongst them, they immediately attached themselves to\r\nit, so as to leave no doubt of their identity[1002]. A congenerous\r\nspecies had been detected upon wild bees, and described by Linné\r\nunder the name of _Pediculus Apis_. De Geer is so thoroughly to be\r\ndepended upon for his veracity and accuracy of observation, that we\r\ncannot suppose there is any incorrectness in his statement. If the\r\nmass of eggs be, as he represents it, of the size of a hazel-nut, it\r\nmust have been the product of a very large insect: in confirmation\r\nof this opinion it may be further observed, that the larva of the\r\nkindred genus _Cantharis_ agrees with it in having anal setæ, though\r\nit appears to differ in having only two conspicuous segments in the\r\ntrunk[1003]. Those which infest wild bees make their first appearance\r\nupon _acrid_ plants, which the _Meloe_ likewise feeds upon; from\r\nwhence with wonderful agility they leap upon the _Andrenæ_, &c.\r\nthat visit these flowers. Strong, however, as all these facts\r\nappear, still we cannot help exclaiming with the illustrious Swede\r\nlast named, Who could ever have imagined that the larva of this\r\ngreat _beetle_ would be found upon the body of _flies_,--and we\r\nmay add, or _bees_? Who could ever imagine that it would feed like\r\na _bird-louse_ and resemble it so closely? that in the insertion\r\nof its palpi it should exhibit a character _exclusively_ belonging\r\nto that tribe[1004]? Another circumstance seems to indicate that\r\nthese hexapods at the time that they take their station in bees or\r\nflies are perfect insects--they do not vary in size, at least not\r\nmaterially. Where, we may also ask, if they are to become large\r\nbeetles, where do they take their principal growth? It cannot be\r\nas parasites on the little bees or flies that they are usually\r\nfound upon; they must soon desert them, and like their kindred\r\nblister-beetles, as is most probable, have recourse to vegetable\r\nfood. What an anomaly _in rerum natura_! It is much to be wished that\r\nsome skilful insect-anatomist would carefully dissect the _Meloe_;\r\nor perhaps by digging round the roots of the ranunculuses and other\r\nacrid plants the larva of that beetle might be discovered in a later\r\nstage of growth, and so this mystery be cleared up. I should observe\r\nhere, that Scopoli has described three parasites as _Pediculi_; viz.\r\n_P. rostratus_, _coccineus_, and _Cerambycinus_; the first of which\r\nFabricius has adopted under the name of _P. Gryllotalpæ_, but which\r\nare all evidently hexapod _Acarina_[1005].\r\n\r\n_Acariasis_ seems a disease almost as universal amongst insects as\r\n_Scolechiasis_; with this difference however, that _Acari_ most\r\ncommonly take their station upon them in their _perfect_ state. You\r\nhave doubtless often observed the common dung-beetles (_Geotrupes_)\r\ncovered on the underside of their body with small mites (_Gamasus\r\nColeoptratorum_) which look as if they were engaged in suction--they\r\nare often so numerous that no part is uncovered; they also attack\r\nother beetles[1006], and are sometimes found on humble-bees. They are\r\neasily disturbed, run with great swiftness, and may often be seen in\r\nhotbeds and fermenting dung prowling in search of the stercorarious\r\nbeetles. But the most remarkable insect of this kind is the _Uropoda\r\nvegetans_: it derives its nutriment from the insects it assails not\r\nby its _mouth_, but by means of a long _anal pedicle_ by which it is\r\nattached to them. De Geer found these in such numbers upon a species\r\nof _Leptura_, that its whole body was almost covered with them; they\r\nhung from the legs and antennæ in bunches, and gave the animal a most\r\nhideous and disgusting appearance. Under this load of vermin it could\r\nscarcely walk or move, and all its efforts to get rid of them were in\r\nvain: many were attached to its body and to each other by their anal\r\npedicles, but others had cast them off and were walking about. When\r\nput into a glass with earth, they began to abandon their prey, so\r\nthat in a few days it was quite freed from its plagues. He found that\r\nthese parasites lived long in alcohol[1007].\r\n\r\nIf you inquire--How are these mites originally fixed by their\r\npedicles? it seems most probable, that as the _Hemerobii_, when they\r\nlay their eggs, know how to place them upon a kind of footstalk, so\r\nthe parent _Uropoda_ has the same power; and this pedicle appears to\r\nact the part of an umbilical chord, conveying nutriment to the fœtus\r\nnot from a _placenta_, but from the body of the insect to which it\r\nis attached; till having thus attained a certain maturity of growth\r\nand structure, it disengages itself and becomes locomotive. Many eggs\r\nof the aquatic _Acarina_ (_Hydrachna_, &c.) are also furnished with\r\na short pedicle by which they are fixed to _Dytisci_ and other water\r\ninsects. De Geer found some of this description on the underside of\r\nthe water-scorpion, so thickly set as to leave no void space: they\r\nwere oval, of a very bright red, and of different sizes on different\r\nindividuals; whence it was evident that they grow when thus fixed:\r\nwhen hatched or released--for perhaps they may be regarded as fœtuses\r\nin their _amnios_ rather than eggs--they cease to be parasitical.\r\nLet us admire on this occasion, (piously observes this great\r\nEntomologist,) the different and infinitely varied means by which the\r\nAUTHOR of Nature has endowed animals, particularly insects, for their\r\npropagation and preservation: for it is a most extraordinary sight to\r\nsee eggs grow, and pump as it were their nutriment from the body of\r\nanother living animal[1008]. As these mites are fixed to the _crust_\r\nas well as its inosculations, they must have some means of forcing\r\ntheir nutriment through its pores.\r\n\r\nAnother insect, remarkable for its resemblance in some respects\r\nto the scorpion--called in this country the book-crab (_Chelifer\r\ncancroides_), from its being sometimes found in books--occasionally\r\nis parasitic upon flies, especially the common blue-bottle-fly\r\n(_Musca vomitoria_). They adhere to it very pertinaciously under\r\nthe wings; and if you attempt to disturb them, they run backwards,\r\nforwards, or sideways, with equal facility.\r\n\r\nSpiders also are infested by mites. Mr. Briggs once found a very\r\nsmall _Theridion_, to the thorax of which were attached four oblong\r\nbright scarlet mites, each of which was as large as the thorax\r\nitself. He afterwards met with another spider still smaller, attacked\r\nby two of these swoln parasites, one of which appeared to him nearly\r\nequal to the spider in size. This mite was probably either _Leptus\r\nPhalangii_, or _Astoma parasiticum_.\r\n\r\n2. We now come to a perfectly distinct tribe of insect parasites,\r\nwhich belong to that section or order of intestinal _worms_ which\r\nRudolph has denominated _Entozoa nematoidea_, and Lamarck _Vers\r\nrigidules_[1009]. To this tribe belong the _Gordius_ of Linné and\r\nthe _Filaria_ of modern zoologists, which from the experiments and\r\nobservations of De Geer, Dr. Matthey, &c. appear to have been too\r\nhastily separated, being really congenerous, and living indifferently\r\nin water and in the intestines of insects and other animals[1010].\r\nTo this genus belong the guinea-worm (_Gordius medinensis_[1011]),\r\nthe _Furia infernalis_, and several others that are found in various\r\nvertebrate animals. These little worms have been discovered in insects\r\nof almost every Order; and their attack generally produces the death\r\nof the animal, though they appear not to devour those parts that are\r\nessential to life[1012]. I once took a specimen of _Pœcilus azureus_,\r\nand upon immersing it in boiling water I was surprised to see what\r\nat first I mistook for an intestine, thrust itself forth; but upon a\r\nnearer inspection, to my great surprise I found it was one of these\r\nworms, thicker than a horse-hair and of a brown colour. Mr. W. S.\r\nMacLeay also once found one in _Abax Striola_. It still remains in my\r\nspecimen, making it appear as if it had a long tail. De Geer long ago\r\nfound these worms in grasshoppers[1012]; but Dr. Matthey has given the\r\nfullest account of one which infested _Acrida viridissima_. A friend\r\nof his noticing one of these insects which had not strength enough to\r\nleap and could scarcely even walk, being struck with the circumstance,\r\ncaught the animal, upon which its hind legs were immediately detached\r\nfrom it. His surprise was greatly increased when he saw issue from its\r\nbody a cylindrical worm about two feet and a half in length. Upon being\r\ncalled, Dr. M. soon recognised it for a _Gordius_ or _Filaria_; and on\r\nhis putting it into water, it moved in it with great velocity, twisting\r\nits long and slender body in all directions. Upon opening the body of\r\nthe grasshopper, nothing appeared within it but the intestine shrunk\r\nup to a thread. A few days after, another was brought, which appeared\r\nin full vigour, but its abdomen was enormously distended, and from it\r\nanother worm was extracted, which remained without motion rolled in a\r\nspiral direction: intending to preserve this in spirits of wine--as it\r\nhad become flat he first immersed it in water, that it might recover\r\nif possible its cylindrical form. Upon immersion a movement took place\r\nin the animal, and it gradually recovered its plumpness; but it still\r\nremained without motion, as if dead, for nearly five days, when another\r\nliving specimen being brought and placed with it, as soon as water\r\nwas poured on them, the seemingly dead one began to show by a slight\r\noscillation in its extremities that life was not extinct in it. Fresh\r\nwater being poured upon it, at the end of the day it had recovered\r\nall its strength and agility. He afterwards often repeated the same\r\nexperiment with a similar result[1013]. From this account it appears\r\nthat the _Gordius_ or _Filaria_ has a property resembling that of the\r\n_Vibrio Tritici_, so well described and so beautifully figured by M.\r\nBauer[1014], of apparently dying and being resuscitated by immersion in\r\nwater. How long it can retain this property remains to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nDe Geer states that he had seen them of the length of two feet[1015];\r\nbut they vary considerably in this respect. In ants, in which Gould\r\ndetected them, he states their length to be not more than half an\r\ninch[1016]. In caterpillars, which they sometimes infest, they are\r\nlonger; in that of _Notodonta Ziczac_, De Geer found one three inches\r\nand a half long[1017]; and Rösel three, of six inches, in that of\r\n_Deilephila Euphorbiæ_[1018]; and in _Phalangium cornutum_, according\r\nto Latreille, they extend to more than seven inches[1019]. In the larva\r\nof a _Phryganea_ L. the author first named found one which was more\r\nthan a foot long, corresponding exactly with the _Gordius aquaticus_\r\nof Linné; being forked at one extremity, brown above, gray below, and\r\nblack at each end[1020]. These animals _appear_ to die as soon as they\r\nleave the body[1021] they have preyed upon; except this happens in\r\nwater, when their activity has no repose. In this element they give\r\ntheir bodies every possible inflexion, often tying themselves in knots\r\nin various places, interlacing and twisting themselves in a hundred\r\ndifferent ways; so that when confined in the body of an insect, from\r\ntheir extreme suppleness and power of contortion they find sufficient\r\nspace wherein to pack their often enormous length[1022]. Linné makes\r\none of their habitats clay; and Mr. W. S. MacLeay finds them very\r\ncommon at Putney in clay at the bottom of pools.\r\n\r\nDr. Matthey asks--How does the _Gordius_ get into _Acrida\r\nviridissima_[1023]? And De Geer--Why do they die after having quitted\r\na caterpillar? and where do they perpetuate their species[1024]?\r\nThese questions, without further observations, cannot easily be\r\nanswered. However, it may be supposed that carnivorous insects, such\r\nas _Harpali_, &c. may swallow them when found apparently dead in\r\nclay, where the water has been evaporated, or when they have been\r\nejected by other insects; and they may revive in their bodies, as Dr.\r\nMatthey found them to do in water. It is not difficult to conjecture\r\nthat the larvæ of _Phryganeæ_ may meet with them when young in the\r\nwater, and sometimes unluckily swallow them with their food. Why they\r\nbecome as dead when they emerge from their prey we cannot at present\r\nconjecture; but no doubt to answer some wise purpose;--in rainy\r\nseasons they probably revive and get into little hollows full of\r\nrain-water. Upon De Geer's last question--How they perpetuate their\r\nspecies--at present I can offer no conjecture.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[918] _Ps._ civ. 29.\r\n\r\n[919] _Hist.

In treating on\r\nthis head I shall first say something on the senses in _general_, and\r\nthen confine myself to those of insects.\r\n\r\nTouch, taste, smell, hearing, and sight, I need not tell you, is\r\nthe usual enumeration of the senses: but as the term includes every\r\nmeans of communication with the external world, the list perhaps\r\nmight be increased; and there is ground for thinking that the number\r\n_seven_, so signalized as a _sacred_ number[1025], may also here\r\nhave place. Dr. Virey, an eminent physiologist, whose sentiments\r\non various subjects I have before noticed with approbation[1026],\r\nappears to be of opinion that there are really _seven_ senses; which\r\nhe divides into those that are altogether _physical_, and those that\r\nare more connected with the _intellect_. The first of these divisions\r\ncontains _four_ senses,--touch, love, taste, and smell;--the second\r\n_three_,--hearing, sight, and the internal sense of thought, or the\r\nbrain[1027]. That he is right in adding _love_ to the list seems to\r\nme evident, because it is as distinct from _touch_, as _smelling_ and\r\n_taste_ are. With regard to the other, though it may be expected that\r\nthere should be a transitive sense connecting the intellect (if I may\r\nso speak) with the external organ of sense, and as a medium by which\r\nthe former can receive the notices of the external world furnished by\r\nthe latter; yet it seems improper to make the _entire brain_ itself\r\na _sense_. We know that the agent between the common sensory and the\r\nsense is the consciousness or _perception_ of the impression. \"Seeing\r\nwe may see and not _perceive_, and hearing we may hear and not\r\n_understand_.\" The picture may be painted upon the retina of the eye,\r\nthe sound may strike upon the tympanum of the ear; but neither the\r\none nor the other be received by the intellect, unless the internal\r\npower or faculty of perception be in action and mediate between them.\r\nThis is what I mean by the _internal sense_, which, to use a term of\r\nMr. W. S. MacLeay's[1028], is _osculant_ between intellect and sense,\r\nor forms the transit from one group of powers to the other.\r\n\r\nOf the ordinary senses, _sight_ holds the first rank: it can dart\r\nto the region of the stars, and convey by the perceiving sense, to\r\nthe sensory, ideas of innumerable objects. Next in rank is _hearing_,\r\nwhich can receive sounds from a great distance; but the ideas it\r\nremits are confined only to one object, the variations of tones. In\r\nthe other organs the sensitive power is much more confined. There is\r\nanother difference between the intellectual and physical senses:--the\r\nformer are the only ones that receive and convey sensations of the\r\nbeautiful and sublime; of harmony and discord,--the latter, though\r\nthey minister more to our sensual enjoyments, add little to our\r\nintellectual; and therefore too devoted an indulgence in them debases\r\nour nature, and levels us with the brutes, which use their eyes and\r\nears only for information, not for pleasure[1029].\r\n\r\nIn man the ordinary five senses are usually in their greatest\r\nperfection, although in some animals particular senses have a greater\r\nrange. The Vertebrates in general are also gifted with the same\r\nnumber, though there are some exceptions. But in the _Invertebrates_\r\nthey are seldom to be met with all together in the same object. The\r\n_Cephalopods_ have no _smell_. Several _Gasteropods_ can neither\r\n_hear_ nor _see_. The animals of bivalve shells have neither eyes,\r\nnor ears, nor smell; and the zoophytes and the races below them have,\r\nit is affirmed, only the single sense of _touch_, which in them is so\r\nextremely delicate as to be acted upon even by _light_[1030].\r\n\r\nNot so our insects. These, there is good reason to believe, possess\r\nall the ordinary senses. That they can _see_, _touch_, _taste_, and\r\n_smell_, no one denies. Linné and Bonnet, however, thought them\r\ndeprived of _hearing_[1031]; but numerous observations prove the\r\ncontrary. That they hear in their _larva_ state, is evident from\r\nfacts stated by the latter physiologist. He found that the sound of\r\nhis voice evidently affected some caterpillars; which he attributes,\r\nbut surely without reason, to the delicacy of their sense of touch:\r\nat another time, when some caterpillars of a different species were\r\nmoving swiftly, he rang a small bell; upon which they instantly\r\nstopped and moved the anterior part of their body very briskly[1032].\r\nThat they possess this faculty in their _imago_ state is confirmed\r\nstill more strongly by facts. I once was observing the motions of an\r\n_Apion_ under a pocket microscope: on seeing me it receded. Upon my\r\nmaking a slight but distinct noise, its antennæ started: I repeated\r\nthe noise several times, and invariably with the same effect. A\r\n_Harpalus_, which I was holding in my hand, answered the sound in\r\nthe same manner repeatedly. Flies, I have observed, at brisk and\r\ndistinct sounds move all their legs; and spiders will quit their\r\nprey and retire to their hiding places. Insects that live in society\r\ngive notice of intended movements, or assemble their citizens for\r\nemigration by a certain _hum_[1033]. But the most satisfactory proof\r\nof the hearing of these animals is to be had from those _Orthoptera_\r\nand _Hemiptera_ whose males are vocal. Brunelli kept and fed several\r\nmales of _Acrida viridissima_ (a grasshopper with us not uncommon)\r\nin a closet, which were very merry, and continued singing all the\r\nday; but a rap at the door would stop them instantly. By practice he\r\nlearned to imitate their chirping: when he did this at the door, at\r\nfirst a few would answer him in a low note, and then the whole party\r\nwould take up the tune and sing with all their might. He once shut up\r\na male in his garden, and gave the female her liberty; but as soon as\r\nshe heard the male chirp, she flew to him immediately[1034].\r\n\r\nBut although physiologists are for the most part agreed that insects\r\nhave the ordinary five senses of vertebrate animals, yet a great\r\nvariety of opinions has obtained as to their external organs; so that\r\nit has been matter of doubt, for instance, whether the _antennæ_ are\r\nfor smell, touch, or hearing; and the _palpi_ for smell, taste, or\r\ntouch. Nor has the question, as it appears to me, been satisfactorily\r\ndecided: for though it is now the most general opinion that the\r\nprimary use of antennæ is to _explore_ as _tactors_, yet by the\r\nmost strenuous advocates of this opinion they are owned not to be\r\n_universally_ so employed; so that granting this to be _one_ of\r\ntheir principal functions, yet it seems to follow that there may\r\nbe _another_ common to them all, which of course would be their\r\n_primary_ function. We are warned, however, not to lay any stress\r\nupon the argument to be drawn from analogy; and told that we might as\r\nwell dispute about the identity of the nose of a man, the proboscis\r\nof the elephant, the horn of the rhinoceros, the crest of the cock,\r\nor the beak of the toucan[1035]. But this is merely casting dust\r\nin our eyes: for though three of these are _nasal_ organs, bearing\r\n_nostrils_; the two others have no relation to the question, the\r\nhorn of the rhinoceros and the crest of the cock being merely\r\n_appendages_, and have no more analogy to the nose and nostrils,\r\nwhich co-exist with them, than they have to the eyes or ears. I have\r\non a former occasion observed, that a gradual change sometimes takes\r\nplace in the functions of particular organs; but still, generally\r\nspeaking, this observation regards _secondary_ functions--the\r\n_primary_ usually remaining untouched. We may say, for instance,\r\nwith regard to the primary use of the _legs_ of animals, that it is\r\nlocomotion; while the secondary is either walking, running, jumping,\r\nflying, or swimming, according to the circumstances and nature of the\r\nanimal. Thus the _fore-legs_ of the _Mammalia_, in _birds_ become\r\n_wings_, and both pair in _fish_ are changed to _fins_. Observe, I do\r\nnot say _always_ and invariably, but in most cases,--that analogous\r\nparts have analogous uses, at least as far as _primary_ uses are\r\nconcerned. When, therefore, we cannot have demonstrative evidence\r\nconcerning the function of an organ discoverable in any animal, we\r\nmay often derive satisfactory probable arguments from the analogies\r\nobservable in their structure compared with that of other animals,\r\nconcerning the nature of whose organs we have no doubt. In fact,\r\nthe chief evidence we have with regard to the office of the organs\r\nof sense in the animals immediately below ourselves, is that of\r\nanalogy;--because _we_ see with our eyes, hear with our ears, &c., we\r\nconclude, with reason, that _they_ do the same.\r\n\r\nIn inquiring therefore into what may be the most general use of the\r\nantennæ of insects, I shall endeavour to discover whether there is\r\nany part in the higher animals to which they may be deemed to exhibit\r\nany analogy. And here I must refer you to what I have said on a\r\nformer occasion upon the present subject; where I made it evident, I\r\nhope, that the great bulk of the parts and organs of insects, in this\r\nparticular differing from the majority of Invertebrates, are, some\r\nin one respect, some in another, and some in many, really analogous\r\nto those of the higher animals[1036]; and that a great many of them,\r\nthough varying in their structure, have the same functions. Thus\r\nthe analogues of the _eyes_ of Vertebrates are for _seeing_; of the\r\n_jaws_ for _masticating_; of the _lips_ for _closing_ the _mouth_; of\r\nthe _legs_ for _walking_, &c. We have seen also very recently, that\r\na similar analogy, more or less strongly marked, holds also in their\r\ninternal organs[1037]; so that it may be safely affirmed, that if all\r\nthe invertebrate insects, though gifted with numerous peculiarities,\r\npresent the most striking picture of those animals that have an\r\ninternal skeleton, and more particularly of the _Mammalia_,--we may\r\nassume it as a probability, the above circumstances being allowed\r\ntheir due weight, that where facts do not prove the contrary, the\r\nfunction of analogous organs is more or less synonymous, though\r\nperhaps the structure and _modus operandi_ may be different.\r\n\r\nIn the letter lately referred to, I observed that the antennæ of\r\ninsects are analogous to _ears_ in Vertebrates[1038]. Their _number_\r\ncorresponds; they also stand out from the head; and what has\r\nweighed most with me, unless they are allowed as such, no other\r\norgan can have any pretension to be considered as representing the\r\near. If we reflect, that in every other part and organ, the head of\r\ninsects has an analogy to that of _Mammalia_, we must regard it as\r\nimprobable that these prominent organs should not also have their\r\nrepresentative. Admitting then that they are the analogues of ears,\r\nit will follow, not as demonstratively certain, but as probable,\r\nthat their _primary_ function may be something related to hearing.\r\nI do not say direct _hearing_, or that the vibrations of sound are\r\ncommunicated to the sensorium by a complex structure analogous to\r\nthat of the internal ear in _Mammalia_--but something _related_\r\nto hearing. I conceive that antennæ, by a peculiar structure, may\r\ncollect notices from the atmosphere, receive pulses or vibrations,\r\nand communicate them to the sensorium, which, though not precisely to\r\nbe called hearing, may answer the same purpose. From the _compound_\r\neyes that most of them have, the sense of seeing in insects must\r\nbe very different from what it is in vertebrate animals; and yet\r\nwe do not hesitate to call it _sight_: but since antennæ, as we\r\nshall see, apparently convey a _mixed_ sensation, I shall have\r\nno objection, admitting it as their primary function, to call it\r\nafter Lehmann _Aëroscepsy_[1039]. I lately related some instances\r\nof _sound_ producing an effect on the _antennæ_ of insects: I will\r\nnow mention another that I observed, still more remarkable. A\r\nlittle moth was reposing upon my window; I made a quiet, not loud,\r\nbut distinct noise: the antenna nearest to me immediately moved\r\ntowards me. I repeated the noise at least a dozen times, and it\r\nwas followed every time by the same motion of that organ; till at\r\nlength the insect being alarmed became more agitated and violent\r\nin its motions. In this instance it could not be _touch_; since\r\nthe antenna was not applied to a surface, but directed towards the\r\nquarter from which the sound came, as if to listen. Bonsdorf made\r\nsimilar observations, to which Lehmann seems not disposed to allow\r\ntheir proper weight[1040]. It has been used as an argument to prove\r\nthat antennæ are primarily _tactors_, or instruments of _touch_,\r\nthat _Fœnus Jaculator_, before it inserts its ovipositor, plunges\r\nits _antennæ_ into the hole forming the nidus of the bee, to the\r\ngrub of which it commits its egg[1041]. But had those who used this\r\nargument _measured_ the antennæ and the ovipositor of this ichneumon,\r\nthey would have discovered that the latter is thrice the length of\r\nthe former: and as these insects generally insert it so that even\r\npart of the abdomen enters the hole, it is clear that the antenna\r\ncannot _touch_ the larva; its object therefore cannot be to explore\r\nby that sense. Others suppose that by these organs it _scents_ out\r\nthe destined nidus for its eggs; but Lehmann has satisfactorily\r\nproved that they are not _olfactory_ organs. We can therefore only\r\nsuppose, either that by means of its antennæ it _hears_ a slight\r\nnoise produced by the latent grub, perhaps by the action of its\r\nmandibles; or else that by its motions it generates a _motion_ in\r\nthe atmosphere of its habitation, which striking upon the antennæ\r\nof the _Fœnus_, are by them communicated to its sensory. A similar\r\ndisproportion is observable between the antennæ and ovipositor of\r\n_Pimpla Manifestator_, before signalized[1042]. Bees, when collecting\r\nhoney and pollen, first insert the organs in question into the\r\nflowers which they visit; but, as I have more than once observed,\r\nthey merely insert the _tip_ of them. If anthers are bursting, or the\r\nnectar is exuding, these processes probably are attended by a slight\r\nnoise, or motion of the air within the blossom, which, as in the last\r\ncase, affects, without immediate contact, the exploring organs.\r\n\r\nIf the _structure_ of antennæ be taken into consideration, it will\r\nfurnish us with additional reasons in favour of the above hypothesis,\r\nwith regard to their primary function. We shall find that these\r\norgans, in most of those insects which take their food by suction,\r\nare usually less gifted with powers of motion, than they are in\r\nthe mandibulate tribes; so that in the majority of the Homopterous\r\n_Hemiptera_ and _Diptera_, as is generally acknowledged, they cannot\r\nbe used for _touch_. Under this view, they may be divided into\r\n_active_ antennæ and _passive_ antennæ: of the former, the _most_\r\nactive and versatile are those of the _Hymenoptera_. By means of\r\nthem, as was before observed[1043], their gregarious tribes hold\r\nconverse, and make _inquiry_--frequently without _contact_--in the\r\npursuit and discharge, if I may so speak, of the various duties\r\ndevolved upon them by PROVIDENCE. Amongst active antennæ, some are\r\nmuch more _complex_ in their structure than others--a circumstance\r\nwhich is often characteristic of the _male_ insect[1044]: but if\r\nwe examine such antennæ, we shall find that their most _sensitive_\r\nparts cannot come in _contact_ with the earth or other bodies for\r\nexploring their way; but having thus a greater surface exposed to\r\nthe action of the atmosphere, they have more points to receive\r\nvibrations, or any pulses or other notices communicated to it.\r\nIt is thus, probably, that in their flights, when they approach\r\nwithin a certain distance, they discover the station of the other\r\nsex. Even the plumose antennæ of male gnats may in some respects\r\nthus be acted upon. In the Lamellicorn beetles, the knob of these\r\norgans in both sexes consists of laminæ, the external ones on their\r\noutside, of a corneous substance; while their internal surface, and\r\nthe inner laminæ--which are included between them, as an oyster\r\nbetween the valves of its shell--are covered with nervous papillæ.\r\nIf you examine the proceedings of one of these little animals, you\r\nwill find before it moves from a state of repose that its antennæ\r\nemerge, and the laminæ diverge from each other; but that it does\r\nnot apply them to _surfaces_ to explore its way, but merely keeps\r\nthem _open_ to receive notices from the atmosphere. Even _simple_\r\nantennæ are often employed in this way, as well as for touch. I once\r\nnoticed a species of _Leptocerus_, a trichopterous genus, in which\r\nthese organs are very long, that was perched upon a blade of grass;\r\nits antennæ vibrated, and it kept moving them from side to side in\r\nthe air, as if thus by aëroscepsy it was inquiring what was passing\r\naround it. Dr. Wollaston has an observation bearing so precisely\r\nupon this question, and in general so extremely similar to what is\r\nhere advanced, that I must copy it for your consideration. \"Since\r\nthere is nothing in the constitution of the atmosphere,\" says he,\r\n\"to prevent vibrations much more frequent than any of which we are\r\nconscious, we may imagine that animals like the _Grylli_, whose\r\npowers appear to commence nearly where ours terminate, may have the\r\nfaculty of hearing still sharper sounds, which at present we do not\r\nknow to exist; and that there may be other insects, hearing nothing\r\nin common with us, but endued with a power of exciting, and a sense\r\nthat perceives, vibrations indeed of the same nature as those which\r\nconstitute our ordinary sounds, but so remote, that the animals\r\nwho perceive them may be said _to possess another sense, agreeing\r\nwith our own solely in the medium by which it is excited_, and\r\npossibly wholly unaffected by these slower vibrations of which we are\r\nsensible[1045].\" That insects, however, hear nothing in common with\r\nus, is contrary to fact; at least with respect to numbers of them.\r\nThey hear our sounds, and we theirs; but their hearing or analogous\r\nsense is much nicer than ours, collecting the slightest vibratiuncle\r\nimparted by other insects, &c. to the air. In inquiring how this is\r\ndone, it may be asked--How know we that every joint of some antennæ\r\nis not an acoustic organ, in a certain sense distinct from the rest?\r\nWe see that the eyes of insects are usually compound, and consist\r\nof numerous distinct lenses;--why may not their external ears or\r\ntheir analogues be also multiplied, so as to enable them with more\r\ncertainty to collect those fine vibrations that we know reach their\r\nsensory, though they produce no effect upon our grosser organs? I\r\npropose this merely as conjecture, that you may think it over, and\r\nreject or adopt it, in proportion as it appears to you reasonable or\r\nthe contrary; and in the hope that some anatomist of insects, who, to\r\nthe sagacity and depth of a Cuvier and a Savigny adds the hand and\r\neye of a Lyonet, may give to the world the results of a more minute\r\ndissection and fuller investigation of the antennæ of these animals,\r\nthan has yet been undertaken.\r\n\r\nBut besides receiving notices from the atmosphere, of sounds, and\r\nof the approach or proximity of other insects, &c., the antennæ are\r\nprobably the organs by which insects can discover alterations in its\r\nstate, and foretel by certain prognostics when a change of weather\r\nis approaching. Bees possess this faculty to an admirable degree.\r\nWhen engaged in their daily labours, if a shower is approaching,\r\nthough we can discern no signs of it, they foresee it, and return\r\nsuddenly to their hives. If they wander far from home, and do not\r\nreturn till late in the evening, it is a prognostic to be depended\r\nupon, that the following day will be fine: but if they remain near\r\ntheir habitations, and are seen frequently going and returning,\r\nalthough no other indication of wet should be discoverable, clouds\r\nwill soon arise and rain come on. Ants also are observed to be\r\nexcellently gifted in this respect: though they daily bring out their\r\nlarvæ to sun them, they are never overtaken by sudden showers[1046].\r\nPreviously to rain, as you well know, numberless insects seek\r\nthe house; then the _Stomoxys calcitrans_, leaving more ignoble\r\nprey, attacks us in our apartments, and interrupts our studies and\r\nmeditations[1047]. The insects of prey also foresee the approach of\r\nwet weather, and the access of flies, &c. to places of shelter. Then\r\nthe spiders issue from their lurking-places, and the ground-beetles\r\nin the evening run about our houses. Passive antennæ, which are\r\nusually furnished with a terminal or lateral bristle, and plumose and\r\npectinated ones, seem calculated for the action of the _electric_ and\r\nother fluids dispersed in the atmosphere, which in certain states\r\nand proportions may certainly indicate the approach of a tempest,\r\nor of showers, or a rainy season, and may so affect these organs as\r\nto enable the insect to make a sure prognostic of any approaching\r\nchange: and we know of no other organ that is so likely to have\r\nthis power. I say _electric_ fluid, because when the atmosphere is\r\nin a highly electrified state, and a tempest is approaching, is the\r\ntime when insects are usually most abundant in the air, especially\r\ntowards the evening; and many species may then be taken, which are\r\nnot at other times to be met with: but before the storm comes on, all\r\ndisappear, and you will scarcely see a single individual upon the\r\nwing. This seems to indicate that insects are particularly excited\r\nby electricity[1048].--But upon this head I wish to make no positive\r\nassertion, I only suggest the probability of the opinion[1049].\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, I think you will be disposed to admit\r\nthat the primary and most universal function of the antennæ is to\r\nbe the organs of a sense, if not the same, at least analogous to\r\n_hearing_, and answering the same end; something perhaps between it\r\nand touch. In some, however, as has been found in the _Crustacea_, an\r\norgan of hearing, in the ordinary sense, may exist at the base of the\r\nantennæ, which may act the part in some measure of the external ear,\r\nand collect and transmit the sound to such organ[1050].\r\n\r\nThat numerous antennæ, as a _secondary_ function, explore by _touch_,\r\nis admitted on all hands, and therefore I need not enlarge further\r\nupon this point; but shall proceed to inquire whether insects do not\r\npossess some other peculiar organs that are particularly appropriated\r\nto this sense. First, however, I must make some _general_\r\nobservations upon it. Of all our senses, _touch_ is the only one\r\nthat is not _confined_ to particular organs, but dispersed over the\r\nwhole body: insects, however, from the indurated crust with which\r\nthey are often covered, feel sensibly, it is probable, only in those\r\nparts where the nerves are exposed, by being covered with a thinner\r\nepidermis, to external action. Not that they cannot feel at all in\r\ntheir covered parts; for as we feel sufficiently for walking, though\r\nour feet are covered by the thick sole of a boot or shoe, so insects\r\nfeel sufficiently through the crust of their legs for all purposes\r\nof motion. Besides, the points that are covered by a thinner cuticle\r\nare often numerous; so that touch, at least in a _passive_ sense,\r\nmay be pretty generally dispersed over their bodies; but _active_ or\r\nexploring touch is confined to a few organs, as the _antennæ_, the\r\n_palpi_, and the _arms_. The two last I shall now discuss.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been started concerning the use of the _palpi_.\r\nBonsdorf thought that they were organs of _smell_; Knoch, that this\r\nsense was confined to the _maxillary_ ones, and that the _labial_\r\nones were appropriated to _taste_[1051]: but the most early idea, and\r\nthat from which they derive their present name of palpi (_feelers_),\r\nis, that they are organs of active _touch_; and this seems to me the\r\nmost correct and likely opinion. Cuvier, himself a host, has embraced\r\nthis side of the question[1052], and Lehmann also admits it[1053].\r\nThe following observations tend to confirm this opinion. The palpi of\r\nnumerous insects when they walk, are frequently, or rather without\r\nintermission, applied to the surface on which they are moving--this\r\nyou may easily see by placing one upon your hand; which seems to\r\nindicate that they are _feelers_. In the _Araneidæ_ they are used as\r\n_legs_; and by the males at least, as _exciting_ if they be not really\r\n_genital_ organs[1054]. In the _Scorpionidæ_ they answer the purpose\r\nof _hands_: besides being usually much shorter than antennæ, they\r\nare better calculated to assist an insect in threading the dark and\r\ntortuous labyrinths through which it has often to grope its way, and\r\nwhere antennæ cannot be employed. I have noticed that _Hydrophili_--in\r\nwhich genus the _palpi_ are longer than the antennæ--when they swim,\r\nhave their antennæ folded; while the former are stretched out in front,\r\nas exploring before them. As these are attached to the under-jaws and\r\nunder-lip, we may suppose they are particularly useful to insects in\r\ntaking their food; and upon this occasion I have often observed that\r\nthey are remarkably active. I have seen _Byturus tomentosus_, a beetle\r\nwhich feeds upon pollen, employ them in opening anthers; and the\r\nmaxillary pair appear to me to assist the maxillæ in holding the food,\r\nwhile the mandibles are at work upon it.\r\n\r\nThe _arms_ or fore-legs of some insects are also organs of _active_\r\ntouch, being used, as we have seen, for cleaning the head, digging,\r\nrepairing their dwellings, and the like[1055]. By the _Ephemeræ_,\r\nwhich have very short antennæ, the fore-legs, when they fly, are\r\nextended before the head, parallel with each other and quite\r\nunited--probably to assist in cutting the air. The _Trichoptera_ use\r\ntheir antennæ for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother sense of which the organ seems uncertain is that of _smelling_,\r\nand various and conflicting opinions have been circulated concerning\r\nit. Christian thought that insects smell _distant_ objects with their\r\n_antennæ_, and _near_ ones with their _palpi_[1056]. Comparetti has\r\na most singular opinion. He supposes in different tribes of insects\r\nthat different parts are organs of smell: in the _Lamellicorns_ he\r\nconjectures the seat of this sense to reside in the _knob_ of the\r\n_antennæ_; in the _Lepidoptera_ in the _antlia_; and in some _Diptera_\r\nand _Orthoptera_ in certain _frontal cells_[1057]. At first sight, one\r\nof the most reasonable opinions seems to be that of Baster, adopted by\r\nLehmann, and which has received the sanction of Cuvier[1058],--that\r\nthe _spiracles_ are organs of smell as well as of respiration. Lehmann\r\nhas adduced several arguments in support of this opinion. Because we\r\nboth respire and smell with our nostrils, he concludes that neither\r\nthe antennæ nor any other part of the head of insects can serve for\r\n_smell_, since they are not the seat also of _respiration_; and that\r\nthere can be no smell where the air is not inspired[1059]. Again,\r\nbecause nerves from the ganglions of the spinal chord terminate in\r\nbronchiæ near the spiracles, they must be for receiving scents from\r\nthose openings. Though it was necessary, in the higher animals,\r\nthat the organ of scent should be near the mouth, because they are\r\nlarger than their food; yet the reverse of this being the case with\r\ninsects, which often even reside in what they eat, it is to them of no\r\nimportance where their sense of smelling resides[1060]. By exposing\r\nantennæ, by means of an orifice in a glass vessel, to the action of\r\nstimulant odours, they appeared quite insensible to it: but he does not\r\nname the result of any experiment in which he exposed the _mouth_ to\r\nthis action; nor at all distinctly how the insect was affected when the\r\nspiracles were exposed to it[1061].\r\n\r\nBut though some of these arguments appear weighty, there are others,\r\nI think, that will more than counterbalance them, making it probable\r\nthat the seat of this sense is in the head, either in its ordinary\r\nstation at the extremity of what I call the _nose_, between it and\r\nthe upper-lip, or under those parts. That the nose corresponds\r\nwith the so-named part in _Mammalia_, both from its situation and\r\noften from its form, must be evident to every one who looks at an\r\ninsect[1062]; and when we further consider the connexion that obtains\r\nbetween the senses of smell and taste, how necessary it is that the\r\nseat of the one should be near that of the other, and that it really\r\nis so in all animals in which we certainly know its organ[1063]; we\r\nshall feel convinced that the argument from analogy is wholly in\r\nfavour of the nose, and may thence consider it as probable that the\r\nsense in question does reside there. Lehmann seems to be of opinion,\r\nbecause an insect is usually smaller than what it feeds upon, that\r\nit makes no difference whether it smells with its _head_ or with its\r\n_tail_: but one would think that a _flying_ insect would be more\r\nreadily directed to its object by smelling with the _anterior_ part\r\nof the body than with the _posterior_; and that a _feeding_ one\r\nwould also find it more convenient in selecting its food. As to the\r\nargument,--that _smell_ must be the _necessary_ concomitant of the\r\n_respiratory_ openings, and that there can be no smell where the\r\n_air_ is not inspired,--this seems asserting more than our knowledge\r\nof these animals will warrant: for the organs of the _other_ senses,\r\nthough the senses themselves seem analogous, are so different in\r\ntheir structure, and often in the mode in which they receive the\r\nimpressions from external objects, that analogy would lead us to\r\nexpect a difference of this kind also in the sense of smell. Besides,\r\nsmell does not _invariably_ accompany respiratory organs even in the\r\nhigher animals,--for we _breathe_ with our _mouths_, but do not smell\r\nwith them. Cuvier says that the _internal_ membrane of the tracheæ\r\nbeing soft and moist, appears calculated to receive scents[1064]. But\r\nhere his memory failed him; for it is the _external_ membrane alone\r\nthat answers this description; the _internal_ consisting of a spiral\r\nelastic thread, and seeming not at all fitted to receive impressions,\r\nbut merely to convey the air[1065]. That nerves penetrate to the\r\nbronchiæ, does not necessarily imply that they are connected with the\r\nsense in question, since this may be to act upon the muscles which\r\nare every where distributed.\r\n\r\nI shall now state some facts that seem to prove that scents are\r\nreceived by some organ in the vicinity of the _mouth_, and probably\r\nconnected with the _nose_. M. P. Huber, desirous of ascertaining\r\nthe seat of smell in _bees_, tried the following experiments with\r\nthat view. These animals, of all ill scents, abominate most that of\r\nthe oil of turpentine. He presented successively to all the points\r\nof a bee's body, a hair-pencil saturated with it: but whether he\r\npresented it to the abdomen, the trunk, or the head, the animal\r\nequally disregarded it. Next, using a very fine hair-pencil, while\r\nthe bee had extended its proboscis, he presented the pencil to it,\r\nto the eyes and antennæ, without producing any effect; but when he\r\npointed it _near the cavity of the mouth, above the insertion of\r\nthe proboscis_, the creature started back in an instant, quitted\r\nits food, clapped its wings, and walked about in great agitation,\r\nand would have taken flight if the pencil had not been removed. On\r\nthis, it began to eat again; but on the experiment being repeated,\r\nshowed similar signs of discomposure: oil of marjoram produced the\r\nsame effect, but more promptly and certainly. Bees not engaged in\r\n_feeding_ appeared more sensible of the impression of this odour, and\r\nat a greater distance; but those engaged in absorbing honey might\r\nbe touched in every other part without being disturbed. He seized\r\nseveral of them, forced them to unfold their proboscis, and then\r\nstopped their mouth with paste. When this was become sufficiently\r\ndry to prevent their getting rid of it, he restored to them their\r\nliberty: they appeared not incommoded by being thus gagged, but moved\r\nand respired as readily as their companions. He then tempted them\r\nwith honey, and presented to them near the mouth, oil of turpentine,\r\nand other odours that they usually have an aversion to; but all\r\nproduced no sensible effect upon them, and they even walked upon the\r\npencils saturated with them[1066].\r\n\r\nThese experiments incontestibly prove that the organ of scent in\r\nbees--and there is no reason to think that other insects do not\r\nfollow the same law--is in or near the _mouth_, and above the\r\nproboscis. It remains, therefore, that we endeavour to discover\r\nits _precise_ situation: and as insects cannot tell us, nor can\r\nwe perceive by their actions, in what precise part the sense in\r\nquestion resides, the only modes to which we can have recourse to\r\nform any probable conjecture, are analogy and dissection. At first,\r\nthe opinion noticed above, that the palpi are its organs, seems not\r\naltogether unreasonable; but as the argument from analogy, except\r\nas to their situation near the mouth, is not in favour of them, and\r\nthere seems no call, were smell their function, for the numerous\r\nvariations observable in their structure, I think we must consider\r\nthem, as I have endeavoured to prove, rather as instruments of\r\ntouch. Let us now inquire, whether there be not discoverable upon\r\ndissection, in the interior of the head of any insects, some organ\r\nthat may be deemed, from its situation, under what we have called\r\nthe nose and nostrils, the seat of the sense we are treating of.\r\nThe common burying-beetle (_Necrophorus Vespillo_) is an insect\r\nremarkable for its acuteness of smell, which enables it to scent\r\nout and bury, as was formerly related to you[1067], the carcases of\r\nsmall animals. Take one of these insects, and kill it as formerly\r\ndirected,--examine first its nose: in the middle of the anterior part\r\nyou will see a subtrapezoidal space, as it were cut out and filled\r\nwith a paler piece of a softer and more membranous texture. Next\r\ndivide the head horizontally; and under the nose, and partly under\r\nthis space, which I call the _rhinarium_ or nostril-piece[1068], you\r\nwill find a pair of circular pulpy cushions, covered by a membrane\r\ntransversely striated with beautifully fine striæ. _These_ are what\r\nI take to be the organs of smell, and they still remain distinctly\r\nvisible in a specimen I have had by me more than fifteen years.\r\nA similar organ may be discovered in the common water-beetle\r\n(_Dytiscus marginalis_), but with this peculiarity, that it is\r\nfurnished with a pair of _nipples_. I have before described an\r\nanalogous part covered with papillæ, in _Æshna viatica_, and you\r\nwill find it in other insects[1069]. Perhaps at first this part\r\nmay seem merely a continuation of the palate; but if you consider\r\nthe peculiarities in its structure just noticed, it is evidently\r\na sensiferous organ; and as the sense of smell appears to reside\r\nin the head, this is its most probable seat. But by what channel\r\nscents act upon it,--whether they are transmitted through the pores\r\nof the part representing the nostrils, or received by the mouth,--I\r\nwill not venture to assert positively: but from the circumstance\r\nof their being _membranous_ in some insects remarkable for acute\r\nscent, as in _Necrophorus_, _Staphylinus_, &c., there seems some\r\nground for the _former_ opinion, which receives further confirmation\r\nfrom an observation of an eminent Comparative Anatomist, M. Carus,\r\nwith respect to _Acrida verrucivora_, in which under the _nose_ and\r\n_rhinarium_, as appears from his description, he found some tracheæ,\r\nand two lobes of the cerebral ganglion, which caused him to regard\r\nthis as the seat of the sense of smell[1070]. He also tells us that\r\nRosenthal, in the blue-bottle-fly (_Musca vomitoria_) places the\r\nsense of smell partly in a delicately folded membrane observable\r\nin its head[1071]. As the sense of smell in these little beings\r\nis extremely acute, as well as their hearing, the perception of\r\nodours may reach their sensory through the above pores; and even\r\nthose in the hard rhinarium of an _Anoplognathus_ may receive and\r\ntransmit them; and besides the upper-lip and nose are often united\r\nby membrane, perhaps representing the _rhinarium_, as in _Goerius_,\r\n&c.[1072] which may facilitate such transmission.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat insects _taste_, no one hesitates to believe, though some have\r\nsupposed the palpi to be the organ of that sense; but as they have\r\na _tongue_, as we have shown, we may with Cuvier conclude, that one\r\nof its primary functions is to _taste_ their food[1073]. I shall not\r\ntherefore launch out further upon this head.\r\n\r\nI have now placed before you a picture, or rather sketch, of the\r\ninsect world.

To enable you to understand descriptions of\r\ninsects, or to describe them yourself, you must have a knowledge of\r\nthe _technical_ language by which their parts and characters are\r\nexpressed. Much of this you already know from the definitions of\r\nexternal parts, furnished in a former letter[1074]: I shall now give\r\nyou a more full and general explanation of terms, adding many new\r\nones for unnoticed characters, that may be conveniently employed.\r\n\r\nThe science of terms, which I shall call _Orismology_[1075], may be\r\ndivided into _two_ branches--_General_ Orismology, and _Partial_\r\nOrismology; the first containing _general_ definitions, and the last\r\nthose relating to _particular_ parts and organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         A.

As,\r\nDenti_cle_, a little tooth; Set_ule_, a little bristle; Eye_let_, a\r\nsmall eye: Denticu_lus_, a little dens; Guttu_la_, a little gutta;\r\nPunctu_lum_, a little punctum. N.B. Where length or breadth are\r\nconcerned, the diminutive implies a diminution in the length of\r\nthe predicate. As, Lineo_la_, Lineo_let_, a short line; Strio_la_,\r\nStrio_let_, a short stria; Fascio_la_, Fascio_let_, a short fascia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RULE II.\r\n\r\nThe preposition _sub_ prefixed to any word _reduces_ the sense of\r\nit. As, _Sub_punctate, not fully punctate; _Sub_hirsute, not fully\r\nhirsute, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RULE III.\r\n\r\nThe termination _culus_ in Latin words added to a comparative implies\r\nthe state of the object comparatively. As, Convexius_culus_, rather\r\nconvex than not; Majus_culus_, rather large than not. This is usually\r\ndenoted in English by the termination _ish_, or the adverb _rather_;\r\nas, larg_ish_, _rather_ large, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RULE IV.\r\n\r\nThe participle present used instead of the adjective implies a\r\n_tendency_ to the quality expressed by it. As, _Cinerascens_,\r\ncinerascent, tending to cinereous, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RULE V.\r\n\r\nThe preposition _ob_ prefixed to a term reverses it. As, _Ob_conical,\r\n_Ob_cordate, a conical or heart-shaped body, of which the narrowest\r\npart is the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                RULE VI.\r\n\r\nIn compound terms the _last_ member indicates the _preponderating_\r\ncharacter. For instance, when it is said of a body that it is\r\n_nigro-æneous_, it means that the æneous tint prevails: but if,\r\n_vice versâ_, it is termed _æneo-nigrous_, the black tint is\r\npredominant.--N.B. In Sculpture the terms punctato-striate, or\r\npunctato-sulcate, signify that striæ or furrows are drawn with puncta\r\nin them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Exception_ 1.\r\n\r\nSome compound terms only indicate the union of two characters in one\r\nsubject. As, when we say of wings that they are cruciato-incumbent, we\r\nmean both that they cross each other and are incumbent upon the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _Exception_ 2.\r\n\r\nCompound terms are sometimes employed very conveniently to restrict\r\nthe application of a character to particular circumstances. As, when\r\nwe say hirsuto-cinereous, we mean that the hirsuties only of a body\r\nis cinereous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               RULE VII.\r\n\r\nWhen the term ordinary (_ordinarius_) is added either to terms\r\nexpressing impressed puncta, lines, spots, &c., it signifies that\r\nsuch puncta, lines, or spots are common to a particular section in\r\nany genus or tribe. As, the impressed lateral puncta on the thorax of\r\n_Scarabæidæ_; the lateral furrows and dorsal channel in the ground\r\nbeetles (_Eutrech_in_a_), and the spots in the primary wings of\r\n_Xylina Polyodon_ and affinities[1094].\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _SYMBOLS._\r\n\r\n  Male ♂.

Ap. Angl._ i. _t._ v. _f._ 8. _b, c._\r\n\r\n[1078] We use this term because _subcrosa_ is employed in a quite\r\ndifferent sense.\r\n\r\n[1079] We restrict the term _Figure_, to the shape of a _superficies_.\r\n\r\n[1080] The term _falcate_ has usually been applied to signify this\r\nfigure, as well as that to which we have restricted it; but as the\r\ntruncate and sharp extremity forms a striking difference, we thought\r\nit best to invent a new term.\r\n\r\n[1081] We have departed from the more usual definition of\r\n_trapezoid_, \"An irregular figure whose four sides are not parallel,\"\r\nbecause the above is best suited to forms in insects.\r\n\r\n[1082] We use this term to denote the shape of solid bodies.\r\n\r\n[1083] The word employed in Botany to denote a Polygon is\r\n_prismatical_; but since, properly defined, this term is synonymous\r\nwith _triquetrous_, we thought it best to use an adjective derived\r\nfrom _prismoid_, which implies a body that approaches to prismatical.\r\n\r\n[1084] This term in _Anatomy_ denotes any unnatural protuberance\r\nor convexity of the body, as a person hunched, or hump-backed. In\r\n_Astronomy_ it is used in reference to the enlightened parts of the\r\nmoon, whilst she is moving from the first quarter to the full, and from\r\nthe full to the last quarter; for all that time the dark part appears\r\nhorned or falcated, and the light one hunched out, convex or gibbous.\r\n\r\n[1085] We employ the term _æquatus_ instead of _æqualis_ commonly\r\nused in this sense, because _æqualis_ is also applied to magnitude,\r\nto which we would restrict it.\r\n\r\n[1086] I do not find in Schönherr (_Curculionid. Method. Disp._) any\r\ngenus or subgenus of Rhyncophorous beetles the characters of which\r\ncorrespond with those of the insect here alluded to, which I once\r\nthought might be a _Cyphus_ Germ. but it is not.

To this genus _Curculio\r\nTribulus_ and _quadridens_ appear to belong.\r\n\r\n[1089] This kind of pubescence has usually been denominated sericeous\r\n(_sericea_); but it certainly does not resemble _silk_; and is\r\nvery different from the proper sericeous splendour, exhibited by\r\n_Cryptocephalus sericeus_.\r\n\r\n[1090] _Mon.

System is a subject which has engaged the attention of\r\nNaturalists from the time of Aristotle to the present day; and even\r\nnow that it has been so much and so ably discussed, they are far from\r\nbeing agreed concerning it. In our own country a clue has, however,\r\nof late been furnished, which upon the whole seems better calculated\r\nto enable us to thread the intricate labyrinth of nature, than any\r\nthing previously excogitated.\r\n\r\nThere are two words relating to this subject concerning which\r\nNaturalists seem not to have very precise ideas--_Method_ and _System_.\r\nThey have often been confounded and used indifferently to signify\r\nthe same thing. Thus we hear of a Natural Method and a Natural\r\nSystem. Linné seems to have regarded the _former_ of these terms as\r\nrepresenting the actual disposition of objects in nature[1126], while\r\nby _System_ he understands their classification and arrangement by\r\nNaturalists[1127]. But if we consider their real meaning,--a _Method_\r\nshould signify an _Artificial_, and a _System_ a _Natural_ arrangement\r\nof objects[1128]. As many systematists, however, have aimed at giving\r\na _natural_ arrangement, though with various success,--some, as the\r\nFrench school, (to which we are principally indebted for the progress\r\nalready made,) approximating nearer to the true idea than others,--and\r\nnone having a _perfect_ conception of it, of which probably in our\r\npresent state, our minds, from its intricacy, are incapable,--it\r\nmight perhaps be as well to call every arrangement whose object is\r\nconfessedly artificial, a _Method_; and that which aims at the plan of\r\nnature, a _System_. Under this view system-makers would be divided into\r\ntwo classes,--the _Methodists_ and _Systematists_.\r\n\r\nThe system of nature, which we are now to consider, may be viewed\r\nunder a double aspect; for with regard to all created objects there\r\nis a _System_ of _Distribution_, and a _System_ of _Correlation_,\r\nwhich appear to be quite independent of each other. The former will\r\nbest fall under our notice when we are treating of the _Geography_ of\r\ninsects: I shall therefore now confine myself to the latter.\r\n\r\nWhen the ALMIGHTY CREATOR willed to bring into existence this mundane\r\nsystem, he formed it according to a preconcerted plan, with all its\r\nparts beautifully linked together and mutually corresponding. All\r\nthings were ordered in _measure_, and _number_, and _weight_[1129].\r\nThere was nothing deficient, nothing superfluous; but the whole in\r\nthe strictest sense \"was very good[1130],\" and calculated in the\r\nhighest degree to answer the purpose of its GREAT AUTHOR. I call\r\nit a system of _Correlation_, because there is discernible in it,\r\nin the first place, a concatenation of its parts, by which, as to\r\ntheir forms and uses, objects are linked together in groups by a\r\nchain of affinities; so that we pass from one to the other by gentle\r\ngradations, without having to overleap any _wide_ interval. We see\r\nalso a gradual ascent from low to high, from less to more excellent.\r\nAnd this leads us to another kind of relationship between natural\r\nobjects, by which, though placed in distinct groups or in a different\r\nseries, they in some sort represent and symbolize each other.\r\nExamples of this relationship by analogy are to be found in every\r\nkingdom of nature, and often form an ascending series from the lowest\r\nto the highest; for, as we shall see hereafter, these resemblances\r\nappear to maintain a certain correspondence with each other as to\r\ntheir relative situations; so that, for instance, in the animal\r\nkingdom they ascend step by step, without being linked by affinity or\r\nhaving any real juxtaposition, from the lowest groups, towards man,\r\nwho stands alone at the head, or in the centre of all.--I shall say\r\nsomething on each of these kinds of relationship.\r\n\r\nI. The relation of _affinity_ may be considered as to its _series_\r\nand _groups_. A series, of course, consists of parts either\r\n_concatenated_ like a chain, or placed _separately_ at small\r\nintervals from each other. It may run either in a right line, or\r\ndeviate from it in various ways. It appears to be the opinion of most\r\nmodern Physiologists, that the series of affinities in nature is a\r\n_concatenated_ or continuous series; and that though an _hiatus_\r\nis here and there observable, this has been caused either by the\r\nannihilation of some original group or species in consequence of some\r\ngreat convulsion of nature, or that the objects required to fill it\r\nup are still in existence but have not yet been discovered[1131]: and\r\nthis opinion is founded on a _dictum_ of Linné, _Natura ... saltus\r\nnon facit_[1132]. If this dictum be liberally interpreted, according\r\nto the evident meaning of the word _saltus_, few will be disposed to\r\nobject to it; since both observation and analogy combine to prove\r\nthat there must be a regular approximation of things to each other in\r\nthe works of God; and that could we see the whole according to his\r\noriginal plan, we should find no _violent_ interval to break up that\r\napproximation: but if it be contended, that in this plan there is no\r\ndifference in the juxtaposition of the nearest groups or individuals,\r\nand never any interval between them, I think we are going further\r\nthan either observation or analogy will warrant. Were this really\r\nand strictly the case, it seems to follow that every group or\r\nindividual species must on one side borrow half its characters from\r\nthe _preceding_ group or species, and on the other impart half to the\r\n_succeeding_[1133]. But one of the most evident laws of creation is\r\n_variety_; and if we survey all the works of the MOST HIGH, we shall\r\nno where discover that kind of order and symmetry that this strict\r\ninterpretation implies. The general march of nature therefore seems\r\nto say, that there must be _varying_ though not _violent_ intervals\r\nin the series of beings: or in other words, some _conterminous_\r\nspecies or groups have more characters in common than others.\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of Bonnet (in this field himself a host) and many\r\nother Naturalists, that the series of beings was not only continuous,\r\nbut _undeviating_, ascending in a _direct_ line from the lowest to\r\nthe highest[1134]. Others, finding that this theory could not be\r\nmade to accord with the actual state of things in nature, thought\r\nthat a scale of the kingdoms of nature must represent a _map_ or\r\n_net_[1135]; thus abandoning a continuous series: and Lamarck, as\r\nwas before observed[1136], for the solution of the difficulty,\r\narranged Invertebrate animals in a double subramose one. Mr. W. S.\r\nMacLeay and (without consultation nearly at the same time) Professor\r\nAgardh, Mr. Fries, &c. have given to the learned world an opinion\r\nwhich approximates more nearly to what we see in nature: viz. That\r\nthe arrangement of objects is indeed in a continuous series, but\r\nwhich in its progress forms various convolutions, each of which\r\nmay be represented by a _circle_, or a series that returns into\r\nitself[1137]. According to this opinion,--which seems the most\r\nconsistent of any yet advanced, and which reconciles facts which\r\nupon no other plan can be reconciled,--the series of beings is\r\ninvolved in the highest degree, rolling wheel within wheel _ad\r\ninfinitum_, and revolving, if I may so speak, round its centre and\r\nsummit--_man_[1138]: who, though not including in himself all that\r\ndistinguishes them, is still the great Archetype in which they\r\nterminate, and from which they degrade on all sides.\r\n\r\nIt is by this convolving series that the various _groups_ into\r\nwhich the kingdoms of nature seem resolvable are formed. We are\r\ninstructed by the highest authority that every thing was created\r\n\"after its kind;\" and the common sense of mankind in all ages has\r\nimposed classic, generic, and other names implying sections, as\r\nwell as specific ones, upon natural objects: and though many modern\r\nPhysiologists have asserted that species form the only _absolute_\r\ndivision in nature; yet as all seem to allow that there are _groups_,\r\nand many that these are represented by a circle or group returning\r\ninto itself[1139], the most absolute division in nature, we will\r\nnot contend for a term[1140]. We now come to consider these groups\r\nthemselves, and may notice them under various denominations.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to consider all the substances of which our globe\r\nconsists as divided into _three_ kingdoms,--the _Mineral_,\r\n_Vegetable_, and _Animal_; but strictly speaking the _primary_\r\ndivision is into organized and inorganized matter; the former\r\nresolving itself into the two kingdoms last mentioned. These, like\r\nEngland and Scotland of old, have their \"Land Debateable;\" occupied\r\nby those _Productions moyennes_, (to use a term of Bonnet's[1141],)\r\nwhich are as it were partly animal and partly vegetable. From this\r\nterritory common to both, the two kingdoms are extended in a nearly\r\nparallel direction till they reach their extreme limits, without\r\nany incursion from either side upon their mutual boundaries, but\r\neach showing its kindred with the other by certain resemblances\r\nobservable between _opposite_ points; so that valley corresponds with\r\nvalley, mountain with mountain, river with river, sea with sea[1142];\r\nnot, however, so as to form an exact counterpart, but only in some\r\ngeneral features. But to leave metaphor;--as the vegetable kingdom\r\nis distinguished from the mineral by its organization and life, by\r\nits circulation of sap, and by its powers of reproduction by seed\r\nor otherwise; so is the animal from the vegetable by its powers of\r\nvolition and locomotion[1143], by its nervous systems and organs of\r\nsensation, and the senses to which they minister, by its muscular\r\nirritability, and by its instinctive endowments.\r\n\r\nHaving made these observations with regard to the primary division\r\nof natural objects in general,--what I have further to say will be\r\nconfined to the _animal_ kingdom, and ultimately to the branch of\r\nwhich we are treating.\r\n\r\ni. Lamarck divided the animal kingdom into two _provinces_, or\r\n_subkingdoms_ as they are now called; the one consisting of all those\r\nanimals whose skeleton is _internal_ and built upon a vertebral\r\ncolumn, which are denominated _Vertebrates_; and the second, of those\r\nwhose skeleton or its representative is for the most part _external_,\r\nincluding the muscles,--these are called _Invertebrates_[1144].\r\nThough this distinction is so marked as in general to form a most\r\nstriking characteristic, yet when these two provinces approach\r\neach other, it begins to disappear. Thus the vertebral column,\r\nforming one piece with the shell[1145], becomes almost _external_\r\nin the Chelonian reptiles, or tortoises and turtles, and almost\r\ndisappears in the cyclostomous fishes; and there is the beginning\r\nof an _internal_ one in the _Cephalopoda_, or cuttle-fish belonging\r\nto the Invertebrates. Dr. Virey, assuming the nervous system as his\r\nbasis, long since divided the animal kingdom, without assigning\r\nnames to them, into _three_ subkingdoms[1146]; M. Cuvier has\r\n_four_--_Vertebrata_; _Mollusca_; _Articulata_; _Radiata_[1147]:\r\nand Mr. MacLeay, finding _five_ variations of that system, divides\r\nanimals into _five_ provinces or subkingdoms, of which I formerly\r\ngave you some account[1148];--viz. _Vertebrata_, in which the\r\nnervous system has only one principal centre; _Annulosa_, in which\r\nit is ganglionic, with the ganglions arranged in a series, with a\r\ndouble spinal chord; _Mollusca_, in which it is ganglionic, with the\r\nganglions dispersed irregularly but connected by nervous threads;\r\n_Radiata_, in which it is _filamentous_, with the nervous threads\r\nradiating from the mouth; and _Acrita_, in which this system is\r\n_molecular_[1149]. And to this division of the kingdom, as founded on\r\na satisfactory basis, I should recommend you to adhere: still however\r\nwe may speak of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, as forming the\r\n_primary_ subdivision of them, taken from a striking character and\r\nobvious to every one who sees them.\r\n\r\nIf you inquire into the rank of each of these subkingdoms, of course\r\nyou will assign the principal station to the _Vertebrates_, which\r\nare the most perfectly organized, to which _man_ belongs, and over\r\nwhich he immediately presides. If we form the scale according to\r\nthe nervous system of each province, that in which the organ of\r\nsensation and intellect is most concentrated will stand first; and\r\nin proportion as this organ is multiplied and dispersed will be the\r\nstation of the rest, which will place them in the order in which I\r\nhave mentioned them; and the _Annulosa_, to which insects belong,\r\nwill precede the _Mollusca_, which Cuvier and Lamarck had placed\r\nbefore them on account of their system of circulation. But when\r\nwe reflect that a _heart_ and _circulation_ occur in some of the\r\nconglomerate _Polypi_[1150], animals that approach the _vegetable_\r\nkingdom; that some of the acephalous _Mollusca_ have no visible\r\norgans of sense, except that of taste, whose substance is little\r\nbetter than a homogeneous gelatinous pulp, and who seem from their\r\ninert nature to have very slight powers of voluntary motion[1151], we\r\nshall be convinced that a heart and circulation alone, unaccompanied\r\nby a more concentrated nervous system and more perfect structure,\r\ncannot place an animal above those which in every other respect so\r\nobviously excel them. With regard to _insects_ particularly, we may\r\nfurther ask--Who that considers how man employs his powers and organs\r\neven in his most degraded state, or that contemplates the wonderful\r\nworks that he is enabled to accomplish when his faculties receive\r\ntheir due cultivation and direction, can avoid regarding him as\r\nsuperior to the rest of the animal creation? And what unsophisticated\r\nmind, not entangled in the trammels of system, when it surveys the\r\nindustry, the various proceedings, and almost miraculous works that\r\nhave been laid before you, the waxen palaces of the bee,--the paper\r\ncottages of the wasp and hornet,--the crowded metropolis of the\r\nwhite ants,--the arts, the manufactures, and stratagems of other\r\ninsects,--the associations and labours for the common good of those\r\nthat are gregarious;--will not at once conclude that they must be a\r\nsuperior race to the slug, the snail, and others, which live only to\r\neat and propagate their kind?\r\n\r\nOr who, that considers the wonderful structure of the animals whose\r\ncause I advocate,--the analogy that exists between their organs of\r\nmanducation, of motion, and of sensation, and between various other\r\nparts of it[1152], with those of the higher animals,--the acuteness\r\nof their senses, their wonderful strength of muscle[1153], and\r\npowers of locomotion[1154],--but will think them superior to the\r\nheadless and almost inanimate oyster or muscle, or the conglomerate\r\n_Alcyonia_, though they have a heart and circulation?\r\n\r\nWho again, that observes that in proportion as pedate animals\r\napproach to the human type, their motions are accomplished by fewer\r\norgans,--that man walks _ore sublimi_ upon _two_ legs; the majority\r\nof quadrupeds upon _four_; insects upon _six_: the _Arachnida_\r\napparently upon _eight_; most _Crustacea_ upon _ten_; and the\r\n_Myriapods_ and others upon _many_,--but will thence conclude that\r\ninsects must precede the _Arachnida_ and _Crustacea_?\r\n\r\nWho, once more, that reflects that if any of the superior animals are\r\ndeprived of a limb it can never be reproduced, and that in insects\r\nthe same circumstance occurs; while spiders and _Crustacea_ if they\r\nlose a leg have the power of reproducing it, and the _Mollusca_ if\r\nthey are decapitated can gain a new head,--will consent to their\r\nbeing placed after any of these animals[1155]?\r\n\r\nLastly, who that recollects that the _Mollusca_ are hermaphrodites,\r\nlike most plants, bearing both male and female organs in the same\r\nbody,--but will allow that insects, in which the sexes are separate as\r\nin the Vertebrates, must be more perfect, and of a higher grade[1156]?\r\n\r\nii. We now come to the _Classes_ into which the _Annulosa_ are divided.\r\nThis term appears first to have been employed by Tournefort, and was\r\nadopted by Linné[1157]. As the nervous system of animals furnishes\r\nthe most prominent distinction of a subkingdom, so the _circulation_\r\nof their fluids, and their _respiration_ necessarily connected with\r\nit, seems best to point out the _classes_ into which it may next be\r\nresolved. But having fully explained my ideas on this subject in a\r\nformer letter, I need not here repeat what I then said[1158].\r\n\r\niii. As we have subkingdoms, so we may also have _subclasses_,\r\nor such large divisions of a class--not founded upon internal\r\norganization or any of the primary vital functions, but upon\r\ndifferent modes of taking their food, or such other _secondary_\r\ncharacters--as include more than one _Order_. To this description\r\nClairville's _Mandibulata_ and _Haustellata_ appear to me to belong,\r\nwhich I think are by no means entitled to the rank of Classes; for\r\nwhoever compares these two tribes together will at the first glance\r\nbe convinced, by the numerous characters they possess in common,\r\nnotwithstanding the different mode in which they take their food,\r\nthat they form one connected primary group. This circumstance,\r\ntherefore, only furnishes a clue for their further subdivision into\r\ntwo secondary groups, separated by distinctions certainly of a lower\r\nvalue than those which separate the _Crustacea_ and _Arachnida_ from\r\n_Insecta_. This is further confirmed by the variations that take\r\nplace in their mode of feeding in their different states; some from\r\nmasticators becoming suctorious (_Lepidoptera_), and others from\r\nbeing suctorious becoming masticators (_Myrmeleon_, _Dytiscus_,\r\n&c.),--which shows that this character does not enter the essential\r\nidea of the animal.\r\n\r\niv. Next to Classes and Subclasses we are to consider those groups\r\nof insects that are denominated _Orders_. The characters of these at\r\nfirst were taken principally from the instruments of flight or the\r\nabsence of them; and the name appropriated to each Order by Linné,\r\nafter Aristotle, had reference to this circumstance. But this alone\r\ndoes not afford characters sufficiently discriminating: for though\r\nto an accurate observer a difference in these organs appears to be\r\ncharacteristic of most of the Orders, yet in some it is not easily\r\ndetected or defined. In the _Neuroptera_ there are as many different\r\ntypes of wings as there are of tribes or suborders. So that it\r\nseems not possible so to construct the definition of every Order,\r\nas to take its character from the organs of flight alone. Linné was\r\nsensible of this, and was compelled to have recourse to subsidiary\r\ncharacters in the majority of his: his observation therefore with\r\nregard to _Genera_,--that the character does not give the genus, but\r\nthe genus the character[1159],--applies equally to _Orders_; and the\r\ncharacters included in the definition of an Order, should be the\r\nresult of a careful examination of its component groups.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion I named to you the Orders into which it\r\nappeared to me the Class _Insecta_ might be divided[1160]; they were\r\nthese. _Coleoptera_; _Strepsiptera_; _Dermaptera_; _Orthoptera_;\r\n_Hemiptera_; _Trichoptera_; _Lepidoptera_; _Neuroptera_;\r\n_Hymenoptera_; _Diptera_: _Aphaniptera_; _Aptera_. I then briefly\r\nexplained them merely for the sake of illustration, and that you\r\nmight know what description of insects were meant when these Orders\r\nwere mentioned in my letters, without intending to affirm that I had\r\narranged them in a natural series, or that all of them were perfectly\r\nnatural. I shall now consider them separately, and conclude with\r\ngiving my sentiments as to which should be placed first.\r\n\r\n\r\n       * _ORDERS in which the ordinary Trophi all occur, or the_\r\n                Mouth _is_ perfect[1161]. (_Mandibulata._)\r\n\r\n1. COLEOPTERA[1162] (_Eleutherata_ F.). Aristotle may be called the\r\nfounder of this Order, since he both named and defined it[1163].\r\nBoth his name and definition were adopted by Linné; and the former\r\n(with the exception of Fabricius and his school) by all succeeding\r\nEntomologists. To his definition _Wings in a sheath_[1164], other\r\ncharacters have been added; as the folding of the wings, and the\r\nstraight suture by which the elytra are united[1165]. Aristotle's\r\ncharacter, though to be found in the great majority of the Order,\r\nis not universal, since there are some beetles that have neither\r\nwings nor sheath, as the female glow-worm; and many that though\r\nthey have the sheath have no wings, as _Meloe_, many _Carabi_, &c.\r\nTo the transverse folding of the wings there are also exceptions;\r\nas in _Buprestis_, _Molorchus_, &c. The straight suture by which\r\none elytrum exactly coincides with the other without lapping\r\nover, fails in _Meloe_: so that no one of these characters can be\r\ncalled universal in the Order; but as an exception or two does not\r\ninvalidate a rule, and these are sufficiently universal for the\r\npurpose of pointing it out, they may be retained. Perhaps it will be\r\nan improvement to add the kind of the _metamorphosis_, which, as far\r\nas known, prevails universally.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ incomplete[1166].\r\n\r\n       _Legs_ inosculating, posterior coxæ usually transverse.\r\n\r\n       _Elytra_ corneous, or coriaceous, without veins, united\r\n         by a straight suture, so as mostly to cover the wings\r\n         completely[1167].\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ longitudinally and transversely folded[1168]:\r\n         _neuration_ simple[1169].\r\n\r\n2. STREPSIPTERA[1170] (_Rhiphiptera_ Latr.) The characters of this\r\nOrder were first given in the _Linnean Transactions_, and it has been\r\nadopted by Latreille, who however, without sufficient reason, has\r\nchanged the name originally imposed to _Rhiphiptera_[1171]. Rossi,\r\nwho was the first that discovered an insect of this Order, concluded\r\nthat because it was parasitic it must be _Hymenopterous_; and it is\r\ncertainly more nearly related to that Order than to the _Diptera_,\r\namongst which M. Lamarck has arranged it, and with which it has no\r\ncharacter in common, except having two wings. This is one of those\r\nOrders, consisting of few genera and species, which, from their\r\nconnecting two circles, Mr. MacLeay has called _osculant_, who places\r\nit between the _Hymenoptera_ and _Coleoptera_[1172].\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ subincomplete[1173]?\r\n\r\n       _Pseudelytra_ twisted, attached to the anterior leg[1174].\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ not covered by the elytra, longitudinally folded,\r\n         forming nearly the quadrant of a circle[1175]: _neuration_\r\n         simple.\r\n\r\n       _Anus_ styliferous[1176].\r\n\r\n3. DERMAPTERA[1177] (_Ulonota_ F. _Orthoptera_ Oliv.). This is\r\nanother osculant Order, evidently connecting the _Coleoptera_ with\r\nthe _Orthoptera_. The elytra are of a coriaceous substance, have\r\na straight suture, and are not veined, and the wings are folded\r\nlongitudinally as well as transversely,--circumstances which connect\r\nit with the former Order,--while the shape of its wings, its oral\r\norgans, and its metamorphosis, show its affinity to the latter.\r\nIt was established at the same time and in the same work with the\r\npreceding Order, in pursuance of a suggestion of Dr. Leach, and\r\nconsists solely of the Linnean genus _Forficula_.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ semicomplete.\r\n\r\n       _Elytra_ coriaceous, without veins, united by a straight\r\n         suture, so as partly to cover the wings.\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ longitudinally and transversely folded, each forming\r\n         nearly the quadrant of a circle: _neuration_ radiating[1178].\r\n\r\n       _Anus_ forcipate.\r\n\r\n4. ORTHOPTERA[1179] (_Ulonota_ F.). This Order, which Linné at first\r\nregarded as belonging to the _Coleoptera_[1180], and afterwards\r\nimproperly added to the suctorious _Hemiptera_, was very judiciously\r\nseparated from both by De Geer, under the name of _Dermaptera_,\r\na name not improper, and which ought to have been retained. Its\r\npresent name was, I believe, assigned to it by Olivier; and as this\r\nis generally in use, I shall not attempt to disturb it. Dr. Leach\r\ndivided the Order into two, separating the _Blattina_ from it, under\r\nthe name of _Dictyoptera_[1181]. He was led to this by the tegmina\r\ndecussating or lapping obliquely over each other, whereas in the\r\nrest the horizontal portion of one tegmen lies longitudinally over\r\nthat of the other; he also probably took their depressed body into\r\nconsideration;--these circumstances, however, rather indicate a\r\n_tribe_ or suborder; and as such Mr. MacLeay regards it.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ semicomplete.\r\n\r\n       _Legs_ suspended.\r\n\r\n       _Tegmina_ generally pergameneous[1182], reticulated with\r\n         nervures, more or less incumbent, covering the wings.\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ longitudinally folded, ample: _neuration_ reticulated.\r\n\r\n5. NEUROPTERA[1183] (_Synistata_, _Odonota_ F.). Of all the Linnean\r\nOrders this appears to consist of the most discordant tribes; so\r\nthat it seems next to impossible to construct a definition that\r\nwill include them all, unless indeed we admit M. Latreille's idea,\r\nadopted by Mr. MacLeay[1184], that a varied metamorphosis is its\r\nessential character; or, to speak more largely, variety itself\r\nseems the characteristic of the insects composing it, in every\r\nstate; and there is scarcely a common distinctive character in their\r\nperfect state, upon detecting which in any individual you may\r\nexclaim--This is a Neuropterous insect. The only one that I have\r\nbeen enabled to seize is, that their _scapulæ_ and _parapleuræ_\r\nare parallel and placed obliquely[1185]. Whether, with all this\r\npuzzling variation and dissonance between the different tribes of\r\nwhich it is now composed, this Order can be considered as a natural\r\ngroup, in the present state of our knowledge it would be rash to\r\ndecide. I shall observe, however, that the _Libellulina_,--whether\r\nwe regard their metamorphosis and the singular character before\r\ndescribed that distinguishes their larva and pupa[1186], their oral\r\ninstruments[1187], the remarkable position of their legs[1188], their\r\ngeneral form, the wonderful and peculiar machinery by which their\r\nwings are moved[1189], and other circumstances of their internal\r\nanatomy,--if any are to be regarded as forming a separate Order, are\r\nthe first entitled to that distinction. At present, with our friend\r\nMr. MacLeay, I shall consider it as not further divisible, and as\r\nconsisting of five principal forms. I must not omit to observe, that\r\nin the _Ephemerina_ the parts of the mouth, except the labrum and\r\npalpi, appear to be mere rudiments[1190].\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ varying. _Larva_ a hexapod.\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ four in most, and reticulated with numerous areolets.\r\n\r\n       _Prothorax_ distinct.\r\n\r\n       _Scapulæ_ and _Parapleuræ_ parallel and oblique.\r\n\r\n       _Tail_ of the female without a terebrant, or pungent\r\n         multivalve ovipositor[1191].\r\n\r\n6. HYMENOPTERA[1192] (_Piezata_ F.). Mr. MacLeay considers _Sirex_\r\nL. as being osculant between the Order we are now entering upon and\r\nthe _Trichoptera_, and _Tenthredo_, L. as belonging to the latter.\r\nHe appears to ground this opinion chiefly upon a consideration of\r\ntheir larvæ and a slight difference in their ovipositor. As the\r\nOrder, as settled by Linné, has always been deemed one of the most\r\nnatural ones, and all the great Entomologists of the present æra have\r\nagreed with him in thinking it so; it seems to me that to prove them\r\nmistaken in this opinion, the question should have been discussed\r\nat more length, and that it requires arguments of more weight than\r\nany Mr. MacLeay has at present produced to set it aside. He appears\r\nin general to lay great stress upon an agreement in larvæ and the\r\nkind of metamorphosis; and I am ready to acknowledge that it forms a\r\nstrong _presumption_ in favour of any hypothesis of affinity between\r\ncertain tribes. But when it is had recourse to as fundamental and\r\ninfallible, I think it is pushed far beyond what it will bear, or\r\nis warrantable. I may be wrong; but in my apprehension, a striking\r\nagreement in their general structure in the _perfect_ state, which is\r\nthe acme of their nature, affords a much more satisfactory reason for\r\nkeeping two tribes together, than any difference observable in their\r\nlarvæ or metamorphosis, for separating them. Let any one compare the\r\nstructure of these two tribes with the _Trichoptera_ on one side, and\r\nthe _Hymenoptera_ on the other, and it will require but a glance to\r\nconvince him of their greater affinity to the latter; and the simple\r\ninspection only of Jurine's plates of the wings of _Hymenoptera_ is\r\ncalculated to produce the same effect. With regard to their _larvæ_,\r\nthe resemblance between the case-worms and the pseudo-caterpillars\r\nof the saw-flies seems to me very distant, and the numerous prolegs\r\nof the latter have scarcely a legitimate representative in the\r\nformer. The larvæ of the genus _Lyda_ lose the prolegs intirely,\r\nand in one species, which much resembles the vermiform larvæ of\r\n_Hymenoptera_, the real legs are so extremely short as to be scarcely\r\ndiscernible[1193]; so that it requires no great stretch of faith to\r\nbelieve that saw-flies or _Sirices_ may exist in whose larvæ the legs\r\ndisappear[1194]. But it is this very tribe, whose larvæ thus approach\r\nto those of the other _Hymenoptera_, in which Mr. MacLeay finds the\r\ngreatest external resemblance to the _Trichoptera_[1195]. In fact the\r\ndifference between the saw-flies and _Siricidæ_, and the remainder\r\nof the _Hymenoptera_, amounts to little more than what takes place\r\nin the _Diptera_ Order between the _Tipulidæ_, _Asilidæ_, _Muscidæ_,\r\n&c., in which also the _metamorphosis_ differs.\r\n\r\nAnother argument upon which Mr. MacLeay seems to lay some stress,\r\nis taken from the number of parts into which the _ovipositor_ of\r\nthe saw-flies is resolvable, which he finds to consist of _four_\r\npieces; while in what he considers as the genuine _Hymenoptera_, it\r\nis formed only of _three_[1196]: but in fact, in these last there\r\nare _two_ spiculæ, answering to the two saws of _Tenthredo_, so that\r\nthe vagina in which these move may be considered as a _double_\r\nsheath: only, as these were to be pushed out at the _same_ time,\r\nand the others _alternately_, it was necessary that in the latter\r\neach sheath should be separate, to admit of this motion; but as to\r\nits composition, the weapon in both is essentially the same. At any\r\nrate this structure could furnish a reason only for the formation of\r\na separate group in the _same_ Order, but none for the transfer of\r\nsuch group to _another_, which had no such instrument at all; since,\r\nas we have seen, the _Trichoptera_ extrude their eggs at once in a\r\nmass[1197]. I do not mean, however, that it should be inferred from\r\nwhat I have here said, that there is no _tendency_ in the saw-flies\r\ntowards a Trichopterous type, for in them nature seems pointing that\r\nway, but the distance is too great, and the number of types of form\r\nnecessary to fill up the interval too many, to warrant in my opinion\r\ntheir removal from the one Order to the other.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ incomplete[1198].\r\n\r\n       _Trophi_ in most not used for mastication[1199].\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ four: _neuration_ generally areolate[1200].\r\n\r\n       _Prothorax_ obsolete, giving place to an ample collar.\r\n\r\n       _Tarsi_ pentamerous.\r\n\r\n       _Ovipositor_ 5-6-valved, the vagina darting forth two\r\n         retroserrulate spiculæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      ** _ORDERS in which all the ordinary Trophi do_ not _occur,\r\n            or the_ Mouth _is_ imperfect[1201] (_Haustellata_).\r\n\r\n7. HEMIPTERA[1202] (_Ryngota_ F.). Linné at first confined this Order\r\nto those insects which have a _promuscis_, which he denominated a\r\n_rostrum_[1203]; but afterwards, convinced that the _Orthoptera_ of\r\nthe moderns could not be associated properly with the _Coleoptera_;\r\ninstead of forming them into a distinct Order, as nature would\r\nhave dictated--perhaps to avoid the multiplication of Orders and\r\nwithout altering his definition--with equal infelicity he added\r\nthem to this. Subsequent Entomologists, who saw the impropriety of\r\nmasticating insects thus herding with suctorious ones, restricted the\r\nOrder to its old limits; but Latreille very judiciously altered its\r\narrangement, and divided it into two Sections, separating those whose\r\nhemelytra terminate in membrane, from those in which they are mostly\r\ntegmina, or of a substance intermediate between that of the elytra\r\nof _Coleoptera_ and that of the wings of the Tetrapterous Orders.\r\nHe denominated the first of these sections, or rather suborders,\r\n_Heteroptera_, and the last _Homoptera_[1204]. Dr. Leach, observing\r\nthat very considerable differences take place both in the economy\r\nand structure of Heteropterous and Homopterous insects, followed De\r\nGeer in considering them as separate Orders, which he has called\r\n_Hemiptera_ and _Omoptera_, and in which he has been followed by\r\nMr. MacLeay; who, however, with his usual accuracy and judgment,\r\nhas restored the aspirate to the latter name[1205]. Their agreement\r\nin having a _promuscis_, or instrument of suction, with a jointed\r\nsheath, at present induces me to hesitate as to the propriety of\r\ntheir separation, and to consider them as forming _secondary_ rather\r\nthan _primary_ sections of the Class. That you may be enabled to\r\njudge for yourself upon this subject, I will state the principal\r\nfeatures in which they differ. In the first place, the Heteropterous\r\nsection usually sucks the juices of _animals_, and the Homopterous,\r\nthose of _plants_; in the former, the _Hemelytra_, besides their\r\ndifferent substance, as well as the wings, cross each other; while\r\nin the latter, the organs of flight are deflexed, and do not lap\r\nover each other at all. The antennæ also of the one are often long,\r\nand do not terminate in a _bristle_; while in the other, with few\r\nexceptions, they are very short and setigerous. In the _Heteroptera_\r\nthe body is depressed and flat, in the _Homoptera_ convex and thick.\r\nIn the former, the scutellum is one of the principal features of the\r\ntrunk; in the latter, not at all remarkable[1206]. Other differences\r\nin the structure, both of head, trunk, and abdomen, might be pointed\r\nout; but these you will chiefly find noticed in my letters on the\r\nExternal Anatomy of Insects, where I treated of those parts. I shall\r\nhere, therefore, only further mention the ovipositor also as forming\r\na most striking distinction[1207].\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ semicomplete in almost all.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ promuscidate[1208].\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ covered by _Hemelytra_ or _Tegmina_[1209].\r\n\r\n       _Tarsi_ mostly trimerous, rarely dimerous or monomerous[1210].\r\n\r\n8. TRICHOPTERA[1211] Kirby (_Synistata_ F. _Neuroptera_ Latr.).\r\nMM. Latreille and MacLeay are of opinion that _Semblis_ F. and\r\n_Phryganea_ L. ought to be associated in the _same_ group; and the\r\nlatter gentleman has backed his opinion by some apparently cogent\r\narguments[1212]: there are others, however, that seem to me more\r\ncogent, for considering them as belonging to _different_ Orders.\r\nWhoever examines the several tribes into which Mr. MacLeay has\r\ndivided the _Neuroptera_, will observe in all of them a distinct\r\n_prothorax_, a circumstance which they possess in common with those\r\nOrders that use their mandibles for _mastication_; whereas in those\r\nthat do _not_ use them for mastication, as the _Hymenoptera_, or\r\nthat take their food by suction, this part is replaced by a mostly\r\nnarrow collar, forming a part of the alitrunk[1213]. The existence\r\nthen of the _prothorax_ in the _Perlidæ_, and of the _collar_ in\r\nthe _Trichoptera_, affords no slight presumptive evidence that\r\nthey belong to different Orders. Another circumstance that weighs\r\nmuch with me is, that the type of the neuration of the wings\r\nin _Perla_ is taken from the _Neuroptera_, in the _Trichoptera_\r\nfrom the _Lepidoptera_; the same observation extends to the legs\r\nof both[1214], and likewise to the abdomen. Even in their oral\r\norgans, as far at least as relates to their mandibles, those of\r\n_Perla_, though membranaceous--a circumstance occurring even\r\nin _Coleoptera_--are of a Neuropterous type; while the angular\r\ntermination of the cheeks in the _Phryganeæ_ approaches to the\r\nLepidopterous mandibular rudiments. The principal argument on which\r\nMr. MacLeay's opinion seems to rest, is, that the larvæ of both are\r\naquatic, and clothe themselves in cases formed of various materials:\r\nbut though this circumstance shows that they approximate in the\r\nsystem, it does not prove that they belong to the same order, since\r\nthe general habit and appearance of the two animals when arrived at\r\nperfection contravenes it. The larvæ of _Myrmeleon_ and of _Leptis\r\nVermileo_ form pitfalls of sand for their prey, and when they become\r\npupæ, cover themselves with it[1215]; but this in them does not even\r\nprove an affinity, but only an analogy. The larva of _Perla_ is\r\ncarnivorous[1216], that of _Phryganea_ mostly herbivorous[1217]: so\r\nthat they are not precisely similar in their habits. Whether they\r\nresemble each other _altogether_, in their form, does not clearly\r\nappear. The above reasons will, I trust, justify me for considering\r\nthem _at present_ as belonging to different Orders; but if further\r\ndiscoveries should confirm the opinion Mr. MacLeay espouses, I shall\r\nhave no hesitation in yielding to it.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ incomplete[1218].\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ emandibulate.\r\n\r\n       _Prothorax_ replaced by a collar.\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ four, upper pair mostly hairy, lower ample, folded:\r\n         _neuration_ branching.\r\n\r\n       _Anus_ without setæ. _Eggs_ extruded in a gelatinous\r\n         mass[1219].\r\n\r\n9. LEPIDOPTERA[1220] (_Glossata_ F.). Concerning this Order, no\r\ndifference of opinion exists amongst Entomologists. Besides the\r\nscales that cover their wings, they are distinguished by the\r\npeculiar instrument of suction formerly described: neither of these\r\ncharacters, however, is perfectly universal; some of the Order\r\n(_Nudaria_) having no scales upon their wings, and others being\r\nwithout any _antlia_ (_Aglossa_). Other peculiar characters are to be\r\nfound in them; for instance, the _patagia_, or tippets, that adorn\r\ntheir evanescent thorax[1221], and the _tegulæ_, or base-covers, of\r\na shape quite dissimilar to those of _Hymenoptera_, which cover and\r\ndefend the base of their wings[1222]. As in the last Order, their\r\nlegs are located all together with scarcely any space intervening\r\nbetween them; and they often agree also in their spurs.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ obtected[1223].\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ antliate[1224].\r\n\r\n       _Prothorax_ very short, covered by a pair of tippets.\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ four, covered partially or generally with minute\r\n         scales: _neuration_ branching, often with a central areolet.\r\n\r\n10. DIPTERA[1225] (_Antliata_ F.). This Order likewise appears indebted\r\nfor its name to the philosopher of Stagyra, who distinguishes the\r\nmembers of it from their counter-parts--the _Hymenoptera_--by their\r\nhaving an _oral_, while these have an _anal_ sting[1226]: and we may\r\nadd, that while the last, on account of their wonderful economy and\r\nthe benefits which by them PROVIDENCE confers upon mankind, have been\r\njustly regarded as the _princes_ of the winged insect world,--the\r\nformer, when we consider the filthy and disgusting habits of their\r\ngrubs, and the annoyance, both from their numbers and incessant\r\nassaults, of them, in their fly-state, may very properly be considered\r\nas its _canaille_. Almost all the tribes of _Hymenoptera_, from the\r\nsaw-flies to the ants, have their representatives in this Order. Though\r\nthe number of wings is its prominent feature, yet there are two-winged\r\ninsects in other Orders, as some _Ephemeræ_: and the _Eproboscidea_ of\r\nLatreille seem rather a kind of winged _Aptera_, if we consider their\r\n_trophi_, than real _Diptera_; or they may form an osculant group,\r\npartly winged and partly apterous, between the two. I have before\r\nremarked, that though, apparently, the insects of this Order have only\r\n_two_ wings, yet the under or secondary wings of the other Orders have\r\nin them their representative[1227]. Their poisers also, I formerly\r\nobserved to you, are probably more connected with their respiration\r\nthan with their flight[1228].\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ incomplete, or coarctate.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ proboscidate[1229].\r\n\r\n       _Prothorax_ replaced by a collar. _Sutures_ of the trunk\r\n         mostly spurious[1230].\r\n\r\n       _Wings_ two, with winglets attached to them: _neuration_\r\n         various[1231]. _Poisers._\r\n\r\n       _Tarsi_ pentamerous.\r\n\r\n       _Ovipositor_ various[1232].\r\n\r\n11. APHANIPTERA[1233] (_Aptera_ L. Lamarck. _Rhyngota_ F. _Suctoria_\r\nLatr.) This is an osculant Order, and is distinguished from the other\r\n_Aptera_ L. in undergoing a regular metamorphosis. The larva is\r\nvermiform, the pupa incomplete, and inclosed in a cocoon. Probably\r\nthe common flea and the chigoe would form distinct genera. The number\r\nof species of fleas is greater than has been supposed. I have been\r\ninformed that Dr. Leach is acquainted with fourteen British species\r\nalone. Besides their metamorphosis, they are distinguished from\r\nthe _Aptera_ by the number of segments into which their body is\r\ndivided, and by their pentamerous tarsi. Something like elytra and a\r\nscutellum appear to distinguish these insects.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ incomplete.\r\n\r\n       _Body_ apterous, compressed.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ rostrulate[1234].\r\n\r\n       _Tarsi_ pentamerous.\r\n\r\nWe are now come to those insects which, though they change their skin\r\nin their progress to their state of perfection, and some of them, as\r\nwe have seen[1235], gain additional segments and pairs of legs, yet\r\nnone of them acquire wings or wing-cases: these I have considered as\r\nforming one Order, under the denomination of\r\n\r\n12. APTERA[1236] (_Synistata_, _Antliata_, _Unogata_, _Mitosata_ F.).\r\nI do not give this as a _natural_ Order. Our knowledge, however,\r\nof the internal organization of its groups, is not at present\r\nsufficiently matured to warrant the formation of them into new\r\n_Classes_[1237]: till that is more fully ascertained, it seems to me\r\ntherefore best to consider these groups as forming three _Suborders_:\r\nthe _first_ consisting of the _Hexapods_; the _second_ of the\r\n_Octopods_; and the _third_ of the _Polypods_. It will be better, I\r\nthink, instead of giving a general character of the Order,--which\r\nprincipally consists in the insects composing it being _Apterous_, or\r\nnever acquiring organs of flight,--to define each of these groups.\r\n\r\n_Hexapods_ (_Ametabolia_ Leach, _Ametabola_ M^cL.). _Six_ legs may\r\nbe regarded as the natural number in _all_ the insect tribes[1238]:\r\nbut our business now is with those _Aptera_ whose body consists of\r\n_three_ greater segments, and which in none of their states have ever\r\nmore or less than _six_ legs, and consist of the three Linnean genera\r\n_Pediculus_, _Lepisma_, and _Podura_ (_Thysanura_ and _Anoplura_).\r\nSome of the mites (_Acarus_ L.) are hexapods, but their body has no\r\ndistinction of head, trunk, and abdomen. The metamorphosis of most\r\nfemale _Blattæ_, and of some other _Orthoptera_ that are apterous,\r\ncannot be regarded as materially different from that of the Hexapods.\r\nAmongst the _Anoplura_,--the _Pediculi_, or lice, are suctorious,\r\nand the _Nirmi_, or bird-lice, masticators,--a circumstance which in\r\nthem does not appear to indicate even a different Order, and proves\r\nthat undue stress ought not to be laid, independently of general\r\ncharacters, on the mode in which insects take their food.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ complete.\r\n\r\n       _Body_ consisting of three principal segments.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ perfect, or rostellate[1239].\r\n\r\n       _Antennæ_ distinct.\r\n\r\n       _Legs_ six, in every state.\r\n\r\n_Octopods._ This suborder consists of the _Trachean Arachnida_\r\nof Latreille, excluding the _Pycnogonida_; of the _Acaridea_,\r\n_Sironidea_, _Phalangidea_, and part of the _Scorpionidea_ of\r\nMr. MacLeay, and, with some exceptions, of the Linnean genera\r\n_Acarus_ and _Phalangium_. This last tribe (for with Linné, I\r\ninclude _Chelifer_ and _Obsidium_ in the _Phalangidea_,) on one\r\nside approaches _Scorpio_ by _Thelyphonus_, and on the other the\r\n_Aranidea_ by _Gonyleptes_; or, according to Mr. MacLeay, the\r\ntransit is to both by _Galeodes_[1240]. But as there is reason for\r\nthinking that this last belongs to the _Pulmonary Arachnida_[1241],\r\nand forms a peculiar type in that Class, I consider the transit\r\nfrom the one to the other as above stated. The folded abdomen of\r\n_Gonyleptes_ seems much to correspond with that of the _cancriform_\r\nspiders (_Carkinodes cancriformis_, &c.).\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ complete.\r\n\r\n       _Body_ consisting of one or two principal segments.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ various[1242].\r\n\r\n       _Antennæ_ obsolete, or represented by mandibles.\r\n\r\n       _Legs_ mostly eight, but in a few six only[1243].\r\n\r\n_Polypods._ This suborder consists of Dr. Leach's Class _Myriapoda_,\r\nor the _Chilognatha_ and _Chilopoda_ of Latreille, corresponding\r\nwith the Linnean genera _Iulus_ and _Scolopendra_. Mr. MacLeay has\r\narranged them in the same Class with the Hexapods, and connects\r\nthem with the _Anoplura_ by means of certain intestinal worms of an\r\nindistinct annulose structure[1244] (_Entozoa Nematoidea_ Rud.), in\r\nwhich the sexes are diœcious, and some of which are furnished with\r\nlateral spinulæ,--thus, as he supposes, connected with the Polypods;\r\nand with the _Anoplura_ by others (_Epizoaria_ Lam.) in which\r\nappendages appear somewhat analogous to the legs of Hexapods, as in\r\n_Cecrops_ Leach, and which like them are parasitic animals[1245].\r\nBut the right of these worms to be considered as members of the\r\nsame Class with the Hexapods and Polypods at present appears rather\r\nproblematical, and requires further examination.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Metamorphosis_ subcomplete[1246].\r\n\r\n       _Body_ consisting of numerous segments.\r\n\r\n       _Mouth_ perfect[1247].\r\n\r\n       _Eyes_ compound or aggregate.\r\n\r\n       _Antennæ_ distinct.\r\n\r\n       _Legs_ six on the trunk, many on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nI must next say something on the Orders of the _Arachnida_. Every one,\r\nat first sight, sees that _spiders_ and _scorpions_ are separated by\r\ncharacters so strongly marked, that they look rather like animals\r\nbelonging to different Classes than to the same: these form the two\r\n_primary_ Orders of the _Arachnida_, and they appear to be connected\r\nby two _secondary_ or osculant ones,--on the one side by _Galeodes_,\r\nand on the other by _Thelyphonus_ and _Phrynus_[1248]. This Class,\r\nalthough there is an appearance of eight legs, is, strictly speaking,\r\nof a _Hexapod_ type; for the anterior pair, ordinarily regarded as\r\nlegs and performing their function, are really the analogues of the\r\nmaxillary palpi of perfect insects. This will be evident to you if\r\nyou examine any species of _Galeodes_. These animals, if we look at\r\nthem cursorily, we should regard as _Decapods_; but when we trace\r\nthe two anterior pairs of apparent legs to their insertion, we find\r\nthat both proceed from the _head_, which in that genus is distinct\r\nfrom the trunk; while the three last pairs, which alone are furnished\r\nwith claws, are planted, as legs usually are, in the latter part. The\r\nfirst pair represent the ordinary palpi of _Arachnida_, are analogous\r\nto the labial ones of Hexapods, and, as likewise in _Phrynus_ and\r\n_Thelyphonus_, are more robust than what are usually taken for the\r\nfirst pair of legs; but they differ in being considerably longer, and\r\ninstead of terminating in a _chela_ are furnished with a retractile\r\nsucker[1249]. The second pair are more slender and shorter than the\r\nfirst; they correspond precisely with what are deemed the first pair of\r\nlegs of _Octopods_ and _Arachnida_, and are clearly analogous to the\r\nmaxillary palpi of perfect insects. Whether the base of the first pair\r\nof these palpi is in any respect analogous to the labium of insects,\r\n(as that of the second seems to be to their maxillæ,) I am not prepared\r\nto assert: it will therefore be most advisable to name these palpi\r\n_anterior_ and _posterior_: but as they evidently proceed from the\r\n_head_ in _Galeodes_, and in that genus are clearly analogous to those\r\nof the _Phrynidea_, (which in their turn as clearly represent those of\r\nthe _Aranidea_,) it follows that in all they are organs of the part\r\nrepresenting the _head_, and therefore not in a _primary_ sense _legs_;\r\nalthough in a _secondary_, as M. Savigny has proved, they may be so\r\ncalled[1250].\r\n\r\n1. ARANEIDEA M^cL. (_Aranea_ L., _Araneidæ_ Latr.) The _Araneidea_,\r\nor spiders, seem resolvable into _two_ suborders,--the _Sedentaries_\r\nand the _Wanderers_; thus forming, perhaps, what Mr. MacLeay would\r\ndenominate the normal groups of a circle of _Arachnida_.\r\n\r\n  DEF. _Mandibles_ armed with a perforated claw.\r\n\r\n       _Head_ and _Trunk_ coalite.\r\n\r\n       _Palpi_ pediform, anterior pair without claws.\r\n\r\n       _Abdomen_ without segments or elongated tail.\r\n\r\n       _Spiracles_ two[1251].\r\n\r\n       _Anus_ furnished with an apparatus for spinning[1252].\r\n\r\n2.

Having considered the _Orders_ into which _Insecta_ and\r\n_Arachnida_ may be divided, I am next to give you some account of the\r\n_groups_ into which each is further resolvable. To draw out, however,\r\na complete scheme of these would be deviating from my province,\r\nand extend this letter to an enormous length. Indeed, to give the\r\n_natural_ primary and subordinate sections of every Order, would\r\nrequire a knowledge of the subject to which no Entomologist has yet\r\nattained. I shall therefore only say something general upon them, and\r\nrefer you to an example of each kind of group.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the groups themselves their _nomenclature_ claims our\r\nattention. M. Latreille in his last arrangement of _Annulose_ animals\r\nhas divided his Orders into _Sections_; _Families_; _Tribes_; and\r\n_Genera_: his tribes he has often further subdivided into lesser\r\nsections, represented by capital and small letters, &c.[1262].\r\nMr. MacLeay, discarding the term section, has _Tribes_; _Races_\r\n(_Stirps_); _Families_; _Genera_, and _Subgenera_[1263]. But as in\r\ndescending from the _Order_ to the lowest term, or the _species_,\r\na series of groups gradually diminishing in value, which require\r\na greater number of denominations than have yet been employed by\r\nEntomologists, often occur, I think we may with benefit to the\r\nscience add to the list. I would therefore propose the following\r\nprimary and subordinate divisions of an Order: 1. _Suborder_; 2.\r\n_Section_; 3. _Subsection_; 4. _Tribe_; 5. _Subtribe_; 6. _Stirps_;\r\n7. _Family_; 8. _Genus_; 9. _Subgenus_. I would further propose that\r\neach of these successive groups should have a name always terminating\r\nalike, so that the value of the group when spoken of might always\r\nbe known by the termination:--thus if a subclass end in _ata_, a\r\nsuborder might end in _ita_; a section in _ana_, a subsection in\r\n_ena_; a tribe in _ina_, a subtribe in _ona_; a stirps in _una_; and\r\na family in _idæ_; the genera being left free.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _characters_, we are not to place our groups\r\nupon Procrustes' bed, and lop or torture them to accommodate them\r\nto every standard we may have fixed for them: assuming one set of\r\ncharacters for suborders, another for tribes, and so for every other\r\ngroup; for the value of characters varies,--those that in some cases\r\nare common to an _Order_, in others indicate only _sections_, or\r\n_tribes_, or _genera_ and _species_, or sometimes even _sexes_. What\r\nis constant in one group is not so in another, and _vice versâ_; so\r\nthat it is a vain labour to search for a _universal_ character. If\r\nit is our wish really to trace the labyrinth of nature, we can only\r\naccomplish it by a careful perusal and examination of her various\r\ngroups. It is singular how much and how far various Entomologists,\r\nand those of the very highest class, have been misled by a kind of\r\n_favouritism_ to give too universal a currency to certain characters\r\nfor which they have conceived a predilection. Some have been the\r\nchampions of the _antennæ_; others of the _trophi_; others again\r\nof the _wings_; and others of the _metamorphosis_. These are all\r\ncharacters which within certain limits lead us right, and are an\r\nindex to a natural group; but if we follow them further, we leave the\r\nsystem of nature, and are perplexed in the mazes of a _method_[1264].\r\n\r\nLet us now see whether we can pitch upon any suborder which will\r\nafford an example of every group that we have lately named. Mr.\r\nMacLeay, from a consideration of the larvæ of that Order, has divided\r\nthe _Coleoptera_ into five primary groups that may be denominated\r\n_Suborders_. Whether these are all natural groups has not yet been\r\nmade sufficiently evident. It answers my present purpose, however,\r\nto assume it as proved. I select therefore his _Chilopodimorpha_\r\nfor my suborder, altering the name as above proposed to\r\n_Chilopodimorph_it_a_: for my _Section_ I take the Predaceous\r\nbeetles, or _Adephaga_ of M. Clairville, distinguished by having\r\nthe upper lobe of their maxillæ biarticulate and palpiform;--these\r\nI would denominate _Adephag_an_a_, or devourers. They consist of\r\ntwo groups forming two subsections, the one _terrestrial_ and\r\nthe other _aquatic_; which I would name, following Mr. MacLeay,\r\n_Geodephag_en_a_ and _Hydrodephag_en_a_. These two subsections are\r\neach resolvable into two _Tribes_ constituted by Linné's four genera\r\n_Cicindela_ and _Carabus_; _Dytiscus_ and _Gyrinus_. The first\r\ntribe, remarkable for the swiftness of their _flight_, I would name\r\n_Eupter_in_a_, or fliers; the second, equally noted for _running_,\r\n_Eutrech_in_a_, or runners; the third _Eunech_in_a_, or swimmers;\r\nand the fourth _Gyronech_in_a_, or swimmers in a circle. The second\r\nof these groups, the _Eutrech_in_a_, are resolvable into two other\r\ngroups or _Subtribes_; one distinguished by having the cubit or\r\nanterior tibia _notched_, (which, from their being in general not\r\nvery brilliant in colour, I would call _Amaur_on_a_, or obscure); the\r\nother having the cubit without a notch, (which, from the brilliancy\r\nof many of them, I would name _Lampr_on_a_, or splendid). These\r\nsubtribes are both further resolvable into two or more _races_\r\n(_Stirpes_). I select that to which the _crepitant_ _Eutrech_in_a_\r\nbelong, containing those which from their usually truncated elytra\r\nMM. Latreille and Dejean have named _Truncatipennes_[1265]: these, to\r\nshorten the name, I call _Truncipenn_un_a_. This brings us down to\r\nthe lowest group formed out of genera and subgenera: or the _family_,\r\nwhich from its principal genus is named _Brachinidæ_, and which leads\r\nus to the _genus Brachinus_, and the _subgenus Aptini_. Thus we get\r\nthe following scale, expressing every division of an Order, till we\r\narrive at its lowest term, or the _species_ that compose it.\r\n\r\n  SUBORDER\r\n\r\n    _Chilopodimorph_it_a_ M^cL.\r\n\r\n      SECTION\r\n\r\n        _Adephag_an_a_ Clairv.\r\n\r\n          SUBSECTION\r\n\r\n            _Geodephag_en_a_ M^cL.\r\n\r\n              TRIBE\r\n\r\n                _Eutrech_in_a_\r\n\r\n                  SUBTRIBE\r\n\r\n                    _Amaur_on_a_\r\n\r\n                      STIRPS\r\n\r\n                        _Truncipenn_un_a_ Latr.\r\n\r\n                          FAMILY\r\n\r\n                            _Brachinidæ_\r\n\r\n                              GENUS\r\n\r\n                                _Brachinus_\r\n\r\n                                  SUBGENUS\r\n\r\n                                    _Aptini_.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of this scale I have endeavoured to steer\r\nclear of being led by any system, but, with the exception of the\r\n_Suborder_, which I assume, to resolve it into natural groups\r\ngradually decreasing in value, or tending to the lowest term, which\r\nappear all of them to have been considered as such by preceding\r\nEntomologists. The four _Tribes_ into which the two subsections\r\n_Geodephag_en_a_ and _Hydradephag_en_a_ appear resolvable, are not\r\nonly distinguished by the characters of the perfect insect, but\r\nlikewise by those of their larvæ, which are constructed on four\r\ndistinct types; those of the _Gyronech_in_a_ being the most perfectly\r\nChilopodimorphous of the whole, and those of the _Eunech_in_a_ the\r\nleast so[1266]. The former appear rather to form an osculant tribe,\r\nor one without the circle, than one within it; and to be going off\r\ntowards another section, including _Hydrophilus_, _Sphæridium_, &c.\r\nI must observe, that between _Dytiscus_ and _Hydrophilus_ there is a\r\nstriking agreement both in their form and habits in the larvæ[1266],\r\nand even in several characters in the perfect insect; so as in many\r\nrespects to generate a doubt whether they ought not to enter the same\r\ncircle and to follow each other. Yet the change of habits in the\r\nlatter, which from a carnivorous larva becomes a herbivorous beetle;\r\nthe consequent change of structure in their oral organs, their\r\nantennæ, and other striking differences; and the evident intervention\r\nof the _Gyronech_in_a_ and some other osculant tribes between the\r\ntwo, forbid their union in one and the same circle.\r\n\r\nvi. I need not say more on those larger groups of an Order which\r\nconduct us to what are denominated its _genera_; but upon these last\r\nit will not be a waste of your time to enlarge a little. In the last\r\nedition of the _Systema Naturæ_, and in its appendixes, Linné has\r\ndescribed 2840 species of _Insecta_ and _Arachnida_, which he divided\r\ninto 83 genera, allowing upon an average nearly 35 species to each\r\ngenus. From the paucity of the materials, therefore, of which his\r\nsystem was constructed, there was no loud call upon him for numerous\r\ngenera. But now more than thirty times that number are said to have\r\nfound a place in the cabinets of collectors[1267], and there is good\r\nreason for thinking that perhaps half that are in existence are as\r\nyet undiscovered;--this makes it a matter of absolute necessity to\r\nsubdivide the Linnean genera, which in fact, with regard to the\r\nmajority of them, were the _primary_ groups of his Orders, rather\r\nthan an approximation to the _ultimate_. But this principle may\r\nbe carried too far: for it is the nature of man to pass from one\r\nextreme to the other: and this seems to me to be the case when it is\r\nproposed to make genera the _extreme_ term of subdivision before you\r\narrive at species. But it is argued by a very acute Zoologist, that\r\nsimplicity, perspicuity, and room for necessary variations are best\r\npreserved by distinguishing these subdivisions each by an appropriate\r\nname[1268]:--Granted. But still it is only a choice of evils. It\r\nwould require probably more than 10,000 names to designate them, were\r\nevery extreme group distinguished by a name: but if Mr. MacLeay's\r\nadmirable pattern exhibited in his genus _Phanæus_[1269] were\r\nfollowed, it would not call for more than 2000--could the trifling\r\ndifficulty occasioned sometimes by the discovery of a new group, be\r\nset against the advantage of having only 2000 names to commit to\r\nmemory instead of 10,000[1270]? But if, after all, it is judged best\r\nto name subgenera, M. Savigny's excellent plan of distinguishing\r\nthem by a plural termination would diminish the weight of the above\r\nobjection, and might be used with advantage.\r\n\r\nWhen the component parts of any minor group differ from another,--for\r\nthe most part in important characters, indicating some tangible\r\ndifference in their habits and economy, and confirmed by peculiarities\r\nin their larvæ; and these differences run through the whole, except\r\nthat as usual they grow weaker as it is passing off to another;\r\nespecially where they are striking in the centre or type of the\r\ngroup,--this is always a legitimate genus: but where the characters\r\nassumed are very slight, and nothing peculiar in its habits, economy or\r\nlarva, warrant such distinction, it ought not to be conferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nvii. I must next say a word concerning species and varieties. A\r\n_species_ is a natural object whose differences from those most\r\nnearly related to it had their origin when it came from the hands\r\nof its CREATOR; while those that characterize a _variety_, have\r\nbeen produced since that event. As we do not know the value and\r\nweight of the momenta by which climate, food, and other supposed\r\nfortuitous circumstances operate upon animal forms, we cannot point\r\nout any certain diagnostic by which in all cases a species may be\r\ndistinguished from a variety;--for those characters that in some are\r\nconstant, in others vary. In general, where there is no difference\r\nin _form_, _appendages_ and _organs_, _sculpture_, _proportions_\r\nand _larvæ_,--_colour_ alone, especially in insects inhabiting the\r\nsame district, only indicates a casual variety. Thus _Aphodius\r\nluridus_ has sometimes pale elytra with the striæ black (_Scarabæus\r\nnigro-sulcatus_ Marsh.): at others it has black spots between the\r\nstriæ, as in the type: in a third variety the elytra are black at the\r\nbase and pale at the apex (_Sc. varius_ Marsh.); and lastly, in a\r\nfourth they are intirely black (_Sc. gagates_ Marsh.);--yet all these\r\nin every other respect precisely correspond. But the converse of this\r\nwill scarcely hold good; for doubtless minor differences of structure\r\nare sometimes produced by a different food and climate: which may\r\nprobably account for some variations observable in the individuals\r\napparently of the same species obtained from different countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving considered the kind and value of the groups into which\r\n_Annulose_ animals, and more especially insects, may be divided, I\r\nshall next call your attention to their _composition_. There are\r\n_five_ numbers and their multiples which seem more particularly\r\nto prevail in nature: namely, _Two_--_Three_--_Four_--_Five_ and\r\n_Seven_. But though these numbers are _prevalent_, no one of them\r\ncan be deemed _universal_. The _binary_ number, which affords the\r\nmost simple, and for that reason perhaps not the least valuable, mode\r\nof arrangement, we see exemplified when two branches, so to speak,\r\ndiverge from a common stem,--as in the _Vegetable_ and _Animal_\r\nkingdoms; the _terrestrial_ and _aquatic_ Predaceous beetles;\r\nin the _thalerophagous_ and _saprophagous Lamellicorn_ ones; in\r\nthe _Anoplura_ and _Thysanura_; the _Chilopoda_ and _Chilognatha_\r\namongst _Apterous_ insects; in the _Scorpionidea_ and _Aranidea_\r\namongst the _Arachnida_; and in the _Macrura_ and _Brachyura_\r\namongst the Decapod _Crustacea_. Again, in other cases _three_ seems\r\nto be the most prominent number: this takes place sometimes with\r\nregard to the _primary_ groups of an Order, or what I denominate\r\nthe _Suborders_. Thus we have the _Diurnal_, _Crepuscular_, and\r\n_Nocturnal Lepidoptera_[1271]; the Linnean genera _Blatta_, _Mantis_,\r\nand _Gryllus_ constitute the _Orthoptera_; and other instances of\r\nthis number might be produced in some minor groups. But that which\r\nappears to prevail most widely in nature is what may be called\r\nthe _quaterno-quinary_; according to which, groups consist of four\r\nminor ones; one of which is excessively capacious in comparison\r\nof the other three, and is always divisible into two; which gives\r\n_five_ of the same degree, but of which, two have a greater affinity\r\nto each other than they have to the other three[1272]. Mr. W. S.\r\nMacLeay, in the progress of his inquiries to ascertain the station\r\nof _Scarabæus sacer_, discovered that the thalerophagous and\r\nsaprophagous Petalocerous beetles resolved themselves each into a\r\ncircle containing _five_ such groups. And having got this principle,\r\nand finding that this number and its multiples prevailed much in\r\nnature, he next applied it to the Animal Kingdom in general: and from\r\nthe result of this investigation, it appeared to him that it was\r\nnearly, if not altogether, universal[1273]. Nearly at the same time\r\na discovery almost parallel was made and recorded by three eminent\r\nBotanists, MM. Decandolle, Agardh, and Fries, with regard to some\r\ngroups of the Vegetable Kingdom[1274]; and more recently Mr. Vigors\r\nthinks he has discovered the same quinary arrangement in various\r\ngroups of birds[1275]. This is a most remarkable coincidence,\r\nand seems a strong argument in favour of Mr. MacLeay's system. I\r\nshould observe, however, that according to that system, as stated\r\nin his _Horæ Entomologicæ_, if the osculant or transition groups\r\nare included, the total number is _seven_[1276]:--these are groups\r\nsmall in number both of genera and species, that intervene between\r\nand connect the larger ones. Each of these osculant groups may be\r\nregarded as divided into _two_ parts, the one belonging to the\r\n_upper_ circle and the other to the _lower_; so that each circle or\r\nlarger group is resolvable into five _interior_ and two _exterior_\r\nones, thus making up the number _seven_. Though Mr. MacLeay regards\r\nthis quinary arrangement of natural objects as very general, it does\r\nnot appear that he looks upon it as absolutely universal,--since he\r\nstates organized matter to begin in a dichotomy[1277]: and he does\r\nnot resolve its ultimate groups into five species; nor am I certain\r\nthat he regards the penultimate groups as invariably consisting of\r\nfive ultimate ones. In _Copris_ I seem in my own cabinet to possess\r\nten or twelve distinct types[1278]; and in _Phanæus_, the fifth\r\ntype, which Mr. MacLeay regards as containing insects resembling all\r\nthe other types[1279], appears to me rather divided into _two_; one\r\nformed by _P. carnifex_, _Vindex_, _igneus_, &c., and the other by\r\n_P. splendidulus_, _floriger_, _Kirbii_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe great point which demands our attention in considering a\r\nnumerical arrangement of the Kingdoms of Nature is the _value_ of\r\nthe component members of each group. It is by no means difficult to\r\ndivide a _Kingdom_, a _Class_, or an _Order_ into two, or three,\r\nor five, or seven or more groups, according to any system we may\r\nbe inclined to favour; but it is not so easy to do this so that\r\nthe groups shall be of equal rank. Yet it seems requisite that in\r\ngrouping our objects, as we descend towards the lowest term we should\r\nresolve each only into its primary elements, and of them form the\r\nnext group; and so on till we come to species. When I say of _equal\r\nrank_, I do not mean an exact parity between the members into which\r\na group is primarily resolvable,--because there will always be a\r\ndegradation _in descensu_ from the perfection of the type; but merely\r\nthat parity (to use a metaphor) that there is between children of\r\nthe same mother, differing in their relative ages and approach to\r\nthe perfection of their nature. Perhaps it may be observed with\r\nrespect to the quinary system, that this condition is not complied\r\nwith, since two of the groups taken _per se_ appear really to form\r\none group; or to be much nearer to each other than to the remaining\r\ngroups. But when it is taken into consideration that this great\r\ngroup, always resolvable into two, is the typical group, and that\r\nthe two are really equal, or rather superior in value to the three\r\nothers, the objection seems to vanish.\r\n\r\nWith regard to all numerical systems we may observe, that since\r\nvariation is certainly one of the most universal laws of nature, we\r\nmay conclude that different numbers prevail in different departments,\r\nand that all the numbers above stated as prevalent are often\r\nresolvable or reducible into each other. So that where Physiologists\r\nappear to differ, or think they differ, they frequently really agree.\r\n\r\nII. The ALMIGHTY CREATOR, when he clothed the world that he had made\r\nwith _plants_, and peopled it with _animals_, besides the manifestation\r\nof his own glory, appears to have had _two_ most important purposes in\r\nview;--the one to provide a supply for the mutual wants of the various\r\nliving objects he had created, for the continuance of the species,\r\nand for the maintenance of a due proportion, as to numbers, of each\r\nkind, so that all might subserve to the good of the whole; and the\r\nother, that by them he might _instruct_ his creature man in such civil,\r\nphysical, moral and spiritual truths, as were calculated to fit him for\r\nhis station in the visible world, and gradually prepare him to become\r\nan inhabitant of that invisible one for which he was destined. The\r\nfirst of these purposes was best promoted by creating things \"according\r\nto their kind,\" with sexes monœcious or diœcious; that groups of beings\r\nrelated to each other, and agreeing in their general structure, might\r\ndischarge a common function. This we see to be the case generally in\r\nnature; for where there is an affinity in the _structure_, there is\r\nusually an affinity in the _function_. The last,--or the instruction of\r\nman in his primeval state of integrity and purity,--was best secured\r\nby placing before him for his scrutiny a book of emblems or symbols,\r\nin which one thing either by its form or qualities, or both, might\r\nrepresent another. If he was informed by his Creator that the works of\r\ncreation constituted such a book, by the right interpretation of which\r\nhe might arrive at spiritual verities as well as natural knowledge,\r\ncuriosity and the desire of information concerning these high and\r\nimportant subjects would stimulate him to the study of the mystic\r\nvolume placed before him; in the progress of which he would doubtless\r\nbe assisted by that DIVINE guidance, which even now is with those who\r\nhonestly seek the truth. Both divines and philosophers have embraced\r\nthis opinion, which is built upon the word of GOD itself[1280].\r\n\r\nThis last purpose of the Creator was the root of the analogies,\r\nconnecting different objects with each other that have no real\r\naffinity, observable in the works of creation: so that from the\r\nbottom to the top of the scale of being, there is many a series of\r\nanalogous forms, as well as of concatenated ones; and the intire\r\nsystem of nature is _representative_, as well as operative: it is a\r\nkind of _Janus bifrons_, which requires to be studied in two aspects\r\nlooking different ways. To what degree of knowledge the primeval\r\nraces of men attained after the fall, by the contemplation and study\r\nof this book of nature, we are no where informed; but we learn from\r\nthe highest authority that the revelation that GOD thus made of\r\nhimself was in time corrupted, by those that _professing_ themselves\r\nto be _wise_ became _fools_, to the grossest idolatry, which sunk men\r\nin the lowest depths of sensuality, vice, and wickedness[1281].\r\n\r\nIn no country was this effect more lamentably striking than in Egypt,\r\nwhose gods were all selected from the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\n    \"Who knows not to what monstrous gods, my friend,\r\n     The mad inhabitants of Egypt bend?\r\n     The snake-devouring ibis these inshrine,\r\n     Those think the crocodile alone divine;\r\n     Others where Thebes' vast ruins strew the ground,\r\n     And shatter'd Memnon yields a magic sound,\r\n     Set up a glittering brute of uncouth shape,\r\n     And bow before the image of an ape!\r\n     Thousands regard the hound with holy fear,\r\n     Not one Diana:--and 'tis dangerous here\r\n     To violate an onion, or to stain\r\n     The sanctity of leeks with tooth profane.\r\n     O holy nations, in whose gardens grow\r\n     Such deities!\"\r\n                                           JUV.\r\n\r\nThis species of idolatry doubtless originally resulted from their\r\nhaving been taught that things _in_ nature were symbols of things\r\n_above_ nature, and of the attributes and glory of the Godhead. In\r\nprocess of time, while the corruption _remained_, the knowledge which\r\nhad been thus abused was _lost_ or dimly seen. The Egyptian priesthood\r\nperhaps retained some remains of it; but by them it was made an\r\nesoteric doctrine, not to be communicated to the profane vulgar, who\r\nwere suffered to regard the various objects of their superstitious\r\nveneration, not as _symbols_, but as possessed of an _inherent_\r\ndivinity: and probably the mysteries of Isis in Egypt, and of Ceres at\r\nEleusis, were instituted, that this esoteric doctrine, which was to be\r\nkept secret and sacred from the common people, might not be lost.\r\n\r\nBut this kind of analogy is of a higher order than that of which I am\r\nhere principally to speak,--that, namely, which the various objects\r\nof nature bear to each other. This, however, though of a lower rank,\r\nis essentially connected with the other, and leads to it; for it\r\nestablishes the principle, that created things are representative or\r\nsymbolical: and we find, when we view them in this light, that as\r\nwe ascend from the lowest beings in the scale of creation, we are\r\nled from one to another till we reach the summit or centre of the\r\nwhole, and are thus conducted to the boundaries of this visible and\r\nmaterial system; from whence we may conclude that we ought not here\r\nto stop, but go on to something invisible and extra-mundane, as the\r\nultimate object intended to be reflected from this great speculum of\r\ncreation--the CREATOR himself, and all those spirits, virtues, and\r\npowers that have emanated from him.\r\n\r\nThe _analogies_ which the various objects of the animal kingdom\r\nmutually exhibit, have for the most part been either overlooked by\r\nmodern Physiologists, or have been mistaken for characters that\r\nindicate _affinity_; a circumstance that has often perplexed or\r\ndisrupted their systems. Dr. Virey appears to have been one of the\r\nfirst who obtained a general idea of the parallelism of animals in\r\nthis respect[1282]; and M. Savigny has contrasted the _Mandibulata_\r\nand _Haustellata_ of the insect tribes as presenting analogies to\r\neach other[1283]. But a countryman of our own (often mentioned with\r\nhonour in the course of our correspondence), peculiarly gifted by\r\nnature, and qualified by education and his line of study for such\r\nspeculations, and possessing moreover the invaluable opportunity\r\nof consulting at his ease one of the first Entomological cabinets\r\nin Europe, in a work that will for ever couple his name with the\r\nscience that he cultivates[1284],--has first taught the Naturalist\r\nthe respective value and real distinctions of the two kinds of\r\nrelationship that I am now discussing. He has opened to the\r\nphilosopher, the moralist and the divine, that hitherto closed door\r\nby which our first parents and their immediate descendants entered\r\nthe temple of nature, and studied the symbols of knowledge that\r\nwere there presented to them: and in addition to his labours (in\r\nnumerous respects successful), in endeavouring to trace out the\r\nnatural groups of beings connected by _affinity_, has pointed out\r\nhow they illustrate each other by _analogy_; thus affording, as was\r\nbefore observed[1285], a most triumphant reply to the arguments of\r\nthose modern sophists, who, from the graduated scale of affinities\r\nobservable in creation, were endeavouring to prove that animals, in\r\nthe lapse of ages, were in fact their own creators[1286].\r\n\r\nFor the more satisfactory elucidation of the subject before us, I\r\nshall consider, first, how we are to distinguish affinities from\r\nanalogies; and then mention some of the various instances of the\r\nlatter that occur between insects and other animals, and between\r\ndifferent tribes of insects themselves.\r\n\r\nTo know what characters denote affinity and what are merely\r\nanalogical, it must be kept in mind that the former being predicated\r\nof beings in a _series_ (whether that series has its gyrations that\r\nreturn into themselves, or proceeds in a right line, or assumes\r\nany other intermediate direction, it matters not), it cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained but by considering attentively the gradual\r\napproximation or recession of the structure to or from a certain type\r\nin any point of such series. If, therefore, you wish to ascertain\r\nwhether the characters, in which any given object resembles other\r\nobjects in certain groups, indicate affinity or only analogy, you\r\nmust first make yourself acquainted with the common features which\r\ndistinguish the animals known to belong to that group,--either those\r\nrelating to their structure, or to their habits and economy. If the\r\nobject under your eye partakes in these characters more or less, in\r\nproportion as it approaches the type or recedes from it, the relation\r\nit exhibits is that of _affinity_; but if, though it resembles some\r\nmembers of it in several points of its structure, it differs from\r\nthe whole group in the general features and characteristic marks\r\nthat distinguish it, the relation it bears to those members is\r\nmerely that of _analogy_. Thus, for instance, _Ascalaphus italicus_\r\nin its antennæ, the colouring of its wings, and its general aspect,\r\nexhibits a striking resemblance to a _butterfly_; yet a closer\r\nexamination of its characters will satisfy any one that it is in\r\nquite a different series, and has no _affinity_ whatever to that\r\ngenus. A departure, however, in only one respect from what may be\r\ncalled the _normal_ characters of its group, does not annul the claim\r\nof any tribe of insects to remain in it; since this very often only\r\nindicates a retrocession from the type, and not a disruption of its\r\nties of affinity. Thus the saw-flies (_Serrifera_) differ from the\r\nother _Hymenoptera_, though not in their pupæ, yet more or less in\r\ntheir larvæ; but this alone cannot countervail their agreement with\r\nthat Order in their organs of manducation and motion, in their\r\novipositor, and in the other details of their structure[1287].\r\n\r\nI have on a former occasion pointed out many of the analogies which\r\ntake place between insects and other parts of the animal kingdom, and\r\neven between insects and the mineral and vegetable kingdoms[1288]:\r\nI shall now resume the subject more at large, but without recurring\r\nto those last mentioned. In considering the analogies which connect\r\ninsects with other animals, or which they exhibit with respect to\r\neach other, we may have recourse to _two_ methods. We may either\r\nconsider them as placed somewhere between the two extremes of a\r\nconvolving series, from which station we may trace these analogies\r\n_upwards_ and _downwards_ towards each limit; or we may conceive them\r\nand other animals in this respect arranged in a number of series\r\nthat are _parallel_ to each other, in which the opposite points are\r\nanalogous. The first mode will perhaps best explain the analogies\r\nthat exist between insects and other animals, and the last those\r\nbetween different groups of insects themselves. I shall give an\r\nexample or two of each method, beginning with the first.\r\n\r\nThere are two tribes in the animal kingdom that seem placed in\r\ncontrast to each other, both by their habits and by their structure.\r\nOne of these is carnivorous, living by rapine and bloodshed, and can\r\nseldom be rendered subservient to our domestic purposes; while the\r\nother is herbivorous or granivorous, is quiet in its habits, and\r\neasily domesticated. Amongst insects we find the representatives of\r\nboth: those of the first tribe are distinguished by their predaceous\r\nhabits, by the open attacks, or by the various snares and artifices\r\nwhich they employ to entrap and destroy other insects. They may\r\nusually be known by their powerful jaws or instruments of suction; by\r\ntheir prominent or ferocious eyes; by the swiftness of their motions,\r\neither on the earth, in the air, or in the water; by their fraud and\r\nartifice in lying in wait for their prey. Amongst the _Coleoptera_,\r\nthe Predaceous beetles,--including the Linnean genera _Cicindela_,\r\n_Carabus_[1289], _Dytiscus_, and _Gyrinus_,--are of this description;\r\nand they symbolize those higher animals that by open violence attack\r\nand devour their prey:--for instance, the sharks, pikes, &c., amongst\r\nthe fishes; the eagles, hawks, &c., amongst the birds; and the whole\r\nfeline genus amongst the beasts. Similar characters give a similar\r\nrelation of analogy to the _Mantidæ_ and _Libellulina_ amongst\r\nthe _Orthoptera_ and _Neuroptera_. The whole family of _Arachne_,\r\nthe larvæ of the _Myrmeleonina_, &c., portray those animals that\r\nto ferocity add cunning and stratagem, or suck the blood of their\r\nvictims. The _Myriapods_ symbolize in a striking manner the Ophidian\r\nreptiles. Look at an _Iulus_, and both in its motions and form you\r\nwill acknowledge that it represents a _living_ serpent; next turn\r\nyour eyes to a centipede or _Scolopendra_, and you will find it\r\nnearly an exact model of the skeleton of a _dead_ one, the flat\r\nsegments of its body resembling the vertebræ, its curving legs the\r\nribs, and its venomous maxillæ the poison-fangs. The great body of\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, the _Homopterous Hemiptera_, the _Lepidoptera_,\r\nand _Trichoptera_, afford no example of Predaceous insects. All the\r\nanalogies I have here particularized, ascending from the insect,\r\nterminate in races of a corresponding character and aspect amongst\r\nthe _Mammalia_, and thus lead us towards _man_ himself, or rather to\r\nmen in whose minds those bad and malignant qualities prevail, which,\r\nwhen accompanied by power, harass and lay waste mankind; and thus\r\nascending from symbol to symbol, we arrive at an animal who in his\r\nown person unites both matter and spirit, and is thus the member both\r\nof a visible and invisible world: and we are further instructed by\r\nthese symbols,--perpetually recurring under different forms,--in the\r\nexistence of evil and malignant spirits, whose object and delight is\r\nthe corporeal and spiritual ruin of the noble creature who is placed\r\nat the head of the visible works of GOD.\r\n\r\nThe other tribe of animals that I mentioned of a milder character,\r\nmay be looked upon as represented by many herbivorous, or not\r\ncarnivorous, insects; amongst others, the Lamellicorn beetles imitate\r\nthem by their remarkable horns, so that they wear the aspect of\r\nminiature bulls, or deer, or antelopes[1290], or rams, or goats,\r\nwhether these horns are processes of the head or of the upper\r\njaws. The gregarious _Hymenoptera_, some of which form part of our\r\ndomestic treasures, may be regarded in some degree as belonging to\r\nthis department. From insects the ascent upwards, with regard to\r\n_form_, is by some of the branchiostegous fishes, which symbolize\r\nthe horns of cattle; with regard to _character_, by the various\r\nspecies of _Cyprinus_ and other similar genera.--Whether any of the\r\n_reptiles_ may be looked upon as falling into this division, I am\r\nnot sufficiently conversant with them to assert; but if any, the\r\n_Chelonians_, or tortoise and turtle tribes, are entitled to that\r\ndistinction. Amongst the birds, the _Gallinæ_ and _Anseres_,--from\r\nwhich Orders we derive our domestic poultry, whether terrestrial or\r\naquatic,--and our game, form the step next below the ruminants, or\r\ncattle: and we are thus again led towards man, and are symbolically\r\ninstructed in those domestic and social qualities which endear us\r\nto each other, best promote the general welfare, and render us most\r\nlike good spirits and the Divinity himself; of whom the perpetual\r\nrecurrence of animals exhibiting these amiable and useful qualities\r\nis calculated to impress upon us some notion. I might mention many\r\nmore instances of ascending analogies; as from some of the _Diptera_\r\nby the parrots, to the _Quadrumanes_ or monkey tribes--or from some\r\nof the _Iulidæ_ that roll themselves into a ball, to the _Armadillo_;\r\nbut these are sufficient to set your mind at work upon the subject,\r\nso that you may trace them for yourself. Nor shall I occupy your time\r\nby pointing out how analogies may be traced from insects downwards\r\ntowards the lowest term in the scale of animal life, but proceed\r\nto consider the analogies observable between insects themselves;\r\nin which I shall follow the _second_ method lately mentioned, and\r\nconsider them as arranged in parallel series.\r\n\r\nIn studying the analogies that take place between insects themselves,\r\nwe should always bear in mind that our inquiry is not concerning an\r\n_affinity_ which demands a correspondence in various particulars\r\nthat are not necessary to constitute an analogy; as, for instance,\r\nthat there should be a mutual imitation in all the states of any\r\ntwo insects. Wherever we discover a marked resemblance between\r\ntwo _perfect_ insects, there is a true analogy, though their\r\nmetamorphosis may differ; and where there is _not_ that resemblance,\r\nthough the metamorphosis may agree, there is no analogy. In fact,\r\ninsects are sometimes analogous in their _first_ state and _not_ in\r\ntheir _last_; and at other times analogous in their _last_ and _not_\r\nin their _first_; but the analogy is most perfect when it holds\r\nin _all_ their states: it then, indeed, almost approaches to an\r\naffinity. They may also be analogous to each other in their _habits_\r\nand _economy_, when there is little or no resemblance in their\r\n_form_; and, _vice versa_, be analogous in their _form_ and not in\r\ntheir _habits_. So that different sets of analogies may be assumed\r\nas foundations for different systems. Thus Mr. MacLeay assumes the\r\n_metamorphosis_ as the basis of analogy between the corresponding\r\nOrders of _Mandibulata_ and _Haustellata_[1291], while M. Savigny\r\ncompares the _perfect_ insects[1292]: the result therefore differs in\r\nsome instances. I shall now lay before you in a tabular view their\r\nplans and my own.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n           MANDIBULATA.

Savigny:\r\nI merely exclude the _Aphaniptera_ as forming an osculant Order,\r\nand I have added the _Coleoptera_ and Heteropterous _Hemiptera_ for\r\nreasons I shall soon assign. From Mr. MacLeay I differ more widely,\r\nwhich has resulted from our different ideas as to the mode of tracing\r\nanalogies; his theory leading him to the _metamorphosis_, and mine\r\nleading me[1293] to the _perfect_ insect, for the foundation of our\r\nseveral systems. It remains that I show how each of the pairs in my\r\ncolumns represent each other: but I must observe, that the analogies\r\nexhibited by insects in the corresponding Orders of these columns are\r\nnot equally striking in all their respective members; but only in\r\ncertain individual species or genera, more or less numerous, by which\r\nthe nearest approach is made to the contrasted forms.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the _Coleoptera_ and Heteropterous _Hemiptera_.--Both\r\nare distinguished by having an ample _prothorax_, a conspicuous\r\n_scutellum_, the neuration of their wings, the substance of the hard\r\npart of their _hemelytra_, which, as in _Coleoptera_, sometimes\r\nimitates horn and sometimes leather, and is occasionally, like\r\nelytra, lined with a _hypoderma_[1294]; the articulation of the\r\nhead with the trunk is likewise the same in both[1295]: and some\r\nHeteropterous species so strikingly resemble beetles (_Lygæus_,\r\n_brevipennis_ &c.), having little or no membrane at the end of\r\ntheir hemelytra, that they might easily be mistaken for them. These\r\ncircumstances prove, I think, that this suborder is more analogous\r\nto the _Coleoptera_ than to the _Orthoptera_, with which it agrees\r\nin scarcely any respect but its metamorphosis. The counterparts of\r\nthis last Order indeed, instead of the _Heteropterous_, are to be\r\nsought for amongst the _Homopterous Hemiptera_, various species of\r\nwhich exhibit a most marked and multifarious analogy with numerous\r\n_Orthoptera_. Many of both Orders (_Cicada_, _Locusta_), as you have\r\nheard long since, are signalized by possessing the same powers of\r\nsong, and produced by an analogous organ[1296]: a large proportion\r\nalso of both are endued with wonderful saltatorious powers, and their\r\nposterior tibiæ are similarly armed; their legs in general likewise\r\nare longitudinally angular, and the head in both articulates with the\r\ntrunk in the same manner[1297]. In both Orders too, the upper organs\r\nof flight are most commonly _tegmina_, but sometimes in both they are\r\nnearly membranous, like _wings_. In _Centrotus_ and _Acrydium_, the\r\none _Homopterous_ and the other _Orthopterous_, the front is bilobed,\r\nthe eyes are small; there are only two stemmata between the eyes;\r\nthe prothorax is conspicuous, and behind is producted into a long\r\nscutelliform process, under which all the parts also are analogous;\r\nthe abdomen articulates with the trunk in the same way, is similar\r\nin shape in both, and consists of short inosculating segments. Some\r\n_Fulgoridæ_ and _Truxalides_ agree also in their producted front.\r\nOther analogous characters might be named between these tribes,\r\nbut these are sufficient to confirm M. Savigny's opinion. That the\r\n_Neuroptera_ present analogies to the _Lepidoptera_, though they\r\ndiffer so widely from them in their metamorphosis and habits, is\r\nevident from the instance lately adduced of _Ascalaphus italicus_,\r\nwhich was described as a butterfly by Scopoli[1298]; and many of the\r\n_Libellulina_, by their wings, partly transparent and partly opaque,\r\nand by the shape of those organs and of their bodies, imitate the\r\nHeliconian butterflies: and this resemblance is much more striking\r\nthan any that occurs between the perfect insects in the _Neuroptera_\r\nand Homopterous _Hemiptera_. With regard to the _Hymenoptera_ and\r\n_Diptera_ the analogy is undisputed, and must strike every beholder;\r\nand one would almost say it was a real affinity, were it not that\r\nthe resemblance is not only general between Order and Order, but\r\nthat almost every Hymenopterous tribe has its counterpart amongst\r\nthe _Diptera_; the saw-flies[1299] for instance, the ichneumons,\r\nthe various false-wasps[1300], the false-bees[1301], the bees, the\r\nhumble-bees, the ants, &c., severally find there a representative\r\nthat wears its livery and general aspect: a circumstance which\r\nevidently proves that it was part of the plan of the CREATOR to place\r\nthem in contrast with each other. Were I to pursue this subject\r\nfurther, it might not be difficult to show that were the _tribes_ of\r\n_Mandibulata_ or of _Haustellata_ also arranged in columns, analogies\r\nwould be discoverable between their corresponding points: this seems\r\nto be Mr. MacLeay's opinion[1302]; and it is worth your pursuing the\r\nsubject further, which cannot but prove very interesting.\r\n\r\nBut though the general analogy of these columns is that of Order\r\nto Order, yet individual species in each Order sometimes find\r\ntheir representatives in a different one from that with which they\r\ngenerally are contrasted;--thus some _Diptera_, as _Culex_, by the\r\nscales on the veins and other parts of their wings, are analogous to\r\n_Lepidoptera_ rather than _Hymenoptera_[1303]; as is also the genus\r\n_Psychoda_ by its form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come now to the consideration of a question not easy to be\r\ndecided,--I mean, which Order of insects is to have the _precedency_,\r\nand which is the connecting link that unites them to Vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nLinné (and Mr. MacLeay seems in this to coincide with him) considered\r\nthe _Coleoptera_ as at the head of the Class of insects; De Geer\r\nthought the _Lepidoptera_ entitled to that honour; Latreille and\r\nCuvier begin with the _Aptera_: Marcel de Serres favours the\r\n_Orthoptera_[1304]; and others, on account of their admirable\r\neconomy, have made the _Hymenoptera_ the princes of the insect\r\nworld[1305]. If the claim to priority was to be decided by the\r\nexquisiteness of instincts and the benefits conferred upon the\r\nhuman race, doubtless it would be in favour of the last-mentioned\r\ninsects. If the power to do mischief carried it, and to lay waste\r\nthe earth, the _Orthoptera_ would be entitled as much as any to the\r\nbad pre-eminence. If beauty, and grace, and gaiety, and splendour\r\nof colours were the great requisite, and the law enjoined, _Detur\r\npulchriori_,--the _Lepidoptera_ would doubtless win the throne.\r\nBut if perfection and solidity of structure, as they ought, are to\r\nregulate this point; we must, I think, with the illustrious Swede,\r\nassign the palm to the _Coleoptera_. If we consider these in all\r\ntheir parts, the organs for flight only excepted, they seem more\r\nperfectly formed and finished than the insects of any other order.\r\nBut which of the Coleopterous tribes are entitled to the precedency?\r\nLinné placed the Lamellicorn beetles at the head of the order,\r\nbeginning with the _Dynastidæ_, probably led by some characters\r\nwhich seem to connect these with the Branchiostegous fishes. In\r\nthis he was followed by Fabricius. But Latreille and most modern\r\nEntomologists have begun with _Cicindela_ and the other Predaceous\r\nbeetles. I am not certain what are Mr. MacLeay's sentiments on this\r\nsubject; but from what he says in the _Annulosa Javanica_[1306], it\r\ndoes not appear that he is a convert to the latter opinion. Bulk\r\nand strength seem the most striking characteristics of the former\r\ntribe, which represent the cattle or ruminants amongst Vertebrate\r\nanimals.--Strength united with agility and a considerable portion of\r\ngrace and symmetry evidently confers a degree of pre-eminence upon\r\nthe latter, symbolizing the feline race, which seems to throw no\r\nsmall weight into their scale.\r\n\r\nThere are two Classes of Vertebrate animals with which insects may\r\nappear to claim kindred. The _fishes_, and the _reptiles_. _Fishes_\r\nin their fins exhibit no small resemblance to insects; the pectoral\r\nand ventral ones representing their arms and legs, and the dorsal\r\nones their wings: _Pegasus Draco_ in this last respect is not unlike\r\na butterfly[1307]. In some genera (_Ostracion_, _Pegasus_, &c.),\r\nlike insects the animal is covered with a hard shell or crust,\r\nformed by the union of its scales. The oral _cirrhi_ of many fishes\r\nseem analogous to the _palpi_ of insects; and in some a pair longer\r\nthan the rest represent their _antennæ_[1308]. Another circumstance\r\nin which insects and fishes correspond, is the wonderful variety\r\nof forms, often in the greatest degree eccentric, that occurs in\r\nboth Classes. Some of the cyclostomous fishes, as _Ammocœtus_,\r\n_Gastrobranchus_, are supposed to connect the fishes with the\r\n_Annulosa_, by means of the _Annelida_ as an osculant Class[1309],\r\nwhich Mr. MacLeay regards as the passage to the _Chilopoda_[1310]:\r\nhis _Mandibulata_ he considers as passing into the _Anoplura_ by\r\nmeans of some osculant Order as yet unknown[1311]. But I must confess\r\nI can see no good ground for this last transition:--the _Anoplura_\r\nappear much more nearly related to the _Psocidæ_, especially by the\r\napterous _Atropos pulsatoria_[1312] than to any _Coleopterous_\r\ninsect. But having stated these opinions, I shall leave you to draw\r\nyour own conclusions, as the question is still perplexed with many\r\ndifficulties. I am ready to admit that some Vertebrates approach near\r\nto the _Annelida_; but that it is through them alone that they are\r\nconnected with insects, is not at present clear.\r\n\r\nWith regard to _reptiles_, they seem to be connected with insects\r\nby several characters. In the _Chelonians_, the skeleton merges in\r\nthe external carapace or shell; the _Ophidians_ change their skin\r\nlike larvæ; the _Batrachians_ undergo metamorphoses; some of the\r\n_Saurians_ also have their changes: and the _Draco volans_ has wings\r\nsomewhat analogous to those of insects[1313]. Were I to be asked\r\nwhat Order of insects could connect with reptiles, I should point to\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, especially _Gryllus_ L., which by their noise and\r\nsaltatorious powers not a little resemble frogs; and the larvæ of\r\nsome strikingly imitate their form[1314]: and of others even that of\r\na lizard[1315]. But these resemblances, after all, may only indicate\r\nanalogies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1126] _Philos.

The progression of the series\r\nmay be in a circle; but at the point of contact where the second\r\ncircle meets the first, the lines must cut each other; and at this\r\npoint of intersection of the two circles are of course the osculant\r\ngroups constituting the first and the last of each circle, which in\r\ntheir intervention come in contact with each other, or rather forming\r\n_transition_ groups. If each circle is regarded as _absolute_, the\r\n_series_ is broken, though the osculant groups connect the circular\r\nones.\r\n\r\n[1140] Mr. MacLeay almost admits that there are _natural_ genera.\r\n_Hor.

As I do not think\r\nthe _Perlidæ_ belong to the Order, and as the great body of the\r\n_Trichoptera_ are distinguished by _hairy_ upper wings, I cannot\r\nthink the name improper: but to apply a name to a _Genus_ which\r\nterminates like the denominations of _Orders_, I think leads to\r\nmistakes, and should not be tolerated.--K.\r\n\r\n[1212] _Hor.

The other larvæ of the _Adephag_an_a_ have _twelve_\r\neyes.--Mr. Stephens (_Illustrations of British Entomology_, n^o. xv.\r\np. 175.) has confirmed the above statement, as to the number of eyes\r\nof the larva of _Cicindela_.\r\n\r\n[1267] Mr. MacLeay says that more than 100,000 _Annulosa_ exist in\r\ncollections.--_Hor.

Trans._ xv. 491.\r\n\r\n[1271] Dr. Horsfield, in his very ingenious and generally admirable\r\n_Descriptive Catalogue_ of the Javanese Lepidoptera in the Museum of\r\nthe Honourable East India Company, has divided that Order into _five_\r\nprimary groups, apparently to accommodate it to Mr. W. S. MacLeay's\r\nquinary system. I trust he will pardon me for observing, that in this\r\narrangement he seems to me rather to _force_ than to _follow_ nature;\r\nand that though he adheres to the above system as to the _number_, he\r\nforsakes it in the _construction_ of his groups.\r\n\r\nThe obvious primary sections of the Lepidoptera, which have been\r\nevident to almost every one who has at all studied the Order, are\r\nthe _three_ named in the text, corresponding with Linné's genera\r\n_Papilio_, _Sphinx_, and _Phalæna_. The groups of the last or\r\nnocturnal section, which Dr. Horsfield has elevated to the same rank\r\nwith the two first, are evidently not of equal value, nor to be\r\nplaced upon the same platform; for the _Bombycidæ_, _Noctuidæ_, and\r\n_Phalænidæ_, are clearly of a _secondary_ rank. Indeed this section\r\nis resolvable into _more_ groups of _equal_ value than the learned\r\nDoctor has assigned to it; for the _Tortricidæ_, _Tineidæ_, &c. are\r\nnot so united to the Geometers, or genuine _Phalænidæ_, as to form\r\nwith them a _primary_ group of the _Nocturnal Lepidoptera_, but are\r\nthemselves entitled _separately_ to that distinction. This will be\r\nevident to every one who will take the trouble to compare the larvæ\r\nand their habits, of the two tribes, as well as the perfect insects.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of his groups, he seems not to have discovered\r\nin the _Lepidoptera_ a great typical group resolvable into _two_,\r\nor at least he has not built his system on this foundation, which\r\nappears an essential part of the quinary arrangement. (See Mr.\r\nW. S. MacLeay in _Linn. Trans._ xiv. 56--.) As to _value_, the\r\n_Papilionidæ_ constitute the typical group or centre of the Order,\r\nthough the _Phalænidæ_ prevail as to _numbers_: but neither of these\r\nare resolvable into two primary groups.\r\n\r\n[1272] _Linn. Trans._ xiv. 56--. It is to be observed, however,\r\nthat what Mr. MacLeay calls the _aberrant groups_ are usually also\r\nresolvable into two.\r\n\r\n[1273] _Hor.

The Era\r\nof MacLeay, or of the _Quinary System_. All of these appear to form\r\nimportant points, or resting-places, in the progress of the science\r\ntowards its acme; and of each of these I shall now proceed to give\r\nyou a brief account.\r\n\r\n1. _The Era of the Ancients._ To ascertain what attention was paid\r\nto insects in the earliest ages, we must have recourse to the most\r\nancient of records, the Old Testament. In this sacred volume we are\r\ninformed that after the Creation GOD brought the creatures to Adam\r\nthat he might name them[1317]. Now the first man, in his unimpaired\r\nstate of corporeal, mental, and spiritual soundness, under the divine\r\nguidance, doubtless imposed upon them names significant of their\r\nqualities or structure; which according to Plato was a work above\r\nhuman wisdom, and on account of which the ancient Hebrews deduced\r\nthat Adam was a philosopher of the highest endowments[1318]. Whether\r\non this great and interesting occasion he gave names to individual\r\nspecies, or only to natural groups, does not clearly appear. But\r\nprobably as they were created, so were they brought before him\r\n\"According to their kinds[1319].\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently Moses will be thought to have possessed no ordinary\r\nknowledge of insects, if we suppose, as the ingenious remarks of\r\nProfessor Lichtenstein[1320] render probable, that he distinguishes\r\nas clean insects the Fabrician genera _Gryllus_, _Locusta_,\r\n_Truxalis_, and _Acheta_, which a person unobservant of these animals\r\nwould have confounded together. This discrimination presupposes\r\nthis knowledge of their general characters, not only in the Jewish\r\nlawgiver, but also in the people themselves to whom the precept was\r\naddressed, to whom it would otherwise have been _de ignotis_.\r\n\r\nAllusion is made in Holy Writ to insects of almost every one of the\r\nmodern Orders[1321]. They are represented as employed _divinitùs_\r\nsometimes to annoy the enemies of the Israelites, and at others to\r\npunish that people themselves when they apostatized from their God.\r\nThe prophets frequently introduce them as symbols of enemies that\r\nlay waste or oppress the church: as the _fly_ of the Ethiopians\r\nor Egyptians; the _bee_ of the Assyrians; and the _locust_ of the\r\nfollowers of Mahomet and other similar destroyers[1322]. That\r\nSolomon, amongst other objects to the investigation of which his\r\ndivinely inspired wisdom directed him, did not deem insects, those\r\n\"Little things upon the earth[1323],\" unworthy of his attention, we\r\nknow from Scripture[1324]; but as his physical writings are lost, we\r\nare ignorant whether he treated of their natural arrangement, their\r\neconomy and history, or of the instruction they afford _analogically_\r\nconsidered. Where he has referred to them incidentally, it is\r\ngenerally with this latter view.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the word and people of GOD to the _Lovers of Wisdom_\r\n(as they modestly styled themselves) of the heathen world, and their\r\nwritings; we shall discern amongst them a great light shining, the\r\nbeams of which illuminate even our own times. In the illustrious\r\nStagyrite we recognize--\"The father of philosophy, at least of our\r\nphilosophy, who, rising superior to the darkness in which he lived,\r\ndarted his penetrating glance through all nature, and established\r\nprinciples which a long course of ages of inquiry have but confirmed.\r\nWith Aristotle begins the real History of science: and how much\r\nsoever he may have erred upon particular points, the greatness of\r\nhis conceptions and the justness of his ideas, on the whole entitle\r\nhim to our high veneration. His labours in the investigation of the\r\nAnimal Kingdom have laid the foundation of the knowledge we now\r\npossess[1325].\" This language of the lamented and learned President\r\nof the Linnean Society is particularly applicable to what this great\r\nand original genius has effected in _Entomology_. We have seen upon a\r\nformer occasion[1326], that Linné himself had not those precise ideas\r\nof the limits of the Class _Insecta_, which Aristotle so many centuries\r\nbefore him had adopted. In stating the obligations of Entomology to\r\nthis true _sçavant_, I shall begin by laying before you a tabular view\r\nof what may be called his system, as far as I have been able to collect\r\nit from his works, especially his _History of Animals_.\r\n\r\n                             { Coleoptera[1327].\r\n                             { Pedetica = _Orthoptera saltatoria_\r\n                             {   Latr.[1328]\r\n                             { Astomata = _Hemiptera_ Latr.[1329]\r\n                             { Psychæ = _Lepidoptera_[1330].\r\n                             {\r\n            { Pterota vel    {            { majora = _Neuroptera_\r\n            { Ptilota[1331]     { Tetraptera {   L. _Orthoptera\r\n            {                {            {   cursoria_ Latr.[1332]?\r\n            {                {            { Opisthocentra =\r\n            {                {            {   _Hymenoptera_[1333].\r\n            {                {            {\r\n            {                { Diptera[1334] { minora = _Musca_,\r\n            {                {            {   _Tipula_, &c.\r\n  _Insecta_ {                {            { Emprosthocentra =\r\n            {                {            {  _Culex_,\r\n            {                {            {  _Stomoxys_,\r\n            {                {            {  _Tabanus_, &c.\r\n            {                {\r\n            { Pterota simul  { Myrmex = _Formica_ L.\r\n            {   et Aptera[1335] { Pygolampis = _Lampyris_ L.\r\n            {\r\n            { Aptera[1336].\r\n\r\nIt may be further stated, that Aristotle perceived also the\r\ndistinction between the _Mandibulata_ and _Haustellata_ of modern\r\nauthors: for he observes, that some insects having teeth are\r\nomnivorous; while others, that have only a tongue, are supported by\r\nliquid food[1337]. He appears to have regarded the _Hymenoptera_, or\r\nsome of them, as forming a _third_ subclass; since he clearly alludes\r\nto them, when he says that many have teeth, not for feeding, but to\r\nhelp them in fulfilling their instincts[1338].\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement it will appear that this great philosopher\r\nhad no contemptible notion,--though he has only distinguished three\r\nof them as larger groups by appropriate names,--of the majority\r\nof the Orders of Insects at present admitted. His _Coleoptera_,\r\n_Psychæ_, and _Diptera_ are evidently such. His idea of _Hemiptera_\r\nseems taken solely from the _Cicada_ or _Tettix_: but the manner in\r\nwhich he expresses himself concerning it, as having no mouth, but\r\nfurnished instead with a linguiform organ resembling the proboscis of\r\n_Diptera_[1339], proves that he regarded it as the type of a distinct\r\ngroup. Since he considers the saltatorious _Orthoptera_ as forming\r\nsuch a group, it is probable that he included the cursorious ones\r\nwith the _Neuroptera_ in his _majora_ section of _Tetraptera_; and\r\nthe resemblance of many of the _Mantidæ_ to the _Neuroptera_ is so\r\ngreat, that this mistake would not be wonderful. His division of the\r\n_Diptera_ is quite artificial.\r\n\r\nHow far Aristotle's ideas with regard to genera and species attained\r\nto any degree of precision, is not easily ascertained: in other\r\nrespects his knowledge of insects was more evident. As to their\r\n_anatomy_, he observes that their body is usually divided into\r\n_three_ primary segments,--_head_, _trunk_, and _abdomen_; that\r\nthey have an _intestinal canal_,--in some straight and simple, in\r\nothers contorted,--extending from the mouth to the anus; that the\r\n_Orthoptera_ have a _ventricle_ or gizzard[1340]. He had noticed\r\nthe _drums_ of _Cicada_, and that the _males_ only are vocal. Other\r\ninstances of the accurate observation of this great man might be\r\nadduced, but enough has been said to justify the above encomiums. His\r\nprincipal error was that of equivocal generation.\r\n\r\nLittle is known with regard to the progress of other Greek Naturalists\r\nin entomological science. It appears probable, from an epithet by\r\nwhich Hesiod distinguishes the spider--_air-flying_[1341], that the\r\nfact of these insects traversing the air was at that time no secret.\r\nApollodorus, as we learn from Pliny[1342], was the first _monographer_\r\nof insects, since he wrote a treatise upon scorpions, and described\r\nnine species. But like many other Zoologists, by mistaking analogy for\r\naffinity, he has included a _winged_ insect, probably a _Panorpa_,\r\namongst his scorpions. From the time of Aristotle, however, to Pliny,\r\nno writer is recorded, with the exception of those before alluded\r\nto[1343], that appears to have attended much to insects. They are\r\nindeed incidentally noticed by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Virgil, Ovid,\r\n&c., but without any material addition to the stock of entomological\r\nknowledge bequeathed to us by the Stagyrite. Even Pliny's vast\r\ncompendium, as it professed to be, of the natural history of the globe,\r\nwas in many respects little more than a compilation from that great\r\nphilosopher. Still, however, though he does not appear to have paid\r\nmuch practical attention to insects,--which indeed, considering the\r\nextent of his views, was scarcely to be expected,--yet as a guide to\r\nthe then state of entomological knowledge, and as an advocate for the\r\nstudy, which in the exordium of his eleventh book he has so eloquently\r\nand with so much animation defended from the misrepresentations of\r\nignorance, Pliny has conferred a lasting obligation on the science. The\r\nlast zoological writer of note was Ælian, who amongst other animals\r\noften mentions insects. He has, however, few original observations.\r\nOne was, that scorpions are viviparous[1344]. From him we learn\r\nincidentally that artificial flies were sometimes used by Grecian\r\nanglers[1345].\r\n\r\n2. _The Era of the Revival of the Science._ From the time of Pliny\r\nand Ælian 1400 years rolled away, in which scarcely any thing was\r\ndone or attempted for Entomology or Natural History in general.\r\nDuring that long night the glimmer of only one faint luminary\r\nappeared to make a short and feeble twilight. In the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century Albertus Magnus (so called from his family name\r\nof Groot, and justly, if incredible labour could entitle a man to\r\nthe appellation), devoted _one_ out of _twenty-one_ folio volumes\r\nto Natural History. In this work he professes not so much to give\r\nhis own opinions, as those of the Peripatetic philosophers[1346].\r\nHe occasionally, however, relates the result of observations made\r\nby himself, which prove him to have been no inattentive student\r\nof nature. He mentions a voyage that he made for the purpose of\r\ncollecting marine animals, and that he found of them ten different\r\ntribes or genera, and several species of each. Amongst these he\r\nparticularizes the _Cephalopoda_, the _Crustacea_, the testaceous\r\n_Mollusca_, and some of the _Radiata_ and _Acrita_, &c.[1347] He\r\ngives a very correct account of the pitfalls of _Myrmeleon_. Insects\r\nhe distinguishes, excluding the _Crustacea_, by the denomination\r\nof _Anulosa_ (_Annulosa_), which he appears to employ as a _known_\r\nterm[1348]. He also calls them _worms_, describing butterflies as\r\n_flying worms_, flies as _fly-worms_, spiders as _spider-worms_; and\r\nwhat is still more extraordinary, the _toad_ and the _frog_, which he\r\nincludes amongst his _Anulosa_, he calls _quadruped-worms_[1349]!!\r\nThough it may appear so absurd to speak of these animals as insects,\r\nyet he had perhaps a deeper and more philosophical reason for this\r\nthan we may at first be disposed to give him credit for. This would\r\nbe the case if he separated these from the other reptiles and placed\r\nthem amongst insects on account of their _metamorphoses_, mistaking\r\nperhaps an analogical character for one of affinity[1350]. Some of\r\nthe _Annelida_, as _Filaria_ and _Lumbricus_[1351], he also regarded\r\nas insects. I cannot gather from his desultory pages that he had any\r\nnotion of a systematical arrangement of his _Anulosa_.\r\n\r\nAfter the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, the light of learning, kindled by those of its\r\nprofessors who escaped from that ruin, appeared again in the West.\r\nThe Greek language then began to be studied universally; and in\r\nconsequence of the coeval invention of the art of printing, various\r\neditions of the great works of the ancients were published: amongst\r\nthe rest those of the fathers of Natural History. From the perusal\r\nof these, the love of the sciences of which they treated revived in\r\nthe West, and the attention of scientific men began to direct itself\r\nto the consideration and study of the works of their CREATOR. In the\r\nlatter part of that century, a work entitled the _Book of Nature_\r\nappeared in the German language, in which animals and plants were\r\ntreated of and rudely figured; as they were likewise most miserably\r\nin Cuba's _Ortus Sanitatis_, published in 1485, in which insects and\r\n_Crustacea_ were described under the three different denominations of\r\nAnimals, Birds, and Fishes; so that but little profit was at first\r\nderived from the writings of Aristotle, Invertebrate animals not\r\nbeing then even honoured with\r\n\r\n    \"A local habitation and a name.\"\r\n\r\nThis unpromising and apparently hopeless state of the science proved,\r\nhowever, the dawn of its present meridian brightness.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at a separate and systematical arrangement of\r\ninsects subsequent to the times of Aristotle, was made in the\r\nponderous volumes of Ulysses Aldrovandus, who, disregarding the\r\nStagyrite, arranged insects according to the medium they inhabit, as\r\nyou will see in the subjoined table:\r\n\r\n                                             {Membranacea {Favifica.\r\n                                  {Anelytra  {            {Non Favifica.\r\n                          {Alata  {Elytrota. {Farinosa.\r\n                          {\r\n                  {Pedata {\r\n                  {       {Aptera {Paucipeda.\r\n  _I_ {Terrestria {       {       {Multipeda.\r\n  _n_ {           {Apoda\r\n  _s_ {\r\n  _e_ {           {Pedata         {Paucipeda.\r\n  _c_ {           {               {Multipeda\r\n  _t_ {Aquatica   {\r\n  _a_             {Apoda\r\n\r\nThis artificial and meager system, which mixed insects with\r\n_Annelida_, was adopted by Charlton and other authors; and even\r\nin the eighteenth century had a patron of great eminence, who,\r\nendeavouring to improve upon it, has rendered it still more\r\nat variance with nature and Aristotle: I mean the celebrated\r\nVallisnieri, to whom in other respects, though in this he fell behind\r\nhis age, the science was under great obligations. He divides insects\r\ninto, 1. Those that inhabit _vegetable_ substances living or dead.\r\n2. Those that inhabit any kind of _fluid_ and in any state. 3. Those\r\nthat inhabit any _earthy_ or _mineral_ substances, _dead bones_, or\r\n_shells_. And 4. Those that inhabit _living animals_[1352].\r\n\r\nThe work that is usually called Mouffet's _Theatrum Insectorum_ was\r\nproduced in the present era, and was the fruit of the successive\r\nlabours of several men of talent. Dr. Edward Wotton and the\r\ncelebrated Conrade Gesner laid the foundation; whose manuscripts\r\nfalling into the hands of Dr. Thomas Penny,--an eminent physician and\r\nbotanist of the Elizabethan age[1353], much devoted to the study of\r\ninsect,--he upon this foundation meditated raising a superstructure\r\nwhich should include a complete history of these animals; and with\r\nthis view he devoted the leisure hours of fifteen years of his\r\nlife to the study of every book then extant that treated of the\r\nscience either expressly or incidentally, and to the description\r\nand figuring of such insects as he could procure; but before he had\r\nreduced his materials to order, in 1589 he was snatched away by\r\nan untimely death. His unfinished manuscripts were purchased at a\r\nconsiderable price by Mouffet, a contemporary physician of singular\r\nlearning[1354], who reduced them to order, improved the style,\r\nadded new matter, and not less than 150 additional figures; and\r\nthus having prepared the work for the press, intended to dedicate\r\nit to queen Elizabeth[1355]. Fate, however, seemed still to frown\r\nupon the undertaking, for before he could commit his labours to\r\nthe press he also died, and his book remained buried in dust and\r\nobscurity till it fell into the hands of Sir Theodore Mayerne, baron\r\nd'Aubone, one of the court physicians in the time of Charles I.,\r\nwho at length published it, prefixing a Dedication to Sir William\r\nPaddy, baronet, M.D., in 1634; and it was so well received that an\r\nEnglish translation appeared twenty-four years afterwards. The work\r\nthus repeatedly rescued from destruction was indisputably the most\r\ncomplete entomological treatise that had then appeared. And though\r\nthe arrangement (in which there is scarcely any attempt at system)\r\nis extremely defective, the figures very rude, often incorrect, and\r\nsometimes altogether false,--yet as an introduction to the study of\r\ninsects its value at that day must have been very considerable; and\r\nas a copious storehouse of ancient entomological lore, it has not\r\neven at present lost its utility.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable works of the era we are upon was published\r\nat Lignitz in the year 1603, by Caspar Schwenckfeeld, a physician\r\nof Hirschberg, under the title of _Theriotrophium Silesiæ_. This\r\nwas probably the first attempt at a Fauna that ever was made. In it\r\nanimals are divided into quadrupeds, reptiles, birds, fishes, and\r\ninsects. The _Crustacea_, _Mollusca_, and _Zoophytes_, are included\r\nunder fishes. He says of the _Spongiæ_ that they are _moved_ by\r\nanimalcula which inhabit them[1356]. Did he borrow this observation\r\nfrom Aristotle, or was it made by himself[1357]? It is singular\r\nthat Linné should never allude to this work. Goedart, who belongs\r\nalso to this era, is stated to have spent forty years of his life\r\nin attending to the proceedings of insects[1358]. But after this\r\nlong study, his principal use to the science was the improvement he\r\neffected in the drawing and engraving of them,--for his figures,\r\nthough sometimes incorrect and sometimes fabulous, were far superior\r\nto those of his predecessors.\r\n\r\n3. _The Era of Swammerdam and Ray, or of the_ Metamorphotic _System_.\r\nThe great men whose names are here united, as they were cotemporary, so\r\nthey agreed in founding their respective systems of insects on the same\r\nbasis. To the former, however, is due the merit of being the first who\r\nassumed the _metamorphoses_ of these animals as the basis of a natural\r\narrangement of them; upon which the latter, in conjunction with his\r\nlamented friend Willughby, erected that superstructure which opened the\r\ndoor for the present improved state of the science. Swammerdam's system\r\nmay be thus expressed in modern language:\r\n\r\n            {Class i. Metamorphosis complete[1359] = _Aptera_ L.[1360]\r\n            {\r\n            {     ii. ------ semicomplete  {_Orthoptera_,\r\n            {                              {  _Hemiptera_.\r\n            {                              {_Libellulina_,\r\n            {                              {  _Ephemerina_[1361].\r\n            {\r\n  _Insects_ {              {               {_Coleoptera_,\r\n            {              {               {  _Hymenoptera_, part of\r\n            {              { incomplete    {  _Neuroptera_ and\r\n            {    iii. -----{               {  _Diptera_[1362].\r\n            {              {\r\n            {              { obtected       _Lepidoptera_[1363].\r\n            {\r\n            {     iv. ---- coarctate       {_Ichneumones_\r\n            {                              {  _minuti_ L.[1364]\r\n            {                              {_Muscidæ_, &c[1365].\r\n\r\nIt was a great point gained in the science to introduce the\r\nconsideration of the metamorphosis, and to employ it in the extrication\r\nof the natural system: for though when taken by itself it will, as in\r\nthe table just given, lead to an artificial arrangement, it furnishes\r\na very useful clue when the consideration of insects in their perfect\r\nstate is added to it. The tables contained in the _Prolegomena_ to\r\nRay's _Historia Insectorum_ divide insects into those which undergo\r\nno change of form, and those which change their form. The arrangement\r\nof the former Αμεταμορφωτα was made by Willughby, who subdivided them\r\ninto _Apoda_ and _Pedata_. As the only insects included in the former\r\nsection were the grubs of _Œstri_, the remainder being _Annelida_,\r\nthey need not be included in our table. I have endeavoured to compress\r\nthese tables into as small a space as possible, by using the Linnean\r\nterms for metamorphosis, and reducing Ray's tribes of _Orthoptera_,\r\n_Hemiptera_, and _Neuroptera_ to their modern denominations.\r\n\r\nRay details at considerable length the various tribes belonging to\r\nthe four classes of metamorphosis established by Swammerdam[1366].\r\nMost of his tribes indicate natural groups of greater or less value:\r\nbut some of his larger groups are artificial, as you will see by the\r\nmere inspection of the table.\r\n\r\n  INSECTA\r\n\r\n      _Ametamorphota_\r\n\r\n          Apoda\r\n              _Terrestia_[1367].\r\n              _Aquatica_.\r\n\r\n          Pedata\r\n\r\n              _Hexapoda_\r\n\r\n                  _Terrestia_[1368]\r\n                      _Majora_[1368].\r\n                      _Minora_[1369].\r\n\r\n                  _Aquatica_[1370].\r\n\r\n              _Octopoda_\r\n                  Caudata[1371].\r\n                  Non caudata[1372].\r\n\r\n              14-_poda_.\r\n\r\n              24-_poda_.\r\n\r\n              30-_poda_.\r\n\r\n              _Polypoda_\r\n\r\n                  Terrestia\r\n                      _Cylindrica_[1373].\r\n                      _Compressa_[1374].\r\n\r\n                  Aquatica[1375]\r\n                      _Corpore tereti_.\r\n                         ------ _plano_.\r\n                      _Bicaudata_.\r\n\r\n      _Metamorphumena_\r\n\r\n          Metamorphosis semicompleta[1376]\r\n              _Orthoptera_.\r\n              _Heteroptera_.\r\n              _Homoptera_.\r\n              _Libellulina_.\r\n              _Ephemerina_.\r\n\r\n          Metamorphosis incompleta vel obtecta\r\n\r\n              _Coleoptera_.\r\n\r\n              _Anelytra_\r\n\r\n                  Alis farinaceis[1377].\r\n\r\n                  Alis membranaceis\r\n\r\n                      _Diptera_.\r\n\r\n                      _Tetrapter_\r\n\r\n                          Gregaria et Favifica\r\n                              _Mellifica_[1378].\r\n                              _Non Mellifica_[1379].\r\n\r\n                          Solitaria non Gregaria et Favifica\r\n\r\n                              _Apiformia_[1380].\r\n\r\n                              _Vespiformia_\r\n                                  Breviora[1381].\r\n                                  Augustiora[1382].\r\n\r\n                              _Papilioniformia_[1383].\r\n\r\n                              _Seticaudæ_, seu _Tripilia_[1384].\r\n\r\n          Metamorphosis coarctata\r\n              _Muscidæ_ et\r\n              _Ichneumones minuti_ L.[1385]\r\n\r\nThis era produced several great and original geniuses, who enriched\r\nthe science with a vast increment of real knowledge. The illustrious\r\nZoologists whose names it bears,--the one by his dissections and\r\nanatomical researches, and the other by his concise and well drawn\r\ndescriptions of numerous insects, by various interesting observations\r\non their manners and characters, and by the purity of his\r\nlatinity,--contributed greatly to its progress towards perfection.\r\nLeeuwenhoek also, the compatriot of Swammerdam, and Hooke of Ray,\r\namongst other objects submitted to their powerful microscopes,\r\ndid not neglect insects.--To the former we are indebted for the\r\nremarkable discovery that the flea belongs to those that undergo a\r\nmetamorphosis. Ray had besides two coadjutors whose names ought not\r\nto be forgotten,--Willughby and Dr. Martin Lister. The former is\r\ncharacterized by his lamenting friend as one of the profoundest of\r\nnaturalists, as well as one of the most amiable and virtuous of men.\r\nWhat advantage Entomology would have reaped from his labours may be\r\ninferred from the eminent services that he rendered that science,\r\namongst other branches of Zoology, during his short life. It appears\r\nfrom Ray's Letters[1386], that he drew up a history of insects and\r\n_exsanguia_, which probably formed the groundwork of the posthumous\r\n_Historia Insectorum_ of that author; concerning which he says, \"The\r\nwork which I have now entered upon is indeed too great a task for me:\r\nI rely chiefly on Mr. Willughby's discoveries and the contributions\r\nof friends[1387].\" And indeed Willughby's name and initials occur\r\nso frequently in that work, that it may be esteemed their joint\r\nproduction. Lister by his various writings elucidated many points\r\nrelating to insects; and he may be regarded as the first modern who\r\nobserved that spiders can sail in the air. But the most important\r\nof his works, and that on which his fame as an Entomologist is\r\nprincipally founded, is his admirable treatise _De Araneis_; in which\r\nhis systematic arrangement of these animals leaves far behind all\r\nformer attempts, and rivals that of the best modern Arachnologists.\r\nHis specific descriptions are drawn with a precision till then\r\nunknown; and each is headed by a short definition of the species,\r\nwhich he calls the _Titulus_, synonymous with the _Nomen specificum_\r\nof Linné, whose canon of twelve words it rarely exceeds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important events of this era was the complete\r\nexposure and refutation of the absurd doctrine of _equivocal\r\ngeneration_, which had maintained its ground in the schools of\r\nphilosophy from the time of Aristotle. Our own immortal Harvey was\r\nthe first who dared to controvert this irrational theory: and his\r\n_dictum_--_Omnia ex ovo_--was copiously discussed and completely\r\nestablished by two of the ablest physiologists that Italy has\r\nproduced, Redi and Malpighi.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the publication of the _Historia Insectorum_, no other\r\nworks of eminence, with the exception of Madam Merian's beautiful\r\nillustration of the metamorphosis of the insects of Surinam,\r\nmade their appearance: but in the interval of twenty-five years,\r\nwhich elapsed between the publication of that work and of Linné's\r\nfirst outline of his _Systema Naturæ_, Entomologists became more\r\nnumerous and active. In England the pious and learned author of the\r\n_Physico_ and _Astro-Theology_ was celebrated for the assiduity\r\nwith which he studied insects; and in the former of these works has\r\nconcentrated a vast number of interesting observations connected\r\nwith their anatomy and history. No Englishman contributed more to\r\nthe progress of Natural History, both as a writer and collector,\r\nthan that disinterested physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane,\r\nwhose extensive and valuable library and well-stored cabinets formed\r\nthe original nucleus of the present vast collection of the British\r\nMuseum. Amongst other departments, that of insects was not overlooked\r\nby him; and it is to be regretted that those which he had accumulated\r\nhave either perished from neglect or are not accessible. Other\r\nEntomologists were eminent at this period in Britain. The principal\r\nof these were Petiver, Dale (to whom Ray bequeathed his collection\r\nof insects), Bobart, Bradley, and Dandridge; the last of whom, as\r\nBradley tells us, delineated and described 140 species of spiders.\r\n\r\nI must not omit here to observe that our ROYAL SOCIETY, the origin\r\nof which took place in this era, communicated a new and powerful\r\nimpulse to the public mind in favour of Physical Science, and greatly\r\naccelerated the progress of Natural History. It acted not only as a\r\ncentre of excitement which stimulated to exertion, but also as a focus\r\nto collect the scattered rays of light before they were dissipated.\r\nInsulated observations in every department of nature were thus\r\npreserved; and communications from the most eminent naturalists in\r\nvarious parts of Europe ornamented its _Transactions_. So that from\r\nthe establishment of this illustrious Society, the triumphant march of\r\nPhysical Science of every kind towards its acme may be dated.\r\n\r\n4. _Era of Linné, or of the_ Alary _System._ We are now arrived\r\nat that period in the history of Natural Knowledge, especially\r\nof Entomology, in which it received that form, with respect to\r\nits general outline, which, amidst many lesser mutations, has\r\nbeen preserved ever since. Swammerdam had altogether deserted the\r\nsystem of Aristotle, and Ray mixed it with that of his predecessor.\r\nBut a brilliant star soon appeared in the North[1388], which was\r\ndestined to be the harbinger of a brighter day than had ever\r\nbefore illuminated the path of the student of the works of God.\r\nThe illustrious philosopher whose name distinguishes this new era,\r\nimbibed a taste for Entomology almost as early as for Botany[1389];\r\nand though the latter became his favourite, and absorbed his\r\nprincipal attention, he did not altogether neglect the former. In\r\nthe first edition of his _Systema Naturæ_, published in 1735, and\r\ncontained in only _fourteen_ folio pages[1390], he began to arrange\r\nthe three kingdoms of nature after his own conceptions. But this\r\ninitiatory sketch, as might be expected, was very imperfect; and with\r\nrespect to insects, instead of an improvement upon his predecessors,\r\nwas extremely inferior to what Ray had effected; for he puts into one\r\nOrder (to which he gives the name of _Angioptera_) the _Lepidoptera_,\r\n_Neuroptera_, _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_. In this work, however,\r\nGeneric Characters were first given. In successive editions he\r\ncontinued to improve upon this outline: in the _fourth_ he finally\r\nsettled the _number_ and _denominations_ of his Orders; and in the\r\ntwelfth (uniting the _Orthoptera_, which he had at first considered\r\nas of a _Coleopterous_ type, to the _Hemiptera_) also their _limits_.\r\nHis system, being founded upon the absence or presence and characters\r\nof the organs for flight, is in some degree a republication of the\r\nAristotelian, and may be called the _Alary_ System.\r\n\r\n        {   { Superior { crustaceous with a straight _Coleoptera_  1.\r\n        {   {          {   suture\r\n        {   {          { semicrustaceous, incumbent  _Hemiptera_   2.\r\n        { 4.{          { imbricated with             _Lepidoptera_ 3.\r\n        {   {          {   scales\r\n  Wings {   { All      { membranous--  { unarmed  }  _Neuroptera_  4.\r\n        {              {   Anus        { aculeate }  _Hymenoptera_ 5.\r\n        { 2.

Or without either wings or              _Aptera_      7.\r\n        {      elytra\r\n\r\nIn considering this table, it must strike every one acquainted\r\nwith the subject, that although the assumption of a single set of\r\norgans whereon to build a system can scarcely be expected to lead\r\nto one perfectly natural, yet that the majority of the groups here\r\ngiven as Orders merit that character. The _second_ indeed and the\r\n_last_ require further subdivision, and concerning the _fourth_\r\nno satisfactory conclusion has yet been drawn. With regard to his\r\n_series_ of the Orders, it is mostly artificial. Linné has the\r\nadvantage of all his predecessors in giving clearer definitions of\r\nhis Orders, and in their nomenclature; in which he has followed the\r\npath first trodden by Aristotle.\r\n\r\nOne of his most prominent excellencies, which led the way more than\r\nany thing else to a distinct knowledge of natural objects, was his\r\ngiving definitions of his genera, or the groups that he distinguished\r\nby that name, since all preceding writers had merely made them known\r\nby the imposition of a _name_. His generic characters of insects\r\nwere of _two_ kinds: A shorter, containing the supposed _essential_\r\ndistinction of the genus, given at the head of the _Class_; and\r\nanother, generally longer, and including _non-essentials_, given at\r\nthe head of the _Genus_. The first he denominated the _essential_,\r\nand the latter the _factitious_ or _artificial_ character. He did not\r\ndo for insects what he did for Botany,--draw up what he has called\r\nthe _natural_ character of a genus, which included both the others,\r\nand noticed every other generic distinction[1391].\r\n\r\nThe older Naturalists used to treasure in their memories a short\r\ndescription of each species, by which when they wished to speak\r\nor write of it they made it known. Thus, in speaking of the\r\ncommon lady-bird they would call it \"the _Coccinella_ with red\r\n_coleoptra_[1392] having seven black dots.\" This enunciation of any\r\nobject was at first called its Title (_Titulus_), and afterwards\r\nits Specific Name (_Nomen specificum_), and by Linné was restricted\r\nto _twelve_ words[1393]. But as the number of species increased to\r\nremember each definition was no easy task; that he might remedy\r\nthis inconvenience, he invented what is called the Trivial Name\r\n(_Nomen triviale_), which expressed any species by a single term\r\nadded to its generic appellation, as _Coccinella septem-punctata_;\r\nand thereby conferred a lasting benefit on Natural History. This\r\nconvenient invention has rendered it less necessary to restrict the\r\n_Nomen specificum_ to twelve words: it is desirable, however, that\r\nthe definition of a species should be as short as possible, and\r\ncontain only its _distinctive_ characters. In his definitions and\r\ndescriptions Linné was often very happy; but sometimes, in studying\r\nto avoid prolixity, he forgets Horace's hint,\r\n\r\n    ... \"Brevis esse laboro\r\n    Obscurus fio--\"\r\n\r\nand makes his definitions of species, without adding a description,\r\nso extremely short as to suit equally well perhaps a dozen different\r\ninsects. The minor groups into which he has divided some of his\r\nOrders and Genera are sometimes natural, sometimes artificial. Those\r\nof the _Coleoptera_, from characters drawn from their antennæ (as is\r\nevident from his arrangement of the genera in that Order), are of the\r\nlatter description; while those of his _Aptera_ are more natural.\r\nThe genera that he has most happily laboured in this respect are his\r\nHemipterous ones of _Gryllus_, _Cicada_, and _Cimex_, and all his\r\n_Lepidoptera_. He had such a tact for discovering natural groups in\r\ngeneral, that in him it seems almost to have been intuitive.\r\n\r\nBut in no respect were the labours of Linné more beneficial to the\r\nscience and to Zoology in general, than when he undertook to describe\r\nthe animals of his own country. His _Fauna Suecica_ is an admirable\r\nexemplar, which ought to stimulate the Zoologists of every country to\r\nmake it one of their first objects that its animal productions shall\r\nno longer remain unregistered and undescribed. Botanists have almost\r\nevery where been diligent in effecting this with respect to plants,\r\nbut other branches of Natural History have been more neglected. In\r\nhis _Systema Naturæ_ Linné attempted this for all the productions\r\nof our globe. The idea was a vast one; and the execution, though\r\nnecessarily falling far short of it, did him infinite honour: and in\r\nit he has laid a foundation for his successors to build upon till\r\ntime shall be no more.\r\n\r\nSuch were the services rendered to Entomology by the labours of the\r\nimmortal Swede; services so extensive as well as eminent, that had\r\nthey been the fruit of a whole life devoted to this single object,\r\nthey would have entitled him to a high rank amongst the heroes of\r\nthe science. But how much more astonishing are they when considered\r\nbut as gleanings from his hours of relaxation, snatched from labours\r\ninfinitely greater, the produce, as he himself tells us, of moments\r\nconsumed by others in \"venationibus, confabulationibus, tesseris,\r\nchartis, lusibus, compotationibus[1394].\" It is not so much in original\r\ndiscovery that the merits of Linné lie,--though considered in this view\r\nthey are pre-eminent,--as in the unrivalled skill with which he sifted\r\nthe observations of his predecessors, separating the ore from the\r\ndross, and concentrating scattered rays of light into one focus.\r\n\r\nThis era produced other systematists who adopted various methods, but\r\nnone that merit particular notice except Geoffroy and De Geer. The\r\nformer in this view is principally celebrated as the author of the\r\nmethod generally adopted by modern Entomologists, of dividing the\r\n_Coleoptera_ into primary sections, according to the number of the\r\njoints of their tarsi. This method, though in many instances, as was\r\nformerly observed[1395], it leads to artificial results, in others\r\naffords a clue to natural groups; it can only therefore be applied\r\nsubject to frequent exceptions. Geoffroy's work[1396], which was\r\npublished in 1764, was further serviceable by indicating many genera\r\nnot defined by Linné.\r\n\r\n\r\n            GENERAL         ORDERS.

Both as a systematist, anatomist,\r\nand physiologist, and as the observant historian of the manners\r\nand economy of insects, his _Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire des\r\nInsectes_ are above all praise. His system[1397] is contained in a\r\nposthumous volume published in 1778[1398].\r\n\r\nThis system, though built upon the instruments of flight; in its\r\nternary groups, equivalent to the Orders of Linné, adds likewise the\r\ninstruments of manducation, and is thus intermediate between that\r\nof Linné and Fabricius, who perhaps from the consideration of it\r\nmight derive the first idea of assuming the last-mentioned organs\r\nas the basis of a new method. But, though partaking of both, it is\r\nnearer to nature than either; and had its illustrious author laid\r\nless stress upon the number and substance of the organs of flight,\r\nit would probably have been as near perfection in this respect\r\nas most that have succeeded it. But following too strictly these\r\ncharacters, he has been led to place in different Classes, or rather\r\nOrders, insects that ought not to have been so separated,--as in the\r\ncase of the two sections of the _Hemiptera_, and the _Coccidæ_. In\r\nother respects the whole of De Geer's _Mémoires_ are a storehouse\r\nof valuable observations, in which he has furnished many a clue\r\nfor threading the labyrinth of nature, and given most complete and\r\ninteresting histories of the whole economy and habits of many tribes\r\nand genera,--as of the _Trichoptera_, _Aphides_, _Ephemerina_, &c.\r\n\r\nIn this latter department of the science a light shone during part\r\nof the era we are now considering, which eclipsed every one that\r\nappeared before it, and has scarcely been equalled by any one that\r\nsucceeded it. The date of its first appearance, indeed, was a year\r\nbefore that of Linné's first outline of his _Systema Naturæ_ before\r\nalluded to; but it may properly be regarded as belonging to his era,\r\nsince it did not disappear till some years after that had begun. A\r\nvolume indeed would scarcely suffice to do justice to the preeminent\r\nmerits of Reaumur, as exhibited in his admirable _Mémoires pour\r\nl'Histoire des Insectes_[1399]: I must therefore content myself\r\nwith observing, that in judgement and ingenuity in planning his\r\nexperiments; in patient assiduity in watching their progress; in the\r\nelegance of his language, and the felicity of his illustrations, he\r\nhas rarely, if ever, been equalled. Every subject that he undertook\r\nwas thoroughly investigated, and in the true spirit of philosophical\r\ninquiry. Every where you see him the same unprejudiced and profound\r\nobserver, attached to no system, anxious only for truth and the\r\nadvancement of science. If he has any fault, it is, perhaps, that\r\nof being sometimes too prolix; but we must recollect that from the\r\nnature of his subject much diffuseness was often necessary to render\r\nhis meaning clear. A greater objection is his total inattention\r\nto all system, except with regard to _Lepidoptera_ and their\r\nlarvæ[1400], so that it is often difficult to ascertain the insects\r\nwhose history he gives. But with these exceptions, no observer\r\nof nature, who wishes his discoveries to be at once profound and\r\ninteresting, can copy a better model or one nearer to perfection.\r\n\r\nNext to that of Reaumur, the name of his admiring correspondent\r\nBonnet may be mentioned. This great physiologist, though still more\r\ndeficient in systematical knowledge[1401], was also an admirable\r\nobserver of the economy and manners of insects. In this sense he\r\nbecame an Entomologist before he was seventeen years of age, in\r\nconsequence of an impression made upon him by the account of the\r\nAntlion in that attractive work the _Spectacle de la Nature_. From\r\nverifying its wonderful history with his own eyes, he entered with\r\nenthusiasm upon the study of other insects, his observations on which\r\nhe regularly communicated to Reaumur. Amongst other interesting\r\ninquiries, his experiments on that singular anomaly in nature the\r\ngeneration of _Aphides_[1402] do him the highest credit, and have set\r\nthat question perfectly at rest[1403].\r\n\r\nIn another department of the science this period was distinguished\r\nby a work which may almost be deemed a prodigy. I am speaking of\r\nLyonet's admirable treatise on the anatomy of the caterpillar of the\r\nCossus,--a work which will uphold his reputation as long as Entomology\r\nshall be cultivated as a science, or the comparative Anatomist be\r\ndelighted to trace the footsteps of Divine Wisdom in the gradually\r\nvarying structure of animals. The plates to this publication, executed\r\nby the hand of its excellent author, are as wonderful as the work\r\nitself; and together, to use Bonnet's words, form a _demonstration_\r\nof the existence of GOD. It is infinitely to be regretted that the\r\nauthor of this incomparable monument of scientific ardour and patient\r\nindustry should have died before the full completion of his anatomical\r\ndescription of the _pupa_ and _imago_ of the same insect; of which he\r\nhad prepared a considerable portion of the manuscript, and engraved\r\nupwards of twenty of the plates[1404].\r\n\r\nNumerous other writers in various departments of the science\r\nappeared during this era; but it would be useless to enter into a\r\nparticular detail of their works and merits. I cannot however omit\r\nnoticing, on account of his inimitably accurate and chastely coloured\r\nrepresentations of _Lepidoptera_, Sepp's beautiful _Nederlandsche\r\nInsecten_, in which the whole history of these animals, from the egg\r\nto the fly, is described and portrayed. In our own country this era\r\nwas distinguished by no entomological work of any great eminence.\r\nAlbin, Wilks, and Harris produced the principal. Gould, however,\r\nwithout having any thing of system, gave an admirable account of\r\nEnglish ants, which I formerly noticed[1405].\r\n\r\nOne of our first poets, the celebrated Gray, was also much devoted to\r\nEntomology. From his interleaved copy of the _Systema Naturæ_, that\r\nvenerable and able naturalist, Sir T. G. Cullum, Bart. copied the\r\nfollowing characters of the genera of insects of Linné, drawn up in\r\nLatin Hexameters, which he kindly communicated to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COLEOPTERA.\r\n\r\n               _Alas lorica tectas_ Coleoptera _jactant_.\r\n\r\n                                   *\r\n\r\n  Serra pedum prodit _Scarabæum_ et fissile cornu.\r\n  _Dermesti_ antennæ circum ambit lamina caulem\r\n  Qui caput incurvum timidus sub corpore celat.\r\n  In pectus retrahens caput abdit claviger _Hister_.\r\n  Occiput _Attelabi_ in posticum vergit acumen.\r\n  _Curculio_ ingenti protendit cornua rostro.\r\n  _Silpha_ læves peltæ atque elytrorum exporrigit oras.\r\n  Truncus apex clavæ, atque antennulæ _Coccionellæ_.\r\n\r\n                                   **\r\n\r\n  _Cassida_ sub clypei totam se margine condit.\r\n  _Chrysomela_ inflexa loricæ stringitur ora.\r\n  Gibba caput _Meloë_ incurvat thorace rotundo.\r\n  Oblongus frontem et tenues clypei exerit oras\r\n  _Tenebrio_.

Other societies, with a similar object, were formed in\r\ndifferent parts of Europe, and were attended by similar good effects.\r\nAt Paris, at Berlin, at St. Petersburg, at Moscow, at Turin, at\r\nLisbon, &c., the lovers of Nature, at that time and subsequently, have\r\nassociated for this purpose; and I may mention here, that I may not\r\nrevert to the subject, the great Natural History association of our\r\nown country, THE LINNEAN SOCIETY, named after the illustrious Swede,\r\nwhich was first instituted in 1788, and incorporated by royal charter\r\nin 1802. In the _Transactions_ of this learned body, the Zoologist\r\nin general, and particularly the Entomologist, will find much useful\r\ninformation and many interesting observations connected with his\r\nscience. This flourishing society consists at this time of above 600\r\nmembers, of whom more than 500 are Fellows;--a gratifying proof how\r\nwidely Natural History is cultivated in the British Empire[1406].\r\n\r\n5. _Era of Fabricius, or of the_ Maxillary _System_.--We are now\r\narrived, if its consequences be considered, at one of the most\r\nimportant epochs of the science. Fabricius, a pupil of Linné, who\r\nhighly estimated his entomological acquirements[1407], thinking\r\nthat the system of his master was not built upon a foundation\r\nsufficiently fixed and restricted[1408], conceived the idea of doing\r\nfor Entomology what the latter had done for Botany. As the learned\r\nand illustrious Swede had assumed the _Fructification_ for the basis\r\nof his system in that science, so the emulous and highly-gifted\r\nDane, observing how happily those organs were employed as characters\r\nin extricating the genera of Vertebrate animals, assumed the\r\n_instruments_ of _manducation_, far more numerous and various in\r\ninsects, for the basis of a new system of Entomology; which,\r\nfrom the _maxillæ_ being principally employed to characterize the\r\n_Classes_ or rather _Orders_, may be called the _Maxillary_ System.\r\nDe Geer, indeed, as we have seen above, had, in the majority of his\r\nClasses, to the organs of flight added the parts of the _mouth_: but\r\nFabricius pursued the idea much further, and made the _Trophi_[1409],\r\nor _Instrumenta Cibaria_ as he called them, the sole corner-stone of\r\nhis whole superstructure. Though nothing seems to have been further\r\nfrom his intention than to follow _Nature_, since he complains that\r\nLinné by following her too closely had lost the Ariadnean thread\r\nof system[1410], yet it is singular that, by building upon this\r\nseemingly narrow foundation, he has furnished a clue, by the due use\r\nof which, instead of deserting her, his successors have been enabled\r\nwith more certainty to extricate her groups: since the parts in\r\nquestion being intimately connected with the functions and economy of\r\nthese animals, where they differ materially, indicate a corresponding\r\ndifference in their character and station.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ outline of his System, I believe, appeared in his\r\n_Systema Entomologiæ_ published in 1775; and the _last_, in his\r\n_Supplement_ to his _Entomologia Systematica_ in 1798. In this the\r\nseries and characters of his Classes (for so, after De Geer, he\r\ndenominates his primary groups) were as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   *\r\n\r\n  1.

He admitted, however, that natural Classes, &c. do\r\nexist; but he contended that artificial ones should be substituted\r\nfor them, till further discoveries had cleared the way for their\r\nsatisfactory development[1425]. As therefore his system, in its\r\nprimary and secondary groups, was confessedly artificial, and the\r\nonly use of an _artificial_ system being to facilitate the study of\r\nany department of Natural History, its value must be estimated by\r\nthe facilities it affords to the entomological student. But here,\r\nit must be allowed, that instead of enlarging the entrance to the\r\ntemple of his science, it has made it narrower, and has placed most\r\ndiscouraging impediments in his way.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the definitions of his Classes, you will find them\r\nin a variety of cases calculated rather to mislead than to instruct\r\na learner. Thus that of the _Eleutherata_ would equally well suit\r\nthe _Piezata_ and several others: that of the _Piezata_ is scarcely\r\nto be found in it; since in this the maxilla, instead of being\r\n_corneous_, is usually _coriaceous_[1426], and its lobe sometimes\r\nnearly membranous. In the _Unogata_ he even mistakes the mandibles\r\nfor maxillæ. Let any young Entomologist endeavour to make out the\r\nFabrician class of a _Cicindela_ for instance; and finding its\r\nmaxillæ corneous and armed with a claw, he would conclude that it\r\nbelonged to the _Unogata_ rather than to the _Eleutherata_. Besides\r\nall this, the necessity of examining minute parts not easily come at\r\nwithout dissection, is very discouraging to a beginner.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it is evident, that the system of Fabricius, considered\r\nas an _artificial_ one or a _method_, was no improvement upon the\r\nclassification of his master Linné, but rather a retrograde movement\r\nin the science.\r\n\r\nAs to that part of his system in which he professes to take _nature_\r\nfor his guide, his _genera_,--though even with respect to them he\r\nseems fearful of following her too closely[1427],--he certainly\r\nhas rendered most essential services to Entomology, and laid the\r\nfoundation of all that has since been done for its improvement.\r\nBut it must be observed, that the series of his genera is often\r\naltogether artificial; as where he separates and places far asunder\r\nthe Saprophagous and Thalerophagous Petalocerous beetles.\r\n\r\nEntomology, however, in other respects was deeply indebted to this\r\ngreat man. He first, as was lately observed, directed the attention of\r\nher votaries to parts which enabled them better to follow the chain\r\nof affinities, and to trace out natural groups. In his _Philosophia\r\nEntomologica_, drawn up on the plan of Linné's _Philosophia Botanica_,\r\nhe bequeathed to the science a standard work that ought to be studied\r\nby every Entomologist. His incredible labours in defining new genera\r\nand describing new species, with which view he travelled into various\r\nparts of Europe, and _seven_ times into Britain, have been of infinite\r\nservice[1428], and placed the science upon a footing much nearer to\r\nthat of Botany than it had ever before attained.\r\n\r\n6. _Era of Latreille, or of the_ Eclectic _System_. The system of\r\nFabricius, though generally adopted in Germany and Switzerland, did\r\nnot meet with a _universal_ reception. It seems to have gained no\r\npermanent footing in the North of Europe, Britain, or France. In\r\nthe latter country the Linnean phraseology and characters of the\r\nOrders were retained by the celebrated Olivier; while at the same\r\ntime his definitions of genera were constructed, after the Fabrician\r\nmodel, upon the antennæ and the oral organs. But a new and brilliant\r\ngenius had now appeared in France, whose indefatigable labours and\r\nsingular talents have thrown more light over entomological science\r\nthan those of all his predecessors. In 1796, about two years after\r\nFabricius had completed his _Entomologia Systematica emendata et\r\naucta_, M. Latreille published his _Précis de Caractères Génériques\r\ndes Insectes_; in which important work, walking in the steps\r\nof his great compatriot Bernard de Jussieu, he disregarded all\r\n_artificial_ systems of Entomology, and attempted to construct one\r\nupon a _natural_ basis: and to this end, uniting the consideration\r\nof the instruments of manducation with that of the organs for\r\nflight and motion, and of other external characters,--or the system\r\nof Linné with that of Fabricius,--he became the founder of the\r\nmodern or _Eclectic_ system[1429]; for he judiciously adopted that\r\nsensible _dictum_ of Scopoli, \"Classes et Genera naturalia, non\r\nsola _instrumenta cibaria_, non solæ _alæ_, nec solæ _antennæ_\r\nconstituunt, sed structura _totius_, ac cujusque vel minimi\r\ndiscriminis diligentissima observatio[1430].\" His object has been\r\nin the above and subsequent works, by dividing his Classes into\r\n_natural_ Groups, from the Order to the Genus, to trace out in all\r\nits windings, to its inmost recesses, the perplexing labyrinth of the\r\ntrue system of the CREATOR:--of what he has effected, the subjoined\r\ntables will give you a sufficient idea[1431].\r\n\r\n                                 1817.\r\n\r\n  _Entoma_\r\n\r\n      CLASS: I.

You will also think that his _secondary_ and _minor_\r\ngroups[1433], with the exception of some of his sections, merit the\r\nsame character. Indeed, he has left far behind all his predecessors\r\nin the progress that he has made towards extricating the true system.\r\nSetting out from a common centre he holds on his unwearied course,\r\nendeavouring to trace every set of objects that branches from it\r\nto its extreme term. But though he studied insects _analytically_\r\nwith unrivalled success, he was not always equally happy in his\r\n_synthetical_ arrangement of them. I do not here so much speak of\r\nthe result which must necessarily follow from any arrangement in a\r\n_series_, and which cannot well be avoided; but I allude particularly\r\nto his intire adoption of the Geoffroyan system in the _Coleoptera_,\r\nwhich has prevented him in many instances from seeing the natural\r\ndistribution of his groups.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, two years after the publication of Latreille's first\r\nenunciation of his system, M. Clairville, a very acute and learned\r\nSwiss Entomologist, drew up the following analytical table of insects.\r\n\r\n                                            SECTIONS.\r\n\r\n                                       { 1.

Pododunera.\r\n\r\nEvery one will think that the change of the received names of the\r\nOrders, here denominated Sections, is perfectly needless. The\r\nprincipal merit of this system is the division of insects, tacitly\r\npointed out by Fabricius, into two groups or subclasses, from the\r\nmode in which they take their food.\r\n\r\nLamarck,--whose merits as a Zoologist, except in one point[1434],\r\nare of the highest order,--in his _Système des Animaux sans\r\nVertèbres_, which was published in 1801, adopts the above division\r\nof insects; but, after Aristotle[1435], he makes the _Hymenoptera_\r\nan intermediate Order between the masticators and those that take\r\ntheir food by suction; he places the _Lepidoptera_ at the head of the\r\nlatter, and the _Aphaniptera_, which he denominates _Aptera_, at the\r\nend[1436]: the Hexapod, Octopod, and Polypod _Aptera_ he considers as\r\n_Arachnida_[1437]. In his last great work (_Histoire Naturelle des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertèbres_) he includes the _Hymenoptera_ amongst the\r\nmasticators, and reverses the disposition of his Orders, beginning\r\nwith his _Aptera_ and ending with the _Coleoptera_[1438].\r\n\r\nM. Le Baron Cuvier, in his _Anatomie Comparée_ (1805) divided _Insecta_\r\ninto two subclasses, from the presence or absence of _maxillæ_: thus--\r\n\r\n  _With Maxillæ._          _Without Maxillæ._\r\n\r\n  1. Gnathaptera.          1. Hemiptera.\r\n\r\n  2. Neuroptera.           2. Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  3. Hymenoptera.          3. Diptera.\r\n\r\n  4. Coleoptera.           4. Aptera.\r\n\r\n  5. Orthoptera.\r\n\r\nHis _Gnathaptera_ include the Isopod _Crustacea_, the _Arachnida_,\r\nthe Polypod, and some of the Octopod and Hexapod _Aptera_; and\r\nhis _Aptera_--_Pulex_, _Pediculus_, and the _Acarina_, with the\r\nexclusion of _Hydrachna_[1439]. It is remarkable enough that his\r\nClass as it stands, with a slight alteration, returns into itself,\r\nthus forming a circle; for his first Order (_Gnathaptera_) contains\r\n_Hydrachna_ and the _Thysanura_, and his last (_Aptera_) ends with\r\nthe _Anoplura_, and _Acarina_.\r\n\r\nAll the French Entomologists have followed Olivier and Latreille in\r\nadopting, with some variation, Geoffroy's system with regard to the\r\n_Coleoptera_, which has rendered them all more or less artificial.\r\nDumeril has constructed a table of the Order, arranged differently\r\nfrom that above given[1440] of Latreille; but not more natural, for\r\nthe very same reason.\r\n\r\nOur learned countryman, Dr. Leach, by his zoological labours has\r\nthrown much light on the natural distribution of the Animal Kingdom,\r\nand no department of that kingdom is more indebted to him than the\r\n_Annulosa_; of which I have before stated to you his _Classes_[1441].\r\nI shall now give a table of his _Orders_ of _Arachnida_ and _Insecta_\r\nLatr. and also his families, &c. of his Classes _Myriapoda_ and\r\n_Arachnides_[1442].\r\n\r\n  CLASS.

His\r\nOrders, however, of _Arachnida_ must be excepted from this remark,\r\nsince they are evidently artificial. His analyses of his Orders,\r\nthough in general they give natural groups, are usually not carried\r\nso far as those of M. Latreille, so as seldom to indicate what may\r\nproperly be denominated _families_. He has made his nomenclature for\r\nhis so-called families more uniform and satisfactory than that of\r\nthe French Entomologist: and we may say, with respect to the extent\r\nand effect of his zoological labours,--_Nihil non tetigit, et omnia\r\nquæ tetigit ornavit_.\r\n\r\n7. _Era of MacLeay, or of the_ Quinary _System._ I have more than once\r\nstated to you in my former letters the bases upon which the system\r\nwhich I am in the last place to explain to you is built. You know\r\nthe Sub-kingdoms and Classes into which its learned and ingenious\r\nauthor, upon a novel and most remarkable plan, has divided the Animal\r\nKingdom[1444]. I shall now copy for you his diagram of the _Annulosa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNULOSA]\r\n\r\nI have before sufficiently noticed these Classes, or _Orders_ as\r\nMr. MacLeay terms them, of the Sub-kingdom _Annulosa_: I shall here\r\ntherefore only throw out a few remarks on their composition. With\r\nregard to their _circular_ distribution in the _Crustacea_, Mr.\r\nMacLeay thinks the series runs from the Branchiopods or _Monoculus_\r\nL. to the Decapods or _Cancer_ L.; and so on, till by means perhaps\r\nof the genus _Bopyrus_, which Fabricius regards as a _Monoculus_, it\r\nreturns to the Branchiopods again. This circle, through _Porcellio_,\r\na kind of wood-louse, &c., which has only a pair of antennæ and at\r\nfirst but six legs, is connected with the _Ametabola_ Class, which\r\nbeginning with _Glomeris_ goes by the other _Chilognatha_ (_Iulus_\r\nL.), having also six legs at first, and certain _Vermes_ to the\r\n_Anoplura_, and terminates in the _Chilopoda_ (_Scolopendra_ L.)\r\ntheir cognate tribe[1445]. From the _Ametabola_ Mr. MacLeay proceeds\r\nto the _Mandibulata_, between which two groups he has discovered\r\nno osculant one, but he takes the _Anoplura_ of the former as the\r\ntransit to the _Coleoptera_ in the latter; from whence passing to\r\nthe _Orthoptera_, &c., he finally returns by the _Hymenoptera_.\r\nBetween the _Mandibulata_ likewise and _Haustellata_ he finds no\r\nosculant class: but as the affinity between the _Trichoptera_ and\r\n_Lepidoptera_ is evident, proceeding by the _Homoptera_ he returns\r\nto the _Lepidoptera_ by certain _Diptera_, as _Psychoda_, &c. From\r\nthe _Aptera_ Lam. or _Pulex_ L. he passes by the osculant class\r\n_Nycteribida_ to the _Arachnida_; and beginning with the _Acaridea_,\r\nhe goes to the _Scorpionidea_, and so to the _Aranidea_ or spiders,\r\nwhich he connects with the Decapod _Crustacea_;--thus forming his\r\ngreat circle of _five_ smaller ones, each of which, as well as that\r\nwhich they form, returns into itself[1446].\r\n\r\nWe next take his Circles of _Mandibulata_: thus--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANDIBULATA]\r\n\r\nIn this arrangement of the _tribes_, as he calls them, of\r\n_Mandibulata_, Mr. MacLeay sets out from the _Coleoptera_, which\r\nhe distributes, according to the supposed typical forms of their\r\n_larvæ_, into five minor groups, sufficiently noticed on a former\r\noccasion[1447]. From this tribe or Order he proposes to pass by\r\n_Atractocerus_ to the osculant Order _Strepsiptera_, and from thence\r\nby _Myrmecodes_ and the Ants to the _Hymenoptera_. From hence he next\r\nproceeds to his _Trichoptera_; in which, as we have seen[1447], he\r\nplaces not only _Phryganea_ L., but also _Tenthredo_ L. and _Perla_\r\nGeoffr., making his transit by _Sirex_ L.; forming an osculant\r\nOrder which he denominates _Bomboptera_. From this his way to the\r\n_Neuroptera_ is by the _Perlides_, with _Sialis_ as an osculant Order\r\nunder the name of _Megaloptera_: he enters by _Chauliodes_, and\r\nleaves it by _Panorpa_ or _Raphidia_ by means of _Boreus_, forming\r\nalso an osculant Order (_Raphioptera_) for the _Orthoptera_; which\r\nhe enters by _Phasma_, _Mantis_, &c., and leaves by _Gryllus_,\r\nentering the _Coleoptera_ again by the osculant Order _Dermaptera_\r\nformed of _Forficula_ L.: and thus returning to the point from\r\nwhich he set out[1448]. He has not, however, made this return of\r\nthe series into itself so clear in each order, excepting in the\r\n_Orthoptera_, as he has done in the whole Class or Sub-class. Thus\r\nin the _Coleoptera_ there appears no particular affinity between the\r\nPredaceous and Vesicant beetles, his first and fifth forms[1449], or\r\nhis Chilopodimorphous _Coleoptera_, and his Thysanurimorphous.\r\n\r\nTo enter fully into his doctrine of Analogies would lead us into\r\na very wide field, and occupy a larger space than I can afford;\r\nI must therefore refer you to his work for more particular and\r\ndetailed information on that subject. With regard to the analogy\r\nbetween opposite points of contiguous circles, you may get a very\r\ngood idea of it from his diagram of Saprophagous and Thalerophagous\r\nPetalocerous beetles, which I here subjoin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is a very singular circumstance that in these two circles we have\r\ntwo sets of insects,--one _impure_ in its habits and feeding upon\r\n_putrescent_ food, and the other _clean_ and nourished by food that has\r\nsuffered no _decay_,--set in contrast with each other, and that in each\r\nof the opposite groups, the one has its counterpart in some respect\r\nin the other. In none is this more striking than the _Scarabæidæ_ and\r\n_Cetoniadæ_, both remarkable for having soft membranous mandibles unfit\r\nfor mastication, and both living upon juices, the one in a putrescent\r\nand the other in an undecayed state[1450].\r\n\r\nOur learned author in subsequent works has stated every circle to be\r\nresolvable into _two_ superior groups, which he denominates _normal_\r\nor typical, and _three_ inferior ones, which he calls _aberrant_ or\r\nannectent[1451].\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this account of the various _general_ systems\r\nthat have distinguished the different entomological eras, i must\r\nsay a few words on those _partial_ ones which have been founded\r\non the _neuration_ of the _wings_ of insects. Frisch, who died\r\nin 1743, attempted something in this way[1452]: Harris, in his\r\n_Exposition of English Insects_ published in 1782, had arranged his\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_ according to characters derived from this\r\nsame circumstance[1453]: Mr. Jones in the _Linnean Transactions_\r\nhad made good use of it in dividing the _Diurnal Lepidoptera_ into\r\ngroups[1454]: and in the _Monographia Apum Angliæ_, the characters\r\nexhibited by the various groups into which Linné's genus _Apis_ was\r\nresolvable, as to the neuration of their wings, were described[1455].\r\nBut M. Jurine was the first Entomologist who made that circumstance\r\nthe keystone of a system; which indeed he restricted to Hymenopterous\r\nand Dipterous insects, but which might be extended much further. As\r\nthis system has been before sufficiently enlarged upon[1456], I need\r\nhere only mention it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo particularize the various entomological works in every department of\r\nthe science, that have appeared since the commencement of the era of\r\nFabricius, would require a volume. Such was its progress and spread,\r\nthat in every corner of Europe the pens and pencils of able and eminent\r\nmen, whose works have almost all been quoted in the course of our\r\ncorrespondence, have been employed to illustrate it[1457].\r\n\r\nI may observe, however, that the _Internal Anatomy_ of Insects,\r\na branch of Entomology which on account of its difficulty, from\r\nthe extreme nicety required in dissecting them, had before been\r\ncultivated by scarcely more than a single student in an age, has\r\nnow attracted numerous votaries. In Germany--Carus, Gaede, Herold,\r\nPosselt, Ramdohr, Rifferschweils, Sprengel, and others, have\r\ndistinguished themselves in this arena: and in France, besides the\r\nillustrious Baron Cuvier (himself a host), Marcel de Serres, Leon\r\nDufour, and very recently, by his elaborate essays _On the Flight\r\nof Insects_ and its wonderful apparatus, one of the most acute of\r\nanatomical physiologists, M. Chabrier,--have all contributed greatly\r\nto the elucidation of this interesting part of the science. In our\r\nown country very little has hitherto been effected in this line; but\r\na learned Oxford Professor (Kidd) has presented to the Royal Society\r\nan account of the anatomy of the Mole-cricket, which entitles him to\r\nan eminent station amongst the above worthies.\r\n\r\nI may likewise further observe, that the _pictorial_ department of\r\nEntomology was, during the period I am speaking of, carried to its\r\ngreatest perfection. Painters of insects formerly were satisfied\r\nwith giving a representation generally correct, without attempting\r\na faithful delineation of all the minor parts, particularly as to\r\n_number_;--for instance, the joints of the antennæ and tarsi, the\r\nareolets of the wings, &c.: but now no one gives satisfaction as an\r\nentomological artist unless he is accurate in these respects.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1316] See above, p. 364--.\r\n\r\n[1317] _Genes._, ii. 19--.\r\n\r\n[1318] _Pol.

For descriptions of the _Genera_ and\r\n_Species_ of insects in general, he must have recourse to the\r\n_Entomologia Systematica emendata et aucta_ of Fabricius, and its\r\n_Supplement_; to the volumes he subsequently published under the\r\ntitles _Systema Eleutheratorum_, _Rhyngotorum_, _Glossatorum_,\r\n_Piezatorum_, and _Antliatorum_; to the _Genera Crustaceorum et\r\nInsectorum_ of Latreille; to the same department of the _Règne\r\nAnimal_ of Cuvier; and to the _Animaux sans Vertèbres_ of Lamarck.\r\nHe will find the genera of Linné and Fabricius illustrated by\r\n_figures_, in Rœmer's _Genera_; and many of the species described\r\nby the latter in Coquebert's _Illustratio Iconographica_. In our\r\ncountryman Drury's beautiful _Illustrations of Natural History_,\r\na large number of new and rare insects are depicted; and in Mr.\r\nDonovan's _Insects of China, India, and New Holland_, some of the\r\nmost brilliant and interesting that have been imported from those\r\ncountries. Panzer's _Faunæ Insectorum Germanicæ Initia_ has little\r\nshort of 3000 figures of insects of every Order (a considerable\r\nnumber of which are found to inhabit Britain), by the celebrated\r\nSturm; and the latter, in his _Deutschlands Fauna_, has illustrated\r\nmany Coleopterous genera analytically (as has also M. Clairville the\r\nweevils and Predaceous beetles of Switzerland in his _Entomologie\r\nHelvétique_) by his admirable pencil. Beetles in general are well\r\nfigured and described in Olivier's splendid _Entomologie_; as are\r\nthose of Europe in a beautiful work now in course of publication,\r\nunder the title of _Coleoptères d'Europe_, by MM. Latreille and\r\nDejean. The latter author has also begun a work on this Order under\r\nthe title of _Species général des Coléoptères de la Collection de\r\nM. Le Comte Dejean_; two volumes of which have appeared, containing\r\npart of the _Carabici_ Latr. but I fear it has stopped for want of\r\nencouragement. Had the descriptions been less verbose it would have\r\nhad a better chance of success. For the _Orthoptera_ and _Hemiptera_,\r\nthe student must have recourse to Stoll's _Spectres_, _Mantes_,\r\n_Sauterelles_, _Grillons_, _Blattes_, _Cigales_, and _Punaises_. To\r\na knowledge of the species of _Lepidoptera_, the admirable figures\r\nof Cramer (_Papillons Exotiques de trois Parties_ _du Monde_), Esper\r\n(_Schmetterlinge_, _Tagschmetterlinge_), Hübner (_Schmetterlinge_,\r\n&c.), and Ochsenheimer's valuable _Schmetterlinge von Europa_, with\r\nthe continuation by Treitschke, will afford a useful avenue. Meigen\r\nalso, author of a most valuable work on the Europæan _Diptera_, is\r\npublishing at this time a work on _Lepidoptera_ under the title\r\nof _Europäische Schmetterlinge_. To the _Hymenoptera_ Jurine and\r\nChristian are the best guides, and to the _Diptera_ Meigen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to works in British Entomology in general--Donovan's\r\n_Natural History of British Insects_, and Samouelle's _Entomologist's\r\nUseful Compendium_, will be found very excellent helps to the\r\nstudent. For the British Genera, the most important work that has\r\nyet appeared is Mr. John Curtis's _British Entomology_, in which\r\nnot only are the insects admirably represented, but their trophi\r\ncorrectly delineated, accompanied by able descriptions. For the\r\n_Coleoptera_ of our country, Mr. Marsham's _Entomologia Britannica_\r\nshould be consulted: for the _Lepidoptera_, the _Butterflies_ of\r\nLewin, Mr. Haworth's useful _Lepidoptera Britannica_, and Miss\r\nJermyn's _Butterfly-Collector's Vade Mecum_; and for the English\r\nspecies of Linné's genus _Apis_, the _Monographia Apum Angliæ_. A\r\nBritish _Fauna Insectorum_, under the title of _Illustrations of\r\nBritish Entomology_, has at length been happily begun by a gentleman\r\n(J. F. Stephens, Esq.) who both by his accurate knowledge of the\r\nsubject, and the extent of his collection of British Insects, is best\r\nqualified to undertake it. As far as it has proceeded, it is ably\r\nexecuted, and possesses this advantage, (an advantage seldom to be\r\nobtained in works published periodically,) that it finishes, as far\r\nas possible, as it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LETTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n                 _GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS;\r\n                       THEIR STATIONS AND HAUNTS;\r\n                 SEASONS; TIMES OF ACTION AND REPOSE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThough no subject is more worthy of the attention of the Entomologist\r\nthan the _Geographical Distribution_ of insects, yet perhaps there\r\nis none connected with the science, for the elucidation of which he\r\nis furnished with fewer materials. The geographer of these animals\r\nsitting by his fireside, even supposing his museum as amply stored as\r\nthat of Mr. MacLeay, and the _habitats_ of its contents as accurately\r\nindicated, still labours under difficulties that are almost\r\ninsuperable; so that it is next to impossible, with our present\r\nknowledge of the subject, to give _satisfactory_ information upon\r\n_every_ point which it includes. Had he the talents and opportunities\r\nof a Humboldt, and could, like him, traverse a large portion of the\r\nglobe, he would endeavour to note the elevation, the soil and aspect,\r\nthe latitude and longitude, the mean temperature and meteorological\r\nphænomena, the season of the year, the kind of country, and other\r\nlocalities connected with the insects he captured, and so might build\r\nhis superstructure upon a sure basis. But these are things seldom\r\nregistered by travellers that take the trouble to collect insects;\r\nwho, if they specify generally the country in which any individual\r\nwas found, think they have done enough. But to say that an insect was\r\ntaken in India, China, New Holland, and North or South America,--when\r\nwe consider the vast extent of those regions,--is saying little of\r\nwhat one wishes to know even with respect to its _habitat_. You must\r\nregard therefore, after all, what I have been able to collect,--and\r\nfor which I am greatly indebted to the labours of my few but able\r\nprecursors in this walk,--as merely approximations to an _outline_,\r\nrather than as a correct _map_ of insect Geography.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous obligations that he conferred upon Natural\r\nHistory, Linné was the first Naturalist who turned his attention to\r\nthe _Geographical Distribution_ of its objects, especially that of\r\nthe _Vegetable_ Kingdom[1458]: and the accomplished traveller Baron\r\nHumboldt, by the observations he made on this subject in the course\r\nof his peregrinations in tropical America, has furnished the Botanist\r\nwith a clue which, duly followed, will enable him to perfect that\r\npart of his science; an end to which the learned observations of\r\nMessrs. R. Brown and Decandolle have greatly contributed[1459]. With\r\nregard to _animals_, Mr. White, so long ago as 1773, had observed\r\nthat they, as well as plants, might with propriety be arranged\r\ngeographically[1460]: and in 1778 Fabricius in his _Philosophia\r\nEntomologica_ applied the principle to _insects_[1461]. Nearly forty\r\nyears elapsed before any improvement or enlargement of this last\r\ndepartment was attempted; when in 1815 M. Latreille, stimulated\r\nby what had been effected in Botany, in a learned and admirable\r\nmemoir[1462] endeavoured to place Entomology in this respect by\r\nthe side of her more fortunate sister: and subsequently Mr. W. S.\r\nMacLeay, in the memorable work so often quoted in our correspondence,\r\nhas viewed the subject in another light, and added some important\r\ninformation to what had been before collected[1463].\r\n\r\nThe point now under consideration naturally divides itself into two\r\nprincipal branches;--the _numerical_ distribution of insects, and the\r\n_topographical_.\r\n\r\nI. By the _numerical_ distribution of insects I mean not only the\r\nnumber which PROVIDENCE has employed to carry on its great plan on\r\nthis terraqueous globe, or any given portion of it; or of the species\r\nof which each group or genus may be supposed to consist; or of the\r\ncomparative number of individuals furnished by each species,--points\r\nof no easy solution: but more particularly their distribution\r\naccording to their _functions_, whether they prey upon _animal_ or\r\n_vegetable_ matter, and in its _living_ or _decaying_ state.\r\n\r\nWe have no data enabling us to ascertain with any degree of accuracy\r\nthe actual _number_ of species of insects and _Arachnida_ distributed\r\nover the surface of the globe; but it is doubtless regulated in a\r\ngreat degree by that of plants. We should first then endeavour to\r\ngain some just though general notion on that head. Now Decandolle\r\nconjectures that the number of the species of plants, 60,000 being\r\nalready known, may be somewhere between 110,000 and 120,000[1464].\r\nIf we consider with reference to this calculation, that though the\r\ngreat body of the mosses, lichens, and sea-weeds are exempt from the\r\nattack of insects, yet as a vast number of phanerogamous plants and\r\nfungi are inhabited by _several_ species, we may form some idea how\r\nimmense must be the number of existing insects; and how beggarly\r\ndoes Ray's conjecture of 20,000 species[1465], which in his time\r\nwas reckoned a magnificent idea, appear in comparison! Perhaps\r\nwe may obtain some approximation by comparing the number of the\r\nspecies of insects already discovered in _Britain_ with that of its\r\n_phanerogamous_ plants. The latter,--and it is not to be expected\r\nthat any large number of species have escaped the researches of\r\nour numerous Botanists,--may be stated in round numbers at 1500,\r\nwhile the British insects, (and _thousands_ it is probable remain\r\nstill undiscovered,) amount to 10,000; which is more than _six_\r\ninsects to _one_ plant. Now though this proportion, it is probable,\r\ndoes not hold universally; yet if it be considered how much more\r\nprolific in species tropical regions are than our chilly climate,\r\nit may perhaps be regarded as not very wide of a fair medium. If\r\nthen we reckon the phanerogamous vegetables of the globe in round\r\nnumbers at 100,000 species, the number of insects would amount to\r\n600,000. If we say 400,000, we shall perhaps not be very wide of the\r\ntruth. When we reflect how much greater attention has been paid to\r\nthe collection of plants than to that of insects, and that 100,000\r\nspecies of the latter may be supposed already to have a place in our\r\ncabinets[1466], we may very reasonably infer that at least _three\r\nfourths_ of the existing species remain undiscovered.\r\n\r\nCertain groups and genera are found to contain many more species\r\nthan others: for instance, the _Coleoptera_ and _Lepidoptera_ Orders\r\nthan the _Orthoptera_ and _Neuroptera_; the _Rhincophora_ than the\r\n_Xylophagi_: the _Dytiscidæ_ than the _Gyrinidæ_; _Aphodius_ than\r\n_Geotrupes_; _Carabus_ than _Calosoma_. Again, some insects are\r\nmuch more prolific than others. Thus the _Diptera_ Order, though\r\nnot half so numerous with respect to _species_ as the _Coleoptera_,\r\nexceeds it greatly in the number of _individuals_, filling the air\r\nin every place and almost at every season with its dancing myriads.\r\nWe rarely meet with a single individual of the most common species\r\nof _Calosoma_ or _Buprestis_; whilst the formicary, the termitary,\r\nthe vespiary, and the bee-hive send forth their thousands and tens\r\nof thousands; and whole countries are covered and devastated by the\r\n_Aphides_ and the Locusts. An all-wise PROVIDENCE has proportioned\r\nthe numbers of each group and species to the work assigned to them.\r\nAnd this is the view in which the numerical distribution of insects\r\nis most interesting and important: and we are indebted to Mr. W. S.\r\nMacLeay for calling the attention of Entomologists more particularly\r\nto this part of our present subject.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their _functions_, insects may be primarily divided\r\ninto those that feed upon _animal_ matter and those that feed upon\r\n_vegetable_. At first you would be inclined to suppose that the\r\n_latter_ must greatly exceed the _former_ in number: but when\r\nyou reflect that not only a very large proportion of Vertebrate\r\nanimals, and even some _Mollusca_[1467], have more than _one_ species\r\nthat preys upon them, but that probably the majority of insects,\r\nparticularly the almost innumerable species of _Lepidoptera_,\r\nare infested by parasites of their own class, sometimes having a\r\ndifferent one appropriated to them in each of their preparatory\r\nstates[1468], and moreover that a large number of beetles and\r\nother insects devour both living and dead animals,--you will begin\r\nto suspect that these two tribes may be more near a counterpoise\r\nthan at first seemed probable. In fact, out of a list of more than\r\n8000 British insects and _Arachnida_ taken several years ago, and\r\nfurnished chiefly by Mr. Stephens, I found that 3894 might be called\r\ncarnivorous, and 3724 phytiphagous[1469]; so that, speaking roundly,\r\nthey might be denominated equiponderant.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous and phytiphagous insects may be further subdivided\r\naccording to the _state_ in which they take their _food_,--whether\r\nthey attack it while _living_, or not till after it is _dead_. To\r\nadopt Mr. W. S. MacLeay's phraseology, the former may be denominated\r\n_thalerophagous_, and the latter _saprophagous_. The British\r\nsaprophagous _carnivorous_ insects, compared with those that are\r\nthalerophagous, are about as 1:6; while the phytiphagous ones are\r\nas 1:9. The _thalerophaga_ in both tribes may be further subdivided\r\nas they take their food by _suction_ or _mastication_: in the\r\n_carnivorous_ ones, the suckers to the masticators in Britain are\r\nnearly as 1:6; but with respect to the _phytiphagous_ tribe you\r\nmust take into consideration that some insects imbibing their food\r\nby _suction_ in their _perfect_ state (as the great body of the\r\n_Lepidoptera_), _masticate_ it when they are _larvæ_: deducting\r\ntherefore from both sides the insects thus circumstanced, the\r\nmasticators will form about _three fourths_ of the remaining British\r\nthalerophagous insects. Another circumstance belonging to this\r\nhead must not be passed without notice:--there are certain insects\r\nfeeding upon liquid food that do not _suck_, but _lap_ it. This is\r\nthe case with the _Hymenoptera_, who, though they are mandibulate,\r\ngenerally lap their food (the nectar of flowers) with their tongue,\r\nand may be called _lambent_ insects: nor is this practice confined\r\nto that order, but all the mandibulate insects that feed on that\r\nsubstance merit the same appellation. The absorption of this nectar\r\nis so important a point in the economy of nature, that a very large\r\nproportion of the insect population of the globe in their perfect\r\nstate, are devoted to it. Considerably more than half the species\r\nindigenous to Britain fulfill this function, and probably in tropical\r\ncountries the proportion may be still larger.\r\n\r\nTo push this analysis still further--Amongst our carnivorous\r\nthalerophaga, _aphidivorous_ insects are about as 1:14; and amongst\r\nthe phytiphagous, the _fungivorous_ ones form about a _twentieth_;\r\nand the _granivorous_ about a _twenty-fifth_ part of the whole.\r\nAgain: in the _saprophaga_ the _lignivorous_ tribes form more than\r\n_half_, and the _coprophagous_ ones more than a _third_.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know further the relative proportions of the different\r\n_Orders_ to each other--The _Coleoptera_ may be stated as forming\r\nat least 1:2 of our intire insect population; the _Orthoptera_ and\r\n_Dermaptera_ as about 1:160; the _Hemiptera_ as 1:15; the _Lepidoptera_\r\nas more than 1:4; the _Neuroptera_ with the _Trichoptera_ as 1:29; the\r\n_Hymenoptera_ as about 1:4; the _Diptera_ as not 1:7; and the _Aptera_\r\nand _Arachnida_ as perhaps amounting to 1:19[1470].\r\n\r\nTo extend this inquiry to _exotic_ and more particularly to\r\n_extra-European_ insects, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nwould lead to no very satisfactory results. The lists we have are\r\nso imperfect, that those which tell most in this country,--I mean\r\nthe more minute insects and the _Brachyptera_--have hitherto formed\r\na very small, if any part, of the collections made _out_ of Europe.\r\nMr. W. S. MacLeay however, who, besides his father's (particularly\r\nrich in _Petalocera_), has had an opportunity of examining the\r\nParisian and other cabinets, finds that the species of _coprophagous_\r\ninsects _within_ the tropics, to those _without_, are nearly in the\r\nproportion of 4:3; and that the coprophagous _Petalocera_, to the\r\nremainder of the saprophagous ones, may be represented by 3:2[1471].\r\nIt may be inferred, from the superabundance of plants and animals\r\nin equinoctial countries, that the number of species of insects in\r\ngeneral is greater within than without the tropics: the additional\r\nmomentum produced by the vast size of many of the tropical species\r\nmust also be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nII. There are three principal points that call for attention under\r\nthe _second_ branch of our present subject--the _topographical_\r\ndistribution of insects; namely, their _Climates_, their _Range_, and\r\ntheir _Representation_.\r\n\r\ni. Entomologists, taking _heat_ for the principal regulator of\r\nthe station of insects, have divided the globe into entomological\r\n_climates_. Fabricius considers it as divisible into _eight_\r\nsuch climates, which he denominates the _Indian_, _Egyptian_,\r\n_Southern_, _Mediterranean_, _Northern_, _Oriental_, _Occidental_,\r\nand _Alpine_. The first containing the tropics; the second, the\r\nnorthern region immediately adjacent; the third, the southern; the\r\nfourth, the countries bordering on the Mediterranean sea, including\r\nalso _Armenia_ and _Media_; the fifth, the northern part of Europe\r\ninterjacent between Lapland and Paris; the sixth, the northern parts\r\nof Asia where the cold in winter is intense; the seventh, North\r\nAmerica, Japan, and China; and the eighth, all those mountains whose\r\nsummits are covered with eternal snow[1472]. M. Latreille objects\r\nto this division, as too vague and arbitrary and not sufficiently\r\ncorrect as to temperature; and observes, with great truth, that as\r\nplaces where the temperature is the same, have different animals,\r\nit is impossible, in the actual state of our knowledge, to fix\r\nthese distinctions of climates upon a solid basis. The different\r\nelevations of the soil above the level of the sea, its mineralogical\r\ncomposition, the varying quantity of its waters, the modifications\r\nwhich the mountains, by their extent, their height, and their\r\ndirection, produce upon its temperature; the forests, larger or\r\nsmaller, with which it may be covered; the effects of neighbouring\r\nclimates upon it,--are all elements that render calculations on this\r\nsubject very complicated, and throw a great degree of uncertainty\r\nover them[1473]. This learned Entomologist would judiciously consider\r\nentomological climates under another view,--that which the genera of\r\n_Arachnida_ and insects _exclusively_ appropriated to determinate\r\nspots or regions would supply[1474]. Linné's _dictum_ with regard\r\nto genera will here also apply; \"Let the insects point out the\r\nclimate, and not the climate the insects.\" If you expect invariably\r\nto find the same insects within the same parallels of latitude, you\r\nwill be sadly disappointed; for, as our author further observes,\r\n\"The totality or a very large number of _Arachnida_ and insects,\r\nthe temperature and soil of whose country are the same, but widely\r\nseparated, is in general, even if the countries are in the same\r\nparallel, composed of different species[1475].\" The natural limits of\r\na country,--as mountainous ranges, rivers, vast deserts, &c.,--often\r\nalso say to its insect population, \"No further shall ye come;\"\r\ninterposing a barrier that it never passes[1476]. Humboldt observes,\r\nwith respect to the _Simulia_ and _Culices_ of South America, that\r\ntheir geographical distribution does not appear to depend solely on\r\nthe _heat_ of the climate, the excess of humidity, or the thickness\r\nof forests; but on local circumstances that are difficult to\r\ncharacterize[1477]: and Mr. W. S. MacLeay makes a similar observation\r\nupon that of _Gymnopleurus_[1478]. So that the real insect climates,\r\nor those in which certain groups or species appear, may be regarded\r\nas fixed by the will of the CREATOR, rather than as certainly\r\nregulated by any _isothermal_ lines. Still, however, under certain\r\nlimitations, it must be admitted that the temperature has much to\r\ndo with the station of insects. The increase of caloric is always\r\nattended with a proportional increase in the number and kind of the\r\ngroups and species of these beings. If we begin within the polar\r\nregions of ice and snow, the list is very meager. As we descend\r\ntowards the line, their numbers keep gradually increasing, till they\r\nabsolutely _swarm_ within the tropics. Something like this takes\r\nplace in miniature upon _mountains_. Tournefort long since observed\r\nat the summit of Mount Ararat the plants of Lapland; a little lower,\r\nthose of Sweden; next, as he descended, those of Germany, France, and\r\nItaly; and at the foot of the mountain, such as were natural to the\r\nsoil of Armenia. And the same has been observed of insects. Those\r\nthat inhabit the _plains_ of _northern_ regions have been found on\r\nthe _mountains_ of more _southern_ ones; as the beautiful and common\r\nSwedish butterfly _Parnassius Apollo_, on the mountains of France,\r\nand _Prionus depsarius_ on those of Switzerland[1479].\r\n\r\nM. Latreille, having given a rapid survey of the peculiar\r\ninsect-productions of different countries, next attempts a division\r\nof the globe into _climates_, which he thinks may be made to agree\r\nwith the present state of our knowledge, and be even applicable to\r\nfuture discoveries. He proposes dividing it primarily into _Arctic_\r\nand _Antarctic_ climates, according as they are situated _above_ or\r\n_below_ the equinoctial line; and taking twelve degrees of latitude\r\nfor each climate, he subdivides the whole into _twelve_ climates.\r\nBeginning at 84° N. L. he has _seven Arctic_ ones, which he names\r\n_polar_, _subpolar_, _superior_, _intermediate_, _supratropical_,\r\n_tropical_, and _equatorial_: but his _antarctic_ climates, as no\r\nland has been discovered below 60° S. L., amount only to _five_,\r\nbeginning with the _equatorial_ and terminating with the _superior_.\r\nHe proposes further to divide his climates into _subclimates_,\r\nby means of certain _meridian lines_; separating thus the _old_\r\nworld from the _new_, and subdividing the _former_ into two great\r\nportions,--an _eastern_, beginning with _India_, and a _western_,\r\nterminating with _Persia_. He proposes further that each climate\r\nshould be considered as having 24° of longitude, as well as 12°\r\nof latitude[1480]. In this chart of insect Geography he states\r\nthat he has endeavoured to make his climates agree with the actual\r\ndistribution of insects[1481]; and it should seem that in many cases\r\nsuch an agreement actually does take place: yet the division of the\r\nglobe into climates by _equivalent_ parallels and meridians, wears\r\nthe appearance of an artificial and arbitrary system, rather than of\r\none according with nature.\r\n\r\nHe has also pointed out another index to insect climates, borrowed from\r\nthe _Flora_ of a country. Southern forms in Entomology, he observes,\r\n_commence_ where the _vine_ begins to prosper by the sole influence of\r\nthe mean temperature; that they are _dominant_ where the _olive_ is\r\ncultivated; that species still _more_ southern are compatriots of the\r\n_orange_ and _palmetto_; and that some _equatorial_ genera accompany\r\nthe _date_, the _sugar-cane_, the _indigo_ and _banana_[1482]. The idea\r\nis very ingenious, and, under certain limitations, supplies a useful\r\nand certain criterion. For though none of these plants are _universal_\r\nin isothermal parallels of latitude; yet, as plants are more\r\nconspicuous than insects, the Entomologist, furnished with an index\r\nof this kind, may by it be directed in his researches for them; and\r\nin all countries in which there is a material change of the climate,\r\nas in France, there will be a proportional change in the _vegetable_\r\naccompanied by one in the _insect_ productions.\r\n\r\nii. In considering the _range_ of insects I shall first advert to\r\nthat of _individual_ species. At the extreme limits of phanerogamous\r\nvegetation we find a species of humble-bee (_Bombus arcticus_),\r\nwhich, though it is not known to leave the Arctic circle, has a very\r\nextensive range to the _westward_ of the meridian of Greenwich,\r\nhaving been traced from Greenland to Melville Island; while to the\r\n_eastward_ of that meridian it has not been met with. In Lapland\r\nits place appears to be occupied by _B. alpinus_ and _lapponicus_,\r\nwith the former of which, though quite distinct, it was confounded\r\nby O. Fabricius; but whether these range further _eastward_ of\r\nthat meridian has not been ascertained. From its being found in\r\nthe Lapland _Alps_[1483], it may be conjectured that _B. alpinus_\r\nranges as high on this side as _B. arcticus_ on the other, and may\r\nperhaps be found in _Nova Zembla_. Some species that have been\r\ntaken in Arctic regions are not confined to them. Of this kind is\r\n_Dytiscus marginalis_, which appears common in Greenland, abundant\r\nin Britain, and is dispersed over all Europe; while _D. latissimus_\r\nis more confined, neither ranging so far to the north or south;\r\nand though found in Germany, not yet discovered in Britain. Other\r\nspecies have a still more extensive range, and are common to the old\r\nworld and the new. Thus _Dermestes murinus_, _Brachinus crepitans_,\r\n_Tetyra scarabæoides_[1484], _Pentatoma juniperina_, _Cercopis\r\nspumaria_, _Vanessa Antiopa_, _Polyommatus Argiolus_, _Hesperia\r\nComma_, _Vespa vulgaris_, _Ophion luteus_, _Helophilus pendulus_,\r\n_Oscinis Germinationis_, and many besides, though sometimes varying\r\nslightly[1485], inhabit both Britain and Canada: and though vast\r\ncontinents and oceans intervene between us, New Holland, and Japan;\r\nyet all have some insect productions in common. With the former we\r\npossess the painted-lady butterfly (_Cinthia Cardui_), with scarcely\r\na varying streak: and Thunberg, in his list of Japan insects, has\r\nmentioned more than _forty_ species that are found also in this\r\ncountry. Whether any species has a _universal_ range may be doubted,\r\nunless indeed the flea and the louse may be excepted. On the other\r\nhand, some are confined within very narrow limits. _Apion Ulicis_\r\nfor instance, abundant upon _Ulex europæus_ in Britain, has not, I\r\nbelieve, been found upon that plant on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of _groups_, is, however, far more\r\ninteresting than that of _individual species_: for in considering this\r\nwe see more evidently how certain _functions_ are devolved upon certain\r\n_forms_, and can scan the great plan of PROVIDENCE, in the creation of\r\ninsects, more satisfactorily than by confining our attention to the\r\nlatter. Groups, according to their range, may be denominated either\r\n_predominant_, _dominant_, _sub-dominant_, or _quiescent_.\r\n\r\n1. M. Latreille has observed, that where the empire of _Flora_\r\nceases, there also terminates that of Zoology[1486]. _Phytiphagous_\r\nanimals can only exist where there are _plants_; and those that are\r\n_carnivorous_ and feed upon the _former_, must of necessity stop\r\nwhere they stop. Even the _gnat_, which extends its northern reign so\r\nhigh[1487], must cease at this limit; while, where vegetation is the\r\nrichest and most abundant, there the animal productions, especially\r\nthe insect, must be equally abundant. I call that, therefore, a\r\n_predominant_ group, members of which are found in all the countries\r\nbetween these points, or from the limits of animal-depasturing\r\nvegetation in the polar regions to the line.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the _carnivorous_ insects, whether thalerophagous\r\nor saprophagous, are of this description. _Calosoma_, which devours\r\nLepidopterous larvæ, though poor in species and individuals, is\r\nwidely scattered. Captain Frankland found _C. calidum_ in his Arctic\r\njourney; _C. laterale_ and _curvipes_ inhabit tropical America[1488]:\r\n_C. Chinense_, as its name indicates, is Chinese[1489]; Mr. MacLeay\r\nhas an undescribed species from New Holland; and _C. retusum_ was\r\ntaken in Terra del Fuego. Another genus, equally universal and richer\r\nin numbers, is the lady-bird (_Coccinella_), which keeps within\r\ndue limits the _Aphides_ of every climate from pole to pole. The\r\n_Libellulina_ pursue their prey both in Greenland and New Holland.\r\nThe _saprophagous_ carnivora are also similarly predominant;--the\r\n_Silphidæ_, the _Dermestidæ_, the _Brachyptera_, the _Muscidæ_,\r\nprey on carcases wherever the action of the solar beam causes them\r\nto become putrid. Many of the above insects have probably their\r\n_capital_ station, or that where the species are most numerous, in\r\nor near the tropics; but the metropolis of the _Brachyptera_, at\r\nleast as far as we can judge from our present catalogues, is within\r\nthe temperate zone, particularly in Britain[1490]. The coprophagous\r\n_Petalocera_ are most abundant in the hottest climates; but the\r\n_Aphodiadæ_ form a predominant group: Professor Hooker took one\r\nspecies in Iceland[1491], and it probably ascends higher; others\r\nare found in India and China: but the metropolis of the group is\r\nwithin the temperate zone. Perhaps no genus is more completely\r\nuniversal than _Bombus_ (_Bremus_ Jur.), which, although its centre\r\nor _metropolis_ is likewise in the northern temperate zone, extends\r\nfrom Melville Island to the line. It is remarkable that some of\r\nthe tropical _Bombi_ wear the external aspect of _Xylocopæ_, the\r\nkindred genus most prevalent in warm climates; and, _vice versâ_,\r\nsome _Xylocopæ_ resemble _Bombi_. I have a Brazilian undescribed\r\nspecies of the latter genus, whose black body and violet-coloured\r\nwings would almost cause it to be mistaken for a variety of _X.\r\nviolacea_; and _B. antiguensis_ and _caffrus_ F., (though their\r\naspect belies it,) which misled Fabricius, are true _Xylocopæ_. I\r\nshall mention only one other predominant group, but that one of no\r\ncommon celebrity, formed of the gnats, or genus _Culex_. These piping\r\npests, with their quiver--\"venenatis gravida sagittis\"--annoy man\r\nalmost from the pole to the line. What remarkably distinguishes them,\r\n(as was formerly observed[1492],) and also the _Simulium_ or true\r\nmosquito,--they appear to prevail most in the coldest and the hottest\r\nclimates, and the Laplander and the tropical American are equally\r\ntheir prey; while the inhabitants of the temperate zone, with some\r\nexceptions, suffer but little from them: so that they may be stated\r\nto have both an _arctic_ and a _tropical_ metropolis.\r\n\r\n2. There are other groups which, though their empire extends to the\r\ntropics, fall short of the polar circles:--these I call _dominant_\r\ngroups. Of this description are some of the _Scarabæidæ_. _Onthophagus_\r\nis found both in the old world and in the new, and in the temperate\r\nand torrid zones. Its principal seat appears to be within the tropics,\r\nbut it may almost be said to have also a northern metropolis. More\r\nthan one species have been taken in New Holland. In general, tropical\r\ninsects exceed those of colder climates in _size_; but in the genus we\r\nare speaking of, the _European_ species are usually larger than the\r\n_Indian_. _Copris_ seems more abhorrent of cold than its near relation\r\n_Onthophagus_. _C. lunaris_, which ranges northward as far as Sweden,\r\nis the only recorded species found in Europe out of Spain. Latreille\r\nsays, that all the large species of this genus are equinoctial: but _C.\r\nTmolus_, described and figured by Fischer[1493], found in Asia near\r\nOrenburg, north of 50° N. L., is as big as _C. Gigas_ or _bucephalus_.\r\nAnother dominant group of _Petalocera_, remarkable for the bulk and\r\narms of its tropical species, are the mighty _Dynastidæ_, the giants\r\nand princes of the insect race. Though their metropolis is strictly\r\ntropical, yet the scouts of their host have wandered even as far as\r\nthe south of Sweden, where one of them, _Oryctes nasicornis_, is\r\nextremely common. _O. Grypus_[1494] and some other species are found\r\nin South Europe; but though in a torpid state they can endure unhurt\r\nthe severity of a Scandinavian winter, they cannot when revived\r\nstand the cold that often pinches Britons in the midst of summer,\r\nand therefore are unknown in our islands[1495]. The _Sphæridiadæ_,\r\nwhose metropolis is within the northern temperate zone, extend from\r\nthence beyond the line, since Dr. Horsfield found two species in\r\nJava[1496]. It is probable, indeed, that this group is predominant.\r\nSome dominant groups begin at a lower latitude. Of this description\r\nare the carpenter-bees (_Xylocopa_), whose larvæ are preyed upon by\r\nthat of the _Horiadæ_[1497] under _two_ forms, which extend from the\r\ntropics to about 50° N. L. Others are not common to both worlds. Thus,\r\nwhile _Cantharis_ is the gift of PROVIDENCE to America as well as the\r\nold world, _Mylabris_ is confined to the _latter_, where its range\r\nis very extensive;--in Europe, from South Russia to Italy and Spain;\r\nin Asia, from Siberia to India; and in Africa, from the shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope; which last continent, to\r\njudge from our present lists, especially the vicinity of the Cape,\r\nmay be called the metropolis of the group[1498]. On the other hand,\r\nthe _Rutelidæ_ and _Chlamys_, which have a range from Canada to the\r\ntropics, (within which is their metropolis,) are purely _American_\r\ngroups. Many more might be named under this head, but these will\r\nsuffice for examples.\r\n\r\n3. I call those _subdominant_ groups, which either never enter the\r\ntropics, or those tropical ones whose range does not exceed 50° of\r\nN. L. in the old world, or 43° in the new. I make this difference\r\nbecause, as M. Latreille observes, the southern insects which in\r\nEurope begin between 48° and 49° N. L., in America do not reach\r\n43°.[1499] But though the winters in Canada, within the same parallel\r\nas France, are longer and more severe than those even of Great\r\nBritain or of Germany, yet the summers are intensely hot; so that\r\nthough tropical _species_ do not range so high, those of a tropical\r\n_structure_, as Mr. W. S. MacLeay has intimated[1500], may be found\r\nat a higher latitude in the new world than in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Melöe_ affords an instance of a subdominant group of the\r\nfirst description. It ranges from Sweden to Spain and the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, and seems a tribe almost confined to Europe,\r\nwhere it is not very unequally distributed. Of registered species\r\nBritain possesses the largest proportion; but Mr. W. S. MacLeay is of\r\nopinion that Spain is its true metropolis[1501]. I have a species of\r\nthis genus, taken in North America by Professor Peck. The splendid\r\ngenus _Carabus_ ranges still further north than _Melöe_[1502]. A\r\nvery fine species (_C. cribellatus_) inhabits the polar regions of\r\nSiberia[1503]; but the metropolis of the group appears to be the\r\ntemperate zone: some, however, have been found in northern Africa;\r\nand Sir Joseph Banks captured one in Terra del Fuego. Of those\r\nwhose range is between the tropics and 50° N. L. we may begin with\r\n_Cicada_. One species, indeed, has been found by Mr. Bydder and\r\nothers, a little higher, near the New Forest, Hampshire. We may\r\ntake _Scolia_ for an example of a subdominant group beginning more\r\nsouthward. Its species first appear about 43° N. L., and abound in\r\nwarm climates. In general most of those insects which M. Latreille\r\ndenominates _meridional_,--such as _Scarabæus_, _Onitis_, _Brentus_,\r\n_Scarites_, _Mantis_, _Fulgora_, _Termes_, _Scorpio_, &c.--come under\r\nthe present head, and in fact all tropical forms that wander to any\r\ndistance within the above limits from their metropolis.\r\n\r\n4. By _quiescent_ groups I mean those that have none, or no _high_\r\nrange as to latitude, from their centre or metropolis. I say as\r\nto _latitude_, because these groups have often an extensive one as\r\nto _longitude_. Thus, Mr. W. S. MacLeay has remarked to me, that\r\n_Goliathus_ appears to belt the globe, but not under _one_ form. The\r\ntypes of the genus are the vast African Goliaths (_G. giganteus_,\r\n&c.), which, as well as _G. Polyphemus_, and another brought from\r\nJava by Dr. Horsfield, have, like _Cetonia_[1504], the scapulars\r\ninterposed between the posterior angles of the prothorax and the\r\nshoulders of the elytra[1505]: while the South American species\r\n(_G. micans_, &c.) have not this projection of the scapulars; in\r\nthis resembling _Trichius_. Mr. MacLeay further observes, that the\r\nfemale of the Javanese _Goliathus_ is exactly a _Cetonia_, while\r\nthat of the Brazilian is a _Trichius_. But quiescent groups have\r\nnot generally this ample longitudinal range. Thus, _Euglossa_, in\r\nboth its types,--one represented by _Eu. cordata_, and the other by\r\n_Eu. surinamensis_,--is confined to the tropical regions of America.\r\n_Doryphora_, likewise American, seems equally confined. _Asida_,\r\nthough a _southern_ genus, is not found to enter the _tropics_; and\r\n_Manticora_ and _Pneumora_ are in nearly the same predicament.\r\n\r\nUnder the present head we may consider what may perhaps be denominated\r\nwithout much impropriety _endemial_ groups; by which I mean those\r\ngroups that are regulated, as to their limits, not so much by the\r\ntemperature, or the northing and southing of the latitude, as by\r\nthe general aspect and circumstances of the country. Thus, the vast\r\nand nearly insular continent of _Africa_, almost as wide as it is\r\nlong, and situated in or near the tropics, instead of inland seas or\r\nsea-like rivers, is intersected by parched sandy deserts, extending\r\nfar and wide; circumstances which, though in the vicinity of its\r\nstreams it is humid, impart an unusual degree of _aridity_ as well\r\nas heat to its general atmosphere; so that it well merits the poet's\r\nepithet, _Leonum arida nutrix_; and is also peculiarly fitted for\r\nall such animals, especially insects, as delight in a dry, sandy,\r\nhot country, particularly such as are predaceous in their habits.\r\n_America_, on the other hand, exhibits quite an opposite character.\r\nIt is long, and comparatively narrow; surrounded, and almost divided\r\ninto two continents, by immense circumfluent oceans; watered every\r\nwhere by rivers and lakes that emulate seas: in some parts covered by\r\ninterminable forests; in others, intersected by ridges of the loftiest\r\nmountains. These circumstances, except in its Llanos, Pampas, or\r\ntable-land, give a general character of humidity to its atmosphere,\r\nand fit it particularly for the production of a vast variety of\r\npeculiar plants, and for the residence of numerous and peculiar\r\nphytiphagous insects and other animals[1506]. Midway between these two\r\ncontinents lies a third (for so the vast island of New Holland may be\r\ndenominated), which presents new features in its general aspect, and\r\nconsequently new forms both in its _Flora_ and _Fauna_, mixed with many\r\nold ones parallel to those both of the new world and the old. Perhaps\r\nEurope and Asia, with several that are peculiar, agree more in their\r\nanimal productions than the continents just described.\r\n\r\nLet us next particularize a few of the peculiar types that\r\ndistinguish particular continents and countries. The genera\r\n_Manticora_, _Graphipterus_, _Glaphyrus_, _Eurychora_, _Pneumora_,\r\n_Masaris_, and many others, are peculiar to Africa. In Asia\r\nalone we find _Mimela_[1507], _Euchlora_[1508], _Colliuris_,\r\n_Catascopus_[1509], _Apogonia_[1510], a peculiar type of _Horia_,\r\n&c. In America, _Agra_, _Galerita_, _Nilio_, another type of\r\n_Horia_, _Tetraonyx_, _Rutela_, _Doryphora_, _Alurnus_, _Erotylus_,\r\n_Scotinus_[1511], _Cupes_, _Corydalis_, _Labidus_, _Heliconius_,\r\n_Castnia_, &c. And in New Holland, _Helluo_, _Elephastomus_,\r\n_Anoplognathus_, _Diphucephala_[1512], _Cerapterus_, _Heleus_,\r\n_Adelium_, _Notoclea_, _Achilus_, _Thynnus_, _Nycterobius_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe countries bordering upon the Mediterranean, the Black, and the\r\nCaspian seas, agree in producing similar insects. These countries, and\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope though so distant from them, appear to be the\r\nprincipal seat of Heteromerous _Coleoptera_, of the genera _Lixus_ and\r\n_Brachycerus_, and of the conical _Buprestes_[1513]. But the insects of\r\nGuiana, on one side the Cordilleras, differ from those of New Granada\r\nand Peru on the other; and similar differences are observed in other\r\n_neighbouring_ countries separated by natural boundaries.\r\n\r\niii. Another head connected with the topographical distribution of\r\ninsects relates to their _representation_ of each other. Here we\r\nmay observe, that some insects represent each other only in their\r\n_form_; others also in their _function_; and others in _both_. I\r\nshall give some instances of each. In Brazil there is a group of\r\npetalocerous beetles (_Chasmodia_), one of the _Rutelidæ_, which\r\nin New Holland has a representative, as to _form_, in one of the\r\n_Cetoniadæ_ (_Schizorhina_[1514]), which, having soft mandibles, must\r\nhave a different function:--it is to be observed, however, that these\r\ninsects appear to approach each other in the series of affinities.\r\nAgain, the _Carabidæ_ may in the same country be said to have a\r\nrepresentative in the remarkable heteromerous genus _Adelium_[1515],\r\nwhich is altogether an analogy. Others are representative only in\r\ntheir _function_. The general function of insects is to remove\r\n_nuisances_ and to check _redundances_,--the saprophagous tribes do\r\nthe one, and the thalerophagous the other. In going from the poles\r\nto the line,--in proportion as the heat increases, the quantum of\r\nwork of both kinds increases; and new forms are either added to\r\nthe old ones, so as to increase their momentum; or new ones, more\r\npowerfully talented, replace the old ones, and act in their stead:\r\nthus we see a gradual and interesting change take place in proportion\r\nas we approach the maximum of heat and of insect population. At the\r\nCape, the _universal Cicindelæ_ are aided by _Manticora_; in North\r\nAmerica, the _Silphidæ_ by a new group, the type of which is _Silpha\r\nAmericana_ (_Necrophila_, K.MS.); in South America, _Copris_ by\r\n_Phanæus_. Again: _Colliuris_ and _Drypta_ of the _old_ world, in\r\nthe _new_ give place to _Ctenostoma_ and _Agra_. The honey and wax\r\nof Europe, Asia, and Africa, is prepared by _bees_ congenerous with\r\nour common hive-bee (_Apis_); while in America this genus is not\r\nfound as a native, but is replaced by _Melipona_ and _Trigona_[1516];\r\nand in New Holland by a still different but undescribed type. The\r\n_Melolonthidæ_ and _Rutelidæ_ of the old and new world appear to\r\nhave their work done in that country by the brilliant and numerous\r\n_Anoplognathidæ_. The _Rhipicera_ of Brazil is of a different type\r\nfrom that of New Holland. The singular genus _Cremastocheilus_ of\r\nNorth America has its representative in Africa in _Genuchus_[1517].\r\nThe _Lucani_ of the rest of the world give place in New Holland to\r\n_Lamprima_ and _Ryssonotus_.--I could produce a much greater number\r\nof examples, but these are sufficient to explain my meaning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus given you some, though an imperfect account, of the\r\n_geographical_ distribution of insects, I am next to say something\r\nconcerning their _local_ distribution in any district, or their\r\nfavourite _haunts_; a knowledge of which, with respect to those of\r\nour own country, is indispensable to the collector.\r\n\r\nThe surface of a country consists either of mountains, hills and\r\nvalleys, or of plains. It is diversified by forest, wood, or copse;\r\nand watered by rivers, rivulets, lakes, and pools. Those parts that\r\nare not clothed with wood are either open or inclosed, forming\r\ngrassy downs, heaths, pastures, meadows, morasses, and arable land.\r\nThe soil also is equally various:--we find clay, loam, marl, chalk,\r\nvegetable mould, moor, sand, &c. The mountains and hills are either\r\ncovered with a stratum of soil, or are rocky and bare; the arable\r\nlands are divided by living or dead fences, the latter formed of\r\nvarious materials,--or else they are open, and the property only\r\nmarked out by grassy balks, &c. All these places abound in shrubs and\r\nplants; some local, and some generally distributed. But besides the\r\n_land_ and its _fresh_ waters, we must look also to the _sea_, and\r\nits sandy, pebbly, or rocky shores, and the sea-wrack that is cast\r\nup upon them; the _estuaries_ that receive its tides; the brackish\r\nwaters and saline marshes in its vicinity. All the above places, when\r\nopportunity serves, the Entomologist should explore, for in almost\r\nall he will find peculiar kinds of insects.\r\n\r\nAs _mountains_ and _hills_ have usually their own Flora, the insects\r\nappropriated to alpine plants can only be met with where the pabulum\r\nis found. Here also those northern insects that are impatient of\r\na warmer climate will take their station, if they migrate to the\r\nsouthward[1518]. The predaceous beetles likewise sometimes frequent\r\na mountainous district. _Carabus glabratus_ was first taken by\r\nProfessor Hooker on Ingleborough; and probably, if the Welsh and\r\nScotch mountains were duly investigated by an Entomologist, many\r\nnovelties would reward his toils. The _valleys_ and _plains_,\r\nespecially those of a sunny exposition, abound in insects. When the\r\nheat of the atmosphere indisposes you for motion, you will find it no\r\nunprofitable or unpleasant employment, lying on the grass, to search\r\nfor minute beetles, which you will there find coursing about amongst\r\nthe tufts and roots of the herbage. Thus you may procure many of the\r\n_Pselaphidæ_, which you would not otherwise meet with. Even when the\r\ngrass is grown up, insects are fond of alighting upon its spikes, and\r\nthence drop or run to the ground. Should circumstances ever carry you\r\nabroad to the steppes or grassy plains of Tartary, or to Hungary,\r\nyou would find there two or three species of the singular genus\r\n_Lethrus_, which burrows in the soil. Every hole is inhabited by a\r\nmale and female;--from it they issue to attack the plants or vines;\r\nand having cut out the heart of a plant, go backwards like a crab\r\nwith the prize to their burrow. At the time of pairing, sometimes\r\nviolent battles, encouraged by the female, take place between the\r\nmale and a stranger of that sex desirous of admission, which cease\r\nonly with the death or flight of the stranger[1519]. The vicinity and\r\nborders of _woods_ generally abound in insects of every Order; and if\r\nyou proceed, as hereafter directed, will furnish you with numerous\r\nprizes, especially of _Lepidoptera_. Here alone you can meet with the\r\npurple emperor butterfly (_Apatura Iris_); and if properly equipped\r\nyou may readily secure him.\r\n\r\nThe _waters_ you will find nearly as prolific in insects as the\r\nland. In them, amongst the beetles, you may expect to meet with\r\n_Dytiscus_, _Haliplus_, _Pælobius_, _Hyphydrus_, _Hydroporus_,\r\n_Noterus_, _Colymbetes_, and other _Dytiscidæ_; the _Gyrini_,\r\n_Hydrophili_, _Hydrænæ_, _Elophori_, &c.: under stones, the _Elmis_;\r\nand in the mud, the _Parni_ and _Heteroceri_. Some _Sphæridiadæ_ are\r\nalso aquatic: I have taken more than once _Cercyon hæmorrhoidale_\r\nfrom the under side of a piece of wood immersed in a canal[1520].\r\nEven a few of the weevil tribes are to be met with in water.\r\n_Lixus paraplecticus_, _Tanysphyrus Lemnæ_, _Bagous atrirostris_,\r\nare of this description. A species of _Ceutorhynchus_ of Germar's\r\n_third_ family (_C. Natator_ K.) _swims_ well. On aquatic plants\r\nyou must look for _Helodes_ and the splendid _Donaciæ_, which,\r\nliving on submerged shoots and roots of these plants in their\r\nlarva state, continue to attend them when perfect. Amongst the\r\n_Eutrech_in_a_[1521],--_Elaphrus_, _Notiophilus_, and _Bembidium_\r\nfrequent humid places, as the banks of rivers and ponds; and in such\r\na station, under the roots of _Potentilla anserina_, _Polygonum_,\r\n&c. if you should be fortunate enough to find _Omophron limbatum_,\r\nwhich connects the _Eutrech_in_a_ with the _Eunech_in_a_, you will\r\nmake a valuable addition to the list of British insects. In the\r\nwaters also you will meet with many Heteropterous _Hemiptera_; as\r\n_Gerris_, _Hydrometra_, and _Velia_, and all the _Hydrocorisæ_ or\r\nwater-bugs. On aquatic plants the larvæ of some _Lepidoptera_ feed,\r\nas _Hydrocampa stratiotata_, _potamogata_, &c. Those also of the\r\n_Trichoptera_ must be sought for in the water: and if you should\r\nfeel inclined to see an interesting collection of their very curious\r\n_cases_, Mr. Sheppard of Wrabness can gratify your curiosity. Though\r\nfew or no _Hymenoptera_ frequent this element, vast numbers of\r\n_Diptera_ are there alone to be met with in their preparatory state,\r\nparticularly the gnats. We learn from Humboldt a curious fact with\r\nrespect to those of South America, or the _Zancudos_; that, with\r\nsome exceptions, these pests do not frequent those rivers called by\r\nthe natives _black waters_, but only those which they name _white\r\nwaters_[1522]. Of the _Aptera_, the genera _Hydrachna_, _Eylaïs_ and\r\n_Limnochares_ are purely aquatic. Several spiders will walk over the\r\nwater; and one species (_Argyroneta aquatica_) inhabits it[1523]. The\r\n_stagnant_ waters in your vicinity will produce different species\r\nfrom _running_ ones. Thus _Haliplus elevatus_, &c. inhabits only\r\nthe _latter_, while the majority of the _Dytiscidæ_ abound most in\r\nthe _former_: the more minute ones may be sought for with success\r\namongst the duckweed that covers a pool. I do not recollect finding\r\nany insect in waters absolutely _salt_[1524]; but _brackish_ waters\r\nproduce peculiar species: in these only, _Hydræna marina_ occurs; and\r\nmany of those large-eyed _Cimicidæ_ (_Acanthia_), as _A. saltatoria_,\r\n_littoralis_, and _Zosteræ_ occur in places where salt water has\r\nbeen. Latreille observes, that the genus _Pimelia_ is to be met with\r\nonly where the soil is impregnated with saline particles, or where\r\nthe species of the genus _Salsola_ abound[1525].\r\n\r\n_Heaths_, though they do not afford numerous insects, have their\r\nrarities. _Cicindela sylvatica_, _Carabus nitens_ and _arvensis_,\r\nfrequent them, and are not elsewhere to be seen. _Curculio nebulosus_\r\nis also to be found on them, in places where the turf has been peeled;\r\nand some scarce _Lepidoptera_. In their vicinity, in sunny sandy\r\nbanks, some of the rarer _Ammophilæ_ and _Pompili_ may be taken;\r\nand it is here only that I have ever met with _Panurgus_[1526].\r\n_Meadows_ and _pastures_ are not to be neglected. Early in the year,\r\nwhen they are yellow with the blossoms of _Ranunculus bulbosus_,\r\n_Leontodon Taraxacum_, &c., many minute beetles, and not a few\r\n_Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, frequent them. _Morasses_ also have\r\ntheir peculiar insects. In these you will meet with some of the\r\nscarcer _Eutrech_in_a_; as _Chlænia holosericea_ and _nigricornis_,\r\n_Blethisa multipunctata_, various _Bembidia_, &c. In this kind of\r\ndistrict in the Isle of Ely _Aphodius plagiatus_ has been taken, and\r\nthat scarce and beautiful butterfly _Lycæna Virgaureæ_. Where land\r\nis _cultivated_ the Entomologist as well as the farmer may expect a\r\n_harvest_. Insects in general are fond of perching on the summit of\r\na blade of grass or corn; and many minute ones may be taken coursing\r\nabout in the ears of the latter: some to devour the _fungilli_ that\r\ninfest the grain, as _Phalacrus corruscus_ in _Reticularia Segetum_;\r\nothers to attack the grain itself, as _Cecidomyia Tritici_; others to\r\ndestroy these destroyers, as three little parasites belonging to the\r\n_Chalcidites_[1527]. But I have already mentioned most of those insects\r\nthat are to be expected in such situations[1528]: I shall therefore\r\nonly further observe, that upon _barley_ particularly you will meet\r\nwith the species of Latreille's genus _Cephus_.\r\n\r\nWith respect to _soils_, those that are _light_ appear to be most\r\nprolific in insects. Warm _sandy_ banks are frequented by _Cicindela\r\ncampestris_, _Opatrum sabulosum_, _Helops quisquilius_, &c.: in them\r\n(when of a southern aspect) _Ammophilæ_, _Pompili_, and numerous\r\n_Hymenoptera_ nidificate. _Chalk_ also attracts various insects.\r\nLatreille observes, that the _Licini_, _Papilio Cleopatra_, several\r\nspecies of _Dasytes_, and some _Lamiæ_, delight in this kind of\r\nsoil[1529]:--in my own neighbourhood I have observed _Polyommatus\r\nCorydon_ principally in chalk-pits. One of these pits, under a wood\r\nin an adjoining parish, has produced me several valuable insects.\r\nHere I took _Apion ebeninum_, _Orobitis globosus_, a new species of\r\n_Evæsthetus_, several of the rarer _Pselaphidæ_ and _Cholevæ_, and\r\n_Chætophorus cretifer_ before noticed[1530]. I do not mean, however,\r\nthat all these are properly _chalk_ insects; but they fall into these\r\npits, where they are readily discerned, from the contrast of their\r\ncolours with the whiteness of the chalk. By watching attentively the\r\nbottom of one, vast numbers in a warm day may be taken when they\r\nfall or are climbing upwards. Of all soils _clay_ offers the fewest\r\ninducements to the Entomologist, who will lose both his time and labour\r\nin a clay-pit; while in one of sand, chalk, or marl, they will usually\r\nnot be mispent. _Vegetable earth_ also affords a harbour to various\r\nlarvæ, and the pupæ of many nightfliers amongst the _Lepidoptera_,\r\nby digging in it, especially under trees, may be obtained. Even the\r\nbare _rocks_ have their insect frequenters that take shelter in\r\ntheir fissures; and in the early part of your career especially you\r\nshould always turn over large stones, as beneath them many of the\r\n_Harpalidæ_ and other _Eutrech_in_a_ frequently lie hid: and in this\r\nsituation, both in Suffolk and Sussex, _Lomechusa emarginata_, one\r\nof our scarcest _Brachyptera_, has been taken. Old trees also, and\r\nplanks that have laid long without being moved, often afford a shelter\r\nto many of the minute _Coleoptera_; as _Pselaphidæ_, _Aleocharidæ_,\r\n_Cryptophagidæ_, _Scymnidæ_, &c. _Live_ fences, especially when\r\nthe hawthorn is in blossom, and where trees are also intermixed,\r\nare attended by innumerable insects of almost every description;\r\nand even the black-thorn will present you with one of our most\r\nsplendid weevils (_Rhynchites Bacchus_). _Dead_ fences are almost as\r\nfertile in insects as living ones. In _gates_, _posts_, _rails_, and\r\nother _timber_ when felled, the timber-devouring tribes take their\r\nstation:--between the bark and the wood are the _Bostrichidæ_; in\r\nthe wood itself, the _Anobidæ_ and the Capricorn beetles. Here also\r\nyou may meet with many _Hymenoptera_, which either devour timber or\r\nnidificate in it,--as the _Siricidæ_, _Chelostoma_, _Trypoxylon_,\r\n_Sapyga_, and several _Diptera_. In the decaying hedgestakes and\r\nsticks, where the _Sphæria decorticans_ has turned off the bark, you\r\nmay meet with _Anthribus brevirostris_; with _A. latirostris_, and\r\nother beetles, in _S. fraxinea_; and _A. albinus_, which I have more\r\nthan once captured as it was emerging from the fissure of a gate-post,\r\nprobably feeds on some internal fungus. The grassy _balks_ that\r\nseparate open fields usually abound in umbelliferous plants, which are\r\nattended by numerous _Hymenoptera_ and _Diptera_, particularly by the\r\nvarious species of the splendid tribe of _Chrysidæ_: and the grassy\r\nbanks of fences, where the aspect is sunny, are generally bored by a\r\nvariety of insects of the former Order, to prepare a nest for their\r\nyoung. _Andrenidæ_ and _Nomadidæ_ particularly select this situation,\r\nthe latter probably depositing their eggs in the burrows of the\r\nformer[1531]. By watching these places in the spring, you may perhaps\r\nhave the good fortune to meet with a _Stylops_. It is singular, that\r\nsome insects choose, for their own residence or that of their young,\r\nthe hardest and most trodden pathways. Thus, some ants will build their\r\nsubterranean apartments under gravel walks; and so do many species of\r\nthe genus _Halictus_[1532], the habits and economy of which have been\r\nso ably detailed by M. Walckenaër[1533]: _Cerceris_ also, and other\r\n_Hymenoptera_, will choose such places, however public, for the site of\r\ntheir nests or burrows. The ground is so consolidated by the constant\r\nfoot, that they, probably find such situations spare them a world of\r\nlabour, and therefore in their choice balance one inconvenience by\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThough the _sea_ itself, I believe, produces no true _insects_, yet\r\nthere are many that constantly or occasionally haunt its shores. On\r\nthe sand-hills of the Norfolk coast I found _Ægialia globosa_ and\r\n_Cicindela hybrida_. _Ceutorhynchus horridus_ inhabits thistles that\r\ngrow near the sea. Under the _Zostera_ and _Fuci_, (cast up both on\r\nits beach and the shores of estuaries,) many peculiar species of\r\n_Cercyon_, several _Aphodii_, and numerous _Brachyptera_, may often\r\nbe found. In this situation the rare and singular _Bledius armatus_\r\nhas been taken. At certain seasons of the year the beach and environs\r\nof the sea are covered by many species of _Coccinella_, which seem\r\nto bend their course thither from the inland country, as if they\r\nwere about to emigrate[1534]. When the weather is fine and the tide\r\nbegins to retire, at the line of its highest rise I have taken on the\r\neastern coast a variety of insects, and amongst the rest _Anomala\r\nFrischii_. The inundations of rivers, except in the depth of winter,\r\nalways bring a number of these little creatures, which float on the\r\nsurface on bits of stick, weeds, &c.; and where they deposit these\r\narticles when the water begins to subside, you may generally reap a\r\nplentiful harvest of various kinds.\r\n\r\nYou see, now, how varied is the scenery to which the diversion of\r\nthe Entomologist introduces him; that he is never out of his way:\r\nwhether on hill or in valley; on upland or plain; on the heath or in\r\nthe forest; on the land or on the water; in the heart of a country\r\nor on its shores;--still his game is within his reach. But in order\r\nto enable him to pursue it with greater prospect of success, he\r\nmust recollect that not only is every face of the country to be\r\nexplored, but both the _plants_ and the _animals_ that it produces;\r\nand that he must not turn with disgust from even the _carcase_ or\r\nthe _excrement_ of the latter. As numerous species of herbivorous\r\ninsects feed only on _one_ kind of plant, the Entomologist, when he\r\ndiscovers a scarce one, should examine it with the hope of finding\r\nupon it a scarce insect. Sometimes it happens that only a single\r\nopportunity occurs in a man's life of seeing certain plants growing\r\nwild: such opportunities should never be neglected. Some insects also\r\ninhabit a plant in one district or season, and not in another. Thus\r\nthe most beautiful of the Apions, _A. Limonii_[1535], though the\r\nplant it feeds upon usually abounds near the sea, I have discovered\r\nonly on the northern coast of Norfolk; and another scarcely less\r\nbeautiful, but more minute (_A. Astragali_[1536]), though I have\r\nsought for it year after year, _Astragalus glyciphyllus_ being\r\nabundant near me, I never found but once. The blossoms of plants\r\nas well as the leaves must be inspected. In those of the rose,\r\nthe _Cetonia aurata_ is often taken[1537]; and in the bells of\r\nthe different species of _Campanula_ various bees may be captured\r\nenjoying a luxurious repose[1538]. No vegetable productions abound\r\nmore in insect inhabitants than the _Fungi_. In Agarics several\r\n_Diptera_ are to be taken, many _Aleocharæ_, _Oxypori_, &c.; in\r\nBoleti, the various species of _Mycetophagus_; in the arboreous ones,\r\nand under bark, more than one kind of _Ips_; and in _Auricularia_, as\r\nwell as _Boletus_, the whole genus _Cis_. Upon _living_ Vertebrate\r\nanimals you must look for _Pulices_, _Pediculi_, _Nirmi_, _Acari_,\r\nand many _Diptera_, as _Œstrus_, _Tabanus_, _Stomoxys_, and the\r\n_Pupipara_ of Latreille; and on the garden-snails for that curious\r\ngenus _Drilus_, and some _Acari_[1539]. The caterpillars and pupæ of\r\n_Lepidoptera_, &c. will, as you have heard, furnish you with numerous\r\nichneumons[1540]. On _dead_ animals you will find the various\r\nspecies of _Silphidæ_, _Nitidulidæ_, _Dermestidæ_, _Byrrhidæ_,\r\n_Chlolevidæ_, _Staphilinidæ_, _Muscidæ_, &c.; and in excrement,\r\nvarious _Scarabæidæ_, _Histeridæ_, _Aphodiadæ_, _Sphæridiadæ_, the\r\n_Brachyptera_ in general, and several _Diptera_[1541]. In putrescent\r\nroots and fruits, as the turnip, the cucumber, &c., you may also\r\noccasionally meet with rare _Coleoptera_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must next say something upon the _seasons_ of insects, and their\r\ntimes of appearance. Those that collect honey and pollen are generally\r\namong the first that proclaim the approach of spring; and their\r\nappearance may be dated from the blossoming of certain trees and plants\r\nof common occurrence. Other plants, accompanied by peculiar insects,\r\nblossom later; and so on till we arrive at the autumn. The _earliest_\r\ninsect-season commences with the flowering of the _sallow_ (_Salix\r\nCaprea_) usually accompanied in the garden by that of the _crocus_ and\r\nthe _gooseberry_. Then is your time to collect many species of wild\r\nbees and _Diptera_ not afterwards to be met with: and various other\r\ninsects now begin to emerge from their winter-quarters, or are produced\r\nfrom the pupa. _Another_ and later season is marked by the general\r\nblossoming of the butter-cup (_Ranunculus bulbosus_), accompanied by\r\nthe marsh-marygold (_Caltha palustris_) and ladies'-smock (_Cardamine\r\npratensis_); when you may hunt the pastures, meadows, and marshes with\r\nsuccess, and take some insects that do not show themselves later.\r\nThe coprophagous insects are now abundant. Amongst others, _Aphodius\r\ntestudinarius_, a perfectly _vernal_ species, is now only to be taken,\r\nand usually flying. A _third_ insect-season indicated by Flora, and a\r\nvery prolific one, commences with the blossoming of the _hawthorn_,\r\nwhen you must desert the meads for the inclosures. At this time all\r\nnature begins to put on her gayest attire, and all her insect tribes\r\nare now on the alert, and fill the air. They are almost universally\r\nattracted by the sweet and lovely blossoms of the plant just named: so\r\nthat by examining them you may entrap some of every Order, and many\r\nthat during the year will appear no more. Even many of the saprophagous\r\ninsects will sip nectar from these flowers. The _umbelliferous_\r\nplants proclaim the _fourth_ season of insects, particularly the wild\r\n_carrot_ and _parsnip_. You will scarcely ever fail to find, if the\r\nweather is genial, _Hymenopterous_ and _Dipterous_ insects of various\r\ngenera,--especially such as have a _short_ tongue,--engaged in\r\ncollecting the honey from those plants. Here you may take some of the\r\nrarer _Chrysidæ_, _Crabronidæ_, _Cercerides_, &c., and occasionally\r\neven _Coleoptera_. The _last_ insect-season may be dated from the\r\ngeneral flowering of the _thistle_ tribe. When these are in blossom is\r\nthe best time of all to collect the _humble-bees_ (_Bombus_[1542]), the\r\nleaf-cutter bees (_Megachile_[1543]), and many other _Apiariæ_, which\r\nalone by their long tongues can imbibe the honey and collect the pollen\r\nof these flowers. The male humble-bees frequent them to the last, and\r\noften seem as if they were intoxicated with their sweets.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you may prefer considering the whole summer appearance\r\nof insects as divided into _three_ principal seasons. This may thus\r\nbe done. Their _vernal_ season may commence _Florente Caprea_, and\r\nend _Florente Oxyacantha_; their _summer_, _Florente Oxyacantha_ and\r\n_Florentibus Umbellatis_; their _autumn_, _Florentibus Umbellatis_\r\nand _Florente Carduo_. In the _first_, the number of insects will\r\nbe daily _increasing_; in the _second_ (which is the harvest of the\r\nEntomologist, when his eyes and his hands ought to be every where),\r\nthey will reach their _utmost complement_; and in the _third_, they\r\nwill be gradually decreasing in number, till they generally die,\r\nor go into winter-quarters. At this time many minute _Diptera_ and\r\nIchneumons take shelter from the weather in the windows of our\r\napartments. These seasons will not always exactly correspond with\r\nour usual reckoning, and take place at the same time; since, being\r\nregulated by our varying temperature, they will be sometimes sooner\r\nand sometimes later, sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. Though\r\nI have not named a _brumal_ season, because insects are in winter\r\nusually torpid,--yet some, as _Diurnea Novembris_, _Cheimatobia\r\nbrumata_, and many _Tipulariæ_, even then make their appearance.\r\n\r\nIf you ask, Whether it be not possible to regulate our Entomological\r\nseasons by the appearance of insects themselves? I should answer,\r\nthat probably this might be done; but that further observations seem\r\nwanted to enable us to do it satisfactorily. Perhaps the appearance\r\nof _Formica rufa_ beginning the business of the year might form the\r\ncommencement of one season; the flight of the orange-tip butterfly\r\n(_Pontia Cardamines_[1544]), of a second; a third might be indicated by\r\nthe swarming of _Melolontha vulgaris_; a fourth, by that of _Amphimalla\r\nsolstitialis_; and the last, by the appearance in numbers of _Aphodius\r\nciliaris_, which in the autumn fills every horse-dropping.\r\n\r\nSome insects are so ephemeral, that they are to be found in numbers\r\nonly for a few days, and then disappear for that season. Of this\r\ndescription are the _Ephemeræ_, much of whose history has been detailed\r\nto you. Those of which De Geer has given an account (_E. vulgata_)\r\nappeared about the end of May or the beginning of June, and continued\r\nabout a _fortnight_[1545]; while those which Swammerdam observed\r\ndid not come forth till the middle of June, and lasted only _three_\r\ndays[1546]. The _same_ period distinguished those of which Reaumur has\r\ncompiled so interesting a history, but they did not show themselves\r\nbefore the middle of August[1547]. My kind friend Mr. Marsham not long\r\nbefore his death copied for me some memoranda he had made with respect\r\nto the sudden appearance of _Cercopis bifasciata_. On one occasion\r\nthe white dress of a lady sitting upon a haycock was covered by these\r\ninsects; but on the following day the same steps were taken at the same\r\ntime to procure some, when after the most diligent search not a single\r\none could be found. The same circumstance was observed a few years\r\nafterwards by another friend of his. He himself was of opinion that the\r\ninsects in question were then migrating[1548].\r\n\r\nI may here observe, that the London amateurs have particular _seasons_\r\nfor collecting _moths_. For the _imago_ they go into the woods in\r\n_April_, _May_, _June_, and _October_. For the _larvæ_ they take the\r\nbeginning of _April_, _June_, the beginning of _July_, and _September_.\r\nThey dig for _pupæ_ late in _July_, and in _January_ and _February_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall lastly make a few observations upon the _times_ of _action_\r\nand _repose_ of insects, the knowledge of which, as far as it can\r\nbe obtained, is of essential use to the industrious collector.\r\nEntomologists have divided the _Lepidoptera_, with a view to this\r\ncircumstance, into _diurnal_, _crepuscular_, and _nocturnal_; or\r\nbutterflies (_Papilio_ L.), hawkmoths (_Sphinx_ L.), and moths\r\n(_Phalæna_ L.). These terms may be applied to insects in general.\r\n\r\ni. _Diurnal_ insects are abundant. _Butterflies_ in particular fly\r\ngenerally at no other time: they accompany the sun in his course, and\r\nbefore he sets disappear. Some other _Lepidoptera_, though not so\r\nnamed, are _day_ insects:--such are the _Zygænidæ_, &c. amongst the\r\nhawkmoths; and amongst the moths, _Plusia Gamma_, the _Phytometræ\r\nsolares_ of Haworth[1549], and some others. Numberless _Coleoptera_\r\nbelong to this section. The _Donaciæ_ fly only when the sun is out\r\nand the air is warm; they are then extremely agile and difficult\r\nto take. Some _Hopliæ_ swarm in the day before noon, and then\r\ndisappear[1550]: most of the _tetramerous_ beetles also appear to be\r\ndiurnal. The _Libellulina_ and many other _Neuroptera_ may also be\r\nso termed; and the _Hymenoptera_ almost universally, with the sole\r\nexception of the _Formicidæ_[1551]. Amongst the _Diptera_, if we\r\nleave out the _Tipulariæ_, the rest will be found for the most part\r\nto belong to the present section.\r\n\r\nii. _Crepuscular_ insects, strictly speaking, are those that appear\r\nonly during the twilight, whether in the morning or evening; but the\r\nterm may be understood, with some latitude, to signify all those\r\ninsects that are seen only in the morning and evening, though after\r\nsunrise and before sunset. Of these, some come forth only in the\r\n_morning_, others only in the _evening_, and others both _morning_\r\nand _evening_. My memory only furnishes me with a single instance of\r\nan insect whose principal appearance and flight are in the _morning_.\r\n_Catocala nupta_ I have often seen flying at this time, about six or\r\nseven o'clock, and never at any other: I am not however prepared to\r\nassert that it does not appear in the evening or night, but I have\r\nthen never met with it. In the _evening_ more particularly you hear\r\nthe hum of the dung-beetle (_Geotrupes_), which Linné thought the\r\nprognostic of a following fine day; and of the swarms of _Melolontha\r\nvulgaris_ and _Amphimalla solstitialis_. Then also many other\r\n_Coleoptera_ are in the air; especially before a thunderstorm, a\r\nstate of the atmosphere that particularly excites insects[1552]:\r\n_Ptinus imperialis_ and _germanus_ I have never taken except under\r\nthese circumstances. Then the _Ephemeræ_ sport in the air, and lead\r\ntheir mystic dance. The majority of the hawkmoths are then too on\r\nthe wing, with their long tongues imbibing the nectar of the flowers\r\nwhile they hover over them, both _morning_ and _evening_.\r\n\r\niii. In the _night_ the main body of the _moths_ take their flight, as\r\nwell as a vast number of _Coleoptera_ and insects of other orders. At\r\nthis time the _Blattæ_ and crickets leave their hiding-places and run\r\nabout: but the other _Grylli_ L., though they sing in the night, fly\r\nonly in the day. Then also the _Carabi_, like beasts of prey, leave\r\ntheir dark retreats,--in this differing from the _Cicindelæ_, which\r\nare diurnal,--and prowl about to entrap other unwary insects. Then,\r\nlikewise, the female glowworm hangs out her lamp of love, and the male,\r\nled by it, wings his way to her: and then the water-beetles (_Dytisci_,\r\n_Gyrini_, &c.) forsake the waves and become tenants of the air.\r\n\r\nCould we with certainty discover the stations in which insects after\r\ntheir excursions take their _repose_, we might capture many that\r\nwe now search for in vain. Several of these stations were pointed\r\nout in a former part of this letter where I detailed their usual\r\n_haunts_. I may here add, that numbers of them, when reposing,\r\nconceal themselves from their enemies on the under side of the\r\nleaves of trees and plants. Moths, especially the _Noctuidæ_, may\r\noften be met with in woods, as before observed[1553], on the _north_\r\nside of the trunks of trees. Mr. Marsham related to me, that once a\r\nlittle before sunset, observing over his head a number of insects\r\non the wing moving on in one direction, he caught some of them, and\r\nthey proved to be _Labia minor_. Struck with the circumstance, he\r\nwatched them several evenings; and on one, as he was looking about\r\na melon-pit for insects, he saw these little animals alight on the\r\nframe, hastily fold up their wings, and entering under the glasses,\r\nrun down its sides and bury themselves in the loose earth. This he\r\nobserved repeatedly. The onward flight of these insects was therefore\r\nevidently their return from their diurnal cruise to their nocturnal\r\nstation.--This happened in September.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1458] Linn. _Philos.

The Entomologist when he makes an\r\nexcursion should have _three_ principal objects in view, for which\r\nhe ought to be duly prepared. The first is to _find_ insects, the\r\nnext is to _catch_ them, and the last when taken to bring them _safe_\r\nhome. In exploring their haunts he must also recollect that some\r\nwill be _reposing_; others _feeding_; others _walking_ or _running_;\r\nothers _flying_; others _swimming_; others _lurking_ in various\r\nplaces of concealment, and in _different_ states of existence; and\r\nthat he must be prepared with means of coming at and capturing them\r\nunder all these circumstances.\r\n\r\n1. First furnish yourself with a strong _knife_ or other instrument\r\nwith which you can raise the bark or penetrate the wood of any\r\ntree, when circumstances indicate that insects are busy below the\r\none or within the other. There is no better tool for this and\r\nother purposes than Mr. Samouelle's _digger_, which consists of an\r\niron five inches long, rather more than one-third of an inch in\r\ndiameter, forming a curve towards the extremity, terminating in a\r\nlozenge-shaped point, and strongly fixed in a wooden handle[1554].\r\nWith this you may not only explore the interior of timber-trees, but\r\ngrub up the turf under them, and examine the earth for the pupæ of\r\n_Lepidoptera_. When your object is merely this _latter_ purpose, a\r\npotato-fork--which is better than a spade, as it will seldom injure\r\nthe pupæ--will be your best implement.\r\n\r\n2. Next have a _stick_, to resemble a common walking-stick,\r\nsufficiently stout to beat the branches of the trees and shrubs, fitted\r\nat one end with a male screw, and at the other with a female, with a\r\nbrass cap to screw over each to keep the dirt from them. Besides this,\r\nyou may carry with you a spare piece or two about a foot long, properly\r\nequipped to screw to it when you want to lengthen it.\r\n\r\n3. Another implement must be a _bag-net_[1555]. This consists of a\r\nhoop of stout brass wire about nine inches or a foot in diameter,\r\nwith a socket to receive the end of your stick, or, what is more\r\nsecure, a screw to fix it to it, with a bag of gauze, muslin, or\r\nfine canvass, about twelve inches deep, sewed round it. The French\r\ncollectors use a net of this kind, in which the hoop is formed of\r\ntwo semicircular pieces of iron or brass wire hooked together at\r\none end, and at the other made to lap over the corresponding piece,\r\nand pierced to receive the screw at one end of your stick. When\r\nnot employed, they double the hoop and conceal it under the vest;\r\nthey fix to it a muslin bag of two feet long. This net is made to\r\nserve various purposes. With it they catch _Lepidoptera_ and other\r\n_flying_ insects; and an adroit collector by giving it a certain\r\ntwist completely closes the mouth, so as to prevent the escape of\r\nhis captives. Fixed to a very long pole (Mr. Haworth says it should\r\nbe _twenty_ or _thirty_ feet long[1556]), it is the best net for\r\nthe purple emperor butterfly (_Apatura Iris_). It is also used with\r\nsuccess to _push_ before you through the _grass_ of meadows, woods,\r\n&c., and thus often displaces numerous insects, which fall into\r\nit;--every now and then it is examined, and the valuable captures\r\nsecured. The common bag-net will perform the same operations, but\r\nis not deep enough for _flying_ insects. If you lengthen your stick\r\nbefore you screw it on, it enables you to brush with it the weeds\r\nat the sides and bottom of ditches. This employment of brushing the\r\ngrass, &c. may be carried on if you are walking with any friend not\r\ninterested in Entomology, without much interruption of conversation.\r\nFor this last operation--sweeping the grass, &c.--if you wish at any\r\ntime to devote a morning wholly to it, you will find a net invented\r\nby the late Mr. Paul, of Starston in Norfolk, and which he employs\r\nto clear his turnips of _Haltica Nemorum_[1557], a very useful\r\nimplement. The accompanying figure will give you a better idea of it\r\nthan any description[1558]; you may make it large or small according\r\nto your convenience: the wider it is, the greater space it will brush\r\nat once. When your object is a more general investigation, the\r\nbag-net just described is preferable.\r\n\r\n4. Scarcely any implement seems a greater favourite with British\r\ncollectors than what may be called the _fly-net_[1559]. This is\r\nuniversally employed by them for capturing _flying_ insects,\r\nespecially _Lepidoptera_. It is similar to what is called a\r\n_bat-fowling_ net, and should be made of green or white gauze or\r\ncoarse muslin. The _former_ colour, as being less visible, is most\r\nproper for _mothing_ in the _night_; but the _latter_ is best for the\r\n_day_, as this net is useful to hold under the branches of trees and\r\nshrubs to receive the insects that fall when they are beaten. The\r\nrods for the net we are considering,--which should be about five feet\r\nlong, half an inch in diameter at the base, and gradually tapering\r\nto the end,--must be made of some tough wood; each should consist of\r\nabout four joints for the convenience of carriage, and each joint\r\nshould be fitted with a socket at the lower extremity, to receive the\r\ntop of the joint below it: the terminal joint must either be bent\r\ninto a curve, or fitted with an angular socket or ferrule, so as to\r\nform an obtuse angle with the rest of the rod[1560]. The gauze which\r\nis to form the net, being cut into the requisite shape, should be\r\nwelted round, except at the bottom, where it should have a deep fold\r\nor a bag for preventing the escape of the included insects--in order\r\nto form a slide for the rods to slip in. At the apex where they meet,\r\na few stitches should be set, or a piece of leather sewed in, to\r\nprevent their going too far. At the bottom, on each side, two strings\r\nmust be sewed on the net, to receive which there must be a hole in\r\neach rod about six inches from the bottom: these must be tied, which\r\nwill keep the net from slipping upwards. When you go after moths\r\nand other insects that fly in the _night_, a plan, as I am told,\r\nof some of the London collectors may be adopted with advantage.\r\nCause a lanthorn to be made with a concave back, and furnished with\r\na reflector: this must be fastened, by means of a strap, upon the\r\nstomach. If you hold your expanded fly-net before this (as nocturnal\r\ninsects fly to the light), you may thus entrap a considerable number.\r\nIn sultry summer nights also, if you place a candle on a table in a\r\nsummer-house, or even in a common apartment, and open the windows,\r\nyou will often have excellent sport, and take insects you might\r\notherwise never meet with.\r\n\r\nWhen you use your fly-net, you must take the rods one in each hand,\r\nso as to keep it extended; and when you have brought it fairly beyond\r\nthe insect you are pursuing,--to accomplish which you must be upon\r\nthe alert,--you must bring the two sticks together, which, if you\r\nare commonly dexterous, will capture your prey. This net is likewise\r\nuseful in taking winged insects when at rest upon the ground, by\r\nsimply spreading it over them. When you use it to beat into, as above\r\nrecommended, you must take both the sticks in one hand, and extend it\r\nby crossing them as much as you can. In the absence of this, a common\r\numbrella, or even a sheet of stiff paper which you may carry folded\r\nin your pocket, are no bad substitutes. When your object is _beating\r\nthe bushes_, bring your fly-net, &c. rapidly under the branches you\r\nmean to operate upon, or the insects will fall from them to the\r\nground before you are prepared.\r\n\r\nUnder this head I may mention a very ingenious net for taking\r\n_Lepidoptera_, particularly _butterflies_, invented by Dr. Maclean\r\nof Colchester, which I would call _Maclean's elastic net_. It is\r\nconstructed of two pieces of stout, split cane, connected by a joint\r\nat each end and with a rod which lies between them, in which a pulley\r\nis fixed; through this a cord fastened to the canes passes; a long\r\ncane with a ferrule receives the lower end of the rod and forms a\r\nhandle; and to the canes is fastened a net of green gauze. Taking the\r\nhandle in your right hand, and the string in your left, when you pull\r\nthe latter the canes bend till they form a hoop, and the net appended\r\nto them is open; when your prey is in it, relax the cord, and the\r\ncanes become straight and close the mouth of the net, keeping them\r\nclose with your left hand, you may soon disable your prey with your\r\nright. Dr. Maclean has scarcely ever found this net fail.\r\n\r\n5. Another instrument which should be constantly in the hands of the\r\nEntomologist is the _forceps_[1561]. This is particularly useful\r\nfor catching _Diptera_ and _Hymenoptera_ chiefly while at rest on\r\nthe leaves and flowers of plants. Both these tribes are usually too\r\nagile to be taken by the hand alone, which besides without this\r\ncontrivance would be exposed to the stings of many of the latter.\r\nThe leaves of the forceps should be _octagonal_, five or six inches\r\nin diameter, and covered with green gauze, or rather very fine\r\ncatgut, which will enable the head of a lace-pin to pass through\r\nit. You must direct your artisan to make the joint of the handle\r\nnearer the rings for the finger and thumb than to the leaves, or the\r\ninstrument will not open well. An old pair of curling-irons might\r\nbe made into very good handles; but the hoop to which the catgut\r\nis fastened should be brass, or if iron it ought to be painted to\r\nsecure it from rust. Some make the leaves of the forceps _round_;\r\nbut when an insect is perched on a wall or any _vertical_ surface,\r\nit has less chance of escape if you can apply a straight side to its\r\nstation. The Germans use a much longer and larger instrument of this\r\nkind, having leaves of ten or twelve inches in diameter, which they\r\nuse to catch _Lepidoptera_ when settled on plants. When you aim at\r\nan insect with your forceps, you must expand the leaves as much as\r\npossible, and cautiously approach your prey; and when within reach,\r\nclose them upon it suddenly, including the leaf or flower on which\r\nit rests. As these are sometimes bulky, and prevent the instrument\r\nfrom shutting closely,--that the included insect may not escape, it\r\nis often necessary to use the other hand to bring them together, when\r\nthe pressure of the finger and thumb soon disables it.\r\n\r\n6. As the _waters_, whether running or stagnant, as well as the earth\r\nand the air, teem with insects, you must likewise be provided with\r\na net of a different description from any of the preceding, that\r\nyou may _fish_ them out. It may be made of fine canvass, just deep\r\nenough to prevent the insect from jumping out, and fastened to a\r\nbrass hoop five or six inches in diameter, not perfectly circular,\r\nbut having the segment of a circle cut off anteriorly, so that it\r\nwill apply well to a flat vertical surface; and fitted posteriorly\r\nwith a socket, to receive the end of your stick; or, what is better,\r\nwith a _screw_, which will securely fasten it to it[1562]. In using\r\nthis net, different modes may be adopted. You may either watch\r\nthe motions of an individual insect, and secure it by darting the\r\nnet beyond it and drawing it towards you; or by placing it quietly\r\nunder it, and then elevating it suddenly; or you may push your net\r\nat random along the margins of the pools and rivers amongst the\r\nweeds, &c.; amongst the duck-weed (_Lemna_) on their surface, or\r\nthe mud at the bottom; and when you examine its contents, you will\r\noften find valuable captures. I have thus sometimes got rich booty\r\nin the most unlikely places;--such as _Hydræna longipalpis_, and an\r\nallied nondescript species, &c.; and by fishing amongst _Zanichellia\r\npalustris_, _Hæmonia Zosteræ_. If at any time you do not happen to\r\nhave your water-net with you, with a common rake you may take the\r\nduck-weed from the surface of a pool, and upon examination you will\r\noften detect amongst it many minute water-beetles.\r\n\r\nBut besides all these implements you will find your _finger_ and\r\n_thumb_ a very _handy_ forceps when insects are stationary or walking\r\nupon the ground; and even when flying, minute ones that you would not\r\notherwise meet with may be taken by the palm of your hand, wetted\r\nwith saliva, if, when you see them swarming in the air, you pass\r\nit to and fro amongst them. When such are stationary, or moving on\r\nthe ground, on rails, the trunks of trees, &c., the fore-finger,\r\nso wetted, will often best secure them: but if they are perched on\r\na summit or a vertical surface, before you approach near enough\r\nto alarm them bring forward quietly your bag-net, and hold it so\r\nthat they may fall into it, if they attempt by falling to escape\r\nyou. Other methods of entrapping insects may also be pursued with\r\nsuccess. A table-cloth spread on the grass in the open parts of\r\na wood I have known allure several scarce insects: a lady's white\r\ndress is equally attractive. An old mattress, laid at night upon a\r\ngrass-plat, if suddenly reversed in the morning, will supply the\r\nEntomologist occasionally with good _Coleoptera_. No better trap for\r\nthe _Silphidæ_, _Dermestidæ_, &c., than a piece of carrion, a frog,\r\nor mole, &c. The numerous insects that inhabit excrement of every\r\nkind, especially that of the cow and the horse, may be best taken by\r\nimmersing their pabulum in water: for this purpose, let a boy carry\r\na spade and pail to the scene of action, and filling the pail nearly\r\nfull of water begin the operation, and all the insects lurking in the\r\nsubmerged dung will come to the surface, and may be easily taken.\r\n\r\nAnother object of the collector of insects, when he has once\r\nentrapped them, is to bring them _safe_ home. The Entomologists on\r\nthe Continent, I believe, generally transfix their prey, of whatever\r\nOrder, with a pin, as soon as they are caught: but as _hard_ ones,\r\nsuch as _Coleoptera_, _Hemiptera_, &c., may be destroyed without\r\ninjury by immersion either in spirits of wine or boiling water; and\r\nas large beetles, if transfixed (not to mention the unnecessary\r\ncruelty of so serving them), are apt to whirl round upon the pin in\r\nspite of any precaution, and injure themselves, and destroy other\r\ninsects that are in their way, it seems best to kill them by other\r\nmore effectual methods. With regard to those that would be injured\r\nby immersion in any fluid, as the _Lepidoptera_, _Hymenoptera_,\r\n_Diptera_, &c., they must be secured as soon as taken; and after\r\nhaving disabled them as much as you can without injuring them, by\r\npressing the trunk below the wings with the finger and thumb, they\r\nshould be transfixed and put into a pocket-box lined with cork. Some\r\nuse an oblong deep chip one, with paper pasted over it, and lined at\r\ntop and bottom, the top being convenient for setting small moths. But\r\nthis you will find not easy to open when you have an insect in one\r\nhand; and it is too deep for the pocket. I generally use a mahogany\r\none, about 7-1/2 inches by 4-1/2 and 1-1/4 deep in the clear, corked\r\nonly at the bottom, and opening by pressing a spring, which can be\r\ndone with one hand. This will contain as many of the above insects\r\nas you will usually take in a day's excursion. When travelling, you\r\nshould provide yourself with larger store-boxes, to receive at night\r\nthe fruit of the day's hunt. These may be 18 inches square and 2-1/2\r\ndeep, corked at top and bottom; which should be of equal depth,\r\nand fit very closely, to keep out _Acari_, &c. Entomologists have\r\nrecourse to various ways of bringing home insects for immersion. For\r\nthe larger ones, you must be provided with a number of small boxes,\r\nthe lids of which are not liable to come off in the pocket. If it can\r\nbe done, it is best to have only a single insect in a box. If you\r\nhave several, those that are predaceous in their habits will probably\r\ndevour the rest: and besides, if you open a box to put in other\r\ninsects, generally one or two of those before imprisoned in it will\r\nmake their escape. It is best to put the boxes containing an insect\r\nin one pocket, and the empty ones in another. If your boxes are\r\nnumbered, in a small memorandum-book, which you should carry for the\r\npurpose, you may make any remarks as to the food, station, and habits\r\nof any insect you may take, inserting against them the number of the\r\nbox or phial that contains it, and it will be ready for future use.\r\nFor the smaller beetles, &c. a number of phials, with their rims\r\nground down and the mouths well fitted with corks, must be provided;\r\nbut for those you do not wish to keep separate, a wide-mouthed phial\r\nfilled with spirits of wine, which soon kills them, is the best\r\nreceptacle. I have found, when at a loss, a piece of elder, with\r\nthe pith taken out to a sufficient depth at each end and each mouth\r\nstopped with a wooden plug, a useful insect box. As numerous insects\r\ninhabit the various species of _Boleti_, if you go where these are to\r\nbe found, unless you are a very agile person and expert at climbing,\r\na boy with a short light ladder will be no useless accompaniment.\r\n\r\nSomething may be said in this place upon the _dress_ with which the\r\nEntomologist should provide himself. I shall not recommend to you,\r\nin imitation of the insect-hunters in the vignette to Reaumur's\r\nsecond volume, to put on a bag-wig and a velvet court-dress; but the\r\nplain fustian jacket with side and other pockets used by English\r\nsportsmen will very well suit your purpose; only let the pockets be\r\nsufficiently ample: have also an inside one fixed on the left-hand\r\nside to receive your forceps. You may also have a bag like a\r\nshooter's, or an angler's basket, which may contain your nets till\r\nyou want to use them. With all your implements about you, you will\r\nperhaps at first be stared and grinned at by the vulgar; but they\r\nwill soon become reconciled to you, and regard you no more than your\r\nbrethren of the angle and of the gun. Things that are unusual are\r\ntoo often esteemed ridiculous; and the philosopher whose object is\r\nto collect and study the wonderful works of his CREATOR, is often\r\nregarded by the ignorant plebeian as little short of a madman.\r\n\r\nSuch is the apparatus to be provided by the entomological Nimrod:\r\nit is not often, however, that it will be necessary, except in\r\ndistant excursions, to encumber and disfigure yourself with the\r\nwhole. Even in this pursuit more may be effected by a judicious\r\ndivision of labour, than by grasping at every thing at once; and your\r\nacquisitions will in the end be more numerous, and your acquaintance\r\nwith them more intimate, if at one time you devote yourself to the\r\nwoods and hedges, another to the plains and meadows, a third to any\r\nheaths in your vicinity, and a fourth to the collection of aquatic\r\ninsects whether from stagnant or running waters:--having thus chosen\r\nthe scene of action, you may equip yourself accordingly. You will\r\nof course, though in pursuit of a particular description of game,\r\nnot neglect to seize any other insects that fall in your way; but\r\nfor this purpose it is unnecessary to be always provided with a\r\ncertain instrument. Dr. Franklin used to say that a man would never\r\nmake a Natural Philosopher, who, in performing his experiments,\r\ncould not saw with a gimblet or bore with a saw; and so we may say,\r\nhe will never make an expert collector of insects, who on occasion\r\ncannot fish with his hand or forceps, use his hat or an old letter\r\nto beat his game into, or, in the absence of boxes or bottles,\r\ncontrive to secure his captures in small pieces of paper twisted up.\r\nSparrman, when at the Cape, was wont,--to the no small amazement of\r\nthe wondering natives, who took him for a conjurer,--to stick his\r\nimpaled insects round the outside of his hat[1563]: and though I\r\nshould not recommend such an exhibition in a civilized region, it\r\nhas often struck me that the cavity of a modern hat, if lined with\r\ncork, might be made a very useful receptacle for these animals in a\r\nlong excursion. Indeed, an active Entomologist is never at a loss\r\nfor an apparatus, but often makes his most valuable captures when\r\nunprovided with other instruments than his hands and eyes. A careful\r\nsurvey of the trunk and branches of trees and shrubs, particularly of\r\nthe underside of their leaves, seldom fails to detect many a lurking\r\nmoth or beetle, which may be transfixed or otherwise captured with\r\nlittle trouble by an expert hand. In this way an ingenious collector,\r\nwho scarcely knew what a net of any kind was, told me he had made his\r\nwhole collection, which was rather extensive. It is, in fact, only\r\nby thus detecting them when reposing, and adroitly shutting them up\r\nalong with the leaf on which they sit, in a box, that minute moths\r\n(whose beauty and freshness the slightest handling destroys) can\r\nordinarily be taken without being injured. The boxes containing them\r\nshould afterwards be exposed to the action of heat, a low degree of\r\nwhich will destroy them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnough has been said upon the best modes of _catching_ insects:--I\r\nshall next attempt to give you some further instructions as to the\r\nmost effectual one of _destroying_ them when caught, and to point\r\nout how you are to proceed with them after they are dead. As I\r\nsufficiently rebutted the charge of cruelty in a former letter[1564],\r\nit will not be necessary to enter here into that subject.\r\n\r\nI have before recommended to you the use of _spirits of wine_, and\r\nshall here repeat my recommendation; for after several years trial,\r\nI am of Böhm's opinion, who had tried it nine years[1565], that it\r\nis superior to any other method; particularly, because it not only\r\neffectually kills the insects, and they may be put together into it\r\nwhile you are collecting, if you have no reason for keeping them\r\nseparate, of all sorts and sizes, in a wide-mouthed phial, without\r\ndanger of their devouring each other: but when you come home wearied\r\nwith a long day's hunt, you may let your insects remain in it without\r\ninjury till the next morning. In collecting beetles abroad, when\r\nthere is a want of store-boxes the readiest way is to put them into\r\na wide-mouthed bottle or jar filled with any spirit, and send them\r\nhome in it: some few may lose their colours, or become greasy; but in\r\ngeneral they will receive little injury. This method saves room, and\r\navoids the risk of breakage. The derangement which some hairy species\r\nsustain from this method may be readily repaired by brushing them\r\nwith a dry camel's-hair pencil.\r\n\r\nWhen you wish to take the insects you have immersed in spirits\r\nout of the phial, you must strain its contents through a piece of\r\nmuslin, return the spirit into it for future use, and spread the\r\ninsects _separately_ upon blotting-paper, to absorb the moisture\r\nremaining about them. With regard to such as you have in boxes or\r\nphials without spirit, these must be immersed in a basin of _boiling_\r\nwater. First empty into it the contents of your boxes, and next,\r\nthose of your phials; giving each, before you take out the cork,\r\na smart rap, that the insects adhering to the latter may drop to\r\nthe bottom: or you may immerse the phial itself, with the cork in,\r\nwhich soon destroys them, and is the safest plan. This done, with a\r\ncamel's-hair pencil or feather take them out of the water, lay them\r\nupon blotting-paper to dry, and put them by for a few hours till you\r\nhave leisure to impale and set them.\r\n\r\nThose insects that are caught by the _forceps_ would for the most\r\npart escape you, were you to attempt to get them out before you had\r\ntransfixed them. You must therefore do this while the leaves of the\r\ninstrument are closed; and then opening them, and taking the pin by\r\nthe point, the head will readily pass through the catgut; and thus\r\nyou may safely take, and more effectually kill your specimen by\r\npressing it as before directed. With respect to _Lepidoptera_, it\r\nis necessary to disable them while yet in the fly-net, immediately\r\nafter their capture. To effect this, while one hand holds both the\r\nrods of the closed net, with the other stretch the gauze so as to\r\nconfine your insect within a narrow space; bring its wings into an\r\nerect position, and prevent its fluttering: which being done, with\r\nyour finger and thumb give its breast a strong pinch below the wings;\r\nand then unfolding your net, and taking it up by one of its antennæ,\r\nplace it between the finger and thumb of your left hand, stick a pin\r\nthrough it, and deposit it in your pocket-box.\r\n\r\nBut though nipping the breast will kill many small _Lepidoptera_,\r\nthe larger ones will live long after it; as will likewise many\r\n_Neuroptera_, _Hymenoptera_, and _Diptera_: and besides this, in some\r\n_Bombycidæ_ the thorax presents a very conspicuous and interesting\r\ncharacter, which renders it desirable, in order to avoid the damage\r\nor derangement occasioned by pressure, to transfix them without it.\r\nTo dispatch these effectually, you will find the following apparatus\r\nvery convenient. Fix in a small tin saucepan[1566] filled with boiling\r\nwater, a tin tube consisting of two pieces[1567] that fit into each\r\nother; cover the mouth of the lower one[1568] with a piece of gauze or\r\ncanvass, and place your insects upon it; then fix the upper one[1569]\r\nover it, and cover also the mouth of this with gauze, &c.; and the\r\nsteam from the boiling water will effectually kill your insects without\r\ninjuring their plumage. There is another more simple mode of doing\r\nthis, the apparatus for which may be met with every where. Fix a piece\r\nor two of elder, willow, or any soft wood, with the bark on, across the\r\nbottom of a mug, and on this stick your impaled insects; invert the\r\nmug in a deep basin, into which pour boiling water till it is covered,\r\nholding it down with a knife, &c., that the expansion of the included\r\nair may not overturn it. In two minutes, or less, all the insects\r\nwill be found quite dead, and not at all wetted. If the sticks do not\r\nexactly fit, they may be wedged in with a piece of cork. Professor\r\nPeck, who used to put minute insects into the hollow of a quill stopped\r\nwith a piece of wood made to fit, killed them instantaneously by\r\nholding it over the flame of a candle.\r\n\r\nHaving killed your insects, your next object should be to prepare\r\nthem for your cabinet. First, place by you a pincushion well stored\r\nwith lace-pins of various magnitudes and lengths: for most insects\r\nthose nearly an inch in length, for large ones, those that are\r\nthicker and longer, but for _Lepidoptera_, a stouter kind, as _short\r\nwhites_, are best. Next, take the _Coleoptera_ and _Hemiptera_\r\nthat, as before directed, you have laid by on blotting-paper after\r\nimmersion, and begin your operations, selecting the largest first.\r\nThe pin should be stuck through the middle of the right-hand\r\nelytrum[1570], and about _one third_ of its whole length should\r\nemerge above the insect. Some _foreign_ collectors, probably having\r\nin view its more convenient examination with a microscope under\r\nthe glass of a drawer, bring it nearer the head of the pin: while\r\nthe _English_ ones, on the contrary, studying the most ornamental\r\nposition of their specimens, leave only enough of the point free to\r\nfix them safely in their drawers[1571]. Both these methods are open\r\nto objection. When the insect is too near the head of the pin, it is\r\ndifficult to fix it in your cabinet without bending the wire; and\r\nthere is danger, without great care, of injuring the specimen when\r\nyou put it in or take it out. Again: When the legs of your insect\r\nrest on the surface they collect the dust and dirt, are very liable\r\nto be broken, and the length of the pin above it is inconvenient when\r\nyou have occasion to examine any one under a lens. _Lepidoptera_,\r\nhowever, which are never thus examined, may always be transfixed in\r\nthis way, which sets them off to the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\nSome insects, especially of the beetle tribe, are so extremely minute\r\nthat it is next to an impossibility to get a pin through them without\r\ninjuring, and often destroying them. By using fine needles, or very\r\nslender pins manufactured on purpose, this difficulty might perhaps\r\nbe surmounted; but the needles will be subject to rust, and the pins,\r\nI know by experience, cannot be fixed in cork without difficulty. For\r\nsuch minute insects, therefore, by far the best mode is to _gum_ them\r\non small pieces of card, which may be stuck upon a pin. Talc, which\r\nadmits the underside of an insect to be seen through it, has been\r\nused for this purpose; and where you have only a single specimen, a\r\nthin small lamina of it would answer well; but ordinarily I should\r\nrecommend the former mode. Your pieces of card, which must be small,\r\nmay be either oblong and cut at the corners for neatness, with a\r\ncouple of specimens gummed upon each, one on its belly and the other\r\non its back; or you may cut little narrow card wedges, about four\r\nlines long and terminating in a point, upon which you may so gum your\r\ninsects as to show the principal part of the under side, as well as\r\nthe upper side of its body. Common gum-water made rather thin, with a\r\nvery little glue mixed with it, will answer your purpose very well:\r\nit should be thinly spread on the card with a camel's-hair pencil,\r\nand then the insect placed upon it. With the same implement, if it\r\nhas not been killed too long, before the gum is dry you may expand\r\nits antennæ, palpi, legs, and wings, &c. If you want to remove a\r\nspecimen gummed on a card for any purpose, it is easily effected by\r\nplunging it into hot water.\r\n\r\nOther insects may be transfixed through the thorax or upper side of\r\nthe trunk; as also those _Coleoptera_, _Orthoptera_, and _Hemiptera_,\r\nwhose wings you are desirous of expanding; only you should be careful\r\nthat your pin passes through them _behind_ the _prothorax_.\r\n\r\nHaving impaled your insects, the next thing to be done is to _set_\r\nthem. The best time for doing this is not till they have begun to\r\nstiffen, but before they are become quite stiff. If attempted soon\r\nafter they are killed, the parts, unless you keep them in the intended\r\nposition by means of pins or braces, will not retain it; and if after\r\nthey are become too stiff, they are liable to be broken. Not only\r\nshould the antennæ and palpi be extended so as to be readily seen; but\r\nthe legs, and often the wings, ought to be placed in their natural\r\nposition; all of which tends much to the beauty of your specimens, and\r\nadapts them for more ready examination. But as this operation requires\r\ntime, and beauty and regularity may be purchased too dear if at the\r\nprice of hours called for by science, you may be left to your own\r\ndiscretion in this business, only you should always with a pin expand\r\nthe antennæ and palpi if possible. You might, however, both save your\r\ntime and have your insects neatly set, if you would take the trouble\r\nto instruct some acute and handy youth in your neighbourhood in the\r\n_modus operandi_, and devolve this department upon him: and as none are\r\nquicker and more expert in capturing insects than boys, he might also\r\nassist you in your hunting expeditions.\r\n\r\nI do not mean, however, to leave you at liberty with regard to the\r\nsetting of _Lepidopterous_ insects, which not only have a much worse\r\nappearance than those of other Orders if their wings be not regularly\r\nand uniformly expanded, but require it for the proper display of\r\ntheir characters. The necessary apparatus consists of a piece of cork\r\nabout nine inches long, four broad, and half an inch thick, which\r\nshould be made perfectly smooth, with a piece of white paper pasted\r\nover it; and of several narrow slips of card or braces, tapering\r\ngradually to a point, of different lengths, from half an inch to two\r\ninches or more, with a pin fixed in each at the broadest end. Thus\r\nprovided, you may proceed to action. But you must first decide whether,\r\nlike the continental Entomologists, you will set your _Lepidoptera_\r\nhorizontally; or, like the British, with their wings declining\r\nobliquely from the body. If you prefer the former method, the body must\r\nbe let into a groove, and the wings expanded as flatly as possible,\r\nthe anterior margin of the primary pair being brought forward so as\r\nto project beyond the head. But as this usually gives the insect an\r\nunnatural and formal appearance, I apprehend a man of your taste will\r\nprefer the mode adopted by your compatriots, the collectors of Britain,\r\nwho in setting make the wings form an angle, varying according to the\r\nsize and characters of the insect, with the body, and do not bring\r\nthe anterior wings so forward. The wings of butterflies however, in\r\norder to appear at all natural, should be set more horizontally. Which\r\nfashion soever you prefer, the mode of operating is nearly the same;\r\nonly that the English plan, except in the case of some large-bodied\r\nmoths or hawk-moths, requires no groove in the setting-board. After\r\nyou have stuck the insect upon the cork so as to bring its body close\r\nto its surface, stretch the anterior wing with a needle fixed in a\r\nhandle, or a camel's-hair pencil, applied to the joint at the base,\r\nsufficiently forward, and then confine it by means of one of your card\r\nbraces:--next, do the same by the opposite wing. Afterwards expand the\r\nposterior wings, which must not be separated from the anterior so as\r\nto leave any interval between them, and fix them with braces. When\r\nyou are become expert, you will find, if the fly is not large, that\r\na single brace will be sufficient for each pair of wings[1572]: but\r\nsometimes, if the card be not sufficiently stiff, you may confine it\r\nby a pin near the point. You must be careful in expanding the wings\r\nthat each is brought equally forward. Lastly, give the antennæ their\r\nproper position, and if necessary confine them with braces; and leave\r\nyour specimen in an airy situation to dry and stiffen. In a few days\r\nthe braces may be removed, and the specimen transferred to the cabinet.\r\nWhen you put them away to become stiff, you must be careful to place\r\nthem and your other insects at _night_ where earwigs cannot come at\r\nthem; for in sultry weather these animals will often then attack and\r\nspoil them.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this process can only be performed while the\r\njoints and ligaments of the insect are still flexible; so that\r\nsmall species, in warm weather, will often be immoveably rigid\r\nbefore you can have an opportunity of setting them. On this account\r\ncollectors usually set minute moths as soon as taken, which can be\r\nreadily done on the lid of a cork-lined box. But fortunately both\r\nthese, and specimens which have been dried for years, may be relaxed\r\nand rendered pliable by a very simple process. Fill a basin more\r\nthan half full of sand, and saturate it with water; pour off the\r\nsuperfluous water, and cover the sand with blotting-paper: into this\r\nstick the insects you wish to relax, and covering the basin closely,\r\nleave them there for two or three days, according to their size; and\r\nthe evaporation will render them sufficiently flexible for expansion\r\nor any other purpose. Beetles may be relaxed by plunging them for a\r\nshort time in warm water or spirits of wine[1573].\r\n\r\nMany moths of the tribe of _Tinea_ L. are so extremely minute,\r\nthat it is almost impossible to set them without defacing their\r\ncharacters: indeed, the trunk of some is so small as not to admit\r\nbeing pierced by a pin. These, therefore, it is adviseable merely\r\nto gum upon card, expanding their wings (which the gum will easily\r\nretain in their proper situation) with a camel's-hair pencil. If\r\nyou have two specimens, you may fix one in the natural position\r\nwhen at rest,--a method I should recommend with respect to other\r\n_Lepidoptera_, and indeed insects in general. Pezold advises that,\r\nby way of contrast, _white_ card should be used for _dark_-coloured\r\nspecies of these little moths, and _black_ for such as are _pale_.\r\nAs the wings of different _Coleopterous_ groups, as well as those of\r\n_Hymenoptera_, _Diptera_, &c., vary in their neuration[1574], you\r\nshould, whenever you can, set open the elytra and expand the wings of\r\none specimen at least in each group, which will be very important to\r\nyou in making out the characters of your genera.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficiently dried, your insects should be transferred from\r\nthe setting-boards, either to their place in your cabinet or to the\r\nstore-box before described, till you have leisure to investigate them.\r\n\r\nHowever tedious some of the foregoing manipulations may seem, they\r\nare in fact much less so than those required in several other\r\nbranches of Natural History, where, in addition to the labour of\r\ncatching, the nice and difficult task of clearing the skeleton of\r\nits muscular covering, and its internal cavity of its contents,\r\nand then of stuffing it and replacing its perished eyes by glass\r\nones of the proper colour, is a necessary process with every\r\nindividual. Happily the Entomologist, from the smallness of his game\r\nand the nature of their integument, is usually spared this labour.\r\nThere are some few insects, however, in which a process in some\r\ndegree analogous is requisite, if the beauty of the specimens be a\r\nconsideration. Thus the abdomen of _dragon-flies_ is very apt to lose\r\nits colour, and that of the _Meloës_ to shrink up, if left in their\r\nnatural state: these therefore should be eviscerated; which may be\r\ndone by slitting the abdomen longitudinally on the _under_ side, then\r\ncarefully removing its contents, and stuffing it with cotton. In the\r\nformer, a small straw or stalk of hay may be used, which will prevent\r\nthe fractures to which that part, when dry, is so liable. _Spiders_,\r\nand a few _apterous_ genera, as well as almost all _larvæ_, as they\r\nusually shrink up, in drying, into a shapeless mass, destitute of\r\nevery character dependent on colour or form, require to be preserved\r\nin a different manner. They may all be very well kept in rectified\r\nspirits of wine mixed with water, in the proportion of three parts of\r\nthe former to one of the latter. Each, suspended by a thread, should\r\nbe put in a separate very small labelled phial. Larger spiders, such\r\nas _Mygale aviculare_, &c., when suffered to dry, though the abdomen\r\nshrinks, do not wholly lose their characters, and are often kept in\r\ncabinets: but if preserved in spirits, they may be put into larger\r\nwide-mouthed bottles, suspended at different heights, with a label on\r\nthe outside opposite to each species. Mr. Abbott of Georgia had an\r\nexcellent method of preserving _caterpillars_, so that his specimens\r\nretain their colours and other attributes, and look as if they were\r\nalive. I am not acquainted with his process, but the following will\r\nanswer very well.--The animal must first be killed by immersion in\r\nspirits of wine; next you must eviscerate it, which is best effected\r\nby gradual pressure of the finger and thumb. You must begin at the\r\nhead, and so proceed till all the fluid contents of the body have\r\npassed out at the anus, which you may enlarge with a fine pair of\r\nscissors, being careful not to injure the anal prolegs. When you have\r\ncleared the skin as much as possible, introduce a fine glass tube, or\r\na piece of hay or slender straw into the anus, round which, as near\r\nto the extremity as may be, pass loosely a fine thread: then blowing\r\nthrough the tube, when the skin is fully inflated withdraw it, at the\r\nsame time pulling the thread tight and securing it by a knot. The\r\ncaterpillar will now exhibit its proper shape and colours; to retain\r\nwhich, all that is necessary is to hold it near the flame of a lamp\r\nuntil perfectly dry, which will be in a few minutes, when it may be\r\nplaced in the cabinet along with the imago to which it belongs[1575].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough a very large proportion of the insect inhabitants of any\r\ncountry may be captured in their _perfect_ state by the active\r\nEntomologist, yet there is no small number of them that probably he\r\nmay never meet with in that state, and to secure which he must have\r\nrecourse to other methods. He can procure _pupæ_ by digging for\r\nthem in woods, under trees, &c., as above directed[1576], keeping\r\nthem in some of their native earth till they are disclosed; or he\r\nmust collect _larvæ_, and _breed_ them; for which I shall now give\r\nyou some instructions.--The insects we are particularly concerned\r\nwith under this head are the caterpillars of _Lepidoptera_ and of\r\nthe saw-flies (_Serrifera_). If, however, in our entomological\r\nrambles we discover the larvæ of insects of _other_ Orders upon\r\ntheir appropriate food, we may often attempt to breed them with\r\nsuccess: but as you will seldom thus get species that you will not\r\nalso meet with in their imago state, and the general directions for\r\nbreeding will include almost all, I shall principally consider the\r\nbest mode of breeding _caterpillars_, and _pseudo-caterpillars_. The\r\nfirst thing is to collect them. In beating the trees, bushes, and\r\nplants, while hunting for _Coleoptera_, &c., the Entomologist will\r\noften displace caterpillars, which, if unknown, he should put into\r\na pill-box with a portion of their food: but _Lepidopterists_ often\r\nsally into the woods, &c., for the express purpose of collecting\r\nthese only. When engaged in this employment, the best plan is to\r\ntake a sheet with you, and when you mean to beat the branches of any\r\ntree, place it as near them as you can, upon four or more sticks\r\nfastened in the ground, so as to leave the upper surface concave, and\r\nit will receive the falling caterpillars when you beat. If you aim\r\nat the pseudo-caterpillars of the _Cimbicidæ_, you must turn your\r\nattention principally to the different species of sallows and willows\r\n(_Salix_). Your spoils you will put into boxes with their food, as\r\nabove directed, to bring them home.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of boxes recommended to receive them and\r\nbreed them in. If your only object is to get the perfect insect, a\r\ncubical box of moderate dimensions, glazed in front or on one side\r\nto enable you to watch their proceedings, with the other sides and\r\ntop fitted with fine canvass for the admission of air, will very\r\nwell answer this purpose; or your box may be canvassed all round,\r\nwith a door in front[1577]. In this you may place a small garden-pot\r\nfilled with earth, with a phial of water plunged in it to receive the\r\ninsects' food. This may be moved, when you wish to change the water,\r\nwithout disturbing the earth, which should be kept somewhat moist.\r\nThe earth is for those caterpillars whose pupæ are subterranean. But\r\nas you will probably wish to proceed scientifically, and ascertain\r\nprecisely the moth that comes from each caterpillar, I should\r\nstrongly recommend to you a box invented by Mr. Stephens, which he\r\ndescribes in a letter to me in nearly these words:--\"The length of\r\nthe box is 20 inches, height 12, and breadth 6; and it is divided\r\ninto _five_ compartments. Its lower half is constructed intirely\r\nof wood, and the upper of coarse gauze stretched upon wooden or\r\nwire frames: each compartment has a separate door, and is moreover\r\nfurnished with a phial in the centre for the purpose of containing\r\nwater, in which the food is kept fresh; and is half-filled with\r\na mixture of fine earth and the dust from the inside of rotten\r\ntrees; the latter article being added for the purpose of rendering\r\nthe former less binding upon the pupæ, as well as being highly\r\nimportant for the use of such larvæ as construct their cocoons of\r\nrotten wood. The chief advantages of a breeding cage of the above\r\nconstruction are, the occupation of less room than five separate\r\ncages, and a diminution of expense; both important considerations\r\nwhen any person is engaged extensively in rearing insects. Whatever\r\nbe the construction of the box, it is highly necessary that the\r\nlarvæ be constantly supplied with fresh food, and that the earth at\r\nthe bottom should be kept damp. To accomplish the latter object,\r\nI keep a thick layer of moss upon the surface, which I take out\r\noccasionally (perhaps once a week during hot weather, and once a\r\nfortnight or three weeks in winter), and saturate completely with\r\nwater, and return it to its place: this keeps up a sufficient supply\r\nof moisture, without allowing the earth to become too wet, which is\r\nequally injurious to the pupæ with too much aridity. By numbering the\r\ncells, and keeping a register corresponding with the numbers, the\r\nhistory of any particular larva or brood may be traced.\"\r\n\r\nIn attending to your insects in their cells, your expectations will\r\nsometimes be disappointed, when, instead of a butterfly or moth,\r\nyou find only an _Ichneumon_. But this you must not regard as _all_\r\nmisfortune; for by this means you will be better instructed in the\r\nhistory of each species, and learn to the attack of what enemies it\r\nis exposed: and thus you may get many species of these parasitic\r\ndevourers of insects that you would not elsewhere meet with. If your\r\ncaterpillars, however, appear to be of a rare kind, you must watch,\r\nand often examine them; and if you discover black specks upon any\r\none, that appear unnatural or like nits, they may be extracted, Mr.\r\nHaworth assures us[1578], by a pair of small pliers; and if the\r\noperation is adroitly performed, the caterpillar will recover and do\r\nwell. You will often meet Lepidopterous larvæ travelling over roads\r\nand pathways: at such times they have usually done feeding, and are\r\nseeking a spot in which they may assume the pupa with safety. These\r\nyou may place in one of your cells, and they will select a station\r\nfor themselves. You must be careful frequently to examine the boxes\r\nin which you have pupæ, that you may take the imago as soon as it\r\nappears, and before it has had time to injure itself in attempting to\r\nescape. I mentioned to you on a former occasion Reaumur's experiments\r\nto accelerate the appearance of the butterfly[1579];--there is\r\nanother still more remarkable, to which he had recourse for this\r\npurpose: it was by hatching his pupæ under a _hen_!! You will wonder,\r\nperhaps, how this could be effected, and be disposed to maintain\r\nthat the pupæ must be crushed by the weight of the brooding animal.\r\nHow did the ingenious and illustrious experimentalist prevent this?\r\nHe prepared a hollow ball of glass, open at one end, about the\r\nshape and size of a turkey's egg. Having several chrysalises of the\r\nnettle-butterfly (_Vanessa Urticæ_) suspended to a piece of paper,\r\nhe cut out some of these singly, with a square portion of the paper\r\nattached to them, and covered with paste the side opposite to that\r\nfrom which the chrysalis was suspended: these he introduced into the\r\nball through the aperture, placing them as near to each other as\r\npossible, taking care so to apply the pasted surface to the inside of\r\nthe ball, that when the side to which they were fixed was uppermost\r\nthey all hung as from a vault. This being done, he stopped the\r\naperture with a linen plug, but not so completely as to cut off all\r\ncommunication with the atmosphere: he next placed the egg under a hen\r\nthat had been sitting some days, who always kept it at the side of\r\nthe nest, where it nevertheless derived benefit from her incubation.\r\nAfter the first day its interior was covered with vapour transpired\r\nby the chrysalises. Upon this Reaumur took the egg, and removing the\r\nlinen plug it soon became dry again: he replaced it under the hen,\r\nand no vapour afterwards appeared. In about _four_ days the first\r\nbutterfly ever hatched under a hen made its appearance; it would\r\nprobably have required _fourteen_ under ordinary circumstances. He\r\ntried the same experiment with some Dipterous pupæ; but the heat was\r\ntoo great for them, and they all perished[1580].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving properly prepared and set your specimens as above directed,\r\nthe next step, when they have remained a sufficient time to be\r\nperfectly dry, is to place them in your cabinet. If you collect\r\n_foreign_ insects as well as British, you may either preserve\r\nthe latter in a separate cabinet, or keep both in the same,\r\ndistinguishing the indigenous species by a particular mark. The\r\nletter B in red ink, if the pin which transfixes the insect be run\r\nthrough it, or, in the case of _Lepidoptera_, placed before the\r\nspecimen, would be a very distinct and sufficient indication of\r\nthem. The drawers of your cabinets should be about 18 inches square,\r\nand from the glass to the corked bottom about an inch and a half in\r\ndepth: but the larger _Dynastidæ_, as _Megasoma Actæon_, &c., will\r\nrequire _two_ inches. The frame of the glass should be rabbeted\r\nunderneath; and parallel with the sides of the drawer, but a little\r\nlower, there should be inner side-pieces fixed, so as to form a\r\ncavity all round of a proper width to closely receive the rabbet,\r\nand likewise to contain the camphor for preserving your insects from\r\nthe attack of mites, &c.; to emit the scent of which, many holes\r\nshould be bored in the side-pieces. Each cabinet may contain _forty_\r\nof these drawers in a double series, protected by folding doors; and\r\nyou may place one cabinet upon another, if your space admits it. You\r\nwill find a tool used by bell-hangers for cutting their wire very\r\nconvenient to behead or otherwise curtail the pins, as those with\r\nwhich foreign insects are transfixed are often too long. If you cut\r\nthem off below the insect, cut them obliquely, which will leave a\r\npoint that will enter the cork.\r\n\r\nWhen your drawers are _smoothly_ corked[1581] and neatly papered,\r\nfirst divide each transversely by a _full_ black line; parallel with\r\nthis, on each side, draw a line with red ink: then, for arranging\r\nyour insects, draw _pencil_ lines, which are easily obliterated, at\r\nright angles with the others, according to the general size of the\r\ninsects that are to occupy them. Insects look better thus arranged\r\nin double columns, than if the pencil lines traversed the whole\r\nwidth of the drawers. In arranging them, you may either place them\r\nin a straight line _between_ the pencil lines,--which I think is\r\nbest,--or _upon_ them. You will begin your columns from the red\r\nlines in the middle, and not from the sides of the drawer; thus the\r\nheads of those on one side of it will be in an opposite direction\r\nto those on the other. Where your pins are very fine and weak, you\r\nmust make a hole first with a common lace-pin; otherwise, in forcing\r\nthem into the cork, they will bend. In labelling your specimens, you\r\nshould stick the appellation of the genus or subgenus with a pin\r\nbefore the species that belong to it. As to the species themselves,\r\nyou may either number them 1, 2, 3, &c., sticking the pin they are\r\nupon through the number, and denoting them by a corresponding one\r\nin your catalogue; or you may at once write the trivial name, with\r\nthe initial of the genus upon a label transfixed in the same manner.\r\n_Lepidoptera_ cannot easily be arranged in columns. Perhaps if\r\n_squares_, corresponding with the size and number of the specimens\r\nof any given species you wish to preserve, were made with pencil, a\r\nlabel of the trivial name of the species, or a number being placed\r\nat its head, it would be as good a way as any other. But every one\r\nmust be left to his own taste in these matters. Wherever you can,\r\nprocure a specimen of each _sex_ of an insect, and where _important_\r\ncharacters require it, let some of your Lepidopterous specimens\r\nexhibit the _under side_ of the wings.\r\n\r\nIn arranging insects in your cabinet, if you wish to have it\r\nscientific, as much as the nature of the subject will admit, follow\r\nthe series of _affinities_; but you may reserve a few drawers to\r\nplace in contrast _analogous_ forms. As your numbers of species\r\nincrease you will have to alter your arrangement; but as pencil lines\r\nare easily rubbed out, this will occasion you less trouble than if\r\nthey were drawn with ink. You should always be careful under each\r\ngenus to leave space for new species.\r\n\r\nAs certain _Acarina_, _Tineidæ_, _Ptinidæ_, &c., prey upon dead\r\ninsects, you will of course wish to know how they may be kept out of\r\nyour drawers, or banished when detected there. _Camphor_ is the general\r\nremedy recommended. The cavity closed by the rabbet of the glass frame\r\naffords a good receptacle for this necessary article: put some roughly\r\npowdered into each side, and be careful to renew it when evaporated.\r\nThis will generally preserve your insects, as will be seen from the\r\nresult of the following experiment.--Some insects in a chip box having\r\nbecome much infested by mites and _Psocus pulsatorius_, I placed under\r\na wine-glass several of each along with roughly-powdered camphor: at\r\nthe end of twenty-four hours the mites were alive; but at the end of\r\nforty-eight they were all apparently dead, and did not revive upon the\r\nremoval of the camphor. The specimens of _Psocus_ all appeared dead in\r\nan hour, and never revived. If the camphor be put only into one side of\r\na drawer, and in a lump, though perhaps it may keep out mites, &c., it\r\nwill not expel them.\r\n\r\n                                                  I am, &c.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1554] _Entomologist's Useful Compendium._ _t._ xi. _f._ 5.\r\n\r\n[1555] PLATE XXIV.

Thus only can he\r\nhimself derive profit from any discoveries he may make, or contribute\r\nto the further progress of the science[1582].\r\n\r\nBut in order to accomplish this object effectually, you must remember\r\nand practise the _Onslow_ motto--_Festina lente_:--you must not be\r\ntoo eager to name your _species_, but begin first with _grouping_\r\nyour collection. The only way to acquire, in any degree, a correct\r\nknowledge of the Natural System, or of the general plan of the\r\nCREATOR, which is the _primum_ and _ultimum_ of true science, is by\r\nstudying _groups_. The knowledge of species is indeed indispensable\r\nfor the registry of facts and other practical purposes, but the\r\nknowledge of groups leads to a higher wisdom; and indeed it is\r\nthrough these that we best descend to the study of species.\r\n\r\nI will suppose you have made yourself master of so much of the\r\ntechnical language, particularly the names and most important\r\nattributes of the principal organs of insects, as will suffice for\r\nunderstanding descriptions, or knowing these parts when you see them.\r\nI will also further suppose that what was formerly said on these\r\nsubjects has been sufficiently studied, to enable you without much\r\ndifficulty or hesitation to say whether any given object belongs to\r\nthe Class _Insecta_ or _Arachnida_, or to which of their respective\r\nOrders[1583]. You are therefore qualified to arrange your collection\r\ninto its _primary_ groups. But you have seen that many _others_\r\nintervene between the Order and the genus or species. As the _genera_\r\nof Linné are mostly primary groups of Orders, perhaps, setting aside\r\nsuch insects included in them by him as your eye and their apparent\r\ncharacters convince you have no claim to a place there, your next best\r\nstep would be to make yourself thoroughly acquainted with them. When\r\nyou have accurately marshalled and intimately studied these groups,\r\nyou will probably have acquired an eye and a tact, _experto crede_,\r\nfor grouping without book, and may proceed by analysis to resolve your\r\nwhole collection, as nearly as possible, into as many as nature seems\r\nto indicate to you. In doing this you will doubtless at first fall\r\ninto many errors; but these, practice and a closer examination will\r\nin time enable you to rectify. Having thus got your groups as near\r\nto nature as you can, you may now have recourse to those authors,\r\nparticularly Fabricius and Latreille, who have subdivided the genera\r\nof Linné; and you will see which of your groups agree with theirs,\r\ndetect your own errors, and often theirs, and be enabled to label each\r\nof your genera and higher groups, if already known, with its modern\r\nappellation. You are now qualified also to enter scientifically into\r\nthe study of the _characters_ that distinguish groups, and may proceed,\r\nwherever opportunity is afforded, to examine the _trophi_, which may\r\noften be displayed sufficiently by the means recommended in my last\r\nletter[1584]. In this way you may learn also to know your groups as\r\nwell by character as by habit, and be qualified to trace the gradual\r\nprogress of nature from form to form; and may look upon yourself as\r\nduly prepared to put the last hand to your labours, and proceed to the\r\nexamination of _species_.\r\n\r\nIt will have occurred to you, in making out your genera or _lowest_\r\ngroups, that some consist of a vastly greater number of species than\r\nothers. It seems advisable therefore, when you apply yourself seriously\r\nto ascertain what described ones your cabinet contains, to begin with\r\nthose genera which appear to be poor in them; for here your labour\r\nwill be comparatively light, from the small number you will have to\r\nexamine; and you will become practised in the employment before you\r\nare called upon to attack those that overflow. Had Fabricius and other\r\ndescribers of species taken the trouble to subdivide the larger groups,\r\nas might easily have been done, into more _genera_ and _subgenera_,\r\nthe student would have been spared a most discouraging labour. To be\r\nobliged to compare a single individual with the descriptions of from\r\n100 to 300 species[1585], to ascertain its name, seems enough to make\r\nyou start aside with horror from the employment, and be content that\r\nyour species should remain unnamed, rather than expose yourself to such\r\na waste of time and patience. But to lessen your alarm and encourage\r\nyou to proceed, I must observe to you, though in a few instances it\r\nmay be necessary to advert to the description of every single species\r\nin a section, yet that this is seldom requisite; and where it is,\r\nthere are many helps to diminish the labour and abridge the process.\r\nA large number of insects are characterized by their _colour_; and\r\nit is the practice of all good describers to begin their definition\r\nof the species with that which predominates, and then to enumerate\r\nthe variations from it. Thus, if an insect be all _black_ except the\r\n_thorax_, _antennæ_, and _legs_, you will find it thus characterized,\r\n\"_Black_: _with thorax, antennæ, and legs ferruginous_\"; and so on.\r\nHence, having noticed the predominant colour of your unknown species,\r\nin many genera you may compare it with the descriptions contained in a\r\nwhole page at a single glance, and only read the further descriptions\r\nwhen the colour agrees. A practised Entomologist will thus investigate\r\nhis insects with a rapidity which to an unlearned bystander would seem\r\nimpossible. Though I have instanced _colour_ as being the character\r\nmost commonly employed in describing species of insects, you will\r\nreadily conceive that in some tribes other characters afford more\r\nprominent distinctions. Thus in the _Dynastidæ_ and many other\r\nPetalocerous beetles, the principal specific character is derived\r\nfrom the _horns_ or _tubercles_ that arm the head and thorax: in\r\n_Lucanus_ from the _mandibulæ_; and in _Prionus_ from the marginal\r\n_teeth_ of the thorax. If the insect, then, you want to name belongs\r\nto any of these genera, having observed its peculiar characters in\r\nthis respect, you may ascertain in a very few minutes whether any\r\nalready described exhibit the same. This facility of investigation can\r\nbe better acquired by practice than precept, and cannot be attained\r\nall at once. The above hints, however, may be of some use; and cannot\r\nfail to be so, if you always endeavour to make yourself acquainted by\r\na previous careful examination with the characters of every new insect\r\nyou acquire,--whether those of form, colour, or sculpture,--before you\r\nattempt to discover its name in Fabricius or any other author.\r\n\r\nWhen you have made such proficiency in the study as to be familiar\r\nwith a few species of each section of an extensive genus, the labour\r\nof investigation will sometimes be greatly facilitated by attending\r\nto that conformity between the proportions, general aspect, and\r\nfigure of a known and an unknown insect, which Naturalists express\r\nby the name of _habit_, and which, though easily perceived by\r\na practised eye, is described with such difficulty. Scientific\r\nEntomologists in their descriptions have usually taken care to place\r\nnear to each other, species agreeing in habit. When therefore you\r\nknow the name of one species, and find another of the same general\r\nhabit, you may commonly take it for granted that if described at all\r\nby your author, it will be placed near that already known to you.\r\nThus, supposing you are acquainted with that common weevil _Cionus\r\nScrophulariæ_, and find its near relation _C. Blattariæ_; instead\r\nof comparing it one by one with the 161 species which compose the\r\n_Longirostres femoribus dentatis_ of the Fabrician genus _Rhynchænus_\r\nin the _Systema Eleutheratorum_, you would at once turn to the\r\nformer, very near which you would without further trouble discover\r\nit. Fortunate, would it be, could the Entomologist always depend on\r\nthus finding descriptions of allied species in the neighbourhood\r\nof each other; but unhappily the most distinguished authors have\r\nsometimes violated this important rule, so that we cannot always be\r\ncertain that any given species is not elsewhere described than in\r\nits right place. Fabricius in many instances often removes widely\r\nasunder insects not merely related, but which are in reality scarcely\r\nmore than varieties of the same species[1586]. In fact, the attention\r\nof this celebrated author was so distracted by the immensity of the\r\nmaterials he had to arrange, by the distance of the cabinets, in many\r\ncases, from each other, the new species of which he undertook to\r\ndescribe, and the rapidity with which they necessarily passed under\r\nhis eye, that he seems never to have attained any nice perception of\r\nthe _affinities_ of insects.\r\n\r\nYou must not conclude, however, that the investigation of a new\r\ninsect is even to an adept always a work of ease and dispatch.\r\nOften, when seemingly ascertained by the rapid process above\r\nindicated, a further inquiry will be requisite; the more detailed\r\ndescription must be read, and figures consulted, before its name can\r\nbe indisputably determined. In addition to the difficulty arising\r\nfrom the insufficient characters frequently given by Fabricius and\r\nthe older authors, obstacles arising from their errors not seldom\r\nintervene. Thus they have sometimes selected for a _specific_\r\ncharacter,--as in the case of _Megachile centuncularis_, _Nomada\r\nruficornis_, and various other insects,--what really only indicates\r\na _family_. At other times _sexual_ characters common to many,--as\r\nin _Eucera longicornis_, _Locusta perspicillata_, &c.,--have\r\nbeen had recourse to. In these cases, in order satisfactorily to\r\nascertain your species, you must further consult the _synonyms_ and\r\n_habitat_ given by the original describer, especially the figures\r\nhe has referred to. When all these fail, as they sometimes will,\r\nthe _dernier resort_ is a reference to the cabinet containing the\r\noriginal specimen from which the description was drawn. British\r\nEntomologists possess an invaluable privilege, which their\r\ncontinental brethren may well envy them, in having the most liberal\r\naccess, indulged to them by the learned President of the Linnean\r\nSociety, to Linné's collection of insects, from which a large\r\nproportion of the species he described may be ascertained[1587].\r\nSeveral of the cabinets, especially the Banksian,--now the property\r\nof the Linnean Society,--from which Fabricius described his insects,\r\nmay also still be consulted; and thus many mistakes rectified, which\r\nwould otherwise greatly mislead[1588].\r\n\r\nThough sometimes the limits that separate good species appear at\r\nfirst very slight, and require a practised eye to catch them, yet\r\nit occasionally happens that considerable apparent differences\r\nmay safely be disregarded. The _colour_ of insects,--to which\r\nunhappily for want of better characters we are so generally forced\r\nto have recourse,--though usually constant, is in some species very\r\nvariable[1589]. This is the case sometimes with _whole_ colours.\r\nThus _Carabus arvensis_, _Pœcilus cupreus_, &c., are sometimes of a\r\ncopper colour; at others, resemble brass; at others, they are green\r\nor blue, and even black. The colour of _spots_ also often varies.\r\nIn some individuals of _Pentatoma oleracea_ they are pale, and in\r\nothers red. The number and shape of spots are also often inconstant.\r\nMany of the species of _Coccinella_ so abound in these variations,\r\nthat nothing short of the most careful examination can enable you\r\nto distinguish the species from the variety. Insects vary also in\r\n_size_: but as this is never assumed as a specific character, it will\r\nnot occasion you much trouble. Where the difference in this respect\r\nbetween two specimens is very great, the presumption is that they are\r\nspecifically distinct. Differences in _sculpture_ and _proportion_\r\ndo not always indicate different _species_; this being sometimes, as\r\nwe have seen above, only a _sexual_ character[1590]. Authors also\r\nin their descriptions, in this respect sometimes mislead the young\r\nstudent. When Linné calls the _thorax_ of _Aphodius erraticus_ smooth\r\n(_lævis_) he would not expect to find it covered with impressed\r\npuncta, and with a longitudinal posterior impressed line. Likewise\r\nin describing _Chlænius vestitus_ and _nigricornis_, Fabricius\r\npasses without notice their punctate surface, so different from that\r\nof other _Harpalidæ_. Errors of this kind however, it is but fair\r\nto observe, are chiefly to be attributed to the circumstance that\r\nboth Linné and Fabricius rarely employed a _microscope_ in making\r\ndescriptions; though no one now attempts this, except where insects\r\nare large, without such an aid.\r\n\r\nIf you ask, How am I to acquire this delicacy of tact which is to\r\ndecide when the terms of a specific character are to be rigidly\r\nadhered to, and when taken with a certain latitude? I answer, In the\r\nsame way in which a connoisseur attains the faculty of discerning\r\nthe works of different masters in painting;--by such careful study\r\nof your author as will make you master of his style. Thus you will\r\nsoon perceive in what cases expressions are to be taken literally and\r\nstrictly, or with some allowance and abatement.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains more distinctly to be adverted to, the assistance\r\nthat may be derived in the investigation of insects from _figures_.\r\nGenerally speaking, these should never be referred to in the first\r\ninstance, but be regarded as a resource when the ordinary methods leave\r\nthe subject of inquiry doubtful. Those who begin their entomological\r\nstudies by turning over figures usually end them there, and never\r\nattain to that nameless tact in making out insects that can only\r\nbe the result of patient study. Indeed figures, though often very\r\nuseful, and sometimes indispensable, can scarcely ever exhibit those\r\nnice characters, particularly as to sculpture, that distinguish some\r\ninsects. Our modern artists, indeed, are remedying this defect of the\r\nart, by giving in many cases the thorax or elytrum apart, with all its\r\nsculptural peculiarities: but this is not, and cannot be, done so as\r\nto represent every one. But though in general figures should be your\r\nlast resort, I know not whether an exception to the rule may not be\r\nadvisable with respect to the _Lepidoptera_, which are more difficult\r\nto be intelligibly described than any other order of insects; while a\r\ngood figure exhibits to the eye all those markings and shades, that\r\nscarcely any description can place clearly before the mind.\r\n\r\nWhen every attempt to investigate the name of your unknown species\r\nfails, and you have consequently reason to believe that it is\r\nundescribed, the best mode you can pursue for retaining that knowledge\r\nof its characters, which from your long investigation you must have\r\nacquired, is to note them down in your _entomological journal_,\r\ninserting it under its proper genus with a trivial name of your own.\r\nSuch a journal you will find almost a _sine qua non_ for containing a\r\ncatalogue of your insects, and to register any observations concerning\r\nindividuals you may have had an opportunity of making. With regard to\r\nthis journal, I should recommend to you to get two blank books. One a\r\nduodecimo of 200 or 300 pages, to contain the mere catalogue of your\r\ninsects, their habitat and localities, or the source from which you\r\nderived them. In this you should number the genera in Roman capitals,\r\nand the species under each by a figure; leaving considerable space\r\nat the end of each genus for the insertion of new species. The other\r\nbook should be of an octavo size, containing 400 or 500 pages. Under\r\nthe number of each genus and species you might describe and figure\r\nit, if undescribed; if described, note in what it varies from the\r\ndescription, and what characters are overlooked: and in general, insert\r\nsuch observations, with regard to its economy and habits, as you may\r\nhave had an opportunity of making.--As to foreign insects, wherever you\r\ncan, upon _good_ authority, be particular in indicating the country and\r\nstation of each specimen.\r\n\r\nI need not say much to you concerning the microscopes you should use\r\nfor the examination of insects, a common pocket one of three glasses\r\nof different powers will answer every ordinary purpose[1591].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have treated hitherto of insects as we find them now inhabiting\r\nour globe: but I must not conclude our correspondence without taking\r\nsome notice of those that are found in a _fossil_ state. Fossil\r\ninsects may be divided into those that are found in _amber_, and\r\nthose that are found in _other_ substances.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed with respect to insectiferous amber, that the\r\ngreater part of the insects found in it exist no longer in the\r\ncountries that produce that amber, and that in every different\r\nlocality the insects found in it are different. Thus the amber\r\nof Sicily contains various species of _Coleoptera_ not to be met\r\nwith in other ambers, while that of the Baltic is rich in _Diptera_\r\nand _Neuroptera_[1592]. It is further observed, that the insects\r\ninclosed in the amber of Prussia, and those figured by Sendelius in\r\nhis _Historia Succinorum_, all belong to genera at this time found\r\nin Europe[1593]. Insects of the following genera are recorded as\r\nhaving been found in this singular substance: _Platypus_, _Elater_,\r\n_Atractocerus_; _Gryllus_, _Mantis_; larvæ of _Lepidoptera_;\r\n_Trichoptera_; _Ephemera_, _Perla_, _Termes_; _Formica_; _Tipula_,\r\n_Bibio_, _Empis_; _Scolopendra_; and various _Arachnida_[1594].\r\nIn a piece of amber in my collection I find _Evania_, _Formica_,\r\n_Chironomus_, and some _Arachnida_.\r\n\r\nFossil insects have also been found in other substances. Parkinson\r\nfigures larvæ of _Libellulina_ found in limestone[1595]; some\r\n_Melolonthæ_ in slate; a _Polistes_ in schistus; _Carabi_ and\r\n_Necrobia_ in vegetable debris: but some of these rather belong to a\r\ncomparatively modern formation[1596].\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI observed in the outset of our correspondence, that we were entering\r\nan august temple, exhibiting in its inmost sanctuary the symbols of\r\nthe Divine Presence[1597]. In proportion as we have penetrated, glory\r\nfrom that Shechinah has more and more shone forth: and whether we\r\nhave considered the uses of insects, their ways and instincts, their\r\nforms and structure, and their arrangement in a wondrous and complex\r\nsystem, the WISDOM, POWER and GOODNESS of their and our CREATOR have\r\nevery where been marvellously conspicuous, and calculated to awaken\r\nin us every devotional feeling. If, indeed, we admire and study\r\nthese little creatures, or any other department of nature, without\r\nreference to their CREATOR, and collect and love them merely for\r\n_themselves_, we shall be in some sense idolaters, and, like the\r\nancient world, put the _works_ of GOD in his place. But if, while\r\nwe admire them and store them up and study them, we see in them his\r\nglory reflected, and in the _creature_ love the CREATOR, the study of\r\nthem, in conjunction with that of the written Word, will be highly\r\nbeneficial to us, and at the same time that it ministers to our\r\ntemporal enjoyment will promote our eternal interests.\r\n\r\nTaking this view, I cannot better close our correspondence on the\r\nsubject that has so long occupied us, than in the pious words of one\r\nof our most admired poets:\r\n\r\n    \"Happy if full of days--but happier far,\r\n     If, ere we yet discern life's evening star,\r\n     Sick of the service of a world that feeds\r\n     Its patient drudges with dry chaff and weeds,\r\n     We can escape from custom's idiot sway,\r\n     To serve the Sovereign we were born t' obey.\r\n     Then sweet to muse upon his skill display'd\r\n     (Infinite skill) in all that he has made!\r\n     To trace, in Nature's most minute design,\r\n     The signature and stamp of pow'r divine,\r\n     Contrivance intricate, express'd with ease,\r\n     Where unassisted sight no beauty sees,\r\n     The shapely limb and lubricated joint,\r\n     Within the small dimensions of a point,\r\n     Muscle and nerve miraculously spun,\r\n     His mighty work, who speaks and it is done,\r\n     Th' Invisible in things scarce seen reveal'd,\r\n     To whom an atom is an ample field:\r\n     To wonder at a thousand insect forms,\r\n     These hatch'd, and those resuscitated worms,\r\n     New life ordain'd and brighter scenes to share,\r\n     Once prone on earth, now buoyant upon air,\r\n     Whose shape would make them, had they bulk and size,\r\n     More hideous foes than fancy can devise;\r\n     With helmet-heads and dragon-scales adorn'd,\r\n     The mighty myriads, now securely scorn'd,\r\n     Would mock the majesty of man's high birth,\r\n     Despise his bulwarks, and unpeople earth:\r\n     Then with a glance of fancy to survey,\r\n     Far as the faculty can stretch away,\r\n     Ten thousand rivers pour'd at his command\r\n     From urns that never fail through every land;\r\n     These like a deluge with impetuous force,\r\n     Those winding modestly a silent course;\r\n     The cloud-surmounting alps, the fruitful vales;\r\n     Seas on which every nation spreads her sails;\r\n     The sun, a world whence other worlds drink light;\r\n     The crescent moon, the diadem of night;\r\n     Stars countless, each in his appointed place,\r\n     Fast anchor'd in the deep abyss of space:--\r\n     At such a sight to catch the poet's flame,\r\n     And with a rapture like his own exclaim,\r\n     These are thy glorious works, thou source of good!\r\n     How dimly seen, how faintly understood!\r\n     Thine, and upheld by thy paternal care,\r\n     This universal frame, thus wondrous fair;\r\n     Thy power divine, and bounty beyond thought,\r\n     Adored and praised in all that thou hast wrought.\r\n     Absorb'd in that immensity I see,\r\n     I shrink abas'd, and yet aspire to thee;\r\n     Instruct me, guide me to that heavenly day,\r\n     Thy words, more clearly than thy works, display,\r\n     That, while thy truths my grosser thoughts refine,\r\n     I may resemble thee, and call thee mine.[1598]\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1582] Compare what is said VOL.

Quamvis enim inter sexûs organa vertebratorum\r\nanimalium et insectorum analogia haud parva locum habet; numero\r\ntamen, figura et proportione partium, miro modo sæpius differunt; et\r\norgana insuper plura in insectis reperiuntur quorum in vertebratis\r\nexempla frustra quæsiveris.\r\n\r\nHoc argumentum tractando duo sunt imprimis consideranda, _genitalia_\r\nnempe ipsa utriusque sexûs, et _coitus_.\r\n\r\nI. De _genitalibus_ in genere prima observatio erit, \"quo minor\r\nhorum, habita corporis ratione, moles, eo magis nervorum systema,\r\net cephalicum imprimis ganglium, predominans fit; eo major igitur\r\nintellectûs facultas (instincto naturali consociata) reperitur,\"\r\nut in principibus, _Apibus_ nempe, _Formica_, &c.[1599] In\r\n_Hymenopteris_, iterum, _Dipteris_, et _Neuropteris_, hæc organa\r\nmaxime retracta sunt; dum in _Lepidopteris_, _Coleopteris_, et\r\n_Orthopteris_ (quorum insuper mascula et feminea insigniter inter\r\nse congruunt[1600]), magis exserta jacent[1601]. Genitalia plerumque\r\nin extremitate postica abdominis sub _ano_ sita sunt[1602], sed\r\nin _Arachnidis_ et _Libellulinis_ masculis in basi _ventris_, in\r\n_Phalangio_ sub _ore_, et in _Chilognathis_ in anteriore corporis\r\nparte subtus latitant[1603]. Ubi organa duplicantur, ut _testes_,\r\nsemper symmetrica sunt. Non obliviscendum est quòd in diversis\r\ngeneribus habitu externo persimili consociatis, imò in diversis unius\r\ngeneris speciebus genitalia diversa interdum reperiuntur[1604]: sic\r\nin Lamellicornibus _stercorariis_ (_Scarabæus_, _Copris_, &c.),\r\ntestes tantummodo sunt _duo_; in _arboreis_ (_Melolontha_, &c.)\r\n_duodecim_, et in _floralibus_ (_Cetonia_, &c.) _viginti-quatuor_.\r\n\r\nGenitalia sunt vel _mascula_ vel _feminea_.\r\n\r\ni. Genitalia _mascula_, sunt _penis_; _canalis excretorius_; _vesiculæ\r\nseminales_; _vasa deferentia_; _testes_; _prehensores_; et _semen_.\r\n\r\n1. _Penis_[1605] quoad _substantiam_ plerumque membranaceus, at\r\ninterdum corneus est, et intus cavernosus[1606]; in _Coleopteris_\r\napice vagina bivalvi vulvam aperiente instructus est[1607]: _figura_\r\nvariat admodum, sæpius tamen cylindricus vel subcylindricus est;\r\nin _Blattis_ apicem versus sensim attenuatus[1608]; in _Cherme\r\nPyri_ capitatus[1609]; in _Vespa vulgari_ cochleariformis[1610]; in\r\n_Crabrone_ bilobus[1611]; in _Poliste gallica_? incurvus et apice\r\nbicornis[1612]; in _Sarcophaga carnaria_ apice spinosus[1613];\r\nin _Megachile muraria_ difformis[1614]; in _Tyrophaga Casei_ et\r\nquibusdam aliis _Muscidis_, spiralis[1615]; in _Cordulia ænea_\r\net _Phalangio_ biarticulatus[1616]. Utplurimum nudus est, sed in\r\n_Tephrite_ fimbriatus. In insectis proprie dictis _simplex_ est hoc\r\norganon, in _Scorpionibus_ autem _duplex_ evadit; quod fit etiam in\r\nquibusdam reptilibus, _Serpentibus_ nempe et _Lacertis_[1617].\r\n\r\n2. _Canalis excretorius_ e concursu vesicularum seminalium formatur,\r\net a _pene_ excipitur in quo terminat et cui semen reddit; interdum\r\nbrevissimus est, ut in _Blatta_[1618], et interdum iterum prælongus,\r\nut in _Blapte Mortisaga_, _Tyrophaga Casei_, et aliis[1619].\r\nPlerumque cylindricus est, musculosus, compactus, et externe tracheis\r\npertextus[1620].\r\n\r\n3. _Vesiculæ seminales_ conniventes formant, ut jam dictum est,\r\ncanalem excretorium communem cujus prolongatio bifida esse videntur;\r\nvasa deferentia hinc excipiunt. Interdum vasa hæc ac vesiculæ\r\nseminales eodem loco in canali excretorio communi terminant, unde\r\ncanalis hic tumidior fit[1621]. Vesiculæ supradictæ maxime variant:\r\nmodo canalem exhibent ventricosum, tortum, implexum, longissimum;\r\nmodo rectum, breviorem. In plerisque _duæ_ sunt vesiculæ seminales,\r\netiam in _Lepidopteris_ monorchidis; in quibusdam (_Tenebrione\r\nMolitore_, _Hydrophilo piceo_) _quatuor_[1622]; in aliis\r\n(_Dytisco marginali_) _sex_[1623]; et, in _Locustis_ et _Blatta_,\r\n_plurimæ_[1624]. Breves admodum sunt in _Orthopteris_ et quibusdam\r\n_Coleopteris_[1625]; sed in aliis longissimæ; in _Orycte nasicorni_\r\nvicies, et in _Cetonia aurata_ ter decies corpus longitudine\r\nsuperant[1626]. In hisce organis semen e testibus per vasa deferentia\r\nacceptum ante emissionem elaboratur.\r\n\r\n4. _Vasa deferentia_ ita appellantur quia semen e testibus acceptum\r\nad vesiculas seminales _deferunt_. Ex utroque teste unum vas deferens\r\nexit, et si utrinque plures sint testes, ut in _Melolontha_[1627],\r\n_Cetonia_, &c., omnia ad unicum utrinque canalem formandum\r\nconfluunt, qui vesiculis supradictis semen reddit: interdum, ut in\r\n_Lepidopteris_[1628], ab his nullo modo separantur, unum canalem aut\r\ntubum formantia; sed in aliis penitus sunt distincta[1629]. Ex eodem\r\nfilo quo contexuntur testes vasa deferentia sæpius deducuntur.\r\n\r\n5. _Testes_ organa sunt semen primum secernentia: variant\r\n_compositione_, _numero_, et _figura_. In quibusdam (_Lepidopteris_\r\net _Hymenopteris_) sunt compacti vasculis visui se subducentibus;\r\nin aliis (_Orthopteris_, _Neuropteris_, _Dipteris_, et quibusdam\r\n_Coleopteris_) e vasculis brevibus cæcis variique voluminis\r\nconformati sunt, atque tunica densa tenaci vel rete tantum mucoso\r\nobducti[1630]; vel iterum ex unico variisque modis tecto canali varie\r\ncontorto et implexo, qui deduci potest et haud raro massam ovalem\r\ntrachearum ope contextam refert, conflantur, ut in _Coleopteris\r\nPrædaceis_ tam aquaticis quam terrestribus[1631].\r\n\r\n_Numero_ etiam variant testes. Quædam _Lepidoptera_, ut _Pontia\r\nBrassicæ_, item _Iulidæ_[1632], _unico_ gaudent; pleraque tamen\r\ninsecta animalia vertebrata hic æmulantur, et testibus instruuntur\r\n_duobus_; in _Nepa cinerea_ et reliquis _Hemipteris_ quatuor vel\r\nquinque[1633], in _Melolontha vulgari_ sex[1634], et in _Cetonia\r\naurata_ duodecim[1635], utrinque deteguntur. Interdum ex acinis\r\npluribus compacti videntur, et bacciformes appellari possunt. In\r\n_Lamia_ duodecim glandulæ in utroque teste coalitæ inveniuntur[1636],\r\net in _Tenebrione Molitore_ plurimæ[1637].\r\n\r\nQuoad _figuram_, interdum, ut in _Pontia_ Papilionum genere, spherici\r\nevadunt[1638]; in _Gryllo_ pyriformes[1639]; in _Ape mellifica_\r\noblongi[1640]; lineares et longissimi in _Procruste coriaceo_, in\r\nquo _decies_ longitudine corpus superant[1641]; in _Nepa cinerea_\r\nsub-ovati, et singuli filamento longo varie convoluto et contorto\r\nterminati[1642].\r\n\r\nIn _larvis_ etiam hæc organa detegere est. Sic in eruca _Pontiæ_\r\nquatuor testes sunt utrinque, vel potius unicus ex quatuor serie\r\nordinatis, conflatus[1643]. Hi sensim coacervantur donec in sphæricum\r\ntestem antea descriptum coalescant.\r\n\r\n6. _Prehensores_[1644] sunt organa figura varia quibuscum mas\r\nin coitu feminæ anum corripit et comprimit. Quoddam analogum in\r\nquibusdam _Mammaliis_, _Avibus_, _Piscibus_, et _Reptilibus_[1645]\r\ninvenitur, sed in insectis maxime conspicui. Eorum _situs_,\r\n_numerus_; et _forma_, sunt notandi.\r\n\r\nQuoad _situm_--circa foramen per quem prodit penis sub ano plerumque\r\nsunt inserti, sed in _Conope_ cornu prehensorium in segmento ventrali\r\nantepenultimo deprehenditur[1646]; et in _Libellulinis_, præter\r\nprehensores _anales_, par est aliud anum spectans, in secundo _ventris_\r\nsegmento pone penis ipsius situm[1647]. Prehensorum _numerus_ minime\r\nconstans: plerumque _duo_ sunt, sed in _Cicada_, _unicus_ furcatus\r\ntantummodo videre est[1648]; in _Lepidopteris_ variis, _Conope_,\r\n_Libellulidis_, _tres_ anum armant, difformes tamen[1649]; _duo\r\nparia Culicem_ signant[1650], _Megachilem murariam_[1651], et\r\n_Agrionidas_[1652]; in _Locustis_ veris intra abdomen retracta sunt\r\nhæc organa; in pupa tamen _L. morbillosæ_, in nostro musæo asservata,\r\n_quinque_ apparent; _sex_ in _Formicis_ De Geerius detexit, sed in\r\ncognato genere _Myrmica_, _duo_ tantum[1653]; _quatuor paribus_\r\npostremo _Tipula oleracea_ instructa est. Prehensorum _forma_\r\nmultifarie variat, imò haud raro in specie eadem: interdum enim\r\n_prehensioni_ soli hujusmodi instrumenta sunt adaptata, aliis diversæ\r\nfiguræ _compressionem_ efficientibus; interdum et utroque munere\r\nfunguntur. In _Pontia Brassicæ_, in qua par _unicum_, concavo-convexi\r\nsunt, deltoidei, intus setis rigidis fimbriati, et apice dente\r\nincurvo armati[1654]; in _Acrida varia_ tenues, simplices, recurvi;\r\nin _Spilosomate lubricipeda_, quæ _tribus_ gaudet, laterales sunt\r\nconcavo-convexi, ovati, dum intermedius brevior est, triangularis\r\net unguiculo armatus[1655]; in _Cordulia ænea_, et affinibus, _duo\r\nsuperiores_ sunt lineares et undulati, et _inferior unicus_ profunde\r\nbifidus[1656]; in _Vanessa Urticæ_ exteriores duo sunt conchiformes,\r\npar autem interius unguiforme[1657]; in _Culice_ superiores longiores\r\nconici hirsuti, inferiores breviores et ut in præcedente unguem\r\nreferunt[1658]; in _Tipula oleracea_, in qua _octuplici_ prehensore\r\nanus armatus, valvulæ omnes figura diversæ--par exterius nempe concavum\r\nmembranaceum reliquos includens, secundum unguiculatum, tertium\r\nsubclavatum, et ultimum fere lunatum[1659]; in _Megachile muraria_,\r\ninter alios diversos, unum par literæ T formam habet[1660]; in _Bombo_\r\nforceps analis bivalvis est intus ramosus[1661]; et in _Panorpa_\r\ncheliformis[1662].\r\n\r\n7. De _semine_ ipso insectorum paucula sunt notanda. Fluidum est\r\nspissum, lacteum, granulis repletum; sub lente punctula numerosa,\r\nnigra, oblonga, incurva, in illo deteguntur. Quoad _analysin_ ejus,\r\nneque alkalinum neque acidum est, sed quoddam neutrum inter hos\r\nintermedium. Ex sanie vel sanguine deoxydato, et durante coitu\r\ncopiosissime secernitur: in aqua tepida solvitur, et conquassatum\r\nfundum petit: spiritu vini rectificato superfuso flocculi quidam\r\nformantur[1663].\r\n\r\nii. _Genitalia_ feminea _vulva_ excepta antea tractavi[1664], hæc est\r\ntubus subcylindricus, foramine ovali vel lunato ab ano distincto,\r\ncum matrice connexus, et per quem semen in coitu transmittitur.\r\nIn _Scorpionibus_ duplicem esse vulvam affirmatur duobus ovariis\r\nconnexum[1665].\r\n\r\nII. _Coitus._--Coitum insectorum tractaturo paucula de lenociniis\r\namatoriis, et aliis ejusmodi, quæ antecedunt, sunt prædicenda.\r\n_Olfactu_ mares _Phalænarum_ interdum feminam latentem, uti canis\r\nleporem, odorantur[1666]; splendore phosphorico _Lampyrides_ et\r\nquorundam aliorum insectorum feminæ maritum ad lectum gramineum\r\nprælucent; et huc referri forsan debet plurium cæcus ardor lumina\r\ncircumvolandi, vel etiam in lumen irruendi; _sonus_ excitat feminas\r\n_Cicadarum_ et _Gryllinarum_[1667], &c. ad amores, et cantu stridulo\r\nquerelisque amatoriis diem ducit mas cupidus, donec sponsa advolat,\r\net tori foliosi fit haud invita particeps. Sonitu etiam uterque sexus\r\nformidati _Anobii_ mutuo sese provocant ad venerem[1668].\r\n\r\nIn plurimis tamen insectis femina fit modestiæ et pudicitiæ exemplar,\r\net non nisi difficillime et capite averso maris ardori se tradit. In\r\ninsectorum moribus et œconomia virtutum plurimarum typum quendam et\r\ndelineationem nobis proposuit DEUS O. M., quem imitari nos voluit,\r\ninterdum jussit[1669]. Sic excitare nos ad laborem indefessum, ad\r\nprudentiam item et amorem erga prolem _Formicæ_ dedit[1670]: _Api_\r\nad devotam sui consecrationem, et omnium facultatum et virium ad\r\nreipublicæ emolumentum, ad obsequium quoque verum erga parentes et\r\nregem[1671]; atque ita, ut jam dictum est, in re amatoria insectorum\r\nfeminæ sæpe speciem præ se ferunt pudoris et castitatis, et virginibus\r\nverecundiam, virtutum omnium custodem, et sexûs sui ornamentum maxime\r\nproprium, moribus suis prædicant. Hujus modestiæ exemplar insigne\r\npræbent _Libellulinæ_. Œstro amoris concitus, mas feminæ collum\r\n_prehensore_ anali triphyllo arripit et avolat, illam quasi prædam\r\nsecum gerens; sponsæ sic electæ, persuadere in animo est ut caudam suam\r\ninflecteret, et ad coitum se daret, quod, illa invita, fieri nequit;\r\nmaris enim genitalia, ut antea dictum est, in basi ventris sita, feminæ\r\nvero in extremo ano; hinc, nolente illa, vix fit coitus, et sæpissime\r\nlongo et vano labore, huc illuc volando virginem protervam frustra\r\nsolicitat; sed tandem lacessitus aquas petit, quas sponsæ cauda longa,\r\nme teste, sæpius flagellat, donec defatigata, et quasi ex frigido\r\ncalorem concipiens, demum et sensim caudam inflectit, et se reddit\r\namori[1672]. _Araneam_ ferocem, sævam etiam in amoribus, mas caute\r\nappropinquat, et, si blanditiis ejus minus propitiam sese ostendat,\r\ncito resilit, ne osculorum loco morte donetur: coitu etiam peracto,\r\npede veloci ab uxore se subducit, quæ illum, imo post Veneres, aliàs\r\nforsan voraret[1673]. In genere mares feminas antennarum et abdominis\r\nmotibus et frictione lenocinantur et ad coitum provocant.\r\n\r\nInsecta sunt alia, ut _Phalænæ_, _Muscidæ_ quædam, et _Apis\r\nmellifica_, in quibus inversa est hæc naturæ lex casta; harum enim\r\nfeminæ marem petunt, vel blanditiis alliciunt ad amores.\r\n\r\nNunc de _coitu_ ipso tractabimus, in quo hæc sunt præcipue\r\nnotanda--_modus_, _statio relativa_, _locus_, et _duratio_.\r\n\r\ni. Plerisque insectis penis _intrans_ est, sed in _Muscidis_\r\nquibusdam inversa est lex, et feminæ tubus retractilis analis,\r\nforamen sub ano maris penetrat et ita coëunt[1674]. _Araneidis_\r\nsingulari et mirabili prorsus modo fit coitus; organi enim masculi\r\nfunctio partim palpis et partim membro ventrali delegatur: prioribus\r\nincluditur glans quæ pudendum femineum penetrat, et sic in utroque\r\nsexu, palpis ambobus alternis vicibus huic officio inservientibus,\r\norgasmus venereus producitur, cui insequitur fœcundatio, ab organo\r\n_ventrali_ masculo; femina tubercula duo supra genitalia sita in\r\nrimas totidem inter branchias maris immittente, et in temporis\r\nmomento omnia peracta sunt[1675].

Where a Synonym of any genus is printed in _Roman_ letters,\r\nit indicates that such genus is so denominated in the former Editions\r\nof this work. The first namer of a genus, together with any author\r\nwho has written a monograph upon it, or on any tribe, and the more\r\neminent systematists, are usually only quoted. If the reader finds\r\nany difference, as is sometimes the case, between the text and the\r\nIndex, he will be pleased to correct the _former_ by the _latter_.--For\r\ninstance, it was not discovered till too late, that the name _Uria_\r\nwas pre-occupied in Ornithology;--in the Index this name is altered to\r\n_Uriata_. Doubtful _species_ are printed in Italics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1697] It is to be observed, that the individuals of this Order\r\nbelong some to _Mandibulata_, as _Nirmus_; others to _Haustellata_,\r\nas _Pediculus_; and others, as the _Polypoda_, in which the seven\r\norgans of a perfect mouth are multiplied, properly to neither of\r\nthese subclasses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                ABBREVIATIONS, USED IN THE ABOVE INDEX,\r\n                               EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Acs._ Acharius.\r\n  _Afz._ Afzelius.\r\n  _Ahr._ Ahrens.\r\n  _Blb._ Billberg.\r\n  _Bjr._ Bjerkander.\r\n  _Bn._ Bonelli.\r\n  _Bc._ Bosc.\r\n  _Bng._ Brongniart.\r\n  _Brn._ Brown.\r\n  _Chr._ Charpentier.\r\n  _Cst._ Christ.\r\n  _Cl._ Clairville.\r\n  _Ck._ Clark.\r\n  _Cqt._ Coquebert.\r\n  _Cts._ Curtis.\r\n  _Cuv._ Cuvier.\r\n  _Czn._ Czenpinski.\r\n  _Dg._ Dahlberg.\r\n  _Dn._ Dalman.\r\n  _DeG._ DeGeer.\r\n  _DeJ._ DeJean.\r\n  _DeL._ Delatour.\r\n  _Dny._ Denny.\r\n  _Ds._ Dorthes.\r\n  _Dft._ Duftschmidt.\r\n  _Du._ Dumeril.\r\n  _F._ Fabricius.\r\n  _Fln._ Fallen.\r\n  _Fch._ Fischer.\r\n  _Frö._ Frölich.\r\n  _Gff._ Geoffroy.\r\n  _Grm._ Germar.\r\n  _Gml._ Gmelin.\r\n  _Gdt._ Godart.\r\n  _Grv._ Gravenhorst.\r\n  _Grn._ Gronovius.\r\n  _Gyl._ Gyllenhal.\r\n  _Hgn._ Hagenbach.\r\n  _Hth._ Haworth.\r\n  _Hel._ Hellenius.\r\n  _Hlw._ Hellwig.\r\n  _Hst._ Herbst.\r\n  _Hrm._ Hermann.\r\n  _Hff._ Hoffmanseg.\r\n  _Hp._ Hoppe.\r\n  _Ho._ Host.\r\n  _Hbr._ Huber.\r\n  _Hü._ Hübner.\r\n  _Il._ Illiger.\r\n  _Jur._ Jurine.\r\n  _Kby._ Kirby.\r\n  _Kg._ Klug.\r\n  _Kn._ Knoch.\r\n  _Kgn._ Kugellan.\r\n  _Lg._ Lagus.\r\n  _Lai._ Laichart.\r\n  _Lam._ Lamarck.\r\n  _Lsp._ Laspeyres.\r\n  _Ltr._ Latreille.\r\n  _Lx._ Laxman.\r\n  _Lch._ Leach.\r\n  _Lwn._ Lewin.\r\n  _Ltn._ Lichtenstein.\r\n  _L._ Linnæus.\r\n  _M^cL._ MacLeay.\r\n  _Mm._ Marsham.\r\n  _Mg._ Megerle.\r\n  _Mgn._ Meigen.\r\n  _Mü._ Müller.\r\n  _Ntz._ Nitzsch.\r\n  _Ocr._ Ochsenheimer.\r\n  _Olf._ Olfers.\r\n  _Ol._ Olivier.\r\n  _O.
