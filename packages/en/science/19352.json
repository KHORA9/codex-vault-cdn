T. FERNIE, M.D.\r\nAuthor of \"Botanical Outlines,\" etc_\r\n\r\nSecond Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Medicine is mine; what herbs and _Simples_ grow\r\nIn fields and forests, all their powers I know.\"\r\n               DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia:\r\nBoericke & Tafel.\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Jamque aderat Phoebo ante alios dilectus lapis\r\n        Iasides: acri quondam cui captus amore\r\n        Ipse suas artes, sua munera, laetus Apollo\r\n        Augurium, citharamque dabat, celeresque sagittas\r\n        Ille ut _depositi_ proferret fata _clientis,_\r\n        Scire potestates herbarum, usumque medendi\r\n        Maluit, et mutas agitare inglorius artes.\"\r\n                            VIRGIL, _AEnid_: Libr. xii. v. 391-8.\r\n\r\n        \"And now lapis had appeared,\r\n        Blest leech! to Phoebus'-self endeared\r\n                Beyond all men below;\r\n        On whom the fond, indulgent God\r\n        His augury had fain bestowed,\r\n                His lyre-his sounding bow!\r\n        But he, the further to prolong\r\n                A fellow creature's span,\r\n        _The humbler art of Medicine chose,\r\n        The knowledge of each plant that grows,_\r\n        Plying a craft not known to song,\r\n                An unambitious man!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[vii]\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that one or another enquirer taking up this book will\r\nask, to begin with, \"What is a Herbal Simple?\" The English word\r\n\"Simple,\" composed of two Latin words, _Singula plica_ (a single\r\nfold), means \"Singleness,\" whether of material or purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom primitive times the term \"Herbal Simple\" has been applied\r\nto any homely curative remedy consisting of one ingredient only,\r\nand that of a vegetable nature. Many such a native medicine found\r\nfavour and success with our single-minded forefathers, this being\r\nthe \"reverent simplicity of ancienter times.\"\r\n\r\nIn our own nursery days, as we now fondly remember, it was:\r\n\"Simple Simon met a pieman going to the fair; said Simple Simon\r\nto the pieman, 'Let me taste your ware.'\" That ingenuous youth had\r\nbut one idea, connected simply with his stomach; and his sole\r\nthought was how to devour the contents of the pieman's tin. We\r\nventure to hope our readers may be equally eager to stock their\r\nminds with the sound knowledge of Herbal Simples which this\r\nmodest Manual seeks to provide for their use.\r\n\r\nHealing by herbs has always been popular both [xviii] with the\r\nclassic nations of old, and with the British islanders of more recent\r\ntimes. Two hundred and sixty years before the date of Hippocrates\r\n(460 B.C.) the prophet Isaiah bade King Hezekiah, when sick unto\r\ndeath, \"take a lump of Figs, and lay it on the boil; and straightway\r\nthe King recovered.\"\r\n\r\nIapis, the favourite pupil of Apollo, was offered endowments of\r\nskill in augury, music, or archery. But he preferred to acquire a\r\nknowledge of herbs for service of cure in sickness; and, armed\r\nwith this knowledge, he saved the life of AEneas when grievously\r\nwounded by an arrow. He averted the hero's death by applying the\r\nplant \"Dittany,\" smooth of leaf, and purple of blossom, as plucked\r\non the mountain Ida.\r\n\r\nIt is told in _Malvern Chase_ that Mary of Eldersfield (1454),\r\n\"whom some called a witch,\" famous for her knowledge of herbs\r\nand medicaments, \"descending the hill from her hut, with a small\r\nphial of oil, and a bunch of the 'Danewort,' speedily enabled Lord\r\nEdward of March, who had just then heavily sprained his knee, to\r\navoid danger by mounting 'Roan Roland' freed from pain, as it\r\nwere by magic, through the plant-rubbing which Mary\r\nadministered.\"\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare's time there was a London street, named\r\nBucklersbury (near the present Mansion House), noted for its\r\nnumber of druggists who sold Simples and sweet-smelling herbs.\r\nWe read, in [ix] _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, that Sir John\r\nFalstaff flouted the effeminate fops of his day as \"Lisping\r\nhawthorn buds that smell like Bucklersbury in simple time.\"\r\n\r\nVarious British herbalists have produced works, more or less\r\nlearned and voluminous, about our native medicinal plants; but no\r\nauthor has hitherto radically explained the why and where fore of\r\ntheir ultimate curative action. In common with their early\r\npredecessors, these several writers have recognised the healing\r\nvirtues of the herbs, but have failed to explore the chemical\r\nprinciples on which such virtues depend. Some have attributed the\r\nherbal properties to the planets which rule their growth. Others\r\nhave associated the remedial herbs with certain cognate colours,\r\nordaining red flowers for disorders of the blood, and yellow for\r\nthose of the liver. \"The exorcised demon of jaundice,\" says\r\nConway, \"was consigned to yellow parrots; that of inflammatory\r\ndisease to scarlet, or red weeds.\" Again, other herbalists have\r\nselected their healing plants on the doctrine of allied signatures,\r\nchoosing, for instance, the Viper's Bugloss as effectual against\r\nvenomous bites, because of its resembling a snake; and the sweet\r\nlittle English Eyebright, which shows a dark pupil in the centre\r\nwhite ocular corolla, as of signal benefit for inflamed eyes.\r\n\r\nThus it has continued to happen that until the [x] last half-century\r\nHerbal Physic has remained only speculative and experimental,\r\ninstead of gaining a solid foothold in the field of medical science.\r\nIts claims have been merely empirical, and its curative methods\r\nthose of a blind art:--\r\n\r\n        \"Si vis curari, de morbo nescio quali,\r\n        Accipias herbam; sed quale nescio; nec qua\r\n        Ponas; nescio quo; curabere, nescio quando.\"\r\n\r\n        Your sore, I know not what, be not foreslow\r\n        To cure with herbs, which, where, I do not know;\r\n        Place them, well pounc't, I know not how, and then\r\n        You shall be perfect whole, I know not when.\"\r\n\r\nHappily now-a-days, as our French neighbours would say, _Nous\r\navons change tout cela_, \"Old things are passed away; behold all\r\nthings are become new!\" Herbal Simples stand to-day safely\r\ndetermined on sure ground by the help of the accurate chemist.\r\nThey hold their own with the best, and rank high for homely cures,\r\nbecause of their proved constituents. Their manifest healing\r\nvirtues are shown to depend on medicinal elements plainly\r\ndisclosed by analysis. Henceforward the curtain of oblivion must\r\nfall on cordial waters distilled mechanically from sweet herbs, and\r\non electuaries artlessly compounded of seeds and roots by a Lady\r\nMonmouth, or a Countess of Arundel, as in the Stuart and Tudor\r\ntimes. Our Herbal Simples are fairly entitled at last to independent\r\npromotion from the shelves of the amateur still-room, from [xi]\r\nthe rustic ventures of the village grandam, and from the shallow\r\npractices of self styled botanical doctors in the back streets of our\r\ncities.\r\n\r\n        \"I do remember an apothecary,--\r\n        And hereabouts he dwells,--whom late I noted\r\n        In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,\r\n        _Culling of Simples_; meagre were his looks;\r\n        And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\r\n        An alligator stuff'd, and other skins\r\n        Of ill-shap'd fishes; and about his shelves\r\n        A beggarly account of empty boxes,\r\n        Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\r\n        Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\r\n        Were thinly scattered to make up a show.\"\r\n                            _Romeo and Juliet_, Act V. Sc. 1.\r\n\r\nChemically assured, therefore, of the sterling curative powers\r\nwhich our Herbal Simples possess, and anxious to expound them\r\nwith a competent pen, the present author approaches his task with\r\na zealous purpose, taking as his pattern, from the _Comus_ of\r\nMilton:--\r\n\r\n                    \"A certain shepherd lad\r\n        Of small regard to see to, yet well skilled\r\n        In every virtuous plant, and healing herb;\r\n                    He would beg me sing;\r\n        Which, when I did, he on the tender grass\r\n        Would sit, and hearken even to constancy;\r\n        And in requital ope his leathern scrip,\r\n        And show me _Simples_, of a thousand names,\r\n        Telling their strange, and vigorous faculties.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare said, three centuries ago, \"throw physic to the dogs.\"\r\nBut prior to him, one Doctor Key, self styled Caius, had written in\r\nthe Latin [xii] tongue (_tempore_ Henry VIII.), a Medical History\r\nof the British Canine Race. His book became popular, though\r\nabounding in false concords; insomuch that from then until now\r\nmedical classics have been held by scholars in poor repute for\r\ngrammar, and sound construction. Notwithstanding which risk,\r\nmany a passage is quoted here of ancient Herbal lore in the past\r\ntongues of Greece, Rome; and the Gauls. It is fondly hoped that\r\nthe apt lines thus borrowed from old faultless sources will escape\r\nreproach for a defective modern rendering in Dog Latin, Mongrel\r\nGreek, or the \"French of Stratford atte bowe.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, quaint old Fuller shall lend an appropriate Epilogue. \"I\r\nstand ready,\" said he (1672), \"with a pencil in one hand, and a spunge\r\nin the other, to add, alter, insert, efface, enlarge, and delete,\r\naccording to better information. And if these my pains shall be\r\nfound worthy to passe a second Impression, my faults I will\r\nconfess with shame, and amend with thankfulnesse, to such as will\r\ncontribute clearer intelligence unto me.\"\r\n\r\n    1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[xiii]\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nOn its First Reading, a Bill drafted in Parliament meets with\r\nacquiescence from the House on both sides mainly because its\r\nmerits and demerits are to be more deliberately questioned when it\r\ncomes up again in the future for a second closer Reading,\r\nMeanwhile, its faults can be amended, and its omissions supplied:\r\nfresh clauses can be introduced: and the whole scheme of the Bill\r\ncan be better adapted to the spirit of the House inferred from its\r\nfirst reception.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat similar fashion the Second Edition of \"Herbal\r\nSimples\" is now submitted to a Parliament of readers with the\r\nbelief that its ultimate success, or failure of purpose, is to depend\r\non its present revised contents, and the amplified scope of its\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nThe criticism which public journalists, not a few, thought proper to\r\npass on its First Edition have been attentively considered herein. It\r\nis true their comments were in some cases so conflicting as to be\r\ndifficult of practical appliance. The fabled old man and his ass\r\nstand always in traditional warning against futile attempts to\r\nsatisfy inconsistent objectors, or to carry into effect suggestions\r\nmade by irreconcilable censors. \"_Quot homines, tot [xiv]\r\nsententioe_,\" is an adage signally verified when a fresh venture is\r\nmade on the waters of chartered opinion. How shall the perplexed\r\nnavigator steer his course when monitors in office accuse him on\r\nthe one hand of lax precision throughout, and belaud him on the\r\nother for careful observance of detail? Or how shall he trim his\r\nsails when a contemptuous Standard-bearer, strangely uninformed\r\non the point, ignores, as a leader of any repute, \"one Gerard,\" a\r\nformer famous Captain of the Herbal fleet? With the would-be\r\nSpectator's lament that Gerard's graphic drawings are regrettedly\r\nwanting here, the author is fain to concur. He feels that the\r\nabsence of appropriate cuts to depict the various herbs is quite a\r\ndeficiency: but the hope is inspired that a still future Edition may\r\nserve to supply this need. Certain botanical mistakes pointed out\r\nwith authority by the _Pharmaceutical Journal _have here been\r\nduly corrected: and as many as fifty additional Simples will be\r\nfound described in the present Enlarged Edition. At the same time\r\na higher claim than hitherto made for the paramount importance of\r\nthe whole subject is now courageously advanced.\r\n\r\nTo all who accept as literal truth the Scriptural account of the\r\nGarden of Eden it must be evident how intimately man's welfare\r\nfrom the first was made to depend on his uses of trees and herbs.\r\nThe labour of earning his bread in the sweat of his brow by tilling\r\nthe ground: and the penalty of [xv] and thistles produced\r\nthereupon, were alike incurred by Eve's disobedience in plucking\r\nthe forbidden fruit: and a signified possibility of man's eventful\r\nshare in the tree of life, to \"put forth his hand, and eat, and live\r\nfor ever,\" has been more than vaguely revealed. So that with almost a\r\nsacred mission, and with an exalted motive of supreme usefulness,\r\nthis Manual of healing Herbs is published anew, to reach, it is\r\nhoped, and to rescue many an ailing mortal.\r\n\r\nAgainst its main principle an objection has been speciously raised,\r\nwhich at first sight appears of subversive weight; though, when\r\nfurther examined, it is found to be clearly fallacious. By an able\r\nbut carping critic it was alleged that the mere chemical analysis of\r\nold-fashioned Herbal Simples makes their medicinal actions no\r\nless empirical than before: and that a pedantic knowledge of their\r\nconstituent parts, invested with fine technical names, gives them\r\nno more scientific a position than that which our fathers\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nBut, taking, for instance, the herb Rue, which was formerly\r\nbrought into Court to protect a and the Bench from gaol fever, and\r\nother infectious disease; no one knew at the time by what\r\nparticular virtue the Rue could exercise this salutary power. But\r\nmore recent research has taught, that the essential oil contained in\r\nthis, and other allied aromatic herbs, such as Elecampane, [xvi]\r\nRosemary, and Cinnamon, serves by its germicidal principles\r\n(stearoptens, methyl-ethers, and camphors), to extinguish bacterial\r\nlife which underlies all contagion. In a parallel way the antiseptic\r\ndiffusible oils of Pine, Peppermint, and Thyme, are likewise\r\nemployed with marked success for inhalation into the lungs by\r\nconsumptive patients. Their volatile vapours reach remote parts of\r\nthe diseased air-passages, and heal by destroying the morbid\r\ngerms which perpetuate mischief therein. It need scarcely be said\r\nthe very existence of these causative microbes, much less any\r\nmode of cure by their abolishment, was quite unknown to former\r\nHerbal Simplers.\r\n\r\nAgain, in past times a large number of our native, plants acquired\r\na well-deserved, but purely empirical celebrity, for curing scrofula\r\nand scurvy. But later discovery has shown that each of these\r\nseveral herbs contains lime, and earthy salts, in a subtle form of\r\nhigh natural sub-division: whilst, at the same time, the law of cure\r\nby medicinal similars has established the cognate fact that to those\r\nwho inherit a strumous taint, infinitesimal doses of these earth\r\nsalts are incontestably curative. The parents had first undergone a\r\ngradual impairment of health because of calcareous matters to\r\nexcess in their general conditions of sustenance; and the lime\r\nproves potent to cure in the offspring what, through the parental\r\nsurfeit, was entailed as [xvii] a heritage of disease. Just in the\r\nsame way the mineral waters of Missisquoi, and Bethesda, in America,\r\nthrough containing siliceous qualities so sublimated as almost to\r\ndefy the analyst, are effective to cure cancer, albuminuria, and\r\nother organic complaints.\r\n\r\nNor is this by any means a new policy of cure. Its barbaric practice\r\nhas long since obtained, even in African wilds, where the native\r\nsnake doctor inoculates with his prepared snake poison to save the\r\nlife of a victim otherwise fatally bitten by another snake of the\r\nsame deadly virus. To Ovid, of Roman fame (20 B.C.), the same\r\nsanative axiom was also indisputably known as we learn from his\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n        \"Tunc observatas augur descendit in herbas;\r\n        Usus et auxilio est anguis ab angue dato.\"\r\n\r\n        \"Then searched the Augur low mid grass close scanned\r\n        For snake to heal a snake-envenomed hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with equal cogency other arguments, which are manifold,\r\nmight be readily adduced, as of congruous force, to vindicate our\r\nclaim in favour of analytical knowledge over blind experience in\r\nthe methods of Herbal cure, especially if this be pursued on the\r\nbroad lines of enlightened practice by similars.\r\n\r\nSo now, to be brief, and to change our allegory, \"on the banks of\r\nthe Nile,\" as Mrs. Malaprop would have pervertingly put it, with\r\n\"a nice [xviii] derangement of epitaphs,\" we invite our many\r\nguests to a simple \"dinner of herbs.\" Such was man's primitive\r\nfood in Paradise: \"every green herb bearing seed, and every tree in\r\nthe which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed:\" \"the green herb for\r\nmeat for every beast of the earth, and every fowl of the air.\" What\r\nbetter Preface can we indite than a grace to be said before sitting\r\ndown to the meal? \"Sallets,\" it is hoped, will be found \"in the lines\r\nto make the matter savoury.\" Far be it from our object to preach a\r\nprelude of texts, or to weary those at our board I with a\r\nmeaningless long benediction. \"'Tis not so plain as the old Hill of\r\nHowth,\" said tender-hearted witty Tom Hood, with serio-comic\r\ntruth, \"a man has got his belly full of meat, because he talks with\r\nvictuals in his mouth.\" Rather would we choose the \"russet Yeas\r\nand honest kersey Noes\" of sturdy yeoman speech; and cheerfully\r\ntaking the head of our well-stocked table, ask in homely terms that\r\n\"God will bless these the good creatures of His Herbal Simples to\r\nour saving uses, and us to His grateful service.\"\r\n\r\n    1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[xix]\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nAbsinthe . . . 614\r\nAcorn . . . 15\r\nAgaric, Fly . . . 368\r\nAgrimony . . . 18\r\nAlexanders . . . 313\r\nAllspice

It aims\r\nat curing common ailments with simple remedies culled from the\r\nsoil, or got from home resources near at hand.\r\n\r\nSince the days of the Anglo-Saxons such remedies have been\r\nchiefly herbal; insomuch that the word \"drug\" came originally\r\nfrom their verb _drigan_, to dry, as applied to medicinal plants.\r\n\r\nThese primitive Simplers were guided in their choice of herbs\r\npartly by watching animals who sought them out for self-cure, and\r\npartly by discovering for themselves the sensible properties of the\r\nplants as revealed by their odour and taste; also by their supposed\r\nresemblance to those diseases which nature meant them to heal.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn relates in his _Acetaria_ (1725) that \"one Signor\r\nFaquinto, physician to Queen Anne (mother to the beloved martyr,\r\nCharles the First), and formerly physician to one of the Popes,\r\nobserving scurvy and dropsy to be the epidemical and dominant\r\ndiseases [2] of this nation, went himself into the hundreds of\r\nEssex, reputed the most unhealthy county of this island, and used\r\nto follow the sheep and cattle on purpose to observe what plants\r\nthey chiefly fed upon; and of these Simples he composed an\r\nexcellent electuary of marvellous effects against these same\r\nobnoxious infirmities.\" Also, in like manner, it was noticed by\r\nothers that \"the dog, if out of condition, would seek for certain\r\ngrasses of an emetic or purgative sort; sheep and cows, when\r\nill, would devour curative plants; an animal suffering from\r\nrheumatism would remain as much as it could in the sunshine; and\r\ncreatures infested by parasites would roll themselves frequently in\r\nthe dust.\" Again, William Coles in his _Nature's Paradise, or, Art\r\nof Simpling_ (1657), wrote thus: \"Though sin and Sathan have\r\nplunged mankinde into an ocean of infirmities, jet the mercy of\r\nGod, which is over all His works, maketh grass to grow upon the\r\nmountaines, and Herbes for the use of men; and hath not only\r\nstamped upon them a distinct forme, but also given them particular\r\nsignatures, whereby a man may read even in legible characters the\r\nuse of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe present manual of our native Herbal Simples seeks rather to\r\njustify their uses on the sound basis of accurate chemical analysis,\r\nand precise elementary research. Hitherto medicinal herbs have\r\ncome down to us from early times as possessing only a traditional\r\nvalue, and as exercising merely empirical effects. Their selection\r\nhas been commended solely by a shrewd discernment, and by the\r\npractice of successive centuries. But to-day a closer analysis in the\r\nlaboratory, and skilled provings by experts have resolved the\r\nseveral plants into their component parts, and have chemically\r\ndetermined the medicinal nature of these parts, both [3] singly and\r\ncollectively. So that the study and practice of curative British\r\nherbs may now fairly take rank as an exact science, and may\r\ncommand the full confidence of the sick for supplying trustworthy\r\naid and succour in their times of bodily need.\r\n\r\nScientific reasons which are self-convincing may be readily\r\nadduced for prescribing all our best known native herbal\r\nmedicines. Among them the Elder, Parsley, Peppermint, and\r\nWatercress may be taken as familiar examples of this leading fact.\r\nAlmost from time immemorial in England a \"rob\" made from the\r\njuice of Elderberries simmered and thickened with sugar, or\r\nmulled Elder wine concocted from the fruit, with raisins, sugar,\r\nand spices, has been a popular remedy in this country, if taken hot\r\nat bedtime, for a recent cold, or for a sore throat. But only of late\r\nhas chemistry explained that Elderberries furnish \"viburnic acid,\"\r\nwhich induces sweating, and is specially curative of inflammatory\r\nbronchial soreness. So likewise Parsley, besides being a favourite\r\npot herb, and a garnish for cold meats, has been long popular in\r\nrural districts as a tea for catarrh of the bladder or kidneys; whilst\r\nthe bruised leaves have been extolled as a poultice for swellings\r\nand open sores. At the same time, a saying about the herb has\r\ncommonly prevailed that it \"brings death to men, and salvation to\r\nwomen.\" Not, however, until recently has it been learnt that the\r\nsweet-smelling plant yields what chemists call \"apiol,\" or\r\nParsley-Camphor, which, when given in moderation, exercises a quieting\r\ninfluence on the main sensific centres of life--the head and the\r\nspine. Thereby any feverish irritability of the urinary organs\r\ninflicted by cold, or other nervous shock, would be subordinately\r\nallayed. Thus likewise the Parsley-Camphor (whilst serving, [4]\r\nwhen applied externally, to usefully stimulate indolent wounds)\r\nproves especially beneficial for female irregularities of the womb,\r\nas was first shown by certain French doctors in 1849.\r\n\r\nAgain, with respect to Peppermint, its cordial water, or its\r\nlozenges taken as a confection, have been popular from the days of\r\nour grandmothers for the relief of colic in the bowels, or for the\r\nstomach-ache of flatulent indigestion. But this practice has\r\nobtained simply because the pungent herb was found to diffuse\r\ngrateful aromatic warmth within the stomach and bowels, whilst\r\npromoting the expulsion of wind; whereas we now know that an\r\nactive principle \"menthol\" contained in the plant, and which may\r\nbe extracted from it as a camphoraceous oil, possesses in a marked\r\ndegree antiseptic and sedative properties which are chemically\r\nhostile to putrescence, and preventive of dyspeptic fermentation.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Watercress has for many years held credit with the\r\ncommon people for curing scurvy and its allied ailments; while its\r\njuices have been further esteemed as of especial use in arresting\r\ntubercular consumption of the lungs; and yet it has remained for\r\nrecent analysis to show that the Watercress is chemically rich in\r\n\"antiscorbutic salts,\" which tend to destroy the germs of tubercular\r\ndisease, and which strike at the root of scurvy generally. These\r\nsalts and remedial principles are \"sulphur,\" \"iodine,\" \"potash,\"\r\n\"phosphatic earths,\" and a particular volatile essential oil known as\r\n\"sulphocyanide of allyl,\" which is almost identical with the\r\nessential oil of White Mustard.\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the chief Herbal Simples indigenous to Great Britain\r\nare further entitled for a still stronger reason to the fullest\r\nconfidence of both doctor [5] and patient. It has been found that\r\nwhen taken experimentally in varying quantities by healthy\r\nprovers, many single medicines will produce symptoms precisely\r\naccording with those of definite recognized maladies; and the\r\nsame herbs, if administered curatively, in doses sufficiently small\r\nto avoid producing their toxical effects, will speedily and surely\r\nrestore the patient to health by dispelling the said maladies. Good\r\ninstances of such homologous cures are afforded by the common\r\nButtercup, the wild Pansy, and the Sundew of our boggy marshes.\r\nIt is widely known that the field Buttercup (_Ranunculus\r\nbulbosus_), when pulled from the ground, and carried in the palm\r\nof the hand, will redden and inflame the skin by the acrimony of its\r\njuices; or, if the bruised leaves are applied to any part they will\r\nexcite a blistering of the outer cuticle, with a discharge of watery\r\nfluid from numerous small vesicles, whilst the tissues beneath\r\nbecome red, hot, and swollen; and these combined symptoms\r\nprecisely represent \"shingles,\"--a painful skin disease given to\r\narise from a depraved state of the bodily system, and from a faulty\r\nsupply of nervous force. These shingles appear as a crop of sore\r\nangry blisters, which commonly surround the walls of the chest\r\neither in part or entirely; and modern medicine teaches that a\r\nmedicinal tincture of the Buttercup, if taken in small doses, and\r\napplied, will promptly and effectively cure the same troublesome\r\nailment; whilst it will further serve to banish a neuralgic or\r\nrheumatic stitch occurring in the side from any other cause.\r\n\r\nAnd so with respect to the Wild Pansy (_Viola tricolor_), we read\r\nin Hahnemann's commentary on the proved plant: \"The Pansy\r\nViolet excites certain cutaneous eruptions about the head and face,\r\na hard thick scab being formed, which is cracked here and there,\r\nand [6] from which a tenacious yellow matter exudes, and hardens\r\ninto a substance like gum.\" This is an accurate picture of the\r\ndiseased state seen often affecting the scalp of unhealthy children,\r\nas milk-crust, or, when aggravated, as a disfiguring eczema, and\r\nconcerning the same Dr. Hughes of Brighton, in his authoritative\r\nmodern treatise, says, \"I have rarely needed any other medicine\r\nthan the Viola tricolor for curing milk-crust, which is the plague of\r\nchildren,\" and \"I have given it in the adult for recent impetigo (a\r\nsimilar disease of the skin), with very satisfactory results.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, the Sundew (_Drosera rotundifolia_), which is a common\r\nlittle plant growing on our bogs, and marshy places, is found to act\r\nin the same double fashion of cause or cure according to the\r\nquantity taken, or administered. Farmers well know that this small\r\nherb when devoured by sheep in their pasturage will bring about a\r\nviolent chronic cough, with waste of substance: whilst the Sundew\r\nwhen given experimentally to cats has been found to stud the\r\nsurface of their lungs with morbid tubercular matter, though this is\r\na form of disease to which cats are not otherwise liable. In like\r\nmanner healthy human provers have become hoarse of voice\r\nthrough taking the plant, and troubled with a severe cough,\r\naccompanied with the expectoration of abundant yellow mucus,\r\njust as in tubercular mischief beginning at the windpipe. Meantime\r\nit has been well demonstrated (by Dr. Curie, and others) that at the\r\nonset of pulmonary consumption in the human subject a cure may\r\nnearly always be brought about, or the symptoms materially\r\nimproved, by giving the tincture of Sundew throughout several\r\nweeks--from four to twenty drops in the twenty-four hours. And it\r\nhas further become an established fact that the same tincture [7]\r\nwill serve with remarkable success to allay the troublesome\r\nspasms of Whooping Cough in its second stage, if given in small\r\ndoses, repeated several times a day.\r\n\r\nFrom these several examples, therefore, which are easy to be\r\nunderstood, we may fairly conclude that positive remedial actions\r\nare equally exercised by other Herbal Simples, both because of\r\ntheir chemical constituents and by reason of their curing in many\r\ncases according to the known law of medicinal correspondence.\r\n\r\nUntil of late no such an assured position could be rightly claimed\r\nby our native herbs, though pretentions in their favour have been\r\nwidely popular since early English times. Indeed, Herbal physic\r\nhas engaged the attention of many authors from the primitive days\r\nof Dioscorides (A.D. 60) to those of Elizabethan Gerard, whose\r\nexhaustive and delightful volume published in 1587 has remained\r\never since in paramount favour with the English people. Its quaint\r\nfascinating style, and its queer astrological notions, together with\r\nits admirable woodcuts of the plants described, have combined to\r\nmake this comprehensive Herbal a standing favourite even to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nGerard had a large physic-garden near his house in Old Bourne\r\n(Holborn), and there is in the British Museum a letter drawn up\r\nby his hand asking Lord Burghley, his patron, to advise the\r\nestablishment by the University of Cambridge in their grounds of\r\na Simpling Herbarium. Nevertheless, we are now told (H. Lee, 1883)\r\nthat Gerard's \"ponderous book is little more than a translation\r\nof Dodonoeus, from which comparatively un-read author whole\r\nchapters have been taken verbatim without acknowledgment.\"\r\n\r\nNo English work on herbs and plants is met with prior to the\r\nsixteenth century. In 1552 all books on [8] astronomy and\r\ngeography were ordered to be destroyed, because supposed to be\r\ninfected with magic. And it is more than probable that any\r\npublications extant at that time on the virtues of herbs (then\r\nassociated by many persons with witchcraft), underwent the same\r\nfate. In like manner King Hezekiah long ago \"fearing lest the\r\nHerbals of Solomon should come into profane hands, caused them\r\nto be burned,\" as we learn from that \"loyal and godly herbalist,\"\r\nRobert Turner.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Edward the Sixth and Mary, Dr. William\r\nBulleyn ranked high as a physician and botanist. He wrote the first\r\n_Boke of Simples_, which remains among the most interesting\r\nliterary productions of that era as a record of his acuteness and\r\nlearning. It advocates the exclusive employment of our native\r\nherbal medicines. Again, Nicholas Culpeper, \"student in physick,\"\r\nwhose name is still a household word with many a plain thinking\r\nEnglish person, published in 1652, for the benefit of the\r\nCommonwealth, his \"Compleat Method whereby a man may cure\r\nhimself being sick, for threepence charge, with such things only as\r\ngrow in England, they being most fit for English bodies.\"\r\nLikewise in 1696 the Honourable Richard Boyle, F.R.S., published\r\n\"_A Collection of Choice, Safe, and Simple English Remedies_,\r\neasily prepared, very useful in families, and fitted for\r\nthe service of country people.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more, the noted John Wesley gave to the world in 1769 an\r\nadmirable little treatise on _Primitive Physic, or an Easy and\r\nNatural Method for Curing most Diseases_; the medicines on\r\nwhich he chiefly relied being our native plants. For asthma, he\r\nadvised the sufferer to \"live a fortnight on boiled Carrots only\";\r\nfor \"baldness, to wash the head with a decoction of Boxwood\"; [9]\r\nfor \"blood-spitting to drink the juice of Nettles\"; for \"an open\r\ncancer, to take freely of Clivers, or Goosegrass, whilst covering\r\nthe sore with the bruised leaves of this herb\"; and for an ague, to\r\nswallow at stated times \"six middling pills of Cobweb.\"\r\n\r\nIn Wesley's day tradition only, with shrewd guesses and close\r\nobservation, led him to prescribe these remedies. But now we have\r\nlearnt by patient chemical research that the Wild Carrot possesses\r\na particular volatile oil, which promotes copious expectoration for\r\nthe relief of asthmatic cough; that the Nettle is endowed in its\r\nstinging hairs with \"formic acid,\" which avails to arrest bleeding;\r\nthat Boxwood yields \"buxine,\" a specific stimulant to those nerves\r\nof supply which command the hair bulbs; that Goosegrass or\r\nClivers is of astringent benefit in cancer, because of its \"tannic,\"\r\n\"citric,\" and \"rubichloric acids\"; and that the Spider's Web is of\r\nreal curative value in ague, because it affords an albuminous\r\nprinciple \"allied to and isomeric with quinine.\"\r\n\r\nLong before this middle era in medicine, during quite primitive\r\nBritish times, the name and office of \"Leeches\" were familiar to\r\nthe people as the first doctors of physic; and their _parabilia_ or\r\n\"accessibles\" were worts from the field and the garden; so that\r\nwhen the Saxons obtained possession of Britain, they found it\r\nalready cultivated and improved by what the Romans knew of\r\nagriculture and of vegetable productions. Hence it had happened\r\nthat Rue, Hyssop, Fennel, Mustard, Elecampane, Southernwood,\r\nCelandine, Radish, Cummin, Onion, Lupin, Chervil, Fleur de\r\nLuce, Flax (probably), Rosemary, Savory, Lovage, Parsley,\r\nCoriander, Alexanders, or Olusatrum, the black pot herb, Savin,\r\nand other useful herbs, were already of common growth for\r\nkitchen uses, or for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n[10] And as a remarkable incidental fact antiquity has bequeathed\r\nto us the legend, that goats were always exceptionally wise in the\r\nchoice of these wholesome herbs; that they are, indeed, the\r\nherbalists among quadrupeds, and known to be \"cunning in\r\nsimples.\" From which notion has grown the idea that they are\r\nphysicians among their kind, and that their odour is wholesome to\r\nthe animals of the farmyard generally. So that in deference,\r\nunknowingly, to this superstition, it still happens that a single\r\nNanny or a Betty is freakishly maintained in many a modern\r\nfarmyard, living at ease, rather than put to any real use, or kept for\r\nany particular purpose of service. But in case of stables on fire, he\r\nor she will face the flames to make good an escape, and then the\r\nhorses will follow.\r\n\r\nIt was through chewing the beans of Mocha, and becoming stupefied\r\nthereby, that unsuspicious goats first drew the attention\r\nof Mahomedan monks to the wonderful properties of the Coffee\r\nberry.\r\n\r\nNext, coming down to the first part of the present century, we find\r\nthat purveyors of medicinal and savoury herbs then wandered over\r\nthe whole of England in quest of such useful simples as were in\r\nconstant demand at most houses for the medicine-chest, the\r\nstore-closet, or the toilet-table. These rustic practitioners of the\r\nhealing art were known as \"green men,\" who carried with them their\r\nportable apparatus for distilling essences, and for preparing their\r\nherbal extracts. In token of their having formerly officiated in this\r\ncapacity, there may yet be seen in London and elsewhere about the\r\ncountry, taverns bearing the curious sign of \"The Green Man and\r\n(his) Still.\"\r\n\r\nIt is told of a certain French writer not long since, that whilst\r\ncomplacently describing our British manners [11] customs, he\r\ngravely translated this legend of the into \"_L'homme vert, et\r\ntranquil_.\"\r\n\r\nPassing on finally to our own times at the close of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, we are able now-a-days, as has been already said, to avail\r\nourselves of precise chemical research by apparatus far in advance\r\nof the untutored herbalist's still. He prepared his medicaments and\r\nhis fragrant essences, merely as a mechanical art, and without\r\npretending to fathom their method of physical action. But the\r\nskilled expert of to-day resolves his herbal simples into their\r\nultimate elements by exact analysis in the laboratory, and has\r\nlearnt to attach its proper medicinal virtue to each of these curative\r\nprinciples. It has thus come about that Herbal Physic under\r\ncompetent guidance, if pursued with intelligent care, is at length a\r\nreliable science of fixed methods, and crowned with sure results.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in this happy way is at last vindicated the infinite\r\nsuperiority felt instinctively by our forefathers of home-grown\r\nherbs over foreign and far-fetched drugs; a superiority long since\r\nexpressed by Ovid with classic felicity in the passage:--\r\n\r\n    \"AEtas cui facimus _aurea_ nomen,\r\n    Fructibus arbuteis, et humus quas educat herbis\r\n    Fortunata fuit.\"--_Metamorphos., Lib. XV_.\r\n\r\n    \"Happy the age, to which we moderns give\r\n    The name of 'golden,' when men chose to live\r\n    On woodland fruits; and for their medicines took\r\n    Herbs from the field, and simples from the brook.\"\r\n\r\nor, as epitomised in the time-worn Latin adage:--\r\n\r\n    \"Qui potest mederi _simplicibus_ frustra quaerit composita.\"\r\n\r\n    \"If _simple_ herbs suffice to cure,\r\n    'Tis vain to compound drugs endure.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following pages our leading Herbal Simples [12] are\r\nreviewed alphabetically; whilst, to ensure accuracy, the genus and\r\nspecies of each plant are particularised.\r\n\r\nMost of these herbs may be gathered fresh in their proper season\r\nby persons who have acquired a knowledge of their parts, and who\r\nlive in districts where such plants are to be found growing; and to\r\nother persons who inhabit towns, or who have no practical\r\nacquaintance with Botany, great facilities are now given by our\r\nprincipal druggists for obtaining from their stores concentrated\r\nfresh juices of the chief herbal simples.\r\n\r\nAgain, certain preparations of plants used only for their specific\r\ncurative methods are to be got exclusively from the Homoeopathic\r\nchemist, unless gathered at first hand. These, not being officinal,\r\nfail to find a place on the shelves of the ordinary Pharmaceutical\r\ndruggist. Nevertheless, when suitably employed, they are of\r\nsingular efficacy in curing the maladies to which they stand akin\r\nby the law of similars. For convenience of distinction here, the\r\nsymbol H. will follow such particular preparations, which number\r\nin all some seventy-five of the simples described. At the same time\r\nany of the more common extracts, juices, and tinctures (or the\r\nproper parts of the plants for making these several medicaments),\r\nmay be readily purchased at the shop of every leading druggist.\r\n\r\nIt has not been thought expedient to include among the Simples\r\nfor homely uses of cure such powerfully poisonous plants as\r\nMonkshood (_Aconite_), Deadly Nightshade (_Belladonna_),\r\nFoxglove (_Digitalis_), Hemlock or Henbane (except for some\r\noutward uses), and the like dangerous herbs, these being beyond\r\nthe province of domestic medicine, whilst only to be administered\r\nunder the advice and guidance of a qualified prescriber.\r\n\r\n[13] The chief purpose held in view has been to reconsider those\r\nsafe and sound herbal curative remedies and medicines which\r\nwere formerly most in vogue as homely simples, whether to be\r\ntaken or to be outwardly applied. And the main object has been to\r\nshow with what confidence their uses may be now resumed, or\r\nretained under the guidance of modern chemical teachings, and of\r\nprecise scientific provings. This question equally applies, whether\r\nthe Simples be employed as auxiliaries by the physician in\r\nattendance, or are welcomed for prompt service in a household\r\nemergency as ready at hand when the doctor cannot be immediately had.\r\n\r\nMoreover, such a Manual as the present of approved Herbal\r\nRemedies need not by any means be disparaged by the busy\r\npractitioner, when his customary medicines seem to be out of\r\nplace, or are beyond speedy reach; it being well known that a sick\r\nperson is always ready to accept with eagerness plain assistant\r\nremedies sensibly advised from the garden, the store-closet, the\r\nspice-box, or the field.\r\n\r\n    \"Of simple medicines, and their powers to cure,\r\n    A wise physician makes his knowledge sure;\r\n    Else I or the household in his healing art\r\n    He stands ill-fitted to take useful part.\"\r\n\r\nSo said Oribasus (freely translated) as long ago as the fourth\r\ncentury, in classic terms prophetic of later times, _Simplicium\r\nmedicamentorum et facultatum quoe in eis insunt cognitio ita\r\nnecessaria est ut sine ea nemo rite medicari queat_.\r\n\r\nBut after all has been said and done, none the less must it be\r\nfinally acknowledged in the pathetic utterance of King Alfred's\r\nAnglo-Saxon proverb, _Nis [14] no wurt woxen on woode ne on\r\nfelde, per enure mage be lif uphelden_.\r\n\r\n    \"No wort is waxen in wood or wold,\r\n    Which may for ever man's life uphold.\"\r\n\r\nNeither to be discovered in the quaint Herbals of primitive times,\r\nnor to be learnt by the advanced chemical knowledge of modern\r\nplant lore, is there any panacea for all the ills to which our flesh\r\nis heir, or an elixir of life, which can secure for us a perpetual\r\nimmunity from sickness. _Contra vim mortis nullum medicamentum\r\nin hortis_, says the rueful Latin distich:--\r\n\r\n    \"No healing herb can conquer death,\r\n    And so for always give us breath.\"\r\n\r\nTo sum up which humiliating conclusion good George Herbert has\r\nput the matter thus with epigrammatic conciseness:--\r\n\r\n    \"St. Luke was a saint and a physician, yet he is dead!\"\r\n\r\nBut none the less bravely we may still take comfort each in his\r\nmortal frailty, because of the hopeful promise preached to men\r\nlong since by the son of Sirach, \"A faithful friend is the Medicine\r\nof life; they that fear the Lord shall find Him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] ACORN.\r\n\r\nThis is the well-known fruit of our British Oak, to Which tree it\r\ngives the name--_Aik_, or _Eik_, Oak.\r\n\r\nThe Acorn was esteemed by Dioscorides, and other old authors,\r\nfor its supposed medicinal virtues. As an article of food it is not\r\nknown to have been habitually used at any time by the inhabitants\r\nof Britain, though acorns furnished the chief support of the large\r\nherds of swine on which our forefathers subsisted. The right of\r\nmaintaining these swine in the woods was called \"panage,\" and\r\nformed a valuable property.\r\n\r\nThe earliest inhabitants of Greece and Southern Europe who lived\r\nin the primeval forests were supported almost wholly on the fruit\r\nof the Oak. They were described by classic authors as fat of\r\nperson, and were called \"balanophagi\"--acorn eaters.\r\n\r\nDuring the great dearth of 1709 the French were driven to eat\r\nbread of acorns steeped in water to destroy the bitterness, and they\r\nsuffered therefrom injurious effects, such as obstinate\r\nconstipation, or destructive cholera.\r\n\r\nIt is worth serious notice medically that in years remarkable for a\r\nlarge yield of Acorns disastrous losses have occurred among\r\nyoung cattle from outbreaks of acorn poisoning, or the acorn\r\ndisease. Those up to two years old suffered most severely, but\r\nsheep, pigs and deer were not affected by this acorn malady. Its\r\nsymptoms are progressive wasting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sore\r\nplaces inside the mouth, discharge from [16] the eyes and nostrils,\r\nexcretion of much pale urine, and no fever, but a fall of\r\ntemperature below the normal standard. Having regard to which\r\ntrain of symptoms it is fair to suppose the acorn will afford in the\r\nhuman subject a useful specific medicine for the marasmus, or\r\nwasting atrophy of young children who are scrofulous. The fruit\r\nshould be given in the form of a tincture, or vegetable extract, or\r\neven admixed (when ground) sparingly with wheaten flour in\r\nbread. The dose should fall short of producing any of the above\r\nsymptoms, and the remedy should be steadily pursued for many\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nThe tincture should be made of saturated strength with spirit of\r\nwine on the bruised acorns, to stand for a fortnight before being\r\ndecanted. Then the dose will be from twenty to thirty drops with\r\nwater three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nThe Acorn contains chemically starch, a fixed oil, citric acid,\r\nuncrystallizable sugar, and another special sugar called \"quercit.\"\r\n\r\nAcorns, when roasted and powdered, have been sometimes employed\r\nas a fair substitute for coffee. By distillation they will\r\nyield an ardent spirit.\r\n\r\nDr. Burnett strongly commends a \"distilled spirit of acorns\" as an\r\nantidote to the effects of alcohol, where the spleen and kidneys\r\nhave already suffered, with induced dropsy. It acts on the principle\r\nof similars, ten drops being given three times a day in water.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of Europe it is customary to place acorns in the\r\nhands of the newly dead; whilst in other districts an apple is put\r\ninto the palm of a child when lying in its little coffin.\r\n\r\nThe bark of an oak tree, and the galls, or apples, produced on its\r\nleaves, or twigs, by an insect named [17] cynips, are very\r\nastringent, by reason of the gallo-tannic acid which they furnish\r\nabundantly. This acid, given as a drug, or the strong decoction of\r\noak bark which contains it, will serve to restrain bleedings if taken\r\ninternally; and finely powdered oak bark, when inhaled pretty\r\nfrequently, has proved very beneficial against consumption of the\r\nlungs in its early stages. Working tanners are well known to be\r\nparticularly exempt from this disease, probably through their\r\nconstantly inhaling the peculiar aroma given off from the tan pits;\r\nand a like effect may be produced by using as snuff the fresh oak\r\nbark dried and reduced to an impalpable powder, or by inhaling\r\nday after day the steam given off from recent oak bark infused in\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nMarble galls are formed on the back of young twigs, artichoke\r\ngalls at their extremities, and currant galls by spangles on the\r\nunder surface of the leaves. From these spangles females presently\r\nemerge, and lay their eggs on the catkins, giving rise to the round\r\nshining currant galls.\r\n\r\nThe Oak--_Quercus robur_--is so named from the Celtic \"quer,\"\r\nbeautiful; and \"cuez,\" a tree. \"Drus,\" another Celtic word for tree,\r\nand particularly for the Oak, gave rise to the terms Dryads and\r\nDruids. Among the Greeks and Romans a chaplet of oak was one\r\nof the highest honours which could be conferred on a citizen.\r\nAncient oaks exist in several parts of England, which are\r\ntraditionally called Gospel oaks, because it was the practice in\r\ntimes long past when beating the bounds of a parish to read a\r\nportion of the Gospel on Ascension Day beneath an oak tree which\r\nwas growing on the boundary line of the district. Cross oaks were\r\nplanted at the juncture of cross roads, so that persons suffering\r\nfrom ague might peg a lock of their hair into the [18] trunks, and\r\nby wrenching themselves away might leave the hair and the\r\nmalady in the tree together. A strong decoction of oak bark is most\r\nusefully applied for prolapse of the lower bowel.\r\n\r\nOak Apple day (May 29th) is called in Hampshire \"Shikshak\" day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRIMONY.\r\n\r\nThe Agrimony is a Simple well known to all country folk, and\r\nabundant throughout England in the fields and woods, as a popular\r\ndomestic medicinal herb. It belongs to the Rose order of plants,\r\nand blossoms from June to September with small yellow flowers,\r\nwhich sit close along slender spikes a foot high, smelling like\r\napricots, and called by the rustics \"Church Steeples.\" Botanically\r\nit bears the names _Agrimonia Eupatoria_, of which the first is\r\nderived from the Greek, and means \"shining,\" because the herb is\r\nthought to cure cataract of the eye; and the second bears reference\r\nto the liver, as indicating the use of this plant for curing diseases\r\nof that organ. Chemists have determined that the Agrimony possesses\r\na particular volatile oil, and yields nearly five per cent. of tannin,\r\nso that its use in the cottage for gargles, and as an astringent\r\napplication to indolent wounds, is well justified. The herb does not\r\nseem really to own any qualities for acting medicinally on the\r\nliver. More probably the yellow colour of its flowers, which, with\r\nthe root, furnish a dye of a bright nankeen hue, has given it a\r\nreputation in bilious disorders, according to the doctrine of\r\nsignatures, because the bile is also yellow. Nevertheless, Gerard\r\nsays: \"A decoction of the leaves is good for them that have\r\nnaughty livers.\" By pouring a pint of boiling water on a handful of\r\nthe plant--stems, flowers and leaves--an [19] excellent gargle may\r\nbe made for a relaxed throat; and a teacupful of the same infusion\r\nmay be taken cold three or four times in the day for simple\r\nlooseness of the bowels; also for passive losses of blood. In\r\nFrance, Agrimony tea is drank as a beverage at table. This herb\r\nformed an ingredient of the genuine arquebusade water, as\r\nprepared against wounds inflicted by an arquebus, or hand-gun,\r\nand it was mentioned by Philip de Comines in his account of the\r\nbattle of Morat, 1476. When the Yeomen of the Guard were first\r\nformed in England--1485--half were armed with bows and arrows,\r\nwhilst the other half carried arquebuses. In France the _eau de\r\narquebusade_ is still applied for sprains and bruises, being\r\ncarefully made from many aromatic herbs. Agrimony was at one\r\ntime included in the London _Materia Medica_ as a vulnerary\r\nherb. It bears the title of Cockleburr, or Sticklewort, because its\r\nseed vessels cling by the hooked ends of their stiff hairs to any\r\nperson or animal coming into contact with the plant. A strong\r\ndecoction of the root and leaves, sweetened with honey, has been\r\ntaken successfully to cure scrofulous sores, being administered\r\ntwo or three times a day in doses of a wineglassful persistently for\r\nseveral months. Perhaps the special volatile oil of the plant, in\r\ncommon with that contained in other herbs similarly aromatic, is\r\ncuratively antiseptic. Pliny called it a herb \"of princely\r\nauthoritie.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Hemp Agrimony_, or St. John's Herb, belongs to the Composite\r\norder of plants, and grows on the margins of brooks, having\r\nhemp-like leaves, which are bitter of taste and pungent of\r\nsmell, as if it were an umbelliferous herb. Because of these\r\nhempen leaves it was formerly called \"Holy Rope,\" being thus\r\nnamed after the rope with which Jesus was bound. They contain a\r\nvolatile [20] oil, which acts on the kidneys; likewise some tannin,\r\nand a bitter chemical principle, which will cut short the chill of\r\nintermittent fever, or perhaps prevent it. Provers of the plant have\r\nfound it produce a \"bilious fever,\" with severe headache, redness of\r\nthe face, nausea, soreness over the liver, constipation, and\r\nhigh-coloured urine. Acting on which experience, a tincture, prepared\r\n(H.) from the whole plant, may be confidently given in frequent\r\nsmall well-diluted doses with water for influenza, or for a similar\r\nfeverish chill, with break-bone pains, prostration, hot dry skin, and\r\nsome bilious vomiting. Likewise a tea made with boiling water\r\npoured on the dried leaves will give prompt relief if taken hot at\r\nthe onset of a bilious catarrh, or of influenza. This plant also is\r\nnamed _Eupatorium_ because it refers, as Pliny says, to Eupator, a\r\nking of Pontus. In Holland it is used for jaundice, with swollen\r\nfeet: and in America it belongs to the tribe of bone-sets. The Hemp\r\nAgrimony grows with us in moist, shady places, with a tall reddish\r\nstem, and with terminal crowded heads of dull lilac flowers. Its\r\ndistinctive title is _Cannabinum_, or \"Hempen,\" whilst by some it\r\nis known as \"Thoroughwort.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANEMONE (Wood).\r\n\r\nThe _Wood Anemone_, or medicinal English _Pulsatilla_, with its\r\nlovely pink white petals, and drooping blossoms, is one of our best\r\nknown and most beautiful spring flowers. Herbalists do not\r\ndistinguish it virtually from the silky-haired _Anemone Pulsatilla_,\r\nwhich medicinal variety is of highly valuable modern curative\r\nuse as a Herbal Simple. The active chemical principles of\r\neach plant are \"anemonin\" and \"anemonic acid.\" A tincture is\r\nmade (H.) with spirit of wine from the entire [21] plant, collected\r\nwhen in flower. This tincture is remarkably beneficial in disorders\r\nof the mucous membranes, alike of the respiratory and of the\r\ndigestive passages. For mucous indigestion following a heavy or\r\nrich meal the tincture of Pulsatilla is almost a specific remedy.\r\nThree or four drops thereof should be given at once with a\r\ntablespoonful of water, hot or cold, and the same dose may be\r\nrepeated after an hour if then still needed. For catarrhal affections\r\nof the eyes and the ears, as well as for catarrhal diarrhoea, the\r\ntincture is very serviceable; also for female monthly difficulties its\r\nuse is always beneficial and safe. As a medicine it best suits\r\npersons of a mild, gentle disposition, and of a lymphatic\r\nconstitution, especially females; it is less appropriate for quick,\r\nexcitable, energetic men. Anemonin, or Pulsatilla Camphor, which\r\nis the active principle of this plant, is prepared by the chemist, and\r\nmay be given in doses of from one fiftieth to one tenth of a grain\r\nrubbed up with dry sugar of milk. Such a dose (or a drop of the\r\ntincture with a tablespoonful of water), given every two or three\r\nhours, will soon relieve a swollen testicle; and the tincture still\r\nmore diluted will ease the bladder difficulties of old men.\r\nFurthermore, the tincture, in doses of two or three drops with a\r\nspoonful of water, will allay spasmodic cough, as of whooping\r\ncough, or bronchitis. The vinegar of Wood Anemone made from\r\nthe leaves retains all the more acrid properties of the plant, and is\r\nput, in France, to many rural domestic purposes. When applied in\r\nlotions every night for five or six times consecutively, it will heal\r\nindolent ulcers; and its rubefacient effects serve instead of those\r\nproduced externally by mustard. If a teaspoonful is sprinkled\r\nwithin the palms and its volatile vapours are inhaled through the\r\nmouth and nose, this [22] will dispel an incipient catarrh. The\r\nname Pulsatilla is a diminutive of the Latin _puls_, a pottage, as\r\nmade from pulse, and used at sacrificial feasts. The title Anemone\r\nsignifies \"wind-flower.\" Pliny says this flower never opens but\r\nwhen the wind is blowing. The title has been misapprehended as\r\n\"an emony.\" Turner says gardeners call the flowers \"emonies\";\r\nand Tennyson, in his \"Northern Farmer,\" tells of the dead keeper\r\nbeing found \"doon in the woild _enemies_ afoor I corned to the\r\nplaice.\" Other names of the plant are Wood Crowfoot, Smell Fox\r\n(Rants), and Flawflower. Alfred Austin says, \"With windflower\r\nhoney are my tresses smoothed.\" It is also called the Passover\r\nFlower, because blossoming at Easter; and it belongs to the\r\nRanunculaceous order of plants. The flower of the Wood Anemone\r\ntells the approach of night, or of a shower, by curling over\r\nits petals like a tent; and it has been said that fairies nestle\r\nwithin, having first pulled the curtains round them. Among the old\r\nRomans, to gather the first Anemone of the year was deemed a\r\npreservative against fever. The Pasque flower, also named\r\nBluemoney and Easter, or Dane's flower, is of a violet blue,\r\ngrowing in chalky pastures, and less common than the Wood\r\nAnemone, but each possesses equally curative virtues.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the Anemone being very light and downy, is blown\r\naway by the first breeze of wind. A ready-witted French senator\r\ntook advantage of this fact while visiting Bacheliere, a covetous\r\nflorist, near Paris, who had long held a secret monopoly of certain\r\nrichly-coloured and splendidly handsome anemones from the East.\r\nVexed to see one man hoard up for himself what ought to be more\r\nwidely distributed, he walked and talked with the florist in his\r\ngarden when the anemone [23] plants were in seed. Whilst thus\r\noccupied, he let fall his robe, as if by accident, upon the flowers,\r\nand so swept off a number of the little feathery seed vessels which\r\nclung to his dependent garment, and which he afterwards cultivated\r\nat home. The petals of the Pasque flower yield a rich green\r\ncolour, which is used For staining Easter eggs, this festival\r\nhaving been termed Pask time in old works, from \"paske,\" a\r\ncrossing over. The plant is said to grow best with iron in the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELICA (also called MASTER-WORT).\r\n\r\nThe wild Angelica grows commonly throughout England in wet\r\nplaces as an umbelliferous plant, with a tall hollow stem, out of\r\nwhich boys like to make pipes. It is purple, furrowed, and downy,\r\nbearing white flowers tinged with pink. But the herb is not useful\r\nas a simple until cultivated in our gardens, the larger variety being\r\nchosen for this purpose, and bearing the name _Archangelica_.\r\n\r\n    \"Angelica, the happy counterbane,\r\n    Sent down from heaven by some celestial scout,\r\n    As well its name and nature both avow't.\"\r\n\r\nIt came to this country from northern latitudes in 1568. The\r\naromatic stems are grown abundantly near London in moist fields\r\nfor the use of confectioners. These stems, when candied, are sold\r\nas a favourite sweetmeat. They are grateful to the feeble stomach,\r\nand will relieve flatulence promptly. The roots of the garden\r\nAngelica contain plentifully a peculiar resin called \"angelicin,\"\r\nwhich is stimulating to the lungs, and to the skin: they smell\r\npleasantly of musk, being an excellent tonic and carminative. An\r\ninfusion of the plant may be made by pouring a pint of boiling\r\nwater on an ounce of the bruised root, and two tablespoonfuls [24]\r\nof this should be given three or four times in the day; or the\r\npowdered root may be administered in doses of from ten to thirty\r\ngrains. The infusion will relieve flatulent stomach-ache, and will\r\npromote menstruation if retarded. It is also of use as a stimulating\r\nbronchial tonic in the catarrh of aged and feeble persons. Angelica,\r\ntaken in either medicinal form, is said to cause a disgust for\r\nspirituous liquors. In high Dutch it is named the root of the Holy\r\nGhost. The fruit is employed for flavouring some cordials, notably\r\nChartreuse. If an incision is made in the bark of the stems, and the\r\ncrown of the root, at the commencement of spring, a resinous gum\r\nexudes with a special aromatic flavour as of musk or benzoin, for\r\neither of which it can be substituted. Gerard says: \"If you do but\r\ntake a piece of the root, and hold it in your mouth, or chew the\r\nsame between your teeth, it doth most certainly drive away\r\npestilent aire.\" Icelanders eat both the stem and the roots raw with\r\nbutter. These parts of the plant, if wounded, yield a yellow juice\r\nwhich becomes, when dried, a valuable medicine beneficial in\r\nchronic rheumatism and gout. Some have said the Archangelica\r\nwas revealed in a dream by an angel to cure the plague; others\r\naver that it blooms on the day of Michael the Archangel (May 8th,\r\nold style), and is therefore a preservative against evil spirits and\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANISEED.\r\n\r\nThe Anise (_Pimpinella_), from \"bipenella,\" because of its\r\nsecondary, feather-like leaflets, belongs to the umbelliferous\r\nplants, and is cultivated in our gardens; but its aromatic seeds\r\nchiefly come from Germany. The careful housewife will do well\r\nalways to have a [25] supply of this most useful Simple closely\r\nbottled in her store cupboard. The herb is a variety of the Burnet\r\nSaxifrage, and yields an essential oil of a fine blue colour. To\r\nmake the essence of Aniseed one part of the oil should be mixed\r\nwith four parts of spirit of wine. This oil, by its chemical basis,\r\n\"anethol,\" represents the medicinal properties of the plant. It has a\r\nspecial influence on the bronchial tubes to encourage expectoration,\r\nparticularly with children. For infantile catarrh, after\r\nits first feverish stage, Aniseed tea is very useful. It should be\r\nmade by pouring half-a-pint of boiling water on two teaspoonfuls\r\nof the seeds, bruised in a mortar, and given when cold in doses of\r\none, two, or three teaspoonfuls, according to the age of the child.\r\nFor the relief of flatulent stomach-ache, whether in children or in\r\nadults, from five to fifteen drops of the essence may be given on a\r\nlump of sugar, or mixed with two dessertspoonfuls of hot water.\r\nGerard says: \"The Aniseed helpeth the yeoxing, or hicket\r\n(hiccough), and should be given to young children to eat which are\r\nlike to have the falling sickness, or to such as have it by patrimony\r\nor succession.\" The odd literary mistake has been sometimes made\r\nof regarding Aniseed as a plural noun: thus, in \"The Englishman's\r\nDoctor,\" it is said, \"Some anny seeds be sweet, and some bitter.\"\r\nAn old epithet of the Anise was, _Solamen intestinorum_--\"The\r\ncomforter of the bowels.\" The Germans have an almost superstitious\r\nbelief in the medicinal virtues of Aniseed, and all their\r\nordinary household bread is plentifully flavoured with the\r\nwhole seeds. The mustaceoe, or spiced cakes of the Romans,\r\nintroduced at the close of a rich entertainment, to prevent\r\nindigestion, consisted of meal, with anise, cummin, and other\r\naromatics used for staying putrescence or fermentation within the\r\n[26] intestines. Such a cake was commonly brought in at the end\r\nof a marriage feast; and hence the bridecake of modern times has taken\r\nits origin, though the result of eating this is rather to provoke\r\ndyspepsia than to prevent it. Formerly, in the East, these seeds\r\nwere in use as part payment of taxes: \"Ye pay tithe of mint, anise\r\n[dill?], and cummin!\" The oil destroys lice and the itch insect, for\r\nwhich purpose it may be mixed with lard or spermaceti as an\r\nointment. The seed has been used for smoking, so as to promote\r\nexpectoration.\r\n\r\nBesides containing the volatile oil, Aniseed yields phosphates,\r\nmalates, gum, and a resin. The leaves, if applied externally, will\r\nhelp to remove freckles; and, \"Let me tell you this,\" says a\r\npractical writer of the present day, \"if you are suffering from\r\nbronchitis, with attacks of spasmodic asthma, just send for a bottle\r\nof the liqueur called 'Anisette,' and take a dram of it with a little\r\nwater. You will find it an immediate palliative; you will cease\r\nbarking like Cerberus; you will be soothed, and go to sleep.\"--\r\n_Experto crede!_ \"I have been bronchitic and asthmatic for twenty\r\nyears, and have never known an alleviative so immediately\r\nefficacious as 'Anisette.'\"\r\n\r\nFor the restlessness of languid digestion, a dose of essence of\r\nAniseed in hot water at bedtime is much to be commended. In the\r\n_Paregoric Elixir_, or \"Compound Tincture of Camphor,\" prescribed\r\nas a sedative cordial by doctors (and containing some opium),\r\nthe oil of Anise is also included--thirty drops in a pint of\r\nthe tincture. This oil is of capital service as a bait for mice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Apple\" was applied by the ancients indiscriminately to\r\nalmost every kind of round fleshy fruit, [27] such as the\r\nthornapple, the pineapple, and the loveapple. Paris gave to Venus\r\na golden apple; Atalanta lost her classic race by staying to pick up\r\nan apple; the fruit of the Hesperides, guarded by a sleepless\r\ndragon, were golden apples; and through the same fruit befell\r\n\"man's first disobedience,\" bringing \"death into the world and all\r\nour woe\" (concerning which the old Hebrew myth runs that the\r\napple of Eden, as the first fermentable fruit known to mankind,\r\nwas the beginner of intoxicating drinks, which led to the\r\nknowledge of good and evil).\r\n\r\nNothing need be said here about the Apple as an esculent; we have\r\nonly to deal with this eminently English, and most serviceable\r\nfruit in its curative and remedial aspects. Chemically, the Apple is\r\ncomposed of vegetable fibre, albumen, sugar, gum, chlorophyll,\r\nmalic acid, gallic acid, lime, and much water. Furthermore,\r\nGerman analysts say that the Apple contains a larger percentage of\r\nphosphorus than any other fruit or vegetable. This phosphorus is\r\nspecially adapted for renewing the essential nervous \"lethicin\" of\r\nthe brain and spinal cord. Old Scandinavian traditions represent\r\nthe Apple as the food of the gods, who, when they felt themselves\r\ngrowing feeble and infirm, resorted to this fruit for renewing their\r\npowers of mind and body. Also the acids of the Apple are of signal\r\nuse for men of sedentary habits, whose livers are sluggish of\r\naction; they help to eliminate from the body noxious matters,\r\nwhich, if retained, would make the brain heavy and dull, or\r\nproduce jaundice, or skin eruptions, or other allied troubles. Some\r\nexperience of this sort has led to the custom of our taking Apple\r\nsauce with roast pork, roast goose, and similar rich dishes. The\r\nmalic acid of ripe Apples, raw or cooked, will neutralize the\r\nchalky matter engendered in gouty subjects, particularly from [28]\r\nan excess of meat eating. A good, ripe, raw Apple is one of the\r\neasiest of vegetable substances for the stomach to deal with, the\r\nwhole process of its digestion being completed in eighty-five\r\nminutes. Furthermore, a certain aromatic principle is possessed by\r\nthe Apple, on which its peculiar flavour depends, this being a\r\nfragrant essential oil--the valerianate of amyl--in a small but\r\nappreciable quantity. It can be made artificially by the chemist,\r\nand used for imparting the flavour of apples to sweetmeats and\r\nconfectionery. Gerard found that \"the pulp of roasted Apples,\r\nmixed in a wine quart of faire water, and laboured together until it\r\ncomes to be as Apples and ale--which we call lambswool (Celtic,\r\n'the day of Apple fruit')--never faileth in certain diseases of the\r\nraines, which myself hath often proved, and gained thereby both\r\ncrownes and credit.\" Also, \"The paring of an Apple cut somewhat\r\nthick, and the inside whereof is laid to hot, burning or running\r\neyes at night when the party goes to bed, and is tied or bound to\r\nthe same, doth help the trouble very speedily, and, contrary to\r\nexpectation, an excellent secret.\" A poultice made of rotten Apples\r\nis commonly used in Lincolnshire for the cure of weak, or\r\nrheumatic eyes. Likewise in the _Hotel des Invalides_, at Paris, an\r\nApple poultice is employed for inflamed eyes, the apple being\r\nroasted, and its pulp applied over the eyes without any intervening\r\nsubstance To obviate constipation two or three Apples taken at\r\nnight, whether baked or raw, are admirably efficient. It was said\r\nlong ago: \"They do easily and speedily pass through the belly,\r\ntherefore they do mollify the belly,\" and for this reason a modern\r\nmaxim teaches that:--\r\n\r\n    \"To eat an Apple going to bed\r\n    Will make the doctor beg his bread.\"\r\n\r\n[29] There was concocted in Gerard's day an ointment with the\r\npulpe of Apples, and swine's grease, and rosewater, which was\r\nused to beautifie the face, and to take away the roughnesse of the\r\nskin, and which was called in the shops \"pomatum,\" from the\r\napples, \"poma,\" whereof it was prepared. As varieties of the\r\nApple, mention is made in documents of the twelfth century, of\r\nthe pearmain, and the costard, from the latter of which has come\r\nthe word costardmonger, as at first a dealer in this fruit, and now\r\napplied to our costermonger. Caracioli, an Italian writer, declared\r\nthat the only ripe fruit he met with in Britain was a _baked_ apple.\r\nThe juices of Apples are matured and lose their rawness by\r\nkeeping the fruit a certain time. These juices, together with those\r\nof the pear, the peach, the plum, and other such fruits, if taken\r\nwithout adding cane sugar, diminish acidity in the stomach rather\r\nthan provoke it: they become converted chemically into alkaline\r\ncarbonates, which correct sour fermentation. It is said in\r\nDevonshire that apples shrump up if picked when the moon is on\r\nthe wane. From the bark of the stem and root of the apple, pear\r\nand plum trees, a glucoside is to be obtained in small crystals,\r\nwhich possesses the peculiar property of producing artificial\r\ndiabetes in animals to whom it is given.\r\n\r\nThe juice of a sour Apple, if rubbed on warts first pared away to\r\nthe quick, will serve to cure them. The wild \"Scrab,\" or Crab\r\nApple, armed with thorns, grows in our fields and hedgerows,\r\nfurnishing verjuice, which is rich in tannin, and a most useful\r\napplication for old sprains. In the United States of America an\r\ninfusion of apple tree bark is given with benefit during\r\nintermittent, remittent, and bilious fevers. We likewise prescribe\r\nApple water as a grateful cooling drink for [29] feverish patients.\r\nFrancatelli directs that it should be made thus: \"Slice up thinly\r\nthree or four Apples without peeling them, and boil them in a very\r\nclean saucepan, with a quart of water and a little sugar until the\r\nslices of apple become soft; the apple water must then be strained\r\nthrough a piece of muslin, or clean rag, into a jug, and drank when\r\ncold.\" If desired, a small piece of the yellow rind of a lemon may\r\nbe added, just enough to give it a flavour.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1562 a certain rector of St. Ives, in Cornwall, the\r\nRev. Mr. Attwell, practised physic with milk and Apples so\r\nsuccessfully in many diseases, and so spread his reputation, that\r\nnumerous sufferers came to him from all the neighbouring\r\ncounties. In Germany ripe Apples are applied to warts for\r\nremoving them, by reason of the earthy salts, particularly the\r\nmagnesia, of the fruit. It is a fact, though not generally known, that\r\nmagnesia, as occurring in ordinary Epsom salts, will cure obstinate\r\nwarts, and the disposition thereto. Just a few grains, from three to\r\nsix, not enough to produce any sensible medicinal effect, taken\r\nonce a day for three or four weeks, will surely dispel a crop of\r\nwarts. Old cheese ameliorates Apples if eaten when crude,\r\nprobably by reason of the volatile alkali, or ammonia of the cheese\r\nneutralizing the acids of the Apple. Many persons make a practice\r\nof eating cheese with Apple pie. The \"core\" of an Apple is so\r\nnamed from the French word, _coeur_, \"heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe juice of the cultivated Apple made by fermentation into cider,\r\nwhich means literally \"strong drink,\" was pronounced by John\r\nEvelyn, in his _Pomona_, 1729, to be \"in a word the most\r\nwholesome drink in Europe, as specially sovereign against the\r\nscorbute, the stone, spleen, and what not.\" This beverage [31]\r\ncontains alcohol (on the average a little over five per cent.), gum,\r\nsugar, mineral matters, and several acids, among which the malic\r\npredominates. As an habitual drink, if sweet, it is apt to provoke\r\nacid fermentation with a gouty subject, and to develop rheumatism.\r\nNevertheless, Dr. Nash, of Worcester, attributed to cider\r\ngreat virtues in leading to longevity; and a Herefordshire\r\nvicar bears witness to its superlative merits thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"All the Gallic wines are not so boon\r\n    As hearty cider;--that strong son of wood\r\n    In fullest tides refines and purges blood;\r\n    Becomes a known Bethesda, whence arise\r\n    Full certain cures for spit tall maladies:\r\n    Death slowly can the citadel invade;\r\n    A draught of this bedulls his scythe, and spade.\"\r\n\r\nMedical testimony goes to show that in countries where cider--not\r\nof the sweet sort--is the common beverage, stone, or calculus,\r\nis unknown; and a series of enquiries among the doctors of\r\nNormandy, a great Apple country, where cider is the principal, if\r\nnot the sole drink, brought to light the fact that not a single case\r\nhad been met with there in forty years. Cider Apples were\r\nintroduced by the Normans; and the beverage began to be brewed\r\nin 1284. The Hereford orchards were first planted \"tempore\"\r\nCharles I.\r\n\r\nA chance case of stone in the bladder if admitted into a\r\nDevonshire or a Herefordshire Hospital, is regarded by the\r\nsurgeons there as a sort of professional curiosity, probably\r\nimported from a distance. So that it may be fairly surmised that the\r\nhabitual use of natural unsweetened cider keeps held in solution\r\nmaterials which are otherwise liable to be separated in a solid form\r\nby the kidneys.\r\n\r\nPippins are apples which have been raised from pips; [32] a\r\ncodling is an apple which requires to be \"coddled,\" stewed, or\r\nlightly boiled, being yet sour and unfit for eating whilst raw. The\r\nJohn Apple, or Apple John, ripens on St. John's Day, December\r\n27th. It keeps sound for two years, but becomes very shrunken. Sir\r\nJohn Falstaff says (_Henry IV_., iii. 3) \"Withered like an old\r\nApple John.\" The squab pie, famous in Cornwall, contains apples\r\nand onions allied with mutton.\r\n\r\n    \"Of wheaten walls erect your paste:\r\n    Let the round mass extend its breast;\r\n    Next slice your apples picked so fresh;\r\n    Let the fat sheep supply its flesh:\r\n    Then add an onion's pungent juice--\r\n    A sprinkling--be not too profuse!\r\n    Well mixt, these nice ingredients--sure!\r\n    May gratify an epicure.\"\r\n\r\nIn America, \"Apple Slump\" is a pie consisting of apples, molasses,\r\nand bread crumbs baked in a tin pan. This is known to New\r\nEnglanders as \"Pan Dowdy.\" An agreeable bread was at one time\r\nmade by an ingenious Frenchman which consisted of one third of\r\napples boiled, and two-thirds of wheaten flour.\r\n\r\nIt was through the falling of an apple in the garden of Mrs.\r\nConduitt at Woolthorpe, near Grantham, Sir Isaac Newton was led\r\nto discover the great law of gravitation which regulates the whole\r\nuniverse. Again, it was an apple the patriot William Tell shot from\r\nthe head of his own bright boy with one arrow, whilst reserving a\r\nsecond for the heart of a tyrant. Dr. Prior says the word Apple took\r\nits origin from the Sanskrit, _Ap_,--\"water,\" and _Phal_,--\"fruit,\"\r\nmeaning \"water fruit,\" or \"juice fruit\"; and with this the Latin\r\nname _Pomum_--from _Poto_, \"to drink\"--precisely agrees; if\r\nwhich be so, our apple must have come originally from the East\r\nlong ages back.\r\n\r\n[33] The term \"Apple-pie order\" is derived from the French\r\nphrase, _a plis_, \"in plaits,\" folded in regular plaits; or, perhaps,\r\nfrom _cap a pied_, \"armed from head to foot,\" in perfect order.\r\nLikewise the \"Apple-pie bed\" is so called from the French _a\r\nplis_, or it may be from the Apple turnover of Devon and\r\nCornwall, as made with the paste turned over on itself.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name of an apple tree is Pyrus Malus, of which\r\nschoolboys are wont to make ingenious uses by playing on the\r\nlatter word. Malo, I had rather be; Malo, in an Apple tree; Malo,\r\nthan a wicked man; Malo, in adversity. Or, again, _Mea mater\r\nmala est sus_, which bears the easy translation, \"My mother is a\r\nwicked old sow\"; but the intentional reading of which signifies\r\n\"Run, mother! the sow is eating the apples.\" The term \"Adam's\r\nApple,\" which is applied to the most prominent part of a person's\r\nthroat in front is based on the superstition that a piece of the\r\nforbidden fruit stuck in Adam's throat, and caused this lump to\r\nremain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARUM--THE COMMON.\r\n\r\nThe \"lords and ladies\" (_arum maculatum_) so well known to\r\nevery rustic as common throughout Spring in almost every hedge\r\nrow, has acquired its name from the colour of its erect pointed\r\nspike enclosed within the curled hood of an upright arrow-shaped\r\nleaf. This is purple or cream hued, according to the accredited sex\r\nof the plant. It bears further the titles of Cuckoo Pint, Wake Robin,\r\nParson in the Pulpit, Rampe, Starchwort, Arrowroot, Gethsemane,\r\nBloody Fingers, Snake's Meat, Adam and Eve, Calfsfoot, Aaron,\r\nand Priest's Pintle. The red spots on its glossy emerald arrow-head\r\nleaves, are attributed to the dropping of our Saviour's blood on\r\n[34] the plant whilst growing at the foot of the cross. Several of\r\nthe above appellations bear reference to the stimulating effects of\r\nthe herb on the sexual organs. Its tuberous root has been found to\r\ncontain a particular volatile acrid principle which exercises distinct\r\nmedicinal effects, though these are altogether dissipated if the\r\nroots are subjected to heat by boiling or baking. When tasted, the\r\nfresh juice causes an acrid burning irritation of the mouth and\r\nthroat; also, if swallowed it will produce a red raw state of the\r\npalate and tongue, with cracked lips. The leaves, when applied\r\nexternally to a delicate skin will blister it. Accordingly a tincture\r\nmade (H.) from the plant and its root proves curative in diluted\r\ndoses for a chronic sore throat, with swollen mucous membrane,\r\nand vocal hoarseness, such as is often known as \"Clergyman's\r\nSore Throat,\" and likewise for a feverish sore mouth, as well as for\r\nan irresistible tendency to sleepiness, and heaviness after a full\r\nmeal. From five to ten drops of the tincture, third decimal strength,\r\nshould be given with a tablespoonful of cold water to an adult\r\nthree times a day. An ointment made by stewing the fresh sliced\r\nroot with lard serves efficiently for the cure of ringworm.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice yields malate of lime, whilst the plant contains\r\ngum, sugar, starch and fat. The name Arum is derived from the\r\nHebrew _jaron_, \"a dart,\" in allusion to the shape of the leaves like\r\nspear heads; or, as some think, from _aur_, \"fire,\" because of the\r\nacrid juice. The adjective _maculatum _refers to the dark spots or\r\npatches which are seen on the smooth shining leaves of the plant.\r\nThese leaves have sometimes proved fatal to children who have\r\nmistaken them for sorrel. The brilliant scarlet coral-like berries\r\nwhich are found set closely about the erect spike of the arum in the\r\nautumn [35] are known to country lads as adder's meat--a name\r\ncorrupted from the Anglo-Saxon _attor_, \"poison,\" as originally\r\napplied to these berries, though it is remarkable that pheasants can\r\neat them with impunity.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Elizabeth's time the Arum was known as starch-wort\r\nbecause the roots were then used for supplying pure white starch\r\nto stiffen the ruffs and frills worn at that time by gallants and\r\nladies. This was obtained by boiling or baking the roots, and thus\r\ndispelling their acridity. When dried and powdered the root\r\nconstitutes the French cosmetic, \"Cypress Powder.\" Recently a\r\npatented drug, \"Tonga,\" has obtained considerable notoriety for\r\ncuring obstinate neuralgia of the head and face--this turning\r\nout to be the dried scraped stem of an aroid (or arum) called\r\nRaphidophora Vitiensis, belonging to the Fiji Islands. Acting on\r\nthe knowledge of which fact some recent experimenters have tried\r\nthe fresh juice expressed from our common Arum Maculatum in a\r\nsevere case of neuralgia which could be relieved previously only\r\nby Tonga: and it was found that this juice in doses of a teaspoonful\r\ngave similar relief. The British Domestic Herbal, of Sydenham's\r\ntime, describes a case of alarming dropsy, with great constitutional\r\nexhaustion treated most successfully with a medicine composed of\r\nArum and Angelica, which cured in about three weeks. The\r\n\"English Passion Flower\" and \"Portland Sago\" are other names\r\ngiven to the Arum Maculatum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\nThe Asparagus, belonging to the Lily order of plants, occurs wild\r\non the coasts of Essex, Suffolk, and Cornwall. It is there a more\r\nprickly plant than the cultivated vegetable which we grow for the\r\nsake of the tender, [36] edible shoots. The Greeks and Romans\r\nvalued it for their tables, and boiled it so quickly that _velocius\r\nquam asparagi coquuntur_--\"faster than asparagus is cooked\"--was\r\na proverb with them, to which our \"done in a jiffy\" closely\r\ncorresponds. The shoots, whether wild or cultivated, are succulent,\r\nand contain wax, albumen, acetate of potash, phosphate of potash,\r\nmannite, a green resin, and a fixed principle named \"asparagin.\"\r\nThis asparagin stimulates the kidneys, and imparts a peculiar,\r\nstrong smell to the urine after taking the shoots; at the same time,\r\nthe green resin with which the asparagin is combined, exercises\r\ngently sedative effects on the heart, calming palpitation, or\r\nnervous excitement of that organ. Though not producing actual\r\nsugar in the urine, asparagus forms and excretes a substance\r\ntherein which answers to the reactions used by physicians for\r\ndetecting sugar, except the fermentation test. It may fairly be given\r\nin diabetes with a promise of useful results. In Russia it is a\r\ndomestic medicine for the arrest of flooding.\r\n\r\nAsparagin also bears the chemical name of \"althein,\" and occurs\r\nin crystals, which may be reduced to powder, and which may\r\nlikewise be got from the roots of marsh mallow, and liquorice.\r\nOne grain of this given three times a day is of service for relieving\r\ndropsy from disease of the heart. Likewise, a medicinal tincture is\r\nmade (H.) from the whole plant, of which eight or ten drops given\r\nwith a tablespoonful of water three times a day will also allay\r\nurinary irritation, whilst serving to do good against rheumatic\r\ngout. A syrup of asparagus is employed medicinally in France: and\r\nat Aix-les-Bains it forms part of the cure for rheumatic patients to\r\neat Asparagus. The roots of Asparagus contain diuretic virtues\r\nmore abundantly than the shoots. An infusion [37] made from\r\nthese roots will assist against jaundice, and congestive torpor of\r\nthe liver. The shrubby stalks of the plant bear red, coral-like\r\nberries which, when ripe, yield grape sugar, and spargancin.\r\nThough generally thought to branch out into feathery leaves, these\r\nare only ramified stalks substituted by the plant when growing on\r\nan arid sandy soil, where no moisture could be got for the\r\nmaintenance of leaves. The berries are attractive to small birds,\r\nwho swallow them whole, and afterwards void the seeds, to\r\ngerminate when thus scattered about. Thus there is some valid\r\nreason for the vulgar corruption of the title Asparagus into\r\nSparrowgrass, or Grass. Botanically the plant is a lily which has\r\nseen better days. In the United States of America, Asparagus is\r\nthought to be undeniably sedative, and a palliative in all heart\r\naffections attended with excited action of the pulse. The water in\r\nwhich asparagus has been boiled, if drunk, though somewhat\r\ndisagreeable, is beneficial against rheumatism. The cellular tissue\r\nof the plant furnishes a substance similar to sago. In Venice, the\r\nwild asparagus is served at table, but it is strong in flavour and\r\nless succulent than the cultivated sort. Mortimer Collins makes Sir\r\nClare, one of his characters in _Clarisse_ say: \"Liebig, or\r\nsome other scientist maintains that asparagin--the alkaloid in\r\nasparagus-develops _form_ in the human brain: so, if you get\r\nhold of an artistic child, and give him plenty of asparagus, he\r\nwill grow into a second Raffaelle!\"\r\n\r\nGerard calls the plant \"Sperage,\" \"which is easily concocted when\r\neaten, and doth gently loose the belly.\" Our name, \"Asparagus,\" is\r\nderived from a Greek word signifying \"the tearer,\" in allusion to\r\nthe spikes of some species; or perhaps from the Persian \"Spurgas,\"\r\na shoot.\r\n\r\n[38] John Evelyn, in his _Book of Salads_, derives the term\r\nAsparagus in easy fashion, _ab asperitate_, \"from the sharpness of\r\nthe plant.\" \"Nothing,\" says he, \"next to flesh is more nourishing;\r\nbut in this country we overboil them, and dispel their volatile salts:\r\nthe water should boil before they are put in.\" He tells of asparagus\r\nraised at Battersea in a natural, sweet, and well-cultivated soil,\r\nsixteen of which (each one weighing about four ounces) were\r\nmade a present to his wife, showing what \"solum, coelum, and\r\nindustry will effect.\" The Asparagus first came into use as a food\r\nabout 200 B.C., in the time of the elder Cato, and Augustus was\r\nvery partial to it. The wild Asparagus was called Lybicum, and by\r\nthe Athenians, Horminium. Roman cooks used to dry the shoots,\r\nand when required these were thrown into hot water, and boiled\r\nfor a few minutes to make them look fresh and green. Gerard\r\nadvises that asparagus should be sodden in flesh broth, and eaten;\r\nor boiled in fair water, seasoned with oil, pepper, and vinegar,\r\nbeing served up as a salad. Our ancestors in Tudor times ate the\r\nwhole of the stalks with spoons. Swift's patron, Sir William\r\nTemple, who had been British Minister at the Hague, brought the\r\nart of Asparagus culture from Holland; and when William III.\r\nvisited Sir William at Moor Park, where young Jonathan was\r\ndomiciled as Secretary, his Majesty is said to have taught the\r\nfuture Dean of St. Patrick's how to eat asparagus in the Dutch\r\nstyle. Swift afterwards at his own table refused a second helping of\r\nthe vegetable to a guest until the stalks had been devoured,\r\nalleging that \"King William always ate his stalks.\" When the large\r\nwhite asparagus first came into vogue, it was known as the \"New\r\nVegetable.\" This was grown with lavish manure and was called\r\nDutch Asparagus. For [39] cooking the stalks should be cut of\r\nequal lengths, and boiled standing upwards in a deep saucepan\r\nwith nearly two inches of the heads out of the water. Then the\r\nsteam will suffice to cook these tender parts, whilst the hard\r\nstalky portions may be boiled long enough to become soft and\r\nsucculently wholesome. Two sorts of asparagus are now grown--\r\nthe one an early kind, pinkish white, cultivated in France and the\r\nChannel Islands; the other green and English. At Kynance Cove in\r\nCornwall, there is an island called Asparagus Island, from the\r\nabundance in which the plant is found there.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this popular vegetable may be quoted the\r\nfollowing riddle:--\r\n\r\n    \"What killed a queen to love inclined,\r\n    What on a beggar oft we find,\r\n    Show--to ourselves if aptly joined,\r\n    A plant which we in bundles bind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBALM.\r\n\r\nThe herb Balm, or _Melissa_, which is cultivated quite commonly\r\nin our cottage gardens, has its origin in the wild, or bastard Balm,\r\ngrowing in our woods, especially in the South of England, and\r\nbearing the name of \"Mellitis.\" Each is a labiate plant, and\r\n\"Bawme,\" say the Arabians, \"makes the heart merry and joyful.\"\r\nThe title, \"Balm,\" is an abbreviation of Balsam, which signifies\r\n\"the chief of sweet-smelling oils;\" Hebrew, _Bal smin_, \"chief of\r\noils\"; and the botanical suffix, _Melissa_, bears reference to the\r\nlarge quantity of honey (_mel_) contained in the flowers of this\r\nherb.\r\n\r\nWhen cultivated, it yields from its leaves and tops an essential oil\r\nwhich includes a chemical principle, or \"stearopten.\" \"The juice of\r\nBalm,\" as Gerard tells us, \"glueth together greene wounds,\" and\r\nthe leaves, say [40] both Pliny and Dioscorides, \"being applied, do\r\nclose up woundes without any perill of inflammation.\" It is now\r\nknown as a scientific fact that the balsamic oils of aromatic plants\r\nmake most excellent surgical dressings. They give off ozone, and\r\nthus exercise anti-putrescent effects. Moreover, as chemical\r\n\"hydrocarbons,\" they contain so little oxygen, that in wounds\r\ndressed with the fixed balsamic herbal oils, the atomic germs of\r\ndisease are starved out. Furthermore, the resinous parts of these\r\nbalsamic oils, as they dry upon the sore or wound, seal it up, and\r\neffectually exclude all noxious air. So the essential oils of balm,\r\npeppermint, lavender, and the like, with pine oil, resin of\r\nturpentine, and the balsam of benzoin (Friars' Balsam) should\r\nserve admirably for ready application on lint or fine rag to cuts and\r\nsuperficial sores. In domestic surgery, the lamentation of Jeremiah\r\nfalls to the ground: \"Is there no balm in Gilead: is there no\r\nphysician there?\" Concerning which \"balm of Gilead,\" it may be\r\nhere told that it was formerly of great esteem in the East as a\r\nmedicine, and as a fragrant unguent. It was the true balsam of\r\nJudea, which at one time grew nowhere else in the whole world\r\nbut at Jericho. But when the Turks took the Holy Land, they\r\ntransplanted this balsam to Grand Cairo, and guarded its shrubs\r\nmost jealously by Janissaries during the time the balsam was\r\nflowing.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Treacle Bible,\" 1584, Jeremiah viii., v. 22, this passage is\r\nrendered: \"Is there not treacle at Gylead?\" Venice treacle, or\r\ntriacle, was a famous antidote in the middle ages to all animal\r\npoisons. It was named _Theriaca_ (the Latin word for our present\r\ntreacle) from the Greek word _Therion_, a small animal, in\r\nallusion to the vipers which were added to the triacle by\r\nAndromachus, physician to the emperor Nero.\r\n\r\n[41] Tea made of our garden balm, by virtue of the volatile oil,\r\nwill prove restorative, and will promote perspiration if taken hot\r\non the access of a cold or of influenza; also, if used in like manner,\r\nit will help effectively to bring on the delayed monthly flow with\r\nwomen. But an infusion of the plant made with cold water, acts\r\nbetter as a remedy for hysterical headache, and as a general\r\nnervine stimulant because the volatile aromatic virtues are not\r\ndispelled by heat. Formerly, a spirit of balm, combined with lemon\r\npeel, nutmeg, and angelica-root, enjoyed a great reputation as a\r\nrestorative cordial under the name of Carmelite water. Paracelsus\r\nthought so highly of balm that he believed it would completely\r\nrevivify a man, as _primum ens melissoe_. The London Dispensatory\r\nof 1696 said: \"The essence of balm given in Canary wine every\r\nmorning will renew youth, strengthen the brain, relieve languishing\r\nnature, and prevent baldness.\" \"Balm,\" adds John Evelyn, \"is\r\nsovereign for the brain, strengthening the memory, and powerfully\r\nchasing away melancholy.\" In France, women bruise the young shoots\r\nof balm, and make them into cakes, with eggs, sugar, and rose\r\nwater, which they give to mothers in childbed as a strengthener.\r\n\r\nIt is fabled that the Jew Ahasuerus (who refused a cup of water to\r\nour Saviour on His way to Golgotha, and was therefore doomed to\r\nwander athirst until Christ should come again) on a Whitsuntide\r\nevening, asked for a draught of small beer at the door of a\r\nStaffordshire cottager who was far advanced in consumption. He\r\ngot the drink, and out of gratitude advised the sick man to gather\r\nin the garden three leaves of Balm, and to put them into a cup of\r\nbeer. This was to be repeated every fourth day for twelve days, the\r\nrefilling of the cup to be continued as often as might be wished;\r\nthen \"the [42] disease shall be cured and thy body altered.\" So\r\nsaying, the Jew departed and was never seen there again. But the\r\ncottager obeyed the injunction, and at the end of the twelve days\r\nhad become a sound man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe Common Barberry (_Berberis_), which gives its name to a\r\nspecial order of plants, grows wild as a shrub in our English\r\ncopses and hedges, particularly about Essex, being so called from\r\nBerberin, a pearl oyster, because the leaves are glossy like the\r\ninside of an oyster shell. It is remarkable for the light colour of its\r\nbark, which is yellow inside, and for its three-forked spines.\r\nProvincially it is also termed Pipperidge-bush, from \"pepin,\" a pip,\r\nand \"rouge,\" red, as descriptive of its small scarlet juiceless fruit,\r\nof which the active chemical principles, as well as of the bark, are\r\n\"berberin\" and \"oxyacanthin.\" The sparingly-produced juice of the\r\nberries is cooling and astringent. It was formerly held in high\r\nesteem by the Egyptians, when diluted as a drink, in pestilential\r\nfevers. The inner, yellow bark, which has been long believed to\r\nexercise a medicinal effect on the liver, because of its colour, is a\r\ntrue biliary purgative. An infusion of this bark, made with boiling\r\nwater, is useful in jaundice from congestive liver, with furred\r\ntongue, lowness of spirits, and yellow complexion; also for\r\nswollen spleen from malarious exposure. A medicinal tincture (H.)\r\nis made of the root-branches and the root-bark, with spirit of wine;\r\nand if given three or four times a day in doses of five drops with\r\none tablespoonful of cold water, it will admirably rouse the liver to\r\nhealthy and more vigorous action. Conversely the tincture when of\r\nreduced strength will stay bilious diarrhoea. British farmers dislike\r\nthe [43] Barberry shrub because, when it grows in cornfields, the\r\nwheat near it is blighted, even to the distance of two or three\r\nhundred yards. This is because of a special fungus which is\r\ncommon to the Barberry, and being carried by the wind reproduces\r\nitself by its spores destructively on the ears of wheat, the\r\nAEcidium Berberidis, which generates Puccinia.\r\n\r\nClusius setteth it down as a wonderful secret which he had from a\r\nfriend, \"that if the yellow bark of Barberry be steeped in white\r\nwine for three hours, and be afterwards drank, it will purge one\r\nvery marvellously.\"\r\n\r\nThe berries upon old Barberry shrubs are often stoneless, and this\r\nis the best fruit for preserving or for making the jelly. They\r\ncontain malic and citric acids; and it is from these berries that the\r\ndelicious _confitures d'epine vinette_, for which Rouen is famous,\r\nare commonly prepared. And the same berries are chosen in\r\nEngland to furnish the kernel for a very nice sugar-plum. The\r\nsyrup of Barberries will make with water an excellent astringent\r\ngargle for raw, irritable sore throat; likewise the jelly gives famous\r\nrelief for this catarrhal affection. It is prepared by boiling the\r\nberries, when ripe, with an equal weight of sugar, and then\r\nstraining. For an attack of colic because of gravel in the kidneys,\r\nfive drops of the tincture on sugar every five minutes will\r\npromptly relieve, as likewise when albumen is found by analysis\r\nin the urine.\r\n\r\nA noted modern nostrum belauds the virtues of the Barberry as\r\nspecific against bile, heartburn, and the black jaundice, this being\r\na remedy which was \"discovered after infinite pains by one who\r\nhad studied for thirty years by candle light for the good of his\r\ncountrymen.\" In Gerard's time at the village of Ivor, near\r\nColebrooke, most of the hedges consisted solely of Barberry\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\n[44] The following is a good old receipt for making Barberry\r\njam:--Pick the fruit from the stalks, and bake it in an earthen pan;\r\nthen press it through a sieve with a wooden spoon. Having mixed equal\r\nweights of the prepared fruit, and of powdered sugar, put these\r\ntogether in pots, and cover the mixture up, setting them in a dry\r\nplace, and having sifted some powdered sugar over the top of each\r\npot. Among the Italians the Barberry bears the name of Holy\r\nThorn, because thought to have formed part of the crown of thorns\r\nmade for our Saviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARLEY.\r\n\r\nHordeum Vulgare--common Barley--is chiefly used in Great Britain\r\nfor brewing and distilling; but, it has dietetic and medicinal\r\nvirtues which entitle it to be considered among serviceable\r\nsimples. Roman gladiators who depended for their strength and\r\nprowess chiefly on Barley, were called Hordearii. Nevertheless,\r\nthis cereal is less nourishing than wheat, and when prepared as\r\nfood is apt to purge; therefore it is not made into bread, except\r\nwhen wheat is scarce and dear, though in Scotland poor people eat\r\nBarley bread. In India Barley meal is made into balls of dough for\r\nthe oxen and camels. Pearl Barley is prepared in Holland and\r\nGermany by first shelling the grain, and then grinding it into round\r\nwhite granules. The ancients fed their horses upon Barley, and we\r\nfatten swine on this grain made into meal. Among the Greeks beer\r\nwas known as barley wine, which was brewed without hops, these\r\ndating only from the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\nA decoction of barley with gum arabic, one ounce of the gum\r\ndissolved in a pint of the hot decoction, is a very useful drink to\r\nsoothe irritation of the bladder, [45] and of the urinary passages.\r\nThe chemical constituents of Barley are starch, gluten, albumen,\r\noil, and hordeic acid. From the earliest times it has been employed\r\nto prepare drinks for the sick, especially in feverish disorders, and\r\nfor sore lining membranes of the chest. Honey may be added\r\nbeneficially to the decoction of barley for bronchial coughs. The\r\nFrench make \"Orgeat\" of barley boiled in successive waters, and\r\nsweetened at length as a cooling drink: though this name is now\r\napplied in France to a liqueur concocted from almonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIL.\r\n\r\nThe herb Sweet Basil (_Ocymum Basilicum_) is so called because\r\n\"the smell thereof is fit for a king's house.\" It grows commonly in\r\nour kitchen gardens, but in England it dies down every year, and\r\nthe seeds have to be sown annually. Botanically, it is named\r\n\"basilicon,\" or royal, probably because used of old in some regal\r\nunguent, or bath, or medicine.\r\n\r\nThis, and the wild Basil, belong to the Labiate order of plants. The\r\nleaves of the Sweet Basil, when slightly bruised, exhale a\r\ndelightful odour; they gave the distinctive flavour to the original\r\nFetter-Lane sausages.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Basil (_Calamintha clinopodium_) or Basil thyme, or\r\nHorse thyme, is a hairy plant growing in bushy places, also about\r\nhedges and roadsides, and bearing whorls of purple flowers with\r\na strong odour of cloves. The term _Clinopodium_ signifies \"bed's-foot\r\nflower,\" because \"the branches dooe resemble the foot of a\r\nbed.\" In common with the other labiates, Basil, both the wild and\r\nthe sweet, furnishes an aromatic volatile camphoraceous oil. On\r\nthis account it is much employed in France for flavouring soups\r\n(especially mock turtle) and [46] sauces; and the dry leaves, in the\r\nform of snuff, are used for relieving nervous headaches. A tea,\r\nmade by pouring boiling water on the garden basil, when green,\r\ngently but effectually helps on the retarded monthly flow with\r\nwomen. The Bush Basil is _Ocymum minimum_, of which the leafy\r\ntops are used for seasoning, and in salads.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Basil has been immortalised by Keats in his tender,\r\npathetic poem of _Isabella and the Pot of Basil_, founded on\r\na  story from Boccaccio. She reverently possessed herself of\r\nthe  decapitated head of her lover, Lorenzo, who had been\r\ntreacherously slain:--\r\n\r\n    \"She wrapped it up, and for its tomb did choose\r\n    A garden pot, wherein she laid it by,\r\n    And covered it with mould, and o'er it set\r\n    Sweet Basil, which her tears kept ever wet.\"\r\n\r\nThe herb was used at funerals in Persia. Its seeds were sown by the\r\nRomans with maledictions and curses through the belief that the\r\nmore it was abused the better it would prosper. When desiring a\r\ngood crop they trod it down with their feet, and prayed the gods it\r\nmight not vegetate. The Greeks likewise supposed Basil to thrive\r\nbest when sown with swearing; and this fact explains the French\r\nsaying, _Semer la Basilic_, as signifying \"to slander.\" It was told\r\nin Elizabeth's time that the hand of a fair lady made Basil flourish;\r\nand this was then planted in pots as an act of gallantry. \"Basil,\"\r\nsays John Evelyn, \"imparts a grateful flavour to sallets if not too\r\nstrong, but is somewhat offensive to the eyes.\" Shenstone, in his\r\n_School Mistress's Garden_, tells of \"the tufted Basil,\" and\r\nCulpeper quaintly says: \"Something is the matter; Basil and Rue\r\nwill never grow together: no, nor near one another.\" It is related\r\n[47] that a certain advocate of Genoa was once sent as an\r\nambassador to treat for conditions with the Duke of Milan; but the\r\nDuke harshly refused to hear the message, or to grant the\r\nconditions. Then the Ambassador offered him a handful of Basil.\r\nDemanding what this meant, the Duke was told that the properties\r\nof the herb were, if gently handled, to give out a pleasant odour;\r\nbut that, if bruised, and hardly wrung, it would breed scorpions.\r\nMoved by this witty answer, the Duke confirmed the conditions,\r\nand sent the Ambassador honourably home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAN (_see_ Pea and Bean).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELLADONNA (_see_ Night Shade).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENNET HERB (Avens).\r\n\r\nThis, the _Herba Benedicta_, or Blessed Herb, or Avens (_Geum\r\nUrbanum_) is a very common plant of the Rose tribe, in our\r\nwoods, hedges, and shady places. It has an erect hairy stem, red at\r\nthe base, with terminal bright yellow drooping flowers. The\r\nordinary name Avens--or Avance, Anancia, Enancia--signifies an\r\nantidote, because it was formerly thought to ward off the Devil,\r\nand evil spirits, and venomous beasts. Where the root is in a house\r\nSatan can do nothing, and flies from it: \"therefore\" (says Ortus\r\nSanitatis) \"it is blessed before all other herbs; and if a man carries\r\nthe root about him no venomous beast can harm him.\" The herb\r\nis sometimes called Way Bennet, and Wild Rye. Its graceful\r\ntrefoiled loaf, and the fine golden petals of its flowers,\r\nsymbolising the five wounds of Christ, were sculptured by the\r\nmonks of the thirteenth century on their Church architecture. The\r\nbotanical title of this [48] plant, _Geum_, is got from _Geuo_, \"to\r\nyield an agreeable fragrance,\" in allusion to the roots. Hence also\r\nhas been derived another appellation of the Avens--_Radix\r\nCaryophyllata_, or \"clove root,\" because when freshly dug out of\r\nthe ground the roots smell like cloves. They yield tannin freely,\r\nwith mucilage, resin, and muriate of lime, together with a heavy\r\nvolatile oil. The roots are astringent and antiseptic, having been\r\ngiven in infusion for ague, and as an excellent cordial sudorific in\r\nchills, or for fresh catarrh. To make this a pint of boiling water\r\nshould be poured on half an ounce of the dried root, or rather more\r\nof the fresh root, sliced. Half a wineglassful will be the dose, or\r\nten grains of the powdered root. An extract is further made. When\r\nthe petals of the flower fall off, a small round prickly ball is to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBETONY.\r\n\r\nFew, if any, herbal plants have been more praised for their\r\nsupposed curative virtues than the Wood Betony (_Stachys\r\nBetonica_), belonging to the order of Labiates. By the common\r\npeople it is often called Bitny. The name _Betonica_ is from the\r\nCeltic \"ben,\" head, and \"tonic,\" good, in allusion to the usefulness\r\nof the herb against infirmities of the head. It is of frequent growth\r\nin shady woods and meadows, having aromatic leaves, and spikes\r\n(stakoi) of light purple flowers. Formerly it was held in the very\r\nhighest esteem as a leading herbal simple. The Greeks loudly\r\nextolled its good qualities. Pliny, in downright raptures, styled it\r\n_ante cunctas laudatissima_! An old Italian proverb ran thus:\r\n_Vende la tunica en compra la Betonia_, \"Sell your coat, and buy\r\nBetony;\" whilst modern Italians, when speaking of a most\r\nexcellent man, say, [49] \"He has as many virtues as Betony\"--_He\r\npiu virtu che Bettonica_.\r\n\r\nIn the _Medicina Britannica_, 1666, we read: \"I have known the\r\nmost obstinate headaches cured by daily breakfasting for a month\r\nor six weeks on a decoction of Betony, made with new milk, and\r\nstrained.\"\r\n\r\nAntonius Musa, chief physician to the Emperor Augustus, wrote a\r\nbook entirely on the virtues of this herb. Meyrick says, inveterate\r\nheadaches after resisting every other remedy, have been cured by\r\ntaking daily at breakfast a decoction made from the leaves and\r\ntops of the Wood Betony. Culpeper wrote: \"This is a precious herb\r\nwell worth keeping in your house.\" Gerard tells that \"Betony\r\nmaketh a man have a good appetite to his meat, and is commended\r\nagainst ache of the knuckle bones\" (sciatica).\r\n\r\nA pinch of the powdered herb will provoke violent sneezing. The\r\ndried leaves formed an ingredient in Rowley's British Herb Snuff,\r\nwhich was at one time quite famous against headaches.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding all this concensus of praise from writers\r\nof different epochs, it does not appear that the Betony, under\r\nchemical analysis and research, shows itself as containing any\r\nspecial medicinal or curative constituents. It only affords the\r\nfragrant aromatic principles common to most of the labiate plants.\r\n\r\nParkinson, who enlarged the _Herbal_ of Gerard, pronounced the\r\nleaves and flowers of Wood Betony, \"by their sweet and spicy\r\ntaste, comfortable both in meate and medicine.\" Anyhow, Betony\r\ntea, made with boiling water poured on the plant, is a safe drink,\r\nand likely to prove of benefit against languid nervous headaches;\r\nand the dried herb may be smoked as tobacco for relieving the\r\nsame ailment. To make Betony tea, put two ounces of [50] the\r\nherb to a quart of water over the fire, and let this gradually simmer\r\nto three half-pints. Give a wine-glassful of the decoction three\r\ntimes a day. A conserve may be made from the flowers for similar\r\npurposes. The Poet Laureate, A. Austin, mentions \"lye of Betony\r\nto soothe the brow.\" Both this plant, and the _Water Betony_--so\r\ncalled from its similarity of leaf--bear the name of Kernel-wort,\r\nfrom having tubers or kernels attached to the roots, and from being\r\ntherefore supposed, on the doctrine of signatures, to cure diseased\r\nkernels or scrofulous glands in the neck; also to banish piles from\r\nthe fundament.\r\n\r\nBut the Water Betony (Figwort) belongs not to the labiates, but to\r\nthe _Scrophulariaceoe_, or scrofula-curing order of plants. It\r\nis called in some counties \"brown-wort,\" and in Yorkshire\r\n\"bishopsleaves,\" or, _l'herbe du siege_, which term has a double\r\nmeaning--in allusion both to the seat in the temple of Cloacina\r\n(W.C.) and to the ailments of the lower body in connection\r\ntherewith, as well as to the more exalted \"See\" of a Right\r\nReverend Prelate. In old times the Water figwort was famous as\r\na vulnerary, both when used externally, and when taken in\r\ndecoction. The name \"brown-wort\" has been got either from the\r\nbrown colour of the stems and flowers, or, more probably, from its\r\ngrowing abundantly about the \"brunnen,\" or public German\r\nfountains. Wasps and bees are fond of the flowers. In former days\r\nthis herb was relied on for the cure of toothache, and for expelling\r\nthe particular disembodied spirit, or \"mare,\" which visited our\r\nSaxon ancestors during their sleep after supper, being familiarly\r\nknown to them as the \"nightmare.\" The \"Echo\" was in like manner\r\nthought by the Saxons to be due to a spectre, or mare, which\r\nthey called the \"wood mare.\" The Water [51] Betony is said to\r\nmake one of the ingredients in Count Mattaei's noted remedy,\r\n\"anti-scrofuloso.\" The Figwort is named in Somersetshire \"crowdy-kit\"\r\n(the word kit meaning a fiddle), \"or fiddlewood,\" because if two of\r\nthe stalks are rubbed together, they make a noise like the scraping\r\nof the bow on violin strings. In Devonshire, also, the plant is\r\nknown as \"fiddler.\"\r\n\r\nAn allied Figwort--which is botanically called _nodosa_, or\r\nknotted--is considered, when an ointment is made with it, using\r\nthe whole plant bruised and treated with unsalted lard, a sovereign\r\nremedy against \"burnt holes\" or gangrenous chicken-pox, such as\r\noften attacks the Irish peasantry, who subsist on a meagre and\r\nexclusively vegetable diet, being half starved, and pent up in\r\nwretched foul hovels. This herb is said to be certainly curative of\r\nhydrophobia, by taking every morning whilst fasting a slice of\r\nbread and butter on which the powdered knots of the roots have\r\nbeen spread, following it up with two tumblers of fresh spring\r\nwater. Then let the patient be well clad in woollen garments and\r\nmade to take a long fast walk until in a profuse perspiration. The\r\ntreatment should be continued for nine days. Again, the botanical\r\nname of a fig, _ficus_, has been commonly applied to a sore or\r\nscab appearing on a part of the body where hair is, or to a red sore\r\nin the fundament, i.e., to a pile. And the Figwort is so named in\r\nallusion to its curative virtues against piles, when the plant is made\r\ninto an ointment for outward use, and when the tincture is taken\r\ninternally. It is specially visited by wasps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBILBERRY (Whortleberry, or Whinberry).\r\n\r\nThis fruit, which belongs to the Cranberry order of plants, grows\r\nabundantly throughout England in heathy [52] and mountainous\r\ndistricts. The small-branched shrub bears globular, wax-like\r\nflowers, and black berries, which are covered, when quite fresh,\r\nwith a grey bloom. In the West of England they are popularly\r\ncalled \"whorts,\" and they ripen about the time of St. James' Feast,\r\nJuly 25th. Other names for the fruit are Blueberry, Bulberry,\r\nHurtleberry, and Huckleberry. The title Whinberry has been\r\nacquired from its growing on Whins, or Heaths; and Bilberry\r\nsignifies dark coloured; whence likewise comes Blackwort as\r\ndistinguished in its aspect from the Cowberry and the Cranberry.\r\nBy a corruption the original word Myrtleberry has suffered change\r\nof its initial M into W. (Whortlebery.) In the middle ages the\r\nMyrtleberry was used in medicine and cookery, to which berry the\r\nWhortleberry bears a strong resemblance. It is agreeable to the\r\ntaste, and may be made into tarts, but proves mawkish unless\r\nmixed with some more acid fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Bilberry (_Vaccinium Myrtillus_) is an admirable astringent,\r\nand should be included as such among the domestic medicines of\r\nthe housewife. If some good brandy be poured over two handfuls\r\nof the fruit in a bottle, this will make an extract which continually\r\nimproves by being kept. Obstinate diarrhoea may be cured by\r\ngiving doses of a tablespoonful of this extract taken with a\r\nwineglassful of warm water, and repeated at intervals of two hours\r\nwhilst needed, even for the more severe cases of dysenteric\r\ndiarrhoea. The berries contain chemically much tannin. Their stain\r\non the lips may be quickly effaced by sucking at a lemon. In\r\nDevonshire they are eaten at table with cream. The Irish call them\r\n\"frawns.\" If the first tender leaves are properly gathered and dried,\r\nthey can scarcely be [53] distinguished from good tea. Moor game\r\nlive on these berries in the autumn. Their juice will stain paper or\r\nlinen purple:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sanguineo splendore rosas vaccinia nigro,\r\n    Induit, et dulci violas ferrugine pingit.\"\r\n            CLAUDIAN.\r\n\r\nThey are also called in some counties, Blaeberries, Truckleberries,\r\nand Blackhearts.\r\n\r\nThe extract of Bilberry is found to be a very useful application for\r\ncuring such skin diseases as scaly eczema, and other eczema\r\nwhich is not moist or pustulous; also for burns and scalds. Some of\r\nthe extract is to be laid thickly on the cleansed skin with a camel\r\nhairbrush, and a thin layer of cotton wool to be spread over it, the\r\nwhole being fastened with a calico or gauze bandage. This should\r\nbe changed gently once a day.\r\n\r\nAnother Vaccinium (oxycoccos), the Marsh Whortleberry, or\r\nCranberry, or Fenberry--from growing in fens--is found in peat\r\nbogs, chiefly in the North. This is a low plant with straggling wiry\r\nstems, and solitary terminal bright red flowers, of which the\r\nsegments are bent back in a singular manner. Its fruit likewise\r\nmakes excellent tarts, and forms a considerable article of\r\ncommerce at Langtown, on the borders of Cumberland. The fruit\r\nstalks are crooked at the top, and before the blossom expands they\r\nresemble the head and neck of a crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY.\r\n\r\nThis is the well-known fruit of the Common Bramble (_Rubus\r\nfructicosus_), which grows in every English hedgerow, and which\r\nbelongs to the Rose order of plants. It has long been esteemed for\r\nits bark and leaves as a [54] capital astringent, these containing\r\nmuch tannin; also for its fruit, which is supplied with malic and\r\ncitric acids, pectin, and albumen. Blackberries go often by the\r\nname of \"bumblekites,\" from \"bumble,\" the cry of the bittern, and\r\nkyte, a Scotch word for belly; the name bumblekite being applied,\r\nsays Dr. Prior, \"from the rumbling and bumbling caused in the\r\nbellies of children who eat the fruit too greedily.\" \"Rubus\" is from\r\nthe Latin _ruber_, red.\r\n\r\nThe blackberry has likewise acquired the name of scaldberry, from\r\nproducing, as some say, the eruption known as scaldhead in\r\nchildren who eat the fruit to excess; or, as others suppose, from the\r\ncurative effects of the leaves and berries in this malady of the\r\nscalp; or, again, from the remedial effects of the leaves when\r\napplied externally to scalds.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the young shoots, eaten as a salad, will fasten\r\nloose teeth. If the leaves are gathered in the Spring and dried, then,\r\nwhen required, a handful of them may be infused in a pint of\r\nboiling water, and the infusion, when cool, may be taken, a\r\nteacupful at a time, to stay diarrhoea, and for some bleedings.\r\nSimilarly, if an ounce of the bruised root is boiled in three\r\nhalf-pints of water, down to a pint, a teacupful of this may be given\r\nevery three or four hours. The decoction is also useful against\r\nwhooping-cough in its spasmodic stage. The bark contains tannin;\r\nand if an ounce of the same be boiled in a pint and a half of water,\r\nor of milk, down to a pint, half a teacupful of the decoction may be\r\ngiven every hour or two for staying relaxed bowels. Likewise the\r\nfruit, if desiccated in a moderately hot oven, and afterwards\r\nreduced to powder (which should be kept ill a well corked bottle)\r\nwill prove an efficacious remedy for dysentery.\r\n\r\n[55] Gerard says: \"Bramble leaves heal the eyes that hang out, and\r\nstay the haemorrhoides [piles] if they can be laid thereunto.\" The\r\nLondon _Pharmacopoeia_ (1696) declared the ripe berries of the\r\nbramble to be a great cordial, and to contain a notable restorative\r\nspirit. In Cruso's _Treasury of Easy Medicines_ (1771), it is\r\ndirected for old inveterate ulcers: \"Take a decoction of blackberry\r\nleaves made in wine, and foment the ulcers with this whilst hot\r\neach night and morning, which will heal them, however difficult to\r\nbe cured.\" The name of the bush is derived from brambel, or\r\nbrymbyll, signifying prickly; its blossom as well as the fruit, ripe\r\nand unripe, in all stages, may be seen on the bush at the same time.\r\nWith the ancient Greeks Blackberries were a popular remedy for\r\ngout.\r\n\r\nAs soon as blackberries are over-ripe, they become quite\r\nindigestible. Country folk say in Somersetshire and Sussex: \"The\r\ndevil goes round on Old Michaelmas Day, October 11th, to spite\r\nthe Saint, and spits on the blackberries, so that they who eat them\r\nafter that date fall sick, or have trouble before the year is out.\"\r\nBlackberry wine and blackberry jam are taken for sore throats in\r\nmany rustic homes. Blackberry jelly is useful for dropsy from\r\nfeeble ineffective circulation. To make \"blackberry cordial,\" the\r\njuice should be expressed from the fresh ripe fruit, adding half a\r\npound of white sugar to each quart thereof, together with half an\r\nounce of both nutmeg and cloves; then boil these together for a\r\nshort time, and add a little brandy to the mixture when cold.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire the peasantry still think that if anyone is troubled\r\nwith \"blackheads,\" _i.e._, small pimples, or boils, he may be cured\r\nby creeping from East to West on the hands and knees nine times\r\nbeneath an arched [56] bramble bush. This is evidently a relic of\r\nan old Dryad superstition when the angry deities who inhabited\r\nparticular trees had to be appeased before the special diseases\r\nwhich they inflicted could be cured. It is worthy of remark that the\r\nBramble forms the subject of the oldest known apologue. When\r\nJonathan upbraided the men of Shechem for their base ingratitude\r\nto his father's house, he related to them the parable of the trees\r\nchoosing a king, by whom the Bramble was finally elected, after\r\nthe olive, the fig tree, and the vine had excused themselves from\r\naccepting this dignity.\r\n\r\nIn the Roxburghe Ballad of \"The Children in the Wood,\" occurs\r\nthe verse--\r\n\r\n    \"Their pretty lips with Blackberries\r\n        Were all besmeared and dyed;\r\n    And when they saw the darksome night\r\n        They sat them down, and cryed.\"\r\n\r\nThe French name for blackberries is _mures sauvages_, also\r\n_mures de haie_; and in some of our provincial districts they are\r\nknown as \"winterpicks,\" growing on the Blag.\r\n\r\nBlackberry wine, which is a trustworthy cordial astringent remedy\r\nfor looseness of the bowels, may be made thus: Measure your\r\nberries, and bruise them, and to every gallon of the fruit add a\r\nquart of boiling water. Let the mixture stand for twenty-four hours,\r\noccasionally stirring; then strain off the liquid, adding to every\r\ngallon a couple of pounds of refined sugar, and keep it in a cask\r\ntightly corked till the following October, when it will be ripe and\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nA noted hair-dye is said to be made by boiling the leaves of the\r\nbramble in strong lye, which then imparts permanently to the hair\r\na soft, black colour. Tom Hood, in his humorous way, described a\r\nnegro funeral [57] as \"going a black burying.\" An American poet\r\ngraphically tell us:--\r\n\r\n            \"Earth's full of Heaven,\r\n    And every common bush afire with God!\r\n    But only they who see take off their shoes;\r\n    The rest sit round it, and--pluck blackberries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUEBELL (Wild Hyacinth).\r\n\r\nThis,--the _Agraphis mutans_,--of the Lily tribe--is so abundant in\r\nEnglish woods and pastures, whilst so widely known, and popular\r\nwith young and old, as to need no description. Hyacinth petals\r\nare marked in general with dark spots, resembling in their\r\narrangement the Greek word AI, alas! because a youth, beloved by\r\nApollo, and killed by an ill-wind, was changed into this flower.\r\nBut the wild Hyacinth bears no such character on its petals, and is\r\ntherefore called \"non-scriptus.\" The graceful curl of the petals, not\r\ntheir dark violet colour, has suggested to the poets \"hyacinthine\r\nlocks.\"\r\n\r\nIn Walton's _Angler_ the Bluebell is mentioned as Culverkeys, the\r\nsame as \"Calverkeys\" in Wiltshire. No particular medicinal uses\r\nhave attached themselves to the wild Hyacinth flower as a herbal\r\nsimple. The root is round, and was formerly prized for its\r\nabundant clammy juice given out when bruised, and employed as\r\nstarch. Miss Pratt refers to this as poisonous; and our Poet\r\nLaureate teaches:--\r\n\r\n    \"In the month when earth and sky are one,\r\n    To squeeze the blue bell 'gainst the adder's bite.\"\r\n\r\nWhen dried and powdered, the root as a styptic is of special virtue\r\nto cure the whites of women: in doses of not more than three\r\ngrains at a time. \"There is [58] hardly,\" says Sir John Hill, \"a more\r\npowerful remedy.\" Tennyson has termed the woodland abundance\r\nof Hyacinths in full spring time as \"The heavens upbreaking\r\nthrough the earth.\" On the day of St. George, the Patron Saint of\r\nEngland, these wild hyacinths tinge the meadows and pastures\r\nwith their deep blue colour--an emblem of the ocean empire, over\r\nwhich England assumes the rule.\r\n\r\nBut the chief charms of the Bluebell are its beauty and early\r\nappearance. Now is \"the winter past; the rain is over and gone; the\r\nflowers appear on the earth; the time for the singing of birds is\r\ncome; and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This earth is one great temple, made\r\n        For worship everywhere;\r\n    The bells are flowers in sun and shade\r\n        Which ring the heart to prayer.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The city bell takes seven days\r\n        To reach the townsman's ear;\r\n    But he who kneels in Nature's ways.\r\n        Has Sabbath all the year.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hairbell (_Campanula rotundifolia_) is the Bluebell of\r\nScotland; and nothing rouses a Scot to anger more surely than to\r\nexhibit the wild Hyacinth as the true Bluebell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOG BEAN (or Marsh-trefoil).\r\n\r\nThe Buck-bean, or Bog-bean, which is common enough in stagnant\r\npools, and on our spongy bogs, is the most serviceable of\r\nall known herbal tonics. It may be easily recognised growing in\r\nwater by its large leaves overtopping the surface, each being\r\ncomposed of three leaflets, and resembling the leaf of a Windsor\r\nBroad Bean. The flowers when in bud are of a bright rose [59]\r\ncolor, and when fully blown they have the inner surface of their\r\npetals thickly covered with a white fringe, on which account the\r\nplant is known also as \"white fluff.\" The name Buckbean is\r\nperhaps a corruption of _scorbutus_, scurvy; this giving it another\r\ntitle, \"scurvy bean.\" And it is termed \"goat's bean,\" perhaps from\r\nthe French _le bouc_, \"a he-goat.\" The plant flowers for a month\r\nand therefore bears the botanical designation, \"Menyanthes\"\r\n(_trifoliata_) from _meen_, \"a month,\" and _anthos_, \"a flower.\" It\r\nbelongs to the Gentian tribe, each of which is distinguished by a\r\ntonic and appetizing bitterness of taste. The root of the Bog Bean\r\nis the most bitter part, and is therefore selected for medicinal use.\r\nIt contains a chemical glucoside, \"Menyanthin,\" which consists of\r\nglucose and a volatile product, \"Menyanthol.\" For curative\r\npurposes druggists supply an infusion of the herb, and a liquid\r\nextract in combination with liquorice. These preparations are in\r\nmoderate doses, strengthening and antiscorbutic; but when given\r\nmore largely they are purgative and emetic. Gerard says if the\r\nplant \"be taken with mead, or honied water, it is of use against a\r\ncough\"; in which respect it is closely allied to the Sundew (another\r\nplant of the bogs) for relieving whooping-cough after the first\r\nfeverish stage, or any similar hacking, spasmodic cough. A\r\ntincture is made (H.) from the whole plant with spirit of wine, and\r\nthis proves most useful for clearing obscuration of the sight, when\r\nthere is a sense, especially in the open-air, of a white vibrating\r\nmist before the eyes; and therefore it has been given with marked\r\nsuccess in early stages of amaurotic paralysis of the retina. The\r\ndose should be three or four drops of the tincture with a\r\ntablespoonful of cold water three times in the day for a week at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[60] BORAGE.\r\n\r\nThe Borage, with its gallant blue flower, is cultivated in our\r\ngardens as a pot herb, and is associated in our minds with bees and\r\nclaret cup. It grows wild in abundance on open plains where the\r\nsoil is favourable, and it has a long-established reputation for\r\ncheering the spirits. Botanically, it is the _Borago officinalis_, this\r\ntitle being a corruption of _cor-ago_, i.e., _cor_, the heart, _ago_,\r\nI stimulate--_quia cordis affectibus medetur_, because it cures weak\r\nconditions of the heart. An old Latin adage says: _Borago ego\r\ngaudia semper ago_--\"I, Borage, bring always courage\"; or the\r\nname may be derived from the Celtic, _Borrach_, \"a noble\r\nperson.\" This plant was the Bugloss of the older botanists, and it\r\ncorresponds to our Common Bugloss, so called from the shape and\r\nbristly surface of its leaves, which resemble _bous-glossa_, the\r\ntongue of an ox. Chemically, the plant Borage contains potassium\r\nand calcium combined with mineral acids. The fresh juice affords\r\nthirty per cent., and the dried herb three per cent. of nitrate of\r\npotash. The stems and leaves supply much saline mucilage, which,\r\nwhen boiled and cooled, likewise deposits nitre and common salt.\r\nThese crystals, when ignited, will burn with a succession of small\r\nsparkling explosions, to the great delight of the schoolboy. And it\r\nis to such saline qualities the wholesome, invigorating effects and\r\nthe specially refreshing properties of the Borage are supposed to\r\nbe mainly due. For which reason, the plant, \"when taken in\r\nsallets,\" as says an old herbalist, \"doth exhilarate, and make the\r\nmind glad,\" almost in the same way as a bracing sojourn by the\r\nseaside during an autumn holiday. The flowers possess cordial\r\nvirtues which are very revivifying, and have been much commended\r\nagainst melancholic depression of the nervous system. Burton,\r\nin his [61] _Anatomy of Melancholy_ (1676), wrote with reference\r\nto the frontispiece of that book:--\r\n\r\n    \"Borage and Hellebore fill two scenes,\r\n    Sovereign plants to purge the veins\r\n    Of melancholy, and cheer the heart\r\n    Of those black fumes which make it smart;\r\n    The best medicine that God e'er made\r\n    For this malady, if well assaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sprigs of Borage,\" wrote John Evelyn, \"are of known virtue\r\nto revive the hypochondriac and cheer the hard student.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Dioscorides and Pliny, the Borage was that famous\r\nnepenthe of Homer which Polydamas sent to Helen for a token \"of\r\nsuch rare virtue that when taken steep'd in wine, if wife and\r\nchildren, father and mother, brother and sister, and all thy dearest\r\nfriends should die before thy face, thou could'st not grieve, or shed\r\na tear for them.\" \"The bowl of Helen had no other ingredient, as\r\nmost criticks do conjecture, than this of borage.\" And it was\r\ndeclared of the herb by another ancient author: _Vinum potatum\r\nquo sit macerata buglossa moerorum cerebri dicunt auferre\r\nperiti_:--\r\n\r\n    \"To enliven the sad with the joy of a joke,\r\n    Give them wine with some borage put in it to soak.\"\r\n\r\nThe Romans named the Borage _Euphrosynon_, because when put\r\ninto a cup of wine it made the drinkers of the same merry and\r\nglad.\r\n\r\nParkinson says, \"The seed of Borage helpeth nurses to have more\r\nstore of milk, for which purpose its leaves are most conducing.\" Its\r\nsaline constituents promote activity of the kidneys, and for this\r\nreason the plant is used in France to carry off catarrhs which are\r\nfeverish. The fresh herb has a cucumber-like odour, and when\r\ncompounded with lemon and sugar, added to wine and [62] water,\r\nit makes a delicious \"cool tankard,\" as a summer drink. \"A syrup\r\nconcocted of the floures,\" said Gerard, \"quieteth the lunatick\r\nperson, and the leaves eaten raw do engender good blood.\" Of all\r\nnectar-loving insects, bees alone know how to pronounce the\r\n\"open sesame\" of admission to the honey pots of the Borage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOM.\r\n\r\nThe Broom, or Link (_Cytisus scoparius_) is a leguminous shrub\r\nwhich is well known as growing abundantly on open places in our\r\nrural districts. The prefix \"cytisus\" is derived from the name of a\r\nGreek island where Broom abounded. It formerly bore the name of\r\n_Planta Genista_, and gave rise to the historic title, \"Plantagenet.\"\r\nA sprig of its golden blossom was borne by Geoffrey of Anjou in\r\nhis bonnet when going into battle, making him conspicuous\r\nthroughout the strife. In the _Ingoldsby Legends_ it is said of our\r\nsecond King Henry's headdress:--\r\n\r\n    \"With a great sprig of broom, which he bore as a badge in it,\r\n    He was named from this circumstance, Henry Plantagenet.\"\r\n\r\nThe stalks of the Broom, and especially the topmost young twigs,\r\nare purgative, and act powerfully on the kidneys to increase the\r\nflow of urine. They contain chemically an acid principle,\r\n\"scoparin,\" and an alkaloid, \"sparteine.\" For medical purposes\r\nthese terminal twigs are used (whether fresh or dried) to make a\r\ndecoction which is of great use in dropsy from a weak heart, but it\r\nshould not be given where congestion of the lungs is present. From\r\nhalf to one ounce by weight of the tops should be boiled down in a\r\npint of water to half this quantity, and a wineglassful may be taken\r\nas a dose every four or six hours. For more chronic dropsy,\r\na compound decoction of broom may be given with much [63]\r\nbenefit. To make this, use broom-tops and dandelion roots, of each\r\nhalf an ounce, boiling them in a pint of water down to half a pint,\r\nand towards the last adding half an ounce of bruised juniper\r\nberries. When cold, the decoction should be strained and a\r\nwineglassful may be had three or four times a day. \"Henry the\r\nEighth, a prince of famous memory, was wonte to drinke the\r\ndistilled water of broome flowers against surfeits and diseases\r\ntherefrom arising.\" The flower-buds, pickled in vinegar, are\r\nsometimes used as capers; and the roasted seeds have been\r\nsubstituted for coffee. Sheep become stupefied or excited when by\r\nchance constrained to eat broom-tops.\r\n\r\nThe generic name, _Scoparius_, is derived from the Latin word\r\n_scopa_, a besom, this signifying \"a shrub to sweep with.\" It has\r\nbeen long represented that witches delight to ride thereon: and in\r\nHolland, if a vessel lying in dock has a besom tied to the top of its\r\nmast, this advertises it as in search of a new owner. Hence has\r\narisen the saying about a woman when seeking a second husband,\r\n_Zij steetk't dem bezen_, \"She hangs out the broom.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition in Suffolk and Sussex:--\r\n\r\n    \"If you sweep the house with Broom in May,\r\n    You'll sweep the head of the house away.\"\r\n\r\nAllied to the Broom, and likewise belonging to the Papilionaceous\r\norder of leguminous plants, though not affording any known\r\nmedicinal principle, the Yellow Gorse (_Ulex_) or Furze grows\r\ncommonly throughout England on dry exposed plains. It covers\r\nthese during the flowering season with a gorgeous sheet of yellow\r\nblossoms, orange perfumed, and which entirely conceals the\r\nrugged brown unsightly branches beneath. Its elastic seed vessels\r\nburst with a crackling noise in hot [64] weather, and scatter the\r\nseeds on all sides. \"Some,\" says Parkinson, \"have used the flowers\r\nagainst the jaundice,\" but probably only because of their yellow\r\ncolour. \"The seeds,\" adds Gerard, \"are employed in medicines\r\nagainst the stone, and the staying of the laske\" (_laxitas_,\r\nlooseness). They are certainly astringent, and contain tannin. In\r\nDevonshire the bush is called \"Vuzz,\" and in Sussex \"Hawth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gorse is rare in Scotland, thriving best in our cool humid\r\nclimate. In England it is really never out of blossom, not even after\r\na severe frost, giving rise to the well-known saying \"Love is never\r\nout of season except when the Furze is out of bloom.\" It is also\r\nknown as Fursbush, Furrs and Whins, being crushed and given as\r\nfodder to cattle. The tender shoots are protected from being eaten\r\nby herbivorous animals in the same way as are the thistles and the\r\nholly, by the angles of the leaves having grown together so as to\r\nconstitute prickles.\r\n\r\n    \"'Twere to cut off an epigram's point,\r\n    Or disfurnish a knight of his spurs,\r\n    If we foolishly tried to disjoint\r\n    Its arms from the lance-bearing Furze.\"\r\n\r\nLinnoeus \"knelt before it on the sod: and for its beauty thanked his\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Butcher's Broom, Ruscus (or Bruscus) aculeatus_, or prickly,\r\nis a plant of the Lily order, which grows chiefly in the South of\r\nEngland, on heathy places and in woods. It bears sharp-pointed,\r\nstiff leaves (each of which produces a small solitary flower on its\r\nupper surface), and scarlet berries. The shrub is also known as\r\nKnee Hulyer, Knee Holly (confused with the Latin _cneorum_),\r\nPrickly Pettigrue and Jews' Myrtle. Butchers make besoms of its\r\ntwigs, with which to sweep their stalls or [65] blocks: and these\r\ntwigs are called \"pungi topi,\" \"prickrats,\" from being used to\r\npreserve meat from rats. Jews buy the same for service during the\r\nFeast of Tabernacles; and the boughs have been employed for\r\nflogging chilblains. The Butcher's Broom has been claimed by the\r\nEarls of Sutherland as the distinguishing badge of their followers\r\nand Clan, every Sutherland volunteer wearing a sprig of the bush\r\nin his bonnet on field days. This shrub is highly extolled as a free\r\npromoter of urine in dropsy and obstructions of the kidneys; a pint\r\nof boiling water should be poured on an ounce of the fresh twigs,\r\nor on half-an-ounce of the bruised root, to make an infusion,\r\nwhich may be taken as tea. The root is at first sweet to the taste,\r\nand afterwards bitter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRYONY.\r\n\r\nEnglish hedgerows exhibit Bryony of two distinct sorts--the white\r\nand the black--which differ much, the one from the other, as to\r\nmedicinal properties, and which belong to separate orders of\r\nplants. The White Bryony is botanically a cucumber, being of\r\ncommon growth at our roadsides, and often called the White Vine;\r\nit also bears the name of Tetterberry, from curing a disease of the\r\nskin known as tetters. It climbs about with long straggling stalks,\r\nwhich attach themselves by spiral tendrils, and which produce\r\nrough, palmated leaves. Insignificant pale-green flowers spring in\r\nsmall clusters from the bottom of these leaves. The round berries\r\nare at first green, and afterwards brilliantly red. Chemically, the\r\nplant contains \"bryonin,\" a medicinal substance which is intensely\r\nbitter; also malate and phosphate of lime, with gum, starch, and\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nA tincture is made (H.) from the fresh root collected before the\r\nplant flowers, which is found to [66] be of superlative use for the\r\nrelief of chronic rheumatism (especially when aggravated by\r\nmoving), and for subduing active congestions of the serous\r\nmembranes which line the heart-bag, the ribs, the outer coat of the\r\nbrain, and which cover the bowels. In the treatment of pleurisy,\r\nthis tincture is invaluable. Four drops should be given in a\r\ntablespoonful of cold water every three or four hours. Also for any\r\ncontused bruising of the skin, and especially for a black eye, to\r\npromptly bathe the injured part with a decoction of White\r\nBryony root will speedily subdue the swelling, and will prevent\r\ndiscoloration far better than a piece of raw beef applied outside as\r\nthe remedy most approved in the Ring.\r\n\r\nIn France, the White Bryony is deemed so potent and perilous, that\r\nits root is named the devil's turnip--_navet du diable_.\r\n\r\nOur English plant, the _Bryonia dioica_, purges as actively as\r\ncolocynth, if too freely administered.\r\n\r\nThe name Bryony is two thousand years old, and comes from a\r\nGreek word _bruein_, \"to shoot forth rapidly.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the incised root of the White Bryony exudes a milky juice\r\nwhich is aperient of action, and which has been commended for\r\nepilepsy, as well as for obstructed liver and dropsy; also its\r\ntincture for chronic constipation.\r\n\r\nThe popular herbal drink known as Hop Bitters is said to owe\r\nmany of its supposed virtues to the bryony root, substituted for the\r\nmandrake which it is alleged to contain. The true mandrake is a\r\ngruesome herb, which was held in superstitious awe by the Greeks\r\nand the Romans. Its root was forked, and bears some resemblance\r\nto the legs of a man; for which reason the moneymakers [67] of\r\nthe past increased the likeness, and attributed supernatural powers\r\nto the plant. It was said to grow only beneath a murderer's gibbet,\r\nand when torn from the earth by its root to utter a shriek which\r\nnone might hear and live. From earliest times, in the East, a notion\r\nprevailed that the mandrake would remove sterility. With which\r\npurpose in view, Rachel said to Leah: \"Give me, I pray thee, of thy\r\nson's mandrakes\" (Genesis xxx. v. 14). In later times the Bryony\r\nhas come into use instead of the true mandrake, and it has\r\ncontinued to form a profitable spurious article with mountebank\r\ndoctors. In Henry the Eighth's day, ridiculous little images made\r\nfrom Bryony roots, cut into the figure of a man, and with grains of\r\nmillet inserted into the face as eyes, the same being known as\r\npappettes or mammettes, were accredited with magical powers,\r\nand fetched high prices with simple folk. Italian ladies have been\r\nknown to pay as much as thirty golden ducats for one of these\r\nartificial mandrakes. Readers of Thalaba (Southey) will remember\r\nthe fine scene in which Khawla procures this plant to form part of\r\nthe waxen figure of the Destroyer. Unscrupulous vendors of the\r\nfraudulent articles used to seek out a thriving young Bryony plant,\r\nand to open the earth round it. Then being prepared with a mould\r\nsuch as is used for making Plaster of Paris figures, they fixed it\r\nclose to the root, and fastened it with wire to keep it in place.\r\nAfterwards, by filling the earth up to the root they left it to assume\r\nthe required shape, which was generally accomplished in a single\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal tincture (H.) of White Bryony (_Bryonia alba_) is\r\nof special service to persons of dark hair and complexion, with\r\nfirm fibre of flesh, and of a bilious cross-grained temperament.\r\nAlso it is of [68] particular use for relieving coughs, and colds of a\r\nfeverish bronchial sort, caught by exposure to the east wind. On\r\nthe contrary, the catarrhal troubles of sensitive females, and of\r\nyoung children, are better met by Ipecacuanha:--\r\n\r\n    \"Coughing in a shady grove\r\n        Sat my Juliana,\r\n    Lozenges I gave my love,\r\n        Ipecacuanha--\r\n    Full twenty from the lozenge box\r\n        The greedy nymph did pick;\r\n    Then, sighing sadly, said to me--\r\n        My Damon, I am sick.\"\r\n            _George Canning._\r\n\r\n    THYRSIS ET PHYLLIS.\r\n    In nemore umbroso Phyllis mea forte sedebat,\r\n    Cui mollem exhausit tussis anhela sinum:\r\n    Nec mora: de loculo deprompsi pyxida loevo,\r\n    Ipecacuaneos, exhibuique trochos:\r\n    Illa quidem imprudens medicatos leniter orbes\r\n    Absorpsit numero bisque quaterque decem:\r\n    Tum tenero ducens suspiria pectore dixit,\r\n    \"Thyrsi! Mihi stomachum nausea tristis habet.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Black Bryony _(Lady's-seal, or Oxberry), which likewise\r\ngrows freely in our hedges, is quite a different plant from its\r\nnominal congener. It bears the name of _Tamus Vulgaris_, and\r\nbelongs to the natural order of Yams. It is also called the Wild\r\nHop, and Tetterberry or Tetterwort (in common with the greater\r\nCelandine), because curing the skin disease known as tetters; and\r\nfurther, Blackbindweed. It has smooth heart-shaped leaves, and\r\nproduces scarlet, elliptical berries larger than those of the White\r\nBryony. A tincture is made (H.) from the root-stock, with spirit of\r\nwine, which proves a most useful application to unbroken\r\nchilblains, when [69] made into a lotion with water, one part to\r\ntwenty. The plant is called Black Bryony (_Bryonia nigra_) from\r\nits dark leaves and black root. It is not given at all internally, but\r\nthe acrid pulp of the root has been used as a stimulating plaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUCKTHORN.\r\n\r\nThe common Buckthorn grows in our woods and thickets, and\r\nused to be popularly known because of the purgative syrup made\r\nfrom its juice and berries. It bears dense branches of small green\r\nflowers, followed by the black berries, which purge violently. If\r\ngathered before they are ripe they furnish a yellow dye. When\r\nripe, if mixed with gum arabic and lime water, they form the\r\npigment called \"Bladder Green.\" Until late in the present century--\r\n_O dura ilia messorum!_--English rustics, when requiring an\r\naperient dose for themselves or their children, had recourse to the\r\nsyrup of Buckthorn. But its action was so severe, and attended\r\nwith such painful gripings, that as time went on the medicine was\r\ndiscarded, and it is now employed in this respect almost\r\nexclusively by the cattle doctor. Dodoeus taught about Buckthorn\r\nberries: \"They be not meet to be administered but to young and\r\nlusty people of the country, which do set more store of their\r\nmoney than their lives.\" The shrub grows chiefly on chalk, and\r\nnear brooks. The name Buckthorn is from the German _buxdorn_,\r\nboxthorn, hartshorn. In Anglo-Saxon it was Heorot-bremble. It is\r\nalso known as Waythorn, Rainberry Thorn, Highway Thorn and\r\nRhineberries. Each of the berries contains four seeds: and the flesh\r\nof birds which eat thereof is said to be purgative. When the juice is\r\ngiven medicinally it causes a bad stomach-ache, with much\r\ndryness of the throat: for which reason Sydenham [70] always\r\nordered a basin of soup to be given after it. Chemically the active\r\nprinciple of the Buckthorn is \"rhamno-cathartine.\" Likewise a\r\nmilder kind of Buckthorn, which is much more useful as a Simple,\r\ngrows freely in England, the _Rhamnus frangula_ or so-called\r\n\"black berry-bearing Alder,\" though this appellation is a mistake,\r\nbecause botanically the Alder never bears any berries. This black\r\nBuckthorn is a slender shrub, which occurs in our woods and\r\nthickets. The juice of its berries is aperient, without being\r\nirritating, and is well suited as a laxative for persons of delicate\r\nconstitution. It possesses the merit of continuing to answer in\r\nsmaller doses after the patient has become habituated to its\r\nuse. The berry of the _Rhamnus frangula _may be known by its\r\ncontaining only two seeds. Country people give the bark boiled in\r\nale for jaundice; and this bark is the black dogwood of gunpowder\r\nmakers. Lately a certain aperient medicine has become highly\r\npopular with both doctors and patients in this country, the same\r\nbeing known as Cascara Sagrada. It is really an American\r\nBuckthorn, the _Rhamnus Persiana_, and it possesses no true\r\nadvantage over our black Alder Buckthorn, though the bark of this\r\nlatter must be used a year old, or it will cause griping. A fluid\r\nextract of the English mild Buckthorn, or of the American\r\nCascara, is made by our leading druggists, of which from half to\r\none teaspoonful may be given for a dose. This is likewise a tonic\r\nto the intestines, and is especially useful for relieving piles.\r\nLozenges also of the Alder Buckthorn are dispensed under the\r\nname of \"Aperient Fruit Lozenges;\" one, or perhaps two, being\r\ntaken for a dose as required.\r\n\r\nThere is a Sea Buckthorn, _Hippophoe_, which belongs to a\r\ndifferent natural order, _Eloeagnaceoe_, a low shrubby tree, [71]\r\ngrowing on sandhills and cliffs, and called also Sallowthorn. The\r\nfruit is made (in Tartary) into a pleasant jelly, because of its acid\r\nflavour, and used in the Gulf of Bothnia for concocting a fish\r\nsauce.\r\n\r\nThe name signifies \"giving light to a horse,\" being conferred\r\nbecause of a supposed power to cure equine blindness; or it may\r\nmean \"shining underneath,\" in allusion to the silvery underside of\r\nthe leaf.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned Cathartic Buckthorn of our hedges and woods\r\nhas spinous thorny branchlets, from which its name, _Rhamnus_,\r\nis thought to be derived, because the shrub is set with thorns like\r\nas the ram. At one time this Buckthorn was a botanical puzzle,\r\neven to Royalty, as the following lines assure us:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hicum, peridicum; all clothed in green;\r\n    The King could not tell it, no more could the Queen;\r\n    So they sent to consult wise men from the East.\r\n    Who said it had horns, though it was not a beast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNET SAXIFRAGE (_see_ Pimpernel).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERCUP.\r\n\r\nThe most common Buttercup of our fields (_Ranunculus bulbosis_)\r\nneeds no detailed description. It belongs to the order termed\r\n_Ranunculaceoe_, so-called from the Latin _rana_, a frog,\r\nbecause the several varieties of this genus grow in moist places\r\nwhere frogs abound. Under the general name of Buttercups\r\nare included the creeping Ranunculus, of moist meadows; the\r\n_Ranunculus acris_, Hunger Weed, or Meadow Crowfoot, so named\r\nfrom the shape of the leaf (each of these two being also\r\ncalled King Cup), and the _Ranunculus bulbosus_ mentioned\r\nabove. \"King-Cob\" signifies a resemblance between the unexpanded\r\nflowerbud and [72] a stud of gold, such as a king would\r\nwear; so likewise the folded calyx is named Goldcup, Goldknob\r\nand Cuckoobud. The term Buttercup has become conferred through\r\na mistaken notion that this flower gives butter a yellow\r\ncolour through the cows feeding on it (which is not the case),\r\nor, perhaps, from the polished, oily surface of the petals.\r\nThe designation really signifies \"button cop,\" or _bouton d'or_;\r\n\"the batchelor's button\"; this terminal syllable, _cup_, being\r\ncorrupted from the old English word \"cop,\" a head. It really means\r\n\"button head.\" The Buttercup generally is known in Wiltshire and\r\nthe adjoining counties as Crazy, or Crazies, being reckoned by\r\nsome as an insane plant calculated to produce madness; or as a\r\ncorruption of Christseye (which was the medieval name of the\r\nMarigold).\r\n\r\nA burning acridity of taste is the common characteristic of the\r\nseveral varieties of the Buttercup. In its fresh state the ordinary\r\nfield Buttercup is so acrimonious that by merely pulling up the\r\nplant by its root, and carrying it some little distance in the hand,\r\nthe palm becomes reddened and inflamed. Cows will not eat it\r\nunless very hungry, and then the mouth of the animal becomes\r\nsore and blistered. The leaves of the Buttercup, when bruised and\r\napplied to the skin, produce a blistering of the outer cuticle, with a\r\ndischarge of a watery fluid, and with heat, redness, and swelling.\r\nIf these leaves are masticated in the mouth they will induce pains\r\nlike a stitch between the ribs at the side, with the sharp catchings\r\nof neuralgic rheumatism. A medicinal tincture is made (H.) from\r\nthe bulbous Buttercup with spirit of wine, which will, as a similar,\r\ncure _shingles_ very expeditiously, both the outbreak of\r\nsmall watery pimples clustered together at the side, and the\r\naccompanying sharp pains between the ribs. Also this tincture will\r\n[73] promptly relieve neuralgic side-ache, and pleurisy which is of\r\na passive sort. From six to eight drops of the tincture may be taken\r\nwith a tablespoonful of cold water by an adult three or four times a\r\nday for either of the aforesaid purposes. In France, this plant is\r\ncalled \"jaunet.\" Buttercups are most probably the \"Cuckoo Buds\"\r\nimmortalised by Shakespeare. The fresh leaves of the Crowfoot\r\n(_Ranunculus acris_) formed a part of the famous cancer cure of\r\nMr. Plunkett in 1794. This cure comprised Crowfoot leaves,\r\nfreshly gathered, and dog's-foot fennel leaves, of each an ounce,\r\nwith one drachm of white arsenic levigated, and with five scruples\r\nof flowers of sulphur, all beaten together into a paste, and dried by\r\nthe sun in balls, which were then powdered, and, being mixed with\r\nyolk of egg, were applied on pieces of pig's bladder. The juice of\r\nthe common Buttercup (_Bulbosus_), known sometimes as \"St.\r\nAnthony's Turnip,\" if applied to the nostrils, will provoke\r\nsneezing, and will relieve passive headache in this way. The leaves\r\nhave been applied as a blister to the wrists in rheumatism, and\r\nwhen infused in boiling water as a poultice over the pit of the\r\nstomach as a counter-irritant. For sciatica the tincture of the\r\nbulbous buttercup has proved very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe _Ranunculus flammata_, Spearwort, has been used to produce\r\na slight blistering effect by being put under a limpet shell against\r\nthe skin of the part to be relieved, until some smarting and burning\r\nhave been sensibly produced, with incipient vesication of the\r\noutermost skin.\r\n\r\nThe _Ranunculus Sceleratus_, Marsh Crowfoot, or Celery-leaved\r\nButtercup, called in France \"_herbe sardonique_,\" and \"_grenouillette\r\nd'eau_,\" when made into a tincture (H.) with spirit of wine,\r\nand given in small diluted doses, proves curative of stitch\r\nin the side, and of neuralgic pains between the ribs, likewise of\r\npleurisy without [74] feverishness. The dose should be five drops\r\nof the third decimal tincture with a spoonful of water every three\r\nor four hours. This plant grows commonly at the sides of our\r\npools, and in wet ditches, bearing numerous small yellow flowers,\r\nwith petals scarcely longer than the calyx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABBAGE.\r\n\r\n\"The time has come,\" as the walrus said in _Alice and the Looking\r\nGlass_, \"to talk of many things\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Of shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax; of _Cabbages_, and\r\n    kings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cabbage, which is fabled to have sprung from the tears of the\r\nSpartan lawgiver, Lycurgus, began as the Colewort, and was for\r\nsix hundred years, according to Pliny and Cato, the only internal\r\nremedy used by the Romans. The Ionians had such a veneration\r\nfor Cabbages that they swore by them, just as the Egyptians did by\r\nthe onion. With ourselves, the wild Cabbage, growing on our\r\nEnglish sea cliffs, is the true Collet, or Colewort, from which have\r\nsprung all our varieties of Cabbage--cauliflower, greens, broccoli,\r\netc. No vegetables were grown for the table in England before the\r\ntime of Henry the Eighth. In the thirteenth century it was the\r\ncustom to salt vegetables because they were so scarce; and in the\r\nsixteenth century a Cabbage from Holland was deemed a choice\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe whole tribe of Cabbages is named botanically _Brassicaceoe--\r\napo tou brassein_--because they heat, or ferment.\r\n\r\nBy natural order they are cruciferous plants; and all contain much\r\nnitrogen, or vegetable albumen, with a considerable quantity of\r\nsulphur; hence they tend strongly to putrefaction, and when\r\ndecomposed their odour is very offensive. Being cut into pieces,\r\nand pressed close in a tub with aromatic herbs and salt, so as to\r\nundergo an acescent fermentation (which is [75] arrested at that\r\nstage), Cabbages form the German _Saurkraut_, which is strongly\r\nrecommended against scurvy. The white Cabbage is most putrescible;\r\nthe red most emollient and pectoral. The juice of the red\r\ncabbage made into syrup, without any condiments, is useful in\r\nchronic coughs, and in bronchial asthma. The leaves of the\r\ncommon white Cabbage, when gently bruised and applied to a\r\nblistered surface, will promote a free discharge, as also when laid\r\nnext the skin in dropsy of the ankles. All the Coleworts are called\r\n\"Crambe,\" from _krambos_, dry, because they dispel drunkenness.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" says an old author, \"a natural enmitie between the\r\nColewort and the vine, which is such that the vine, if growing near\r\nunto it, withereth and perisheth; yea, if wine be poured into the\r\nColewort while it is boiling, it will not be any more boiled, and the\r\ncolour thereof will be quite altered.\" The generic term Colewort is\r\nderived from _caulis_, a stalk, and _wourte_, as applied to all\r\nkinds of herbs that \"do serve for the potte.\" \"Good worts,\"\r\nexclaimed Falstaff, catching at Evans' faulty pronunciation of\r\n_words_,--\"good worts,\"--\"good cabbages.\" An Irish cure for sore\r\nthroat is to tie Cabbage leaves round it; and the same remedy is\r\napplied in England with hot Cabbage leaves for a swollen face. In\r\nthe Island of Jersey coarse Cabbages are grown abundantly on\r\npatches of roadside ground, and in corners of fields, the stalks of\r\nwhich attain the height of eight, ten, or more feet, and are used for\r\nmaking walking sticks or _cannes en tiges de choux_. These are in\r\ngreat demand on the island, and are largely exported. It may be\r\nthat a specially tall cabbage of this sort gave rise to the Fairy tale\r\nof \"Jack and the bean stalk.\" The word Cabbage bears reference\r\n[76] to _caba (caput)_, a head, as signifying a Colewort which\r\nforms a round head. _Kohl rabi_, from _caulo-rapum_, cabbage\r\nturnip, is a name given to the _Brassica oleracea_. In 1595 the sum\r\nof twenty shillings was paid for six Cabbages and a few carrots, at\r\nthe port of Hull, by the purveyor to the Clifford family.\r\n\r\nThe red Cabbage is thought in France to be highly anti-scorbutic;\r\nand a syrup is made from it with this purpose in view. The juice of\r\nwhite Cabbage leaves will cure warts.\r\n\r\nThe _Brassica oleracea_ is one of the plants used in Count\r\nMattaei's vaunted nostrum, \"anti-scrofuloso.\" This, the sea\r\nCabbage, with its pale clusters of handsome yellow flowers, is\r\nvery ornamental to our cliffs. Its leaves, which are conspicuously\r\npurple, have a bitter taste when uncooked, but become palatable\r\nfor boiling if first repeatedly washed; and they are sold at Dover as\r\na market vegetable. These should be boiled in two waters, of\r\nwhich the first will be made laxative, and the second, or thicker\r\ndecoction, astringent, which fact was known to Hippocrates, who\r\nsaid \"_jus caulis solvit cujus substantia stringit_.\"\r\n\r\nSir Anthony Ashley brought the Cabbage into English cultivation.\r\nIt is said a Cabbage is sculptured at his feet on his monument in\r\nWimbourne Minster, Dorset. He imported the Cabbage (Cale)\r\nfrom Cadiz (Cales), where he held a command, and grew rich by\r\nseizing other men's possessions, notably by appropriating some\r\njewels entrusted to his care by a lady. Hence he is said to have got\r\nmore by Cales (Cadiz) than by Cale (Cabbage); and this is,\r\nperhaps, the origin of our term \"to cabbage.\" Among tailors, this\r\nphrase \"to cabbage\" is a cant saying which means to filch the cloth\r\nwhen cutting out for a customer. Arbuthnot writes \"Your [77]\r\ntailor, instead of shreds, cabbages whole yards of cloth.\" Perhaps\r\nthe word comes from the French _cabasser_, to put into a basket.\r\n\r\nFrom the seed of the wild Cabbage (Rape, or Navew) rape-seed oil\r\nis extracted, and the residue is called rape-cake, or oil-cake.\r\n\r\nSome years ago it was customary to bake bread-rolls wrapped in\r\nCabbage leaves, for imparting what was considered an agreeable\r\nflavour. John Evelyn said: \"In general, Cabbages are thought to\r\nallay fumes, and to prevent intoxication; but some will have them\r\nnoxious to the sight.\" After all it must be confessed the Cabbage is\r\ngreatly to be accused for lying undigested in the stomach, and for\r\nprovoking eructations; which makes one wonder at the veneration\r\nthe ancients had for it, calling the tribe divine, and swearing _per\r\nbrassicam_, which was for six hundred years held by the Romans\r\na panacea: though \"_Dis crambee thanatos_\"--\"Death by twice\r\nCabbage\"--was a Greek proverb. Gerard says the Greeks called\r\nthe Cabbage Amethustos, \"not only because it driveth away\r\ndrunkennesse; but also for that it is like in colour to the pretious\r\nstone called the amethyst.\" The Cabbage was Pompey's best\r\nbeloved dish. To make a winter salad it is customary in America to\r\nchoose a firm white Cabbage, and to shred it very fine, serving it\r\nwith a dressing of plain oil and vinegar. This goes by the name of\r\n\"slaw,\" which has a Dutch origin.\r\n\r\nThe free presence of hydrogen and sulphur causes a very strong\r\nand unpleasant smell to pervade the house during the cooking of\r\nCabbages. Nevertheless, this sulphur is a very salutary constituent\r\nof the vegetable, most useful in scurvy and scrofula. Partridge and\r\nCabbage suit the patrician table; bacon and Cabbage [78] better\r\nplease the taste and the requirements of the proletarian. The\r\nnitrogen of this and other cruciferous plants serves to make them\r\nemit offensive stinks when they lie out of doors and rot.\r\n\r\nFor the purulent scrofulous ophthalmic inflammation of infants, by\r\ncleansing the eyes thoroughly every half-hour with warm water,\r\nand then packing the sockets each time with fresh Cabbage leaves\r\ncleaned and bruised to a soft pulp, the flow of matter will be\r\nincreased for a few days, but a cure will be soon effected. Pliny\r\ncommended the juice of the raw Cabbage with a little honey for\r\nsore and inflamed eyes which were moist and weeping, but not for\r\nthose which were dry and dull.\r\n\r\nIn Kent and Sussex, when a Cabbage is cut and the stalk left in the\r\nground to produce \"greens\" for the table, a cottager will carve an x\r\non the top flat surface of the upright stalk, and thus protect it\r\nagainst mischievous garden sprites and demons.\r\n\r\nSome half a century ago medical apprentices were taught the art of\r\nblood-letting by practising with a lancet on the prominent veins of\r\na Cabbage leaf.\r\n\r\nCarlyle said \"of all plants the Cabbage grows fastest to\r\ncompletion.\" His parable of the oak and the Cabbage conveys the\r\nlesson that those things which are most richly endowed when they\r\ncome to perfection, are the slowest in their production and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPSICUM (CAYENNE).\r\n\r\nThe _Capsicum_, or Bird Pepper, or Guinea Pepper, is a native of\r\ntropical countries; but it has been cultivated throughout Great\r\nBritain as a stove plant for so many years (since the time\r\nof Gerard, 1636) as to have become practically indigenous.\r\nMoreover, its fruit-pods are so highly useful, whether as a\r\ncondiment, or as a medicine, [79] no apology is needed for\r\nincluding it among serviceable Herbal Simples. The Cayenne\r\npepper of our tables is the powdered fruit of Bird Pepper, a variety\r\nof the Capsicum plant, and belonging likewise to the order of\r\nSolanums; whilst the customary \"hot\" pickle which we take with\r\nour cold meats is prepared from another variety of the Capsicum\r\nplant called \"Chilies.\" This plant--the Bird Pepper--exercises an\r\nimportant medicinal action, which has only been recently\r\nrecognized by doctors. The remarkable success which has attended\r\nthe use of Cayenne pepper as a substitute for alcohol with hard\r\ndrinkers, and as a valuable drug in _delirium tremens_, has lately\r\nled physicians to regard the Capsicum as a highly useful,\r\nstimulating, and restorative medicine. For an intemperate person,\r\nwho really desires to wean himself from taking spirituous liquors,\r\nand yet feels to need a substitute at first, a mixture of tincture of\r\nCapsicum with tincture of orange peel and water will answer very\r\neffectually, the doses being reduced in strength and frequency\r\nfrom day to day. In _delirium tremens_, if the tincture of\r\nCapsicum be given in doses of half-a-dram well diluted with\r\nwater, it will reduce the tremor and agitation in a few hours,\r\ninducing presently a calm prolonged sleep. At the same time the\r\nskin will become warm, and will perspire naturally; the pulse will\r\nfall in quickness, but whilst regaining fulness and volume; and the\r\nkidneys, together with the bowels, will act freely.\r\n\r\nChemically the plant furnishes an essential oil with a crystalline\r\nprinciple, \"capsicin,\" of great power. This oil may be taken\r\nremedially in doses of from half to one drop rubbed up with some\r\npowdered white sugar, and mixed with a wineglassful of hot\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal tincture is made with sixteen grains of [80] the\r\npowdered Capsicum to a fluid ounce of spirit of wine; and the\r\ndose of this tincture is from five to twenty drops with one or two\r\ntablespoonfuls of water. In the smaller doses it serves admirably to\r\nrelieve pains in the loins when depending on a sluggish inactivity\r\nof the kidneys. Unbroken chilblains may be readily cured by\r\nrubbing them once a day with a piece of sponge saturated with the\r\ntincture of Capsicum until a strong tingling is induced. In the early\r\npart of the present century, a medicine of Capsicum with salt was\r\nfamous for curing severe influenza with putrid sore throat. Two\r\ndessert spoonfuls of small red pepper; or three of ordinary cayenne\r\npepper, were beaten together with two of fine salt, into a paste,\r\nand with half-a-pint of boiling water added thereto. Then the\r\nliquor was strained off when cold, and half-a-pint of very sharp\r\nvinegar was mixed with it, a tablespoonful of the united mixture\r\nbeing given to an adult every half, or full hour, diluted with water\r\nif too strong. For inflammation of the eyes, with a relaxed state of\r\nthe membranes covering the eyeballs and lining the lids, the\r\ndiluted juice of the Capsicum is a sovereign remedy. Again, for\r\ntoothache from a decayed molar, a small quantity of cayenne\r\npepper introduced into the cavity will often give immediate relief.\r\nThe tincture or infusion given in small doses has proved useful to\r\ndetermine outwardly the eruption of measles and scarlet fever,\r\nwhen imperfectly developed because of weakness. Also for a\r\nscrofulous discharge of matter from the ears, Capsicum tincture, of\r\na weak strength, four drops with a tablespoonful of cold water\r\nthree times a day, to a child, will prove curative.\r\n\r\nA Capsicum ointment, or \"Chili paste,\" scarcely ever fails to\r\nrelieve chronic rheumatism when rubbed in [81] topically for ten\r\nminutes at a time with a gloved hand; and an application\r\nafterwards of dry heat will increase the redness and warmth, which\r\npersist for some while, and are renewed by walking. This ointment,\r\nor paste, is made of the Oleo-resin--Capsicin--half-an-ounce,\r\nand Lanolin five ounces, the unguent being melted, and, after\r\nadding the Capsicin, letting them be stirred together until\r\ncold. The powder or tincture of Capsicum will give energy to a\r\nlanguid digestion, and will correct the flatulency often incidental\r\nto a vegetable diet. Again, a gargle containing Capsicum in a\r\nproper measure will afford prompt relief in many forms of sore\r\nthroat, both by its stimulating action, and by virtue of its special\r\naffinities (H.); this particularly holds good for a relaxed state of\r\nthe throat, the uvula, and the tonsils. Cayenne pepper is employed\r\nin the adulteration of gin.\r\n\r\nThe \"Peter Piper\" of our young memories took pickled pepper by\r\nthe peck. He must have been a Homoeopathic prover with a\r\nvengeance; but has left no useful record of his experiments--the\r\nmore's the pity--for our guidance when prescribing its diluted\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARAWAY.\r\n\r\nThe common Caraway is a herb of the umbelliferous order found\r\ngrowing on many waste places in England, though not a true\r\nnative of Great Britain. Its well-known aromatic seeds should be\r\nalways at hand in the cupboard of every British housewife. The\r\nplant got its name from inhabiting Caria, a province of Asia\r\nMinor. It is now cultivated for commerce in Kent and Essex; and\r\nthe essential oil distilled from the home grown fruit is preferred in\r\nthis country. The medicinal properties of the Caraway are cordial\r\nand comforting to [82] the stomach in colic and in flatulent\r\nindigestion; for which troubles a dose of from two to four drops of\r\nthe essential oil of Caraway may be given on a lump of sugar, or\r\nin a teaspoonful of hot water.\r\n\r\nFor earache, in some districts the country people pound up the\r\ncrumb of a loaf hot from the oven, together with a handful of\r\nbruised Caraway seeds; then wetting the whole with some spirit,\r\nthey apply it to the affected part. The plant has been long\r\nnaturalised in England, and was known here in Shakespeare's time,\r\nwho mentions it in the second part of _Henry IV_. thus: \"Come,\r\ncousin Silence! we will eat a pippin of last year's graffing, with a\r\ndish of Caraways; and then to bed!\" The seeds grow numerously\r\nin the small flat flowers placed thickly together on each floral\r\nplateau, or umbel, and are best known to us in seed cake, and in\r\nCaraway comfits. They are really the dried fruit, and possess,\r\nwhen rubbed in a mortar, a warm aromatic taste, with a fragrant\r\nspicy smell. Caraway comfits consist of these fruits encrusted with\r\nwhite sugar; but why the wife of a comfit maker should be given\r\nto swearing, as Shakespeare avers, it is not easy to see. The young\r\nroots of Caraway plants may be sent to table like parsnips; they\r\nwarm and stimulate a cold languid stomach. These mixed with\r\nmilk and made into bread, formed the _chara_ of Julius Caesar,\r\neaten by the soldiers of Valerius. Chemically the volatile\r\noil obtained from Caraway seeds consists of \"carvol,\" and a\r\nhydro-carbon, \"carvene,\" which is a sort of \"camphor.\" Dioscorides\r\nlong ago advised the oil for pale-faced girls; and modern ladies\r\nhave not disregarded the counsel.\r\n\r\nFrom six pounds of the unbruised seeds, four ounces of the pure\r\nessential oil can be expressed. In Germany the peasants flavour\r\ntheir cheese, soups, and household [83] bread--jager--with the\r\nCaraway; and this is not a modern custom, for an old Latin author\r\nsays: _Semina carui satis communiter adhibentur ad condiendum\r\npanem; et rustica nostrates estant jusculum e pane, seminibus\r\ncarui, et cerevisa coctum_.\r\n\r\nThe Russians and Germans make from Caraways a favourite\r\nliqueur \"Kummel,\" and the Germans add them as a flavouring\r\ncondiment to their sawerkraut. In France Caraways enter into the\r\ncomposition of _l'huile de Venus_, and of other renowned\r\ncordials.\r\n\r\nAn ounce of the bruised seeds infused for six hours in a pint of\r\ncold water makes a good Caraway julep for infants, from one to\r\nthree teaspoonfuls for a dose, It \"consumeth winde, and is\r\ndelightful to the stomack; the powdered seed put into a poultice\r\ntaketh away blacke and blew spots of blows and bruises.\" \"The oil,\r\nor seeds of Caraway do sharpen vision, and promote the secretion\r\nof milk.\" Therefore dimsighted men and nursing mothers may\r\ncourageously indulge in seed cake!\r\n\r\nThe name Caraway comes from the Gaelic _Caroh_, a ship, because\r\nof the shape which the fruit takes. By cultivation the root\r\nbecomes more succulent, and the fruit larger, whilst more oily, and\r\ntherefore acquiring an increase of aromatic taste and odour. In\r\nGermany the seeds are given for hysterical affections, being finely\r\npowdered and mixed with ginger and salt to spread with butter on\r\nbread. As a draught for flatulent colic twenty grains of the\r\npowdered seeds may be taken with two teaspoonfuls of sugar in a\r\nwineglassful of hot water. Caraway-seed cake was formerly a\r\nstanding institution at the feasts given by farmers to their labourers\r\nat the end of wheat sowing. But narcotic effects have been known\r\nto follow the chewing of Caraway seeds in a large quantity, such\r\nas three ounces at a time.\r\n\r\n[84] As regards its stock of honey the Caraway may be termed,\r\nlike Uriah Heep, and in a double sense, \"truly umbel.\" The\r\ndiminutive florets on its flat disk are so shallow that lepidopterous\r\nand hymenopterous insects, with their long proboses, stand no\r\nchance of getting a meal. They fare as poorly as the stork did in\r\nthe fable, whom the fox invited to dinner served on a soup plate.\r\nAs Sir John Lubbock has shown, out of fifty-five visitants to the\r\nCaraway plant for nectar, one moth, nine bees, twenty-one flies,\r\nand twenty-four miscellaneous midges constituted the dinner\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMOMILE.\r\n\r\nNo Simple in the whole catalogue of herbal medicines is possessed\r\nof a quality more friendly and beneficial to the intestines than\r\n\"Chamomile flowers.\" This herb was well known to the Greeks,\r\nwho thought it had an odour like that of apples, and therefore they\r\nnamed it \"Earth Apple,\" from two of their words, _kamai_--on the\r\nground, and _melon_--an apple. The Spaniards call it _Manzanilla_,\r\nfrom a little apple, and they give the same name to one of\r\ntheir lightest sherries flavoured with this plant. The flowers,\r\nor \"blows\" of the Chamomile belong to the daisy genus, having an\r\nouter fringe of white ray florets, with a central yellow disk, in\r\nwhich lies the chief medicinal virtue of the plant. In the cultivated\r\nChamomile the white petals increase, while the yellow centre\r\ndiminishes; thus it is that the curative properties of the wild\r\nChamomile are the more powerful. The true Chamomile is to be\r\ndistinguished from the bitter Chamomile (_matricaria chamomilla_)\r\nwhich has weaker properties, and grows erect, with several\r\nflowers at a level on the same stalk. The true Chamomile\r\ngrows prostrate, and produces but [85] one flower (with a convex,\r\nnot conical, yellow disk) from each stem, whilst its leaves are\r\ndivided into hair-like segments. The flowers exhale a powerful\r\naromatic smell, and present a peculiar bitter to the taste. When\r\ndistilled with water they yield a small quantity of most useful\r\nessential oil, which, if fresh and good, is always of a bluish colour.\r\nIt should be green or blue, and not faded to yellow. This oil is a\r\nmixture of ethers, among which \"chamomilline,\" or the valerianate\r\nof butyl, predominates. Medicinally it serves to lower nervous\r\nexcitability reflected from some organ in trouble, but remote from\r\nthe part where the pain is actually felt; so it is very useful for\r\nsuch spasmodic coughs as are due to indigestion; also for distal\r\nneuralgia, pains in the head or limbs from the same cause, and for\r\nnervous colic bowels. The oil may be given in doses of from two\r\nto four drops on a lump of sugar, or in a dessert-spoonful of milk.\r\nAn officinal tincture (_Tinctura anthemidis_) is made from the\r\nflowers of the true Chamomile (_Anthemis nobilis_) with rectified\r\nspirit of wine. The dose of this is from three to ten drops with a\r\nspoonful of water. It serves usefully to correct the summer\r\ndiarrhoea of children, or that which occurs during teething, when\r\nthe stools are green, slimy and particoloured. The true Chamomile,\r\nthe bitter Chamomile, and the Feverfew, are most obnoxious to\r\nflies and mosquitoes. An infusion of their respective leaves in\r\nspirit will, if used as a wash to the face, arms, or any exposed part\r\nof the body, protect effectually from all attack by these petty foes,\r\nwhich are quaintly described in an old version of our Bible as \"the\r\npestilence that walketh in the darkness, and the bug that destroyeth\r\nat noonday.\" Chamomile tea is an excellent stomachic when taken\r\nin moderate doses of half-a-teacupful at a [86] time. It should be\r\nmade by pouring half-a-pint of boiling water on half-an-ounce of\r\nthe dried flower heads, and letting this stand for fifteen minutes, A\r\nspecial tincture (H.) of Chammomilla is made from the bitter\r\nChamomile (_Matricaria_), which, when given in small doses of\r\nthree or four drops in a dessertspoonful of cold water every hour,\r\nwill signally relieve severe neuralgic pains, particularly if they are\r\naggravated at night. Likewise this remedy will quickly cure\r\nrestlessness and fretfulness in children from teething, and who\r\nrefuse to be soothed save by being carried about.\r\n\r\nThe name, _Matricaria_, of the bitter Chamomile is derived from\r\n_mater cara_, \"beloved mother,\" because the herb is dedicated to\r\nSt. Anne, the reputed mother of the Virgin Mary, or from matrix,\r\nas meaning \"the womb.\" This herb may be known from the true\r\nChamomile because having a large, yellow, conical disk, and no\r\nscales on the receptacles.\r\n\r\nChamomile tea is also an excellent drink for giving to aged\r\npersons an hour or more before dinner. Francatelli directs that it\r\nshould be made thus: \"Put about thirty flowers into a jug, and pour\r\na pint of boiling water on them; cover up the tea, and when it has\r\nstood for about ten minutes pour it off from the flowers into\r\nanother jug, and sweeten with sugar or honey.\" A teacupful of this\r\nChamomile tea, into which is stirred a large dessertspoonful of\r\nmoist sugar, with a little grated ginger added, will answer the\r\npurpose now indicated. For outward application, to relieve\r\ninflammatory pains, or congestive neuralgia, hot fomentations\r\nmade of the infused Chamomile \"blows\" are invaluable. Bags may\r\nbe loosely stuffed with the flowers, and steeped well in boiling\r\nwater before being applied. But for internal use the infusion and\r\nthe extract of the herb are comparatively [87] useless, because\r\nmuch of the volatile essential oil is dissipated by boiling, or by dry\r\nheat. This oil made into pills with bread crumbs, and given whilst\r\nfasting two hours before a meal, will effectually dispel intestinal\r\nworms. True Chamomile flowers may be known from spurious\r\nones (of the Feverfew) which have no bracts on the receptacle\r\nwhen the florets are removed.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that each Chamomile is a plant Physician, as\r\nnothing contributes so much to the health of a garden as a number\r\nof Chamomile herbs dispersed about it. Singularly enough, if\r\nanother plant is drooping, and apparently dying, in nine cases out\r\nof ten it will recover if you place a herb of Chamomile near it.\r\n\r\nThe stinking Chamomile (_Anthemis cotula_) or Mayweed, grows\r\nin cornfields, having a foetid smell, and often blistering the hand\r\nwhich gathers it. Another name which it bears is \"dog's fennel,\"\r\nbecause of the disagreeable odour, and the leaf resembling fennel.\r\nSimilar uses may be made of it as with the other Chamomiles, but\r\nless effectively. It has solitary flowers with erect stems.\r\n\r\nDr. Schall declares that the Chamomile is not only a preventive of\r\nnightmare, but the sole certain remedy for this complaint. As a\r\ncarminative injection for tiresome flatulence, it has been found\r\neminently beneficial to employ Chamomile flowers boiled in tripe\r\nbroth, and strained through a cloth, and with a few drops of the oil\r\nof Aniseed added to the decoction.\r\n\r\nFalstaffe says in _Henry IV_.: \"Though Chamomile, the more it is\r\ntrodden on the faster it grows; yet youth, the more it is wasted the\r\nsooner it wears.\" For coarse feeders and drunkards Chamomile is\r\npeculiarly suitable. Its infusion will cut short an attack of delirium\r\ntremens in the early stage. Gerard found the oil of the flowers [88]\r\na remedy against all weariness; and quaint old Culpeper reminds\r\nus that the Egyptians dedicated the Chamomile to the sun because\r\nit cured agues. He slyly adds: \"They were like enough to do it, for\r\nthey were the arrantest apes in their religion I ever read of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARROT.\r\n\r\nOur garden Carrot, or Dauke, is a cultivated variety of the\r\n_Dalucus sylvestris_, or wild carrot, an umbelliferous plant, which\r\ngroweth of itself in untoiled places, and is called _philtron_,\r\nbecause it serveth for love matters. This wild Carrot may be found\r\nabundantly in our fields and on the sea shore; the term Carrot\r\nbeing Celtic, and signifying \"red of colour,\" or perhaps derived\r\nfrom caro, flesh, because this is a fleshy vegetable. Daucus is from\r\nthe Greek _daio_, to burn, on account of the pungent and\r\nstimulating qualities. It is common also on our roadsides, being\r\npopularly known as \"Bee's nest,\" because the stems of its\r\nflowering head, or umbel, form a concave semi-circle, or nest,\r\nwhich bees, when belated from the hive will use as a dormitory.\r\nThe small purple flower which grows in the middle of the umbel\r\nhas been found beneficial for the cure of epilepsy. The juice of the\r\nCarrot contains \"carotine\" in red crystals; also pectin, albumen,\r\nand a particular volatile oil, on which the medicinal properties of\r\nthe root depend. The seeds are warm and aromatic to the taste,\r\nwhilst they are slightly diuretic. A tea made from the whole plant,\r\nand taken each night and morning, is excellent when the lithic\r\nacid, or gouty disposition prevails, with the deposit of a brick-dust\r\nsediment in the urine on its becoming cool.\r\n\r\nThe chief virtues of Carrots lie in the strong antiseptic qualities\r\nthey possess, which prevent all putrescent [89] changes within the\r\nbody. In Suffolk they were given long since as a secret specific for\r\npreserving and restoring the wind of horses, but cows if fed long\r\non them will make bloody urine. Wild Carrots are superior\r\nmedicinally to those of the cultivated kind. Carrot sugar got from\r\nthe inspissated juice of the roots may be used at table, and is good\r\nfor the coughs of consumptive children. The seeds of the wild\r\nCarrot were formerly esteemed as a specific remedy for jaundice;\r\nand in Savoy the peasants now give an infusion of the roots for the\r\nsame purpose; whilst this infusion has served to prevent stone in\r\nthe bladder throughout several years when the patient had been\r\npreviously subject to frequent attacks.\r\n\r\nCarrots boiled sufficiently, and mashed into a pulp, when applied\r\ndirectly to a putrid, indolent sore, will sweeten and heal it. The\r\nCarrot poultice was first used by Sulzer for mitigating the pain,\r\nand correcting the stench of foul ulcers. Raw scraped Carrot is\r\nan excellent plaster for chapped nipples. At Vichy, where\r\nderangements of the liver and of the biliary digestion are\r\nparticularly treated, Carrots in one or another form are served at\r\nevery meal, whether in soup, or as a vegetable; and considerable\r\nefficacy of cure is attributed to them. In the time of Parkinson\r\n(1640) the leaves of the Carrot were thought to be so ornamental\r\nthat ladies wore them as a head-dress instead of feathers. A good\r\nBritish wine may be brewed from the roots of the Carrot; and very\r\ntolerable bread may be prepared for travellers from these roots\r\nwhen dried and powdered. Pectic acid can be extracted by the\r\nchemist from Carrots, which will solidify plain sugared water into\r\na wholesome appetising jelly. One part of this pectic acid\r\ndissolved in a little hot water, and added to make three hundred\r\nparts of warm water, [90] is soon converted into a mass of\r\ntrembling jelly. The yellow core of the Carrot is the part which is\r\ndifficult of digestion with some persons, not the outer red layer.\r\nBefore the French Revolution the sale of Carrots and oranges was\r\nprohibited in the Dutch markets, because of the unpopular\r\naristocratic colour of these commodities. In one thousand parts of\r\na Carrot there are ninety-five of sugar, and (according to some\r\nchemists) only three of starch. In country districts raw Carrots are\r\nsometimes given to children for expelling worms, probably\r\nbecause the vegetable matter passes mechanically through the\r\nbody unchanged, and scours it. \"Remember, William,\" says Sir\r\nHugh Evans in the _Merry Wives of Windsor_, \"Focative is\r\nCaret,\" \"and that\" replies Mrs. Quickly, \"is a good root.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The man in the moon drinks claret,\r\n        But he is a dull Jack-a-dandy;\r\n    Would he know a sheep's head from a Carrot\r\n        He should learn to drink cider and brandy.\"\r\n            Song of Mad Tom in _Midsummer Night's Dream_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELANDINE (Greater, and Lesser).\r\n\r\nThis latter flower is a conspicuous herald of spring, which is\r\nstrikingly welcome to everyone living in the country throughout\r\nEngland, and a stranger to none. The Pilewort, or lesser Celandine,\r\nbespangles all our banks with its brilliant, glossy, golden stars,\r\ncoming into blossom on or about March 7th, St. Perpetua's day.\r\nThey are a timely tocsin for five o'clock tea, because punctually at\r\nthat hour they shut up their showy petals until 9.0 a.m. on the\r\nfollowing morning. The well-known little herb, with its heart-shaped\r\nleaves, is a Ranunculus, and bears the affix _ficaria_ from\r\nits curative value in the malady called _ficus_--a \"red sore in the\r\nfundament\". (Littleton, 1684).\r\n\r\n[91] The popular title, Pilewort, from _Pila_, a ball, was probably\r\nfirst acquired because, after the doctrine of signatures, the small\r\noval tubercles attached to its stringy roots were supposed to\r\nresemble and to cure piles. Nevertheless, it has been since proved\r\npractically that the whole plant, when bruised and made into an\r\nointment with fresh lard, is really useful for healing piles; as\r\nlikewise when applied to the part in the form of a poultice or hot\r\nfomentation. \"There be those also who thinke that if the herbe be\r\nbut carried about by one that hath the piles the paine forthwith\r\nceaseth.\" It has sometimes happened that the small white tubercles\r\ncollected about the roots of the plant, when washed bare by heavy\r\nrains, and lying free on the ground, have given rise to a supposed\r\nshower of wheat. After flowering the Pilewort withdraws its\r\nsubstance of leaf and stem into a small rounded tube underground,\r\nso as to withstand the heat of summer, and the cold of the\r\nsubsequent winter.\r\n\r\nWith the acrid juice of this herb, and of others belonging to the\r\nsame Ranunculous order, beggars in England used to produce\r\nsores about their body for the sake of exciting pity, and getting\r\nalms. They afterwards cured these sores by applying fresh mullein\r\nleaves to heal them. The lesser Celandine furnishes a golden\r\nyellow volatile oil, which is readily converted into anemonic acid.\r\n\r\nWordsworth specially loved this lesser Celandine, and turned his\r\nlyre to sing its praises:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is a flower that shall be mine,\r\n    'Tis the little Celandine;\r\n    I will sing as doth behove\r\n    Hymns in praise of what I love.\"\r\n\r\nIn token of which affectionate regard these flowers have been\r\ncarved on the white marble of his tomb.\r\n\r\n[92] The greater Celandine, or _Coeli donum_ (_Chelidonium\r\nmajus_), though growing freely in our waste places and hedgerows,\r\nis, perhaps, scarcely so well known as its diminutive namesake.\r\nYet most persons acquainted with our ordinary rural plants\r\nhave repeatedly come across this conspicuous herb, which\r\nexudes a bright yellow juice when bruised. It has sharply cut vivid\r\nleaves of a dull green, with a small blossom of brilliant yellow,\r\nand is not altogether unlike a buttercup, though growing to the\r\nheight of a couple of feet. But this Celandine belongs to the Poppy\r\ntribe, whilst the Buttercup is a Ranunculus. The technical name of\r\nthe greater Celandine (_Chelidonium_) comes from the Greek\r\nword _Chelidon_, a swallow, because of an ancient tradition that\r\nthe bird makes use of this herb to open the eyes of its young, or to\r\nrestore their sight when it has been lost:--\r\n\r\n    \"Caecatis pullis hac lumina mater hirundo\r\n    (Plinius ut scripsit) quamvis sint eruta, reddit.\"\r\n\r\nThe ancients entertained a strong belief that birds are gifted with a\r\nknowledge of herbs; the woodpecker, for instance, seeking out the\r\nSpringwort to remove obstructions, and the linnet making use of\r\nthe Eyebright to restore its vision.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth in the forty-sixth year of her age was attacked\r\nwith such a grievous toothache that she could obtain no rest by\r\nnight or day because of the torture she endured. The lords of her\r\ncouncil decided on sending for an \"outlandish physician\" named\r\nPenatus, who was famous for curing this agonising pain. He\r\nadvised that when all was said and done, if the tooth was hollow, it\r\nwere best to have it drawn; but as Her Majesty could not bring\r\nherself to submit to the use of [93] chirugical instruments, he\r\nsuggested that the _Chelidonius major_--our greater Celandine--\r\nshould be put into the tooth, and this stopped with wax, which\r\nwould so loosen the tooth that in a short time it might be pulled\r\nout with the fingers. Aylmer, Bishop of London, tried to\r\nencourage the Queen by telling her that though he was an old man,\r\nand had not many teeth to spare, she should see a practical\r\nexperiment made on himself. Thereupon he bade the surgeon who\r\nwas in attendance extract one of his teeth in Her Majesty's\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nThis plant, the _Chelidonium majus_, is still used in Suffolk for\r\ntoothache by way of fomentation. It goes also by the name of\r\n\"Fenugreek\" (_Foenum Groecum_), Yellow Spit, Grecian Hay,\r\nand by that of Tetterwort. The root contains chemically \"chelidonin\"\r\nand \"sanguinarin.\"\r\n\r\nOn the doctrine of signatures the herb, because of its bright\r\norange-coloured juice, was formerly believed to be curative of\r\njaundice. A medicinal tincture (H.) made from the entire plant\r\nwith spirit of wine is at the present time held in high esteem by\r\nmany physicians for overcoming torpid conditions of the liver. Eight\r\nor ten drops of this tincture, or of the fresh juice of the plant,\r\nmay be given for a dose three times in the day in sweetened water\r\nwhen bilious yellowness of the skin is present, with itching, and\r\nwith clayey stools, dark thick urine, constipation, and a pain in the\r\nright shoulder; also for neuralgia of the head and face on the right\r\nside. It is certainly remarkable that though the fanciful theory of\r\nchoosing curative plants by their signatures has been long since\r\nexploded, yet doctors of to-day select several yellow medicines for\r\ntreating biliary disorders--to wit, this greater Celandine with its\r\nochreous juice; the Yellow Barberry; the Dandelion; [94] the\r\nGolden Seal (Hydrastis); the Marigold; Orange; Saffron; and\r\nTomato. Animals poisoned by the greater Celandine have developed\r\nactive and pernicious congestion of the lungs and liver.\r\nClusius found by experience that the juice of the greater\r\nCelandine, when squeezed into small green wounds of what sort\r\nso ever, wonderfully cured them. \"If the juice to the bigness of a\r\npin's head be dropped into the eye in the morning in bed, it takes\r\naway outward specks, and stops incipient suffusions.\" Also if the\r\nyellow juice is applied to warts, or to corns, first gently scraped,\r\nit will cure them promptly and painlessly. The greater Celandine is\r\nby genus closely allied to the horned Poppy which grows so\r\nabundantly on our coasts. Its tincture given in small doses proves\r\nof considerable service in whooping-cough when very spasmodic.\r\n\r\nCurious remedies for this complaint have found rustic favour: in\r\nYorkshire owl broth is considered to be a specific; again in\r\nGloucestershire a roasted mouse is given to be eaten by the\r\npatient; and in Staffordshire the child is made to look at the new\r\nmoon whilst the right hand of the nurse is rubbed up and down its\r\nbare belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCELERY.\r\n\r\nThe Parsleys are botanically named _Selinon_, and by some verbal\r\naccident, through the middle letter \"n\" in this word being changed\r\ninto \"r,\" making it _Seliron_, or, in the Italian, Celeri, our Celery\r\n(which is a Parsley) obtained its title. It is a cultivated variety of\r\nthe common Smallage (_Small ache_) or wild Celery (_Apium\r\ngraveolens_), which grows abundantly in moist English ditches, or\r\nin water. This is an umbelliferous herb, unwholesome as a food,\r\nand having a coarse root, with [95] a fetid smell. But, like many\r\nothers of the same natural order, when transplanted into the\r\ngarden, and bleached, it becomes aromatic and healthful, making\r\nan excellent condimentary vegetable. But more than this, the\r\ncultivated Celery may well take rank as a curative Herbal Simple.\r\nDr. Pereira has shown us that it contains sulphur (a known\r\npreventive of rheumatism) as freely as do the cruciferous plants,\r\nMustard, and the Cresses. In 1879, Mr. Gibson Ward, then\r\nPresident of the Vegetarian Society, wrote some letters to the\r\nTimes, which commanded much attention, about Celery as a food\r\nand a medicament. \"Celery,\" said he, \"when cooked, is a very fine\r\ndish, both as a nutriment and as a purifier of the blood; I will not\r\nattempt to enumerate all the marvellous cures I have made with\r\nCelery, lest medical men should be worrying me _en masse_. Let\r\nme fearlessly say that rheumatism is impossible on this diet; and\r\nyet English doctors in 1876 allowed rheumatism to kill three\r\nthousand six hundred and forty human beings, every death being\r\nas unnecessary as is a dirty face.\"\r\n\r\nThe seeds of our Sweet Celery are carminative, and act on the\r\nkidneys. An admirable tincture is made from these seeds, when\r\nbruised, with spirit of wine; of which a teaspoonful may be taken\r\nthree times a day, with a spoonful or two of water. The root of the\r\nWild Celery, Smallage, or Marsh Parsley, was reckoned, by the\r\nancients, one of the five great aperient roots, and was employed in\r\ntheir diet drinks. The Great Parsley is the Large Age, or Large\r\nAche; as a strange inconsistency the Romans adorned the heads of\r\ntheir guests, and the tombs of their dead with crowns of the\r\nSmallage. Our cultivated Celery is a capital instance of fact that\r\nmost of the poisonous plants call, by [96] human ingenuity, be so\r\naltered in character as to become eminently serviceable for food or\r\nmedicine. Thus, the Wild Celery, which is certainly poisonous\r\nwhen growing exposed to daylight, becomes most palatable, and\r\neven beneficial, by having its edible leaf stalks earthed up and\r\nbleached during their time of cultivation.\r\n\r\nDr. Pereira says the digestibility of Celery is increased by its\r\nmaceration in vinegar. As taken at table, Celery possesses certain\r\nqualities which tend to soothe nervous irritability, and to relieve\r\nsick headaches. \"This herb Celery [Sellery] is for its high and\r\ngrateful taste,\" says John Evelyn, in his _Acetaria_, \"ever placed\r\nin the middle of the grand sallet at our great men's tables, and our\r\nPraetor's feasts, as the grace of the whole board.\" It contains some\r\nsugar and a volatile odorous principle, which in the wild plant\r\nsmells and tastes strongly and disagreeably. The characteristic\r\nodour and flavour of the cultivated plant are due to this essential\r\noil, which has now become of modified strength and qualities; also\r\nwhen freshly cut it affords albumen, starch, mucilage, and mineral\r\nmatter. Why Celery accompanies cheese at the end of dinner it is\r\nnot easy to see. This is as much a puzzle as why sucking pig and\r\nprune sauce should be taken in combination,--of which delicacies\r\nJames Bloomfield Rush, the Norwich murderer, desired that plenty\r\nshould be served for his supper the night before he was hanged, on\r\nApril 20th, 1849.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTAURY.\r\n\r\nOf all the bitter appetising herbs which grow in our fields and\r\nhedgerows, and which serve as excellent simple tonics, the\r\nCentaury, particularly its white flowered variety, belonging to the\r\nGentian order of [97] plants, is the most efficacious. It shares in an\r\nabundant measure the restorative antiseptic virtues of the Field\r\nGentian and the Buckbean. There are four wild varieties of the\r\nCentaury, square stemmed, and each bearing flat tufts of flowers\r\nwhich are more or less rose coloured. The ancients named this\r\nbitter plant the Gall of the Earth, and it is now known as Christ's\r\nLadder, or Felwort.\r\n\r\nThough growing commonly in dry pastures, in woods, and on\r\nchalky cliffs, yet the Centaury cannot be reared in a garden. Of old\r\nits tribe was called \"Chironia,\" after Chiron, the Greek Centaur,\r\nwell skilled in herbal physic; and most probably the name of our\r\nEnglish plant was thus originated. But the Germans call the Centaury\r\n_Tausendgulden kraut_--\"the herb of a thousand florins,\"--either\r\nbecause of its medicinal value, or as a corruption of _Centum\r\naureum_, \"a hundred golden sovereigns.\" Centaury has become\r\npopularly reduced in Worcestershire to Centre of the Sun.\r\nIts generic adjective \"erythroea\" signifies red. The flowers\r\nopen only in fine weather, and not after twelve o'clock (noon) in\r\nthe day. Chemically the herb contains erythrocentaurin--a bitter\r\nprinciple of compound character,--together with the usual herbal\r\nconstituents, but with scarcely any tannin. The tops of the\r\nCentaury, especially of that _flore albo_--with the light coloured\r\npetals--are given in infusion, or in powder, or when made into an\r\nextract. For languid digestion, with heartburn after food, and a\r\nwant of appetite, the infusion prepared with cold water, an ounce\r\nof the herb to a pint is best; but for muscular rheumatism the\r\ninfusion should be made with boiling water. A wineglass of either\r\nwill be the proper dose, two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[98] CHERRY.\r\n\r\nThe wild Cherry (_Cerasus_), which occurs of two distinct kinds,\r\nhas by budding and grafting begotten most of our finest garden\r\nfruits of its genus. The name _Cerasus _was derived from\r\nKerasous, a city of Cappadocia, where the fruit was plentiful.\r\nAccording to Pliny, Cherries were first brought to Rome by\r\nLucullus after his great victory over Mithridates, 89 B.C. The\r\ncultivated Cherry disappeared in this country during the Saxon\r\nperiod, and was not re-introduced until the reign of Henry VIII.\r\nThe _Cerasus sylvestris _is a wild Cherry tree rising to the height\r\nof thirty or forty feet, and producing innumerable small globose\r\nfruits; whilst the _Cerasus vulgaris_, another wild Cherry, is a\r\nmere shrub, called _Cerevisier_ in France, of which the fruit is\r\nsour and bitter. Cherry stones have been found in the primitive\r\nlake dwellings of Western Switzerland. There is a tradition that\r\nChrist gave a Cherry to St. Peter, admonishing him not to despise\r\nlittle things. In the time of Charles the First, Herrick, the\r\nclergyman poet, wrote a simple song, to which our well-known\r\npretty \"Cherry Ripe\" has been adapted:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cherry ripe! ripe! I cry,\r\n    Full and fair ones I come, and buy!\r\n    If so be you ask me where\r\n    They do grow: I answer there\r\n    Where my Julia's lips do smile,\r\n    There's the land: a cherry isle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cherries on the ryse\" (or, on twigs) was well known as a London\r\nstreet cry in the fifteenth century; but these were probably the\r\nfruit of the wild Cherry, or Gean tree. In France soup made from\r\nCherries, and taken with bread, is the common sustenance of the\r\nwood cutters and charcoal burners of the forest during the [99]\r\nwinter. The French distil from Cherries a liqueur named _Eau de\r\nCerises_, or, in German, _Kirschwasser_; whilst the Italians\r\nprepare from a Cherry called _Marusca_ the liqueur noted as\r\n_Marasquin_. Cherries termed as Mazzards are grown in Devon\r\nand Cornwall, A gum exudes from the bark of the Cherry tree\r\nwhich is equal in value to gum arabic. A caravan going from\r\nEthiopia to Egypt, says Husselquist, and a garrison of more than\r\ntwo hundred men during a siege which lasted two months, were\r\nkept alive with no other food than this gum, \"which they sucked\r\noften and slowly.\" It is known chemically as \"cerasin,\" and differs\r\nfrom gum acacia in being less soluble.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the tree and the kernels of the fruit contain a basis\r\nof prussic acid.\r\n\r\nThe American wild Cherry (_Prunus virginiana_) yields from its\r\nbark a larger quantity of the prussic acid principle, which is\r\nsedative to the nervous centres, and also some considerable tannin.\r\nAs an infusion, or syrup, or vegetable extract, it will allay nervous\r\npalpitation of the heart, and will quiet the irritative hectic cough of\r\nconsumption, whilst tending to ameliorate the impaired digestion.\r\nIts preparations can be readily had from our leading druggists, and\r\nare found to be highly useful. A teaspoonful of the syrup, with one\r\nor two tablespoonfuls of cold water, is a dose for an adult every\r\nthree or four hours. The oozing of the gum-tears from the trunk\r\nand boughs is due to the operation of a minute parasitic fungus.\r\nHelena, in the _Midsummer Night's Dream_, paints a charming\r\npicture of the close affection between Hermia and herself--\r\n\r\n            \"So we grew together\r\n    Like to a double Cherry-seeming parted,\r\n    But yet a union in partition:\r\n    Two lovely berries moulded on one stem.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERVIL, or BEAKED PARSLEY.\r\n\r\n\"There is found,\" writes Parkinson, \"during June and July, in almost\r\nevery English hedge, a certain plant called _Choerophyllum_,\r\nin show very like unto Hemlockes, of a good and pleasant\r\nsmell and taste, which have caused us to term it 'Sweet Chervill.'\"\r\nAnd in modern times this plant has taken rank as a pot herb\r\nin our gardens, though its virtues and uses are not sufficiently\r\nknown. \"The root is great, thick and long, exceedingly sweet\r\nin smell, and tasting like unto anise seeds. This root is much\r\nused among the Dutch people in a kind of loblolly or hotchpot,\r\nwhich they do eat, calling it _warmus_. The seeds taken as a salad\r\nwhilst they are yet green, exceed all other salads by many degrees\r\nin pleasantness of taste, sweetness of smell, and wholesomeness\r\nfor the cold and feeble stomach.\" In common with other camphoraceous\r\nand strongly aromatic herbs, by reason of its volatile oil\r\nand its terebinthine properties, the Scandix, or Sweet Chervil,\r\nwas entitled to make one of the choice spices used for composing\r\nthe holy oil with which the sacred vessels of the Tabernacle\r\nwere anointed by Moses. It belongs to the particular group\r\nof umbelliferous plants which is endowed with balsamic gums,\r\nand with carminative essences appealing powerfully to the\r\nsense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe herb Chervil was in the mind of Roman Catullus when discoursing\r\nsweet verses of old to his friend Fabullus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nam unguentum dabo quod meoe puelloe\r\n    Donarunt veneres, cupidinesque.\r\n    Quod tu quum olfacies deo rogabis\r\n    Totum ut te faciat. Fabulle! nasum.\"\r\n\r\n    \"I will give you a perfume my damsels gave me,\r\n    Sweet daughters of Venus, sad hoydens are ye!\r\n    Which the moment you smell will incite you to pray\r\n    My Fabullus! to live as 'all nose' from that day.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn taught (1565) that \"the tender tops of Cherville should\r\nnever be wanting in our sallets, being exceeding wholesome, and\r\nchearing the spirits; also that the roots boiled and cold are to be\r\nmuch commended for aged persons.\" But in 1745 several Dutch\r\nsoldiers were poisoned by eating the rough wild Chervil, from\r\nwhich the cultivated sweet variety is to be distinguished by its\r\nhaving its stems swollen beneath the joints--much as our\r\nblue-blooded patricians are signalised by gouty knuckles and\r\nbunioned feet.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name of the Sweet Chervil (_Choerophyllum_)\r\nsignifies a plant which rejoices the heart--_Kairei-phyllum_. \"The\r\nroots,\" said an old writer, \"are very good for old people that are\r\ndull and without courage; they gladden and comfort the spirits,\r\nand do increase their lusty strength.\" The juice is slightly aperient,\r\nand abundantly lacteal when mixed with goat's milk, or in gruel.\r\nPhysicians formerly held this herb in high esteem, as capable of\r\ncuring most chronic disorders connected with the urinary\r\npassages, and gravel. Some have even asserted that if these\r\ndistempers will not yield to a constant use of Chervil, they win be\r\nscarcely curable by any other medicine. The Wild Chervil will\r\n\"help to dissolve any tumours or swellings in all parts of the body\r\nspeedily, if applied to the place, as also to take away the spots and\r\nmarks in the flesh and skin, of congealed blood by blows or\r\nbruises.\" The feathery leaves of Chervil, which are of a bright\r\nemerald hue in the spring, become of a rich purple in the\r\nautumn, just as the objectionably carroty locks of Tittlebat\r\nTitmouse, in _Ten Thousand a Year_, became vividly green under\r\n\"Cyanochaitanthropopoin,\" and were afterwards strangely empurpled\r\nby \"Tetragmenon abracadabra,\" at nine and sixpence the bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[102] CHESTNUTS (Horse, and Sweet).\r\n\r\nEver since 1633 the Horse Chestnut tree has grown and flourished\r\nin England, having been brought at first from the mountains of\r\nNorthern Asia. For the most part it is rather known and admired\r\nfor its wealth of shade, its large handsome floral spikes of creamy,\r\npink-tinted blossom, and its white, soft wood, than supposed to\r\nexercise useful medicinal properties. But none the less is this tree\r\nremarkable for the curative virtues contained in its large nuts of\r\nmahogany polish, its broad palmate leaves, and its smooth silvery\r\nbark. These virtues have been discovered and made public\r\nespecially by physicians and chemists of the homoeopathic school.\r\nFrom the large digitated leaves an extract is made which has\r\nproved of service in whooping-cough, and of which from one-third\r\nto half a teaspoonful may be given for a dose. On the Continent\r\nthe bark is held in estimation for cutting short attacks of\r\nintermittent fever and ague by acting in the same way as Peruvian\r\nbark, though it is much more astringent. But the nuts are chiefly to\r\nbe regarded as the medicinal belongings of the Horse Chestnut\r\ntree; and their bodily sphere of action is the rectum, or lower\r\nbowel, in cases of piles, and of obstinate constipation. Their use is\r\nparticularly indicated when the bottom of the back gives out on\r\nwalking, with aching and a sense of weariness in that region.\r\nLikewise, signal relief is found to be wrought by the same remedy\r\nwhen the throat is duskily red and dry, in conjunction with\r\ncostiveness, and piles. A tincture is made (H.) from the ripe nuts\r\nwith spirit of wine, for the purposes described above, or the nuts\r\nthemselves are finely powdered and given in that form. These nuts\r\nare starchy, and contain so much potash, that they may be\r\nused when boiled for washing purposes. [103] In France and\r\nSwitzerland they are employed for cleansing wool and bleaching\r\nlinen, on account of their \"saponin.\" Botanically, the Horse\r\nChestnut is named _AEsculus hippocastanea_--the first word\r\ncoming from _esca_, food; and the second from _hippos_, a horse;\r\nand _Castana_, the city, so called. The epithet \"horse\" does not\r\nimply any remedial use in diseases of that animal, but rather the\r\nsize and coarseness of this species as compared with the Sweet\r\nSpanish Chestnut. In the same way we talk of the horse radish, the\r\nhorse daisy, and the horse leech. In Turkey the fruit is given to\r\nhorses touched or broken in the wind, but in this country horses\r\nwill not eat it. Nevertheless, Horse Chestnuts may be used for\r\nfattening cattle, particularly sheep, the nuts being cut up, and\r\nmixed with oats, or beans. Their bitterness can be removed by first\r\nwashing the Chestnuts in lime water. Medicinally, the ripe nut of\r\nthis tree is employed, being collected in September or October,\r\nand deprived of its shell. The odour of the flowers is powerful and\r\npeculiar. No chemical analysis of them, or of the nuts, has been\r\nmade, but they are found to contain tannin freely. Rich-coloured,\r\nof a reddish brown, and glossy, these nuts have given their name\r\nto a certain shade of mellow dark auburn hair. Rosalind, in _As\r\nYou Like It_, says \"Orlando's locks are of a good colour: I' faith\r\nyour Chestnut was ever the only colour.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Horse Chestnut tincture, two or three drops, with a spoonful\r\nof water, taken before meals and at bedtime, will cure almost any\r\nsimple case of piles in a week. Also, carrying a Horse Chestnut\r\nabout the person, is said to obviate giddiness, and to prevent piles.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether, the Horse Chestnut, for its splendour of\r\nblossom, and wealth of umbrageous leaf, [104] its polished\r\nmahogany fruit, and its special medicinal virtues, is _facile\r\nprinceps_ the belle of our English trees. But, like many a\r\nball-room beauty, when the time comes for putting aside the gay leafy\r\nattire, it is sadly untidy, and makes a great litter of its cast-off\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nIt has been ingeniously suggested that the cicatrix of the leaf\r\nresembles a horse-shoe, with all its nails evenly placed.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Spanish Chestnut tree is grown much less commonly in\r\nthis country, and its fruit affords only material for food, without\r\npossessing medicinal properties; though, in the United States of\r\nAmerica, an infusion of the leaves is thought to be useful for\r\nstaying the paroxysms of whooping-cough. Of all known nuts, this\r\n(the Sweet Chestnut, Stover Nut, or Meat Nut) is the most\r\nfarinaceous and least oily; hence it is more easy of digestion than\r\nany other. To mountaineers it is invaluable, so that on the\r\nApennines and the Pyrenees the Chestnut harvest is the event of\r\nthe year. The Italian Chestnut-cakes, called _necci_, contain forty\r\nper cent. of nutritious matter soluble in cold water; and Chestnut\r\nflour, when properly prepared, is a capital food for children.\r\n\r\nTo be harvested the Chestnuts are spread on a frame of lattice-work\r\noverhead, and a fire is kept burning underneath. When dry the\r\nfruit is boiled, or steamed, or roasted, or ground into a kind of\r\nflour, with which puddings are made, or an excellent kind of bread\r\nis produced. The ripe Chestnut possesses a fine creamy flavour,\r\nand when roasted it becomes almost aromatic. A good way to cook\r\nChestnuts is to boil them for twenty minutes, and then place them\r\nfor five minutes more in a Dutch oven.\r\n\r\nIt was about the fruit of the Spanish tree Shakespeare [105] said:\r\n\"A woman's tongue gives not half so great a blow to the ear as will\r\na Chestnut in a farmer's fire.\" In the United States of America an\r\nold time-worn story, or oft repeated tale, is called in banter a\r\n\"Chestnut,\" and a stale joker is told \"not to rattle the Chestnuts.\"\r\n\r\nFor convalescents, after a long serious illness, the French make a\r\nchocolate of sweet Chestnuts, which is highly restorative. The nuts\r\nare first cooked in _eau de vie_ until their shells and the pellicle\r\nof the kernels can be peeled off; then they are beaten into a pulp\r\ntogether with sufficient milk and sugar, with some cinnamon\r\nadded. The mixture is afterwards boiled with more milk, and\r\nfrothed up in a chocolate pot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKWEED.\r\n\r\nChickweed--called _Alsine_ or _Stellaria media_, a floral star of\r\nmiddle magnitude--belongs to the Clove-pink order of plants, and,\r\ndespite the most severe weather, grows with us all the year round,\r\nin waste places by the roadsides, and as a garden weed. It is easily\r\nknown by its fresh-looking, juicy, verdant little leaves, and by its\r\ntiny white star-like flowers; also by a line of small stiff hairs,\r\nwhich runs up one side of the stalk like a vegetable hog-mane, and\r\nwhen it reaches a pair of leaves immediately shifts its position, and\r\nruns up higher on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe fact of our finding Chickweed (and Groundsel) in England, as\r\nwell as on the mainland of Europe, affords a proof that Britain,\r\nwhen repeopled after the great Ice age, must have been united\r\nsomewhere to the continent; and its having lasted from earliest\r\ntimes throughout Europe, North America, and Siberia, seems to\r\nshow that this modest plant must be possessed of some universal\r\nutility which has enabled it to hold its own [106] until now in the\r\ngreat evolutionary struggle. It grows wild allover the earth, and\r\nserves as food for small birds, such as finches, linnets, and other\r\nfeathered songsters of the woods. Moreover, we read in the old\r\nherbal of Turner: _Qui alunt aviculas caveis inclusas hoc solent\r\nillas si quando cibos fastigiant recreare_--or, as Gerard translates\r\nthis: \"Little birds in cages are refreshed with Chickweed when\r\nthey loath their meat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chickweed is termed _Alsine--quia lucos, vel alsous amat_--\r\nbecause it loves to grow in shady places This small herb abounds\r\nwith the earthy salts of potash, which are admirable against\r\nscurvy when thus found in nature's laboratory, and a continued\r\ndeprivation from which always proves disastrous to mankind.\r\n\"The water of Chickweed,\" says an old writer, \"is given to\r\nchildren for their fits, and its juice is used for their gripes.\" When\r\nboiled, the plant may be eaten instead of Spinach. Its fresh juice if\r\nrubbed on warts, first pared to the quick, will presently cause them\r\nto fall off.\r\n\r\nFresh Chickweed juice, as proved medicinally in 1893, produced\r\nsharp rheumatic pains and stitches in the head and eyes, with a\r\ngeneral feeling of being bruised; also pressure about the liver and\r\nsoreness there, with sensations of burning, and of bilious\r\nindigestion. Subsequently, the herb, when given in quite small\r\ndoses of tincture, or fresh juice, or infusion, has been found by its\r\naffinity to remove the train of symptoms just described, and to act\r\nmost reliably in curing obstinate rheumatism allied therewith.\r\nFurthermore, a poultice prepared from the fresh green juicy leaves,\r\nis emollient and cooling, whilst an ointment made from them with\r\nhog's lard, is manifestly healing.\r\n\r\nWhen rain is impending, the flowers remain closed; [107] and the\r\nplant teaches an exemplary matrimonial lesson, seeing that at night\r\nits leaves approach one another in loving pairs, and sleep with the\r\ntender buds protected between them. Culpeper says: \"Chickweed\r\nis a fine, soft, pleasing herb, under the dominion of the moon, and\r\ngood for many things.\" Parkinson orders thus: \"To make a salve fit\r\nto heal sore legs, boil a handful of Chickweed with a handful of\r\nred rose leaves in a pint of the oil of trotters or sheep's feet, and\r\nanoint the grieved places therewith against a fire each evening and\r\nmorning; then bind some of the herb, if ye will, to the sore, and so\r\nshall ye find help, if God will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS ROSE--BLACK HELLEBORE.\r\n\r\nThis well-known plant, a native of Southern Europe, and belonging\r\nto the Ranunculus order, is grown commonly in our gardens\r\nfor the sake of its showy white flowers, conspicuous in winter,\r\nfrom December to February. The root has been famous since\r\ntime immemorial as a remedy for insanity. From its abundant\r\ngrowth in the Grecian island of Anticyra arose the proverb:\r\n_Naviget Anticyram_--\"Take a voyage to Anticyra,\" as applied\r\nby way of advice to a man who has lost his reason.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh the root is very acrid, and will blister the skin. If dried\r\nand given as powder it will cause vomiting and purging, also\r\nprovoking sneezing when smelt, and inducing the monthly flow of\r\na woman. This root contains a chemical glucoside--\"helleborin,\"\r\nwhich, if given in full doses, stimulates the kidneys to such an\r\nexcess that their function becomes temporarily paralyzed. It\r\ntherefore happens that a medicinal tincture (H.) made from the\r\nfresh root collected at Christmas, just before the plant would\r\nflower, when [108] taken in small doses, will promptly relieve\r\ndropsy, especially a sudden dropsical swelling of the skin, with\r\npassive venous congestion of the kidneys, as in scrofulous\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA former method of administering the root was by sticking a\r\nparticularly sweet apple full of its fibres, and roasting this under\r\nhot embers; then the fibres were withdrawn, and the apple was\r\neaten by the patient.\r\n\r\nTaken by mischance in any quantity the root is highly poisonous:\r\none ounce of a watery decoction has caused death in eight hours,\r\nwith vomiting, giddiness, insensibility, and palsy. Passive dropsy\r\nin children after scarlet fever may be effectually cured by small\r\ndoses of the tincture, third decimal strength.\r\n\r\nThe name Hellebore, as applied to the plant, comes from the\r\nGreek _Elein_--to injure, and _Bora_--fodder. It is also known as\r\n_Melampodium_, being thus designated because Melampus, a\r\nphysician in the Peloponnesus (B.C. 1530) watched the effect on\r\nhis goats when they had eaten the leaves, and cured therewith the\r\ninsane daughters of Proetus, King of Argos.\r\n\r\nIt was famous among the Egyptian and Greek doctors of old as the\r\nmost effectual remedy for the diseases of mania, epilepsy,\r\napoplexy, dropsy, and gout. The tincture is very useful in mental\r\nstupor, with functional impairment of the hearing and sight;\r\nlikewise for strumous water on the brain.\r\n\r\nThe original reputation of this herb was acquired because of its\r\npurgative properties, which enabled it to carry off black bile which\r\nwas causing insanity.\r\n\r\nNo tannin is contained in the root. A few drops of the juice\r\nobtained therefrom, if dropped warm into the ear each night and\r\nmorning, will cure singing and noises in the ears. A proper dose of\r\nthe powdered root [109] is from five to ten grains. Snuff made\r\nwith this powder has cured night blindness, as among the French\r\nprisoners at Norman Cross in 1806. The Gauls used to rub the\r\npoints of their hunting spears with Hellebore, believing the game\r\nthey killed was thus rendered more tender. Hahnemann said that at\r\nleast one third of the cases of insanity occurring in lunatic asylums\r\nmay be cured by this and the white Hellebore (an allied plant) in\r\nsuch small doses as of the tincture twelfth dilution, given in the\r\npatient's drink.\r\n\r\nA bastard Hellebore, which is _foetidus_, or, \"stinking,\" and is\r\nknown to rustics as Bearsfoot, because of its digitate leaves, grows\r\nfrequently near houses in this country, though a doubtful native.\r\nThe sepals of its flowers are purple, and the leaves are evergreen;\r\nthe petals are green and leaf-like, whilst the nectaries are large and\r\ntubular, often containing small flies. The nectar is reputed to be\r\npoisonous. Again, this plant bears the names Pegroots, Oxbeel,\r\nOxheal, and Setterwort, because used for \"settering\" cattle. A\r\npiece of the root is inserted as a seton (so-called from _seta_--a\r\nhank of silk) into the dewlap, and this is termed \"pegging,\" or,\r\n\"settering,\" for the benefit of diseased lungs. \"The root,\" says\r\nGerard, \"consists of many small black strings, involved or wrapped\r\none within another very intricately.\" The smell of the fresh plant is\r\nextremely fetid, and, when taken, it will purge, or provoke\r\nvomiting. The leaves are very useful for expelling worms. Dr.\r\nWoodville says their juice made into a syrup, with coarse sugar, is\r\nalmost the only vermifuge he had used against round worms for\r\nthree years past. \"If these leaves be dried in an oven after the bread\r\nis drawne out, and the powder thereof be taken in a figge, or raisin,\r\nor strewed upon a piece of [110] bread spread with honey, and\r\neaten, it killeth worms in children exceedingly.\" A decoction made\r\nwith one drachm of the green leaves, or about fifteen grains of the\r\ndried leaves in powder, is the usual dose for a child between four\r\nand six years of age; but a larger dose will provoke sickness, or\r\ndiarrhoea. The medicine should be repeated on two or three\r\nconsecutive mornings; and it will be found that the second dose\r\nacts more powerfully than the first, \"never failing to expel round\r\nworms by stool, if there be any lodged in the alimentary tube.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVER.\r\n\r\nIn this country we possess about twenty species of the trefoil, or\r\nClover, which is a plant so well known in its general features by\r\nits abundance in every field and on every grass plot, as not to need\r\nany detailed description. The special variety endowed with\r\nmedicinal and curative virtues, is the Meadow Clover (_Trifolium\r\npratense_), or red clover, called by some, Cocksheads, and\r\nfamiliar to children as Suckles, or Honey-suckles, because of the\r\nabundant nectar in the long tubes of its corollae. Other names for it\r\nare Bee-bread, and Smere. An extract of this red clover is now\r\nconfidently said to have the power of healing scrofulous sores, and\r\nof curing cancer. The _New York Tribune_ of September, 1884,\r\nrelated a case of indisputable cancer of the breast of six years'\r\nstanding, with an open fetid sore, which had penetrated the\r\nchest-wall between the ribs, and which was radically healed by a\r\nprolonged internal use of the extract of red clover. Four years\r\nafterwards, in September, 1888, \"the breast was found to be\r\nrestored to its normal condition, all but a small place the size of\r\nhalf a dollar, which will in every probability become absorbed like\r\n[111] the rest, so that the patient is considered by her physicians to\r\nbe absolutely cured.\"\r\n\r\nThe likelihood is that whatever virtue the red clover can boast for\r\ncounteracting a scrofulous disposition, and as antidotal to cancer,\r\nresides in its highly-elaborated lime, silica, and other earthy salts.\r\nMoreover, this experience is not new. Sir Spencer Wells, twenty\r\nyears ago, recorded some cases of confirmed cancer cured by\r\ntaking powdered and triturated oyster shells; whilst egg shells\r\nsimilarly reduced to a fine dust have proved equally efficacious. It\r\nis remarkable that if the moorlands in the North of England, and in\r\nsome parts of Ireland, are turned up for the first time, and strewed\r\nwith lime, white clover springs up there in abundance.\r\n\r\nAgain, a syrup is made from the flowers of the red clover, which\r\nhas a trustworthy reputation for curing whooping-cough, and of\r\nwhich a teaspoonful may be taken three or four times in the day.\r\nAlso stress is laid on the healing of skin eruptions in children, by a\r\ndecoction of the purple and white meadow trefoils.\r\n\r\nThe word clover is a corruption of the Latin _clava_ a club; and\r\nthe \"clubs\" on our playing cards are representations of clover\r\nleaves; whilst in France the same black suit is called _trefle_.\r\n\r\nA conventional trefoil is figured on our coins, both Irish and\r\nEnglish, this plant being the National Badge of Ireland. Its charm\r\nhas been ever supposed there as an unfailing protection against\r\nevil influences, as is attested by the spray in the workman's cap,\r\nand in the bosom of the cotter's wife.\r\n\r\nThe clover trefoil is in some measure a sensitive plant; \"its\r\nleaves,\" said Pliny, \"do start up as if afraid of an assault when\r\ntempestuous weather is at hand.\"\r\n\r\n[112] The phrase, \"living in clover,\" alludes to cattle being put to\r\nfeed in rich pasturage.\r\n\r\nA sworn foe to the purple clover cultivated by farmers, is the\r\nDodder (_Cuscuta trifolii_), a destructive vegetable parasite which\r\nstrangles the plants in a crafty fashion, and which goes by the\r\nname of \"hellweed,\" or \"devil's guts.\" It lies in ambush like a\r\npigmy field octopus, with deadly suckers for draining the sap of its\r\nvictims. These it mats together in its wiry, sinuous coils, and\r\nchokes relentlessly by the acre. Nevertheless, the petty garotter--\r\nlike a toad, \"ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in its\r\nhead.\" \"If boiled,\" says Hill, \"with a little ginger, the dodder in\r\ndecoction works briskly as a purge. Also, the thievish herb, when\r\nbruised and applied externally to scrofulous tumours, is an\r\nexcellent remedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"dodder\" signifies the plural of \"dodd,\" a bunch of\r\nthreads. The parasite is sometimes called \"Red tangle\" and \"Lady's\r\nlaces.\"\r\n\r\nIts botanical name _Cuscuta_ comes from the Greek _Kassuo_--to\r\nsew together. If the piece of land infested with it is closely mown\r\n(and the cut material carried away unshaken), being next covered\r\nwith deal saw-dust, on which a ten per cent. solution of sulphate of\r\niron is freely poured, then by combining with the tannin contained\r\nin the stems of the Dodder, this will serve to kill the parasite\r\nwithout doing any injury to the clover or lucerne. Although a\r\nparasite the plant springs every year from seed. It is a remedy for\r\nswooning or fainting fits.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Clover (or yellow Melilot), when prepared as a tincture\r\n(H.), with spirit of wine, and given as a medicine in material\r\ndoses, causes, in sensitive persons, a severe headache, sometimes\r\nwith a determination of [113] blood to the head, and bleeding from\r\nthe nose. When administered, on the principle of curative affinity,\r\nin much smaller doses, it is singularly beneficial against nervous\r\nheadaches, with oppression of the brain, acting helpfully within\r\nfive minutes. Dr. Hughes (Brighton) writes: \"I value this medicine\r\nmuch in nervous headaches, and I always carry it in my pocket-case--\r\nas the mother tincture--which I generally administer _by olfaction_.\"\r\nFor epilepsy, it is said in the United States of America\r\nto be \"the one grand master-remedy,\" by giving a drop of the\r\ntincture every five minutes during the attack, and five drops five\r\ntimes a day in water, for some weeks afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe Melilot (from _mel_, honey, and _lotus_, because much liked\r\nby bees) is known as Plaster Clover from its use since Galen's time\r\nin plasters for dispersing tumours. Continental physicians still\r\nemploy the same made of melilot, wax, resin, and olive oil. The\r\nplant contains, \"Coumarin\" in common with the Sweet Woodruff,\r\nand the Tonquin Bean. Other names for it are \"Harts' Clover,\"\r\nbecause deer delight to feed on it and \"King's Clover\" or \"Corona\r\nRegis,\" because \"the yellow flouers doe crown the top of the\r\nstalkes as with a chaplet of gold.\" It is an herbaceous plant\r\ncommon in waste places, and having light green leaves; when\r\ndried it smells like Woodruff, or new hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUB MOSS.\r\n\r\nThough not generally thought worth more than a passing notice, or\r\nto possess any claims of a medicinal sort, yet the Club Moss,\r\nwhich is of common growth in Great Britain on heaths and hilly\r\npastures, exerts by its spores very remarkable curative effects, and\r\n[114] therefore it should be favourably regarded as a Herbal\r\nSimple. It is exclusively due to homoeopathic provings and\r\npractice, that the _Lycopodium clavatum _(Club Moss) takes an\r\nimportant position amongst the most curative vegetable remedies\r\nof the present day.\r\n\r\nThe word _lycopodium_ means \"wolf's claw,\" because of the\r\nclaw-like ends to the trailing stems of this moss; and the word\r\nclavatum signifies that its inflorescence resembles a club. The\r\nspores of Club Moss constitute a fine pale-yellow, dusty powder\r\nwhich is unctuous, tasteless, inodorous, and only medicinal when\r\npounded in all agate mortar until the individual spores, or nuts, are\r\nfractured.\r\n\r\nBy being thus triturated, the nuts give out their contents, which are\r\nshown to be oil globules, wherein the curative virtues of the moss\r\nreside. Sugar of milk is then rubbed up for two hours or more with\r\nthe broken spores, so as to compose a medicinal powder, which is\r\nafterwards to be further diluted; or a tincture is made from the\r\nfractured spores, with spirit of ether, which will develop their\r\nspecific medicinal properties. The Club Moss, thus prepared,\r\nhas been experimentally taken by provers in varying material\r\ndoses; and is found through its toxical affinities in this way\r\nto be remarkably useful for chronic mucous indigestion and\r\nmal-nutrition, attended with sallow complexion, slow, difficult\r\ndigestion, flatulence, waterbrash, heartburn, decay of bodily\r\nstrength, and mental depression. It is said that whenever a fan-like\r\nmovement of the wings of the nostrils can be observed during the\r\nbreathing, the whole group of symptoms thus detailed is _specially_\r\ncurable by Club Moss.\r\n\r\nAs a dose of the triturated powder, reduced to a weaker\r\ndilution, ten grains may be taken twice a day [115] mixed with a\r\ndessertspoonful of water; or of the tincture largely reduced in\r\nstrength, ten drops twice a day in like manner. Chemically, the oil\r\nglobules extracted from the spores contain \"alumina\" and\r\n\"phosphoric acid.\" The diluted powder has proved practically\r\nbeneficial for reducing the swelling and for diminishing the\r\npulsation of aneurism when affecting a main blood-vessel of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the Club Moss is considered good against most\r\ndiseases of the eyes, provided it be gathered on the third day of the\r\nmoon when first seen; being shown the knife whilst the gatherer\r\nrepeats these words:--\r\n\r\n    \"As Christ healed the issue of blood,\r\n    Do thou cut what thou cut test for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then at sundown the Club Moss should be cut by the operator\r\nwhilst kneeling, and with carefully washed hands. It is to be\r\ntenderly wrapped in a fair white cloth, and afterwards boiled in\r\nwater procured from the spring nearest the spot where it grew,\"\r\nand the liquor is to be applied as a fomentation; or the Club Moss\r\nmay be \"made into an ointment with butter from the milk of a new\r\ncow.\" Such superstitious customs had without doubt a Druidic\r\norigin, and they identify the Club Moss with the Selago, or golden\r\nherb, \"Cloth of Gold\" of the Druids. This was reputed to confer the\r\npower of understanding the language of birds and beasts, and was\r\nintimately connected with some of their mysterious rites; though\r\nby others it is thought to have been a sort of Hedge Hyssop\r\n(_Gratiola_).\r\n\r\nThe Common Lycopodium bears in some, districts the name of\r\n\"Robin Hood's hatband.\" Its unmoistenable powder from the\r\nspores is a capital absorbing application to weeping, raw surfaces.\r\nAt the shops, this [116] powder of the Club Moss spores is sold as\r\n\"witch meal,\" or \"vegetable sulphur.\" For trade purposes it is\r\nobtained from the ears of a Wolfsfoot Moss, the Lycopodium\r\nclavatum, which grows in the forests of Russia and Finland. The\r\npowder is yellow of colour, dust-like and smooth to the touch.\r\nHalf a drachm of it given during July in any proper vehicle has\r\nbeen esteemed \"a noble remedy to cure stone in the bladder.\"\r\nBeing mixed with black pepper, it was recognized by the College\r\nof Physicians in 1721 as a medicine of singular value for\r\npreventing and curing hydrophobia. Dr. Mead, who had repeated\r\nexperience of its worth, declared that he never knew it to fail when\r\ncombined with cold bathing.\r\n\r\nClub Moss powder ignites with a flicker, and is used for stage\r\nlightning. It is the _Blitzmehl_, or lightning-meal of the Germans,\r\nwho give it in doses of from fifteen to twenty grains for the cure of\r\nepilepsy in children.\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Mortal Struggle\" was produced (see _Nicholas Nickleby_)\r\nby Mr. Vincent Crummles at Portsmouth, with the aid of Miss\r\nSnevelicci, and the Infant Phenomenon, lurid lightning was\r\nmuch in request to astonish the natives; and this was sufficiently\r\nwell simulated by igniting, with a sudden flash and a hiss,\r\nhighly inflammable spores of the Club Moss projected against\r\nburning tow within a hollow cone, producing weird scenic effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLTSFOOT.\r\n\r\nThe Coltsfoot, which grows abundantly throughout England in\r\nplaces of moist, heavy soil, especially along the sides of our raised\r\nrailway banks, has been justly termed \"nature's best herb for the\r\nlungs, and her most eminent thoracic.\" Its seeds are supposed to\r\nhave lain [117] dormant from primitive times, where our railway\r\ncuttings now upturn them and set them growing anew; and the\r\nrotting foliage of the primeval herb by retaining its juices, is\r\nthought to have promoted the development and growth of our\r\ncommon earthworm.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name of Coltsfoot is _Tussilago farfara_, signifying\r\n_tussis ago_, \"I drive away a cold\"; and _farfar_, the white poplar\r\ntree, which has a similar leaf. It is one of the Composite order, and\r\nthe older authors named this plant, _Filius ante patrem_--\"the son\r\nbefore the father,\" because the flowers appear and wither before\r\nthe leaves are produced. These flowers, at the very beginning of\r\nSpring, stud the banks with gay, golden, leafless blossoms, each\r\ngrowing on a stiff scaly stalk, and resembling a dandelion in\r\nminiature. The leaves, which follow later on, are made often into\r\ncigars, or are smoked as British herbal tobacco, being mixed for\r\nthis purpose with the dried leaves and flowers of the eye-bright,\r\nbuckbean, betony, thyme, and lavender, to which some persons\r\nadd rose leaves, and chamomile flowers. All these are rubbed\r\ntogether by the hands into a coarse powder, Coltsfoot forming\r\nquite one-half of the same; and this powder may be very\r\nbeneficially smoked for asthma, or for spasmodic bronchial cough.\r\nLinnoeus said, \"_Et adhuc hodie plebs in Suecia, instar tabaci\r\ncontra tussim fugit_\"--\"Even to-day the Swiss people cure their\r\ncoughs with Coltsfoot employed like tobacco.\" When the flowers\r\nare fully blown and fall off, the seeds with their \"clock\" form a\r\nbeautiful head of white flossy silk, and if this flies away when\r\nthere is no wind it is said to be a sure sign of coming rain. The\r\nGoldfinch often lines her nest with the soft pappus of the\r\nColtsfoot. In Paris the Coltsfoot flower is painted on the doorposts\r\nof an apothecary's house.\r\n\r\n[118] From earliest times, the plant has been found helpful in\r\nmaladies of the chest. Hippocrates advised it with honey for\r\n\"ulcerations of the lungs.\" Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen, severally\r\ncommended the use of its smoke, conducted into the mouth\r\nthrough a funnel or reed, for giving ease to cough and difficult\r\nbreathing; they named it _breechion_, from _breex_, a cough.\r\n\r\nIn taste, the leaves are harsh, bitter, and mucilaginous. They\r\nappear late in March, being green above, with an undersurface\r\nwhich is white, and cottony. Sussex peasants esteem the white\r\ndown of the leaves as a most valuable medicine.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant contain chemically tannin, with a special\r\nbitter principle, and free mucilage; so that the herb is to be\r\nconsidered emollient, demulcent, and tonic. Dr. Cullen employed a\r\ndecoction of the leaves with much benefit in scrofula, where the\r\nuse of sea water had failed. And Dr. Fuller tells about a girl cured\r\nof twelve scrofulous sores, by drinking daily, for four months, as\r\nmuch as she could of Coltsfoot tea, made so strong from the leaves\r\nas to be sweet and glutinous. A modern decoction is prepared from\r\nthe herb with boiling water poured on the leaves, and with\r\nliquorice root and honey added.\r\n\r\nBut, \"hark! I hear the pancake bell,\" said Poor Richard in his\r\nalmanack, 1684; alluding to pancakes then made with Coltsfoot,\r\nlike tansies, and fried with saged butter.\r\n\r\nA century later it was still the fashion to treat consumptive young\r\nwomen with quaint remedies. Mrs. Delaney writes in 1758, \"Does\r\nMary cough in the Night? two or three snails boiled in her barley\r\nwater may be of great service to her.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, the confectioner provides Coltsfoot rock, [119] concocted\r\nin fluted sticks of a brown colour, as a sweetmeat, and flavoured\r\nwith some essential oil--as aniseed, or dill--these sticks being well\r\nbeloved by most schoolboys. The dried leaves, when soaked out in\r\nwarm water, will serve as an excellent emollient poultice. A\r\ncertain preparation, called \"Essence of Coltsfoot,\" found great\r\nfavour with our grand sires for treating their colds. This consisted\r\nof Balsam of Tolu and Friar's Balsam in equal parts, together with\r\ndouble the quantity of Spirit of Wine. It did not really contain\r\na trace of Coltsfoot, and the nostrum was provocative of\r\ninflammation, because of the spirit in excess. Dr. Paris said: \"And\r\nthis, forsooth, is a pectoral for coughs! If a patient with a catarrh\r\nshould recover whilst using such a remedy, I should certainly\r\ndesignate it a lucky escape, rather than a skilful cure.\" Gerard\r\nwrote about Coltsfoot: \"The fume of the dried leaves, burned upon\r\ncoles, effectually helpeth those that fetch their winde thicke, and\r\nbreaketh without peril the impostumes of the brest\"; also \"the\r\ngreen leaves do heal the hot inflammation called Saint Anthony's\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the herb--Coltsfoot, and Horsehoof--are derived\r\nfrom the shape of the leaf. It is likewise known as Asses' foot, and\r\nCough wort; also as Foal's foot, and Bull's foot, Hoofs, and (in\r\nYorkshire) Cleats.\r\n\r\nTo make an infusion or decoction of the plant for a confirmed\r\ncough, or for chronic bronchitis, pour a pint of boiling water on an\r\nounce of the dried leaves and flowers, and take half a teacupful of\r\nit when cold three or four times in the day. The silky down of the\r\nseed-heads is used in the Highlands for stuffing pillows, and the\r\npresence of coal is said to be indicated by an abundant growth of\r\nthe herb.\r\n\r\nAnother species, the Butter bur (_Tussilago petasites_), [120] is\r\nnamed from _petasus_, an umbrella, or a broad covering for the\r\nhead. It produces the largest leaves of any plant in Great Britain,\r\nwhich sometimes measure three feet in breadth. This plant was\r\nthought to be of great use in the time of the plague, and thus got\r\nthe names of Pestilent wort, Plague flower and Bog Rhubarb. Both\r\nit, and the Coltsfoot, are specific remedies (H.) for severe and\r\nobstinate neuralgia in the small of the back, and the loins, a\r\nmedicinal tincture being prepared from each herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMFREY.\r\n\r\nThe Comfrey of our river banks, and moist watery places, is the\r\n_Consound_, or Knit-back, or Bone-set, and Blackwort of country\r\nfolk; and the old _Symphytum_ of Dioscorides. It has derived\r\nthese names from the consolidating and vulnerary qualities\r\nattributed to the plant, from _confirmo_, to strengthen together, or\r\nthe French, _comfrie_. This herb is of the Borage tribe, and is\r\nconspicuous by its height of from one to two feet, its large rough\r\nleaves, which provoke itching when handled, and its drooping\r\nwhite or purple flowers growing on short stalks. Chemically, the\r\nmost important part of the plant is its \"mucilage.\" This contains\r\ntannin, asparagin, sugar, and starch granules. The roots are sweet,\r\nsticky, and without any odour. \"_Quia tanta proestantia est_,\" says\r\nPliny, \"_ut si carnes duroe coquuntur conglutinet addita; unde\r\nnomen!_\"--\"and the roots be so glutinative that they will solder or\r\nglew together meat that is chopt in pieces, seething in a pot, and\r\nmake it into one lump: the same bruysed, and lay'd in the manner\r\nof a plaister, doth heale all fresh and green wounds.\" These roots\r\nare very brittle, and the least bit of them will start growing afresh.\r\n\r\n[121] The whole plant, beaten to a cataplasm, and applied hot as a\r\npoultice, has always been deemed excellent for soothing pain in\r\nany tender, inflamed or suppurating part. It was formerly applied\r\nto raw indolent ulcers as a glutinous astringent, and most useful\r\nvulnerary. Pauli recommended it for broken bones, and externally\r\nfor wounds of the nerves, tendons, and arteries. More recently\r\nsurgeons have declared that the powdered root (which, when\r\nbroken, is white within, and full of a slimy juice), if dissolved in\r\nwater to a mucilage, is far from contemptible for bleedings,\r\nfractures, and luxations, whilst it hastens the callus of bones under\r\nrepair. Its strong decoction has been found very useful in Germany\r\nfor tanning leather. The leaves were formerly employed for giving\r\na flavour to cakes and panada.\r\n\r\nA modern medicinal tincture (H.) is made from the root-stock with\r\nspirit of wine; and ten drops of this should be taken three or four\r\ntimes a day with a tablespoonful of cold water. French nurses treat\r\ncracked nipples by applying a hollow section of the fresh root over\r\nthe sore caruncle; and a decoction of the root made by boiling\r\nfrom two to four drachms in a pint of water, is given for bleedings\r\nfrom the lungs or bladder.\r\n\r\nThe name _Consound_, owned by the Common Comfrey, was given\r\nlikewise to the daisy and the bugle, in the middle ages. \"It\r\njoyeth,\" says Gerard, \"in watery ditches, in fat and fruitful\r\nmeadows.\" A solve concocted from the fresh herb will certainly\r\ntend to promote the healing of bruised and broken parts,\r\nsuggesting as an appropriate motto for the salve box: \"Behold how\r\ngood and pleasant a thing it is to dwell together in unity! It is\r\nlike the precious ointment which ran down Aaron's beard.\" Some\r\nforeknowledge [122] of the Comfrey perhaps inspired the Prophet\r\nIsaiah to predict that after a time \"the heart should rejoice and the\r\nbones flourish like a herb.\" The Poet Laureate tells of\r\n\r\n            \"This, the Consound,\r\n    Whereby the lungs are eased of their grief.\"\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago, the _Prickly Comfrey_--a variety of our\r\nConsound--was naturalised in this country from the Caucasus, and\r\nhas since proved itself amazingly productive to farmers, as, when\r\ncultivated, it will grow six crops in the year; and the plant is both\r\npreventive and curative of foot and mouth disease in cattle. It\r\nbears flowers of a rich blue colour.\r\n\r\nFrom our Common Comfrey a sort of glue is got in Angora, which\r\nis used for spinning the famous fleeces of that country. Mr.\r\nCockayne relates that the locksman at Teddington informed him\r\nhow the bone of his little finger being broken, was grinding and\r\ngrunching so sadly for two months, that sometimes he felt quite\r\nwrong in his head. One day he saw a doctor go by, and told him\r\nabout the distress. The doctor said: \"You see that Comfrey\r\ngrowing there? Take a piece of its root, and champ it, and put it\r\nabout your finger, and wrap it up.\" The man did so, and in four\r\ndays his finger was well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORIANDER.\r\n\r\nCoriander comfits, sold by the confectioner as admirably warming\r\nto the stomach, and corrective of flatulence, consist of small\r\naromatic seeds coated with white sugar. These are produced by the\r\nCoriander, an umbelliferous herb cultivated in England from early\r\ntimes for medicinal and culinary uses, though introduced at first\r\nfrom the Mediterranean. It has now [123] become wild as an\r\nescape, growing freely in our fields and waste places. Farmers\r\nproduce it, especially about Essex, under the name of Col, the\r\ncrops being mown down when ripe, and the fruits being then\r\nthrashed out to procure the seeds. The generic name has been\r\nderived from _koros_, a bug; alluding to the stinking odour of the\r\nbruised leaves, though these, when dried, are fragrant, and\r\npleasant of smell. In some countries, as Egypt and Peru, they are\r\ntaken in soups. The seeds are cordial, but become narcotic if used\r\ntoo freely. When distilled with water they yield a yellow essential\r\noil of a very aromatic and strong odour.\r\n\r\nCoriander water was formerly much esteemed as a carminative for\r\nwindy colic. Being so aromatic and comfortably stimulating, the\r\nfruit is commended for aiding the digestion of savoury pastry, and\r\nto correct the griping tendencies of such medicines as senna and\r\nrhubarb. It contains malic acid, tannin, the special volatile oil of\r\nthe herb, and some fatty matter.\r\n\r\nDistillers of gin make use of this fruit, and veterinary surgeons\r\nemploy it as a drug for cattle and horses. Alston says, \"The green\r\nherb--seeds and all--stinks intolerably of bugs\"; and Hoffman\r\nadmonishes, \"_Si largius sumptura fuerit semen non sine periculo\r\ne sua sede et statu demovet, et qui sumpsere varia dictu pudenda\r\nblaterant_.\" The fruits are blended with curry powder, and are\r\nchosen to flavour several liquors. By the Chinese a power of\r\nconferring immortality is thought to be possessed by the seeds.\r\nFrom a passage in the Book of Numbers where manna is likened\r\nto Coriander seed, it would seem that this seed was familiar to the\r\nIsraelites and used by them for domestic purposes. Robert Turner\r\nsays when taken in wine it stimulates the animal passions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[124] COWSLIP.\r\n\r\nOur English pastures and meadows, especially where the soil is of\r\nblue lias clay, become brilliantly gay, \"with gaudy cowslips drest,\"\r\nquite early in the spring. But it is a mistake to suppose that these\r\nflowers are a favourite food with cows, who, in fact, never eat\r\nthem if they can help it. The name Cowslip is really derived, says\r\nDr. Prior, from the Flemish words, _kous loppe_, meaning \"hose\r\nflap,\" a humble part of woollen nether garments. But Skeat thinks\r\nit arose from the fact that the plant was supposed to spring up\r\nwhere a patch of cow dung had fallen.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the Mullein--which has large, oval, woolly leaves--\r\nand the Cowslip were included under one common Latin name,\r\n_Verbascum_; for which reason the attributes of the Mullein still\r\nremain accredited by mistake to the second plant. Former medical\r\nwriters called the Cowslip _herba paralysis_, or, \"palsywort,\"\r\nbecause of its supposed efficacy in relieving paralysis. The whole\r\nplant is known to be gently narcotic and somniferous. Pope\r\npraised the herb and its flowers on account of their sedative\r\nqualities:--\r\n\r\n            \"For want of rest,\r\n    Lettuce and Cowslip wine--_Probatum est_.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst Coleridge makes his _Christabel_ declare with reference to\r\nthe fragrant brew concocted from its petals, with lemons and\r\nsugar:--\r\n\r\n    \"It is a wine of virtuous powers,\r\n    My mother made it of wild flowers.\"\r\n\r\nPhysicians for the last two centuries have used the powdered roots\r\nof the Cowslip (and the Primrose) for wakefulness, hysterical\r\nattacks, and muscular rheumatism; and the cowslip root was\r\nnamed of old both [124] _radix paralyseos_, and _radix arthritica_.\r\nThis root, and the flowers, have an odour of anise, which\r\nis due to their containing some volatile oil identical with\r\nmannite. Their more acrid principle is \"saponin.\" Hill tells us that\r\nwhen boiled in ale, the roots are taken by country persons for\r\ngiddiness, with no little success. \"They be likewise in great request\r\namong those that use to hunt after goats and roebucks on high\r\nmountains, for the strengthening of the head when they pass by\r\nfearful precipices and steep places, in following their game, so that\r\ngiddiness and swimming of the brain may not seize upon them.\"\r\nThe dose of the dried and powdered flowers is from fifteen to\r\ntwenty grains. A syrup of a fine yellow colour may also be made\r\nfrom the petals, which answers the same purposes. Three pounds\r\nof the fresh blossoms should be infused in five pints of boiling\r\nwater, and then simmered down to a proper consistence with\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\nHerbals of the Elizabethan date, say that an ointment made from\r\ncowslip flowers \"taketh away the spots and wrinkles of the skin,\r\nand doth add beauty exceedingly, as divers ladies, gentlewomen,\r\nand she citizens--whether wives or widows--know well enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe tiny people were then supposed to be fond of nestling in the\r\ndrooping bells of Cowslips, and hence the flowers were called\r\nfairy cups; and, in accordance with the doctrine of signatures, they\r\nwere thought effective for removing freckles from the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"In their gold coats spots you see,\r\n    These be rubies: fairy favours.\r\n    In these freckles live their savours.\"\r\n\r\nThe cluster of blossoms on a single stalk sometimes bears the\r\nname of \"lady's keys\" or \"St. Peter's wort,\" either because it\r\nresembles a bunch of keys as St. [126] Peter's badge, or because as\r\n_primula veris_ it unlocks the treasures of spring.\r\n\r\nCowslip flowers are frequently done up by playful children into\r\nballs, which they call tisty tosty, or simply a tosty. For this\r\npurpose the umbels of blossoms fully blown are strung closely\r\ntogether, and tied into a firm ball.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were at one time eaten in salad, and mixed with other\r\nherbs to stuff meat, whilst the flowers were made into a delicate\r\nconserve.\r\n\r\nYorkshire people call this plant the Cowstripling; and in\r\nDevonshire, where it is scarcely to be found, because of the red\r\nmarl, it has come about that the foxglove goes by the name of\r\nCowslip. Again, in some provincial districts, the Cowslip is known\r\nas Petty Mullein, and in others as Paigle (Palsywort). The old\r\nEnglish proverb, \"As blake as a paigle,\" means, \"As yellow as a\r\ncowslip.\"\r\n\r\nOne word may be said here in medicinal favour of the poor cow, whose\r\nassociation with the flower now under discussion has been so\r\nunceremoniously disproved. The breath and smell of this sweet-odoured\r\nanimal are thought in Flintshire to be good against consumption.\r\nHenderson tells of a blacksmith's apprentice who was restored\r\nto health when far advanced in a decline, by taking the milk\r\nof cows fed in a kirkyard. In the south of Hampshire, a useful\r\nplaster of fresh cow-dung is applied to open wounds. And\r\neven in its evolutionary development, the homely animal reads us\r\na lesson; for _Dat Deus immiti cornua curta bovi_, says the Latin\r\nproverb--\"Savage cattle have only short horns.\" So was it in \"the\r\nHouse that Jack built,\" where the fretful creature that tossed the\r\ndog had but one horn, and this grew crumpled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[127] CRESSES.\r\n\r\nThe Cress of the herbalist is a noun of multitude: it comprises\r\nseveral sorts, differing in kind but possessing the common\r\nproperties of wholesomeness and pungency. Here \"order in variety\r\nwe see\"; and here, \"though all things differ, all agree.\" The name\r\nis thought by some to be derived from the Latin verb _crescere_,\r\nto grow fast.\r\n\r\nEach kind of Cress belongs to the Cruciferous genus of plants;\r\nwhence comes, perhaps, the common name The several varieties\r\nof Cress are stimulating and anti-scorbutic, whilst each contains a\r\nparticular essential principle, of acrid flavour, and of sharp biting\r\nqualities. The whole tribe is termed _lepidium_, or \"siliquose,\"\r\nscaly, with reference to the shape of the seed-pouches. It includes\r\n\"Land Cress (formerly dedicated to St. Barbara); Broad-leaved\r\nCress (or the Poor-man's pepper); Penny Cress (_thlapsus_);\r\nGarden, or Town Cress; and the well known edible Water Cress.\"\r\nFormerly the Greeks attached much value to the whole order of\r\nCresses, which they thought very beneficial to the brain. A\r\nfavourite maxim with them was, \"Eat Cresses, and get wit.\"\r\n\r\nIn England these plants have long been cultivated as a source of\r\nprofit; whence arose the saying that a graceless fellow is not worth\r\na \"kurse\" or cress--in German, _kers_. Thus Chaucer speaks about\r\na character in the _Canterbury Tales_, \"Of paramours ne fraught\r\nhe not a kers.\" But some writers have referred this saying rather to\r\nthe wild cherry or kerse, making it of the same significance as our\r\ncommon phrase, \"Not worth a fig.\"\r\n\r\nAs Curative Herbal Simples we need only consider the Garden or\r\nTown Cress, and the Water Cress: whilst regarding the other\r\nvarieties rather as condiments, and [128] salad herbs to be taken\r\nby way of pleasant wholesome appetisers at table. These\r\naromatic herbs were employed to season the homely dishes of our\r\nforefathers, before commerce had brought the spices of the East at\r\na cheap rate to our doors; and Cresses were held in common\r\nfavour by peasants for such a purpose. The black, or white pepper\r\nof to-day, was then so costly that \"to promise a saint yearly a\r\npound of it was considered a liberal bequest.\" And therefore the\r\nleaves of wild Cresses were eaten as a substitute for giving\r\npungency to the food. Remarkable among these was the _Dittander\r\nSativus_, a species found chiefly near the sea, with foliage\r\nso hot and acrid, that the plant then went by the name of\r\n\"Poor-man's Pepper,\" or \"Pepper Wort.\" Pliny said, \"It is of the\r\nnumber of scorching and blistering Simples.\" \"This herbe,\" says\r\nLyte, \"is fondly and unlearnedly called in English Dittany. It were\r\nbetter in following the Dutchmen to name it Pepperwort.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Garden Cress_, called _Sativum_ (from _satum_, a pasture),\r\nis the sort commonly coupled with the herb Mustard in our\r\nfamiliar \"Mustard and Cress.\" It has been grown in England since\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, and its other name _Town_\r\nCress refers to its cultivation in \"tounes,\" or enclosures. It was\r\nalso known as Passerage; from _passer_, to drive away--rage, or\r\nmadness, because of its reputed power to expel hydrophobia. \"This\r\nGarden Cress,\" said Wm. Coles in his _Paradise of Plants_, 1650,\r\n\"being green, and therefore more qualified by reason of its\r\nhumidity, is eaten by country people, either alone with butter, or\r\nwith lettice and purslane, in Sallets, or otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nIt contains sulphur, and a special ardent volatile medicinal oil. The\r\nsmall leaves combined with those of [129] our white garden\r\nMustard are excellent against rheumatism and gout. Likewise it is\r\na preventive of scurvy by reason of its mineral salts. In which\r\nsalutary respects the twin plants, Mustard and Cress, are happily\r\nconsorted, and well play a capital common part, like the \"two\r\nsingle gentlemen rolled into one\" of George Colman, the younger.\r\n\r\nThe _Water Cress_ (_Nasturtium officinale_) is among cresses, to\r\nuse an American simile, the \"finest toad in the puddle.\" This is\r\nbecause of its superlative medicinal worth, and its great popularity\r\nat table. Early writers called the herb \"Shamrock,\" and common\r\nfolk now-a-days term it the \"Stertion.\" Zenophon advised the\r\nPersians to feed their children on Water-cresses (_kardamon\r\nesthie_) that they might grow in stature and have active minds.\r\n\r\nThe Latin name _Nasturtium_ was given to the Watercress because\r\nof its volatile pungency when bruised and smelt; from _nasus_,\r\na nose, and _tortus_, turned away, it being so to say, \"a herb\r\nthat wriths or twists the nose.\" For the same reason it is called\r\n_Nasitord_ in France. When bruised its leaves affect the eyes and\r\nnose almost like mustard. They have been usefully applied to the\r\nscald head and tetters of children. In New Zealand the stems grow\r\nas thick as a man's wrist, and nearly choke some of the rivers. Like\r\nan oyster, the Water-cress is in proper season only when there is\r\nan \"r\" in the month.\r\n\r\nAccording to an analysis made recently in the School of Pharmacy\r\nat Paris, the Water-cress contains a sulpho-nitrogenous oil, iodine,\r\niron, phosphates, potash, certain other earthy salts, a bitter extract,\r\nand water. Its volatile oil which is rich in nitrogen and sulphur\r\n(problematical) is the sulpho-cyanide of allyl. Anyhow [130] there\r\nis much sulphur possessed by the whole plant in one form or\r\nanother, together with a considerable quantity of mineral matter.\r\nThus the popular plant is so constituted as to be particularly\r\ncurative of scrofulous affections, especially in the spring time,\r\nwhen the bodily humours are on the ferment. Dr. King Chambers\r\nwrites (_Diet in Health and Disease_), \"I feel sure that the\r\ninfertility, pallor, fetid breath, and bad teeth which characterise\r\nsome of our town populations are to a great extent due to their\r\ninability to get fresh anti-scorbutic vegetables as articles of diet:\r\ntherefore I regard the Water-cress seller as one of the saviours of\r\nher country.\" Culpeper said pithily long ago: \"They that will live\r\nin health may eat Water-cress if they please; and if they won't, I\r\ncannot help it.\"\r\n\r\nThe scrofula to which the Water-cress and its allied plants are\r\nantidotal, got its name from _scrofa_, \"a burrowing pig,\"\r\nsignifying the radical destruction of important glands in the body\r\nby this undermining constitutional disease. Possibly the quaint\r\nlines which nurses have long been given to repeat for the\r\namusement of babies while fondling their infantine fingers bear a\r\nhidden meaning which pointedly imports the scrofulous taint. This\r\nnursery distich, as we remember, personates the fingers one by one\r\nas five little fabulous pigs:--the first small piggy doesn't feel well;\r\nand the second one threatens the doctor to tell; the third little pig\r\nhas to linger at home; and the fourth small porker of meat has\r\nnone; then the fifth little pig, with a querulous note, cries \"weak,\r\nweak, weak\" from its poor little throat.\r\n\r\n    \"oegrotat multis doloribus porculus ille:\r\n    Ille rogat fratri medicum proferre salutem:\r\n    Debilis ille domi mansit vetitus abire;\r\n    Carnem digessit nunquam miser porculus ille;\r\n    'Eheu!' ter repetens, 'eheu!' perporculus, 'eheu!'\r\n    Vires exiguas luget plorante susurro.\"\r\n\r\n[131] On account of its medicinal constituents the herb has\r\nbeen deservedly extolled as a specific remedy for tubercular\r\nconsumption of the lungs. Haller says: \"We have seen patients in\r\ndeep declines cured by living almost entirely on this plant;\" and it\r\nforms the chief ingredient of the _Sirop Antiscorbutique _given so\r\nsuccessfully by the French faculty in scrofula and other allied\r\ndiseases. Its active principles are at their best when the plant is in\r\nflower; and the amount of essential oil increases according to the\r\nquantity of sunlight which the leaves obtain, the proportion of iron\r\nbeing determined according to the quality of the water, and the\r\nmeasure of phosphates by the supply of dressing afforded. The\r\nleaves remain green when grown in the shade, but become of a\r\npurple brown because of their iron when exposed to the sun. The\r\nexpressed juice, which contains the peculiar taste and pungency of\r\nthe herb, may be taken in doses of from one to two fluid ounces at\r\neach of the three principal meals, and it should always be had\r\nfresh. When combined with the juice of Scurvy grass and of\r\nSeville oranges it makes the popular antiscorbutic medicine known\r\nas \"Spring juices.\"\r\n\r\nA Water-cress cataplasm applied cold in a single layer, and with a\r\npinch of salt sprinkled thereupon makes a most useful poultice to\r\nheal foul scrofulous ulcers; and will also help to resolve glandular\r\nswellings.\r\n\r\nWater-cresses squeezed and laid against warts were said by the\r\nSaxon leeches to work a certain cure on these excrescences. In\r\nFrance the Water-cress is dipped in oil and vinegar to be eaten at\r\ntable with chicken or a steak. The Englishman takes it at his\r\nmorning or evening meal, with bread and butter, or at dinner in a\r\nsalad. It loses some of its pungent flavour and of its curative\r\nqualities [132] when cultivated; and therefore it is more appetising\r\nand useful when freshly gathered from natural streams. But these\r\nstreams ought to be free from contamination by sewage matter, or\r\nany drainage which might convey the germs of fever, or other\r\nblood poison: for, as we are admonished, the Water-cress plant\r\nacts as a brush in impure running brooks to detain around its stalks\r\nand leaves any dirty disease-bringing flocculi.\r\n\r\nSome of our leading druggists now make for medicinal use a\r\nliquid extract of the _Nasturtium officinale_, and a spirituous juice\r\n(or _succus_) of the plant. These preparations are of marked\r\nservice in scorbutic cases, where weakness exists without wasting,\r\nand often with spongy gums, or some skin eruption. They are best\r\nwhen taken with lemon juice.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the unwholesome Water parsnep, or Fool's Cress,\r\nresembles that of the Water-cress, and grows near it not infrequently:\r\nbut the leaves of the true Water-cress never embrace the stem\r\nof the plant as do the leaf stalks of its injurious imitators.\r\nHerrick the joyous poet of \"dull Devonshire\" dearly loved the\r\nWater-cress, and its kindred herbs. He piously and pleasantly\r\nmade them the subject of a quaint grace before meat:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lord, I confess too when I dine\r\n        The pulse is Thine:\r\n    And all those other bits that be\r\n        There placed by Thee:\r\n    The wurts, the perslane, and the mess\r\n        of Water-cress.\"\r\n\r\nThe true _Nasturtium_ (_Tropoeolum majus_), or greater Indian\r\nCress grows and is cultivated in our flower gardens as a brilliant\r\nornamental creeper. It was brought from Peru to France in 1684, and\r\nwas called _La grande Capucine_, whilst the botanical title\r\n_tropoeolum_, [133] a trophy, was conferred because of its\r\nshield-like leaves, and its flowers resembling a golden helmet.\r\nAn old English name for the same plant was Yellow Lark's heels.\r\n\r\nTwo years later it was introduced into England. This partakes of\r\nthe sensible and useful qualities of the other cresses. The fresh\r\nplant and the dark yellow flowers have an odour like that of the\r\nWater-cress, and its bruised leaves emit a pungent smell. An\r\ninfusion made with water will bring out the antiscorbutic virtues of\r\nthe plant which are specially aromatic, and cordial. The flowers\r\nmake a pretty and palatable addition to salads, and the nuts or\r\ncapsules (which resemble the \"cheeses\" of Mallow) are esteemed\r\nas a pickle, or as a substitute for Capers. Invalids have often\r\npreferred this plant to the Scurvy grass as an antiscorbutic remedy.\r\nIn the warm summer months the flowers have been observed about\r\nthe time of sunset to give out sparks, as of an electrical kind,\r\nwhich were first noticed by a daughter of Linnoeus.\r\n\r\nThe _Water-cress_ is justly popular with persons who drink freely\r\novernight, for its power of dissipating the fumes of the liquor, and\r\nof clearing away lethargic inaptitude for work in the morning: also\r\nfor dispelling the tremors, and the foul taste induced by excessive\r\ntobacco smoking.\r\n\r\nClosely allied thereto is another cruciferous plant, the Scurvy\r\ngrass (_Cochleare_), named also \"Spoon-wort\" from its leaves\r\nresembling in shape the bowl of an old-fashioned spoon. This is\r\nthought to be the famous _Herba Britannica_ of the ancients. Our\r\ngreat navigators have borne testimony to its never failing use in\r\nscurvy, and, though often growing many miles from the sea, yet\r\nthe taste of the herb is always [134] found to be salt. If eaten in\r\nits fresh state, as a salad, it is the most effectual of all the\r\nantiscorbutic plants, the leaves being admirable also to cure\r\nswollen and spongy gums. It grows along the muddy banks of the\r\nAvon, likewise in Wales, and is found in Cumberland, more\r\ncommonly near the coast; and again on the mountains of Scotland.\r\nIt may be readily cultivated in the garden for medicinal use.\r\n\r\nThe Cuckoo flower, or \"Ladies' Smock\" (Cardamine) from _Cardia\r\ndamao_, \"I strengthen the heart,\" is another wholesome Cress\r\nwith the same sensible properties as the Water-cress, only in\r\nan inferior degree, while the strong pungency of its flavour\r\nprevents it from being equally popular. This plant bears also the\r\nnames of \"Lucy Locket,\" and \"Smell Smocks.\" In Cornwall the\r\nflowering tops have been employed for the cure of epilepsy\r\nthroughout several generations with singular success; though the\r\nuse of the leaves only for this purpose has caused disappointment.\r\nFrom one to three drams of these flowering tops are to be taken\r\ntwo or three times a day.\r\n\r\nBy the Rev. Mr. Gregor (1793) and by his descendants this\r\nremedy was given for inveterate epilepsy with much benefit.\r\nLady Holt, and her sister Lady Bracebridge, of Aston Hall,\r\nWarwickshire, were long famous for curing severe cases of the\r\nsame infirmity by administering this herb. They gave the\r\npowdered heads of the flowers when in full bloom-twelve grains\r\nthree times a day for many weeks together.\r\n\r\nSir George Baker in 1767 read a paper before the London College\r\nof Physicians on the value of these flowers in convulsive\r\ndisorders. He related five cures of St. Vitus' dance, spasmodic\r\nconvulsions, and spasmodic asthma. Formerly the flowers were\r\nadmitted into the [135] London Pharmacopoeia. The herb was\r\nnamed Ladies' Smock in honour of the Virgin Mary, because it\r\ncomes first into flower about Lady Day, being abundant with its\r\ndelicate lilac blossoms in our moist meadows and marshes:\r\n\r\n    \"Lady Smocks all silver white\r\n    Do paint the meadows with delight.\"\r\n\r\nThis plant is also named--\"Milk Maids,\" \"Bread and Milk,\" and\r\n\"Mayflower.\" Gerard says \"it flowers in April and May when\r\nthe Cuckoo cloth begin to sing her pleasant notes without\r\nstammering.\" One of his characters is made by the Poet Laureate\r\nto--\r\n\r\n    \"Steep for Danewulf leaves of Lady Smock,\r\n    For they keep strong the heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so much,\" as says William Cole, herbalist, in his _Paradise\r\nof Plants_, 1650, \"for such Plants as cure the Scurvy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCUMIN.\r\n\r\nCumin (_Cuminum cyminum_) is not half sufficiently known, or\r\nesteemed as a domestic condiment of medicinal value, and\r\nculinary uses; whilst withal of ready access as one of our\r\ncommonest importations from Malta and Sicily for flavouring\r\npurposes, and veterinary preparations. It is an umbelliferous plant,\r\nand large quantities of its seeds are brought every year to England.\r\nThe herb has been cultivated in the East from early days, being\r\ncalled \"Cuminum\" by the Greeks in classic times. The seeds\r\npossess a strong aromatic odour with a penetrating and bitter taste;\r\nwhen distilled they yield a pungent powerful essential oil. The\r\nolder herbalists esteemed them superior in comforting carminative\r\n[136] qualities to those of the fennel or caraway. They are\r\neminently useful to correct the flatulence of languid digestion,\r\nserving also to relieve dyspeptic headache, to allay colic of the\r\nbowels, and to promote the monthly flow of women.\r\n\r\nIn Holland and Switzerland they are employed for flavouring\r\ncheese; whilst in Germany they are added to bread as a condiment.\r\n\r\nHere the seeds are introduced in the making of curry powder, and\r\nare compounded to form a stimulating liniment; likewise a\r\nwarming plaster for quickening the sluggish congestions of\r\nindolent parts. The odorous volatile oil of the fruit contains the\r\nhydro-carbons \"Cymol,\" and \"Cuminol,\" which are redolent of\r\nlemon and caraway odours. A dose of the seeds is from fifteen to\r\nthirty grains. Cumin symbolised cupidity among the Greeks:\r\nwherefore Marcus Antoninus was so nick-named because of his\r\navarice; and misers were jocularly said to have eaten Cumin.\r\n\r\nThe herb was thought to specially confer the gift of retention,\r\npreventing the theft of any object which contained it, and holding\r\nthe thief in custody within the invaded house; also keeping fowls\r\nand pigeons from straying, and lovers from proving fickle. If a\r\nswain was going off as a soldier, or to work a long way from his\r\nhome, his sweetheart would give him a loaf seasoned with Cumin,\r\nor a cup of wine in which some of the herb had been mixed.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with the power of Cumin to cause\r\nthe human countenance to become pallid; and as a medicine the\r\nherb is well calculated to cure such pallor of the face when\r\noccurring as an illness. Partridges and pigeons [137] are extremely\r\nfond of the seeds: respecting the scriptural use of which in the\r\npayment of taxes we are reminded (Luke xi. v. 42)--\"ye pay tithe\r\nof mint, and anise, and cummin.\" It has been discovered by Grisar\r\nthat Cumin oil exercises a special action which gives it importance\r\nas a medicine. This is to signally depress nervous reflex\r\nexcitability when administered in full doses, as of from two to\r\neight drops of the oil on sugar. And when the aim is to stimulate\r\nsuch reflex sensibility as impaired by disease, small diluted doses\r\nof the oil serve admirably to promote this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURRANTS.\r\n\r\nThe original Currants in times past were small grapes, grown in\r\nGreece at Zante, near Corinth, and termed Corinthians; then they\r\nbecame Corantes, and eventually Currants. But, as an old Roman\r\nproverb pertinently said: _Non cuivis homini contingit adire\r\nCorinthum_, \"It was not for everyone to visit fashionable\r\nCorinth.\" And therefore the name of Currants became transferred\r\nin the Epirus to certain small fruit of the Gooseberry order which\r\nclosely resembled the grapes of Zante, but were identical rather\r\nwith the Currants of our modern kitchen gardens, such as we now\r\nuse for making puddings, pies, jams, and jellies. The bushes which\r\nproduce this fruit grow wild in the Northern part, of Great Britain,\r\nand belong to the Saxifrage order of plants. The wild Red Currant\r\nbears small berries which are intensely acid. In modern Italy\r\nbasketsful are gathered in the woods of the Apennines, and the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\nCurrants are not mentioned in former Greek or Roman literature,\r\nnor do they seem to have been cultivated by the Anglo-Saxons, or\r\nthe Normans. Our several sorts [138] of Currants afford a striking\r\nillustration of the mode which their parent bushes have learnt to\r\nadopt so as to attract by their highly coloured fruits the birds\r\nwhich shall disperse their seeds. These colours are not developed\r\nuntil the seed is ripe for germination; because if birds devoured\r\nthem prematurely the seed would fall inert. But simultaneously\r\ncome the ripeness and the soft sweet pulp, and the rich colouring,\r\nso that the birds may be attracted to eat the fruit, and spread the\r\nseed in their droppings. Zeuxis, a famous Sicilian painter four\r\nhundred years before Christ, depicted currants and grapes with\r\nsuch fidelity that birds came and tried to peck them out from his\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\nWhite Currants are the most simple in kind; and the Red are a step\r\nin advance. If equal parts of either fruit and of sugar are put over\r\nthe fire, the liquid which separates spontaneously will make a very\r\nagreeable jelly because of the \"pectin\" with which it is chemically\r\nfurnished. Nitric acid will convert this pectin into oxalic acid, or\r\nsalts of sorrel. The juice of Red Currants also contains malic and\r\ncitric acids, which are cooling and wholesome. In the Northern\r\ncounties this red Currant is called Wineberry, or Garnetberry, from\r\nits rich ruddy colour, and transparency. Its sweetened juice is a\r\nfavourable drink in Paris, being preferred there to the syrup of\r\n_orgeat _(almonds). When made into a jelly with sugar the juice of\r\nred Currants is excellent in fevers, and acts as an anti-putrescent;\r\nas likewise if taken at table with venison, or hare, or other \"high\"\r\nmeats. This fruit especially suits persons of sanguine temperament.\r\nBoth red and white Currants are without doubt trustworthy\r\nremedies in most forms of obstinate visceral obstruction, and they\r\ncorrect impurities of the blood, being certainly antiseptic.\r\n\r\n[139] The black Currant is found growing wild in England, for the\r\nmost part by the edges of brooks, and in moist grounds, from\r\nmid-Scotland southwards. Throughout Sussex and Kent the shrub is\r\ncalled \"Gazles\" as corrupted from the French _Groseilles_\r\n(Gooseberries). The fruit is cooling, laxative, and anodyne. Its\r\nthickened juice concocted over the fire, with, or without sugar,\r\nformed a \"rob\" of Old English times. The black Currant is often\r\nnamed by our peasantry \"Squinancy,\" or \"Quinsyberry,\" because a\r\njelly prepared therefrom has been long employed for sore throat\r\nand quinsy. The leaf glands of its young leaves secrete from their\r\nunder surface a fragrant odorous fluid. Therefore if newly\r\ngathered, and infused for a moment in very hot water and then\r\ndried, the leaves make an excellent substitute for tea; also these\r\nfresh leaves when applied to a gouty part will assuage pain, and\r\ninflammation. They are used to impart the flavour of brandy to\r\ncommon spirit. Bergius called the leaf, _mundans, pellens, et\r\ndiuretica_. Botanically the black Currant, _Ribes nigrum_, belongs\r\nto the Saxifrage tribe, this generic term Ribes being applied to all\r\nfresh currants, as of Arabian origin, and signifying acidity.\r\nGrocers' currants come from the Morea, being small grapes dried\r\nin the sun, and put in heaps to cake together. Then they are dug out\r\nwith a crow-bar, and trodden into casks for exportation. Our\r\nnational plum pudding can no more be made without these currants\r\nthan \"little Tom Tucker who for his supper, could cut his\r\nbread without any knife or could find himself married without any\r\nwife.\" Former cooks made an odd use of grocers' currants,\r\naccording to King, a poet of the middle ages, who says:--\r\n\r\n    \"They buttered currants on fat veal bestowed,\r\n    And rumps of beef with virgin honey strewed.\"\r\n\r\n[140] On the kitchen Currant a riddling rhyme was long ago to be\r\nfound in the _Children's Book of Conundrums_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Higgledy-piggledy, here I lie\r\n    Picked and plucked, and put in a pie;\r\n    My first is snapping, snarling, growling;\r\n    My second noisy, ramping, prowling.\"\r\n\r\nEccles cakes are delicious Currant sandwiches which are very\r\npopular in Manchester.\r\n\r\nBlack Currant jelly should not be made with too much sugar, else\r\nits medicinal-virtues will be impaired. A teaspoonful of this jelly\r\nmay be given three or four times in the day to a child with thrush.\r\nIn Russia the leaves of the black Currant are employed to fabricate\r\nbrandy made with a coarse spirit. These leaves and the fruit are\r\noften combined by our herbalists with the seeds of the wild carrot\r\nfor stimulating the kidneys in passive dropsy. A medicinal wine is\r\nalso brewed from the fruit together with honey. In this country we\r\nuse a decoction of the leaf, or of the bark as a gargle. In Siberia\r\nblack Currants grow as large as hazel nuts. Both the black and the\r\nred Currants afford a pleasant home-made wine. _Ex eo optimum\r\nvinum fieri potest non deterius vinis vetioribus viteis_, wrote\r\nHaller in 1750. White Currants, however, yield the best wine, and\r\nthis may be improved by keeping, even for twenty years. Dr.\r\nThornton says: \"I have used old wine of white Currants for\r\ncalculous affections, and it has surpassed all expectation.\"\r\n\r\nA delicate jelly is made from the red Currant at Bas-le-duc; and a\r\nwell-known nursery rhyme tells of the tempting qualities of\r\n\"cherry pie, and currant wine.\" A rob of black Currant jam is taken\r\nin Scotland with whiskey toddy. Shakespeare in the _Winter's\r\nTale_ makes Antolycus, the shrewd \"picker-up of unconsidered\r\n[141] trifles\" talk of buying for the sheep-shearing feast \"three\r\npounds of sugar, five pounds of currants, and rice.\" In France a\r\ncordial called _Liqueur de cassis_ is made from black Currants;\r\nand a refreshing drink, _Eau de groseilles_, from the red.\r\n\r\nSome forty years ago, at the time of the Crimean war a patriotic\r\nsong in praise of the French flag was most popular in our streets,\r\nand had for its refrain, \"Hurrah for the Red, White, and Blue!\" So\r\nvaluable for food and physics are our tricoloured Currants that the\r\nsame argot may be justly paraphrased in their favour, with a\r\nwell-merited eulogium of \"Hurrah for the White, Red, Black!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAFFODIL.\r\n\r\nThe yellow Daffodil, which is such a favourite flower of our early\r\nSpring because of its large size, and showy yellow color, grows\r\ncommonly in English woods, fields, and orchards. Its popular\r\nnames, Daffodowndilly, Daffodily, and Affodily, bear reference to\r\nthe Asphodel, with which blossom of the ancient Greeks this is\r\nidentical. It further owns the botanical name of Narcissus\r\n(pseudo-narcissus)--not after the classical youth who met with his\r\ndeath through vainly trying to embrace his image reflected in a clear\r\nstream because of its exquisite beauty, and who is fabled to have\r\nbeen therefore changed into flower--but by reason of the narcotic\r\nproperties which the plant possesses, as signified by the Greek\r\nword, _Narkao_, \"to benumb.\" Pliny described it as a _Narce\r\nnarcisswm dictum, non a fabuloso puero_. An extract of the bulbs\r\nwhen applied to open wounds has produced staggering, numbness\r\nof the whole nervous system, and paralysis of the heart. Socrates\r\ncalled this plant the \"Chaplet of the Infernal Gods,\" because of its\r\n[142] narcotic effects. Nevertheless, the roots of the asphodel were\r\nthought by the ancient Greeks to be edible, and they were\r\ntherefore laid in tombs as food for the dead. Lucian tells us that\r\nCharon, the ferryman who rowed the souls of the departed over the\r\nriver Styx, said: \"I know why Mercury keeps us waiting here so\r\nlong. Down in these regions there is nothing to be had but,\r\nasphodel, and oblations, in the midst of mist and darkness;\r\nwhereas up in heaven he finds it all bright and clear, with\r\nambrosia there, and nectar in plenty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages the roots of the Daffodil were called _Cibi\r\nregis_, \"food for a king,\"; but his Majesty must have had a\r\ndisturbed night after partaking thereof, as they are highly\r\nstimulating to the kidneys: indeed, there is strong reason for\r\nsupposing that these roots have a prior claim to those of the\r\ndandelion for lectimingous fame, (_lectus_, \"the bed\"; _mingo_, to\r\n\"irrigate\").\r\n\r\nThe brilliant yellow blossom of the Daffodil possesses, as is well\r\nknown, a bell-shaped crown in the midst of its petals, which is\r\nstrikingly characteristic. The flower-stalk is hollow, bearing on its\r\nsummit a membranous sheath, which envelops a single flower of\r\nan unpleasant odour. But the Jonquil, which is a cultivated variety\r\nof the Daffodil, having white petals with a yellow crown, yields a\r\ndelicious perfume, which modern chemistry can closely imitate by\r\na hydrocarbon compound. If \"naphthalin,\" a product of coal tar oil,\r\nhas but the smallest particle of its scent diffused in a room, the\r\nspecial aroma of jonquil and narcissus is at once perceived.\r\n\r\nWhen the flowers of the Daffodil are dried in the sun, if a\r\ndecoction of them is made, from fifteen to thirty grains will prove\r\nemetic like that of Ipecacuanha. From five to six ounces of boiling\r\nwater should be poured on this quantity of the dried [143] flowers,\r\nand should stand for twenty minutes. It will then serve most\r\nusefully for relieving the congestive bronchial catarrh of children,\r\nbeing sweetened, and given one third at a time every ten or fifteen\r\nminutes until it provokes vomiting. It is also beneficial in this way,\r\nbut when given less often, for epidemic dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe chemical principles of the Daffodil have not been investigated;\r\nbut a yellow volatile oil of disagreeable odour, and a brown\r\ncolouring matter, have been got from the flowers.\r\n\r\nArabians commended this oil to be applied for curing baldness,\r\nand for stimulating the sexual organs.\r\n\r\nHerrick alludes in his _Hesperides_ to the Daffodil as death:--\r\n\r\n    \"When a Daffodil I see\r\n    Hanging down its head towards me,\r\n    Guess I may what I must be--\r\n    First I shall decline my head;\r\n    Secondly I shall be dead;\r\n    Lastly, safely buried.\"\r\n\r\nDaffodils, popularly known in this country as Lent Lilies, are\r\ncalled by the French _Pauvres filles de Sainte Clare_. The name\r\n_Junquillo_ is the Spanish diminutive of _Junco_, \"the rush,\" and\r\nis given to the jonquil because of its slender rush-like stem. From\r\nits fragrant flowers a sweet-smelling yellow oil is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal influence of the daffodil on the nervous System has\r\nled to giving its flowers and its bulb for Hysterical affections, and\r\neven epilepsy, with benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAISY.\r\n\r\nOur English Daisy is a composite flower which is called in the\r\nglossaries \"gowan,\" or Yellow flower. Botanically [144] it is\r\nnamed _Bellis perennis_, probably from _bellis_, \"in fields of\r\nbattle,\" because of its fame in healing the wounds of soldiers; and\r\nperennis as implying that though \"the rose has but a summer reign,\r\nthe daisy never dies,\" The flower is likewise known as \"Bainwort,\"\r\n\"beloved by children,\" and \"the lesser Consound.\" The whole plant\r\nhas been carefully and exhaustively proved for curative purposes;\r\nand a medicinal tincture (H.) is now made from it with spirit of\r\nwine. Gerard says: \"Daisies do mitigate all kinds of pain,\r\nespecially in the joints, and gout proceeding from a hot humour, if\r\nstamped with new butter and applied upon the pained place.\" And,\r\n\"The leaves of Daisies used among pot herbs do make the belly\r\nsoluble.\" Pliny tells us the Daisy was used in his time with\r\nMugwort as a resolvent to scrofulous tumours.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are acrid and pungent, being ungrateful to cattle, and\r\neven rejected by geese. These and the flowers, when chewed\r\nexperimentally, have provoked giddiness and pains in the arms as\r\nif from coming boils: also a development of boils, \"dark, fiery, and\r\nvery sore,\" on the back of the neck, and outside the jaws. For\r\npreventing, or aborting these same distressing formations when\r\nthey begin to occur spontaneously, the tincture of Daisies should\r\nbe taken in doses of five drops three times a day in water.\r\nLikewise this medicine should be given curatively on the principle\r\nof affinity between it and the symptoms induced in provers who\r\nhave taken the same in material toxic doses, \"when the brain is\r\nmuddled, the sight dim, the spirits soon depressed, the temper\r\nirritable, the skin pimply, the heart apt to flutter, and the whole\r\naspect careworn; as if from early excesses.\" Then the infusion of\r\nthe plant in tablespoonful doses, or the diluted tincture, will\r\nanswer admirably [145] to renovate and re-establish the health and\r\nstrength of the sufferer.\r\n\r\nThe flowers and leaves are found to afford a considerable quantity\r\nof oil and of ammoniacal salts. The root was named _Consolida\r\nminima _by older physicians. Fabricius speaks of its efficacy in\r\ncuring wounds and contusions. A decoction of the leaves and\r\nflowers was given internally, and the bruised herb blended with\r\nlard was applied outside. \"The leaves stamped do take away\r\nbruises and swellings, whereupon, it was called in old time\r\nBruisewort.\" If eaten as a spring salad, or boiled like spinach, the\r\nleaves are pungent, and slightly laxative.\r\n\r\nBeing a diminutive plant with roots to correspond, the Daisy, on\r\nthe doctrine of signatures, was formerly thought to arrest the\r\nbodily growth if taken with this view. Therefore its roots boiled in\r\nbroth were given to young puppies so as to keep them of a small\r\nsize. For the same reason the fairy Milkah fed her foster child on\r\nthis plant, \"that his height might not exceed that of a pigmy\":--\r\n\r\n    \"She robbed dwarf elders of their fragrant fruit,\r\n    And fed him early with the daisy-root,\r\n    Whence through his veins the powerful juices ran,\r\n    And formed the beauteous miniature of man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daisy-roots and cream\" were prescribed by the fairy godmothers\r\nof our childhood to stay the stature of those gawky youngsters\r\nwho were shooting up into an ungainly development like \"ill\r\nweeds growing apace.\"\r\n\r\nDaisies were said of old to be under the dominion of Venus, and\r\nlater on they were dedicated to St. Margaret of Cortona. Therefore\r\nthey were reputed good for the special-illnesses of females. It is\r\nremarkable there is no [146] Greek word for this plant, or flower.\r\nOssian the Gaelic poet feigns that the Daisy, whose white\r\ninvestments figure innocence, was first \"sown above a baby's\r\ngrave by the dimpled hands of infantine angels.\"\r\n\r\nDuring mediaeval times the Daisy was worn by knights at a\r\ntournament as an emblem of fidelity. In his poem the _Flower and\r\nthe Leaf_, Chaucer, who was ever loud in his praises of the \"Eye\r\nof Day\"--\"empresse and floure of floures all,\" thus pursues his\r\ntheme:--\r\n\r\n    \"And at the laste there began anon\r\n    A lady for to sing right womanly\r\n    A bargaret in praising the Daisie:\r\n    For--as methought among her notes sweet,\r\n    She said, '_Si doucet est la Margarete_.'\"\r\n\r\nThe French name _Marguerite _is derived from a supposed resemblance\r\nof the Daisy to a pearl; and in Germany this flower is known\r\nas the Meadow Pearl. Likewise the Greek word for a pearl is\r\n_Margaritos_.\r\n\r\nA saying goes that it is not Spring until a person can put his foot\r\non twelve of these flowers. In the cultivated red Daisies used for\r\nbordering our gardens, the yellow central boss of each compound\r\nflower has given place to strap-shaped florets like the outer rays,\r\nand without pollen, so that the entire flower consists of this purple\r\ninflorescence. But such aristocratic culture has made the blossom\r\nunproductive of seed. Like many a proud and belted Earl, each of\r\nthe pampered and richly coloured Daisies pays the penalty of its\r\nprivileged luxuriance by a disability from perpetuating its species.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Daisy, or Oxeye Daisy (_Leucanthemum Orysanthemum_),\r\nSt. John's flower, belonging to the same tribe of plants,\r\ngrows commonly with an erect stem about two feet high, in\r\ndry pastures and roads, bearing large solitary flowers which are\r\nbalsamic and make a [147] useful infusion for relieving chronic\r\ncoughs, and for bronchial catarrhs. Boiled with some of the leaves\r\nand stalks they form, if sweetened with honey, or barley sugar, an\r\nexcellent posset drink for the same purpose. In America the root is\r\nemployed successfully for checking the night sweats of pulmonary\r\nconsumption, a fluid extract thereof being made for this object, the\r\ndose of which is from fifteen to sixty drops in water.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Daisy is named Maudlin-wort from St. Mary Magdalene,\r\nand bears its lunar name from the Grecian goddess of the\r\nmoon, Artemis, who particularly governed the female health.\r\nSimilarly, our bright little Daisy, \"the constellated flower that\r\nnever sets,\" owns the name Herb Margaret. The Moon Daisy is\r\nalso called Bull Daisy, Gipsies' Daisy, Goldings, Midsummer\r\nDaisy, Mace Flinwort, and Espilawn. Its young leaves are\r\nsometimes used as a flavouring in soups and stews. The flower\r\nwas compared to the representation of a full moon, and was\r\nformerly dedicated to the Isis of the Egyptians. Tom Hood wrote\r\nof a traveller estranged far from his native shores, and walking\r\ndespondently in a distant land:--\r\n\r\n    \"When lo! he starts with glad surprise,\r\n        Home thoughts come rushing o'er him,\r\n    For, modest, wee, and crimson-tipped\r\n        A flower he sees before him.\r\n    With eager haste he stoops him down,\r\n        His eyes with moisture hazy;\r\n    And as he plucks the simple bloom\r\n        He murmurs, 'Lawk, a Daisy'\"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANDELION.\r\n\r\nOwing to long years of particular evolutionary sagacity in\r\ndeveloping winged seeds to be wafted from the silky pappus of its\r\nripe flowerheads over wide areas of land, [148] the Dandelion\r\nexhibits its handsome golden flowers in every field and on every\r\nground plot throughout the whole of our country. They are to be\r\ndistinguished from the numerous hawkweeds, by having the\r\noutermost leaves of their exterior cup bent downwards whilst the\r\nstalk is coloured and shining. The plant-leaves have jagged edges\r\nwhich resemble the angular jaw of a lion fully supplied with teeth;\r\nor, some writers say, the herb has been named from the heraldic\r\nlion which is vividly yellow, with teeth of gold-in fact, a dandy\r\nlion! Again, the flower closely resembles the sun, which a lion\r\nrepresents. It is called by some Blowball, Time Table, and Milk\r\n\"Gowan\" (or golden).\r\n\r\n    \"How like a prodigal does Nature seem,\r\n    When thou with all thy gold so common art.\"\r\n\r\nIn some of our provinces the herb is known as Wiggers, and\r\nSwinesnout; whilst again in Devon and Cornwall it is called the\r\nDashelflower. Botanically it belongs to the composite order, and is\r\nnamed _Taraxacum Leontodon_, or eatable, and lion-toothed. This\r\nlatter when Latinised is _dens leonis_, and in French _dent de\r\nlion_. The title Taraxacum is an Arabian corruption of the Greek\r\n_trogimon_, \"edible\"; or it may have been derived from the Greek\r\n_taraxos_, \"disorder,\" and _akos_, \"remedy.\" It once happened\r\nthat a plague of insects destroyed the harvest in the island of\r\nMinorca, so that the inhabitants had to eat the wild produce of the\r\ncountry; and many of them then subsisted for some while entirely\r\non this plant. The Dandelion, which is a wild sort of Succory, was\r\nknown to Arabian physicians, since Avicenna of the eleventh\r\ncentury mentions it as _taraxacon_. It is found throughout Europe,\r\nAsia, and North America; possessing a root which abounds with\r\nmilky juice, and [149] this varying in character according to the\r\ntime of year in which the plant is gathered.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter the sap is thick, sweet, and albuminous; but in\r\nsummer time it is bitter and acrid. Frost causes the bitterness to\r\ndiminish, and sweetness to take its place; but after the frost this\r\nbitterness returns, and is intensified. The root is at its best for\r\nyielding juice about November. Chemically the active ingredients\r\nof the herb are taraxacin, and taraxacerine, with inulin (a sort of\r\nsugar), gluten, gum, albumen, potash, and an odorous resin, which\r\nis commonly supposed to stimulate the liver, and the biliary\r\norgans. Probably this reputed virtue was assigned at first to the\r\nplant largely on the doctrine of signatures, because of its bright\r\nyellow flowers of a bilious hue. But skilled medical provers who\r\nhave experimentally tested the toxical effects of the Dandelion\r\nplant have found it to produce, when taken in excess, troublesome\r\nindigestion, characterized by a tongue coated with a white skin\r\nwhich peels off in patches, leaving a raw surface, whilst the\r\nkidneys become unusually active, with profuse night sweats and\r\nan itching nettle rash. For these several symptoms when occurring\r\nof themselves, a combination of the decoction, and the medicinal\r\ntincture will be invariably curative.\r\n\r\nTo make a decoction of the root, one part of this dried, and sliced,\r\nshould be gently boiled for fifteen minutes in twenty parts of\r\nwater, and strained off when cool. It may be sweetened with\r\nbrown sugar, or honey, if unpalatable when taken alone, several\r\nteacupfuls being given during the day. Dandelion roots as\r\ncollected for the market are often adulterated with those of the\r\ncommon Hawkbit (_Leontodon hispidus_); but these are more\r\ntough and do not give out any milky juice.\r\n\r\n[150] The tops of the roots dug out of the ground, with the tufts of\r\nthe leaves remaining thereon, and blanched by being covered in\r\nthe earth as they grow, if gathered in the spring, are justly\r\nesteemed as an excellent vernal salad. It was with this homely fare\r\nthe good wise Hecate entertained Theseus, as we read in Evelyn's\r\n_Acetaria_. Bergius says he has seen intractable cases of liver\r\ncongestion cured, after many other remedies had failed, by the\r\npatients taking daily for some months, a broth made from\r\nDandelion roots stewed in boiling water, with leaves of Sorrel, and\r\nthe yelk of an egg; though (he adds) they swallowed at the same\r\ntime cream of tartar to keep their bodies open.\r\n\r\nIncidentally with respect to the yelk of an egg, as prescribed here,\r\nit is an established fact that patients have been cured of obstinate\r\njaundice by taking a raw egg on one or more mornings while\r\nfasting. Dr. Paris tells us a special oil is to be extracted from the\r\nyelks (only) of hard boiled eggs, roasted in pieces in a frying pan\r\nuntil the oil begins to exude, and then pressed hard. Fifty eggs well\r\nfried will yield about five ounces of this oil, which is acrid, and so\r\nenduringly liquid that watch-makers use it for lubricating the axles\r\nand pivots of their most delicate wheels. Old eggs furnish the oil\r\nmost abundantly, and it certainly acts as a very useful medicine for\r\nan obstructed liver. Furthermore the shell, when finely triturated,\r\nhas served by its potentialised lime to cure some forms of cancer.\r\nSweet are the uses of adversity! even such as befell the egg\r\nsymbolised by Humpty-Dumpty:--\r\n\r\n    \"Humptius in muro requievit Dumptius alto,\r\n    Humptius e muro Dumptius--heu! cecidit!\r\n    Sed non Regis equi, Reginae exercitus omnis\r\n    Humpti, te, Dumpti, restituere loco.\"\r\n\r\n[151] The medicinal tincture of Dandelion is made from the entire\r\nplant, gathered in summer, employing proof spirit which dissolves\r\nalso the resinous parts not soluble in water. From ten to fifteen\r\ndrops of this tincture may be taken with a spoonful of water three\r\ntimes in the day.\r\n\r\nOf the freshly prepared juice, which should not be kept long as it\r\nquickly ferments, from two to three teaspoonfuls are a proper\r\ndose. The leaves when tender and white in the spring are taken on\r\nthe Continent in salads or they are blanched, and eaten with bread\r\nand butter. Parkinson says: \"Whoso is drawing towards a\r\nconsumption, or ready to fall into a cachexy, shall find a\r\nwonderful help from the use thereof, for some time together.\"\r\nOfficially, according to the London College, are prepared from the\r\nfresh dried roots collected in the autumn, a decoction (one ounce\r\nto a pint of boiling water), a juice, a fresh extract, and an\r\ninspissated liquid extract.\r\n\r\nBecause of its tendency to provoke involuntary urination at night,\r\nthe Dandelion has acquired a vulgar suggestive appellation which\r\nexpresses this fact in most homey terms: _quasi herba lectiminga,\r\net urinaria dicitur_: and this not only in our vernacular, but in most\r\nof the European tongues: _quia plus lotii in vesicam derivat quam\r\npuerulis retineatur proesertim inter dormiendum, eoque tunc\r\nimprudentes et inviti stragula permingunt_.\r\n\r\nAt Gottingen, the roots are roasted and used instead of coffee by\r\nthe poorer folk; and in Derbyshire the juice of the stalk is applied\r\nto remove warts. The flower of the Dandelion when fully blown is\r\nnamed Priest's Crown (_Caput monachi_), from the resemblance\r\nof its naked receptacle after the winged seeds have been all blown\r\naway, to the smooth shorn head of a Roman [152] cleric. So\r\nHurdis sings in his poem _The Village Curate_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Dandelion this:\r\n    A college youth that flashes for a day\r\n    All gold: anon he doffs his gaudy suit,\r\n    Touched by the magic hand of Bishop grave,\r\n    And all at once by commutation strange\r\n    Becomes a reverend priest: and then how sleek!\r\n    How full of grace! with silvery wig at first\r\n    So nicely trimmed, which presently grows bald.\r\n    But let me tell you, in the pompous globe\r\n    Which rounds the Dandelion's head is fitly couched\r\n    Divinity most rare.\"\r\n\r\nBoys gather the flower when ripe, and blow away the hall of its\r\nsilky seed vessels at the crown, to learn the time of day, thus\r\nsportively making:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dandelion with globe of down\r\n    The school-boy's clock in every town.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDATE.\r\n\r\nDates are the most wholesome and nourishing of all our imported\r\nfruits. Children especially appreciate their luscious sweetness, as\r\nafforded by an abundant sugar which is easily digested, and which\r\nquickly repairs waste of heat and fat. With such a view, likewise,\r\ndoctors now advise dates for consumptive patients; also because\r\nthey soothe an irritable chest, and promote expectoration; whilst,\r\nfurthermore, they prevent costiveness. Dates are the fruit of the\r\nDate palm (_Phoenix dactylifera_), or, Tree of Life.\r\n\r\nIn old English Bibles of the sixteenth century, the name Date-tree\r\nis constantly given to the Palm, and the fruit thereof was the first\r\nfound by the Israelites when wandering in the Wilderness.\r\n\r\nOriental writers have attributed to this tree a certain semi-human\r\nconsciousness. The name _Phoenix_ was [153] bestowed on the\r\nDate palm because a young shoot springs always from the withered\r\nstump of an old decayed Date tree, taking the place of the\r\ndead parent; and the specific term _Dactylifera_ refers to a fancied\r\nresemblance between clusters of the fruit and the human fingers.\r\n\r\nThe Date palm is remarkably fond of water, and will not thrive\r\nunless growing near it, so that the Arabs say: \"In order to flourish,\r\nits feet must be in the water, and its head in the fire (of a hot sun).\"\r\nTravellers across the desert, when seeing palm Dates in the\r\nhorizon, know that wells of water will be found near at hand: at\r\nthe same time they sustain themselves with Date jam.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the East this Date palm is thought been the tree of\r\nthe forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. It is mystically\r\nrepresented as the tree of life in the sculptured foliage of early\r\nFrench churches, and on the primitive mosaics found in the apses\r\nof Roman Basilicas. Branches of this tree are carried about in\r\nCatholic countries on Palm Sunday. Formerly Dates were sent to\r\nEngland and elsewhere packed in mats from the Persian gulf; but\r\nnow they arrive in clean boxes, neatly laid, and free from duty; so\r\nthat a wholesome, sustaining, and palatable meal may be had for\r\none penny, if they are eaten with bread.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian Dates are superior, being succulent and luscious\r\nwhen new, but apt to become somewhat hard after Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe Dates, however, which surpass all others in their general\r\nexcellence, are grown with great care at Tafilat, two or three\r\nhundred miles inland from Morocco, a region to which Europeans\r\nseldom penetrate.\r\n\r\nThese Dates travel in small packages by camel, rail, and steamer,\r\nbeing of the best quality, and highly valued. Their exportation is\r\nprohibited by the African [154] authorities at Tafilat, unless the\r\nfruit crop has been large enough to allow thereof after gathering\r\nthe harvest with much religious ceremony.\r\n\r\nDates of a second quality are brought from Tunis, being intermixed\r\nwith fragments of stalk and branch; whilst the inferior sorts\r\ncome in the form of a cake, or paste (_adjoue!_), being pressed\r\ninto baskets. In this shape they were tolerably common with us\r\nin Tudor times, and were then used for medicinal purposes. Strutt\r\nmentions a grocer's bill delivered in 1581, in which occurs\r\nthe item of six pounds of dates supplied at a funeral for\r\ntwo shillings; and we read that in 1821 the best kind of dates\r\ncost five shillings a pound.\r\n\r\nIf taken as a portable refection by jurymen and others who may be\r\nkept from their customary food Dates will prevent exhaustion, and\r\nwill serve to keep active the energies of mind and body. The fruit\r\nshould be selected when large and soft, being moist, and of a\r\nreddish yellow colour outside, and not much wrinkled, whilst\r\nhaving within a white membrane between the flesh and the stone.\r\n\r\nBeads for rosaries are made in Barbary from Date stones turned in\r\na lathe; or when soaked in water for a couple of days the stones\r\nmay be given to cattle as a nutritious food, being first ground in a\r\nmill. The fodder being astringent will serve by its tannin, which is\r\nabundant, to cure or prevent looseness.\r\n\r\nIn a clever parody on Bret Harte's \"Heathen Chinee,\" an undergraduate\r\nis detected in having primed himself before examination thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Inscribed on his cuffs were the Furies, and Fates,\r\n    With a delicate map of the Dorian States:\r\n    Whilst they found in his palms, which were hollow,\r\n    What are common in Palms--namely, Dates.\"\r\n\r\n[155] Again, a conserve is prepared by the Egyptians from unripe\r\nDates whole with sugar. The soft stones are edible: and this jam,\r\nthough tasteless, is very nourishing. The Arabs say that Adam\r\nwhen driven out of Paradise took with him three things--the Date,\r\nchief of all fruits, Myrtle, and an ear of Wheat.\r\n\r\nAnother Palm--the _Sagus_, or, _Cycus revolute_,--which grows\r\nnaturally in Japan and the East Indian Islands, being also\r\ncultivated in English hot-houses, yields by its gummy pith our\r\nhighly nutritious sago. This when cooked is one of the best and\r\nmost sustaining foods for children and infirm old persons. The\r\nIndians reserve their finest sago for the aged and afflicted. A\r\nfecula is washed from the abundant pith, which is chemically a\r\nstarch, very demulcent, and more digestible than that of rice. It\r\nnever ferments in the stomach, and is very suitable for hectic\r\npersons. By the Arabs the pith of the Date-bearing Palm is eaten in\r\nlike manner. The simple wholesome virtues of this domestic\r\nsubstance have been told of from childhood in the well-known\r\nnursery rhyme, which has been playfully rendered into Latin and\r\nFrench:--\r\n\r\n    \"There was an old man of Iago\r\n    Whom they kept upon nothing but sago;\r\n    Oh! how he did jump when the doctor said plump:\r\n    'To a roast leg of mutton you may go.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Jamdudum senior quidam de rure Tobagus\r\n    Invito mad das carpserat ore dapes;\r\n    Sed medicus tandem non injucunda locutus:\r\n    'Assoe' dixit 'oves sunt tibi coena, senex.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"J'ai entendu parler d'un veillard de Tobag\r\n    Qui ne mangea longtemps que du ris et du sague;\r\n    Mais enfin le medecin lui dit ces mots:\r\n    'Allez vous en, mon ami, au gigot.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[156] DILL.\r\n\r\nCordial waters distilled from the fragrant herb called Dill are, as\r\nevery mother and monthly nurse well know, a sovereign remedy\r\nfor wind in the infant; whilst they serve equally well to correct\r\nflatulence in the grown up \"gourmet.\" This highly scented plant\r\n(_Anethum graveolens_) is of Asiatic origin, growing wild also in\r\nsome parts of England, and commonly cultivated in our gardens\r\nfor kitchen or medicinal uses.\r\n\r\nIt \"hath a little stalk of a cubit high, round, and joyned, whereupon\r\ndo grow leaves very finely cut, like to those of Fennel, but much\r\nsmaller.\" The herb is of the umbelliferous order, and its fruit\r\nchemically furnishes \"anethol,\" a volatile empyreumatic oil similar\r\nto that contained in the Anise, and Caraway. Virgil speaks of the\r\nDill in his _Second Eclogue _as the _bene olens anethum_, \"a\r\npleasant and fragrant plant.\" Its seeds were formerly directed to be\r\nused by the _Pharmacopoeias_ of London and Edinburgh. Forestus\r\nextols them for allaying sickness and hiccough. Gerard says:\r\n\"Dill stayeth the yeox, or hicquet, as Dioscorides has taught.\"\r\n\r\nThe name _Anethum _was a radical Greek term (_aitho_--to\r\nburn), and the herb is still called Anet in some of our country\r\ndistricts. The pungent essential oil which it yields consists of a\r\nhydrocarbon, \"carvene,\" together with an oxygenated oil; It is a\r\n\"gallant expeller of the wind, and provoker of the terms.\" \"Limbs\r\nthat are swollen and cold if rubbed with the oil of Dill are much\r\neased; if not cured thereby.\"\r\n\r\nA dose of the essential oil if given for flatulent indigestion should\r\nbe from two to four drops, on sugar, or with a tablespoonful of\r\nmilk. Of the distilled water sweetened, one or two teaspoonfuls\r\nmay be given to an infant.\r\n\r\n[157] The name Dill is derived from the Saxon verb _dilla_, to\r\nlull, because of its tranquillizing properties, and its causing\r\nchildren to sleep. This word occurs in the vocabulary of Oelfric,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, tenth century. Dioscorides gave the oil\r\ngot from the flowers for rheumatic pains, and sciatica; also a\r\ncarminative water distilled from the fruit, for increasing the milk\r\nof wet nurses, and for appeasing the windy belly-aches of babies.\r\nHe teaches that a teaspoonful of the bruised seeds if boiled in\r\nwater and taken hot with bread soaked therein, wonderfully helps\r\nsuch as are languishing from hardened excrements, even though\r\nthey may have vomited up their faeces.\r\n\r\nThe plant is largely grown in the East Indies, where is known as\r\n_Soyah_. Its fruit and leaves are used for flavouring pickles, and\r\nits water is given to parturient women.\r\n\r\nDrayton speaks of the Dill as a magic ingredient in Love potions;\r\nand the weird gipsy, Meg Merrilies, crooned a cradle song at the\r\nbirth of Harry Bertram in it was said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Trefoil, vervain, John's wort, _Dill_,\r\n    Hinder witches of their will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCK.\r\n\r\nThe term Dock is botanically a noun of multitude, meaning originally\r\na bundle of hemp, and corresponding to a similar word signifying a\r\nflock. It became in early times applied to a wide-spread tribe of\r\nbroad-leaved wayside weeds. They all belong to the botanical order\r\nof _Polygonaceoe_, or \"many kneed\" plants, because, like the wife\r\nof Yankee Doodle, famous in song, they are \"double-jointed;\"\r\nthough he, poor man! expecting to find Mistress Doodle doubly\r\nactive in her household [158] duties, was, as the rhyme says,\r\n\"disappointed.\" The name \"Dock\" was first applied to the _Arctium\r\nLappa_, or Bur-dock, so called because of its seed-vessels\r\nbecoming frequently entangled by their small hooked spines\r\nin the wool of sheep passing along by the hedge-rows. Then\r\nthe title got to include other broad-leaved herbs, all of the Sorrel\r\nkind, and used in pottage, or in medicine.\r\n\r\nOf the Docks which are here recognized, some are cultivated, such\r\nas Garden Rhubarb, and the Monk's Rhubarb, or herb Patience, an\r\nexcellent pot herb; whilst others grow wild in meadows, and by\r\nriver sides, such as the round-leafed Dock (_Rumex obtusifolius_),\r\nthe sharp-pointed Dock (_Rumex acutus_), the sour Dock (_Rumex\r\nacetosus_), the great water Dock (_Rumex hydrolapathum_),\r\nand the bloody-veined Dock (_Rumex sanguineus_).\r\n\r\nAll these resemble our garden rhubarb more or less in their general\r\ncharacteristics, and in possessing much tannin. Most of them\r\nchemically furnish \"rumicin,\" or crysophanic acid, which is highly\r\nuseful in several chronic diseases of the skin among scrofulous\r\npatients. The generic name of several Docks is _rumex_, from the\r\nHebrew _rumach_, a \"spear\"; others arc called _lapathum_, from\r\nthe Greek verb _lapazein_, to cleanse, because they act medicinally\r\nas purgatives.\r\n\r\nThe common wayside Dock (_Rumex obtusifolius_) is the most\r\nordinary of all the Docks, being large and spreading, and so coarse\r\nthat cattle refuse to eat it. The leaves are often applied as a rustic\r\nremedy to burns and scalds, and are used for dressing blisters.\r\nLikewise a popular cure for nettle stings is to rub them with a\r\nDock leaf, saying at the same time:--\r\n\r\n    \"Out nettle: in Dock;\r\n    Dock shall have a new smock.\"\r\n\r\n[159] or:\r\n\r\n    \"Nettle out: Dock in;\r\n    Dock remove the nettle sting.\"\r\n\r\nA tea made from the root was formerly given for the cure of boils,\r\nand the plant is frequently called Butterdock, because its leaves\r\nare put into use for wrapping up butter. This Dock will not thrive\r\nin poor worthless soil; but its broad foliage serves to lodge the\r\ndestructive turnip fly. The root when dried maybe added to tooth\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nIt was under the broad leaf of a roadside Dock that Hop o' My\r\nThumb, famous in nursery lore, sought refuge from a storm, and\r\nwas unfortunately swallowed whilst still beneath the leaf by a\r\npassing hungry cow.\r\n\r\nThe herb Patience, or Monk's Rhubarb (_Rumex alpinus_), a\r\nGriselda among herbs, may be given with admirable effect in\r\npottage, as a domestic aperient, \"loosening the belly, helping the\r\njaundice, and dispersing the tympany.\" This grows wild in some\r\nparts, by roadsides, and near cottages, but is not common except as\r\na cultivated herb ill the kitchen-garden, known as \"Patience-dock.\"\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the toughest flesh-meat, if boiled with\r\nthe herb, or with other kindred docks, will become quite tender.\r\nThe name Patience, or Passions, was probably from the Italian\r\n_Lapazio_, a corruption of _Lapathum_, which was mistaken for\r\n_la passio_, the passion of Christ.\r\n\r\nOur _Garden Rhubarb_ is a true Dock, and belongs to the \"many-kneed,\"\r\nbuckwheat order of plants. Its brilliant colouring is due to\r\nvarying states of its natural pigment (_chlorophyll_), in\r\ncombination with oxygen. For culinary purposes the stalk, or\r\npetiole of the broad leaf, is used. Its chief nutrient property is\r\nglucose, which is identical with grape-sugar. The agreeable taste\r\nand odour of the [160] plant are not brought out until the leaf\r\nstalks are cooked. It came originally from the Volga, and has been\r\ngrown in this country since 1573. The sour taste of the stalks is\r\ndue to oxalic acid, or rather to the acid oxalate of potash. This\r\ncombines with the lime elaborated in the system of a gouty person\r\n(having an \"oxalic acid\" disposition), and makes insoluble and\r\ninjurious products which have to be thrown off by the kidneys as\r\noxalate crystals, with much attendant irritation of the general\r\nsystem. Sorrel (_Rumex acetosus_) acts with such a person in just\r\nthe same way, because of the acid oxalate of potash which it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nGarden Rhubarb also possesses albumen, gum, and mineral matters,\r\nwith a small quantity of some volatile essence. The proportion\r\nof nutritive substance to the water and vegetable fibre is\r\nvery small. As an article of food it is objectionable for gouty\r\npersons liable to the passage of highly coloured urine, which\r\ndeposits lithates and urates as crystals after it has cooled; and this\r\nespecially holds good if hard water, which contains lime, is drunk\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nThe round-leaved Dock, and the sharp-pointed Dock, together\r\nwith the bloody-veined Dock (which is very conspicuous because\r\nof its veins and petioles abounding in a blood-coloured juice),\r\nmake respectively with their astringent roots a useful infusion\r\nagainst bleedings and fluxes; also with their leaves a decoction\r\ncurative of several chronic skin diseases.\r\n\r\nThe _Rumex acetosus_ (Sour Dock, or Sorrel), though likely to\r\ndisagree with gouty persons, nevertheless supplies its leaves as the\r\nchief constituent of the _Soupe aux herbes_, which a French lady\r\nwill order for herself after a long and tiring journey. Its title is\r\nderived as some think, from struma, because curative [161]\r\nthereof. This Dock further bears the names of Sour sabs, Sour\r\ngrabs, Soursuds, Soursauce, Cuckoo sorrow, and Greensauce.\r\nBecause of their acidity the leaves make a capital dressing with\r\nstewed lamb, veal, or sweetbread. Country people beat the herb to\r\na mash, and take it mixed with vinegar and sugar as a green sauce\r\nwith cold meat. When boiled by itself without water it serves as an\r\nexcellent accompaniment to roast goose or pork instead of apple\r\nsauce. The root of Sorrel when dried has the singular property of\r\nimparting a fine red colour to boiling water, and it is therefore\r\nused by the French for making barley water look like red wine\r\nwhen they wish to avoid giving anything of a vinous character to\r\nthe sick. In Ireland Sorrel leaves are eaten with fish, and with other\r\nalkalescent foods. Because corrective of scrofulous deposits,\r\nSorrel is specially beneficial towards the cure of scurvy. Applied\r\nexternally the bruised leaves will purify foul ulcers. Says John\r\nEvelyn in his noted _Acetaria _(1720), \"Sorrel sharpens the\r\nappetite, assuages heat, cools the liver and strengthens the heart; it\r\nis an antiscorbutic, resisting putrefaction, and in the making of\r\nsallets imparts a grateful quickness to the rest as supplying the\r\nwant of oranges and lemons. Together with salt it gives both the\r\nname and the relish to sallets from the sapidity which renders not\r\nplants and herbs only, but men themselves, and their conversations\r\npleasant and agreeable. But of this enough, and perhaps too much!\r\nlest while I write of salts and sallets I appear myself insipid.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wood Sorrel (_Oxalis acetosella_) is a distinct plant from the\r\nDock Sorrel, and is not one of the _Polygonaceoe_, but a\r\ngeranium, having a triple leaf which is often employed to\r\nsymbolise the Trinity. Painters of old [162] placed it in the\r\nforeground of their pictures when representing the crucifixion. The\r\nleaves are sharply acid through oxalate of potash, commonly\r\ncalled \"Salts of Lemon,\" which is quite a misleading name in its\r\napparent innocence as applied to so strong a poison. The petals are\r\nbluish coloured, veined with purple. Formerly, on account of its\r\ngrateful acidity, a conserve was ordered by the London College to\r\nbe made from the leaves and petals of Wood Sorrel, with sugar\r\nand orange peel, and it was called _Conserva lujuoe_.\r\n\r\nThe Burdock (_Arctium lappa_) grows very commonly in our\r\nwaste places, with wavy leaves, and round heads of purple\r\nflowers, and hooked scales. From the seeds a medicinal tincture\r\n(H.) is made, and a fluid extract, of which from ten to thirty drops,\r\ngiven three times a day, with two tablespoonfuls of cold water,\r\nwill materially benefit certain chronic skin diseases (such as\r\npsoriasis), if taken steadily for several weeks, or months. Dr.\r\nReiter of Pittsburg, U.S.A., says the Burdock feed has proved in\r\nhis hands almost a specific for psoriasis and for obstinate syphilis.\r\nThe tincture is of special curative value for treating that depressed\r\nstate of the general health which is associated with milky\r\nphosphates in the urine, and much nervous debility. Eight or ten\r\ndrops of the reduced tincture should be given in water three times\r\na day.\r\n\r\nThe root in decoction is an excellent remedy for other skin\r\ndiseases of the scaly, itching, vesicular, pimply and ulcerative\r\ncharacters. Many persons think it superior to Sarsaparilla. The\r\nburs of this Dock are sometimes called \"Cocklebuttons,\" or\r\n\"Cucklebuttons,\" and \"Beggarsbuttons.\" Its Anglo-Saxon name\r\nwas \"Fox's clote.\"\r\n\r\nBoys throw them into the air at dusk to catch bats, which dart at\r\nthe Bur in mistake for a moth or fly; [163] then becoming\r\nentangled with the thorny spines they fall helplessly to the ground.\r\nOf the botanical names, _Arctium_ derived from _arktos_, a bear, in\r\nallusion to the roughness of the burs; and _Lappa_ is from\r\n_labein_, to seize. Other appellations of the herb are Clot-bur\r\n(from sticking to clouts, or clothes), Clithe, Hurbur, and Hardock.\r\nThe leaves when applied externally are highly resolvent for\r\ntumours, bruises, and gouty swellings. In the _Philadelphia\r\nRecorder_ for January, 1893, a striking case is given of a fallen\r\nwomb cured after twenty years' duration by a decoction of\r\nBurdock roots. The liquid extract acts as an admirable remedy in\r\nsome forms (strumous) of longstanding indigestion. The roots\r\ncontain starch; and the ashes of the plant burnt when green yield\r\ncarbonate of potash abundantly, with nitre, and inulin.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Curled Dock (_Rumex crispus_), so called because its\r\nleaves are crisped at their edges, grows freely in our roadside\r\nditches, and waste places, as a common plant; and a medicinal\r\ntincture which is very useful (H.) is made from it before it flowers.\r\nThis is of particular service for giving relief to an irritable\r\ntickling cough of the upper air-tubes, and the throat, when these\r\npassages are rough and sore, and sensitive to the cold atmosphere,\r\nwith a dry cough occurring in paroxysms. It is likewise excellent for\r\ndispelling any obstinate itching of the skin, in which respect it was\r\nsingularly beneficial against the contagious army-itch which\r\nprevailed during the last American war. It acts like Sarsaparilla\r\nchiefly, for curing scrofulous skin affections and glandular\r\nswellings. To be applied externally an ointment may be made by\r\nboiling the root in vinegar until the fibre is softened, and by then\r\nmixing the pulp with lard (to which some sulphur is [164] added at\r\ntimes). In all such cases of a scrofulous sort from five to ten drops\r\nof the tincture should be given two or three times a day with a\r\nspoonful of cold water.\r\n\r\nRumicin is the active principle of the Yellow Curled Dock; and\r\nfrom the root, containing chrysarobin, a dried extract is prepared\r\nofficinally, of which from one to four grains may be given for a\r\ndose in a pill. This is useful for relieving a congested liver, as\r\nwell as for scrofulous skin diseases.\r\n\r\n\"Huds,\" or the great Water Dock (_Rumex hydrolapathum_) is of\r\nfrequent growth on our river banks, bearing numerous green\r\nflowers in leafless whorls, and being identical with the famous\r\n_Herba Britannica_ of Pliny. This name does not denote British\r\norigin, but is derived from three Teuton words, _brit_, to tighten:\r\n_tan_, a tooth; and _ica_, loose; thus expressing its power of\r\nbracing up loose teeth and spongy gums. Swedish ladies employ\r\nthe powdered root as a dentifrice; and gargles prepared therefrom\r\nare excellent for sore throat and relaxed uvula. The fresh root must\r\nbe used, as it quickly turns yellow and brown in the air. The green\r\nleaves make a capital application for ulcers of the legs. They\r\npossess considerable acidity, and are laxative. Horace was aware\r\nof this fact, as we learn by his _Sermonum, Libr_. ii., _Satir_ 4:--\r\n\r\n    \"Si dura morabitur alvus,\r\n    Mytulus, et viles pellent, obstantia conchae,\r\n    Et Lapathi brevis herba, sed albo non sine Coo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELDER.\r\n\r\n\"'Arn,' or the common Elder,\" says Gerard, \"groweth everywhere;\r\nand it is planted about cony burrows, for the shadow of the\r\nconies.\" Formerly it was much [165] cultivated near our English\r\ncottages, because supposed to afford protection against witches.\r\nHence it is that the Elder tree may be so often seen immediately\r\nnear old village houses. It acquired its name from the Saxon word\r\n_eller_ or _kindler_, because its hollow branches were made into\r\ntubes to blow through for brightening up a dull fire. By the Greeks\r\nit was called _Aktee_. The botanical name of the Elder is\r\n_Sambucus nigra_, from _sambukee_, a sackbut, because the\r\nyoung branches, with their pith removed, were brought into\r\nrequisition for making the pipes of this, and other musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nIt was probably introduced as a medicinal plant at the time of the\r\nMonasteries. The adjective term _nigra_ refers to the colour of the\r\nberries. These are without odour, rather acid, and sweetish to the\r\ntaste. The French put layers of the flowers among apples, to which\r\nthey impart, an agreeable odour and flavour like muscatel. A tract\r\non _Elder and Juniper Berries, showing how useful they may be in\r\nour Coffee Houses_, is published with the _Natural History of\r\nCoffee_, 1682. Elder flowers are fatal to turkeys.\r\n\r\nHippocrates gave the bark as a purgative; and from his time the\r\nwhole tree has possessed a medicinal celebrity, whilst its fame in\r\nthe hands of the herbalist is immemorial. German writers have\r\ndeclared it contains within itself a magazine of physic, and a\r\ncomplete chest of medicaments.\r\n\r\nThe leaves when bruised, if worn in the hat, or rubbed on the face,\r\nwill prevent flies from settling on the person. Likewise turnips,\r\ncabbages, fruit trees, or corn, if whipped with the branches and\r\ngreen leaves of Elder, will gain an immunity from all depredations\r\nof blight; but moths are fond of the blossom.\r\n\r\nDried Elder flowers have a dull yellow colour, being [166]\r\nshrivelled, and possessing a sweet faint smell, unlike the repulsive\r\nodour of the fresh leaves and bark. They have a somewhat bitter,\r\ngummy taste, and are sold in entire cymes, with the stalks. An\r\nopen space now seen in Malvern Chase was formerly called\r\nEldersfield, from the abundance of Elder trees which grew there.\r\n\"The flowers were noted,\" says Mr. Symonds, \"for eye ointments,\r\nand the berries for honey rob and black pigments. Mary of\r\nEldersfield, the daughter of Bolingbroke, was famous for her\r\nknowledge of herb pharmacy, and for the efficacy of her nostrums.\"\r\n\r\nChemically the flowers contain a yellow, odorous, buttery oil, with\r\ntannin, and malates of potash and lime, whilst the berries furnish\r\nviburnic acid. On expression they yield a fine purple juice, which\r\nproves a useful laxative, and a resolvent in recent colds. Anointed\r\non the hair they make it black.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture (H.) is made from the fresh inner bark of the\r\nyoung branches. This, when given in toxical quantities, will induce\r\nprofuse sweating, and will cause asthmatic symptoms to present\r\nthemselves. When used in a diluted form it is highly beneficial for\r\nrelieving the same symptoms, if they come on as an attack of\r\nillness, particularly for the spurious croup of children, which\r\nwakes them at night with a suffocative cough and wheezing. A\r\ndose of four or five drops, if given at once, and perhaps repeated\r\nin fifteen minutes, will straightway prove of singular service.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne said that in his day the Elder had become a\r\nfamous medicine for quinsies, sore throats, and strangulations.\r\n\r\nThe inspissated juice or \"rob\" extracted from the crushed berries,\r\nand simmered with white sugar, is cordial, aperient, and diuretic.\r\nThis has long been a [167] popular English remedy, taken hot at\r\nbed-time, when a cold is caught. One or two tablespoonfuls\r\nare mixed with a tumblerful of very hot water. It promotes\r\nperspiration, and is demulcent to the chest. Five pounds of the\r\nfresh berries are to be used with one pound of loaf sugar, and the\r\njuice should be evaporated to the thickness of honey.\r\n\r\n\"The recent rob of the Elder spread thick upon a slice of bread and\r\neaten before other dishes,\" says Dr. Blochwich, 1760, \"is our\r\nwives' domestic medicine, which they use likewise in their infants\r\nand children whose bellies are stop't longer than ordinary; for this\r\njuice is most pleasant and familiar to children; or to loosen the\r\nbelly drink a draught of the wine at your breakfast, or use the\r\nconserve of the buds.\"\r\n\r\nAlso a capital wine, which may well pass for Frontignac, is\r\ncommonly made from the fresh berries, with raisins, sugar, and\r\nspices. When well brewed, and three years' old, it constitutes\r\nEnglish port. \"A cup of mulled Elder wine, served with nutmeg\r\nand sippets of toast, just before going to bed on a cold wintry\r\nnight, is a thing,\" as Cobbet said, \"to be run for.\" The juice of\r\nElder root, if taken in a dose of one or two tablespoonfuls when\r\nfasting, acts as a strong aperient, being \"the most excellent purger\r\nof watery humours in the world, and very singular against dropsy,\r\nif taken once in the week.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn, in his _Sylva_ (1729), said of the Elder: \"If the\r\nmedicinal properties of its leaves, bark, and berries, were fully\r\nknown, I cannot tell what our countrymen could ail, for which he\r\nmight not fetch a remedy from every hedge, either for sickness or\r\nwounds.\" \"The buds boiled in water gruel have effected wonders in a\r\nfever,\" \"and an extract composed [168] of the berries greatly\r\nassists longevity. Indeed,\"--so famous is the story of Neander--\r\n\"this is a catholicum against all infirmities whatever.\" \"The leaves,\r\nthough somewhat rank of smell, are otherwise, as indeed is the\r\nentire shrub, of a very sovereign virtue. The springbuds are\r\nexcellently wholesome in pottage; and small ale, in which Elder\r\nflowers have been infused, are esteemed by many so salubrious,\r\nthat this is to be had in most of the eating houses about our town.\"\r\n\r\n\"It were likewise profitable for the scabby if they made a sallet of\r\nthose young buds, who in the beginning of the spring doe bud\r\nforth together with those outbreakings and pustules of the skin,\r\nwhich by the singular favour of nature is contemporaneous; these\r\nbeing sometimes macerated a little in hot water, together with\r\noyle, salt, and vinegar, and sometimes eaten. It purgeth the belly,\r\nand freeth the blood from salt and serous humours\" (1760).\r\nFurther, \"there be nothing more excellent to ease the pains of the\r\nhaemorrhoids than a fomentation made of the flowers of the Elder\r\nand _Verbusie_, or Honeysuckle, in water or milk, for in a short\r\ntime it easeth the greatest pain.\"\r\n\r\nIf the green leaves are warmed between two hot tiles, and applied\r\nto the forehead, they will promptly relieve nervous headache. In\r\nGermany the Elder is regarded with much respect. From its leaves\r\na fever drink is made; from its berries a sour preserve, and a\r\nwonder-working electuary; whilst the moon-shaped clusters of its\r\naromatic flowers, being somewhat narcotic, are of service in\r\nbaking small cakes.\r\n\r\nThe Romans made use of the black Elder juice as a hair dye. From\r\nthe flowers a fragrant water is now distilled as a perfume; and a\r\ngently stimulating ointment is prepared with lard for dressing\r\nburns and [169] scalds. Another ointment, concocted from the\r\ngreen berries, with camphor and lard, is ordered by the London\r\nCollege as curative of piles. \"The leaves of Elder boiled soft, and\r\nwith a little linseed oil added thereto, if then laid upon a piece of\r\nscarlet or red cloth, and applied to piles as hot as this can be\r\nsuffered, being removed when cold, and replaced by one such\r\ncloth after another upon the diseased part by the space of an hour,\r\nand in the end some bound to the place, and the patient put warm\r\nto bed. This hath not yet failed at the first dressing to cure the\r\ndisease, but if the patient be dressed twice, it must needs cure them\r\nif the first fail.\" The Elder was named _Eldrun_ and _Burtre_ by\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons. It is now called _Bourtree_ in Scotland, from\r\nthe central pith in the younger branches which children bore out so\r\nas to make pop guns:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bour tree--Bour tree: crooked rung,\r\n    Never straight, and never strong;\r\n    Ever bush, and never tree\r\n    Since our Lord was nailed on thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe Elder is specially abundant in Kent around Folkestone. By the\r\nGauls it was called \"Scovies,\" and by the Britons \"Iscaw.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the tree upon which the legend represents Judas as having\r\nhanged himself, or of which the cross was made at the crucifixion.\r\nIn _Pier's Plowman's Vision_ it is said:--\r\n\r\n    \"Judas he japed with Jewen silver,\r\n    And sithen an eller hanged hymselve.\"\r\n\r\nGerard says \"the gelly of the Elder, otherwise called Jew's ear,\r\ntaketh away inflammations of the mouth and throat if they be\r\nwashed therewith, and doth in like Manner help the uvula.\" He\r\nrefers here to a fungus [170] which grows often from the trunk of\r\nthe Elder, and the shape of which resembles the human ear.\r\nAlluding to this fungus, and to the supposed fact that the berries of\r\nthe Elder are poisonous to peacocks, a quaint old rhyme runs\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    \"For the coughe take Judas' eare,\r\n    With the paring of a peare,\r\n    And drynke them without feare\r\n        If you will have remedy.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Three syppes for the hycocke,\r\n    And six more for the chycocke:\r\n    Thus will my pretty pycocke\r\n        Recover bye and bye.\"\r\n\r\nVarious superstitions have attached themselves in England to the\r\nElder bush. The Tree-Mother has been thought to inhabit it; and it\r\nhas been long believed that refuge may be safely taken under an\r\nElder tree in a thunderstorm, because the cross was made\r\ntherefrom, and so the lightning never strikes it. Elder was formerly\r\nburied with a corpse to protect it from witches, and even now at a\r\nfuneral the driver of the hearse commonly has his whip handle\r\nmade of Elder wood. Lord Bacon commended the rubbing of warts\r\nwith a green Elder stick, and then burying the stick to rot in\r\nthe mud. Brand says it is thought in some parts that beating with\r\nan Elder rod will check the growth of boys. A cross made of the\r\nwood if affixed to cow-houses and stables was supposed to protect\r\ncattle from all possible harm.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the order of _Caprifoliaceous_ (with leaves eaten by\r\ngoats) plants, the Elder bush grows to the size of a small tree,\r\nbearing many white flowers in large flat umbels at the ends of the\r\nbranches. It gives off an unpleasant soporific smell, which is said\r\nto prove harmful to those that sleep under its shade. Our summer\r\nis [171] not here until the Elder is fully in flower, and it ends when\r\nthe berries are ripe. When taken together with the berries of Herb\r\nParis (four-leaved Paris) they have been found very useful in\r\nepilepsy. \"Mark by the way,\" says _Anatomie of the Elder_\r\n(1760), \"the berries of Herb Paris, called by some Bear, or Wolfe\r\nGrapes, is held by certain matrons as a great secret against\r\nepilepsie; and they give them ever in an unequal number, as three,\r\nfive, seven, or nine, in the water of Linden tree flowers. Others also\r\ndo hang a cross made of the Elder and Sallow, mutually inwrapping\r\none another, about the children's neck as anti-epileptick.\"\r\n\"I learned the certainty of this experiment (Dr. Blochwich)\r\nfrom a friend in Leipsick, who no sooner erred in diet but\r\nhe was seized on by this disease; yet after he used the Elder\r\nwood as an amulet cut into little pieces, and sewn in a knot against\r\nhim, he was free.\" Sheep suffering from the foot-rot, if able to get\r\nat the bark and young shoots of an Elder tree, will thereby cure\r\nthemselves of this affection. The great Boerhaave always took off\r\nhis hat when passing an Elder bush. Douglas Jerrold once, at a\r\nwell-known tavern, ordered a bottle of port wine, which should be\r\n\"old, but not _Elder_.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Dwarf Elder_ (_Sambucus ebulus_) is quite a different\r\nshrub, which grows not infrequently in hedges and bushy places,\r\nwith a herbaceous stem from two to three feet high. It possesses a\r\nsmell which is less aromatic than that of the true Elder, and it\r\nseldom brings its fruit to ripeness. A rob made therefrom is\r\nactively purgative; one tablespoonful for a dose. The root, which\r\nhas a nauseous bitter taste, was formerly used in dropsies. A\r\ndecoction made from it, as well as from the inner bark, purges, and\r\npromotes free urination.\r\n\r\n[172] The leaves made into a poultice will resolve swellings and\r\nrelieve contusions. The odour of the green leaves will drive away\r\nmice from granaries. To the Dwarf Elder have been given the\r\nnames Danewort, Danesweed, and Danesblood, probably because\r\nit brings about a loss of blood called the \"Danes,\" or perhaps as a\r\ncorruption of its stated use _contra quotidianam_. The plant is also\r\nknown as Walewort, from _wal_--slanghter. It grows in great\r\nplenty about Slaughterford, Wilts, where there was a noted\r\nfight with the Danes; and a patch of it thrives on ground in\r\nWorcestershire, where the first blood was drawn in the civil war\r\nbetween the Parliament and the Royalists. Rumour says it will\r\nonly prosper where blood has been shed either in battle, or in\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECAMPANE.\r\n\r\n\"Elecampane,\" writes William Coles, \"is one of the plants whereof\r\nEngland may boast as much as any, for there grows none better in\r\nthe world than in England, let apothecaries and druggists say what\r\nthey will.\" It is a tall, stout, downy plant, from three to five feet\r\nhigh, of the Composite order, with broad leaves, and bright,\r\nyellow flowers. Campania is the original source of the plant\r\n(_Enula campana_), which is called also Elf-wort, and Elf-dock.\r\nIts botanical title is _Helenium inula_, to commemorate Helen of\r\nTroy, from whose tears the herb was thought to have sprung, or\r\nwhose hands were full of the leaves when Paris carried her off\r\nfrom Menelaus. This title has become corrupted in some districts\r\nto Horse-heal, or Horse-hele, or Horse-heel, through a double,\r\nblunder, the word _inula_ being misunderstood for _hinnula_, a\r\ncolt; and the term _Hellenium_ being thought to have something\r\nto do with healing, or [173] heels; and solely on this account the\r\nElecampane has been employed by farriers to cure horses of scabs\r\nand sore heels. Though found wild only seldom, and as a local\r\nproduction in our copses and meadows, it is cultivated in our\r\ngardens as a medicinal and culinary herb. The name _inula_ is\r\nonly a corruption of the Greek _elenium_; and the herb is of\r\nancient repute, having been described by Dioscorides. An old\r\nLatin distich thus celebrates its virtues: _Enula campana reddit\r\nproecordia sana_--\"Elecampane will the spirits sustain.\" \"Julia\r\nAugusta,\" said Pliny, \"let no day pass without eating some of the\r\nroots of _Enula_ condired, to help digestion, and cause mirth.\"\r\n\r\nThe _inula_ was noticed by Horace, _Satire_ viii., 51:--\r\n\r\n    \"Erucos virides inulas ego primus amaras\r\n    Monstravi incoquere.\"\r\n\r\nAlso the _Enula campana_ has been identified with the herb Moly\r\n(of Homer), \"_apo tou moleuein_, from its mitigating pain.\"\r\n\r\nPrior to the Norman Conquest, and during the Middle Ages, the\r\nroot of Elecampane was much employed in Great Britain as a\r\nmedicine; and likewise it was candied and eaten as a sweetmeat.\r\nSome fifty years ago the candy was sold commonly in London, as\r\nflat, round cakes, being composed largely of sugar, and coloured\r\nwith cochineal. A piece was eaten each night and morning for\r\nasthmatical complaints, whilst it was customary when travelling\r\nby a river to suck a bit of the root against poisonous exhalations\r\nand bad air. The candy may be still had from our confectioners,\r\nbut now containing no more of the plant Elecampane than there is\r\nof barley in barley sugar.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"The flowers of this herb are in all [174] their\r\nbravery during June and July; the roots should be gathered in the\r\nautumn. The plant is good for an old cough, and for such as cannot\r\nbreathe freely unless they hold their necks upright; also it is of\r\ngreat value when given in a loch, which is a medicine to be licked\r\non. It voids out thick clammy humors, which stick in the chest and\r\nlungs.\" Galen says further: \"It is good for passions of the\r\nhuckle-bones, called sciatica.\" The root is thick and substantial,\r\nhaving, when sliced, a fragrant aromatic odour.\r\n\r\nChemically, it contains a crystalline principle, resembling\r\ncamphor, and called \"helenin\"; also a starch, named \"inulin,\"\r\nwhich is peculiar as not being soluble in water, alcohol, or ether;\r\nand conjointly a volatile oil, a resin, albumen, and acetic acid.\r\nInulin is allied to starch, and its crystallized camphor is separable\r\ninto true helenin, and alantin camphor. The former is a powerful\r\nantiseptic to arrest putrefaction. In Spain it is much used as a\r\nsurgical dressing, and is said to be more destructive than any other\r\nagent to the bacillus of cholera. Helenin is very useful in\r\nulceration within the nose (_ozoena_), and in chronic bronchitis to\r\nlessen the expectoration. The dose is from a third of a grain to two\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Elecampane counteracts the acidity of gouty\r\nindigestion, and regulates the monthly illnesses of women. The\r\nFrench use it in the distillation of absinthe, and term it _l'aulnee,\r\nd'un lieu plante d'aulnes ou elle se plait_. To make a decoction,\r\nhalf-an-ounce of the root should be gently boiled for ten minutes\r\nin a pint of water, and then allowed to cool. From one to two\r\nounces of this may be taken three times in the day. Of the\r\npowdered root, from half to one teaspoonful may be given for a\r\ndose.\r\n\r\n[175] A medicinal tincture (H.) is prepared from the root, of\r\nwhich thirty or forty drops may be taken for a dose, with two\r\ntablespoonfuls of cold water; but too large a dose will induce\r\nsickness. Elecampane is specifically curative of a sharp pain\r\naffecting the right elbow joint, and recurring daily; also of a\r\ncongestive headache coming on through costiveness of the lowest\r\nbowel. Moreover, at the present time, when there is so much talk\r\nabout the inoculative treatment of pulmonary consumption by the\r\ncultivated virus of its special microbe, it is highly interesting to\r\nknow that the helenin of Elecampane is said to be peculiarly\r\ndestructive to the bacillus of tubercular disease.\r\n\r\nIn classic times the poet Horace told how Fundanius first taught\r\nthe making of a delicate sauce, by boiling in it the bitter _Inula_\r\n(Elecampane); and how the Roman stomach, when surfeited with\r\nan excess of rich viands, pined for turnips, and the appetising\r\n_Enulas acidas_ from frugal Campania:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quum rapula plenus\r\n    Atque acidas mavult inulas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEYEBRIGHT.\r\n\r\nFound in abundance in summer time on our heaths, and on mountains\r\nnear the sea, this delicate little plant, the _Euphrasia\r\nofficinalis_, has been famous from earliest times for restoring and\r\npreserving the eyesight. The Greeks named the herb originally\r\nfrom the linnet, which first made use of the leaf for clearing its\r\nvision, and which passed on the knowledge to mankind. The\r\nGreek word, _euphrosunee_, signifies joy and gladness. The elegant\r\nlittle herb grows from two to six inches high, with deeply-cut\r\nleaves, and numerous white or [176] purplish tiny flowers\r\nvariegated with yellow; being partially a parasite, and preying on\r\nthe roots of other plants. It belongs to the order of scrofula-curing\r\nplants; and, as proved by positive experiment (H.), the Eyebright\r\nhas been recently found to possess a distinct sphere of curative\r\noperation, within which it manifests virtues which are as\r\nunvarying as they are truly potential. It acts specifically on the\r\nmucous lining of the eyes and nose, and the uppermost throat to\r\nthe top of the windpipe, causing, when given so largely as to be\r\ninjurious, a profuse secretion from these parts; and, if given of\r\nreduced strength, it cures the same troublesome symptoms when\r\ndue to catarrh.\r\n\r\nAn attack of cold in the head, with copious running from the eyes\r\nand nose, may be aborted straightway by giving a dose of the\r\ninfusion (made with an ounce of the herb to a pint of boiling\r\nwater) every two hours; as, likewise, for hay fever. A medicinal\r\ntincture (H.) is prepared from the whole plant with spirit of wine,\r\nof which an admirably useful lotion may be made together with\r\nrose water for simple inflammation of the eyes, with a bloodshot\r\ncondition of their outer coats. Thirty drops of the tincture should\r\nbe mixed with a wineglassful of rosewater for making this lotion,\r\nwhich may be used several times in the day.\r\n\r\nWhat precise chemical constituents occur in the Eyebright beyond\r\ntannin, mannite, and glucose, are not yet recorded. In Iceland its\r\nexpressed juice is put into requisition for most ailments of the\r\neyes. Likewise, in Scotland, the Highlanders infuse the herb in\r\nmilk, and employ this for bathing weak, or inflamed eyes. In\r\nFrance, the plant is named _Casse lunettes_; and in Germany,\r\n_Augen trost_, or, consolation of the eye.\r\n\r\n[177] Surely the same little herb must have been growing freely in\r\nthe hedge made famous by ancient nursery tradition:--\r\n\r\n    \"Thessalus acer erat sapiens proe civibus unus\r\n    Qui medium insiluit spinets per horrida sepem.\r\n    Effoditque oculos sibi crudelissimus ambos.\r\n    Cum vero effosos orbes sine lumine vidit\r\n    Viribus enisum totis illum altera sepes\r\n    Accipit, et raptos oculos cito reddit egenti.\"\r\n\r\n    \"There was a man of Thessuly, and he was wondrous wise;\r\n    He jumped into a quick set hedge, and scratched out both his eyes;\r\n    Then, when he found his eyes were out, with all his might and main\r\n    He jumped into the quick set hedge, and scratched them in again.\"\r\n\r\nOld herbals pronounced it \"cephalic, ophthalmic, and good for a\r\nweak memory.\" Hildamus relates that it restored the sight of many\r\npersons at the age of seventy or eighty years. \"Eyebright made into\r\na powder, and then into an electuary with sugar, hath,\" says\r\nCulpeper, \"powerful effect to help and to restore the sight decayed\r\nthrough years; and if the herb were but as much used as it is\r\nneglected, it would have spoilt the trade of the maker.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it is probable that the Eyebright will succeed best for\r\neyes weakened by long-continued straining, and for those which\r\nare dim and watery from old age. Shenstone declared, \"Famed\r\nEuphrasy may not be left unsung, which grants dim eyes to\r\nwander leagues around\"; and Milton has told us in _Paradise\r\nLost_, Book XI:--\r\n\r\n    \"To nobler sights\r\n    Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed,\r\n    Then purged with _Euphrasy_ and rue\r\n    The visual nerve, for he had much to see.\"\r\n\r\n[178] The Arabians I mew the herb Eyebright under the name\r\n_Adhil_, It now makes an ingredient in British herbal tobacco,\r\nwhich is smoked most usefully for chronic bronchial colds.\r\nSome sceptics do not hesitate to say that the Eyebright owes its\r\nreputation solely to the fact that the tiny flower bears in its centre\r\na yellow spot, which is darker towards the middle, and gives a close\r\nresemblance to the human eye; wherefore, on the doctrine of\r\nsignatures, it was pronounced curative of ocular derangements. The\r\npresent Poet Laureate speaks of the herb as:--\r\n\r\n                 \"The Eyebright this.\r\n     Whereof when steeped in wine I now must eat\r\n     Because it strengthens mindfulness.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmother Cooper, a gipsy of note for skill in healing, practised\r\nthe cure of inflamed and scrofulous eyes, by anointing them with\r\nclay, rubbed up with her spittle, which proved highly successful.\r\nOutside was applied a piece of rag kept wet with water in which a\r\ncabbage had been boiled. As confirmatory of this cure, we read\r\nreverently in the _Gospel of St. John_ about the man \"which was\r\nblind from his birth,\" and for whose restoration to sight our Saviour\r\n\"spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the\r\neyes of the blind man with the clay.\" More than one eminent oculist\r\nhas similarly advised that weak, ailing eyes should be daily wetted\r\non waking with the fasting saliva. And it is well known that\r\n\"mothers' marks\" of a superficial character, but even of a\r\nconsiderable size, become dissipated by a daily licking with the\r\nmother's tongue. Old Mizaldus taught that \"the fasting spittle of a\r\nwhole and sound person both quite taketh away all scurviness, or\r\nredness of the face, ringworms, tetters, and all kinds [179] of\r\npustules, by smearing or rubbing the infected place therewith; and\r\nlikewise it clean puts away thereby all painful swelling by the\r\nmeans of any venomous thing as hornets, spiders, toads, and such\r\nlike.\" Healthy saliva is slightly alkaline, and contains sulphocyanate\r\nof potassium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFENNEL.\r\n\r\nWe all know the pleasant taste of Fennel sauce when eaten with\r\nboiled mackerel. This culinary condiment is made with Sweet\r\nFennel, cultivated in our kitchen gardens, and which is a variety of\r\nthe wild Fennel growing commonly in England as the Finkel,\r\nespecially in Cornwall and Devon, on chalky cliffs near the sea. It is\r\nthen an aromatic plant of the umbelliferous order, but differing from\r\nthe rest of its tribe in producing bright yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nBotanically, it is the _Anethum foeniculum_, or \"small fragrant\r\nhay\" of the Romans, and the _Marathron_ of the Greeks. The whole\r\nplant has a warm carminative taste, and the old Greeks esteemed it\r\nhighly for promoting the secretion of milk in nursing mothers.\r\nMacer alleged that the use of Fennel was first taught to man by\r\nserpents. His classical lines on the subject when translated run\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n     \"By eating herb of Fennel, for the eyes\r\n     A cure for blindness had the serpent wise;\r\n     Man tried the plant; and, trusting that his sight\r\n     Might thus be healed, rejoiced to find him right.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Hac mansa serpens oculos caligine purgat;\r\n     Indeque compertum est humanis posse mederi\r\n     Illum hominibus: atque experiendo probatum est.\"\r\n\r\nPliny also asserts that the ophidia, when they cast their skins, have\r\nrecourse to this plant for restoring their [180] sight. Others have\r\naverred that serpents wax young again by eating of the herb;\r\n\"Wherefore the use of it is very meet for aged folk.\"\r\n\r\nFennel powder may be employed for making an eyewash: half-a-teaspoonful\r\ninfused in a wineglassful of cold water, and decanted when\r\nclear. A former physician to the Emperor of Germany saw a\r\nmonk cured by his tutor in nine days of a cataract by only applying\r\nthe roots of Fennel with the decoction to his eyes.\r\n\r\nIn the Elizabethan age the herb was quoted as an emblem of flattery;\r\nand Lily wrote, \"Little things catch light minds; and fancie is a\r\nworm that feedeth first upon Fennel.\" Again, Milton says, in\r\n_Paradise Lost_, Book XI:--\r\n\r\n                 \"The savoury odour blown,\r\n     Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense\r\n     Than smell of sweetest Fennel.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare makes the sister of Laertes say to the King, in\r\n_Hamlet_, when wishing to prick the royal conscience, \"There's\r\nFennel for you.\" And Falstaff commends Poins thus, in _Henry the\r\nFourth_, \"He plays at quoits well, and eats conger, and Fennel.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italians take blanched stalks of the cultivated Fennel (which\r\nthey call _Cartucci_) as a salad; and in Germany its seeds are added\r\nto bread as a condiment, much as we put caraways in some of our\r\ncakes. The leaves are eaten raw with pickled fish to correct its oily\r\nindigestibility. Evelyn says the peeled stalks, soft and white, when\r\n\"dressed like salery,\" exercise a pleasant action conducive to sleep.\r\nRoman bakers put the herb under their loaves in the oven to make\r\nthe bread taste agreeably.\r\n\r\nChemically, the cultivated Fennel plant furnishes a volatile aromatic\r\noil, a fixed fatty principle, sugar, and some [181] in the root; also a\r\nbitter resinous extract. It is an admirable corrective of flatulence;\r\nand yields an essential oil, of which from two to four drops taken on\r\na lump of sugar will promptly relieve griping of the bowels with\r\ndistension. Likewise a hot infusion, made by pouring half-a-pint of\r\nboiling water on a teaspoonful of the bruised seeds will comfort\r\nbelly ache in the infant, if given in teaspoonful doses sweetened\r\nwith sugar, and will prove an active remedy in promoting female\r\nmonthly regularity, if taken at the periodical times, in doses of a\r\nwineglassful three times in the day. Gerard says, \"The green leaves\r\nof the Fennel eaten, or the seed made into a ptisan, and drunk, do fill\r\nwomen's brestes with milk; also the seed if drunk asswageath the\r\nwambling of the stomacke, and breaketh the winde.\" The essential\r\noil corresponds in composition to that of anise, but contains a\r\nspecial camphoraceous body of its own; whilst its vapour will cause\r\nthe tears and the saliva to flow. A syrup prepared from the\r\nexpressed juice was formerly given for chronic coughs.\r\n\r\nW. Coles teaches in _Nature's Paradise_, that \"both the leaves,\r\nseeds, and roots, are much used in drinks and broths for those that\r\nare grown fat, to abate their unwieldinesse, and make them more\r\ngaunt and lank.\" The ancient Greek name of the herb, _Marathron_,\r\nfrom _maraino_, to grow thin, probably embodied the same notion.\r\n\"In warm climates,\" said Matthiolus, \"the stems are cut, and there\r\nexudes a resinous liquid, which is collected under the name of\r\nfennel gum.\"\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh _Pharmacopoeia_ orders \"Sweet Fennel seeds,\r\ncombined with juniper berries and caraway seeds, for making with\r\nspirit of wine, the 'compound spirit of juniper,' which is noted for\r\npromoting a copious flow of urine in dropsy.\" The bruised plant, if\r\napplied [182] externally, will speedily relieve toothache or earache.\r\nThis likewise proves of service as a poultice to resolve chronic\r\nswellings. Powdered Fennel is an ingredient in the modern laxative\r\n\"compound liquorice powder\" with senna. The flower, surrounded\r\nby its four leaves, is called in the South of England, \"Devil in a\r\nbush.\" An old proverb of ours, which is still believed in New\r\nEngland, says, that \"Sowing Fennel is sowing sorrow.\" A modern\r\ndistilled water is now obtained from the cultivated plant, and\r\ndispensed by the druggist. The whole herb has been supposed to\r\nconfer longevity, strength and courage. Longfellow wrote a poem\r\nabout it to this effect.\r\n\r\nThe fine-leaved Hemlock Water Dropwort (_Oenanthe Phellandrium_),\r\nis the Water Fennel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERNS.\r\n\r\nOnly some few of our native Ferns are known to possess medicinal\r\nvirtues, though they may all be happily pronounced devoid of\r\npoisonous or deleterious properties. As curative simples, a brief\r\nconsideration will be given here to the common male and female\r\nFerns, the Royal Fern, the Hart's Tongue, the Maidenhair, the\r\ncommon Polypody, the Spleenwort, and the Wall Rue. Generically,\r\nthe term \"fern\" has been referred to the word \"feather,\" because of\r\nthe pinnate leaves, or to _farr_, a bullock, from the use of the plants\r\nas litter for cattle. Ferns are termed _Filices_, from the Latin word\r\n_filum_, a thread, because of their filamentary fronds. Each of those\r\nnow particularized owes its respective usefulness chiefly to its\r\ntannin; while the few more specially endowed with healing powers\r\nyield also a peculiar chemical acid \"filicic,\" which is fatal to worms.\r\nIn an old charter, A.D. 855, the [183] right of pasturage on the\r\ncommon Ferns was called \"fearnleswe,\" or _Pascua procorum_, the\r\npasturage of swine (from _fearrh_, a pig). Matthiolus when writing\r\nof the ferns, male and female, says, _Utriusque radice sues\r\npinguescunt_. In some parts of England Ferns at large are known as\r\n\"Devil's brushes\"; and to bite off close to the ground the first Fern\r\nwhich appears in the Spring, is said, in Cornwall, to cure toothache,\r\nand to prevent its return during the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nThe common Male Fern (_Filix mas_) or Shield Fern, grows\r\nabundantly in all parts of Great Britain, and has been known from\r\nthe times of Theophrastus and Dioscorides, as a specific remedy for\r\nintestinal worms, particularly the tape worm. For medicinal\r\npurposes, the green part of the rhizome is kept and dried; this is then\r\npowdered, and its oleo-resin is extracted by ether. The green fixed\r\noil thus obtained; which is poisonous to worms, consists of the\r\nglycerides of filocylic and filosmylic acids, with tannin, starch,\r\ngum, and sugar. The English oil of Male Fern is more reliable than\r\nthat which is imported from the Continent. Twenty drops made into\r\nan emulsion with mucilage should be given every half-hour on an\r\nempty stomach, until sixty or eighty drops have been taken. It is\r\nimprudent to administer the full quantity in a single dose. The\r\ntreatment should be thus pursued when the vigour of the parasite has\r\nbeen first reduced by a low diet for a couple of days, and is lying\r\nwithin the intestines free from alimentary matter; a purgative being\r\nsaid to assist the action of the plant, though it is, independently,\r\nquite efficacious. The knowledge of this remedy had become lost,\r\nuntil it was repurchased for fifteen thousand francs, in 1775, by the\r\nFrench king, under the advice of his principal physicians, from\r\nMadame Nouffer, [184] a surgeon's widow in Switzerland, who\r\nemployed it as a secret mode of cure with infallible success. Her\r\nmethod consisted in giving from one to three drams of the powdered\r\nroot, after using a clyster, and following the dose up with a purge of\r\nscammony and calomel. The rhizome should not be used medicinally\r\nif more than a year old. A medicinal tincture (H.) is now\r\nprepared from the root-stock with proof spirit, in the autumn\r\nwhen the fronds are dying.\r\n\r\nThe young shoots and curled leaves of the Male Fern, which is\r\ndistinguished by having one main rib, are sometimes eaten like\r\nasparagus; whilst the fronds make an excellent litter for horses and\r\ncattle. The seed of this and some other species of Fern is so minute\r\n(one frond producing more than a million) as not to be visible to the\r\nnaked eye. Hence, on the doctrine of signatures, the plant--like the\r\nring of Gyges, found in a brazen horse--has been thought to confer\r\ninvisibility. Thus Shakespeare says, _Henry IV_., Act II., Scene 1,\r\n\"We have the receipt of Fern seed; we walk invisible.\"\r\n\r\nBracken or Brakes, which grows more freely than any other of the\r\nFern tribe throughout England, is the _Filix foemina_, or common\r\nFemale Fern. The fronds of this are branched, whilst the male plant\r\nhaving only one main rib, is more powerful as an astringent, and\r\nantiseptic; \"the powder thereof freely beaten healeth the galled\r\nnecks of oxen and other cattell.\" Bracken is also named botanically,\r\n_Pteris aquilina_, because the figure which appears in its succulent\r\nstem when cut obliquely across at the base, has been thought to\r\nresemble a spread eagle; and, therefore, Linnaeus termed the Fern\r\n_Aquilina_. Some call it, for the same reason, \"King Charles in the\r\noak tree\"; and in Scotland the symbol is said to be an impression of\r\nthe Devil's foot. [185] Again, witches are reputed to detest this Fern,\r\nsince it bears on its cut root the Greek letter X, which is the initial\r\nof _Christos_.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland it is called the Fern of God, because of the belief that if\r\nthe stem be cut into three sections, on the first of these will be seen\r\nthe letter G; on the second O; and on the third D.\r\n\r\nAn old popular proverb says about this Bracken:--\r\n\r\n     \"When the Fern is as high as a spoon\r\n     You may sleep an hour at noon,\r\n     When the Fern is as high as a ladle\r\n     You may sleep as long as you're able,\r\n     When the Fern is looking red\r\n     Milk is good with faire brown bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bracken grows almost exclusively on waste places and\r\nuncultivated ground; or, as Horace testified in Roman days,\r\n_Neglectis urenda filix innascitur agris_. It contains much potash;\r\nand its ashes were formerly employed in the manufacture of soap.\r\nThe young tops of the plant are boiled in Hampshire for hogs' food,\r\nand the peculiar flavour of Hampshire bacon has been attributed to\r\nthis custom. The root affords much starch, and is used medicinally.\r\n\"For thigh aches\" [sciatica], says an old writer, \"smoke the legs\r\nthoroughly with Fern braken.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Seventeenth Century it was customary to set growing\r\nBrakes on fire with the belief that this would produce rain. A like\r\ncustom of \"firing the Bracken\" still prevails to-day on the\r\nDevonshire moors. By an official letter the Earl of Pembroke\r\nadmonished the High Sheriff of Stafford to forbear the burning of\r\nFerns during a visit of Charles I., as \"His Majesty desired that the\r\ncountry and himself may enjoy fair weather as long as he should\r\nremain in those parts.\"\r\n\r\nIn northern climates a coarse kind of bread is made [186] from the\r\nroots of the Brake Fern; whilst in the south the young shoots are\r\noften sold in bundles as a salad. (Some writers give the name of\r\nLady Fern, not to the Bracken, but to the _Asplenium filix\r\nfoemina_, because of its delicate and graceful foliage.) The Bracken\r\nhas branched riblets, and is more viscid, mucilaginous, and diuretic,\r\nthan the Male Fern.\r\n\r\nIts ashes when burnt contain much vegetable alkali which has been\r\nused freely in making glass.\r\n\r\nIt was customary to \"watch the Fern\" on Midsummer eve, when the\r\nplant put forth at dusk a blue flower, and a wonderful seed at\r\nmidnight, which was carefully collected, and known as \"wish seed.\"\r\nThis gave the power to discover hidden treasures, whilst to drink the\r\nsap conferred perpetual youth.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Fern (_Osmunda regalis_), grows abundantly in many\r\nparts of Great Britain, and is the stateliest of Ferns in its favourite\r\nwatery haunts. It heeds a soil of bog earth, and is incorrectly styled\r\n\"the flowering Fern,\" from its handsome spikes of fructification.\r\nOne of its old English names is \"Osmund, the Waterman\"; and the\r\nwhite centre of its root has been called the heart of Osmund. This\r\nmiddle part boiled in some kind of liquor was supposed good for\r\npersons wounded, dry-beaten, and bruised, or that have fallen from\r\nsome high place. The name \"Osmund\" is thought to be derived from\r\n_os_, the mouth, or _os_, bone, and _mundare_, to cleanse, or from\r\n_gross mond kraut_, the Greater Moonwort; but others refer it to\r\nSaint Osmund wading a river, whilst bearing the Christ on his\r\nshoulders. The root or rhizome has a mucilaginous slightly bitter\r\ntaste. The tender sprigs of the plant at their first coming are \"good\r\nto be put into balmes, oyles, and healing plasters.\" Dodonoeus says,\r\n\"the harte of the root of [187] Osmonde is good against squattes,\r\nand bruises, heavie and grievous falles, and whatever hurte or\r\ndislocation soever it be.\" \"A conserve of these buds,\" said Dr. Short\r\nof Sheffield, 1746, \"is a specific in the rickets; and the roots\r\nstamped in water or gin till the liquor becometh a stiff mucilage, has\r\ncured many most deplorable pains of the back, that have confined\r\nthe distracted sufferers close to bed for several weeks.\" This\r\nmucilage was to be rubbed over the vertebrae of the back each night\r\nand morning for five or six days together. Also for rickets, \"take of\r\nthe powdered roots with the whitest sugar, and sprinkle some\r\nthereof on the child's pap, and on all his liquid foods.\" \"It maketh a\r\nnoble remedy,\" said Dr. Bowles, \"without any other medicine.\" The\r\nactual curative virtues of this Fern are most probably due to the salts\r\nof lime, potash, and other earths, which it derives in solution from\r\nthe bog soil, and from the water in which it grows. On July 25th it is\r\nspecially dedicated to St. Christopher, its patron saint.\r\n\r\nThe Hart's Tongue or Hind's Tongue, is a Fern of common English\r\ngrowth in shady copses on moist banks, it being the _Lingua cervina_\r\nof the apothecaries, and its name expressing the shape of its fronds.\r\nThis, the _Scolopendrium vulgare_, is also named \"Button-hole,\"\r\n\"Horse tongue;\" and in the Channel Islands \"Godshair.\" The older\r\nphysicians esteemed it as a very valuable medicine; and Galen gave\r\nit for diarrhoea or dysentery. By reason of its tannin it will restrain\r\nbleedings, \"being commended,\" says Gerard, \"against the bloody\r\nflux.\" People in rural districts make an ointment from its leaves for\r\nburns and scalds. It was formerly, in company with the common\r\nMaidenhair Fern, one of the five great capillary herbs. Dr. Tuthill\r\nMassy advises the drinking, in Bright's disease, of as much as three\r\n[188] half-pints daily of an infusion of this Fern, whilst always\r\ntaking care to gather the young shoots. Also, in combination (H.)\r\nwith the American Golden Seal (_Hydrastis canadensis_). the Hart's\r\nTongue has served in not a few authenticated cases to arrest the\r\nprogress of that formidable disease, diabetes mellitus. Its distilled\r\nwater will quiet any palpitations of the heart, and will stay the\r\nhiccough; it will likewise help the falling of the palate (relaxed\r\nthroat), or stop bleeding of the gums if the mouth be gargled\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Ophioglossum vulgatum_, \"'Adder's tongue,' or 'Christ's\r\nSpear,' when boiled in olive oil is produced a most excellent greene\r\noyle. Or rather a balsam for greene wounds, comparable to oyle of\r\nSt. John's Wort; if it doth not far surpasse it.\" A preparation from\r\nthis plant known as the \"green oil of charity,\" is still in request as\r\na vulnerary, and remedy for wounds.\r\n\r\nThe true Maidenhair Fern (_Adiantum capillus veneris_), of\r\nexquisite foliage, and of a dark crimson colour, is a stranger in\r\nEngland, except in the West country. But we have in greater\r\nabundance the common Maidenhair (_Asplenium trichomanes_),\r\nwhich grows on old walls, and which will act as a laxative\r\nmedicine; whilst idiots are said to have taken it remedially, so as to\r\nrecover their senses. The true Maidenhair is named _Adiantum_,\r\nfrom the Greek: _Quod denso imbre cadente destillans foliis tenuis\r\nnon insidet humor_, \"Because the leaves are not wetted even by a\r\nheavily falling shower of rain.\" \"In vain,\" saith Pliny, \"do you plunge\r\nthe Adiantum into water, it always remains dry.\" This veracious\r\nplant doth \"strengthen and embellish the hair.\" It, occurs but rarely\r\nwith us; on damp rocks, and walls near the sea. The Maidenhair is\r\ncalled _Polytrichon_ because it brings forth a multitude of hairs;\r\n[189] _Calitrichon_ because it produces black and faire hair;\r\n_Capillus veneris_ because it fosters grace and love.\r\n\r\nFrom its fine hairlike stems, and perhaps from its attributed virtues\r\nin toilet use, this Fern has acquired the name of \"Our Lady's Hair\"\r\nand \"Maria's Fern.\" \"The true Maidenhair,\" says Gerard, \"maketh\r\nthe hair of the head and beard to grow that is fallen and pulled off.\"\r\nFrom this graceful Fern a famous elegant syrup is made in France\r\ncalled _Capillaire_; which is given as a favourite medicine in\r\npulmonary catarrh. It is flavoured with orange flowers, and acts as a\r\ndemulcent with slightly stimulating effects. One part of the plant is\r\ngently boiled with ten parts of water, and with nineteen parts of\r\nwhite sugar. Dr. Johnson says Boswell used to put _Capillaire_ into\r\nhis port wine. Sir John Hill instructed us that (as we cannot get the\r\ntrue Maidenhair fresh in England) the fine syrup made in France\r\nfrom their Fern in perfection, concocted with pure Narbonne honey,\r\nis not by any means to be thought a trifle, because barley water,\r\nsweetened with this, is one of the very best remedies for a violent\r\ncold. But a tea brewed from our more common Maidenhair will\r\nanswer the same purpose for tedious coughs. Its leaves are sweet,\r\nmucilaginous, and expectorant, being, therefore, highly useful in\r\nmany pulmonary disorders.\r\n\r\nThe common Polypody Fern, or \"rheum-purging Polypody\" grows plentifully\r\nin this country on old walls and stumps of trees, in shady places.\r\nIn Hampshire it is called \"Adder's Tongue,\" as derived from the\r\nword _attor_, poison; also Wall-fern, and formerly in Anglo-Saxon\r\nEver-fern, or Boar-fern. In Germany it is said to have sprung\r\nfrom the Virgin's milk, and is named _Marie bregue_. The fresh root\r\nhas been used successfully in decoction, or powdered, for\r\nmelancholia; [190] also of late for general rheumatic swelling of the\r\njoints. By the ancients it was employed as a purgative. Six drachms\r\nby weight of the root should be infused for two hours in a pint of\r\nboiling water, and given in two doses. This is the Oak Fern of the\r\nherbalists; not that of modern botanists (_Polypodium dryopteris_);\r\nit being held that such Fern plants as grew upon the roots of an oak\r\ntree were of special medicinal powers, _Quod nascit super radices\r\nquercus est efficacius_. The true Oak Fern (_Dryopteris_) grows\r\nchiefly in mountainous districts among the mossy roots of old oak\r\ntrees, and sometimes in marshy places. If its root is bruised and\r\napplied to the skin of any hairy part, whilst the person is sweating,\r\nthis will cause the hair to come away. Dioscorides said, \"The root of\r\nPolypody is very good for chaps between the fingers.\" \"It serveth,\"\r\nwrites Gerard, \"to make the belly soluble, being boiled in the broth\r\nof an old cock, with beets or mallows, or other like things, that\r\nmove to the stool by their slipperiness.\" Parkinson says: \"A dram or\r\ntwo, it need be, of the powdered dry roots taken fasting, in a cupful\r\nof honeyed water, worketh gently as a purge, being a safe medicine,\r\nfit for all persons and seasons, which daily experience confirmeth.\"\r\n\"Applied also to the nose it cureth the disease called polypus, which\r\nby time and sufferance stoppeth the nostrils.\" The leaves of the\r\nPolypody when burnt furnish a large proportion of carbonate of\r\nPotash.\r\n\r\nThe Spleenwort (_Asplenium ceterach_--an Arabian term), or Scaly\r\nFern, or Finger Fern, grows on old walls, and in the clefts of moist\r\nrocks. It is also called \"Miltwaste,\" because supposed to cure\r\ndisorders of the milt, or spleen:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Finger Fern, which being given to swine,\r\n     It makes their milt to melt away in fine.\"\r\n\r\n[191] Very probably this reputed virtue has mainly become attributed\r\nto the plant, because the lobular milt-like shape of its leaf\r\nresembles the form of the spleen. \"No herbe maie be compared\r\ntherewith,\" says one of the oldest Herbals, \"for his singular virtue to\r\nhelp the sicknesse or grief of the splene.\" Pliny ordered: \"It should\r\nnot be given to women, because it bringeth barrenness.\" Vitruvius\r\nalleged that in Crete the flocks and herds were found to be without\r\nspleens, because they browsed on this fern. The plant was supposed\r\nwhen given medicinally to diminish the size of the enlarged spleen\r\nor \"ague-cake.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wall Rue (_Ruta muraria_) is a white Maidenhair Fern, and is\r\nnamed by some _Salvia vitoe_. It is a small herb, somewhat nearly\r\nof the colour of Garden Rue, and is likewise good for them that\r\nhave a cough, or are shortwinded, or be troubled with stitches in the\r\nsides. It stayeth the falling or shedding of the hair, and causeth them\r\nto grow thick, fair, and well coloured. This plant is held by those of\r\njudgment and experience, to be as effectual a capillary herb as any\r\nwhatever. Also, it helpeth ruptures in children. Matthiolus \"hath\r\nknown of divers holpen therein by taking the powder of the herb in\r\ndrink for forty days together.\" Its leaves are like those of Rue, and\r\nthe Fern has been called Tentwort from its use as a specific or\r\nsovereign remedy for the cure of rickets, a disease once known as\r\n\"the taint.\"\r\n\r\nThe generic appellations of the several species of Ferns are derived\r\nthus: _Aspidium_, from _aspis_, a shield, because the spores are\r\nenclosed in bosses; _Pteris_, from _pteerux_, a wing, having doubly\r\npinnate fronds; or from _pteron_, a feather, having feathery fronds;\r\n_Scolopendrium_, because the fructification is supposed to\r\nresemble the feet of _Scoltpendra_, a genus of mydrapods; and\r\n_Polypody_, many footed, by reason of the pectinate fronds.\r\n\r\n[192] There grows in Tartary a singular polypody Fern, of which the\r\nhairy foot is easily made to simulate in form a small sheep. It rises\r\nabove the ground with excrescences resembling a head and tail,\r\nwhilst having four leg-like fronds. Fabulous stories are told about\r\nthis remarkable Fern root; and in China its hairy down is so highly\r\nvalued as a styptic for fresh bleeding cuts and wounds, that few\r\nfamilies will be without it. Dr. Darwin, in his _Loves of the Plants_,\r\nsays about this curious natural production, the _Polypodium\r\nBarometz_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cradled in snow, and fanned by Arctic air\r\n    Shines, gentle Barometz, thy golden hair;\r\n    Rooted in earth each cloven hoof descends,\r\n    And found and round her flexile neck she bends:\r\n    Crops the green coral moss, and hoary thyme,\r\n    Or laps with rosy tongue the melting rime;\r\n    Eyes with mute tenderness her distant dam,\r\n    Or seems to bleat--a vegetable Lamb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVERFEW.\r\n\r\nThe Feverfew is one of the wild Chamomiles (_Pyrethrum Parthenium_),\r\nor _Matricaria_, so called because especially useful for\r\nmotherhood. Its botanical names come from the Latin _febrifugus_,\r\nputting fever to flight, and _parthenos_, a virgin. The herb\r\nis a Composite plant, and grows in every hedgerow, with numerous\r\nsmall heads of yellow flowers, having outermost white rays,\r\nbut with an upright stem; whereas that of the true garden\r\nChamomile is procumbent. The whole plant has a pungent odour,\r\nand is particularly disliked by bees. A double variety is cultivated\r\nin gardens for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe herb Feverfew is strengthening to the stomach, preventing\r\nhysteria and promoting the monthly functions of women. It is much\r\nused by country mediciners, though insufficiently esteemed by the\r\ndoctors of to-day.\r\n\r\n[193] In Devonshire the plant is known as \"Bachelor's buttons,\" and\r\nat Torquay as \"Flirtwort,\" being also sometimes spoken of as\r\n\"Feathyfew,\" or \"Featherfull.\"\r\n\r\nGerard says it may be used both in drinks, and bound on the wrists,\r\nas of singular virtue against the ague.\r\n\r\nAs \"Feverfue,\" it was ordered, by the Magi of old, \"to be pulled\r\nfrom the ground with the left hand, and the fevered patient's name\r\nmust be spoken forth, and the herbarist must not look behind him.\"\r\nCountry persons have long been accustomed to make curative uses\r\nof this herb very commonly, which grows abundantly throughout\r\nEngland. Its leaves are feathery and of a delicate green colour, being\r\nconspicuous even in mid-winter. Chemically, the Feverfew\r\nfurnishes a blue volatile oil; containing a camphoraceous stearopten,\r\nand a liquid hydrocarbon, together with some tannin, and a bitter\r\nmucilage.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil is medicinally useful for correcting female\r\nirregularities, as well as for obviating cold indigestion. The herb is\r\nalso known as \"Maydeweed,\" because useful against hysterical\r\ndistempers, to which young women are subject. Taken generally it\r\nis a positive tonic to the digestive and nervous systems. Out\r\nchemists make a medicinal tincture of Feverfew, the dose of which\r\nis from ten to twenty drops, with a spoonful of water, three times a\r\nday. This tincture, if dabbed oil the parts with a small sponge, will\r\nimmediately relieve the pain and swelling caused by bites of insects\r\nor vermin. In the official guide to Switzerland directions are given\r\nto take \"a little powder of the plant called _Pyrethrum roseum_ and\r\nmake it into a paste with a few drops of spirit, then apply this to the\r\nhands and face, or any exposed part of the body, and let it [194] dry:\r\nno mosquito or fly will then touch you.\" Or if two teaspoonfuls of\r\nthe tincture are mixed with half a pint of cold water, and if all parts\r\nof the body likely to be exposed to the bites of insects are freely\r\nsponged therewith they will remain unassailed. Feverfew is\r\nmanifestly the progenitor of the true Chamomilla (_Anthemis\r\nnobilis_), from which the highly useful Camomile \"blows,\" so\r\ncommonly employed in domestic medicine, are obtained, and its\r\nflowers, when dried, may be applied to the same purposes. An\r\ninfusion of them made with boiling water and allowed to become\r\ncold, will allay any distressing sensitiveness to pain in a highly\r\nnervous subject, and will afford relief to the faceache or earache of a\r\ndyspeptic or rheumatic person. This Feverfew (_Chrysanthemum\r\nparthenium_), is best calculated to pacify those who are liable to\r\nsudden, spiteful, rude irascibility, of which they are conscious, but\r\nsay they cannot help it, and to soothe fretful children. \"Better is a\r\ndinner or such herbs, where love is; than a stalled ox, and hatred\r\ntherewith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGS.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the Prophet 'Figs'\" was the pompous utterance\r\nascribed to Dr. Johnson, whose solemn magniloquent style was\r\nsimulated as Eastern cant applied to common business in _Rejected\r\nAddresses_, by the clever humorists, Horace and James Smith,\r\n1812. The tree which produces this fruit belongs to the history of\r\nmankind. In Paradise Adam partook of figs, and covered his\r\nnakedness with the leaves.\r\n\r\nThough indigenous to Western Asia, Figs have been cultivated in\r\nmost countries from a remote period, and will ripen in England\r\nduring a warm summer if screened from north-east winds. The fig\r\ntree flourishes best with [195] us on our sea coasts, bathed by the\r\nEnglish Channel, by reason of the salt-laden atmosphere. Near\r\nGosport, and at Fig Valleys, in the neighbourhood of Worthing,\r\nthere are orchards of figtrees; but they remain barren in this country\r\nas far as affording seed to be raised anew from the ripened fruit. The\r\nfirst figtrees introduced into England are still alive and productive\r\nin the gardens of the Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth, having\r\nbeen planted there by Cardinal Pole in the time of Henry the Eighth.\r\nWe call the Sunday before Easter \"Fig Sunday,\" probably because\r\nof our Saviour's quest of the fruit when going from Bethany the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBy the Jews a want of blossom on the Fig tree was considered a\r\ngrievous calamity. On the Saturday preceding Palm Sunday (says\r\nMiss Baker), the market at Northampton is abundantly supplied\r\nwith figs, and more of the fruit is purchased at this time than\r\nthroughout the rest of the year. Even charity children are regaled in\r\nsome parts with figs on the said Sunday; whilst in Lancashire fig\r\npies made of dried figs with sugar and treacle are eaten beforehand\r\nin Lent.\r\n\r\nIn order to become fertilised, figs (of which the sexual apparatus lies\r\nwithin the fruit) must have their outer skin perforated by certain\r\ngnats of the Cynips tribe, which then penetrate to the interior whilst\r\ncarrying with them the fertilising pollen; but these gnats are not\r\nfound in this country. Producers of the fruit abroad bearing the said\r\nfact in view tie some of the wild fruit when tenanted by the Culex\r\nfly to the young cultivated figs.\r\n\r\nForeign figs are dried in the oven so as to destroy the larvae of the\r\nCynips insect, and are then compressed into small boxes. They\r\nconsist in this state almost exclusively of mucilage and sugar.\r\n\r\n[196] Only one kind of Fig comes to ripeness with us in England,\r\nthe great blue Fig, as large as a Catherine pear. \"It should be\r\ngrown,\" says Gerard, \"under a hot wall, and eaten when newly\r\ngathered, with bread, pepper, and salt; or it is excellent in tarts.\"\r\nThis fruit is soft, easily digested, and corrective of strumous\r\ndisease. Dried Turkey Figs, as imported, contain glucose (sugar),\r\nstarch, fat, pectose, gum, albumen, mineral matter, collulose, and\r\nwater. They are used by our druggists as an ingredient in confection\r\nof senna for a gentle laxative effect. When split open, and applied\r\nas hot as they can be borne against gumboils, and similar suppurative\r\ngatherings, they afford ease, and promote maturation of the abscess;\r\nand likewise they will help raw, unhealthy sores to heal. The first\r\npoultice of Figs on record is that employed by King Hezekiah 260\r\nyears before Christ, at the instance of the prophet Isaiah, who\r\nordered to \"take a lump of Figs; and they took it, and laid it on the\r\nboil, and the King recovered\" (2 Kings xx. 7).\r\n\r\nThe Fig is said to have been the first fruit, eaten as food by man.\r\nAmong the Greeks it formed part of the ordinary Spartan fare, and\r\nthe Athenians forbade exportation of the best Figs, which were\r\nhighly valued at table. Informers against those who offended in this\r\nrespect were called _Suko phantai_, or Fig discoverers--our\r\n_Sycophants_.\r\n\r\nBacchus was thought to have acquired his vigour and corpulency\r\nfrom eating Figs, such as the Romans gave to professed wrestlers\r\nand champions for strength and good sustenance.\r\n\r\nDodonoeus said concerning Figs, _Alimentum amplius quam coeteri\r\nproebent_; and Pliny spoke of them as the best restorative\r\nfor those brought low by languishing [197] disease, with loss of\r\ntheir colour. It was under the Perpul tree (_Ficus religiosa_) Buddha\r\nattained Nirvada.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name _ficus_ has been derived from the Greek verb\r\n_phuo_ to generate, and the husbandry of Figs was called by the\r\nLatins \"caprification.\" The little fig-bird of the Roman Campagna\r\npays a yearly visit in September to the fig orchards on our Sussex\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nWhen eaten raw, dried Figs prove somewhat aperient, and they are\r\napt to make the mouth sore whilst masticating them. Their seeds\r\noperate mechanically against constipation, though sometimes\r\nirritating the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels. Grocers\r\nprepare from the pulp of these foreign dried figs, when mixed with\r\nhoney, a jam called \"figuine,\" which is wholesome, and will prevent\r\ncostiveness if eaten at breakfast with bread.\r\n\r\nThe pulp of Turkey Figs is mucilaginous, and has been long\r\nesteemed as a pectoral emollient for coughs: also when stewed and,\r\nadded to ptisans, for catarrhal troubles of the air passages, and of\r\nother mucous canals.\r\n\r\nIn its fresh green state the fruit secretes a mildly acrid juice, which\r\nwill destroy warts; this afterwards becomes saccharine and oily. The\r\ndried Figs of the shops give no idea of the fresh fruit as enjoyed in\r\nItaly at breakfast, which then seem indeed a fruit of paradise, and\r\nwhich contain a considerable quantity of grape sugar. In the\r\n_Regimen of the School of Salerno_ (eleventh century) we read:--\r\n\r\n     \"Scrofa, tumor, glandes, ficus cataplasma sedet,\r\n     Swines' evil, swellings, kernels, a plaster of figs will heal.\"\r\n\r\nBarley water boiled with dried Figs (split open), liquorice root, and\r\nraisins, forms the compound decoction of barley prescribed by\r\ndoctors as a capital demulcent; [198] and an admirable gargle for\r\ninflamed sore throat may be made by boiling two ounces of the Figs\r\nin half-a-pint of water, which is to be strained when cool. Figs\r\ncooked in milk make an excellent drink for costive persons.\r\n\r\nIn the French codex a favourite pectoral medicine is composed of\r\nFigs, stoned dates, raisins, and jujubes.\r\n\r\nFormerly the poisoned Fig was used in Spain as a secret means for\r\ngetting rid of an enemy. The fruit was so common there that to say\r\n\"a fig for you!\" and \"I give you the fig\" became proverbial\r\nexpressions of contempt. _In fiocchi_ (in gala costome), is an Italian\r\nphrase which we now render as \"in full fig.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Water Figwort_, a common English plant which grows by the\r\nsides of ditches, and belongs to the scrofula-curing order, has\r\nacquired its name because supposed to heal sores in the fundament\r\nwhen applied like figs as a poultice. It further bears the name of\r\n_Water Betony_ (_page_ 50), under which title its curative\r\nexcellence against piles, and for scrofulous glands in the neck has\r\nbeen already described. The whole plant, yielding its juice, may be\r\nblended with lard to be used as an ointment; and an infusion of the\r\nroots, made with boiling water, an ounce to a pint, may be taken as a\r\nmedicine--a wineglassful three times in the day.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland it is known as \"Rose noble,\" also as Kernelwort, because\r\nthe kernels, or tubers attached to the roots have been thought to\r\nresemble scrofulous glands in the neck. \"Divers do rashly teach that\r\nif it be hanged about the necke, or else carried about one it keepeth a\r\nman in health.\" In France the sobriquet _herbe du seige_, given to\r\nthis plant, is said to have been derived from its famous use in\r\nhealing all sorts of wounds during the long siege of Rochelle under\r\nLouis XIII.\r\n\r\n[199] The Water Figwort may be readily known by the winged\r\ncorners of its stems, which, though hollow and succulent, are rigid\r\nwhen dead, and prove very troublesome to anglers. The flowers are\r\nmuch frequented by wasps: and the leaves are employed to correct\r\nthe taste of senna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAG (Common).\r\n\r\nOur English water Flags are true whigs of the old school, and get\r\ntheir generic name because hanging out their banners respectively of\r\ndark blue and yellow.\r\n\r\nEach is also called Iris, as resembling the rainbow in beauty of\r\ncolour. The land Flag (_Iris versicolor_) is well known as growing\r\nin swamps and moist meadows, with sword-shaped leaves, and large\r\npurple heads of flowers, bearing petals chiefly dark blue, and veined\r\nwith green, yellow, or white. The water Flag (_Iris pseudacorus_) is\r\nsimilar of growth, and equally well known by its brilliant heads of\r\nyellow flowers, with blade-like leaves, being found in wet places\r\nand water courses. The root of the Blue Flag, \"Dragon Flower,\" or\r\n\"Dagger Flower,\" contains chemically an \"oleo-resin,\" which is\r\npurgative to the liver in material doses, and specially alleviative\r\nagainst bilious sickness when taken of much reduced strength by reason\r\nof its acting as a similar. The official dose of this \"iridin\" is\r\nfrom one to three grains. A liability to the formation of gall stones\r\nmay be remedied by giving one grain of the oleoresin (iridin) every\r\nnight for twelve nights.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture (H.) is made which holds this Iris in solution;\r\nand if three or four drops are taken immediately, with a spoonful of\r\nwater, and the same dose is repeated in half-an-hour if still\r\nnecessary, an attack of bilious vomiting, with sick headache, and a\r\n[200] film before the eyes, will be prevented, or cut short. The\r\nremedy is, under such circumstances, a trustworthy substitute for\r\ncalomel, or blue pill. Orris powder, which is so popular in the\r\nnursery, and for the toilet table with ladies, on account of its fresh\r\n\"violet\" scent, is made from the root of this Iris, being named from\r\nthe genitive _ireos_.\r\n\r\nLouis VII. of France chose this Blue Flag as his heraldic emblem,\r\nand hence its name, _fleur de lys_, has been subsequently borne on\r\nthe arms of France. The flower was said to have been figured on a\r\nshield sent down from heaven to King Louis at Clovis, when\r\nfighting against the Saracens. Fleur de Louis has become corrupted\r\nto _fleur de lys_, or _fleur de lis_.\r\n\r\nThe Purple Flag was formerly dedicated to the Virgin Mary. A\r\ncertain knight more devout than learned could never remember\r\nmore than two words of the Latin prayer addressed to the Holy\r\nMother; these were _Ave Maria_, which the good old man repeated\r\nday and night until he died. Then a plant of the blue Iris sprang up\r\nover his grave, displaying on every flower in golden letters these\r\nwords, _Ave Maria_. When the monks opened the tomb they found\r\nthe root of the plant resting on the lips of the holy knight whose\r\nbody lay buried below.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow Flag, or Water Flag, is called in the north, \"Seggs.\" Its\r\nflowers afford a beautiful yellow dye; and, its seeds, when roasted,\r\ncan be used instead of coffee. The juice of the root is very acrid\r\nwhen sniffed up the nostrils, and causes a copious flow of water\r\ntherefrom, thus giving marked relief for obstinate congestive\r\nheadache of a dull, passive sort. The root is very astringent, and will\r\ncheck diarrhoea by its infusion; also it is of service for making ink.\r\nIn the [201] south of England the plant is named \"Levers.\" It\r\ncontains much tannin.\r\n\r\nThe \"Stinking Flag,\" or \"Gladdon,\" or \"Roast Beef,\" because having\r\nthe odour of this viand, is another British species of Flag, abundant\r\nin southern England, where it grows in woods and, shady places. Its\r\nleaves, when bruised, emit a strong smell like that of carrion, which\r\nis very loathsome. The plant bears the appellations, _Iris\r\nfoetidissima_, _Spatual foetida_, and \"Spurgewort,\" having long,\r\nnarrow leaves, which stink when rubbed. Country folk in Somersetshire\r\npurge themselves to good purpose with a decoction made from\r\nthe root. The term \"glad,\" or \"smooth,\" refers to the surface\r\nof the leaves, or to their sword-like shape, from _gladiolus_\r\n(a small sword), and the plant bears flowers of a dull, livid purple,\r\nsmaller than those of the other flags.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is the Sweet Flag (_Acorus calamus_), though this is\r\nnot an Iris, but belongs botanically to the family of _Arums_. It\r\ngrows on the edges of lakes and streams allover Europe, as a highly\r\naromatic, reedy plant, with an erect flowering stem of yellowish\r\ngreen colour. Its name comes from the Greek, _koree_, or \"pupil of\r\nthe eye,\" because of its being used in ailments of that organ.\r\n\r\n_Calamus_ was the Roman term for a reed; and formerly this sweet\r\nFlag, by reason of its pleasant odour like that of violets, was freely\r\nstrewn on the floor of a cathedral at times of church festivals, and in\r\nmany private houses instead of rushes. The root is a powerful cordial\r\nagainst flatulence, and passive indigestion, with headache. It contains\r\na volatile oil, and a bitter principle, \"acorin;\" so that a fluid\r\nextract is made by the chemists, of which from thirty to forty drops\r\nmay be given as a dose, with a [202] tablespoonful, of water, every\r\nhalf-hour for several consecutive times. The candied root is much\r\nemployed for like uses in Turkey and India. It is sold as a favourite\r\nmedicine in every Indian Bazaar; and Ainslie says it is reckoned so\r\nvaluable in the bowel complaints of children, that there is a penalty\r\nincurred by every druggist who will not open his door in the middle\r\nof the night to sell it if demanded.\r\n\r\nThe root stocks are brought to this country from Germany, being\r\nused by mastication to cleat the urine when it is thick and loaded\r\nwith dyspeptic products; also for flavouring beer, and scenting\r\nsnuff.\r\n\r\nTheir ash contains potash, soda, zinc, phosphoric Acid, silica, and\r\nperoxide of iron. In the _Times_ April 24th, 1856, Dr. Graves wrote\r\ncommending for the soldiers when landing at Galipoli, and notable\r\nto obtain costly quinine, the Sweet Flag--_acorus calamas_--as their\r\nsheet anchor against ague and allied maladies arising from _marsh\r\nmiasmata_. The infusion of the root should be given, or the\r\npowdered root in doses of from ten to sixty grains. (_See_ RUSHES.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAX (LINSEED).\r\n\r\nThe common Flax plant, from which we get our Linseed, is of great\r\nantiquity, dating from the twenty-third century before Christ, and\r\nhaving been cultivated in all countries down to the present time. But\r\nit is exhausting to the soil in England, and therefore not favoured in\r\nhome growth for commercial uses. The seeds come to us chiefly\r\nfrom the Baltic. Nevertheless, the plant (_Linum usitatissimum_) is\r\nby no means uncommon in our cornfields, flowering in June, and\r\nripening its seed in September. Provincially it is called \"Lint\" and\r\n\"Lyne.\" A rustic proverb says \"if put in the shoes it preserves [203]\r\nfrom poverty\"; wherever found it is probably an escape from\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nThe word \"flax\" is derived from _filare_, to spin, or, _filum_, a\r\nthread; and the botanical title, _linum_, is got from the Celtic _lin_\r\nalso signifying thread. The fibres of the bark are separated from the\r\nwoody matter by soaking it in water, and they then form tow, which\r\nis afterwards spun into yarn, and woven into cloth. This water\r\nbecomes poisonous, so that Henry the Eighth prohibited the\r\nwashing of flax in any running stream.\r\n\r\nThe seeds ate very rich in linseed oil, after expressing which, the\r\nrefuse is oil-cake, a well-known fattening food for cattle. The oil\r\nexists chiefly in the outer skins of the seeds, and is easily extracted\r\nby boiling water, as in the making a linseed poultice. These seeds\r\ncontain gum, acetic acid, acetate and muriate of potash, and other\r\nsalts, with twenty-two parts per cent. of the oil. They were taken as\r\nfood by the ancient Greeks and Romans, whilst Hippocrates knew\r\nthe demulcent properties of linseed. An infusion of the seeds has\r\nlong been given as Linseed tea for soothing a sore chest or throat in\r\nsevere catarrh, or pulmonary complaints; also the crushed seed is\r\nused for making poultices. Linseed oil has laxative properties, and\r\nforms, when mixed with lime water, or with spirit of turpentine, a\r\ncapital external application to recent burns or scalds.\r\n\r\nTumours of a simple nature, and sprains, may be usefully rubbed\r\nwith Linseed oil; and another principal service to which the oil is\r\nput is for mixing the paints of artists. To make Linseed tea, wash\r\ntwo ounces of Linseed by putting them into a small strainer, and\r\npouring cold water through it; then pare off as thinly as possible the\r\nyellow rind of half a lemon; to the Linseed and lemon rind add a\r\nquart of cold water, [204] and allow them to simmer over the fire for\r\nan hour-and-a-half; strain away the seeds, and to each half-pint of\r\nthe tea add a teaspoonful of sugar, or sugar candy, with some lemon\r\njuice, in the proportion of the juice of one lemon to each pint of tea.\r\n\r\nThe seeds afford but little actual nourishment, and are difficult of\r\ndigestion; they provoke troublesome flatulence, though sometimes\r\nused fraudulently for adulterating pepper. Flax seed has been mixed\r\nwith corn for making bread, but it proved indigestible and hurtful to\r\nthe stomach. In the sixteenth century during a scarcity of wheat, the\r\ninhabitants of Middleburgh had recourse to Linseed for making\r\ncakes, but the death of many citizens was caused thereby, it bringing\r\nabout in those who partook of the cakes dreadful swellings on the\r\nbody and face. There is an Act of Parliament still in force which\r\nforbids the steeping of Flax in rivers, or any waters which cattle are\r\naccustomed to drink, as it is found to communicate a poison\r\ndestructive to cattle and to the fish inhabiting such waters. In\r\nDundee a hank of yarn is worn round the loins as a cure for\r\nlumbago, and girls may be seen with a single thread of yarn round\r\nthe head as an infallible specific for tic douloureux.\r\n\r\nThe Purging Flax (_Linum catharticum_), or Mill Mountain\r\n(_Kamailinon_), or Ground Flax, is a variety of the Flax common\r\non our heaths and pastures, being called also Fairy Flax from its\r\ndelicacy, and Dwarf Flax. It contains a resinous, purgative principle,\r\nand is known to country folk as a safe, active purge. They infuse the\r\nherb in water, which they afterwards take medicinally. Also a\r\ntincture is made (H.) from the entire fresh plant, which may be\r\ngiven curatively for frequent, wattery, painless diarrhoea, two or\r\nthree [205] drops for a dose with water every hour or two until the\r\nflux is stayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOXGLOVE.\r\n\r\nThe purple Foxglove (_Digitalis purpurea_) which every one knows\r\nand admires for its long graceful spikes of elegant bell-shaped\r\nbrilliant blossoms seen in our woods and hedges, is also called the\r\nThimble Flower, or the Finger Flower, from the resemblance of\r\nthese blossoms to a thimble or to the fingers of a glove. The word\r\ndigitalis refers likewise to the digits, or fingers of a gauntlet. In\r\nFrance the title is _Gants de Notre Dame_, the gloves of our Lady\r\nthe Virgin. Some writers give Folks' Glove, or Fairies' Glove as the\r\nproper English orthography, but this is wrong. Our name of the\r\nplant comes really from the Anglo-Saxon, Foxesglew or Fox music,\r\nin allusion to an ancient musical instrument composed of bells\r\nwhich were hanging from an arched support, _a tintinnabulum_,\r\nwhich this plant with its pendent bell-shaped flowers so exactly\r\nrepresents.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the Foxglove is known as the Great Herb, and Lusmore,\r\nalso the Fairy Cap; and in Wales it is the Goblin's Gloves; whilst in\r\nthe North of Scotland it is the Dead men's Bells. We read in the\r\n_Lady of the Lake_ there grew by Loch Katrine:--\r\n\r\n    \"Night shade and Foxglove side by side,\r\n    Emblems of punishment and pride.\"\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire the plant is termed Poppy, because when one of the\r\nbell-shaped flowers is inflated by the breath whilst the top edges are\r\nheld firmly together; the wind bag thus formed, if struck smartly\r\nagainst the other hand, goes off with a sounding pop. The peasantry\r\nalso call it \"Flop a dock.\" Strangely enough, the Foxglove, so\r\nhandsome and striking in a landscape, is not [206] mentioned by\r\nShakespeare, or by either of the old English poets. The \"long\r\npurples\" of Shakespeare refers to the _orchis mascula_.\r\n\r\nChemically, the Foxglove contains a dangerous, active, medicinal\r\nprinciple _digitalin_, which acts powerfully on the heart, and on the\r\nkidneys, but this should never be given in any preparation of the\r\nplant except under medical guidance, and then only with much\r\ncaution. Parkinson speaks highly of the bruised herb, or of its\r\nexpressed juice, for scrofulous swellings when applied outwardly in\r\nthe form of an ointment. An officinal tincture is made from the\r\nplants collected in the spring, when two years old; also, in some\r\nvillages the infusion is employed as a homely remedy to cure a cold,\r\nthe herb being known as \"Throttle Wort;\" but this is not a safe thing\r\nto do, for medical experience shows that the watery infusion of\r\nFoxglove acts much more powerfully than the spirituous tincture,\r\nwhich is eight times stronger, and from this fact it may fairly be\r\ninferred that the presence of alcohol, as in the tincture, directly\r\nopposes the specific action of the plant. This herb bears further in\r\nsome districts the names \"Flop Top,\" \"Cow Flop,\" and \"Flabby\r\nDock.\" It was stated in the _Times Telescope_, 1822, \"the women\r\nof the poorer class in Derbyshire used to indulge in copious\r\ndraughts of Foxglove tea, as a cheap means of obtaining the\r\npleasures of intoxication. This was found to produce a great\r\nexhilaration of the spirits, with other singular effects on the\r\nsystem.\" So true is the maxim, _ubi virus, ibi virtus_.\r\n\r\nNo animal will touch the plant, which is biennial, and will only\r\ndevelop its active principle _digitalin_, when getting some sunshine,\r\nbut remains inert when grown altogether in the shade. Therefore its\r\nsource of production for medicinal purposes is very important.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[207] FUMITORY.\r\n\r\nThe common Fumitory (_Fumaria officinalis_) is a small grey-green\r\nplant, bearing well known little flowers, rose coloured, and tipped\r\nwith purple, whilst standing erect in every cornfield, vineyard, or\r\nsuch-like manured place throughout Great Britain. It is so named\r\nfrom the Latin _fumus terroe_, earth smoke, which refers either to\r\nthe appearance of its pretty glaucous foliage on a dewy summer\r\nmorning, or to the belief that it was produced not from seed but\r\nfrom vapours rising out of the earth. The plant continues to flower\r\nthroughout the year, and was formerly much favoured for making\r\ncosmetic washes to purify the skin of rustic maidens in the spring\r\ntime:--\r\n\r\n     \"Whose red and purpled mottled flowers\r\n         Are cropped by maids in weeding hours\r\n     To boil in water, milk, or whey,\r\n         For washes on a holiday;\r\n     To make their beauty fair and sleek,\r\n         And scare the tan from summer's cheek.\"\r\n\r\nIn many parts of Kent the Fumitory bears the name of \"Wax Dolls,\"\r\nbecause its rose coloured flowers, with their little, dark, purple\r\nheads, are by no means unlike the small waxen toys given as\r\nnurslings to children.\r\n\r\nDioscorides affirmed: \"The juice of Fumitory, of that which\r\ngroweth among barley, with gum arabic, doth take away unprofitable\r\nhairs that prick, being first plucked away, for it will not\r\nsuffer others to grow in their places.\" \"It helpeth,\" says Gerard, \"in\r\nthe summer time those that are troubled with scabs.\"\r\n\r\nPliny said it is named because causing the eyes to water as smoke\r\ndoes. In Shakespeare the name is written Fumiter. It continues to\r\nflower throughout the year, and its presence is thought to indicate\r\ngood deep rich land. There is also a \"ramping\" Fumitory [208]\r\n(_capreolata_) which climbs; being found likewise in fields and\r\nwaste places, but its infusion produces purgative effects.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant has a saline, bitter, and somewhat acrid taste. It\r\ncontains \"fumaric acid,\" and the alkaloid \"fumarina,\" which are\r\nspecially useful for scrofulous diseases of the skin. A decoction of\r\nthe herb makes a curative lotion for the milk-crust which disfigures\r\nthe scalp of an infant, and for grown up persons troubled with\r\nchronic eruptions on the face, or freckles.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice may be given as a medicine; or an infusion made\r\nwith an ounce of the plant to a pint of boiling water, one\r\nwineglassful for a dose twice or three times in the day.\r\n\r\nBy the ancients Fumitory was named _Capnos_, smoke: Pliny wrote\r\n\"_Claritatem facit inunctis oculis delachrymationemque, ceu fumus,\r\nunde nomen_.\" They esteemed the herb specially useful for\r\ndispelling dimness of the sight, and for curing other infirmities of\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, which have no particular odour, throw up crystals of\r\nnitre on their surface when cool. The juice may be mixed with\r\nwhey, and taken as a common drink, or as a medicinal beverage for\r\ncuring obstinate skin eruptions, and for overcoming obstructions of\r\nthe liver and digestive organs. Dr. Cullen found it most useful in\r\nleprous skin disease. The juice from the fresh herb may be given\r\ntwo ounces in the day, but the virtues remain equally in the dried\r\nplant. Its smoke was said by the ancient exorcists to have the power\r\nof expelling evil spirits. The famous physician, John of Milan,\r\nextolled Fumitory as a sovereign remedy against malarious fever.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that the colour of the hair and the complexion\r\nseem to determine the liability, or [209] otherwise, of a European to\r\nWest Coast fever in Africa. A man with harsh, bright-coloured red\r\nhair, such as is common in Scotland, has a complete immunity,\r\nthough running the same risks as another mall, dark and with a dry\r\nskin, who seems absolutely doomed. A red-haired European will, as\r\na rule, keep his health where even the natives are attacked. Old\r\nnegresses have secret methods of cure which can, undoubtedly, save\r\nlife even in cases which have become hopeless to European medical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGARLIC, LEEK, and ONION.\r\n\r\nSeeming at first sight out of place among the lilies of the field, yet\r\nGarlic, the Leek, and the Onion are true members of that noble\r\norder, and may be correctly classified together with the favoured\r\ntribe, \"Clothed more grandly than Solomon in all his glory.\" They\r\npossess alike the same properties and characteristics, though in\r\nvarying degrees, and they severally belong to the genus _Allium_,\r\neach containing \"allyl,\" which is a radical rich in sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe homely Onion may be taken first as the best illustration of the\r\nfamily. This is named technically _Allium cepa_, from _cep_, a\r\nhead (of bunched florets which it bears). Lucilius called it _Flebile\r\ncoepe_, because the pungency of its odour will provoke a flow of\r\ntears from the eyes. As Shakespeare says, in _Taming of the\r\nShrew_:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mine eyes smell onions;\r\n     I shall weep anon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were devoted to Onions, which they ate more than\r\ntwo thousand years before the time of Christ. They were given to\r\nswear by the Onion and [210] Garlic in their gardens. Herodotus\r\ntells us that during the building of the pyramids nine tons of gold\r\nwere spent in buying onions for the workmen. But it is to be noted\r\nthat in Egypt the Onion is sweet and soft; whereas, in other\r\ncountries it grows hard, and nauseous, and strong.\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks this bulb was called Krommuon, \"_apo tau Meuein\r\ntas koras_,\" because of shutting the eyes when eating it. In Latin its\r\nname _unio_, signified a single root without offsets.\r\n\r\nRaw Onions contain an acrid volatile oil, sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nalkaline earthy salts, phosphoric and acetic acids, with phosphate\r\nand citrate of lime, starch, free uncrystallized sugar, and lignine.\r\nThe fresh juice is colourless, but by exposure to the air becomes red.\r\nA syrup made from the juice with honey is an excellent medicine\r\nfor old phlegmatic persons in cold weather, when their lungs are\r\nstuffed, and the breathing is hindered.\r\n\r\nRaw Onions increase the flow of urine, and promote perspiration,\r\ninsomuch, that a diet of them, with bread, has many a time cured\r\ndropsy coming on through a chill at first, or from exposure to cold.\r\nThey contain the volatile principle, \"sulphide of allyl,\" which is\r\nacrid and stimulating. If taken in small quantities, Onions quicken\r\nthe circulation, and assist digestion; but when eaten more prodigally\r\nthey disagree.\r\n\r\nIn making curative Simples, the Onion (and Garlic) should not be\r\nboiled, else the volatile essential oil, on which its virtues chiefly\r\ndepend, will escape during the process.\r\n\r\nThe principal internal effects of the Onion, the Leek, and Garlic, are\r\nstimulation and warmth, so that they are of more salutary use when\r\nthe subject is of a cold [211] temperament, and when the vital\r\npowers are feeble, than when the body is feverish, and the\r\nconstitution ardently excitable. \"They be naught,\" says Gerard, \"for\r\nthose that be cholericke; but good for such as are replete with raw\r\nand phlegmatick humors.\" _Vous tous qui etes gros, et gras, et\r\nlymphatiques, avec l'estomac paresseux, mangez l'oignon cru; c'est\r\npour vous que le bon Dieu l'a fait_.\r\n\r\nOnions, when eaten at night by those who are not feverish, will\r\npromote sleep, and induce perspiration. The late Frank Buckland\r\nconfirmed this statement. He said, \"I am sure the essential oil of\r\nOnions has soporific powers. In my own case it never fails. If I am\r\nmuch pressed with work, and feel that I am not disposed to sleep, I\r\neat two or three small Onions, and the effect is magical.\" The Onion\r\nhas a very sensitive organism, and absorbs all morbid matter that\r\ncomes in its way. During our last epidemic of cholera it puzzled the\r\nsanitary inspectors of a northern town why the tenants of one\r\ncottage in an infected row were not touched by the plague. At last\r\nsome one noticed a net of onions hanging in the fortunate house,\r\nand on examination all these proved to have become diseased. But\r\nwhilst welcoming this protective quality, the danger must be\r\nremembered of eating an onion which shows signs of decay, for it\r\ncannot be told what may have caused this distemper.\r\n\r\nWhen sliced, and applied externally, the raw Onion serves by its\r\npungent and essential oil to quicken the circulation, and to redden\r\nthe skin of the particular surface treated in this way; very usefully\r\nso in the case of an unbroken chilblain, or to counteract neuralgic\r\npain; but in its crude state the bulb is not emollient or demulcent. If\r\nemployed as a poultice for ear-ache, or broken chilblains, the Onion\r\nshould be roasted, so as to [212] modify its acrid oil. When there is\r\na constant arid painful discharge of fetid matter from the ear, or\r\nwhere an abscess is threatened, with pain, heat, and swelling, a hot\r\npoultice of roasted Onions will be found very useful, and will\r\nmitigate the pain. The juice of a sliced raw Onion is alkaline, and\r\nwill quickly relieve the acid venom of a sting from a wasp, or bee, if\r\napplied immediately to the part.\r\n\r\nA tincture is made (H.) from large, red, strong Onions for medicinal\r\npurposes. As a warming expectorant in chronic bronchitis, or\r\nasthma, or for a cold which is not of a feverish character, from half\r\nto one teaspoonful of this tincture may be given with benefit three\r\nor four times in the day in a wineglassful of hot water, or hot milk.\r\nLikewise, a jorum (_i.e._, an earthen bowl) of hot Onion broth taken\r\nat bedtime, serves admirably to soothe the air passages, and to\r\npromote perspiration; after the first feverish stage of catarrh or\r\ninfluenza has passed by. To make this, peel a large Spanish Onion,\r\nand divide it into four parts; then put them into a saucepan, with half\r\na saltspoonful of salt, and two ounces of butter, and a pint of cold\r\nwater; let them simmer gently until quite tender; next pour all into a\r\nbowl which has been made hot, dredging a little pepper over; and let\r\nthe porridge be eaten as hot as it can be taken.\r\n\r\nThe allyl and sulphur in the bulbs, together with their mucilaginous\r\nparts, relieve the sore mucous membranes, and quicken perspiration,\r\nwhilst other medicinal virtues are exercised at the same time on the\r\nanimal economy.\r\n\r\nBy eating a few raw parsley sprigs immediately afterwards, the\r\nstrong smell which onions communicates to the breath may be\r\nremoved and dispelled. Lord [213] Bacon averred \"the rose will be\r\nsweeter if planted in a bed of onions.\" So nutritious does the\r\nHighlander find this vegetable, that, if having a few raw bulbs in his\r\npocket, with oat-cake, or a crust of bread, he can travel for two or\r\nthree days together without any other food. Dean Swift said:--\r\n\r\n     \"This is every cook's opinion,\r\n     No savoury dish without an onion,\r\n     But lest your kissing should be spoiled,\r\n     Your onions must be fully boiled.\"\r\n\r\nProvings have been made by medical experts of the ordinary red\r\nOnion in order to ascertain what its toxical effects are when pushed\r\nto an excessive degree, and it has been found that Onions, Leeks,\r\nor Garlic, when taken immoderately, induce melancholy and\r\ndepression, with severe catarrh. They dispose to sopor, lethargy, and\r\neven insanity. The immediate symptoms are extreme watering of the\r\neyes after frequent sneezing, confusion of the head, and heavy\r\ndefluxion from the nose, with pains in the throat extending to the\r\nears; in a word, all the accompaniments of a bad cold, sneezings,\r\nlacrymation, pains in the forehead, and a hoarse, hacking cough.\r\nThese being the effects of taking Onions in a harmful quantity, it is\r\neasy to understand that when the like morbid symptoms have arisen\r\nspontaneously from other causes, as from a sharp catarrh of the head\r\nand chest, then modified forms of the Onion are calculated to\r\ncounteract them on the law of similars, so that a cure is promptly\r\nproduced. On which principle the Onion porridge is a scientific\r\nremedy, as food, and as Physic, during the first progress of a\r\ncatarrhal attack, and _pari passu_ the medicinal tincture of the red\r\nOnion may be likewise curatively given.\r\n\r\n[214] Spanish Onions, which are imported into this country in the\r\nwinter, are sweet and mucilaginous. A peasant in Spain will munch\r\nan onion just as an English labourer eats an apple.\r\n\r\nAt the present day Egyptians take onions, roasted, and each cut into\r\nfour pieces, with small bits of baked meat, and slices of an acid\r\napple, which the Turks call kebobs. With this sweet and savoury dish\r\nthey are so delighted, that they trust to enjoy it in paradise. The\r\nIsraelites were willing to return to slavery and brick-making for\r\ntheir love of the Onion; and we read that Hecamedes presented\r\nsome of the bulbs to Patrochus, in _Homer_, as a regala. These are\r\nsupplied liberally to the antelopes and giraffes in our Zoological\r\nGardens, which animals dote on the Onion.\r\n\r\nA clever paraprase of the word Onion may be read in the lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"Charge! Stanley, charge! On! Stanley, on!\r\n     Were the last words of Marmion.\r\n     If _I_ had been in Stanley's place\r\n     When Marmion urged him to the chase,\r\n     In me you quickly would descry\r\n     What draws a tear from many an eye.\"\r\n\r\nFor chilblains apply onions with salt pounded together, and for\r\ninflamed or protruding piles, raw Onion pulp, made by bruising the\r\nbulb, if kept bound to the parts by a compress, and renewed as\r\nneeded, will afford certain relief.\r\n\r\nThe Garlic (_Allium sativum_), Skorodon of the Greeks, which was\r\nfirst cultivated in English gardens in 1540, takes its name, from\r\n_gar_, a spear; and _leac_, a plant, either because of its sharp\r\ntapering leaves, or perhaps as \"the war plant,\" by reason of its\r\nnutritive and stimulating qualities for those who do battle. It is\r\nknown also [215] to many as \"Poor-man's Treacle,\" or \"Churls\r\nTreacle,\" from being regarded by rustics as a treacle, or antidote to\r\nthe bite of any venomous reptile.\r\n\r\nThe bulb, consisting of several combined cloves, is stimulating,\r\nantispasmodic, expectorant, and diuretic. Its active properties\r\ndepend on an essential oil which may be readily obtained by\r\ndistillation. A medicinal tincture is made (H.) with spirit of wine, of\r\nwhich from ten to twenty drops may be taken in water several times\r\na day. Garlic proves useful in asthma, whooping-cough, and other\r\nspasmodic affections of the chest. For all adult, one or more cloves\r\nmay be eaten at a time. The odour of the bulb is very diffusible,\r\neven when it is applied to the soles of the feet its odour is exhaled\r\nby the lungs.\r\n\r\nWhen bruised and mixed with lard, it makes a most useful opbdeldoc\r\nto be rubbed in for irritable spines of indolent scrofulous\r\ntumours or gout, until the skin surface becomes red and glowing. If\r\nemployed thus over the chest (back and front) of a child with\r\nwhooping-cough, it proves eminently helpful.\r\n\r\nRaw Garlic, when applied to the skin, reddens it, and the odour\r\nsniffed into the nostrils will revive an hysterical sufferer. It formed\r\nthe principal ingredient in the \"Four thieves' vinegar,\" which was\r\nadopted so successfully at Marseilles for protection against the\r\nplague, when prevailing there. This originated with four thieves,\r\nwho confessed that, whilst protected by the liberal use of aromatic\r\nvinegar during the plague, they plundered the dead bodies of its\r\nvictims with complete security. Or, according to another\r\nexplanation of the name, an old tract, printed in 1749, testifies that\r\none, Richard Forthave, who lived in Bishopsgate Street, invented\r\nand sold a vinegar which had such a run that [216] he soon grew\r\nfamous, and that his surname became thus corrupted in the course of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBut long before the plague at Marseilles (1722) vinegar was\r\nemployed as a disinfectant. With Cardinal Wolsey it was a constant\r\ncustom to carry in his hand an orange emptied of its pulp, and\r\ncontaining a sponge soaked in vinegar made aromatic with spices,\r\nso as to protect himself from infection when passing through the\r\ncrowds which his splendour and his office attracted.\r\n\r\nIt is related that during a former outbreak of infectious fever in\r\nSomer's Town and St. Giles's, the French priests, who constantly used\r\nGarlic in all their dishes, visited the worst cases in the dirtiest\r\nhovels with impunity, while the English clergy, who were similarly\r\nengaged, but who did not eat onions in like fashion, caught the\r\ninfection in many instances, and fell victims to the disease.\r\n\r\nFor toothache and earache, a clove of Garlic stripped of its skin, and\r\ncut in the form of a suppository, if thrust in the ear of the aching\r\nside, will soon assuage the pain. If introduced into the lower bowel,\r\nit will help to destroy thread worms, and when swallowed it\r\nabolishes round worms.\r\n\r\nAs a condiment, Garlic undoubtedly aids digestion by stimulating\r\nthe circulation, with a consequent increase of saliva and gastric\r\njuice. The juice from the bulbs can be employed for cementing\r\nbroken glass or china, by means of its mucilage.\r\n\r\nDr. Bowles, a noted English physician of former times, made use of\r\nGarlic with much success as a secret remedy for asthma. He\r\nconcocted a preserve from the boiled cloves with vinegar and sugar,\r\nto be kept in an earthen jar. The dose was a bulb or two with some\r\nof the syrup, each morning when fasting. [217] The pain of\r\nrheumatic parts may be much relieved by simply rubbing them with\r\ncut Garlic.\r\n\r\nGarlic emits the most acrimonious smell of all the onion tribe.\r\nWhen leprosy prevailed in this country, Garlic was a prime specific\r\nfor its relief, and as the victims had to \"pil,\" or peel their own\r\ngarlic, they were nicknamed \"Pil Garlics,\" and hence it came about that\r\nanyone shunned like a leper had this epithet applied to him. Stow\r\nsays, concerning a man growing old: \"He will soon be a peeled\r\ngarlic like myself.\"\r\n\r\nThe strong penetrating odour and taste of this plant, though\r\noffensive to most English palates, are much relished by Russians,\r\nPoles, and Spaniards, and especially by the Jews. But the Greeks\r\ndetested Garlic. It is true the Attic husbandmen ate it from remote\r\ntimes, probably in part to drive away by its odour venomous\r\ncreatures from assailing them; but persons who partook of it were\r\nnot allowed to enter the temples of Cybele, says Athenaeus; and so\r\nhated was garlic, that to have to eat it was a punishment for those\r\nthat had committed the most horrid crimes; Horace, among the\r\nRomans, was made ill by eating garlic at the table of Maecenas; and\r\nafterwards (in his third _Epode_) he reviled the plant as, _Cicutis\r\nallium nocentius_, \"Garlic more poisonous than hemlock.\" Sir\r\nTheodore Martin has thus spiritedly translated the passage:--\r\n\r\n     \"If his old father's throat any impious sinner,\r\n         Has cut with unnatural hand to the bone:\r\n     Give him garlick--more noxious than hemlock--at dinner;\r\n         Ye gods! what strong stomachs the reapers must own!\"\r\n\r\nThe singular property is attributed to Garlic, that if a morsel of the\r\nbulb is chewed by a man running a race, it will prevent his\r\ncompetitors from getting ahead of him. Hungarian jockeys sometimes\r\nfasten a clove of [218] garlic to the bits of their racers; and\r\nit is said that the horses which run against those thus baited, fall\r\nback the moment they smell the offensive odour. If a leg of mutton,\r\nbefore being roasted, has a small clove of Garlic inserted into the\r\nknuckle, and the joint is afterwards served with haricot beans\r\n(soaked for twenty-four hours before being boiled), it is rendered\r\ndoubly delicious. In Greece snails dressed with Garlic are now a\r\nfavourite dish.\r\n\r\nA well known _chef_ is said to have chewed a small clove of Garlic\r\nwhen he wished to impart its delicate flavour to a choice _plat_,\r\nover which he then breathed lightly. Dumas relates that the whole\r\natmosphere of Provence is impregnated with the perfume of Garlic,\r\nand is exceedingly wholesome to inhale.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of lunar influences (which undoubtedly affect our\r\nbodily welfare), it is remarkable that if Garlic is planted when the\r\nmoon is in the full, the bulb will be round like an onion, instead of\r\nbeing composed, as it usually is, of several distinct cloves.\r\n\r\nHomer says it was to the virtues of the Yellow Garlic (Moly?)\r\nUlysses owed his escape from being changed by Circe into a pig,\r\nlike each of his companions.\r\n\r\nThe Crow Garlic, _vineale_, and the purple striped, _oleraceum_,\r\ngrow wild in this country. When the former of these is eaten by\r\nbirds it so stupefies them that they may be taken with the hand.\r\n\r\nConcerning the cure of nervous headache by Garlic (and its kindred\r\nmedicinal herb _Asafoetida_), an old charm reads thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"Give onyons to Saynt Cutlake,\r\n     And Garlycke to Saynt Cyryake;\r\n     If ye will shun the headake,\r\n         Ye shall have them at Queenhyth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Asafoetida (_Ferula Asafoetida_) grows in Western Thibet, and\r\nexudes a gum which is used medicinally, coming as a milky juice\r\nfrom the incised root and soon coagulating; it is then exported,\r\nhaving a very powerful odour of garlic which may be perceived a\r\nlong distance away. Phosphorus and sulphur are among its\r\nconstituent elements, and, because of the latter, says Dr. Garrod\r\nafter much observation, he regards Asafoetida as one of the most\r\nvaluable remedies known to the physician. From three to five grains\r\nof the gum in a pill, or half-a-teaspoonful of the tincture, with a\r\nsmall wineglassful of warm milk, may be given for a dose.\r\n\r\nSome of the older writers esteemed it highly as an aromatic\r\nflavouring spice, and termed it _cibus deorum_, food of the gods.\r\nJohn Evelyn says (in his _Acetaria_) \"the ancient Silphium thought\r\nby many to be none other than the fetid asa, was so highly prized for\r\nits taste and virtues, that it was dedicated to Apollo at Delphi, and\r\nstamped upon African coins as a sacred plant.\"\r\n\r\nAristophanes extolled its juice as a restorer of masculine vigour, and\r\nthe Indians at this day sauce their viands with it. Nor are some of\r\nour skilful cooks ignorant how to condite it, with the applause of\r\nthose who are unaware of the secret. The Silphium, or _laserpitium_\r\nof the Romans, yielded what was a famous restorative, the\r\n\"Cyrenaic juice.\" Pareira tells us he was assured by a noted gourmet\r\nthat the finest relish which a beef steak can possess, may be\r\ncommunicated to it by rubbing the gridiron on which the steak is to\r\nbe cooked, with Asafoetida.\r\n\r\nThe gum when given in moderate doses, acts on all parts of the\r\nbody as a wholesome stimulant, leading among other good results,\r\nto improvement of the vision, [220] and enlivening the spirits. But\r\nits use is apt to produce eructations smacking of garlic, which may\r\npersist for several hours; and, if it be given in over doses, the\r\neffects are headache and giddiness. When suitably administered, it\r\nquickens the appetite and improves the digestion, chiefly with those\r\nof a cold temperament, and languid habit. Smollet says the Romans\r\nstuffed their fowls for the table with Asafoetida. In Germany,\r\nSweden, and Italy, it is known as \"Devil's Dung.\"\r\n\r\nThe Leek (_Allium porrium_) bears an Anglo-Saxon name corrupted\r\nfrom Porleac, and it is also called the Porret, having been\r\nthe Prason of the Greeks. It was first made use of in England during\r\n1562. This was a food of the poor in ancient Egypt, as is shown by\r\nan inscription on one of the Pyramids, whence was derived the\r\nphrase, \"to eat the Leek\"; and its loss was bewailed by the Israelites\r\nin their journey through the Desert. It was said by the Romans to be\r\nprolific of virtue, because Latona, the mother of Apollo, longed\r\nafter leeks. The Welsh, who take them much, are observed to be\r\nvery fruitful. They dedicate these plants to St. David, on whose day,\r\nMarch 1st, in 640, the Britons (who were known to each other by\r\ndisplaying in their caps, at the inspiration of St. David, some leeks,\r\n\"the fairest emblym that is worne,\" plucked in a garden near the\r\nfield of action) gained a complete victory over the Saxons.\r\n\r\nThe bulb contains some sulphur, and is, in its raw state, a\r\nstimulating expectorant. Its juice acts energetically on the kidneys,\r\nand dissolves the calculous formations of earthy phosphates which\r\nfrequently form in the bladder.\r\n\r\nFor chilblains, chapped hands, and sore eyes, the juice of a leek\r\nsqueezed out, and mixed with cream, [221] has been found curative.\r\nOld Tusser tells us, in his _Husbandry for March_:--\r\n\r\n     \"Now leeks are in season, for pottage full good,\r\n     That spareth the milch cow, and purgeth the blood,\"\r\n\r\nand a trite proverb of former times bids us:--\r\n\r\n     \"Eat leeks in Lide [March] and ramsons in May,\r\n    Then all the year after physicians can play.\"\r\n\r\nRamsons, or the Wild Garlic (_Allium ursinum_), is broad leaved,\r\nand grows abundantly on our moist meadow banks, with a strong smell\r\nof onions when crushed or bruised. It is perennial, having egg-shaped\r\nor lance-like leaves, whilst bearing large, pearly-white\r\nblossoms with acute petals. The name is the plural of \"Ramse,\" or\r\n\"Ram,\" which signifies strong-smelling, or rank. And the plant is\r\nalso called \"Buck Rams,\" or \"Buck Rampe,\" in allusion to its spadix\r\nor spathe. \"The leaves of Ramsons,\" says Gerard, \"are stamped and\r\neaten with fish, even as we do eat greene sauce made with sorrell.\"\r\nThis is \"Bear's Garlic,\" and the Star Flower of florists.\r\n\r\nLeeks were so highly esteemed by the Emperor Nero, that his\r\nsubjects gave him the sobriquet of \"Porrophagus.\" He took them\r\nwith oil for several days in each month to clear his voice, eating\r\nno bread on those days. _Un remede d'Empereur (Neron) pour se\r\ndebarrasser d'un rhume,--et de commere pour attendre le meme but--\r\nfut envelopper un oignon dans une feuille de chou et le faire cuire\r\nsous la cendre; puis l'ecrasser, le reduire en pulpe, le mettre dans\r\nune tasse de lait, ou une decoction chaude de redisse; se coucher; et\r\nse tenir chaudement, au besoin recidiver matin et soir_.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch leek is more hardy and pungent than that [222] grown in\r\nEngland. It was formerly a favourite ingredient in the Cock-a-Leekie\r\nsoup of Caledonia, which is so graphically described by Sir\r\nWalter Scott, in the _Fortunes of Nigel_.\r\n\r\nA \"Herby\" pie, peculiar to Cornwall, is made of leeks and pilchards,\r\nor of nettles, pepper cress, parsley, mustard, and spinach, with thin\r\nslices of pork. At the bottom of the Squab pie mentioned before was\r\na Squab, or young Cormorant, \"which diffused,\" says Charles\r\nKingsley, \"through the pie, and through the ambient air, a delicate\r\nodour of mingled guano and polecat.\" That \"lovers live by love, as\r\nlarks by leeks,\" is an old saying; and in the classic story of Pyramus\r\nand Thisbe, reference is made to the beautiful emerald green which\r\nthe leaves of the leek exhibit. \"His eyes were as green as leeks.\"\r\nAmong the Welsh farmers, it is a neighbourly custom to attend on a\r\ncertain day and plough the land of a poor proprietor whose means\r\nare limited--each bringing with him one or more leeks for making the\r\nsoup or broth.\r\n\r\nThe _Schalot_, or _Eschalotte_, is another variety of the onion tribe,\r\nwhich was introduced into England by the Crusaders, who found it\r\ngrowing at Ascalon. And Chives (_Allium schoenoprasum_) are an\r\never green perennial herb of the onion tribe, having only a mild,\r\nalliaceous flavour. Epicures consider the Schalot to be the best\r\nseasoning for beef steaks, either by taking the actual bulb, or by\r\nrubbing the plates therewith.\r\n\r\nAgain, as a most common plant in all our hedgerows, is found the\r\nPoor Man's Garlic, or Sauce-alone (_Erisymum alliaria_), from\r\n_eruo_, to cure, a somewhat coarse and most ordinary member of\r\nthe onion tribe, which goes also by the names of \"Jack by the\r\nhedge\" and \"Garlick-wort,\" and belongs to the cruciferous order\r\n[223] of plants. When bruised, it gives out a strong smell of garlic,\r\nand when eaten by cows it makes their milk taste powerfully of\r\nonions. The Ancients, says John Evelyn, used \"Jack by the hedge\"\r\nas a succedaneum to their Scordium, or cultivated Garlic.\r\n\r\nThis herb grows luxuriantly, bearing green, shining, heart-shaped\r\nleaves, and headpieces of small, white-flowering bunches. It was\r\nnamed \"Saucealone,\" from being eaten in the Springtime with meat,\r\nwhilst having so strong a flavour of onions, that it served alone of\r\nitself for sauce. Perhaps (says Dr. Prior) the title \"Jack by the\r\nhedge\" is derived from \"jack,\" or \"jakes,\" an old English word\r\ndenoting a privy, or house of office, and this in allusion to\r\nthe fetid smell of the plant, and the usual place of its growth.\r\n\r\nWhen gathered and eaten with boiled mutton, after having been first\r\nseparately boiled, it makes an excellent vegetable, if picked as it\r\napproaches the flowering state. Formerly this herb was highly\r\nvalued as an antiscorbutic, and was thought a most desirable pot\r\nherb.\r\n\r\n(The _Erysimum officinale_ (Hedge Mustard) and the _Vervain_\r\n(Verbena) make Count Mattaei's empirical nostrum _Febrifugo_: but\r\nthis _Erysimum_ is not the same plant as the Jack by the hedge.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe Gooseberry (_Ribes grossularia_) gets its name from _kruesbar_,\r\nwhich signifies a cross, in allusion to the triple spine of the fruit\r\nor berry, which is commonly cruciform. This is a relic of its first\r\nfloral days, preserved like the apron of the blacksmith at Persia,\r\nwhen he came to the throne. The term _grossularia_ implies a\r\nresemblance of the fruit to _grossuli_, small unripe figs.\r\n\r\n[224] Frequently the shrub, which belongs to the same natural order\r\nas the Currant (_Ribes_), grows wild in the hedges and thickets of\r\nour Eastern counties, bearing then only a small, poor berry, and not\r\nsupposed to be of native origin.\r\n\r\nIn East Anglia it is named Fabe, Feap, Thape, or Theab berry,\r\nprobably by reason of a mistake which arose through an incorrect\r\npicture. The Melon, in a well-known book of Tabernaemontanus,\r\nwas figured to look like a large gooseberry, and was headed,\r\n_Pfebe_. And this name was supposed by some wiseacre to be that\r\nof the gooseberry, and thus became attached to the said fruit.\r\nLoudon thinks it signifies Feverberry, because of the cooling\r\nproperties possessed by the gooseberry, which is scarcely probable.\r\n\r\nIn Norfolk, the green, unripe fruit is called Thape, and the\r\nschoolboys in that county well know Thape pie, made from green\r\nGooseberries. The French call the fruit _Groseille_, and the Scotch,\r\nGrosert. It contains, chemically, citric acid, pectose, gum, sugar,\r\ncellulose, albumen, mineral matter, and water. The quantity of\r\nflesh-forming constituents is insignificant. Its pectose, under\r\nheat, makes a capital jelly.\r\n\r\nIn this country, the Gooseberry was first cultivated at the time of the\r\nReformation, and it grows better in Great Britain than elsewhere,\r\nbecause of the moist climate. The original fruit occurred of the hairy\r\nsort, like Esau, as the _Uva crispa_ of Fuschius, in Henry the\r\nEighth's reign; and there are now red, white, and yellow cultivated\r\nvarieties of the berry.\r\n\r\nWhen green and unripe, Gooseberries are employed in a sauce,\r\ntogether with bechamel, and aromatic spices, this being taken with\r\nmackerel and other rich fish, as an acid corrective condiment. Also,\r\nfrom the juice of the [225] green fruit, \"which cureth all\r\ninflammations,\" may be concocted an excellent vinegar.\r\n\r\nGooseberry-fool, which comes to our tables so acceptably in early\r\nsummer, consists of the unripe fruit _foule_ (that is, crushed or\r\nbeaten up) with cream and milk. Similarly the French have a _foule\r\ndes pommes_, and a_ foule des raisins_. To \"play old Gooseberry\"\r\nwith another man's property is conjectured to mean smashing it up,\r\nand reducing it, as it were, to Gooseberry-fool.\r\n\r\nThe young and tender leaves of the shrub, if eaten raw in a salad;\r\ndrive forth the gravel. And from the red Gooseberry may be\r\nprepared an excellent light jelly, which is beneficial for sedentary,\r\nplethoric, and bilious subjects. This variety of the fruit, whether\r\nhairy or smooth, is grown largely in Scotland, but in France it is\r\nlittle cared for.\r\n\r\nThe yellow Gooseberry is richer and more vinous of taste, suiting\r\nadmirably, when of the smooth sort, for making Gooseberry wine;\r\nwhich is choice, sparkling, and wholesome, such as that wherewith\r\nGoldsmith's popular _Vicar of Wakefield_ used to regale Farmer\r\nFlamborough and the blind piper, having \"lost neither the recipe nor\r\nthe reputation.\" They were soothed in return by the touching ballads\r\nof _Johnny Armstrong's Last Good Night_, and _Cruel Barbara\r\nAllen_.\r\n\r\nGooseberry Shows are held annually in Lancashire, and excite keen\r\ncompetition; but after exhibition, the successful berries are \"topped\r\nand tailed,\" so as to disqualify them from being shown elsewhere.\r\nSouthey, in _The Doctor_, speaks about an obituary notice in a\r\nformer Manchester newspaper, of a man who \"bore a severe illness\r\nwith Christian fortitude, and was much esteemed among Gooseberry\r\ngrowers.\" Prizes are given for the [226] biggest and heaviest berries,\r\nwhich are produced with immense pains as to manuring, and the\r\ngrowth of cool chickweed around the roots of the bushes. At the\r\nsame time each promising berry is kept submerged in a shallow\r\nvessel of water placed beneath it so as to compel absorption of\r\nmoisture, and thus to enlarge its size. Whimsical names, such as\r\n\"Golden Lion,\" \"The Jolly Angler,\" and \"Crown Bob,\" etc., are\r\nbestowed on the prize fruit. Cuttings from the parent plant of a prize\r\nGooseberry become in great request; and thus the pedigree scions of\r\na single bush have been known to yield as much as thirty-two\r\npounds sterling to their possessor. The _Gooseberry Book_ is a\r\nregular Manchester annual.\r\n\r\nA berry weighing as heavy as thirty-seven penny-weight has been\r\nexhibited; and a story is told of a Middleton weaver, who, when a\r\nthunder-storm was gathering, lay awake as if for his life, and at the\r\nfirst patter of rain against the window panes, rushed to the rescue of\r\nhis Gooseberry bushes with his bed quilt. Green Gooseberries will\r\nhelp to abate the strange longings which sometimes beset pregnant\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn Devon the rustics call Gooseberries \"Deberries,\" and in Sussex\r\nthey are familiarly known to village lads as Goosegogs.\r\n\r\nAn Irish cure for warts is to prick them with a Gooseberry thorn\r\npassed through a wedding ring.\r\n\r\nBy some subtle bodily action wrought through a suggestion made to\r\nthe mind, warts undoubtedly disappear as the result of this and\r\nmany another equally trivial proceeding; which being so, why not\r\nthe more serious skin affections, and larger morbid growths?\r\n\r\nThe poet Southey wrote a _Pindaric Ode upon a Gooseberry_ [227]\r\nPie, beginning \"Gooseberry Pie is best,\" with the refrain:--\r\n\r\n     \"And didst thou scratch thy tender arms,\r\n     Oh, Jane I that I should dine\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEFOOT.\r\n\r\nAmong Curative Simples, the Goosefoot, or Chenopod order of\r\nBritish plants, contributes two useful herbs, the _Chenopodium\r\nbonus Henricus_ (Good King Henry), and the _Chenopodium\r\nvulvaria_ (Stinking Goosefoot).\r\n\r\nThis tribe derives its distinctive title from the Greek words,\r\n_cheen_, a goose, and _pous_, a foot, in allusion to the resemblance\r\nborne by its leaves to the webbed members of that waddling bird\r\nwhich raw recruits are wont to bless for their irksome drill of the\r\ngoose-step. Incidentally, it may be said that goosegrease, got from\r\nthe roasted bird, is highly emollient, and very useful in clysters;\r\nit also proves easily emetic.\r\n\r\nThe Goosefoot herbs are common weeds in most temperate climates,\r\nand grow chiefly in salt marshes, or on the sea-shore. Other plants\r\nof this tribe are esculent vegetables, as the Spinach, Beet,\r\nand Orach. They all afford \"soda\" in abundance.\r\n\r\nThe _Good King Henry_ (Goosefoot) grows abundantly in waste\r\nplaces near villages, being a dark green, succulent plant, about a\r\nfoot high, with thickish arrow-shaped leaves, which are cooked as\r\nspinach, especially in Lincolnshire. It is sometimes called Blite,\r\nfrom the Greek _bliton_, insipid; and, as Evelyn says, in his\r\n_Acetaria_, \"it is well named, being insipid enough.\"\r\n\r\nWhy the said Goosefoot has been named \"Good King Henry,\" or,\r\n\"Good King Harry,\" is a disputed point. A French writer declares\r\n\"this humble plant which grows on our plains without culture will\r\nconfer a more lasting [228] duration on the memory of _Henri\r\nQuatre_ than the statue of bronze placed on the Pont Neuf, though\r\nfenced with iron, and guarded by soldiers.\" Dodoeus says the\r\nappellation was given to distinguish the plant from another, a\r\npoisonous one, called _Malus Henricus_, \"Bad Henry.\" Other\r\nauthors have referred it to our Harry the Eighth, and his sore legs,\r\nfor which the leaves were applied as a remedy; but this idea does\r\nnot seem of probable correctness. Frowde tells us \"the constant\r\nirritation of his festering legs made his terrible temper still more\r\ndreadful. Warned of his approaching dissolution; and consumed\r\nwith the death-thirst, he called for a cup of white wine, and, turning\r\nto one of his attendants; cried, 'All is lost!'--and these were his\r\nlast words.\" The substantive title, _Henricus_, is more likely derived\r\nfrom \"heinrich,\" an elf or goblin, as indicating certain magical\r\nvirtues in the herb.\r\n\r\nIt is further known as English Marquery, or Mercury, and _Tota bona_;\r\nor, Allgood, the latter from a conceit of the rustics that it will\r\ncure all hurts; \"wherefore the leaves are now a constant plaster\r\namong them for every green wound.\" It bears small flowers of\r\nsepals only, and is grown by cottagers as a pot herb. The young\r\nshoots peeled and boiled may be eaten as asparagus, and are gently\r\nlaxative. The leaves are often made into broth, being applied also\r\nexternally by country folk to heal old ulcers; and the roots are given\r\nto sheep having a cough.\r\n\r\nBoth here and in Germany this Goosefoot is used for feeding\r\npoultry, and it has hence acquired the sobriquet of Fat-hen.\r\n\r\nThe term, English Mercury, has been given because of its excellent\r\nremedial qualities against indigestion, and bears out the proverb:\r\n\"Be thou sick or whole, put [229] Mercury in thy koole.\" Poultices\r\nmade from the herb are applied to cleanse and heal chronic sores,\r\nwhich, as Gerard teaches, \"they do scour and mundify.\" Certain\r\nwriters associate it with our _good_ King Henry the Sixth. There is\r\nmade in America, from an allied plant, the oak-leaved Goosefoot\r\n(_Chenopodium glaucum_), or from the aphis which infests it, a\r\nmedicinal tincture used for expelling round worms.\r\n\r\nThe Stinking Goosefoot, called therefore, _Vulvaria_, and _Garosmus_,\r\ngrows often on roadsides in England, and is known as Dog's\r\nOrach. It is of a dull, glaucous, or greyish-green aspect, and\r\ninvested with a greasy mealiness which when touched exhales a\r\nvery odious and enduring smell like that of stale salt fish, this being\r\nparticularly attractive to dogs, though swine refuse the plant. It has\r\nbeen found very useful in hysteria, the leaves being made into a\r\nconserve with sugar; or Dr. Fuller's famous _Electuarium\r\nhystericum_ may be compounded by adding forty-eight drops of oil\r\nof amber (_Oleum succini_) to four ounces of the conserve. Then a\r\npiece of the size of a chestnut should be taken when needed, and\r\nrepeated more or less often as required. It further promotes the\r\nmonthly flow of women. But the herb is possessed _odoris virosi\r\nintolerabilis_, of a stink which remains long on the hands after\r\ntouching it. The whole plant is sprinkled over with the white,\r\npellucid meal, and contains much \"trimethylamine,\" together with\r\nosmazome, and nitrate of potash; also it gives off free ammonia.\r\nThe title, Orach, given to the Stinking Goosefoot, a simple of a\r\n\"most ancient, fish-like smell,\" and to others of the same tribe, is a\r\ncorruption of _aurum_, gold, because their seeds were supposed to\r\ncure the ailment known popularly as the \"yellow jaundice.\" These\r\nplants afford no nutriment, [230] and, therefore, each bears the\r\nname, _atriplex_, not, _trephein_, to nourish:--\r\n\r\n     \"Atriplicem tritum cum nitro, melle, et aceto\r\n     Dicunt appositum calidum sedare podagram\r\n     _Ictericis_ dicitque Galenus tollere morbum\r\n     Illius semen cum vino saepius haustum.\"\r\n\r\n     \"With vinegar, honey, and salt, the Orach\r\n     Made hot, and applied, cures a gouty attack;\r\n     Whilst its seeds for the jaundice, if mingled with wine,\r\n     --As Galen has said--are a remedy fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Orach is cooling,\" writes Evelyn, \"and allays the pituit humors.\"\r\n\"Being set over the fire, neither this nor the lettuce needs any other\r\nwater than their own moisture to boil them in.\" The Orach hails\r\nfrom Tartary, and is much esteemed in France. It was introduced\r\nabout 1548.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOSEGRASS.\r\n\r\n\"Goosey, goosey, gander, whither do ye wander?\" says an old\r\nnursery rhyme by way of warning to the silly waddling birds not to\r\nventure into hedgerows, else will they become helplessly fettered by\r\nthe tough, straggling coils of the Clivers, Goosegrass, or,\r\nHedgeheriff, growing so freely there, and a sad despoiler of\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal Goosegrass (_Galium aparine_), which is a highly\r\nuseful curative Simple, springs up luxuriantly about fields and waste\r\nplaces in most English districts. It belongs to the Rubiaceous order\r\nof plants, all of which have a root like madder, affording a red dye.\r\nThis hardy Goosegrass climbs courageously by its slender, hairy\r\nstems through the dense vegetation of our hedges into open\r\ndaylight, having sharp, serrated leaves, and producing small white\r\nflowers, \"pearking on the tops of the sprigs.\" It is one of the\r\nBedstraw tribe, and bears [231] a number of popular titles, such as\r\nCleavers, Clithers, Robin run in the grass, Burweed, Loveman,\r\nGooseherriff, Mutton chops, Clite, Clide, Clitheren, and Goosebill,\r\nfrom the sharp, serrated leaves, like the rough-edged mandibles of a\r\ngoose.\r\n\r\nIts stalks and leaves are covered with little hooked bristles, which\r\nattach themselves to passing objects, and by which it fastens itself in\r\na ladder-like manner to adjacent shrubs, so as to push its way\r\nupwards in the hedgerows.\r\n\r\nGoosegrass has obtained the sobriquet of Beggar's lice, from\r\nclinging closely to the garments of passers by, as well as because\r\nthe small burs resemble these disgusting vermin; again it is known\r\nto some as Harriff, or, Erriff, from the Anglo-Saxon \"hedge rife,\" a\r\ntaxgather, or robber, because it plucks the wool from the sheep as\r\nthey pass through a hedge; also Grip-grass, Catchweed, and\r\nScratchweed. Furthermore, this Bedstraw has been called Goose-grease,\r\nfrom a mistaken belief that obstructive ailments of geese can\r\nbe cured therewith. It is really a fact that goslings are extremely\r\nfond of the herb.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name, _Aparine_, bears the same meaning, being\r\nderived from the Greek verb, _apairo_, to lay hold of. The generic\r\nterm, _Galium_, comes from the Greek word _gala_, milk, which\r\nthe herb was formerly employed to curdle, instead of rennet.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of this Bedstraw bloom towards August, about the time\r\nof the Feast of the Annunciation, and a legend says they first burst\r\ninto blossom at the birth of our Saviour. Bedstraw is, according to\r\nsome, a corruption of Beadstraw. It is certain that Irish peasant girls\r\noften repeat their \"aves\" from the round seeds of the Bedstraw,\r\nusing them for beads in the absence of a rosary; [232] and hence,\r\nperhaps, has been derived the name Our Lady's Be(a)dstraw. But\r\nstraw (so called from the Latin _sterno_, to strew, or, scatter about)\r\nwas formerly employed as bedding, even by ladies of rank: whence\r\ncame the expression of a woman recently confined being \"in the\r\nstraw.\" Children style the _Galium Aparine_ Whip tongue, and\r\nTongue-bleed, making use of it in play to draw blood from their\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nThis herb has a special curative reputation with reference to\r\ncancerous growths and allied tumours. For open cancers an\r\nointment is made from the leaves and stems wherewith to dress the\r\nulcerated parts, and at the same time the expressed juice of the plant\r\nis given internally. Dr. Tuthill Massy avers that it often produces a\r\ncure in from six to twelve months, and advises that the decoction\r\nshall be drank regularly afterwards in the Springtime.\r\n\r\nDr. Quinlan, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, successfully\r\nemployed poultices made with the fresh juice, and applied three\r\ntimes in the day, to heal chronic ulcers on the legs. Its effects, he\r\nsays, in the most unlikely cases, were decisive and plain to all. He\r\ngave directions that whilst a bundle of ten or twelve stalks is\r\ngrasped with the left hand, this bundle should be cut into pieces of\r\nabout half-an-inch long, by a pair of scissors held in the right hand.\r\nThe segments are then to be bruised thoroughly in a mortar, and\r\napplied in the mass as a poultice beneath a bandage.\r\n\r\nDr. Thornton, in his excellent _Herbal_ (1810), says: \"After some\r\neminent surgeons had failed, he ordered the juice of Cleavers, mixed\r\nwith linseed, to be applied to the breast, in cases of supposed cancer\r\nof that part, with a teaspoonful of the juice to be taken every night\r\nand morning whilst fasting; by which plan, after a short [233] time,\r\nhe dispersed very frightful tumours in the breast.\"\r\n\r\nThe herb is found, on analysis, to contain three distinct acids--the\r\ntannic acid (of galls), the citric acid (of lemons), and the special\r\nrubichloric acid of the plant.\r\n\r\n\"In cancer,\" says Dr. Boyce, \"five fluid ounces of the fresh juice of\r\nthe plant are to be taken twice a day, whilst constantly applying the\r\nbruised leaves, or their ointment, to the sore.\"\r\n\r\nSome of our leading druggists now furnish curative preparations\r\nmade from the fresh herb. These include the _succus_, or juice, to\r\nbe swallowed; the decoction, to be applied as a lotion; and the\r\nointment, for curative external use. Both in England and elsewhere\r\nthe juice of this Goosegrass constitutes one of the Spring juices\r\ntaken by country people for scorbutic complaints. And not only for\r\ncancerous disease, but for many other foul, illconditioned ulcers,\r\nwhether scrofulous or of the scurvy nature, this Goosegrass has\r\nproved itself of the utmost service, its external application being at\r\nall times greatly assisted by the internal use of the juice, or of a\r\ndecoction made from the whole herb.\r\n\r\nBy reason of its acid nature; this Galium is astringent, and therefore\r\nof service in some bleedings, as well as in diarrhoea, and for\r\nobesity.\r\n\r\nGerard writes: \"The herb, stamped with swine's grease, wasteth\r\naway the kernels by the throat; and women do usually make pottage\r\nof Cleavers with a little mutton and oatmeal, to cause leanness, and\r\nto keep them from fatness.\" Dioscorides reported that: \"Shepherds\r\ndo use the herb to take hairs out of the milk, if any remain therein.\"\r\n\r\nConsidered generally, the _Galium aparine_ exercises acid, astringent,\r\nand diuretic effects, whilst it is of [234] special value\r\nagainst epilepsy, and cancerous sores, as already declared;\r\nbeing curative likewise of psoriasis, eczema, lepra, and other\r\ncutaneous diseases. The dose of the authorised officinal juice\r\nis from one to two teaspoonfuls, and from five to twenty grains of\r\nthe prepared extract.\r\n\r\nThe title _Galium_ borne by Bedstraws has been derived from the\r\nGreek _gala_, milk, because they all possess to some extent the\r\npower of curdling milk when added to it. Similarly the appellation\r\n\"Cheese rennet,\" or, Cheese running (from _gerinnen_, to\r\ncoagulate), is given to these plants. Highlanders make special use of\r\nthe common Yellow Bedstraw for this purpose, and to colour their\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nFrom the Yellow Bedstraw (_Galium verum_), which is abundant\r\non dry banks chiefly near the sea, and which may be known by its\r\ndiminutive, puffy stems, and its small golden flowers, closely\r\nclustered together in dense panicles, \"an ointment,\" says Gerard, \"is\r\nprepared, which is good for anointing the weary traveller.\"\r\n\r\nBecause of its bright yellow blossoms, this herb is also named\r\n\"Maid's hair,\" resembling the loose, unsnooded, golden hair of\r\nmaidens. In Henry VIII's reign \"maydens did wear silken callis to\r\nkeep in order their hayre made yellow with dye.\" For a like reason\r\nthe Yellow Bedstraw has become known as \"Petty mugget,\" from\r\nthe French _petit muguet_, a little dandy, as applied in ridicule to\r\neffeminate young men, the _Jemmy Jessamies_, or \"mashers\" of the\r\nperiod. Old herbalists affirmed that the root of this same Bedstraw,\r\nif drunk in wine, stimulates amorous desires, and that the flowers, if\r\nlong smelt at, will produce a similar effect.\r\n\r\nThis is, _par excellence_, the Bedstraw of _our Lady_, who [235]\r\ngave birth to her son, says the legend, in a stable, with nothing but\r\nwild flowers for the bedding.\r\n\r\nThus, in the old Latin hymn, she sings right sweetly:--\r\n\r\n    \"Lectum stravi tibi soli: dormi, nate bellule!\r\n        Stravi lectum foeno molli: dormi, mi animule!\r\n    Ne quid desit sternam rosis: sternam foenum violis,\r\n        Pavimentum hyacinthis; et praesepe liliis.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep, sweet little babe, on the bed I have spread thee;\r\n        Sleep, fond little life, on the straw scattered o'er!\r\n    'Mid the petals of roses, and pansies I've laid thee,\r\n        In crib of white lilies; blue bells on the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOUTWEED.\r\n\r\nA passing word should certainly be given to the Goutweed, or,\r\nGoatweed, among Herbal Simples. It is, though but little regarded,\r\nnevertheless, a common and troublesome garden weed, of the\r\nUmbelliferous tribe, and thought to possess certain curative virtues.\r\nBotanically it is the _OEgopodium podagraria_, signifying, by the\r\nfirst of these names, Goatsfoot, and by the second, a specific power\r\nagainst gout. The plant is also known as Herb Gerard, because\r\ndedicated to St. Gerard, who was formerly invoked to cure gout,\r\nagainst which this herb was employed. Also it has been named Ashweed,\r\nwild Master-wort, and Gout-wort. The herb grows about a foot high,\r\nwith white flowers in umbels, having large, thrice-ternate,\r\naromatic leaves, and a creeping root. These leaves are sometimes\r\nboiled, and eaten, but they possess a strong, disagreeable\r\nflavour. Culpeper says: \"It is not to be supposed that Goutweed hath\r\nits name for nothing; but upon experiment to heal the gout, and\r\nsciatica; as also joint aches, and other cold griefs; _the very bearing\r\nit about one_ [236] _easeth the pains of the gout, and defends him\r\nthat bears it from disease_.\" Hill recommends the root and fresh\r\nbuds of the leaves as excellent in fomentations and poultices for\r\npains; and the leaves, when boiled soft, together with the roots, for\r\napplication about the hip in sciatica.\r\n\r\nNo chemical analysis of the Goutweed is yet on record.\r\n\r\n\"Herbe Gerard groweth of itself in gardens without setting, or\r\nsowing; and is so fruitful in his increase that where once it hath\r\ntaken root, it will hardly be gotten out again, spoiling and getting\r\nevery yeere more ground--to the annoying of better herbes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPES (see also VINE).\r\n\r\nGrapes, the luscious and refreshing fruit of the Vine, possess certain\r\nmedicinal properties and virtues which give them a proper place\r\namong Herbal Simples. The name Vine comes from _viere_, to\r\ntwist, being applied with reference to the twining habits of the\r\nparent stock; as likewise to \"with,\" and \"withy.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit consists of pulp, stones, and skin. Within the pulp is\r\ncontained the grape sugar, which differs in some respects\r\nchemically from cane sugar, and which is taken up straightway into\r\nour circulation when eaten, without having to be changed slowly by\r\nthe saliva, as is the case with cane sugar. Therefore it happens that\r\nthe grape sugar warms and fattens speedily, with a quick repair of\r\nwaste, when the strength and the structures are consumed by fever,\r\nGrapes then being most grateful to the sufferer. But they do not suit\r\ninflammatory subjects at other times, or gouty persons at any time,\r\nas well as cane sugar, which has to undergo slower chemical\r\nconversion before it furnishes heat and [237] sustenance. And in this\r\nrespect, grape sugar closely resembles the glucose, or sweet\r\nprinciple of honey.\r\n\r\nThe fruit also contains a certain quantity of \"fruit sugar,\" which is\r\nchemically identical with cane sugar; and, because of the special\r\nsyrupy juice of its pulp, the Grape adapts itself to quick alcoholic\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nThe important ingredients of Grapes are sugar (grape and fruit), gum,\r\ntannin, bitartrate of potash, sulphate of potash, tartrate of lime,\r\nmagnesia, alum, iron, chlorides of potassium and sodium, tartaric,\r\ncitric, racemic, and malic acids, some albumen, and azotized\r\nmatters, with water.\r\n\r\nBut the wine grower is glad to see his _must_ deposit the greater\r\npart of these chemical ingredients in the \"tartar,\" a product much\r\ndisliked, and therefore named _Sal Tartari_, or Hell Salt; and\r\n_Cremor Tartari_, Hell Scum (Cream of Tartar).\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the vine furnishes oil as well as wine, this being extracted\r\nfrom the grape stones, and reckoned superior to any other sort,\r\nwhether for the table or for purposes of lighting. It has no odour,\r\nand burns without smoke. The stones also yield volatile essences,\r\nwhich are developed by crushing, and which give bouquet to the\r\nseveral wines, whilst the skin affords colouring matter and tannin,\r\nof more or less astringency.\r\n\r\nGrapes supply but little actual nutritious matter for building up the\r\nsolid structures of the body; they act as gentle laxatives; though\r\ntheir stones, and the leaves of the vine, are astringent. These latter\r\nwere formerly employed to stop bleedings, and when dried and\r\npowdered, for arresting dysentery in cattle.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the leaves are used, when young and tender, for enveloping\r\nballs of hashed meat, at good tables. The [238] sap of the vine,\r\nnamed _lacryma_, \"a tear,\" is an excellent application to weak eyes,\r\nand for specs of the cornea. The juice of the unripe fruit, which is\r\nverjuice (as well as that of the wild crabapple), was much esteemed\r\nby the ancients, and is still in good repute for applying to bruises\r\nand sprains.\r\n\r\nWhen taken in any quantity, Grapes act freely on the kidneys, and\r\npromote a flow of urine. The vegetable acids of the fruit become\r\nused up as such, and are neutralised in the system by combining\r\nwith the earthy salts found therein, and they pass off in the urine as\r\nalkaline carbonates. With full-blooded, excitable persons, grapes in\r\nany quantity are apt to produce palpitation, and to quicken the\r\ncirculation for a time. Also with persons of slow and feeble\r\nenergies, having a languid digestion (and especially if predisposed\r\nto acid fermentation in the stomach), Grapes are apt to disagree.\r\nThey send their glucose straightway into the circulation combined\r\nwith acids found in the stomach, and create considerable distress of\r\nheartburn and dyspepsia. \"Thus,\" says Dr. King Chambers, \"is\r\ngenerated acidity of the stomach, parent of gout, and of all its\r\nhideous crew.\" Likewise wine, especially if sweet, new, or\r\nfull-bodied, when taken by such persons at a meal, is absorbed but\r\nslowly by the stomach, and much of the sugar, with some alcohol,\r\nbecomes converted by fermentation into acetic acid, which further\r\ncauses the oily ingredients in the food which has been swallowed to\r\nturn rancid. \"Things sweet to taste prove to digestion sour.\" But\r\notherwise, with a person in good health, and not given to gout or\r\nrheumatism, Grapes are an excellent food for supplying warmth as\r\ncombustion material, by their ready-made sugar; whilst the essential\r\nflavours of the fruit are cordial, and [239] whilst a surplus of the\r\nglucose serves to form fat for storage.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the _Grape-cure_, is pursued in the Tyrol, in\r\nBavaria, on the banks of the Rhine, and elsewhere--the sick person\r\nbeing ordered to eat from three to six pounds of grapes a day. But\r\nthe relative proportions of the sugar and acids in the various kinds\r\nof grapes have important practical bearings on the results obtained,\r\ndetermining whether wholesome purgation shall follow, or whether\r\ntonic and fattening effects shall be produced. In the former case,\r\nsufferers from sluggish liver and torpid biliary functions, with\r\npassive local congestions, will benefit most by taking the grapes not\r\nfully ripe, and not completely sweet; whilst in the latter instance,\r\nthose invalids will gain special help from ripe and sweet grapes,\r\nwho require quick supplies of animal heat and support to resist rapid\r\nwaste of tissue, as in chronic catarrh of the lungs, or mucous catarrh\r\nof the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe most important constituent to be determined is the quantity of\r\ngrape sugar, which varies according to the greater or less warmth of\r\nthe climate. Tokay Grapes are the sweetest; next are those of\r\nsouthern France; then of Moselle, Bohemia, and Heidelberg; whilst\r\nthe fruit of the Vine in Spain, Italy, and Madeira, is not commended\r\nfor curative purposes. The Grapes are eaten three, four, or five times\r\na day, during the promenade; those which are not sweet produce a\r\ndiuretic and laxative effect; seeing, moreover, that their reaction is\r\nalkaline, the \"cure\" thereby is particularly suitable for persons\r\ntroubled with gravel and acid gout.\r\n\r\nAfter losses of blood, and in allied states of exhaustion, the\r\nrestorative powers of the grape-cure are often [240] strikingly\r\nexhibited. Formerly, the German doctors kept their patients, when\r\nunder this mode of treatment, almost entirely without other food.\r\nBut it is now found that light, wholesome nourishment, properly\r\nchosen, and taken at regular times, even with some moderate\r\nallowance of Bordeaux wine, may be permitted in useful conjunction\r\nwith the grapes. Children do not, as a rule, bear the grape-cure\r\nwell. One sort of grape, the Bourdelas, or Verjus, being\r\nintensely sour when green, is never allowed to ripen, but its large\r\nberries are made to yield their acid liquor for use instead of vinegar\r\nor lemon juice, in sauces, drinks, and medicinal preparations.\r\n\r\nA vinegar poultice, applied cold, is an effectual remedy for sprains\r\nand bruises, and will arrest the progress of scrofulous enlargements\r\nof bones. It may be made with vinegar and oatmeal, or with the\r\naddition of bread crumb.\"--_Pharmacopoeia Chirurgica_, 1794.\r\n\r\n\"Other fruits may please the palate equally well, but it is the\r\nproud prerogative of the kingly grape to minister also to the mind.\"\r\nThis served to provide one of the earliest offerings to the Deity,\r\nseeing that \"Bread and wine were brought forth to Abraham by\r\nMelchisedec, the Priest of the Most High God.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vine (_Vitis vinifera_) was almost always to the front in the\r\ndesigns drawn by the ancients. Thus, miniatures and dainty little\r\npictures were originally encircled with representations of its foliage,\r\nand we still name such small exquisite illustrations, \"vignettes,\"\r\nfrom the French word, _vigne_.\r\n\r\nThe large family of Muscat grapes get their distinctive title not\r\nbecause of any flavour of musk attached to them, but because the\r\nsweet berries are particularly attractive to flies (muscre), a reason\r\nwhich [241] induced the Romans to name this variety, Vitis apiaria.\r\n\"_On attrape plus de mouches avec le miel qu' avec le vinaigre_\"--\r\nsay the French.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, grape juice is boiled down with quinces into a sort of\r\njam--the progenitor of all marmalades. The original grape vine is\r\nsupposed to have been indigenous to the shores of the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nIf eaten to excess, especially by young persons, grapes will make\r\nthe tongue and the lining membrane of the mouth sore, just as honey\r\noften acts. For this reason, both grapes and honey do good to the\r\naffection known as thrush, with sore raw mouth, and tongue in\r\nulcerative white patches, coming on as a derangement of the health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSES.\r\n\r\nOur abundant English grasses furnish nutritious herbage and\r\nfarinaceous seeds, whilst their stems and leaves prove useful for\r\ntextile purposes. Furthermore, some few of them possess distinctive\r\nmedicinal virtues, with mucilaginous roots, and may be properly\r\nclassed among Herbal Simples.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet-scented Vernal Grass (Anthoxanthum, with Yellow\r\nAnthers) gives its delightfully characteristic odour to newly mown\r\nmeadow hay, and has a pleasant aroma of Woodruff. But it is\r\nspecially provocative of hay fever and hay asthma with persons\r\nliable to suffer from these distressing ailments. Accordingly, a\r\nmedicinal tincture is made (H.) from this grass with spirit of wine,\r\nand if some of the same is poured into the open hand-palms for the\r\nvolatile aroma to be sniffed well into the nose and throat, immediate\r\nrelief is afforded during an attack. At the same time three or four\r\ndrops of the tincture should be taken as a dose with water, and [242]\r\nrepeated at intervals of twenty or thirty minutes, as needed.\r\n\r\nThe flowers contain \"coumarin,\" and their volatile pollen\r\nimpregnates the atmosphere in early summer. The sweet perfume is\r\ndue chiefly to benzoic acid, such as is used for making scented\r\npastilles, or Ribbon of Bruges for fumigation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Couch Grass, Dog Grass, or Quilch (_Triticum repens_)\r\nfound freely in road-sides, fields, and waste places, has been\r\nemployed from remote times as a vulnerary, and to relieve\r\ndifficulties of urination. Our English wheat has been evolved\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nIn modern days its infusion--of the root--is generally regarded as a\r\nsoothing diuretic, helpful to the bladder and kidneys. Formerly, this\r\nwas a popular drink to purify the blood in the Spring. But no special\r\nconstituents have been discovered in the root besides a peculiar\r\nsugar, a gum-like principle, _triticin_, and some lactic acid. The\r\ndecoction may be made from the whole fresh plant, or from the\r\ndried root sliced, two to four ounces being put in a quart of water,\r\nreduced to a pint by boiling. A wineglassful of this may be given for\r\na dose. It certainly palliates irritation of the urinary passages, and\r\nhelps to relieve against gravel. A liquid extract is also dispensed by\r\nthe druggists, of which from one to two teaspoonfuls are given in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe French specially value this grass for its stimulating fragrancy of\r\nvanilla and rose perfumes in the decoction. They use the Cocksfoot\r\nGrass (_Dactylis_), or _pied de poule_, in a similar way, and for the\r\nsame purposes.\r\n\r\nAlso the \"bearded Darnel,\" _Lolium temulentum_ (\"intoxicated\"), a\r\ncommon grass-weed in English cornfields, will produce medicinally\r\nall the symptoms of drunkenness. The French call it _Ivraie_ for this\r\nreason, and [243] with us it is known as Ray Grass, or in some\r\nprovincial districts as \"Cheat.\" The old Sages supposed it to cause\r\nblindness, hence with the Romans, _lolio victitare_, to live on\r\nDarnel, was a phrase applied to a dim-sighted person. Gerard says,\r\n\"the new bread wherein Darnell is eaten hot, causeth drunkenness.\"\r\n\r\nFrom _lolium_ the term Lollard given in reproach to the Waldenses,\r\nand the followers of Wickliffe, indicated that they were pernicious\r\nweeds choking and destroying the pure wheat of the gospel. Milne\r\nsays the expression in Matthew xiii. v. 25, would have been better\r\ntranslated \"darnel\" than \"tares.\"\r\n\r\nA general trembling, followed by inability to walk, hindered speech,\r\nand presently profound sleep, with subsequent headache and\r\nvomiting, are the symptoms produced by Darnel when taken in a\r\nharmful quantity. So that medicinally a tincture of the plant may be\r\nexpected, if given in small diluted doses, to quickly dispel\r\nintoxication from alcoholic drinks; also to prove useful for\r\nanalogous congestion of the brain coming on as an illness, and for\r\ndimness of vision. Chemically, it contains an acrid fixed oil, and a\r\nyellow glucoside.\r\n\r\nThere is some reason to suspect that the old custom of using Darnel\r\nto adulterate malt and distilled liquors has not been wholly\r\nabandoned. Farmers in Devonshire are fond of the Ray Grass, which\r\nthey call \"Eaver\" or \"Iver\"; and \"Devon-ever\" is noted likewise in\r\nSomersetshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDSEL.\r\n\r\nCommon Groundsel is so well known throughout Great Britain, that\r\nit needs scarcely any description. It is very prolific, and found in\r\nevery sort of cultivated ground, being a small plant of the Daisy\r\ntribe, but without any [244] outer white rays to its yellow\r\nflower-heads. These are compact little bundles, at first of a dull\r\nyellow colour, until presently the florets fall off and leave the\r\nwhite woolly pappus of the seeds collected together, somewhat\r\nresembling the hoary hairs of age. They have suggested the name\r\nof the genus \"senecio,\" from the Latin _senex_, an old man:--\r\n\r\n    \"Quod canis simili videatur flore capillis;\r\n    Cura facit canos quamvis vir non habet annos.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With venerable locks the Groundsel grows;\r\n    Hard care more quick than years white head-gear shows.\"\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century this herb went by the name of Grondeswyle,\r\nfrom _grund_, ground, and _swelgun_, to swallow, and to this day it\r\nis called in Scotland Grundy Swallow, or Ground Glutton.\r\n\r\nNot being attractive to insects or visited by them the Groundsel is\r\nfertilized by the wind. It flowers throughout the whole year, and is\r\nthe favourite food of many small birds, being thus given to canaries,\r\nand to other domesticated songsters.\r\n\r\nThe weed, named at first \"Ascension,\" is called in the Eastern\r\ncounties by corruption \"Senshon\" and \"Simson.\" Its leaves are fleshy,\r\nwith a bitter saline taste, whilst the juice is slightly acrid, but\r\nemollient. In this country farriers give it to horses for bot-worms,\r\nand in Germany it is employed as a vermifuge for children. A weak\r\ninfusion of the whole plant with boiling water makes a simple and\r\neasy purgative dose, but a strong infusion will act as an emetic. For\r\nthe former purpose two drachms by weight of the fresh plant should\r\nbe boiled in four fluid ounces of water, and the same decoction\r\nserves as a useful gargle for a [245] sore throat from catarrh.\r\nChemically it contains senecin and seniocine.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Simplers the Groundsel formerly held high rank as a\r\nherb of power. Au old herbal prescribes against toothache to \"dig up\r\nGroundsel with a tool that hath no iron in it, and touch the tooth five\r\ntimes with the plant, then spit thrice after each touch, and the cure\r\nwill be complete.\" Hill says \"the fresh roots if smelled when first\r\ntaken out of the ground, are an immediate cure for many forms of\r\nheadache.\" To apply the bruised leaves will serve for preventing\r\nboils, and the plant, if taken as a sallet with vinegar, is good for\r\nsadness of the heart. Gerard says \"Women troubled with the mother\r\n(womb) are much eased by baths made of the leaves, and flowers of\r\nthis, and the kindred Ragworts.\"\r\n\r\nA decoction of Groundsel serves as a famous application for healing\r\nchapped hands. In Cornwall if the herb is to be used as an emetic\r\nthey strip it upwards, if for a purgative downwards. \"Lay by your\r\nlearned receipts,\" writes Culpeper, \"this herb alone shall do the deed\r\nfor you in all hot diseases, first safely, second speedily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWTHORN (Whitethorn).\r\n\r\nThe Hawthorn, or Whitethorn, is so welcome year by year as a\r\nharbinger of Summer, by showing its wealth of sweet-scented,\r\nmilk-white blossoms, in our English hedgerows, that everyone rejoices\r\nwhen the Mayflower comes into bloom. Its brilliant haws, or fruit,\r\nlater on are a botanical advance on the blackberry and wild\r\nraspberry, which belong to the same natural order. It has promoted\r\nitself to the possession of a single carpel or seed-vessel to each\r\nblossom, producing a [246] separate fruit, this being a stony apple in\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nBut the word \"haw\" is misapplied, because it really means a\r\n\"hedge,\" and not a fruit; whilst \"hips,\" which are popularly\r\nconnected with \"haws,\" are the fruit-capsules of the wild Dog-rose.\r\nHaws, when dried, make an infusion which will act on the kidneys;\r\nthey are astringent, and serve, as well as the flowers, in decoction,\r\nto cure a sore throat.\r\n\r\nThe Hawthorn bush was chosen by Henry the Seventh for his\r\ndevice, because a small crown from the helmet of Richard the Third\r\nwas discovered hanging thereon. Hence arose the legend \"Cleve to\r\nthy crown though it hangs on a bush.\" In some districts it is called\r\nHazels, Gazels, and Halves; and in many country places the\r\nvillagers believe that the blossom of the Hawthorn still bears the\r\nsmell of the great plague of London. It was formerly thought to be\r\nscathless--a tree too sacred to be touched.\r\n\r\nBotanically, the Hawthorn is called _Cratoegus oxyacantha_, these\r\nnames signifying _kratos_, strength or hardness (of the wood); and\r\n_oxus_, sharp--_akantha_, a thorn. It is the German _Hage-dorn_ or\r\nHedge thorn, showing that from a very early period in the history of\r\nthe Germanic races, their land was divided into plots by means of\r\nhedges.\r\n\r\nThe Hawthorn is also named Whitethorn, from the whiteness of its\r\nrind; and Quickset from its growing in a hedge as a \"quick\" or living\r\nshrub, when contrasted with a paling of dead wood. An old English\r\nname for the buds of the Hawthorn when just expanding, was\r\nLadies' Meat; and in Sussex it is called the Bread and Cheese tree.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of England charms or incantations are [247]\r\nemployed to prevent a thorn from festering in the flesh, as:--\r\n\r\n    \"Happy the man that Christ was born,\r\n    He was crowned with a thorn,\r\n    He was pierced through the skin\r\n    For to let the poison in;\r\n    But His five wounds, so they say,\r\n    Closed before He passed away;\r\n    In with healing, out with thorn!\r\n    Happy man that Christ was born.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers are fertilised for the most part by carrion insects, and a\r\ncertain undertone of decomposition may be detected (says Grant\r\nAllen) by keen nostrils in the scent of the Mayflower. It is this\r\ncurious element, in what seems otherwise a pure and delicious\r\nperfume, which attracts the meat-eating insects, or rather those\r\ninsects which lay their eggs and hatch out their larvae in decaying\r\nanimal matter. The meat-fly comes first abroad just at the time when\r\nthe Mayblossom breaks into bloom.\r\n\r\nA Greek bride was sometimes decked with a sprig of Hawthorn, as\r\nemblematic of a flowery future, with thorns intermingled. It is\r\nsupposed that \"the Jewes maden,\" for our Saviour, \"a croune of the\r\nbranches of Albespyne, that is, Whitethorn, that grew in the same\r\ngarden, and therefore hath the Whitethorn many vertues\" being\r\ncalled in France _l'epine noble_.\r\n\r\nThe shadows in the moon are popularly thought to represent a man\r\nladen with a bundle of thorns in punishment of theft:--\r\n\r\n    \"Rusticus in luna quem sarcina deprimit una,\r\n    Monstrat per spinas nulli prodesse rapinas.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A thievish clown by cruel thorns opprest\r\n    Shows in the moon that honesty pays best.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[248] HEMLOCK and HENBANE.\r\n\r\nThe Spotted Hemlock (_Conium maculatum_), and the Sickly-smelling\r\nHenbane (_Hyoscyamus niger_), are plants of common wild growth\r\nthroughout England, especially the former, and are well known\r\nto everyone familiar with our Herbal Simples. But each is so\r\nhighly narcotic as a medicine, and yet withal so safely useful\r\nexternally to allay pain, as well as to promote healing, that their\r\noutward remedial forms of application must not be overlooked\r\namong our serviceable herbs. Nevertheless, for internal\r\nadministration, these herbs lie altogether beyond the pale of\r\ndomestic uses, except in the hands of a doctor.\r\n\r\nThe Hemlock is an umbelliferous plant of frequent growth in our\r\nhedges and roadsides, with tall, hollow stalks, powdered blue at the\r\nbottom, whilst smooth and splashed about with spotty streaks of a\r\nreddish purple. It possesses foliage resembling that of the garden\r\ncarrot, but feathery and more delicately divided.\r\n\r\nThe name has been got from _healm_, or _haulm_, straw, and _leac_,\r\na plant, because of the dry hollow stalks which remain after\r\nflowering is done. In Kent and Essex, the Hemlock is called\r\nKecksies, and the stalks are spoken of as Hollow Kecksies.\r\n\r\nKeckis, or Kickes, of Humblelockis are mentioned by our oldest\r\nherbalists. In a book about herbs, of the fourteenth century, two\r\nsorts of Hemlock are specified--one being the Grete Homeloc,\r\nwhich is called \"Kex,\" or \"Wode Whistle,\" being of no use except\r\nfor poor men's fuel, and children's play.\r\n\r\nBotanically, it bears the name of _Conium maculatum_ (spotted),\r\nthe first of these words coming from the Greek, _konos_, a top, and\r\nhaving reference to the giddiness which the juice of hemlock causes\r\ntoxically in the [249] human brain. The unripe fruit of this plant\r\npossesses its peculiar medicinal properties in a greater degree than\r\nany other part, and the juice expressed therefrom is more reliably\r\nmedicinal than the tincture made with spirit of wine, from the whole\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nSoil, situation, and the time of year, materially affect the potency of\r\nHemlock. Being a biennial plant, it is not poisonous in this country\r\nto cattle during the first year, if they eat its leaves.\r\n\r\nThe herb is always uncertain of action unless gathered of the true\r\n\"maculatum\" sort, when beginning to flower. Its juice should be\r\nthickened in a water bath, or the leaves carefully dried, and kept in a\r\nwell-stoppered bottle, not exposed to the light. Cole says, \"if asses\r\nchance to feed on Hemlock, they will fall so fast asleep that they\r\nseem to be dead, insomuch that some, thinking them to be dead\r\nindeed, have flayed off their skins; yet after the Hemlock had done\r\noperating they had stirred and wakened out of their sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe dried leaves of the plant, if put into a small bag, and steeped in\r\nboiling water for a few minutes, and then applied hot to a gouty\r\npart, will quickly relieve the pain; also, they will help to soften the\r\nhard concretions which form about gouty joints. If the fresh juice of\r\nthe Hemlock is evaporated to a thick syrup, and mixed with lanoline\r\n(the fat of sheep's wool), to make an ointment, it will afford\r\nwonderful relief to severe itching within and around the fundament;\r\nbut it must be thoroughly applied. For a poultice some of this\r\nthickened juice may be added to linseed meal and boiling water,\r\npreviously mixed well together.\r\n\r\nConium plasters were formerly employed to dry up the breast milk,\r\nand are now found of service to subdue palpitations of the heart.\r\n\r\n[250] An extract of Hemlock, blended with potash, is kept by the\r\nchemists, to be mixed with boiling water, for inhalation to ease a\r\ntroublesome spasmodic cough, or an asthmatic attack. In Russia and\r\nthe Crimea, this plant is so inert as to be edible; whereas in the\r\nSouth of Europe it is highly poisonous.\r\n\r\nChemically, the toxic action of Hemlock depends on its alkaloids,\r\n\"coniine,\" and \"methyl-coniine.\"\r\n\r\nVinegar has proved useful in neutralising the poisonous effects of\r\nHemlock, and it is said if the plant is macerated or boiled in vinegar\r\nit becomes altogether inert.\r\n\r\nFor inhalation to subdue whooping-cough, three or four grains of\r\nthe extract should be mixed with a pint of boiling water in a suitable\r\ninhaler, so that the medicated vapour may be inspired through the\r\nmouth and nostrils.\r\n\r\nTo make a Hemlock poultice, when the fresh plant cannot be\r\nprocured, mix an ounce of powdered hemlock leaves (from the\r\ndruggist) with three ounces of linseed meal; then gradually add half\r\na pint of boiling water whilst constantly stirring.\r\n\r\nHerb gatherers sometimes mistake the wild Cicely (_Myrrhis\r\nodorata_) for the Hemlock; but this Cicely has a furrowed stem\r\nwithout spots, and is hairy, with a highly aromatic flavour. The\r\nbracts of Hemlock, at the base of the umbels, go only half way\r\nround the stem. The rough Chervil is also spotted, but hairy, and its\r\nstem is swollen below each joint. Under proper medical advice, the\r\nextract and the juice of Hemlock may be most beneficially given\r\ninternally in cancer, and as a nervine sedative.\r\n\r\nThe Hemlock was esteemed of old as _Herba Benedicta_, a blessed\r\nherb, because \"where the root is in the house [251] the devil can do\r\nno harm, and if anyone should carry the plant about on his person\r\nno venomous beast can harm him.\" The Eleusinian priests who were\r\nrequired to remain chaste all their lives, had the wisdom to rub\r\nthemselves with Hemlock.\r\n\r\nPoultices may be made exclusively with the fresh leaves (which\r\nshould be gathered in June) or with the dried leaflets when\r\npowdered, for easing and healing cancerous sores. Baron Stoerck\r\nfirst brought the plant into repute (1760) as a medicine of\r\nextraordinary efficacy for curing inveterate scirrhus, cancer, and\r\nulcers, such as were hitherto deemed irremediable.\r\n\r\nLikewise the _Cicuta virosa_, or Water Hemlock, has proved\r\ncurative to many similar glandular swellings. This is also an\r\numbelliferous plant, which grows commonly on the margins of\r\nditches and rivers in many parts of England. It gets its name from\r\n_cicuta_ (a shepherd's pipe made from a reed), because of its hollow\r\nstems. Being hurtful to cows it has acquired the title of Cowbane.\r\n\r\nThe root when incised secretes from its wounded bark a yellow\r\njuice of a narcotic odour and acrid taste. This has been applied\r\nexternally with benefit for scirrhous cancer, and to ease the pain of\r\nnervous gout. But when taken internally it is dangerous, being likely\r\nto provoke convulsions, or to produce serious narcotic effects.\r\nNevertheless, goats eat the herb with impunity:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nam videre licet pinguescere soepe cicutam,\r\n    Barbigeras pecudes; hominique est acre venenum.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves smell like celery or parsley, these being most toxical in\r\nsummer, and the root in spring. The potency of the plant depends on\r\nits cicutoxin, a principle derived from the resinous constituents, and\r\n[252] which powerfully affects the organic functions through the\r\nspinal cord. It was either this or the Spotted Hemlock, which was\r\nused as the State poison of the Greeks for causing the death of\r\nSocrates.\r\n\r\nFor a fomentation with the Water Hemlock half-a-pound of the fresh\r\nleaves, or three ounces of the dried leaves should be boiled in three\r\npints of water down to a quart; and this will be found very helpful\r\nfor soothing and healing painful cancerous, or scrofulous sores.\r\nAlso the juice of the herb mixed with hot lard, and strained, will\r\nserve a like useful purpose.\r\n\r\nFor pills of the herb take of its inspissated juice half-an-ounce, and\r\nof the finely powdered plant enough when mixed together to make\r\nfrom forty to sixty pills. Then for curing cancer, severe scrofula,\r\nor syphilitic sores, give from one to twenty of these pills in\r\ntwenty-four hours (_Pharmacopeia Chirurgica_, 1794).\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the plant will serve when carefully used, to relieve\r\nnervous and sick headache. If the fresh, young, tender leaves are\r\nworn under the soles of the feet, next the skin, and are renewed once\r\nduring the day, they will similarly assuage the discomfort of a\r\nnervous headache. The oil with which the herb abounds is not\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nThe _Black Henbane_ grew almost everywhere about England, in\r\nGerard's day, by highways, in the borders of fields, on dunghills,\r\nand in untoiled places. But now it has become much less common as\r\na rustic herb in this country. We find it occasionally in railway\r\ncuttings, and in rubbish on waste places, chiefly on chalky ground,\r\nand particularly near the sea. The plant is biennial, rather large,\r\nand dull of aspect, with woolly sea-green leaves, and bearing\r\nbell-shaped flowers of a lurid, creamy colour, streaked and spotted\r\nwith purple. It [253] is one of the Night-shade tribe, having a heavy,\r\noppressive, sub-fetid odour, and being rather clammy to the touch.\r\nThis herb is also called Hogsbean, and its botanical name,\r\n_Hyoscyamus_, signifies \"the bean of the hog,\" which animal eats it\r\nwith impunity, though to mankind it is a poisonous plant. It has\r\nbeen noticed in Sherwood Forest, that directly the turf is pared\r\nHenbane springs up.\r\n\r\n\"To wash the feet,\" said Gerard, \"in a decoction of Henbane, as also\r\nthe often smelling to the flowers, causeth sleep.\" Similarly famous\r\nanodyne necklaces were made from the root, and were hung about\r\nthe necks of children to prevent fits, and to cause an easy breeding\r\nof the teeth. From the leaves again was prepared a famous sorcerer's\r\nointment. \"These, the seeds, and the juice,\" says Gerard, \"when\r\ntaken internally, cause an unquiet sleep, like unto the sleep of\r\ndrunkenness, which continueth long, and is deadly to the patient.\"\r\n\r\nThe herb was known to the ancients, being described by Dioscorides\r\nand Celsus. Internally, it should only be prescribed by a physician,\r\nand is then of special service for relieving irritation of the bladder,\r\nand to allay maniacal excitement, as well as to subdue spasm.\r\n\r\nThe fresh leaves crushed, and applied as a poultice, will quickly\r\nrelieve local pains, as of gout or neuralgia. In France the plant is\r\ncalled _Jusquiame_, and in Germany it is nicknamed Devil's-eye.\r\n\r\nThe chemical constituents of Henbane are \"hyoscyamine,\" a volatile\r\nalkaloid, with a bitter principle, \"hyoscypricin\" (especially just\r\nbefore flowering), also nitrate of potash, which causes the leaves,\r\nwhen burnt, to sparkle with a deflagration, and other inorganic salts.\r\nThe seeds contain a whitish, oily albumen.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and viscid stem are produced only in [254] each second\r\nyear. The juice when dropped into the eye will dilate the pupil.\r\n\r\nDruggists prepare this juice of the herb, and an extract; also, they\r\ndispense a compound liniment of Henbane, which, when applied to\r\nthe skin-surface on piline, is of great service for relieving obstinate\r\nrheumatic pains.\r\n\r\nIn some rural districts the cottony leaves of Henbane are smoked for\r\ntoothache, like tobacco, but this practice is not free from risk of\r\nprovoking convulsions, and even of causing insanity.\r\n\r\nGerard writes, with regard to the use of the seed of Henbane by\r\nmountebanks, for obstinate toothache: \"Drawers of teeth who run\r\nabout the country and pretend they cause worms to come forth from\r\nthe teeth by burning the seed in a chafing dish of coals, the party\r\nholding his mouth over the fume thereof, do have some crafty\r\ncompanions who convey small lute strings into the water,\r\npersuading the patient that those little creepers came out of his\r\nmouth, or other parts which it was intended to ease.\" Forestus says:\r\n\"These pretended worms are no more than an appearance of worms\r\nwhich is always seen in the smoak of Henbane seed.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Sic dentes serva; porrorum collige grana:\r\n    No careas thure; cum _hyoscyamo_ ure:\r\n    Sic que per embotum fumun cape dente remotum.\"\r\n            _Regimen sanitatis salernitanum_ (Translated 1607).\r\n\r\n    \"If in your teeth you happen to be tormented,\r\n        By means some little worms therein do brede,\r\n    Which pain (if need be tane) may be prevented\r\n        By keeping cleane your teeth when as ye fead.\r\n    Burn Frankonsence (a gum not evil scented),\r\n        Put Henbane into this, and onyon seed,\r\n    And with a tunnel to the tooth that's hollow,\r\n        Convey the smoke thereof, and ease shall follow.\"\r\n\r\n[255] By older writers, the Henbane was called Henbell and\r\nSymphonica, as implying its resemblance to a ring of bells\r\n(_Symphonia_), which is struck with a hammer. It has also been\r\nnamed _Faba Jovis_ (Jupiter's bean). Only within recent times has\r\nthe suffix \"bell\" given place to \"bane,\" because the seeds are fatal to\r\npoultry and fish. In some districts horsedealers mix the seed of\r\nHenbane with their oats, in order to fatten the animals.\r\n\r\nAn instance is narrated where the roots of Henbane were cooked by\r\nmistake at a monastery for the supper of its inmates, and produced\r\nmost strange results. One monk would insist on ringing the large\r\nbell at midnight, to the alarm of the neighbourhood; whilst of those\r\nwho came to prayers at the summons, several could not read at all,\r\nand others read anything but what was contained in their breviaries.\r\n\r\nSome authors suppose that this is the noxious herb intended by\r\nShakespeare, in the play of _Hamlet_, when the ghost of the\r\nmurdered king makes plaint, that:\r\n\r\n    \"Sleeping within mine orchard,\r\n    My custom always of the afternoon,\r\n    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\r\n    With juice of cursed _hebenon_ in a vial,\r\n    And in the porches of mine ear did pour\r\n    The leprous distilment.\"\r\n\r\nBut others argue more correctly that the name used here is a varied\r\nform of that by which the yew is known in at least five of the Gothic\r\nlanguages, and which appears in Marlow and other Elizabethan\r\nwriters, as \"hebon.\" \"This tree,\" says Lyte, \"is altogether venomous\r\nand against man's nature; such as do but only sleepe under the\r\nshadow thereof, become sicke, and sometimes they die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[256] HONEY.\r\n\r\nBeing essentially of floral origin, and a vegetable product endowed\r\nwith curative properties, Honey may be fairly ranked among Herbal\r\nSimples. Indeed, it is the nectar of flowers, partaking closely of\r\ntheir flavours and odours, whilst varying in taste, colour, scent,\r\nand medicinal attributes, according to the species of the plant from\r\nwhich it is produced.\r\n\r\nThe name Honey has been derived from a Hebrew word _ghoneg_,\r\nwhich means literally \"delight.\" Historically, this substance dates\r\nfrom the oldest times of the known world. We read in the book of\r\nGenesis, that the land of Canaan where Abraham dwelt, was\r\nflowing with milk and honey; and in the Mosaic law were statutes\r\nregulating the ownership of bees.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients Honey was used for embalming the dead, and it\r\nis still found contained in their preserved coffins.\r\n\r\nAristoeus, a pupil of Chiron, first gathered Honey from the comb,\r\nand it was the basis of the seasoning of Apicius: whilst Pythagoras,\r\nwho lived to be ninety, took latterly only bread and Honey.\r\n\"Whoever wishes,\" said an old classic maxim, \"to preserve his\r\nhealth, should eat every morning before breakfast young onions\r\nwith honey.\"\r\n\r\nTacitus informs us that our German ancestors gave credit for their\r\ngreat strength and their long lives to the Mead, or Honey-beer, on\r\nwhich they regaled themselves. Pliny tells of Rumilius Pollio, who\r\nenjoyed marvellous health arid vitality, when over a hundred years\r\nold. On being presented to the Emperor Augustus, who enquired\r\nwhat was the secret of his wondrous longevity, Pollio answered,\r\n\"_Interus melle, exterus oleo_, the eating of Honey, and anointing\r\nwith oil.\"\r\n\r\n[257] At the feasts of the gods, described by Ovid, the delicious\r\nHoney-cakes were never wanting, these being made of meal, Honey,\r\nand oil, whilst corresponding in number to the years of the devout\r\nofferer.\r\n\r\nPure Honey contains chemically about seventy per cent. of glucose\r\n(analogous to grape sugar) or the crystallizable part which sinks\r\nto the bottom of the jar, whilst the other portion above, which is\r\nnon-crystallizable, is levulose, or fruit sugar, almost identical with\r\nthe brown syrup of the sugar cane, but less easy of digestion. Hence,\r\nthe proverb has arisen \"of oil the top, of wine the middle, of Honey\r\nthe bottom.\"\r\n\r\nThe odour of Honey is due to a volatile oil associated with a yellow\r\ncolouring matter _melichroin_, which is separated by the floral\r\nnectaries, and becomes bleached on exposure to the sunlight. A\r\nminute quantity of an animal acid lends additional curative value for\r\nsore throat, and some other ailments.\r\n\r\nHoney has certain claims as a food which cane sugar does not\r\npossess. It is a heat former, and a producer of vital energy, both in\r\nthe human subject, and in the industrious little insect which collects\r\nthe luscious fodder. Moreover, it is all ready for absorption\r\nstraightway into the blood after being eaten, whereas cane sugar\r\nmust be first masticated with the saliva, or spittle, and converted\r\nsomewhat slowly into honey sugar before it can be utilised for the\r\nwants of the body. In this way the superiority of Honey over cane\r\nsugar is manifested, and it may be readily understood why grapes,\r\nthe equivalent of Honey in the matter of their sugar, have an\r\nimmediate effect in relieving fatigue by straightway contributing\r\npower and caloric.\r\n\r\nAged persons who are toothless may be supported almost exclusively\r\non sugar. The great Duke of [258] Beaufort, whose teeth were\r\nwhite and sound at seventy, whilst his general health was likewise\r\nexcellent, had for forty years before his death a pound of sugar\r\ndaily in his wine, chocolate, and sweetmeats. A relish for sugar\r\nlessens the inclination for alcohol, and seldom accompanies the\r\nlove of strong drink.\r\n\r\nWith young children, cane sugar is apt to form acids in the stomach,\r\nchiefly acetic, by a process of fermentation which causes pain, and\r\nflatulence, so that milk sugar should be given instead to those of\r\ntender years who are delicate, as this produces only lactic acid,\r\nwhich is the main constituent of digestive gastric juice.\r\n\r\nWhen examined under a microscope Honey exhibits in addition to\r\nits crystals (representing glucose, or grape sugar), pollen-granules of\r\nvarious forms, often so perfect that they may be referred to the\r\nparticular plants from which the nectar has been gathered.\r\n\r\nAs good Honey contains sugar in a form suitable for such quick\r\nassimilation, it should be taken generally in some combination less\r\neasily absorbed, otherwise the digestion may be upset by too speedy\r\na glut of heat production, and of energy. Therefore the bread and\r\nHoney of time-honoured memory is a sound form of sustenance, as\r\nlikewise, the proverbial milk and Honey of the Old Testament. This\r\nmay be prepared by taking a bowl of new milk, and breaking into it\r\nsome light wheaten bread, together with some fresh white\r\nHoneycomb. The mixture will be found both pleasant and easy of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers concocted from Honey boiled with water and\r\nexposed to the sun (after adding chopped raisins, lemon peel, and\r\nother matters) a famous fermented drink, called mead, and this was\r\ntermed metheglin (_methu_, wine, and _aglaion_, splendid) when\r\nthe finer [261] Honey was used, and certain herbs were added so as\r\nto confer special flavours.\r\n\r\n    \"Who drank very hard the whole night through\r\n    Cups of strong mead, made from honey when new,\r\n    Metheglin they called it, a mighty strong brew,\r\n    Their whistles to wet for the morrow.\"\r\n\r\nLikewise, the old Teutons prepared a Honey wine, (hydromel), and\r\nmade it the practice to drink this for the first thirty days after\r\nmarriage; from which custom has been derived the familiar\r\nHoneymoon, or the month after a wedding.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was particularly fond of mead, and had it made\r\nevery year according to a special recipe of her own, which included\r\nthe leaves of sweet briar, with rosemary, cloves, and mace.\r\n\r\nHoney derived from cruciferous plants, such as rape, ladies' smock,\r\nand the wallflower, crystallizes quickly, often, indeed, within the\r\ncomb before it is removed from the hive; whilst Honey from labiate\r\nplants, and from fruit trees in general, remains unchanged for\r\nseveral months after being extracted from the comb.\r\n\r\nAs a heat producer, if taken by way of food, one pound of Honey is\r\nequal to two pounds of butter; and when cod liver oil is indicated,\r\nbut cannot be tolerated by the patient, Honey may sometimes be\r\nmost beneficially substituted.\r\n\r\nIn former times it was employed largely as a medicine, and applied\r\nexternally for the healing of wounds. When mixed with flour, and\r\nspread on linen, or leather, it has long been a simple remedy for\r\nbringing boils to maturity. In coughs and colds it makes a\r\nserviceable adjunct to expectorant medicines, whilst acting at the\r\nsame time as sufficiently laxative. For sore throats it may be used in\r\ngargles with remarkable benefit; and [260] when mixed with\r\nvinegar it forms the old-fashioned oxymel, always popular against\r\ncolds of the chest and throat.\r\n\r\n\"Honeywater\" distilled from Honey, incorporated with sand, is an\r\nexcellent wash for promoting the growth of the hair, either by itself,\r\nor when mixed with spirit of rosemary. Rose Honey (_rhodomel_)\r\nmade from the expressed juice of rose petals with Honey, was\r\nformerly held in high esteem for the sick.\r\n\r\nBee propolis, or the glutinous resin manufactured by bees for fixing\r\nthe foundations of their combs, will afford relief to the asthmatic by\r\nits fumes when burnt. It consists largely of resin, and yields benzoic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nBasilicon, kingly ointment, or resin ointment, is composed of bees\r\nwax, olive oil, resin, Burgundy pitch, and turpentine. This is said to\r\nbe identical with the famous \"Holloway's Ointment,\" and is highly\r\nuseful when the stimulation of indolent sores is desired.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture of superlative worth is prepared by\r\nHomoeopathic practitioners from the sting of the Honey bee. This\r\nmakes a most valuable and approved medicine for obviating\r\nerysipelas, especially of the head and face; likewise, for a puffy sore\r\nthroat with much swelling about the tonsils; also for dropsy of the\r\nlimbs which has followed a chill, or is connected with passive\r\ninactivity of the kidneys. Ten drops of the diluted tincture, first\r\ndecimal strength, should be given three or four times in the day,\r\nwith a tablespoonful of cold water. This remedy is known as the\r\ntincture of _Apis mellifica_. For making it the bees are seized when\r\nemerging from the hive, and they thus become irritated, being ready\r\nto sting. They are put to death with a few drops of chloroform, and\r\nthen have their Honey-bags severed. These are bruised in a mortar\r\n[261] with glycerine, and bottled in spirit of wine, shaking them for\r\nseveral days, and lastly filtering the tincture.\r\n\r\nBoiling water poured on bees (workers) when newly killed makes\r\nbee-tea, which may be taken to relieve strangury, and a difficult\r\npassage of urine, as likewise for dropsy of the heart and kidneys.\r\nAlso of such bees when dried and powdered, thirty grains will act as\r\na dose to promote a free flow of the urine.\r\n\r\nHoney, especially if old, will cause indigestion when eaten by some\r\npersons, through an excessive production of lactic acid in the\r\nstomach; and a superficial ulceration of the mouth and tongue,\r\nresembling thrush, will ensue; it being at the same time a known\r\npopular fact, that Honey by itself, or when mixed with powdered\r\nborax (which is alkaline) will speedily cure a similar sore state\r\nwithin the mouth arising through deranged health.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as when Soranus lived, the contemporary of Galen (160\r\nA.D.) Honey was declared to be \"an easy remedy for the thrush of\r\nchildren,\" but he gravely attributed its virtues in this respect to the\r\ncircumstance that bees collected the Honey from flowers growing\r\nover the tomb of Hippocrates, in the vale of Tempe.\r\n\r\nThe sting venom of bees has been found helpful for relieving\r\nrheumatic gout in the hands, and elsewhere through toxicating the\r\ntender and swollen limbs by means of lively bees placed over the\r\nparts in an inverted tumbler, and then irritating the insects so as to\r\nmake them sting. A custom prevails in Malta of inoculation by\r\nfrequent bee stinging, so as to impart at length a protective\r\nimmunity against rheumatism, this being confirmatory of the fact\r\nknown to beekeepers elsewhere, that after exposure to attacks from\r\nbees, often repeated [262] throughout a length of time, most persons\r\nwill acquire a convenient freedom from all future disagreeable\r\neffects. An Austrian physician has based on these methods an\r\ninfallible cure for acute rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIn Shakespeare's _Twelfth Night_, Sir Toby Belch asks to have a\r\n\"song for sixpence,\" the third verse of which has been thought to\r\nrun thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"The King was in his counting house\r\n    Counting out his money,\r\n    The Queen was in the parlour\r\n    Eating bread and Honey.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Mel mandit, panemque, morans regina culina,\r\n    Dulcia plebeia non comedenda nuru.\"\r\n\r\nA plain cake, currant or seed, made with Honey in place of sugar is\r\na pleasant addition to the tea-table and a capital preventive of\r\nconstipation.\r\n\r\n\"All kinds of precious stones cast into Honey become more brilliant\r\nthereby,\" says St. Francis de Sales in _The Devout Life_, 1708,\r\n\"and all persons become more acceptable when they join devotion\r\nto their graces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOP.\r\n\r\nThe Hop (_Humulus lupulus_) belongs to the Nettle tribe (_Cannabineoe_)\r\nof plants, and grows wild in our English hedges and copses; but\r\nthen it bears only male flowers. When cultivated it produces\r\nthe female catkins, or strobiles which are so well known as\r\nHops, and are so largely used for brewing purposes.\r\n\r\nThe plant gets its first name _Humulus_ from _humus_, the rich\r\nmoist ground in which it chooses to grow, and its affix _lupulus_\r\nfrom the Latin _lupus_ a wolf, because (as Pliny explained), when\r\nproduced among osiers, it [263] strangles them by its light climbing\r\nembraces as the wolf does a sheep.\r\n\r\nThe word Hop comes from the Anglo-saxon _hoppan_ to climb.\r\nThe leaves and the flowers afford a fine brown dye, and paper has\r\nbeen made from the bine, or stalk, which sprouts in May, and soon\r\ngrows luxuriantly; as said old Tusser (1557):--\r\n\r\n    \"Get into thy Hop-yard, for now it is time\r\n    To teach Robin Hop on his pole how to climb.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hop, says Cockayne, was known to the Saxons, and they called\r\nit the _Hymele_, a name enquired-for in vain among Hop growers\r\nin Worcestershire and Kent.\r\n\r\nHops were first brought to this country from Flanders, in 1524:--\r\n\r\n    \"Turkeys, Carp, Hops, Pickerel, and Beer,\r\n    Came into England all in one year.\"\r\n\r\nSo writes old Izaak Walton! Before Hops were used for improving\r\nand preserving beer our Saxon ancestors drank a beverage made\r\nfrom malt, but clarified in a measure with Ground Ivy which is\r\nhence named Ale-hoof. This was a thick liquor about which it was\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nil spissius est dum bibitur; nil clarius dum mingitur,\r\n    Unde constat multas faeces in ventre relinqui.\"\r\n\r\nThe Picts made beer from heather, but the secret of its manufacture\r\nwas lost when they became exterminated, since it had never been\r\ndivulged to strangers. Kenneth offered to spare the life of a father,\r\nwhose son had been just slain, if he would reveal the method; but,\r\nthough pardoned, he refused persistently. The inhabitants of Tola,\r\nJura, and other outlying districts, now brew a potable beer by\r\nmixing two-thirds of heath tops with one of malt. Highlanders think\r\nit very lucky to [264] find the white heather, which is the badge of\r\nthe Captain of Clan Ronald.\r\n\r\nAt first Hops were unpopular, and were supposed to engender\r\nmelancholy. Therefore Henry the Eighth issued an injunction to\r\nbrewers not to use them. \"Hops,\" says John Evelyn in his\r\n_Pomona_, 1670, \"transmuted our wholesome ale into beer, which\r\ndoubtless much altered our constitutions. This one ingredient, by\r\nsome suspected not unworthily, preserves the drink indeed, but\r\nrepays the pleasure with tormenting diseases, and a shorter life.\"\r\n\r\nHops, such as come into the market, are the chaffy capsules of the\r\nseeds, and turn brown early in the autumn. They possess a heavy\r\nfragrant aromatic odour, and a very bitter pungent taste. The yellow\r\nglands at the base of the scales afford a volatile strong-smelling oil,\r\nand an abundant yellow powder which possesses most of the virtues\r\nof the plant. Our druggists prepare a tincture from the strobiles with\r\nspirit of wine, and likewise a thickened extract.\r\n\r\nAgain, a decoction of the root is esteemed by some as of equal\r\nbenefit with Sarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nThe lassitude felt in hot weather at its first access, or in early\r\nspring, may be well met by an infusion of the leaves, strobiles and\r\nstalks as Hop tea, taken by the wineglassful two or three times in\r\nthe day, whilst sluggish derangements of the liver and spleen may be\r\nbenefited thereby.\r\n\r\n_Lupulin_, the golden dust from the scales (but not the pollen of the\r\nanthers, as some erroneously suppose), is given in powder, and acts\r\nas a gentle sedative if taken at bedtime. This is specific against\r\nsexual irritability and its attendant train of morbid symptoms, with\r\nmental depression and vital exhaustion. It contains [265] \"lupulite,\"\r\na volatile oil, and a peculiar resin, which is somewhat acrid, and\r\npenetrating of taste.\r\n\r\nEach of the Simples got from the Hop will allay pain and conduce to\r\nsleep; they increase the firmness of the pulse, and reduce its\r\nfrequency.\r\n\r\nAlso if applied externally, Hops as a poultice, or when steeped in a\r\nbag, in very hot water as a stupe, will relieve muscular rheumatism,\r\nspasm, and bruises.\r\n\r\nHop tea, when made from the flowers only, is to be brewed by\r\npouring a pint of boiling water on an ounce of the Hops, and letting\r\nit stand until cool. This is an excellent drink in delirium tremens,\r\nand will give prompt ease to an irritable bladder. Sherry in which\r\nsome Hops have been steeped makes a capital stomachic cordial. A\r\npillow, _Pulvinar Humuli_, stuffed with newly dried Hops was\r\nsuccessfully prescribed by Dr. Willis for George the Third, when\r\nsedative medicines had failed to give him sleep; and again for our\r\nPrince of Wales at the time of his severe typhoid fever, 1871, in\r\nconjunction then with a most grateful draught of ale which had been\r\nheretofore withheld. The crackling of dry Hop flowers when put\r\ninto a pillow may be prevented by first sprinkling them with a little\r\nalcohol.\r\n\r\nPersons have fallen into a deep slumber after remaining for some\r\ntime in a storehouse full of hops; and in certain northern districts a\r\nwatery extract from the flowers is given instead of opium. It is\r\nuseful to know that for sound reasons a moderate supper of bread\r\nand butter, with crisp fresh lettuces, and light home-brewed ale\r\nwhich contains Hops, is admirably calculated to promote sleep,\r\nexcept in a full-blooded plethoric person. _Lupulin_, the glandular\r\npowder from the dried strobiles, will induce sleep without causing\r\nconstipation, or headache. The dose is from two to four grains at\r\nbedtime [266] on a small piece of bread and butter, or mixed with a\r\nspoonful of milk.\r\n\r\nThe year 1855 produced a larger crop of cultivated Hops than has\r\nbeen known before or since. When Hop poles are shaken by the\r\nwind there is a distant electrical murmur like thunder.\r\n\r\nHop tea in the leaf is now sold by grocers, made from a mixture of\r\nthe Kentish and Indian plants, so as to combine in its infusion, the\r\nrefreshment of the one herb with the sleep-inducing virtues of the\r\nother. The hops are brought direct from the farmers, just as they are\r\npicked. They are then laid for a few hours to wither, after which\r\nthey are put under a rolling apparatus, which ill half-an-hour makes\r\nthem look like tea leaves, both in shape and colour. They are finally\r\nmixed with Indian and Ceylon teas.\r\n\r\nThe young tops of the Hop plant if gathered in the spring and\r\nboiled, may be eaten as asparagus, and make a good pot-herb: they\r\nwere formerly brought to market tied up in small bundles for table\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nA popular notion has, in some places, associated the Hop and the\r\nNightingale together as frequenting the same districts.\r\n\r\nMedicinally the Hop is tonic, stomachic, and diuretic, with\r\nantiseptic effects; it prevents worms, and allays the disquietude of\r\nnervous indigestion. The popular nostrum \"Hop Bitters\" is thus\r\nmade: Buchu leaves, two ounces; Hops, half-a-pound; boil in five\r\nquarts of water, in an iron vessel, for an hour; when lukewarm add\r\nessence of Winter-green (_Pyrola_), two ounces, and one pint of\r\nalcohol. Take one tablespoonful three times in the day, before\r\neating. White Bryony root is likewise used in making the Bitters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[267] HOREHOUND (White and Black).\r\n\r\nThe herb Horehound occurs of two sorts, white and black, in our\r\nhedge-rows, and on the sides of banks, each getting its generic\r\nname, which was originally Harehune, from _hara_, hoary, and\r\n_hune_, honey; or, possibly, the name Horehound may be a\r\ncorruption of the Latin _Urinaria_, since the herb has been found\r\nefficacious in cases of strangury, or difficult making of water.\r\n\r\nThe White Horehound (_Marrubium_) is a common square-stemmed\r\nherb of the Labiate order, growing in waste places, and of\r\npopular use for coughs and colds, whether in a medicinal form, or as\r\na candied sweetmeat. Its botanical title is of Hebrew derivation,\r\nfrom _marrob_, a bitter juice. The plant is distinguished by the\r\nwhite woolly down on its stems, by its wrinkled leaves, and small\r\nwhite flowers.\r\n\r\nIt has a musky odour, and a bitter taste, being a much esteemed\r\nHerbal Simple, but very often spuriously imitated. It affords\r\nchemically a fragrant volatile oil, a bitter extractive \"marrubin,\"\r\nand gallic acid.\r\n\r\nAs a homely remedy it is especially given for coughs accompanied\r\nwith abundant thick expectoration, and for chronic asthma. In\r\nNorfolk scarcely a cottage garden can be found without its\r\nHorehound corner; and Horehound beer is much drunk there by the\r\nnatives. Horehound tea may be made by pouring boiling water on\r\nthe fresh leaves, an ounce to a pint, and sweetening this with honey:\r\nthen a wineglassful should be taken three or four times in the day.\r\nOr from two to three teaspoonfuls of the expressed juice of the herb\r\nmay be given for a dose.\r\n\r\nCandied Horehound is best made from the fresh plant by boiling it\r\ndown until the juice is extracted, [268] and then adding sugar before\r\nboiling this again until it has become thick enough of consistence to\r\npour into a paper case, and to be cut into squares when cool. Gerard\r\nsaid: \"Syrup made from the greene fresh leaves and sugar is a most\r\nsingular remedy against the cough and wheezing of the lungs. It\r\ndoth wonderfully, and above credit, ease such as have been long\r\nsicke of any consumption of the lungs; as hath been often proved by\r\nthe learned physicians of our London College.\"\r\n\r\nWhen given in full doses, an infusion of the herb is laxative. If the\r\nplant be put in new milk and set in a place pestered with flies, it\r\nwill speedily kill them all. And according to Columella, the Horehound\r\nis a serviceable remedy against the Cankerworm in trees: _Profuit et\r\nplantis latices infundere amaros marrubii_.\r\n\r\nThe Marrubium was called by the Egyptian Priests the \"Seed of\r\nHorus\" or \"the Bull's Blood\" and \"the Eye of the Star.\" It was a\r\nprincipal remedy in the Negro Caesar's Antidote for vegetable\r\npoisons.\r\n\r\nThe Black Horehound (_Ballota nigra_), so called from its dark\r\npurple-coloured flowers, is likewise of common growth about our\r\nroadsides and waste places. Its botanical title comes from the Greek\r\n_ballo_, to reject, because of its disagreeable odour, particularly\r\nwhen burnt. The herb is sometimes known as Madwort, being\r\nsupposed to act as an antidote to the bite of a mad dog. In Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher's _Faithful Shepherdess_, we read of:--\r\n\r\n        \"Black Horehound, good\r\n    For Sheep, or Shepherd bitten by a wood-dog's venomed tooth.\"\r\n\r\nIf its leaves are applied externally as a poultice, they will relieve\r\nthe pain of gout, and will mollify angry [269] boils. In Gotha the\r\nplant is valued for curing chronic skin diseases, particularly of a\r\nfungoid character, such as ringworm; also for diseases of cattle.\r\n\"This,\" says Meyrick \"is one of those neglected English herbs which are\r\npossessed of great virtues, though they are but little known, and still\r\nless regarded. It is superior to most things as a remedy in hysteria,\r\nand for low spirits.\" Drayton said (_Polybion_, 1613):--\r\n\r\n    \"For comforting the spleen and liver--get for juice,\r\n    Pale Horehound.\"\r\n\r\nThe Water Horehound (_Lycopus_), or Gipsy wort, which grows\r\nfrequently in our damp meadows and on the sides of streams, yields\r\na black dye used for wool, or silk, and with which gipsies stain their\r\nskins, as well as with Walnut juice. \"This is called Gipsy Wort,\"\r\nsays Lyte, \"because the rogues and runagates, which name\r\nthemselves Egyptians, do colour themselves black with this herbe.\"\r\nEach of the Horehounds is a labiate plant; and this, the water\r\nvariety, bears flesh coloured flowers, whilst containing a volatile\r\noil, a resin, a bitter principle, and tannin. Its medicinal action is\r\nastringent, with a reduced frequency of the pulse, and some gentle\r\nsedative effects, so that any tendency to coughing, etc., will be\r\nallayed. Half-an-ounce of the plant to a pint of boiling water will\r\nmake the infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE RADISH (_Radix_, a Root).\r\n\r\nThe Horse Radish of our gardens is a cultivated cruciferous plant of\r\nwhich the fresh root is eaten, when scraped, as a condiment to\r\ncorrect the richness of our national roast beef. This plant grows wild\r\nin many parts of the country, particularly about rubbish, and the\r\nsides of ditches; yet it is probably an introduction, [270] and not a\r\nnative. Its botanical name, _Cochlearia armoracia_, implies a\r\nresemblance between its leaves and an old-fashioned spoon,\r\n_cochleare_; also that the most common place of its growth is _ar_,\r\nnear, _mor_, the sea.\r\n\r\nOur English vernacular styles the plant \"a coarse root,\" or a \"Horse\r\nradish,\" as distinguished from the eatable radish (root), the\r\n_Raphanus sativus_. Formerly it was named Mountain Radish, and\r\nGreat Raifort. This is said to be one of the five bitter herbs ordered\r\nto be eaten by the Jews during the Feast of the Passover, the other\r\nfour being Coriander, Horehound, Lettuce, and Nettle.\r\n\r\nNot a few fatal cases have occurred of persons being poisoned by\r\ntaking Aconite root in mistake for a stick of Horse radish, and eating\r\nit when scraped. But the two roots differ materially in shape, colour,\r\nand taste, so as to be easily discriminated: furthermore the leaves of\r\nthe Aconite--supposing them to be attached to the root--are not to be\r\nmistaken for those of any other plant, being completely divided to\r\ntheir base into five wedge-shaped lobes, which are again sub-divided\r\ninto three. Squire says it seems incredible that the Aconite\r\nRoot should be mistaken for Horse Radish unless we remember that\r\ncountry folk are in the habit of putting back again into the ground\r\nHorse Radish which has been scraped, until there remain only the\r\ncrown and a remnant of the root vanishing to a point, these bearing\r\nresemblance to the tap root of Aconite.\r\n\r\nThe fresh root of the Horse radish is a powerful stimulant by reason\r\nof its ardent and pungent volatile principle, whether it be taken as a\r\nmedicament, or be applied externally to any part of the body. When\r\nscraped it exhales a nose-provoking odour, and possesses [271] a\r\nhot biting taste, combined with a certain sweetness: but on exposure\r\nto the air it quickly turns colour, and loses its volatile strength;\r\nlikewise, it becomes vapid, and inert by being boiled. The root is\r\nexpectorant, antiscorbutic, and, if taken at all freely, emetic. It\r\ncontains a somewhat large proportion of sulphur, as shown by the\r\nblack colour assumed by metals with which it comes into touch.\r\nHence it promises to be of signal use for relieving chronic\r\nrheumatism, and for remedying scurvy.\r\n\r\nTaken in sauce with oily fish or rich fatty viands, scraped Horse\r\nradish acts as a corrective spur to complete digestion, and at the\r\nsame time it will benefit a relaxed sore throat, by contact during the\r\nswallowing. In facial neuralgia scraped Horse radish applied as a\r\npoultice, proves usefully beneficial: and for the same purpose some\r\nof the fresh scrapings may be profitably held in the hand of the\r\naffected side, which hand will become in a short time bloodlessly\r\nbenumbed, and white.\r\n\r\nWhen sliced across with a knife the root of the Horse radish will\r\nexude some drops of a sweet juice which may be rubbed with\r\nadvantage on rheumatic, or palsied limbs. Also an infusion of the\r\nsliced root in milk, almost boiling, and allowed to cool, makes an\r\nexcellent and safe cosmetic; or the root may be infused for a longer\r\ntime in cold milk, if preferred, for use with a like purpose in view.\r\nTowards the end of the last century Horse radish was known in\r\nEngland as Red cole, and in the previous century it was eaten\r\nhabitually at table, sliced, with vinegar.\r\n\r\nInfused in wine the root stimulates the whole nervous system, and\r\npromotes perspiration, whilst acting likewise as a diuretic. For\r\nrheumatic neuralgia [272] it is almost a specific, and for palsy it has\r\noften proved of service. Our druggists prepare a \"compound spirit of\r\nHorse radish,\" made with the sliced fresh root, orange peel, nutmeg,\r\nand spirit of wine. This proves of effective use in strengthless,\r\nlanguid indigestion, as well as for chronic rheumatism; it stimulates\r\nthe stomach, and promotes the digestive secretions. From one to two\r\nteaspoonfuls may be taken two or three times in the day, with half a\r\nwineglassful of water, at the end of a principal meal, or a few\r\nminutes after the meal. An infusion of the root made with boiling\r\nwater and taken hot readily proves a stimulating emetic. Until cut or\r\nbruised the root is inodorous; but fermentation then begins, and\r\ndevelops from the essential oil an ammoniacal odour and a pungent\r\nhot bitter taste which were not pre-existing.\r\n\r\nChemically the Horse radish contains a volatile oil, identical with\r\nthat of mustard, being highly diffusible and pungent by reason of its\r\n\"myrosin.\" One drop of this volatile oil will suffice to odorise the\r\natmosphere of a whole room, and, if swallowed with any freedom, it\r\nexcites vomiting. Other constituents of the root are a bitter resin,\r\nsugar, starch, gum, albumen, and acetates.\r\n\r\nA mixture of the fresh juice, with vinegar, if applied externally,\r\nwill prove generally of service for removing freckles.\r\n\r\nBergius alleges that by cutting the root into very small pieces\r\nwithout bruising it, and then swallowing a tablespoonful of these\r\nfragments every morning without chewing them, for a month, a cure\r\nhas been effected in chronic rheumatism, which had seemed\r\notherwise intractable.\r\n\r\nFor loss of the voice and relaxed sore throat the [273] infusion of\r\nHorse radish makes an excellent gargle; or it may be concentrated in\r\nthe form of a syrup, and mixed for the same use--a teaspoonful, with\r\na wine-glassful of cold water.\r\n\r\nGerard said of the root: \"If bruised and laid to the part grieved with\r\nthe sciatica, gout, joyntache, or the hard swellings of the spleen and\r\nliver, it doth wonderfully help them all.\" If the scraped root be\r\nmacerated in vinegar, it will form a mixture (which may be\r\nsweetened with glycerine to the taste) very effective against\r\nwhooping cough. In pimply acne of the skin, to touch each papula\r\nwith some of the Compound Spirit of Horse Radish now and again\r\nwill soon effect a general cure of the ailment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSE LEEK (Crassulaceoe).\r\n\r\nThe House Leek (_Sempervivum tectorum_), or \"never dying\"\r\nflower of our cottage roofs, which is commonly known also as\r\nStone-crop, grows plentifully on walls and the tops of small\r\nbuildings throughout Great Britain, in all country districts. It is\r\ndistinguished by its compact rose-shaped arrangement of seagreen\r\nsucculent leaves lying sessile in a somewhat flattened manner, and\r\nby its popularity among country folk on account of these bland juicy\r\nleaves, and its reputed protective virtues. It possesses a remarkable\r\ntenacity of life, _quem sempervivam dicunt quoniam omni tempore\r\nviret_, this being in allusion to its prolonged vitality; for which\r\nreason it is likewise called Ayegreen, and Sengreen (_semper_,\r\ngreen).\r\n\r\nHistory relates that a botanist tried hard for eighteen months to dry a\r\nplant of the House Leek for his herbarium, but failed in this object.\r\nHe afterwards restored it to its first site when it grew again as if\r\nnothing had interfered with its ordinary life.\r\n\r\n[274] The plant was dedicated of old to Thor, or Jupiter, and\r\nsometimes to the Devil. It bore the titles of Thor's beard, Jupiter's\r\neye, Joubarb, and Jupiter's beard, from its massive inflorescence\r\nwhich resembles the sculptured beard of Jove; though a more recent\r\ndesignation is St. George's beard.\r\n\r\n    \"Quem sempervivam dicunt quoniam viret omni\r\n    Tempore--'Barba Jovis' vulgari more vocatur,\r\n    Esse refert similem predictoe Plinius istam.\"\r\n        _Macer_.\r\n\r\nThe Romans took great pleasure in the House Leek, and grew it in\r\nvases set before the windows of their houses. They termed it\r\n_Buphthalmon_, _Zoophthalmon_, and _Stergethron_, as one of the\r\nlove medicines; it being further called _Hypogeson_, from growing\r\nunder the eaves; likewise _Ambrosia_ and _Ameramnos_. The plant\r\nis indigenous to the Greek Islands, being sometimes spoken of as\r\n\"Imbreke\" and \"Home Wort.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been largely planted about the roofs of small houses\r\nthroughout the country, particularly in Scotland, because supposed\r\nto guard against lightning and thunderstorms; likewise as protective\r\nagainst the enchantments of sorcerers; and, in a more utilitarian\r\nspirit, as preservative against decay. Hence the House Leek\r\nis known as Thunderbeard, and in Germany _Donnersbart_ or\r\n_Donderbloem_, from \"Jupiter the thunderer.\"\r\n\r\nThe English name House Leek denotes _leac_ (Anglo-Saxon) a\r\nplant growing on the house; and another appellation of its genus,\r\nsedum, comes from the Latin _sedare_, to soothe, and subdue\r\ninflammations, etc.\r\n\r\nThe thick leaves contain an abundant acidulous astringent juice,\r\nwhich is mucilaginous, and affords malic acid, identical with that of\r\nthe Apple. This juice, in a dose of from one to three drams, has\r\nproved [275] useful in dysentery, and in some convulsive diseases.\r\nGalen extolled it as a capital application for erysipelas and shingles.\r\nDioscorides praised it for weak and inflamed eyes, but in large\r\ndoses it is emetic and purgative.\r\n\r\nIn rural districts the bruised leaves of the fresh plant or its juice\r\nare often applied to burns, scalds, contusions, and sore legs, or to\r\nscrofulous ulcers; as likewise for chronic skin diseases, and\r\nenlarged or cancerous lymphatic glands. By the Dutch the leaves are\r\ncultivated with a dietetic purpose for mixing in their salads.\r\n\r\nWith honey the juice assuages the soreness and ulcerated condition\r\nwithin the mouth in thrush. Gerard says: \"The juice being gently\r\nrubbed on any place stung by nettles, or bees, or bitten by any\r\nvenomous creature, doth presently take away the pain. Being\r\napplied to the temples and forehead it easeth also the headache and\r\ndistempered heat of the brain through want of sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThe juice, moreover, is excellently helpful for curing corns and\r\nwarts, if applied from day to day after they have been scraped. As\r\nParkinson teaches, \"the juice takes away cornes from the toes and\r\nfeet if they be bathed therewith every day, and at night emplastered\r\nas it were with the skin of the same House Leek.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant may be readily made to cover all the roof of a building by\r\nsticking on the offsets with a little moist earth, or cowdung. It bears\r\npurple flowers, and its leaves are fringed at their edges, being\r\nsucculent and pulpy. Thus the erect gay-looking blossoms, in\r\ncontrast to the light green foliage arranged in the form of full blown\r\ndouble roses, lend a picturesque appearance to the roof of even a\r\ncow-byre, or a hovel.\r\n\r\n[276] The House Leek (_Sedum majus_), and the Persicaria Water-pepper\r\n(Arsmart), if their juices be boiled together, will cure a\r\ndiarrhoea, however obstinate, or inveterate. The famous empirical\r\n_anti-Canceroso nostrum_ of Count Mattaei is authoritatively said to\r\nconsist of the _Sedum acre_ (Betony stone-crop), the _Sempervivum\r\ntectorum_ (House Leek), _Sedum telephium_ (Livelong), the\r\n_Matricaria_ (Feverfew), and the _Nasturtium Sisymbrium_ (Water-cress).\r\n\r\nThe _Sedum Telephium_ (Livelong, or Orpine), called also\r\nRoseroot and Midsummer Men, is the largest British species of\r\nStone-crop. Being a plant of augury its leaves are laid out in pairs\r\non St. John's Eve, these being named after courting couples. When\r\nthe leaves are freshly assorted those which keep together promise\r\nwell for their namesakes, and those which fall apart, the reverse.\r\n\r\nThe special virtues of this _Sedum_ are supposed to have been\r\ndiscovered by Telephus, the son of Hercules. Napoleon, at St.\r\nHelena, was aware of its anti-cancerous reputation, which was\r\nfirmly believed in Corsica. The plant contains lime, sulphur,\r\nammonia, and (perhaps) mercury. It remains long alive when hung\r\nup in a room. The designation Orpine has become perversely\r\napplied to this plant which bears pink blossoms, the word having\r\nbeen derived from _Orpin_, gold pigment, a yellow sulphuret of the\r\nmetal arsenic, and it should appertain exclusively to yellow flowers.\r\nThe Livelong _Sedum_ was formerly named Life Everlasting. It\r\nserves to keep away moths.\r\n\r\nDoctors have found that the expulsive vomiting provoked by doses\r\nof the _Sedum acre_ (Betony stone-crop), will serve in diphtheria to\r\nremove such false membrane clinging in patches to the throat and\r\ntonsils, [277] as threatens suffocation: and after this release\r\nafforded by copious vomiting, the diphtheritic foci are prevented\r\nfrom forming again.\r\n\r\nThe _Sedum Acre_ (or Biting Stone-crop) is also named Pepper\r\ncrop, being a cyme, or head of flowers, which furnishes a pungent\r\ntaste like that of pepper. This further bears the names of Ginger (in\r\nNorfolk), Jack of the Buttery, Gold Dust, Creeping Tom, Wall\r\nPepper, Pricket or Prick Madam, Gold Chain, and Biting Mouse\r\nTail. It was formerly said \"the savages of Caledonia use this plant\r\nfor removing the sloughs of cancer.\"\r\n\r\nThe herb serves admirably to make a gargle for scurvy of the gums,\r\nand a lotion for scrofulous, or syphilitic ulcers. The leaves are thick\r\nand very acrid, being crowded together. This and the _Sedums\r\nalbum_ and _reflexum_ were ingredients in a famous worm-expelling\r\nmedicine, or _theriac_ (treacle), which conferred the title\r\n\"Jack of the Buttery,\" as a corruption of \"_Bot. theriaque_.\"\r\n\r\nThe several Stone-crops are so named from _crop_, a top, or bunch\r\nof flowers, these plants being found chiefly in tufts upon walls or\r\nroofs. From their close growth originally on their native rocks they\r\nhave acquired the generic title of _Sedum_, from _sedere_ (to sit).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYSSOP.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated Hyssop, now of frequent occurrence in the herb-bed,\r\nand a favourite plant there because of its fragrance, belongs to the\r\nlabiate order, and possesses cordial qualities which give it rank as a\r\nSimple. It has pleasantly odorous striped leaves which vary in\r\ncolour, and possess a camphoraceous odour, with a warm aromatic\r\nbitter taste. This is of comparatively recent introduction into our\r\ngardens, not having been [278] cultivated until Gerard's time, about\r\n1568, and not being a native English herb.\r\n\r\nThe _Ussopos_ of Dioscorides, was named from _azob_, a holy\r\nherb, because used for cleansing sacred places. Hence it is alluded\r\nto in this sense scripturally: \"Purge me with Hyssop, and I shall be\r\nclean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow\" (Psalm li. 7).\r\nSolomon wrote \"of all trees, from the Cedar in Lebanon to the\r\nHyssop that springeth out of the wall.\" The healing virtues of the\r\nplant are due to a particular volatile oil which admirably promotes\r\nexpectoration in bronchial catarrh and asthma. Hyssop tea is a\r\ngrateful drink well adapted to improve the tone of a feeble stomach,\r\nbeing brewed with the green tops of the herb. The same parts of the\r\nplant are sometimes boiled in soup to be given for asthma. The\r\nleaves and flowers are of a warm pungent taste, and of an agreeable\r\naromatic smell; therefore if the tops and blossoms are reduced to a\r\npowder and added to cold salad herbs they give a comforting cordial\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly made a distilled water of Hyssop, which may\r\nstill be had from some druggists, it being deemed a good pectoral\r\nmedicine. In America an infusion of the leaves is used externally for\r\nthe relief of muscular rheumatism, as also for bruises and\r\ndiscoloured contusions. The herb was sometimes called Rosemary\r\nin the East, and was hung up to afford protection from the evil eye,\r\nas well as to guard against witches.\r\n\r\nTo make Hyssop tea, one drachm of the herb should be infused in a\r\npint of boiling water, and allowed to become cool. Then a\r\nwineglassful is to be given as a dose two or three times in the day.\r\n\r\nOf the essential oil of Hyssop, from one to two drops [279] should\r\nbe the dose. Pliny said: \"Hyssop mixed with figs, purges; with\r\nhoney, vomits.\" If the herb be steeped in boiling water and applied\r\nhot to the part, it will quickly remove the blackness consequent\r\nupon a bruise or blow, especially in the case of \"black\" or\r\nblood-shot eyes.\r\n\r\nParkinson says that in his day \"the golden hyssop was of so pleasant\r\na colour that it provoked every gentlewoman to wear them in their\r\nheads, and on their arms with as much delight as many fine flowers\r\ncan give.\" The leaves are striped conspicuously with white or\r\nyellow; for which reason, and because of their fragrance, the herb is\r\noften chosen to be planted on graves. The green herb, bruised and\r\napplied, will heal cuts promptly. Its tea will assist in promoting the\r\nmonthly courses for women. Hyssop grows wild in middle and\r\nsouthern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Hedge Hyssop (_Gratiola officinalis_), or Water Hyssop, is\r\nquite a different plant from the garden pot-herb, and belongs to the\r\nscrofula-curing order, with far more active medicinal properties than\r\nthe Hyssop proper. The commonly recognized Hedge Hyssop bears\r\na pale yellow, or a pale purple flower, like that of the Foxglove; and\r\nthe whole plant has a very bitter taste. A medicinal tincture (H.) is\r\nmade from the entire herb, of which from eight to ten drops may be\r\ntaken with a tablespoonful of cold water three times in the day. It\r\nwill afford relief against nervous weakness and shakiness, such as\r\noccur after an excessive use of coffee or tobacco. The title\r\n\"gratiola,\" is from _dei gratia_, \"by the grace of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe juice of the plant purges briskly, and may be usefully employed\r\nin some forms of dropsy. Its decoction is milder of action, and\r\nproves beneficial [280] in cases of jaundice. In France the plant is\r\ncultivated as a perfume, and it is said to be an active ingredient in\r\nthe famous _Eau medicinale_ for gout.\r\n\r\nOf the dried leaves from five to twenty-five grains will act as a\r\ndrastic vermifuge to expel worms. The root resembles ipecacuanha\r\nin its effects, and in moderate quantities, as a powder or decoction,\r\nhelps to stay bloody fluxes and purgings. The flowers are sometimes\r\nof a blood-red hue, and the whole plant contains a special essential\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\"Whoso taketh,\" says Parkinson, \"but one scruple of _Gratiola_\r\n(Hedge Hyssop) bruised, shall perceive evidently his effectual\r\noperation and virtue in purging mightily, and that in great\r\nabundance, watery, gross, and slimy tumours.\" _Caveat qui\r\nsumpserit_. On the principle of affinities, small diluted doses of the\r\ntincture, or decoction, or of the dried leaves, prove curative in cases\r\nof fluxes from the lower bowels, where irritation within the\r\nfundament is frequent, and where there is considerable nervous\r\nexhaustion, especially in chronic cases of this sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY, Common (_Araliaceoe_).\r\n\r\nThe clergyman of fiction in the sixth chapter of Dickens' memorable\r\n_Pickwick_, sings certain verses which he styles \"indifferent\" (the\r\nonly verse, by the way, to be found in all that great writer's\r\nstories), and which relate to the Ivy, beginning thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh! a dainty plant is the Ivy green,\r\n    That creepeth o'er ruins old.\"\r\n\r\nThe well known common Ivy (_Hedera helix_), which clothes the\r\ntrunks of trees and the walls of old buildings so picturesquely\r\nthroughout Great Britain, gets its botanical name most probably\r\nfrom the Celtic word _hoedra _[281] \"a cord,\" or from the Greek\r\n_hedra_ \"a seat,\" because sitting close, and its vernacular title from\r\n_iw_ \"green,\" which is also the parent of \"yew.\" In Latin it is termed\r\n_abiga_, easily corrupted to \"iva\"; and the Danes knew it as\r\nWinter-grunt, or Winter-green, to which appellation it may still lay a\r\nrightful claim, being so conspicuously green at the coldest times of\r\nthe year when trees are of themselves bare and brown.\r\n\r\nBy the ancients the Ivy was dedicated to Bacchus, whose statues\r\nwere crowned with a wreath of the plant, under the name Kissos,\r\nand whose worshippers decorated themselves with its garlands. The\r\nleaves have a peculiar faintly nauseous odour, whilst they are\r\nsomewhat bitter, and rough of taste. The fresh berries are rather\r\nacid, and become bitter when dried. They are much eaten by our\r\nwoodland birds in the spring.\r\n\r\nA crown of Ivy was likewise given to the classic poets of\r\ndistinction, and the Greek priests presented a wreath of the same to\r\nnewly married persons. The custom of decorating houses and\r\nchurches with Ivy at Christmastide, was forbidden by one of the\r\nearly councils on account of its Pagan associations. Prynne wrote\r\nwith reference to this decree:--\r\n\r\n    \"At Christmas men do always Ivy get,\r\n    And in each corner of the house it set,\r\n    But why make use then of that Bacchus weed?\r\n    Because they purpose Bacchus-like to feed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ivy, though sending out innumerable small rootlets, like\r\nsuckers, in every direction (which are really for support) is not a\r\nparasite. The plant is rooted in the soil and gets its sustenance\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nChemically, its medicinal principles depend on the special balsamic\r\nresin contained in the leaves and stems, as well as constituting the\r\naromatic gum.\r\n\r\n[282] Ivy flowers have little or no scent, but their yield of nectar is\r\nparticularly abundant.\r\n\r\nWhen the bark of the main stems is wounded, a gum will exude, and\r\nmay be collected: it possesses astringent and mildly aperient\r\nproperties. This was at one time included as a medicine in the\r\nEdinburgh _Pharmacopoeia_, but it has now fallen out of such\r\nauthoritative use. Its chemical principle is \"hederin.\" The gum is\r\nanti-spasmodic, and promotes the monthly flow of women.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the berries will relieve rheumatism, and a decoction\r\nof the leaves applied externally will destroy vermin in the heads of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFresh Ivy leaves will afford signal relief to corns when they shoot,\r\nand are painful. Good John Wesley, who dabbled in \"domestic\r\nmedicine,\" and with much sagacity of observation, taught that\r\nhaving bathed the feet, and cut the corns, and having mashed some\r\nfresh Ivy leaves, these are to be applied: then by repeating the\r\nremedial process for fifteen days the corns will be cured.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Plague of London, Ivy berries were given with\r\nsome success as possessing antiseptic virtues, and to induce\r\nperspiration, thus effecting a remission of the symptoms. Cups made\r\nfrom Ivywood have been employed from which to drink for disorders\r\nof the spleen, and for whooping cough, their method of use\r\nbeing to be kept refilled from time to time with water (cold or\r\nhot), which the patient is to constantly sip.\r\n\r\nIvy gum dissolved in vinegar is a good filling for a hollow tooth\r\nwhich is causing neuralgic toothache: and an infusion of the leaves\r\nmade with cold water, will, after standing for twenty-four hours,\r\nrelieve sore and smarting eyes if used rather frequently as a lotion.\r\nA decoction of the leaves and berries will mitigate a [283] severe\r\nheadache, such as that which follows hard drinking over night. And\r\nit may have come about that from some rude acquaintance with this\r\nfact the bacchanals adopted goblets carved out of Ivywood.\r\n\r\nThis plant is especially hardy, and suffers but little from the smoke\r\nand the vitiated air of a manufacturing town. Chemically, such\r\nmedicinal principles as the Ivy possesses depend on the special\r\nbalsamic resin contained in its leaves and stems; as well as on its\r\nparticular gum. Bibulous old Bacchus was always represented in\r\nclassic sculpture with a wreath of Ivy round his laughing brows; and\r\nit has been said that if the foreheads of those whose potations run\r\ndeep were bound with frontlets of Ivy the nemesis of headache\r\nwould be prevented thereby. But legendary lore teaches rather that\r\nthe infant Bacchus was an object of vengeance to Juno, and that the\r\nnymphs of Nisa concealed him from her wrath, with trails of Ivy as\r\nhe lay in his cradle.\r\n\r\nAt one time our taverns bore over their doors the sign of an Ivybush,\r\nto indicate the excellence of the liquor supplied within. From which\r\nfact arose the saying that \"good wine needs no bush,\" \"_Vinum\r\nvendibile hedera non est opus_.\" And of this text Rosalind cleverly\r\navails herself in _As You Like It_, \"If it be true\" says she, \"that\r\ngood wine needs no bush,\"--\"'tis true that a good play needs no\r\nepilogue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIVY (Ground).\r\n\r\nThis common, and very familiar little herb, with its small Ivy-like\r\naromatic leaves, and its striking whorls of dark blue blossoms\r\nconspicuous in early spring time, comes into flower pretty\r\npunctually about the third or fourth of April, however late or early\r\nthe season may be. Its name is attributed to the resemblance borne\r\n[284] by its foliage to that of the true Ivy (_Hedera helix_). The\r\nwhole plant possesses a balsamic odour, and an aromatic taste, due\r\nto its particular volatile oil, and its characteristic resin, as a\r\nfragrant labiate herb. It remaineth green not only in summer, but\r\nalso in winter, at all times of the year.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest days it has been thought endowed with singular\r\ncurative virtues chiefly against nervous headaches, and for the relief\r\nof chronic bronchitis. Ray tells of a remarkable instance in the\r\nperson of a Mr. Oldacre who was cured of an obstinate chronic\r\nheadache by using the juice or the powdered leaves of the Ground\r\nIvy as snuff: _Succus hujus plantoe naribus attractus cephalalgiam\r\netiam vehementissimam et inveteratam non lenit tantum, sed et\r\npenitus aufert_; and he adds in further praise of the herb:\r\n_Medicamentum hoc non satis potest laudari; si res ex usu\r\noestimarentur, auro oequiparandum_. An infusion of the fresh herb,\r\nor, if made in winter, from its dried leaves, and drank under the\r\nname of Gill tea, is a favourite remedy with the poor for coughs of\r\nlong standing, accompanied with much phlegm. One ounce of the\r\nherb should be infused in a pint of boiling water, and a wineglassful\r\nof this when cool is to be taken three or four times in the day. The\r\nbotanical name of the plant is _Nepeta glechoma_, from _Nepet_, in\r\nTuscany, and the Greek _gleechon_, a mint.\r\n\r\nResembling Ivy in miniature, the leaves have been used in weaving\r\nchaplets for the dead, as well as for adorning the Alestake erected as\r\na sign at taverns. For this reason, and because formerly in vogue for\r\nclearing the ale drank by our Saxon ancestors, the herb acquired the\r\nnames of Ale hoof, and Tun hoof (\"tun\" signifying a garden, and\r\n\"hoof\" or \"hufe\" a coronal or chaplet), [285] or Hove, \"because,\"\r\nsays Parkinson, \"it spreadeth as a garland upon the ground.\" Other\r\ntitles which have a like meaning are borne by the herb, such as \"Gill\r\ngo by the ground,\" and Haymaids, or Hedgemaids; the word \"gill\"\r\nnot only relating to the fermentation of beer, but meaning also a\r\nmaid. This is shown in the saying, \"Every Jack should have his Gill,\r\nor Jill\"; and the same notion was conveyed by the sobriquet\r\n\"haymaids.\" Again in some districts the Ground Ivy is called \"Lizzy\r\nrun up the hedge,\" \"Cat's-foot\" (from the soft flower heads), \"Devil's\r\ncandlesticks,\" \"Aller,\" and in Germltny \"Thundervine,\" also in the\r\nold English manuscripts \"Hayhouse,\" \"Halehouse,\" and \"Horshone.\"\r\nThe whole plant was employed by our Saxon progenitors to clarify\r\ntheir so-called beer, before hops had been introduced for this\r\npurpose; and the place of refreshment where the beverage was sold\r\nbore the name of a \"Gill house.\"\r\n\r\nIn _A Thousand Notable Things_, it is stated, \"The juice of Ground\r\nIvy sniffed up into the nostrils out of a spoon, or a saucer, purgeth\r\nthe head marvellously, and taketh away the greatest and oldest pain\r\nthereof that is: the medicine is worth gold, though it is very cheap.\"\r\n\r\nSmall hairy tumours may often be seen in the autumn on the leaves\r\nof the Ground Ivy occasioned (says Miss Pratt) by the punctures of\r\nthe _cynips glechomoe_ from which these galls spring. They have a\r\nstrong flavour of the plant, and are sometimes eaten by the\r\npeasantry of France. The volatile oil on which the special virtues of\r\nthe Ground Ivy depend exudes from small glandular dots on the\r\nunder surface of the leaves. This is the active ingredient of Gill tea\r\nmade by country persons, and sweetened with honey, sugar, or\r\nliquorice. Also the expressed juice of the herb is [286] equally\r\neffectual, being diaphoretic, diuretic, and somewhat astringent\r\nagainst bleedings.\r\n\r\nGerard says that in his day \"the Ground Ivy was commended against\r\nthe humming sound, and ringing noises of the ears by being put into\r\nthem, and for those that are hard of hearing. Also boiled in mutton\r\nbroth it helpeth weak and aching backs.\" Dr. Thornton tells us in his\r\n_Herbal _(1810) that \"Ground Ivy was at one time amongst the\r\n'cries' of London, for making a tea to purify the blood,\" and Dr.\r\nPitcairn extolled this plant before all other vegetable medicines for\r\nthe cure of consumption. Perhaps the name Ground Ivy was\r\ntransferred at first to the _Nepeta_ from the Periwinkle, about which\r\nwe read in an old distich of Stockholm:--\r\n\r\n    \"Parvenke is an erbe green of colour,\r\n    In time of May he bereth blo flour,\r\n    His stalkes are so feynt and feye\r\n    That nevermore groweth he heye:\r\n    On the grounde he rynneth and growe\r\n    As doth the erbe that _hyth tunhowe_;\r\n    The lef is thicke, schinende and styf\r\n    As is the grene Ivy leef:\r\n    Uniche brod, and nerhand rownde;\r\n    Men call it the _Ivy of the grounde_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Organic Materia Medica_ of Detroit, U.S.A., 1890, it is\r\nstated, \"Painters use the Ground Ivy (_Nepeta glechoma_) as a\r\nremedy for, and a preventive of lead colic.\" An infusion is given\r\n(the ounce to a pint of boiling water)--one wineglassful for a dose\r\nrepeatedly. In the relief which it affords as a snuff made from the\r\ndried leaves to congestive headache of a passive continued sort, this\r\nbenefit is most probably due partly to the special titillating aroma of\r\nthe plant, and partly to the copious defluxion of mucus and tears\r\nfrom the nasal passages, and the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[287] JOHN'S WORT.\r\n\r\nThe wild Saint John's Wort (_Hypericum peiforatum_) is a frequent\r\nplant in our woods and hedgebanks, having leaves studded with\r\nminute translucent vesicles, which seem to perforate their structure,\r\nand which contain a terebinthinate oil of fragrant medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nThe name _Hypericum_ is derived from the two Greek words,\r\n_huper eikon_, \"over an apparition,\" because of its supposed power\r\nto exorcise evil spirits, or influences; whence it was also formerly\r\ncalled _Fuga doemoniorum_, \"the Devil's Scourge,\" \"the Grace of\r\nGod,\" \"the Lord God's Wonder Plant.\" and some other names of a\r\nlike import, probably too, because found to be of curative use\r\nagainst insanity. Again, it used to be entitled _Hexenkraut_, and\r\n\"Witch's Herb,\" on account of its reputed magical powers.\r\nMatthiolus said, _Scripsere quidam Hypericum adeo odisse\r\ndoemones, ut ejus suffitu statim avolent_, \"Certain writers have said\r\nthat the St. John's Wort is so detested by evil spirits that they fly\r\noff at a whiff of its odour.\"\r\n\r\nFurther names of the herb are \"Amber,\" \"Hundred Holes,\" and _Sol\r\nterrestris_, the \"Terrestrial Sun,\" because it was believed that all\r\nthe spirits of darkness vanish in its presence, as at the rising of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nFor children troubled with incontinence of urine at night, and who\r\nwet their beds, an infusion, or tea, of the St. John's Wort is an\r\nadmirable preventive medicine, which will stop this untoward\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\nThe title St. John's Wort is given, either because the plant blossoms\r\nabout St. John's day, June 24th, or because the red-coloured sap\r\nwhich it furnishes was thought to resemble and signalise the blood\r\nof St. John the Baptist. Ancient writers certainly attributed a host of\r\nvirtues to this plant, especially for the cure of hypochondriasis, and\r\ninsanity. The red juice, or \"red [288] oil,\" of _Hypericum_ made\r\neffective by hanging for some months in a glass vessel exposed to\r\nthe sun, is esteemed as one of the most popular and curative\r\napplications in Europe for excoriations, wounds, and bruises.\r\n\r\nThe flowers also when rubbed together between the fingers yield a\r\nred juice, so that the plant has obtained the title of _Sanguis\r\nhominis_, human blood. Furthermore, this herb is _Medicamentum\r\nin mansa intus sumptum_, \"to be chewed for its curative effects.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for making a medicinal infusion, an ounce of the herb should\r\nbe used to a pint of boiling water. This may be given beneficially\r\nfor chronic catarrhs of the lungs, the bowels, or the urinary\r\npassages, Dr. Tuthill Massy considered the St. John's Wort, by virtue\r\nof its healing properties for injuries of the spinal cord, and its\r\ndependencies, the vulnerary \"arnica\" of the organic nervous system.\r\nOn the doctrine of signatures, because of its perforated leaves, and\r\nbecause of the blood-red juice contained in the capsules which it\r\nbears, this plant was formerly deemed a most excellent specific for\r\nhealing wounds, and for stopping a flow of blood:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hypericon was there--the herb of war,\r\n    Pierced through with wounds, and seamed with many a scar.\"\r\n\r\nFor lacerated nerves, and injuries by violence to the spinal cord, a\r\nwarm lotion should be employed, made with one part of the tincture\r\nto twenty parts of water, comfortably hot. A salve compounded\r\nfrom the flowers, and known as St. John's Wort Salve, is still much\r\nused and valued in English villages. And in several countries the\r\ndew which has fallen on vegetation before daybreak on St. John's\r\nmorning, is gathered with great care. It is thought to protect the eyes\r\nfrom all harm throughout the ensuing year, and the Venetians [289]\r\nsay it renews the roots of the hair on the baldest of heads. Peasants\r\nin the Isle of Man, are wont to think that if anyone treads on the St.\r\nJohn's Wort after sunset, a fairy horse will arise from the earth, and\r\nwill carry him about all night, leaving him at sunrise wherever he\r\nmay chance to be.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a somewhat aromatic odour; and from the leaves and\r\nflowers, when crushed, a lemon-like scent is exhaled, whilst their\r\ntaste is bitter and astringent. The flowers furnish for fabrics of silk\r\nor wool a dye of deep yellow. Those parts of the plant were alone\r\nordered by the London _Pharmacopoeia_ to be used for supplying\r\nin chief the medicinal, oily, resinous extractive of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe juice gives a red colour to the spirit of wine with which it is\r\nmixed, and to expressed oils, being then known as the _Hypericum_\r\n\"red oil\" mentioned above. The flowers contain tannin, and\r\n\"_Hypericum_ red.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, this _Hypericum_ oil made from the tops is highly useful\r\nfor healing bed sores, and is commended as excellent for ulcers. A\r\nmedicinal tincture (H.) is prepared with spirit of wine from the\r\nentire fresh plant, collected when flowering, or in seed, and this\r\nproves of capital service for remedying injuries to the spinal cord,\r\nboth by being given internally, and by its external use. It has been\r\nemployed in like manner with benefit for lock-jaw. The dose of the\r\ntincture is from five to eight drops with a spoonful of water two or\r\nthree times a day.\r\n\r\nThis plant may be readily distinguished from others of the\r\nHypericaceous order by its decidedly two edged stem. Sprigs of it\r\nare stuck at the present time in Wales over every outer door on the\r\neve of St. John's day; [290] and in Scotland, milking is done on the\r\nherb to dispel the malignant enchantments which cause ropy milk.\r\n\r\nAmong the Christian saints St. John represents light; and the flowers\r\nof this plant were taken as a reminder of the beneficent sun.\r\n\r\nTutsan is a large flowered variety (_Hypericum androsoemum_) of\r\nthe St. John's Wort, named from the French _toute saine_, or \"heal\r\nall,\" because of its many curative virtues; and is common in Devon\r\nand Cornwall. It possesses the same properties as the perforate sort,\r\nbut yields a stronger and more camphoraceous odour when the\r\nflowers and the seed vessels are bruised. A tincture made from this\r\nplant, as well as that made from the perforate St. John's Wort, has\r\nbeen used with success to cure melancholia, and its allied forms of\r\ninsanity. The seed-capsules of the Tutsan are glossy and berry-like;\r\nthe leaves retain their strong resinous odour after being dried.\r\n\r\nTutsan is called also provincially \"Woman's Tongue,\" once set\r\ng(r)owing it never stops; and by country folk in Ireland the \"Rose of\r\nSharon.\" Its botanical name Androsoemum, _andros aima_, man's\r\nblood, derived from the red juice and oil, probably suggested the\r\npopular title of Tutsan, \"heal all,\" often corrupted to \"Touchen leaf.\"\r\n\r\nGerard gives a receipt, as a great secret, for making a compound oil\r\nof _Hypericum_, \"than which,\" he says, \"I know that in the world\r\nthere is no better; no, not the natural balsam itself.\" \"The plant,\" he\r\nadds, \"is a singular remedy for the sciatica, provided that the patient\r\ndrink water for a day or two after purging.\" \"The leaves laid upon\r\nbroken shins and scabbed legs do heal them.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is of a special value for healing [291] punctured\r\nwounds; and its leaves are diuretic. It is handsome and shrubby,\r\ngrowing to a height of two or three feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNIPER.\r\n\r\nThe Juniper shrub (Arkenthos of the ancients), which is widely\r\ndistributed about the world, grows not uncommonly in England as a\r\nstiff evergreen conifer on heathy ground, and bears bluish purple\r\nberries. These have a sweet, juicy, and, presently, bitter, brown\r\npulp, containing three seeds, and they do not ripen until the second\r\nyear. The flowers blossom in May and June. Probably the shrub gets\r\nits name from the Celtic _jeneprus_, \"rude or rough.\" Gerard notes\r\nthat \"it grows most commonly very low, like unto our ground\r\nfurzes.\" Gum Sandarach, or Pounce, is the product of this tree.\r\n\r\nMedicinally, the berries and the fragrant tops are employed. They\r\ncontain \"juniperin,\" sugar, resins, wax, fat, formic and acetic acids,\r\nand malates. The fresh tops have a balsamic odour, and a\r\ncarminative, bitterish taste. The berries afford a yellow aromatic oil,\r\nwhich acts on the kidneys, and gives cordial warmth to the stomach.\r\nForty berries should yield an ounce of the oil. Steeped in alcohol the\r\nberries make a capital _ratafia_; they are used in several\r\nconfections, as well as for flavouring gin, being put into a spirit\r\nmore common than the true geneva of Holland. The French obtain\r\nfrom these berries the _Genievre_ (_Anglice_ \"geneva\"), from\r\nwhich we have taken our English word \"gin.\" In France, Savoy, and\r\nItaly, the berries are largely collected, and are sometimes eaten as\r\nsuch, fifteen or twenty at a time, to stimulate the kidneys; or they\r\nare taken in powder for the same [292] purpose. Being fragrant of\r\nsmell, they have a warm, sweet, pungent flavour, which becomes\r\nbitter on further mastication.\r\n\r\nOur British _Pharmacopoeia_ orders a spirit of Juniper to be made\r\nfor producing the like diuretic action in some forms of dropsy, so as\r\nto carry off the effused fluid by the kidneys. A teaspoonful of this\r\nspirit may be taken, well diluted with water, several times in the\r\nday. Of the essential oil the dose is from two to three drops on\r\nsugar, or with a tablespoonful of milk. These remedies are of service\r\nalso in catarrh of the urinary passages; and if applied externally to\r\npainful local swellings, whether rheumatic, or neuralgic, the bruised\r\nberries afford prompt and lasting relief.\r\n\r\nAn infusion or decoction of the Juniper wood is sometimes given\r\nfor the same affections, but less usefully, because the volatile oil\r\nbecomes dissipated by the boiling heat. A \"rob,\" or inspissated juice\r\nof the berries, is likewise often employed. Gerard said: \"A decoction\r\nthereof is singular against an old cough.\" Gin is an ordinary malt\r\nspirit distilled a second time, with the addition of some Juniper\r\nberries. Formerly these berries were added to the malt in grinding,\r\nso that the spirit obtained therefrom was flavoured with the berries\r\nfrom the first, and surpassed all that could be made by any other\r\nmethod. At present gin is cheaply manufactured by leaving out the\r\nberries altogether, and giving the spirit a flavour by distilling it\r\nwith a proportion of oil of turpentine, which resembles the Juniper\r\nberries in taste; and as this sophistication is less practised in\r\nHolland than elsewhere, it is best to order \"Hollands,\" with water,\r\nas a drink for dropsical persons. By the use of Juniper berries Dr.\r\nMayern cured some patients who were deplorably ill with [293] epilepsy\r\nwhen all other remedies had failed. \"Let the patient carry a bag of\r\nthese berries about with him, and eat from ten to twenty every\r\nmorning for a month or more, whilst fasting. Similarly for flatulent\r\nindigestion the berries may be most usefully given; on the first day,\r\nfour berries; on the second, five; on the third, six; on the fourth,\r\nseven; and so on until twelve days, and fifteen berries are reached;\r\nafter this the daily dose should be reduced by one berry until only\r\nfive are taken in the day; which makes an admirable 'berry-cure.'\"\r\nThe berries are to be well masticated, and the husks may be\r\nafterwards either rejected or swallowed.\r\n\r\nJuniper oil, used officinally, is distilled from the full-grown,\r\nunripe, green fruit. The Laplanders almost adore the tree, and they\r\nmake a decoction of its ripe berries, when dried, to be drunk as tea,\r\nor coffee; whilst the Swedish peasantry prepare from the fresh berries\r\na fermented beverage, which they drink cold, and an extract, which\r\nthey eat with their bread for breakfast as we do butter.\r\n\r\nSimon Pauli assures us these berries have performed wonders in\r\ncuring the stone, he having personally treated cases thus, with\r\nincredible success. Schroder knew a nobleman of Germany, who\r\nfreed himself from the intolerable symptoms of stone, by a constant\r\nuse of these berries. Evelyn called them the \"Forester's Panacea,\"\r\n\"one of the most universal remedies in the world to our crazy\r\nForester.\" Astrological botanists advise to pull the berries when the\r\nsun is in Virgo.\r\n\r\nWe read in an old tract (London, 1682) on _The use of Juniper and\r\nElder berries in our Publick Houses_: \"The simple decoction of\r\nthese berries, sweetened with a little sugar candy, will afford liquors\r\nso pleasant to the eye, so grateful to the palate, and so beneficial to\r\nthe [294] body, that the wonder is they have not been courted and\r\nushered into our Publick Houses, so great are the extraordinary\r\nbeauty and vertues of these berries.\" \"One ounce, well cleansed,\r\nbruised, and mashed, will be enough for almost a pint of water.\r\nWhen they are boiled together the vessel must be carefully stopt,\r\nand after the boiling is over one tablespoonful of sugar candy must\r\nbe put in.\"\r\n\r\nFrom rifts which occur spontaneously in the bark of the shrubs in\r\nwarm countries issues a gum resembling frankincense. This gum, as\r\nGerard teaches, \"drieth ulcers which are hollow, and filleth them\r\nwith flesh if they be cast thereon.\" \"Being mixed with oil of roses, it\r\nhealeth chaps of the hands and feet.\" Bergius said \"the lignum\r\n(wood) of Juniper is _diureticum, sudorificum, mundificans_; the\r\n_bacca_ (berry), _diuretica, nutriens, diaphoretica_.\" In Germany\r\nthe berries are added to _sauerkraut_ for flavouring it.\r\n\r\nVirgil thought the odour exhaled by the Juniper tree noxious, and he\r\nspeaks of the _Juniperis gravis umbra_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Surgamus! solet esse gravis cantantibus umbra;\r\n    Juniperis gravis umbra; nocent et frugibus umbrae.\"\r\n        _Eclog. X. v._ 75.\r\n\r\nBut it is more scientific to suppose that the growth of Juniper trees\r\nshould be encouraged near dwellings, because of the balsamic and\r\nantiseptic odours which they constantly exhale. The smoke of the\r\nleaves and wood was formerly believed to drive away \"all infection\r\nand corruption of the aire which bringeth the plague, and such like\r\ncontagious diseases.\"\r\n\r\nSprays of Juniper are frequently strewn over floors of apartments, so\r\nas to give out when trodden down, their agreeable odour which is\r\nsupposed to promote [295] sleep. Queen Elizabeth's bedchamber\r\nwas sweetened with their fumes. In the French hospitals it is\r\ncustomary to burn Juniper berries with Rosemary for correcting\r\nvitiated air, and to prevent infection.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent the Juniper is regarded with much veneration,\r\nbecause it is thought to have saved the life of the Madonna, and of\r\nthe infant Jesus, whom she hid under a Juniper bush when flying\r\ninto Egypt from the assassins of Herod.\r\n\r\nVirgil alludes to the Juniper as Cedar:--\r\n\r\n    \"Disce et odoratam stabulis accendere cedrum.\"\r\n       _Georgic_.\r\n\r\n    \"But learn to burn within your sheltering rooms\r\n    Sweet Juniper.\"\r\n\r\nIts powerful odour is thought to defeat the keen scent of the hound;\r\nand a hunted hare when put to extremities will seek a safe retreat\r\nunder cover of its branches. Elijah was sheltered from the\r\npersecutions of King Ahab by the Juniper tree; since which time it\r\nhas been always regarded as an asylum, and a symbol of succour.\r\n\r\nFrom the wood of the _Juniperus oxycoedrus_; an empyreumatic oil\r\nresembling liquid pitch, is obtained by dry distillation, this being\r\nnamed officinally, _Huile de cade_, or _Oleum cadinum_, otherwise\r\n\"Juniper tar.\" It is found to be most useful as an external stimulant\r\nfor curing psoriasis and chronic eczema of the skin. A recognised\r\nointment is made with this and yellow wax, _Unguentum olei\r\ncadini_.\r\n\r\nIn Italy stables are popularly thought to be protected by a sprig of\r\nJuniper from demons and thunderbolts, just as we suppose the\r\nmagic horseshoe to be protective to our houses and offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[296] KNAPWEED (The Lesser).\r\n\r\nBlack Knapweed, the _Centaurea nigra_, is a common tough-stemmed\r\ncomposite weed growing in our meadows and cornfields, being\r\nwell known by its heads of dull purple flowers, with brown,\r\nor almost black scales of the outer floral encasement. It is popularly\r\ncalled Hard heads, Loggerheads, Iron heads, Horse knob, and Bull\r\nweed.\r\n\r\nDr. Withering relates that a decoction made from these hard heads\r\nhas afforded at least a temporary relief in cases of diabetes mellitus,\r\n\"by diminishing the quantity of urine, and dispelling the sweetness.\"\r\n\r\nIts chief chemical constituent _enicin_, is identical with that of the\r\nBlessed thistle, and the Blue bottle, and closely resembles that of the\r\nDandelion. It has been found useful in strengthless indigestion,\r\nespecially when this is complicated with sluggish torpor of the liver.\r\nFrom half to one ounce of the herb may be boiled in eight fluid\r\nounces of water, and a small wineglassful be taken for a dose twice\r\nor three times a day. In Bucks young women make use of this\r\nKnapweed for love divination:--\r\n\r\n    \"They pull the little blossom threads\r\n    From out the Knotweed's button beads,\r\n    And put the husk with many a smile\r\n    In their white bosoms for a while;\r\n    Then, if they guess aright, the swain\r\n    Their love's sweet fancies try to gain,\r\n    'Tis said that ere it lies an hour\r\n    'Twill blossom with a second flower.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAVENDER.\r\n\r\nThe Lavender of our gardens, called also Lavender Spike, is a\r\nwell-known sweet-smelling shrub, of the Labiate order. It grows wild\r\nin Spain, Piedmont, and [297] the south of France, on waysides,\r\nmountains, and in barren places. The plant was propagated by slips,\r\nor cuttings, and has been cultivated in England since about 1568.\r\nIt is produced largely for commercial purposes in Surrey,\r\nHertfordshire, and Lincoln. The shrub is set in long rows occupying\r\nfields, and yields a profitable fragrant essential oil from the\r\nflowering tops, about one ounce of the oil from sixty terminal\r\nflowering spikes. From these tops also the popular cosmetic\r\nlavender water is distilled. They contain tannin, and a resinous\r\ncamphire, which is common to most of the mints affording essential\r\noils. If a hank of cotton is steeped in the oil of Lavender, and\r\ndrained off so as to be hung dry about the neck, it will prevent bugs\r\nand other noxious insects from attacking that part. When mixed with\r\nthree-fourths of spirit of turpentine, or spirit of wine, this oil\r\nmakes the famous _Oleum spicoe_, formerly much celebrated for curing\r\nold sprains and stiff joints. Lavender oil is likewise of service when\r\nrubbed in externally, for stimulating paralysed limbs--preferring the\r\nsort distilled from the flowering tops to that which is obtained from\r\nthe stalks. Internally, the essential oil, or a spirit of Lavender made\r\ntherefrom, proves admirably restorative and tonic against faintness,\r\npalpitations of a nervous sort, weak giddiness, spasms, and colic. It\r\nis agreeable to the taste and smell, provokes appetite, raises the\r\nspirits, and dispels flatulence; but the infusion of Lavender tops, if\r\ntaken too freely, will cause griping, and colic. In hysteria, palsy, and\r\nsimilar disorders of debility, and lack of nerve power, the spirit of\r\nLavender will act as a powerful stimulant; and fomentations with\r\nLavender in bags, applied hot, will speedily relieve local pains. \"It\r\nprofiteth them much,\" says Gerard, \"that have the palsy if they be\r\nwashed with the distilled water [298] from the Lavender flowers; or\r\nare anointed with the oil made from the flowers and olive oil, in\r\nsuch manner as oil of roses is used.\" A dose of the oil is from one to\r\nfour drops on sugar, or on a small piece of bread crumb, or in a\r\nspoonful or two of milk. And of the spirit, from half to one\r\nteaspoonful may be taken with two tablespoonfuls of water, hot or\r\ncold, or of milk. The spirit of Lavender is made with one part of the\r\nessential oil to forty-nine parts of spirit of wine. For preparing\r\ndistilled Lavender water, the addition of a small quantity of musk\r\ndoes much to develop the strength of the Lavender's odour and\r\nfragrance. The essential oil of _Lavandula latifolia_, admirably\r\npromotes the growth of the hair when weakly, or falling off.\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks the name Nardus is given to Lavender, from Naarda,\r\na city of Syria, near the Euphrates; and many persons call the plant\r\n\"Nard.\" St. Mark mentions this as Spikenard, a thing of great value\r\nThe woman who came to Christ having an alabaster box of ointment\r\nof Spikenard, very precious \"brake the box, and poured it on His\r\nhead.\" In Pliny's time blossoms of the nardus sold for a hundred\r\nRoman denarii (or L3 2s. 6d.) the pound. This Lavender or\r\n_Nardus_, was likewise called Asarum by the Romans, because not\r\nused in garlands or chaplets. It was formerly believed that the asp, a\r\ndangerous kind of viper, made Lavender its habitual place of abode,\r\nso that the plant had to be approached with great caution.\r\n\r\nConserves of Lavender were much used in the time of Gerard, and\r\ndesserts may be most pleasantly brought to the table on a service of\r\nLavender spikes. It is said, on good authority, that the lions and\r\ntigers in our Zoological gardens, are powerfully affected by the\r\nsmell of Lavender-water and become docile under its influence.\r\n\r\n[299] The Lavender shrub takes its name from the Latin _lavare_,\r\n\"to wash,\" because the ancients employed it as a perfume. Lavender\r\ntops, when dried, and placed with linen, will preserve it from moths\r\nand other insects.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant was at one time considered indispensable in Africa,\r\n_ubi lavandis corporibus Lybes ea utuntur; nec nisi decocto ejus\r\nabluti mane domo egrediuntur_, \"where the Libyans make use of it\r\nfor washing their bodies, nor ever leave their houses of a morning\r\nuntil purified by a decoction of the plant.\"\r\n\r\nIn this country the sweet-smelling herb is often introduced for\r\nscenting newly washed linen when it is put by; from which custom\r\nhas arisen the expression, \"To be laid up in Lavender.\" During the\r\ntwelfth century a washerwoman was called \"Lavender,\" in the North\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nA tea brewed from the flowers is an excellent remedy for headache\r\nfrom fatigue, or weakness. But Lavender oil is, in too large a dose, a\r\nnarcotic poison, and causes death by convulsions. The tincture of\r\nred Lavender is a popular medicinal cordial; and is composed of the\r\noils of Lavender and rosemary, with cinnamon bark, nutmeg, and\r\nred sandal wood, macerated in spirit of wine for seven days; then a\r\nteaspoonful may be given for a dose in a little water, with excellent\r\neffect, after an indigestible meal, taking the dose immediately when\r\nfeeling uneasy, and repeating it after half-an-hour if needed. An old\r\nform of this compound tincture was formerly famous as \"Palsy\r\nDrops,\" it being made from the Lavender, with rosemary, cinnamon,\r\nnutmeg, red sandal wood, and spirit. In some cases of mental\r\ndepression and delusions the oil of Lavender proves of real service;\r\nand a few drops of it rubbed on the temples will cure nervous\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\n[300] Shakespeare makes Perdita (_Winter's Tale_) class Lavender\r\namong the flowers denoting middle age:\r\n\r\n    \"Here's flowers for you,\r\n    Hot Lavender: Mints: Savory: Marjoram;\r\n    The Marigold that goes to bed with the sun,\r\n    And with him rises, weeping: these are the flowers\r\n    Of middle summer, and I think they are given\r\n    To men of middle age.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a broad-leaved variety of the Lavender shrub in France,\r\nwhich yields three times as much of the essential oil as can be got\r\nfrom our narrow-leaved plant, but of a second rate quality.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Lavender, or Thrift (_Statice limonium_) grows near the\r\nsea, or in salt marshes. It gets its name Statice from the Greek word\r\n_isteemi_ (to stop, or stay), because of its medicinal power to arrest\r\nbleeding. This is the marsh Rosemary, or Ink Root, which contains\r\n(if the root be dried in the air) from fourteen to fifteen per cent. of\r\ntannin. Therefore, its infusion or tincture will prove highly useful to\r\ncontrol bleeding from the lungs or kidneys, as also against\r\ndysentery; and when made into a gargle, for curing an ulcerated sore\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMON.\r\n\r\nThe Lemon (_Citrus Limonum_) is so common of use in admixing\r\nrefreshing drinks, and for its fragrancy of peel, whether for culinary\r\nflavour, or as a delightful perfume, that it may well find a place\r\namong the Simples of a sagacious housewife. Moreover, the\r\nimported fruit, which abounds in our markets, as if to the manner\r\nborn, is endowed with valuable medicinal properties which\r\nadditionally qualify it for the domestic _Herbarium_. The Lemons\r\nbrought to England come chiefly from Sicily, [301] through\r\nMessina and Palermo. Flowers may be found on the lemon tree all\r\nthe year round.\r\n\r\nIn making lemonade it is a mistake to pour boiling water upon\r\nsliced Lemons, because thus brewing an infusion of the peel, which\r\nis medicinal. The juice should be squeezed into cold water\r\n(previously boiled), adding to a quart of the same the juice of three\r\nlemons, a few crushed strawberries, and the cut up rind of one\r\nLemon.\r\n\r\nThis fruit grows specially at Mentone, in the south of France; and a\r\nlegend runs that Eve carried two or three Lemons with her away\r\nfrom Paradise, wandering about until she came to Mentone, which\r\nshe found to be so like the Garden of Eden that she settled there, and\r\nplanted her fruit.\r\n\r\nThe special dietetic value of Lemons consists in their potash\r\nsalts, the citrate, malate, and tartrate, which are respectively\r\nantiscorbutic, and of assistance in promoting biliary digestion.\r\nEach fluid ounce of the fresh juice contains about forty-four\r\ngrains of citric acid, with gum, sugar, and a residuum, which yields,\r\nwhen incinerated, potash, lime, and phosphoric acid. But the\r\ncitric acid of the shops is not nearly so preventive or curative\r\nof scurvy as the juice itself.\r\n\r\nThe exterior rind furnishes a grateful aromatic bitter; and our word\r\n\"zest\" signifies really a chip of lemon peel or orange peel used for\r\ngiving flavour to liquor. It comes from the Greek verb, \"_skizein_,\"\r\nto divide, or cut up.\r\n\r\nThe juice has certain sedative properties whereby it allays hysterical\r\npalpitation of the heart, and alleviates pain caused by cancerous\r\nulceration of the tongue. Dr. Brandini, of Florence, discovered this\r\nlatter property of fresh Lemon juice, through a patient who, when\r\nsuffering [302] grievously from that dire disease, found marvellous\r\nrelief to the part by casually sucking a lemon to slake his feverish\r\nthirst. But it is a remarkable fact that the acid of Lemons is harmful\r\nand obnoxious to cats, rabbits, and other small animals, because it\r\nlowers the heart's action in these creatures, and liquifies the blood;\r\nwhereas, in man it does not diminish the coagulability of the blood,\r\nbut proves more useful than any other agent in correcting that thin\r\nimpoverished liquidity thereof which constitutes scurvy. Rapin\r\nextols lemons, or citrons, for discomfort of the heart:--\r\n\r\n    \"Into an oval form the citrons rolled\r\n    Beneath thick coats their juicy pulp unfold:\r\n    From some the palate feels a poignant smart,\r\n    Which, though they wound the tongue, _yet heal the heart_.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout Italy, and at Rome, a decoction of fresh Lemons is\r\nextolled as a specific against intermittent fever; for which purpose a\r\nfresh unpeeled Lemon is cut into thin slices, and put into an\r\nearthenware jar with three breakfastcupfuls of cold water, and\r\nboiled down to one cupful, which is strained, the lemon being\r\nsqueezed, and the decoction being given shortly before the access of\r\nfever is expected.\r\n\r\nFor a restless person of ardent temperament and active plethoric\r\ncirculation, a Lemon squash (unsweetened) of not more than half a\r\ntumblerful is a capital sedative; or, a whole lemon may be made hot\r\non the oven top, being turned from time to time, and being put\r\npresently when soft and moist into a teacup, then by stabbing it\r\nabout the juice will be made to escape, and should be drunk hot. If\r\nbruised together with a sufficient quantity of sugar the pips of a\r\nfresh Lemon or Orange will serve admirably against worms in [303]\r\nchildren. Cut in slices and put into the morning bath, a Lemon\r\nmakes it fragrant and doubly refreshing.\r\n\r\nProfessor Wilhelm Schmole, a German doctor, has published a work\r\nof some note, in which he advances the theory that fresh Lemon\r\njuice is a kind of _elixir vitae_; and that if a sufficient number of\r\nLemons be taken daily, life may be indefinitely prolonged. Lemon\r\njuice is decidedly beneficial against jaundice from passive\r\nsluggishness of the biliary functions; it will often serve to stay\r\nbleedings, when ice and astringent styptics have failed; it will prove\r\nuseful when swallowed freely against immoderately active monthly\r\nfluxes in women; and when applied externally it signally relieves\r\ncutaneous itching, especially of the genitals.\r\n\r\nPrize-fighters refresh themselves with a fresh cut Lemon between\r\nthe rounds when competing in the Ring. Hence has arisen the\r\ncommon saying, \"Take a suck of the Lemon, and at him again.\"\r\n\r\nFor a relaxed sore throat, Lemon juice will help to make a\r\nserviceable gargle. By the heat of the sun it may be reduced to a\r\nsolid state. For a cold in the head, if the juice of a ripe Lemon be\r\nsqueezed into the palm of the hand, and strongly sniffed into the\r\nnostrils at two or three separate times, a cure will be promoted.\r\nRoast fillet of veal, with stuffing and lemon juice, was beloved by\r\nOliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nFor heartburn which comes on without having eaten sweet things, it\r\nis helpful to suck a thin slice of fresh Lemon dipped in salt just\r\nafter each meal.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese practice of rubbing parts severely neuralgic with the\r\nwet surface of a cut Lemon is highly useful. This fruit has been sold\r\nwithin present recollection at half-a-crown each, and during the\r\nAmerican war at five shillings.\r\n\r\n[304] The hands may be made white, soft, and supple by daily\r\nsponging them with fresh Lemon juice, which further keeps the\r\nnails in good order; and the same may be usefully applied to the\r\nroots of the hair for removing dandriff from the scalp.\r\n\r\nThe Candied Peel which we employ as a confection is got from one of\r\nthe citrons (a variety of the lemon); whilst another of this tribe is\r\nesteemed for religious purposes in Jewish synagogues. These citrons\r\nare imported into England from the East; and for unblemished\r\nspecimens of the latter which reach London, high prices are paid.\r\nOne pound sterling is a common sum, and not infrequently as much\r\nas seventy shillings are given for a single \"Citron of Law.\" The fruit\r\nis used at the Feast of Tabernacles according to a command given in\r\nthe Book of the Law; it is not of an edible nature, but is handed\r\nround and smelt by the worshippers as they go out, when they\r\n\"thank God for all good things, and for the sweet odours He has\r\ngiven to men.\" This citron is considered to be almost miraculously\r\nrestorative, especially by those who regard it as the \"tappnach,\"\r\nintended in the text, \"Comfort me with apples.\" Ladies of the Orient,\r\neven now, carry a piece of its rind about them in a vinaigrette.\r\n\r\nThe citron which furnishes Candied Peel resembles a large juicy\r\nlemon, but without a nipple.\r\n\r\nVirgil said of the fruit generally:--\r\n\r\n    \"Media fert tristes succos, tardumque saporem\r\n    Felicis mali.\"\r\n\r\nFresh Lemon juice will not keep because of its mucilage, which\r\nsoon ferments.\r\n\r\nSidney Smith, in writing about Foston, his remote Country Cure in\r\nYorkshire, said it is \"twelve miles from a Lemon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[305] LENTIL.\r\n\r\nAmong the leguminous plants which supply food for the invalid,\r\nand are endowed with certain qualifications for correcting the\r\nhealth, may be justly placed the Lentil, though we have to import it\r\nbecause our moist, cold climate is not favourable for its growth.\r\nNevertheless, it closely resembles the small purple vetch of our\r\nsummer hedgerows at home. In France its pulse is much eaten\r\nduring Lent--which season takes its name, as some authors suppose,\r\nfrom this penitential plant. Men become under its subduing dietary\r\ninfluence, \"_lenti et lenes_.\" The plant is cultivated freely in Egypt\r\nfor the sake of the seeds, which are flat on both sides, growing in\r\nnumerous pods.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name is _Ervum lens_; and about the year 1840 a Mr.\r\nWharton sold the flour of Lentils under the name of Ervalenta, this\r\nbeing then of a primrose colour. He failed in his enterprise, and Du\r\nBarry took up the business, but substituting the red Arabian Lentil\r\nfor the yellow German pulse.\r\n\r\nJoseph's mess of pottage which he sold to Esau for his birthright\r\nwas a preparation of the red Lentil: and the same food was the bread\r\nof Ezekiel.\r\n\r\nThe legumin contained in this vegetable is very light and sustaining,\r\nbut it is apt to form unwholesome combinations with any earthy\r\nsalts taken in other articles of food, or in the water used in cooking;\r\ntherefore Lemon juice or vinegar is a desirable addition to Lentils at\r\ntable. This is because of the phosphates contained so abundantly,\r\nand liable to become deposited in the urine. \"Lentils,\" says Gerard,\r\n\"are singular good to stay the menses.\" They are traditionally\r\nregarded as funeral plants, and formerly they were forbidden at\r\nsacrifices and feasts.\r\n\r\n[306] Parkinson said, \"The country people sow it in the fields as\r\nfood for their cattle, and call it 'tills', leaving out the 'lent', as\r\nthinking that word agreeth not with the matter.\" \"_Ita sus\r\nMinervam_.\" In Hampshire the plant is known as \"tils,\" and in\r\nOxfordshire as \"dills.\" The Romans supposed it made people\r\nindolent and torpid, therefore they named the plant from _lentus_,\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nAllied to the Lentil as likewise a leguminous plant is the LUPINE,\r\ngrown now only as an ornament to our flower beds, but formerly\r\ncultivated by the Romans as an article of food, and still capable of\r\nusefulness in this capacity for the invalid. Pliny said, \"No kind of\r\nfodder is more wholesome and light of digestion than the white\r\nLupine when eaten dry.\" If taken commonly at meals it will\r\ncontribute a fresh colour and a cheerful countenance. When thus\r\nformerly used neither trouble nor expense was needed in sowing the\r\nseed, since it had merely to be scattered over the ground without\r\nploughing or digging. But Virgil designated it _tristis Lupinus_, \"the\r\nsad Lupine,\" probably because when the pulse of this plant was\r\neaten without being first cooked in any way so as to modify its bitter\r\ntaste, it had a tendency to contract the muscles of the face, and to\r\ngive a sorrowful appearance to the countenance. It was said the\r\nLupine was cursed by the Virgin Mary, because when she fled with\r\nthe child Christ from the assassins of Herod, plants of this species\r\nby the noise they made attracted the attention of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Lupine was originally named from _lupus_, a wolf, because of\r\nits voracious nature. The seeds were used as pieces of money by\r\nRoman actors in their plays and comedies, whence came the saying,\r\n\"_nummus lupinus_,\" \"a spurious bit of money.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[307] LETTUCE.\r\n\r\nOur garden Lettuce is a cultivated variety of the wild, or\r\nstrong-scented Lettuce (_Lactuca virosa_), which grows, with prickly\r\nleaves, on banks and waysides in chalky districts throughout\r\nEngland and Wales. It belongs to the Composite order of plants, and\r\ncontains the medicinal properties of the plant more actively than\r\ndoes the Lettuce produced for the kitchen. An older form of the\r\nname is _Lettouce_, which is still retained in Scotland.\r\n\r\nChemically the wild Lettuce contains lactucin, lactucopricin,\r\nasparagin, mannite, albumen, gum, and resin, together with oxalic,\r\nmalic, and citric acids; thus possessing virtues for easing pain, and\r\ninducing sleep. The cultivated Lettuce which comes to our tables\r\nretains these same properties, but in a very modified degree, since\r\nthe formidable principles have become as completely toned down\r\nand guileless in the garden product as were the child-like manners\r\nand the pensive smile of Bret Harte's Heathen Chinee.\r\n\r\nEach plant derives its name, _lactuca_, from its milky juice; in Latin\r\n_lactis_; and in Greek, _galaktos_ (taking the genitive case). This\r\njuice, when withdrawn from the cut or incised stalks and stems of\r\nthe wild Lettuce, is milky at first, and afterwards becomes brown,\r\nlike opium, being then known (when dried into a kind of gum) as\r\n_lactucarium_. From three to eight grains of this gum, if taken at\r\nbedtime, will allay the wakefulness which follows over-excitement\r\nof brain. A similar _lactucarium_, got from the dried milk of the\r\ncultivated garden Lettuce, is so mild a sedative as to be suitable for\r\nrestless infants; and two grains thereof may be safely given to a\r\nyoung child for soothing it to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe wild Lettuce is rather laxative; with which view a decoction of\r\nthe leaves is sometimes taken as a drink [308] to remedy\r\nconstipation, and intestinal difficulties, as also to allay feverish\r\npains. The plant was mentioned as acting thus in an epigram by\r\nMartial (_Libr. VI., Sq_.).\r\n\r\n    \"Prima tibi dabitur ventro lactuca movendo\r\n    Utilis, et porris fila resecta suis.\"\r\n\r\nGerard said: \"Being in some degree laxative and aperient, the\r\ncultivated Lettuce is very proper for hot bilious dispositions;\" and\r\nParkinson adds (1640): \"Lettuce eaten raw or boyled, helpeth to\r\nloosen the belly, and the boyled more than the raw.\" It was known\r\nas the \"Milk Plant\" to Dioscorides and Theophrastus, and was much\r\nesteemed by the Romans to be eaten after a debauch of wine, or as a\r\nsedative for inducing sleep. But a prejudice against it was\r\nentertained for a time as _venerem enervans_, and therefore\r\n_mortuorum cibi_, \"food for the dead.\"\r\n\r\nApuleius says, that when the eagle desires to fly to a great height,\r\nand to get a clear view of the extensive prospect below him, he first\r\nplucks a leaf of the wild Lettuce and touches his eyes with the juice\r\nthereof, by which means he obtains the widest perspicuity of vision.\r\n\"Dicunt aquilam quum in altum volare voluerit ut prospiciat rerum\r\nnaturas lactucoe sylvaticoe folium evellere et succo ejus sibi oculos\r\ntangere, et maximam inde claritudinem accipere.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Adonis, Venus is related to have thrown herself\r\non a bed of lettuces to assuage her grief. \"In lactuca occultatum a\r\nVenere Adonin--cecinit Callimachus--quod allegorice interpretatus\r\nAthenoeus illuc referendum putat quod in venerem hebetiores fiunt\r\nlactucas vescentes assidue.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans called this plant \"the Eunuch\"; and there is a\r\nsaying in Surrey, \"O'er much Lettuce in [309] the garden will stop a\r\nyoung wife's bearing.\" During the middle ages it was thought an evil\r\nspirit lurked among the Lettuces adverse to mothers, and causing\r\ngrievous ills to new-born infants.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, in the reign of Domitian, had the lettuce prepared with\r\neggs, and served with the last course at their tables, so as to\r\nstimulate their appetites afresh. Martial wonders that it had since\r\nthen become customary to take it rather at the beginning of the\r\nmeal:--\r\n\r\n    \"Claudere quae caenas lactuca solebat avorum\r\n    Dic mihi cur nostras inchoat illa dapes.\"\r\n\r\nAntoninus Musa cured Caesar Augustus of hypochondriasis by\r\nmeans of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe most common variety of the wild Lettuce, improved by\r\nfrequent cultivation, is the Cabbage Lettuce, or Roman, \"which is\r\nthe best to boil, stew, or put into hodge-podge.\" Different sorts of\r\nthe Cos Lettuce follow next onwards. The _Lactuca sylvatica_ is a\r\nvariety of the wild Lettuce producing similar effects. From this a\r\nmedicinal tincture (H.) is prepared, and an extract from the\r\nflowering herb is given in doses of from five to fifteen grains. No\r\nattempt was made to cultivate the Lettuce in this country until the\r\nfourth year of Elizabeth's reign.\r\n\r\nWhen bleached by gardeners the lettuce becomes tender, sweet, and\r\nsucculent, being easily digested, even by dyspeptic persons, as to its\r\ncrisp, leafy parts, but not its hard stalk. It now contains but little\r\nnutriment of any sort, but supplies some mineral salts, especially\r\nnitre. In the stem there still lingers a small quantity of the\r\nsleep-inducing principle, \"lactucarin,\" particularly when the plant is\r\nflowering. Galen, when sleepless from [310] advanced age and\r\ninfirmities, with hard study, took decoction of the Lettuce at night;\r\nand Pope says, with reference to our garden sort:--\r\n\r\n    \"If you want rest,\r\n    Lettuce, and cowslip wine:--'probatum est.'\"\r\n\r\nBut if Lettuces are taken at supper with this view of promoting\r\nsleep, they should be had without any vinegar, which neutralises\r\ntheir soporific qualities. \"Sleep,\" said Sir Thomas Brown, \"is so like\r\ndeath that I dare not trust it without my prayers.\"\r\n\r\nSome persons suppose that when artificially blanched the plant is\r\nless wholesome than if left to grow naturally in the garden,\r\nespecially if its ready digestibility by those of sensitive stomachs be\r\ncorrectly attributed to the slightly narcotic principle. It was taken\r\nuncooked by the Hebrews with the Paschal lamb.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn writes enthusiastically about it in his _Book of\r\nSallets_: \"So harmless is it that it may safely be eaten raw in fevers;\r\nit allays heat, bridles choler, extinguishes thirst, excites appetite,\r\nkindly nourishes, and, above all, represses vapours, conciliates\r\nsleep, and mitigates pain, besides the effect it has upon the morals--\r\ntemperance and chastity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Galen (whose beloved sallet it was) says it breeds the most\r\nlaudable blood. No marvel, then, that Lettuces were by the ancients\r\ncalled _sanoe_ by way of eminency, and were so highly valued by\r\nthe great Augustus that, attributing to them his recovery from a\r\ndangerous sickness, it is reported he erected a statue and built an\r\naltar to this noble plant.\" Likewise, \"Tacitus, spending almost\r\nnothing at his frugal table in other dainties, was yet so great a\r\nfriend to the Lettuce that he used to say of his prodigality in its\r\npurchase, _Summi se mercari_ [311] _illas sumitus effusione_.\"\r\nProbably the Lettuce of Greece was more active than our indigenous,\r\nor cultivated plant.\r\n\r\nBy way of admonition as to care in preparing the Lettuce for table,\r\nDr. King Chambers has said (_Diet in Health and Disease_), \"The\r\nconsumption of Lettuce by the working man with his tea is an\r\nincreasing habit worthy of all encouragement. But the said working\r\nman must be warned of the importance of washing the material of\r\nhis meal. This hint is given in view of the frequent occurrence of the\r\nlarge round worm in the labouring population of some agricultural\r\ncounties, Oxfordshire for instance, where unwashed Lettuce is\r\nlargely eaten.\" Young Lettuces may be raised in forty-eight-hours\r\nby first steeping the seed in brandy and then sowing it in a\r\nhot-house.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the garden Lettuce are emollient, and when rubbed up\r\nwith water make a pleasant emulsion, which contains nothing of the\r\nmilky, laxative bitterness furnished by the leaves and stalk. This\r\nemulsion resembles that of almonds, but is even more cooling, and\r\ntherefore a better medicine in disorders arising from acrimony and\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Lactuca virosa_, or strong-scented wild Lettuce, a\r\nmedicinal tincture (H.) is prepared, using the whole plant. On the\r\nprinciple of treating with this tincture, when diluted, such toxic\r\neffects as too large doses of the juice would bring about, a slow\r\npulse, with a disposition to stupor, and sleepy weakness, are\r\nsuccessfully met by its use. Also a medicinal extract is made by\r\ndruggists from the wild Lettuce, and given in doses of from three to\r\nten grains for the medicinal purposes which have been particularised,\r\nand to remove a dull, heavy headache.\r\n\r\n\"The garden Lettuce is good,\" as Pliny said, \"for [312] burnings and\r\nscaldings if the leaves be laid thereon, with salt (_sic_), before the\r\nblisters do appear.\" \"By reason,\" concludes Evelyn, \"too, of its\r\nsoporiferous quality, the Lettuce ever was, and still continues, the\r\nprincipal foundation of the universal tribe of Sallets, which cools\r\nand refreshes, besides its other properties, and therefore was held in\r\nsuch high esteem by the ancients, that divers of the Valerian family\r\ndignified and ennobled their name with that of _Lactucinii_.\" It is\r\nbotanically distinguished as the _Lactuca sativa_, \"from the plenty\r\nof milk,\" says \"Adam in Eden\" (W. Coles), \"that it hath, and\r\n_causeth_.\"\r\n\r\nLambs' Lettuce, or Corn Salad, is a distinct plant, one of the\r\nValerian tribe, which was formerly classed as a Lettuce, by name,\r\n_Lactuca agnina_, either because it appears about the time when\r\nlambs (_agni_) are dropped, or because it is a favourite food of\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\nThe French call this _salade de Pretre_, \"monks' salad,\" and in\r\nreference thereto an old writer has said: \"It certainly deserves a\r\nplace among the _penitential_ herbs, for the stomach that admits it\r\nis apt to cry _peccavi_.\"\r\n\r\nThe same plant is also known by the title of the White Pot Herb, in\r\ncontrast to the _Olus atrum_, or Black Pot Herb. It grows wild in the\r\nbanks of hedges and waste cornfields, and is cultivated in our\r\nkitchen gardens as a salad herb, the Milk Grass, being called\r\nbotanically the _Valerianella olitoria_, and having been in request as\r\na spring medicine among country folk in former days. By genus it is\r\na _Fedia_, and bears diminutive white flowers resembling glass.\r\nGerard says: \"We know the Lambs' Lettuce as _Loblollie_; and it\r\nserves in winter as a salad herb, among others none of the worst.\" In\r\nFrance it goes by the names _manche_ and _broussette_. A\r\nmedicinal tincture is made (H.) from the fresh root.\r\n\r\n[313] The black pot-herb--so called from the dark colour of its\r\nfruit--is an umbelliferous plant, (_Smyrnium olusatrum_) or Alexanders,\r\noften found in the vicinity of abbeys, and probably therefore held in\r\nformer repute by the Monks. Its names are derived from _Smyrna_,\r\nmyrrh, in allusion to the odour of the plant; and from _Macedonicum_,\r\nor the parsley of Macedon, Alexander's country. The herb\r\nwas also known as Stanmarch. It grows on waste places by\r\nrivers near the sea, having been formerly cultivated like celery,\r\nwhich has now supplanted it. When boiled it is eaten with avidity by\r\nsailors returning from long voyages, who happen to land at the\r\nSouth Western corner of Anglesea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY OF THE VALLEY.\r\n\r\nThe Lily of the Valley grows wild in many of our English woods,\r\nand possesses special curative virtues, which give it, according to\r\nmodern knowledge, a just place among Herbal Simples of repute.\r\nThis is the parent flower of our graceful, sweet-scented scape of\r\npendent, milk-white little floral bells, enshrined within two broad\r\nleafy blades of dark green, and finding general favour for the\r\n_jardiniere_, or the button-hole.\r\n\r\nIts name _Convallaria majalis_ is derived from _convallis_, \"a\r\nvalley,\" and _majalis_, \"belonging to the month of May,\" when this\r\nLily comes into flower.\r\n\r\nRustics corrupt the double title to \"Liry Confancy,\" and provincially\r\nthe plant is known as \"Wood Lily,\" \"May Lily,\" and \"May\r\nBlossom.\" Also it bears the name of Mugget, and is said to have\r\ngrown up after the bloody combat of St. Leonard with the Dragon.\r\nThe French call it _Muguet_, or \"little musk.\" The taste of the\r\nflowers is acrid and bitter; they have been [314] employed with\r\nbenefit, when dried and powdered, as snuff, for headache, and\r\ngiddiness arising from weakness. A tincture of the plant is made,\r\nand can be procured from any leading druggist. The active\r\nmedicinal principle is \"convallarin,\" which slows the disturbed\r\naction of a weak, irritable heart, whilst at the same time increasing\r\nits power. Happily the remedy is a perfectly safe one, and no harm\r\nhas been known to occur from taking it experimentally in full and\r\nfrequent doses; so that, in this respect, it is far preferable to the\r\nFox Glove, which is apt to accumulate in the blood with poisonous\r\nresults. To make the tincture of _Convallaria_, one part of the\r\nflowers is treated with eight parts of spirit of wine (proof); and the\r\ndose is from five to fifteen drops, with a tablespoonful of water,\r\nthree times in the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAlso an infusion may be made with boiling water poured over the\r\nwhole plant-root, stems, and flowers; and this infusion may be given\r\ncontinuously for from five to ten days; but it should be left off for a\r\ntime as soon as the irritability of the heart is subdued, and the pulse\r\nsteady and stronger. If taken during an attack of palpitation and\r\nlaboured breathing from a weak heart, the benefit of the infusion in\r\ntablespoonful doses is felt at once.\r\n\r\nTen grains of the dried flowers may be infused in six ounces of\r\nboiling water; and a tablespoonful of this be given three times a day\r\nwith perfect safety, and with a most soothing effect for a weak,\r\nsensitive, palpitating heart; but it does not suit a fatty heart\r\nequally well. Nevertheless, even for insufficiency of the valves, when\r\ndangerous, or distressing symptoms of heart disease have set in, an\r\ninfusion of the flowers has proved very helpful. The _rhizome_,\r\nroot, exhales a pleasant odour, [315] different from that of the\r\nflowers; it tastes sweet at first but afterwards bitter.\r\n\r\nA fluid extract is further prepared, and may be mixed in doses of\r\nfrom five to twenty drops with water. The Russian peasants have\r\nlong employed the Lily of the Valley for certain forms of dropsy,\r\nwhen proceeding from a faulty heart.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, when the flowers are in bloom, two drachms, by\r\nweight, of the leaves should be steeped in a pint of water, either cold\r\nor boiling; and the whole of this may be taken, if needed, during the\r\ntwenty-four hours. It will promote a free flow of urine. Culpeper\r\ncommended the Lily of the Valley for weak memory, loss of speech,\r\nand apoplexy; whilst Gerard advised it for gout. In Devonshire it is\r\nthought unlucky to plant a bed of these Lilies, as the person who\r\ndoes so will probably die within the next twelve months.\r\n\r\nIn the _Apocrypha_, Canticles ii, I, \"I am the Lily of the Valley,\"\r\nthis flower is apparently brought under notice, but some other plant\r\nmust be intended here, because the Lily Convally does not grow in\r\nPalestine. The word Lily is used in Oriental languages for a flower\r\nin general.\r\n\r\nDistilled water from the flowers was formerly in great repute against\r\nnervous affections, and for many troubles of the head, insomuch\r\nthat it was treasured in vessels of gold and silver. Matthiolus named\r\nit _Aqua aurea_, \"golden water\"; and Etmuller said of the virtues of\r\nthe plant, _Quod specifice armabit impotentes maritos ad bellum\r\nveneris_.\r\n\r\nA spirit made from the petals is excellent as an outward\r\nembrocation for rheumatism and sprains; and in some parts of\r\nGermany, a wine is prepared from the flowers mixed with raisins.\r\nOld Gerard adopted an [316] unaccountable method for extracting\r\nthese virtues of the Lilies. He ordered that, \"The flowers being close\r\nstopped up in a glass vessel, should be put into an ant hill, and taken\r\naway again a month after, when ye shall find a liquor in the glass\r\nwhich, being outwardly applied, will help the cure of the gout.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the blossom has fallen off a berry is formed, which assumes in\r\nthe autumn a bright scarlet colour, and proves attractive to birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME TREE, Flowers of (_Tiliaceoe_).\r\n\r\nThough not a native of Great Britain, yet, because of its common\r\ngrowth in our roadways and along the front of terraced houses, and\r\nin suburban avenues, the Lime Tree has become almost indigenous.\r\n\r\nIn the old _Herbals_ it is called Lyne or Line, Tillet, Till tree, and\r\nTilia, each of these names bearing reference to the bast or inner bark\r\nof the tree, which is used in the North for cordage. Others say the\r\nname is an alteration of Telia, from _telum_, a dart, alluding to the\r\nuse of the wood. Tilia is more probably derived from _ptilon_, a\r\nfeather, because of the feathery appearance of the floral leaves.\r\n\r\nShakespeare says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now, tell me thy name, good fellow,\" said he,\r\n    \"Under the leaves of lyne.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"n\" in later writers has been changed into \"m.\"\r\n\r\nIts sweet-smelling and highly fragrant flowers blossom in May, and\r\nare much sought after by bees, because abounding with honied\r\nnectar. A medicinal tincture (H.) is made from them with spirit of\r\nwine; and when given in doses of from five to ten drops with water,\r\nthree times in the day, it serves to relieve sick [317] bilious\r\ngiddiness, with depression of spirits, and a tendency to loose\r\nbowels, with nervous headache. The sap of the Lime Tree (_Tilia\r\nEuropoea_) abounds in mucilage, from which sugar can be elaborated.\r\nA tea made from the blossoms and leaves with boiling water,\r\nis admirable for promoting perspiration. It is because of a\r\nlong established reputation for giving relief in chronic epilepsy or\r\nthe falling sickness, and of curing epileptiform headaches, whilst\r\nproving of indisputable usefulness in allied nervous disorders, that\r\nthe flowers and leaves of the Lime or Linden Tree occupy a true\r\nplace among modern medicinal Simples. Gilbert White made some\r\nLime-blossom tea, and pronounced it a very soft, well-flavoured,\r\npleasant saccharine julep, much resembling the juice of liquorice.\r\nThis tea has been found efficacious for quieting hard coughs and for\r\nrelieving hoarseness.\r\n\r\nThe flowers easily ferment, and being so fragrant may be used for\r\nmaking wine: likewise a fine flavoured brandy has been distilled\r\nfrom them. The fruit contains an oily substance, and has been\r\nproposed, when roasted, as a domestic substitute for chocolate. The\r\nsap may be procured by making incisions in the trunk, and branches.\r\nThe flowers are sedative, and anti-spasmodic. Fenelon decorates his\r\nenchanted Isle of Calypso with flowering Lime trees. Hoffman says\r\n_Tilioe ad mille usus petendoe_.\r\n\r\nThe inner bark furnishes a soft mucilage, which may be applied\r\nexternally with healing effect to burns, scalds, and inflammatory\r\nswellings. Gerard taught, \"that the flowers are commended by divers\r\npersons against pain of the head proceeding from a cold cause;\r\nagainst dizziness, apoplexy, and the falling sickness; and not only\r\nthe flowers, but the distilled water thereof.\" [318] Hoffman knew a\r\ncase of chronic epilepsy recovered by a use of the flowers in infusion\r\ndrunk as tea. Such, indeed, was the former exalted anti-epileptic\r\nreputation of the Lime Tree, that epileptic persons sitting\r\nunder its shade were reported to be cured.\r\n\r\nA famous \"Lind\" or Lime Tree, which grew in his ancestral place,\r\ngave to the celebrated Linnaeus his significant name. The well-known\r\nstreet, _unter den Linden_ in Berlin, is a favourite resort,\r\nbecause of its pleasant, balmy shade; and when Heine lay beneath\r\nthe Lindens, he \"thought his own sweet nothing-at-all thoughts.\"\r\nThe wood of the Lime Tree is preferred before every other wood fur\r\nmasterly carving. Grinling Gibbons executed his best and most\r\nnoted work in this material; and the finely-cut details still remain\r\nsharp, delicate, and beautiful.\r\n\r\nChemically, the Linden flowers contain a particular light, fragrant,\r\nvolatile oil, which is soluble in alcohol. They are used in warm\r\nbaths with much success to allay nervous irritability; or a strong\r\ninfusion of them is administered by enema for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIQUORICE, English (_Leguminous_).\r\n\r\nThe common Liquorice plant, a native of the warmer European\r\ncountries, was first cultivated in Britain about 1562, in Turner's\r\ntime. It has been chiefly grown at Pontefract (Pomfret) in Yorkshire,\r\nWorksop in Nottinghamshire, and Godalming in Surrey; whilst at\r\nthe present time it is produced abundantly at Mitcham, near London,\r\nand the roots are dug up after a three years' growth, to be supplied to\r\nthe shops. The use of the Liquorice plant was first learnt by the\r\nHellenes from the Scythians; and the root was named _adipson_,\r\nbeing thought from the time of Theophrastus to [319] powerfully\r\nextinguish thirst. But Dr. Cullen says his experience has not\r\nconfirmed this as a true effect of chewing the root. When lightly\r\nboiled in a little water it yields all its sweetness, together with\r\nsome mucilage.\r\n\r\nA favourite pastime of school boys at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury, was to carry in the pocket a small phial of water containing\r\nbits of this \"Spanish juice,\" and to shake it continually so as to make\r\na solution, valued the more the darker and thicker it became.\r\n\r\nThe juice is commonly employed as a pectoral in coughs or\r\nhoarseness, when thickened to the consistence of a lozenge, or to\r\nthat of a solid mass, which hardens in the form of a stick. It is also\r\nadded to nauseous medicines, for masking their taste. Towards\r\nobtaining this juice the underground stem or root of the plant is the\r\npart employed.\r\n\r\nThe search of Diogenes for an honest man was scarcely more\r\ndifficult than would be that of an average person for genuine\r\nLiquorice; since the juice is adulterated to any extent, and there is\r\nno definite standard of purity for this article so commonly used.\r\nPotato starch, miller's sweepings mixed with sugar, and any kind of\r\nrubbish are added to it.\r\n\r\nIn China, the roots of _Glycyrrhiza echinata _and _Glycyrrhiza\r\nglabra_, are used in a variety of medicinal preparations as\r\npossessing tonic, alterative, and expectorant properties, and as a\r\nmild aperient. Thereto are attributed rejuvenating and highly\r\nnutritive qualities. English Liquorice root occurs in pieces three or\r\nfour inches long, and about as thick as a finger.\r\n\r\nThe extract of Liquorice must be prepared from the _dried_ root,\r\nelse it cannot be strained bright, and would be liable to\r\nfermentation. Chemically, the root [320] contains a special kind of\r\nsugar, glycyrrhizine, a demulcent starch, asparagin, phosphate and\r\nmalate of lime and magnesia, a resinous oil, albumen, and woody\r\nfibre. Old Fuller says concerning Nottingham, \"This county\r\naffordeth the first and best Liquorice in England: great is the use\r\nthereof in physick. A stick of the same is commonly the spoon\r\nprescribed to patients to use in any Loaches. If (as the men of\r\noeneas were forced to eat their own trenchers), these chance to eat\r\ntheir spoons, their danger is none at all.\" The Loach, or Lingence,\r\nfrom _ekleigma_, a substance licked-up, has become our modern\r\nlozenge. Extract of Liquorice is largely imported as \"Spanish\" or\r\n\"Italian\" juice, the Solazzi juice being most esteemed, which comes\r\nin cylindrical or flattened rolls, enveloped in bay leaves; but the\r\npipe Liquorice of the sweetstuff shops is adulterated. Pontefract\r\nlozenges are made of refined Liquorice, and are justly popular. The\r\nsugar of Liquorice may be safely taken by diabetic patients.\r\n\r\nOfficinally, the root and stolons (underground stems) of the\r\n_Glycyrrhiza glabra_ (smooth) are variously employed; for making\r\nan extract, for mixing with linseed in a tea, for combination with\r\npowdered senna, sugar, and fennel, to form a favourite mild laxative\r\nmedicine, known as \"Compound Liquorice Powder,\" and for other\r\nuses. The solid juice is put into porter and stout, because giving\r\nsweetness, thickness, and blackness to those beverages, without\r\nmaking them fermentative; but Liquorice, like gum, supplies\r\nscant aliment to the body. Black Liquorice is employed in the\r\nmanufacture of tobacco, for smoking and chewing.\r\n\r\nThe Rest Harrow (_Ononis arvensis_), a troublesome weed, very\r\ncommon in our ploughed fields, has a root [321] which affords a\r\nsweet viscid juice, and hence it is popularly known as \"Wild\r\nLiquorice.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a leguminous plant, called also \"Ground Furze,\" which is a\r\nfavourite food of the donkey, and therefore gets its botanical title\r\nfrom the Greek word _onos_, an ass. Its long and thickly matted\r\nroots will arrest the progress of the harrow, or plough. Medicinally,\r\nthe plant has been given with success to subdue delirium. It is\r\nobnoxious to snakes, and they will not come near it.\r\n\r\nOther appellations of the herb are Cammock, Stinking Tommy,\r\n_Arrete boeuf_, _Remora aratri_, _Resta bovis_, and Land Whin\r\n(which from the Latin _guindolum_, signifies a kind of cherry). The\r\nplant was formerly much extolled for obviating stone in the bladder.\r\nIt is seen to be covered with spines; and a tradition exists that it\r\nwas the Rest harrow which furnished the crown of thorns plaited by\r\nthe Roman soldiers at the crucifixion of our Saviour. This plant has\r\nbeen long-used as a culinary vegetable, its young shoots being\r\nboiled, or taken in salad, or pickled.\r\n\r\nThe French know it as _Bugrane_, beloved by goats, and the chief\r\ndelight of donkeys, who rejoice to roll themselves amid its prickles.\r\nSimon Pauli _ne connait pas de meilleur remede contre le calcul des\r\nreins, et de la vessie_. \"_Anjourdhui l'arr ete boeuf est a peu pres\r\nabandonne_.\" \"_On y reviendra!_\" The plant contains \"ononin,\" a\r\nchemical glucoside, which is demulcent to the urinary organs.\r\n\r\nIts botanical name of _Glycyrrhiza_ comes from the Greek words,\r\n_glukus_, \"sweet,\" and _riza_, \"a root.\" English Liquorice root,\r\nwhen dried, is commercially used in two forms, the peeled and the\r\nunpeeled. By far and away the best lozenges are those of our [322]\r\nboyhood, still attributed to one \"Smith,\" in the Borough of London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMALLOWS.\r\n\r\nAll the Mallows (_Malvaceoe_) to the number of a thousand, agree\r\nin containing mucilage freely, and in possessing no unwholesome\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nTheir family name \"Mallow\" is derived from the Greek _malassein_,\r\n\"to soften,\" as alluding to the demulcent qualities of these\r\nmucilaginous plants. The Common Mallow is a well-known roadside\r\nplant, with large downy leaves, and streaked trumpet-shaped\r\npurple flowers, which later on furnish round button-like\r\nseeds, known to the rustics as \"pickcheeses\" in Norfolk and\r\nelsewhere, whilst beloved by schoolboys, because of their nutty\r\nflavour, and called by them \"Bread and Cheese.\"\r\n\r\nClare tells playfully of the fairies, borne by mice at a gallop:--\r\n\r\n    \"In chariots lolling at their ease,\r\n    Made of whate'er their fancies please,\r\n    With wheels at hand of Mallow seeds,\r\n    Which childish sport had strung as beads.\"\r\n\r\nAnd recalls the time when he sat as a boy:--\r\n\r\n    \"Picking from Mallows, sport to please,\r\n    The crumpled seed we called a cheese.\"\r\n\r\nBoth this plant and its twin sister, the Marsh Mallow (_Althoea\r\nhibiscus_, from _altho_, to cure), possess medicinal virtues, which\r\nentitle them to take rank as curative Herbal Simples. The Sussex\r\npeasant knows the Common Mallow as \"Maller,\" so that \"aller and\r\nmaller\" means with him Alehoof (Ground Ivy) and Mallow. Pliny\r\nsaid: \"Whosoever shall take a spoonful of the [323] Mallows shall\r\nthat day be free from all diseases that may come to him.\"\r\n\r\nThis plant is often named \"Round Dock,\" and was formerly called\r\n\"Hock Herb\": our Hollyhock being of the Mallow tribe, and first\r\nbrought to us from China. Pythagoras held _Malvoe folium\r\nsanctissimum_; and we read of Epimenides in _Plato_, \"at his\r\nMallows and Asphodels.\" The Romans esteemed the plant _in deliciis_\r\namong their dainties, and placed it of old as the first dish at\r\ntheir tables. The laxative properties of the Mallow, both as regards\r\nits emollient leaves, and its _radix altheoe efficacior_, were told of\r\nby Cicero and Horace.\r\n\r\nThe _Marsh Mallow_ grows wild abundantly in many parts of England,\r\nespecially in marshes near the sea coast. It gets its generic\r\nname _althoea_, from the Greek _althos_, \"a remedy,\" because\r\nexercising so many curative virtues. Its old appellations were\r\n_Vismalva_, _Bismalva_, _Malvaviscus_, being twice as medicinally\r\nefficacious as the ordinary Mallow (_Sylvestris_).\r\n\r\nVirgil in one of his eclogues teaches how to coax goats with the\r\nMarsh Mallow:--\r\n\r\n    \"Haedorumque gregem viridi compellere hibisco.\"\r\n\r\nThe root is sweet and very mucilaginous when chewed, containing\r\nmore than half its weight of saccharine viscous mucilage. It is,\r\ntherefore, emollient, demulcent, pain-soothing, and lubricating;\r\nserving to subdue heat and irritation, whilst, if applied externally,\r\ndiminishing the painful soreness of inflamed parts. It is, for these\r\nreasons, much employed in domestic poultices, and in decoction as\r\na medicine for pulmonary catarrhs, hoarseness, and irritative\r\ndiarrhoea or dysentery. Also the decoction acts well as a bland\r\nsoothing collyrium for [324] bathing inflamed eyes. Gerard says:\r\n\"The leaves be with good effect mixed with fomentations and\r\npoultices against pains of the sides, of the stone, and of the bladder;\r\nalso in a bath they serve to take away any manner of pain.\"\r\n\r\nThe mucilaginous matter with which the Marsh Mallow abounds is\r\nthe medicinal part of the plant; the roots of the Common Mallow\r\nbeing useless to yield it for such purposes, whilst those of the Marsh\r\nMallow are of singular efficacy. A decoction of Marsh Mallow is\r\nmade by adding five pints of water to a quarter-of-a-pound of the\r\ndried root, then boiling down to three pints, and straining through\r\ncalico. Also Marsh Mallow ointment is a popular remedy, especially\r\nfor mollifying heat, and hence it was thought invaluable by those\r\nwho had to undergo the ordeal of holding red hot iron in their hands,\r\nto rapidly test their moral integrity. The sap of the Marsh Mallow\r\nwas combined together with seeds of Fleabane, and the white of an\r\nhen's egg, to make a paste which was so adhesive that the hands\r\nwhen coated with it were safe from harm through holding for a few\r\nmoments the glowing iron.\r\n\r\nFrench druggists prepare a famous medicinal sweet-meat, known as\r\n_Pate de gimauve_ from the root of the Marsh Mallow. In Palestine,\r\nthe plant is employed by the poor to eke out their food; thus we read\r\nin the book of Job (chap. xxx. ver. 4), \"Who cut up Mallows by the\r\nbushes, and juniper roots for their meat.\"\r\n\r\nIn France, the young tops and tender leaves of the Marsh Mallow\r\nare added to spring salads, as stimulating the kidneys healthily, for\r\nwhich purpose is likewise prepared a syrup of Marsh Mallows\r\n(_Syrupus Althoeus_) from the roots with cold water, to which the\r\n[325] sugar is afterwards added. The leaves, flowers, and roots, are\r\nemployed for making ptisans. In Devonshire, this plant is termed by\r\nthe farmers, \"Meshmellish,\" also \"Drunkards,\" because growing\r\nclose by the water; and in the West of England, \"Bulls-eyes\"; whilst\r\nbeing known in Somerset as \"Bull Flowers\" (pool flowers). The root\r\nof the Marsh Mallow contains starch, mucilage, pectin, oil, sugar,\r\nasparagin, phosphate of lime, glutinous matter and cellulose. An\r\ninfusion made with cold water takes up the mucilage, sugar, and\r\nasparagin, then the hot water dissolves the starch.\r\n\r\nThe flowers were used formerly on May-day by country people for\r\nstrewing before their doors, and weaving into garlands.\r\n\r\nThe Geranium is said to have been originally a Mallow. Mahomet\r\nhaving washed his shirt while on a journey, hung it on a Mallow to\r\ndry, and the plant became therefore promoted to be a Geranium.\r\n\r\nMost probably, the modern French _Pate de gimauve_ contains\r\nactually nothing of the plant or its constituents; but the root is\r\ngiven in France to infants, on which they may try their teeth\r\nduring dentition, much as Orris root is used elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe laxative quality of the common Mallow was mentioned by\r\nMartial:--\r\n\r\n    \"Exoneraturas ventrem mihi villica malvas\r\n    Attulit, et varias quas habet hortus opes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Musk Mallow (_Malva moschata_) is another common variety\r\nof this plant, which emits from its leaves a faint musky odour,\r\nespecially in warm weather, or when they are drawn lightly through\r\nthe hand. Its virtues are similar in kind, but less powerful in\r\ndegree, to those of the Marsh Mallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[326] MARIGOLD.\r\n\r\nIn the _Grete Herball_ this plant was called Mary Gowles. Three\r\nvarieties of the Marigold exercise medicinal virtues which constitute\r\nthem Herbal Simples of a useful nature--the Corn Marigold\r\n(_Chrysanthemum segetum_), found in our cornfields; the cultivated\r\ngarden Marigold (_Calendula officinalis_); and the Marsh\r\nMarigold (_Caltha palustris_), growing in moist grass lands, and\r\npopularly known as \"Mareblobs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Corn Marigold, a Composite flower, called also Bigold, and the\r\nYellow Oxeye, grows freely, though locally, in English cornfields,\r\nits brilliant yellow flowers contrasting handsomely with adjacent\r\nScarlet-hued Poppies and Bluebottles (_Centaurea cyanus_). It is\r\nalso named Buddle or Boodle, from _buidel_, a purse, because it\r\nbears _gools_ or _goldins_, representing gold coins, in the form of\r\nthe flat, round, brightly yellow blossoms, which were formerly\r\nknown, too, as _Ruddes_ (red flowers). The botanical title of the\r\nspecies, _Chrysanthemum segetum_, signifies \"golden flower.\"\r\n\r\nHill named this Marigold, \"the husbandman's dyall.\" In common\r\nwith the larger Oxeye Daisy (_Chrysanthemum leucanthemum_) it\r\nhas proved of late very successful in checking the night sweats of\r\npulmonary consumption. A tincture and an infusion of the herb have\r\nbeen made; from five to ten drops of the former being given for a\r\ndose, and from two to three tablespoonfuls of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe garden Marigold, often called African Marigold, came\r\noriginally from Southern France, and has been cultivated in England\r\nsince 1570. It is a Composite plant, and bears the name _Calendula_\r\nfrom the Latin _calendoe_, the first days of each month, because it\r\nflowers all the year round. Whittier styles it \"the grateful and [327]\r\nobsequious Marigold.\" The leaves are somewhat thick and sapid;\r\nwhen chewed, they communicate straightway a viscid sweetness,\r\nwhich is followed by a sharp, penetrating taste, very persistent in the\r\nmouth, and not of the warm, aromatic kind, but of an acrid, saline\r\nnature. This Marigold has always been grown, chiefly for its\r\nflowers, which were esteemed of old as a cordial to cheer the spirits,\r\nand when dried were put into broths as a condiment: Charles Lamb\r\n(Elia) says, in his _Essay on Christ's Hospital_: \"In lieu of our\r\nhalf-pickled Sundays, or quite fresh boiled beef on Tuesdays (strong as\r\n_caro equina_), with detestable Marigolds floating in the pail to\r\npoison the broth.\" The strap-like florets of the rays are the parts of\r\nthe flowers used for such a purpose. They should be gathered on a\r\nfine day when the blossoms are fully expanded, which having been\r\ndivested of their outer green leaves, should be next spread on a cloth\r\nin an airy room to become dry. After having been turned frequently\r\nfor a few days, they may be put by in paper bags or in drawers.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"The yellow leaves of the flowers are dried and kept\r\nthroughout Dutch-land against winter, to put into broths and\r\nphysical potions, and for divers other purposes, in such quantity that\r\nthe stores of some grocers or spice-sellers contain barrels filled with\r\nthem, and to be retailed by the penny, more or less; insomuch, that\r\nno broths are well made without dried Marigolds\"; and, \"The herb\r\ndrank after the coming forth from the bath of them that hath the\r\nyellow jaundice doth in short time make them well coloured.\" (This\r\nis probably conjectured on the doctrine of signatures.)\r\n\r\nA decoction of the flowers is employed by country people as a\r\nposset drink in measles and small-pox; and the expressed fresh juice\r\nproves a useful remedy against [328] costiveness, as well as for\r\njaundice and suppression of the monthly flow--from one to two\r\ntablespoonfuls being taken as a dose.\r\n\r\nThe plant has been considered also of service for scrofulous\r\nchildren, when given to them as a salad. One of the flowers if\r\nrubbed on any part recently stung by a bee or wasp, will quickly\r\nrelieve it.\r\n\r\nButtercups and Marigolds, when growing close to each other, are\r\ncalled in Devonshire, \"publicans and sinners.\" The active, bitter\r\nprinciple of the Marigold is \"callendulin,\" which is yellow and\r\ntasteless, whilst swelling in water into a transparent jelly. Druggists\r\nnow make a medicinal tincture (H.) of the common Marigold, using\r\nfour ounces of the dried florets to a pint of proof spirit, the dose\r\nbeing from half a teaspoonful to two teaspoonfuls in water, twice or\r\nthree times in the day. It is advised as a sudorific stimulant in low\r\nfevers, and to relieve spasms. Also, the Marigold has been\r\nemployed both as a medicine and externally in treating cancer,\r\nbeing thought to \"dispose cancerous sores to heal.\" A saturated\r\ntincture of the flowers when mixed with water, promotes the cure of\r\ncontusions, wounds, and simple sores or ulcers; also the extract will\r\nallay chronic vomiting, if given in doses of two grains, several times\r\na day. One drop of the tincture with two grains of powdered borax\r\nwhen sprayed into the ear, is very useful if a discharge has become\r\nestablished therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe plant, especially its flowers, was used on a large scale by the\r\nAmerican surgeons, to treat wounds and injuries sustained during\r\nthe last civil war; and obtained their warmest commendation. It\r\nquite prevented all exhausting suppurative discharges and drainings.\r\n_Succus Calenduloe_ (the fresh juice) is the best form--say\r\nAmerican surgeons--in which the _Calendula_ [329] is obtainable\r\nfor ready practice. Just sufficient alcohol should be added to the\r\njuice as will prevent fermentation. For these purposes as a\r\nvulnerary, the _Calendula_ owes its introduction and first use\r\naltogether to homoeopathic methods, as signally valuable for\r\nhealing wounds, ulcers, burns, and other breaches of the skin\r\nsurface. Dr. Hughes (Brighton) says: \"The Marigold is a precious\r\nvulnerary. You will find it invaluable in surgical practice.\"\r\n\r\nOn exposure to the sun the yellow colour of the garden Marigold\r\nbecomes bleached. Some writers spell the name \"Marygold,\" as if it,\r\nand its synonyms bore reference to the Virgin Mary; but this is a\r\nmistake, though there is a fancied resemblance of the disc's florets\r\nto rays of glory. It comes into blossom about March 25th (the\r\nAnnunciation of the Virgin Mary).\r\n\r\n    \"What flower is this which bears the Virgin's name,\r\n    And richest metal joined with the same?\"\r\n\r\nIn the chancel of Burynarbon Church, Devonshire, is an epitaph\r\ncontaining a quaint allusion to this old idea respecting the\r\nMarigold:--\"To the pretious memory of Mary, ye dear, and only\r\ndaughter of George Westwood. January 31st, 1648.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This Mary Gold, lo! here doth show\r\n        Mari's worth gold lies here below;\r\n    The Marigold in sunshine spread,\r\n        When cloudie closed doth bow the head.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret of Orleans had for her device a Marigold turning towards\r\nthe sun, with the motto, \"_je ne veux suivre que lui seul_.\"\r\n\r\nDairy women used to churn the petals of the Marigold with their\r\ncream for giving to their butter a yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh Marigold (_Caltha poetarum_) or the Marsh [330]\r\nHorsegowl of old writers, grows commonly in our wet meadows,\r\nand resembles a gigantic buttercup, being of the same order of\r\nplants (_Ranunculaceoe_). The term, Marsh Marigold, is a\r\npleonasm for Marigold, which means of itself the Marsh Gowl or\r\nMarsh Golden Flower, being an abbreviation of the old Saxon\r\n_mear-gealla_. So that the term \"Marsh\" has become prefixed\r\nunnecessarily. Presently, the name \"Marigold,\" \"Marsh Gowl,\" was\r\npassed on to the _Calendula_ of the corn fields of Southern Europe,\r\nand to the garden Marigold. Furthermore, the botanical title, Caltha,\r\nof the Mare Blob, is got from _calathus_, a small round basket of\r\ntwigs or osiers made two thousand years and more ago, which the\r\nconcave golden bowl of the Marsh Marigold was thought to\r\nresemble. Persephone was collecting wild flowers in a _Calathus_\r\nwhen carried off by the admiring Pluto. The earliest use of the floral\r\nname _Caltha_ occurs in Virgil's second Pastoral, \"_Mollia luteola\r\npingit vaccinia Caltha_.\" The title Mare Blob comes from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon, \"_mere_\" (a marsh), and \"_bleb_\" or \"_blob_\" (a\r\nbladder). These flowers were the _flaventia lumina Calthoe_ of\r\nColumella, described by Shakespeare in the _Winter's Tale_. They\r\nare also known as \"Bublicans,\" \"Meadowbrights,\" \"Crazies,\"\r\n\"Christ's Eyes,\" \"Bull's Eyes,\" \"May Blobs,\" \"Drunkards,\" \"Water\r\nCaltrops,\" and wild \"Batchelor's Buttons.\" A tincture is made (H.)\r\nfrom the whole plant when in flower, and may be given with\r\nsuccess for that form of bloodlessness with great impairment of the\r\nwhole health, known as pernicious anaemia. In toxic quantities the\r\nmarsh Marigold has produced in its provers, a pallid, yellow,\r\nswollen state of the face, constant headache and giddiness, a\r\nthickly-coated tongue, diarrhoea, a small rapid pulse sometimes\r\nintermittent, heaviness of the limbs, and an [331] unhealthy,\r\neruptive state of the skin; so that the tincture of the plant in small,\r\nwell-diluted doses will slowly overcome this totality of symptoms,\r\nand serve to establish a sound state of restored health. Five drops of\r\nthe tincture diluted to the third strength should be given three times\r\na day with water. Dr. Withering tells that on a large quantity of the\r\nflowers being put in the bed-room of a girl subject to fits, the\r\nattacks ceased; and an infusion of the flowers has been since given\r\nwith success for similar fits.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh Marigold has been called _Verrucaria_, because\r\nefficacious in curing warts; also _Solsequia_, or _Solsequium_; and\r\nSponsa Solis, since the flower opens at the rising, and shuts at the\r\nsetting of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORAM.\r\n\r\nThe common Marjoram (_Origanum_) grows frequently as a wild\r\nlabiate plant on dry, bushy places, especially in chalky districts\r\nthroughout Britain, the whole herb being fragrantly aromatic, and\r\nbearing flowers of a deep red colour. When cultivated in our kitchen\r\ngardens it becomes a favourite pot herb, as \"Sweet Marjoram,\" with\r\nthin compact spikes, and more elliptical leaves than the wild\r\nMarjoram. Its generic title, _Origanum_, means in Greek, the joy of\r\nthe mountains (_oros-ganos_) on which it grows.\r\n\r\nThis plant and the Pennyroyal are often called \"Organ.\" Its dried\r\nleaves are put as a pleasant condiment into soups and stuffings,\r\nbeing also sometimes substituted for tea. Together with the\r\nflowering tops they contain an essential volatile fragrant oil, which\r\nis carminative, warming, and tonic. An infusion made from the fresh\r\nplant will excellently relieve nervous headaches by virtue of the\r\ncamphoraceous principle [332] contained in the oil; and externally\r\nthe herb may be applied with benefit in bags as a hot fomentation to\r\npainful swellings and rheumatism, as likewise for colic. \"Organy,\"\r\nsays Gerard, \"is very good against the wambling of the stomacke,\r\nand stayeth the desire to vomit, especially at sea. It may be used to\r\ngood purpose for such as cannot brooke their meate.\"\r\n\r\nThe sweet Marjoram has also been successfully employed externally\r\nfor healing scirrhous tumours of the breast. Murray says: \"Tumores\r\nmammarum dolentes scirrhosos herba recens, viridis, per tempus\r\napplicata feliciter dissipavit.\" The essential oil, when long kept,\r\nassumes a solid form, and was at one time much esteemed for being\r\nrubbed into stiff joints. The Greeks and Romans crowned young\r\ncouples with Marjoram, which is in some countries the symbol of\r\nhonour. Probably the name was originally, \"Majoram,\" in Latin,\r\n_Majorana_. Our forefathers scoured their furniture with its odorous\r\njuice. In the _Merry Wives of Windsor_, Act v, Scene 5, we read:--\r\n\r\n    \"The several chairs of order look you scour\r\n    With juice of balm, and every precious flower.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY-DOG'S (_Euphorbiaceoe_).\r\n\r\nThe _Mercuriallis perennis_ (Dog's Mercury) grows commonly in\r\nour hedges and ditches, occurring in large patches, with egg-shaped\r\npointed leaves, square stems, and light green flowers, developed in\r\nspikes. The old herbalists called it Smerewort, and gave it for agues,\r\nas well as to cure melancholy humours. It has been eaten in mistake\r\nfor Good King Henry, which is sometimes called Mercury Goosefoot;\r\nbut it is decidedly poisonous, even when cooked. Some persons\r\nstyle it \"Kentish Balsam.\"\r\n\r\n[333] The name Dog's Mercury or Dog's Cole was given either\r\nbecause of its supposed worthlessness, or to distinguish it from the\r\nMercury Goosefoot aforesaid. A medicinal tincture is made (H.)\r\nfrom the whole plant freshly collected when in flower and fruit,\r\nwith spirit of wine; and the dose of this in a diluted form is from\r\nfive to ten drops, of the third decimal strength, two or three times a\r\nday, with a spoonful of water. The condition which indicates its\r\nmedicinal use, is that of a severe catarrh, with chilliness, a heavy\r\nhead, sneezing, a dry mouth, and general aching, lassitude, with\r\nstupor, and heat of face. Its chemical constituents have not been\r\nascertained. In the Isle of Skye it is used for causing salivation, as\r\na vegetable mercury; and _per contra_ for curing a sore mouth.\r\n\r\nSuch virtues as the herb possesses were thought to have been taught\r\nby the god Mercury. The Greeks called it Mercury's Grass (_Ermou\r\npoa_). When boiled and eaten with fried bacon in error for the\r\nEnglish spinach, Good King Henry, it has produced sickness,\r\ndrowsiness, and convulsive twitchings. The root affords both a blue\r\nand a crimson colour for dyeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINTS. (Pennyroyal, Peppermint, and Spearmint).\r\n\r\nSeveral kinds of the Mints have been used medicinally from the\r\nearliest times, such as Balm, Basil, Ground Ivy, Horehound,\r\nMarjoram, Pennyroyal, Peppermint, Rosemary, Sage, Savory,\r\nSpearmint, and Thyme, some being esteemed rather as pot herbs,\r\nthan as exercising positive medicinal effects. The most useful as\r\nHerbal Simples which have yet to be considered are Pennyroyal,\r\nPeppermint, and Spearmint. The Cat Mint (_Nepeta cataria_) and\r\nHorse Mint are of minor importance.\r\n\r\n[334] All the Mints are severally provided with leaves of a familiar\r\nfragrant character, it having been observed that this aromatic\r\nvegetation is a feature of deserts, and of other hot, dry places,\r\nallover the world. Tyndall showed the power exercised by a spray of\r\nperfume when diffused through a room to cool it, or in other words\r\nto exclude the passage of the heat rays; and it has been suggested\r\nthat the presence of essential oils in the leaves of these plants\r\nserves to protect them against the intense dry heat of a desert sun\r\nall effectively as if they were partly under shelter. Nevertheless\r\nMints, with the exception of \"Arvensis,\" are the inhabitants of wet\r\nand marshy wastes.\r\n\r\nThey have acquired their common name _Mentha_ from Minthes\r\n(according to Ovid) who was changed into a plant of this sort by\r\nProserpina, the wife of Pluto, in a fit of jealousy. Their flowering\r\ntops are all found to contain a certain portion of camphor. Pliny\r\nsaid: \"As for the garden Mint, the very smell of it alone recovers\r\nand refreshes the spirits, as the taste stirs up the appetite for meat,\r\nwhich is the reason that it is so general in our acid sauces, wherein\r\nwe are accustomed to dip our meat.\" The Mints for paying tithes,\r\nwith respect to which the Pharisees were condemned for their\r\nextravagance by our Saviour, included the Horse Mint (_Sylvestris_),\r\nthe round-leaved Mint, the hairy Mint (_Aquatica_), the Corn\r\nMint (_Arvensis_), the Bergamot Mint, and some others, besides\r\nthe \"Mint, Rue, and Anise,\" specially mentioned. \"Woe unto\r\nyou Pharisees; for ye tithe Mint and Rue, and all manner of herbs.\r\nYe pay tithe of Mint, and Anise, and Cummin.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mint Pennyroyal (_Mentha Pulegium_) gets its name from the\r\nLatin _puleium regium_, because of its royal efficacy in destroying\r\nfleas (_pulices_). The French call [335] this similarly, _Pouliot_. It\r\ngrows on moist heaths and pastures, and by the margins of brooks,\r\nbeing cultivated further in our herb gardens, for kitchen and market\r\nuses. Also, it is produced largely about Mitcham, and is mostly sold\r\nin a dry state. The herb was formerly named Pudding Grass, from its\r\nbeing used to make the stuffing for meat, in days when this was\r\ntermed a pudding. Thus we read in an old play, _The Ordinary_:--\r\n\r\n        \"Let the corporal\r\n     Come sweating under a breast of mutton stuffed with\r\n        [pudding].\"\r\n\r\nThe Pennyroyal was named by the Greeks _Bleekon_ and _Gleekon_,\r\nbeing often used by them as a condiment for seasoning different\r\nviands. Formerly it was known in England as \"Lurk in ditch,\"\r\nand \"Run by the ground,\" from its creeping nature, arid love\r\nof a damp soil. Its first titles were \"Puliall Royall,\" and \"Hop\r\nMarjoram.\" A chaplet of Pennyroyal was considered admirable for\r\nclearing the brain. Treadwell says, the Pennyroyal was especially\r\nput into hog's puddings, which were made of flour, currants, and\r\nspice, and stuffed into the entrail of a hog.\r\n\r\nThe oil of Pennyroyal is used commercially in France and Germany.\r\nIts distilled water is carminative and anti-spasmodic; whilst the\r\nwhole plant is essentially stimulating. The fresh herb yields about\r\none per cent. of a volatile oil containing oxygen, but of which the\r\nexact composition has not been ascertained. From two to eight drops\r\nmay be given as a dose in suitable cases, but not where feverish or\r\ninflammatory symptoms are present.\r\n\r\nIf added to an ordinary embrocation the oil of [336] Pennyroyal\r\nincreases the reddening and the benumbing (anodyne) effects, acting\r\nin the same way as, menthol (oil of Peppermint) for promptly\r\ndispelling severe neuralgic pain. With respect to the Pennyroyal,\r\nfolk speak in Devonshire of \"Organs,\" \"Organ Tea,\" and \"Organ\r\nBroth.\" An essence is made of the oil, mixed and diluted with spirit\r\nof wine. The Pennyroyal has proved useful in whooping cough; but\r\nthe chief purpose to which it has long been devoted, is that of\r\npromoting, the monthly flow with women. Haller says he never\r\nknew an infusion of the herb in white wine, with steel, to fail of\r\nsuccess; _Quod me nunquam fefellit_. It is certain that in some parts\r\nof England preparations of Pennyroyal are in considerable demand,\r\nand a great number of women ascribe _emmenagogue_ properties to\r\nit, that is, the power of inducing the periodical monthly flux. Many\r\nmarried women of intelligence and close observation, assert as a\r\npositive fact, that Pennyroyal will bring on the periodical flow when\r\nsuppressed; and yet the eminent jurisprudist, Dr. Taylor, was\r\nexplicit in declaring that Pennyroyal has no such properties. He\r\nstated that it has no more effect on the womb than peppermint or\r\ncamphor water. So there is difficulty in collecting evidence as\r\nregards the real action of Pennyroyal in such respect. Chemists\r\nsupply the medicine in the full belief of this eminent opinion just\r\nquoted: at the same time they know it is not wanted for \"catarrh of\r\nthe chest,\" as alleged. The purchaser keeps her secret to herself, and\r\ndoes not communicate her experience to anyone. Dr. Taylor\r\nevidently supposed Peppermint water and Camphor water to be\r\nalmost inert, especially as exercising any toxical effect on the\r\nwomb. The medicinal basis of the latter is certainly a powerful\r\nagent, and its stimulating volatile principles [337] are found to exist\r\nin most of the aromatic herbs; in fact, Camphor is a concrete volatile\r\nvegetable oil, and camphoraceous properties signalise all the\r\nessences derived from carminative Herbal Simples.\r\n\r\nThe Camphor of commerce is secreted by trees of the laurel sort\r\nnative to China and Japan, whilst coming also from the West Indies.\r\nEveryone knows by sight and smell the white crystalline granular\r\nsemi-translucent gum, strongly odorous, and having a warm\r\npungent characteristic taste. Branches, leaves, and chips of the trees\r\nare soaked in water until it is saturated with the extract, which is\r\nthen turned out into an earthen basin to coagulate. This is\r\ncompletely soluble in spirit of wine, but scarcely at all in water;\r\nnevertheless, if a lump of the Camphor be kept in a bottle of fresh\r\nwater, to be drawn off from time to time as required, it will\r\nconstitute Camphor julep. A wineglassful of it serves to relieve\r\nnervous headache and hysterical depression.\r\n\r\nThe domestic uses of Camphor are multiple, and within moderate\r\nlimits perfectly safe; but a measure of caution should be exercised,\r\nas was shown a while ago by the school-boy, whom his mother\r\nfurnished affectionately after the holidays with a bottle of\r\nsupersaturated pilules to be taken one or two at a time against any\r\nincipient catarrh or cold. The whole bottleful was devoured at once\r\nas a sweetmeat, and the lad's life was rescued with difficulty\r\nbecause of intense nervous shock occasioned thereby.\r\n\r\nAn old Latin adage declares that _Camphora per nares emasculat\r\nmares_, \"Camphor in excess makes men eunuchs,\" even when\r\nimbibed only through the air as a continuous practice. And,\r\ntherefore, as a \"similar\" the odorous gum, in small repeated doses, is\r\nan excellent sexual restorative. Likewise, persons who have taken\r\npoisonous, or large [338] probative quantities of Camphor found\r\nthemselves quickly affected by exhausting choleraic diarrhoea; and\r\nHahnemann therefore advised, with much success, to give (in doses\r\nof from one to three or four drops on sugar), repeatedly for cholera,\r\na tincture of Camphor (Rubini's) made with spirit of wine above\r\nproof. This absorbs as much as is possibly soluble of the drug.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically Camphor acts by reducing reflex nervous irritability.\r\nExternally its spirit makes an admirable warming liniment,\r\neither by itself, or when conjoined with other rubefacients.\r\nIn persons poisoned by the drug, all the superficial blood vessels of\r\nthe bodily skin have been found immensely dilated; acting on a\r\nknowledge of which fact anyone wishing to produce copious\r\ngeneral sweating, may do so by sitting over a plate on which\r\nCamphor is heated, whilst a blanket envelops the body loosely, and\r\nis pinned round the neck so that the fumes do not get down the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nIn medical books of the last century this substance was called\r\n\"Camphire.\" To a certain extent its effluvium is noxious to insects,\r\nand it may therefore be employed for preserving specimens, as well\r\nas for protecting fabrics against moths. But its volatile odours\r\nswiftly evaporate, and become even offensively diffused about the\r\nroom. In a moderate measure Camphor is antiseptic, and lessens\r\nurinary irritation. Recently a dose of ninety-six grains, taken\r\ntoxically, produced giddiness, then epileptic convulsions, with\r\ndilated pupils, and stertor of breathing.\r\n\r\nThe Peppermint (_Mentha piperita_), or \"Brandy Mint,\" so called\r\nbecause having a pungent smell, and taste of a peppery (_piper_)\r\nnature, is a labiate plant, found not uncommonly in moist places\r\nthroughout Britain, and occurring of several varieties. Both it and\r\nthe Spearmint [390] probably escaped from cultivation at first, and\r\nthen became our wild plants. Its leaves and stems exhale a powerful,\r\nrefreshing, characteristic aroma, and give a taste which, whilst\r\ndelicate at first, is quickly followed by a sense of numbness and\r\ncoldness, increased by inspiring strongly. Preparations of\r\nPeppermint, when swallowed, diffuse warmth in the stomach and\r\nmouth, acting as a stimulating carminative, with some amount of\r\nanodyne power to allay the pain of colic, flatulence, spasm, or\r\nindigestion. This is through the powerful volatile oil, of which the\r\nherb yields one per cent.\r\n\r\nIts bruised fresh leaves, if applied, will relieve local pains and\r\nheadache. A hot infusion, taken as tea, soothes stomach ache, allays\r\nsickness, and stays colicky diarrhoea. This will also subdue\r\nmenstrual colic in the female. The essential oil owes its virtues to\r\nthe menthol, or mint camphor, which it contains.\r\n\r\nThe Peppermint is largely grown at Mitcham, and is distilled on the\r\nground at a low temperature, the water which comes away with the\r\noil not being re-distilled, but allowed for the most part to run off.\r\n\r\nChinese oil of Peppermint (_Po Ho Yo_) yields menthol in a solid\r\ncrystalline form, which, when rubbed over the surface of a painful\r\nneuralgic part, will afford speedy and marked relief, as also for\r\nneuralgic tooth-ache, tic douloureux, and the like grievous troubles.\r\nIt is sold in diminutive bottles and cases labelled with Chinese\r\ncharacters. An ethereal tincture of menthol is made officinally with\r\none part of menthol to eight parts of pure ether. If some of this is\r\ninhaled by vaporisation from a mouthpiece inhaler, or is sprayed\r\ninto the nostrils and hindermost throat, it will relieve acute\r\naffections thereof, and of the nose, by making the blood vessels\r\ncontract, and by arresting the flow of mucous discharge, [340]\r\nthus diminishing the congestion, and quieting the pain. This\r\ncamphoraceous oil was formerly applied by the Romans to the\r\ntemples for the cure of headache. In local rheumatic affections the\r\nskin may be painted beneficially with oil of Peppermint. For internal\r\nuse, from one to three drops of the oil may be given as a dose on\r\nsugar, or in a spoonful of milk; but the diluted essence, made from\r\nsome of the oil admixed with spirit of wine, is to be preferred. Put\r\non cotton wool into the hollow of a carious tooth, a drop or two of\r\nthe essential oil will often ease the pain speedily. The fresh plant,\r\nbruised, and applied against the pit of the stomach over the navel,\r\nwill allay sickness, and is useful to stay the diarrhoeic purging of\r\nyoung children. From half to one teaspoonful of the spirituous\r\nessence of Peppermint may be given for a dose with two tablespoonfuls\r\nof hot water; or, if Peppermint water be chosen, the dose\r\nof this should be from half to one wineglassful. Distilled\r\nPeppermint water should be preferred to that prepared by adding the\r\nessence to common water. Lozenges made of the oil, or the essence,\r\nare admirable for affording ease in colic, flatulence, and nausea.\r\nThey will also prevent or relieve sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom Hood lay a dying he turned his eyes feebly towards the\r\nwindow on hearing it rattle in the night, whereupon his wife, who\r\nwas watching him, said softly. \"It's only the wind, dear\"; to which\r\nhe replied, with a sense of humour indomitable to the last, \"Then put\r\na Peppermint lozenge on the sill.\"\r\n\r\nTwo sorts of this herb are cultivated for the market--black and white\r\nPeppermint, the first of which furnishes the most, but not the best\r\noil. The former has purple stems, and the latter green. As an\r\nantiseptic, and destroyer of disease germs, this oil is signally\r\nefficacious, [341] on which important account it is now used for\r\ninhalation by consumptive patients as a volatile vapour to reach\r\nremote diseased parts of the lung passages, and to heal by\r\ndestroying the morbid germs which are keeping up mischief therein.\r\nTowards proving this preservative power exercised by the oil of\r\nPeppermint, pieces of meat, and of fat, wrapped in several layers of\r\ngauze medicated with the oil have been kept for seven months\r\nsweet, and free from putrescent changes. A simple respirator for\r\ninhaling the oil is made from a piece of thin perforated zinc plate\r\nadapted to the shape of the mouth and nostrils like a small open\r\nfunnel, within the narrow end of which is fitted a pledget of cotton\r\nwool saturated with twenty drops of the oil, or from twenty to thirty\r\ndrops of the spirituous essence. This should be renewed each night\r\nand morning, whilst the apparatus is to be worn nearly all day. At\r\nthe same time the oil is agreeable of odour, and is altogether\r\nharmless. It may be serviceably admixed with liniments for use to\r\nrheumatic parts.\r\n\r\n\"Peppermint,\" says Dr. Hughes (Brighton), \"should be more largely\r\nemployed than it is in coughs, especially in a dry cough, however\r\ncaused, when it seems to act specifically as a cure, just as arnica\r\ndoes for injuries, or aconite for febrile inflammation. It will relieve\r\neven the irritative hectic cough of consumptive patients. Eight or ten\r\ndrops of the essence should be given for this purpose as a dose with\r\na tablespoonful of water. In France continuous inhalations of\r\nPeppermint oil combined with creasote and glycerine, have become\r\nused most successfully, even when cavities exist in the lungs, with\r\ncopious bacillary expectoration. The cough, the night sweats, and\r\nthe heavy phlegm have been arrested, whilst the nutrition and the\r\nweight have steadily increased.\"\r\n\r\n[342] A solution of menthol one grain, spirit of wine fifty drops, and\r\noil of cloves ten drops, if painted over the seat of pain, will relieve\r\nneuralgia of the face, or sciatica promptly. Unhealthy sores may be\r\ncleansed, and their healing promoted, by being dressed with strips\r\nof soft rag dipped in sweet oil, to each ounce of which one or two\r\ndrops of the oil of Peppermint has been added. For diphtheria,\r\nPeppermint oil has been of marked use when applied freely twice or\r\nthree times in the day to the ulcerated parts of the throat. This oil,\r\nor the essence, can be used of any strength, in any quantity, without\r\nthe least harm to the patient. It checks suppuration when applied to a\r\nsore or wound, whilst exercising an independent antiseptic\r\ninfluence. \"Altogether,\" says Dr. Braddon, \"the oil of Peppermint\r\nforms the best, safest, and most agreeable of known antiseptics.\"\r\nPliny tells that the Greeks and Romans crowned themselves with the\r\nPeppermint at their feasts, and adorned their _al fresco_ tables with\r\nits sprays. The \"chefs\" introduced this herb into all their sauces, and\r\nscented their wines with its essence. The Roman housewives made a\r\npaste of the Peppermint with honey, which they esteemed highly,\r\npartaking of it to sweeten their breath, and to conceal their passion\r\nfor wine at a time when the law punished with death every woman\r\nconvicted of quaffing the ruby seductive liquor. Seneca perished in\r\na bath scented with woolly mint.\r\n\r\nThe Spearmint (_Mentha viridis_) is found growing apparently wild\r\nin England, but is probably not an indigenous herb. It occurs in\r\nwatery places, and on the banks of rivers, such as the Thames, and\r\nthe Exe. If used externally, its strong decoction will heal chaps and\r\nindolent eruptions.\r\n\r\nIt possesses a warm, aromatic odour and taste, much [343]\r\nresembling those of Peppermint, but not so pungent. Its volatile oil,\r\nand its essence, made with spirit of wine, contain a similar\r\nstimulating principle, but are less intense, and therefore better\r\nadapted for children's maladies.\r\n\r\nThe Spearmint is called \"Mackerel Mint,\" and in Germany \"Lady's\r\nMint,\" with a pun on the word munze. Its name, Spear, or Spire,\r\nindicates the spiry form of its floral blossoming. When the leaves of\r\nthe herb are macerated in milk, this curdles much less quickly than\r\nit otherwise would; and therefore the essence is to be commended\r\nfor use with milk diets by delicate persons, or for young children of\r\nfeeble digestive powers, though not when feverishness is present.\r\n\"Spearmint,\" says John Evelyn, \"is friendly to the weak stomach,\r\nand powerful against all nervous crudities.\" \"This is the Spearmint\r\nthat steadies giddiness,\" writes Alfred Austin, Poet Laureate.\r\n\r\nOur cooks employ it with vinegar for making the mint sauce which\r\nwe eat with roast lamb, because of its condimentary virtues as a\r\nspice to the immature meat, whilst the acetic acid of the vinegar\r\nserves to help dissolve the crude albuminous fibre.\r\n\r\nThe oil is less used than that of Peppermint. From two to five drops\r\nmay be given on sugar; or from half to one teaspoonful of the spirit\r\nof Spearmint with two tablespoonfuls of water. Also a distilled\r\nwater of Spearmint is made, which will relieve hiccough, and\r\nflatulence, as well as the giddiness of indigestion. The tincture\r\nprepared from the dried herb looks of a bright dark green by day,\r\nbut of a deep red colour by night. Martial called the Spearmint\r\n_Rutctatrix mentha_. \"_Nec deest ructatrix mentha_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Calamint, or Basil Thyme, grows frequently in [344] our\r\nwaysides and hedges, a labiate plant, with downy stems and leaves,\r\nwhilst bearing light purple flowers. The whole herb has a sweet,\r\naromatic odour, and makes a pleasant cordial tea. It is named from\r\nthe Greek kalos, \"excellent,\" because thought useful against\r\nserpents; \"There is made hereof,\" said Galen, \"An antidote\r\nmarvellous good for young women that want their courses.\"\r\n\r\nThe stem of this pretty slender herb is seldom more than five or six\r\ninches high, and its blossoms are so inconspicuous as to be often\r\noverlooked. The flowers droop gracefully before expansion. In\r\ncountry places it is often called Mill Mountain, and its infusion is an\r\nold remedy for rheumatism. If bruised, and applied externally, it\r\nreddens the skin, and will sometimes even blister it. In this way it\r\nacts well when judiciously used for lumbago, and rheumatic pains.\r\nThe Calamint contains a camphoraceous, volatile, stimulating oil, in\r\ncommon with the other mints; this is distilled by water, but its\r\nvirtues are better extracted by rectified spirit. The lesser Calamint\r\nis a variety of the herb possessing almost superior virtues, with a\r\nstronger odour resembling that of Pennyroyal. \"Apple Mint\" is the\r\n\"_Mentha rotundifolia_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Many robust men and women among our peasantry,\" says Dr.\r\nGeorge Moore, \"from notions of their own, use infusions of Balm,\r\nSage, or even a little Rue, or wild Thyme, as a common drink, with\r\nsatisfaction to their stomachs, and advantage to their health, instead\r\nof infusing the Chinese herb.\" The Calamint is a favourite herb with\r\nsuch persons. About the Cat mint there is an old saying, \"If you set\r\nit the cats will eat it: if you sow it the cats won't know it.\" This,\r\nthe _Nepeta cataria_, or _herbe aux chats_, is as much beloved by cats\r\nas _Valerian_, [345] and the common _Marum_, for which herbs\r\nthey have a frenzied passion. They roll themselves over the plants,\r\nwhich they lick, tear with their teeth, and bathe with their urine. But\r\nthe Cat mint is the detestation of rats, insomuch that with its leaves\r\na small barricade may be constructed which the vermin will never\r\npass however hungry they may be. It is sometimes called \"Nep,\" as\r\ncontracted from _Nepeta_. Hoffman said, \"The root of the Cat\r\nmint, if chewed, will make the most gentle person fierce and\r\nquarrelsome\"; and there is a legend of a certain hangman who could\r\nnever find courage to exercise his gruesome task until he had\r\nmasticated some of this aromatic root.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTLETOE.\r\n\r\nThe Mistletoe, which we all associate so happily with the festivities\r\nof Christmas, is an evergreen parasite, growing on the branches of\r\ndeciduous trees, and penetrating with simple roots through the bark\r\ninto the wood. It belongs to the _Loranthaceoe_, and has the\r\nbotanical name of _Viscum_, or \"sticky,\" because of its glutinous\r\njuices. The Mistletoe contains mucilage, sugar, a fixed oil, resin, an\r\nodorous principle, some tannin, and various salts. Its most\r\ninteresting constituent is the \"viscin,\" or bird glue, which is mainly\r\ndeveloped by fermentation, and becomes a yellowish, sticky,\r\nresinous mass, such as can be used with success as a bird-lime.\r\n\r\nThe dried young twigs, and the leaves, are chiefly the medicinal\r\nparts, though young children have been attacked with convulsions\r\nafter eating freely of the berries.\r\n\r\nThe name (in Anglo-Saxon, _Mistiltan_) is derived, says Dr. Prior,\r\nfrom _mistil_, \"different,\" and _tan_, \"a twig,\" [346] because so\r\nunlike the tree it grows upon; or, perhaps, _mist_ may refer to\r\nexcrement, and the adjective, _viscum_, bear some collateral\r\nreference to viscera, \"entrails.\" Probably our _viscum_ plant differs\r\nfrom that of the Latin writers in their accounts of the Druids, which\r\nwould be the _Loranthus_ growing on the _Quercus pubescens_ (an\r\noak indigenous to the south of France). They knew it by a name\r\nanswering to \"all-heal.\" It is of a larger and thicker sort than our\r\ncommon Mistletoe, which, however, possesses the same virtues in a\r\nlesser degree. The Germans call the plant _Vogellein_, and the\r\nFrench _Gui_, which is probably Celtic.\r\n\r\nThe plant is given powdered, or as an infusion, or made into a\r\ntincture (H.) with spirit of wine. From ten to sixty grains of the\r\npowder may be taken for a dose, or a decoction may be made by\r\nboiling two ounces of the bruised plant with half-a-pint of water,\r\nand giving one tablespoonful for a dose several times in the day; or\r\nfrom five to ten drops of the tincture (which is prepared almost\r\nexclusively by the homoeopathic chemists) are a dose, with one or\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of cold water.\r\n\r\nSir John Colebatch published in 1720 a pamphlet, on _The\r\nTreatment of Epilepsy by Mistletoe_, regarding it, and with much\r\njustice, as a specific. He procured the parasite from the lime trees at\r\nHampton Court. The powdered leaves were ordered to be given (in\r\nblack cherry water), as much of these as will lie on a sixpence every\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nSir John says, \"This beautiful plant must have been designed by the\r\nAlmighty for further and more noble purposes than barely to feed\r\nthrushes, or to be hung up superstitiously in houses to drive away\r\nevil spirits.\" His treatise was entitled, _A Dissertation concerning\r\nthe Misseltoe--A most wonderful Specifick Remedy for the Cure of\r\nConvulsive Distempers_. The physiological effect of the [347] plant\r\nis that of lessening, and temporarily benumbing such nervous action\r\nas is reflected to distant organs of the body from some central organ\r\nwhich is the actual seat of trouble. In this way the spasms of\r\nepilepsy and of other convulsive distempers, are allayed. Large\r\ndoses of the plant, or of its berries, would, on the contrary,\r\naggravate these convulsive disorders.\r\n\r\nIn a French \"_Recueil de Remedes domestiques_,\" 1682, _Avec\r\nprivilege du Roy_, we read, de l'epilepsie: \"Il est certain que contre\r\nce deplorable mal le veritable Guy de Chene (Mistletoe) est un\r\nremede excellent, curatif, preservatif, et qui soulage beaucoup dans\r\nl'accident. Il le faut secher au four apres qu'on aura tire le pain: le\r\nmettre en poudre fort subtile; passer cette poudre par un tamis de\r\nfoye, et la conserver pour le besoin. Il faut prendre les poids dun ecu\r\nd'or de cette poudre chaque matin dans vin blanc tous les trois\r\nderniers jours de la lune vieille. Il est encore bon que la personne\r\naffligee de ce mal porte toujours un morceau de Guy de Chene\r\npendu a son col; mais ce morceau doit etre toujours frais, et sans\r\navoir ete mis au four.\" The active part of the plant is its resin\r\n(_viscin_), which is yielded to spirit of wine in making a tincture.\r\nThis is prepared (H.) with proof spirit from the leaves and ripe\r\nberries of our Mistletoe in equal quantities, but it is difficult of\r\nmanufacture owing to the viscidity of the sap. A special process is\r\nemployed of passing the material twice through a sausage machine,\r\nand then mixing the mass with powdered glass before its percolation\r\nwith the spirit. A trituration made from the leaves, berries, and\r\ntender twigs, is given for epilepsy, in doses of twenty grains, twice\r\nor three times a day.\r\n\r\nNowadays the berries are taken by country people when finding\r\nthemselves troubled with severe stitches, [348] and they obtain\r\nalmost instantaneous relief. In accordance with which experience\r\nJohnson says it was creditably reported to him, \"That a few of the\r\nberries of the Misseltoe, bruised and strained into oyle and drunken,\r\nhath presently and forthwith rid a grievous and sore stitch.\" The\r\ntincture, moreover, is put to a modern use as a heart tonic in place of\r\nthe foxglove. It lessens reflex irritability, and strengthens the\r\nheart's beat, whilst raising the frequency of a slow pulse. Dr. J.\r\nWilde has shown that the Mistletoe possesses a high repute in rural\r\nHampshire for the cure of St. Vitus's dance, and similar spasmodic\r\nnervous complaints. In the United States the leaves have been\r\nsuccessfully employed as an infusion to check female fluxes, and\r\nhaemorrhages, also to hasten childbirth by stimulating the womb when\r\nlabour is protracted to the exhaustion of the mother. In Scotland\r\nthe plant is almost unknown, and is restricted to one locality only.\r\n\r\nThe Druids regarded the Mistletoe as the soul of their sacred tree--\r\nthe oak; and they taught the people to believe that oaks on which it\r\nwas seen growing were to be respected, because of the wonderful\r\ncures which the priests were then able to effect with it, particularly\r\nof the falling sickness. The parasite was cut from the tree with a\r\ngolden sickle at a high and solemn festival, using much ceremonial\r\ndisplay, it being then credited with a special power of \"giving\r\nfertility to all animals.\" Ovid said, \"Ad viscum cantare Druidoe\r\nsolebant.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare calls it \"The baleful Mistletoe,\" in allusion to the\r\nScandinavian legend, that Balder, the god of peace, was slain with\r\nan arrow made of Mistletoe. He was restored to life at the request of\r\nthe other gods and goddesses. The mistletoe was afterwards given to\r\n[349] be kept by the goddess of love; and it was ordained in\r\nOlympus that everyone who passed under it should receive a kiss, to\r\nshow that the branch was the emblem of love, and not of death.\r\n\r\nPersons in Sweden afflicted with epilepsy carry with them a\r\nknife having a handle of oak mistletoe, which plant they call\r\nThunder-besom, connecting it with lightning and fire. The thrush is\r\nthe great disseminator of the parasite. He devours the berries\r\neagerly, and soils, or \"missels\" his feet with their viscid seeds,\r\nconveying them thus from tree to tree, and getting thence the name\r\nof missel thrush.\r\n\r\nIn Brittany the plant is named _Herbe de la croix_, and, because the\r\ncrucifix was made from its wood when a tree, it is thought to have\r\nbecome degraded to a parasite.\r\n\r\nWhen Norwood, in Surrey, was really a forest the Mistletoe grew\r\nthere on the oak, and, being held as medicinal, it was abstracted for\r\napothecaries in London. But the men who meddled with it were said\r\nto become lame, or to fall blind with an eye, and a rash fellow who\r\nventured to cut down the oak itself broke his leg very shortly\r\nafterwards. One teaspoonful of the dried leaves, in powder, from the\r\nappletree Mistletoe, taken in acidulated water twice a day, will cure\r\nchronic giddiness. Sculptured sprays and berries, with leaves of\r\nMistletoe, fill the spandrils of the tomb of one of the Berkeleys in\r\nBristol Cathedral--a very rare adornment, because for some\r\nunknown reason the parasite has been always excluded from the\r\ndecorations of churches. In some districts it is called Devil's-fuge,\r\nalso the Spectre's Wand, from a belief that with due incantations a\r\nbranch held in the hand will compel the appearance of a spectre, and\r\nrequire it to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[350] MOUNTAIN ASH.\r\n\r\nA somewhat common, and handsomely conspicuous tree in many\r\nparts of England, especially about high lands, is the Rowan, or\r\nMountain Ash. In May and June it attracts attention by its bright\r\ngreen feathery foliage set off by cream-coloured bloom, whilst in\r\nSeptember it bears a brilliant fruitage of berries, richly orange in\r\ncolour at first, but presently of a clear ripe vermilion. Popularly\r\nthis abundant fruit is supposed to be poisonous, but such is far from\r\nbeing the case. A most excellent and wholesome jelly may be\r\nprepared therefrom, which is slightly tonic by its salutary bitterness,\r\nand is an admirable antiseptic accompaniment to certain roast meats,\r\nsuch as venison and mutton. To make this jelly, boil the berries in\r\nwater (cold at first) in an enamelled preserving pan; when the fruit\r\nhas become sufficiently soft, run the contents of the pan through a\r\nflannel bag without pressure; tie the bag between two chairs, with a\r\nbasin below, and let the juice strain leisurely through so as to come\r\nout clear. Then to each pint of the juice add a pound of sugar, and\r\nboil this from ten to twenty minutes; pour off into warm dry jars,\r\nand cover them securely when cool. After the juice has dripped off\r\nthe fruit a pleasant refreshing drink may be made for children by\r\npouring a kettleful of boiling water through the flannel bag. Some\r\npersons mix with the fruit an equal quantity of green apples when\r\nmaking the jelly. Birds, especially field fares, eat the berries with\r\navidity; and a botanical designation of the tree is _aucuparia_, as\r\nsignifying fruit used by the _auceps_, or bird catcher, with which to\r\nbait his snares.\r\n\r\n\"There is,\" says an old writer, \"in every berry the exhilaration of\r\nwine, and the satisfying of old mead; and whosoever shall eat three\r\nberries of them, if he has [351] completed a hundred years, he will\r\nreturn to the age of thirty years.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be noted that the _leaves_ of the Mountain\r\nAsh are of a poisonous quality, and contain prussic acid like those\r\nof the laurel. But, as already shown, the berries, when ripe, may be\r\neaten freely without fear. Chemically they contain tartaric acid when\r\nunripe, and both malic and citric acids when ripe. They also furnish\r\nsorbin, and parasorbic acid. The unripe fruit and the bark are\r\nextremely astringent, being useful in decoction, or infusion, to\r\ncheck diarrhoea; and externally in poultices or lotions, to constringe\r\nsuch relaxed parts as the throat, and lower bowel.\r\n\r\nThe title Rowan tree has affixed itself to the Mountain Ash, as\r\nderived from the Norse, _Runa_ (a charm), because it is supposed to\r\nhave the power of averting the evil eye.\r\n\r\n    \"Rowan tree and red thread\r\n    Hold the witches a' in dread.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruma\" was really a magician, or whisperer, from _ru_, to murmur,\r\nand in olden times runes, or mystical secrets, were carved\r\nexclusively on the Mountain Ash tree in Scandinavia and the British\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nCrosses made of the twigs, and tied with red thread were sewn by\r\nHighlandmen into their clothes. Dame Sludge fastened a piece of\r\nthe wood into Flibbertigibbet's collar as a protection against\r\nWayland Smith's sorceries.--(Kenilworth). Other folk-names of the\r\ntree are Quicken tree, Quick Beam, Wiggen, and Witcher.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Ash is botanically a connecting link between the dog\r\nrose of our hedges and the apple tree of our orchards. Its flowers\r\nexactly resemble apple blossoms, and its thickly-clustered red\r\nberries are only small crabs dwarfed by the love of the tree for\r\nmountain [352] heights and bleak windy situations. In the harsh cold\r\nregions of the north it is only a stunted shrub with leaves split up\r\ninto many small leaflets, so as to suffer less by any breadth of\r\nresistance to the sharp driving blasts of icy winds.\r\n\r\nConfusion has been often made between this tree and the Service\r\ntree (_Sorbus_, or _Pyrus domestica_), which is quite distinct, being\r\nmore correctly called Servise tree, from _Cerevisia_, fermented\r\nbeer. Formerly this Servise, or Checker-tree, was employed for\r\nmaking an intoxicating drink. Virgil says:--\r\n\r\n        \"Et pocula lae\r\n    Fermento atque acidis imitantur vitea _sorbis_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With acid juices from the Service Ash,\r\n    And humming ale, they make their Lemon Squash.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Service tree (or Witten Pear-tree) resembles a small\r\npear, and is considered in France very useful for dysentery because\r\nof its tannin; but this _Pyrus domestica_ is a rare tree in England.\r\nSometimes mistaken for it is the wild Service tree (the _Pyrus\r\ntorminalis_), much more common in our south country hedges. Its\r\nfruit is threaded on long strings, and carried in procession at village\r\nfeasts in Northamptonshire, but is worthless. Evelyn says, \"Ale and\r\nbeer brewed from the berries, when ripe, of the true Service tree is\r\nan incomparable drink.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUGWORT and WORMWOOD.\r\n\r\nThe herb Mugwort (_Artemisia vulgaris_), a Composite plant, is\r\nfrequent about hedgerows and waste ground throughout Britain; and\r\nit chiefly merits a place among Herbal Simples because of a special\r\nmedicinal use in certain female derangements. Its name Mugwort\r\nhas [353] been attributed to \"moughte,\" a moth, or maggot, this title\r\nbeing given to the plant because Dioscorides commended it for\r\nkeeping off moths. Its Anglo-Saxon synonym is _Wyrmwyrt_.\r\nMugwort is named from Artemis the Greek goddess of the moon,\r\nand is also called Maidenwort or Motherwort (womb wort), being\r\na plant beneficial to the womb.\r\n\r\nMacer says, terming it by mistake \"Mother of Worts\":\r\n\r\n    \"Herbarum matrem justum puto ponere primo\r\n    Praepue morbis mulieribus illa medetur.\"\r\n\r\nA decoction of the fresh tops acts famously to correct female\r\nirregularities when employed as a bath. _Uterina est, adeoque usus\r\nest creberrimus mulierculis quoe eam adhibent externe, atque\r\ninterne ut vix balnea et lotiones parent in quibus artemisia non\r\ncontineatur_. Thus writes Ray, quoting from Schroder. Or it may be\r\nthat the term Mugwort became popularly applied because this herb\r\nwas in demand for helping to preserve ale. The plant was formerly\r\nknown as _Cingulum Sancti Johannis_, since a crown made from its\r\nsprays was worn on St. John's Eve, to gain security from evil\r\npossession; also as _Zona divi Johannis_, it being believed that John\r\nthe Baptist bore a girdle of it in the wilderness. In Germany and\r\nHolland it has received the name of St. John's Plant, because, if\r\ngathered on St. John's Eve, it is thought protective against diseases\r\nand misfortunes. The Mugwort is also styled \"Felon wort,\" or\r\n\"Felon herb.\" If placed in the shoes, it will prevent weariness. A\r\ndram of the powdered leaves taken four times a day has cured\r\nchronic hysterical fits, which were otherwise intractable.\r\n\"Mugwort,\" says Gerard, \"cureth the shakings of the joynts inclining\r\nto the palsie.\"\r\n\r\nThe mermaid of the Clyde is said to have exclaimed, [354] when\r\nshe beheld the funeral of a young maiden who had died from\r\nconsumption and decline:--\r\n\r\n    \"If they wad drink nettles in March,\r\n    And eat muggins [Mugwort] in May,\r\n    Sae mony braw young maidens\r\n    Wad na' be gang to clay.\"\r\n\r\nPortions of old dead roots are found at the base of the herb, which\r\ngo by the name of \"coals,\" and are thought to be preventive of\r\nepilepsy when taken internally, or worn around the neck as an\r\namulet. Parkinson says: \"Mugwort is of wonderful help to women in\r\nrisings of the mother, or hysteria.\" It is also useful against gout by\r\nboiling the tender parts of the roots in weak broth, and taking this\r\nfrequently; whilst at the same time the affected limbs should be\r\nbathed and fomented with a hot decoction of the herb. The plant,\r\nwithout doubt, is decidedly anti-epileptic, its remedial effects being\r\nstraightway followed by profuse and fetid perspirations. It is\r\nsimilarly useful against the convulsions of children in teething. For\r\npreventing disorders, as well as for curing rheumatism, the\r\nJapanese, young and old, rich and poor, indiscriminately, are said to\r\nbe singed with a \"moxa\" made from the Mugwort. Its dried leaves\r\nare rubbed in the hands until the downy part becomes separated, and\r\ncan be moulded into little cones. One of these having been placed\r\nover the site of the disease, is ignited and burnt down to the skin\r\nsurface, which it blackens and scorches in a dark circular patch.\r\nThis process is repeated until a small ulcer is formed when treating\r\nchronic diseases of the joints, which sore is kept open by issue peas\r\nretained within it so that they may constantly exercise a derivative\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of geese is declared to be more savoury when [355]\r\nstuffed with this herb, which contains \"absinthin\" as its active\r\nprinciple, and other chemical constituents in common with\r\nWormwood; but the odour of Mugwort is not fragrant or aromatic,\r\nbecause it does not possess a volatile essential oil like that of the\r\n_Artemisia absinthium_ (Wormwood).\r\n\r\nThis Wormwood is also a Composite plant of the same tribe and\r\ncharacter, but with an intensely bitter taste; and hence its name,\r\n_Absinthium_, has been derived from the Greek privative, _a_, and\r\n_psinthos_, \"delight,\" because the flavour is so bitterly distasteful.\r\nIt is a bushy plant, which abounds in our rural districts, having silky\r\nstems and leaves, with small heads of dull yellow flowers, the whole\r\nplant being _amara et aromatica_.\r\n\r\nThe Mugwort, as an allied Wormwood of the same genus, is taller\r\nand more slender than the Absinthium, and is distinguished by being\r\nscentless, its leaves being green above, and white below. The bitter\r\ntaste of the true Wormwood is also due to \"absinthin,\" and each\r\nkind contains nitrate of potash, tannin, and resin, with succinic,\r\nmalic, and acetic acids.\r\n\r\nOld Tusser says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where chamber is swept, and wormwood is strown,\r\n    No flea for his life dare abide to be known.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n    \"What savour is better, if physic be true,\r\n    For places infected, than wormwood and rue.\"\r\n\r\nThe infusion of Wormwood makes a useful fomentation for inflammatory\r\npains, and, combined with chamomile flowers and bay leaves,\r\nit formed the anodyne fomentation of the earlier dispensatories.\r\nThis infusion, with a few drops of the essential oil of Wormwood,\r\nwill serve [356] as an astringent wash to prevent the hair\r\nfrom falling off when it is weak and thin.\r\n\r\nBoth Mugwort and Wormwood have been highly esteemed for overcoming\r\nepilepsy in persons of a feeble constitution, and of a sensitive\r\nnervous temperament, especially in young females. Mugwort tea,\r\nand a decoction of Wormwood, may be confidently given for the\r\npurposes just named, also to correct female irregularities.\r\n\r\nFor promoting the monthly flow, Chinese women make a confection\r\nof the leaves of Mugwort mixed with rice and sugar, which, when\r\nneeded to overcome arrested monthly fluxes, or hysteria, they\r\n_instar bellaria ingerunt_, \"eat as a sweetmeat.\"\r\n\r\nA drachm of the powdered leaves of the Mugwort, taken four times\r\na day, has cured chronic hysterical fits otherwise irrepressible. The\r\ntrue Wormwood (_Artemisia absinthium_) is used for preparing\r\nabsinthe, a seductive liqueur, which, when taken to excess, induces\r\nepileptic attacks. Any habitual use of alcohol flavoured with this\r\nherb singularly impairs the mental and physical powers.\r\n\r\n\"An ointment,\" says Meyrick, \"made of the juice of Mugwort with\r\nhogs' lard, disperses hard knots and kernels about the neck and\r\nthroat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe Mulberry tree (_Morus nigra_) has been cultivated in England\r\nsince the middle of the sixteenth century, being first planted at Sion\r\nhouse in 1548. It is now grown commonly in the garden, orchard, or\r\npaddock, where its well-known rich syrupy fruit ripens in\r\nSeptember. This fruit, abounding with a luscious juice of regal hue,\r\nis used in some districts, particularly in Devonshire, for mixing with\r\ncider during [357] fermentation, giving to the beverage a pleasant\r\ntaste, and a deep red colour. The juice, made into syrup, is curative\r\nof sore throats, especially of the putrid sort, if it be used in\r\ngargles; also of thrush in the mouth, if applied thereto; and the\r\nripe fruit is gently laxative.\r\n\r\nHorace recommends that Mulberries be gathered before sunset:--\r\n\r\n    \"AEstatis peraget qui nigris prandia moris\r\n    Finiet ante gravem quae legerit arbore solem.\"\r\n\r\nThe generic name, _Morus_, is derived from the Celtic _mor_,\r\n\"black.\" In Germany (at Iserlohn), mothers, in order to deter their\r\nchildren from eating Mulberries, tell them the devil requires the\r\njuicy berries for the purpose of blacking his boots. This fruit was\r\nfabled to have become changed from white to a deep red through\r\nabsorbing the blood of Pyramus and Thisbe, who were slain beneath\r\nits shade.\r\n\r\nIt is thought by some that \"morus\" has been derived from the Latin\r\nword _mora_, delay, as shown in a tardy expansion of the buds.\r\nBecause cautious not to burst into leaf until the last frost of spring\r\nis over, the Mulberry tree, as the wisest of its fellows, was dedicated\r\nby the ancients to Minerva, and the story of Pyramus and Thisbe\r\nowed its origin to the white and black fruited varieties:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Mulberry found its former whiteness fled,\r\n    And, ripening, saddened into dusky red.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare's famous Mulberry tree, planted in 1609, was of the black\r\nspecies. It was recklessly cut down at New Place, Stratford-on-Avon,\r\nin 1759. Ten years afterwards, when the freedom of the city\r\nwas presented to Garrick, the document was enclosed in a\r\ncasket made from the wood of this tree. Likewise a cup was [358]\r\nwrought therefrom, and at the Shakespeare Jubilee, Garrick, holding\r\nthe cup aloft, recited the following lines, composed by himself for\r\nthe occasion:--\r\n\r\n    \"Behold this fair goblet: 'twas carved from the tree\r\n    Which, oh, my sweet Shakespeare, was planted by thee!\r\n    As a relic I kiss it, and bow at thy shrine,\r\n    What comes from thy hand must be ever divine.\"\r\n\r\n    \"All shall yield to the Mulberry tree;\r\n    Bend to the blest Mulberry:\r\n    Matchless was he who planted thee,\r\n    And thou, like him, immortal shall be.\"\r\n\r\nA slip of it was grown by Garrick in his garden at Hampton Court.\r\nThe leaves of the Mulberry tree are known to furnish excellent food\r\nfor silk worms.\r\n\r\nBotanically, each fruit is a collection of berries on a common pulpy\r\nreceptacle, being, like the Strawberry, especially wholesome for\r\nthose who are liable to heartburn, because it does not undergo\r\nacetous fermentation in the stomach. In France Mulberries are\r\nserved at the beginning of a meal. Among the Romans the fruit was\r\nfamous for maladies of the throat and windpipe.\r\n\r\nThe tree does not bear until it is somewhat advanced in age. It\r\ncontains in every part a milky juice, which will coagulate into a sort\r\nof Indian rubber, and this has been thought to give tenacity to the\r\nfilament spun by the silkworm.\r\n\r\nThe juice of Mulberries contains malic and citric acids, with\r\nglucose, pectin, and gum. The bark of the root has been given to\r\nexpel tapeworm; and the fruit is remarkable for its large quantity of\r\nsugar, being excelled in this respect only by the fig, the grape, and\r\nthe cherry.\r\n\r\nWe are told in _Ivanhoe_ that the Saxons made a favourite drink,\r\n\"Morat,\" from the juice of Mulberries [359] with honey. During the\r\nthirteenth century these berries were sometimes called \"pynes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the memorable narrative of the Old Testament, 2 _Samuel_, v.,\r\n24, \"When thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the\r\nMulberry trees,\" the word used (_bekhaim_) has been mistranslated,\r\nreally intending the Aspen (_Populus tremula_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLEIN.\r\n\r\nThe great Mullein (_Verbascum thapsus_) grows freely in England\r\non dry banks and waste places, but somewhat sparingly in Scotland.\r\nIt belongs to the scrofula-curing order of plants, having a thick\r\nstalk, from eighteen inches to four feet high, with large woolly\r\nmucilaginous leaves, and with a long flower-spike bearing plain\r\nyellow flowers, which are nearly sessile on the stem. The name\r\n\"Molayne\" is derived from the Latin, _mollis_, soft.\r\n\r\nIn most parts of Ireland, besides growing wild, it is carefully\r\ncultivated in gardens, because of a steady demand for the plant by\r\nsufferers from pulmonary consumption. Constantly in Irish\r\nnewspapers there are advertisements offering it for sale, and it can\r\nbe had from all the leading local druggists. The leaves are best when\r\ngathered in the late summer, just before the plant flowers. The old\r\nIrish method of administering Mullein is to put an ounce of the\r\ndried leaves, or a corresponding quantity of the fresh ones, in a pint\r\nof milk, which is boiled for ten minutes, and then strained. This is\r\nafterwards given warm to the patient twice a day, with or without\r\nsugar. The taste of the decoction is bland, mucilaginous, and\r\ncordial. Dr. Quinlan, of Dublin, treated many cases of tubercular\r\nlung disease, even when some were far advanced in pulmonary\r\nconsumption, with the Mullein, [360] and with signal success as\r\nregards palliating the cough, staying the expectoration, and\r\nincreasing the weight.\r\n\r\nMullein leaves have a weak, sleepy sort of smell, and rather a bitter\r\ntaste. In Queen Elizabeth's time they were carried about the person\r\nto prevent the falling sickness; and distilled water from the flowers\r\nwas said to be curative of gout.\r\n\r\nThe leaves and flowers contain mucilage, with a yellowish volatile\r\noil, a fatty substance, and sugar, together with some colouring\r\nmatter. Fish will become stupefied by eating the seeds. Gerard says\r\n\"Figs do not putrifie at all that are wrapped in the leaves of Mullein.\r\nIf worn under the feet day and night in the manner of a sock they\r\nbring down in young maidens their desired sicknesse.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant bears also the name of Hedge Taper, and used to be called\r\nTorch, because the stalks were dipped in suet, and burnt for giving\r\nlight at funerals and other gatherings. \"It is a plant,\" says the\r\n_Grete Herball_, \"whereof is made a manner of lynke if it be tallowed.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Dodoeus the Mullein was called \"Candela.\" _Folia\r\nsiquidem habet mollia hirsuta ad lucernarum funiculos apta_. \"It\r\nwas named of the Latines, _Candela Regia_ and _Candelaria_.\" The\r\nmodern Romans style it the \"Plant of the Lord,\" Other popular\r\nEnglish names of the plant are \"Adam's flannel,\" \"Blanket,\"\r\n\"Shepherd's club,\" \"Aaron's rod,\" \"Cuddie's lungs\"; and in\r\nAnglo-Saxon, \"Feldwode.\" Gower says of Medea:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tho' toke she feldwode, and verveine,\r\n    Of herbes ben nought better tweine.\"\r\n\r\nThe name _Verbascum_ is an altered form of the Latin _barbascum_,\r\nfrom _barba_, \"a beard,\" in allusion to the dense woolly\r\nhairs on both sides of the leaves; and the [361] appellation,\r\nMullein, is got from the French _molene_, signifying the \"scab\" in\r\ncattle, and for curing which disease the plant is famous. It has also\r\nbeen termed Cow's Lung Wort, Hare's Beard, Jupiter's Staff, Ladies'\r\nFoxglove, and Velvet Dock from its large soft leaves. The Mullein\r\nbears the title \"Bullock's lung wort,\" because of its supposed\r\ncurative powers in lung diseases of this animal, on the doctrine of\r\nsignatures, because its leaf resembles a dewlap; and the term\r\n\"Malandre\" was formerly applied to the lung maladies of cattle.\r\nAlso the \"Malanders\" meant leprosy, whence it came about that the\r\nepithet \"Malandrin\" was attached to a brigand, who, like the leper,\r\nwas driven from society and forced to lead a lawless life.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the flowers was used by the Roman ladies to tinge\r\ntheir tresses of the golden colour once so much admired in Italy; and\r\nnow in Germany, a hair wash made from the Mullein is valued as\r\nhighly restorative. A decoction of the root is good for cramps and\r\nagainst the megrims of bilious subjects, which especially beset them\r\nin the dark winter months. The dried leaves of the Mullein plant, if\r\nsmoked in an ordinary tobacco pipe, will completely control the\r\nhacking cough of consumption; and they can be employed with\r\nequal benefit, when made into cigarettes, for asthma, and for\r\nspasmodic coughs in general.\r\n\r\nBy our leading English druggists are now dispensed a _succus\r\nverbasci_ (Mullein juice), of which the dose is from half to one\r\nteaspoonful; a tincture of _Verbascum_ (Mullein), the dose of\r\nwhich is from half-a-teaspoonful to two teaspoonfuls; and an\r\ninfusion of Mullein, in doses of from one to four tablespoonfuls.\r\nAlso a tincture (H.) is made from the fresh herb with spirit of wine,\r\nwhich has been proved beneficial for migraine (sick head-ache) of\r\nlong [362] standing, with oppression of the ears. From eight to ten\r\ndrops of this tincture are to be given as a dose, with cold water, and\r\nrepeated pretty frequently whilst needed.\r\n\r\nMullein oil is a most valuable destroyer of disease germs. If fresh\r\nflowers of the plant be steeped for twenty-one days in olive oil\r\nwhilst exposed to the sunlight, this makes an admirable bactericide;\r\nalso by simply instilling a few drops two or three times a day into\r\nthe ear, all pain therein, or discharges therefrom, and consequent\r\ndeafness, will be effectually cured, as well as any itching eczema of\r\nthe external ear and its canal. A conserve of the flowers is employed\r\non the Continent against ringworm. Some of the most brilliant\r\nresults have been obtained in suppurative inflammation of the inner\r\near by a single application of Mullein oil. In acute or chronic cases\r\nof this otorrhoea, two or three drops of the oil should be made fall\r\ninto the ear twice or thrice in the day. And the same oil is an\r\nadmirable remedy for children who \"wet the bed\" at night. Five\r\ndrops should be put into a small tumblerful of cold water; and a\r\nteaspoonful of the mixture, first stirred, should be taken four times\r\nin the day.\r\n\r\nFlowers of Mullein in olive oil, when kept near the fire for several\r\ndays in a corked bottle, form a remedy popular in Germany for\r\nfrost-bites, bruises, and piles. Also a poultice made with the leaves\r\nis a good application to these last named troublesome evils. For the\r\ncure of piles, sit for five minutes on a chamber vessel containing\r\nlive coals, with crisp dry Mullein leaves over them, and some finely\r\npowdered resin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nWithout giving descriptive attention to those Mushrooms (_Agarics_,\r\n_Boleti_, and others) which are edible, and [363] of which\r\nover a hundred may be enumerated, as beyond our purpose when\r\ntreating of curative Herbal Simples, notice will be bestowed\r\nhere on two productions of the Mushroom nature--the Puff Ball and\r\nthe Fly Agaric,--because of their medicinal qualities.\r\n\r\nIt may be first briefly stated that the _Agaricus campestris_, or field\r\nMushroom, is the kind most commonly eaten in England, being\r\nhighly nitrogenous, and containing much fat. This may be readily\r\ndistinguished from any harmful fungus by the pink colour of its\r\ngills, the solidity of its stem, the fragrant anise-like odour which it\r\npossesses, and the separability of its outer skin. Other edible\r\nMushrooms which grow with us, and are even of a better quality\r\nthan the above, are the _Agaricus augustus_ and the _Agaricus\r\nelvensis_, not to mention the _Chanatrelle_, said to be unapproachable\r\nfor excellence.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were aware of edible fungi, and knew of injurious sorts\r\nwhich produced a sense of choking, whilst subsequent wasting of\r\nthe body occurred. Athenaeus quotes an author who said: \"You will\r\nbe choked like those who waste after eating mushrooms.\" The\r\nRomans also esteemed some fungi as of so exquisite a flavour that\r\nthese would be stolen sooner than silver or gold by anyone entrusted\r\nwith their delivery:--\r\n\r\n    \"Argentum, atque aurum facile est laenamque togamque.\r\n    Mittere, boletos mittere difficile est.\"\r\n\r\nMushrooms were styled by Porphry _deorum filii_, and \"without\r\nseed, as produced by the midwifery of autumnal thunderstorms, and\r\nportending the mischief which these cause.\" \"They are generally\r\nreported to have something noxious in them, and not without\r\nreason; but they were exalted to the second course of the Caesarean\r\ntables with the noble title 'bromatheon,' [364] a dainty fit for the\r\ngods, to whom they sent the Emperor Claudius, as they have many\r\nsince to the other world.\" \"So true it is he who eats Mushrooms\r\nmany times, _nil amplius edit_, eats no more of anything.\"\r\n\r\nThe poisonous kinds may be commonly recognised by their possessing\r\npermanently white gills which do not touch the stem; and\r\na thin ring, or frill, is borne by the stem at some distance from\r\nthe top, whilst the bottom of the stem is surrounded by a loose\r\nsheath, or volva. If \"phalline\" is the active poisonous principle, this\r\nis not rendered inert by heat in cooking; but the helvellic acid of\r\nother sorts disappears during the process, and its fungi are thus\r\nmade non-poisonous. There is a popular belief that Mushrooms\r\nwhich grow near iron, copper, or other metals, are deadly; the same\r\nidea obtaining in the custom of putting a coin in the water used for\r\nboiling Mushrooms in order that it may attract and detach any\r\npoison, and so serve to make them wholesome.\r\n\r\nIn Essex there is an old saying:--\r\n\r\n    \"When the moon is at the full,\r\n    Mushrooms you may freely pull;\r\n    But when the moon is on the wane,\r\n    Wait till you think to pluck again.\"\r\n\r\nEven the most poisonous species may be eaten with impunity after\r\nrepeated maceration in salt and water, or vinegar and water--which\r\ncustom is generally adopted in the South of Europe, where the diet\r\nof the poorer classes largely includes the fungi which they gather;\r\nbut when so treated the several Mushrooms lose much of their soluble\r\nnutritive qualities as well as their flavour. For the most part,\r\n_Agarics_ with salmon-coloured spores are injurious, likewise fungi\r\nhaving a rancid or fetid odour, and an acrid, pungent, peppery taste.\r\nCelsus said: \"If anyone shall have eaten [365] noxious fungi, let him\r\ntake radishes with vinegar and water, or with salt and vinegar.\"\r\n\r\nWholesome Mushrooms afford nourishment which is a capital\r\nsubstitute for butchers' meat, and almost equally sustaining. If a\r\npoisonous fungus has been eaten, its ill-effects may nowadays be\r\npromptly met by antidotes injected beneath the skin, and by taking\r\nsmall doses of strychnia in coffee.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"I give my advice to those that love such strange and\r\nnew fangled meats to beware of licking honey among thorns, lest\r\nthe sweetness of the one do not countervail the sharpness and\r\npricking of the other.\" With regard to Mushrooms generally, Horace\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n    \"Pratensibus optima fungis\r\n    Natura est; aliis male creditur.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The meadow Mushrooms are in kind the best;\r\n    'Tis ill to trust in any of the rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe St. George's Mushroom, an early one, takes, perhaps, the\r\nhighest place as an agaric for the table. Blewits (formerly sold in\r\nCovent Garden market for Catsup), and Blue Caps, each all\r\nautumnal species, are savoury fungi to be fried. They may be served\r\nwith bacon on toast.\r\n\r\nA very old test as to the safety of Mushrooms is to stew with them\r\nin the saucepan a small carefully-peeled onion. If after boiling for a\r\nfew minutes this comes out White, and clean-looking, the\r\nMushrooms may all be confidently eaten: but if it has turned blue,\r\nor black, there are dangerous ones among them, and all should be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nThe Puff Ball (_Lycoperdon giganteum bovista_) grows usually on\r\nthe borders of fields, in orchards, or meadows, also on dry downs,\r\nand occasionally in gardens. It [366] should be collected as a Simple\r\nin August and September. This Puff Ball is smooth, globose, and\r\nyellowish-white when young, becoming afterwards brown. It\r\ncontains, when ripe, a large quantity of extremely fine brown black\r\npowder, which is a capital application for stopping bleeding from\r\nslight wounds and cuts. This also makes a good drying powder for\r\ndusting on weeping eruptive sores between parts which approximate\r\nto one another, as the fingers, toes, and armpits. The powder is very\r\ninflammable, and when propelled in a hollow cone against lighted\r\nspirit of wine on tow at the other end by a sudden jerk, its flash\r\nserves to imitate lightning for stage purposes. It was formerly used\r\nas tinder for lighting fires with the flint and steel.\r\n\r\nWhen the fungus is burnt, its fumes exercise a narcotic property,\r\nand will stupify bees, so that their honey may be removed. It has\r\nbeen suggested that these fumes may take the place of chloroform\r\nfor minor surgical operations. The gas given off during combustion\r\nis carbonic oxide.\r\n\r\nPuff Balls vary in size from that of a moderately large turnip to the\r\nbigness of a man's head. Their form is oval, depressed a little at the\r\ntop, and the colour is a pure white both without and within. The\r\nsurface is smooth at first, but at length cracking, and as the fungus\r\nripens it becomes discoloured and dry; then the interior is resolved\r\ninto a yellow mass of delicate threads, mixed with a powder of\r\nminute spores, about the month of September.\r\n\r\nWhen young and pulpy the Puff Ball is excellent to be eaten, and is\r\nespecially esteemed in Italy; but it deteriorates very rapidly after\r\nbeing gathered, and should not be used at table if it has become\r\nstained with yellow marks. When purely white it may be cut into\r\nthick [367] slices of a quarter-of-an-inch, and fried in fresh butter,\r\nwith pepper, salt; and pounded herbs, and each slice should be first\r\ndipped in the yolk of an egg; the Puff Ball will also make an\r\nexcellent omelette. Small Puff Balls are common on lawns, heaths,\r\nand pastures. These are harmless, and eatable as long as their flesh\r\nremains quite white. The Society of Amateur Botanists, 1863, had\r\nits origin (as described by the president, Mr. M. C. Cooke), \"over a\r\ncup of tea and fried Puff Balls,\" in Great Turnstile.\r\n\r\nPieces of its dried inner woolly substance, with a profusion of\r\nminute snuff-coloured spores, have been long kept by the wise old\r\nwomen of villages for use to staunch wounds and incisions; whilst a\r\nready surgical appliance to a deep cut is to bind a piece of Puff Ball\r\nover it, and leave it until healing has taken place. In Norfolk large\r\nPuff Balls found at the margins of cornfields are known as Bulfers,\r\nor Bulfists, and are regarded with aversion.\r\n\r\nIn medicine a trituration (H.) is made of this fungus, and its spores,\r\nrubbed up with inert sugar of milk powdered, and it proves an\r\neffective remedy against dull, stupid, sleepy headache, with passive\r\nitchy pimples about the skin. From five to ten grains of the\r\ntrituration, diluted to the third decimal strength, should be given\r\ntwice a day, with a little water, for two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nSir B. Richardson found that even by smelling at a strong tincture of\r\nthe fungus great heaviness of the head was produced; and he has\r\nsuccessfully employed the same tincture for relieving an analogous\r\ncondition when coming on of its own accord. But the Puff Ball,\r\nwhether in tincture (H.) or in trituration, is chiefly of service for\r\ncuring the itchy pimply skin of \"tettery\" subjects, especially if this\r\nis aggravated by washing. Likewise the remedy is of essential use in\r\nsome forms [368] of eczema, especially in what is known as bakers',\r\nor grocers' itch. Five drops of the diluted tincture may be given with\r\na spoonful of water three times in the day; and the affected parts\r\nshould be sponged equally often with a lotion made of one part of\r\nthe stronger tincture to four parts of water, or thin strained gruel.\r\nSometimes when a full meal of the Puff Ball fried in butter, or\r\nstewed in milk, has been taken, undoubted evidences of its narcotic\r\neffects have shown themselves.\r\n\r\nGerard said: \"In divers parts of England, where people dwell far\r\nfrom neighbours, they carry the Puff Balls kindled with fire, which\r\nlasteth long.\" In Latin they were named _Lupi crepitum_, or Wolfs'\r\nFists. \"The powder of them is fitly applied to merigals, kibed heels,\r\nand such like; the dust or powder thereof is very dangerous for the\r\neyes, for it bath been observed that divers have been poreblind even\r\nafter when some small quantity thereof hath been blown into their\r\neyes.\" This fungus has been called Molly Puff, from its resemblance\r\nto a powder puff; also Devil's Snuff Box, Fuss Balls, and Puck Fists\r\n(from _feist, crepitus ani_, and _Puck_, the impish king of the\r\nfairies). In Scotland the Puff Ball is the blind man's e'en, because\r\nit has been believed that its dust will cause blindness; and in\r\nWales it is the \"bag of smoke.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fly Agaric, or Bug Agaric (_Agaricus muscarius_) gives the\r\nname of Mushroom to all the tribe of Fungi as used for the\r\ndestruction of flies (_mousches_). Albertus Magnus describes it as\r\n_Vocatus fungus muscarum eo quidem lacte pulverisatus interficit\r\nmuscas_: and this seems to be the real source of the word, which\r\nhas by caprice become transmitted from a poisonous sort to the\r\nwholesome kinds exclusively. The pileus of the Fly Agaric is broad,\r\nconvex, and of a rich orange scarlet [369] colour, with a striate\r\nmargin and white gills. It gets its name, as also that of Flybane,\r\nfrom being used in milk to kill flies; and it is called Bug Agaric\r\nfrom having been formerly employed to smear over bedsteads so as\r\nto destroy bugs. It inhabits dry places, especially birchwoods, and\r\npinewoods, having a bright red upper surface studded with brown\r\nwarts; and when taken as a poisonous agent it causes intoxication,\r\ndelirium, and death through narcotism. It is more common in\r\nScotland than in England. This Mushroom is highly poisonous, and\r\ntherefore the remedial preparations are only to be given in a diluted\r\nform. For medicinal purposes a tincture is made (H.) from the fresh\r\nfungus: and a trituration of the dried fungus powdered and mixed\r\nwith inert sugar of milk also powdered. These preparations are kept\r\nspecially by the homoeopathic chemists: and the use of the Fly\r\nAgaric has been adopted by the school which they represent for\r\ncuratively treating an irritable spinal cord, with soreness, twitching\r\nof the limbs, dragging of the legs, unsteadiness of the head,\r\nneuralgic pains in the arms and legs (as if caused by sharp ice),\r\nsome giddiness, a coating of yellow fur on the lining mucous\r\nmembranes, together with a crawling, or burning, and eruptive skin.\r\nIn fact for a lamentably depraved condition of all the bodily health,\r\nsuch as characterises advanced locomotor ataxy, and allied spinal\r\ndegradations leading to general physical failure. Just such a totality\r\nof symptoms has been recorded by provers after taking the fungus\r\nfor some length of time in toxical quantities. The tincture should be\r\nused of the third decimal strength, five drops for a dose twice or\r\nthree times a day with a spoonful of water; or the trituration of the\r\nthird decimal strength, for each dose as much of the powder as will\r\nlie on the flat surface of [370] a sixpence. Chilblains may be\r\nmitigated by taking the tincture of this Agaric, and by applying\r\nsome of the stronger tincture on cotton wool over the swollen and\r\nitching parts alt night.\r\n\r\n\"Muscarin\" is the leading active principle of the Fly Agaric, in\r\nconjunction with agaricin, mycose, and mannite. It stimulates, when\r\nswallowed in strong doses, certain nerves which tend to retard the\r\naction of the heart. Both our Fly Agaric and the White Agaric of the\r\nUnited States serve to relieve the night sweats of advanced\r\npulmonary consumption, and they have severally proved of supreme\r\npalliative use against the cough, the sleeplessness, and the other\r\nworst symptoms of this, wasting disease, as also for drying up the\r\nmilk in weaning. Each of these fungi when taken by mistake will\r\nsalivate profusely, and provoke both immoderate, and untimely\r\nlaughter. When the action of the heart is laboured and feeble\r\nthrough lack of nervous power, muscarin, or the tincture of Fly\r\nAgaric, in a much diluted potency will relieve this trouble. The dose\r\nof Muscarin, or Agaricin, is from a sixth to half a grain in a pill.\r\nThese medicines increase the secretion of tears, saliva, bile, and\r\nsweating, but they materially lessen the quantity of urine.\r\nBelladonna is found to be the best antidote. From the Oak Agaric,\r\n\"touchwood,\" or \"spunk,\"--when cut into thin slices and beaten with\r\na hammer until soft,--is made \"Amadou,\" or German tinder. This is\r\nthen soaked in a solution of nitre and dried; it afterwards forms an\r\nexcellent elastic astringent application for staying bleedings and for\r\nbed sores. The Larch Agaric is powdered, and given in Germany as\r\na purgative, its dose being from twenty to sixty grains.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium the _Polyporus Officinalis_ is used medicinally [371] as\r\nan aperient, and to check profuse sweating. By the Malays the\r\n_Polyporus Sanguineus_ is used outwardly for leprosy.\r\n\r\nTruffles (_Tuber cibarium_) may receive a passing notice whilst\r\ntreating of fungi, though they are really subterranean tubers of an\r\nedible sort found in the earth, especially beneath beech trees, and\r\nuprooted by dogs trained for the purpose. They somewhat resemble\r\nour English \"earth nuts,\" which swine discover by their scent. The\r\nancients called the Truffle _lycoperdon_, because supposing it to\r\nspring from the dung of wolves. In Athens the children of Cherips\r\nhad the rights of citizenship granted them because their father had\r\ninvented a choice ragout concocted of Truffles. But delicate and\r\nweak stomachs find them difficult to digest. Pliny said, \"Those\r\nkinds which remain hard after cooking are injurious; whilst others,\r\nnaturally harmful if they admit of being cooked thoroughly well,\r\nand if eaten with saltpetre, or, still better, dressed with meat, or\r\nwith pear stalks, are safe and innocent.\"\r\n\r\nIn Italy these tubers are fried in oil and dusted with pepper. For\r\nepicures they are mixed with the liver of fattened geese in _pate de\r\nfoie gras_. Also, greedy swine are taught to discover and root them\r\nout, \"being of a chestnut colour and heavy rank hercline smell, and\r\nfound not seldom in England.\" Black Truffles are chiefly used: but\r\nthere are also red and white varieties, the best tubers being light of\r\nweight in proportion to their size, with an agreeable odour, and\r\nelastic to the touch.\r\n\r\nThey are stimulating and heating, insomuch, that for delicate\r\nchildren who are atrophied, and require a _multum in parvo_ of\r\nfatty and nitrogenous food in a compact but light form, which is\r\nfairly easy of digestion, [372] the _pate de foie gras_ on bread is a\r\ncapital prescription. Truffles grow in clusters several inches below\r\nthe soil, being found commonly on the downs of Wiltshire,\r\nHampshire and Kent; also in oak and chestnut forests. Dogs have\r\nbeen trained to discriminate their scent below the surface of the soil,\r\nand to assist in digging them out. There is a Garlic Truffle of a small\r\ninferior sort which is put into stews; and the best Truffles are\r\nfrequently found full of perforations. The presence of the tubers\r\nbeneath the ground is denoted by the appearance above of a\r\nbeautiful little fly having a violet colour--this insect being never\r\nseen except in the neighbourhood of Truffles. They are subject to\r\nthe depredations of certain animalcules, which excavate the tubers\r\nso that they soon become riddled with worms. These, after passing\r\nthrough a chrysalis state, develop into the violet flies. Gerard called\r\nTruffles \"Spanish fussebals.\" They were not known to English\r\nepicures in Queen Elizabeth's day. Another appellation borne by\r\nthem formerly was \"Swines' bread,\" and they were supposed to be\r\nengendered by thunderbolts. In Northern France they were first\r\npopularised four hundred and fifty years ago, by John, Duke of\r\nBerry, a reprobate gambler, third son of John the Good. The\r\nPerigord Truffle has a dark skin, and smells of violets. Piedmontese\r\ntruffles suggest garlic: those of Burgundy are a little resinous: the\r\nNeapolitan specimens are redolent of sulphur: and in the Gard\r\nDepartment (France) they have an odour of musk. The English\r\ntruffle is white, and best used in salads. Dr. Warton, Poet Laureate,\r\n1750, said \"Happy the grotto'ed hermit with his pulse, who wants no\r\ntruffles.\" A Girton girl under examination described the tuber as a\r\n\"sort of sea-anemone on land.\" When once dug up truffles soon\r\n[373] lose their perfume and aroma, so they are imported bedded in\r\nthe very earth which produced them.\r\n\r\nThe Earth Nut (_Bunium flexuosum_) is also catted Hog Nut, Pig\r\nNut, Jur Nut, St. Anthony's Nut, Earth Chesnut, and Kipper Nut.\r\nCaliban says, in the Tempest, \"I with my long nails-will dig thee Pig\r\nNuts.\" They are an excellent diuretic, serving to stimulate the\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\nPliny talked of fungi in general as a great delicacy to be eaten with\r\namber knives and a service of silver. But Seneca called them\r\n_voluptuaria venena_. The Russians take some which we think to be\r\ndeleterious; but they first soak these in vinegar, which (adds Pliny),\r\n\"being contrary to them neutralizes their dangerous qualities; also\r\nthey are rendered still more safe if cooked with pear stalks; indeed it\r\nis good to eat pears immediately after all fungi.\" Almost every\r\nspecies except the common Mushroom is characterized by the\r\nmajority of our countrymen as a toadstool; but this title really\r\nappertains to the large group bearing the subgeneric name of\r\n_Tricholoma_, which probably does not contain a single unwholesome\r\nspecies. Other rustic names given to this group are \"Puckstools\"\r\nand \"Puckfists.\" They are further known as \"Toad skeps\" (toad's cap)\r\nin the Eastern counties.\r\n\r\nPuck, the mischievous king of the fairies, has been commonly\r\nidentified with _pogge_, the toad, which was believed to sit upon most\r\nof the unwholesome fungi; and the _Champignon_ (or Paddock Stool)\r\nwas said to owe its growth to \"those wanton elves whose pastime is\r\nto make midnight mushrooms.\" One of the \"toad stoo's\" (the\r\n_Clathrus cancellatus_) is said to produce cancerous sores if\r\nhandled too freely. It has an abominably disgusting odour, and is\r\ntherefore named the \"lattice stinkhorn.\" The toad was popularly\r\nthought to [374] impersonate the devil; and the toad-stool, pixie\r\nstool, or paddock stool was believed to spring from the devil's\r\ndroppings.\r\n\r\nThe word Mushroom may have been derived from the French _Moucheron_,\r\nor _Mousseron_, because of its growing among moss. The chief\r\nchemical constituents of wholesome Mushrooms are albuminoids,\r\ncarbo-hydrates, fat, mineral matters, and water. When salted\r\nthey yield what is known as catsup, or ketchup (from the\r\nJapanese _kitchap_). The second most edible fungus of this\r\nnature is the Parasol Mushroom (_Lepcota procera_).\r\n\r\nEdible Mushrooms, if kept uncooked, become dangerous: they cannot\r\nbe sent to table too soon. In Rome our favourite _Pratiola_ is\r\nheld in very small esteem, and the worst wish an Italian can express\r\nagainst his foe is \"that he may die of a _Pratiola_.\" If this species\r\nwere exposed for sale in the Roman markets it would be certainly\r\ncondemned by the inspector of fungi.\r\n\r\nFairy rings are produced by the spawn, or mycelium, beginning to\r\ngerminate where dropped by a bird or a beast, and exhausting the\r\nsoil of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potash, from the centre\r\ncontinuously outwards; whilst immediately within the enlarging ring\r\nthere is constantly a band of coarse rank grass fed by the manure of\r\nthe penultimate dead spawn. The innermost starved ground remains\r\npoor and barren. In this duplicate way the rings grow larger and\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nOur edible Mushroom is a _Pratella_ of the subgenus _Psalliota_,\r\nand the _Agaricus campestris_ of English botanists. In common\r\nwith the esculent Mushrooms of France it contains phosphate of\r\npotassium--a cell salt essentially reparative of exhausted nerve\r\ntissue and energy.\r\n\r\nThe old practice of testing Mushrooms with a silver [375] spoon,\r\nwhich is supposed to become tarnished only when the juices are of\r\nan injurious quality (i.e., when sulphur is developed therein under\r\ndecomposition) is not to be trusted. In cases of poisoning by\r\ninjurious fungi after the most violent symptoms may have been\r\nrelieved, and the patient rescued from immediate danger, yet great\r\nemaciation will often follow from the subsequent effects of the\r\npoison: and the skin may exhibit an abundant outbreak of a\r\nvesicular eruption, whilst the health will remain perhaps\r\npermanently injured. Strong alcoholic drinks should never be taken\r\ntogether with, or immediately after eating Mushrooms, or other\r\ninnocent fungi. Experienced fungus eaters (mycophagists) have\r\nfound themselves suffering from severe pains, and some swellings\r\nthrough taking whiskey and water shortly after the meal: whereas\r\nprecisely the same fungus, minus the whiskey, could be eaten with\r\nimpunity by these identical experimentalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD.\r\n\r\nThe wild Mustard (_Brassica Sinapistrum_), a Cruciferous herb\r\ncommonly called Chedlock, from _leac_, a weed, and _kiede_, to\r\nannoy, grows abundantly as a product of waste places, and in newly\r\ndisturbed ground.\r\n\r\nThe Field Mustard (_Arvensis_) is Charlock, or Brassock; its\r\nbotanical term, _Sinapis_, being referable to the Celtic _nap_, as a\r\ngeneral name for plants of the rape kind. Mustard was formerly\r\nknown as \"senvie\" in English. It has been long cultivated and\r\nimproved, especially in Darham.\r\n\r\nNow we have for commercial and officinal purposes two varieties of\r\nthe cultivated plant, the black Mustard (_Sinapis nigra_), and the\r\nwhite Mustard (_Brassica_, or _Sinapis alba_). There is also a plain\r\nplant of the hedges, [376] Hedge Mustard (_Sisymbrium officinale_)\r\nwhich is a mere rustic Simple. It is the black Mustard which\r\nyields by its seeds the condiment of our tables, and the\r\npungent yellow flour which we employ for the familiar stimulating\r\npoultice, or sinapism. This black Mustard is a tall smooth plant,\r\nhaving entire leaves, and smooth seed pods, being now grown for\r\nthe market on rich alluvial soil chiefly in Lincolnshire and\r\nYorkshire. In common with its kindred plants it gets its name from\r\n_mustum_, the \"must,\" or newly fermented grape juice, and\r\n_ardens_, burning, because as a condiment, Mustard flour was\r\nformerly mixed with home-made wine and sugar. The virtues of\r\nblack Mustard depend on the acrid volatile oil contained in its seeds.\r\nThese when unbruised and macerated in boiling water yield only a\r\ntasteless mucilage which resides in their skin. But when bruised\r\nthey develop a very active, pungent, and highly stimulative principle\r\nwith a powerful penetrating odour which makes the eyes water.\r\nFrom thence is perhaps derived the generic name of the herb\r\n_Sinapis_ (_Para tou sinesthai tous hopous_, \"because it irritates the\r\neyes\"). This active principle contains sulphur abundantly, as is\r\nproved by the discoloration of a silver spoon when left in the\r\nmustard-pot, the black sulphuret of silver being formed. The\r\nchemical basis of black Mustard is \"sinnigrin\" and its acid myronic.\r\nThe acridity of its oil is modified in the seeds by combination with\r\nanother fixed oil of a bland nature which can be readily separated by\r\npressure, then the cake left after the expression of this fixed oil is\r\nfar more pungent than the seeds. The bland oil expressed from the hulls\r\nof the black seeds after the flour has been sifted away, promotes the\r\ngrowth of the hair, and may be used with benefit externally for\r\n[377] rheumatism. Whitehead's noted Essence of Mustard is made\r\nwith spirits of turpentine and rosemary, with which camphor and the\r\nfarina of black Mustard seed are mixed. This oil is very little\r\naffected by frost or the atmosphere; and it is therefore specially\r\nprized by clock makers, and for instruments of precision.\r\n\r\nA Mustard poultice from the farina of black Mustard made into a\r\npaste with, or without wheaten flour commingled, constitutes one of\r\nthe most powerful external stimulating applications we can employ.\r\nIt quickly induces a sharp burning pain, and it excites a destructive\r\noutward inflammation which enters much more into the true skin\r\nthan that which is caused by an old fashioned blister of Spanish fly.\r\nThis has therefore superseded the latter as more promptly and\r\nreliably effective for the speedy relief of all active internal\r\ncongestions. If the application of Mustard has caused sores, these\r\nmay be best soothed and healed by lime-water liniment.\r\n\r\nMustard flour is an infallible antiseptic and sterilising agent. It is\r\na capital deodoriser; and if rubbed thoroughly into the bands and nails\r\nwill take away all offensive stink when corrupt or dead tissues have\r\nbeen manipulated.\r\n\r\nIf a tablespoonful of Mustard flour is added to a pint of tepid water,\r\nand taken at a draught it operates briskly as a stimulating and sure\r\nemetic. Hot water poured on bruised seeds of black Mustard makes\r\na good stimulating footbath for helping to throw off a cold, or to\r\ndispel a headache; and meantime the volatile oil given out as an\r\naroma, if not too strong, proves soporific. This oil contains erucic,\r\nand sinapoleic acids. When properly mixed with spirit of wine,\r\ntwenty-four drops of the oil to an ounce of spirit, the essential oil\r\nforms, [378] by reason of its stimulating properties and its contained\r\nsulphur, a capital liniment for use in rheumatism, or for determining\r\nblood to the surface from deeper parts. Caution should be used not\r\nto apply a plaster made altogether of Mustard flour to the delicate\r\nskin of young children, or females, because ulcers difficult to heal\r\nmay be the result, or even gangrenous destruction of the deeper skin\r\nmay follow. The effects of a Mustard bath, at about ninety degrees,\r\nare singular; decided chills are felt at first throughout the whole\r\nbody, with some twitchings at times of the limbs; and later on, even\r\nafter the skin surface has become generally red, this sense of\r\ncoldness persists, until the person leaves the water, when reaction\r\nbecomes quickly established, with a glowing heat and redness of the\r\nwhole skin.\r\n\r\nFor obstinate hiccough a teacupful of boiling water should be\r\npoured on a teaspoonful of Mustard flour, and taken when sufficiently\r\ncool, half at first, and the other half in ten minutes if still\r\nneeded. For congestive headache a small roll of Mustard paper or\r\nMustard leaf may be introduced into one or both nostrils, and left\r\nthere for a minute or more. It will relieve the headache promptly,\r\nand may perhaps induce some nose bleeding.\r\n\r\nAdmixture with vinegar checks the development of the pungent\r\nprinciples of Mustard. This used to be practised for the table in\r\nEngland, but is now discontinued, though some housewives add a\r\nlittle salt to their made Mustard.\r\n\r\nClaims for the introduction of Mustard at Durham in 1720, have\r\nbeen raised in favour of a Mrs. Clements, but they cannot be\r\nsubstantiated. Shakespeare in the _Taming of the Shrew_ makes\r\nGrumio ask Katherine \"What say you to a piece of beef and\r\nMustard?\" and speaks, in _Henry IV_., of Poins' wit being \"as thick\r\n[379] as Tewkesbury Mustard\"; whilst Fuller in his _Worthies of\r\nEngland_, written only a very few years after Shakespeare's death,\r\nsays \"the best Mustard in England is made at Tewkesbury in the\r\ncounty of Gloucester.\" Coles observes (1657), \"in Gloucestershire\r\nabout Teuxbury they grind Mustard seed and make it up into balls,\r\nwhich are brought to London and other remote places as being the\r\nbest that the world affords.\" George the First restored the popularity\r\nof Mustard by his approval of it. Prior to 1720 no such condiment as\r\nMustard in its present form was used at table in this country. It\r\nis not improbable that the Romans, who were great eaters of\r\nMustard-seed pounded and steeped in new wine, brought the condiment\r\nwith them to our shores, and taught the ancient Britons how to prepare\r\nit. At Dijon in France where the best mixed continental Mustard is\r\nmade, the condiment is seasoned with various spices and savouries,\r\nsuch as Anchovies, Capers, Tarragon, Catsup of Walnuts, or\r\nMushrooms, and the liquors of other pickles. Philip the Bold\r\ngranted armorial ensigns (1382) to Dijon, with the motto _moult me\r\ntarde_ (I wish for ardently). The merchants of Sinapi copied this on\r\ntheir wares, the middle word of the motto being accidentally\r\neffaced. A well-known couplet of lines supposed to occur in\r\n_Hudibras_ (but not to be found there), has long baffled the research\r\nof quotation hunters:\r\n\r\n    \"Sympathy without relief\r\n    Is like to Mustard without beef.\"\r\n\r\nMustard flour moistened with a little water into a paste has the\r\nsingular property of dispelling the odours of musk, camphor, and\r\nthe fetid gum resins. For deodorising vessels which have contained\r\nthe essences of turpentine, creasote, assafetida, or other such drugs,\r\nit [380] will answer to introduce some bruised Mustard-seed, and\r\nthen a little water, shaking the vessel well for a minute or more, and\r\nafterwards rinsing it out with plenty of water.\r\n\r\nThe white Mustard grows when uncultivated on waste ground with\r\nlarge yellow flowers, and does not yield under any circumstances a\r\npungent oil like the black Mustard. It is a hirsute plant, with stalked\r\nleaves and hairy seed pods; and when produced in our gardens its\r\nyoung leaves are eaten as a salad, or as \"Mustard, with Cress.\"\r\n\r\n\"When in the leaf,\" says John Evelyn in his _Acetaria_, \"Mustard,\r\nespecially in young seedling plants, is of incomparable effect to\r\nquicken and revive the spirits, strengthening the memory, expelling\r\nheaviness, preventing the vertiginous palsy, and a laudable cephalic,\r\nbesides being an approved antiscorbutic.\" He tells further that the\r\nItalians, in making Mustard as a condiment, mingle lemon and\r\norange peel with the (black) seeds. \"In the composition of a sallet\r\nthe Mustard (a noble ingredient) should be of the best Tewkesbury\r\nor else of the soundest and weightiest Yorkshire seed, tempered a\r\nlittle by the fire to the consistence of a pap with vinegar, in which\r\nsome shavings of the horseradish have been steeped. Then, cutting\r\nan onion, and putting it into a small earthen gally-pot, pour the\r\nMustard over it and close it very well with a cork. _Note_.--The\r\nseeds should have been pounded in a mortar, or bruised with a\r\npolished cannon bullet in a large wooden bowl dish.\"\r\n\r\nThe active principle of white Mustard is \"Sinapin,\" and the seed\r\ngerminates so rapidly that it has been said a salad of this may be\r\ngrown while the joint of meat is being roasted for dinner. Seeds of\r\nthe white Mustard have been employed medicinally from early\r\ntimes. [381] Hippocrates advised their use both internally, and as a\r\ncounter-irritating poultice made with vinegar. When swallowed\r\nwhole in teaspoonful doses three or four times a day, they exercise a\r\nlaxative effect mechanically, and are voided without undergoing any\r\nperceptible change, only the outer skin being a little softened and\r\nmucilaginous. An infusion of the seed taken medicinally will relieve\r\nchronic bronchitis, and confirmed rheumatism: also for a relaxed\r\nsore throat a gargle of Mustard seed tea will be found of service.\r\n\r\nA French expression for trifling one's time away is _s'amuser a la\r\nmoutarde_. The essential oil is an admirable deodorant and\r\ndisinfectant, especially on an emergency.\r\n\r\nBut the \"grain of Mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds\" (_Mark\r\n_iv., 31), \"which when it is grown up is the greatest among herbs,\"\r\nwas a tree of the East, very different from our Mustard, and bearing\r\nbranches of real wood.\r\n\r\nThe Hedge Mustard (_Sisymbrium_, or _Erisymum_) grows by our\r\nroadsides, and on waste grounds, where it seems to possess a\r\npeculiar aptitude for collecting and retaining dust. The pods are\r\ndowny, close pressed to the stem, and the leaves hairy with their\r\npoints turned backwards. It is named by the French \"St. Barbara's\r\nHedge Mustard,\" and the Singer's Plant, \"_herbe au chantre_,\" or\r\n\"_herbe au chanteur_.\" Up to the time of Louis XIV, it was\r\nconsidered an infallible remedy for loss of the voice. Racine writing\r\nto Boileau recommended the syrup of _Erysimum_ to him when\r\nvisiting the waters of Bourbonne in order to be cured of\r\nvoicelessness. \"Si les eaux de Bourbonne ne vous guerissent pas de\r\nvotre extinction de voix, le sirop d'Erysimum vous guerirait\r\ninfalliblement. Ne l'oubliez pas, et a l'occasion vingt grammes par\r\nlitre d'eau en tisane [382] matin et soir.\" It used to be called Flix,\r\nor Flux weed from being given with benefit in dysentery, a disease\r\nformerly known as the Flix. This herb has been commended for\r\nchronic coughs and hoarseness, using the juice mixed with an equal\r\nquantity of honey, or sugar. It has been designated \"the most\r\nexcellent of all remedies for diseases of the throat, especially in\r\nulcerated sore throats, which it will serve to cure when all the advice\r\nof physicians and surgeons has proved ineffectual.\" A strong\r\ninfusion of the herb is excellent in asthmas, and it may be made\r\nwith sugar into a syrup which will keep all the year round. The\r\nHedge Mustard contains chemically a soft resin, and a sulphuretted\r\nvolatile oil. This herb with the vervain is supposed to form Count\r\nMattaei's noted nostrum _Febrifugo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLE.\r\n\r\nNo plant is more commonplace and plentiful in our fields and\r\nhedges throughout an English summer than the familiar stinging\r\nNettle. And yet most persons unknowingly include under this single\r\nappellation several distinct herbs. Actually as Nettles are to be\r\nfound: the annual _Urtica dioica_, or true Stinging Nettle; the\r\nperennial _Urtica urens_ (burning); the White Dead Nettle; the\r\nArchangel, or Yellow Weasel Snout, and the Purple Hedge Nettle.\r\nThis title \"Urtica\" comes _ab urendo_, \"from burning.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant which stings has a round hairy stalk, and carries only a\r\ndull colourless bloom, whereas the others are labiate herbs with\r\nsquare stems, and conspicuous lipped flowers. As Simples only the\r\ngreat Stinging Nettle, the lesser Stinging Nettle, and the white Dead\r\nNettle call for observation. Also another variety of our Stinging\r\nNettle is the _Urtica pilulifera_, called by [383] corruption the\r\nRoman Nettle, really because found abundantly at Romney in Kent.\r\nBut a legend obtains belief with some that Roman soldiers first\r\nbrought with them to England the seeds of this plant, and sowed it\r\nabout for their personal uses. They heard before coming that the\r\nclimate here was so cold that it might not be endured without some\r\nfriction to warm the blood, and to stir up the natural heat; and they\r\ntherefore bethought them to provide Nettles wherewith to chafe\r\ntheir limbs when \"stiffe and much benummed.\" Or, again, Lyte says,\r\n\"They do call al such strange herbes as be unknown of the common\r\npeople Romish, or Romayne herbes, although the same be brought\r\ndirect from Sweden or Norweigh.\" The cure for Nettle stings has\r\nbeen from early times to rub the part with a dock leaf. The dead\r\nNettles are so named as having no sting, but possessing nettle-like\r\nleaves. The stinging effect of the true Nettle is caused by an acrid\r\nsecretion contained in minute vesicles at the base of each of the stiff\r\nhairs; and _urtication_, or flogging, with Nettles, is an old external\r\nremedy, which was long practised for chronic rheumatism, and loss\r\nof muscular power. _Tacta quod exurat digitos urtica tenentis_.\r\n--Macer. Tea made from the young tops is a Devonshire cure for\r\nNettle-rash. Gerard says, \"the Nettle is a good medicine for them\r\nthat cannot breathe unless they hold their necks upright: and being\r\neaten boiled with periwinkles it makes the body soluble.\"\r\n\r\nThe word Nettle is derived from _net_, meaning something spun, or\r\nsewn; and it indicates the thread made from the hairs of the plant,\r\nand formerly used among Scandinavian nations. This was likewise\r\nemployed by Scotch weavers in the seventeenth century. Westmacott,\r\nthe historian, says, \"Scotch cloth is only the [384] housewifery\r\nof the Nettle.\" And the poet Campbell writes in one of his\r\nletters, \"I have slept in Nettle sheets, and dined off a Nettle table\r\ncloth: and I have heard my mother say she thought Nettle cloth\r\nmore durable than any other linen.\" Goldsmith has recorded the\r\n\"rubbing of a cock's heart with stinging Nettles to make it hatch\r\nhen's eggs.\" Some think the word \"Nettle\" an alteration of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon \"Needl,\" with reference to the needle-like stings. Spun\r\nsilk is now made in England from \"Ramie\" the decorticated fibre of\r\nNettles after washing away the glutinous juice from under their\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nThe seeds (_dioica_) contain a fine oil, and powerfully stimulate the\r\nsexual functions.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, as a recent mode of treatment, _urtication_ is now\r\nenthusiastically commended, that is, slapping, or pricking with a\r\nbundle of fresh Nettle twigs for one or more minutes, once, or\r\nseveral times in the day. It is a superlative method of cure because\r\nharmless (neither irritating the kidneys nor disfiguring the skin),\r\ncleanly, simple in application, rapid in its effects, and cheap, though\r\nperhaps somewhat rude. For sciatica, for incipient wasting, for the\r\ndifficult breathing of some heart troubles (where such stimulation\r\nalong the backbone affords more prompt and complete relief than\r\nany other treatment), for some coughs palsy, suppression of the\r\nmonthly flow in women, rheumatism, and for lack of muscular\r\nenergy, this urtication is said to be an invaluable resuscitating\r\nmeasure which has been successfully resorted to by the peasantry of\r\nRussia from time immemorial. It will sometimes produce a crop of\r\nsmall harmless blisters.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the fresh Nettle shows a presence of formic acid (the\r\nirritating principle of the stinging hairs), with mucilage, salts,\r\nammonia, carbonic acid, and [385] water. A strong decoction of\r\nNettles drunk too freely by mistake has produced severe burning\r\nover the whole body, with general redness, and a sense of being\r\nstung. The features became swollen, and minute vesicles appeared\r\non the skin, which burst, and discharged a limpid fluid. No fever\r\naccompanied the attack, and after five or six days the eruption dried\r\nup. A medicinal tincture (H.) is made from the entire plant with\r\nspirit of wine: and this, as taught by the principle of similars, may\r\nbe confidently given in small diluted doses to mitigate such a\r\ntotality of symptoms as now described, whether coming on as an\r\nattack of severe Nettle rash, or assuming some more pronounced\r\neruptive aspect, such as chicken pox. The same tincture also acts\r\nadmirably in cases of burns, when the deep skin is not destructively\r\ninvolved. And again for relieving the itching of the fundament\r\ncaused by the presence of threadworms.\r\n\r\n\"Burns,\" says Lucomsky, \"may be rapidly cured by applying over\r\nthem linen cloths well wetted with an alcoholic tincture of the\r\nStinging Nettle prepared from the fresh plant, this being diluted with\r\nan equal, or a double quantity of cold water. The cloths should be\r\nfrequently re-wetted, but without removing them, so as to prevent\r\npain from exposure.\" Dr. Burnett has shown conclusively that Nettle\r\ntea, and Nettle tincture (ten drops for a dose in water), are curative\r\nof feverish gout, as well as of intermittent fever and ague. Either\r\nremedy will promote a speedy extrication of gravel through the\r\nkidneys. Again the Nettle was a favourite old English remedy for\r\nconsumption, as already mentioned (see _Mugwort_), with reference\r\nto the mermaid of the Clyde, when she beheld with regret the\r\nuntimely funeral of a young Glasgow maiden.\r\n\r\n[386] Fresh Nettle juice given in doses of from one to two\r\ntablespoonfuls is a most serviceable remedy for all sorts of bleeding,\r\nwhether from the nose, the lungs, or some internal organ. Also the\r\ndecoction of the leaves and stalks taken in moderate quantities is\r\ncapital for many of the minor skin maladies.\r\n\r\nAn alcoholic extract is made officinally from the entire young plant\r\ngathered in the spring, and some of this if applied on cotton wool\r\nwill arrest bleeding from the nose, or after the extraction of a tooth,\r\nwhen persistent. If a leaf of the plant be put upon the tongue and\r\npressed against the roof of the mouth, it will stop a bleeding from\r\nthe nose. Taken as a fresh young vegetable in the spring, or early\r\nsummer, Nettle tops make a very wholesome and succulent dish of\r\ngreens, which is slightly laxative; but during Autumn they are\r\nhurtful. In Italy where herb soups are in high favour, \"herb knodel\"\r\n(or round balls made like a dumpling in size and consistency) of\r\nNettles are esteemed as nourishing and medicinal. The greater\r\nNettle (_Urtica dioica_), and the lesser Nettle (_Urtica urens_)\r\npossess stinging properties in common.\r\n\r\nA crystalline alkaloid which is fatal to frogs in a dose of one\r\ncentigramme, has been isolated from the common Stinging Nettle.\r\nThe watery extract has but little effect on mammals: but in the frog\r\nit causes paralysis, beginning in the great nervous centres and\r\nfinally stopping the action of the heart. If planted in the\r\nneighbourhood of beehives, the Nettle will serve to drive away\r\nfrogs.\r\n\r\nThe expressed seeds yield an oil which may be used for burning in\r\nlamps. Nettle leaves, rubbed into wooden vessels, such as tubs, &c.,\r\nwill prevent their leaking. The juice of the leaves coagulates, and\r\nfills up the [387] interstices of the wood. When dried the leaves will\r\noften relieve asthma and similar bronchial troubles by inhalation,\r\nalthough other means have failed. Eight or ten grains should be\r\nburnt, and the fumes inspired at bedtime.\r\n\r\nThe _Lamium album_ (white dead Nettle), a labiate plant, though\r\nnot of the stinging Nettle order, is likewise of special use for\r\narresting haemorrhage, as in spitting of blood, dysentery, and female\r\nfluxes. Its name _Lamium_ is got from the Greek _laimos_, the\r\nthroat, because of the shape of its corollae. If the plant be macerated\r\nin alcohol for a week, then cotton wool dipped in the liquid is as\r\nefficacious for staying bleeding, when applied to the spot, as the\r\nstrongly astringent muriate of iron. Also, a tincture of the flowers is\r\nmade (H.) for internal use in similar cases. From five to ten drops of\r\nthis tincture should be given for a dose with a tablespoonful of cold\r\nwater. The Red Nettle, another _Lamium_, is also called Archangel,\r\nbecause it blossoms on St. Michael's day, May 8th. If made into a\r\ntea and sweetened with honey, it promotes perspiration, and acts on\r\nthe kidneys. The white dead Nettle is a degenerate form of this\r\npurple herb as shown by still possessing on its petals the same\r\nbrown markings. Nevertheless, having disobeyed the laws of its growth,\r\nit has lost its original colour, and, like the Lady of Shalott, it\r\nis fain to complain \"the curse has come upon me.\" Count Mattaei's\r\nnostrum _Pettorale_ is thought to be got from the _Galeopsis_\r\n(hemp Nettle), another of the labiate herbs, with Nettle-like leaves,\r\nbut no stinging hairs, named from _galee_, a cat, or weazel, and\r\n_opsis_, a countenance, because supposed to have a blossom\r\nresembling the face of the animal specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[388] NIGHT SHADE, DEADLY (_Belladonna_).\r\n\r\nThis is a Solanaceous plant found native in Great Britain, and\r\ngrowing generally on chalky soil under hedges, or about waste\r\ngrounds. It bears the botanical name of _Atropa_, being so called\r\nfrom one of the classic Fates,--she who held the shears to cut the\r\nthread of human life:--\r\n\r\n    \"Clotho velum retinet, Lachesis net, et atropos occit.\"\r\n\r\nIts second title, _Belladonna_, was bestowed because the Spanish\r\nladies made use of the plant to dilate the pupils of their brilliant\r\nblack eyes. In this way their orbs appeared more attractively\r\nlustrous: and the _donna_ became _bella_ (beautiful). The plant is\r\ndistinguished by a large leaf growing beside a small one about its\r\nstems, whilst the solitary flowers, which droop, have a dark full\r\npurple border, being paler downwards, and without scent. The\r\nberries (in size like small cherries) are of a rich purplish black hue,\r\nand possess most dangerously narcotic properties. They are\r\nmedicinally useful, but so deadly that only the skilled hands of the\r\napothecary should attempt to manipulate them; and they should not\r\nbe prescribed for a patient except by the competent physician. When\r\ntaken by accident their mischievous effects may be prevented by\r\nswallowing as soon as possible a large glass of warm vinegar.\r\n\r\nA tincture of allied berries was used of old by ladies of fashion in\r\nthe land of the Pharaohs, as discovered among the mummy graves\r\nby Professor Baeyer, of Munich. This had the property of imparting\r\na verdant sheen to the human iris; and, perhaps by the quaint\r\ncolour-effect it produced on the transparent cornea of some wily\r\nEgyptian belle, it gave rise to the saying, \"Do you see any\r\ngreen in the white of my eye?\"\r\n\r\n[389] At one time _Belladonna_ leaves were held to be curative of\r\ncancer when applied externally as a poultice, either fresh, or dried,\r\nand powdered. It is remarkable that sheep, rabbits, goats, and swine\r\ncan eat these leaves with impunity, though (as Boerhaave tells) a\r\nsingle berry has been known to prove fatal to the human subject;\r\nand a gardener was once hanged for neglecting to remove plants of\r\nthe deadly Night Shade from certain grounds which he knew. A\r\npeculiar symptom in those poisoned by _Belladonna_ berries is the\r\ncomplete loss of voice, together with frequent bending forward of\r\nthe trunk, and continual movements of the hands and fingers.\r\nThe Scotch under Macbeth sent bread and wine treacherously\r\nimpregnated with this poison to the troops of Sweno.\r\n\r\nThe plant bears other titles, as \"Dwale\" (death's herb), \"Great\r\nMorel,\" and \"Naughty Man's Cherry.\" The term \"Morel\" is applied\r\nto the plant as a diminutive of _mora_, a Moor, on account of the\r\nblack-skinned berries. The _Belladonna_ grows especially near the\r\nruins of monasteries, and is so abundant around Furness Abbey that\r\nthis locality has been styled the \"Vale of Night Shade.\"\r\n\r\nHahnemann taught that, acting on the law of similars, Belladonna\r\ngiven in very small doses of its tincture will protect from the\r\ninfection of scarlet fever. He confirmed this fact by experiments on\r\none hundred and sixty children. When taken by provers in actual\r\ntoxic doses the tincture, or the fresh juice, has induced sore throat,\r\nfeverishness, and a dry, red, hot skin, just as if symptomatic of\r\nscarlet fever. The plant yields atropine and hyoscyamine from all its\r\nparts. As a drug it specially affects the brain and the bladder. The\r\nberries are known in Buckinghamshire as \"Devil's cherries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[390] NUTMEG, CINNAMON, GINGER, and CLOVES.\r\n\r\nThe spice box is such a constant source of ready domestic comforts\r\nof a medicinal sort in every household that the more important, and\r\nbest known of its contents may well receive some consideration\r\nwhen treating of Herbal Simples; though it will, of course, be\r\nunderstood these spices are of foreign growth, and not indigenous\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nCinnamon, Nutmeg, Ginger, and Cloves, claim particular notice in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\n    \"Sinament, Ginger, Nutmeg, and Cloves,\r\n    And that gave me my jolly red nose.\"\r\n        _Beaumont and Fletcher_.\r\n\r\nCinnamon possesses positive medicinal as well as aromatic virtues.\r\nWhat we employ as this spice consists of the inner bark of shoots\r\nfrom the stocks of a Ceylon tree, first cultivated here in 1768.\r\n\r\nSuch bark chemically contains cinnamic acid, tannin, a resin, and\r\nsugar, so that its continued use will induce constipation. The\r\naromatic and stimulating effects of Cinnamon have been long\r\nknown. It was freely given in England during the epidemic scourges\r\nof the early and middle centuries, nearly every monastery keeping a\r\nstore of the cordial for ready use. The monks administered it in\r\nfever, dysentery, and contagious diseases. And recent discovery in\r\nthe laboratory of M. Pasteur, the noted French bacteriologist, has\r\nshown that Cinnamon possesses the power of absolutely destroying\r\nall disease germs. Our ancestors, it would appear, had hit upon a\r\nvaluable preservative against microbes, when they infused\r\nCinnamon with other spices in their mulled drinks. Mr. Chamberland\r\nsays, \"no disease germ can long resist the antiseptic powder\r\nof essence of Cinnamon, [391] which is as effective to destroy\r\nmicrobes as corrosive sublimate.\"\r\n\r\nBy its warming astringency, it exercises cordial properties which are\r\nmost useful in arresting passive diarrhoea, and in relieving flatulent\r\nindigestion.\r\n\r\nIts volatile oil is procured from the bark, and likewise a tincture,\r\nas well as an aromatic water of Cinnamon. For a sick qualmish\r\nstomach either preparation is an excellent remedy, as the virtue of\r\nthe bark rests in this essential volatile oil. When obtained from the\r\n_fruit_ it is extremely fragrant, of thick consistence, and sometimes\r\nmade into candles at Ceylon, for the sole use of the king. The doses\r\nare of the powdered bark from ten to twenty grains; of the oil from\r\none to five drops; of the tincture from half to one teaspoonful, and\r\nof the distilled water from one to two tablespoonfuls. Our Queen is\r\nknown to be partial to the use of Cinnamon. Keats, the poet, wrote\r\nof \"lucent syrups tinct. with Cinnamon.\" And Saint Francis of Sales\r\nsays in his _Devout Life_: \"With respect to the labour of teaching, it\r\nrefreshes and revives the heart by the sweetness it brings to those\r\nwho are engaged in it, as the Cinnamon does in _Arabia Felix_ to\r\nthem who are laden with it.\" In toxic quantities of an injurious\r\namount, Cinnamon bark has produced haemorrhage from the bowels,\r\nand nose bleeding. Therefore small doses of the diluted tincture\r\nare well calculated to obviate these symptoms when presenting\r\nthemselves through illness.\r\n\r\nThe bark was formerly thought to stimulate the functions of the\r\nwomb, and of late it has come again into medical use for this\r\npurpose. To check fluxes from that organ a teaspoonful of the\r\nbruised bark should be infused in half a pint of boiling water, and a\r\ntablespoonful given frequently when cool. Lozenges made [392]\r\nwith the essential oil are also medicinally available for the speedy\r\nrelief of sickness, and as highly useful against influenza. It is well\r\nknown that persons who live in Cinnamon districts have an\r\nimmunity from malaria.\r\n\r\nGinger (_Zingiberis radix_) is the root-stock of a plant grown in the\r\nEast and West Indies, and is scraped before importation. Its odour is\r\ndue to an essential oil, and its pungent hot taste to a resin. It was\r\nknown in Queen Elizabeth's reign, having been introduced by the\r\nDutch about 1566. \"Grene Gynger of almondes\" is mentioned in the\r\nPaston Letters, 1444. \"When condited,\" says Gerard, \"it provoketh\r\nvenerie.\"\r\n\r\nThis Green Ginger, which consists of the young shoots of the\r\nrhizome, when boiled in syrup makes an excellent preserve.\r\nOfficinally from the dried and scraped _rhizome_ are prepared a\r\ntincture, and a syrup. If a piece of the root is chewed it causes a\r\nconsiderable flow of saliva, and an application of powdered Ginger,\r\nmade with water into paste, against the skin will produce intense\r\ntingling and heat. To which end it may be spread on paper and\r\napplied to the forehead as a means for relieving a headache from\r\npassive fulness. In India, Europeans who suffer from languid\r\nindigestion drink an infusion of Ginger as a substitute for tea. For\r\ngouty dyspepsia the root may be powdered in a mortar: and a\r\nheaped teaspoonful of it should be then infused in boiling milk; to\r\nbe taken when sufficiently cool, for supper or at breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe dose of the powder is from ten to twenty grains; of the tincture\r\nfrom a third of a teaspoonful to a teaspoonful, in water hot or cold;\r\nof the syrup from one to two teaspoonfuls in water. Either\r\npreparation is of service to correct diarrhoea, and to relieve weakly\r\nchronic bronchitis. Also as admirably corrective of [393] chronic\r\nconstipation through general intestinal sluggishness, a vespertine\r\nslice of good, old-fashioned Gingerbread made with brown treacle\r\nand grated ginger may be eaten with zest, and reliance. There is a\r\nstreet in Hull called \"The land of Ginger.\"\r\n\r\nThe habitat of the tree from which our Nutmeg comes is the\r\nMolucca Islands, and the part of the nut which constitutes the Spice\r\nis the kernel. This is called generically _Nux moschata_, or Mugget\r\n(French _Musque_) a diminutive of musk, from its aromatic odour,\r\nand properties. The Nutmeg is oval, or nearly round, of a brown\r\nwrinkled aspect, with an aromatic smell, and a bitter fragrant taste.\r\nOfficinally the tree is named _Myristica officinalis_, and the oil\r\ndistilled from the Nutmeg in Britain is much superior to foreign oil.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily as a condiment of a warming character the Nutmeg is\r\nemployed to correct cold indigestible food, or as a cordial addition\r\nto negus: and medicinally for languid digestion, with giddiness and\r\nflatulence, causing oppressed breathing. Its activity depends on the\r\nvolatile oil, contained in the proportion of six per cent. in the nut.\r\nThis when given at all largely is essentially narcotic. Four Nutmegs\r\nhave been known to completely paralyse all nervous sensibility, and\r\nhave produced a sort of wakeful unconsciousness for three entire\r\ndays, with loss of memory afterwards, and with more or less\r\nparalysis until after eight days.\r\n\r\nThe Banda, or Nutmeg Islands in the Indian Ocean, are twelve in\r\nnumber, and the strength of the Nutmeg in its season is said to\r\novercome birds of Paradise so that they fall helplessly intoxicated.\r\n\r\nWhen taken to any excess, whether as a spice, or as a medicine, the\r\nNutmeg and its preparations are apt to cause giddiness, oppression\r\nof the chest, stupor, and [394] delirium. A moderate dose of the\r\npowdered Nutmeg is from five to twenty grains, but persons with a\r\ntendency to apoplexy should abstain from any free use of this spice.\r\nFrom two to six drops of the essential oil may be taken on sugar to\r\nrelieve flatulent oppression and dyspepsia, or from half to one\r\nteaspoonful of the spirit of Nutmeg made by mixing one part of the\r\noil with forty parts of spirit of wine; this dose being had with one\r\nor two tablespoonfuls of hot water, sweetened if desired.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture is prepared (H.) from the kernel with spirit of\r\nwine (not using the oil, nor the essence). This in small diluted doses\r\nis highly useful for drowsiness connected with flatulent indigestion,\r\nand a disposition to faintness: also for gout retrocedent to the\r\nstomach. The dose is from five to ten drops with a spoonful of water\r\nevery half hour, or every hour until the symptoms are adequately\r\nrelieved. Against diarrhoea Nutmeg grated into warm water is very\r\nhelpful, and will prove an efficient substitute for opium in mild\r\ncases. Externally the spirit of Nutmeg is a capital application to be\r\nrubbed in for chronic rheumatism, and for paralysed limbs. The\r\n\"butter of Nutmegs,\" or their concrete oil, is used in making plasters\r\nof a warming, and stimulating kind. A drink that was concocted by\r\nour grandmothers was Nutmeg tea. One Nutmeg would make a pint\r\nof this tea, two or three cupfuls of which would produce a sleep of\r\nmany hours' duration. The worthy old ladies were wont to carry a\r\nsilver grater and Nutmeg case suspended from the waist on their\r\nchatelaines. But in any large quantity the Nutmeg may produce\r\nsleep of such a profundity as to prove really dangerous. Two\r\ndrachms of the powder have brought on a comatose sleep with some\r\ndelirium.\r\n\r\n[395] The Nutmeg contains starch, protein, and other simple\r\nconstituents, in addition to its stimulating principles. Mace is the\r\naromatic envelope of the Nutmeg, and possesses the same qualities\r\nin a minor degree. Its infusion is a good warming medicine against\r\nchronic cough, and moist bronchial asthma in an old person. Mace\r\nis a membranaceous structure enveloping the Nutmeg, having a\r\nfleshy texture, and being of a light yellowish-brown colour. It\r\nsupplies an allied essential volatile principle, which is fragrant and\r\ncordial. If given three or four times during the twenty-four hours, in\r\na dose of from eight to twelve grains, crushed, or powdered Mace\r\nwill prove serviceable against long-continued looseness of the\r\nbowels; but this dose should not be exceeded for fear of inducing\r\nnarcotism.\r\n\r\nCloves (from _clavus_, a nail), also found in the kitchen spice box,\r\nand owning certain medicinal resources of a cordial sort, which are\r\nquickly available, belong to the Myrtle family of plants, and are the\r\nunexpanded flower buds of an aromatic tree (_Caryophyllus_),\r\ncultivated at Penang and elsewhere. They contain a volatile oil\r\nwhich, like that of Chamomile, although cordial, lowers nervous\r\nsensibility, or irritability: also tannin, a gum resin, and woody\r\nfibre. This volatile oil consists principally of \"eugenin\" with a\r\ncamphor, \"caryophyllin.\" The \"eugenic acid,\" with a strong odour of\r\ncloves, is powerfully antiseptic and anti-putrescent. It reduces the\r\nsensibility of the skin: and therefore the oil with lanolin is a\r\nuseful application for eczema.\r\n\r\nDr Burnett has lately taught (1895) that a too free use of Cloves will\r\nbring on albuminuria; and that when this disease has supervened\r\nfrom other causes, the dilute tincture of Cloves, third decimal\r\nstrength, will frequently do much to lessen the quantity of albumen\r\n[396] excreted by the kidneys. From five to ten drops of this tincture\r\nshould be given with water three times a day.\r\n\r\nUsed in small quantities as a spice the Clove stimulates digestion,\r\nbut when taken more freely it deadens the susceptibility of the\r\nstomach, lessens the appetite, and induces constipation. An infusion\r\nof Cloves, made with half an ounce to a pint of water, and drank in\r\ndoses of a small wineglassful, will relieve the nausea and coldness\r\nof flatulent indigestion. The oil put on cotton wool into the hollow\r\nof a decayed tooth is a useful means for giving ease to toothache.\r\nThe dose of the oil is from one to five drops, on sugar, or in a\r\nspoonful of milk. The odour of Cloves is aromatic, and the taste\r\npleasantly hot, but acrid. Half a tumbler of quite hot water poured\r\nover half a dozen Cloves (which are to brew for a few minutes on\r\nthe hob, and then to be taken out), will often secure a good night to\r\na restless dyspeptic patient, if taken just before getting into bed. Or\r\nif given cold before breakfast this dose will obviate constipation. In\r\nHolland the oil of Cloves is prescribed with cinchona bark for ague.\r\nArthur Cecil's German medico in the Play advises his patient to \"rub\r\nyour pelly mit a Clove.\"\r\n\r\nAll-Spice (_Pimento_) is another common occupant of the domestic\r\nspice box. It is popular as a warming cordial, of a sweet odour, and\r\na grateful aromatic taste; but being a native of South America,\r\ngrows with us only as a stove plant. The leaves and bark are full of\r\ninflammable particles, whilst walks between Pimento trees are\r\nodorous with a delicious scent. The name All-Spice is given because\r\nthe berries afford in smell and taste a combination of Cloves,\r\nJuniper berries, Cinnamon and Pepper. The special qualities of the\r\nPimento reside in the rind of these berries; and this tree is the\r\n_Bromelia ananas_, [397] named in Brazil Nana. An extract made\r\nfrom the crushed berries by boiling them down to a thick liquor, is,\r\nwhen spread on linen, a capital stimulating plaster for neuralgic or\r\nrheumatic parts. About the physician in \"les Francais\" it was said\r\nadmiringly \"c'est lui qui a invente la salade d'Ananas.\" The essential\r\noil, as well as the spirit and the distilled water of Pimento, are\r\nuseful against flatulent indigestion and for hysterical paroxysms. This\r\nSpice was formerly added to our syrup of buckthorn to prevent it\r\nfrom griping. The berries are put into curry powder, and added to\r\nmulled wines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAT.\r\n\r\nThe Oat is a native of Britain in its wild and uncultivated form, and\r\nis distinguished by the spikelets of its ears hanging on slender\r\npedicels. This is the _Avena fatua_, found in our cornfields, but not\r\nindigenous in Scotland. When cultivated it is named _Avena\r\nsativa_. As it needs less sunshine and solar warmth to ripen the\r\ngrain than wheat, it furnishes the principal grain food of cold\r\nNorthern Europe. With the addition of some fat this grain is capable\r\nof supporting life for an indefinite period. Physicians formerly\r\nrecommended highly a diet-drink made from Oats, about which\r\nHoffman wrote a treatise at the end of the seventeenth century; and\r\nJohannis de St. Catherine, who introduced the drink, lived by its use\r\nto a hundred years free from any disease. Nevertheless the Oat did\r\nnot enjoy a good reputation among the old Romans; and Pliny said\r\n\"Primum omnis frumenti vitium avena est.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican doctors have taken of late to extol the Oat (_Avena\r\nsativa_) when made into a strong medicinal tincture with spirit of\r\nwine, as a remarkable nervine stimulant and restorative: this being\r\n\"especially valuable in [398] all cases where there is a deficiency of\r\nnervous power, for instance, among over-worked lawyers, public\r\nspeakers, and writers.\"\r\n\r\nThe tincture is ordered to be given in a dose of from ten to twenty\r\ndrops, once or twice during the day, in hot water to act speedily; and\r\na somewhat increased dose in cold water at bedtime so as to produce\r\nits beneficial effects more slowly then. It proves an admirable\r\nremedy for sleeplessness from nervous exhaustion, and as prepared\r\nin New York may be procured from any good druggist in England.\r\nOatmeal contains two per cent. of protein compounds, the largest\r\nportion of which is avenin. A yeast poultice made by stirring\r\nOatmeal into the grounds of strong beer is a capital cleansing and\r\nhealing application to languid sloughing sores.\r\n\r\nOatmeal supplies very little saccharine matter ready formed. It\r\ncannot be made into light bread, and is therefore prepared when\r\nbaked in cakes; or, its more popular form for eating is that of\r\nporridge, where the ground meal becomes thoroughly soft by\r\nboiling, and is improved in taste by the addition of milk and salt.\r\n\"The halesome parritch, chief of Scotia's food,\" said Burns, with\r\nfervid eloquence. Scotch people actually revel in their parritch and\r\nbannocks. \"We defy your wheaten bread,\" says one of their\r\nfavourite writers, \"your home-made bread, your bakers' bread, your\r\nbaps, rolls, scones, muffins, crumpets, and cookies, your bath buns,\r\nand your sally luns, your tea cakes, and slim cakes, your saffron\r\ncakes, and girdle cakes, your shortbread, and singing hinnies: we\r\nswear by the Oat cake, and the parritch, the bannock, and the brose.\"\r\nScotch beef brose is made by boiling Oatmeal in meat liquor, and\r\nkail brose by cooking Oatmeal in cabbage-water. [399] Crushed\r\nOatmeal, from which the husk has been removed, is known as\r\n\"groats,\" and is employed for making gruel. At the latter end of the\r\nseventeenth century this was a drink asked-for eagerly by the public\r\nat London taverns. \"Grantham gruel,\" says quaint old Fuller, in his\r\n_History of the Worthies of England_, \"consists of nine grits and a\r\ngallon of water.\" When \"thus made, it is wash rather, which one will\r\nhave little heart to eat, and yet as little heart by eating.\" But the\r\nbetter gruel concocted elsewhere was \"a wholesome Spoon meat,\r\nthough homely; physic for the sick, and food for persons in health;\r\ngrits the form thereof: and giving the being thereunto.\" In the border\r\nforays of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries all the provision\r\ncarried by the Scotch was simply a bag of Oatmeal. But as a food it\r\nis apt to undergo some fermentation in the stomach, and to provoke\r\nsour eructations. Furthermore, it is somewhat laxative, because\r\ncontaining a certain proportion of bran which mechanically\r\nstimulates the intestinal membranes: and this insoluble bran is rather\r\napt to accumulate. Oatmeal gruel may be made by boiling from one\r\nto two ounces of the meal with three pints of water down to two\r\npints, then straining the decoction, and pouring off the supernatant\r\nliquid when cool. Its flavour may be improved by adding raisins\r\ntowards the end of boiling, or by means of sugar and nutmeg.\r\nBecause animals of speed use up, by the lungs, much heat-forming\r\nmaterial, Oats (which abound in carbonaceous constituents) are\r\nspecially suitable as food for the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONION (_see_ Garlic, _page 209_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE.\r\n\r\nThough not of native British growth, except by way of a luxury in\r\nthe gardens of the wealthy, yet the Orange [400] is of such common\r\nuse amongst all classes of our people as a dietetic fruit, when of the\r\nsweet China sort, and for tonic medicinal purposes when of the\r\nbitter Seville kind, that some consideration may be fairly accorded\r\nto it as a Curative Simple in these pages.\r\n\r\nThe _Citrus aurantium_, or popular Orange, came originally from\r\nIndia, and got its distinctive title of _Aurantium_, either (_ab aureo\r\ncolore corticis_) from the golden colour of its peel, or (_ab oppido\r\nAchoeioe Arantium_) from Arantium, a town of Achaia. It now\r\ncomes to us chiefly from Portugal and Spain. This fruit is essentially\r\na product of cultivation extending over many years. It began in\r\nHindustan as a small bitter berry with seeds; then about the eighth\r\ncentury it was imported into Persia, though held somewhat\r\naccursed. During the tenth century it bore the name \"Bigarade,\" and\r\nbecame better known. But not until the sixteenth century was it\r\nfreely grown by the Spaniards, and brought into Mexico. Even at\r\nthat time the legend still prevailed that whoever partook of the\r\nluscious juice was compelled to embrace the faith of the prophet.\r\nSpenser and Milton tell of the orange as the veritable golden apple\r\npresented by Jupiter to Juno on the day of their nuptials: and hence\r\nperhaps arose its more modern association with marriage rites.\r\n\r\nOf the varieties the China Orange is the most juicy, being now\r\ngrown in the South of Europe; whilst the St. Michael Orange (a\r\ndescendant of the China sort, first produced in Syria), is now got\r\nabundantly from the Azores, whence it derives its name.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn says the first China Orange which appeared in Europe,\r\nwas sent as a present to the old Conde Mellor; then Prime Minister\r\nto the King of Portugal, when only one plant escaped sound and useful\r\n[401] of the whole case which reached Lisbon, and this became the\r\nparent of all the Orange trees cultivated by our gardeners, though\r\nnot without greatly degenerating.\r\n\r\nThe Seville Orange is that which contains the medicinal properties,\r\nmore especially in its leaves, flowers, and fruit, though the China\r\nsort possesses the same virtues in a minor degree. The leaves and\r\nthe flowers have been esteemed as beneficial against epilepsy, and\r\nother convulsive disorders; and a tea is infused from the former\r\nfor hysterical sufferers.\r\n\r\nTwo delicious perfumes are distilled from the flowers--oil of neroli,\r\nand napha water,--of which the chemical hydro-carbon \"hesperidin,\" is\r\nmainly the active principle. This is secreted also as an aromatic\r\nattribute of the leaves through their minute glands, causing them to\r\nemit a fragrant odour when bruised. A scented water is largely prepared\r\nin France from the flowers, _l'eau de fleur d'oranger_, which is\r\nfrequently taken by ladies as a gentle sedative at night, when\r\nsufficiently diluted with sugared water. Thousands of gallons are\r\ndrunk in this way every year. As a pleasant and safely effective help\r\ntowards wooing sleep, from one to two teaspoonfuls of the French\r\n_Eau de fleur d'oranger_, if taken at bedtime in a teacupful of hot\r\nwater, are to be highly commended for a nervous, or excitably\r\nwakeful person.\r\n\r\nOrange buds are picked green from the trees in the gardens of\r\nthe Riviera, and when dried they retain the sweet smell of\r\nthe flowers. A teaspoonful of these buds is ordered to be infused\r\nin a teacupful of quite hot water, and the liquid to be drunk shortly,\r\nbefore going to bed. The effect is to induce a refreshing sleep,\r\nwithout any subsequent headache or nausea. The dried berries may\r\nbe had from an English druggist.\r\n\r\n[402] A peeled Orange contains, some citric acid, with citrate of\r\npotash; also albumen, cellulose, water, and about eight per cent. of\r\nsugar. The white lining pith of the peel possesses likewise the\r\ncrystalline principle \"hesperidin.\" Dr. Cullen showed that the acid\r\njuice of oranges, by uniting with the bile, diminishes the bitterness\r\nof that secretion; and hence it is that this fruit is of particular\r\nservice in illnesses which arise from a redundancy of bile, chiefly in\r\ndark persons of a fibrous, or bilious temperament. But if the acids of\r\nthe Orange are greater in quantity than can be properly corrected by\r\nthe bile (as in persons with a small liver, and feeble digestive\r\npowers), they seem, by some prejudicial union with that liquid, to\r\nacquire a purgative quality, and to provoke diarrhoea, with colicky\r\npains.\r\n\r\nThe rind or peel of the Seville Orange is darker in colour, and more\r\nbitter of taste than that of the sweet China fruit. It affords a\r\nconsiderable quantity of fragrant, aromatic oil, which partakes of the\r\ncharacters exercised by the leaves and the flowers as affecting the\r\nnervous system. Pereira records the death of a child which resulted\r\nfrom eating the rind of a sweet China Orange.\r\n\r\nThe small green fruits (windfalls) from the Orange trees of each\r\nsort, which become blown off, or shaken down during the heats of\r\nthe summer, are collected and dried, forming the \"orange berries\" of\r\nthe shops. They are used for flavouring curacoa, and for making\r\nissue peas. These berries furnish a fragrant oil, the _essence de petit\r\ngrain_, and contain citrates, and malates of lime and potash, with\r\n\"hesperidin,\" sulphur, and mineral salts. The Orange flowers yield a\r\nvolatile, odorous oil, acetic acid, and acetate of lime. The juice of\r\nthe Orange consists of citric and malic acids, with sugar; [403]\r\ncitrate of lime, and water. The peel furnishes hesperidin, a volatile\r\noil, gallic acid, and a bitter principle.\r\n\r\nBy druggists, a confection of bitter orange peel is sold; also a syrup\r\nof this orange peel, and a tincture of the same, made with spirit of\r\nwine, to be given in doses of from one to two teaspoonfuls with\r\nwater, as an agreeable stomachic bitter. _Eau de Cologne_ contains\r\noil of neroli, oil of citron, and oil of orange.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice of Oranges is antiseptic, and will prevent scurvy if\r\ntaken in moderation daily. Common Oranges cut through the middle\r\nwhile green, and dried in the air, being afterwards steeped for forty\r\ndays in oil, are used by the Arabs for preparing an essence famous\r\namong their old women because it will restore a fresh dark, or\r\nblack colour to grey hair. The custom of a bride wearing Orange\r\nblossoms, is probably due to the fact that flowers and fruit appear\r\ntogether on the tree, in token of a wish that the bride may retain the\r\ngraces of maidenhood amid the cares of married life. This custom\r\nhas been derived from the Saracens, and was originally suggested\r\nalso by the fertility of the Orange tree.\r\n\r\nThe rind of the Seville Orange has proved curative of ague, and\r\npowerfully remedial to restrain the monthly flux of women when in\r\nexcess. Its infusion is of service also against flatulency. A drachm\r\nof the powdered leaves may be given for a dose in nervous and\r\nhysterical ailments. Finally, \"the Orange,\" adds John Evelyn,\r\n\"sharpens appetite, exceedingly refreshes, and resists putrefaction.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fruit, it is said that workpeople engaged in the\r\norange trade enjoy a special immunity from influenza, whilst a free\r\npartaking of the juice given largely, has been found preventive of\r\n[404]  pneumonia as complicating this epidemic. The benefit is said\r\nto occur through lessening the fibrin of the blood.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Shakespeare, it was the fashion to carry \"pomanders,\"\r\nthese being oranges from which all the pulp had been scooped out,\r\nwhilst a circular hole was made at the top. Then after the peel had\r\nbecome dry, the fruit was filled with spices, so as to make a sort of\r\nscent-box. Orange lilies, Orangemen, and William of Orange, are all\r\nmore or less associated with this fruit. The Dutch Government had\r\nno love for the House of Orange: and many a grave burgomaster\r\nwent so far as to banish from his garden the Orange lily, and\r\nMarigold; also the sale of Oranges and Carrots was prohibited in the\r\nmarkets on account of their aristocratic colour.\r\n\r\nThere exists at Brighton a curious custom of bowling or throwing\r\nOranges along the high road on Boxing day. He whose Orange is hit\r\nby that of another, forfeits the fruit to the successful hitter.\r\n\r\nIn Henry the Eighth's reign Oranges were made into pies, or the\r\njuice was squeezed out, and mixed with wine. This fruit when\r\npeeled, and torn into sections, after removing the white pith, and the\r\npips, and sprinkling over it two or three spoonfuls of powdered loaf\r\nsugar, makes a most wholesome salad. A few candied orange-flower\r\npetals will impart a fine flavour to tea when infused with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHIDS.\r\n\r\nOur common English Orchids are the \"Early Purple,\" which is\r\nabundant in our woods and pastures; the \"Meadow Orchis\"; and the\r\n\"Spotted Orchis\" of our heaths and commons. Less frequent are the\r\n\"Bee Orchis,\" the \"Butterfly Orchis,\" \"Lady's Tresses,\" and the\r\n\"Tway blade.\"\r\n\r\n[405] Two roundish tubers form the root of an Orchid, and give its\r\nname to the plant from the Greek _orchis_, testicle. A nutritive\r\nstarchy product named Salep, or Saloop, is prepared from the roots\r\nof the common Male Orchis, and its infusion or decoction was taken\r\ngenerally in this country as a beverage before the introduction of tea\r\nand coffee. Sassafras chips were sometimes added for giving the\r\ndrink a flavour. Salep obtained from the tubers of foreign Orchids\r\nwas specially esteemed; and even now that sold in Indian bazaars is\r\nso highly valued for its fine qualities that most extravagant prices\r\nare paid for it by wealthy Orientals. Also in Persia and Turkey it is\r\nin great repute for recruiting the exhausted vitality of aged, and\r\nenervated persons. In this country it may be purchased as a powder,\r\nbut not readily miscible with water, so that many persons fail in\r\nmaking the decoction. The powder should be first stirred with a\r\nlittle spirit of wine: then the water should be added suddenly, and\r\nthe mixture boiled. One dram by weight of the salep powder in a\r\nfluid dram and a half of the spirit, to half-a-pint of water, are the\r\nproper proportions. Sometimes amber, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger\r\nare added.\r\n\r\nDr. Lind, in the middle of the last century, strongly advised that\r\nships, and soldiers on long marches, should be provided with Salep\r\nmade into a paste or cake. This (with a little portable soup added)\r\nwill allay hunger and thirst if made liquid. An ounce in two quarts\r\nof boiling water will sufficiently sustain a man for one day, being a\r\ncombination of animal and vegetable foods. Among the early\r\nRomans the Orchis was often called \"Satyrion,\" because it was\r\nthought to be the food of the Satyrs, exciting them to their sexual\r\norgies. Hence the Orchis root became famous as all aphrodisiac\r\n[406] medicine, and has been so described by all herbalists from the\r\ntime of Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nA tradition is ascribed to the English Orchis Mascula (early Purple),\r\nof which the leaves are usually marked with purple spots. It is said\r\nthat these are stains of the precious blood which flowed from our\r\nLord's body on the cross at Calvary, where this species of Orchis is\r\nreputed to have grown. Similarly in Cheshire, the plant bears the\r\nname of Gethsemane. This early Orchis is the \"long Purples,\"\r\nmentioned by Shakespeare in Hamlet: and it is sometimes named\r\n\"Dead men's fingers,\" from the pale colour, and the hand-like shape\r\nof its tubers.\r\n\r\n    \"That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\r\n    But our cold maids do 'dead men's fingers' call them.\"\r\n\r\nIt is further styled \"Cain and Abel\" and \"Rams' horns,\" the odour\r\nbeing offensive, especially in the evening. It thrives wherever the\r\nwild hyacinth flourishes, and is believed by some to grow best\r\nwhere the earth below is rich in metal. Country people in Yorkshire\r\ncall it \"Crake feet,\" and in Kent \"Keat legs,\" or \"Neat legs.\" The\r\nroots of this Orchis abound with a glutinous sweetish juice, of\r\nwhich a Salep may be made which is quite equal to any brought\r\nfrom the Levant. The new root should be washed in hot water, and\r\nits thin brown skin rubbed off with a linen cloth. Having thus\r\nprepared a sufficient number of roots, the operator should spread\r\nthem on a tin plate in a hot oven for eight or ten minutes, until they\r\nget to look horny, but without shrinking in size: and being then\r\nwithdrawn, they may be dried with more gentle heat, or by exposure\r\nto the air. Their concocted juice can be employed with the same\r\nintentions and in the same complaints as gum arabic,--about which\r\nwe read that [407] not only has it served to sustain whole negro\r\ntowns during a scarcity of other provisions, but the Arabs who\r\ncollect it by the river Niger have nothing else to live upon for\r\nmonths together.\r\n\r\nSalep is a most useful article of diet for those who suffer from\r\nchronic diarrhoea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSLEY.\r\n\r\nParsely is found in this country only as a cultivated plant, having\r\nbeen introduced into England from Sardinia in the sixteenth century.\r\nIt is an umbelliferous herb, which has been long of garden growth\r\nfor kitchen uses. The name was formerly spelt \"Percely,\" and the\r\nherb was known as March, or Merich (in Anglo-Saxon, Merici). Its\r\nadjective title, _Petroselinum_, signifies \"growing on a rock.\" The\r\nGreeks held Parsley in high esteem, making therewith the victor's\r\ncrown of dried and withered Parsley, at their Isthmian games, and\r\nthe wreath for adorning the tombs of their dead. Hence the proverb,\r\n_Deeisthai selinon_ (to need only Parsley) was applied to persons\r\ndangerously ill, and not expected to live. The herb was never\r\nbrought to table of old, being held sacred to oblivion and the\r\ndefunct.\r\n\r\nIt is reputed to have sprung from the blood of a Greek hero,\r\nArchemorus, the fore-runner of death; and Homer relates that\r\nchariot horses were fed by warriors with this herb. Greek gardens\r\nwere often bordered with Parsley and Rue: and hence arose the\r\nsaying when an undertaking was in contemplation but not yet\r\ncommenced, \"Oh! we are only at the Parsley and Rue.\"\r\n\r\nGarden Parsley was not cultivated in England until the second year\r\nof Edward the Sixth's reign, 1548. In our modern times the domestic\r\nherb is associated rather with those who come into the world than\r\nwith those [408] who go out of it. Proverbially the Parsley-bed is\r\npropounded to our little people who ask awkward questions, as the\r\nfruitful source of new-born brothers and sisters when suddenly\r\nappearing within the limits of the family circle. In Suffolk there is\r\nan old belief that to ensure the herb coming up \"double,\" Parsley\r\nseed must be sown on Good Friday.\r\n\r\nThe root is faintly aromatic, and has a sweetish taste. It contains a\r\nchemical principle, \"apiin,\" sugar, starch, and a volatile oil.\r\nLikewise the fruit furnishes the same volatile oil in larger\r\nabundance, this oil comprising parsley-camphor, and \"apiol,\" the\r\ntrue essential oil of parsley, which may be now had from all leading\r\ndruggists. Apiol exercises all the virtues of the entire plant, and is\r\nespecially beneficial for women who are irregular as to their\r\nmonthly courses because of ovarian debility. From three to six drops\r\nshould be given on sugar, or in milk (or as a prepared capsule) twice\r\nor three times in the day for some days together, at the times\r\nindicated, beginning early at the expected date of each period. If too\r\nlarge a dose of apiol be taken it will cause headache, giddiness,\r\nstaggering, and deafness; and if going still further, it will induce\r\nepileptiform convulsions. For which reason, in small diluted doses,\r\nthe same medicament will curatively meet this train of symptoms\r\nwhen occurring as a morbid state. And it is most likely on such\r\naccount Parsley has been popularly said to be \"poison to men, and\r\nsalvation to women.\" Apiol was first obtained in 1849, by Drs. Joret\r\nand Homolle, of Brittany, and proved an excellent remedy there for\r\na prevailing ague. It exercises a singular influence on the great\r\nnervous centres within the head and spine. Bruised Parsley seeds\r\nmake a decoction which is likewise beneficial against [409] ague\r\nand intermittent fever. They have gained a reputation in America as\r\nhaving a special tendency to regulate the reproductive functions in\r\neither sex. Country folk in many places think it unlucky to sow\r\nParsley, or to move its roots; and a rustic adage runs thus: \"Fried\r\nparsley brings a man to his saddle, and a Woman to her grave.\"\r\nTaking Parsley in excess at table will impair the eyesight, especially\r\nthe tall Parsley; for which reason it was forbidden by Chrysippus\r\nand Dionysius.\r\n\r\nThe root acts more readily on the kidneys than other parts of the\r\nherb; therefore its decoction is useful when the urine becomes\r\ndifficult through a chill, or because of gravel. The bruised leaves\r\napplied externally will serve to soften hard breasts early in\r\nlactation, and to resolve the glands in nursing, when they become\r\nknotty and painful, with a threatened abscess. Sheep are fond of\r\nthe plant, which protects them from foot-rot; but it acts as a\r\ndeadly poison to parrots.\r\n\r\nIn France a rustic application to scrofulous swellings is successfully\r\nused, which consists of Parsley and snails pounded together in a\r\nmortar to the thickness of an ointment. This is spread on coarse\r\nlinen and applied freely every day. Also on the Continent, and in\r\nsome parts of England, snails as well as slugs are thought to be\r\nefficacious medicinally in consumption of the lungs, even more so\r\nthan cod-liver oil. The _Helix pomatia_ (or Apple Snail) is specially\r\nused in France, being kept for the purpose in a snaillery, or\r\nboarded-in space of which the floor is covered half-a-foot deep\r\nwith herbs.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were very partial to these Apple Snails, and fattened\r\nthem for the table with bran soaked in wine until the creatures\r\nattained almost a fabulous size. Even in this country shells of Apple\r\nSnails have been [410] found which would hold a pound's worth of\r\nsilver. The large Snail was brought to England in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, to the South downs of Surrey, and Sussex, and to Box Hill\r\nby an Earl of Arundel for his Countess, who had them dressed, and\r\nate them because of her consumptive disease. Likewise in Pliny's\r\ntime Snails beaten up with warm water were commended for the\r\ncure of coughs. Gipsies are great Snail eaters, but they first starve\r\nthe creatures, which are given to devour the deadly Night Shade,\r\nand other poisonous plants. It is certain, that Snails retain the\r\nflavour and odour of the vegetables which they consume.\r\n\r\nThe chalky downs of the South of England are literally covered with\r\nsmall snails, and many persons suppose that the superior flavour of\r\nSouth Down mutton is due to the thousands of these snails which\r\nthe sheep consume together with the pasture on which they feed. In\r\n1854 a medical writer set forth the curative virtues of _Helicin_, a\r\nglutinous constituent principle derived from the Snail, and to be\r\ngiven in broth as a remedy for pulmonary consumption. In France\r\nthe Apple Snail is known as the \"great Escargot\"; and the Snail\r\ngardens in which the gasteropods are fattened, and reared, go by the\r\nname of \"Escargotoires.\" Throughout the winter the creatures\r\nhybernate, shutting themselves up by their operculum whilst lying\r\namong dead leaves, or having fixed themselves by their glutinous\r\nsecretion to a wall or tree. They are only taken for use whilst in this\r\nstate. According to a gipsy, the common English Snail is quite as\r\ngood to be eaten, and quite as beneficial as an Apple Snail, but there\r\nis less of him. In Wiltshire, when collected whilst hybernating,\r\nsnails are soaked in salted water, and then grilled on the bars of the\r\ngrate. About France the Escargots are dried, and prepared as a\r\nlozenge [411] for coughs. Our common garden Snail is the Helix\r\naspersa. On the Continent for many years past the large Apple Snail,\r\ntogether with a reddish-brown slug, the Arion Rufus, has been\r\nemployed in medicine for colds, sore throats, and a tendency to\r\nconsumption of the lungs. These contain \"limacine,\" and eight per\r\ncent. of emollient mucilage, together with \"helicin,\" and uric acid\r\njust under the shell. Many quarts of cooked garden snails are sold\r\nevery week to the labouring classes in Bristol; and an annual Feast\r\nof Snails is held in the neighbourhood of Newcastle. Mrs. Delaney\r\nin 1708, recommended that \"two or three snails should be boiled in\r\nthe barley-water which Mary takes who coughs at night. She must\r\nknow nothing of it; they give no manner of taste. Six or eight boiled\r\nin water, and strained off, and put in a bottle would be a good way\r\nof adding a spoonful of the same to every liquid thing she takes.\r\nThey must be fresh done every two or three days, otherwise they\r\ngrow too thick.\" The _London Gazette_, of March 23rd, 1739, tells\r\nthat Mrs. Joanna Stephens received from the Government five\r\nthousand pounds for revealing the secret of her famous cure against\r\nstone in the bladder, and gravel. This consisted chiefly of eggshells,\r\nand snails, mixed with soap, honey and herbs. It was given in\r\npowders, decoctions, and pills. To help weak eyes in South\r\nHampshire, snails and bread crust are made into a poultice.\r\n\r\nA moderate dose of Parsley oil when taken in health, induces a\r\nsense of warmth at the pit of the stomach, and of general well-being.\r\nThe powdered seeds may be taken in doses of from ten to fifteen\r\ngrains. The bruised leaves have successfully resolved tumours of\r\nhard (scirrhous) cancer when cicuta, and mercury had failed.\r\n\r\nThough used so commonly at table, facts have proved [412] that the\r\nherb, especially when uncooked, may bring on epilepsy in certain\r\nconstitutions, or at least aggravate the fits in those who are subject\r\nto them. Alston says: \"I have observed after eating plentifully of raw\r\nParsley, a fulness of the vessels about the head, and a tenderness of\r\nthe eyes (somewhat inflamed) and face, as if the cravat were too\r\ntight.\"\r\n\r\nThe victors at the old Grecian games were crowned with chaplets of\r\nParsley leaves; and it is more than probable our present custom of\r\nencircling a joint, and garnishing a dish with the herb had its origin\r\nin this practice. The Romans named Parsley _Apium_, either\r\nbecause their bee (_apis_) was specially fond of the herb, or from\r\n_apex_, the head of a conqueror, who was crowned with it. The\r\ntincture has a decided action on the lining membrane of the urinary\r\npassages, and may be given usefully when this is inflamed, or\r\ncongested through catarrh, in doses of from five to ten drops three\r\ntimes in the day with a spoonful or two of cold water.\r\n\r\nWild Parsley is probably identical with our garden herb. It is called\r\nin the Western counties Eltrot, perhaps because associated with the\r\ngambols of the elves.\r\n\r\nThe Fool's Parsley (_oethusa cynapium_) is a very common wayside\r\nweed, and grows wild in our gardens. It differs botanically from all\r\nother parsleys in having no bracts, but three narrow leaves at the\r\nbase of each umbel. This is a more or less poisonous herb,\r\nproducing, when eaten in a harmful quantity, convulsive and\r\nepileptic symptoms; also an inflamed state of the eyelids, just such\r\nas is seen in the scrofulous ophthalmia of children, the condition\r\nbeing accompanied with swelling of glands and eruptions on the\r\nskin. Therefore the tincture which is made (H.) of Fool's Parsley,\r\nwhen given in small doses, and diluted, proves [413] very useful for\r\nsuch ophthalmia, and for obviating the convulsive attacks of young\r\nchildren, especially if connected with derangement of the digestive\r\norgans. Also as a medicine it has done much good in some cases of\r\nmental imbecility. And this tincture will correct the Summer\r\ndiarrhoea of infants, when the stools are watery, greenish, and\r\nwithout smell. From three to ten drops of the tincture diluted to the\r\nthird decimal strength, should be given as a dose, and repeated at\r\nintervals, for the symptoms just recited.\r\n\r\nThis variety is named oethusa, because of its acridity, from the\r\nGreek verb _aitho_ (to burn). \"It has faculties,\" says Gerard,\r\n\"answerable to the common Hemlock,\" the poisonous effects being\r\ninflamed stomach and bowels, giddiness, delirium, convulsions, and\r\ninsensibility. It is called also \"Dog's Parsley\" and \"Kicks.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the Fool's Parsley are glossy beneath, with lanceolate\r\nlobes, whereas the leaflets of other parsleys are woolly below.\r\nGerard calls it Dog's Parsley, and says: \"The whole plant is of a\r\nnaughty smell.\" It contains a peculiar alkaloid \"cynapina.\" The\r\ntincture, third decimal strength, in half-drop doses, with a\r\nteaspoonful of water, will prevent an infant from vomiting the breast\r\nmilk in thick curds.\r\n\r\nAnother variety which grows in chalky districts, the Stone Parsley,\r\n_Sison_, or breakstone, was formerly known as the \"Hone-wort,\"\r\nfrom curing a \"hone,\" or boil, on the cheek. It was believed at one\r\ntime to break a glass goblet or tumbler if rubbed against this article.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSNIP.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Parsnip (_Pastinaca sativa_) grows on the borders of\r\nploughed fields and about hedgerows, being generally hairy, whilst\r\nthe Garden Parsnip is smooth, [414] with taller stems, and leaves of\r\na yellowish-green colour. This cultivated Parsnip has been produced\r\nas a vegetable since Roman times. The roots furnish a good deal of\r\nstarch, and are very nutritious for warming and fattening, but when\r\nlong in the ground they are called in some places \"Madnip,\" and are\r\nsaid to cause insanity.\r\n\r\nChemically, they contain also albumen, sugar, pectose, dextrin, fat,\r\ncellulose, mineral matters, and water, but less sugar than turnips or\r\ncarrots. The volatile oil with which the cultivated root is furnished\r\ncauses it to disagree with persons of delicate stomach; otherwise it\r\nis highly nutritive, and makes a capital supplement to salt fish, in\r\nLent. The seeds of the wild Parsnip (quite a common plant) are\r\naromatic, and are kept by druggists. They have been found curative\r\nin ague, and for intermittent fever, by their volatile oil, or by its\r\nessence given as a medicine. But the seeds of the garden Parsnip,\r\nwhich are easier to get, though not nearly so efficacious, are often\r\nsubstituted at the shops. A decoction of the wild root is good for a\r\nsluggish liver, and in passive jaundice.\r\n\r\nIn Gerard's time, Parsnips were known as Mypes. Marmalade made\r\nwith the roots, and a small quantity of sugar, will improve the\r\nappetite, and serve as a restorative to invalids.\r\n\r\nFrom the mashed roots of the wild Parsnip in some parts of Ireland,\r\nwhen boiled with hops, the peasants brew a beer. In Scotland a good\r\ndish is prepared from Parsnips and potatoes, cooked and beaten\r\ntogether, with butter. Parsnip wine, when properly concocted, is\r\nparticularly exhilarating and refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe Water Parsnip (spelt also in old _Herbals_, Pasnep, and Pastnip,\r\nand called Sium) is an umbelliferous plant, [415] common by the\r\nsides of rivers, lakes, and ditches, with tender leaves which are \"a\r\nsovereign remedy against gravel in the kidney, and stone in the\r\nbladder.\" It is known also as _Apium nodiflorum_, from _apon_,\r\nwater, and contains \"pastinacina,\" in common with the wild Parsnip.\r\nThis is a volatile alkaloid which is not poisonous, and is thought to\r\nbe almost identical with ammonia. The fresh juice, in doses of one,\r\ntwo, or three tablespoonfuls, twice a day, is of curative effect for\r\nscrofulous eruptions on the face, neck, and other parts of children.\r\nDr. Withering tells of a child, aged six years, who was thus cured of\r\nan obstinate and otherwise intractable skin disease. The juice may\r\nbe readily mixed with milk, and does not disagree in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEA AND BEAN.\r\n\r\nTypical of leguminous plants (so called because they furnish\r\nlegumin, or vegetable cheese), whilst furthermore possessing certain\r\nmedicinal properties, the Bean and the Pea have a claim to be\r\nclassed with Herbal Simples.\r\n\r\nThe common Kidney Bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) is a native of the\r\nIndies, but widely cultivated all over Europe, and so well known as\r\nnot to need any detailed description as a plant. Because of the seed's\r\nclose resemblance to the kidney, as well as to the male testis, the\r\nEgyptians made it an object of sacred worship, and would not\r\npartake of it as food. They feared lest by so doing they should eat\r\nwhat was human remaining after death in the Bean, or should\r\nconsume a soul. The Romans celebrated feasts (Lemuria) in honour\r\nof their departed, when Beans were cast into the fire on the altar;\r\nand the people threw black Beans on the graves of the deceased,\r\nbecause the smell was thought disagreeable to any hostile Manes. In\r\nItaly at the present day it is [416] customary to eat Beans, and to\r\ndistribute them among the poor, on the anniversary of a death.\r\nBecause of its decided tendency to cause sleepiness the Jewish High\r\nPriest was forbidden to partake of Beans on the day of Atonement;\r\nand there is now a common saying in Leicestershire that for bad\r\ndreams, or to be driven crazy, one has only to sleep all night in a\r\nBean field. The philosopher, Pythagoras, warned his pupils against\r\neating Beans, the black spot thereon being typical of death; and the\r\ndisciples were ever mindful: \"_Jurare in verba magistri_.\" When\r\nbruised and boiled with garlic, Beans have been known to cure\r\ncoughs which were past other remedies. But the roots of the Kidney\r\nBean have proved themselves dangerously narcotic.\r\n\r\nThe Pea (_Pisum sativum_) is a native of England, first taking its\r\nbotanical name from Pisa, a town of Elis, where Peas grew in\r\nplenty. The English appellation was formerly Peason, or Pease, and\r\nthe plant has been cultivated in this country from time immemorial;\r\nthough not commonly, even in Elizabeth's day, when (as Fuller\r\ninforms us) \"Peas were brought from Holland, and were fit dainties\r\nfor ladies, they came so far, and cost so dear.\" In Germany Peas are\r\nthought good for many complaints, especially for wounds and\r\nbruises; children affected with measles are washed there\r\nsystematically with water in which peas have been boiled. These,\r\ntogether with Beans and lentils, etc., are included under the general\r\nname of pulse, about which Cowper wrote thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Daniel ate pulse by choice: example rare!\r\n    Heaven blest the youth, and made him fresh and fair.\"\r\n\r\nGrey Peas were provided in the pits of the Greek and Roman\r\ntheatres, as we supply oranges and a bill of the Play.\r\n\r\n[417] \"Hot Grey Pease and a suck of bacon\" (tied to a string of\r\nwhich the stall-keeper held the other end), was a popular street cry\r\nin the London of James the First.\r\n\r\nPeas and Beans contain sulphur, and are richer in mineral salts, such\r\nas potash and lime, than wheat, barley, or oats; but their constituents\r\nare apt to provoke indigestion, whilst engendering flatulence\r\nthrough sulphuretted hydrogen. They best suit persons who take\r\nplenty of out-door exercise, but not those of sedentary habits. The\r\nskins of parched Peas remain undigested when eaten cooked, and\r\nare found in the excrements. These leguminous plants are less easily\r\nassimilated than light animal food by persons who are not robust, or\r\nlaboriously employed, though vegetarians assert to the contrary.\r\nLord Tennyson wrote to such effect as the result of his personal\r\nexperience (in his dedication of _Tiresias_ to E. Fitzgerald):--\r\n\r\n    \"Who live on meal, and milk, and grass:--\r\n        And once for ten long weeks I tried\r\n    Your table of Pythagoras,\r\n        And seem'd at first 'a thing enskied'\r\n    (As Shakespeare has it)--airylight,\r\n        To float above the ways of men:\r\n    Then fell from that half spiritual height,\r\n        Until I tasted flesh again.\r\n    One night when earth was winter black,\r\n        And all the heavens were flashed in frost,\r\n    And on me--half asleep--came back\r\n        That wholesome heat the blood had lost.\"\r\n\r\nBut none the less does a simple diet foster spirituality of mind. \"In\r\nmilk\"--says one of the oldest Vedas--\"the finer part of the curds,\r\nwhen shaken, rises and becomes butter. Just so, my child, the finer\r\npart of food rises when it is eaten, and becomes mind.\"\r\n\r\nOld Fuller relates \"In a general dearth all over [418] England\r\n(1555), plenty of Pease did grow on the seashore, near Dunwich\r\n(Suffolk), never set or sown by human industry; which being\r\ngathered in full ripeness much abated the high prices in the markets,\r\nand preserved many hungry families from famishing.\" \"They do not\r\ngrow\", says he, \"among the bare stones, neither did they owe their\r\noriginal to shipwrecks, or Pease cast out of ships.\" The Sea-side Pea\r\n(_pisum maritimum_) is a rare plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACH.\r\n\r\nThe Peach (_Amygdabus Persica_), the apple of Persia, began to be\r\ncultivated in England about 1562, or perhaps before then. Columella\r\ntells of this fatal gift conveyed treacherously to Egypt in the first\r\ncentury:--\r\n\r\n    \"Apples, which most barbarous Persia sent,\r\n    With native poison armed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Peach tree is so well known by its general characteristics as not\r\nto need any particular description. Its young branches, flowers, and\r\nseeds, after maceration in water, yield a volatile oil which is\r\nchemically identical with that of the bitter almond. The flowers are\r\nlaxative, and have been used instead of manna. When distilled, they\r\nfurnish a white liquor which communicates a flavour resembling the\r\nkernels of fruits. An infusion made from one drachm of the dried\r\nflowers, or from half an ounce of the fresh flowers, has a purgative\r\neffect. The fruit is wholesome, and seldom disagrees if eaten when\r\nripe and sound. Its quantity of sugar is only small, but the skin is\r\nindigestible.\r\n\r\nThe leaves possess the power of expelling worms if applied outside\r\na child's belly as a poultice, but in any medicinal form they must be\r\nused with caution, as they contain some of the properties of prussic\r\nacid, as found [419] also in the leaves of the laurel. A syrup\r\nof Peach flowers was formerly a preparation recognised by\r\napothecaries. The leaves infused in white brandy, sweetened with\r\nbarley sugar, make a fine cordial similar to noyeau. Soyer says the\r\nold Romans gave as much for their peaches as eighteen or nineteen\r\nshillings each.\r\n\r\nPeach pie, owing to the abundance of the fruit, is as common fare in\r\nan American farm-house, as apple pie in an English homestead. Our\r\nEnglish King John died at Swinestead Abbey from a surfeit of\r\npeaches, and new ale.\r\n\r\nA tincture made from the flowers will allay the pain of colic caused\r\nby gravel; but the kernels of the fruit, which yield an oil identical\r\nwith that of bitter almonds, have produced poisonous effects with\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nGerard teaches \"that a syrup or strong infusion of Peach flowers\r\ndoth singularly well purge the belly, and yet without grief or\r\ntrouble.\" Two tablespoonfuls of the infusion for a dose.\r\n\r\nIn Sicily there is a belief that anyone afflicted with goitre, who eats\r\na Peach on the night of St. John, or the Ascension, will be cured,\r\nprovided only that the Peach tree dies at the same time. In Italy\r\nPeach leaves are applied to a wart, and then buried, so that they and\r\nthe wart may perish simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThackeray one day at dessert was taken to task by his colleague on\r\nthe _Punch_ staff, Angus B. Reach, whom he addressed as Mr.\r\nReach, instead of as Mr. (_Scottice_) Reach. With ready\r\npromptitude, Thackeray replied: \"Be good enough Mr. Re-ack to\r\npass me a pe-ack.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEAR.\r\n\r\nThe Pear, also called Pyrrie, belongs to the same natural order of\r\nplants (the _Rosacoe_) as the Apple. It is [420] sometimes called\r\nthe Pyerie, and when wild is so hard and austere as to bear the name\r\nof Choke-pear. It grows wild in Britain, and abundantly in France\r\nand Germany. The Barland Pear, which was chiefly cultivated in the\r\nseventeenth century, still retains its health and vigour, \"the\r\nidentical trees in Herefordshire which then supplied excellent\r\nliquor, continuing to do so in this, the nineteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nThis fruit caused the death of Drusus, a son of the Roman Emperor\r\nClaudius, who caught in his mouth a Pear thrown into the air, and\r\nby mischance attempted to swallow it, but the Pear was so\r\nextremely hard that it stuck in his throat, and choked him.\r\n\r\nPears gathered from gardens near old monasteries were formerly\r\nheld in the highest repute for flavour, and it was noted that the trees\r\nwhich bore them continued fruitful for a great number of years. The\r\nsecret cause seems to have been, not the holy water with which the\r\ntrees were formally christened, but the fact that the sagacious monks\r\nhad planted them upon a layer of stones so as to prevent the roots\r\nfrom penetrating deep into the ground, and so as thus to ensure their\r\nproper drainage.\r\n\r\nThe cellular tissue of which a Pear is composed differs from that of\r\nthe apple in containing minute stony concretions which make it, in\r\nmany varieties of the fruit, bite short and crisp; and its specific\r\ngravity is therefore greater than that of the apple, so much so that by\r\ntaking a cube of each of equal size, that of the Pear will sink when\r\nthrown into a vessel of water, while that of the apple will float. The\r\nwood of the wild Pear is strong, and readily stained black, so as to\r\nlook like ebony. It is much employed by wood-engravers. Gerard\r\nsays \"it serveth to be cut [421] up into many kinds of moulds; not\r\nonly such fruits as those seen in my Herbal are made of, but also\r\nmany sorts of pretty toies for coifes, breast plates, and such like;\r\nused among our English gentlewomen.\"\r\n\r\nThe good old black Pear of Worcester is represented in the civic\r\narms, or rather in the second of the two shields belonging to the\r\nfaithful city; Argent, a fesse between three Pears, sable. The date of\r\nthis shield coincides with that of the visit of Queen Elizabeth to\r\nWorcester.\r\n\r\nVirgil names three kinds of Pears which he received as a present\r\nfrom Cato:--\r\n\r\n        \"Nec surculus idem,\r\n    Crustaneis, Syriisque pyris, gravibusque volemis.\"\r\n\r\nThe two first of these were Bergamots and Pounder Pears, whilst the\r\nlast-named was called _a volemus_, because large enough to fill the\r\nhollow of the hand, (_vola_).\r\n\r\nMural paintings which have been disclosed at Pompeii represent the\r\nPear tree and its fruit. In Pliny's time there were \"proud\" Pears, so\r\ncalled because they ripened early, and would not keep; and \"winter\"\r\npears for baking, etc. Again, in the time of Henry the Eighth, a\r\n\"warden\" Pear, so named (Anglo-Saxon \"wearden\") from its\r\nproperty of long keeping, was commonly cultivated.\r\n\r\n    \"Her cheek was like the Catherine Pear,\r\n    The side that's next the sun,\"\r\n\r\nsays one of our old poets concerning a small fruit seen often\r\nnow-a-days in our London streets, handsome, but hard, and\r\nill-flavoured.\r\n\r\nThe special taste of Pears is chemically due for the most part to their\r\ncontaining amylacetate; and a [422] solution of this substance in\r\nspirit is artificially prepared for making essence of Jargonelle Pears,\r\nas used for flavouring Pear drops and other sweetmeats. The acetate\r\namyl is a compound ether got from vinegar and potato oil. Pears\r\ncontain also malic acid, pectose, gum, sugar, and albumen, with\r\nmineral matter, cellulose, and water. Gerard says wine made of\r\nthe juice of Pears, called in English, Perry, \"purgeth those that\r\nare not accustomed to drinke thereof, especially when it is new;\r\nnotwithstanding, it is as wholesome a drink (being taken in small\r\nquantity) as wine; it comforteth and warmeth the stomacke, and\r\ncauseth good digestion.\"\r\n\r\nPerry contains about one per cent. alcohol over cider, and a slightly\r\nlarger proportion of malic acid, so that it is rather more stimulating,\r\nand somewhat better calculated to produce the healthful effects of\r\nvegetable acids in the economy. How eminently beneficial fruits of\r\nsuch sort are when ripe and sound, even to persons out of health, is\r\nbut little understood, though happily the British public is growing\r\nwiser to-day in this respect. For instance, it has been lately\r\ndiscovered that there is present in the juice of the Pine-apple a\r\nvegetable digestive ferment, which, in its action, imitates almost\r\nidentically the gastric juices of the stomach; and a demand for\r\nBananas is developing rapidly in London since their wholesome\r\nvirtues have become generally recognised. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat the epidemics of yellow fever in New Orleans have declined in\r\nvirulence almost incredibly since the Banana began to be eaten there\r\nin considerable quantities. If a paste of its ripe pulp dried in the\r\nsun be made with spice, and sugar, this will keep well for years.\r\n\r\nAt Godstone, as is related in Bray's Survey, the water [423] from a\r\nwell sunk close to a wild Pear tree (which bore fruit as hard as iron)\r\nproved so curative of gout, that large quantities of it were sent to\r\nLondon and sold there at the rate of sixpence a quart. Pears were\r\ndeemed by the Romans an antidote to poisonous fungi; and for this\r\nreason, which subsequent experience has confirmed, Perry is still\r\nreckoned the best thing to be taken after eating freely of\r\nmushrooms, as also Pear stalks cooked therewith.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Continental saying: _Pome, pere, ed noce guastano\r\nla voce_--\"Apples, pears, and nuts spoil the voice,\" And an ancient\r\nrhymed distich says:--\r\n\r\n    \"For the cough take Judas eare,\r\n    With the parynge of a pear;\r\n    And drynke them without feare,\r\n        If ye will have remedy.\"\r\n\r\nAll Pears are cold, and have a binding quality, with an earthy\r\nsubstance in their composition.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Pears dried in the oven, and kept without\r\nsyrup, will remain quite good, and eatable for a year or more.\r\n\r\nMost Pears depend on birds for the dispersion of their seeds, but one\r\nstriking variety prefers to attract bees, and the larger insects for\r\ncross-fertilization, and it has therefore assumed brilliant crimson\r\npetals of a broadly expanded sort, instead of bearing a succulent\r\nedible fruit, This is the highly ornamental _Pyrus Japonica_, which\r\nmay so often be seen trained on the sunny walls of cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPELLITORY.\r\n\r\nA plant belonging to the order of Nettles, the Pellitory of the Wall,\r\nor Paritory--_Parietaria_, from the Latin _parietes_, walls--is a\r\nfavourite Herbal Simple in many [424] rural districts. It grows\r\ncommonly on dry walls, and is in flower all the summer. The leaves\r\nare narrow, hairy, and reddish; the stems are brittle, and the small\r\nblossoms hairy, in clusters. Their filaments are so elastic that if\r\ntouched before the flower has expanded, they suddenly spring from\r\ntheir in curved position, and scatter the pollen broadcast.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the plant is a popular medicine to stimulate the\r\nkidneys, and promote a large flow of watery urine. The juice of the\r\nherb acts in the same way when made into a thin syrup with sugar,\r\nand given in doses of two tablespoonfuls three times in the day.\r\nDropsical effusions caused by an obstructed liver, or by a weak\r\ndilated heart, may be thus carried off with marked relief. The\r\ndecoction of _Parietaria_, says Gerard, \"helpeth such as are troubled\r\nwith an old cough.\" All parts of the plant contain nitre abundantly.\r\nThe leaves may be usefully applied as poultices.\r\n\r\nBut another Pellitory, which is more widely used because of its\r\npungent efficacy in relieving toothache, and in provoking a free\r\nflow of saliva, is a distinct plant, the _Pyrethrum_, or Spanish\r\nChamomile of the shops, and not a native of Great Britain, though\r\nsometimes cultivated in our gardens. The title \"Purethron\" is from\r\n_pur_, fire, because of its burning ardent taste. Its root is\r\nscentless, but when chewed causes a pricking sensation (with heat,\r\nand some numbness) in the mouth and tongue. Then an abundant flow of\r\nsaliva, and of mucus within the cheeks quickly ensues. These effects\r\nare due to \"pyrethrin\" contained in the plant, which is an acid fixed\r\nresin; also there are present a second resin, and a yellow, acrid oil,\r\nwhilst the root contains inulin, tannin, and other substances. When\r\nsliced and applied to the skin it induces heat, [425] tingling, and\r\nredness. A patient seeking relief from rheumatic or neuralgic\r\naffections of the head and face, or for palsy of the tongue, should\r\nchew the root of this _Pyrethrum_ for several minutes.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pelleter of Spain\" (_Pyrethrum Anacyclus_), was so styled,\r\nnot because of being brought from Spain; but because it is grown\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nA gargle of _Pyrethrum_ infusion is prescribed for relaxed uvula,\r\nand for a partial paralysis of the tongue and lips. The tincture made\r\nfrom the dried root may be most helpfully applied on cotton wool to\r\nthe interior of a decayed tooth which is aching, or the milder\r\ntincture of the wall Pellitory may be employed for the same\r\npurpose. To make a gargle, two or three teaspoonfuls of the\r\ntincture of _Pyrethrum_, which can be had from any druggist,\r\nshould be mixed with a pint of cold water, and sweetened with\r\nhoney, if desired. The powdered root forms a good snuff to cure\r\nchronic catarrh of the head and nostrils, and to clear the brain by\r\nexciting a free flow of nasal mucus and tears--_Purgatur cerebrum\r\nmansa radice Pyrethri_.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, as a quaint but effective remedy for carious toothache,\r\nmay be mentioned the common lady bird insect, Coccinella, which\r\nwhen captured secretes from its legs a yellow acrid fluid having a\r\ndisagreeable odour. This fluid will serve to ease the most violent\r\ntoothache, if the creature be placed alive in the cavity of the hollow\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nGerard says this _Pyrethrurn_ (Pellitory of Spain, or Pelletor) \"is\r\nmost singular for the surgeons of the hospitals to put into their\r\nunctions _contra Neapolitanum morbum_, and such other diseases\r\nthat are cousin germanes thereunto.\" The _Parietaria_, or Pellitory\r\nof the wall, is named Lichwort, from growing on stones.\r\n\r\n[426] Sir William Roberts, of Manchester, has advised jujubes,\r\nmade of gum arabic and pyrethrum, to be slowly masticated by\r\npersons who suffer from acid fermentation in the stomach, a copious\r\nflow of alkaline saliva being stimulated thereby in the mouth, which\r\nis repeatedly swallowed during the sucking of one or more of the\r\njujubes, and which serves to neutralise the acid generated within the\r\nstomach. Distressing heartburn is thus effectively relieved without\r\ntaking injurious alkalies, such as potash and soda.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENNYROYAL, _see_ MINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIWINKLE.\r\n\r\nThere are two British Periwinkles growing wild; the one _Vinca\r\nmajor_, or greater, a doubtful native, and found only in the\r\nneighbourhood of dwelling-houses; the other _Vinca minor_ lesser,\r\nabounding in English woods, particularly in the Western counties,\r\nand often entirely covering the ground with its prostrate evergreen\r\nleaves. The common name of each is derived from _vincio_, to bind,\r\nas it were by its stems resembling cord; or because bound in olden\r\ntimes into festive garlands and funeral chaplets. Their title used also\r\nto be Pervinca, and Pervinkle, Pervenkle, and Pucellage (or virgin\r\nflower).\r\n\r\nThis generic name has been derived either from _pervincire_, to\r\nbind closely, or from _pervincere_, to overcome. Lord Bacon\r\nobserves that it was common in his time for persons to wear bands\r\nof green Periwinkle about the calf of the leg to prevent cramp.\r\nNow-a-days we use for the same purpose a garter of small new corks\r\nstrung on worsted. In Germany this plant is the emblem of\r\nimmortality. It bears the name [427] \"Pennywinkles\" in Hampshire,\r\nprobably by an inland confusion with the shell fish \"winkles.\"\r\n\r\nEach of the two kinds possesses acrid astringent properties, but the\r\nlesser Periwinkle, _Vinca minor_ or Winter-green, is the Herbal\r\nSimple best known of the pair, for its medicinal virtues in domestic\r\nuse. The Periwinkle order is called _Apocynaceoe_, from the Greek\r\n_apo_, against, and _kunos_, a dog; or dog's bane.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the greater Periwinkle are gently purgative, but lose\r\ntheir effect by drying. If gathered in the Spring, and made into a\r\nsyrup, they will impart all their virtues, and this is excellent to\r\nkeep the bowels of children gently open, as well as to overcome\r\nhabitual constipation in grown persons. But the leaves are astringent,\r\ncontracting and strengthening the genitals if applied thereto either as\r\na decoction, or as the bruised leaves themselves. An infusion of the\r\ngreater Periwinkle, one part of the fresh plant to ten of water, may\r\nbe used for staying female fluxes, by giving a wine-glassful thereof\r\nwhen cool, frequently; or of the liquid extract, half a teaspoonful for\r\na dose in water. On account of its striking colour, and its use for\r\nmagical purposes, the plant, when in bloom, has been named the\r\nSorcerer's Violet, and in some parts of Devon the flowers are known\r\nas Cut Finger or Blue Buttons. The Italians use it in making\r\ngarlands for their dead infants, and so call it Death's flower.\r\n\r\nSimon Fraser, whose father was a faithful adherent of Sir William\r\nWallace, when on his way to be executed (in 1306) was crowned in\r\nmockery with the Periwinkle, as he passed through the City\r\nof London, with his legs tied under the horse's belly. In\r\nGloucestershire, the flowers of the greater Periwinkle are called\r\nCockles.\r\n\r\nThe lesser Periwinkle is perennial, and is sometimes [428]\r\ncultivated in gardens, where it has acquired variegated leaves. It has\r\nno odour, but gives a bitterish taste which lasts in the mouth. Its\r\nleaves are strongly astringent, and therefore very useful to be\r\napplied for staying bleedings. If bruised and put into the nostrils,\r\nthey will arrest fluxes from the nose, and a decoction made from\r\nthem is of service for the diarrhoea of a weak subject, as well as for\r\nchronic looseness of the bowels; likewise for bleeding piles, by\r\nbeing applied externally, and by being taken internally. Again, the\r\ndecoction makes a capital gargle for relaxed sore throat, and for\r\nsponginess of the mouth, of the tonsils, and the gums.\r\n\r\nThis plant was also a noted Simple for increasing the milk of wet\r\nnurses, and was advised for such purpose by physicians of repute.\r\nCulpeper gravely says: \"The leaves of the lesser Periwinkle, if eaten\r\nby man and wife together, will cause love between them.\"\r\n\r\nA tincture is made (H.) from the said plant, the _Vinca minor_, with\r\nspirit of wine. It is given medicinally for the milk-crust of infants,\r\nas well as for internal haemorrhages, the dose being from two to ten\r\ndrops three or four times in the day, with a spoonful of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMPERNEL.\r\n\r\nThe \"Poor Man's Weather Glass\" or \"Shepherd's Dial,\" is a very\r\nwell-known and favourite little flower, of brilliant scarlet hue,\r\nexpanding only in bright weather, and closing its petals at two\r\no'clock in the day. It occurs quite commonly in gardens and open\r\nfields, being the scarlet Pimpernel, or _Anagallis arvensis_, and\r\nbelonging to the Primrose tribe of plants. Old authors called it\r\nBurnet; which is quite a distinct herb, cultivated now for kitchen\r\nuse, the _Pimpinella Saxifraga_, of so cheery and exhilarating a\r\nquality, and so generally commended, [429] that its excellence has\r\npassed into a proverb, \"_l'insolata non buon, ne betta ove non e\r\nPimpinella_.\" But this Burnet Pimpinella is of a different\r\n(Umbelliferous) order, though similarly styled because its leaves are\r\nlikewise bipennate.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet Pimpernel is named _Anagallis_, from the Greek\r\n_anagelao_, to laugh; either because, as Pliny says, the plant\r\nremoves obstructions of the liver, and spleen, which would\r\nengender sadness, or because of the graceful beauty of its flowers:--\r\n\r\n    \"No ear hath heard, no tongue can tell\r\n    The virtues of the Pimpernell.\"\r\n\r\nThe little plant has no odour, but possesses a bitter taste, which is\r\nrather astringent. Doctors used to consider the herb remedial in\r\nmelancholy, and in the allied forms of mental disease, the decoction,\r\nor a tincture being employed. It was also prescribed for\r\nhydrophobia, and linen cloths saturated with a decoction were kept\r\napplied to the bitten part.\r\n\r\nNarcotic effects were certainly produced in animals by giving\r\nconsiderable doses of an extract made from the herb. The flowers\r\nhave been found useful in epilepsy, twenty grains dried being given\r\nfour times a day. A medicinal tincture (H.) is prepared with spirit of\r\nwine. It is of approved utility for irritability of the main urinary\r\npassage, with genital congestion, erotism, and dragging of the loins,\r\nthis tincture being then ordered of the third decimal strength, in\r\ndoses of from five to ten drops every three or four hours, with a\r\nspoonful of water.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the plant is held in esteem by countryfolk as\r\nchecking pulmonary consumption in its early stages. Hill says there\r\nare many authenticated cases of this dire disease being absolutely\r\ncured by the herb, [430] The infusion is best made by pouring\r\nboiling water on the fresh plant. It contains \"saponin,\" such as the\r\nSoapwort also specially furnishes.\r\n\r\nIn France the Pimpernel (_Anagallis_) is thought to be a noxious\r\nplant of drastic narcotico-acrid properties, and called _Mouron--qui\r\ntue les petits oiseaux, et est un violent drastique pour l'homme, et\r\nles grands animaux; a dose tres elevee le mouron peut meme leur\r\ndonner la mort_. In California a fluid extract of the herb is given for\r\nrheumatism, in doses of one teaspoonful with water three times a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe _Burnet Pimpinella_ is more correctly the Burnet Saxifrage,\r\ngetting its first name because the leaves are brown, and the second\r\nbecause supposed to break up stone in the bladder. It grows\r\nabundantly in our dry chalky pastures, bearing terminal umbels of\r\nwhite flowers. It contains an essential oil and a bitter resin, which\r\nare useful as warmly carminative to relieve flatulent indigestion, and\r\nto promote the monthly flow in women. An infusion of the herb is\r\nmade, and given in two tablespoonfuls for a dose. Cows which feed\r\non this plant have their flow of milk increased thereby. Small\r\nbunches of the leaves and shoots when tied together and suspended\r\nin a cask of beer impart to it an agreeable aromatic flavour, and are\r\nthought to correct tart, or spoiled wines. The root, when fresh,\r\nhas a hot pungent bitterish taste, and may be usefully chewed for\r\ntooth-ache, or to obviate paralysis of the tongue. In Germany a variety\r\nof this Burnet yields a blue essential oil which is used for colouring\r\nbrandy. Again the herb is allied to the Anise (_Pimpinella\r\nAnisum_). The term Burnet was formerly applied to a brown cloth.\r\nSmaller than this Common Burnet is the Salad Burnet, _Poterium\r\nsanguisorba, quod sanguineos fluxus sistat_, a useful [431] styptic,\r\nwhich is also cordial, and promotes perspiration. It has the smell of\r\ncucumber, and is, therefore, an ingredient of the salad bowl, or often\r\nput into a cool tankard, whereto, says Gerard, \"it gives a grace in the\r\ndrynkynge.\" Another larger sort of the Burnet Pimpinella\r\n(_Magna_), which has broad upper leaves less divided, grows in our\r\nwoods and shady places.\r\n\r\nA bright blue variety of the true Scarlet Pimpernel (_Anagallis_) is\r\nless frequent, and is thought by many to be a distinct species.\r\nGerard says, \"the Pimpernel with the blue flower helpeth the\r\nfundament that is fallen down: and, contrariwise, red Pimpernel\r\nbeing applied bringeth it down.\"\r\n\r\nThe Water Pimpernel (_Anagallis aquatica_) is more commonly\r\nknown as Brooklime, or Beccabunga, and belongs to a different\r\norder of plants, the _Scrophulariaceoe_ (healers of scrofula).\r\n\r\nIt grows quite commonly in brooks and ditches, as a succulent plant\r\nwith smooth leaves, and small flowers of bright blue, being found in\r\nsituations favourable to the growth of the watercress. It is the _brok\r\nlempe_ of old writers, _Veronica beccabunga_, the syllable _bec_\r\nsignifying a beck or brook; or perhaps the whole title comes from\r\nthe Flemish _beck pungen_, mouth-smart, in allusion to the pungent\r\ntaste of the plant.\r\n\r\n\"It is eaten,\" says Gerard, \"in salads, as watercresses are, and is\r\ngood against that _malum_ of such as dwell near the German seas,\r\nwhich we term the scurvie, or skirby, being used after the same\r\nmanner that watercress and scurvy-grass is used, yet is it not of so\r\ngreat operation and virtue.\" The leaves and stem are slightly acid\r\nand astringent, with a somewhat bitter taste, and frequently\r\nthe former are mixed by sellers of water-cresses with their\r\nstock-in-trade.\r\n\r\n[432] A full dose of the juice of fresh Brooklime is an easy purge;\r\nand the plant has always been a popular Simple for scrofulous\r\naffections, especially of the skin. Chemically, this Water Pimpernel\r\ncontains some tannin, and a special bitter principle; whilst, in\r\ncommon with most of the Cruciferous plants, it is endowed with a\r\npungent volatile oil, and some sulphur. The bruised plant has been\r\napplied externally for healing ulcers, burns, whitlows, and for the\r\nmitigation of swollen piles.\r\n\r\nThe Bog Pimpernel (_Anagallis tenella_), is common in boggy\r\nground, having erect rose-coloured leaves larger than those of the\r\nPoor Man's Weather Glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK.\r\n\r\nThe Clove Pink, or Carnation of our gardens, though found\r\napparently wild on old castle walls in England, is a naturalised\r\nflower in this country. It is, botanically, the _Dianthus\r\nCaryophyllus_, being so named as _anthos_, the flower, _dios_, of\r\nJupiter: whilst redolent of _Caryophylli_, Cloves. The term Carnation\r\nhas been assigned to the Pink, either because the blossom has the\r\ncolour, _carnis_, of flesh: or, as more correctly spelt by our older\r\nwriters, Coronation, from the flowers being employed in making\r\nchaplets, _coronoe_. Thus Spenser says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Bring Coronations, and Sops in Wine,\r\n    Worn of paramours.\"--_Shepherd's Kalendar_.\r\n\r\nThis second title, Sops in Wine, was given to the plant because the\r\nflowers were infused in wine for the sake of their spicy flavour;\r\nespecially in that presented to brides after the marriage ceremony.\r\nFurther, this Pink is the Clove Gilly (or _July_) flower, and gives its\r\nspecific name to the natural order _Caryophyllaceoe_. The word\r\nPink is a corruption of the Greek Pentecost [433] (fiftieth), which\r\nhas now come to signify a festival of the Church. In former days the\r\nblossoms were commended as highly cordial: their odour is sweet\r\nand aromatic, so that an agreeable syrup may be made therefrom.\r\nThe dried petals, if powdered, and kept in a stoppered bottle, are of\r\nservice against heartburn and flatulence, being given in a dose of\r\nfrom twenty to sixty grains. Gerard says, \"a conserve made of the\r\nflowers with sugar is exceeding cordiall, and wonderfully above\r\nmeasure doth comfort the heart, being eaten now and then. A water\r\ndistilled from Pinks has been commended as excellent for curing\r\nepilepsy, and if a conserve be composed of them, this is the life and\r\ndelight of the human race.\" The flower was at one time called\r\n_ocellus_, from the eye-shaped markings of its corolla. It is nervine\r\nand antispasmodic. By a mistake Turner designated the Pink\r\nIncarnation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAIN.\r\n\r\nThe Plantains (_Plantaginacecoe_), from _planta_, the sole of the\r\nfoot, are humble plants, well known as weeds in fields and by\r\nroadsides, having ribbed leaves and spikes of flowers conspicuous\r\nby their long stamens. As Herbal Simples, the Greater Plantain, the\r\nRibwort Plantain, and the Water Plantain, are to be specially\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Plantain of the waysides affords spikes of seeds which\r\nare a favourite food of Canaries, and which, in common with the\r\nseeds of other sorts, yield a tasteless mucilage, answering well as a\r\nsubstitute for linseed. The leaves of the Plantains have a bitter\r\ntaste, and are somewhat astringent.\r\n\r\nThe generic name _Plantago_ is probably derived from the Latin\r\n_planta_, the sole of the foot, in allusion to the [434] broad, flat\r\nleaves lying close on the ground, and ago, the old synonym for wort,\r\na cultivated plant.\r\n\r\nThis greater Plantain (_Plantago major_) is also termed Waybred,\r\nWaybread, or Waybroad, \"spread on the way,\" and has followed our\r\ncolonists to all parts of the globe, being therefore styled \"The\r\nEnglishman's Foot\" and \"Whiteman's Foot.\" The shape of the leaf in\r\nthe larger species resembles a footprint. The root has a sweet taste,\r\nand gives the saliva a reddish tinge.\r\n\r\nDioscorides advised that it should be applied externally for sores of\r\nevery kind, and taken internally against haemorrhages. In the\r\n_Romeo and Juliet_ of Shakespeare, Romeo says, \"Your Plantain\r\nleaf is excellent for broken shin.\" Country persons apply these\r\nleaves to open sores and wounds, or make a poultice of them, or\r\ngive fomentations with a hot decoction of the same, or prepare a\r\ngargle from the decoction when cold.\r\n\r\nThe expressed juice of the greater Plantain has proved of curative\r\neffect in tubercular consumption, with spitting of blood. This herb is\r\nsaid to furnish a cure for the venomous bite of the rattlesnake, as\r\ndiscovered by the negro Caesar in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt is of excellent curative use against the intermittent fevers of\r\nSpring, but for counteracting autumnal (septic) fevers it is of no\r\navail.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the greater Plantain as an application to wounds and\r\nsores were known of old. It possesses a widespread repute in\r\nSwitzerland as a local remedy for toothache, the root or leaves being\r\napplied against the ear of the affected side. Those persons who\r\nproved the plant by taking it experimentally in various doses,\r\nsuffered much pain in the teeth and jaws. Accordingly, Dr. Hale\r\nfound that, of all his remedies [435] for the toothache, none could\r\ncompare with the _Plantago major_.\r\n\r\nIt gives rise to an active flow of urine when taken in considerable\r\ndoses, and when administered in small doses of the diluted tincture,\r\nit has proved curative of bed wetting in young children. Gerard tells\r\nthat \"Plantain leaves stuped stayeth the inordinate flux of the terms,\r\nthough it hath continued many years.\" For inflamed protruding\r\npiles, a broad-leaved Plantain reduced to a pulp, and kept bound to\r\nthe parts by a compress, will give sure and speedy relief.\r\nHighlanders call it _Slanlus_, the healing plant.\r\n\r\nThe Ribwort Plantain (_Plantago lanceolata_), Ribgrass, Soldiers, or\r\nCocks and Hens, is named from the strong parallel veins in its\r\nleaves. The flower stalks are termed Kemps, from _campa_, a\r\nwarrior. The leaves are astringent, and useful for healing sores when\r\napplied thereto, and for dressing wounds. This Plantain is also\r\nnamed Hardheads, Fighting Cocks, and in Germany, Devil's Head,\r\nbeing used in divination. Children challenge one another to a game\r\nof striking off the heads.\r\n\r\nToads are thought to cure themselves of their ailments by eating its\r\nleaves. In Sussex, it is known as Lamb's Tongue. The powdered root\r\nof the Ribwort Plantain is of use for curing vernal ague, a\r\ndessertspoonful being given for a dose, two or three times in a day.\r\n\r\nThe Water Plantain (_Alisma Plantago_), belonging to a different\r\nnatural order, is common on the margins of our rivers and ditches,\r\ngetting its name from the Celtic _alos_, water, and being called also\r\nthe greater Thrumwort, from thrum, the warp end of a weaver's web.\r\nThe root and leaves contain an acrid juice, dispersed by heat, which\r\nis of service for irritability of the bladder. After [436] the root is\r\nboiled so as to dissipate this medicinal juice it makes an edible\r\nstarchy vegetable.\r\n\r\nThis plant is commonly classed with the Plantains because its leaves\r\nresemble theirs; but in general characteristics and qualities it more\r\nproperly belongs to the _Ranunculaceoe_.\r\n\r\nIts fresh leaves applied to the skin will raise a blister, and may be\r\nused for such a purpose, especially to relieve the swollen legs of\r\ndropsical subjects when the vesicles should be punctured and the\r\nserum drawn off. They contain a pungent butyraceous volatile oil.\r\nThe seeds dislodged from the dry, ripe plant, by striking it smartly\r\non a table, are good in decoction against bleedings, and are\r\nemployed by country people for curing piles. About the Russian\r\nEmpire the Water Plantain is still regarded as efficacious against\r\nhydrophobia. Dr. George Johnston says: \"In the Government of\r\nIsola it has never failed of a cure for the last twenty-five years.\"\r\nReduced to powder it is spread over bread and butter, and is eaten.\r\nLikewise, cures of rabid dogs by this plant are reported; and in\r\nAmerica it is renowned as a remedy against the bite of the\r\nrattlesnake. The tubers contain a nutritious substance, and are eaten\r\nby the Tartars.\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of this \"Water Plantain\" a Teesdale proverb says: \"He's\r\nnar a good weaver that leaves lang _thrums_.\"\r\n\r\nThe small seeds of a Plantain grass which grows commonly in\r\nSouthern Europe, the Fleawort, or _Plantago Psyllium_, have been\r\nknown from time immemorial as an easy and popular aperient. In\r\nFrance these Psyllium seeds, given in a dessertspoonful dose, are\r\nwidely prescribed as a laxative in lieu of mineral aperient waters,\r\nor the morning Seidlitz. They act after being soaked for some hours\r\nin cold water, by their mucilage, and [437] when swallowed, by\r\nvirtue of a laxative oil set free within the intestines. The grass is\r\nwell known in some parts as \"Clammy Plantain,\" and it has leafless\r\nheads with toothed leaves. These seeds are dispensed by the London\r\ndruggists who supply French medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPPY.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet Poppy of our cornfields (_Papaver Rhoeas_) is one of\r\nthe most brilliant and familiar of English wild flowers, being\r\nstrikingly conspicuous as a weed by its blossoms rich in scarlet\r\npetals, which are black at the base. The title _Papaver_ has been\r\nderived from pap, a soft food given to young infants, in which it was\r\nat one time customary to boil Poppy seeds for the purpose of\r\ninducing sleep. Provincially this plant bears the titles of \"Cop Rose\"\r\n(from its rose-like flowers, and the button-like form of its cop, or\r\ncapsule) and \"Canker Rose,\" from its detriment to wheat crops.\r\n\r\nThe generic term _Rhoeas_ comes from _reo_, to fall, because the\r\nscarlet petals have so fragile a hold on their receptacles; and the\r\nplant has been endowed with the sobriquet, \"John Silver Pin, fair\r\nwithout and foul within.\" In the Eastern counties of England any\r\narticle of finery brought out only occasionally, and worn with\r\nostentation by a person otherwise a slattern, is called \"Joan Silver\r\nPin.\" After this sense the appellation has been applied to the Scarlet\r\nPoppy. Its showy flower is so attractive to the eye, whilst its inner\r\njuice is noxious, and stains the hands of those who thoughtlessly\r\ncrush it with their fingers.\r\n\r\n    \"And Poppies a sanguine mantle spread,\r\n    For the blood of the dragon St. Margaret shed.\"\r\n\r\nRobert Turner naively says, \"The Red Poppy Flower (_Papaver\r\nerraticum_) resembleth at its bottom the settling [438] of the 'Blood\r\nin pleurisie'\"; and, he adds, \"how excellent is that flower in diseases\r\nof the pleurisie with similar surfeits hath been sufficiently\r\nexperienced.\"\r\n\r\nIt is further called Blindy Buff, Blind Eyes, Headwarke, and\r\nHeadache, from the stupefying effects of smelling it. Apothecaries\r\nmake a syrup of a splendid deep colour from its vividly red petals;\r\nbut this does not exercise any soporific action like that concocted\r\nfrom the white Poppy, which is a sort of modified opiate, suitable\r\nfor infants under certain conditions, when sanctioned by a doctor.\r\nOtherwise, all sedatives of a narcotic sort are to be strongly\r\ncondemned for use by mothers, or nurses:--\r\n\r\n    \"But a child that bids the world 'Good-night'\r\n    In downright earnest, and cuts it quite,\r\n        (A cherub no art can copy),\r\n    'Tis a perfect picture to see him lie,\r\n    As if he had supped on dormouse pie,\r\n    An ancient classical dish, by-the-bye,\r\n    With a sauce of syrup of Poppy.\"\r\n\r\nPetronius, in the time of Nero, A.D. 80, \"delivered an odd receipt\r\nfor dressing dormouse sausages, and serving them up with Poppies\r\nand honey, which must have been a very soporiferous dainty, and as\r\ngood as owl pye to such as want a nap after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe white Poppy is specially cultivated in Britain for the sake of its\r\nseed capsules, which possess attributes similar to opium,\r\nbut of a weaker strength. These capsules are commonly known as\r\nPoppyheads, obtained from the druggist for use in domestic\r\nfomentations to allay pain. Also from the capsules, without their\r\nseeds, is made the customary syrup of White Poppies, which is so\r\nfamiliar as a sedative for childhood; but it should be always\r\nremembered that infants of tender years are highly susceptible to the\r\ninfluence even of this mild form [439] of opium. The true gum\r\nopium, and laudanum, which is its tincture, are derived from Eastern\r\nPoppies (_Papaver somniferum_) by incisions made in the capsules\r\nat a proper season of the year. The cultivated Poppy of the garden\r\nwill afford English opium in a like manner, but it is seldom used for\r\nthis purpose. A milky juice exudes when the capsules of these\r\ncultivated flowers are cut, or bruised. They are familiar to most\r\nchildren as drumsticks, plucked in the garden after the gaudy petals\r\nof the flowers have fallen off. The leaves and stems likewise afford\r\nsome of the same juice, which, when inspissated, is known as\r\nEnglish opium. The seeds of the white Poppy yield by expression a\r\nbland nutritive oil, which may be substituted for that of olives, or\r\nsweet almonds, in cooking, and for similar uses. Dried Poppy-heads,\r\nformerly in constant request for making hot soothing stupes, or for\r\napplication directly to a part in pain, are now superseded for the\r\nmost part by the many modern liquid preparations of opium handy\r\nfor the purpose, to be mixed with hot water, or applied in poultices.\r\n\r\nFor outward use laudanum may be safely added to stupes, hot or\r\ncold, a teaspoonful being usually sufficient for the purpose, or\r\nperhaps two, if the pain is severe; and powdered opium may be\r\nincorporated with one or another ointment for a similar object. If a\r\ndecoction of Poppy capsules is still preferred, it should be made by\r\nadding to a quarter-of-a-pound of white Poppy heads (free from\r\nseeds, and broken up in a mortar) three pints of boiling water; then\r\nboil for ten or fifteen minutes, and strain off the decoction, which\r\nshould measure about two pints.\r\n\r\nDr. Herbert Snow, resident physician at the Brompton Cancer\r\nHospital, says (1895) he has found: \"after a [440] long experience,\r\nOpium exhibits a strong inhibitive influence on the cancer elements,\r\nretarding and checking the cell growth, which is a main feature of\r\nthe disease. Even when no surgical operation has been performed,\r\nOpium is the only drug which markedly checks cancer growth: and\r\nthe early employment of this medicine will usually add years of\r\ncomfortable life to the otherwise shortened space of the sufferer's\r\nexistence.\" Opium gets its name from the Greek _apos_, juice.\r\n\r\nThe seeds of the white Poppy are known us mawseed, or balewort,\r\nand are given as food to singing birds. In old Egypt these seeds were\r\nmixed with flour and honey, and made into cakes.\r\n\r\nPliny says: \"The rustical peasants of Greece glazed the upper crust\r\nof their loaves with yolks of eggs, and then bestrewed them with\r\nPoppy seeds,\" thus showing that the seeds were then considered free\r\nfrom narcotic properties. And in Queen Elizabeth's time these seeds\r\nwere strewn over confectionery, whilst the oil expressed from them\r\nwas \"delightful to be eaten when taken with bread.\"\r\n\r\nWhite Poppy capsules, when dried, furnish papaverine and\r\nnarcotine, with some mucilage, and a little waxy matter. The seeds\r\ncontained within the capsules yield Poppy seed oil, with a fixed oil,\r\nand a very small quantity of morphia--about five grains in a pound\r\nof white Poppy seeds. In some parts of Russia the seeds are put into\r\nsoups.\r\n\r\nThe Poppy was cultivated by the Greeks before the time of\r\nHippocrates. It has long been a symbol of death, because sending\r\npersons to sleep. Ovid says, concerning the Cave of Somnus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Around whose entry nodding Poppies grow,\r\n    And all cool Simples that sweet rest bestow.\"\r\n\r\n[441] The common scarlet Poppy was called by the Anglo-Saxons\r\n\"Chesebolle,\" \"Chebole,\" or \"Chybolle,\" from the ripe capsule\r\nresembling a round cheese.\r\n\r\nThere is a Welsh Poppy, with yellow flowers; and a horned Poppy,\r\nnamed after Glaucus, common on our sea coasts, with sea-green\r\nleaves, and large blossoms of golden yellow. Glaucus, a fisherman\r\nof Boeotia, observed that all the fishes which he caught received\r\nfresh vigour when laid on the ground, and were immediately able to\r\nleap back into the sea. He attributed these effects to some herb\r\ngrowing in the grass, and upon tasting the leaves of the Sea Poppy\r\nhe found himself suddenly moved with an intense desire to live in\r\nthe sea; wherefore he was made a sea-god by Oceanus and Tethys.\r\nBorlase says: \"That in the Scilly Islands the root of the Sea Poppy is\r\nso much valued for removing all pains in the breast, stomach, and\r\nintestines, as well as so good for disordered lungs, whilst so much\r\nbetter there than in other places, that the apothecaries of Cornwall\r\nsend thither for it; and some persons plant these roots in their\r\ngardens in Cornwall, and will not part with them under sixpence a\r\nroot.\" The scarlet petals of the wild Poppy, very abundant in English\r\ncornfields, when treated with sulphuric acid make a splendid red\r\ndye. With gorgeous tapestry cut from these crimson petals, the\r\nclever \"drapery bee\" (_Apis papaveris_) upholsters the walls of her\r\nsolitary cell. Bruised leaves of the wild, or the garden Poppy, if\r\napplied to a part which has been stung by a bee or a wasp, will give\r\nprompt relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTATO.\r\n\r\nOur invaluable Potato, which enters so largely into the dietary of all\r\nclasses, belongs to the Nightshade tribe of [442] dangerous plants,\r\nthough termed \"solanaceous\" as a natural order because of the\r\nsedative properties which its several genera exercise to lull pain.\r\n\r\nThis Potato, the _Solanum tuberosum_, is so universally known as a\r\nplant that it needs no particular description. It is a native of Peru,\r\nand was imported in 1586 by Thomas Heriot, mathematician and\r\ncolonist, being afterwards taken to Ireland from Virginia by Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, and passing from thence over into Lancashire. He\r\nknew so little of its use that he tried to eat the fruit, or poisonous\r\nberries, of the plant. These of course proved noxious, and he ordered\r\nthe new comers to be rooted out. The gardener obeyed, and in doing\r\nso first learnt the value of their underground wholesome tubers. But\r\nnot until the middle of the eighteenth century, were they common in\r\nthis country as an edible vegetable. \"During 1629,\" says Parkinson,\r\n\"the Potato from Virginia was roasted under the embers, peeled and\r\nsliced: the tubers were put into sack with a little sugar, or were\r\nbaked with cream, marrow, sugar, spice, etc., in pies, or preserved\r\nand candied by the comfit makers.\" But he most probably refers\r\nhere to the Batatas, or sweet Potato, a Convolvulus, which was a\r\npopular esculent vegetable at that date, of tropical origin, and to\r\nwhich our Potato has since been thought to bear a resemblance.\r\n\r\nThis Batatas, or sweet Potato, had the reputation, like Eringo root,\r\nof being able to restore decayed vigour, and so Falstaff is made by\r\nShakespeare to say: \"Let the sky rain potatoes, hail kissing comfits,\r\nand snow eringoes.\" For a considerable while after their\r\nintroduction the Potato tubers were grown only by men of fortune as\r\na delicacy; and the general cultivation of this vegetable was strongly\r\nopposed by the public, [443] chiefly by the Puritans, because no\r\nmention of it could be found in the Bible.\r\n\r\nAlso in France great opposition was offered to the recognised use of\r\nPotatoes: and it is said that Louis the Fifteenth, in order to bring\r\nthe plant into favour, wore a bunch of its flowers in the button hole\r\nof his coat on a high festival. Later on during the Revolution quite a\r\nmania prevailed for Potatoes. Crowds perambulated the streets of\r\nParis shouting for \"la liberte, et des Batatas\"; and when Louis the\r\nSixteenth had been dethroned the gardens of the Tuileries were\r\nplanted with Potatoes. Cobbett, in this country, exclaimed virulently\r\nagainst the tuber as \"hogs' food,\" and hated it as fiercely as he hated\r\ntea. The stalks, leaves, and green berries of the plant share the\r\nnarcotic and poisonous attributes of the nightshades to which it\r\nbelongs; and the part which we eat, though often thought to be a\r\nroot, is really only an underground stem, which has not been acted\r\non by light so as to develop any poisonous tendencies, and in which\r\nstarch is stored up for the future use of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe stalks, leaves, and unripe fruit yield an active principle\r\napparently very powerful, which has not yet been fully investigated.\r\nThere are two sorts of tubers, the red and the white. A roasted\r\nPotato takes two hours to digest; a boiled one three hours and a half.\r\n\"After the Potato,\" says an old proverb, \"cheese.\"\r\n\r\nChemically the Potato contains citric acid, like that of the lemon,\r\nwhich is admirable against scurvy: also potash, which is equally\r\nantiscorbutic, and phosphoric acid, yielding phosphorus in a\r\nquantity less only than that afforded by the apple, and by wheat. It is\r\nof the first importance that the potash salts should be retained by the\r\npotato during cooking: and the [444] tubers should therefore be\r\nsteamed with their coats on; else if peeled, and then steamed, they\r\nlose respectively seven and five per cent. of potash, and phosphoric\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIf boiled after peeling they lose as much as thirty-three per cent. of\r\npotash, and twenty-three per cent. of phosphoric acid. \"The roots,\"\r\nsays Gerard, \"were forbidden in Burgundy, for that they were\r\npersuaded the too frequent use of them causeth the leprosie.\"\r\nNevertheless it is now believed that the Potato has had much to do\r\nwith expelling leprosy from England. The affliction has become\r\nconfined to countries where the Potato is not grown.\r\n\r\nBoiled or steamed Potatoes should turn out floury, or mealy, by\r\nreason of the starch granules swelling up and filling the cellular\r\ntissue, whilst absorbing the albuminous contents of its cells. Then\r\nthe albumen coagulates, and forms irregular fibres between the\r\nstarch grains. The most active part of the tuber lies just beneath the\r\nskin, as may be shown by pouring some tincture of guaiacum over\r\nthe cut surface of a Potato, when a ring of blue forms close to the\r\nskin, and is darkest there while extending over the whole cut\r\nsurface. Abroad there is a belief the Potato thrives best if planted on\r\nMaundy Thursday. Rustic names for it are: Taiders, Taities, Leather\r\nCoats, Leather Jackets, Lapstones, Pinks, No Eyes, Flukes, Blue\r\nEyes, Red Eyes, and Murphies; in Lancashire Potatoes are called\r\nSpruds, and small Potatoes, Sprots.\r\n\r\nThe peel or rind of the tuber contains a poisonous substance called\r\n\"solanin,\" which is dissipated and rendered inert when the whole\r\nPotato is boiled, or steamed. Stupes of hot Potato water are very\r\nserviceable in some forms of rheumatism. To make the [445]\r\ndecoction for this purpose, boil one pound of Potatoes (not peeled,\r\nand divided into quarters.) in two pints of water slowly down to one\r\npint; then foment the swollen and painful parts with this as hot as it\r\ncan be borne. Similarly some of the fresh stalks of the plant, and its\r\nunripe berries, as well as the unpeeled tubers cut up as described, if\r\ninfused for some hours in cold water, will make a liquor in which\r\nthe folded linen of a compress may be loosely rung out, and applied\r\nmost serviceably under waterproof tissue, or a double layer of dry\r\nflannel. The carriage of a small raw Potato in the trousers' pocket\r\nhas been often found preventive of rheumatism in a person\r\npredisposed thereto, probably by reason of the sulphur, and the\r\nnarcotic principles contained in the peel. Ladies in former times had\r\ntheir dresses supplied with special bags, or pockets, in which to\r\ncarry one or more small raw Potatoes about their person for\r\navoiding rheumatism.\r\n\r\nIf peeled and pounded in a mortar, uncooked Potatoes applied cold\r\nmake a very soothing cataplasm to parts that have been scalded, or\r\nburnt. In Derbyshire a hot boiled Potato is used against corns; and\r\nfor frost-bites the mealy flour of baked potatoes, when mixed with\r\nsweet oil and applied, is very healing.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the tuber contains corky wood which swells in boiling\r\nwith the jackets on, and which thus serves to keep in all the juices so\r\nthat the digestibility of the Potato is increased; at the same time\r\nwater is prevented from entering and spoiling the flavour of the\r\nvegetable. The proportion of muscle-forming food (nitrogen) in the\r\nPotato is very small, and it takes ten and a half pounds of the tubers\r\nto equal one pound of butcher's meat in nutritive value.\r\n\r\nThe Potato is composed mainly of starch, which [446] affords\r\nanimal heat and promotes fatness, The Irish think that these tubers\r\nfoster fertility; they prefer them with the jackets on, and somewhat\r\nhard in the middle--\"with the bones in.\" A potato pie is believed to\r\ninvigorate the sexual functions.\r\n\r\nNew Potatoes contain as yet no citric acid, and are hard of digestion,\r\nlike sour crude apples; their nutriment, as Gerard says, \"is sadly\r\nwindy,\" the starch being immature, and not readily acted on by the\r\nsaliva during mastication. \"The longer I live,\" said shrewd Sidney\r\nSmith, \"the more I am convinced that half the unhappiness in the\r\nworld proceeds from a vexed stomach, or vicious bile: from small\r\nstoppages, or from food pressing in the wrong place. Old\r\nfriendships may be destroyed by toasted cheese; and tough salted\r\nmeat has led a man not infrequently to suicide.\"\r\n\r\nA mature Potato yields enough citric acid even for commercial\r\npurposes; and there is no better cleaner of silks, cottons, and\r\nwoollens, than ripe Potato juice. But even of ripe Potatoes those that\r\nbreak into a watery meal in the boiling are always found to prove\r\ngreatly diuretic, and to much increase the quantity of urine.\r\n\r\nBy fermentation mature Potatoes, through their starch and sugar,\r\nyield a wine from which may be distilled a Potato spirit, and from it\r\na volatile oil can be extracted, called by the Germans, _Fuseloel_.\r\nThis is nauseous, and causes a heavy headache, with indigestion,\r\nand biliary disorders together with nervous tremors. Chemically it is\r\namylic ether.\r\n\r\nAlso when boiled with weak sulphuric acid, the Potato starch is\r\nchanged into glucose, or grape sugar, which by fermentation yields\r\nalcohol: and this spirit is often sold under the name of British\r\nbrandy.\r\n\r\nA luminosity strong enough to enable a bystander to [447] read by\r\nits light issues from the common Potato when in a state of\r\nputrefaction. In Cumberland, to have \"taities and point to dinner,\" is\r\na figurative expression which implies scanty fare. At a time when\r\nthe duty on salt made the condiment so dear that it was scarce in a\r\nhousehold, the persons at table were fain to point their Potatoes at\r\nthe salt cellar, and thus to cheat their imaginations. Carlyle asks in\r\n_Sartor Resartus_ about \"an unknown condiment named 'point,' into\r\nthe meaning of which I have vainly enquired; the victuals _potato\r\nand point_ not appearing in any European cookery book whatever.\"\r\n\r\nGerman ladies, at their five o'clock tea, indulge in Potato talk\r\n(_Kartoffel gesprach_) about table dainties, and the methods of\r\ncooking them. Men likewise, from the four quarters of the globe, in\r\nthe days of our childhood, were given to hold similar domestic\r\nconclaves, when:--\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. East made a feast,\r\n    Mr. North laid the cloth,\r\n    Mr. West brought his best,\r\n    Mr. South burnt his mouth\r\n        Eating a cold Potato.\"\r\n\r\nWith pleasant skill of poetic alliteration, Sidney Smith wrote in\r\nordering how to mix a sallet:--\r\n\r\n    \"Two large Potatoes passed through kitchen sieve,\r\n    Unwonted softness to a salad give.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Thomas Overbury wittily said about a dolt who took credit\r\nfor the merits of his ancestors: \"Like the Potato, all that was good\r\nabout him was underground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMROSE.\r\n\r\nThe Common Primrose (_Primula veris_) is the most widely known\r\nof our English wild flowers, and appears in the Spring as its earliest\r\nherald.\r\n\r\n[448] It gets its name from the Latin _primus_, first, being named in\r\nold books and M.S. _Pryme rolles_, and in the _Grete Herball_,\r\nPrimet, as shortened from Primprint.\r\n\r\nIn North Devon it is styled the Butter Rose, and in the Eastern\r\ncounties it is named (in common with the Cowslip) Paigle, Peagle,\r\nPegyll, and Palsy plant.\r\n\r\nMedicinally also it possesses similar curative attributes, though in a\r\nlesser degree, to those of the Cowslip. Both the root and the flowers\r\ncontain a volatile oil, and \"primulin\" which is identical with\r\nmannite: whilst the acrid principle is \"saponin.\" Alfred Austin, Poet\r\nLaureate, teaches to \"make healing salve with early Primroses.\"\r\n\r\nPliny speaks of the Primrose as almost a panacea: _In aqua potam\r\nomnibus morbis mederi tradunt_. An infusion of the flowers has\r\nbeen always thought excellent against nervous disorders of the\r\nhysterical sort. It should be made with from five to ten parts of the\r\npetals to one hundred of water. \"Primrose tea\" says Gerard, \"drunk\r\nin the month of May, is famous for curing the phrensie.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is sedative and antispasmodic, being of service by\r\nits preparations to relieve sleeplessness, nervous headache, and\r\nmuscular rheumatism. The juice if sniffed up into the nostrils will\r\nprovoke violent sneezing, and will induce a free flow of water from\r\nthe lining membranes of the nostrils for the mitigation of passive\r\nheadaches: though this should not be tried by a person of full habit\r\nwith a determination of blood to the head. A teaspoonful of\r\npowdered dry Primrose root will act as an emetic. The whole herb is\r\nsomewhat expectorant.\r\n\r\nWhen the petals are collected and dried they become of a greenish\r\ncolour: whilst fresh they have a honey-like odour, and a sweetish\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n[449] Within the last few years a political significance and\r\npopularity have attached themselves to the Primrose beyond every\r\nother British wild flower. It arouses the patriotism of the large\r\nConservative party, and enlists the favour of many others who\r\nthoughtlessly follow an attractive fashion, and who love the first\r\nfruits of early Spring. Botanically the Primrose has two varieties of\r\nfloral structure: one \"pin-eyed,\" with a tall pistil, and short\r\nstamens; the other \"thrum-eyed,\" showing a rosette of tall stamens,\r\nwhilst the short pistil must be looked for, like the great Panjandrum\r\nhimself, \"with a little round button at the top,\" half way down the\r\ntube. Darwin was the first to explain that this diversity of structure\r\nensures cross fertilisation by bees and allied insects. Through\r\nadvanced cultivation at the hands of the horticulturist the Primula\r\nacquires in some instances a noxious character. For instance, the\r\n_Primula biconica_, which is often grown in dwelling rooms as a\r\nwindow plant, and commonly sold as such, will provoke an\r\ncrysipelatous vesicular eruption of a very troublesome and inflamed\r\ncharacter on the hands and face of some persons who come in\r\ncontact with the plant by manipulating it to take cuttings, or in other\r\nways. A knowledge of this fact should suggest the probable\r\nusefulness of the said Primula, when made into a tincture, and given\r\nin small diluted doses thereof, to act curatively for such an eruption\r\nif attacking the sufferer from idiopathic causes.\r\n\r\nThe Latins named the Ligustrum (our Privet) Primrose. Coles says\r\nconcerning it (17th century): \"This herbe is called Primrose; it is\r\ngood to 'Potage.'\" They also applied the epithet, \"Prime rose\" to a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nThe Evening Primrose (_OEnothera biennis_, or _odorata_) is found\r\nin this country on sand banks in the West of England and Cornwall;\r\nbut it is then most probably a [450] garden scape, and an alien, its\r\nnative habitat being in Canada and the United States of America.\r\nWe cultivate it freely in our parterres as a brilliant, yellow, showy\r\nflower. It belongs to the natural order, _Onagraceoe_, so called\r\nbecause the food of wild asses; and was the \"vini venator\" of\r\nTheophrastus, 350 B.C. The name signifies having the odour of\r\nwine, _oinos_ and _theera_. Pliny said: \"It is an herbe good as wine\r\nto make the heart merrie. It groweth with leaves resembling those of\r\nthe almond tree, and beareth flowers like unto roses. Of such virtue\r\nis this herbe that if it be given to drink to the wildest beast that\r\nis, it will tame the same and make it gentle.\" The best variety of this\r\nplant is the _OEnothera macrocarpa_.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the Evening Primrose is mucilaginous, and a decoction\r\nmade therefrom is of service for bathing the skin eruptions of\r\ninfants and young children. To answer such purpose a decoction\r\nshould be made from the small twigs, and from the bark of the\r\nlarger branches, retaining the leaves. This has been found further of\r\nuse for diarrhoea associated with an irritable stomach, and asthma.\r\nThe infusion, or the liquid extract, acts as a mild but efficient\r\nsedative in nervous indigestion, from twenty to thirty drops of the\r\nlatter being given for a dose. The ascertained chemical principle of\r\nthe plant, _OEnotherin_, is a compound body. Its flowers open in\r\nthe evening, and last only until the next noon; therefore this plant is\r\ncalled the \"Evening Primrose,\" or \"Evening Star.\"\r\n\r\nAnother of the Primrose tribe, the Cyclamen, or Sow-bread (_Panis\r\nporcinus_), is often grown in our gardens, and for ornamenting our\r\nrooms as a pot plant. Its name means (Greek) \"a circle,\" and refers\r\nto the reflected corolla, or to the spiral fruit-stalks; and again,\r\n[451] from the tuber being the food of wild swine. Gerard said it was\r\nreported in his day to grow wild on the Welsh mountains, and on the\r\nLincolnshire hills: but he failed to find it. Nevertheless it is now\r\nalmost naturalised in some parts of the South, and East of England.\r\nAs the petals die, the stalks roll up and carry the capsular berries\r\ndown to the surface of the ground. A medicinal tincture is made\r\n(H.) from the fresh root when flowering. The ivy-leaved variety is\r\nfound in England, with nodding fresh-coloured blossoms, and a\r\nbrown intensely acrid root. Besides starch, gum, and pectin, it yields\r\nchemically, \"cyclamin,\" or \"arthanatin,\" with an action like\r\n\"saponin,\" whilst the juice is poisonous to fish. When applied\r\nexternally as a liniment over the bowels, it causes them to be\r\npurged. Gerard quaintly and suggestively declares \"It is not good\r\nfor women with childe to touch, or take this herbe, or to come neere\r\nunto it, or to stride over the same where it groweth: for the natural\r\nattractive vertue therein contained is such that, without controversie,\r\nthey that attempt it in manner above said, shall be delivered before\r\ntheir time; which danger and inconvenience to avoid, I have\r\nfastened sticks in the ground about the place in my garden where it\r\ngroweth, and some other sticks also crosswaies over them, lest any\r\nwoman should by lamentable experiment find my words to be true\r\nby stepping over the same. Again, the root hanged about women in\r\ntheir extreme travail with childe, causeth them to be delivered\r\nincontinent: and the leaves put into the place hath the like effect.\"\r\nInferentially a tincture of the plant should be good for falling and\r\ndisplacement of the womb. \"Furthermore, Sowbread, being beaten,\r\nand made into little flat cakes, is reputed to be a good amorous\r\nmedicine, to make one in love.\"\r\n\r\n[452] In France, another Primula, the wild Pimpernel, occurs as a\r\nnoxious herb, and is therefore named Mouron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINCE.\r\n\r\nThe Quince (_Cydonia_) is cultivated sparingly in our orchards for\r\nthe sake of its highly fragrant, and strong-smelling fruit, which\r\nas an adjunct to apples is much esteemed for table uses.\r\n\r\nIt may well be included among remedial Herbal Simples because of\r\nthe virtues possessed by the seeds within the fruit. The tree is a\r\nnative of Persia and Crete; bearing a pear-shaped fruit, golden\r\nyellow when gathered, and with five cells in it, each containing\r\ntwelve closely packed seeds. These are mucilaginous when\r\nunbroken, and afford the taste of bitter almonds.\r\n\r\nWhen immersed in water they swell up considerably, and the\r\nmucilage will yield salts of lime with albumen.\r\n\r\n_Bandoline_ is the mucilage of Quince seeds to which some Eau de\r\nCologne is added: and this mixture is employed for keeping the hair\r\nfixed when dressed by the _Coiffeur_.\r\n\r\nThe mucilage of Quince seeds is soothing and protective to an\r\nirritated or inflamed skin; it may also be given internally for\r\nsoreness of the lining mucous membranes of the stomach and\r\nbowels, as in gastric catarrh, and for cough with a dry sore throat.\r\nOne dram of the seeds boiled slowly in half-a-pint of fresh water\r\nuntil the liquor becomes thick, makes an excellent mucilage as a\r\nbasis for gargles and injections; or, one part of the seeds to fifty\r\nparts of rosewater, shaken together for half-an-hour.\r\n\r\nFrom growing at first in Cydon, now Candia, the tree got its name\r\n_Cydonia_: its old English title was Melicotone; and in ancient\r\nRome it was regarded as a sacred fruit, [453] being hung upon\r\nstatues in the houses of the great. Now we banish the tree, because\r\nof its strong penetrating odour, to a corner of the garden.\r\nLord Bacon commended \"quiddemy,\" a preserve of Quinces, for\r\nstrengthening the stomach; and old Fuller said of this fruit, \"being\r\nnot more pleasant to the palate than restorative to the health, they\r\nare accounted a great cordiall.\" Jam made from the Quince (_Malmelo_)\r\nfirst took the name of Marmalade, which has since passed on\r\nto other fruit conserves, particularly to that of the Seville\r\nOrange. In France the Quince is made into a _compote_ which is\r\nhighly praised for increasing the digestive powers of weakly\r\npersons. According to Plutarch Solon made a law that the Quince\r\nshould form the invariable feast of the bridegroom (and some add\r\nlikewise of the bride) before retiring to the nuptial couch. Columella\r\nsaid: \"Quinces yield not only pleasure but health.\" The Greeks\r\nnamed the Quince \"Chrysomelon,\" or the Golden Apple; so it is\r\nasserted that the golden fruit of the Hesperides were Quinces, and\r\nthat these tempted Hercules to attack their guardian dragon.\r\nShakespeare makes Lady Capulet when ordering the wedding feast,\r\n\r\n    \"Call for dates, and Quinces in the pastry.\"\r\n\r\nIn Persia the fruit ripens, and is eaten there as a dessert delicacy\r\nwhich is much prized. If there be but a single Quince in a caravan,\r\nno one who accompanies it can remain unconscious of its presence.\r\nIn Sussex at one time a popular wine was made of Quinces. They\r\nare astringent to stay diarrhoea; and a syrup may be concocted from\r\ntheir juice to answer this purpose. For thrush and for excoriations\r\nwithin the mouth and upper throat, one drachm of the seeds should\r\n[459] be boiled in eight fluid ounces of water until it acquires a\r\nproper demulcent mucilaginous consistence. \"Simon Sethi writeth,\"\r\nsays Gerard: \"that the woman with child that eateth many Quinces\r\nduring the time of her breeding, shall bring forth wise children, and\r\nof good understanding.\" Gerard says again: \"The marmalad, or\r\nCotiniat made of Quinces and sugar is good and profitable to\r\nstrengthen the stomach that it may retain and keep the meat therein\r\nuntil it be perfectly digested. It also stayeth all kinds of fluxes\r\nboth of the belly, and of other parts, and also of blood. Which\r\ncotiniat is made in this manner. Take four Quinces, pare them, cut them\r\nin pieces, and cast away the core: then put into every pound of Quinces\r\na pound of sugar, and to every pound of sugar a pint of water. These\r\nmust be boiled together over a still fire till they be very soft: next\r\nlet it be strained, or rather rubbed through a strainer, or a hairy\r\nsieve, which is better. And then set it over the fire to boil again\r\nuntil it be stiff: and so box it up: and as it cooleth, put thereto\r\na little rose water, and a few grains of musk mingled together,\r\nwhich will give a goodly taste to the cotiniat. This is the way\r\nto make marmalad.\"\r\n\r\n\"The seed of Quinces tempered with water doth make a mucilage, or\r\na thing like jelly which, being held in the mouth is marvellous good\r\nto take away the roughness of the tongue in hot burning fevers.\"\r\nLady Lisle sent some cotiniat of Quinces to Henry the Eighth by her\r\ndaughter Katharine. They were reputed a sexual stimulant. After\r\nbeing boiled and preserved in syrup, Quinces give a well known\r\npleasant flavour to apple pie. As the fruit is free from acid, or\r\nalmost so; its marmalade may be eaten by the goutily disposed with more\r\nimpunity than that made with the Seville orange. An after taste\r\nsuggestive of [455] garlic is left on the palate by masticating Quince\r\nmarmalade.\r\n\r\nIn the modern treatment of chronic dysentery the value of certain\r\nkinds of fresh fruit has come to be medically recognised. Of these\r\nmay be specified strawberries, grapes, fresh figs, and tomatoes, all\r\nof which are seed fruits as distinguished from stone fruit. It is\r\nessential that they shall be absolutely sound, and in good condition.\r\nDr. Saumaurez Lacy, of Guernsey, has successfully practised this\r\ntreatment for many years, and it has been recently employed by\r\nothers for chronic dysentery, and diarrhoea, with most happy\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRADISH.\r\n\r\nThe common garden Radish (_Raphanus sativus_) is a Cruciferous\r\nplant, and a cultivated variety of the Horse Radish. It came\r\noriginally from China, but has been grown allover Europe from time\r\nimmemorial. Radishes were celebrated by Dioscorides and Pliny as\r\nabove all roots whatsoever, insomuch, that in the Delphic temple\r\nthere was a Radish of solid gold, _raphanus ex auro dicatus_: and\r\nMoschinus wrote a whole volume in their praise; but Hippocrates\r\ncondemned them as _vitiosas, innatantes, acoegre concoctiles._\r\n\r\nAmong the oblations offered to Apollo in his temple at Delphi,\r\nturnips were dedicated in lead, beet in silver, and radishes in\r\nwrought gold. The wild Radish is _Raphanus raphanistrum_. The\r\ngarden Radish was not grown in England before 1548.\r\n\r\nLater on John Evelyn wrote in his _Acetaria_: \"And indeed (besides\r\nthat they decay the teeth) experience tells us that, as the Prince of\r\nPhysicians writes, it is hard of digestion, inimicous to the stomach,\r\ncausing nauseous eructations, and sometimes vomiting, though\r\n[456] otherwise diuretic, and thought to repel the vapours of wine\r\nwhen the wits were at their genial club.\" \"The Radish,\" says Gerard,\r\n\"provoketh urine, and dissolveth cluttered sand.\"\r\n\r\nThe roots, which are the edible part, consist of a watery fibrous\r\npulp, which is comparatively bland, and of an external skin\r\nfurnished with a pungent volatile aromatic oil which acts as a\r\ncondiment to the phlegmatic pulp. \"Radishes are eaten with salt\r\nalone as carrying their pepper in them.\" The oil contained in the\r\nroots, and likewise in the seeds, is sulphuretted, and disagrees with\r\npersons of weak digestion. A young Radish, which is quickly grown\r\nand tender, will suit most stomachs, especially if some of the leaves\r\nare masticated together with the root; but a Radish which is tough,\r\nstrong, and hollow, \"_fait penser a l'ile d'Elbe: il revient_.\"\r\n\r\nThe pulp is chemically composed chiefly of nitrogenous substance,\r\nbeing fibrous and tough unless when the roots are young and\r\nquickly grown. On this account they should not be eaten when at all\r\nold and hard by persons of slow digestion, because apt to lodge in\r\nthe intestines, and to become entangled in their caecal pouch, or in\r\nits appendix. But boiled Radishes are almost equal to asparagus\r\nwhen served at table, provided they have been cooked long enough\r\nto become tender, that is, for almost an hour. The syrup of radishes\r\nis excellent for hoarseness, bronchial difficulty of breathing,\r\nwhooping cough, and other complaints of the chest.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of corns, if after the feet have been bathed, and the\r\ncorns cut, a drop or two of juice be squeezed over the corn from the\r\nfresh pulp of a radish on several consecutive days, this will wither\r\nand [457] disappear. Also Radish roots sliced when fresh, and\r\napplied to a carbuncle will promote its healing. An old Saxon\r\nremedy against a woman's chatter was to \"taste at night a root of\r\nRadish when fasting, and the chatter will not be able to harm him.\"\r\nIn some places the Radish is called Rabone.\r\n\r\nFrom the fresh plant, choosing a large Spanish Radish, with a\r\nturnip-shaped root, and a black outer skin, and collected in the\r\nautumn, a medicinal tincture (H.) is made with spirit of wine. This\r\ntincture has proved beneficial in cases of bilious diarrhoea, with\r\neructations, and mental depression, when a chronic cough is also\r\nliable to be present. Four or five drops should be given with a\r\ntablespoonful of cold water, twice or three times in the day. The\r\nBlack Radish is found useful against whooping cough, and is\r\nemployed for this purpose in Germany, by cutting off the top, and\r\nthen making a hole in the root. This is filled with treacle, or honey,\r\nand allowed to stand for a day or two; then a teaspoonful of the\r\nmedicinal liquid is given two or three times in the day. Roman\r\nphysicians advised that Radishes should be eaten raw, with bread\r\nand salt in the morning before any other food. And our poet\r\nThomson describes as an evening repast:--\r\n\r\n                    \"A Roman meal\r\n    Such as the mistress of the world once found\r\n    Delicious, when her patriots of high note,\r\n    Perhaps by moonlight at their humble doors,\r\n    Under an ancient Oak's domestic shade,\r\n    Enjoy'd spare feast, a RADISH AND AN EGG.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGWORT.\r\n\r\nThe Ragwort (_Senecio Jacoboea_) is a very common plant in our\r\nmeadows, and moist places, closely allied to the [458] Groundsel,\r\nand well known by its daisy-like flowers, but of a golden yellow\r\ncolour, with rays in a circle surrounding the central receptacle, and\r\nwith a strong smell of honey. This plant goes popularly by the name\r\nof St. James's wort, or Canker wort, or (near Liverpool) Fleawort,\r\nand in Yorkshire, Seggrum; also Jacoby and Yellow Top. The term\r\nRagwort, or Ragweed, is a corruption of Ragewort, as expressing its\r\nsupposed stimulating effects on the sexual organs. For the same\r\nreason the _pommes d'amour_ (Love Apples, or Tomatoes) are\r\nsometimes caned Rage apples. The Ragwort was formerly thought\r\nto cure the staggers in horses, and was hence named Stagger wort,\r\nor because, says Dr. Prior, it was applied to heal freshly cut young\r\nbulls, known as Seggs, or Staggs. So also it was called St. James's\r\nwort, either because that great warrior and saint was the patron of\r\nhorses, or because it blossoms on his day, July 25th: sometimes also\r\nthe plant has been styled Stammer wort. Furthermore it possesses a\r\ndistinct reputation for the cure of cancer, and is known as\r\nCankerwort, being applied when bruised, either by itself, or\r\ncombined with Goosegrass.\r\n\r\nProbably the lime which the whole plant contains in a highly\r\nelaborated state of subdivision has fairly credited it with\r\nanti-cancerous powers. For just such a reason Sir Spencer Wens\r\ncommended powdered egg shells and powdered oyster shells as\r\nefficacious in curing certain cases under his immediate observation\r\nof long-standing cancer, when steadily given for some considerable\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA poultice made of the fresh leaves, and applied externally two or\r\nthree times in succession \"will cure, if ever so violent, the old ache\r\nin the hucklebone known as sciatica.\" Chemically the active\r\nprinciple of the [459] Ragwort is \"senecin,\" a dark resinous\r\nsubstance, of which two grains may be given twice or three times in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nAlso the tincture, made with one part of the plant to ten parts of\r\nspirit of wine (tenuior), may be taken in doses of from five to fifteen\r\ndrops, with a spoonful of water three times in the day.\r\n\r\nEither form of medicine will correct monthly irregularities of\r\nwomen where the period is delayed, or difficult, or arrested by cold.\r\nIt must be given steadily three times a day for ten days or a fortnight\r\nbefore the period becomes re-established. In suitable cases the\r\nSenecio not only anticipates the period, but also increases the\r\nquantity: and where the monthly time has never been established the\r\nRagwort is generally found useful.\r\n\r\nThis herb--like its congener, the common Groundsel--has lancinated,\r\njuicy leaves, which possess a bitter saline taste, and yield\r\nearthy potash salts abundantly. Each plant is named \"Senecio\"\r\nbecause of the grey woolly pappus of its seeds, which resemble the\r\nsilvered hair of old age. In Ireland the Ragwort is dedicated to the\r\nfairies, and is known as the Fairies' Horse, on the golden blossoms\r\nof which the good little people are thought to gallop about at\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRASPBERRY.\r\n\r\nThe Raspberry (_Rubus Idoeus_) occurs wild plentifully in the\r\nwoods of Scotland, where children gather the fruit early in summer.\r\nIt is also found growing freely in some parts of England--as in the\r\nSussex woods--and bearing berries of as good a quality as that of\r\nthe cultivated Raspberry, though not so large in size.\r\n\r\nAnother name for the fruit is _Framboise_, which is [460] a French\r\ncorruption of the Dutch word _brambezie_, or brambleberry.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Respis, or Raspberry, was at one time commonly known\r\nin this country as Hindberry, or the gentler berry, as distinguished\r\nfrom one of a harsher and coarser sort, the Hartberry. \"Respberry\"\r\nsignifies in the Eastern Counties of England a shoot, or sucker, this\r\nname being probably applied because the fruit grows on the young\r\nshoots of the previous year. Raspberry fruit is fragrant and cooling,\r\nbut sugar improves its flavour. Like the strawberry, if eaten without\r\nsugar and cream, it does not undergo any acetous fermentation in\r\nthe stomach, even with gouty or strumous persons. When combined\r\nwith vinegar and sugar it makes a liqueur which, if diluted with\r\nwater, is most useful in febrile disorders, and which is all excellent\r\naddition to sea stores as preventive of scurvy.\r\n\r\nThe Latins named this shrub \"the bramble of Ida,\" because it grew\r\nin abundance on that classic mountain where the shepherd Paris\r\nadjudged to Venus the prize for beauty--a golden apple--on which\r\nwas divinely inscribed the words, _Detur pulchriori_--\"Let this be\r\nawarded to the fairest of womankind.\"\r\n\r\nThe fresh leaves of the Raspberry are the favourite food of kids.\r\nThere are red, white, yellow, and purple varieties of this fruit. Heat\r\ndevelops the richness of its flavour; and Raspberry jam is the prince\r\nof preserves.\r\n\r\nAgain, a wine can be brewed from the fermented juice, which is\r\nexcellent against scurvy because of its salts of potash--the citrate\r\nand malate.\r\n\r\nRaspberry vinegar, made by pouring vinegar repeatedly over\r\nsuccessive quantities of the fresh fruit, is a capital remedy for sore\r\nthroat from cold, or of the [461] relaxed kind; and when mixed with\r\nwater it furnishes a most refreshing drink in fevers. But the berries\r\nshould be used immediately after being gathered, as they quickly\r\nspoil, and their fine flavour is very evanescent. The vinegar can be\r\nextemporised by diluting Raspberry jelly with hot vinegar, or by\r\nmixing syrup of the fruit with vinegar.\r\n\r\nIn Germany a conserve of Raspberries which has astringent effects\r\nis concocted with two parts of sugar to one of juice expressed from\r\nthe fruit. Besides containing citric and malic acids, the Raspberry\r\naffords a volatile oil of aromatic flavour, with crystallisable sugar,\r\npectin, colouring matter, mucus, some mineral salts, and water.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"The fruit is good to be given to them that have weake,\r\nand queasie stomackes.\"\r\n\r\nA playful example of the declension of a Latin substantive is given\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    _Musa, Musoe_,\r\n    The Gods were at tea:\r\n    _Musoe, Musam_,\r\n    Eating Raspberry jam:\r\n    _Musa, Musah_,\r\n    Made by Cupid's mamma.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHUBARB (Garden). _see_ Dock, _page_ 159.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICE.\r\n\r\nRice, or Ryse, the grain of _Oryza sativa_, a native cereal of India,\r\nis considered here scarcely as a Herbal Simple, but rather as a\r\ncommon article of some medicinal resource in the store cupboard of\r\nevery English house-hold, and therefore always at band as a\r\nvegetable remedy.\r\n\r\nAmong the Arabs Rice is considered a sacred food: [462] and their\r\ntradition runs that it first sprang from a drop of Mahomet's\r\nperspiration in Paradise.\r\n\r\nBeing composed almost exclusively of starch, and poorer in\r\nnitrogen, as well as in phosphoric acid, than other cereals, it is less\r\nlaxative, and is of value as a demulcent to palliate irritative\r\ndiarrhoea, and to allay intestinal distress.\r\n\r\nA mucilage of Rice made by boiling the well-washed grain for some\r\ntime in water, and straining, contains starch and phosphate of lime\r\nin solution, and is therefore a serviceable emollient. But when\r\nneeded for food the grain should be steamed, because in boiling it\r\nloses the little nitrogen, and the greater part of the lime phosphate\r\nwhich it has scantily contained.\r\n\r\nRice bread and Rice cakes, simply made, are very light and easy of\r\ndigestion. The gluten confers the property of rising on dough or\r\npaste made of Rice flour. But as an article of sustenance Rice is not\r\nwell suited for persons of fermentative tendencies during the\r\ndigestion of their food, because its starch is liable to undergo this\r\nchemical change in the stomach.\r\n\r\nDr. Tytler reported in the _Lancet_ (1833), cases resembling\r\nmalignant cholera from what he termed the _morbus oryzoeus_, as\r\nprovoked by the free and continued use of Rice as food. And\r\nBoutins, in 1769, published an account of the diseases common to\r\nthe East Indies, in which he stated that when Rice is eaten more or\r\nless exclusively, the vision becomes impaired. But neither of these\r\nallegations seems to have been afterwards authoritatively confirmed.\r\n\r\nChemically, Rice consists of starch, fat, fibrin, mineral matter such\r\nas phosphate of lime, cellulose, and water.\r\n\r\nA spirituous liquor is made in China from the grain of Rice, and\r\nbears the name \"arrack.\"\r\n\r\n[463] Rice cannot be properly substituted in place of succulent\r\ngreen vegetables dietetically for any length of time, or it would\r\ninduce scurvy. The Indians take stewed Rice to cure dysentery, and\r\na decoction of the grain for the purpose of subduing inflammatory\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nPaddy, or Paddee, is Rice from which the husk has not been\r\nremoved before crushing. It has been said by some that the\r\ncultivation of Rice lowers vitality, and shortens life.\r\n\r\nIn Java a special Rice-pudding is made by first putting some raw\r\nRice in a conical earthen pot wide at the top, and perforated in its\r\nbody with holes. This is placed inside another earthen pot of a\r\nsimilar shape but not perforated, and containing boiling water. The\r\nswollen Rice soon stops up the holes of the inner pot, and the Rice\r\nwithin becomes of a firm consistence, like pudding, and is eaten\r\nwith butter, sugar, and spices.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary Rice-pudding is much improved by adding some\r\nrosewater to it before it is baked.\r\n\r\nThis grain has been long considered of a pectoral nature, and useful\r\nfor persons troubled with lung disease, and spitting of blood, as in\r\npulmonary consumption. The custom of throwing a shower of Rice\r\nafter and over a newly married couple is very old, though wheat was\r\nat first the chosen grain as an augury of plenty. The bride wore a\r\ngarland of ears of corn in the time of Henry the Eighth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSES.\r\n\r\nCertain curative properties are possessed both by the Briar, or wild\r\nDog Rose of our country hedges, and by the cultivated varieties of\r\nthis queen of flowers in our Roseries. The word Rose means red,\r\nfrom the Greek [464] _rodon_, connected also with _rota_, a wheel,\r\nwhich resembles the outline of a Rose. The name Briar is from the\r\nLatin _bruarium_, the waste land on which it grows. The first Rose\r\nof a dark red colour, is held to have sprung from the blood of\r\nAdonis. The fruit of the wild Rose, which is so familiar to every\r\nadmirer of our hedgerows in the summer, and which is the common\r\nprogenitor of all Roses, is named Hips. \"Heps maketh,\" says Gerard,\r\n\"most pleasant meats or banquetting dishes, as tarts and such like,\r\nthe concoction whereof I commit to the cunning cook, and teeth to\r\neat them in the rich man's mouth.\"\r\n\r\nHips, derived from the old Saxon, _hiupa, jupe_, signifies the Briar\r\nrather than its fruit. They are called in some parts, \"choops,\" or\r\n\"hoops.\" The woolly down which surrounds the seeds within the\r\nHips serves admirably for dispelling round worms, on which it acts\r\nmechanically without irritating the mucous membrane which lines\r\nthe bowels.\r\n\r\nWhen fully ripe and softened by frost, the Hips, after removal of\r\ntheir hard seeds, and when plenty of sugar is added, make a very\r\nnice confection, which the Swiss and Germans eat at dessert, and\r\nwhich forms an agreeable substitute for tomato sauce. Apothecaries\r\nemploy this conserve in the preparing of electuaries, and as a basis\r\nfor pills. They also officinally use the petals of the Cabbage Rose\r\n(_Centifolia_) for making Rose water, and the petals of the Red\r\nRose (_Gallica_) for a cooling infusion, the brilliant colour of which\r\nis much improved by adding some diluted sulphuric acid; and of\r\nthese petals they further direct a syrup to be concocted.\r\n\r\nNext in development to the Dog Rose, or Hound's Rose, comes the\r\nSweetbriar (Eglantine), with a delicate perfume contained under its\r\nglandular leaves. [465] \"_Fragrantia ejus olei omnia alia odoramenta\r\nsuperest_.\" This (_Rosa rubiginosa_) grows chiefly on chalk as a\r\nbushy shrub. Its poetic title, Eglantine, is a corruption of the Latin\r\n_aculeius_, prickly. A legend tells that Christ's crown of thorns was\r\nmade from the Rose-briar, about which it has been beautifully\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n   \"Men sow the thorns on Jesus' brow,\r\n   But Angels saw the Roses.\"\r\n\r\nPliny tells a remarkable story of a soldier of the Praetorian guard,\r\nwho was cured of hydrophobia, against all hope, by taking an\r\nextract of the root of the _Kunoroddon_, Dog Rose, in obedience to\r\nthe prayer of his mother, to whom the remedy was revealed in a\r\ndream; and he says further, that it likewise restored whoever tried\r\nit afterwards. Hence came the title _Canina_. \"_Parceque elle a\r\nlongtemps ete en vogue pour guerir de la rage_.\"\r\n\r\nBut the term, Dog Rose, is generally thought to merely signify a\r\nflower of lower quality than the nobler Roses of garden culture.\r\n\r\nThe five graceful fringed leaflets which form the special beauty of\r\nthe Eglantine flower and bud, have given rise to the following Latin\r\nenigma (translated):--\r\n\r\n    \"Of us five brothers at the same time born,\r\n    Two from our birthday always beards have worn:\r\n    On other two none ever have appeared,\r\n    While our fifth brother wears but half a beard.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Roses the Romans prepared wine and confections, also subtle\r\nscents, sweet-smelling oil, and medicines. The petals of the crimson\r\nFrench Rose, which is grown freely in our gardens, have been\r\nesteemed of signal efficacy in consumption of the lungs [466] since\r\nthe time of Avicenna, A.D. 1020, who states that he cured many\r\npatients by prescribing as much of the conserve as they could\r\nmanage to swallow daily. It was combined with milk, or with some\r\nother light nutriment; and generally from thirty to forty pounds of\r\nthis medicine had to be consumed before the cure was complete.\r\nJulius Caesar hid his baldness at the age of thirty with Roman Roses.\r\n\r\n\"Take,\" says an old MS. recipe of Lady Somerset's, \"Red Rose buds,\r\nand clyp of the tops, and put them in a mortar with ye waight of\r\ndouble refined sugar; beat them very small together, then put it up;\r\nmust rest three full months, stirring onces a day. This is good\r\nagainst the falling sickness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that while the blossoms of the Rose Order present\r\nvarious shades of yellow, white, and red, blue is altogether foreign\r\nto them, and unknown among them.\r\n\r\nAs the Thistle is symbolical of Scotland, the Leek of Wales, and the\r\nShamrock of Ireland: so the sweet, pure, simple, honest Rose of our\r\nwoods is the apt-chosen emblem of Saint George, and the frank,\r\nbonny, blushing badge of Merrie England.\r\n\r\nThe petals of the Cabbage Rose (_Centifolia_), which are closely\r\nfolded over each other like the leaves of a cabbage, have a slight\r\nlaxative action, and are used for making Rose-water by distillation,\r\nwhether when fresh, or after being preserved by admixture with\r\ncommon salt. This perfumed water has long enjoyed a reputation for\r\nthe cure of inflamed eyes, more commonly when combined with\r\nzinc, or with sugar of lead. Hahnemann quotes the same established\r\npractice as a tacit avowal that there exists in the leaves of the Rose\r\nsome healing power for certain diseased conditions of [567] the\r\neyes, which virtue is really founded on the homoeopathic property\r\npossessed by the Rose, of exciting a species of ophthalmia in\r\nhealthy persons; as was observed by Echtius, Ledelius, and Rau.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded also in his _Organon of Medicine_, that persons are\r\nsometimes found to faint at the smell of Roses (or, as Pope puts it,\r\nto \"die of a rose in aromatic pain\"); whereas the Princess Maria,\r\ncured her brother, the Emperor Alexius, who suffered from\r\nfaintings, by sprinkling him with Rose-water, in the presence of his\r\naunt Eudoxia.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy Greeks and Romans strewed Roses on the tombs of\r\ndeparted friends, whilst poorer persona could only afford a tablet\r\nat the grave bearing the prayer:\r\n\r\n    \"Sparge, precor, rosas super mea busta, viator.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Scatter Roses, I beseech you, over my ashes, O pitiful passer-by.\"\r\n\r\nBut nowadays many persons have an aversion to throwing a Rose\r\ninto a grave, or even letting one fall in.\r\n\r\nRoses and reticence of speech have been linked together since the\r\ntime of Harpocrates, whom Cupid bribed to silence by the gift of a\r\ngolden Rose-bud; and therefore it became customary at Roman\r\nfeasts to suspend over the table a flower of this kind as a hint that\r\nthe convivial sayings which were then interchanged wore not to be\r\ntalked of outside. What was spoken \"sub vino\" was not to be\r\npublished \"sub divo\":\r\n\r\n    \"Est rosa flos veneris, cujus quo facta laterent\r\n    Harpocrati, matris dona, dicavit amor:\r\n    Inde rosam mensis hospes suspendid amicis,\r\n    Conviva ut sub ea dicta tacenda sciat.\"\r\n\r\n[468] For the same reason the Rose is found sculptured on the\r\nceilings of banqueting rooms; and in 1526 it began to be placed over\r\nConfessionals. Thus it has come about that the Rose is held to be the\r\nsymbol of secrecy, as well as the flower of love, and the emblem of\r\nbeauty: so that the significant phrase \"sub rosa,\"--under the Rose,--\r\nconveys a recognised meaning, understood, and respected by\r\neveryone. The bed of Roses is not altogether a poetic fiction. In old\r\ndays the Sybarites slept upon mattresses which were stuffed with\r\nRose petals: and the like are now made for persons of rank on the\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nA memorial brass over the tomb of Abbot Kirton, in Westminster\r\nAbbey, bears testimony to the high value he attached during life to\r\nRoses curatively:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sis, Rosa, flos florum, morbis medicina meoium.\"\r\n\r\nMany country persons believe, that if Roses and Violets are\r\nplentiful in the autumn, some epidemic may be expected presently.\r\nBut this conclusion must be founded like that which says, \"a green\r\nwinter makes a fat churchyard,\" on the fact that humid warmth\r\ncontinued on late in the year tends to engender putrid ferments, and\r\nto weaken the bodily vigour.\r\n\r\nAttar of Roses is a costly product, because consisting of the\r\ncomparatively few oil globules found floating on the surface of a\r\nconsiderable volume of Rose water thrice distilled. It takes five\r\nhundredweight of Rose petals to produce one drachm by weight of\r\nthe finest Attar, which is preserved in small bottles made of rock\r\ncrystal. The scent of the minutest particle of the genuine essence is\r\nvery powerful and enduring:--\r\n\r\n    \"You may break, you may ruin, the vase if you will,\r\n    But the scent of the Roses will hang round it still.\"\r\n\r\nThe inscription, _Rosamundi, non Rosa munda,_ was graven on the\r\ntomb of fair Rosamund, the inamorata of Henry the Seventh:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hic jacet in tomba Rosa Mundi, non Rosa munda;\r\n    Non redolet, sed olet quae redolere solet.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Here Rose the graced, not Rose the chaste, reposes;\r\n    The smell that rises is no smell of Roses.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sussex, the peculiar excrescence which is often found on the\r\nBriar, as caused by the puncture of an insect, and which is known as\r\nthe canker, or \"robin redbreast's cushion,\" is frequently worn round\r\nthe neck as a protective amulet against whooping cough. This was\r\ncalled in the old Pharmacopeias \"Bedeguar,\" and was famous for its\r\nastringent properties. Hans Andersen names it the \"Rose King's\r\nbeard.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rosary was introduced by St. Dominick to commemorate his\r\nhaving been shown a chaplet of Roses by the Blessed Virgin. It\r\nconsisted formerly of a string of beads made of Rose leaves tightly\r\npressed into round moulds and strung together, when real Roses\r\ncould not be had. The use of a chaplet of beads for recording the\r\nnumber of prayers recited is of Eastern origin from the time of the\r\nEgyptian Anchorites.\r\n\r\nThe Rock Rose (a _Cistus_), grows commonly in our hilly pastures on\r\na soil of chalk, or gravel, bearing clusters of large, bright, yellow\r\nflowers, from a small branching shrub. These flowers expand only\r\nin the sunshine, and have stamens which, if lightly touched, spread\r\nout, and lie down on the petals. The plant proves medicinally useful,\r\nparticularly if grown in a soil containing magnesia. A tincture is\r\nprepared (H.) from the whole plant, English or Canadian, which is\r\nuseful for curing shingles, on the principle of its producing, when\r\ntaken by healthy provers in doses of various [470] potencies, a\r\ncutaneous outbreak on the trunk of the body closely resembling the\r\ncharacteristic symptoms of shingles, whilst attended with nervous\r\ndistress, and with much burning of the affected skin. The plant has\r\nlikewise a popular reputation for healing scrofula, and its tincture is\r\nbeneficial for reducing enlarged glands, as of the neck and throat;\r\nalso for strumous swelling of the knee joint, as well as of other\r\njoints. It is a \"helianthemum\" of the Sunflower tribe.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian Rock Rose is called Frostwort and Frostweed,\r\nbecause crystals of ice shoot from the cracked bark below the stem\r\nduring freezing weather in the autumn.\r\n\r\nA decoction of our plant has proved useful in prurigo (itching), and\r\nas a gargle for the sore throat of scarlet fever. For shingles, from\r\nfive to ten drops of the tincture, third decimal strength, should be\r\ngiven with a spoonful of water three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSEMARY.\r\n\r\nThe Rosemary is a well-known, sweet-scented shrub, cultivated in\r\nour gardens, and herb beds on account of its fragrancy and its\r\naromatic virtues. It came originally from the South of Europe and\r\nthe Levant, and was introduced into England before the Norman\r\nConquest. The shrub (_Rosmarinus_) takes its compound name\r\nfrom _ros_, dew, _marinus_, belonging to the sea; in allusion to the\r\ngrey, glistening appearance of the plant, and its natural locality, as\r\nwell as its odour, like that of the sea. It is ever green, and bears\r\nsmall, pale, blue flowers.\r\n\r\nRosemary was thought by the ancients to refresh the memory and\r\ncomfort the brain. Being a cordial herb it was often mentioned in the\r\nlays, or amorous ballads, of the Troubadours; and was called\r\n\"Coronaria\" [471] because women were accustomed to make\r\ncrowns and garlands thereof.\r\n\r\n    \"What flower is that which regal honour craves?\r\n    Adjoin the Virgin: and 'tis strewn o'er graves.\"\r\n\r\nIn some parts of England Rosemary is put with the corpse into the\r\ncoffin, and sprigs of it are distributed among the mourners at a\r\nfuneral, to be thrown into the grave, Gay alludes to this practice\r\nwhen describing the burial of a country lass who had met with an\r\nuntimely death:--\r\n\r\n    \"To show their love, the neighbours far and near\r\n    Followed, with wistful looks, the damsel's bier;\r\n    Sprigged Rosemary the lads and lasses bore,\r\n    While dismally the Parson walked before;\r\n    Upon her grave the Rosemary they threw,\r\n    The Daisy, Butter flower, and Endive blue,\"\r\n\r\nIn _Romeo and Juliet_, Father Lawrence says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dry up your tears, and stick your Rosemary\r\n    On this fair corse.\"\r\n\r\nThe herb has a pleasant scent and a bitter, pungent taste, whilst\r\nmuch of its volatile, active principle resides in the calices of the\r\nflowers; therefore, in storing or using the plant these parts must be\r\nretained. It yields its virtues partially to water, and entirely to\r\nrectified spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nIn early times Rosemary was grown largely in kitchen gardens, and\r\nit came to signify the strong influence of the matron who dwelt\r\nthere:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where Rosemary flourishes the woman rules,\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves and tops afford an essential volatile oil, but not so much\r\nas the flowers.\r\n\r\nA spirit made from this essential oil with spirit of wine will help to\r\nrenovate the vitality of paralyzed limbs, if rubbed in with brisk\r\nfriction. The volatile oil [472] includes a special camphor similar to\r\nthat possessed by the myrtle. The plant also contains some tannin,\r\nwith a resin and a bitter principle. By old writers it was said to\r\nincrease the flow of milk.\r\n\r\nThe oil is used officinally for making a spirit of Rosemary, and is\r\nadded to the compound tincture of Lavender, as well as to Soap\r\nliniment. By common consent it is agreed that the volatile oil (or the\r\nspirit) when mixed in washes will specially stimulate growth of the\r\nhair. The famous Hungary water, first concocted for a Queen of\r\nHungary who, by its continual use, became effectually cured of\r\nparalysis, was prepared by putting a pound and a half of the fresh\r\ntops of Rosemary, when in full flower, into a gallon of proof spirit,\r\nwhich had to stand for four days, and was then distilled.\r\n\r\nHungary water (_l'eau de la reine d'Hongrie_) was formerly very\r\nfamous for gout in the hands and feet. Hoyes says, the formula for\r\ncomposing this water, written by Queen Elizabeth's own hand in\r\ngolden characters, is still preserved in the Imperial Library at\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nAn ounce of the dried leaves and flowers treated with a pint of\r\nboiling water, and allowed to stand until cold, makes one of the best\r\nhair washes known. It has the singular power of preventing the hair\r\nfrom uncurling when exposed to a damp atmosphere. The herb is\r\nused in the preparation of _Eau de Cologne_.\r\n\r\nRosemary wine, taken in small quantities, acts as a quieting cordial\r\nto a heart of which the action is excitable or palpitating, and it\r\nrelieves ally accompanying dropsy by stimulating the kidneys. This\r\nwine may be made by chopping up sprigs of Rosemary, and pouring\r\non them some sound white wine, which after two or [473] three\r\ndays, may be strained off and used. By stimulating the nervous\r\nsystem it proves useful against the headaches of weak circulation\r\nand of languid health. \"If a garlande of the tree be put around the\r\nheade it is a remedy for the stuffing of the head that cometh from\r\ncoldness.\"\r\n\r\nThe green-leaved variety of Rosemary is the sort to be used\r\nmedicinally. There are also silver and gold-leaved diversities. Sprigs\r\nof the herb were formerly stuck into beef whilst roasting as an\r\nexcellent relish. A writer of 1707 tells of \"Rosemary-preserve to\r\ndress your beef.\"\r\n\r\nThe toilet of the Ancients was never considered complete without\r\nan infusion, or spirit of Rosemary; and in olden times Rosemary\r\nwas entwined in the wreath worn by the bride at the altar, being first\r\ndipped in scented water. Anne of Cleves, one of Henry the Eighth's\r\nwives, wore such a wreath at her wedding; and when people could\r\nafford it, the Rosemary branch presented to each guest was richly\r\ngilded.\r\n\r\nThe custom which prevailed in olden times of carrying a sprig of\r\nRosemary in the hand at a funeral, took its rise from the notion of an\r\nalexipharmick or preservative powder in this herb against\r\npestilential disorders; and hence it was thought that the smelling\r\nthereof was a powerful defence against any morbid effluvia from the\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason it was usual to burn Rosemary in the chambers\r\nof the sick, just as was formerly done with frankincense, which gave\r\nthe Greeks occasion to call the Rosemary _Libanotis_. In the French\r\nlanguage of flowers this herb represents the power of rekindling lost\r\nenergy. \"The flowers of Rosemary,\" says an old author, \"made up\r\ninto plates (lozenges), with sugar, [474] and eaten, comfort the\r\nheart, and make it merry, quicken the spirits, and make them more\r\nlively.\" \"There's Rosemary for you--that's for remembrance! Pray\r\nyou, love, remember!\" says Ophelia in _Hamlet_. The spirit of\r\nRosemary is kept by all druggists, and may be safely taken in doses\r\nof from twenty to thirty drops with a spoonful or two of water.\r\nRosemary tea will soon relieve hysterical depression. Some persons\r\ndrink it as a restorative at breakfast. It will help to regulate the\r\nmonthly flow of women. An infusion of the herb mixed with poplar\r\nbark, and used every night, will make the hair soft, glossy, and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Ireland is found the Wild Rosemary, or Marsh Tea\r\n(_Ledum palustre_), which has admirable curative uses, and from\r\nwhich, therefore, though it is not a common plant in England, a\r\nmedicinal tincture (H.) is made with spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nThe herb belongs to the Rock Rose tribe, and contains citric acid,\r\nleditannic acid, resin, wax, and a volatile principle called\r\n\"ericinol.\"\r\n\r\nThis plant is of singular use as a remedy for chilblains, as well as to\r\nsubdue the painful effects of a sting from a wasp or bee; also to\r\nrelieve gouty pains, which attack severely, but do not cause swelling\r\nof the part, especially as regards the fingers and toes. Four or five\r\ndrops of the tincture should be taken for a dose with a tablespoonful\r\nof cold water, three or four times in the day; and linen rags soaked\r\nin a lotion made with a teaspoonful of the tincture added to half a\r\ntumblerful of cold water, should be kept applied over the affected\r\npart.\r\n\r\nIt equally relieves whitlows; and will heal punctured wounds, if\r\narnica, or the Marigold, or St. John's Wort is not indicated, or of\r\nuse. When tested by provers in large doses, it has caused a\r\nwidespread eruption of [475] eczema, with itching and tingling of\r\nthe whole skin, extending into the mouth and air passages, and\r\noccasioning a violent spasmodic cough. Hence, one may fairly\r\nassume (and this has been found to hold good), that a gouty,\r\nspasmodic cough of the bronchial tubes, attended with gouty\r\neczema, and with pains in the smaller joints, will be generally cured\r\nby tincture or infusion of the Wild Rosemary in small doses of a\r\ndiluted strength, given several times a day, the diet at the same time\r\nbeing properly regulated. Formerly this herb was used in Germany\r\nfor making beer heady; but it is now forbidden by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUE.\r\n\r\nThe wild Rue is found on the hills of Lancashire and Yorkshire,\r\nbeing more vehement in smell and in operation than the garden Rue.\r\nThis latter, _Ruta graveolens,_ (powerfully redolent), the common\r\ncultivated Rue of our kitchen gardens, is a shrub with a pungent\r\naromatic odour, and a bitter, hot, penetrating taste, having leaves of\r\na bluish-green colour, and remaining verdant all the year round. It is\r\nfirst mentioned as cultivated in England by Turner, in his _Herbal_,\r\n1562, and has since become one of the best known and most widely\r\ngrown Simples for medicinal and homely uses. The name _Ruta_ is\r\nfrom the Greek _reuo_, to set free, because this herb is so efficacious\r\nin various diseases. The Greeks regarded Rue as an anti-magical\r\nherb, since it served to remedy the nervous indigestion and\r\nflatulence from which they suffered when eating before strangers:\r\nwhich infirmity they attributed to witchcraft. This herb was further\r\ntermed of old \"Serving men's joy,\" because of the multiplicity of\r\ncommon ailments which it was warranted to cure. It constituted a\r\nchief ingredient of the famous antidote of Mithridates to poisons,\r\nthe formula of which [476] was found by Pompey in the satchel of\r\nthe conquered King. The leaves are so acrid, that if they be much\r\nhandled they inflame the skin; and the wild plant possesses this\r\nacridity still more strongly.\r\n\r\nWater serves to extract the virtues of the cultivated shrub better than\r\nspirit of wine is able to do. The juice of Rue is of great efficacy in\r\nsome forms of epilepsy, operating for the most part insensibly,\r\nthough sometimes causing vomiting or purging.\r\n\r\nPiperno, a Neapolitan physician, in 1625, commended Rue as a\r\nspecific against epilepsy and vertigo. For the former malady at one\r\ntime some of this herb was suspended round the neck of the\r\nsufferer, whilst \"forsaking the devil with all his works, and invoking\r\nthe Lord Jesus.\" Goat's Rue, _Galega_, is likewise of service in\r\nepilepsy and convulsions.\r\n\r\nIf a leaf or two of Rue be chewed, a refreshing aromatic flavour will\r\npervade the mouth, and any nervous headache, giddiness, hysterical\r\nspasm, or palpitation, will be quickly relieved. Two drachms of\r\npowdered Rue, if taken every day regularly as a dose for a long\r\nwhile together, will often do wonders. It was much used by the\r\nancients, and Hippocrates commended it. The herb is strongly\r\nstimulating and anti-spasmodic; its most important constituent being\r\nthe volatile oil, which contains caprinic, pelargonic, caprylic, and\r\noenanthylic acids. The oxygenated portion is caprinic aldehyde. In\r\ntoo full doses the oil causes aching of the loins, frequent urination,\r\ndulness and weight of mind, flushes of heat, unsteadiness of gait,\r\nand increased frequency of the pulse, but with diminished force.\r\nSimilar symptoms are produced during an attack of the modern\r\nepidemical influenza; as like-wise by oil of wormwood, and some\r\nother essential oils.\r\n\r\n[477] Externally, Rue is an active irritant to the skin, the bruised\r\nleaves blistering the hands, and causing a pustular eruption. Gerard\r\nsays, \"The wild Rue venometh the hands that touch it, and will also\r\ninfect the face; therefore it is not to be admitted to meat, or\r\nmedicine.\" It stimulates the monthly function in women, but must\r\nbe used with caution.\r\n\r\nThe decoction and infusion are to be made from the fresh plant, or\r\n(when this plant cannot be got), the oil may be given in a dose of\r\nfrom one to five drops. Externally, compresses saturated with a\r\nstrong decoction of the plant when applied to the chest, have been\r\nused beneficially for chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nRue is best adapted to those of phlegmatic habit, and of languid\r\nconstitutional energies. It is often employed in the form of tea. The\r\n_Schola Salernitana_ says about this plant:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ruta viris minuit venerem, mulieribus addit\r\n    Ruta facit castum, dat lumen, et ingerit astum\r\n    Coctaque ruta facit de pulicibus loca tuta.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Rue maketh chaste: and eke preserveth sight;\r\n    Infuseth wit, and putteth fleas to flight.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves promote the menses, being given in doses of from fifteen\r\nto twenty grains. \"Pliny,\" says John Evelyn, \"reports Rue to be of\r\nsuch effect for the preservation of sight that the painters of his time\r\nused to devour a great quantity of it; and the herb is still eaten by\r\nthe Italians frequently mingled amongst their salads.\" With respect to\r\nits use in epilepsy, Julius Caesar Baricellus said: \"I gave to my own\r\nchildren two scruples of the juice of Rue, and a small matter of\r\ngold; and, by the blessing of God, they were freed from their fits.\"\r\nThe essential oil of Rue may be used for the same purpose, and in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\n[478] Formerly this plant was thought to bestow second sight; and\r\nso sacred a regard was at one time felt for it in our islands, that the\r\nmissionaries sprinkled their holy water from brushes made of the\r\nRue; for which cause it was named \"Herb of Grace.\"\r\n\r\nGerard tells us: \"The garden Rue, which is better than the wild Rue\r\nfor physic's use, grows most profitably (as Dioscorides said) under a\r\nfig tree.\" Country people boil its leaves with treacle, thus making a\r\nconserve of them. These leaves are curative of croup in poultry.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the present century it was customary for judges,\r\nsitting at Assize, to have sprigs of Rue placed on the bench of the\r\ndock, as defensive against the pestilential infection brought into\r\ncourt from gaol by the prisoners. The herb was supposed to afford\r\npowerful protection from contagion.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the medicinal tincture (H.) is used for the\r\ntreatment of rheumatism when developed in the membranes which\r\ninvest the bones. If bruised and applied, the leaves will ease the\r\nsevere pain of sciatica. The expressed juice taken in small quantities\r\nis a noted remedy for nervous nightmare. A quaint old rhyme says\r\nof the plant:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nobilis est ruta quia lumina reddit acuta.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Noble is Rue! it makes the sight of eyes both sharp and clear;\r\n    With help of Rue, oh! blear-eyed man I thou shalt see far and\r\n    near.\"\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the case when the vision has become dim through\r\nover exertion of the eyes. It was with \"Euphrasy and Rue\" the visual\r\nnerve of Adam was purged by Milton's Angel.\r\n\r\nAs a preserver of chastity Ophelia was made by Shakespeare to give\r\nRue to Hamlet's mother, the Queen of Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[479] RUSHES.\r\n\r\nThe true Rushes (_Juncaceoe_) include the Soft Rush (_effusus_);\r\nthe Hard Rush (_glaucus_); and the Common Rush (_conglomeratus_).\r\nThe Bulrush (Pool Rush) is a Sedge; the Club Rush is a Typha;\r\nand the flowering Rush, a Butomus. \"Rish\" was the old method\r\nof spelling the name.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture is made (H.) from the fresh root of the _juncus\r\neffusus_. It will be found helpful against spinal irritability, with\r\nsome crampy tightness felt in the arms and legs, together with\r\nheadache and flatulent indigestion. Four or five drops should be\r\ngiven for a dose, with a spoonful of water, three or four times in the\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis, the Soft Rush, is commonly used for tying the bines of hops to\r\nthe poles; and, as these bines grow larger in size, the rushes wither,\r\nsetting the bines free in a timely fashion. To find a green-topped\r\nSeave, or Rush, and a four-leaved Clover, is, in rural estimation,\r\nequally lucky.\r\n\r\nThe generic title, _Juncus_, has been applied because Rushes are _in\r\nconjunction_ when planted together for making cordage.\r\n\r\nThe common Rush is found by roadsides in damp pastures, and is\r\nreadily known by its long, slender, round, naked stem, containing\r\npith, and showing about the middle of July a dense globular bead of\r\nbrown flowers. Rushes of this sort were employed by our remote\r\nancestors for strewing, when fresh and green, about the floor of the\r\nhall after discontinuing its big fire at Eastertide. Shakespeare says\r\nin _Romeo and Juliet:_--\r\n\r\n    \"Wantons, light of heart,\r\n    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.\"\r\n\r\n[480] In obedience to a bequest (1494); Rushes are still\r\nstrewn about the pavement of Redcliff Church at Bristol every\r\nWhit-Sunday. The common phrase, \"not worth a Rush,\" took its origin\r\nfrom this general practice. Distinguished guests were honoured in\r\nmediaeval times with clean fresh Rushes; but those of inferior rank\r\nhad either the Rushes left by their superiors, or none at all.\r\n\r\nThe sweet-scented \"Flag,\" or Rush (_Acorus calamus_), was always\r\nused by preference where it could be procured. It is a native of this\r\ncountry, growing on watery banks, and very plentiful in the river's\r\nof Norfolk, from whence the London market is supplied. The roots\r\nhave a warm, bitter taste, and the essential oil is highly aromatic,\r\nthis being used for preparing aromatic vinegar. In Norfolk the\r\npowdered dry rhizome is given for ague. With sugar it makes an\r\nagreeable cordial conserve. (See _Flag (Sweet)_, _page_ 201 ). For\r\npreserving the aromatic qualities within the dried rhizome; or root, it\r\nshould be kept in stock unpeeled. This contains \"oleum calami,\" and\r\nthe bitter principle \"acorin.\" Some of the root may be habitually\r\nchewed for the relief of chronic indigestion. The odorous delights of\r\na pastoral time passed near these sweetly-fragrant plants have been\r\nhappily alluded to in the well-known lines of idyllic verse:--\r\n\r\n    \"Green grow the Rushes, oh!\r\n    Green grow the Rushes, oh!\r\n    The sweetest hours that e'er I spent\r\n    Were spent among the lasses, oh!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Virent junci fluviales,\r\n    Junci prope lymphas:\r\n    Ah! quain ridet quoe me videt\r\n    Hora inter Nymphas!\"\r\n\r\n[481] The old saying, \"As fit as Tib's Rush for Tom's fore-finger,\"\r\nalludes to an ancient custom of making spurious marriages with a\r\nring constructed from a Rush. Tom and Tib were vulgar epithets\r\napplied in Shakespeare's time to the rogue, and the wanton.\r\n\r\nThe Bulrush (_Scirpus lacustris_) is a tall, aquatic plant, which\r\nbelongs to the Sedge tribe. It name was formerly spelt \"Pole Rush,\"\r\nand was given because this grows in pools of water, and not like\r\nother Rushes, in mire. Bottoms of chairs are frequently made with\r\nits stems. Its seed is prepared medicinally, being astringent and\r\nsomewhat sedative; \"So soporiferous,\" says Gerard, \"that care must\r\nbe had in the administration thereof, lest in provoking sleep you\r\ninduce a drowsiness, or dead sleep.\" Street hawkers, in Autumn,\r\noffer as Bulrushes the tall, round spikes of the Great Reed Mace,\r\nwhich is not a true Rush. Artists are responsible in the first instance\r\nfor the mistake--notably Paul De la Roche, in his famous picture of\r\n\"The Finding of Moses.\" The future great leader of the Israelites is\r\nthere depicted in an ark amid a forest of Great Cat's-tail Reeds.\r\n\r\nThe flowering Rush, or water gladiole, which grows by the banks of\r\nrivers is called botanically \"butomus,\" from the Greek, _bous_, an\r\nox, and _temno_, to cut, because the sharp edges of the erect\r\nthree-cornered leaf-blades wound the cattle which come in contact with\r\nthem, or try to eat them. Its root is highly esteemed in Russia for the\r\ncure of hydrophobia, being regarded by the doctors as a specific for\r\nthat disease. Its flowers are large, and of a splendid rose colour. The\r\nseeds promote the monthly flow in women, act on disordered\r\nkidneys, prove astringent against fluxes, and serve to woo sleep in\r\nnervous wakefulness. Gerard tells that \"the seed [482] of Rushes\r\ndrieth the overmuch flowing of women's termes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reed Mace, or Cat's-tail, is often incorrectly called Bulrush,\r\nthough it is a typha (_tuphos_, marsh) plant.\r\n\r\nThe Bog Asphodel (_Narthecium ossifragum_) grows in bogs, and\r\nbears a spike of yellow, star-like flowers. Its second nominative was\r\ngiven to signify its causing the bones of cattle which feed thereon\r\nto become soft; but probably this morbid state is incurred rather\r\nthrough the exhalations arising from the bogs where the cattle are\r\npastured. To the same plant has been given also the name \"Mayden\r\nheere,\" because young damsels formerly used it for making their\r\nhair yellow.\r\n\r\nThe Great Cat's-tail (_Typha palustris_), or Great Reed Mace, a\r\nperennial reed common in Great Britain, affords by the tender white\r\npart of its stalks when peeled near the root, a crisp, cooling,\r\npleasant article of food. This is eaten raw with avidity by the\r\nCossacks. Aristophanes makes mention of the Mace in his comedy of\r\nfrogs who were glad to have spent their day skipping about _inter\r\nCyperum et Phleum_, among Galingale and Cat's-tail. Sacred\r\npictures which represent our Saviour wearing the crown of thorns,\r\nplace this reed in His hands as given Him in mockery for a kingly\r\nMace. The same _Typha_ has been further called \"Dunse-down,\"\r\nfrom making persons \"dunch,\" or deaf, if its soft spikes accidentally\r\nrun into the ears. \"_Ejus enim paniculoe flos si aures intraverit,\r\nexsurdat_.\" It is reasonable to suppose that, on the principle of\r\nsimilars, a preparation of this plant, if applied topically within the\r\near, as well as taken medicinally, will be curative of a like deafness.\r\nMost probably the injury to the hearing caused by the spikes at first\r\nis toxic as well as of the nature of an injury. The Poet Laureate sings\r\nof \"Sleepy breath made sweet [483] with Galingale\" (_Cyperus\r\nlongus_). Other names again are, \"Chimney-sweeper's brush\";\r\n\"Blackheads\" until ripe, then \"Whiteheads\"; and \"Water torch,\"\r\nbecause its panicles, if soaked in oil, will burn like a torch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFFRON (Meadow and Cultivated).\r\n\r\nThe Meadow Saffron (_Colchicum autumnale_) is a common wild\r\nCrocus found in English meadows, especially about the Midland\r\ndistricts. The flower appears in the autumn before the leaves and\r\nfruit, which are not produced until the following spring. Its corollae\r\nresemble those of the true Saffron, a native of the East, but long\r\ncultivated in Great Britain, where it is sometimes found apparently\r\nwild. They are plants of the Iris order.\r\n\r\nFrom the Meadow Saffron is obtained a corm or bulb, dug up in the\r\nspring, of which the well-known tincture of colchicum, a specific\r\nfor rheumatism, is made; and from the true Saffron flowers are\r\ntaken the familiar orange red stigmata, which furnish the fragrant\r\ncolouring matter used by confectioners in cakes, and by the\r\napothecary for his syrup of Saffron, etc.\r\n\r\nThe flower of the Meadow Saffron rises bare from the earth, and is,\r\ntherefore, called \"Upstart\" and \"Naked Lady.\" This plant owes its\r\nbotanical name _Colchicum_, to Colchis, in Natalia, which\r\nabounded in poisonous vegetables, and gave rise to the fiction about\r\nthe enchantress Medea. She renewed the vitality of her aged father,\r\nAEneas, by drawing blood out of his veins and refilling them with\r\nthe juices of certain herbs. The fabled origin of the Saffron plant ran\r\nthus. A certain young man named Crocus went to play at quoits in a\r\nfield with Mercurie, when the quoit of his companion happened by\r\nmisfortune to hit him on the head, whereby, before long, he died, to\r\nthe great sorrow of [484] his friends. Finally, in the place where he\r\nhad bled, Saffron was found to be growing: whereupon, the people,\r\nseeing the colour of the chine as it stood, adjusted it to come of the\r\nblood of Crocus, and therefore they gave it his name. The medicinal\r\nproperties of Colchicum have been known from a very early period.\r\nIn the reign of James the First (1615), Sir Theodore Mayerne\r\nadministered the bulb to his majesty together with the powder of\r\nunburied skulls. In France, it has always been a favourite specific\r\nfor gout; and during the reign of Louis the Fifteenth, it became very\r\nfashionable under the name of _Eau Medicinale_; but the remedy is\r\nsomewhat dangerous, and should never be incautiously used.\r\nInstances are on record where fatal results have followed too large a\r\nmedicinal dose, even on the following day, after taking sixty drops\r\nof the wine of Colchicum overnight; and when given in much\r\nsmaller doses it sometimes acts as a powerfully irritating purgative,\r\nor as an emetic. The medicine should not be employed except by a\r\ndoctor; its habitual use is very harmful.\r\n\r\nThe acrimony of the bulb may be modified in a measure if it, or its\r\nseeds, are steeped in vinegar before being taken as a medicine.\r\n\r\nThe French designate the roots of the Meadow Saffron (_Colchicum_)\r\nas \"_Tue-chien_\"; \"_morte aux chiens_,\" \"death to dogs.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles, a Greek physician of the sixth century, was\r\nthe first to advise Colchicum (_Hermodactylon_) for gout, with the\r\neffect that patients, immediately after its exhibition, found\r\nthemselves able to walk. \"But,\" said he, and with shrewd truth, \"it\r\nhas this bad property, that it disposes those who take it curatively\r\nfor gout or rheumatism, to be afterwards more frequently attacked\r\nwith the disease than before.\"\r\n\r\n[485] Our druggists supply an officinal tincture of Colchicum\r\n(Meadow Saffron) made from the seeds, the dose of which is from\r\nten to thirty drops, with a spoonful of water; also a wine infused\r\nfrom the bulb, of which the dose is the same as that of the tincture,\r\ntwice or three times a day; and an acetous extract prepared from the\r\nthickened juice of the crushed bulbs, of which from half to two\r\ngrains may be given in a pilule, or dissolved in water, twice or three\r\ntimes a day, until the active symptoms are subdued, and then less\r\noften for another day or two afterwards. The most important\r\nchemical constituent of the bulb, flowers, and seeds, is \"Colchicin.\"\r\nBesides this there are contained starch, gum, sugar, tannin, and\r\nsome fatty resinous matter. There is also a fixed oil in the seeds.\r\n\r\n_Crocus vernus_, the True Saffron, grows wild about Halifax, and\r\nin the neighbourhood of Derby; but for commercial uses the supply\r\nof stigmata is had from Greece, and Asia Minor. This plant was\r\ncultivated in England as far back as during the reign of Edward the\r\nThird. It is said that a pilgrim then brought from the Levant to\r\nEngland the first root of Saffron, concealed in a hollow staff, doing\r\nthe same thing at the peril of his life, and planting such root at\r\nSaffron Walden, in Essex, whence the place has derived its name.\r\n\r\nThe stigmata are picked out, then dried in a kiln, over a hair cloth,\r\nand pressed afterwards into cakes, of which the aromatic quality is\r\nvery volatile. The plant was formerly cultivated at Saffron Walden,\r\nwhere it was presented in silver cups by the Corporation to some of\r\nour sovereigns, who visited Walden for the ceremony. Five guineas\r\nwere paid by the Corporation for the pound of Saffron which they\r\npurchased for Queen Elizabeth; and to constitute this quantity forty\r\n[486] thousand flowers were required. The City Arms of Walden\r\nbears three Saffron plants, as given by a Charter of Edward the\r\nSixth. Saffron Hill, in Holborn, London, belonged formerly to Ely\r\nHouse, and got its name from the crops of saffron which were\r\ngrown there: \"_Occult? Spolia hi Croceo de colle ferebant_\" (Comic\r\nLatin Grammar).\r\n\r\nIn our rural districts there is a popular custom of giving Saffron tea\r\nin measles, on the doctrine of colour analogy; to which notion may\r\nlikewise be referred the practice of adding Saffron to the drinking\r\nwater of canaries when they are moulting.\r\n\r\nIn England, it was fashionable during the seventh century to make\r\nuse of starch stained yellow with Saffron; and in an old cookery\r\nbook of that period, it is directed that \"Saffron must be put into all\r\nLenten soups, sauces, and dishes; also that without Saffron we\r\ncannot have well-cooled peas.\" Confectioners were wont to make\r\ntheir pastry attractive with Saffron. So the Clown says in\r\nShakespeare's _Winter's Tale_, \"I must have Saffron to colour the\r\nwarden pies.\" We read of a Saffron-tub in the kitchen of Bishop\r\nSwinfield, 1296. During the fourteenth century Saffron was\r\ncultivated in the herbarium of the manor-house, and the castle.\r\nThroughout Devonshire this product is quoted to signify anything\r\ncostly.\r\n\r\nHenry the Eighth forbade persons to colour with Saffron the long\r\nlocks of hair worn then, and called Glibbes. Lord Bacon said, \"the\r\nEnglish are rendered sprightly by a liberal use of Saffron in\r\nsweetmeats and broth\": also, \"Saffron conveys medicine to the\r\nheart, cures its palpitation, removes melancholy and uneasiness,\r\nrevives the brain, renders the mind cheerful, and generates\r\nboldness.\" The restorative plant has been termed \"_Cor hominis_;\"\r\n\"_Anima_ [487] _pulmonum_,\" \"the Heart of Man\"; and there is an\r\nold saying alluding to one of a merry temper, \"_Dormivit in sacco\r\nCroci_,\" \"he has slept in a sack of Saffron.\" It was called by the\r\nancients \"_Aurum philosophorum_,\" contracted to \"_Aroph_.\" Also,\r\n_Sanguis Herculis_, and _Rex Vegetabilium_, \"being given with\r\ngood success to procure bodily lust.\" The English word Saffron\r\ncomes from the Arabian--_Zahafram_--whilst the name Crocus of\r\nthis golden plant is taken from the Greek_ krokee_--a thread--\r\nsignifying the dry thin stigmata of the flower. Old Fuller wrote \"the\r\nCrocodile's tears are never true save when he is forced where\r\nSaffron groweth (whence he hath his name of _Croco-deilos_, or the\r\nSaffron-fearer), knowing himself to be all poison, and it all\r\nantidote.\" Frequently Marigold stigmata are cheaply used for\r\nadulterating the true Saffron.\r\n\r\nHomer introduces Saffron as one of the flowers which formed the\r\nnuptial couch of Jupiter: and Solomon mentioned it as growing in\r\nhis garden: \"Spikenard and saffron: calamus, and cinnamon\"\r\n(_Canticles_ iv., 14). Pliny states that wine in which Saffron was\r\nmacerated gave a fragrant odour to theatres about which it was\r\nsprinkled. The Cilician doctors advised Cleopatra to take Saffron for\r\nclearing her complexion.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal use of Saffron has always obtained amongst the\r\nOrientals. According to a treatise, _Croco-logia_ (1670), by\r\nHartodt, it was then employed as a medicine, as a pigment, and for\r\nseasoning various kinds of food. The colouring matter of Saffron is\r\na substance called polychroite, or crocin; and its slightly stimulating\r\nproperties depend upon a volatile oil.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave said that Saffron possesses the power of liquefying the\r\nblood; hence, \"Women who use it too freely suffer from immoderate\r\nmenses.\" A tincture is [488] made (H.) from the Saffron of\r\ncommerce, which is of essential use for controlling female\r\nhaemorrhages. Four or five drops of the tincture may be given with a\r\nspoonful of water every three or four hours for this purpose. The\r\nsame tincture is good for impaired vision, when there is a sense of\r\ngauze before the eyes, which the person tries to wink, or wipe away.\r\nSmelling strongly and frequently at the Hay Saffron of commerce\r\n(obtained from Spain and France), will cause headache, stupor, and\r\nheavy sleep; whilst, during its internal use, the urine becomes of a\r\ndeep yellow colour.\r\n\r\nOf the syrup of Saffron, which is a slightly stimulating exhilarant,\r\nand which possesses a rich colour, from one to two teaspoonfuls\r\nmay be given for a dose, with two tablespoonfuls of cold water. It\r\nserves to energise the organs within the middle trunk of both males\r\nand females; also to recruit an exhausted brain.\r\n\r\nIn Devonshire, Saffron used to be regarded as a most valuable\r\nremedy to restore consumptive patients, even when far advanced in\r\nthe disease, and it was, therefore, esteemed of great worth:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nec poteris croci dotes numerare, nec usus.\"\r\n\r\nSaffron is such a special remedy for those that have consumption of\r\nthe lungs, and are--as we term it--at death's door, and almost past\r\nbreathing, \"that it bringeth breath again, and prolongeth life for\r\ncertain days, if ten, or twenty grains at most, be given in new, or\r\nsweet wine. It presently, and in a moment, removeth away difficulty\r\nof breathing, which most dangerously and suddenly happeneth.\"\r\n\r\nIn Westphalia, an apple mixed with Saffron, on the doctrine of\r\nsignatures, is given on Easter Monday, against jaundice. Evelyn\r\ntells us: \"The German [489] housewives have a way of forming\r\nSaffron into balls; by mingling it with a little honey, which, when\r\nthoroughly dried, they reduce to powder, and sprinkle it over their\r\nsallets for a noble cordial.\" Those of Spain and Italy, we know,\r\ngenerally make use of this flower, mingling its golden tincture with\r\nalmost everything they eat. But, an excessive use of Saffron proves\r\nharmful. It will produce an intense pain in the head, and imperil the\r\nreason. Half-a-scruple, _i.e._, ten grains, should be the largest dose.\r\nIn fuller doses this tincture will provoke a determination of blood to\r\nthe head, with bleeding from the nose, and sometimes with a\r\ndisposition to immoderate laughter. Small doses, therefore, of the\r\ndiluted tincture, ought to relieve these symptoms when they occur as\r\nspontaneous illness. The inhabitants of Eastern countries regard\r\nSaffron as a fine restorative, and nuptial invitations are often\r\npowdered by them with this medicament.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland women dye their sheets with Saffron to preserve them\r\nfrom vermin, and to strengthen their own limbs.\r\n\r\n    \"Green herbs, red pepper, mussels, _Saffron_,\r\n        Soles, onions, garlic, roach and dace;\r\n    All these you eat at Ferre's tavern\r\n        In that one dish of bouillabaisse.\"\r\n                            --_Thackeray_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAGE.\r\n\r\nOur garden Sage, a familiar occupant of the English herb bed, was\r\nformerly celebrated as a medicine of great virtue. This was the\r\n_Elalisphakos_ of the Greeks, so called from its dry and withered\r\nlooking leaves. It grows wild in the South of Europe, but is a\r\ncultivated Simple in England, France, and Germany. Like other\r\nlabiate herbs [490] it is aromatic and fragrant, because containing a\r\nvolatile, camphoraceous, essential oil.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant have a strong-scented odour, and a warm,\r\nbitter, astringent taste. The Latin name, _Salvia_, has become\r\ncorrupted through _Sauja_, _sauge_, to Sage, and is derived from\r\n_salvere_, \"to be sound,\" in reference to the medicinally curative\r\nproperties of the plant.\r\n\r\nA well-known monkish line about it ran to this effect: _Cur moriatur\r\nhomo cui Salvia crescit in horto_? \"Why should a man die whilst\r\nSage grows in his garden?\" And even at this time, in many parts of\r\nEngland, the following piece of advice is carefully adopted every\r\nyear:--\r\n\r\n    \"He that would live for aye\r\n    Must eat Sage in May.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the time of Charlemagne, the school of Salerno thought so\r\nhighly of Sage that they originated the dictum quoted above of\r\nSaracenic old pharmacy, but they wisely added a second line:--\r\n\r\n    \"Contra vim mortis non est medicamen in hortis.\"\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of the herb may be more readily dissolved in a\r\nspirituous than in a watery vehicle. Of this, the active principle is\r\n\"salviol,\" which confers the power of resisting putrefaction on\r\nanimal substances; whilst the bitterness and condimentary pungency\r\nof the herb enable the stomach to digest rich, luscious meats and\r\ngravies, if it be eaten therewith.\r\n\r\nHence has arisen the custom of stuffing ducks for the table, and\r\ngeese, with the conventional Sage and onions. Or there is no better\r\nway of taking Sage as a stomachic wholesome herb than by eating it\r\nwith bread and butter. In Buckinghamshire a tradition maintains\r\n[491] that the wife rules where Sage grows vigorously in the garden:\r\nand it is believed that this plant will thrive or wither, just as the\r\nowner's business prospers or fails. George Whitfield, when at\r\nOxford (1733), took only Sage-tea, with sugar, and coarse bread.\r\n\r\nOld sayings tell of the herb, as _Salvia salvatrix; naturoe\r\nconciliatrix_; and the line runs:--\r\n\r\n    \"Salvia cum ruta faciunt tibi pocula tuta.\"\r\n\r\nrecommending to plant Rue among the Sage so as to keep away\r\nnoxious toads.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are as fond of Sage as we are of their fragrant teas;\r\nand the Dutch once carried on a profitable trade with them, by\r\nexchanging a pound of Sage leaves for each three-pound parcel of\r\ntea.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly thought that Sage, if used in the making of cheese,\r\nimproved its flavour.\r\n\r\n    \"Marbled with Sage the hardening cheese she pressed.\"\r\n                        --_Gay_.\r\n\r\n\"Sage,\" says Gerard, \"is singular good for the head and brain; it\r\nquickeneth the senses and memory; strengtheneth the sinews;\r\nrestoreth health to those that hath the palsy; and takes away shaky\r\ntrembling of the members.\" Agrippa called it \"the holy herb,\"\r\nbecause women with child, if they be likely to come before their\r\ntime, \"do eat thereof to their great good.\"\r\n\r\nPepys, in his well-known Diary says, \"between Gosport and\r\nSouthampton we observed a little churchyard where it is customary\r\nto sow all the graves with Sage.\" In _Franche Comte_ the herb is\r\nsupposed to mitigate grief, mental and bodily.\r\n\r\n    \"Salvia comfortat nervos, manuumque tremorem\r\n    Tollit; et ejus ope febris acuta fugit.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Sage helps the nerves, and by its powerful might\r\n    Palsy is cured, and fever put to flight.\"\r\n\r\n[492] But if Sage be smelt for some time it will cause a sort of\r\nintoxication, and giddiness. The leaves, when dried and smoked in a\r\npipe as tobacco, will lighten the brain.\r\n\r\nIn Sussex, a peasant will munch Sage leaves on nine consecutive\r\nmornings, whilst fasting, to cure ague.\r\n\r\nA strong infusion of the herb has been used with success to dry up\r\nthe breast milk for weaning; and as a gargle Sage leaf tea, when\r\nsweetened with honey, serves admirably. This decoction, when\r\nmade strong, is an excellent lotion for ulcers, and to heal raw\r\nabrasions of the skin. The herb may be applied externally ill bags as\r\na hot fomentation. Some persons value the Wormwood Sage more\r\nhighly than either of the other varieties.\r\n\r\nIn the Sage flower the stamens swing round their loosely-connected\r\nanther cells against the back of any blundering bee who is in search\r\nof honey, just as in olden days the bag of sand caught the shoulders\r\nof a clumsy youth when tilting at the Quintin.\r\n\r\nWild Meadow Sage (_Salvia verbenaca_), or Meadow Clary, grows\r\nin our dry pastures, but somewhat rarely, though it is better known\r\nas a cultivated herb in our kitchen gardens. The leaves and flowers\r\nafford a volatile oil, which is fragrant and aromatic.\r\n\r\nSome have attributed the name _Salvia sclarea_, Clary (Clear eye)\r\nto the fact of the seeds being so mucilaginous, that when the eye is\r\ninvaded by any small foreign body, their decoction will remove the\r\nsame by acting as an emulsion to lubricate it away. The leaves and\r\nflowers may be usefully given in an infusion for hysterical colic and\r\nsimilar troubles connected with nervous weakness. Also they make\r\na pleasant fermented wine. The Wood Sage is the Wood Germander,\r\n[493] _Teucrium scorodinia_, a woodland plant with sage-like\r\nleaves, containing a volatile oil, some tannin, and a bitter principle.\r\nThis plant has been used as a substitute for hops. It was called \"hind\r\nheal\" from curing the hind when sick, or wounded, and was\r\nprobably the same herb as _Elaphoboscum_, the Dittany, taken by\r\nharts in Crete. A snuff has been made from its powder to cure nasal\r\npolypi: also the infusion (freshly prepared), should be given\r\nmedicinally, two tablespoonfuls for a dose: or, of the powder, from\r\nthirty to forty grains. The name \"Germander\" is a corruption from\r\nChamoedrys, _chamai_, ground, and _drus_, oak, because the\r\nleaves are like those of the oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT JOHN'S WORT (_see page_ 287)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAVIN.\r\n\r\nSavin, the Juniper Savin (_Sabina_), or Saffern, is a herb which\r\ngrows freely in our bed of garden Simples, if properly cared for, and\r\nwhich possesses medicinal virtues of a potential nature. The shrub is\r\na native of southern Europe, being a small evergreen plant, the twigs\r\nof which are densely covered with little leaves in four rows, having\r\na strong, peculiar, unpleasant odour of turpentine, with a bitter,\r\nacrid, resinous taste. The young branchlets are collected for\r\nmedicinal use. They contain tannin, resin, a special volatile oil, and\r\nextractive matters.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture (H.) is made from the fresh leaves, and the\r\npoints of the shoots of the cultivated Savin. But this is a powerful\r\nmedicine, and must be used with caution. In small doses of two or\r\nthree drops with a tablespoonful of cold water it is of singular\r\nefficacy for arresting an active florid flux from the [494] womb at\r\nthe monthly times of women when occurring too profusely, the\r\nremedy being given every two, three, or four hours. Or from one to\r\nfour grains of powdered Savin may be taken instead of each dose of\r\nthe tincture.\r\n\r\nThe stimulating virtues of Savin befit it for cleansing carbuncles,\r\nand for benefiting baldness. When mixed with honey it has removed\r\nfreckles with success; the leaves, dried and powdered, serve, when\r\napplied, to dispel obstinate warty excrescences about the genitals.\r\n\r\nRubbed together with cerate, or lard, powdered Savin is used for\r\nmaintaining the sores of blisters, and of issues, open when it is\r\ndesired to keep up their derivative action.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil will stimulate the womb to functional activity\r\nwhen it is passively congested and torpid. As to its elementary\r\ncomposition this oil closely resembles the spirit of turpentine; and\r\nwhen given in small well diluted doses as a tincture (made of the oil\r\nmixed with spirit of wine), such medicine does good service in\r\nrelieving rheumatic pains and swellings connected with impaired\r\nhealth of the womb. For these purposes the ordinary tincture (H.) of\r\nSavin should be mixed, one part thereof with nine parts of spirit of\r\nwine, and given in doses of from six to ten drops with a\r\ntablespoonful of water. Dr. Pereira says about the herb: \"According\r\nto my own observation, Savin is the most certain and powerful\r\nstimulator of the monthly courses in the whole of our _Materia\r\nMedica_; and I never saw any ill effects result from its\r\nadministration.\" The essential oil may be preferred in a dose of from\r\none to four drops on sugar, or in milk, when this functional activity\r\nis sought.\r\n\r\nSavin was known of old as the \"Devil's Tree,\" and the \"Magician's\r\nCypress,\" because much affected by witches and sorcerers when\r\nworking their spells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[495] SCURVY GRASS.\r\n\r\nOne of the roost useful, but not best known, of the Cruciferous wild\r\nplants which are specifics against Scrofula is our English Scurvy\r\nGrass.\r\n\r\nIt grows by choice near the sea shore, or in mountainous places; and\r\neven when found many miles from the sea its taste is Salt. It occurs\r\nalong the muddy banks of the Avon; also in Wales, and in\r\nCumberland, more commonly near the coast, and likewise on the\r\nmountains of Scotland; again it may be readily cultivated in the\r\ngarden for medicinal uses. If eaten as a salad in its fresh state it\r\nis the most effectual of all the antiscorbutic plants.\r\n\r\nThe herb is produced with an angular smooth shilling stem, twelve\r\nor fourteen inches high, having narrow green leaves, and\r\nterminating in thick clusters of white flowers. Its leaves are good\r\nand wholesome when eaten in spring with bread and butter. The\r\njuice, when diluted with water, makes a good mouth-wash for\r\nspongy gums.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant contains tannin, and a bitter principle, which is\r\nbutyl-mustard oil, and on which the medicinal properties depend.\r\nThis oil is of great volatility and penetrating power; one drop\r\ninstilled on sugar, or dissolved in spirit, communicates to a quart of\r\nwine the taste and smell of Scurvy Grass.\r\n\r\nThe fresh plant taken as such, or the expressed fresh juice, confers\r\nthe benefits of the herb in by far the most effectual way. A distilled\r\nwater, and a conserve prepared with the leaves, were formerly\r\ndispensed by druggists; and the fresh juice mixed with that of\r\nSeville oranges went by the name of \"spring drinks,\" or \"juices.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant is found in large quantities at Lymington [496] (Hants),\r\non low banks almost dipping into the sea. Its expressed juice was\r\nformerly taken in beer, or boiled in milk as a decoction, flavoured\r\nwith pepper, aniseed, etc.\r\n\r\nThis Scurvy Grass has the botanical name _Cochlearia_, or, in\r\nEnglish, Spoonwort, so named from its leaves resembling in shape\r\nthe bowl of an old-fashioned spoon. It is supposed to be the famous\r\n_Herba Britannica_ of the ancients. Our great navigators have borne\r\nunanimous testimony to its never-failing value in scurvy; and it has\r\nbeen justly noticed that the plant grows most plentifully in altitudes\r\nwhere scurvy is specially troublesome and frequent. The green herb\r\nbruised may be applied as a poultice.\r\n\r\nFor making a decoction of the plant as a blood purifier, and against\r\nscurvy, put two ounces of the whole plant and its roots into a quart\r\njug, and fill up with boiling water, taking care to keep this well\r\ncovered. When it is cold take a wineglassful thereof three, or four\r\ntimes in the day.\r\n\r\nAnother name for the plant is Scruby grass. The fresh herb has a\r\nstrong pungent odour when bruised, and a warm bitter taste. Its\r\nbeneficial uses in scurvy, are due to the potash salts which it\r\ncontains. Externally, the juice will cleanse and heal foul ulcers,\r\nand ill-favoured eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA PLANTS and SEA WEEDS.\r\n\r\nOf marine plants commonly found, the Samphire and the Sea Holly\r\nhave certain domestic and medicinal uses which give them\r\na position as Simples; and of the more ordinary Sea Weeds\r\n(cryptogamous, or flowerless plants) some few are edible, though\r\nsparingly nutritious, whilst curative and medicinal virtues are\r\nattributed to several others, as Irish Moss, Scotch Dulse, Sea Tang,\r\nand the [497] Bladderwrack. It may be stated broadly that the Sea\r\nWeeds employed as remedial Simples owe their powers to the\r\nbromine, iodine, and sulphate of soda which they contain. Pliny and\r\nDioscorides in their days extolled the qualities of various Sea\r\nWeeds; and practitioners of medicine on our sea coasts are now\r\nunanimous in pronouncing Sea Weed liniments, and poultices, as of\r\nundoubted value in reducing glandular swellings, and in curing\r\nobstinate sprains; whilst they administer the Bladderwrack, etc.,\r\ninternally for alterative purposes with no little success. Bits of Sea\r\nWeed, called Ladies' trees, are still to be seen as chimney ornaments\r\nin many a Cornish cottage, being fixed on small stands, and\r\nsupposed to protect the dwelling from fire, or other mishaps.\r\n\r\nSamphire, of the true sort, is a herb difficult to be gathered, because\r\nit grows only out of the crevices of lofty perpendicular rocks which\r\ncannot be easily scaled. This genuine Samphire (_Crithmum\r\nmaritimum_) is a small plant, bearing yellow flowers in circular\r\numbels on the tops of the stalks, which flowers are followed by\r\nseeds like those of the Fennel, but larger.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are juicy, with a warm aromatic taste, and may be put\r\ninto sauce; or they make a good appetising condimentary pickle,\r\nwhich is wholesome for scrofulous subjects. Persons living by the\r\ncoast cook this plant as a pot herb. Formerly, it was regularly cried\r\nin the London streets, and was then called Crest Marine.\r\n\r\nShakespeare alludes in well-known lines to the hazardous\r\nproceedings of the Samphire gatherer's \"dreadful trade\":--\r\n\r\n    \"How fearful\r\n    And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!\r\n    The crows and choughs that wing the midway air\r\n    Show scarce so gross as beetles:  half-way down\r\n    _Hangs one that gathers Samphire_:  dreadful trade!\r\n    Methinks he seems to bigger than his head.\"--_King Lear_.\r\n\r\n[498] And Evelyn has praised the plant for excellence of flavour, as\r\nwell as for aromatic virtues against the spleen. Pliny says Samphire\r\nis the very herb that the good country wife Hecate prepared for\r\nTheseus when going against the Bull of Marathon.\r\n\r\nIts botanic name is from the Greek _crithe_, \"barley,\" because the\r\nseeds are thought to resemble that grain. The title Samphire is\r\nderived from the French _Herbe de St. Pierre_, because the roots\r\nstrike deep in the crevices of rocks. St. Peter's Wort has become\r\ncorrupted to Sampetre, Sampier, and Samphire.\r\n\r\nA spurious Samphire, the _Inula crithmoides_, or Golden Samphire,\r\nis often supplied in lieu of the real plant, though it has a different\r\nflavour, and few of the proper virtues. This grows more abundantly\r\non low rocks, and on ground washed by salt water. Also a Salicornia,\r\nor jointed Glasswort, or Saltwort, or Crabgrass, is sold as\r\nSamphire for a pickle, in the Italian oil shops.\r\n\r\nGerard says of Samphire: \"It is the pleasantest sauce, most familiar,\r\nand best agreeing with man's body.\" \"Preferable,\" adds Evelyn, \"for\r\ncleansing the passages, and sharpening appetite, to most of our\r\nhotter herbs, and salad ingredients.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sea Holly (_Eryngium maritimum_), or Sea Hulver, is a\r\nwell-known prickly sea-green plant, growing in the sand on many parts\r\nof our coasts, or on stony ground, with stiff leaves, and roots which\r\nrun to a great length among the sand, whilst charged with a sweetish\r\njuice.\r\n\r\nA manufactory for making candied roots of the Sea Holly was\r\nestablished at Colchester, by Robert Burton, an apothecary, in the\r\nseventeenth century, as they were considered both antiscorbutic, and\r\nexcellent for health.\r\n\r\n[499] Gerard says: \"The roots, if eaten, are good for those that be\r\nliver sick; and they ease cramps, convulsions, and the falling\r\nsickness. If condited, or preserved with sugar, they are exceeding\r\ngood to be given to old and aged people that are consumed and\r\nwithered with age, and which want natural moisture.\" He goes on to\r\ngive an elaborate receipt how to condite the roots of Sea Holly, or\r\nEringos (which title is, according to Liddell and Scott, the\r\ndiminutive of _eerungos_, \"the beard of a goat.\" Or, Eryngo has\r\nbeen derived from the Greek _eruggarein_, to eructate, because the\r\nplant is, according to herbalists, a specific against belching). With\r\nhealthy provers, who have taken the Sea Holly experimentally in\r\ntoxical doses of varying strength the sexual energies and instincts\r\nbecame always depressed. This accounts for the fact that during the\r\nElizabethan era, the roots of the plant used _in moderation_ were\r\nhighly valued for renovating masculine vigour, such as Falstaff\r\ninvoked, and which classic writers have extolled:--\r\n\r\n    \"Non male turn graiis florens eryngus in hortis\r\n    Quaeritur; hunc gremio portet si nupta virentem\r\n    Nunquam inconcessos conjux meditabitur ignes.\"\r\n                            --_Rapinus_.\r\n\r\nThese Eryngo roots, prepared with sugar, were then called \"Kissing\r\nComfits.\" Lord Bacon when recommending the yolks of eggs for\r\ngiving strength if taken with Malmsey, or sweet wine, says: \"You\r\nshall doe well to put in some few slices of Eringium roots, and a\r\nlittle Ambergrice: for by this means, besides the immediate facultie\r\nof nourishment, such drinke will strengthen the back.\"\r\n\r\nPlutarch writes: \"They report of the Sea Holly, if one goat taketh it\r\ninto her mouth, it causeth her first to stand still, and afterwards the\r\nwhole flock, until such [500] time as the shepherd takes it from her.\"\r\nBoerhaave thought the root \"a principal aperient.\"\r\n\r\nIrish Moss, or _Carraigeen_, is abundant on our rocky coasts, and is\r\ncollected on the north western shores of Ireland, while some of it\r\ncomes to us from Hamburg. Its chief constituent is a kind of\r\nmucilage, which dissolves to a stiff paste in boiling water, this\r\ncontaining some iodine, and much sulphur. But before being boiled\r\nin water or milk, the Moss should be soaked for an hour or more in\r\ncold water. Officinally, a decoction is ordered to be made with an\r\nounce of the Moss to a pint of water: of which from one to four fluid\r\nounces may be taken for a dose.\r\n\r\nThis Lichen contains starchy, heat-giving nourishment, about six\r\nparts of the same to one of flesh-forming food; therefore its jelly is\r\nfound to be specially sustaining to persons suffering from\r\npulmonary consumption, with an excessive waste of the bodily heat.\r\nAt one time the Irish Moss fetched as high a price as half-a-crown\r\nfor the pound. It bears the botanical name of _Chondrus crispus_,\r\nand varies much in size and colour. When growing in small pools, it\r\nis shallow, pale, and stunted; whilst when found at the bottom of a\r\ndeep pool, or in the shadow of a great rock, it occurs in dense\r\nmasses of rich ruddy purple, with reddish green thick fronds.\r\n\r\nIceland Moss contains the form of starch called \"lichenin.\" It is a\r\nBritish lichen found especially in Wales and Scotland. Most\r\nprobably the Icelanders were the first to learn its helpful properties.\r\nIn two kinds of pulmonary consumption this lichen best promotes a\r\ncure-that with active bleeding from the lungs, and that with profuse\r\npurulent expectoration. The Icelanders boil the Moss in broth, or dry\r\nit in cakes used as bread. They likewise make gruel of it mixed\r\n[501] with milk: but the first decoction of it in water, being\r\npurgative, is always thrown away. An ounce of the Iceland Moss\r\nboiled for a quarter-of-an-hour in a pint of milk, or water, will yield\r\nseven ounces of thick mucilage. This has been found particularly\r\nuseful in dysentery. Also contained in the Moss are cetrarin,\r\nuncrystallizable sugar, gum, and green wax; with potash, and\r\nphosphate of lime. It affords help in diabetes, and for general\r\natrophy; being given also in powder, or syrup, or mixed with\r\nchocolate. Francatelli directs for making _Iceland Moss Jelly_. Boil\r\nfour ounces of the Moss in one quart of water: then add the juice of\r\ntwo lemons, and a bit of the rind, with four ounces of sugar (and\r\nperhaps a gill of sherry?). Boil up and remove the scum from the\r\nsurface. Strain the jelly through a muslin bag into a basin, and set it\r\naside to become cold. It may be eaten thus, but it is more efficacious\r\nwhen taken warm. A Sea-Moss, the _Lichen marinum_, is \"a singular\r\nremedy to strengthen the weakness of the back.\" It is called\r\n\"Oister-green.\"\r\n\r\nIn New England the generic term \"Moss\" is a cant word signifying\r\nmoney: perhaps as a contraction of Mopuses, or as a play on the\r\nproverb, \"a rolling stone gathers no moss.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dulse is used in Scotland and Ireland both as food and\r\nmedicine. Botanically it bears the name of _Iridea edulis_, or\r\n_Rhodymenia palmata_ (the sugar _Fucus_ of Iceland).\r\n\r\nThere is a saying in Scotland: \"He who eats of the Dulse of Guerdie,\r\nand drinks of the wells Kindingie, will escape all maladies except\r\nblack death.\" This marine weed contains within its cellular structure\r\nmuch iodine, which makes it a specific remedy for scrofulous\r\nglandular enlargements, or morbid deposits.\r\n\r\n[502] In Ireland the Dulse is first well washed in fresh water, and\r\nexposed in the air to dry, when it gives out a white powdery\r\nsubstance, which is sweet and palatable, covering the whole plant.\r\nThe weed is presently packed in cases, and protected from the air, so\r\nthat being thus preserved, it may either be eaten as it is, or boiled\r\nin milk, and mixed with flour of rye. The powdery substance is\r\n\"mannite,\" which is abundant likewise on many of our Sea Weeds.\r\n\r\nCattle and sheep are very fond of Dulse, for which reason in\r\nNorway it is known as Soudsell, or Sheep's Weed. This _Iridea\r\nedulis_ is pinched with hot irons by the fishermen in the south west\r\nof England, So as to make it taste like an oyster. In Scotland it is\r\nroasted in the frying-pan.\r\n\r\nThe Maritime Sea Tang (_Laminaria digitata_) was belauded in the\r\n_Proverbial Philosophy_ of Martin Tupper:--\r\n\r\n    \"Health is in the freshness of its savour; and it cumbereth the\r\n    beach with wealth;\r\n    Comforting the tossings of pain with its violet tinctured Essence.\"\r\n\r\nTang signifies Anglo-Saxon \"thatch,\" from Sea Weed having been\r\nformerly used instead of straw to cover the roofs of houses. When\r\nbruised and applied by way of a poultice to scrofulous swellings and\r\nglandular tumours, the Sea Tang has been found very valuable. The\r\nfamous John Hunter was accustomed to employ a poultice of sea-water\r\nand oatmeal.\r\n\r\nThis weed is of common marine growth, consisting of a wide\r\nsmooth-brown frond, with a thick round stem, and broad brown\r\nribbons like a flag at the end of it. It is familiarly known as\r\nSeagirdles, Tangle, Sea Staff, Sea Wand, and Cows' Tails. Fisher\r\nboys cut up the stems as handles for knives, or hooks, because, after\r\nthe haft of [503] the blade is inserted within the stem, this dries,\r\nand contracts on the iron staple, becoming densely hard and firm.\r\n\r\nThe absorbent stem power of the _Laminaria_ for taking up iodine\r\nis very large; and this element is afterwards brought out by fire in\r\nthe kelp kilns of Ireland and Scotland. Sea Tang acts most\r\nbeneficially against the various forms of scrofulous disease; and\r\nsignally relieves some rheumatic affections. It is also used largely\r\nin the making of glass.\r\n\r\nLikewise for scrofula, seawater, being rich in chlorides and iodides,\r\nhas proved both curative and preventive. Dr. Sena, of Valencia,\r\ngave bread made with sea-water in the Misericordia Hospital for\r\ncases of scrofulous disease, and other states of defective nutrition,\r\nwith singular success.\r\n\r\nAnother Laminaria (_Saccharina_), with a single olive yellow\r\nsemi-transparent frond, yields an abundance of sweet \"mannit\" when\r\nboiled and evaporated.\r\n\r\nThe Bladderwrack (_Fucus vesiculosus_), Kelpware, or Our Lady's\r\nWrack, is found on most of our sea coasts in heavy brown masses of\r\ncoarse-looking Sea Weed, which cover, and shelter many small\r\nalgae. Kelp is an impure carbonate of soda containing sulphate, and\r\nchloride of sodium, with a little charcoal.\r\n\r\nBy its characteristic bladders, or vesicles studded about the blades\r\nof the branched narrowish fronds, this Sea Weed may be easily\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThese bladders are full of a glutinous substance, which makes the\r\nweed valuable both as a remedy for the glandular troubles of\r\nscrofula, and, when bottled in rum, as an embrocation, such as is\r\nspecially useful for strengthening the limbs of rickety, or\r\nbandy-legged children. Against glandular swellings also the weed is\r\n[504] taken internally as a medicine, when burnt to a black powder.\r\nAn analysis of the Bladderwrack has shown it to contain an\r\nempyreumatic oil, sulphur, earthy salts, some iron, and iodine\r\nfreely. Thus it is very rich in anti-scrofulous elements.\r\n\r\nThe fluid extract of this Sea Weed has the long standing reputation\r\nof safely diminishing an excess of personal fat. It is given for such\r\na purpose three times a day, shortly after meals, in doses of\r\nfrom one to four teaspoonfuls. The remedy should be continued\r\nperseveringly, whilst cutting down the supplies of fat, starchy foods,\r\nsugar, and malt liquors. When thus taken (as likewise in the\r\nconcentrated form of a pill, if preferred) the Bladderwrack will\r\nespecially relieve rheumatic pains; and the sea pod liniment\r\ndispensed by many druggists at our chief marine health resorts,\r\nproves signally efficacious towards the same end. Furthermore, they\r\nprepare a sea-pod essence for applying on a wet compress beneath\r\nwaterproof tissue to strumous tumours, goitre, and bronchocele; also\r\nfor old strains and bruises.\r\n\r\nThis Sea Weed should not be obtained when too fully matured, as it\r\nquickly undergoes decomposition.\r\n\r\nWrack is Sea Weed thrown ashore, from _Vrage_, to reject. Wrack\r\nGrass (_Zostera Marina_), is a marine plant with long grass-like\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThere are four common Fuci on our coasts--the _Nodosus_ (Knobbed\r\nWrack), the _Vesiculosus_ (Bladder Wrack), the _Serratus_\r\n(Saw-edged Sea Weed), and the _Caniculatus_ (Channeled Sea Weed).\r\n\r\nIt is by reason of its contained bromine and iodine as safe medicinal\r\nelements, the _Fucus vesiculosus_ acts in reducing fatness; these\r\nelements stimulating all the absorbent glands of the body to\r\nincreased activity. [505] In common with the other Fuci it furnishes\r\nmannite, an odorous oil, a bitter principle, mucilage, and ash, this\r\nlast constituent abounding in the bromine and iodine.\r\n\r\nFor internal use, a decoction may be made with from two to four\r\ndrachms of the weed to a pint of water, boiled together for a few\r\nminutes; and for external application to enlarged or hardened\r\nglands, the bruised weed may be applied as a cold poultice.\r\n\r\nThis Bladder Wrack is reputed to be the _Anti-polyscarcique_\r\nnostrum of Count Mattaei.\r\n\r\nAlthough diminishing fat it does no harm by inducing any atrophied\r\nwasting of the breast glands, or of the testicles.\r\n\r\nThe Bladderwrack yields a rich produce to the seaside agriculturist\r\nhighly useful as manure for the potato field and for other crops: and\r\nit is gathered for this purpose all along the British coast. In Jersey\r\nand Guernsey it is called _vraic_. Among the Hebrides, cheeses,\r\nwhilst drying, are covered with the ashes of this weed which\r\nabounds in salt. Patients who have previously suffered much from\r\nrheumatism about the body and limbs have found themselves\r\nentirely free from any such pains or trouble whilst taking the extract\r\nof _Fucus Vesiculosus_ (Bladderwrack). This Sea Weed is in\r\nperfection only during early and middle summer. For fresh sprains\r\nand bruises a hot decoction of the Bladderwrack should be used at\r\nfirst as a fomentation; and, afterwards, a cold essence of the weed\r\nshould be rubbed in, or applied on wet lint beneath light thin\r\nwaterproof tissue, or oiled silk, as a compress: this to be changed as\r\noften as hot or dry.\r\n\r\nLaver is the popular name given to some edible Sea Weeds--the\r\n_Porphyra lanciniata_, and the _Ulva latissima_. The same title was\r\nformerly bestowed by Pliny on an [506] aquatic plant now\r\nunknown, and called also Sloke, or Sloken.\r\n\r\n_Porphyra_, from a Greek word meaning \"purple,\" is the true Laver,\r\nor Sloke. It is slimy, or semi-gelatinous of consistence when served\r\nat table, having been stewed for several hours until quite tender, and\r\nthen being eaten with butter, vinegar, and pepper. At the London\r\nReform Club Laver is provided every day in a silver saucepan at\r\ndinner, garnished with lemons, to flank the roast leg of mutton.\r\nOthers prefer it cooked with leeks and onions, or pickled, and eaten\r\nwith oil and lemon juice. The Englishman calls this Sea Weed,\r\nLaver; the Irishman, Sloke; the Scotchman, Slack; and the student,\r\n_Porphyra_. It varies in size and colour between tidemarks, being\r\nsometimes long and ribbon-like, of a violet or purple hue;\r\nsometimes long and broad, whilst changing to a reddish purple, or\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nIt is very wholesome, and preventive of scurvy, being therefore\r\nvaluable on sea voyages, as it will keep good for a long time in\r\nclosed tin vessels.\r\n\r\nThe _Ulva latissima_ is a deep-green Sea Weed, called by the\r\nfishermen Oyster Green, because employed to cover over oysters.\r\nThis is likewise known as Laver, because sometimes substituted by\r\nepicures for the true Laver (_Porphyra_) when the latter cannot be\r\ngot; but it is not by any means as good. The name _Ulva_ is from\r\n_ul_, meaning \"water.\"\r\n\r\nSea Spinach (_Satsolacea--Spirolobea_) is a Saltwort found growing\r\non the shore in Hampshire and other parts of England, the best of all\r\nwild vegetables for the table, having succulent leaves shaped like\r\nworms, and being esteemed as an excellent antiscorbutic.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Beet--a Chenopod--which grows plentifully on our shores,\r\ngave origin to the cultivated Beetroot of [507] our gardens. Its name\r\nwas derived from a fancied resemblance borne by its seed vessels\r\nwhen swollen with seed to the Greek letter B (_beta_).\r\n\r\n    \"Nomine cum Graio cui litera proxima primoe\r\n    Pangitur in cera doeti mucrone magistri.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The Greeks gave its name to the Beet from their alphabet's\r\n    second letter,\r\n    As an Attic teacher wrote it on wax with a sharp stiletto.\"\r\n\r\nBy the Grecians the Beet was offered on silver to Apollo in his\r\ntemple at Delphi. A pleasant wine may be made from its roots, and\r\nits juice when applied with a brush is an excellent cosmetic. The\r\nMangel Wurzel, also a variety of Beet, means literally, \"scarcity\r\nroot.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Sea Weed, the Bladderlocks (_Alaria esculenta_),\r\n\"henware,\" \"honeyware,\" \"murlins,\" is edible, the thick rib which\r\nruns through the frond being the part chosen. This abounds on the\r\nNorthern coasts of England and Scotland, being of a clear olive\r\nyellow colour, with a stem as thick as a small goosequill, varying in\r\nlength, with its fronds, from three to twenty feet. The fruit appears\r\nas if partially covered with a brown crust consisting of transparent\r\nspore cases set on a stalk in a cruciform manner.\r\n\r\nCommon Coraline (_Corallina Anglica_), a Sea Weed of a whitish\r\ncolour, tinged with purple and green, and of a firm substance, is\r\nfamous for curing Worms.\r\n\r\nThe presence of gold in sea water, even as surrounding our own\r\nislands, has been sufficiently proved; though, as yet, its extraction\r\nis a costly and uncertain process. One analyst has estimated that the\r\namount of gold contained in the oceans of the globe must be ten\r\nmillion tons, without counting the possible quantity locked up in\r\nfloating icebergs about the Poles.\r\n\r\nProfessor Liveredge, of the Sydney University, [508] examined sea\r\nwater collected off the Australian coast, as also some from Northern\r\nshores, and obtained gold, from five-tenths to eight-tenths of a grain\r\nper ton of the sea water. It occurs as the chloride, and the bromide of\r\ngold; which salts, as recently shown by Dr. Compton Burnett, when\r\nadministered in doses almost infinitesimally small, are of supreme\r\nvalue for the cure of epilepsy, secondary syphilis, sexual debility,\r\nand some disorders of the heart.\r\n\r\nDr. Russell wrote on the uses of sea water in diseases of the glands.\r\nHe found the soapy mucus within the vesicles of the Bladderwrack\r\nan excellent resolvent, and most useful in dispersing scrofulous\r\nswellings. He advises rubbing the tumour with these vesicles\r\nbruised in the hand, and afterwards washing the part with sea water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELFHEAL.\r\n\r\nSeveral Herbal Simples go by the name of Selfheal among our wild\r\nhedge plants, more especially the Sanicle, the common Prunella,\r\nand the Bugle.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is an umbelliferous herb, growing frequently in\r\nwoods, having dull white flowers, in panicled heads, which are\r\nsucceeded by roundish seeds covered with hooked prickles: the\r\nWood Sanicle (_Europoea_).\r\n\r\nIt gets its name Sanicle, perhaps, from the Latin verb _sanare_, \"to\r\nheal, or make sound;\" or, possibly, as a corruption of St. Nicholas,\r\ncalled in German St. Nickel, who, in the _Tale of a Tub_, is said to\r\nhave interceded with God in favour of two children whom an\r\ninnkeeper had murdered and pickled in a pork tub; and he obtained\r\ntheir restoration to life.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, the name Sanicle was supposed in the middle ages to\r\nmean \"curative,\" whatever its origin: [509] thus, _Qui a la Bugle, et\r\nla Sanicle fait aux chirurgiens la nicle_--\"He who uses Sanicle and\r\nBugle need have no dealings with the doctor.\" Lyte and other\r\nherbalists say concerning the Sanicle: \"It makes whole and sound all\r\nwounds and hurts, both inward and outward.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Celui qui Sanicle a\r\n    De plaie affaire il n'a.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Who the Sanicle hath\r\n    At the surgeon may laugh.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Prunella (which belongs more rightly to another herb) has\r\nbeen given to the Sanicle, perhaps, through its having been\r\noriginally known as Brunella, Brownwort, both because of the\r\nbrown colour of its spikes, and from its being supposed to cure the\r\ndisease called in Germany _die braune_, a kind of quinsy; on the\r\ndoctrine of signatures, because the corolla resembles a throat with\r\nswollen glands.\r\n\r\nThe Sanicle is popularly employed in Germany and France as a\r\nremedy for profuse bleeding from the lungs, bowels, womb, and\r\nurinary organs; also for the staying of dysenteric diarrhoea. The\r\nfresh juice of the herb may be given in tablespoonful doses.\r\n\r\nAs yet no analysis has been made of this plant; but evidence of\r\ntannin in its several parts is afforded by the effects produced when\r\nthese are remedially applied.\r\n\r\nThe _Prunella vulgaris_ is a distinct plant from the Self Heal, or\r\nSanicle, and belongs to the labiate order of herbs. It grows\r\ncommonly in waste places about England, and bears pink flowers,\r\nbeing sometimes called Slough heal. This is incorrect, as the\r\nsurgical term \"slough\" was not used until long after the Prunella and\r\nthe Sanicle became named Self-heal. Each of these was applied as a\r\nvulnerary, not to sloughing sores, but to fresh cut wounds.\r\n\r\n[510] The _Prunella Vulgaris_ has a flattened calyx, and whorls of\r\npurplish blue flowers, which are collected in a head. It is also\r\nknown as Carpenter's Herb, perhaps, from its corolla, when seen in\r\nprofile, being shaped like a bill hook; and therefore, on the doctrine\r\nof signatures, it was supposed to heal wounds inflicted by edge\r\ntools; whence it was likewise termed Hook-heal and Sicklewort,\r\narid in Yorkshire, Black man.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of its properties as a vulnerary it has also been called\r\n_Consolida_; but the daisy is the true _Consolida minor_.\r\n\r\n\"The decoction of Prunell,\" says Gerard, \"made with wine and\r\nwater, doth join together and make whole and sound all wounds,\r\nboth inward and outward, even as Bugle doth. To be short, it serveth\r\nfor the same that the Bugle serveth; and in the world there are not\r\ntwo better wound herbs, as bath been often proved.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bugle, or middle Comfrey, is also a Sanicle, because of its\r\nexcellence for healing wounds, in common with the Prunella and the\r\ntrue Sanicle. It grows in almost every wood, and copse, and moist\r\nshadowy place, being constantly reckoned among the Consounds.\r\n\r\nThis herb (_Ajuga reptans_) is of the labiate order, bearing dark\r\nblue or purple flowers, whorled, and crowded into a spike. Its\r\ndecoction, \"when drunk, healeth and maketh sound all wounds of\r\nthe body.\" \"It is so singular good for all sorts of hurts that none who\r\nknow its usefulness will be ever without it. If the virtues of it make\r\nyou fall in love with it (as they will if you be wise), keep a syrup of\r\nit, to take inwardly, and an ointment and plaister of it to use\r\noutwardly, always by you.\"\r\n\r\nThe chemical principles of the Prunella and the Bugle [511]\r\nresemble those of other Labiate herbs, comprising a volatile\r\noil, some bitter principle, tannin, sugar, and cellulose. The\r\nLadies' Mantle, Alchemilla--a common inconspicuous weed, found\r\neverywhere--is called Great Sanicle, also Parsley-breakstone, or\r\nPiercestone, because supposed to be of great use against stone in the\r\nbladder. It contains tannin abundantly, and is said to promote quiet\r\nsleep if placed under the pillow at night. \"_Endymionis somnum\r\ndormire_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD'S PURSE.\r\n\r\nThe small Shepherd's Purse (_Bursa Capsella Pastoris_) is one of\r\nthe most common of wayside English weeds. The name _Capsella_\r\nsignifies a little box, in allusion to the seed pods. It is a\r\nCruciferous plant, made familiar by the diminutive pouches, or\r\nflattened pods at the end of its branching stems. This herb is of\r\nnatural growth in most parts of the world, but varies in luxuriance\r\naccording to soil and situation, whilst thickly strewn over the\r\nwhole surface of the earth, facing alike the heat of the tropics,\r\nand the rigours of the arctic regions; even, if trodden underfoot,\r\nit rises again and again with ever enduring vitality, as if\r\ndesigned to fulfil some special purpose in the far-seeing economy\r\nof nature. It lacks the winged valves of the _Thlaspi_.\r\n\r\nOur old herbalists called it St. James's Wort, as a gift from that\r\nSaint to the people for the cure of various diseases, St. Anthony's\r\nFire, and several skin eruptions. In France, too, the plant goes by\r\nthe title of _Fleur de Saint Jacques_. It flowers from early in\r\nSpring until Autumn, and has, particularly in Summer, an acrid\r\nbitter taste. Other names for the herb are, \"Case weed,\" \"Pick\r\npocket,\" and \"Mother's heart,\" as called so by [512] children.\r\nIf a pod is picked they raise the cry, \"You've plucked out\r\nyour mother's heart.\" Small birds are fond of the seeds.\r\n\r\nBombelon, a French chemist, has reported most favourably about\r\nthis herb as of prompt use to arrest bleedings and floodings, when\r\ngiven in the form of a fluid extract, one or two teaspoonfuls for a\r\ndose. He explains that our hedge-row Simple contains a tannate, an\r\nalkaloid \"bursine,\" (which resembles sulphocyansinapine), and\r\nbursinic acid, this last constituent being the active medicinal\r\nprinciple. English chemists now prepare and dispense the fluid\r\nextract of the herb. This is given for dropsy in the U. S. America as\r\na diuretic; from half to one teaspoonful in water for a dose.\r\n\r\nDr. Von Ehrenwall relates a recent case of female flooding, which\r\nhad defied all the ordinary remedies, and for which, at the\r\nsuggestion of a neighbour, he tried an infusion of the Shepherd's\r\nPurse weed, with the result that the bleeding stopped after the first\r\nteacupful of the infusion had been taken a few minutes. Since then\r\nhe has used the plant in various forms of haemorrhage with such\r\nsuccess that he considers it the most reliable of our medicines for\r\nstaying fluxes of blood. \"Shepherd's Purse stayeth bleeding in any\r\npart of the body, whether the juice thereof be drunk, or whether it be\r\nused poultice-like, or in bath, or any way else.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary constituents of herbs, it is found to contain six\r\nper cent. of soft resin, together with a sulphuretted volatile oil,\r\nwhich is identical with that of Mustard, as obtained likewise from\r\nthe bitter Candytuft, _Iberis amara_.\r\n\r\nIts medicinal infusion should be made with an ounce of the plant to\r\ntwelve ounces of water, reduced by [513] boiling to half-a-pint; then\r\na wineglassful may be given for a dose.\r\n\r\nThe herb and its seeds were employed in former times to promote\r\nthe regular monthly flow in women.\r\n\r\nIt bears, further, the name of Poor Man's Permacetty (or\r\nSpermaceti), \"the sovereignst remedy for bruises;\"--\"perhaps,\" says\r\nDr. Prior, \"as a joke on the Latin name _Bursa pastoris_, or 'Purse,'\r\nbecause to the poor man this is always his best remedy.\" And in\r\nsome parts of England the Shepherd's Purse is known as Clapper\r\nPouch, in allusion to the licensed begging of lepers at our crossways\r\nin olden times with a bell and a clapper. They would call the\r\nattention of passers-by with the bell, or with the clapper, and would\r\nreceive their alms in a cup, or a basin, at the end of a long pole. The\r\nclapper was an instrument made of two or three boards, by rattling\r\nwhich the wretched lepers incited people to relieve them. Thus they\r\nobtained the name of Rattle Pouches, which appellation has been\r\nextended to this small plant, in allusion to the little purses which it\r\nhangs out by the wayside. Because of these miniature pockets the\r\nherb is also named Toy Wort; and Pick Purse, through being\r\nsupposed to steal the goodness of the land from the farmer. In\r\nQueen Elizabeth's time leper hospitals were common throughout\r\nEngland; and many of the sufferers were banished to the Lizard, in\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nThe Shepherd's Purse is now announced as the chief remedy of the\r\nseven \"marvellous medicines\" prepared by Count Mattaei, of\r\nBologna, which are believed by his disciples to be curative of\r\ndiseases otherwise intractable, such as cancer, internal aneurism,\r\nand destructive leprosy.\r\n\r\nCount Mattaei professed to extract certain vegetable [514]\r\nelectricities found stored up in this, and some other plants, and to\r\nutilize them for curative purposes with almost miraculous success.\r\nHis other herbs, as revealed by a colleague, Count Manzetti, are the\r\nKnotgrass, the Water Betony, the Cabbage, the Stonecrop, the\r\nHouseleek, the Feverfew, and the Watercress. Lady Paget, when\r\ninterviewing Count Mattaei, gathered that Shepherd's Purse is the\r\nherb which furnishes the so-called \"blue electricity,\" of\r\nextraordinary efficacy in controlling haemorrhages. Small birds are\r\nfond of the seeds: and the young radical leaves are sold in\r\nPhiladelphia as greens in the Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVERWEED.\r\n\r\nTwo _Potentillas_ occur among our common native plants, and\r\npossess certain curative virtues (as popularly supposed), the\r\nSilverweed and the Cinquefoil. They belong to the Rose tribe, and\r\ngrow abundantly on our roadsides, being useful as mild astringents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Potentilla anserina_ (Silverweed) is found, as its adjective\r\nsuggests, where geese are put to feed.\r\n\r\nCountry folk often call it Cramp Weed: but it is more generally\r\nknown as Goose Tansy, or Goose Gray, because it is a spurious\r\nTansy, fit only for a goose; or, perhaps, because eaten by geese.\r\nOther names for the herb are Silvery Cinquefoil, and Moorgrass. It\r\noccurs especially on clay soils, being recognised by its pinnate\r\nwhite silvery leaves, and its conspicuous golden flowers.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire the roots are known as \"moors,\" which boys dig up and\r\neat in the winter; whilst swine will also devour them greedily. They\r\nhave then a sweet taste like parsnips. In Scotland, also, they are\r\neaten roasted, or boiled; and sometimes, in hard seasons, [515]\r\nwhen other provisions were scanty, these roots have been known to\r\nsupport the inhabitants of certain islands for months together.\r\n\r\nBoth the roots and the leaves are mildly astringent; so that their\r\ninfusion helps to stay diarrhoea, and the fluxes of women; making\r\nalso with honey a useful gargle. The leaf is of an exquisitely\r\nbeautiful shape, and may be seen carved on the head of many an old\r\nstall in Church, or Cathedral. By reason of its five leaflets, this\r\ngives to the plant the title \"five leaf,\" or five fingered grass,\r\n_Pentedaktulon_. _Potentilla_ comes from the Latin _potens_, as\r\nalluding to the medicinal virtues of the species.\r\n\r\nIn former days the Cinquefoil was much affected as a heraldic\r\ndevice through the number of the leaflets answering to the five\r\nsenses of man; whilst the right to bear Cinquefoil was considered an\r\nhonourable distinction to him who had worthily mastered his senses,\r\nand conquered his passions.\r\n\r\nSilverweed tea is excellent to relieve cramps of the belly; and\r\ncompresses, wrung out of a hot decoction of the herb, may at the\r\nsame time be helpfully applied over the seat of the cramps. A potent\r\nAnglo-Saxon charm against crampy bellyache was to wear a gold\r\nring with a Dolphin engraved on it, and bearing in Greek the mystic\r\nwords:--\"Theos keleuei mee keneoon ponois,\" \"_God forbids the\r\npains of colic_.\" This acted doubtless by mental suggestion, as in\r\nthe cure of warts. The knee-cap bone, or patella, of a sheep, known\r\nlocally as the \"cramp-bone,\" is worn in Northamptonshire for a like\r\npurpose; also the application of a gold wedding ring (first wetted\r\nwith saliva, an ingredient in the holy salve of the Saxons), to a stye\r\nthreatened in an eyelid is often found to disperse the swelling; but in\r\nthis case [516] it may be, that a sulphocyanide of gold is formed\r\nwith the spittle, which promotes the cure by absorption.\r\n\r\nA strong infusion, if used as a lotion, will check the bleeding of\r\npiles, the ordinary infusion being meantime taken as a medicine.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Leicestershire were accustomed in bygone days\r\nto prevent pitting by small-pox with the use of Silverweed\r\nfomentations. A distilled water of the herb takes away freckles,\r\nspots, pimples in the face, and sunburnings; whilst all parts of the\r\nplant are found to contain tannin.\r\n\r\nThe Creeping Cinquefoil (_Potentilla replans_) grows also\r\nabundantly on meadow banks, having astringent roots, which have\r\nbeen used medicinally since the times of Hippocrates and\r\nDioscorides.\r\n\r\nThey were found to cure intermittent fevers, such as used to prevail\r\nin marshy or ill-drained lands much more commonly than now in\r\nGreat Britain; though country folk still use the infusion or decoction\r\nfor the same purpose in some districts; also for jaundice.\r\n\r\nLikewise, because of the tannin contained in the outer bark of the\r\nroots, their decoction is useful against diarrhoea; and their infusion\r\nas a gargle for relaxed sore throats. But, except in mild cases, other\r\nmore positively astringent herbs are to be preferred. The roots afford\r\na useful red dye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKULLCAP.\r\n\r\nA useful medicinal tincture (H.) is made from the Skullcap\r\n(_Scutellaria_), which is a Labiate plant of frequent growth on the\r\nbanks of our rivers and ponds, having bright blue flowers, with\r\na tube longer than the calyx. This is the greater variety\r\n(_Galericulata_). There is a lesser variety (_Scutellaria minor_),\r\nwhich is [517] infrequent, and grows in bogs about the West of\r\nEngland, with flowers of a dull purple colour. Each kind gets its\r\nname from the Latin _scutella_, \"a little cap,\" which the calyx\r\nresembles, and is therefore called Hood Wort, or Helmet flower.\r\nThe upper lip of the calyx bulges outward about its middle, and\r\nfinally closes down like a lid over the fruit. When the seed is ripe\r\nit opens again.\r\n\r\nProvers of the tincture (H.) in toxic doses experienced giddiness,\r\nstupor, and confusion of mind, twitchings of the limbs, intermission\r\nof the pulse, and other symptoms indicative of the epileptiform\r\n\"petit mal\"; for which morbid affection, and the disposition thereto,\r\nthe said tincture, of a diluted strength, in small doses, has been\r\nsuccessfully given.\r\n\r\nThe greater Skullcap contains, in common with most other plants of\r\nthe same order, a volatile oil, tannin, fat, some bitter principle,\r\nsugar, and cellulose.\r\n\r\nIf a decoction of the plant is made with two ounces of the herb to\r\neight ounces of water, and is taken for some weeks continuously in\r\nrecent epilepsy, or when the disease has only functional causes, it\r\nwill often prove very beneficial. Likewise, this decoction, in\r\ncommon with an extract of the herb, has been given curatively for\r\nintermittent fever and ague, as well as for some depressed, and\r\ndisordered states of the nervous system.\r\n\r\nA dried extract of the lesser Skullcap (_Lateriflora_) is made by\r\nchemists, and given in doses of from one to three grains as a pill to\r\nrelieve severe hiccough, and as a nervine stimulant; also for the\r\nsleeplessness of an exhausted brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLOE.\r\n\r\nThe parent tree which produces the Sloe is the Blackthorn, our\r\nhardy, thorny hedgerow shrub (_Prunus_ [518] _spinosa_), Greek\r\n_Prounee_, common everywhere, and starting into blossom of a\r\npinky white about the middle of March before a leaf appears, each\r\nbranchlet ending in a long thorn projecting beyond the flowers at\r\nright angles to the stem. From the conspicuous blackness of its rind\r\nat the time of flowering, the tree is named Blackthorn, and the spell\r\nof harsh unkindly cold weather which prevails about then goes by\r\nthe name of \"blackthorn winter.\"\r\n\r\nThe term Sloe, or Sla, means not the fruit but the hard trunk, being\r\nconnected with a verb signifying to slay, or strike, probably because\r\nthe wood of this tree was used as a flail, and nowadays makes a\r\nbludgeon.\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn every branch becomes clustered with the oval\r\nblue-black fruit presently covered with a fine purple bloom; and\r\nuntil mellowed by the early frosts, this fruit is very harsh and\r\nsour.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, when they unfold late in the spring, are small and\r\nnarrow. If dried, they make a very fair substitute for tea, and when\r\nhigh duties were placed on imported tea, it was usual to find the sloe\r\ntrees stripped of their marketable foliage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the dark ruby juice of Sloes enters largely into the\r\nmanufacture of British port wine, to which it communicates a\r\nbeautiful deep red colour, and a pleasant sub-acid roughness. Letters\r\nmarked upon linen fabric with this juice, when used fresh, will not\r\nwash out.\r\n\r\nIf obtained by expression from the unripe fruit, it is very useful as\r\nan astringent medicine, and is a popular remedy for stopping a flow\r\nof blood from the nose. It may be gently boiled to a thick\r\nconsistence, and will then keep throughout the year without losing\r\nits virtues. Winter-picks is a provincial name for the Sloe fruit,\r\n[519] and winter-pick wine takes the place of port in the rustic\r\ncellar. The French call them Prunelles.\r\n\r\nSloe-blossoms make a safe, harmless, laxative medicine. To use\r\nthese, \"Boil them up, and drink a cup of the tea daily for three or\r\nfour days; it will act gently, painlessly, but thoroughly.\" The syrup\r\nis especially useful for children.\r\n\r\nCountry people bury the Sloes in jars to preserve them for winter\r\nuse; and the bush which bears this fruit is sometimes called,\r\nprovincially, Scroggs.\r\n\r\nSloes may be gathered when ripe on a dry day, picked clean, and put\r\ninto jars or bottles, without any boiling or other process, and then\r\ncovered with loaf sugar; a tablespoonful of brandy should presently\r\nbe added, and the jar sealed. By Christmas, the syrup formed from\r\nthe juice, the sugar, and the spirit, will have covered and saturated\r\nthe fruit, and then a couple of tablespoonfuls will not only make an\r\nagreeable dessert liqueur, but will act as an astringent cordial of a\r\nvery pleasant sort.\r\n\r\nIn Somersetshire the Sloe is named Snag (as corrupted from \"Slag,\"\r\ni.e., Sloe). The juice is viscid, and when thickened to dryness, is the\r\nGerman Gum Acacia.\r\n\r\nThose provers who have taken experimentally a tincture made from\r\nthe wood and bark and leaves of the Blackthorn, all had to complain\r\nof sharp pains in the right eyeball and accordingly the diluted\r\ntincture is found, when administered in small quantities, to give\r\nsignal relief for ciliary neuralgia, arising from a functional disorder\r\nof the structures within the eyeball. Dr. Hughes says: \"It not only\r\nrelieves such pains, but also checks the inflammation, and clears the\r\nvision.\" The medicinal tincture is made (H.) with proof spirit of\r\nwine from the flower buds collected in early spring [520] before\r\nthey expand. The Sloe has been employed as a styptic ever since the\r\ntime of Dioscorides. \"From the effects,\" says Withering, \"which I\r\nhave repeatedly observed to follow a wound from the thorns, I find\r\nreason for believing that there is something poisonous in their\r\nnature, particularly in the autumn.\"\r\n\r\nNext to the Sloe in order of development comes the Bullace\r\n(_Prunus insititia_), a shrub with fewer thorns, and bearing its\r\nflowers after the leaves have begun to unfold.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is five times as big as the Sloe, but likewise of a delicate\r\nbluish colour. It is named from the Latin plural bullas, meaning the\r\nround bosses which the Romans put on their bridles. Lydgate (1440)\r\nused the phrase, \"As bright as Bullaces,\" in one of his poems. In\r\nLincolnshire the blossom is known as \"Bully bloom,\" and the fruit\r\nare \"Bullies.\" After harvest the women and children go out\r\ngathering them for Bullace-wine. Boys in France call Slot's\r\n\"_Sibarelles_,\" because it is impossible to whistle immediately after\r\neating them. Some writers say the signification of \"Sloe\" is \"that\r\nwhich sets the teeth on edge.\"\r\n\r\nFinally comes the true Wild Plum (_Prunus domestica_), which is\r\nfar less common than the two preceding sorts. Its flowers are large,\r\nand in small clusters, whilst the leaves unfold with the blossom. The\r\nfruit is a small brownish plum, intensely sharp and acrid to the taste,\r\nand the tree is thorny. Only in this latter respect does it differ from\r\nan inferior kind of garden plum of which the cultivation has been\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated Plum has been developed from the Wild Plum, and\r\nhas been made to exhibit some fifty varieties of form and character.\r\nThe fruit of Damascus was formerly much valued, being now\r\nknown as Damascenes, (damsons), Damasin, or Damask prune.\r\n\r\n[521] All the Wild Plums develop thorns; but the cultivated kinds\r\nhave entirely cast them off. The Plum, as a fruit, was known to the\r\nRomans in Cato's time, but not the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Little Jack Horner,\" says the familiar nursery rhyme, \"sat in a\r\ncorner, eating a Christmas pie; he put in his thumb, and he pulled\r\nout a plum, and said 'What a good boy am I.'\"\r\n\r\n    \"Inquit, et unum extraheus prunum,\r\n    Horner, quam fueris nobile pueris\r\n            Exemplar imitabile\"!\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, cultivated Plums are cooling and slightly laxative,\r\nespecially the French fruit, which is dried and bottled for dessert.\r\nThey are useful for costive habits, and may be made into an\r\nelectuary; but, when unripe, Plums provoke choleraic diarrhoea. The\r\ngarden fruit contains less sugar than cherries, but a large amount of\r\ngelatinising pectose. Dr. Johnson was specially fond of veal pie with\r\nplums and sugar. He taunted Boswell about the need of gardeners to\r\nproduce in Scotland what grows wild in England. \"Pray, Sir,\" said\r\nhe, \"are you ever able to bring the Sloe to perfection there?\" On\r\nChange a hundred thousand pounds are whimsically known as \"a\r\nplum,\" and a million of money is \"a marigold.\" Lately a Chicago\r\nphysician whilst officiating at a Reformatory found that the boys\r\nbehaved themselves much better when taking prunes in their diet\r\nthan at any other time. These act, he supposes, on certain organs\r\nwhich are the seats, and centres of the passions.\r\n\r\nFrom France comes the Greengage, named in that country (out of\r\ncompliment to the Queen of Francis the First) _La Reine Claude_. It\r\nwas brought to England from [522] the Monastery of La Grande\r\nChartreuse, about the middle of the eighteenth century, by the Rev.\r\nJohn Gage, brother to the owner of Hengrave Hall, near Coldham,\r\nSuffolk; and taking his name this fruit soon became diffused\r\nthroughout England.\r\n\r\nFrench Prunes are conveyed to England in their dried state from\r\nMarseilles. With their pulp, figs, tamarinds, and senna, the officinal\r\n\"lenitive electuary\" is made; and apothecaries prepare a medicinal\r\ntincture from the fresh flower-buds of the Blackthorn.\r\n\r\nCulpeper says: \"All Plumbs are under Venus, and are like women--\r\nsome better, some worse.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sussex and some other counties, a superstitious fear attaches\r\nitself to the Blackthorn in bloom, because of the apparent union of\r\nlife and death when the tree is clothed in early Spring with white\r\nflowers, but is destitute of leaves; so that to carry, or wear a piece\r\nof Blackthorn in blossom, is thought to signify bringing a death token.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPWORT.\r\n\r\nThe Soapwort (_Saponaria officinalis_) grows commonly in\r\nEngland near villages, on roadsides, and by the margins of woods,\r\nin moist situations. It belongs to the _Caryophyllaceoe_, or Clove\r\nand Pink tribe of plants; and a double flowered variety of it is met\r\nwith in gardens. This is Miss Mitford's \"Spicer\" in _Our Village_. It\r\nis sometimes named \"Bouncing Bet,\" and \"Fuller's herb.\"\r\n\r\nThe root has a sweetish bitter taste, but no odour. It contains resin\r\nand mucilage, in addition to saponin, which is its leading principle,\r\nand by virtue of which decoctions of the root produce a soapy froth.\r\nSaponin is likewise found in the nuts of the Horse-chestnut tree, and\r\nin the Scarlet Pimpernel.\r\n\r\n[523] A similar soapy quality is also observed in the leaves, so\r\nmuch so that they have been used by mendicant monks as a\r\nsubstitute for soap in washing their clothes. This \"saponin\" has\r\nconsiderable medicinal efficacy, being especially useful for the\r\ncure of inveterate syphilis without giving mercury. Several writers\r\nof note aver that such cases have been cured by a decoction of\r\nthe plant; though perhaps the conclusion has been arrived at\r\nthrough the resemblance between the roots of Soapwort and those of\r\nSarsaparilla.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"Ludovicus Septalius, when treating of decoctions in\r\nuse against the French poxes, mentions the singular effect of the\r\nSoapwort against that filthy disease\"; but, he adds, \"it is somewhat\r\nof an ungrateful taste, and therefore must be reserved for the poorer\r\nsort of patients.\" He employed it _soepe et soepius_.\r\n\r\nThe _Pharmacopoeia Chirurgica_ of 1794, teaches: \"A decoction of\r\nthis plant has been found useful for scrofulous, impetiginous, and\r\nsyphilitic affections. Boil down half a pound of the bruised fresh\r\nherb in a gallon of distilled water to two quarts, and give from one\r\nto three pints in the twenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nFormerly the herb was called Bruisewort, and was thought of\r\nservice for contusions. It will remove stains, or grease almost as\r\nwell as soap, but contains no starch.\r\n\r\nSaponin, when smelt, excites long-continued sneezing; if injected or\r\nadministered, it reduces the frequency and force of the heart's\r\npulsations, paralyzing the cardiac nerves, and acting speedily on the\r\nvaso-motor centres, so as to arrest the movements of the heart, on\r\nwhich principle, when given in a diluted form, and in doses short of\r\nall toxic effects, it has proved of signal use in low typhoid\r\ninflammation of the lungs, where restorative stimulation of the heart\r\nis to be aimed at.\r\n\r\n[524] Also, likewise for passive suppression of the female monthly\r\nflow, it will act beneficially as a stimulant of the womb to incite its\r\nperiodical function.\r\n\r\nIn a patient who took a poisonous quantity of Saponin at Saint\r\nPetersburg all the muscular contractile sensitiveness was completely\r\nabolished; whilst, nevertheless, all the bodily functions were\r\nnormally performed. Per contra, this effect should be a curative\r\nguide in the use of Soapwort as a Simple.\r\n\r\nSaponin is found again in the root and unripe seeds of the Corn\r\nCockle, and in all parts of the Nottingham Catch-fly except the\r\nseeds; also in the wild Lychnis, and some others of the Pink tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOMON'S SEAL.\r\n\r\nThe Solomon's Seal (_Convallaria polygonatum_) is a handsome\r\nwoodland plant by no means uncommon throughout England, particularly\r\nin Berkshire, Bucks, Rants, Kent, and Suffolk.\r\n\r\nIt grows to the height of about two feet, bearing along its curved\r\ndrooping branches handsome bells of pure white, which hang down\r\nall along the lower side of the gracefully weeping flower stalks.\r\n\r\nThe oval leaves are ribbed, and grow alternately from the stem, for\r\nwhich reason the plant is called Ladder-to-heaven; or, \"more\r\nprobably,\" says Dr. Prior, \"from a confusion of _Seal de notre\r\nDame_ (our Lady's Seal), with _Echelle de notre Dame_ (our Lady's\r\nLadder).\" The round depressions resembling seal marks, which are\r\nfound on the root, or the characters which appear when it is cut\r\ntransversely, gave rise to the notion that Solomon, \"who knew the\r\ndiversities of plants, and the virtues of roots,\" had set his seal upon\r\nthis in testimony of its value to man as a medicinal root. The\r\nrhizome and [525] herb contain convallarin, asparagin, gum, sugar,\r\nstarch, and pectin.\r\n\r\nIn Galen's time the distilled water was used by ladies as a cosmetic\r\nfor removing pimples and freckles from the skin, \"leaving the place\r\nfresh, fair, and lovely.\" During the reign of Elizabeth it had great\r\nmedical celebrity, so that, as we learn from a contemporary writer,\r\n\"The roots of Solomon's Seal, stamped whilst fresh and green, and\r\napplied, taketh away, in one night, or two at the most, any bruise,\r\nblack or blue spots gotten by falls, or woman's wilfulness in\r\nstumbling upon their hasty husband's fists, or such like,\" and \"that\r\nwhich might be trewly written of this herb as touching the knitting\r\nof bones, would seem to some well nigh incredible; yea, although\r\nthey be but slenderly, and unhandsomely wrapped-up; but common\r\nexperience teacheth that in the worlde there is not to be found\r\nanother herbe comparable for the purpose aforesaid. It was given to\r\nthe patients in ale to drink--as well unto themselves as to their\r\ncattle--and applied outwardly in the manner of a pultis.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Lady's Seal was conferred on this plant by old writers, as\r\nalso St. Mary's Seal, _Sigillum sanctoe Marioe_.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs understand by Solomon's Seal the figure of a six-pointed\r\nstar, formed by two equilateral triangles intersecting each other, as\r\nfrequently mentioned in Oriental tales. Gerard maintains that the\r\nname, _Sigillum Solomunis_, was given to the root \"partly because\r\nit bears marks something like the stamp of a seal, but still more\r\nbecause of the virtue the root hath in sealing or healing up green\r\nwounds, broken bones, and such like, being stamp't and laid\r\nthereon.\"\r\n\r\nThe bottle of brass told of in the _Arabian Nights_ as fished up was\r\nclosed with a stopper of lead bearing the [526] \"Seal of our Lord\r\nSuleyman.\" This was a wonderful talisman which was said to have\r\ncome down from heaven with the great name of God engraved upon\r\nit, being composed of brass for the good genii, and iron for the evil\r\njinn.\r\n\r\nThe names _Convallaria polygonatum_ signify \"growth in a valley,\"\r\nand \"many jointed.\" Other titles of the plant are Many Knees,\r\nJacob's Ladder, Lily of the Mountain, White wort, and Seal wort.\r\n\r\nThe Turks eat the young shoots of this plant just as we eat\r\nAsparagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSORREL.\r\n(_See_ \"Dock,\" _page_ 157.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERNWOOD.\r\n\r\nSouthernwood, or Southern Wormwood, though it does not flower\r\nin this country, is well known as grown in every cottage garden for\r\nits aromatic fragrance. It is the _Artemisia Abrotanum_, a\r\nComposite plant of the Wormwood tribe, commonly known as \"Old\r\nMan.\" Pliny explains that this title is borne because of the plant\r\nbeing a sexual restorative to those in advanced years, as explained\r\nby Macer:--\r\n\r\n\"Hoec etiam venerem pulvino subdita tantum Incitat.\"\r\n\r\nPliny says further that this herb is potent against syphilis, and\r\n_veneficia quibus coitus inhibeatur_. Its odour is lemon-like, and\r\ndepends on a volatile essential oil which consists chiefly of\r\nabsinthol, and is common to the other Wormwoods. \"Abrotanum\" is\r\na Greek term. Another appellation of this plant is \"Lad's love,\" and\r\n\"Boy's love,\" from the making of an ointment with its [527] ashes,\r\nto be used by youngsters for promoting the growth of the beard.\r\n\"Cinis Abrotani barbam segnius tardiusque enascentem cum aliquo\r\ndictorum oleorum elicit.\" The plant is found in Spain and Italy as an\r\nindigenous herb. Its leaves and tops have a strong aromatic odour,\r\nand a penetrating warms bitterish taste which is rather nauseous. An\r\ninfusion, or tea, of the herb is agreeable: but a decoction is\r\ndistasteful, having lost much of the aroma. The plant was formerly\r\nin great repute as a cordial against hysterics, and to strengthen the\r\nstomach of a weakly person. It will expel both round worms and\r\nthread worms, whilst its presence is hostile to moths; and hence has\r\nbeen got one of its French names, \"Garde robe.\" Externally it will\r\npromote the growth of the hair. In Lincolnshire it is known as\r\n\"Motherwood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWBREAD, or CYCLAMEN.\r\n(_See page_ 450, \"Primrose.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEEDWELL.\r\n\r\nThis little plant, with its exquisite flowers of celestial blue, grows\r\nmost familiarly in our hedgerows throughout the Spring, and early\r\nSummer. Its brilliant, gemlike blossoms show a border of pale\r\npurple, or delicate violet, marked with deeper veins or streaks. But\r\nthe lovely circlet of petals is most fragile, and falls off at a touch;\r\nwhence are derived the names Speedwell, Farewell, Good-bye, and\r\nForget-me-not.\r\n\r\nSpeedwell is a Veronica (_fero_, \"I bring,\" _nikee_, \"victory\"),\r\nwhich tribe was believed to belong especially to birds. So the plant\r\nbears the name \"Birds' Eyes,\" as well as \"Blue Eyes,\" \"Strike Fires,\"\r\nand \"Mammy Die\" (because of the belief that if the herb were\r\nbrought [528] into a family the mother would die within the year).\r\nTurner calls the plant \"Fluellin,\" or \"Lluellin,\" a name \"the\r\nshentleman of Wales have given it because it saved her nose, which\r\na disease had almost gotten from her.\" Further, it is the Paul's\r\nBetony, called after Paulus OEgineta. The plant belongs to the\r\nScroflua-curing order.\r\n\r\nIt is related that a shepherd observed how a stag, whose\r\nhind-quarters were covered with a scabby eruption brought about through\r\nthe bite of a wolf, cured itself by rolling on plants of the Speedwell,\r\nand by eating its leaves. Thereupon he commended the plant to his\r\nking, and thus promoted his majesty's restoration to health.\r\n\r\nIn Germany it bears the title _Grundheele_, from having cured a\r\nking of France who suffered from a leprosy for eight years, which\r\ndisease is named _grund_ in German. At one time the herb was held\r\nin high esteem as a specific for gout in this country, but it became\r\nadulterated, and its fame suffered a downfall.\r\n\r\nThe only sensible quality of the Speedwell is the powerful\r\nastringency of its leaves, and this property serves to protect it\r\nfrom herbivorous foes.\r\n\r\nIt has been long held famous among countryfolk as an excellent\r\nplant for coughs, asthma, and pulmonary consumption. The leaves\r\nare bitter, with a rough taste; and a decoction of the whole plant\r\nstimulates the kidneys. The infusion promotes perspiration, and\r\nreduces feverishness. The juice may be boiled into a syrup with\r\nhoney, for asthma and catarrhs.\r\n\r\nWhen applied outwardly, it is said to cure the itch; and by some it\r\nhas been asserted that a continued use of the infusion will overcome\r\nsterility, if taken daily as a tea. The French still distinguish the\r\nplant as the [529] _The d'Europe_; and a century ago it was used\r\ncommonly in Germany in substitution for tea. As a medicine, by\r\nreason of its astringency, it became called _Polychresta herba\r\nveronica_.\r\n\r\n\"My freckles with the Speedwell's juices washed,\" says Alfred\r\nAustin, our Poet Laureate.\r\n\r\nThe Germans also name this plant _Ehren-preis_, or Prize of\r\nHonour; which fact favours the supposition of its being the true\r\n\"Forget-me-not,\" or _souveigne vous de moy_, as legendary on\r\nknightly collars of yore to commemorate a famous joust fought in\r\n1465 between the most accomplished champions of England and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe present Forget-me-not is a _Myosotis_, or Mouse Ear, or\r\nScorpion Grass.\r\n\r\nIn Somersetshire, the pretty little Germander Speedwell is known as\r\nCat's Eye: and because seeming to reflect by its azure colour the\r\nbeautiful blue firmament above, this pure-tinted blossom has got its\r\nname of _veron eikon_, the \"true image\" (_Veronica_); just as the\r\nnapkin with which a compassionate maiden wiped the face of Christ\r\non the morning of His crucifixion, held imprinted for ever on its\r\nfabric a miraculous portrait, which led to her being afterwards\r\ncanonised on this account as Saint Veronica.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Charles the Fifth of Spain is said to have derived\r\nmuch relief to his gout from the use of this herb. It contains\r\ntannin, and a particular bitter principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINACH.\r\n\r\nSpinach (_Lapathum hortense_) is a Persian plant which has been\r\ncultivated in our gardens for about two hundred years; and\r\nconsiderably longer on the Continent. Some say the Spinach was\r\noriginally brought [530] from Spain. It was produced by monks in\r\nFrance at the middle of the 14th century.\r\n\r\nThis is a light vegetable, easily digested, and rather laxative,\r\nbesides having some wonderful properties ascribed to its use. Its\r\nsub-order, the Saltworts (_Salsolaceoe_), are found growing in\r\nmarshes by the seashore, and as weeds by waste places, serving\r\nsome of them to expel worms.\r\n\r\n\"Spinach,\" says John Evelyn, \"if crude, the oft'ner kept out of\r\nSallets the better; but being boiled to a pulp; and without other\r\nwater than its own moisture, is a most excellent condiment with\r\nbutter, vinegar, or lemon, for almost all sorts of boiled flesh, and\r\nmay accompany a sick man's diet. 'Tis laxative and emollient, and\r\ntherefore profitable for the aged.\" Spinach is richer in iron than the\r\nyolk of the egg, which contains more than beef. Its juice produced\r\nin cooking the leaves without adding any water is a wholesome\r\ndrink, and improves the complexion.\r\n\r\nIt was with a delicate offering of \"gammon and spinach\" in his\r\nhands, Mr. Anthony Roley, of nursery fame, went so sadly a\r\nwooing:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ranula furtivos statuebat quaoerere amores:\r\n        Me miserum! tristi Rolius ore gemit.\r\n    Ranula furtivos statuebat quoerere amores,\r\n        Mater sive daret, sive negaret iter.\"\r\n\r\nA wild species of Spinach, the \"Good King Henry,\" grows in\r\nEngland, and is popular as a pot herb in Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINDLE TREE (Celastracoe).\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn, in our woody hedgerows a shrub becomes very\r\nconspicuous by bearing numerous rose-coloured floral capsules,\r\nstrikingly brilliant, each with a [531] scarlet and orange-coloured\r\ncentre. This is the Spindle Tree (_Euonymus_), so called because it\r\nfurnishes wood for spindles, or skewers, whence it is also named\r\nPrickwood, Skewerwood, and Gadrise, or Gad Rouge. The word\r\n\"gad\" is used in our western counties for a stick pointed at both ends\r\nto fasten down thatch. The Spindle Tree has a green bark, and\r\nglossy leaves, producing only small greenish flowers: whilst the\r\npendulous ornaments so brilliantly borne in autumn are four-lobed\r\ncapsules of a pale red hue, which open out and disclose ruddy\r\norange-coloured seeds wrapped in a scarlet arillus. It is further\r\nknown as the Louseberry Tree, from the fruit being applied to\r\ndestroy lice in children's heads, whilst its powdered bark will kill\r\nnits, and serve to remove scurf. Other popular titles owned by this\r\nshrub are \"gatter,\" \"gatten,\" and \"gatteridge.\" The ripe fruit, from\r\nwhich a medicinal tincture is prepared, furnishes euonymin, a\r\ngolden resin, which is purgative and emetic. This acts specially on\r\nthe liver, and promotes a free flow of bile. The plant also yields\r\nasparagin, and euonic acid. An ointment is made with the fruits: and\r\nthe powdered resin is given in doses of from half-a-grain to two\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, this tree is the Wahoo, or Burning\r\nBush. The green leaves of one species are eaten by the Arabs to\r\ninduce watchfulness. In allusion to the actively irritating properties\r\nof the shrub, its name, _Euonymus_, is associated with that of\r\nEuonyme, the Mother of the Furies. The bark is mildly aperient and\r\ncauses no nausea, whilst at the same time stimulating the liver\r\nsomewhat freely. To make its decoction add an ounce to a pint of\r\nwater, and boil together slowly. A small wineglassful may be given,\r\nwhen cool, for a dose two or three times in the day. Of the\r\nmedicinal tincture made from the bark with spirit [532] of wine, a\r\ndose of from five to ten drops may be taken with water in the same\r\nway. French doctors call the shrub Fusain, or _bonnet de pretre_\r\n(birretta). They give the fruit, three or four for a dose, as a\r\npurgative in rural districts: and employ the decoction, whilst\r\nadding some vinegar, as a lotion against mange in horses and cattle.\r\nAlso, they make from the wood when slightly charred a delicate\r\ncrayon for artists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPURGE.\r\n\r\nConspicuous in Summer by their golden green leaves, and their\r\nstriking epergnes of bright emerald blossoms, the Wood Spurge, and\r\nthe Petty Spurge, adorn our woodlands and gardens commonly and\r\nvery remarkably. Together with many other allied plants, foreign\r\nand indigenous, they yield from their severed stems a milky juice of\r\nmedicinal properties. The name _Euphorbioe _has been given to\r\nthis order from Euphorbus, the favourite physician of Juba, King of\r\nMauritania. All the Spurges possess the same poisonous principle,\r\nwhich may, however, be readily dissipated by heat; and then, in\r\nmany instances, the root becomes a nourishing and palatable food.\r\nFor example, the Manioc, a South American Spurge, furnishes a\r\njuice which has been known to kill in a few minutes. Nevertheless,\r\nits root baked, after first draining away the juice, makes a\r\nwholesome bread: and by washing the fresh pulp a starch is\r\nproduced which we know as Tapioca for our table. This is so\r\nsustaining that half-a-pound a day is said to be sufficient of itself\r\nto support a healthy man. The Indian rubber and Castor oil plants\r\nbelong also to this order of Euphorbioe.\r\n\r\nThe Wood Spurge, seen so frequently during our country rambles,\r\nsuggests by its spreading aspect a [533] clever juggler balancing on\r\nhis upturned chin a widely-branched series of delicate green saucers\r\non fragile stems, which ramify below from a single rod. Each saucer\r\nis the bearer again of sub-divided pedicels which stretch out to\r\nsupport other brightly verdant little leafy dishes; so that the whole\r\nsystem of well poised flowering perianths forms a specially\r\nhandsome candelabrum of emerald (cup-like) bloom. The botanical\r\ntitle Spurge is derived from _expurgare_, to act as a purgative,\r\nbecause of the acrid juice possessing this property. Gerard says \"the\r\njuice of the Wood Spurge, if given as physic, must be ministered\r\nwith discretion, and prepared with correctories by some honest\r\napothecary.\" Furthermore, this juice, \"if mixed with honey causeth\r\nhair to fall from that part which is anointed therewith, if it be done\r\nin the sun.\" Therefore, what better place may there be than a\r\nwooded English meadow on a sunny day for a clean and convenient\r\nnatural shave by those of the fair sex who, unhappily, own hirsute\r\nfacial appendages of which they would gladly be rid? _Euphorbia\r\nPeplus_, the Petty Spurge, is equally common, and often called\r\n\"wart weed.\" It signifies, \"Welcome to our house,\" and turns its\r\nflowers towards the sun. The Irish Spurge (_Hiberna_), is so powerful\r\nthat a small bundle of its bruised plant will kill the fish for\r\nseveral miles down a river. Yet another Spurge (_Lathyris_), a twin\r\nbrother, bears caper-like seeds which are sometimes dishonestly\r\npickled and sold as a (dangerous) substitute for the toothsome\r\nflowerbuds taken in sauce with our boiled mutton. The whole tribe\r\nof Spurges contains two hundred genera, and forms, what we call\r\nnow-a-days, \"a large order.\" The roots of several common kinds are\r\nused in making quack medicines, which are unsafe, [534] and\r\nviolent in action. Because of its milk-white sap the Wood Spurge\r\nbears the name in Somersetshire of Virgin Mary's Nipple: and yet in\r\nother parts, for the like reason, this plant is known as Devil's Milk.\r\nChemically, most of the Spurges contain caoutchouc, resin, gallic\r\nacid, and their particular acrid principle which has not been fully\r\ndefined. In France the rustics sometimes purge themselves with a\r\ndose of from six to twelve grains of the dried Wood Spurge: and its\r\njuice is used in this country as an application to destroy warts;\r\nalso, to be rubbed in behind the ear for ear-ache, or face-ache. The\r\nfamous surgeon, Cheselden, employed a noted plaster made with the\r\nresin of Spurge for relieving disease of the hip joint by\r\ncounterstimulation. But, to sum up, I would say with wise Gerard,\r\n\"these herbes by mine advice should not be received into the body,\r\nconsidering there be so many other good and wholesome potions to\r\nbe made with other herbes that may be taken without peril.\"\r\nNevertheless, a tincture prepared (H.) from the Wood Spurge, with\r\nspirit of wine, may be given admirably in much diluted doses for\r\ncuring the same severe symptoms which the plant produces when\r\ntaken to a toxical degree. Offensive diarrhoea, with prolapse of the\r\nlowest bowel, will be certainly remedied by four or five drops of\r\nthis tincture, first decimal strength, with water, every two or three\r\nhours: especially if, at the same time, there be a burning and\r\nstinging soreness of the throat. Said young Rosamond Berew\r\n(1460), in _Malvern Chase_, concerning \"a tall gaunt figure,\" noted\r\nfor her knowledge of herbs, sometimes called the Witch, but\r\nworshipped by the hinds and their children:--\"There is Mary, of\r\nEldersfield; I expect she has been on Berthill after Nettles to make a\r\ncapon sit, or to gather Spurges for ointments.\" [535]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTITCHWORT.\r\n\r\nThe Stitchworts, greater and less (_Stellaria holostea_), grow very\r\nabundantly as herbal weeds in all our dry hedges and woods, having\r\ntough stems which run closely together, and small white star-like\r\n(_stellaria_) blossoms.\r\n\r\nThese plants are of the same order (Chickweed) as the Alsine and\r\nthe small Chickweed. Their second name, Holostea, signifies \"all\r\nbones,\" because the whole plant is very brittle from the flinty\r\nelements which its structures contain.\r\n\r\nAs its title declares, the great Stitchwort has a widespread reputation\r\nfor curing the stitch, or sharp muscular pain, which often attacks one\r\nor other side of the body about the lower ribs.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the old Saxon leechdoms it was customary against a\r\nstitch to make the sign of the cross, and to sing three times over the\r\npart:--\r\n\r\n    \"Longinus miles lancea pinxit dominum:\r\n    Restet sanguis, et recedat dolor!\"\r\n\r\n    \"The spear of Longinus, the soldier, pierced our Saviour's side:\r\n    May the blood, therefore, quicken: and the pain no longer abide!\"\r\n\r\nOr some similar form of charm.\r\n\r\nGerard said of folk, in his day: \"They are wont to drink it in wine\r\n(with the powder of acorns) against the pain in the side, stitches, and\r\nsuch like.\" But according to Dr. Prior, the herb is named rather\r\nbecause curing the sting (in German _stich_) of venomous reptiles.\r\nIn country places the Stitchwort is known as Adder's meat, and the\r\nSatin Flower: also Miller's Star, Shirtbutton, and Milk Maid, in\r\nYorkshire: the early English name was Bird's Tongue.\r\n\r\n[536] About, Plymouth, it is dedicated to the Pixies; whilst the\r\nlesser variety is called White Sunday, because of its delicate white\r\nblossoms, with golden-dusted stamens. These were associated with\r\nthe new converts baptised in white garments on Low Sunday--the\r\nfirst Sunday after Easter--named, therefore, White Sunday.\r\n\r\nBut in some parts of Wales the Stitchwort bears the names of\r\nDevil's-eyes and Devil's-corn. Boys in Devonshire nickname the\r\nherb Snapjack, Snapcrackers, and Snappers.\r\n\r\nParkinson tells us that in former days it was much commended by\r\nsome to clear the eyes of dimness by dropping the fresh juice into\r\nthem. Again, Galen said: \"The seed is sharp and biting to him that\r\ntastes it.\"\r\n\r\nAs a modern curative Simple, the Stitchworts, greater and less,\r\nstand related to silica, a powerfully remedial preparation of highly\r\npulverised flint. This is because of the exquisitely subdivided flint\r\nfound abundantly dispersed throughout the structures of Stitchwort\r\nplants; which curative principle is eminently useful in chronic\r\ndiseases, such as cancer, rickets, and scrofula. It exercises a deep\r\nand slow action, such as is remedially brought to bear by the\r\nBethesda waters of America, and the powdered oyster shells of Sir\r\nSpencer Wells.\r\n\r\nThe fresh infusion should be steadily taken, a tea-cupful three times\r\ndaily, for weeks or months together. It may be made with a pint of\r\nboiling water to an ounce of the fresh herb. Likewise, the fresh plant\r\nshould be boiled and eaten as \"greens,\" so as to secure medicinally\r\nthe insoluble parts of the silica. This further serves against albumen,\r\nand sugar in the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[537] STONE CROP (_See House Leek, page 273_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY.\r\n\r\nProperly, our familiar Strawberry plant is a native of cold climates,\r\nand so hardy that it bears fruit freely in Lapland. When mixed with\r\nreindeer cream, and dried in the form of a sausage, this constitutes\r\nKappatialmas, the plum pudding of the Polar regions.\r\n\r\n\"Strawberry\" is from the Anglo-Saxon _Strowberige_, of which the\r\nfirst syllable refers to anything strewn. The wild woodland\r\nStrawberry (_Fragaria vesca_) is the progenitor of our highly\r\ncultivated and delicious fruit. This little hedgerow and sylvan plant\r\nhas a root which is very astringent, so that when held in the mouth it\r\nwill stay any flow of blood from the nostrils. Its berries are more\r\nacid than the garden Strawberry, and make an excellent cleanser of\r\nthe teeth, the acid juice dissolving incrustations of tartar without\r\ninjuring the enamel.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture is ordered (H.) from the berries of this\r\nWoodland Strawberry, which is of excellent service for nettle rash,\r\nor allied erysipelas: also for a suffocative swelling of the\r\nswallowing throat. \"_Ipsa tuis manibus sylvestri nata sub umbraa:\r\nmollia fraga leges_,\" says Ovid. An infusion of the leaves is of\r\nexcellent service in Dysentery.\r\n\r\nIt is incorrect to call the fruit a berry, because the edible,\r\nsucculent pulp is really a juicy cushion over which numerous small\r\nseeds are plentifully dotted; whilst the name Strawberry is a\r\ncorruption of Strayberry, in allusion to the trailing runners,\r\nwhich stray in all directions from the parent stock.\r\n\r\nBeing of very ancient date, the Strawberry is found widely diffused\r\nthroughout most parts of the world. [538] Among the Greeks its\r\nname _Komaros_, \"a mouthful,\" indicated the compact size of the\r\nfruit. By the Latins it was termed _Fragaria_, because of its delicate\r\nperfume.\r\n\r\nVirgil ranked it with sweet-smelling flowers; Ovid gave it a tender\r\nepithet; Pliny mentions the Strawberry as one of the native fruits of\r\nItaly; Linnaeus declared he kept himself free from gout by eating\r\nplentifully of the fruit; and Hoffman says he has known consumption\r\ncured by the same means.\r\n\r\nFrom Shakespeare we learn that in his day the fruit was grown in\r\nHolborn, now the centre of London. Gloster, when contemplating\r\nthe death of Hastings, wishes to get the Bishop of Ely temporarily\r\nout of the way, and thus addresses him:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lord of Ely--when I was last in Holborn\r\n    I saw good Strawberries in your garden there;\r\n    I do beseech you send for some of them.\"\r\n\r\nIn Elizabeth's time doctors made a tea from the leaves to act on the\r\nkidneys, and used the roots as astringent.\r\n\r\nAll former Herbalists agreed in pronouncing strawberries\r\nwholesome and beneficial beyond every other English fruit. Their\r\nsmell is refreshing to the spirits; they abate fever, promote urine,\r\nand are gently laxative. The leaves may be used in gargles for\r\nquinsies and sore mouths, but, \"if anyone suffering from a wound in\r\nthe head should partake of this fruit, it would certainly prove fatal,\"\r\nin accordance with a widespread superstition.\r\n\r\nSo wholesome are Strawberries, that if laid in a heap and left by\r\nthemselves to decompose, they will decay without undergoing any\r\nacetous fermentation; nor can their kindly temperature be soured\r\neven by exposure to the acids of the stomach. They are constituted\r\nentirely of soluble matter, and leave no residuum to [539] hinder\r\ndigestion. It is probably for this reason, and because the fruit does\r\nnot contain any actual nutriment as food, that a custom has arisen of\r\ncombining rich clotted cream with it at table, whilst at the same time\r\nthe sharp juices are thus agreeably modified.\r\n\r\n    \"Mella que erunt epulis, et lacte fluentia fraga\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Then sit on a cushion, and sew up a seam;\r\n    And thou shalt have Strawberries, sugar, and cream.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Wolsey regaled off this delicate confection with the Lords\r\nof the Star Chamber; and Charles Lamb is reported to have said,\r\n\"Doubtless, God Almighty could have made a better berry, but He\r\nnever did.\"\r\n\r\nParkinson advised that water distilled from strawberries is good for\r\nperturbation of the spirits, and maketh the heart merry.\r\n\r\nThe fruit especially suits persons of a bilious temperament, being \"a\r\nsurprising remedy for the jaundice of children, and particularly\r\nhelping the liver of pot companions, wetters, and drammers.\" \"Some\r\nalso do use thereof to make a water for hot inflammations in the\r\neyes, and to take away any film that beginneth to grow over them.\r\nInto a closed glass vessel they put so many strawberries as they\r\nthink meet for their purpose, and let this be set in a bed of hot horse\r\nmanure for twelve or fourteen days, being afterwards distilled\r\ncarefully, and the water kept for use.\"\r\n\r\nThe chemical constituents of the Strawberry are--a peculiar volatile\r\naroma, sugar, mucilage, pectin, citric and malic acids in equal parts,\r\nwoody fibre, and water.\r\n\r\nThe fruit is mucilaginous, somewhat tart and saccharine. It\r\nstimulates perspiration, and imparts a violet scent to the urine.\r\nWhen fermented for the purpose it yields an ardent spirit. If beaten\r\ninto a pulp [540] when ripe, and with water poured thereupon, it\r\nmakes a capital cooling drink which is purifying, and somewhat\r\nlaxative.\r\n\r\nStrawberries are especially suitable in inflammatory and putrid\r\nfevers, and for catarrhal sore throats. French herbalists direct that\r\nwhen fresh, and recently crushed, the fruit shall be applied on the\r\nface at night for heat spots and freckles by the sun. From the juice,\r\nwith lemon, sugar, and water, they concoct a most agreeable drink,\r\n_Bavaroise a la grecque_; also they employ the roots and leaves\r\nagainst passive hemorrhages, and in chronic diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, stewed strawberries, and strawberry jam are taken at\r\ndinner with roasted meats, or with chicken. This jam promotes a\r\nfree flow of urine.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that though most commonly wholesome and\r\nrefreshing, yet with some persons, particularly those of a strumous\r\nbodily habit, Strawberries will often disagree. The late Dr.\r\nArmstrong held a very strong opinion that the seed grains which lie\r\nsprinkled allover the outer surface of each pulpy berry are prone to\r\nexcite much intestinal irritation, and he advised his patients to suck\r\ntheir Strawberries through muslin, in order to prevent these\r\ndiminutive seeds from being swallowed.\r\n\r\nGerman legends dedicate Strawberries to the Virgin, with whom\r\nthey are reputed to have been a favourite fruit. She went a berrying\r\nwith the children on St. John's morning; and therefore no mother\r\nwho has lost a young child, will taste the delicacy then. The\r\nStrawberries symbolise little children who have died when young,\r\nand the mothers suppose they ascend to heaven concealed in the\r\nfragrant pulp.\r\n\r\nFrom the French, _fraise_, signifying the Strawberry [541] leaves\r\nborne on the family shield, is derived in Scotland the name of the\r\nFrazers. And eight of these (so called) leaves wrought in ornamental\r\ngold form a part of the coronet which our English dukes claim as\r\none of their proud insignia, conferred by Henry the Fourth. Being\r\ndesirous of adding fresh splendour to the Coronation of a\r\nLancastrian Prince he introduced these leaves into the regal Crown.\r\nAn earl's coronet has eight leaves: that of a marquis four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCORY.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Succory (_Cichorium intybus_) is a common roadside\r\nEnglish plant, white or blue, belonging to the Composite order, and\r\ncalled also Turnsole, because it always turns its flowers towards the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nIt blows with a blue blossom somewhat paler than the Cornflower,\r\nbut \"bearing a golden heart.\"\r\n\r\nIts fresh root is bitter, and a milky juice flows from the rind, which\r\nis somewhat aperient and slightly sedative, so that this specially\r\nsuits persons troubled with bilious torpor, and jaundice combined\r\nwith melancholy. An infusion of the herb is useful for skin eruptions\r\nconnected with gout. If the root and leaves are taken freely, they\r\nwill produce a gentle diarrhoea, their virtue lying chiefly in the\r\nmilky juice; and on good authority the plant has been pronounced\r\nuseful against pulmonary consumption. In Germany it is called\r\nWegwort, or \"waiting on the way.\" The Syrup of Succory is an\r\nexcellent laxative for children.\r\n\r\nThe Succory or Cichorium was known to the Romans, and was\r\neaten by them as a vegetable, or in salads. Horace writes (_Ode_\r\n31):\r\n\r\n        \"Me pascunt olivae,\r\n    Me chicorea, levesque malvae.\"\r\n\r\n[542] And Virgil, in his first _Georgic_, speaks of _Amaris intuba\r\nfibris_. When cultivated it becomes large, and constitutes Chicory,\r\nof which the taproot is used extensively in France for blending with\r\ncoffee, being closely allied to the Endive and the Dandelion.\r\n\r\nThis is the _Chicoree frisee_ when bleached, or the _Barbe de\r\nCapucin_. The cortical part of the root yields a milky saponaceous\r\njuice which is very bitter and slightly sedative. Some writers\r\nsuppose the Succory to be the Horehound of the Bible. In the\r\nGerman story, _The Watcher of the Road_, a lovely princess,\r\nabandoned for a rival, pines away, and asking only to die where she\r\ncan be constantly on the watch, becomes transformed into the\r\nwayside Succory.\r\n\r\nThis Succory plant bears also the name of _Rostrum porcinum_. Its\r\nleaves, when bruised, make a good poultice for inflamed eyes, being\r\noutwardly applied to the grieved place. Also the leaves when boiled\r\nin pottage or broths for sick and feeble persons that have hot, weak,\r\nand feeble stomachs, do strengthen the same.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the roots, if put into heaps and dried, are liable to\r\nspontaneous combustion. The taproot of the cultivated plant is\r\nroasted in France, and mixed with coffee, to which, when infused, it\r\ngives a bitterish taste and a dark colour.\r\n\r\nThe chemical constituents of Succory and Chicory are--in addition\r\nto those ordinarily appertaining to vegetables--inulin, and a special\r\nbitter principle not named.\r\n\r\nChicory, when taken too habitually or too freely, causes venous\r\npassive congestion in the digestive organs within the abdomen, and\r\na fulness of blood in the head. Both it and Succory, if used in excess\r\nas a medicine, will bring about amaurosis, or loss of visual power in\r\n[543] the retina of the eyes. Therefore, when given in a much\r\ndiluted form they are remedial for these affections.\r\n\r\nThe only benefit of quality which Chicory gives to coffee is by\r\nincrease of colour and body, with some bitterness, but not by\r\npossessing any aroma, or fragrant oil, or stimulating virtue. French\r\nwriters say it is _contra-stimulante_, and serving to correct the\r\nexcitation caused by the active principles of coffee, and therefore it\r\nsuits sanguineo-bilious subjects who suffer from habitual tonic\r\nconstipation. But it is ill adapted for persons whose vital energy\r\nsoon flags; and for lymphatic, or bloodless people its use should be\r\naltogether forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe flowers of Succory used to rank among the four cordial flowers,\r\nand a water was distilled from them to allay inflammation of the\r\neyes. The seeds contain abundantly a demulcent oil, whilst the\r\npetals furnish a glucoside which is colourless unless treated with\r\nalkalies, when it becomes of a golden yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDEW.\r\n\r\nThe Sundew (_Ros solis_, or _Drosera rotundifolia_) is a little plant\r\nalways eagerly recognised in marshy and heathy grounds by ardent\r\nyoung botanists. In the sun its leaves seem tipped with dew\r\n(_drosos_). It grows plentifully in Hampshire and the New Forest,\r\nbearing a cluster of hairy leaves in a stellate form, at the top of a\r\nslender stem. These leaves either from lack of other sustenance in so\r\nbarren a soil, or more probably as an advance in plant evolution to a\r\nhigher grade of development, excrete a sticky moisture or dew,\r\nwhich entangles unwary flies settling on the plant, and which serves\r\nto digest these victims therewith. Each of the long red [544] hairs on\r\nthe leaves is viscid, and possesses a small secreting gland at its top.\r\n\r\nSome writers say the word Sundew means \"sin\" ever, moist (dew).\r\nThe plant is also called Redrot, and Moor Grass, because the soil in\r\nwhich it grows is unwholesome for sheep.\r\n\r\nIt goes further by the additional names of Youthwort, and\r\nLustwort--_quia acrimonia sua sopitum veneris desiderium excitat_\r\n(Dodoeus). The fresh juice of the herb contains malic acid in a free\r\nstate, various salts, and a red colouring matter; also glucose, and a\r\npeculiar crystallisable acid. Cattle of the female gender are said to\r\nhave their copulative instincts excited by eating even a small\r\nquantity of the plant. Throughout Europe it has long been esteemed\r\na remedy of repute for chronic bronchitis and asthma; and more\r\nrecently, in the hands of homoeopathic practitioners, it has acquired\r\na fame for specifically curing whooping cough in its spasmodic\r\nstages, after the first feverishness of this malady has become\r\nsubdued. It signally lessens the frequency and force of the\r\nspasmodic attacks, besides diminishing the sickness.\r\n\r\nProvers who have pushed on themselves the administration of the\r\nSundew in toxical quantities, developed hoarseness, with\r\nexpectoration of yellow mucus from the throat and upper lungs, as\r\nwell as a hacking cough, and loss of flesh, this combination of\r\nsymptoms closely resembling the form of tubercular consumption\r\nwhich begins in the throat, and extends mischievously to the lungs.\r\nRegarded from such point the Sundew may be justly pronounced a\r\nhomoeopathic antidote to consumptive disease of the nature here\r\nindicated, when attacking spontaneously from constitutional causes.\r\n\r\n[545] Moreover, country folk notice that sheep who eat the Sundew\r\nin their pasturage have often a violent cough, and waste away. Dr.\r\nCurie, of Paris, fed cats with this plant, and they died subsequently\r\nwith all the symptoms of lung consumption, their chest organs being\r\nafterwards found studded with tubercular deposit though cats are not\r\nordinarily liable to tubercle.\r\n\r\nSo the Sundew may fairly be accepted as a medicinal Simple for\r\nlaryngeal and pulmonary consumption in its early stages, as well as\r\nfor whooping-cough, after the manner already explained. A tincture\r\nis made (H.) from the entire fresh plant, with spirit of wine, of\r\nwhich a couple of drops may be given in water several times a day,\r\nto a child of from four to eight years old, for confirmed\r\nwhooping-cough; and if this dose seems to aggravate the paroxysms,\r\nor to provoke sickness, it must be reduced in strength, and dilution.\r\n\r\nAlso from four to ten drops of the tincture may be administered with\r\na tablespoonful of cold water, two or three times a day, for several\r\nconsecutive weeks, to a consumptive adult, in the early stages of\r\nthis disease. Dr. Hughes (Brighton) has employed a diluted tincture\r\nof the Sundew (one part of this tincture admixed with nine parts of\r\nspirit of wine) in doses of from three to five drops with water,\r\nto a child of from three to eight years of age, for spasmodic\r\nwhooping-cough, several times in the day, with marked success; whilst\r\na larger dose or the stronger tincture served only to increase the\r\ncough in violence and frequency. The same results may perhaps follow\r\ntoo strong or full a dose to a consumptive patient, so that it must be\r\nregulated by the effects produced. Externally, the juice [546] of the\r\nfresh Sundew has been used for destroying warts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNFLOWER.\r\n\r\nThe Sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_) which is so popular and\r\nbrilliant an ornament of cottage gardens throughout England in\r\nsummer and autumn, is an importation of long standing, and has\r\nbeen called the Marigold of Peru.\r\n\r\nIts general nature and appearance are so well known as scarcely to\r\nneed any description. The plant is of the Composite order,\r\nindigenous to tropical America, but flourishing well in this country,\r\nwhilst bearing the name of _Heli-anthus_ (Sunflower), and smelling\r\nof turpentine when the disc of the flower is broken across.\r\n\r\nThe growing herb is highly useful for drying damp soils, because of\r\nits remarkable power of absorbing water; for which reason several\r\nacres of Sunflowers are now planted in the Thames Valley. Swampy\r\ndistricts in Holland have been made habitable by an extensive\r\nculture of the Sunflower, the malarial miasmata being absorbed and\r\nnullified, whilst pure oxygen is emitted abundantly.\r\n\r\nAn old rhyme declares, for some unknown reason:--\r\n\r\n    \"The full Sunflower blew\r\n    And became a starre of Bartholomew.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Sunflower has been given as most persons think because\r\nthe flowers follow the sun by day turning always towards its shining\r\nface. But Gerard says, about this alleged fact, he never could\r\nobserve it to happen, though he spared no pains to observe the\r\nmatter; he rather thought the flower to have got its title because\r\nresembling the radiant beams of the sun. Likewise, [547] some have\r\ncalled it Corona Solis, and Sol Indianus, the Indian Sunne-floure: by\r\nothers it is termed Chrysanthemum Peruvianum. In Peru this flower\r\nwas much reverenced because of its resemblance to the radiant sun,\r\nwhich luminary was worshipped there. In their Temples of the Sun\r\nthe priestesses were crowned with Sunflowers, and wore them in\r\ntheir bosoms, and carried them in their hands. The early Spanish\r\ninvaders found in these temples numerous representations of the\r\nSunflower wrought in pure virgin gold, the workmanship of which\r\nwas so exquisite that it far out-valued the precious metal whereof\r\nthey were made. Some country folk call it \"Lady eleven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nIf the buds of the Sunflower before expanding be boiled, and eaten\r\nwith butter, vinegar and pepper, after the manner of serving the\r\nJerusalem Artichoke, they are exceeding pleasant meat, surpassing\r\nthe artichoke moreover in provoking the _desiderium veneris_. The\r\nChinese make their finest yellow dye from the Sunflower, which\r\nthey worship because resembling the sun.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the plant contain much carbonate of potash; and the\r\nfruit, or seed, furnishes a fixed oil in abundance. The kernels of the\r\nseeds contain helianthic acid, and the pith of the plant will yield\r\nnine per cent. of carbonate of potash. The oil of the Sunflower may\r\nbe used as olive oil, and the cake after expressing away this oil\r\nmakes a good food for cattle. A medicinal tincture (H.) is prepared\r\nfrom the seed with rectified spirit of wine; also from the fresh juice\r\nwith diluted spirit. Each of these serves admirably against\r\nintermittent fever and ague, instead of quinine. The Sunflower is\r\nadored by the Chinese as the most useful of all vegetables. From its\r\nseeds the best oil is [548] extracted, and an excellent soap is made.\r\nThis oil burns longer than any other vegetable oil, and Sunflower\r\ncake is more fattening to cattle than linseed cake.\r\n\r\nThe flowers furnish capital food for bees, and the leaves are of use\r\nfor blending with tobacco. The stalk yields a fine fibre employed in\r\nweaving Chinese silk, and Evelyn tells of \"The large Sunflower, ere\r\nit comes to expand and show its golden face, being dressed as an\r\nartichoke, and eaten as a dainty.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant is closely allied in its species to the Globe Artichoke, and\r\nthe Jerusalom Artichoke (_girasole_), so named from turning _vers\r\nle soleil_, or _au soleil_, this being corrupted to \"Jerusalem,\" and\r\nits soup by further perversion to \"Palestine\" soup. The original\r\nMoorish name was Archichocke, or Earththorn.\r\n\r\nThe Globe Artichoke (_Cinara maxima anglicana_) of our kitchen\r\ngardens, when boiled and brought to table, has a middle pulp which\r\nis eaten as well as the soft delicate pulp at the base of each prickly\r\nfloret. \"This middle pulp,\" says Gerard, \"when boiled with the broth\r\nof fat flesh, and with pepper added, makes a dainty dish being\r\npleasant to the taste, and accounted good to procure bodily desire.\r\n(It stayeth the involuntary course of the natural seed).\" Evelyn tells\r\nus: \"This noble thistle brought from Italy was at first so rare in\r\nEngland that they were commonly sold for crowns apiece.\" Pliny\r\nsays: \"Carthage spent three thousand pounds sterling a year in\r\nthem.\" The plant is named Cinara, from _cinis_, \"ashes,\" because\r\nland should be manured with these. It contains phosphoric acid, and\r\nis, therefore, stimulating.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the Globe Artichoke afford somewhat freely on\r\nexpression a juice which is bitter, and acts as [549] a brisk diuretic\r\nin many dropsies. Such a constituent in the plant was known to the\r\nArabians for curdling milk.\r\n\r\nThe Jerusalem Artichoke (_Helianthus tuberosus_) is of the\r\nSunflower genus, having been brought at first from Brazil, and\r\nbeing now commonly cultivated in England for its edible tubers.\r\nThese are red outside, and white within; they contain sugar, and\r\nalbumen, with all aromatic volatile principle, and water. The tuber is\r\nthe _Topinambour_, and _Pois de terre_ of the French; having been\r\nbrought to Europe in 1617. It furnishes more sugar and less starch\r\nthan the Potato.\r\n\r\nIn 1620 the Jerusalem Artichoke was quite common as a vegetable\r\nin London: though, says Parkinson, when first introduced, it was \"a\r\ndainty for a queen.\" Formerly, it was baked in pies with beef\r\nmarrow, dates, ginger, raisins, and sack. The juice pressed out\r\nbefore the plant blossoms was used by the ancients for restoring the\r\nhair of the head, even when the person was quite bald.\r\n\r\nThe Sunflower has been from time immemorial a popular remedy\r\nfor malarial fevers in Russia, Turkey, and Persia, being employed as\r\na tincture made by steeping the stems and leaves in brandy. It is\r\nconsidered even preferable to quinine, sometimes succeeding when\r\nthis has failed, and being free from any of the inconveniences which\r\noften arise from giving large doses of the drug: whilst the pleasant\r\ntaste of the plant is of no small advantage in the case of children.\r\n\r\nCases in which both quinine and arsenic proved useless have been\r\ncompletely cured by the tincture of Sunflower in a week or ten days.\r\n\r\nGolden Sunflowers are introduced at Rheims into the stained glass\r\nof an Apse window in the church of St. Remi, with the Virgin and\r\nSt. John on either side of [550] the Cross, the head of each being\r\nencircled with an aureole having a Sunflower inserted in its outer\r\ncircle. The flowers are turned towards the Saviour on the Cross as\r\ntowards their true Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMARIND.\r\n\r\nThe Tamarind pod, though of foreign growth, has been much valued\r\nby our immediate ancestors as a household medicinal Simple; and a\r\nwell stocked jar of its useful curative pulp was always found in the\r\nstore cupboard of a prudent housewife. But of late years this\r\nserviceable fruit has fallen into the background of remedial\r\nresources, from which it may be now brought forward again with\r\nadvantage. The natives of India have a prejudice against sleeping\r\nunder the Tamarind; and the acid damp from the trees is known to\r\naffect the cloth of tents pitched under them for any length of time.\r\nSo strong is this prejudice of the natives against the Tamarind tree\r\nthat it is difficult to prevent them from destroying it, as they\r\nbelieve it hurtful to vegetation. The parent tree, Tamar Hindee,\r\n\"Indian date,\" is of East, or West Indian growth; but the sweet pulpy\r\njam containing shining stony seeds, and connected together by tough\r\nstringy fibres, may be readily obtained at the present time from the\r\nleading druggists, or the general provision merchant. It fulfils\r\nmedicinal purposes which entitle it to high esteem as a Simple for\r\nuse in the sick-room. Large quantities of this luscious date are\r\nbrought to our shores from the Levant and Persia, but before\r\nimportation the shell of the pod is removed; and the pulp ought not\r\nto exhibit any presence of copper, as shown on a clean steel\r\nknife-blade held within the same, though the fruit by nature possesses\r\ntraces of gold in its composition. Chemically, this pulp contains\r\ncitric, tartaric, [551] and malic acids, as compounds of potassium;\r\nwith gum, pectin and starch. Boiled syrup has been poured over it as\r\na preliminary. The fruit is sharply acid, and may be made into an\r\nexcellent cooling drink by infusion with boiling water, being\r\nallowed to become cold, and then strained off as an agreeable tea,\r\nwhich proves highly grateful to a fevered patient.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians first taught the use of Tamarinds, which contain an\r\nunusual proportion of acids to the sweet constituents. They are\r\nanti-putrescent, and exert a laxative action corrective of bilious\r\nsluggishness. A capital whey may be made by boiling two ounces of\r\nthe fruit with two pints of milk, and then straining. Gerard tells that\r\n\"travellers carry with them the pulp mixed with sugar throughout\r\nthe desert places of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nTamarinds are an efficient laxative if enough (from one to two\r\nounces) can be taken at a time: but this quantity is inconvenient, and\r\napt to clog by its excess of sweetness. Therefore a compressed form\r\nof the pulp is now in the market, known as Tamar Indien lozenges,\r\ncoated with chocolate. These are combined, however, with a\r\npurgative of greater activity, most probably jalap.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Tamarind is certainly antibilious, and by the virtue\r\nof its potash salts it tends to heal any sore places within the mouth.\r\nIn India it is added as an ingredient to punch; but the tree is\r\nsuperstitiously regarded as the messenger of the God of death.\r\n\r\nWhen acids are indicated, to counteract septic fever, and to cool the\r\nblood, whilst in natural harmony with the digestive functions, the\r\nTamarind will be found exceptionally helpful; and towards\r\nobviating [552] constipation a dessertspoonful, or more, of the pulp\r\nmay be taken with benefit as a compote at table, together with\r\nboiled rice, or sago. The name Tamarind is derived from _tamar_,\r\nthe date palm; and _indus_, of Indian origin. Formerly this fruit was\r\nknown as Oxyphoenica (sour date). Officinally apothecaries mix the\r\npulp with senna as an aperient confection. It is further used in\r\nflavouring curries on account of its acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTANSY.\r\n\r\nThe Tansy (_Tanacetum vulgare_--\"buttons,\"--bed of Tansy), a\r\nComposite plant very familiar in our hedgerows and waste places,\r\nbeing conspicuous by its heads of brilliant yellow flowers, is often\r\nnaturalized in our gardens for ornamental cultivation. Its leaves\r\nsmell like camphor, and possess a bitter aromatic taste; whilst young\r\nthey were commonly used in times past, and are still employed,\r\nwhen shredded, for flavouring cakes, puddings, and omelets. The\r\nroots when preserved with honey, or sugar, are reputed to be of\r\nspecial service against the gout, if a reasonable quantity thereof be\r\neaten fasting every day for a certain space. The fruit is destructive\r\nto round worms.\r\n\r\nThe seed also of the Tansy is a singular and appropriate medicine\r\nagainst worms: for \"in whatsoever sort taken it killeth and driveth\r\nthem forth.\" In Sussex a peasant will put Tansy leaves in his shoes\r\nto cure ague; and the plant has a rural celebrity for correcting female\r\nirregularities of the functional health. The name Tansy is\r\nprobably derived from the Greek word _athanasia_ which signifies\r\nimmortality, either, as, says Dodoeus, _quia non cito flos\r\ninflorescit_, \"because it lasts so long in flower,\" or, _quia ejus\r\nsuccus, vel oleum extractum cadavera a putredine conservat_ (as\r\nAmbrosius writes), \"because it is so capital [558] for preserving\r\ndead bodies from corruption.\" It was said to have been given to\r\nGanymede to make him immortal. The whole herb contains resin,\r\nmucilage, sugar, a fixed oil, tannin, a colouring matter, malic or\r\ntanacetic acid, and water. When the camphoraceous bitter oil is\r\ntaken in any excess it induces venous congestion of the abdominal\r\norgans, and increases the flow of urine.\r\n\r\nIf given in moderate doses the plant and its essential oil are\r\nstomachic and cordial, whether the leaves, flowers, or seeds be\r\nadministered, serving to allay spasm, and helping to promote the\r\nmonthly flow of women; the seeds being also of particular use\r\nagainst worms, and relieving the flatulent colic of hysteria. This\r\nherb will drive away bugs from a bed in which it is placed. Meat\r\nrubbed with the bitter Tansy will be protected from the visits of\r\ncarrion flies.\r\n\r\nTen drops of the essential oil will produce much flushing of the\r\nhead and face, with giddiness, and with beat of stomach; whilst half\r\na drachm of the oil has been followed by a serious result. But from\r\none to four drops may be safely given for a dose according to the\r\nsymptoms it is desired to relieve. Cases of epilepsy (not inherited)\r\nhave been successfully treated with the liquid extract of Tansy in\r\ndoses of a drop with water four times in the day. The essential oil\r\nwill toxically produce epileptic seizures.\r\n\r\nThe plant has been used externally with benefit for some eruptive\r\ndiseases of the skin; and a hot infusion of it to sprained, or\r\nrheumatic parts will give relief from pain by way of a fomentation.\r\nIn Scotland the dried flowers are given for gout, from half to one\r\nteaspoonful for a dose two or three times in the day; or an infusion\r\nis drank prepared from the flowers and seeds. This has kept\r\ninveterate gout at bay for years.\r\n\r\n[554] A medicinal tincture is made (H.) from the fresh plant with\r\nspirit of wine. From eight to ten drops of the same may be given\r\nwith a tablespoonful of cold water to an adult twice or three times in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nFormerly this was one of the native plants dedicated to the Virgin\r\nMary; and the \"good wives\" used to take a syrup of Tansy for\r\npreventing miscarriage. \"The Laplanders,\" says Linnoeus, \"use\r\nTansy in their baths to facilitate parturition.\"\r\n\r\nAt Easter also it was the custom, even, by the Archbishops, the\r\nBishops, and the clergy of some churches, to play at handball (so\r\nsay the old chroniclers), with men of their congregations, whilst a\r\nTansy cake was the reward of the victors, this being a confection\r\nwith which the bitter herb Tansy was mixed. Some such a corrective\r\nwas supposed to be of benefit after having eaten much fish during\r\nLent.\r\n\r\nThe Tansy cake was made from the young leaves of the plant mixed\r\nwith eggs, and was thought to purify the humours of the body. \"This\r\nBalsamic plant\" said Boerhaave, \"will supply the place of nutmegs\r\nand cinnamon.\" In Lyte's time the Tansy was sold in the shops\r\nunder the name of Athanasia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTARRAGON.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen herb Tarragon (_Artemisia dracunculus_) is cultivated\r\nin England, and more commonly in France, for uses in salads, and\r\nother condimentary purposes. It is the \"little Dragon Mugwort: in\r\nFrench, _Herbe au Dragon_\"; to which, as to other Dragon herbs,\r\nwas ascribed the faculty of curing the bites and stings of venomous\r\nbeasts, and of mad dogs. The plant does not fructify in France.\r\n\r\nIt is of the Composite order, and closely related to [555] our\r\ncommon Wormwood, and Southernwood, but its leaves are not\r\ndivided. This herb is a native of Siberia, but has been long grown\r\nlargely by French gardeners, and has since become widespread in\r\nthis country as a popular fruit, also for making a vinegar, and for\r\nadding to salads. The word Tarragon is by corruption \"a little\r\ndragon.\" French cooks commonly mix their table mustard with the\r\nvinegar of the herb.\r\n\r\nMany strange tales have been told about the origin of the plant, one\r\nof which, scarce worth the noting, runs that the seed of flax put into\r\na radish root, or a sea onion, and being thus set doth bring forth this\r\nherb Tarragon (so says Gerard).\r\n\r\nIn Continental cookery the use of Tarragon is advised to temper the\r\ncoldness of other herbs in salads, like as a Rocket doth. \"Neither,\"\r\nsay the authorities, \"do we know what other use this herb hath.\"\r\n\r\nThe volatile essential oil of Tarragon is chemically identical with\r\nthat of Anise, and it is found to be sexually stimulating. Probably by\r\nvirtue of its finely elaborated camphor it exercises its specific\r\neffects, the fact being established that too much camphor acts in the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn says of the plant \"'Tis highly cordial and friendly to the\r\nhead, heart, and liver.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHISTLES.\r\n\r\nThistles are comprised in a large mixed genus of our English weeds,\r\nand wild plants, several of them possessing attributed medicinal\r\nvirtues. Some of these are Thistles proper, as the _Carduus_, the\r\n_Cnicus_, and the _Carlina_: others are Teasels, Eryngiums, and\r\nGlobe Thistles, etc. Consideration should be given here to the\r\n_Carduus marianus_, or Lady's Thistle, the common [556] Carline\r\nThistle, the _Carduus benedictus_ (Blessed Thistle), the wild Teasel\r\n(_Dipsacus_), and the Fuller's Teasel, as Herbal Simples; whilst\r\nothers of minor curative usefulness are to be incidentally mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs a class Thistles have been held sacred to Thor, because, say the\r\nold authors, receiving their bright colours from the lightning, and\r\nbecause protecting those who cultivate them from its destructive\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn Devon and Cornwall Thistles are commonly known as Dazzels,\r\nor Dashel flowers. As a rule they flourish best in hot dry climates.\r\n\r\nThe _Carduus marianus_ (Lady's Thistle), Milk Thistle, or Holy\r\nThistle, grows abundantly in waste places, and near gardens\r\nthroughout the British Isles, but it is not a native plant. The term\r\n_Carduus_, or Cardinal, refers to its spring leaves, and the\r\nadjectives \"Marianus,\" \"Milk,\" and \"Holy,\" have been assigned\r\nthrough a tradition that some drops of the Virgin Mary's milk fell on\r\nthe herb, and became exhibited in the white veins of its leaves. By\r\nsome persons this Thistle is taken as the emblem of Scotland.\r\n\r\nDioscorides told of the Milk Thistle, \"the seeds being drunk are a\r\nremedy for infants that have their sinews drawn together.\" He\r\nfurther said: \"The root if borne about one doth expel melancholy,\r\nand remove all diseases connected therewith.\" Modern writers do\r\nlaugh at this: \"Let them laugh that win! My opinion is that this is the\r\nbest remedy that grows against all melancholy diseases.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the _Carduus marianus_ contains an oily bitter seed: the\r\ntender leaves in spring may be eaten as a salad; and the young\r\npeeled stalks, after being soaked, are excellent boiled, or baked in\r\npies. The heads of this Thistle before the flowers open may be [557]\r\ncooked like artichokes. The seeds were formerly thought to cure\r\nhydrophobia. They act as a demulcent in catarrh and pleurisy, being\r\nalso a favourite food of Goldfinches. A decoction of the seeds when\r\napplied externally is said to have proved beneficial in cases of\r\ncancer.\r\n\r\nThistle down was at one time gathered by poor persons and sold for\r\nstuffing pillows. It is very prolific in germination, and an old saying\r\nruns on this score:--\r\n\r\n    \"Cut your Thistles before St. John,\r\n    Or you'll have two instead of one.\"\r\n\r\nThis Milk Thistle (_Carduus marianus_) is said to be the empirical\r\nnostrum, _anti-glaireux_, of Count Mattaei.\r\n\r\n\"Disarmed of its prickles,\" writes John Evelyn, \"and boiled, it is\r\nworth esteem, and thought to be a great breeder of milk, and proper\r\ndiet for women who are nurses.\"\r\n\r\nIn Germany it is very popular for curing jaundice and kindred\r\nbiliary derangements. When taken by healthy provers in varying\r\nquantities to test its toxic effects the plant has caused distension of\r\nthe whole abdomen, especially on the right side, with tenderness on\r\npressure over the liver, and with a deficiency of bile in hard knotty\r\nstools, the colouring matter of the faeces being found by chemical\r\ntests present in the urine: so that a preparation of this Thistle\r\nmodified in strength, and considerably diluted in its doses proves\r\ntruly homoeopathic to simple obstructive jaundice through inaction\r\nof the liver, and readily cures the disorder. A tincture is prepared\r\n(H.) for medicinal use from equal parts of the root, and the seeds\r\n(with the hull on) together with spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nThe _Carduus benedictus_ (Blessed Thistle) was first [558]\r\ncultivated by Gerard in 1597, and has since become a common\r\nmedicinal Simple. It was at one time considered to be almost a\r\npanacea, and capable of curing even the plague by its antiseptic\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nThis Thistle was a herb of Mars, and, as Gerard says: \"It helpeth\r\ngiddiness of the head: also it is an excellent remedy against the\r\nyellow jaundice. It strengthens the memory, cures deafness, and\r\nhelps the bitings of mad dogs and venomous beasts.\" It contains a\r\nbitter principle \"cnicin,\" resembling the similar tonic constituent of\r\nthe Dandelion, this being likewise useful for stimulating a sluggish\r\nliver to more healthy action.\r\n\r\nThe infusion should be made with cold water: when kept it forms a\r\nsalt on its surface like nitre. The herb does not yield its virtues to\r\nspirit of wine as a tincture. Its taste is intensely bitter.\r\n\r\nThe Carline Thistle (_Carlina vulgaris_) was formerly used in\r\nmagical incantations. It possesses medicinal qualities very like those\r\nof Elecampane, being diaphoretic, and in larger doses purgative.\r\nThe herb contains some resin, and a volatile essential oil of a\r\ncamphoraceous nature, like that of Elecampane, and useful for\r\nsimilar purposes, as cordial and antiseptic. This Thistle grows on\r\ndry heaths especially near the sea, and is easily distinguished from\r\nother Thistles by the straw-coloured glossy radiate long inner scales\r\nof its outer floral cup. They rise up over the florets in wet weather.\r\nThe whole plant is very durable, like that of the \"everlasting\r\nflowers:\" Cudweed (_Antennaria_).\r\n\r\nThe name Carlina was given because the Thistle was used by\r\nCharles the Great as a remedy against the plague. It was revealed to\r\nhim when praying for some means to stay this pestilence which was\r\ndestroying his army. In his sleep there appeared to him an angel\r\nwho shot [559] an arrow from a cross bow, telling him to mark the\r\nplant upon which it fell: for that with such plant he might cure his\r\nsoldiers of the dire epidemic: which event really happened, the herb\r\nthus indicated being the said thistle. In Anglo-Saxon it was the\r\never-throat, or boar-throat.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent a large white blossom of this species is nailed\r\nupon cottage doors by way of a barometer to indicate the weather if\r\nremaining open or closing.\r\n\r\nThe wild Teasel (_Dipsacus sylvestris_) grows commonly in waste\r\nplaces, having tall stems or stalks, at the bottom of which are leaves\r\n(like bracts) united at their sides so as to form a cup, open upwards,\r\naround the base of the stalk, and hence the term \"_Dipsacus_,\"\r\nthirsty. This cup serves to retain rain water, which is thought to\r\nacquire curative properties, being used, for one purpose, to remove\r\nwarts. The cup is called Venus' basin, and its contents, says Ray, are\r\nof service _ad verrucas abigendas_; also it is named Barber's Brush,\r\nand Church Broom.\r\n\r\nThe Fuller's Teasel, or Thistle (_Dipsacus fullonum_) is so termed\r\nfrom its use in combing and dressing cloth,--_teasan_, to tease,--\r\nthree Teaselheads being the arms of the Cloth Weavers' Company.\r\nThis is found in the neighbourhood of the cloth districts, but is not\r\nconsidered to be a British plant. It is probably a cultivated variety of\r\nthe wild Teasel, but differs by having the bristles of its receptacles\r\nhooked.\r\n\r\nThe Sow Thistle (_Sonchus oleraceus_), named _sonchus_ because\r\nof its soft spikes instead of prickles, grows commonly as a weed in\r\ngardens, and having milky stalks which are reputed good for\r\nwheezy and short-winded folk, whilst the milk may be used as a\r\nwash for the face. It is named also \"turn sole\" because always facing\r\nthe sun, and Hare's Thistle (the hare's panacea, [560] says an old\r\nwriter, is the Sow Thistle), or Hare's Lettuce because \"when fainting\r\nwith the heat she recruits her strength with the herb; or if a hare eat\r\nof this herb in the summer when he is mad he shall become whole.\"\r\nAnother similar title of the herb is Hare's palace, since the creature\r\nwas thought to get shelter and courage from it. Some suppose that\r\nthe botanical term _Sonchus_ signifies _apo ton soon ekein_, from\r\nits yielding a salubrious juice.\r\n\r\nThe Sow thistle has been named also Milkweed. According to\r\ntradition it sometimes conceals marvels, or treasures; and in Italian\r\nstories the words, \"Open Sow Thistle\" are used as of like\r\nsignificance with the magical invocation \"Open sesame.\" Another\r\nname is \"Du Tistel\" or Sprout Thistle; because the plant may be\r\nused for its edible sprouts, which Evelyn says, were eaten by Galen\r\nas a lettuce. And Matthiolus told of the Tuscans in his day \"_Soncho\r\nnostri utuntur hyeme in acetariis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Melancholy Thistle (_Carduus heterophyllus_) has been held\r\ncurative of melancholy. It grows most frequently in Scotland and\r\nthe North of England, and is a non-prickly plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYME.\r\n\r\nThe Wild English thyme (_Thymus serpyllum_) belongs to the\r\nLabiate plants, and takes its second title from a Greek verb\r\nsignifying \"to creep,\" which has reference to the procumbent habit\r\nof the plant. It bears the appellation \"Brotherwort.\"\r\n\r\nTypically the _Thymus serpyllum_ flourishes abundantly on hills,\r\nheaths, and grassy places, having woody stems, small fringed\r\nleaves, and heads of purple flowers which diffuse a sweet perfume\r\ninto the surrounding air, [561] especially in hot weather.\r\nShakespeare's well known line alludes to this pleasant fact: \"I know\r\na bank where the wild Thyme grows.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Thyme is derived from the Greek _thumos_, as identical\r\nwith the Latin _fumus_, smoke, having reference to the ancient use\r\nof Thyme in sacrifices, because of its fragrant odour; or, it may be,\r\nas signifying courage (_thumos_), which its cordial qualities inspire.\r\nWith the Greeks Thyme was an emblem of bravery, and activity;\r\nalso the ladies of chivalrous days embroidered on the scarves which\r\nthey presented to their knights the device of a bee hovering about a\r\nspray of Thyme, as teaching the union of the amiable and the active.\r\n\r\nHorace has said concerning Wild Thyme:--\r\n\r\n    \"Impune tutum per nemus arbutos\r\n    Quaerunt latentes, et thyma deviae\r\n            Olentis uxores mariti.\"\r\n\r\nWild Thyme is subject to variations in the size and colour of its\r\nflowers, as well as in the habits of the varieties.\r\n\r\nThis wild Thyme bears also the appellation, \"Mother of Thyme,\"\r\nwhich should be \"Mother Thyme,\" in allusion to its medicinal\r\ninfluence on the womb, an organ which the older writers always\r\ntermed the \"Mother.\" Isidore tells that the wild Thyme was called\r\nin Latin, _Matris animula, quod menstrua movet_. Platearius\r\nsays of it: _Serpyllum matricem comfortat et mundificat. Mulieres\r\nSaliternitanoe hoc fomento multum utuntur_.\r\n\r\nDr. Neovius writes enthusiastically in a Finnish Journal on the\r\nvirtues of common Thyme in combating whooping cough. He has\r\nfound that if given _fresh_, from an ounce and a half to six ounces a\r\nday, mixed [562] with a little syrup, regularly for some weeks, it is\r\npractically a specific. If taken from the first, the symptoms vanish in\r\ntwo or three days, and in a fortnight the disease is expelled. The\r\nsimplicity, harmlessness, and cheapness of this remedy are great\r\nsupporters of its claims.\r\n\r\nOther titles of the herb are Pulial mountain, and creeping Thyme. It\r\nis anti-spasmodic, and good for nervous or hysterical headaches, for\r\nflatulence, and the headache which follows inebriation. The infusion\r\nmay be profitably applied for healing skin eruptions of various\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nVirgil mentions (in _Eclogue_ xi., lines 10, 11) the restorative value\r\nof Thyme against fatigue:--\r\n\r\n    \"Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus oestu\r\n    Allia, Serpyllumque herbas contundit olentes.\"\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n    \"Thestlis for mowers tired with parching heat\r\n    Garlic and Thyme, strong smelling herbs, doth beat.\"\r\n\r\nTournefort writes: \"A conserve made from the flowers and leaves of\r\nwild Thyme (_Serpyllum_) relieves those troubled with the falling\r\nsickness, whilst the distilled oil promotes the monthly flow in\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nThe delicious flavour of the noted honey of Hymettus was said to be\r\nderived from the wild Thyme there visited by the bees. Likewise the\r\nflesh of sheep fed on pasturage where the wild Thyme grows freely\r\nhas been said to gain a delicate flavour and taste from this source:\r\nbut herein a mistake is committed, because sheep are really averse\r\nto such pasturage, and refuse it if they can get other food.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of the leaves of Thyme, whether wild, or cultivated,\r\nmakes an excellent aromatic tea, the odour of which is sweet and\r\nfragrant, whilst the taste of the [563] plant is bitter and\r\ncamphoraceous. There is in some districts an old superstition that to\r\nbring wild Thyme into the house conveys severe illness, or death to\r\nsome member of the family.\r\n\r\nIn Grecian days the Attic elegance of style was said to show an\r\nodour of Thyme. Shenstone's schoolmistress had a garden:--\r\n\r\n    \"Where herbs for use and physic not a few\r\n    Of grey renown within those borders grew,\r\n    The tufted Basil,--_pun provoking_ Thyme,\r\n    The lordly Gill that never dares to climb.\"\r\n\r\nBacon in his _Essay on Gardens_ recommends to set whole alleys\r\nof Thyme for the pleasure of its perfume when treading on the plant.\r\nAnd Dioscorides said Thyme used in food helps dimness of sight.\r\n\r\nGerard adds: \"Wild Thyme boiled in wine and drunk is good against\r\nthe wamblings and gripings of the belly\": whilst Culpeper describes\r\nit as \"a strengthener of the lungs, as notable a one as grows.\" \"The\r\nThyme of Candy, Musk Thyme, or Garden Thyme is good against\r\nthe sciatica, and to be given to those that have the falling sickness,\r\nto smell to.\"\r\n\r\nThe volatile essential oil of Wild Thyme (as well as of Garden\r\nThyme) consists of two hydrocarbons, with thymol as the fatty base,\r\nthis thymol being readily soluble in fats and oils when heated, and\r\ntaking high modern rank as an antiseptic. It will arrest gastric\r\nfermentation when given judiciously as a medicine, though an\r\noverdose will bring on somnolence, with a ringing in the ears.\r\nOfficinally Thymol, the stearoptene obtained from the volatile oil of\r\n_Thymus vulgaris_, is directed to be given in a dose of from half to\r\ntwo grains.\r\n\r\n[564] Thymol is valued by some authorities more highly even than\r\ncarbolic acid for destroying the germs of disease, or for disinfecting\r\nthem. It is of equal service with tar for treating such skin affections\r\nas psoriasis, and eczema. When inhaled thymol is most useful\r\nagainst septic sore throat, especially during scarlet fever. At the\r\nhospital for throat diseases the following formula is ordered:\r\nThymol twenty grains to rectified spirit of wine three drachms, and\r\ncarbonate of magnesia ten grains, with water to three ounces; a\r\nteaspoonful to be used in a pint of water at 150 deg. Fahrenheit for each\r\ninhalation.\r\n\r\nAgainst ringworm an ointment made with one drachm of thymol to\r\nan ounce of soft paraffin is found to be a sure specific.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of thymol should consist of one part of thymol to ten parts\r\nof spirit of wine; and this is a convenient form for use to medicate\r\nthe wool of antiseptic respirators. As a purifying and cleansing\r\nlotion for wounds and sores, thymol should be mixed in the\r\nproportion of five grains thereof to an ounce of spirit of wine, an\r\nounce of glycerine, and six ounces of water.\r\n\r\nThe common Garden Thyme is an imported sort from the South of\r\nEurope. Its odour and taste depend on an essential oil known\r\ncommercially as oil of origanum.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of the Wild Thyme is Lemon Thyme (_Thymus\r\ncitriodorus_), distinguished by its parti-coloured leaves, and by its\r\nlilac flowers. Small beds of this Thyme, together with mint, are\r\ncultivated at Penzance, in which to rear millepedes, or hoglice,\r\nadministered as pills for several forms of scrofulous disease. The\r\nwoodlouse, sowpig, or hoglouse abounds with a nitrous salt which\r\nhas long found favour for curing scrofulous [565] disease, and\r\ninveterate struma, as also against some kinds of stone in the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe Hoglouse, or Millepede was the primitive medicinal pill. It is\r\nfound in dry gardens under stones, etc., and rolls itself up into a\r\nball when touched. These are also called Chiselbobs, and Cudworms.\r\nFrom three to twelve were formerly given in Rhenish wine for a\r\nhundred days together to cure all kinds of cancers; or they were\r\nsometimes worn round the neck in a small bag (which was absurd!).\r\nIn the Eastern counties they are known as \"Old Sows,\" or \"St.\r\nAnthony's Hogs.\" Their Latin name is _Porcellus Scaber_. The\r\nWelsh call this small creature the \"withered old woman of the\r\nwood,\" \"the little pig of the wood,\" and \"the little grey hog,\" also\r\n\"Grammar Sows.\" Their word \"gurach\" like \"grammar\" means a\r\ndried up old dame.\r\n\r\nCat Thyme (_Teucrium marum verum_) was imported from Spain,\r\nand is cultivated in our gardens as a cordial aromatic herb, useful in\r\nnervous disorders. Its flowers are crimson, and its bark is astringent.\r\nThe dried leaves may be given in powder or used in snuff. A\r\ntincture (H.) is made from the whole herb which is effectual against\r\nsmall thread worms. Provers of the herb in material toxic quantities\r\nhave experienced troublesome itching and irritation of the\r\nfundament. For similar conditions, and to expel thread worms, two\r\nor three drops of the tincture diluted to its first decimal strength\r\nshould be given with a spoonful of water three or four times in the\r\nday to a child of from four to six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOADFLAX.\r\n\r\nThe Toadflax, or Flaxweed (_Linaria vulgaris_) belongs to the\r\nscrofula-curing order of plants, getting its name from _linum_, flax,\r\nand being termed \"toad\" by a [566] mistaken translation of its Latin\r\ntitle _Bubonio_, this having been wrongly read _bufonio_,--\r\nbelonging to a toad,--or because having a flower (as the\r\nSnapdragon) like a toad's mouth: whereas \"bubonio\" means \"useful\r\nfor the groins.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an upright herbaceous plant most common in hedges, having\r\nleaves like grass of a dull sea green aspect, and bearing dense\r\nclusters of yellow flowers shaped like those of the garden\r\nSnapdragon, with spurs at their base. It continues in flower until the\r\nlate autumn. The Russians cultivate the Snapdragon for the oil\r\nyielded by its seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Toadflax has a faint disagreeable smell, and a bitter saline taste.\r\nIt acts medicinally as a powerful purge, and promoter of urine, and\r\ntherefore it is employed for carrying off the water of dropsies, being\r\nin this respect a well known rural Simple. Waller says: \"Country\r\npeople boil the whole plant in ale, and drink the decoction; but the\r\nexpressed juice of the fresh plant acts still more powerfully.\"\r\n\r\nIn many districts the herb is familiarly known as \"butter and eggs;\"\r\nand in Germany though dedicated to the Virgin it is called \"devil's\r\nband.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in Devonshire it goes by the names of \"Rambling,\" or\r\n\"Wandering Sailor,\" \"Pedler's Basket,\" \"Mother of Millions\" (the\r\nivy-leaved sort), \"Lion's Mouth\" and \"Flaxweed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen used externally an infusion of the herb acts as an anodyne to\r\nsubdue irritation of the skin, and it may be taken as a medicine to\r\nmodify skin diseases. The fresh juice is attractive to flies, but at\r\nthe same time it serves to poison them: so if it be mixed with milk,\r\nand placed where flies resort they will drink it and perish at the\r\nfirst sip.\r\n\r\n[567] As promoting a free flow of urine, the herb has been named\r\n\"Urinalis,\" or sometimes \"Ramsted.\" The flowers contain a yellow\r\ncolouring matter, mucilage, and sugar. In Germany they are given\r\nwith the rest of the plant for dropsy, jaundice, piles, and some\r\ndiseases of the skin. Gerard says: \"The decoction openeth the\r\nstoppings of the liver, and spleen: and is singular good against the\r\njaundice which is of long continuance.\" He advises an ointment\r\nmade from the plant stampt with lard for certain skin eruptions, and\r\na decoction made with four drachms of the herb in eight ounces of\r\nboiling water. The bruised leaves are useful externally for curing\r\nblotches on the face, and for piles.\r\n\r\nAn old distich says of the Toadflax as compared with the\r\nLarkspur:--\r\n\r\n    \"Esula lactescit: sine lacte Linaria crescit;\"\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n    \"Larkspur with milk doth flow:\r\n    Toadflax without milk doth grow,\"\r\n\r\n(alluding to the dry nature of the toadflax). To which the Hereditary\r\nMarshal of Hesse added the following line:--\r\n\r\n    \"Esoula nil nobis, sed dat linaria _taurum_,\"\r\n\r\nimplying that the herb was of old valued for its good effects when\r\napplied externally to piles as an ointment, a fomentation, or a\r\npoultice, each being made from the leaves and the flowers. The\r\noriginator of this ointment was a Dr. Wolph, physician to the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse, who only divulged its formula on the prince\r\npromising to give him _a fat ox_ annually for the discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMATO (or LOVE APPLE).\r\n\r\nThough only of recent introduction as a common vegetable in this\r\ncountry, and though grown chiefly [568] under glass for the table in\r\nEngland, yet the Tomato is so abundantly imported, and so\r\nextensively used by all classes now-a-days throughout the British\r\nIsles that it may fairly take consideration for whatever claims it can\r\nadvance as a curative Simple. Imported early in the present century\r\nfrom South America it remained for a while an exclusive luxury\r\nproduced for the rich like pine apples and melons. But gradually\r\nsince then the Tomato has steadily acquired an increasing\r\npopularity, and now large crops of the profitable fruit are brought\r\nfrom Bordeaux and the Channel Islands, to meet the demands of our\r\nEnglish markets. Much of the favour which has become attached to\r\nthis ruddy, polished, attractive-looking fruit is due to a widespread\r\nimpression that it is good for the liver, and a preventive of\r\nbiliousness. Nevertheless, rumours have also gone abroad that\r\nhabitual Tomato-eaters are especially liable to cancerous disease in\r\nthis, or that organ.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the Solanums the Tomato (_Lycopersicum_) is a plant\r\nof Mexican origin. Its brilliant fruit was first known as _Mala\r\noethiopica_, or the Apples of the Moors, and bearing the Italian\r\ndesignation _Pomi dei Mori_. This name was presently corrupted in\r\nthe French to _Pommes d'amour_; and thence in English to the\r\nepithet Love Apples, a perversion which shows by what curious\r\nmethods primary names may become incongruously changed. They\r\nare also called Gold Apples from their bright yellow colour before\r\ngetting ripe. The term _Lycopersicum_ signifies a \"wolf's peach,\"\r\nbecause some parts of the plant are thought to excite animal\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nThe best fruit is supposed to grow within sight, or smell of the sea.\r\nIt needs plenty of sunlight and heat. The quicker it is produced the\r\nfewer will be the seeds discoverable in its pulp.\r\n\r\n[568] Green when young, Tomatoes acquire a bright yellow hue\r\nbefore reaching maturity, and when ripe they are smooth, shining,\r\nfurrowed, and of a handsome red.\r\n\r\nChemically this Love Apple contains citric and malic acids: and it\r\nfurther possesses oxalic acid, or oxalate of potash, in common with\r\nthe Sorrel of our fields, and the Rhubarb of our kitchen gardens. On\r\nwhich account each of this vegetable triad is ill suited for gouty\r\nconstitutions disposed to the formation of irritating oxalate of lime\r\nin the blood. With such persons a single indulgence in Tomatoes,\r\nparticularly when eaten raw, may provoke a sharp attack of gout.\r\n\r\nOtherwise there are special reasons for supposing the Tomato to be\r\na wholesome fruit of remarkable purifying value.\r\n\r\nDr. King Chambers classifies it among remedies against scurvy,\r\ntelling us that Tomatoes mixed with brown bread make a capital\r\nsauce for costive persons. And the fruit owns a singular property in\r\nconnection with diseases of plants, suggesting its probable worth as\r\nprotective against bacterial germs, and microbes of disease in our\r\nbodies when it is taken as food, or medicinally. If a Tomato shrub\r\nbe uprooted at the end of the summer, and allowed to wither on the\r\nbough of a fruit tree, or if it be burnt beneath the fruit tree, it\r\nwill not only kill any blight which may be present, but will also\r\npreserve the tree against any future invasion by blight. The hostility\r\nthus evinced by the plant to low organisms is due to the presence of\r\nsulphur, which the Tomato shrub largely contains, and which is\r\nrendered up in an active state by decay, or by burning. Now\r\nremembering that digestion likewise splits up the Tomato into its\r\nchemical constituents, and releases its sulphur within us, we may\r\nfairly assume that persons [570] who eat Tomatoes habitually are\r\nlikely to have a particular immunity from bacterial and putrefactive\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nWherefore it is altogether improbable that Tomatoes will engender\r\ncancer, which is essentially a disease of vitiated blood, and of\r\ndegenerate cell tissue. Possibly the old exploded doctrine of\r\nsignatures may have suggested, or started this accusation against the\r\nmaligned, though unguarded Tomato: for it cannot be denied the\r\nguileless fruit bears a nodulated tumour-like appearance, whilst\r\nshowing, when cut, an aspect of red raw morbid fleshy structure\r\nstrangely resembling cancerous disease.\r\n\r\nVegetarians who eat Tomatoes constantly and freely claim that\r\ncancer is a disease almost unknown among their ranks; but an\r\nItalian doctor writing from Rome gives it as the experience of\r\nhimself and his medical brethren that cancer is as common in Italy\r\nand Sicily among vegetarians as with mixed eaters. Most of our\r\nAmerican cousins, who are the enterprising fathers of this medicinal\r\nfruit, persuade themselves that they are never in perfect health\r\nexcept during the Tomato season. And with us the ruddy Solanum\r\nhas obtained a wide popularity not simply at table as a tasty cooling\r\nsallet, or an appetising stew, but essentially as a supposed\r\nantibilious purifier of the blood. When uncooked it contains a\r\nnotable quantity of Solanin, and it would be dangerous to let\r\nanimals drink water in which the plant had been boiled. The Staff of\r\nthe Cancer Hospital at Brompton have emphatically declared \"they\r\nsee no ground whatever for supposing that the eating of Tomatoes\r\npredisposes to cancer.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless some country people in the remote American States\r\nattribute cancer to an excessively free use of the wild uncultivated\r\ntomato as food.\r\n\r\n[571] The first mention of this fruit by the London Horticultural\r\nSociety occurred in 1818.\r\n\r\nChemically in addition to the acids already named the Tomato\r\ncontains a volatile oil, a brown resinous extractive matter very\r\nfragrant, a vegeto-mineral matter, muco-saccharin, some salts, and\r\nin all probability an alkaloid. The whole plant smells unpleasantly,\r\nand its juices when subjected to heat by the action of fire emit a\r\nvapour so powerful as to provoke vertigo and vomiting.\r\n\r\nThe specific principles furnished by the Tomato will, when\r\nconcentrated, produce, if taken medicinally, effects very similar\r\nto those brought about by taking mercurial salts, viz., an\r\nulcerative-state of the mouth, with a profuse flow of saliva, and\r\nwith excessive stimulation of the liver: peevishness also on the\r\nfollowing day, with a depressing backache in men, suggesting\r\nparalysis, and with a profuse fluor albus in women. When given\r\nin moderation as food, or as physic, the fruit will remedy\r\nthis chain of symptoms.\r\n\r\nBy reason of its efficacy in promoting an increased flow of bile if\r\njudiciously taken, the Tomato bears the name in America of\r\nVegetable Mercury, and it has almost superseded calomel there as a\r\nbiliary medicinal provocative. Dr. Bennett declares the Tomato to\r\nbe the most useful and the least harmful of all known medicines for\r\ncorrecting derangements of the liver. He prepares a chemical extract\r\nof the fruit and plant which will, he feels assured, depose calomel\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nAcross the Atlantic an officinal tincture is made from the Tomato\r\nfor curative purposes by treating the apples, and the bruised fresh\r\nplant with alcohol, and letting this stand for eight days before it\r\nis filtered and strained.\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful of the tincture is a sufficient dose with one or two\r\ntablespoonfuls of cold water, three times in the day.\r\n\r\n[572] The fluid extract made from the plant is curative of any\r\nulcerative soreness within the mouth, such as nurses' sore mouth, or\r\ncanker. It should be given internally, and applied locally to the\r\nsore parts.\r\n\r\nSpaniards and Italians eat Tomatoes with pepper and oil. We take\r\nthem as a salad, or stewed with butter, after slicing and stuffing\r\nthem with bread crumb, and a spice of garlic.\r\n\r\nThe green Tomato makes a good pickle, and in its unripe state is\r\nesteemed an excellent sauce with rich roast pork, or goose. The fruit\r\nwhen cooked no longer exercises active medicinal effects, as its\r\nvolatile principles have now become dispelled through heat.\r\n\r\nBy the late Mr. Shirley Hibberd, who was a good naturalist, it was\r\nasserted with seeming veracity that the cannibal inhabitants of the\r\nFiji Islands hold in high repute a native Tomato which is named by\r\nthem the _Solanum anthropophagorutm_, and which they eat, _par\r\nexcellence_, with \"Cold Missionary.\" Nearer home a worthy dame\r\nhas been known with pious aspirations to enquire at the stationer's\r\nfor \"Foxe's book of To-Martyrs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chops and Tomato sauce\" were ordered from Mrs. Bardell, in\r\nPickwick's famous letter. \"Gentlemen!\" says Serjeant Buzfuz, in his\r\naddress to the jury, \"What does this mean?\" But he missed a point in\r\nnot going on to add--\"I need not tell you, gentlemen, the popular\r\nname for the Tomato is _love apple_! Is it not manifest, therefore,\r\nwhat the base deceiver intended?\"\r\n\r\n    \"A cucumber in early spring\r\n        Might please a sated Caesar,\r\n    Rapture asparagus can bring,\r\n        And dearer still green peas are:\r\n    Oh! far and wide, where mushrooms hide,\r\n        I'll search, as wide and far too\r\n    For watercress; but all their pride\r\n        Must stoop to thee,--Tomato!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[573] TORMENTIL.\r\n\r\nThe Tormentil (_Potentilla Tormentilla_) belongs to the tribe of\r\nwild Roses, and is a common plant on our heaths, banks, and dry\r\npastures. It is closely allied to the _Potentilla_, but bears only four\r\npetals on its flowers, which are of bright yellow. The woody roots\r\nare medicinally useful because of their astringent properties.\r\nSometimes the stem is trailing, making this the _Tormentilla\r\nReptans_, but more commonly it ascends. The name comes from\r\n_tormina_, which signifies such griping of the intestines as the herb\r\nwill serve to relieve, as likewise the twinges of toothache. The root\r\nis employed both for tanning leather, and for dyeing it by the\r\nthickened red juice. Furthermore through its astringency this root is\r\nadmirable for arresting bleedings. Vesalius considered it to be as\r\nuseful against syphilis as Guiacum, and Sarsaparilla. A decoction of\r\nTormentil makes a capital gargle, and will heal ulcers of the mouth\r\nif used as a wash. If a piece of lint soaked therein be kept applied to\r\nwarts, they will wither and disappear. Chemically the herb contains\r\n\"_Tormentilla Red_,\" identical with that of the Horse Chestnut, also\r\ntannic, and kinoric acids. The decoction should be made with four\r\ndrams to half-a-pint of water boiled together for ten minutes, adding\r\nhalf a dram of Cinnamon stick at the end of boiling; one or two\r\ntablespoonfuls will be the dose, or of the powdered root (dried) the\r\ndose will be from five to thirty grains.\r\n\r\n\"_In fluxu sanguinis, fluore albo, et mictu involuntario Tormentilla\r\nvalet_.\" Dr. Thornton (1810) tells of a labouring botanist who learnt\r\nthe powers of this root, and by its decoction, sweetened with honey,\r\ncured intractable agues, severe diarrhoeas, and scorbutic ulcers\r\n(which had been turned out of hospitals as inveterate), [578] also\r\nmany fluxes. Lord William Russell heard about this, and allowed\r\nthe poor man a piece of his park in which to cultivate the herb,\r\n\"_Non est vegetabile quod in fluxionibus alvi efficacius est_.\" The\r\nroot is so rich in tannin that it may be used instead of oak bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURNIP.\r\n\r\nThe Turnip (_Brassica Rapa_) belongs to the Cruciferous Cabbage\r\ntribe, being often found growing in waste places, though not truly\r\nwild. In this state it is worth nothing to man or beast; but, by\r\ncultivation, it becomes a most valuable food for cattle in the winter,\r\nand a good vegetable for our domestic uses. It exercises some\r\naperient action, and the liquid in which turnips are boiled will\r\nincrease the flow of urine. It is called also \"bagie,\" and was the\r\n\"gongyle\" of the Greeks, so named from the roundness of the root.\r\n\r\nWhen mashed, and mixed with bread and milk, the Turnip makes an\r\nexcellent cleansing and stimulating poultice for indolent abscesses\r\nor sores.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch eat small, yellow-rooted Turnips as we do radishes.\r\n\"Tastes and Turnips proverbially differ.\" At Plymouth, and some\r\nother places, when a girl rejects a suitor, she is said to \"give him\r\nturnips,\" probably with reference to his sickly pallor of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth of June--as the day of St. Botolph, the old turnip\r\nman,--is distinguished by various uses of a Turnip, because in the\r\nSaga, which figuratively represents the seasons, the seeds were\r\nsown on that day.\r\n\r\nIt is told that the King of Bithynia in some expedition against the\r\nScythians during the winter, and when at a great distance from the\r\nsea, had a violent [575] longing for a small fish known as _aphy_--a\r\npilchard, or anchovy. His cook cut a Turnip to a perfect imitation of\r\nits shape, which, when fried in oil, well salted, and powdered with\r\nthe seeds of a dozen black poppies, so deceived the king that he\r\npraised the root at table as an excellent fish.\r\n\r\nBeing likely to provoke flatulent distension of the bowels, Turnips\r\nare not a proper vegetable for hysterical persons, or for pregnant\r\nwomen. The rind is acrimonious, but the tops, when young and\r\ntender, may be boiled for the table as a succulent source of potash,\r\nand other mineral salts in the Spring.\r\n\r\nThe fermented juice of Turnips will yield an ardent spirit. When\r\nproperly cooked they serve to sweeten the blood. An essential\r\nvolatile oil contained in the root, chiefly in the rind, disagrees, by\r\nprovoking flatulent distension. This root is sometimes cut up and\r\npartly substituted for the peel and pulp of oranges in marmalade.\r\n\r\nIf Turnips are properly grown in dry, lean, sandy earth, a\r\nwholesome, agreeable sort of bread can be made from them, \"of\r\nwhich we have eaten at the greatest persons' tables, and which is\r\nhardly to be distinguished from the best of wheat.\" Some persons\r\nroast Turnips in paper under the embers, and serve them with butter\r\nand sugar. The juice made into syrup is an old domestic remedy for\r\ncoughs and hoarseness.\r\n\r\nA nice wholesome dish of Piedmontese Turnips is thus prepared:\r\nHalf boil your Turnip, and cut it in slices like half-crowns; butter a\r\npie dish, and put in the slices, moisten them with a little milk and\r\nweak broth, sprinkle over lightly with bread crumbs, adding pepper\r\nand salt; then bake in the oven until the Turnips become of a light\r\ngolden colour.\r\n\r\n[576] The Turnip, a navew, or variety of Rape (_navus_), should\r\nnever be sown in a rich soil, wherein it would become degenerate\r\nand lose its shape as well as its dry agreeable relish. Horace advised\r\nfield-grown Turnips as preferable at a banquet to those of garden\r\nculture. They may be safely eaten when raw, having been at one\r\ntime much consumed in Russia by the upper classes.\r\n\r\nTurnips have been introduced into armorial bearings to represent a\r\nperson of liberal disposition who relieves the poor.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson's famous illustration of false logic ran thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"If a man fresh Turnips cries:\r\n    But cries not when his father dies,\r\n    Is this a proof the man would rather\r\n    Possess fresh Turnips than a father?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTURPENTINE.\r\n\r\nFrom our English Pines, if their stems be wounded, the oleo-resin\r\nknown as Turpentine, can be procured. This is so truly a vegetable\r\nproduct, and so readily available for medical uses in every\r\nhousehold, being withal so valuable for its remedial and curative\r\nvirtues that no apology is needed for giving it notice as a Herbal\r\nSimple. The said oleo-resin which exudes on incising the bark\r\nfurnishes our oil, or so-called spirit of Turpentine. But larger\r\nquantities, and of a richer resin, can be had from abroad than it is\r\npracticable for England to provide, so that our Turpentine of\r\ncommerce is mainly got from American and French sources.\r\n\r\nThe oleo-resin consists of a resinous base and a volatile essential\r\noil, which is usually termed the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe _Pinus Picra_, or Silver Fir-tree, yields common [577]\r\nTurpentine; and to sleep on a pillow made from its yellow shavings\r\nis a capital American device for relieving asthma. Fir cones are\r\ncalled \"buntins,\" and \"oysters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tears,\" or resin drops, which trickle out on the stems of the Pine, if\r\ntaken, five or six of these tears in a day, will benefit chronic\r\nbronchitis, and will prove useful to lessen the cough of\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nWhen swallowed in a full dose, Turpentine gives a sensation of\r\nwarmth, and excites the secretion of urine, to which it imparts a\r\nviolet hue. It also promotes perspiration, and stimulates the\r\nbronchial mucous membrane. From eight to twenty drops may be\r\ngiven as a dose to produce these effects; but an immoderate dose\r\nwill purge, or intoxicate, and stupefy, causing strangury, and\r\ncongestion of the kidneys.\r\n\r\nFor bleeding from the lungs, five drops may be given, and repeated\r\nat intervals of not less than half-an-hour, whilst needed. The dose\r\nmay be taken in milk, or on sugar, or bread.\r\n\r\nWith the object of meeting for a curative purpose such symptoms\r\noccurring as disease which large doses of this particular drug will\r\nproduce, as if by poisoning, in a healthy person, quite small doses of\r\nTurpentine oil will promptly relieve simple congestion of the\r\nkidneys, when occurring as illness, it may be from exposure to cold,\r\nand accompanied by some feverishness, with frequent urination, as\r\nwell as a dragging of the loins. On which principle three or four\r\ndrops of a diluted tincture of Turpentine (made with one part of\r\nTurpentine to nine parts of spirit of wine), given in a spoonful of\r\nmilk every four hours, will speedily dispel the congestion, thus\r\nacting as an infallible specific, and a similar dose of the same\r\ntincture will quickly subdue rheumatic inflammation of the eyes.\r\n\r\n[578] A pleasant form in which to administer Turpentine, whether\r\nfor chronic bronchitis or for kidney congestion from cold, is a\r\nconfection. This may be made by rubbing up one part of oil of\r\nturpentine, with one part of liquorice powder, and with two parts of\r\nclarified honey. Combine the first two together, then add the honey.\r\nIf the Turpentine separates, pour it off, and add it again with plenty\r\nof rubbing until it unites. From half to one teaspoonful of this\r\nconfection, when mixed with two tablespoonfuls of peppermint-water,\r\nwill be found palatable, and may be repeated two or three\r\ntimes in the day.\r\n\r\nWhat is called Terebene, a most useful medicine for winter cough,\r\nis produced by the action of sulphuric acid on Turpentine. From five\r\nto ten drops may be taken on sugar three or four times in the day,\r\nand its vapour acts by inhalation as a very useful antiseptic sedative\r\nin consumptive disease of the lungs.\r\n\r\nExternally, Turpentine is stimulating and counter-irritating, and\r\nderivative. When applied to the skin, unless properly diluted,\r\nTurpentine will cause redness and smarting to a painful degree, with\r\nan outbreak of small blisters. As an embrocation, the oil of\r\nturpentine mixed with spirit of wine and camphor, together with\r\nsoap liniment, proves very efficacious for the relief of sciatica, and\r\nfor the chronic rheumatism of joints. Also, when compounded with\r\nwax and resin, it makes an excellent healing ointment for indolent,\r\nand unhealthy sores.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, Turpentine is commingled with peppermint water, and\r\nused as an external stimulant for chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nThe famous liniment of St. John Long consisted of oil of turpentine\r\none part, acetic acid one part, and liniment of camphor one part.\r\nThis was of admirable [579] service for rubbing along the spine to\r\nrelieve the irritability of the spinal nerves, and it has proved\r\neffectual to modify or prevent epileptic attacks, by being thus\r\napplied.  In cases of colic attending obstinate constipation, with\r\nstrengthless distension of the bowels, Turpentine mixed with starch\r\nor thin gruel, an ounce to the pint, and administered as a clyster,\r\nmakes one of the most reliable and safe evacuants.  Also as a\r\nremedy for round worms, six or eight drops (more or less according\r\nto age) may be safely and effectively given to a child on one or\r\nmore nights in milk.\r\n\r\nPills made from Chian Turpentine, which is got from Cyprus, were\r\nextolled by Dr. Clay of Manchester, in 1880, as a cure for cancer of\r\nthe womb, and for some other forms of cancerous disease.  From\r\nfive to ten grains were to be given in a pill, or mixed with mucilage\r\nas an emulsion, so that in all daily, after food, and in divided doses,\r\none hundred and eighty grains of this Turpentine were swallowed;\r\nand the quantity was gradually increased until five hundred grains a\r\nday were taken.  In many cases this method of treatment proved\r\nundoubtedly useful.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of powdered sulphur was also incorporated by Dr.\r\nClay in his Chian pills.  About the fourth day the pain was relieved,\r\nand the cancerous growth would melt away in a period of from four\r\nto thirteen weeks.  The arrest of bleeding and the continued freedom\r\nfrom glandular infection after a prolonged use of this Chian\r\nTurpentine were highly important points in the improvement\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Pinus Sylvestris_ an oil is distilled by steam, and of this\r\nfrom ten drops to a teaspoonful may be given for a dose, in milk, for\r\nchronic rheumatism or chronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\n[580] It is most useful in the treatment of diphtheria to burn in the\r\nroom, near the patient, a mixture of turpentine and tar in a pan or\r\ndeep dish. The fumes serve to dissolve the false membrane, and\r\nhave helped to effect a cure in desperate cases.\r\n\r\nThis tree had the Anglo-Saxon name Pimm, from pen, or pin, a\r\nsharp rock,--\"_ab acumine foliorum_,\" or perhaps as a contraction\r\nof _picinus_--pitchy. It furnishes from its leaves an extract, and the\r\nvolatile oil. Wool is saturated with the latter, and dried, being then\r\nmade into blankets, jackets, spencers, and stockings, for the use of\r\nrheumatic sufferers. There are establishments in Germany where the\r\nPine Cure is pursued by the above means, together with medicated\r\nbaths. Pine cones were regarded of old by the Assyrians as sacred\r\nsymbols, and were employed as such in the decoration of their\r\ntemples. From the tops of the Norway Spruce fir a favourite\r\ninvigorating drink is brewed which is known in the north as spruce\r\nbeer. This has an excellent reputation for curing scurvy, chronic\r\nrheumatism, and cutaneous maladies. Laplanders make a bread from\r\nthe inner bark of the Pine.\r\n\r\nTar (_pix liquida_) is furnished abundantly by the _Pinus\r\nSylvestris_, or Scotch Fir, and is extracted by heat. The tree is cut\r\ninto pieces, which are enclosed in a large oven constructed for the\r\npurpose: fire is applied, and the liquid tar runs out through an\r\nopening at the bottom. It is properly an empyreumatic oil of\r\nturpentine, and has been much used in medicine both externally and\r\ninternally. Tar water was extolled in 1744, by Bishop Berkley,\r\nalmost as a panacea. He gave it for scurvy, skin eruptions, ulcers,\r\nasthma, and rheumatism. It evidently promotes the secretions,\r\nespecially the urine.\r\n\r\n[581] Tar yields pyroligneous acid, oil of tar, and pitch: as well as\r\nguiacol and creasote.\r\n\r\nSyrup of tar is an officinal medicine in the United States of America\r\nfor chronic bronchitis, and winter cough. By this the expectoration\r\nis made easier, and the sleep at night improved. From one to two\r\nteaspoonfuls are given as a dose, with or without water. Also tar\r\npills are prepared of pitch and liquorice powder in equal parts, five\r\ngrains in the whole pill. Two or three of these may be taken twice or\r\nthree times in the day.\r\n\r\nTar ointment is highly efficacious against some forms of skin\r\ndisease; but in eczema and allied maladies of the skin, no\r\npreparation of tar should be employed as long as the skin is actively\r\ninflamed, or any exudation of moisture is secreted by it.\r\n\r\nDr. Cullen met with a singular practice respecting Tar. A leg of\r\nmutton was put to roast, being basted during the whole process with\r\ntar instead of butter. Whilst roasting, a sharp skewer was frequently\r\nthrust into the substance of the meat to let the juices escape, and\r\nwith the mixture of tar and gravy found in the dripping pan, the\r\nbody of the patient was anointed all over for three or four nights\r\nconsecutively, throughout all this time the same body linen being\r\nworn. The plan proved quite successful in curing obstinate lepra.\r\n\r\nA famous liquor called \"mum\" was concocted by the House of\r\nBrunswick, some of which was sent to General Monk. It was chiefly\r\nbrewed from the rind and tops of firs, and was esteemed very\r\npowerful against the formation of stone, and to cure all scorbutick\r\ndistempers. Various herbs, as best approved by the maker, were\r\ninfused with the mum in concocting it, such as betony, birch, burnet,\r\nbrooklime, elder-flowers, horse-radish, [582] marjoram, thyme,\r\nwater-cress, pennyroyal, etc., together with several eggs, \"the shells\r\nnot cracked or broken\"! The Germans, especially in Saxony, have so\r\ngreat a veneration for mum that they fancy their bodies can never\r\ndecay as long as they are lined, and embalmed with so powerful a\r\npreserver. The Swedes call the fir \"the scorbutick tree\" to this day.\r\n\r\nTar is soluble in its own bulk of spirit of wine, rectified, but\r\nseparates when water is added. Inhaled, its vapour is very useful in\r\nchronic bronchitis.\r\n\r\nTar water should be made by stirring a pint of tar with half a gallon\r\nof water for fifteen minutes, and then decanting it. From half-a-pint\r\nto a pint may be taken daily, and it may be used as a wash. Or from\r\ntwenty to sixty drops of tar are to be swallowed for a dose several\r\ntimes in the day, whether for chronic catarrhal affections, or for\r\nirritable urinary passages. Tar ointment is prepared with five parts\r\nof tar to two pounds of yellow wax. It is an excellent application for\r\nscald head in a child.\r\n\r\nJuniper tar oil is known as \"oil of Cade,\" and Birch tar is got from\r\nthe Butcher's Broom. A recognised plaster and an ointment are\r\nmade with Burgundy pitch (from the _Picus Picea_) and yellow\r\nwax.\r\n\r\nProbably the modern employment of carbolic acid, and its various\r\ncombinations--all derived from tar--for neutralising the septic\r\nelements of disease, and for acting as germicides, was unknowingly\r\nforestalled by the sagacious Right Reverend Lord Bishop of Cloyne,\r\nin his _Philosophical Reflections and Inquiries concerning the\r\nvirtues of Tar Water_, two centuries ago, when the cup which\r\n\"cheers but not inebriates\" was first told of by him, long before\r\nCowper. Bishop Berkley said, \"I do, verily, think there is not any\r\nother medicine whatsoever [583] so effectual to restore a crazy\r\nconstitution and to cheer a dreary mind: or so likely to subvert that\r\ngloomy empire of the spleen which tyranniseth over the better sort.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Great Expectations_, by Charles Dickens, the wife of Joe\r\nGargery is described as possessed of great faith in the curative\r\nvirtues of Tar water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALERIAN.\r\n\r\nThe great Wild Valerian, or Heal-all (from _valere_, to be well),\r\ngrows abundantly throughout this country in moist woods, and on\r\nthe banks of streams. It is a Benedicta, or blessed herb, being\r\ndedicated to the Virgin Mary, as preservative against poisons; and it\r\nbears the name of Capon's tail, from its spreading flowers.\r\n\r\nWhen found among bushes, in high pastures, and on dry heaths, it is\r\nsmaller, with the leaves narrower, but the roots more aromatic, and\r\nless nauseous.\r\n\r\nThe Valerian family of plants is remarkable for producing aromatic\r\nand scented genera, which are known as \"Nards\" (the Spikenard of\r\nScripture), and which are much favoured in Asiatic harems under\r\nseveral varieties, according to the situation of growth. Judas valued\r\nthe box of ointment made from the Spikenard (_Valeriana\r\nJatamansi_), with which Mary anointed the feet of our Saviour at\r\ntwo hundred denarii (L6: 9s: 2d.).\r\n\r\nWe have also the small Marsh Valerian, which is wild, and the\r\ncultivated Red Valerian, of our cottage gardens.\r\n\r\nThe roots of our Wild Valerian exercise a strange fascination over\r\ncats, causing an ecstasy of delight in these animals, who become\r\nalmost intoxicated when brought into contact with the Simple. And\r\nrats strangely exhibit the same fondness for these roots [584] which\r\nthey grub up. It has been suggested that the Pied Piper of Hamelin\r\nmay have carried one of such roots in his wallet.\r\n\r\nThey have been given from an early period with much success for\r\nhysterical affections, and for epileptic attacks induced by strong\r\nemotional excitement, as anger or fear: likewise, they serve as a safe\r\nand effectual remedy against habitual constipation when active\r\npurgatives have failed to overcome this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe plant is largely cultivated for the apothecary's uses about the\r\nvillages near Chesterfield, in Derbyshire. It is named Setwall in the\r\nNorth of England; and, says Gerard, \"No broths, pottage, or\r\nphysicall meats be worth anything if Setwall (a corruption from\r\nZedoar), be not there\":--\r\n\r\n    \"They that will have their heale,\r\n    Must put Setwall in their keale.\"\r\n\r\nThe Greeks employed one kind of Valerian named _Phu_ for\r\nhanging on doors and windows as a protective charm. But some\r\nsuppose this to have been a title of aversion, like our English\r\n\"faugh\" against any thing which stinks. Dr. Uvedale introduced the\r\nValerian into his garden, at Eltham Palace, before 1722; and\r\nUvedale House still exists in Church Street, at Chelsea.\r\nThe herb is sometimes called Cut-heal, not because, as Gerard\r\nthought, it is \"useful for slight cuts and wounds,\" but from its\r\nattributed efficacy in disorders of the womb (kutte cowth). Joined\r\nwith Manna, Valerian has proved most useful in epilepsy; and when\r\ncombined with Guiacum it has resolved scrofulous tumours. In\r\nGermany imps are thought to be afraid of it.\r\n\r\nAt Plymouth, the broad-leaved Red Valerian goes by the name of\r\nDrunken Sailor, and Bovisand soldier, the [585] larger sort being\r\ndistinguished as Bouncing Bess, whilst the smaller, paler kind is\r\nknown as Delicate Bess throughout the West of Devon.\r\n\r\nAn officinal tincture is made from the rhizome of Valerian with\r\nspirit of wine, of which from one to two teaspoonfuls may be given\r\nfor a dose, with a little water. Also a tincture (ammoniated) is\r\nprepared with aromatic spirit of ammonia on the rhizome, and this is\r\nconsiderably stronger; from twenty to forty drops is a sufficient\r\ndose with a spoonful or two of water.\r\n\r\nThe essential oil of Valerian lessens the sensibility of the spinal\r\ncord after primary stimulation of its nervous substance. A drop of\r\nthis oil in a spoonful of milk will be a proper dose: especially\r\nin some forms of constipation.\r\n\r\nUsed externally, by friction, the volatile oil of Valerian has proved\r\nbeneficial as a liniment for paralyzed limbs. The powdered root\r\nmixed in snuff is of efficacy for weak eyes.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated plant is less rich in the volatile oil than the wild\r\nherb. On exposure to the air Valerian oil becomes oxidised, and forms\r\nvalerianic acid, which together with an alcohol, \"borneol,\"\r\nconstitutes the active medicinal part of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe root also contains malic, acetic, and formic acids, with a resin,\r\ntannin, starch, and mucilage. It is by first arousing and then blunting\r\nthe reflex nervous activities of the spinal cord, that the oil of\r\nValerian overcomes chronic constipation.\r\n\r\nPreparations of Valerian act admirably for the relief of nervous\r\nheadache associated with flatulence, and in a person of sensitive\r\ntemperament. They likewise do good for infantine colic, and they\r\ndiminish the urea; when the urine contains it in excess.\r\n\r\n[586] The Greek Valerian is another British species, found growing\r\noccasionally in the North of England and in Scotland, being known\r\nas the blue Jacob's Ladder. It is also named \"Make bate,\" because\r\nsaid to set a married couple quarrelling if put in their bed. This must\r\nbe a play on its botanical name _Polemonium_, from the Greek\r\n_polemos_, war. It is called Jacob's Ladder from its successive pairs\r\nof leaflets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERBENA.\r\n\r\nThe Verbena, or Common Vervain, is a very familiar herb on waste\r\nground throughout England, limited to no soil, and growing at the\r\nentrance into towns and villages, always within a quarter of a mile\r\nof a house, and hence called formerly the Simpler's joy. Of old,\r\nmuch credit for curative virtues attached itself to this plant, though\r\nit is without odour, and has no taste other than that of slight\r\nastringency. But a reputation clings to the vervain because it used to\r\nbe held sacred, as \"Holy Herb,\" and was employed in sacrificial\r\nrites, being worn also around the neck as an amulet. It was called\r\n\"Tears of Isis\" \"Tears of Juno\" \"Persephonion\" and \"Demetria.\" The\r\njuice was given as a remedy for the plague. Vervain grew on\r\nCalvary: and Gerard says \"the devil did reveal it as a secret, and\r\ndivine medicine.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a slender plant with but few leaves, and spikes of small lilac\r\nflowers, when wild; but its cultivated varieties, developed by the\r\ngardener, are showy plants, remarkable for their brilliant colours.\r\n\r\nThe name Frogfoot has been applied to the Vervain because its leaf\r\nsomewhat resembles in outline the foot of that creature. Old writers\r\ncalled the plant _Verbinaca_ and _Peristerium_:--\r\n\r\n    \"Frossis fot men call it,\r\n    For his levys are like the frossy's fet.\"\r\n\r\n[587] The practice of wearing it round the neck became changed\r\nfrom a religious observance to a medicinal proceeding, for which\r\nreason it was ordered that the plant should be _bruised_ before\r\nbeing appended to the person; and thus it gained a name for curing\r\ninveterate headaches. Presently also it was applied to other parts as a\r\ncataplasm.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Vervain has fallen of late years into disfavour as a\r\nBritish Herbal Simple, though a pamphlet has recently appeared,\r\nwritten by a Mr. Morley, who strongly advises the revived use of\r\nthe herb for benefiting scrofulous disease. Therein it is ordered that\r\nthe root of Vervain shall be tied with a yard of white satin ribband\r\nround the neck of the patient until he recovers. Also an infusion and\r\nan ointment are to be prepared from the leaves of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe expressed juice of Verbena will act as a febrifuge; and the\r\ninfusion by its astringency makes a good lotion for weak and\r\ninflamed eyes, also for indolent ulcers, and as a gargle for a relaxed\r\nsore throat. The Druids gathered it with as much reverence as they\r\npaid to the Mistletoe. It was dedicated to Isis, the goddess of birth,\r\nand formed a famous ingredient in love philtres. Pliny saith: \"They\r\nreport that if the dining chamber be sprinkled with water in which\r\nthe herb Verbena has been steeped, the guests will be the merrier.\"\r\n\r\nGeoffrey St. Hilaire and Pasteur praise the Vervain highly as\r\nbeneficial against ailments of the hair, the fresh juice being\r\nespecially used.\r\n\r\nOther names of the plant are Juno's tears, Mercury's moist blood,\r\nPigeons' grass, and Columbine--the two latter being assigned\r\nbecause pigeons show a partiality for the herb.\r\n\r\nVerbena plants were named _Sagmina_ of old, because [588] cut up\r\nby the Praetor in the Capitol. When borne by an Ambassador\r\nVerbena rendered his person inviolable. All herbs used in sacred\r\nrites were probably known as Verbena. They were reported as of\r\nsingular force against the tertian and quartan agues; \"but one must\r\nobserve Mother Bombie's rules--to take just so many knots, or\r\nsprigs, and no more, lest it fallout that it do you no good, if you\r\ncatch no harm by it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVINE.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Vine (_Vitis vinifera_) has already been treated of\r\nhere under the heading \"Grapes,\" as employed medicinally whether\r\nfor the purgation of the bilious--being then taken crude, and scarcely\r\nripe,--or for imparting fat and bodily warmth in wasting disease by\r\neating the luscious and richly-saccharine berries.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the fumes exhaled from the wine-presses\r\nwhilst the juice is fermenting, prove highly beneficial as a\r\nrestorative for weakly and delicate young persons (an example\r\nwhich might be followed perhaps at our home breweries).\r\n\r\nConsumptive patients are sent with this view to the Gironde, where\r\nthe vapour from the wine vats is more stimulating and curative than\r\nin Burgundy. Young girls who suffer from atrophy are first made to\r\nstand for some hours daily in the sheds when the wine pressing is\r\ngoing forward. After a while, as they become less weak, they are\r\ndirected to jump into the wine press, where, with the vintagers and\r\nlabourers they skip about and inhale the fumes of the fermenting\r\njuice, until they sometimes become intoxicated, and even senseless.\r\nThis effect passes off after one or two trials, and the girls return to\r\ntheir labour with renewed strength and heightened colour, hopeful,\r\njoyous, and robust. The [589] vats of the famous Chateau d'yquem\r\nare the most celebrated of all for the wondrous cures they have\r\neffected even in cases considered past human aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET.\r\n\r\nThe Wild violet or Pansy (_Viola tricolor_) is found commonly\r\nthroughout Great Britain on banks and in hilly pastures, from\r\nwhence it has come to be cultivated in our gardens.\r\n\r\n_Viola_, a corruption of \"Ion,\" is a name extended by old writers to\r\nseveral other different plants. But the true indigenous representative\r\nof the Violet tribe is our Wild Pansy, or Paunce, or Pance, or Heart's\r\nease; called also \"John of my Pink,\" \"Gentleman John,\" \"Meet her i'\r\nth' entry; kiss her i' th' buttery\" (the longest plant name in the\r\nEnglish language), and \"Love in idleness.\"\r\n\r\n                \"A little Western flower,\r\n    Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,\r\n    And maidens call it--'Love in idleness.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom its coquettishly half hiding its face, as well as from some\r\nfancied picture in the throat of the corolla it has received various\r\nother amatory designations, such as \"cuddle me to you,\" \"tittle my\r\nfancy,\" \"jump up and kiss me,\" and \"garden gate\": also it is called\r\n\"Flamy,\" because its colours are seen in the flame of burning wood,\r\nand Flame Flower.\r\n\r\nThe term \"heart's ease\" has signified a cordial which is comforting\r\nto the heart. But the fact is that Pansies, \"pretty little Puritans,\"\r\nproduce anything but heart's ease if eaten, and their roots provoke\r\nsickness so speedily that these are sometimes employed as an\r\nemetic.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson derived the word Pansy from Panacea, [590] as curing\r\nall diseases; but this was a mistake, The true derivation is from the\r\nFrench _pensee_, \"thoughts,\" as Shakespeare knew, when making\r\nOphelia say: \"There is pansies--that's for thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nFrom its three colours it has been called the herb Trinity. A\r\nmedicinal tincture is made (H.) from the _Viola tricolor_ with spirit\r\nof wine, using the entire plant. Hahnemann found that the Pansy\r\nviolet, when taken by provers, served to induce cutaneous eruptions,\r\nor to aggravate them, and he reasoned out the curative action of the\r\nplant in small diluted doses for the cure of these symptoms, when\r\noccurring as disease.\r\n\r\n\"For milk crust and scald head,\" says Dr. Hughes (Brighton)--the\r\nplague of children, \"I have rarely needed any other medicine than\r\nthis _Viola tricolor_; and I have more than once given it in recent\r\nimpetigo (pustular eczema) for adults, with very satisfactory\r\neffects.\" For the first of these maladies the tincture should be given\r\nin doses of from three to six drops, to a child of from two to six or\r\neight years, three times a day in water.\r\n\r\nAgain, \"for curing scalled (from _scall_, a shell) head in children, a\r\nsmall handful of the fresh plant, or half a drachm of the dried herb,\r\nboiled for two hours in milk, is to be taken each night and morning;\r\nalso a bread poultice made with this decoction should be applied to\r\nthe affected part.\r\n\r\n\"During the first eight days the eruption increases, and the urine,\r\nwhen the medicine succeeds, has a nauseous odour like that of the\r\ncat, which presently passes off; then, as the use of the plant is\r\ncontinued, the scabs disappear, and the skin recovers its natural\r\nclean condition.\"\r\n\r\nThe root of the _Viola tricolor_ has similar properties [591] to that\r\nof Ipecacuanha, and is often used beneficially as a substitute by\r\ncountry doctors. An infusion thereof is admirable for the dysentery\r\nof young children. It loves a mixture of chalk in the soil where it\r\ngrows.\r\n\r\nThe Pansy contains an active chemical principle, \"violin,\" resin,\r\nmucilage, sugar, and the other ordinary constituents of plants. When\r\nbruised the plant, and especially its root, smells like peach kernels,\r\nor prussic acid. It acts as a slight laxative: and \"the distilled\r\nwater of the flowers\" says Gerard--\"cureth the French disease.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans style the Pansy _Stief-mutter_, because figuratively\r\nthe mother-in-law appears in the flower predominant in purple\r\nvelvet, and her own two daughters gay in purple and yellow, whilst\r\nthe two poor little Cinderellas, more soberly and scantily attired, are\r\nsqueezed in between. Again, another fable says, with respect to the\r\nfive petals and the five sepals of the Pansy, two of which petals are\r\nplain in colour, whilst each has a single sepal, the three other petals\r\nbeing gay of hue, one of these (the largest of all) having two sepals;\r\nthat the Pansy represents a family of husband, wife, and four\r\ndaughters, two of the latter being step-children of the wife.\r\n\r\nThe plain petals are the step-children, with only one chair; the two\r\nsmall gay petals are the daughters, with a chair each; and the large\r\ngay petal is the wife, with two chairs. To find the father, one must\r\nstrip away the petals until the stamens and pistils are bare. These\r\nthen bear a fanciful resemblance to an old man with a flannel\r\nwrapper about his neck, having his shoulders upraised, and his feet\r\nin a bath tub. The French also call the Pansy \"The Step-mother.\"\r\n\r\nThe chemical principle, \"violin,\" contained in the [592] flowering\r\nWild Pansy resembles emetin in action. If the dried plant is given\r\nmedicinally, from ten to sixty grains may be taken as a dose, in\r\ninfusion.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet Violet (_Viola odorata_) is well known for its delicious\r\nfragrance of perfume when growing in our woods, pastures, and\r\nhedge banks. The odour of its petals is lost in drying, but a pleasant\r\nsyrup is made from the flowers which is a suitable laxative for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nA conserve, called \"violet sugar,\" prepared from the flowers, has\r\nproved of excellent use in consumption. This conserve was made in\r\nthe time of Charles the Second, being named \"Violet plate.\" Also,\r\nthe Sweet Violet is thought to possess admirable virtues as a\r\ncosmetic. Lightfoot gives a translation from a Highland recipe in\r\nGaelic, for its use in this capacity, rendered thus: \"Anoint thy face\r\nwith goat's milk in which violets have been infused, and there is not\r\na young prince upon earth who will not be charmed with thy\r\nbeauty.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a legend that Mahomet once compared the excellence of\r\nViolet perfume above all other sweet odours to himself above all the\r\nrest of creation: it refreshes in summer by its coolness, and revives\r\nin winter by its warmth.\r\n\r\nThe Syrup of Sweet Violets should be made as follows: To one\r\npound of sweet violet flowers freshly picked, add two-and-a-half\r\npints of boiling water: infuse these for twenty-four hours in a glazed\r\nchina vessel, then pour off the liquid, and strain it gently through\r\nmuslin; afterwards add double its weight of the finest loaf sugar,\r\nand make it into a syrup, but without letting it boil.\r\n\r\nViolets are cultivated largely at Stratford-on-Avon for the purpose\r\nof making the syrup, which when mixed with almond oil, is a\r\ncapital laxative for children, [593] and will help to soothe irritative\r\ncoughs, or to relieve a sore throat.\r\n\r\nThe flowers have been commended for the cure of epilepsy and\r\nnervous disorders; they are laxative when eaten in a salad. The seeds\r\nare diuretic, and will correct gravel. The Sweet Violet contains the\r\nchemical principle \"violin\" in all its parts. A medicinal tincture (H.)\r\nis made from the entire fresh plant with proof spirit. It acts usefully\r\nfor a spasmodic cough, with hard breathing; also for rheumatism of\r\nthe wrists especially the right one.\r\n\r\nThis Violet is highly esteemed likewise in Syria, chiefly because of\r\nits being chosen for making the violet sugar used in sherbet. That\r\nwhich is drunk by the Grand Signior himself is compounded of\r\nsweet violets, and sugar.\r\n\r\nFrom the flower may be pleasantly contrived a pretty miniature bird,\r\nby carefully removing the calyx and corolla, leaving only the\r\nstamens and pistil attached to the receptacle; then the stigma forms\r\nthe bead and neck, whilst the anthers make a golden breast, and their\r\ntongues appear like a pair of green wings.\r\n\r\nMademoiselle Clarion, a noted French actress, had a nosegay of\r\nviolets sent her every morning of the season for thirty years; and to\r\nenhance the value of the gift, she stripped off the petals every\r\nevening, being passionately devoted to the flower, and took them in\r\nan infusion as tea.\r\n\r\nPliny recommended a garland of sweet violets as a cure for\r\nheadache. The Romans made wine of the flowers; and Napoleon the\r\nGreat claimed the Violet as _par excellence_ his own, for which\r\nreason he was often styled, _Le pere du violette_. This floral\r\nassociation took date from the time of his exile to Elba. The\r\nEmperor's return was alluded to among his adherents by a pass\r\n[594] word, \"_Aimez vous la Violette? Eh, bien! reparaitra au\r\nprintemps_.\"\r\n\r\nThe scentless Dog Violet (_Viola canina_) is likewise mildly\r\nlaxative, and possesses the virtues of the _Viola odorata_ in a lesser\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe Water Violet is \"feather foil\" (_Hottonia palustris_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIPER'S BUGLOSS.\r\n\r\nThe Simpler's passing consideration should be given to this tall\r\nhandsome English herb which grows frequently in gravel pits, and\r\non walls. It belongs to the Borage tribe (see page 60), and, in\r\ncommon with the Lungwort (_Pulmonaria_), the Comfrey, and the\r\nordinary Bugloss, abounds in a soft mucilaginous saline juice. This\r\nis demulcent to the chest, or to the urinary passages, being also\r\nslightly laxative. Bees favour the said plants, which are rich in\r\nhoney. Each herb goes by the rustic name of \"Abraham, Isaac, and\r\nJacob,\" because bearing spires of tricoloured flowers, blue, purple,\r\nand red. The Viper's Bugloss is called botanically _Echium_, having\r\nbeen formerly considered antidotal to the bite of (_Echis_) a viper:\r\nand its seed was thought to resemble the reptile's head: wherefore\r\nsuch a curative virtue became attributed to it after the doctrine of\r\nsignatures. \"_In Echio, herba contra viperarum morsus celeberrima,\r\nnatura semen viperinis capitibus simile procreavit_.\" Similarly the\r\nLungwort (or Jerusalem Cowslip), because of its spotted leaves, was\r\nheld to be a remedy for diseased lungs. This rarely grows wild, but\r\nit is of frequent cultivation in cottage gardens, bearing also the\r\nrustic name, \"Soldiers and Sailors,\" \"To-day and to-morrow,\" and\r\n\"Virgin Mary.\" From either of these herbs a fomentation of the\r\nflowers, or a decoction of the whole bruised plant, may be employed\r\nwith benefit locally to sore or raw surfaces: [595] whilst an infusion\r\nmade with three drams of the dried herb to a pint of boiling water\r\nwill be good in feverish pulmonary catarrh. By our ancestors viper\r\nbroth was thought to be highly invigorating: and vipers cooked like\r\neels were given to patients suffering from ulcers. The Sardinians\r\nstill take them in soup. Marvellous powers were supposed to be\r\nacquired by the Druids through their possession of a viper's egg, laid\r\nin the air, and caught before reaching the earth. All herbs of the\r\nBorage order are indifferently \"of force and virtue to drive away\r\nsorrow and pensiveness of the mind: also to comfort and strengthen\r\nthe heart.\" With respect to the Comfrey (see page 120), quite\r\nrecently the President of the Irish College of Surgeons has reported\r\nthe gradual disappearance of a growth (\"malignant, sarcomatous,\r\ntwice recurrent, and of a bad type\"), since steadily applying\r\npoultices of this root to the tumour. \"I know nothing,\" says\r\nProfessor Thomson, \"of the effects of Comfrey root: but the fact that\r\nthis growth has simply disappeared is one of the greatest surprises\r\nand puzzles I have met with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALLFLOWER.\r\n\r\nThe Wallflower, or Handfiower (_Cheiranthus cheiri_), or\r\nWall-gilliflower, has been cultivated in this country almost from time\r\nimmemorial, for its fragrance and bright colouring. It is found wild\r\nin France, Switzerland, and Spain, as the Keiri or Wallstock.\r\nFormerly this flower was carried in the hand at classic festivals.\r\nHerrick, in 1647, gave a more romantic origin to the name\r\nWallflower:--\r\n\r\n    \"Why this flower is now called so\r\n    List, sweet maids, and you shall know:\r\n    Understand this wilding was\r\n    Once a bright and bonny lad\r\n    [596] Who a sprightly springal loved,\r\n    And to have it fully proved\r\n    Up she got upon a wall\r\n    Tempting to slide down withal:\r\n    But the silken twist untied,\r\n    So she fell: and, bruised, she died.\r\n    Love, in pity of the deed,\r\n    And such luckless eager speed,\r\n    Turned her to this plant we call\r\n    Now the 'Floweret of the Wall.'\"\r\n\r\nIt is the only British species belonging to the Cruciferous order of\r\nplants, and flourishes best on the walls of old buildings, flowering\r\nnearly all the summer, though scantily supplied with moisture. We\r\nmay presume it was one of the earliest cultivated flowers in English\r\ngardens, as it is discovered on the most ancient houses.\r\n\r\nTurner, an early writer on Plants, calls it Wallgelouer, or\r\n\"Hartisease;\" and by Spencer it was termed Cherisaunce, as\r\nmeaning a cordial to the heart, this being really the herb to which\r\nthe name Heart's-ease was originally given. By rustics it is known\r\nalso as the \"Beeflower.\"\r\n\r\nBut the common Stock likewise bore the appellation, \"Gilliflower\":\r\nand the probability is, there was in old days, as Cotgrave suggests, a\r\npopular medicine or food \"for the passions of the heart,\" called\r\n\"gariofile,\" from the cloves which it contained, the Latin for a clove\r\nbeing _caryophyllum_. Hence it came about that the Wallflower, the\r\nPansy, and the Stock, by virtue of their cordial qualities, were alike\r\ncalled Gilliflowers, or Heart's-ease.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of the cultivated Wallflower, the Yellow and\r\nthe Red; those of a deep colour growing on old rockeries and similar\r\nplaces, are often termed [597] Bloody Warriors, and Bleeding Heart.\r\nThe double Wallflower has been produced for more than two\r\ncenturies. If the flowers are steeped in oil for some weeks, they\r\ncontribute thereto a stimulating warming property useful for friction\r\nto limbs which are rheumatic, or neuralgic. Gerard suggests that the\r\n\"oyle of Wallflowers is good for use to annoint a paralyticke.\" An\r\ninfusion of the flowers, made with boiling water, will relieve the\r\nheadache of debility, and is cordial in nervous disorders, by taking a\r\nsmall wine-glassful immediately, and repeating it every half-hour\r\nwhilst required. The aromatic volatile principles of the flowers are\r\n_caryophyllin_ and _eugenol_. \"This Wallflower,\" adds Gerard,\r\n\"and the Stock Gilliflower are used by certain empiricks and quack\r\nsalvers about love and lust,--matters which for modesty I omit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALNUT.\r\n\r\nThe Walnut tree is known of aspect to most persons throughout\r\nGreat Britain as of stately handsome culture, having many spreading\r\nbranches covered with a silvery grey bark, which is smooth when\r\nyoung, though thick and cracked when old.\r\n\r\nThe flowers occur in long, hanging, inconspicuous spikes or catkins,\r\nof a brownish green colour.\r\n\r\nThis tree is a native of Asia Minor, but is largely grown in England.\r\nThe Greeks called it \"Karuon,\" and the Latins \"Nux.\" Its botanical\r\ntitle is _Juglans regia_, a corruption of _glans_, the acorn, _jovis_,\r\nof Jupiter, or the \"royal nut of Jupiter,\" food fit for the Gods! Its\r\nfruit is also named Ban nut, or Ball nut, and Welsh nut, or Walnut--\r\nthe word Wal, or Welsh, being Teutonic for \"stranger.\" \"As for the\r\ntimber,\" said Fuller, \"it may be termed the English Shittim Wood.\"\r\n\r\n[598] The London Society of Apothecaries has directed that the\r\nunripe fruit of the Walnut should be used pharmaceutically on\r\naccount of its worm-destroying virtues.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that no insects will prey on the leaves of this tree.\r\nIn good seasons the produce of nuts is weighty enough to pay the rent\r\nof the land occupied by the trees.\r\n\r\nThe vinegar of the pickled fruit makes a very useful gargle for sore\r\nthroats, even when slightly ulcerated: and the green husks, or early\r\nbuds of the blossom, being dried to powder, serve in some places\r\nfor pepper.\r\n\r\nThe kernel of the nut (or the part of the inside taken at dessert)\r\naffords an oil which does not congeal by cold, and which painters\r\nfind very useful on such account.\r\n\r\nThis oil has proved useful when applied externally for troublesome\r\nskin diseases of the leprous type. Indeed, the Walnut has been justly\r\ntermed vegetable arsenic, because of its curative virtues in eczema,\r\nand other obstinately diseased conditions of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe tincture when made (H.) from the rind of the green fruit and the\r\nfresh leaves, with spirit of wine, and given in material doses, will\r\ndetermine in a sound person a burning itching eruption of the skin,\r\nof an eczematous character, lasting a long time, and leaving the\r\nparts which have been affected afterwards blue and swollen.\r\nReasoning from which it has been found that the tincture, in a\r\nreduced form, and of a diminished strength, proves admirably\r\ncurative of eczema, impetigo, and ecthyma.\r\n\r\nThe unripe fruit is laxative, and of beneficial use in thrush, and in\r\nulcerative sore throat. The leaves are said to be anti-syphilitic:\r\nlikewise the green husk, and unripe shell. Obstinate ulcers may be\r\ncured with sugar well moistened in a strong decoction of the leaves.\r\n\r\n[599] Well kept, kiln-dried Walnuts, of some age, are better\r\ndigested than newer fruit; in contrast to old gherkins, about which\r\nit has been humorously said, \"avoid stale Q-cumbers: they will\r\nW-up.\" In many parts of Germany the peasants literally subsist on\r\nWalnuts for several months together; and a young farmer before he\r\nmarries has to own a certain number of flourishing Walnut trees.\r\n\r\nThe bark or yellow skin which clothes the inner nut is a notable\r\nremedy for colic, being given when dried and powdered, in a dose\r\nof thirty or forty grains mixed with some carminative water; and the\r\nsame powder will help to expel worms.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Salernitan maxim, if the fruit of the Walnut be\r\neaten after fish, the digestion of the latter is promoted:--\r\n\r\n    Post pisces nux sit: post carnes case us esto.\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n    \"Take Welsh nuts after fish: take cheese after flesh meat.\"\r\n\r\nBut with some persons coughing is excited by eating Walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe roots, leaves, and rind yield a brown dye which is supposed to\r\ncontain iodine, and which gipsies employ for staining their skins. It\r\nalso serves to turn the hair black. A custom prevails (says a Latin\r\nsentence) among certain country folk to thrash the nuts out of their\r\nhusks while still on the trees, so that they may grow more\r\nabundantly the following year. In allusion to which practice the\r\nlines run thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nux, asinus, mulier, simili sunt lege ligata;\r\n    Haec trieo nil fructus faciunt si verbera cessant.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A woman, a donkey, a walnut tree--\r\n    The more you beat them, the better they be.\"\r\n\r\n[600] It is a fact, that by acting in this way, the barren ends of the\r\nbranches are knocked off, and fresh fruit-bearing twigs spring out at\r\neach side in their stead.\r\n\r\nWalnut cake, after expressing out the oil from the kernels, is a good\r\nfood for cattle, these kernels being the crumpled cotyledons or seed\r\nleaves. They contain oil, mucilage, albumen, mineral matter,\r\ncellulose, and water.\r\n\r\nThe rook has a most abiding affection for Walnuts. As soon as there\r\nis any fruit on the trees worth eating, this bird finds it out, and\r\nbrings it to the ground, choosing only those nuts which are soft\r\nenough for him to penetrate.\r\n\r\nOvid has left a charming little poem, _Nucis Elegia_--the plaint of\r\nthe Walnut tree--because beaten with sticks and pelted with stones,\r\nin return for the generosity with which it bestows on mankind its\r\nfair produce.\r\n\r\nA valuable medicinal Spirit is distilled by druggists from the fruit of\r\nthe Walnut. It is an admirable remedy for spasmodic indigestion,\r\nand to relieve the morning sickness of pregnancy. A teaspoonful of\r\nthe spirit (_Spiritus nucis juglandis_) may be given with half a\r\nwine-glassful of water every hour or two, for most forms of\r\nsickness, and the dose may be increased if necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Nucin,\" or \"juglon,\" is the active chemical principle of the several\r\nparts of the tree and its fruit.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, when slightly rubbed, emit a rich aromatic odour, which\r\nrenders them proof against the attacks of insects. Qualities of this\r\nodoriferous sort commended the tree to King Solomon, whose\r\n\"garden of nuts\" was clearly one of Walnuts, according to the\r\nHebrew word _eghoz_. The longevity of the tree is very great. There is\r\nat Balaclava, in the Crimea, a Walnut tree believed to be a thousand\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\n[601] The shade of the Walnut tree was held by the Romans to be\r\nbaneful, but the nuts were thought propitious, and favourable to\r\nmarriage as a symbol of fecundity. The ceremony of throwing nuts,\r\nfor which boys scrambled at a wedding, was of Athenian origin:--\r\n\r\n    \"Let the air with Hymen ring\r\n    Hymen! Io! Hymen sing!\r\n    Soon the nuts will now be flung:\r\n    Soon the wanton verses sung.\"\r\n                --_Catullus_.\r\n\r\nIn Italy this is known as the \"Witches tree.\" It is hostile to the oak.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of the American Black Walnut tree, which grows\r\nnaturally in Virginia, are of the highest curative value for scrofulous\r\ndiseases and for strumous eruptions. Chronic, indolent sores have\r\nbeen healed by these after every other remedy has failed. The parts\r\nshould be washed several times a day with a strong decoction of the\r\nleaves, and an infusion of the same should be taken internally; also\r\nof the extract made from the leaves, four grains in a pill each night\r\nand morning. For such purposes the leaves of our English Walnut\r\nare almost equally efficacious. To make an infusion one ounce\r\nshould be used to twelve ounces of boiling water. For a syrup mix\r\neight grains of the extract with an ounce of simple syrup: and give\r\none teaspoonful of this twice a day with water. Also apply to any\r\nsore some of the powdered leaves on lint soaked in the decoction.\r\nFor scrofulous joints, or glands, this treatment is invaluable. A green\r\nEnglish Walnut, boiled in syrup and preserved in the same, is an\r\nexcellent homely remedy for constipation. It will be noticed that the\r\nfruit becomes black by boiling. The Chinese put the raw kernels into\r\ntheir tea to give it a flavour.\r\n\r\n[602] By the Romans Walnuts were scattered among the people\r\nwhen a marriage was celebrated, as an intimation that the wedded\r\ncouple henceforth abandoned the frivolities of youth.\r\n\r\nThe \"titmouse\" walnut produces very delicate fruit, rich in oil, and\r\nwith thin shells, so that the little creatures can pierce the husks and\r\nshells while the fruit is still on the bough.\r\n\r\nNuts of various kinds, being charged with carbon and oil, are highly\r\nnutritious, but on account of this oil abounding, they are not readily\r\ndigested by some persons. In Southern Europe, the Chestnut is a\r\nstaple article of food, The title \"nut\" signifies a hard round lump,\r\nfrom _nodus_, a knot.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt wrote meaningly of the \"inexorably hard cocoa nut--\r\nmilky at heart.\" In Devonshire a plentiful crop of hazel nuts is\r\nbelieved to portend an unhealthy year:--\r\n\r\n    \"Many nits (nuts)\r\n    Many pits (graves).\"\r\n\r\nWhen eating almonds and raisins at dessert we get the nitrogenous\r\nfood of the nuts with the saccharine nourishment of the grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWART-WORT, OR WART-WEED.\r\n\r\nThis name has been commonly applied to the Petty Spurge, or to the\r\nSun Spurge, a familiar little weed growing abundantly in English\r\ngardens, with umbels of a golden green colour which \"turn towards\r\nthe sun.\" Its stem and leaves yield, when wounded, an acrid milky\r\njuice which is popularly applied for destroying warts, and corns. But\r\nour Greater Celandine (see page 92) or Swallow-wort is better\r\nknown abroad as the Wart-wort: and its sap is widely given in\r\nRussia for the cure, not only of [603] warts, but likewise of\r\ncancerous outgrowths, whether occurring on the skin surface, or\r\nassailing membranes inside the body. Conclusive evidence has been\r\nadduced of cancerous disease within the gullet and the stomach--as\r\nwell as on the external skin--being healed by this herb. Its sap, or\r\njuice, contains chemically, \"chelidonine,\" and \"sanguinarine,\" which\r\nlatter principle (obtained heretofore from the Canadian \"blood\r\nroot\"), is of long established repute for repressing fungoid\r\ngranulations of indolent ulcers, when powdered over them, and of\r\nquickly advancing their cure. Each principle exercises a narcotic\r\ninfluence on the nervous system, and will, thereby, relieve\r\nspasmodic coughs. Healthy provers have taken the fresh juice of the\r\nGreater Celandine in doses of from twenty to two hundred drops, at\r\nrepeated intervals; the results of the larger portions being drastic\r\npurgation, with persistent nervous torpor, and with an outbreak on\r\nthe skin of irritating, sore, itching eruptions. In some of the provers\r\nactive inflammatory congestion of the right lung ensued, with\r\nturgidity of the liver. The root beaten into a conserve with sugar will\r\noperate by stool, and by urine. For cancerous excrescences from five\r\nto ten drops of the fresh juice, or of the mother tincture (H.) should\r\nbe given steadily three times a day, this quantity being reduced if it\r\nshould move the bowels too freely. Some of the sap, or tincture,\r\nshould be also used outwardly as a lotion, either by itself, or diluted\r\nwith an equal quantity of cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER PLANTS (Other).\r\n\r\n(Water Dropwort, Water Lily, Water Pepper.)\r\n\r\nThe Water Dropwort--Hemlock (_oenanthe crocata_) is an umbelliferous\r\nplant, frequent in our marshes and ditches. [604] It is named\r\nfrom _oinos_, wine, and _anthos_, a flower, because its blossoms\r\nhave a vinous smell. A medicinal tincture is made (H.) from the\r\nripe fruit.\r\n\r\nThe leaves look like Celery, and the roots like parsnips. A country\r\nname of this plant is Dead-tongue, from its paralyzing effects on the\r\norgans of the voice. Of eight lads who were poisoned by eating the\r\nroot, says Mr. Vaughan, five died before morning, not one of them\r\nhaving spoken a word. Other names are Horsebane, from its being\r\nthought in Sweden to cause in horses a kind of palsy; (due, as\r\nLinnaeus thought, to an insect, _curculio paraplecticus_, which\r\nbreeds in the stem); and Five-fingered-root, from its five leaflets.\r\nThe roots contain a poisonous, milky juice, which becomes yellow\r\non exposure to the air, and which exudes from all parts of the plant\r\nwhen wounded. It will be readily seen that because of so virulent a\r\nnature the plant is too dangerous for use as a Herbal Simple, though\r\nthe juice has been known to cure obstinate and severe skin disease.\r\nIt yields an acrid emetic principle. The root is sometimes applied by\r\ncountry folk to whitlows, but this has proved an unsafe proceeding.\r\nThe plant has a pleasant odour. Its leaves have been mistaken for\r\nParsley, and its root for the Skirret.\r\n\r\nThe _OEnanthe Phellandrium_ (Water Fennel) is a variety of the\r\nsame species, but with finer leaves. Pliny gave the seeds, twenty\r\ngrains for a dose, against stone, and disorders of the bladder. Also\r\nthey have been commended for cancer.\r\n\r\nIn this country Water Lilies, or Pond Lilies, comprise the White\r\nWater Lily--a large native flower inhabiting clear pools and slow\r\nrivers--and the Yellow Water Lily, frequent in rivers and ditches,\r\nwith a yellow, globose flower smelling like brandy, so that it is\r\ncalled \"Brandy [605] bottle\" in Norfolk and other parts. Its root and\r\nstalks contain much tannin.\r\n\r\nThis latter Yellow Lily (_Nuphar lutea_) possesses medicinal\r\nvirtues against diarrhoea, such as is aggravated in the morning, and\r\nagainst sexual weakness. A tincture is made (H.) from the whole\r\nplant with spirit of wine. The second title, _lutea_, signifies\r\ngrowing in the mud; whilst the large white Water Lily is called\r\n_Nymphoea_, from occurring in the supposed haunts of the\r\nnymphs: and Flatter-dock.\r\n\r\nThe root stocks of the Yellow Water Lily, when bruised, and\r\ninfused in milk, will destroy beetles and cockroaches. The smoke of\r\nthe same when burnt will get rid of crickets.\r\n\r\nThe small Yellow Pond Lily bears the name of Candock, from the\r\nshape of its seed vessel, like that of a silver can or flagon, and this\r\nperhaps has likewise to do with the appellations, \"Brandy bottle\"\r\nand \"Water can:\" which latter may be given because of the half\r\nunfolded leaves floating on the water like cans.\r\n\r\nThe root of the larger white Water Lily is acrid, and will redden the\r\nskill if the juice is applied thereto.\r\n\r\nAn Ointment may be made with this juice to stimulate the scalp so\r\nas to prevent falling out of the hair. The root contains tannin and\r\nmucilage, it is therefore astringent and demulcent. Also the\r\nexpressed juice from the fresh leaves of this white Water Lily, the\r\n\"one sinless flower,\" if used as a head wash, will preserve the hair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, destinee des choses d'ici bas! Descendre des austerities du\r\nCloitre dans l'officine Cancaniere du perruquier!\"\r\n\r\nDutch boys are said to be extremely careful about plucking or\r\nhandling the Water Lily, for, if a boy fall [606] with the flowers in\r\nhis possession, he is thought to immediately become subject to fits.\r\n\r\nThe Water Pepper (_Polygonum Hydropiper_) or Arsmart, Grows\r\nabundantly by the sides of lakes and ditches in Great Britain. It\r\nbears a vulgar English name signifying the irritation which it causes\r\nwhen applied to the fundament; and its French sobriquet, _Culrage_,\r\nconveys the same meaning:--\r\n\r\n    \"An erbe is the cause of all this rage,\r\n    In our tongue called Culrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant is further known to rustics as Cyderach, or Ciderage, and\r\nas Red-knees, from its red angular points. It possesses an acrid,\r\nbiting taste, somewhat like that of the Peppermint, which resides in\r\nthe glandular dots sprinkled about its surface, and which is lost in\r\ndrying. Fleas will not come into rooms where this herb is kept. It is\r\ncalled also \"lake weed.\" A tradition says that the plant when placed\r\nunder the saddle will enable a horse to travel for some long time\r\nwithout becoming hungry or thirsty. The Scythians knew this herb\r\n(_Hippice_) to be useful for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Water Pepper has its virtues first taught by a beggar of Savoy.\r\nIt is admirable against syphilis, and to arrest sexual losses: being\r\nlong adored because \"healing the original sin.\"\r\n\r\nFarriers use it for curing proud flesh in the sores of animals, and\r\nwhen applied to the human skin, the leaves will serve the purpose of\r\na mustard poultice. Also, a piece of the plant may be chewed to\r\nrelieve toothache, as well as to cure small ulcers of thrush in the\r\nmouth, and pimples on the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe expressed juice of the freshly-gathered plant has been found\r\nvery useful in jaundice. From one to three [607] tablespoonfuls may\r\nbe taken for a dose. A hot decoction made from the whole herb\r\n(Water Persicaria) has a sheet soaked in it as an American remedy\r\nfor cholera, the patient being wrapped therein immediately when\r\nseized. This herb, together with the _Thuja Occidentalis_ (_Arbor\r\nvitoe_) makes the _Anti-venereo_ of Count Mattaei.\r\n\r\nAnother Polygonum, the great Bistort, or Snakeweed, and\r\nAdderswort, is a common wild plant in the northern parts of Great\r\nBritain, having bent or crooked roots, which are difficult to be\r\nextirpated, and are strongly astringent.\r\n\r\nThis Bistort, \"twice twisted,\" on account of its snake-like\r\nroot, was at one time called _Serpentaria_, _Columbrina_, and\r\n_Dracunculus_.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought to be the _Oxylapathum Britannicum_ and\r\n_Limonium_ of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe dose of the root in substance is from twenty to sixty grains. In\r\nthe North of England the plant is known as Easter Giant, and its\r\nyoung shoots are eaten in herb pudding. About Manchester they are\r\nsubstituted for greens, under the name of Passion's dock. The root\r\nmay be employed both externally as a poultice, and inwardly as a\r\ndecoction, when an astringent is needed. It is most useful for a\r\nspongy state of the gums, attended with looseness of the teeth.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in moist meadows, but is not common. Its roots are\r\nreddish of colour inside.\r\n\r\nThe Bistort contains starch, and much tannin; likewise its rhizome\r\n(crooked root) furnishes gallic acid. The decoction is to be made\r\nwith an ounce of the bruised root boiled in a pint of water; one\r\ntablespoonful of this may be given every two hours in passive\r\nbleedings, and for simple diarrhoea. Other names for the [608] plant\r\nare Osterick, and Twice writhen (_bis tort_), Red legs, and Man\r\ngiant, from the French _mangeant_, eatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITETHORN.\r\n(_See_ \"Hawthorn,\" _page 245_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHORTLEBERRY.\r\n(_See_ \"Bilberry,\" _page 52_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODRUFF.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Sweet Woodruff (_Asperula odorata_), it is a\r\nfavourite little plant growing commonly in our woods and gardens,\r\nwith a pleasant smell which, like the good deeds of the worthiest\r\npersons, delights by its fragrance most after death. This herb is of\r\nthe Rubiaceous order, and gets its botanical name from the Latin\r\n_asper_, rough, in allusion to the rough leaves possessed by its\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIt may be readily recognised by its small white flowers set on a\r\nslender stalk, with narrow leaves growing round it in successive\r\nwhorls, just as in the Cleaver (Goosegrass), which belongs to the\r\nsame order.\r\n\r\nThe name Woodruffe has been whimsically spelt Woodderowffe,\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\n    Double U, double O, double D, E\r\n    R, O, double U, double F, E.\r\n\r\nIts terminal syllable, \"ruff,\" is derived from _rofe_, a wheel,--with\r\nthe diminutive _rouelle_, a little wheel or rowel, like that of an\r\nancient spur,--which the verticillate leaves of this herb closely\r\nresemble. They serve to remind us also of good Queen Bess, and of\r\nthe high, starched, old-fashioned ruff which she is shown to wear\r\n[609] in her portraits. Therefore, the plant is known as Woodrowel.\r\n\r\nWhen freshly gathered, it has but little odour, but when dried it\r\nexhales a delightful and lasting aroma, like the scent of meadow\r\ngrass, or of peach blossoms.\r\n\r\nA fragrant and exhilarating tea may be made from the leaves and\r\nblossoms of the sweet Woodruffe, and this is found to be of service\r\nin correcting sluggishness of the liver. \"When it is desired,\" says\r\nMr. Johns, \"to preserve the leaves merely for their scent, the stem\r\nshould be cut through just below and above a joint, and the leaves\r\npressed in such a way as not to destroy their star-like arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nGerard tells us: \"The flowers are of a very sweet smell, as is the rest\r\nof the herb, which, being made up into garlands or bundles, and\r\nhanged up in houses, in the heat of summer, doth very well attemper\r\nthe air, cool and make fresh the place, to the delight and comfort of\r\nsuch as are therein.\"\r\n\r\nThe agreeable odour of this sweet Woodruffe is due to a chemical\r\nprinciple named \"coumarin,\" which powerfully affects the brain;\r\nand the plant further contains citric, malic, and rubichloric acids,\r\ntogether with some tannic acid.\r\n\r\nAnother species of the same genus is the Squinancy Woodruff\r\n(_Asperula cynanchica_), so called from the Greek _cynanche_,\r\nwhich means quinsy, because an excellent gargle may be made from\r\nthis herb for the troublesome throat affection here specified, and for\r\nany severe sore throat. Quinsy is called cynanche, from the Greek\r\nwords, _kuon_, a dog, and _ancho_, to strangle, because the\r\ndistressed patient is compelled by the swollen state of his highly\r\ninflamed throat, to gasp with his mouth open like a choking dog.\r\n\r\n[610] This plant is found growing in dry pastures, especially on a\r\nchalky or limestone soil, but it is not common; it has very narrow\r\nleaves, and tufts of lilac flowers.\r\n\r\nReverting to the Sweet Woodruff, the dried herb may be kept\r\namongst linen, like lavender, to preserve it from insects.\r\n\r\n                    She--\"Fresh Woodruff soaks\r\n    To brew cool drink, and keep away the moth.\"\r\n      --_A. Austin, Poet Laureate_.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly employed for strewing churches, littering chambers,\r\nand stuffing beds. Withering declares that its strongly aromatic\r\nflowers make an infusion which far exceeds even the choice teas of\r\nChina. The powdered leaves are mixed with fancy snuffs, because\r\nof their enduring fragrance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODSORRELL (_See also \"Docks.\"_)\r\n\r\nThis elegant little herb, called also French Sorrel, Rabbits' food,\r\nShamrock, and Wood Sour (_Oxalis acetosella_), is abundant\r\nthroughout our woods, and in other moist, shady places. It belongs\r\nto the natural order of Geraniums, and bears the provincial names of\r\nSour trefoil, Cuckoo's bread, or Gowk's-meat, and Stubwort (from\r\ngrowing about the stubs of hewn trees). Its botanical title is got from\r\nthe Greek word _oxus_, sharp, or acid, because of its penetrating\r\nsour taste. This is due to the acid oxalate of potash which it contains\r\nabundantly, in common with the Dock Sorrel, and the Garden\r\nRhubarb.\r\n\r\nBy reason of this chemical salt being present in combination with\r\nless leafy matter than in the other plants which are akin to it, the\r\nWood Sorrel makes a lighter and more palatable salad.\r\n\r\nIn olden days the Monks named this pretty little [611] woodland\r\nplant _Alleluia_, because it blossoms between Easter and\r\nWhitsuntide, when the Psalms--from the 113th to the 117th,\r\ninclusive--which end with the aspiration, \"Hallelujah!\" were sung.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick is said to have shown on the ternate leaf of the Wood\r\nSorrel to his rude audience the possibility of a Trinity in Unity.\r\n\r\nThe herb has been long popular as a Simple for making a fever\r\ndrink, which is thought to be somewhat sedative to the heart, and for\r\nhelping to cure scurvy. Also, it has proved useful against\r\nintermittent fever.\r\n\r\nTowards assisting to digest, by their free acid, the immature fibre of\r\nyoung flesh meats, the Wood Sorrel leaves are commonly eaten as a\r\ndressing with veal, and lamb. But too habitual use of such a salad or\r\nsauce has led to the formation of gouty crystals (oxalate of lime) in\r\nthe urine, with considerable irritation of the kidneys. Externally, the\r\nbruised leaves are of excellent service for cleansing and stimulating\r\nfoul sores and ulcers, being first macerated in a Cabbage leaf with\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\nThis familiar harbinger of Spring, with its three delicate leaflets on\r\na long stalk, and its tiny white flowers, having purple veins like\r\nthose of the Wood Anemone, bears the fanciful name of Fairy-bells in\r\nWelsh districts.\r\n\r\nFra Angelico placed the claret-stained flowers in the foreground of\r\nhis pictures representing the Crucifixion. After the doctrine of\r\nsignatures, because of its shape like a heart, the leaf of the Wood\r\nSorrel was formerly esteemed as a cordial medicine. It was called in\r\nLatin _Panis Cuculi_, meaning the \"Cuckoo's bread and cheese.\"\r\nThe leaves, when bruised, make with sugar a capital conserve which\r\nis refreshing to a fevered stomach, or, if boiled in milk, they form an\r\nagreeable sub-acid whey. [612] Twenty pounds of the fresh plant\r\nwill yield four ounces of the oxalate of potash, commonly known as\r\nsalt of lemons or salt of sorrel, which is often used for taking ink\r\nstains out of linen. Francus, an old classical author, concluded by\r\nexperiment that the herb is of value (_cordis vires reparare_) to\r\nrecruit the energies of the heart, and (_anginum abigere_) to dispel\r\nthe quinsy. Its infusion makes an excellent anti-putrescent gargle.\r\nThere is also a yellow variety of the Wood Sorrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMWOOD.\r\n\r\nThe common Wormwood (_Artemisia absinthium_) has been partly\r\nconsidered here together with Mugwort, to which it is closely allied.\r\nIt is a Composite herb of frequent growth on waste ground, being a\r\nbushy plant with silky stems, and collections of numerous small\r\nheads of dull yellow flowers. The name Wormwood is from\r\n_wehren_, to keep off--_mought_, a maggot or moth; and\r\n_absinthium_, from-a-negative--_psinthos_, delight, in allusion to\r\nthe very bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is of an aromatic smell and bitter flavour. The\r\nflowers, when dried and powdered, destroy worms more effectually\r\nthan worm seed, whilst the leaves resist putrefaction and help to\r\nmake capital antiseptic fomentations.\r\n\r\nWormwood tea, or the powdered herb in small doses, mixed in a\r\nlittle soup, will serve to relieve bilious melancholia, and will help\r\nto disperse the yellow hue of jaundice from the skin.\r\n\r\nThis herb was formerly thought to possess the power of dispelling\r\ndemons, and was thus associated with the ceremonials of St. John's\r\nEve, owning the name, on the Continent, of St. John's Herb, or St.\r\nJohn's Girdle. Both it, and the Mugwort were dedicated to Diana:\r\n[613] and Venus gave thereof (Ambrose) to AEneas. It bears the\r\nprovincial name \"old woman.\" The smell of common Wormwood is\r\nvery refreshing, and its reviving qualities in heated Courts are\r\nalmost equal to a change of air.\r\n\r\nDioscorides declared it a preventive of intoxication, and a remedy\r\nfor the ill-effects of any such excess; for which reason the _poculum\r\nabsinthiacum_ was a favourite beverage.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"The plant voideth away the worms, not only taken\r\ninwardly, but applied outwardly; it withstandeth all putrefactions,\r\nand is good against the stinking breath.\" It keepeth garments also\r\nfrom the moths--_A tineis tutam reddit qua conditur arcam_\r\n(Macer); and Dr. W. Bulleyne says \"it keepeth clothes from\r\nmoths and wormes.\" This is the great preventive used by cloth\r\nmanufacturers. \"Furthermore,\" adds Gerard, \"taken in wine it is\r\ngood against the biting of the shrew mouse, and of the sea dragon. It\r\nmay be applied against the Squincie, or inflammation of the throat,\r\nwith honey and water: likewise, after the same manner, to dim eyes,\r\nand mattery ears.\"\r\n\r\nThe characteristic odour of the plant is due to a volatile oil which\r\nconsists mainly of absinthol; and the intensely bitter taste resides\r\nin \"absinthin.\"\r\n\r\nThe plant also contains tannin, resin, starch, succinic, malic, and\r\nacetic acids, with nitrate of potash, and other salts. In some\r\ndistricts it is popularly called \"green ginger.\"\r\n\r\nWormwood is of benefit for strengthless flatulent indigestion. An\r\ninfusion may be made of an ounce of the dried plant to a pint of\r\nboiling water, and given in doses of from one to two tablespoonfuls\r\nthree times during the day.\r\n\r\n[614] This infusion with a few drops of the essential oil will prevent\r\nthe hair from falling off.\r\n\r\nAbsinthe, a liqueur concocted from Wormwood, is used largely in\r\nFrance, and the medical verdict pronounced there about its effects\r\nshows that it exercises through the pneumogastric nerve a painful\r\nsensation, which has been taken for that of extreme hunger. This\r\nfeeling goes off quickly if a little alcohol is given, though it is\r\naggravated by coffee, whilst an excessive use of absinthe from day\r\nto day is not slow in producing serious symptoms: the stomach\r\nceases to perform its duty, there is an irritative reaction in the\r\nbrain, and the effects of blind drunkenness come on after each debauch.\r\nThe French Military call absinthe _un perroquet_. The daily taking\r\neven for a short while only of a watery infusion of Wormwood\r\nshows its bad effects by a general languor, with obscurities of the\r\nsight, giddiness, want of appetite, and painful indigestion.\r\n\r\nWhen indulged-in as an appetiser by connoisseurs, absinthe, the\r\n\"fairy with the green eyes,\" is modified by admixture with anisette,\r\nnoted as an \"agreeable and bronchitis-palliating\" liqueur.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his experiments on animals, Dr. Maignan has come to\r\nthe conclusion that absinthe (Wormwood) determines tremblings,\r\ndulness of thought, and epileptiform convulsions,--symptoms which\r\nalcohol alone will not produce. Hence it may be inferred that\r\nabsinthe contains really a narcotic poison which should prevent its\r\nbeing employed as a liqueur, or as a homely medicament, to any\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nDogs are given to eat the Wormwood as a remedy for their ailments.\r\nIts medicinal and curative uses have been already partly discussed,\r\ntogether with those of _Mugwort_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[615] WOUNDWORT.\r\n\r\nThe Hedge Woundwort (_Stachys sylvatica_) is a common Labiate\r\nplant in our hedges and woods, branched and hairy, with whorls of\r\nsmall dull purple flowers on a spike two feet high or more. There\r\nare other varieties of the herb, such as the Marsh (March)\r\nWoundwort, the Corn Woundwort, and the Downy Woundwort.\r\n\r\nThe Hedge Woundwort was named by Gerard, Clown's all heal, or\r\nthe Husbandman's Woundwort, because a countryman who had cut\r\nhis hand to the bone with a scythe, healed the wound in seven days\r\nwith this plant.\r\n\r\nIt is called by some the Hedge Dead Nettle, from its nettle-like\r\nleaves, and the place of its growth.\r\n\r\n\"The leaves,\" says Gerard, \"stampt (pounded) with hog's grease, and\r\napplied unto green wounds in the manner of a poultice, heal them in\r\nsuch short time and such absolute manner, that it is hard for anyone\r\nthat hath not had the experience thereof to believe. For instance, a\r\ndeep and grievous wound in the breast with a dagger, and two others\r\nin the abdomen (or nether belly), so that the fat commonly named\r\nthe caul, issued forth, the which mortal wounds, by God's\r\npermission, and the virtues of this herb, I perfectly cured within\r\ntwenty days--for the which the name of God be praised.\"\r\n\r\nThe name _Stachys_ given to this herb, is from the Greek _stakos_,\r\na bunch, because of the arrangement of the flowers. It contains a\r\nvolatile oil, and a bitter principle undetermined.\r\n\r\nThe _Stachys Germanica_ (Downy Woundwort) is so called from\r\nits soft, downy leaves having been employed instead of lint as a\r\nsurgical dressing to wounds. The plant grows on a chalky soil in\r\nBedfordshire, [616] Berkshire, and Oxfordshire: being named also\r\n\"Lamb's Ear.\"\r\n\r\nThis _Stachys lanata_ (Woolly Woundwort) is known as Saviour's\r\nblanket, in Sussex; also in Devonshire and Somersetshire, as\r\nMouse's ear, Donkey's ear, and Lamb's tongue.\r\n\r\nThe Knights' Water Woundwort (_Statiotes aloides_) was supposed\r\nfrom its blade-like leaves, acting on the doctrine of signatures,\r\nto heal sword wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYARROW.\r\n\r\nThe Yarrow, from _hiera_, holy herb (_Achillea millefolium_), or\r\nMilfoil, is so called from the very numerous fine segments of its\r\nleaves. It is a Composite plant very common on waysides and in\r\npastures throughout Britain.\r\n\r\nThe name _Achillea_ has been bestowed thereupon because the\r\nGreek warrior, Achilles, is said to have disclosed its virtues which\r\nhe had been taught by Chiron, the Centaur. This herb is the\r\n_Stratiotes chiliophullos _of the Greek botanists, by whom it was\r\nvalued as an excellent astringent and vulnerary. But Gerard\r\nsupposes it may have been the _Achillea millefolium nobile_, which\r\ngrows with a thick root and longer leaves, on a fat and fruitful soil,\r\na stranger in England, \"and the very same with which Achilles cured\r\nthe wounds of his soldiers.\" But, he adds, \"the virtues of each sort\r\nof Milfoil are set to be both alike.\"\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the Common Yarrow or Nosebleed are white or\r\npink; those of the _Nobile_ are yellow.\r\n\r\nThe popular name of Nosebleed has been given to the Yarrow\r\nbecause the hairy filaments of the leaves, when put up the nose,\r\nprovoke an exudation of blood, and will thus afford relief to\r\nheadache, caused by a passive fulness of the vessels. Parkinson says\r\n\"if it be [617] pat into the nose, assuredly it will stay the bleeding\r\nof it,\" which mast be the' effect of action according to similars. Or\r\nif using Yarrow in the same way as a love charm, the following lines\r\nwere repeated:--\r\n\r\n    \"Green arrow! green arrow!\r\n        You bear a white blow;\r\n    If my love love me\r\n        My nose will bleed now.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaves have a somewhat fragrant smell, and a bitterish taste.\r\nThe odour of the flowers, when rubbed between the fingers, is\r\naromatic. In consequence of this pungent, volatile principle, the herb\r\nhas proved useful in hysteria, flatulence, heartburn, colic, and\r\nepilepsy; also, it is employed in Norway for the cure of rheumatism,\r\nand sometimes chewed for toothache.\r\n\r\nYarrow is one of the few aboriginal English plants, having held the\r\nprimitive title, _Gearwe_. Greek botanists seem to have known the\r\nidentical species which we now possess, and to have used it against\r\nhaemorrhagic losses. It yields, chemically, a dark-green volatile oil,\r\nand achilleic acid, which is said to be identical with aconitic acid;\r\nalso resin, tannin, gum; and earthy ash consisting of nitrates,\r\nphosphates, and chlorides of potash and lime.\r\n\r\nFor preparing an infusion of the plant, half an ounce should be\r\nboiled down in half a pint of water to six ounces; one tablespoonful\r\nfor a dose.\r\n\r\nSir John Hill says the best way of giving Yarrow is in a strong\r\ndecoction of the whole plant. A hot infusion of the herb taken freely\r\non going to bed at night seldom fails to make short work of a cold.\r\n\r\nA medicinal tincture (H.) is prepared from the whole plant with\r\nspirit of wine. This, when employed in a diluted form of the first or\r\nthird decimal strength, and [618] in small doses of from five to ten\r\ndrops in a tablespoonful of cold water, will act admirably in\r\narresting nocturnal losses in the male; likewise bleeding from the\r\nlungs, the kidneys, or the nose, especially in florid, hectic subjects.\r\nIt has been found by healthy provers that stronger, and larger doses\r\nof any preparation of the herb will induce or aggravate one or\r\nanother of these bleedings.\r\n\r\nThe fresh juice of the plant may be had, a dessert-spoonful three\r\ntimes in the day; or of the volatile essential oil, from three to five\r\ndrops for a dose. These medicines greatly stimulate and promote the\r\nappetite. \"For ague,\" says Parkinson, \"drink a decoction of the herb\r\nwarm before the fit, and so for two or three fits together.\"\r\n\r\nExternally, a strong decoction of the leaves has been used as an\r\ninjection into the nostrils to stay bleeding from the nose. It is\r\nsimilarly of service for piles, and for female floodings, because\r\nexerting a special local action on the organs within the middle trunk.\r\nThe bruised herb, or an ointment made from it, is applied by rustics\r\nto heal fresh cuts and contusions.\r\n\r\nEven in ancient times it was famous as a topical remedy for piles. It\r\nis further of benefit for sore nipples as a lotion, and for a relaxed\r\nsore throat as a gargle: also as a hair wash.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were applied in former days as a poultice to wounds; and\r\nbecause of its healing and astringent virtues when so used, the plant\r\ngained the names Sanguinary, Thousand leaf, Old Man's pepper,\r\nSoldiers' Woundwort. Other local names for it are Staunch grass,\r\nCarpenters' weed, and Bloodwort: also, \"Old Man's Mustard,\" \"Bad\r\nMan's Plaything,\" and \"Devil's Plaything.\" In Gloucestershire and\r\nsome other parts, the double-flowered Yarrow is brought to a\r\nwedding by [619] bridesmaids as \"seven years' love.\" In Cheshire,\r\nchildren draw the herb across the face to produce a tingling\r\nsensation, and they call it \"Devil's nettle.\"\r\n\r\nCulpeper spoke of the same as a profitable herb in cramps, and\r\ntherefore called _Militaris_.\r\n\r\nYarrow, worn in a little bag over the stomach, was the secret\r\n(confided to Boyle) of a great lord against ague. A famous physician\r\nhad used it with strange efficacy.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a charmed packet containing dried Yarrow has been\r\ncredited with bringing success to its bearer, if at the same time he\r\nwere admitted to the knowledge of a traditional secret (only\r\nwhispered to the initiated) that this was the first herb our Saviour\r\nhad put into His hand when a child.\r\n\r\nAgain, Elspeth Reoch, in 1616, when tried for witchcraft,\r\nacknowledged to having employed the Yarrow in her incantations.\r\nShe \"plucked one herbe called Meleflower, sitting on her right knee,\r\nand pulling it betwixt the mid-finger and thumbe, and saying: _In\r\nnominee Patris, Filii, et Spiritus Sancti_.\" The Meleflower is the\r\n_Achilloea Ptarmica_ or Sneezewort.\r\n\r\nBy the plant so gathered, she was enabled to cure distempers, and to\r\nimpart the faculty of prediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYEW.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Yew--a Conifer--which is so thoroughly English a\r\ntree, is known to be highly poisonous as regards its leaves to the\r\nhumans subject, and as concerning its loppings or half-dead\r\nbranches, to oxen, horses, and asses, yet a medicinal tincture (H.) is\r\nmade from the young shoots, which has distinct and curative uses.\r\nBoth the Yew and the Ivy were called _abiga_, because [620]\r\ncausing abortion. From which word when corrupted was formed\r\n_iua_; and under this latter name, says Dr. Prior, the Ivy and the\r\nYew became inextricably mixed up.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the red berries, or their coloured fleshy cups, are not\r\npoisonous when taken in moderation, but rejecting the seeds.\r\n\r\nGerard says: \"When I was yong, and went to schoole, divers of my\r\nschool-fellows and likewise myself, did eat our fils of the berries of\r\nthis tree, and have not only slept under the shadow thereof, but\r\namong the branches also, without any hurt at all, and that not one\r\ntime, but many times.\"\r\n\r\nYet Leo Grindon says, much more recently: \"Though the juice and\r\npulp of the sweet and viscid berries are not harmful, still the _seeds_\r\nof the Yew, and the _leaves_ are deadly poison.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Herbal_ of 1578, Lyte tells us the Yew is altogether\r\nvenomous, and against man's nature. \"Such as do but only sleep\r\nunder the shadow thereof become sick, and sometimes they die;\"\r\nand, \"the extract of yew is used by ignorant apothecaries to the great\r\nperil and danger of the poor diseased people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yew tree (_Taxus baccata_) occurs in mountainous woods and\r\nrocky glens about Britain, but is rare as of native growth. Its name,\r\nTaxus, is a corruption of toxos, an arrow, since arrows in the old\r\ntime were poisoned with the juice of yew.\r\n\r\nThe tree was planted frequently by our forefathers in churchyards,\r\nbecause of its value in the manufacture of bows. It is exceedingly\r\nlong lived, and often attains great magnitude of girth.\r\n\r\nA ghastly superstition was attached to the Yew when thus growing\r\nin a churchyard, that it would prey upon [621] the dead bodies lying\r\nbeneath its sombre shade. So Tennyson writes (_In Memoriam_):--\r\n\r\n    \"Old Yew! which graspest at the stones\r\n      That name the underlying dead,\r\n    Thy fibres net the dreamless head,\r\n      Thy roots are wrapped about the bones.\"\r\n\r\nThe juice of the tree and of its leaves is a rapidly fatal poison,\r\nthe symptoms corresponding in a very remarkable way with those\r\nwhich follow the bites of venomous snakes.\r\n\r\nNo known poison but the Yew produces the lazar-like ulcerations\r\nupon the body, on which Marlowe lays such stress--(Jew of\r\nMalta):--\r\n\r\n    \"In few, the blood of Hydra--Herne's bane,\r\n    The juice of _Hebron_, and Cocytus' breath,\r\n    And all the poisons of the Stygian pool.\"\r\n\r\nThe witches in _Macbeth_ include it in their accursed brew:--\r\n\r\n    \"Liver of blaspheming Jew,\r\n    Gall of goat, and _Slips of Yew_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yew tree is called \"Hebon\" by Spencer, and \"Jew of Malta\" by\r\nother writers of Shakespeare's time. The leaves are bitter, nauseous,\r\nand acrid. The succulent covering of the fruit is soft and slimy,\r\nmawkishly sweet, and mucilaginous. The leaves have a dangerous\r\neffect on the circulation of the heart, and when taken with any\r\nfreedom are as fatal as the Foxglove.\r\n\r\nBefore the new Shakespeare Society, 1882, it was contended and\r\nproved to the satisfaction of the Society, that \"the cursed Hebena,\"\r\nthe \"leperous distilment poured into the chambers of mine ears,\"\r\ntold of, so pathetically, by the sad ghost of Hamlet's father, was the\r\n[622] poison of the Yew, and identical with Marlow[e]'s juice of\r\nHebron.\r\n\r\nRay mentions that a gardener employed in clipping a Yew tree at\r\nPisa, could not proceed with his work for more than half-an-hour at\r\na time without being seized with a violent pain in the head.\r\nNevertheless, deer, sheep, and goats can eat the foliage with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nThe fresh leaves were administered to three children near\r\nManchester for worms. Yawning and listlessness came on, and the\r\neldest vomited a little, but neither of them complained of any pain.\r\nThey all died within a few hours of each other.\r\n\r\nBecause being then green, on the Sunday next before Easter, the\r\nbranches of the Yew tree have been used as a substitute for the\r\nPalms which symbolise the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms induced by provings of the leaves and juice in toxic\r\nquantities, have been sick headache, with giddiness, feeble, faltering\r\npulse, coldness of the extremities, diarrhoea, and general\r\nprostration. So that for this combination of symptoms, as in severe\r\nbiliousness, or as in the auditory vertigo of Meniere's disease, small\r\ndoses of the diluted tincture are found to give prompt and effectual\r\nrelief. The leaves contain a volatile oil, tannin, and a bitter\r\nprinciple \"taxina,\" which is also furnished by the seeds. An extract\r\nof Yew has been pronounced a useful narcotic by more than one physician\r\nof repute: and in some parts of Germany a decoction of the wood is\r\na well-known remedy against hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nA jelly prepared from the berries has been given for chronic\r\nbronchitis, and the leaves have been used for epilepsy; likewise they\r\nhave been taken by ignorant persons to induce abortion, but with\r\nserious injury to the experimenter. In some rural districts the berries\r\n[623] are known as \"Snots\"; whilst the wood and roots are \"Wire\r\nthorn.\"\r\n\r\nBy an old statute of Edward the First, trees were required to be\r\nplaced in churchyards to defend the church from high winds, the\r\nclergy being allowed to cut them down for repairing the chancel\r\nwhen necessary. Perhaps, partly for this reason, the Yew was\r\ncommonly planted by the side of a newly-built church. That its\r\nwood was certainly employed for making bows, we learn from\r\nShakespeare:--\r\n\r\n    \"Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\r\n    Of double-fatal Yew against thy state.\"\r\n\r\nIt was \"double-fatal,\" because the leaves and fruit seeds are\r\npoisonous, and the bows made from its branches, as well as arrows\r\narmed with its deadly juice, were instruments of death.\r\n\r\nAgainst the maladies which have been specified as indicating the\r\ntincture of Yew for their cure, from five to ten drops of the third\r\ndecimal tincture should be given, with a spoonful of water, every\r\ntwo, three, or four hours, whilst required. In Switzerland the Yew is\r\nknown as William's tree, in memory of Tell. Formerly the name was\r\nspelt \"Eugh,\" \"Yeugh,\" and \"Ewgh.\"\r\n\r\nSpenser says:--\r\n\r\n    \"The Eugh--obedient to the bender's will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn olden times the Olitory, or Herb-garden, formed an important\r\nannex to all demesnes having any pretensions to completeness, and\r\nwas under \"My Lady's\" [624] special charge. In fact, the culture and\r\npreparing of Simples formed a part of every lady's education. \"My\r\nLord's\" retainers and tenants, when out of sorts, were treated with\r\nthese wholesome remedies, and were directed to find in Simples the\r\ncure for all ordinary ailments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood George Herbert, of Country Parson celebrity, taught, 1620:--\r\n\"In the knowledge of Simples, wherein the manifold wisdom of God\r\nis wonderfully to be seen, one thing should be carefully observed,\r\nwhich is, to know what herbs may be used instead of drugs of the\r\nsame nature, and to make the garden the shop; for, home-bred\r\nmedicines are both more easy for the Parson's purse, and more\r\nfamiliar for all men's bodies. So where the Apothecary useth either\r\nfor loosing, Rhubarb, or for binding, Bole Armena; the Parson useth\r\nDamask, or White Roses for the one, and Plantain, Shepherd's\r\nPurse, or Knotgrass for the other: and that with better success. As\r\nfor Spices, he doth not only prefer home-bred things before them,\r\nbut condemns them for vanities, and so shuts them out of his family,\r\nesteeming that there is no spice comparable of herbs to Rosemary,\r\nThyme, Savory, Mints: and of seeds to Fennel and Carraway.\r\nAccordingly for salves his wife seeks not the city, but prefers her\r\ngarden and fields, before all outlandish gums. And, surely, Hyssop,\r\nValerian, Mercury, Adder's tongue, Yarrow, Melilot, and St. John's\r\nWort, made into a salve, and Elder, Camomile, Mallows, Comphrey,\r\nand Smallage, made into a poultice have done great, and rare cures!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[625] INDEX.\r\n\r\nAGE, Old, to Promote.\r\nAgrimony, Hemp  . . . 19\r\nApples . . . 27-31\r\nChamomile . . . 86\r\nChervil . . . 101\r\nCider . . .
