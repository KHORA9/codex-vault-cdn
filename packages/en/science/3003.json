Inasmuch as science has proved that almost every\r\nblossom in the world is everything it is because of its necessity\r\nto attract insect friends or to repel its foes - its form,\r\nmechanism, color, markings, odor, time of opening and closing,\r\nand its season of blooming being the result of natural selection\r\nby that special insect upon which each depends more or less\r\nabsolutely for help in perpetuating its species - it seems fully\r\ntime that the vitally important and interesting relationship\r\nexisting between our common wild flowers and their winged\r\nbenefactors should be presented in a popular book.\r\n\r\nIs it enough to know merely the name of the flower you meet in\r\nthe meadow? The blossom has an inner meaning, hopes and fears\r\nthat inspire its brief existence, a scheme of salvation for its\r\nspecies in the struggle for survival that it has been slowly\r\nperfecting with some insect's help through the ages. It is not a\r\npassive thing to be admired by human eyes, nor does it waste its\r\nsweetness on the desert air. It is a sentient being, impelled to\r\nact intelligently through the same strong desires that animate\r\nus, and endowed with certain powers differing only in degree, but\r\nnot in kind, from those of the animal creation. Desire ever\r\ncreates form.\r\n\r\nDo you doubt it? Then study the mechanism of one of our common\r\norchids or milkweeds that are adjusted with such marvelous\r\ndelicacy to the length of a bee's tongue or of a butterfly's leg;\r\nlearn why so many flowers have sticky calices or protective\r\nhairs; why the skunk cabbage, purple trillium, and carrion flower\r\nemit a fetid odor while other flowers, especially the white or\r\npale yellow night bloomers, charm with their delicious breath;\r\nsee if you cannot discover why the immigrant daisy already\r\nwhitens our fields with descendants as numerous as the sands of\r\nthe seashore, whereas you may tramp a whole day without finding a\r\nsingle native ladies' slipper. What of the sundew that not only\r\ncatches insects, but secretes gastric juice to digest them? What\r\nof the bladderwort, in whose inflated traps tiny crustaceans are\r\nimprisoned, or the pitcher plant, that makes soup of its guests?\r\nWhy are gnats and flies seen about certain flowers, bees,\r\nbutterflies, moths or humming birds about others, each visitor\r\nchoosing the restaurant most to his liking? With what infinite\r\npains the wants of each guest are catered to! How relentlessly\r\nare pilferers punished! The endless devices of the more ambitious\r\nflowers to save their species from degeneracy by close inbreeding\r\nthrough fertilization with their own pollen, alone prove the\r\noperation of Mind through them. How plants travel, how they send\r\nseeds abroad in the world to found new colonies, might be studied\r\nwith profit by Anglo-Saxon expansionists. Do vice and virtue\r\nexist side by side in the vegetable world also? Yes, and every\r\nsinner is branded as surely as was Cain. The dodder, Indian pipe,\r\nbroomrape and beech-drops wear the floral equivalent of the\r\nstriped suit and the shaved head. Although claiming most\r\nrespectable and exalted kinsfolk, they are degenerates not far\r\nabove the fungi. In short, this is a universe that we live in;\r\nand all that share the One Life are one in essence, for natural\r\nlaw is spiritual law. \"Through Nature to God,\" flowers show a way\r\nto the scientist lacking faith.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been stated by evolutionists for many years that\r\nin order to know the flowers, their insect relationships must\r\nfirst be understood, it is believed that \"Nature's Garden\" is the\r\nfirst American work to explain them in any considerable number of\r\nspecies. Dr. Asa Gray, William Hamilton Gibson, Clarence Moores\r\nWeed, and Miss Maud Going in their delightful books or lectures\r\nhave shown the interdependence of a score or more of different\r\nblossoms and their insect visitors. Hidden away in the\r\nproceedings of scientific societies' technical papers are the\r\ninvaluable observations of such men as Dr. William Trelease of\r\nWisconsin and Professor Charles Robertson of Illinois. To the\r\nlatter especially, I am glad to acknowledge my indebtedness.\r\nSprengel, Darwin, Muller, Delpino, and Lubbock, among others,\r\nhave given the world classical volumes on European flora only,\r\nbut showing a vast array of facts which the theory of adaptation\r\nto insects alone correlates and explains. That the results of\r\nillumining researches should be so slow in enlightening the\r\npopular mind can be due only to the technical, scientific\r\nlanguage used in setting them forth, language as foreign to the\r\naverage reader as Chinese, and not to be deciphered by the\r\naverage student either, without the help of a glossary. These\r\nwritings, as well as the vast array of popular books - too many\r\nfor individual mention - have been freely consulted after studies\r\nmade afield.\r\n\r\nTo Sprengel belongs the glory of first exalting flowers above the\r\nlevel of botanical specimens. After studying the wild geranium he\r\nbecame convinced, as he wrote in 1787, that \"the wise Author of\r\nNature has not made even a single hair without a definite design.\r\nA hundred years before, one, Nehemias Grew, had said that it was\r\nnecessary for pollen to reach the stigma of a flower in order\r\nthat it might set fertile seed, and Linnaeus bad to come to his\r\nrescue with conclusive evidence to convince a doubting world that\r\nhe was right. Sprengel made the next step forward, but his\r\nwritings lay neglected over seventy years because he advanced the\r\nthen incredible and only partially true statement that a flower\r\nis fertilized by insects which carry its pollen from its anthers\r\nto its stigma. In spite of his discoveries that the hairs within\r\nthe wild geranium protect its nectar from rain for the insect\r\nbenefactor's benefit; that most flowers which secrete nectar have\r\nwhat he termed \"honey guides\" - spots of bright color, heavy\r\nveining, or some such pathfinder for the visitor on the petals;\r\nthat sometimes the male flowers, the staminate ones, are\r\nseparated from the seed-bearing or pistillate ones on distinct\r\nplants, he left it to Darwin to show that cross-fertilization by\r\ninsects, the transfer of pollen from one blossom to another - not\r\nfrom anthers to stigma of the same flower - is the great end to\r\nwhich so much marvelous floral mechanism is adapted. The wind is\r\na wasteful, uncertain pollen distributor. Insects transfer it\r\nmore economically, especially the more highly organized and\r\nindustrious ones. In a few instances hummingbirds, as well,\r\nunwittingly do the flower's bidding while they feast now here,\r\nnow there. In spite of Sprengel's most patient and scientific\r\nresearch, that shed great light on the theory of natural\r\nselection a half century before Darwin advanced it, he never knew\r\nthat flowers are nearly always sterile to pollen of another\r\nspecies when carried to them on the bodies of insect visitors, or\r\nthat cross-pollenized blossoms defeat the self-pollinated ones in\r\nthe struggle for survival. These facts Darwin proved in endless\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nBecause bees depend absolutely upon flowers, not only for their\r\nown food but for that of future generations for whom they labor;\r\nbecause they are the most diligent of all visitors, and are\r\nrarely diverted from one species of flower to another while on\r\ntheir rounds collecting, as they must, both nectar and pollen, it\r\nfollows they are the most important fertilizing agents. It is\r\nestimated that, should they perish, more than half the flowers in\r\nthe world would be exterminated with them! Australian farmers\r\nimported clover from Europe, and although they had luxuriant\r\nfields of it, no seed was set for next year's planting, because\r\nthey had failed to import the bumblebee. After his arrival, their\r\nloss was speedily made good.\r\n\r\nAges before men cultivated gardens, they had tiny helpers they\r\nknew not of. Gardeners win all the glory of producing a Lawson\r\npink or a new chrysanthemum; but only for a few seasons do they\r\nselect, hybridize, according to their own rules of taste. They\r\ntake up the work where insects left it off after countless\r\ncenturies of toil. Thus it is to the night-flying moth, long of\r\ntongue, keen of scent, that we are indebted for the deep, white,\r\nfragrant Easter lily, for example, and not to the florist; albeit\r\nthe moth is in his turn indebted to the lily for the length of\r\nhis tongue and his keen nerves: neither could have advanced\r\nwithout the other. What long vistas through the ages of creation\r\ndoes not this interdependence of flowers and insects open!\r\n\r\nOver five hundred flowers in this book have been classified\r\naccording to color, because it is believed that the novice, with\r\nno knowledge of botany whatever, can most readily identify the\r\nspecimen found afield by this method, which has the added\r\nadvantage of being the simple one adopted by the higher insects\r\nages before books were written. Technicalities have been avoided\r\nin the text wherever possible, not to discourage the beginner\r\nfrom entering upon one of the most enjoyable and elevating\r\nbranches of Nature study. The scientific names and classification\r\nfollow that method adopted by the International Botanical\r\nCongress which has now superseded all others; nevertheless the\r\ntitles employed by Gray, with which older botanists in this\r\ncountry are familiar, are also indicated where they differ from\r\nthe new nomenclature.\r\n\r\nNELTJE BLANCHAN, New York, March, 1900\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\nPreface\r\nList of Illustrations\r\nBlue to Purple Flowers\r\nMagenta to Pink Flowers\r\nWhite and Greenish Flowers\r\nYellow and Orange Flowers\r\nRed and Indefinites\r\nAppendices:\r\n   Fragrant Flowers or Leaves\r\n   Unpleasantly Scented\r\n   Plants and Shrubs Conspicuous in Fruit\r\n   Plant Families Represented\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Let us content ourselves no longer with being mere 'botanists' -\r\nhistorians of structural facts. The flowers are not mere comely\r\nor curious vegetable creations, with colors, odors, petals,\r\nstamens and innumerable technical attributes. The wonted insight\r\nalike of scientist, philosopher, theologian, and dreamer is now\r\nrepudiated in the new revelation. Beauty is not 'its own excuse\r\nfor being,' nor was fragrance ever 'wasted on the desert air.'\r\nThe seer has at last heard and interpreted the voice in the\r\nwilderness. The flower is no longer a simple passive victim in\r\nthe busy bee's sweet pillage, but rather a conscious being, with\r\nhopes, aspirations and companionships. The insect is its\r\ncounterpart. Its fragrance is but a perfumed whisper of welcome,\r\nits color is as the wooing blush and rosy lip, its portals are\r\ndecked for his coming, and its sweet hospitalities humored to his\r\ntarrying; and as it speeds its parting affinity, rests content\r\nthat its life's consummation has been fulfilled.\" - William\r\nHamilton Gibson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I often think, when working over my plants, of what Linnaeus\r\nonce said of the unfolding of a blossom: 'I saw God in His glory\r\npassing near me, and bowed my head in worship.' The scientific\r\naspect of the same thought has been put into words by Tennyson:\r\n\r\n    'Flower in the crannied wall\r\n     I pluck you out of the crannies,\r\n     I hold you here, root and all in my hand\r\n     Little flower, - but if I could understand\r\n     What you are, root and all, and all in all,\r\n     I should know what God and man is.'\r\n\r\nNo deeper thought was ever uttered by poet. For in this world of\r\nplants, which, with its magician, chlorophyll, conjuring with\r\nsunbeams, is ceaselessly at work bringing life out of death, - in\r\nthis quiet vegetable world we may find the elementary principles\r\nof all life in almost visible operation.\" - JOHN FISKE in\r\n\"Through Nature to God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM BLUE TO PURPLE FLOWERS\r\n\r\n\"If blue is the favorite color of bees, and if bees have so much\r\nto do with the origin of flowers, how is it that there are so few\r\nblue ones? I believe the explanation to be that all blue flowers\r\nhave descended from ancestors in which the flowers were green;\r\nor, to speak more precisely, in which the leaves surrounding the\r\nstamens and pistil were green; and that they have passed through\r\nstages of white or yellow, and generally red, before becoming\r\nblue.\" - Sir John Lubbock in \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA or COMMON DAY-FLOWER\r\n  (Commelina Virginica)  Spiderwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue, 1 in. broad or less, irregular, grouped at end of\r\nstem, and upheld by long leaf-like bracts. Calyx of 3 unequal\r\nsepals; 3 petals, 1 inconspicuous, 2 showy, rounded. Perfect\r\nstamens 3; the anther of 1 incurved stamen largest; 3\r\ninsignificant and sterile stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: Fleshy,\r\nsmooth, branched, mucilaginous. Leaves: Lance-shaped, 3 to 5 in.\r\nlong, sheathing the stem at base; upper leaves in a spathe-like\r\nbract folding like a hood about flowers. Fruit: A 3-celled\r\ncapsule, seed in each cell.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, shady ground.\r\nFlowering Season - June - September.\r\nDistribution - Southern New York to Illinois and Michigan,\r\nNebraska, Texas, and through tropical America to Paraguay. -\r\nBritton and Browne.\r\n\r\nDelightful Linnaeus, who dearly loved his little joke, himself\r\nconfesses to have named the day-flowers after three brothers\r\nCommelyn, Dutch botanists, because two of them - commemorated in\r\nthe two showy blue petals of the blossom - published their works;\r\nthe third, lacking application and ambition, amounted to nothing,\r\nlike the inconspicuous whitish third petal! Happily Kaspar\r\nCommelyn died in 1731, before the joke was perpetrated in\r\n\"Species Plantarum.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning we find the day-flower open and alert-looking,\r\nowing to the sharp, erect bracts that give it support; after\r\nnoon, or as soon as it has been fertilized by the female bees,\r\nthat are its chief benefactors while collecting its abundant\r\npollen, the lovely petals roll up, never to open again, and\r\nquickly wilt into a wet, shapeless mass, which, if we touch it,\r\nleaves a sticky blue fluid on our finger-tips.\r\n\r\nThe SLENDER DAY-FLOWER (C. erecta), the next of kin, a more\r\nfragile-looking, smaller-flowered, and narrower-leafed species,\r\nblooms from August to October, from Pennsylvania southward to\r\ntropical America and westward to Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIDERWORT; WIDOW'S or JOB'S TEARS\r\n  (Tradescantia Virginiana)  Spiderwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish blue, rarely white, showy, ephemeral, 1 to 2\r\nin. broad; usually several flowers, but more drooping buds,\r\nclustered and seated between long blade-like bracts at end of\r\nstern. Calyx of 3 sepals, much longer than capsule. Corolla of 3\r\nregular petals; 6 fertile stamens, bearded; anthers orange; 1\r\npistil. Stem: 8 in. to 3 ft. tall, fleshy, erect, mucilaginous,\r\nleafy. Leaves: Opposite, long, blade-like, keeled, clasping, or\r\nsheathing stem at base. Fruit: 3-celled capsule.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods, thickets, gardens.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - New York and Virginia westward to South Dakota and\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\nAs so very many of our blue flowers are merely naturalized\r\nimmigrants from Europe, it is well to know we have sent to\r\nEngland at least one native that was considered fit to adorn the\r\ngrounds of Hampton Court. John Tradescant, gardener to Charles I,\r\nfor whom the plant and its kin were named, had seeds sent him by\r\na relative in the Virginia colony; and before long the deep azure\r\nblossoms with their golden anthers were seen in gardens on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic - another one of the many instances where\r\nthe possibilities of our wild flowers under cultivation had to be\r\nfirst pointed out to us by Europeans.\r\n\r\nLike its relative the dayflower, the spiderwort opens for part of\r\na day only. In the morning it is wide awake and pert; early in\r\nthe afternoon its petals have begun to retreat within the calyx,\r\nuntil presently they become \"dissolved in tears,\" like Job or the\r\ntraditional widow. What was flower only a few hours ago is now a\r\nfluid jelly that trickles at the touch. Tomorrow fresh buds will\r\nopen, and a continuous succession of bloom may be relied upon for\r\na long season. Since its stigma is widely separated from the\r\nanthers and surpasses them, it is probable the flower cannot\r\nfertilize itself, but is wholly dependent on the female bees and\r\nother insects that come to it for pollen. Note the hairs on the\r\nstamens provided as footholds for the bees.\r\n\r\nThe plant is a cousin of the \"Wandering Jew\" (T. repens), so\r\ncommonly grown either in water or earth in American\r\nsitting-rooms. In a shady lane within New York city limits, where\r\na few stems were thrown out one spring about five years ago, the\r\nentire bank is now covered with the vine, that has rooted by its\r\nhairy joints, and, in spite of frosts and blizzards, continues to\r\nbear its true-blue flowers throughout the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKEREL WEED\r\n  (Pontederia cordata)  Pickerel-weed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright purplish blue, including filaments, anthers, and\r\nstyle; crowded in a dense spike; quickly fading; unpleasantly\r\nodorous. Perianth tubular, 2-lipped, parted into 6 irregular\r\nlobes, free from ovary; middle lobe of upper lip with 2 yellow\r\nspots at base within. Stamens 6, placed at unequal distances on\r\ntube, 3 opposite each lip. Pistil 1, the stigma minutely toothed.\r\nStem: Erect, stout, fleshy, to 4 ft. tall, not often over 2 ft.\r\nabove water line. Leaves: Several bract-like, sheathing stem at\r\nbase; leaf only, midway on flower-stalk, thick, polished,\r\ntriangular, or arrow-shaped, 4 to 8 in. long, 2 to 6 in. across\r\nbase.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Shallow water of ponds and streams.\r\nFlowering Season - June-October.\r\nDistribution - Eastern half of United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nGrace of habit and the bright beauty of its long blue spikes of\r\nragged flowers above rich, glossy leaves give a charm to this\r\nvigorous wader. Backwoodsmen will tell you that pickerels lay\r\ntheir eggs among the leaves; but so they do among the sedges,\r\narums, wild rice, and various aquatic plants, like many another\r\nfish. Bees and flies, that congregate about the blossoms to feed,\r\nmay sometimes fly too low, and so give a plausible reason for the\r\npickerel's choice of haunt. Each blossom lasts but a single day;\r\nthe upper portion, withering, leaves the base of the perianth to\r\nharden about the ovary and protect the solitary seed. But as the\r\ngradually lengthened spike keeps up an uninterrupted succession\r\nof bloom for months, more than ample provision is made for the\r\nperpetuation of the race - a necessity to any plant that refuses\r\nto thrive unless it stands in water. Ponds and streams have an\r\nunpleasant habit of drying up in summer, and often the pickerel\r\nweed looks as brown as a bulrush where it is stranded in the\r\nbaked mud in August. When seed falls on such ground, if indeed it\r\ngerminates at all, the young plant naturally withers away.\r\n\r\nIn the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, Mr. W. H. Leggett,\r\nwho made a careful study of the flower, tells that three forms\r\noccur, not on the same, but on different plants, being even more\r\ndistinctly trimorphic than the purple Loosestrife. As these\r\nflowers set no seed without insects' aid, the provisions made to\r\nsecure the greatest benefit from their visits are marvelous. Of\r\nthe three kinds of blossoms, one raises its stigma on a long\r\nstyle reaching to the top of the flower; a second form lifts its\r\nstigma only halfway up, and the third keeps its stigma in the\r\nbottom of the tube. Now, there are two sets of stamens, three in\r\neach set bearing pollen grains of different size and value.\r\nWhenever the stigma is high, the two sets of stamens keep out of\r\nits way by occupying the lowest and middle positions, or just\r\nwhere the stigmas occur in the two other forms; or, let us say,\r\nwhenever the stigma is in one of the three positions, the\r\ndifferent sets of stamens occupy the other two. In a long series\r\nof experiments on flowers occurring in two and three forms -\r\ndimorphic and trimorphic - Darwin proved that perfect fertility\r\ncan be obtained only when the stigma in each form is pollenized\r\nwith grains carried from the stamens of a corresponding height.\r\nFor example, a bee on entering the flower must get his abdomen\r\ndusted with pollen from the long stamens, his chest covered from\r\nthe middle-length stamens, and his tongue and chin from the set\r\nin the bottom of the tube nearest the nectary. When he flies off\r\nto visit another flower, these parts of his body coming in\r\ncontact with the stigmas that occupy precisely the position where\r\nthe stamens were in other individuals, he necessarily brushes off\r\neach lot of pollen just where it will do the most good. Pollen\r\nbrought from high stamens, for example, to a low stigma, even\r\nshould it reach it, which is scarcely likely, takes little or no\r\neffect. Thus cross-fertilization is absolutely essential, and in\r\nthree-formed flowers there are two chances to one of securing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD HYACINTH, SCILLA or SQUILL. QUAMASH\r\n  (Quamasia kyacinthina; Scilla Fraseri of Gray) Lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Several or many, pale violet blue, or rarely white, in\r\na long, loose raceme; perianth of 6 equal, narrowly oblong,\r\nwidely spreading divisions, the thread-like filaments inserted at\r\ntheir bases; style thread-like, with 3-lobed stigma. Scape: 1 to\r\n2 ft. high, from egg-shaped, nearly black bulb, 1 to 1 1/2 in.\r\nlong. Leaves: Grass-like, shorter than flowering scape, from the\r\nbase. Fruit: A 3-angled, oval capsule containing shining black\r\nseeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Meadows, prairies, and along banks of\r\nstreams.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania and Ohio westward to Minnesota, south\r\nto Alabama and Texas.\r\n\r\nComing with the crocuses, before the snow is off the ground, and\r\nremaining long after their regal gold and purple chalices have\r\nwithered, the Siberian scillas sold by seedsmen here deserve a\r\nplace in every garden, for their porcelain-blue color is rare as\r\nit is charming; the early date when they bloom makes them\r\nespecially welcome; and, once planted and left undisturbed, the\r\nbulbs increase rapidly, without injury from overcrowding.\r\nEvidently they need little encouragement to run wild.\r\nNevertheless they are not wild scillas, however commonly they may\r\nbe miscalled so. Certainly ladies' tresses, known as wild\r\nhyacinth in parts of New England, has even less right to the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nOur true native wild hyacinth, or scilla, is quite a different\r\nflower, not so pure a blue as the Siberian scilla, and paler; yet\r\nin the middle West, where it abounds, there are few lovelier\r\nsights in spring than a colony of these blossoms directed\r\nobliquely upward from slender, swaying scapes among the lush\r\ngrass. Their upward slant brings the stigma in immediate contact\r\nwith an incoming visitor's pollen-laden body. As the stamens\r\ndiverge with the spreading of the divisions of the perianth, to\r\nwhich they are attached, the stigma receives pollen brought from\r\nanother flower, before the visitor dusts himself anew in\r\nsearching for refreshment, thus effecting cross-pollination.\r\nAnts, bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, and beetles may be seen\r\nabout the wild hyacinth, which is obviously best adapted to the\r\nbees. The smallest insects that visit it may possibly defeat\r\nNature's plan and obtain nectar without fertilizing the flower,\r\nowing to the wide passage between stamens and stigma. In about an\r\nhour, one May morning, Professor Charles Robertson captured over\r\nsix hundred insects, representing thirty-eight distinct species,\r\non a patch of wild hyacinths in Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe bulb of a MEDITERRANEAN SCILLA (S. maritima) furnishes the\r\nsourish-sweet syrup of squills used in medicine for bronchial\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GRAPE HYACINTH (Muscari botrycides), also known as Baby's\r\nBreath, because of its delicate faint fragrance, escapes from\r\ngardens at slight encouragement to grow wild in the roadsides and\r\nmeadows from Massachusetts to Virginia and westward to Ohio. Its\r\ntiny, deep-blue, globular flowers, stiffly set around a fleshy\r\nscape that rises between erect, blade-like, channeled leaves,\r\nappear spring after spring wherever the small bulbs have been\r\nplanted. On the east end of Long Island there are certain meadows\r\nliterally blued with the little runaways.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE TRILLIUM, ILL-SCENTED WAKE-ROBIN or BIRTH-ROOT\r\n  (Trillium erectum)  Lily-of-the-Valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Solitary, dark, dull purple, or purplish red; rarely\r\ngreenish, white, or pinkish; on erect or slightly inclined\r\nfootstalk. Calyx of 3 spreading sepals, 1 to 1 1/2 in. long, or\r\nabout length of 3 pointed, oval petals; stamens 6; anthers longer\r\nthan filaments; pistil spreading into 3 short, recurved stigmas.\r\nStem: Stout, 8 to i6 in. high, from tuber-like rootstock. Leaves:\r\nIn a whorl of 3; broadly ovate, abruptly pointed, netted-veined.\r\nFruit: A 6-angled, ovate, reddish berry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia westward to Manitoba, southward to\r\nNorth Carolina and Missouri.\r\n\r\nSome weeks after the jubilant, alert robins have returned from\r\nthe South, the purple trillium unfurls its unattractive,\r\ncarrion-scented flower. In the variable colors found in different\r\nregions, one can almost trace its evolution from green, white,\r\nand red to purple, which, we are told, is the course all flowers\r\nmust follow to attain to blue. The white and pink forms, however\r\nattractive to the eye, are never more agreeable to the nose than\r\nthe reddish-purple ones. Bees and butterflies, with delicate\r\nappreciation of color and fragrance, let the blossom alone, since\r\nit secretes no nectar; and one would naturally infer either that\r\nit can fertilize itself without insect aid - a theory which\r\ncloser study of its organs goes far to disprove - or that the\r\ncarrion-scent, so repellent to us, is in itself an attraction to\r\ncertain insects needful for cross-pollination. Which are they?\r\nBeetles have been observed crawling over the flower, but without\r\neffecting any methodical result. One inclines to accept Mr.\r\nClarence M. Weed's theory of special adaptation to the common\r\ngreen flesh-flies (Lucilia carnicina), which would naturally be\r\nattracted to a flower resembling in color and odor a raw\r\nbeefsteak of uncertain age. These little creatures, seen in every\r\nbutcher shop throughout the summer, the flower furnishes with a\r\nfree lunch of pollen in consideration of the transportation of a\r\nfew grains to another blossom. Absence of the usual floral\r\nattractions gives, the carrion flies a practical monopoly of the\r\npollen food, which no doubt tastes as it smells.\r\n\r\nThe SESSILE-FLOWERED WAKE-ROBIN (T. sessile), whose dark purple,\r\npurplish-red, or greenish blossom, narrower of sepal and petals\r\nthan the preceding, is seated in a whorl of three egg-shaped,\r\nsometimes blotched, leaves, possesses a rather pleasant odor;\r\nnevertheless it seems. to have no great attraction for insects.\r\nThe stigmas, which are very large, almost touch the anthers\r\nsurrounding them; therefore the beetles which one frequently sees\r\ncrawling over them to feed on the pollen so jar them, no doubt,\r\nas to self-fertilize the flower; but it is scarcely probable\r\nthese slow crawlers often transfer the grains from one blossom to\r\nanother. A degraded flower like this has little need of color and\r\nperfume, one would suppose; yet it may be even now slowly\r\nperfecting its way toward an ideal of which we see a part only\r\ncomplete. In deep, rich, moist woods and thickets the. sessile\r\ntrillium blooms in April or May, from Pennsylvania, Ohio, and\r\nMinnesota southward nearly to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGER BLUE FLAG; BLUE IRIS; FLEUR-DE-LIS; FLOWER-DE-LUCE\r\n  (Iris versicolor)  Iris family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Several, 2 to 3 in. long, violet-blue variegated with\r\nyellow, green, or white, and purple veined. Six divisions of the\r\nperianth: 3 outer ones spreading, recurved; 1 of them bearded,\r\nmuch longer and wider than the 3 erect inner divisions; all\r\nunited into a short tube. Three stamens under 3 overhanging\r\npetal-like divisions of the style, notched at end; under each\r\nnotch is a thin plate, smooth on one side, rough and moist\r\n(stigma) on side turned away from anther. Stem: 2 to 3 ft. high,\r\nstout, straight, almost circular, sometimes branching above.\r\nLeaves: Erect, sword-shaped, shorter than stem, somewhat hoary,\r\nfrom 1/2 to 1 in. wide, folded, and in a compact flat cluster at\r\nbase; bracts usually longer than stem of flower. Fruit: Oblong\r\ncapsule, not prominently 3-lobed, and with 2 rows of round, flat\r\nseeds closely packed in each cell. Rootstock: Creeping,\r\nhorizontal, fleshy.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Marshes, wet meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland and Manitoba to Arkansas and Florida.\r\n\r\n\"The fleur-de-lys, which is the flower of chivalry,\" says Ruskin,\r\n\"has a sword for its leaf and a lily for its heart.\" When that\r\nyoung and pious Crusader, Louis VII, adopted it for the emblem of\r\nhis house, spelling was scarcely an exact science, and the\r\nfleur-de-Louis soon became corrupted into its present form.\r\nDoubtless the royal flower was the white iris, and as li is the\r\nCeltic for white, there is room for another theory as to the\r\norigin of the name. It is our far more regal looking, but truly\r\ndemocratic blossom, jostling its fellows in the marshes, that is\r\nindeed \"born in the purple.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Napoleon wished to pose as the true successor of those\r\nancient French kings whose territory included the half of Europe\r\n- ignoring every Louis who ever sat on the throne, for their very\r\nname and emblem had become odious to the people - he discarded\r\nthe fleur-de-lis, to replace it with golden bees, the symbol in\r\narmory for industry and perseverance. It is said some relics of\r\ngold and fine stones, somewhat resembling an insect in shape, had\r\nbeen found in the tomb of Clovis's father, and on the supposition\r\nthat these had been bees, Napoleon appropriated them for the\r\nimperial badge. Henceforth \"Napoleonic bees\" appeared on his\r\ncoronation robe and wherever a heraldic emblem could be employed.\r\n\r\nBut even in the meadows of France Napoleon need not have looked\r\nfar from the fleurs-de-lis growing there to find bees. Indeed,\r\nthis gorgeous flower is thought by scientists to be all that it\r\nis for the bees' benefit, which, of course, is its own also.\r\nAbundant moisture, from which to manufacture nectar - a prime\r\nnecessity with most irises - certainly is for our blue flag. The\r\nlarge showy blossom cannot but attract the passing bee, whose\r\nfavorite color (according to Sir John Lubbock) it waves. The bee\r\nalights on the convenient, spreading platform, and, guided by the\r\ndark veining and golden lines leading to the nectar, sips the\r\ndelectable fluid shortly to be changed to honey. Now, as he\r\nraises his head and withdraws it from the nectary, he must rub it\r\nagainst the pollen-laden anther above, and some of the pollen\r\nnecessarily falls on the visitor. As the sticky side of the plate\r\n(stigma), just under the petal-like division of the style, faces\r\naway from the anther, which is below it in any case, the flower\r\nis marvelously guarded against fertilization from its own pollen.\r\nThe bee, flying off to another iris, must first brush past the\r\nprojecting lip of the over-arching style, and leave on the\r\nstigmatic outer surface of the plate some of the pollen brought\r\nfrom the first flower, before reaching the nectary. Thus\r\ncross-fertilization is effected; and Darwin has shown how\r\nnecessary this is to insure the most vigorous and beautiful\r\noffspring. Without this wonderful adaptation of the flower to the\r\nrequirements of its insect friends, and of the insect to the\r\nneeds of the flower, both must perish; the former from hunger,\r\nthe latter because unable to perpetuate its race. And yet man has\r\ngreedily appropriated all the beauties of the floral kingdom as\r\ndesigned for his sole delight\r\n\r\nThe name iris, meaning a deified rainbow, which was given this\r\ngroup of plants by the ancients, shows a fine appreciation of\r\ntheir superb coloring, their ethereal texture, and the evanescent\r\nbeauty of the blossom.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the name given to another species, the SOUTHERN BLUE\r\nFLAG (I. hexagona) is really the larger one; its leaves, which\r\nare bright green, and never hoary, often equaling the stem in its\r\nheight of from two to three feet. The handsome solitary flower,\r\nsimilar to that of the larger blue flag, nevertheless has its\r\nbroad outer divisions fully an inch larger, and is seated in the\r\naxils at the top of the circular stem. The oblong, cylindric,\r\nsix-angled capsule also contains two rows of seeds in each\r\ncavity. From South Carolina and Florida to Kentucky, Missouri,\r\nand Texas one finds this iris blooming in the swamps during April\r\nand May.\r\n\r\nThe SLENDER BLUE FLAG (I. prismatica; I. Virginica of Gray),\r\nfound growing from New Brunswick to North Carolina, but mainly\r\nnear the coast, and often in the same oozy ground with the larger\r\nblue flag, may be known by its grass-like leaves, two or three of\r\nwhich usually branch out from the slender flexuous stem; by its\r\nsolitary or two blue flowers, variegated with white and veined\r\nwith yellow, that rear themselves on slender foot-stems; and by\r\nthe sharply three-angled, narrow, oblong capsule, in which but\r\none row of seeds is borne in each cavity. This is the most\r\ngraceful member of a rather stiffly stately family.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTED BLUE-EYED GRASS; EYE-BRIGHT; BLUE STAR\r\n  (Sisyrinchium angustifolium)  Iris family\r\n\r\nFlowers - From blue to purple, with a yellow center; a Western\r\nvariety, white; usually several buds at the end of stem, between\r\n2 erect unequal bracts; about 1/2 in. across; perianth of 6\r\nspreading divisions, each pointed with a bristle from a notch;\r\nstamens 3, the filaments united to above the middle; pistil 1,\r\nits tip 3-cleft. Stem: 3 to 14 in. tall, pale hoary green, flat,\r\nrigid, 2-edged. Leaves: Grass-like, pale, rigid, mostly from\r\nbase. Fruit: 3-celled capsule, nearly globose.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist fields and meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to British Columbia, from eastern\r\nslope of Rocky Mountains to Atlantic, south to Virginia and\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nOnly for a day, and that must be a bright one, will this \"little\r\nsister of the stately blue flag\" open its eyes, to close them in\r\nindignation on being picked; nor will any coaxing but the\r\nsunshine's induce it to open them again in water, immediately\r\nafter. The dainty flower, growing in dense tufts, makes up in\r\nnumbers what it lacks in size and lasting power, flecking our\r\nmeadows with purplish ultramarine blue in a sunny June morning.\r\nLater in the day, apparently there are no blossoms there, for all\r\nare tightly closed, never to bloom again. New buds will unfold to\r\ntinge the field on the morrow.\r\n\r\nUsually three buds nod from between a pair of bracts, the lower\r\none of which may be twice the length of the upper one but only\r\none flower opens at a time. Slight variations in this plant have\r\nbeen considered sufficient to differentiate several species\r\nformerly included by Gray and other American botanists under the\r\nname of S. Bermudiana.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE or EARLY, PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS\r\n  (Habenaria grandiflora; H. fimbriata of Gray)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink-purple and pale lilac, sometimes nearly white;\r\nfragrant, alternate, clustered in thick, dense spikes from 3 to\r\n15 in. long. Upper sepal and toothed petals erect; the lip of\r\ndeepest shade, 1/2 in. long, fan-shaped, 3-parted, fringed half\r\nits length, and prolonged at base into slender, long spur; stamen\r\nunited with style into short column; 2 anther sacs slightly\r\ndivergent, the hollow between them glutinous, stigmatic. Stem. 1\r\nto 5 ft. high, angled, twisted. Leaves: Oval, large, sheathing\r\nthe stem below; smaller, lance-shaped ones higher up; bracts\r\nabove. Root: Thick, fibrous.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist meadows, muddy places, woods.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Ontario; southward to North\r\nCarolina, westward to Michigan.\r\n\r\nBecause of the singular and exquisitely unerring adaptations of\r\norchids as a family to their insect visitors, no group of plants\r\nhas greater interest for the botanist since Darwin interpreted\r\ntheir marvelous mechanism, and Gray, his instant disciple,\r\nrevealed the hidden purposes of our native American species, no\r\nless wonderfully constructed than the most costly exotic in a\r\nmillionaire's hothouse.\r\n\r\nA glance at the spur of this orchid, one of the handsomest and\r\nmost striking of its clan, and the heavy perfume of the flower,\r\nwould seem to indicate that only a moth with a long proboscis\r\ncould reach the nectar secreted at the base of the thread-like\r\npassage. Butterflies, attracted by the conspicuous color,\r\nsometimes hover about the showy spikes of bloom, but it is\r\nprobable that, to secure a sip, all but possibly the very largest\r\nof them must go to the smaller purple-fringed orchis, whose\r\nshorter spur holds out a certain prospect of reward; for, in\r\nthese two cases, as in so many others, the flower's welcome for\r\nan insect is in exact proportion to the length of its visitor's\r\ntongue. Doubtless it is one of the smaller sphinx moths, such as\r\nwe see at dusk working about the evening primrose and other\r\nflowers deep of chalice, and heavily perfumed to guide visitors\r\nto their feast, that is the great purple-fringed orchid's\r\nbenefactor, since the length of its tongue is perfectly adapted\r\nto its needs. Attracted by the showy, broad lower petal, his\r\nwings ever in rapid motion, the moth proceeds to unroll his\r\nproboscis and drain the cup, that is frequently an inch and a\r\nhalf deep. Thrusting in his head, either one or both of his\r\nlarge, projecting eyes are pressed against the sticky\r\nbutton-shaped disks to which the pollen masses are attached by a\r\nstalk, and as he raises his head to depart, feeling that he is\r\ncaught, he gives a little jerk that detaches them, and away he\r\nflies with these still fastened to his eyes.\r\n\r\nEven while he is flying to another flower, that is to say, in\r\nhalf a minute, the stalks of the pollen masses bend downward from\r\nthe perpendicular and slightly toward the center, or just far\r\nenough to require the moth, in thrusting his proboscis into the\r\nnectary, to strike the glutinous, sticky stigma. Now, withdrawing\r\nhis head, either or both of the golden clubs he brought in with\r\nhim will be left on the precise spot where they will fertilize\r\nthe flower. Sometimes, but rarely, we catch a butterfly or moth\r\nfrom the smaller or larger purple orchids with a pollen mass\r\nattached to his tongue, instead of to his eyes; this is when he\r\ndoes not make his entrance from the exact center - as in these\r\nflowers he is not obliged to do - and in order to reach the\r\nnectary his tongue necessarily brushes against one of the sticky\r\nanther sacs. The performance may be successfully imitated by\r\nthrusting some blunt point about the size of a moth's head, a\r\ndull pencil or a knitting-needle, into the flower as an insect\r\nwould enter. Withdraw the pencil, and one or both of the pollen\r\nmasses will be found sticking to it, and already automatically\r\nchanging their attitude. In the case of the large, round-leaved\r\norchis, whose greenish-white flowers are fertilized in a similar\r\nmanner by the sphinx moth, the anther sacs converge, like little\r\nhorns; and their change of attitude while they are being carried\r\nto fertilize another flower is quite as exquisitely exact.\r\n\r\nUsually in wetter ground than we find its more beautiful big\r\nsister growing in, most frequently in swamps and bogs, the\r\nSMALLER PURPLE-FRINGED ORCHIS (H. psycodes) lifts its perfumed\r\nlilac spires. Thither go the butterflies and long-lipped bees to\r\nfeast in July and August. Inasmuch as without their aid the\r\norchid must perish from its inability to set fertile seed, no\r\nwonder it woos its benefactors with a showy mass of color,\r\ncharming fringes, sweet perfume, and copious draughts of nectar,\r\nand makes their visits of the utmost value to itself by the\r\ningenious mechanism described above. Here is no waste of pollen;\r\nthat is snugly packed in little bundles, ready to be carried off,\r\nbut placed where they cannot come in contact with the adjoining\r\nstigma, since every orchid, almost without exception, refuses to\r\nbe deteriorated through self-fertilization.\r\n\r\n>From New Jersey and Illinois southward, particularly in\r\nmountainous regions, if not among the mountains themselves, the\r\nFRINGELESS PURPLE ORCHIS (H. perarnoena) may be found blooming in\r\nmoist meadows through July and August. Moisture, from which to\r\nmanufacture the nectar that orchids rely upon so largely to\r\nentice insects to work for them, is naturally a prime necessity;\r\nyet Sprengel attempted to prove that many orchids are gaudy shams\r\nand produce no nectar, but exist by an organized system of\r\ndeception. \"Scheinsaftblumen\" he called them. From the number of\r\nbutterflies seen hovering about this fringeless orchis and its\r\nmore attractive kin, it is small wonder their nectaries are soon\r\nexhausted and they are accused of being gay deceivers. Sprengel's\r\nmuch-quoted theory would credit moths, butterflies, and even the\r\nhighly intelligent bees with scant sense; but Darwin, who\r\nthoroughly tested it, forever exonerated these insects from\r\nimputed stupidity and the flowers from gross dishonesty. He found\r\nthat many European orchids secrete their nectar between the outer\r\nand inner walls of the tube, which a bumblebee can easily pierce,\r\nbut where Sprengel never thought to look for it. The large lip of\r\nthis orchis is not fringed, but has a fine picotee edge. The\r\nshowy violet-purple, long-spurred flowers are alternately set on\r\na stem that is doing its best if it reach a height of two and a\r\nhalf feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-SHIELD or WATER TARGET\r\n  (Brasenia purpurea; B. peltata of Gray)  Water-lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, dull purplish, about 1/2 in. across, on stout\r\nfootstalks from axils of upper leaves; 3 narrow sepals and\r\npetals; stamens 12 to 18; pistils 4 to 18, forming 1 to 3-seeded\r\npods. Stem: From submerged rootstock; slender, branching, several\r\nfeet long, covered with clear jelly, as are footstalks and lower\r\nleaf surfaces. Leaves: On long petioles attached to center of\r\nunderside of leaf, floating or rising, oval to roundish, 2 to 4\r\nin. long, 1 1/2 to 2 in. wide.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Still, rather deep water of ponds and slow\r\nstreams.\r\nFlowering Season - All summer.\r\nDistribution - Parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia, Nova Scotia\r\nto Cuba, and westward from California to Puget Sound.\r\n\r\nOf this pretty water plant Dr. Abbott says, in \"Wasteland\r\nWanderings\": \"I gathered a number of floating, delicate leaves,\r\nand endeavored to secure the entire stem also; but this was too\r\ndifficult a task for an August afternoon. The under side of the\r\nstem and leaf are purplish brown and were covered with\r\ntranslucent jelly, embedded in which were millions of what I took\r\nto be insects' eggs. They certainly had that appearance. I was\r\nfar more interested to find that, usually, beneath each leaf\r\nthere was hiding a little pike. The largest was not two inches in\r\nlength. When disturbed, they swam a few inches, and seemed wholly\r\n'at sea' if there was not another leaf near by to afford them\r\nshelter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN or COMMON GARDEN COLUMBINE\r\n  (Aquilegia vulgaris)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Showy, blue, purple, or white, 1 1/2 to 2 in. broad, or\r\nabout as broad as long; spurs stout and strongly incurved.\r\nGeneral characteristics of plant resembling wild columbine.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Escaped from gardens to woods and fields in\r\nEastern and Middle States. Native of Europe.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\n\r\nA heavier, less graceful flower than either the wild red and\r\nyellow columbine or the exquisite, long-spurred, blue and white\r\nspecies (A. coerulea) of the Rocky Mountain region; nevertheless\r\nthis European immigrant, now making itself at home here, is a\r\ncharming addition to our flora. How are insects to reach the well\r\nof nectar secreted in the tip of its incurved, hooked spur?\r\nCertain of the long-lipped bees, large bumblebees, whose tongues\r\nhave developed as rapidly as the flower, are able to drain it.\r\nHummingbirds, partial to red flowers, fertilize the wild\r\ncolumbine, but let this one alone. Muller watched a female\r\nbumblebee making several vain attempts to sip this blue one. Soon\r\nthe brilliant idea of biting a hole through each spur flashed\r\nthrough her little brain, and the first experiment proving\r\ndelightfully successful, she proceeded to bite holes through\r\nother flowers without first trying to suck them. Apparently she\r\nsatisfied her feminine conscience with the reflection that the\r\nflower which made dining so difficult for its benefactors\r\ndeserved no better treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD or BRANCHED LARKSPUR; KNIGHT'S-SPUR; LARK-HEEL\r\n  (Delphinium Consoilda)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue to pinkish and whitish, 1 to 1 1/2 in. long, hung\r\non slender stems and scattered along spreading branches; 5\r\npetal-like sepals, the rear one prolonged into long, slender,\r\ncurving spur; 2 petals, united. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Divided into very finely cut linear segments. Fruit:\r\nErect, smooth pod tipped with a short beak; open on one side.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides and fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe; from New Jersey\r\nsouthward, occasionally escaped from gardens farther north.\r\n\r\nKeats should certainly have extolled the larkspurs in his sonnet\r\non blue. No more beautiful group of plants contributes to the\r\ncharm of gardens, woods, and roadsides, where some have escaped\r\ncultivation and become naturalized, than the delphinium, that\r\ntake their name from a fancied resemblance to a dolphin\r\n(delphin), given them by Linnaeus in one of his wild flights of\r\nimagination. Having lost the power to fertilize themselves,\r\naccording to Muller, they are pollenized by both bees and\r\nbutterflies, insects whose tongues have kept pace with the\r\ndevelopment of certain flowers, such as the larkspur, columbine,\r\nand violet, that they may reach into the deep recesses of the\r\nspurs where the nectar is hidden from all but benefactors.\r\n\r\nThe TALL WILD LARKSPUR (D. urceolatum; D. exaltatum of Gray)\r\nwaves long, crowded, downy wands of intense purplish blue in the\r\nrich woods of Western Pennsylvania, southward to the Carolinas\r\nand Alabama, and westward to Nebraska. Its spur is nearly\r\nstraight, not to increase the difficulty a bee must have in\r\npressing his lips through the upper and lower petals to reach the\r\nnectar at the end of it. First, the stamens successively raise\r\nthemselves in the passage back of the petals to dust his head;\r\nthen, when each has shed its pollen and bent down again, the\r\npistil takes its turn in occupying the place, so that a\r\npollen-laden bee, coming to visit the blossom from an earlier\r\nflower; can scarcely help fertilizing it. It is said there are\r\nbut two insects in Europe with lips long enough to reach the\r\nbottom of the long horn of plenty hung by the BEE LARKSPUR (D.\r\nelatum), that we know only in gardens here. Its yellowish bearded\r\nlower petals readily deceive one into thinking a bee has just\r\nalighted there.\r\n\r\n>From April to June the DWARF LARKSPUR or STAGGER-WEED (D.\r\ntricorne), which, however, may sometimes grow three feet high,\r\nlifts a loose raceme of blue, rarely white, flowers an inch or\r\nmore long, at the end of a stout stem rising from a tuberous\r\nroot. Its slightly ascending spur, its three widely spreading\r\nseed vessels, and the deeply cut leaf of from five to seven\r\ndivisions are distinguishing characteristics. From Western\r\nPennsylvania and Georgia to Arkansas and Minnesota it is found in\r\nrather stiff soil. Butterflies, which prefer erect flowers, have\r\nsome difficulty to cling while they drain the almost upright\r\nspurs, especially the Papilios, which usually suck with their\r\nwings in motion. But the bees, to which the delphinium are best\r\nadapted, although butterflies visit them quite as frequently,\r\nfind a convenient landing place prepared for them, and fertilize\r\nthe flower while they sip with ease.\r\n\r\nMore slender, downy, and dwarf of stem than the preceding is the\r\nCAROLINA LARKSPUR (D. Carolinianum), whose blue flowers, varying\r\nto white, and its very finely cleft leaves, may be found in the\r\nSouth, on prairies in the North and West, and in the Rocky\r\nMountain region.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER-LEAF; HEPATICA; LIVERWORT; ROUND-LOBED or KIDNEY\r\nLIVER-LEAF; NOBLE LIVER-WORT; SQUIRREL CUP\r\n  (Hepalica Hepatica; H. triloba of Gray)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue, lavender, purple, pinkish, or white;\r\noccasionally, not always, fragrant; 6 to 12 petal-like, colored\r\nsepals (not petals, as they appear to be), oval or oblong;\r\nnumerous stamens, all bearing anthers; pistils numerous 3 small,\r\nsessile leaves, forming an involucre directly under flower,\r\nsimulate a calyx, for which they might be mistaken. Stems:\r\nSpreading from the root, 4 to 6 in. high, a solitary flower or\r\nleaf borne at end of each furry stem. Leaves: 3-lobed and\r\nrounded, leathery, evergreen; sometimes mottled with, or\r\nentirely, reddish purple; spreading on ground, rusty at blooming\r\ntime, the new leaves appearing after the flowers. Fruit: Usually\r\nas many as pistils, dry, 1-seeded, oblong, sharply pointed, never\r\nopening.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods; light soil on hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - December-May.\r\nDistribution - Canada to Northern Florida, Manitoba to Iowa and\r\nMissouri. Most common East.\r\n\r\nEven under the snow itself bravely blooms the delicate hepatica,\r\nwrapped in fuzzy furs as if to protect its stems and nodding buds\r\nfrom cold. After the plebeian skunk cabbage, that ought scarcely\r\nto be reckoned among true flowers - and William Hamilton Gibson\r\nclaimed even before it - it is the first blossom to appear.\r\nWinter sunshine, warming the hillsides and edges of woods, opens\r\nits eyes,\r\n\r\n       \"Blue as the heaven it gates at,\r\n    Startling the loiterer in the naked groves\r\n    With unexpected beauty; for the time\r\n    Of blossoms and green leaves is yet afar.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things left for May,\" says John Burroughs, \"but\r\nnothing fairer, if as fair, as the first flower, the hepatica. I\r\nfind I have never admired this little firstling half enough. When\r\nat the maturity of its charms, it is certainly the gem of the\r\nwoods. What an individuality it has! No two clusters alike; all\r\nshades and sizes.... A solitary blue-purple one, fully expanded\r\nand rising over the brown leaves or the green moss, its cluster\r\nof minute anthers showing like a group of pale stars on its\r\nlittle firmament, is enough to arrest and hold the dullest eye.\r\nThen,...there are individual hepaticas, or individual families\r\namong them, that are sweet scented. The gift seems as capricious\r\nas the gift of genius in families. You cannot tell which the\r\nfragrant ones are till you try them. Sometimes it is the large\r\nwhite ones, sometimes the large purple ones, sometimes the small\r\npink ones. The odor is faint and recalls that of the sweet\r\nviolets. A correspondent, who seems to have carefully observed\r\nthese fragrant hepaticas, writes me that this gift of odor is\r\nconstant in the same plant; that the plant which bears\r\nsweet-scented flowers this year will bear them next.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not evident that insect aid is necessary to transfer the\r\ntiny, hairy spiral ejected from each cell of the antherid, after\r\nit has burst from ripeness, to the canal of the flask-shaped\r\norgan at whose base the germ-cell is located. Perfect flowers can\r\nfertilize themselves. But pollen-feeding flies, and female hive\r\nbees which collect it, and the earliest butterflies trifle about\r\nthe blossoms when the first warm days come. Whether they are\r\nrewarded by finding nectar or not is still a mooted question.\r\nPossibly the papillae which cover the receptacle secrete nectar,\r\nfor almost without exception the insect visitors thrust their\r\nproboscides down between the spreading filaments as if certain of\r\na sip. None merely feed on the pollen except the flies and the\r\nhive bee.\r\n\r\nThe SHARP-LOBED LIVER-LEAF (Hepatica acuta) differs chiefly from\r\nthe preceding in having the ends of the lobes of its leaves and\r\nthe tips of the three leaflets that form its involucre quite\r\nsharply pointed. Its range, while perhaps not actually more\r\nwesterly, appears so, since it is rare in the East, where its\r\ncousin is so abundant; and common in the West, where the\r\nround-lobed liver-leaf is scarce. It blooms in March and April.\r\nProfessor Halsted has noted that this species bears staminate\r\nflowers on one plant and pistillate flowers on another; whereas\r\nthe Hepatica Hepatica usually bears flowers of both sexes above\r\nthe same root. The blossoms, which close at night to keep warm,\r\nand open in the morning, remain on the beautiful plant for a long\r\ntime to accommodate the bees and flies that, in this case, are\r\nessential to the perpetuation of the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE VIRGIN'S BOWER\r\n  (Atragene Americana)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Showy, purplish blue, about 3 in. across; 4 sepals,\r\nbroadly expanded, thin, translucent, strongly veined, very large,\r\nsimulating petals; petals small, spoon-shaped; stamens very\r\nnumerous ; styles long, persistent, plumed throughout. Stem:\r\nTrailing or partly climbing with the help of leafstalks and\r\nleaflets. Leaves: Opposite, compounded of 3 egg-shaped, pointed\r\nleaflets on slender petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat -  - Rocky woodlands.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Hudson Bay westward, south to Minnesota and\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe day on which one finds this rare and beautiful flower in some\r\nrocky ravine high among the hills or mountains becomes memorable\r\nto the budding botanist. At an elevation of three thousand feet\r\nin the Catskills it trails its way over the rocks, fallen trees,\r\nand undergrowth of the forest, suggesting some of the handsome\r\nJapanese species introduced by Sieboldt and Fortune to Occidental\r\ngardens. No one who sees this broadly expanded blossom could\r\nconfuse it either with the thick and bell-shaped purple\r\nLEATHER-FLOWER (C. Viorna), so exquisitely feathery in fruit,\r\nthat grows in rich, moist soil from Pennsylvania southward and\r\nwestward; or with the far more graceful and deliciously fragrant\r\npurple MARSH CLEMATIS (C. crispa) of our Southern States. The\r\nlatter, though bell-shaped also, has thin, recurved sepals, and\r\nits persistent styles are silky, not feathery at seed-time.\r\n\r\n\r\nORPINE; LIVE-FOREVER; MIDSUMMER-MEN; LIVE-LONG; PUDDING-BAG\r\nPLANT; GARDEN STONECROP; WITCHES' MONEY\r\n  (Sedum Telephium)  Orpine family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull purplish, very pale or bright reddish purple in\r\nclose, round, terminal clusters, each flower 1/3 in. or less\r\nacross, 5-parted, the petals twice as long as the sepals; 10\r\nstamens, alternate ones attached to petals; pistils 4 or 5. Stem:\r\n2 ft. high or less, erect, simple, in tufts, very smooth, pale\r\ngreen, juicy, leafy. Leaves: Alternate, oval, slightly scalloped,\r\nthick, fleshy, smooth, juicy, pale gray green, with stout midrib,\r\nseated on stalk.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, waysides, rocky soil, originally\r\nescaped from gardens.\r\nFlowering Season - June- September.\r\nDistribution - Quebec westward, south to Michigan and Maryland.\r\n\r\nChildren know the live-forever, not so well by the variable\r\nflower - for it is a niggardly bloomer - as by the thick leaf\r\nthat they delight to hold in the mouth until, having loosened the\r\nmembrane, they are able to inflate it like a paper bag. Sometimes\r\ndull, sometimes bright, the flower clusters never fail to attract\r\nmany insects to their feast, which is accessible even to those of\r\nshort tongues. Each blossom is perfect in itself, i.e., it\r\ncontains both stamens and pistils; but to guard against\r\nself-fertilization it ripens its anthers and sheds its pollen on\r\nthe insects that carry it away to older flowers before its own\r\nstigmas mature and become susceptible to imported pollen. After\r\nthe seed-cases take on color, they might be mistaken for\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\nAs if the plant did not already possess enough popular names, it\r\nneeds must share with the European goldenrod and our common\r\nmullein the title of Aaron's rod. Sedere, to sit, the root of the\r\ngeneric name, applies with rare appropriateness to this entire\r\ngroup that we usually find seated on garden walls, rocks, or, in\r\nEurope, even on the roofs of old buildings. Rooting freely from\r\nthe joints, our plant forms thrifty tufts where there is little\r\napparent nourishment; yet its endurance through prolonged drought\r\nis remarkable. Long after the farmer's scythe, sweeping over the\r\nroadside, has laid it low, it thrives on the juices stored up in\r\nfleshy leaves and stem until it proves its title to the most\r\nlusty of all folk names.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE or WATER AVENS\r\n  (Geum rivale)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purple, with some orange chrome, 1 in. broad or less,\r\nterminal, solitary, nodding; calyx 5-lobed, purplish, spreading;\r\n5 petals, abruptly narrowed into claws, forming a cup-shaped\r\ncorolla; stamens and pistils of indefinite number; the styles,\r\njointed and bent in middle, persistent, feathery below. Stem: 1\r\nto 2 ft. high, erect, simple or nearly so, hairy, from thickish\r\nrootstock. Leaves: Chiefly from root, on footstems; lower leaves\r\nirregularly parted; the side segments usually few and small; the\r\n1 to 3 terminal segments sharply, irregularly lobed; the few\r\ndistant stem leaves 3-foliate or simple, mostly seated on stem.\r\nFruit: A dry, hairy head stalked in calyx.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps and low, wet ground.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland far westward, south to Colorado,\r\neastward to Missouri and Pennsylvania, also northern parts of Old\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nMischievous bumblebees, thrusting their long tongues between the\r\nsepals and petals of these unopened flowers, steal nectar without\r\nconferring any favor in return. Later, when they behave properly\r\nand put their heads inside to feast at the disk on which the\r\nstamens are inserted, they dutifully carry pollen from old\r\nflowers to the early maturing stigmas of younger ones.\r\nSelf-fertilization must occur, however, if the bees have not\r\nremoved all the pollen when a blossom closes. When the purple\r\navens opens in Europe, the bees desert even the primrose to feast\r\nupon its abundant nectar. Since water is the prime necessity in\r\nthe manufacture of this sweet, and since insects that feed upon\r\nit have so much to do with the multiplication of flowers, it is\r\nnot surprising that the swamp, which has been called \"nature's\r\nsanctuary,\" should have its altars so exquisitely decked. This\r\nblossom hangs its head, partly to protect its precious nectar\r\nfrom rain, and partly to make pilfering well nigh impossible to\r\nthe unwelcome crawling insect that may have braved the forbidding\r\nhairy stems.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD LUPINE; OLD MAID'S BONNETS; WILD PEA; SUN DIAL\r\n  (Lupinus perennis)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Vivid blue, very rarely pink or white, butterfly-shaped\r\ncorolla consisting of standard, wings, and keel; about 1/2 in.\r\nlong, borne in a long raceme at end of stern; calyx 2-lipped,\r\ndeeply toothed. Stem: Erect, branching, leafy, to 2 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Palmnate, compounded of from 7 to 11 (usually 8)\r\nleaflets. Fruit: A broad, flat, very hairy pod, 1 1/2 in. long,\r\nand containing 4 or 5 seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, sandy places, banks, and hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - United States east of Mississippi, and eastern\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nFarmers once thought that this plant preyed upon the fertility of\r\ntheir soil, as we see in the derivation of its name, from lupus,\r\na wolf; whereas the lupine contents itself with sterile waste\r\nland no one should grudge it - steep gravelly banks, railroad\r\ntracks, exposed sunny hills, where even it must often burn out\r\nunder fierce sunshine did not its root penetrate to surprising\r\ndepths. It spreads far and wide in thrifty colonies, reflecting\r\nthe vivid color of June skies, until, as Thoreau says, \"the earth\r\nis blued with it.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is the advantage gained in the pea-shaped blossom? As usual,\r\nthe insect that fertilizes the flower best knows the answer. The\r\ncorolla has five petals, the upper one called the standard,\r\nchiefly a flaunted advertisement; two side wings, or platforms,\r\nto alight on; and a keel like a miniature boat, formed by the two\r\nlower petals, whose edges meet. In this the pistil, stamens, and\r\nnectar are concealed and protected. The pressure of a bee's\r\nweight as he alights on the wings, light as it must be, is\r\nnevertheless sufficient to depress and open the keel, which is\r\nelastically affected by their motion, and so to expose the pollen\r\njust where the long-lipped bee must rub off some against his\r\nunderside as he sucks the nectar. He actually seems to pump the\r\npollen that has fallen into the forward part of the keel upon\r\nhimself, as he moves about. As soon as he leaves the flower, the\r\nelastic wings resume their former position, thus closing the keel\r\nto prevent waste of pollen. Take a sweet pea from the garden,\r\npress down its wings with the thumb and forefinger to imitate the\r\naction of the bee on them; note how the keel opens to display its\r\ntreasures, and resumes its customary shape when the pressure is\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe lupine is another of those interesting plants which go to\r\nsleep at night. Some members of the genus erect one half of the\r\nleaf and droop the other half until it becomes a vertical instead\r\nof the horizontal star it is by day. Frequently the leaflets\r\nrotate as much as 90 degrees on their own axes. Some lupines fold\r\ntheir leaflets, not at night only, but during the day also there\r\nis more or less movement in the leaves. Sun dial, a popular name\r\nfor the wild lupine, has reference to this peculiarity. The leaf\r\nof our species shuts downward around its stem, umbrella fashion,\r\nor the leaflets are erected to prevent the chilling which comes\r\nto horizontal surfaces by radiation, some scientists think. \"That\r\nthe sleep movements of leaves are in some manner of high\r\nimportance to the plants which exhibit them,\" says Darwin, \"few\r\nwill dispute who have observed how complex they sometimes are.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADIAN or SHOWY TICK-TREFOIL\r\n  (Meibomia Canadensis; Desmodium Canadense of Gray)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pinkish or bluish purple, butterfly-shaped, about 1/2\r\nin. long, borne in dense, terminal, elongated racemes. Stem;\r\nErect, hairy, leafy, 2 to 8 ft. high. Leaves: Compounded of 3\r\noblong leaflets, the central one largest; upper leaves nearly\r\nseated on stem; bracts, conspicuous before flowering, early\r\nfalling off. Fruit: A flat pod, about 1 in. long, jointed, and\r\ncovered with minute hooked bristles, the lower edge of pod\r\nscalloped; almost seated in calyx.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Thickets, woods, riverbanks, bogs. Flowering\r\nSeason - July-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Northwest Territory, south to\r\nNorth Carolina, westward to Indian Territory and Dakota.\r\n\r\nAs one travels hundreds or even thousands of miles in a\r\ncomfortable railway carriage and sees the same flowers growing\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the area, one cannot but\r\nwonder however the plants manage to make the journey. We know\r\nsome creep along the ground, or under it, a tortoise pace, but a\r\nwinning one; that some send their offspring flying away from\r\nhome, like dandelions and thistles; and many others with wings\r\nand darts are blown by the wind. Berries have their seeds dropped\r\nafar by birds. Aquatic plants and those that grow beside running\r\nwater travel by river and flood. European species reach our\r\nshores among the ballast. Darwin raised over sixty wild plants\r\nfrom seed carried in a pellet of mud taken from the leg of a\r\npartridge. So on and so on. The imagination delights to picture\r\nthese floral vagabonds, each with its own clever method of\r\ngetting a fresh start in the world. But by none of these methods\r\njust mentioned do the tick-trefoils spread abroad. Theirs is\r\nindeed a by hook or by crook system. The scalloped, jointed pod,\r\nwhere the seeds lie concealed, has minute crooked bristles, which\r\ncatch in the clothing of man or beast, so that every herd of\r\nsheep, every dog, every man, woman, or child who passes through a\r\npatch of trefoils gives them a lift. After a walk through the\r\nwoods and lanes of late summer and autumn, one's clothes reveal\r\nscores of tramps that have stolen a ride in the hope of being\r\npicked off and dropped amid better conditions in which to rear a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nOnly the largest bees can easily \"explode\" the showy\r\ntick-trefoil. A bumblebee alights upon a flower, thrusts his head\r\nunder the base of the standard petal, and forces apart the wing\r\npetals with his legs, in order to dislodge them from the\r\nstandard. This motion causes the keel, also connected with the\r\nstandard, to snap down violently, thus releasing the column\r\nwithin and sending upward an explosion of pollen on the under\r\nsurface of the bee. Here we see the wing petals acting as\r\ntriggers to discharge the flower. Depress them and up flies the\r\nfertilizing dust - once. The little gun will not \"go off\" twice.\r\nNo nectar rewards the visitor, which usually is a\r\npollen-collecting bee. The highly intelligent and important\r\nbumblebee has the advantage over his smaller kin in being able to\r\ndischarge the pollen from both large and smaller flowers.\r\n\r\nThe NAKED-FLOWERED TICK-TREFOIL (M. nudiflora; D. nudiflorum of\r\nGray) lifts narrow, few-flowered panicles of rose-purple blooms\r\nduring July and August. The flowers are much smaller than those\r\nof the showy trefoil; however, when seen in masses, they form\r\nconspicuous patches of color in dry woods. Note that there is a\r\nflower stalk which is usually leafless and also a leaf-bearing\r\nstem rising from the base of the plant, the latter with its\r\nleaves all crowded at the top, if you would distinguish this very\r\ncommon species from its multitudinous kin. The trefoliate leaves\r\nare pale beneath. The two or three jointed pod rises far above\r\nthe calyx on its own stalk, as in the next species.\r\n\r\nThe POINTED-LEAVED TICK-TREFOIL (M. grandifiora; D. acuminatum of\r\nGray) has for its distinguishing feature a cluster of leaves high\r\nup on the same stem from which rises a stalk bearing a quantity\r\nof purple flowers that are large by comparison only. The leaves\r\nhave leaflets from two to six inches long, rounded on the sides,\r\nbut acutely pointed, and with scattered hairs above and below.\r\nThis trefoil is found blooming in dry or rocky woods, throughout\r\na wide range, from June to September.\r\n\r\nLying outstretched for two to six feet on the dry ground of open\r\nwoods and copses east of the Mississippi, the PROSTRATE\r\nTICK-TREFOIL (M. Michauxii; D. rotundifoliurn of Gray) can\r\ncertainly be named by its soft hairiness, the almost perfect\r\nroundness of its trefoliate leaves, its rather loose racemes of\r\ndeep purple flowers that spring both from the leaf axils and from\r\nthe ends of the sometimes branching stem; and by its three to\r\nfive jointed pod, which is deeply scalloped on its lower edge and\r\nsomewhat indented above, as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE, TUFTED, or COW VETCH or TARE; CAT PEAS; TINEGRASS\r\n  (Vicia Cracca)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue, later purple; 1/2 in. long, growing downward in\r\n1-sided spike, 15 to 40 flowered; calyx oblique, small, with\r\nunequal teeth; corolla butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard,\r\nwings, and keel, all oblong; the first clawed, the second\r\noblique, and adhering to the shorter keel; 10 stamens, 1 detached\r\nfrom other 9. Stem: Slender, weak, climbing or trailing, downy, 2\r\nto 4 ft. long. Leaves: Tendril bearing, divided into 18 to 24\r\nthin, narrow, oblong leaflets. Fruit: A smooth pod 1 in. long or\r\nless, 5 to 8 seeded.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, fields, wastelands.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - United States from New Jersey, Kentucky, and Iowa\r\nnorthward and northwestward. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nDry fields blued with the bright blossoms of the tufted vetch,\r\nand roadsides and thickets where the angular vine sends forth\r\nvivid patches of color, resound with the music of happy bees.\r\nAlthough the parts of the flower fit closely together, they are\r\nelastic, and opening with the energetic visitor's weight and\r\nmovement give ready access to the nectary. On his departure they\r\nresume their original position, to protect both nectar and pollen\r\nfrom rain and pilferers whose bodies are not perfectly adapted to\r\nfurther the flower's cross-fertilization. The common bumblebee\r\n(Bombus terrestris) plays a mean trick, all too frequently, when\r\nhe bites a hole at the base of the blossom, not only gaining easy\r\naccess to the sweets for himself, but opening the way for others\r\nless intelligent than he, but quite ready to profit by his\r\nmischief, and so defeat nature's plan. Dr. Ogle observed that the\r\nsame bee always acts in the same manner, one sucking the nectar\r\nlegitimately, another always biting a hole to obtain it\r\nsurreptitiously, the natural inference, of course, being that\r\nsome bees, like small boys, are naturally depraved.\r\n\r\nIn cultivated fields and waste places farther south and westward\r\nto the Pacific Coast roams the COMMON or PEBBLE VETCH OR TARE (V.\r\nsaliva), another domesticated weed that has come to us from\r\nEurope, where it is extensively grown for fodder. Let no reproach\r\nfall on these innocent plants that bear an opprobrious name: the\r\ntare of Scripture is altogether different, the bearded darnel of\r\nMediterranean regions, whose leaves deceive one by simulating\r\nthose of wheat, and whose smaller seeds, instead of nourishing\r\nman, poison him. Only one or two light blue-purple flowers grow\r\nin the axils of the leaves of our common vetch. The leaf,\r\ncompounded of from eight to fourteen leaflets, indented at the\r\ntop, has a long terminal tendril, whose little sharp tip assists\r\nthe awkward vine, like a grappling hook.\r\n\r\nThe AMERICAN VETCH or TARE or PEA VINE (V. Americana) boasts\r\nslightly larger bluish-purple flowers than the blue vetch, but\r\nfewer of them; from three to nine only forming its loose raceme.\r\nIn moist soil throughout a very broad northerly and westerly\r\nrange it climbs and trails its graceful way, with the help of the\r\ntendrils on the tips of leaves compounded of from eight to\r\nfourteen oblong, blunt, and veiny leaflets.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACH, SEA, SEASIDE, or EVERLASTING PEA\r\n  (Lathyrus maritimus)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purple, butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard petal,\r\nwings, and keel; 1 in. long or less, clustered in short raceme at\r\nend of slender footstalk from leaf axils; calyx 5-toothed;\r\nstamens 10 (9 and 1); style curved, flattened, bearded on inner\r\nside. Stem: to 2 ft. long, stout, reclining, spreading, leafy.\r\nLeaves: Compounded of 3 to 6 pairs of oblong leaflets somewhat\r\nlarger than halberd-shaped stipules at base of leaf; branched\r\ntendrils at end of it. Fruit: A flat, 2-valved, veiny pod,\r\ncontinuous between the seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Beaches of Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, also\r\nof Great Lakes.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August. Sometimes blooming again in\r\nautumn.\r\nDistribution - New Jersey to Arctic Circle; also Northern Europe\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nSturdy clumps of the beach pea, growing beyond reach of the tide\r\nin the dunes and sandy wastelands back of the beach, afford the\r\nbee the last restaurant where he may regale himself without fear\r\nof drowning. From some members of the pea family, as from the\r\nwild lupine, for example, his weight, as he moves about, actually\r\npumps the pollen that has fallen into the forward part of the\r\nblossom's keel onto his body, that he may transfer it to another\r\nflower. In some other members his weight so depresses the keel\r\nthat the stamens are forced out to dust him over, the flower\r\nresuming its original position to protect its nectar and the\r\nremaining pollen just as soon as the pressure is removed. Other\r\npeas, again, burst at his pressure, and discharge their pollen on\r\nhim. Now, in the beach pea, and similarly in the vetches, the\r\nstyle is hairy on its inner side, to brush out the pollen on the\r\nvisitor who sets the automatic sweeper in motion as he alights\r\nand moves about. So perfectly have many members of this\r\ninteresting family adapted their structure to the requirements of\r\ninsects, and so implicitly do they rely on their automatic\r\nmechanism, that they have actually lost the power to fertilize\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn moist or wet ground throughout a northern range from ocean to\r\nocean, the MARSH VETCHLING (Lathyrus palustris) bears its purple,\r\nbutterfly-shaped flowers, that are the merest trifle over half\r\nthe size of those of the beach pea. From two to six of these\r\nlittle blossoms are alternately set along the end of the stalk.\r\nThe leaflets, which are narrowly oblong, and acute at the apex,\r\nstand up opposite each other in pairs (from two to four) along\r\nthe main leafstalk, that splits at the end to form hooked\r\ntendrils.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLY or BLUE PEA\r\n  (Clitoria Mariana)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright lavender blue, showy, about 2 in. long; from 1\r\nto 3 borne on a short peduncle. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed; corolla\r\nbutterfly-shaped, consisting of very large, erect standard petal,\r\nnotched at rounded apex; 2 oblong, curved wings, and shorter,\r\nacute keel; 10 stamens; style incurved, and hairy along inner\r\nside. Stem: Smooth, ascending or partly twining, 1 to 3 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Compounded of 3 oblong leaflets, paler beneath, each on\r\nshort stalk. Fruit: A few-seeded, acutely pointed pod about 1 in.\r\nlong.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - New Jersey to Florida, westward to Missouri,\r\nTexas, and Mexico.\r\n\r\nA beautiful blossom, flaunting a large banner out of all\r\nproportion to the size of its other parts, that it may arrest the\r\nattention of its benefactors the bees. According to Henderson,\r\nthe plant, which is found in our Southern States and over the\r\nMexican border, grows also in the Khasia Mountains of India, but\r\nin no intervening place. Several members of the tropic-loving\r\ngenus, that produce large, highly colored flowers, have been\r\nintroduced to American hothouses; but the blue butterfly pea is\r\nour only native representative. The genus is thought to take its\r\nname from kleio, to shut up, in reference to the habit these peas\r\nhave of seeding long before the flower drops off.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD or HOG PEANUT\r\n  (Falcata comosa; Amphicarpaea monoica of Gray)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Numerous small, showy ones, borne in drooping clusters\r\nfrom axils of upper leaves; lilac, pale purplish, or rarely\r\nwhite, butterfly-shaped, consisting of standard petal partly\r\nenfolding wings and keel. Calyx tubular, 4 or 5 toothed; 10\r\nstamens (9 and 1); 1 pistil. (Also solitary fertile flowers,\r\nlacking petals, on thread-like, creeping branches from lower\r\naxils or underground). Stem: Twining wiry brownish-hairy, to 8\r\nft. long. Leaves: Compounded of 3 thin leaflets, egg-shaped at\r\nbase, acutely pointed at tip. Fruit: Hairy pod 1 in. long. Also\r\n1-seeded, pale, rounded, underground peanut.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist thickets, shady roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick westward to Nebraska, south to Gulf\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nAmphicarpaea (\"seed at both ends\"), the Greek name by which this\r\ngraceful vine was formerly known, emphasizes its most interesting\r\nfeature, that, nevertheless, seems to many a foolish duplication\r\nof energy on Nature's part. Why should the same plant bear two\r\nkinds of blossoms and seeds? Among the foliage of low shrubbery\r\nand plants in shady lanes and woodside thickets, we see the\r\ndelicate, drooping clusters of lilac blossoms hanging where bees\r\ncan readily discover them and, in pilfering their sweets,\r\ntransfer their pollen from flower to flower. But in case of\r\nfailure to intercross these blossoms that are dependent upon\r\ninsect help to set fertile seed, what then? Must the plant run\r\nthe risk of extinction? Self-fertilization may be an evil, but\r\nfailure to produce seed at all is surely the greatest one. To\r\nguard against such a calamity, insignificant looking flowers that\r\nhave no petals to open for the enticing of insects, but which\r\nfertilize themselves with their own pollen, produce abundant seed\r\nclose to the ground or under it.Then what need of the showy\r\nblossoms hanging in the thicket above? Close inbreeding in the\r\nvegetable world, as in the animal, ultimately produces degenerate\r\noffspring; and although the showy lilac blossoms of the wild\r\npeanut yield comparatively few cross-fertilized seeds, these are\r\nquite sufficient to enable the vine to maintain those desired\r\nfeatures which are the inheritance from ancestors that struggled\r\nin their day and generation after perfection. No plant dares\r\ndepend upon its cleistogamous or blind flowers alone for\r\noffspring; and in the sixty or more genera containing these\r\ncurious growths, that usually look like buds arrested in\r\ndevelopment, every plant that bears them bears also showy flowers\r\ndependent upon cross-pollination by insect aid.\r\n\r\nThe boy who\r\n\r\n    \"Drives home the cows from the pasture\r\n     Up through the long shady lane\"\r\n\r\nknows how reluctantly they leave the feast afforded by the wild\r\npeanut. Hogs, rooting about in the moist soil where it grows,\r\nunearth the hairy pods that should produce next year's vines;\r\nhence the poor excuse for branding a charming plant with a\r\nrepellent folk-name,\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLETS\r\n  (Viola)  Violet family\r\n\r\nLacking perfume only to be a perfectly satisfying flower, the\r\nCOMMON, PURPLE, MEADOW, or HOODED BLUE VIOLET (V. obliqua; V.\r\ncucullata of Gray) has nevertheless established itself in the\r\nhearts of the people from the Arctic to the Gulf as no\r\nsweet-scented, showy, hothouse exotic has ever done. Royal in\r\ncolor as in lavish profusion, it blossoms everywhere - in woods,\r\nwaysides, meadows, and marshes, but always in finer form in cool,\r\nshady dells; with longer flowering scapes in meadow bogs; and\r\nwith longer leaves than wide in swampy woodlands. The\r\nheart-shaped, saw-edged leaves, folded toward the center when\r\nnewly put forth, and the five-petalled, bluish-purple,\r\ngolden-hearted blossom are too familiar for more detailed\r\ndescription. From the three-cornered stars of the elastic\r\ncapsules, the seeds are scattered abroad.\r\n\r\nBeards on the spurred lower petal and the two side petals give\r\nthe bees a foothold when they turn head downward, as some must,\r\nto suck nectar. This attitude enables them to receive the pollen\r\ndusted on their abdomens, when they jar the flower, at a point\r\nnearest their pollen-collecting hairs. It is also an economical\r\nadvantage to the flower which can sift the pollen downward on the\r\nbee instead of exposing it to the pollen-eating interlopers.\r\nAmong the latter may be classed the bumblebees and butterflies\r\nwhose long lips and tongues pilfer ad libitum. \"For the proper\r\nvisitors of the bearded violets,\" says Professor Robertson, \"we\r\nmust look to the small bees, among which the Osmias are the most\r\nimportant.\"\r\n\r\nWhen science was younger and hair splitting an uncommon\r\nindulgence of botanists, the EARLY BLUE VIOLET (Viola palmata)\r\nwas thought to be simply a variety of the common purple violet,\r\nwhose heart-shaped leaves frequently show a tendency to divide\r\ninto lobes. But the early blue violet, however roundish or\r\nheart-shaped its early leaves may be, has the later ones\r\nvariously divided into from three to thirteen lobes, often almost\r\nas much cut on the sides as the leaves of the bird's-foot violet.\r\nIn dry soil, chiefly in the woods, this violet may be found from\r\nSouthern Canada westward to Minnesota, and south to northern\r\nboundaries of the Gulf States. Only its side petals are bearded\r\nto form footrests for the insects that search for the deeply\r\nsecreted nectar. Many butterflies visit this flower. On entering\r\nit a bee must first touch the stigma before any fresh golden\r\npollen is released from the anther cone, and cross-fertilization\r\nnaturally results.\r\n\r\nIn shale and sandy soil, even in the gravel of hillsides, one\r\nfinds the narrowly divided, finely cut leaves and the bicolored\r\nbeardless blossom of the BIRD'S-FOOT VIOLET (V. pedata), pale\r\nbluish purple on the lower petals, dark purple on one or two\r\nupper ones, and with a heart of gold. The large, velvety,\r\npansy-like blossom and the unusual foliage which rises in rather\r\ndense tufts are sufficient to distinguish the plant from its\r\nnumerous kin. This species produces no cleistogamous or blind\r\nflowers. Frequently the bird's-foot violet blooms a second time,\r\nin autumn, a delightful eccentricity of this family. The spur of\r\nits lower petal is long and very slender, and, as might be\r\nexpected, the longest-tongued bees and butterflies are its most\r\nfrequent visitors. These receive the pollen on the base of the\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe WOOLLY BLUE VIOLET (V. sororia), whose stems and younger\r\nleaves, at least, are covered with hairs, and whose purplish-blue\r\nflowers are more or less bearded within, prefers a shady but dry\r\nsituation; whereas its next of kin, the ARROW-LEAVED VIOLET (V.\r\nsagittata), delights in moist but open meadows and marshes. The\r\nlatter's long, arrow, or halberd-shaped leaves, usually entire\r\nabove the middle, but slightly lobed below it, may rear\r\nthemselves nine inches high in favorable soil, or in dry uplands\r\nperhaps only two inches. The flowering scapes grow as tall as the\r\nleaves. All but the lower petal of the large, deep, dark,\r\npurplish-blue flower are bearded. This species produces an\r\nabundance of late cleistogamous flowers on erect stems. These\r\npeculiar greenish flowers without petals, that are so often\r\nmistaken for buds or seed vessels; that never open, but without\r\ninsect aid ripen quantities of fertile seed, are usually borne,\r\nif not actually under ground, then not far above it, on nearly\r\nall violet plants. It will be observed that all species which\r\nbear blind flowers rely somewhat on showy, cross-fertilized\r\nblossoms also to counteract degeneracy from close inbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe OVATE-LEAVED VIOLET (V. ovata), formerly reckoned as a mere\r\nvariety of the former species, is now accorded a distinct rank.\r\nNot all the blossoms, but an occasional clump, has a faint\r\nperfume like sweet clover. The leaf is elongated, but rather too\r\nround to be halberd-shaped; the stems are hairy; and the flowers,\r\nwhich closely resemble those of the arrow-leaved violet, are\r\nearlier; making these two species, which are popularly mistaken\r\nfor one, among the earliest and commonest of their clan. The dry\r\nsoil of upland woods and thickets is the ovate-leaved violet's\r\npreferred habitat.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the lovely ENGLISH, MARCH, or SWEET VIOLET, (V.\r\nodorata), which has escaped from gardens, and which is now\r\nrapidly increasing with the help of seed and runners on the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific coasts, may be established among our\r\nwild flowers. No blossom figures so prominently in European\r\nliterature. In France, it has even entered the political field\r\nsince Napoleon's day. Yale University has adopted the violet for\r\nits own especial flower, although it is the corn-flower, or\r\nbachelor's button (Centaurea cyanus) that is the true Yale blue.\r\nSprengel, who made a most elaborate study of the violet,\r\ncondensed the result of his research into the following questions\r\nand answers, which are given here because much that he says\r\napplies to our own native species, which have been too little\r\nstudied in the modern scientific spirit:\r\n\r\n\"1. Why is the flower situated on a long stalk which is upright,\r\nbut curved downwards at the free end? In order that it may hang\r\ndown; which, firstly, prevents rain from obtaining access to the\r\nnectar; and, secondly, places the stamens in such a position that\r\nthe pollen falls into the open space between the pistil and the\r\nfree ends of the stamens. If the flower were upright, the pollen\r\nwould fall into the space between the base of the stamen and the\r\nbase of the pistil, and would not come in contact with the bee.\r\n\r\n\"2. Why does the pollen differ from that of most other\r\ninsect-fertilized flowers? In most of such flowers the insects\r\nthemselves remove the pollen from the anthers, and it is\r\ntherefore important that the pollen should not easily be detached\r\nand carried away by the wind. In the present case, on the\r\ncontrary, it is desirable that it should be looser and dryer, so\r\nthat it may easily fall into the space between the stamens and\r\nthe pistil. If it remained attached to the anther, it would not\r\nbe touched by the bee, and the flower would remain unfertilized.\r\n\r\n\"3. Why is the base of the style so thin? In order that the bee\r\nmay be more easily able to bend the style.\r\n\r\n\"4. Why is the base of the style bent? For the same reason. The\r\nresult of the curvature is that the pistil is much more easily\r\nbent than would be the case if the style were straight.\r\n\r\n\"5. Finally, why does the membranous termination of the upper\r\nfilament overlap the corresponding portions of the two middle\r\nstamens? Because this enables the bee to move the pistil, and\r\nthereby to set free the pollen more easily than would be the case\r\nunder the reverse arrangement.\"\r\n\r\nIn high altitudes of New England, Colorado. and northward, where\r\nthe soil is wet and cold, the pale lilac, slightly bearded\r\npetals, streaked with darker veins, of the MARSH VIOLET (V.\r\npalustris), with its almost round leaves, may be found from May\r\nto June. All through the White Mountains one finds it abundant.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the DOG or RUNNING VIOLET (V. Labradorica) is\r\nthat its small, heart-shaped leaves are set along the branching\r\nstem, and its pale purple blossoms rise from their angles, pansy\r\nfashion. From March to May it blooms throughout its wide range in\r\nwet, shady places. Its English prototype, called by the same\r\ninvidious name, was given the prefix \"dog,\" because the word,\r\nwhich is always intended to express contempt in the British mind,\r\nis applied in this case for the flower's lack of fragrance. When\r\na bee visits this violet, his head coming in contact with the\r\nstigma jars it, thus opening the little pollen box, whose\r\ncontents must fall out on his head and be carried away and rubbed\r\noff where it will fertilize the next violet visited.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA LAVENDER; MARSH ROSEMARY; CANKER-ROOT; INK-ROOT\r\n  (Limonium Carolinianum; Statice Limonium of Gray)  Plumbago\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very tiny, pale, dull lavender, erect, set along upper\r\nside of branches. Calyx 5-toothed, tubular, plaited; corolla of 5\r\npetals opposite as many stamens; 1 pistil with 5 thread-like\r\nstyles. Scape: 1 to 2 ft. high, slender, leafless, much branched\r\nabove. Leaves: All from thick, fleshy rootstock, narrowly oblong,\r\ntapering into margined petioles, thick, the edges slightly waved,\r\nnot toothed; midrib prominent.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Salt meadows and marshes.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution  -  Atlantic coast from Labrador to Florida,\r\nwestward along the Gulf to Texas; also in Europe.\r\n\r\nSeen in masses, from a little distance, this tiny flower looks\r\nlike blue-gray mist blown in over the meadows from the sea, and\r\non closer view each plant suggests sea-spray itself. Thrifty\r\nhousewives along the coast dry it for winter bouquets, partly for\r\nornament and partly because there is an old wives' tradition that\r\nit keeps away moths. Statice, from the Greek verb to stop, hence\r\nan astringent, was the generic name formerly applied to the\r\nplants, with whose roots these same old women believed they cured\r\ncanker sores.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRINGED GENTIAN\r\n  (Gentiana crinita)  Gentian family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Deep, bright blue, rarely white, several or many, about\r\n2 in. high, stiffly erect, and solitary at ends of very long\r\nfoot-stalk. Calyx of 4 unequal, acutely pointed lobes. Corolla\r\nfunnel form, its four lobes spreading, rounded, fringed around\r\nends, but scarcely on sides. Four stamens inserted on corolla\r\ntube; 1 pistil with 2 stigmas. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, usually\r\nbranched, leafy. Leaves: Opposite, upper ones acute at tip,\r\nbroadening to heart-shaped base, seated on stem. Fruit: A\r\nspindle-shaped, 2-valved capsule, containing numerous scaly,\r\nhairy seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low, moist meadows and woods.\r\nFlowering Season - September-November.\r\nDistribution - Quebec, southward to Georgia, and westward beyond\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\n    \"Thou waitest late, and com'st alone\r\n     When woods are bare and birds have flown,\r\n     And frosts and shortening days portend\r\n     The aged year is near his end.\r\n\r\n    \"Then doth thy sweet and quiet eye\r\n     Look through its fringes to the sky,\r\n     Blue - blue - as if that sky let fail\r\n     A flower from its cerulean wall.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we come upon a bed of gentians on some sparkling October\r\nday, we can but repeat Bryant's thoughts and express them\r\nprosaically who attempt description. In dark weather this\r\nsunshine lover remains shut, to protect its nectar and pollen\r\nfrom possible showers. An elusive plant is this gentian, which by\r\nno means always reappears in the same places year after year, for\r\nit is an annual whose seeds alone perpetuate it. Seating\r\nthemselves on the winds when autumn gales shake them from out of\r\nthe home wall, these little hairy scales ride afar, and those\r\nthat are so fortunate as to strike into soft, moist soil at the\r\nend of the journey, germinate. Because this flower is so rarely\r\nbeautiful that few can resist the temptation of picking it, it is\r\nbecoming sadly rare near large settlements.\r\n\r\nThe special importance of producing a quantity of fertile seed\r\nhas led the gentians to adopt proterandry - one of the commonest,\r\nbecause most successful, methods of insuring it. The anthers,\r\ncoming to maturity early, shed their pollen on the bumblebees\r\nthat have been first attracted by their favorite color and the\r\nenticing fringes before they crawl half way down the tube where\r\nthey can reach the nectar secreted in the walls. After the pollen\r\nhas been carried from the early flowers, and the stamens begin to\r\nwither, up rises the pistil to be fertilized with pollen brought\r\nfrom a newly opened blossom by the bee or butterfly. The late\r\ndevelopment of the pistil accounts for the error often stated,\r\nthat some gentians have none. No doubt the fringe, which most\r\nscientists regard simply as an additional attraction for winged\r\ninsects, serves a double purpose in entangling the feet of ants\r\nand other crawlers that would climb over the edge to pilfer\r\nsweets clearly intended for the bumblebee alone.\r\n\r\nFifteen species of gentian have been gathered during a half-hour\r\nwalk in Switzerland, where the pastures are spread with sheets of\r\nblue. Indeed, one can little realize the beauty of these heavenly\r\nflowers who has not seen them among the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe FIVE-FLOWERED or STIFF GENTIAN, or AGUE-WEED (Gentiana\r\nquinquefolia; G. quinqueflora of Gray) has its five-parted,\r\nsmall, picotee-edged blue flowers arranged in clusters, not\r\nexceeding seven, at the ends of the branches or seated in the\r\nleaf-axils. The slender, branching, ridged stem may rise only two\r\ninches in dry soil; or perhaps two feet in rich, moist, rocky\r\nground, where it grows to perfection, especially in mountainous\r\nregions. From Canada to Florida and westward to Missouri is its\r\nrange, and beginning to bloom in August southward, it may not be\r\nfound until September in the Catskills, and in October it is\r\nstill in its glory in Ontario. The colorless, bitter juice of\r\nmany of the gentian tribe has long been valued as a tonic in\r\nmedicine. Evidently the butterflies that pilfer this \"ague-weed,\"\r\nand the bees that are its legitimate feasters, find something\r\nmore delectable in its blue walls.\r\n\r\nA deep, intense blue is the CLOSED, BLIND, or BOTTLE GENTIAN (G.\r\nAndrewsii), more truly the color of the \"male bluebird's back,\"\r\nto which Thoreau likened the paler fringed gentian. Rarely some\r\ndegenerate plant bears white flowers. As it is a perennial, we\r\nare likely to find it in its old haunts year after year;\r\nnevertheless its winged seeds sail far abroad to seek pastures\r\nnew. This gentian also shows a preference for moist soil. Gray\r\nthought that it expanded slightly, and for a short time only in\r\nsunshine, but added that, although it is proterandrous, i.e. it\r\nmatures and sheds its pollen before its stigma is susceptible to\r\nany, he believed it finally fertilized itself by the lobes of the\r\nstigma curling backward until they touched the anthers. But Gray\r\nwas doubtless mistaken. Several authorities have recently proved\r\nthat the flower is adapted to bumblebees. It offers them the last\r\nfeast of the season, for although it comes into bloom in August\r\nsouthward, farther northward - and it extends from Quebec to the\r\nNorthwest Territory - it lasts through October.\r\n\r\nNow, how can a bumblebee enter this inhospitable-looking flower?\r\nIf he did but know it, it keeps closed for his special benefit,\r\nhaving no fringes or hairs to entangle the feet of crawling\r\npilferers, and no better way of protecting its nectar from rain\r\nand marauding butterflies that are not adapted to its needs. But\r\nhe is a powerful fellow. Watch him alight on a cluster of\r\nblossoms, select the younger, nectar-bearing ones, that are\r\ndistinctly marked white against a light-blue background at the\r\nmouth of the corolla for his special guidance. Old flowers from\r\nwhich the nectar has been removed turn deep reddish purple, and\r\nthe white pathfinders become indistinct. With some difficulty, it\r\nis true, the bumblebee (B. Americanorum) thrusts his tongue\r\nthrough the valve of the chosen flower where the five plaited\r\nlobes overlap one another; then he pushes with all his might\r\nuntil his head having passed the entrance most of his body\r\nfollows, leaving only his hind legs and the tip of his abdomen\r\nsticking out as he makes the circuit. He has much sense as well\r\nas muscle, and does not risk imprisonment in what must prove a\r\ntomb by a total and unnecessary disappearance within the bottle.\r\nPresently he backs out, brushes the pollen from his head and\r\nthorax into his baskets, and is off to fertilize an older,\r\nstigmatic flower with the few grains of quickening dust that must\r\nremain on his velvety head.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD BLUE PHLOX\r\n  (Phlox divaricata)  Phlox family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale lilac blue, slightly fragrant, borne on sticky\r\npedicels, in loose, spreading clusters. Calyx with 5 long, sharp\r\nteeth. Corolla of 5 flat lobes, indented like the top of a heart,\r\nand united into a slender tube; 5 unequal, straight, short\r\nstamens in corolla tube; 1 pistil with 3 stigmas. Stem: to 2 ft.\r\nhigh, finely coated with sticky hairs above, erect or spreading,\r\nand producing leafy shoots from base. Leaves: Of flowering stem -\r\nopposite, oblong, tapering to a point; of sterile shoots - oblong\r\nor egg-shaped, not pointed, 1 to 2 in. long.\r\nPreferred habitat - Moist, rocky woods.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Eastern Canada to Florida, Minnesota to Arkansas.\r\n\r\nThe merest novice can have no difficulty in naming the flower\r\nwhose wild and cultivated relations abound throughout North\r\nAmerica, the almost exclusive home of the genus, although it is\r\nto European horticulturists, as usual the first to see the\r\npossibilities in our native flowers, that we owe the gay hybrids\r\nin our gardens. Mr. Drummond, a collector from the Botanical\r\nSociety of Glasgow, early in the thirties sent home the seeds of\r\na species from Texas, which became the ancestor of the gorgeous\r\nannuals, the Drummond phloxes of commerce today; and although he\r\ndied of fever in Cuba before the plants became generally known,\r\nnot even his kinsman, the author of \"Natural Law in the Spiritual\r\nWorld,\" has done more to immortalize the family name.\r\n\r\nWhile the wild blue phlox is sometimes cultivated, it is the\r\nGARDEN PHLOX (P. paniculata), common in woods and thickets from\r\nPennsylvania to Illinois and southward, that under a gardener's\r\ncare bears the large terminal clusters of purple, magenta,\r\ncrimson, pink, and white flowers abundant in old-fashioned, hardy\r\nborders. From these it has escaped so freely in many sections of\r\nthe North and East as to be counted among the local wildflowers.\r\nUnless the young offshoots are separated from the parent and\r\ngiven a nook of their own, the flower quickly reverts to the\r\noriginal type. European cultivators claim that the most brilliant\r\ncolors are obtained by crossing annual with perennial phloxes.\r\n\r\nWILD SWEET WILLIAM (P. maculata), another perennial much sought\r\nby cultivators, loves the moisture of low woods and the\r\nneighborhood of streams in the Middle and Western States when it\r\nis free to choose its habitat; but it, too, has so freely escaped\r\nfrom gardens farther north into dry and dusty roadsides, that\r\nanyone who has passed the ruins of Hawthorne's little red cottage\r\nat Lenox, for example, and seen the way his wife's clump of white\r\nphlox under his study window has spread to cover an acre of\r\nhillside, would suppose it to be luxuriating in its favorite\r\nlocality. This variety of the species (var. Candida) lacks the\r\npurplish flecks on stem and lower leaves responsible for the\r\nspecific name of the type. Pinkish purple or pink blossoms are\r\nborne in a rather narrow, elongated panicle on the typical Sweet\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nMost members of the phlox family resort to the trick of coating\r\nthe upper stem and the peduncles immediately below the flowers\r\nwith a sticky secretion in which crawling insects, intent on\r\npilfering sweets, meet their death, just as birds are caught on\r\nlimed twigs. Butterflies, for whom phloxes have narrowed their\r\ntubes to the exclusion of most other insects, are their\r\nbenefactors; but long-tongued bees and flies often seek their\r\nnectar. Indeed, the number of strictly butterfly-flowers is\r\nsurprisingly small.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA COWSLIP; TREE or SMOOTH LUNGWORT; BLUE-BELLS\r\n  (Mertensia Virginica)  Borage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pinkish in bud, afterward purplish blue, fading to\r\nlight blue; about 1 in. long, tubular, funnel form, the tube of\r\ncorolla not crested; spreading or hanging on slender pedicels in\r\nshowy, loose clusters at end of smooth stem from 1 to 2 ft. high;\r\nstamens 5, inserted on corolla; 1 pistil; ovary of 4 divisions.\r\nLeaves: Large, entire, alternate, veiny, oblong or obovate, the\r\nupper ones seated on stem; lower very large ones diminishing\r\ntoward base into long petioles; at first rich, dark purple,\r\nafterward pale bluish gray. Fruit: 4 seed-like little nuts,\r\nleathery, wrinkled when mature.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Alluvial ground, low meadows, and along\r\nstreams.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Southern Canada to South Carolina and Kansas, west\r\nto Nebraska; most abundant in middle West.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by its cousins the heliotrope and the\r\nforget-me-not, this lovely and far more showy spring flower has\r\nfound its way into the rockwork and sheltered, moist nooks of\r\nmany gardens, especially in England, where Mr. W. Robinson, who\r\nhas appealed for its wider cultivation in that perennially\r\ncharming book, \"The English Flower Garden,\" says of the\r\nMertensias: \"There is something about them more beautiful in form\r\nof foliage and stem, and in the graceful way in which they rise\r\nto panicles of blue, than in almost any other family....\r\nHandsomest of all is the Virginia cowslip.\" And yet Robinson\r\nnever saw the alluvial meadows in the Ohio Valley blued with\r\nlovely masses of the plant in April.\r\n\r\nA great variety of insects visit this blossom, which, being\r\ntubular, conducts them straight to the ample feast; but not until\r\nthey have deposited some pollen brought from another flower on\r\nthe stigma in their way. The anthers are too widely separated\r\nfrom the stigma to make self-fertilization likely. Occasionally\r\none finds the cowslips perforated by clever bumblebees. As only\r\nthe females, which are able to sip far deeper cups, are flying\r\nwhen they bloom, they must be either too mischievous or too lazy\r\nto drain them in the legitimate manner. Butterflies have only to\r\nstand on a flower, not to enter it, in order to sip nectar from\r\nthe four glands that secrete it abundantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGET-ME-NOT; MOUSE-EAR; SCORPION GRASS; SNAKE GRASS; LOVE ME\r\n  (Myosotis Palustris)  Borage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pure blue, pinkish, or white, with yellow eye; flat,\r\n5-lobed, borne in many-flowered, long, often 1-sided racemes.\r\nCalyx 5-cleft; the lobes narrow, spreading, erect, and open in\r\nfruit; 5 stamens inserted on corolla tube; style threadlike;\r\novary 4-celled. Stem: Low, branching, leafy, slender, hairy,\r\npartially reclining. Leaves: (Myosotis = mouse-ear) oblong,\r\nalternate, seated on stem, hairy. Fruit: Nutlets, angled and\r\nkeeled on inner side.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Escaped from gardens to brooksides, marshes,\r\nand low meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Native of Europe and Asia, now rapidly spreading\r\nfrom Nova Scotia southward to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nHow rare a color blue must have been originally among our flora\r\nis evident from the majority of blue and purple flowers that,\r\nalthough now abundant here and so perfectly at home, are really\r\nquite recent immigrants from Europe and Asia. But our dryer,\r\nhotter climate never brings to the perfection attained in England\r\n\r\n    \"The sweet forget-me-nots\r\n     That grow for happy lovers.\"\r\n\r\nTennyson thus ignores the melancholy association of the flower in\r\nthe popular legend which tells how a lover, when trying to gather\r\nsome of these blossoms for his sweetheart, fell into a deep pool,\r\nand threw a bunch on the bank, calling out, as he sank forever\r\nfrom her sight, \"Forget me not.\" Another dismal myth sends its\r\nhero forth seeking hidden treasure caves in a mountain, under the\r\nguidance of a fairy. He fills his pockets with gold, but not\r\nheeding the fairy's warning to \"forget not the best\" - i.e., the\r\nmyosotis - he is crushed by the closing together of the mountain.\r\nHappiest of all is the folk-tale of the Persians; as told by\r\ntheir poet Shiraz: \"It was in the golden morning of the early\r\nworld, when an angel sat weeping outside the closed gates of\r\nParadise. He had fallen from his high estate through loving a\r\ndaughter of earth, nor was he permitted to enter again until she\r\nwhom he loved had planted the flowers of the forget-me-not in\r\nevery corner of the world. He returned to earth and assisted her,\r\nand together they went hand in hand. When their task was ended,\r\nthey entered Paradise together, for the fair woman, without\r\ntasting the bitterness of death, became immortal like the angel\r\nwhose love her beauty had won when she sat by the river twining\r\nforget-me-nots in her hair.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the golden ring around the forget-me-not's center that\r\nfirst led Sprengel to believe the conspicuous markings at the\r\nentrance of many flowers served as pathfinders to insects. This\r\ngolden circle also shelters the nectar from rain, and indicates\r\nto the fly or bee just where it must probe between stigma and\r\nanthers to touch them with opposite sides of its tongue. Since it\r\nmay probe from any point of the circle, it is quite likely that\r\nthe side of the tongue that touched a pollen-laden anther in one\r\nflower will touch the stigma in the next one visited, and so\r\ncross-fertilize it. But forget-me-nots are not wholly dependent\r\non insects. When these fail, a fully mature flower is still able\r\nto set fertile seed by shedding its own pollen directly on the\r\nstigma.\r\n\r\nThe SMALLER FORGET-ME-NOT (M. laxa), formerly accounted a mere\r\nvariety of palustris, but now defined as a distinct species, is a\r\nnative, and therefore may serve to show how its European relative\r\nhere will deteriorate in the dryer atmosphere of the New World.\r\nIts tiny turquoise flowers, borne on long stems from a very loose\r\nraceme, gleam above wet, muddy places from Newfoundland and\r\nEastern Canada to Virginia and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nEven smaller still are the blue or white flowers of the FIELD\r\nFORGET-ME-NOT, SCORPION GRASS, or MOUSE-EAR (M. arvenis), whose\r\nstems and leaves are covered with bristly hairs. It blooms from\r\nAugust to July in dry places, even on hillsides, an unusual\r\nlocality in which to find a member of this moisture-loving clan.\r\nAll the flowers remain long in bloom, continually forming new\r\nbuds on a lengthening stem, and leaving behind little empty green\r\ncalices.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIPER'S BUGLOSS; BLUE-WEED; VIPER'S HERB or GRASS; SNAKE-FLOWER;\r\nBLUE-THISTLE\r\n  (Echium vulgare)  Borage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright blue, afterward reddish purple, pink in the bud,\r\nnumerous, clustered on short, 1-sided, curved spikes rolled up at\r\nfirst, and straightening out as flowers expand. Calyx deeply\r\n5-cleft; corolla 1 in. long or less, funnel form, the 5 lobes\r\nunequal, acute; 5 stamens inserted on corolla tube, the filaments\r\nspreading below, and united above into slender appendage, the\r\nanthers forming a cone. 1 pistil with 2 stigmas. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2\r\nft. high; bristly-hairy, erect, spotted. Leaves: Hairy, rough,\r\noblong to lance-shaped, alternate, seated on stem, except at base\r\nof plant.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, waste places; roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Virginia, westward to Nebraska;\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\nIn England, from whose gardens this plant escaped long ago, a war\r\nof extermination that has been waged against the vigorous,\r\nbeautiful weed by the farmers has at last driven it to the\r\nextremity of the island, where a few stragglers about Penzance\r\ntestify to the vanquishing of what must once have been a mighty\r\narmy. From England a few refugees reached here in i683, no one\r\nknows how; but they proved to be the vanguard of an aggressive\r\nand victorious host that quickly overran our open, hospitable\r\ncountry, as if to give vent to revenge for long years of\r\npersecution at the hands of Europeans. \"It is a fact that all our\r\nmore pernicious weeds, like our vermin, are of Old-World origin,\"\r\nsays.John Burroughs. \"...Perhaps the most notable thing about\r\nthem, when compared with our native species, is their\r\npersistence, not to say pugnacity. They fight for the soil; they\r\nplant colonies here and there, and will not be rooted out. Our\r\nnative weeds are for the most part shy and harmless, and retreat\r\nbefore civilization.... We have hardly a weed we can call our\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nYears ago, when simple folk believed God had marked plants with\r\nsome sign to indicate the special use for which each was\r\nintended, they regarded the spotted stem of the bugloss, and its\r\nseeds shaped like a serpent's head, as certain indications that\r\nthe herb would cure snake bites. Indeed, the genus takes its name\r\nfrom Echis, the Greek for viper.\r\n\r\nBecause it is showy and offers accessible nectar, a great variety\r\nof insects visit the blue-weed; Muller alone observed sixty-seven\r\nspecies about it. We need no longer wonder at its fertility. Of\r\nthe five stamens one remains in the tube, while the other four\r\nproject and form a convenient alighting place for visitors, which\r\nnecessarily dust their under sides with pollen as they enter; for\r\nthe red anthers were already ripe when the flower opened. Then,\r\nhowever, the short, immature pistil was kept below. After the\r\nstamens have shed their pollen and there can be no longer danger\r\nof self-fertilization, it gradually elongates itself beyond the\r\npoint occupied by them, and divides into two little horns whose\r\nstigmatic surfaces an incoming pollen-laden insect cannot well\r\nfail to strike against. Cross-pollination is so thoroughly\r\nsecured in this case that the plant has completely lost the power\r\nof fertilizing itself. Unwelcome visitors like ants, which would\r\npilfer nectar without rendering any useful service in return, are\r\nwarded off by the bristly, hairy foliage. Several kinds of female\r\nbees seek the bugloss exclusively for food for their larvae as\r\nwell as for themselves, sweeping up the abundant pollen with\r\ntheir abdominal brushes as they feast without effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE VERVAIN; WILD HYSSOP; SIMPLER'S JOY\r\n  (Verbena hastala)  Vervain family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, purplish blue, in numerous slender, erect,\r\ncompact spikes. Calyx 5-toothed; corolla tubular, unequally\r\n5-lobed; 2 pairs of stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: 3 to 7 ft. high,\r\nrough, branched above, leafy, 4-sided. Leaves: Opposite, stemmed,\r\nlance-shaped, saw-edged, rough; lower ones lobed at base.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist meadows, roadsides, waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - United States and Canada in almost every part.\r\n\r\nSeeds below, a circle of insignificant purple-blue flowers in the\r\ncenter, and buds at the top of the vervain's slender spires do\r\nnot produce a striking effect, yet this common plant certainly\r\ndoes not lack beauty. John Burroughs, ever ready to say a kindly,\r\nappreciative word for any weed, speaks of its drooping, knotted\r\nthreads, that \"make a pretty etching upon the winter snow.\" Bees,\r\nthe vervain's benefactors, are usually seen clinging to the\r\nblooming spikes, and apparently sleep on them. Borrowing the name\r\nof simpler's joy from its European sister, the flower has also\r\nappropriated much of the tradition and folk-lore centered about\r\nthat plant which herb-gatherers, or simplers, truly delighted to\r\nsee, since none was once more salable.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN VERVAIN (V. officinalis) HERB-OF-THE-CROSS, BERBINE,\r\nHOLY-HERB, ENCHANTER'S PLANT, JUNO'S TEARS, PIGEON-GRASS,\r\nLIGHTNING PLANT, SIMPLER'S JOY, and so on through a long list of\r\npopular names for the most part testifying to the plant's virtue\r\nas a love-philter, bridal token, and general cure-all, has now\r\nbecome naturalized from the Old World on the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nSlopes; and is rapidly appropriating waste arid cultivated ground\r\nuntil, in many places, it is truly troublesome. In general habit\r\nlike the blue vervain, its flowers are more purplish than blue,\r\nand are scattered, not crowded, along the spikes. The leaves are\r\ndeeply, but less acutely, cut.\r\n\r\nAges before Christians ascribed healing virtues to the vervain -\r\nfound growing on Mount Calvary, and therefore possessing every\r\nsort of miraculous power, according to the logic of simple\r\npeasant folk - the Druids had counted it among their sacred\r\nplants. \"When the dog-star arose from unsunned spots\" the priests\r\ngathered it. Did not Shakespeare's witches learn some of their\r\nuncanny rites from these reverend men of old? One is impressed\r\nwith the striking similarity of many customs recorded of both.\r\nTwo of the most frequently used ingredients in witches' cauldrons\r\nwere the vervain and the rue. \"The former probably derived its\r\nnotoriety from the fact of its being sacred to Thor, an honor\r\nwhich marked it out, like other lightning plants, as peculiarly\r\nadapted for occult uses,\" says Mr. Thiselton Dyer in his\r\n\"Folk-lore of Plants.\" \"Although vervain, therefore, as the\r\nenchanter's plant, was gathered by witches to do mischief in\r\ntheir incantations, yet, as Aubrey says, it 'hinders witches from\r\ntheir will,' a circumstance to which Drayton further refers when\r\nhe speaks of the vervain as ''gainst witchcraft much avayling.'\"\r\nNow we understand why the children of Shakespeare's time hung\r\nvervain and dill with a horseshoe over the door.\r\n\r\nIn his eighth Eclogue, Virgil refers to vervain as a charm to\r\nrecover lost love. Doubtless this was the verbena, the herba\r\nsacra employed in ancient Roman sacrifices, according to Pliny.\r\nIn his day the bridal wreath was of verbena, gathered by the\r\nbride herself.\r\n\r\nNARROW-LEAVED VERVAIN (V. angustifolia), like the blue vervain,\r\nhas a densely crowded spike of tiny purple or blue flowers that\r\nquickly give place to seeds, but usually there is only one spike\r\nat the end of a branch. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped,\r\nacute, saw-edged, rough. From Massachusetts and Florida westward\r\nto Minnesota and Arkansas one finds the plant blooming in dry\r\nfields from June to August, after the parsimonious manner of the\r\nvervain tribe.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the vervain, or verbena, employed by brides\r\nfor centuries as the emblem of chastity, should be one of the\r\nnotorious botanical examples of a willful hybrid. Generally, the\r\nindividuals of distinct species do not interbreed; but verbenas\r\nare often difficult to name correctly in every case because of\r\ntheir susceptibility to each other's pollen - the reason why the\r\ngarden verbena may so easily be made to blossom forth into\r\nwhatever hue the gardener wills. His plants have been obtained,\r\nfor the most part, from the large-flowered verbena, the beautiful\r\npurple, blue, or white species of our Western States (V.\r\nCanadensis) crossed with brilliant-hued species imported from\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAD-DOG SKULLCAP or HELMET-FLOWER; MAD-WEED; HOODWORT\r\n  (Scutellaria lateriflora)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue, varying to whitish; several or many, 1/4 in.\r\nlong, growing in axils of upper leaves or in 1-sided spike-like\r\nracemes. Calyx 2-lipped, the upper lip with a helmet-like\r\nprotuberance; corolla 2-lipped; the lower, 3-lobed lip spreading;\r\nthe middle lobe larger than the side ones. Stamens, 4, in pairs,\r\nunder the upper lip; upper pair the shorter; one pistil, the\r\nstyle unequally cleft in two. Stem: Square, smooth, leafy,\r\nbranched, 8 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite, oblong to\r\nlance-shaped, thin, toothed, on slender pedicles, 1 to 3 in.\r\nlong, growing gradually smaller toward top of stem. Fruit: 4\r\nnutlets.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet, shady ground.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Uneven throughout United States and the British\r\nPossessions.\r\n\r\nBy the helmet-like appendage on the upper lip of the calyx, which\r\nto the imaginative mind of Linnaeus suggested Scutellum (a little\r\ndish), which children delight to spring open for a view of the\r\nfour tiny seeds attached at the base when in fruit, one knows\r\nthis to be a member of the skullcap tribe, a widely scattered\r\ngenus of blue and violet two-lipped flowers, some small to the\r\npoint of insignificance, like the present species, others showy\r\nenough for the garden, but all rich in nectar, and eagerly sought\r\nby bees. The wide middle lobe of the lower lip forms a convenient\r\nplatform on which to alight; the stamens in the roof of a newly\r\nopened blossom dust the back of the visitor as he explores the\r\nnectary; and as the stamens of an older flower wither when they\r\nhave shed their pollen, and the style then rises to occupy their\r\nposition, it follows that, in flying from the top of one spike of\r\nflowers to the bottom of another, where the older ones are, the\r\nvisitor, for whom the whole scheme of color, form, and\r\narrangement was planned, deposits on the sticky top of the style\r\nsome of the pollen he has brought with him and so\r\ncross-fertilizes the flower. When the seeds begin to form and the\r\nnow useless corolla drops off, the helmet-like appendage on the\r\ntop of the calyx enlarges and meets the lower lip, so enclosing\r\nand protecting the tiny nutlets. After their maturity, either the\r\nmouth gapes from dryness, or the appendage drops off altogether,\r\nfrom the same cause, to release the seeds. Old herb doctors, who\r\nprofessed to cure hydrophobia with this species, are responsible\r\nfor its English misnomer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most beautiful member of the genus is the SHOWY\r\nSKULLCAP (S. serrata), whose blue corolla, an inch long, has its\r\nnarrow upper lip shorter than the spreading lower one. The\r\nflowers are set opposite each other at the end of the smooth\r\nstem, which rises from one to two feet high in the woods\r\nthroughout a southerly and westerly range. As several other\r\nskullcaps have distinctly saw-edged leaves, this plant might have\r\nbeen given a more distinctive adjective, thinks one who did not\r\nhave the naming of 200,000 species!\r\n\r\nAbove dry, sandy soil from New York and Michigan southward the\r\nHAIRY SKULLCAP (S. pilosa) lifts short racemes of blue flowers\r\nthat are only half an inch long, and whose lower lip and lobes at\r\neither side are shorter than the arched upper lip. Most parts of\r\nthe plant are covered with down, the lower stem being especially\r\nhairy; and this fact determines the species when connected with\r\nits rather distant pairs of indented, veiny leaves, ranging from\r\noblong to egg-shaped, and furnished with petioles which grow\r\ngradually shorter toward the top, where pairs of bracts, seated\r\non the stem, part to let the flowers spring from their axils.\r\n\r\nThe LARGER or HYSSOP SKULLCAP (S. integrifolia) rarely has a dent\r\nin its rounded oblong leaves ,which, like the stem, are covered\r\nwith fine down. Its lovely, bright blue flowers, an inch long,\r\nthe lips of about equal length, are grouped opposite each other\r\nat the top of a stem that never lifts them higher than two feet;\r\nand so their beauty is often concealed in the tall grass of\r\nroadsides and meadows and the undergrowth of woods and thickets,\r\nwhere they bloom from May to August, from southern New England to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, westward to Texas.\r\n\r\nThis tribe of plants is almost exclusively North American, but\r\nthe hardy MARSH SKULLCAP or HOODED WILLOW-HERB (S. galericulata),\r\nat least, roams over Europe, and Asia also, with the help of\r\nrunners, as well as seeds that, sinking into the soft earth of\r\nswamps and the borders of brooks, find growth easy. The blue\r\nflowers which grow singly in the axils of the upper leaves are\r\nquite as long as those of the larger and the showy skullcaps; the\r\noblong, lance-shaped leaves, which are mostly seated on the\r\nbranching stem, opposite each other, have low teeth. Why do\r\nleaves vary as they do, especially in closely allied species?\r\n\"The causes which have led to the different forms of leaves have\r\nbeen, so far as I know,\" says Sir John Lubbock, \"explained in\r\nvery few cases: those of the shapes and structure of seeds are\r\ntolerably obvious in some species, but in the majority they are\r\nstill entirely unexplained; and, even as regards the blossoms\r\nthemselves, in spite of the numerous and conscientious labors of\r\nso many eminent naturalists, there is as yet no single species\r\nthoroughly known to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND IVY or JOY; GILL-OVER-THE-GROUND; FIELD BALM; CREEPING\r\nCHARLIE\r\n  (Glecoma hederacea; Nepeta Glechoma of Gray)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light bluish purple, dotted with small specks of\r\nreddish violet; growing singly or in clusters along stem, seated\r\nin leaf axils; calyx hairy, with 5 sharp teeth; corolla tubular,\r\nover 1/2 in. long, 2-lipped, the upper lip 2-lobed, lower lip\r\nwith 3 spreading lobes, middle one largest; 4 stamens in pairs\r\nunder upper lip; the anther sacs spreading; pistil with 2-lobed\r\nstyle. Stem: Trailing, rooting at intervals, sometimes 18 in.\r\nlong, leafy, the branches ascending. Leaves: From 1/2 to 1 1/2\r\nin. across; smooth, rounded, kidney-shaped, scallop-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places, shady ground.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Eastern half of Canada and the United States, from\r\nGeorgia and Kansas northward.\r\n\r\nBesides the larger flowers, containing both stamens and pistils,\r\nborne on this little immigrant, smaller female flowers,\r\ncontaining a pistil only, occur just as they do in thyme, mint,\r\nmarjoram, and doubtless other members of the great family to\r\nwhich all belong. Muller attempted to prove that these small\r\nflowers, being the least showy, are the last to be visited by\r\ninsects, which, having previously dusted themselves with pollen\r\nfrom the stamens of the larger flowers when they first open, are\r\nin a condition to make cross-fertilization certain. So much for\r\nthe small flower's method of making insects serve its end; the\r\nlarger flowers have another way. At first they are male; that is,\r\nthe pistil is as yet undeveloped and the four stamens are mature,\r\nready to shed pollen on any insect alighting on the lip. Later,\r\nwhen the stamens are past maturity, the pistil elongates itself\r\nand is ready for the reception of pollen brought from younger\r\nflowers. Many blossoms are male on the first day of opening, and\r\nfemale later, to protect themselves against self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, where the aromatic leaves of this little creeper were\r\nlong ago used for fermenting and clarifying beer, it is known by\r\nsuch names as ale-hoof and gill ale-gill, it is said, being\r\nderived from the old French word, guiller, to ferment or make\r\nmerry. Having trailed across Europe, the persistent hardy plant\r\nis now creeping its way over our continent, much to the disgust\r\nof cattle, which show unmistakable dislike for a single leaf\r\ncaught up in a mouthful of herbage.\r\n\r\nVery closely allied to the ground ivy is the CATMINT or CATNIP\r\n(Nepela Cataria) ,whose pale-purple, or nearly white flowers,\r\ndark-spotted, may be most easily named by crushing the coarsely\r\ntoothed leaves in one's hand. It is curious how cats will seek\r\nout this hoary-hairy plant in the waste places where it grows and\r\nbecome half-crazed with delight over its aromatic odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-HEAL; HEAL-ALL; BLUE CURLS; HEART-OF-THE-EARTH; BRUNELLA\r\n(Prunella vulgaris) Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purple and violet, in dense spikes, somewhat resembling\r\na clover head; from 1/2 to 1 in. long in flower, becoming 4 times\r\nthe length in fruit. Corolla tubular, irregularly 2-lipped, the\r\nupper lip darker and hood-like; the lower one 3-lobed, spreading,\r\nthe middle and largest lobe fringed; 4 twin-like stamens\r\nascending under upper lip; filaments ofthe lower and longer pair\r\n2-toothed at summit, one of the teeth bearing an anther, the\r\nother tooth sterile; style thread-like, shorter than stamens, and\r\nterminating in a 2-cleft stigma. Calyx 2-parted, half the length\r\nof corolla, its teeth often hairy on edges. Stem: 2 in. to 2 ft.\r\nhigh, erect or reclining, simple or branched. Leaves: Opposite,\r\noblong. Fruit: 4 nutlets, round and smooth.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, roadsides, waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - May-October.\r\nDistribution - North America, Europe, Asia.\r\n\r\nThis humble, rusty green plant, weakly lopping over the\r\nsurrounding grass, so that often only its insignificant purple,\r\nclover-like flower heads are visible, is another of those\r\nimmigrants from the old countries which, having proved fittest in\r\nthe fiercer struggle for existence there, has soon after its\r\nintroduction here exceeded most of our more favored native\r\nflowers in numbers. Everywhere we find the heal-all, sometimes\r\ndusty and stunted by the roadside, sometimes truly beautiful in\r\nits fresh purple, violet, and white when perfectly developed\r\nunder happy conditions. In England, where most flowers are deeper\r\nhued than with us, the heal-all is rich purple. What is the\r\nsecret of this flower's successful march across three continents?\r\nAs usual, the chief reason is to be found in the facility it\r\noffers insects to secure food; and the quantity of fertile seed\r\nit is therefore able to ripen as the result of their visits is\r\nits reward. Also, its flowering season is unusually long, and it\r\nis a tireless bloomer. It is finical in no respect; its sprawling\r\nstems root easily at the joints, and it is very hardy.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of bumblebees enter the flower, which being set\r\nin dense clusters enables them to suck the nectar from each with\r\nthe minimum loss of time, the smaller bee spending about two\r\nseconds to each. After allowing for the fraction of time it takes\r\nhim to sweep his eyes and the top of his head with his forelegs\r\nto free them from the pollen which must inevitably be shaken from\r\nthe stamen in the arch of the corolla as he dives deeply after\r\nthe nectar in the bottom of the throat, and to pass the pollen,\r\njust as honeybees do, with the most amazing quickness, from the\r\nforelegs to the middle ones, and thence to the hairy \"basket\" on\r\nthe hind ones - after making all allowances for such delays, this\r\nsmall worker is able to fertilize all the flowers in the fullest\r\ncluster in half a minute! When the contents of the baskets of two\r\ndifferent species of bumblebees caught on this blossom were\r\nexamined under the microscope, the pollen in one case proved to\r\nbe heal-all, with some from the goldenrod, and a few grains of a\r\nthird kind not identified; and in the other case; heal-all pollen\r\nand a small proportion of some unknown kind. Bees that are\r\nevidently out for both nectar and pollen on the same trip have\r\nbeen detected visiting white and yellow flowers on their way from\r\none heal-all cluster to another; and this fact, together with the\r\npresence of more than one kind of pollen in the basket, shows\r\nthat the generally accepted statement that bees confine\r\nthemselves to flowers of one kind or color during a trip is not\r\nalways according to fact.\r\n\r\nThe older name of the plant, Brunella, and the significant one,\r\naltered by Linnaeus into the softer sound it now bears, is\r\ndoubtless derived from the German word, braune, the quinsy.\r\nQuaint old Parkinson reads: \"This is generally called prunella\r\nand brunella from the Germans who called it brunellen, because it\r\ncureth that disease which they call die bruen, common to soldiers\r\nin campe, but especially in garrison, which is an inflammation of\r\nthe mouth, throat, and tongue.\" Among the old herbalists who\r\npretended to cure every ill that flesh is heir to with it, it was\r\nvariously known as carpenter's herb, sicklewort, hook-heal,\r\nslough-heal, and brownwort.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN or MOCK PENNYROYAL; TICKWEED; SQUAW MINT\r\n  (Hedeoma pulegioides)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, bluish purple, clustered in axils of upper\r\nleaves. Calyx tubular, unequally 5-cleft; teeth of upper lip\r\ntriangular, hairy in throat. Corolla 2-lipped, upper lip erect,\r\nnotched; lower one 3-cleft, spreading; 2 anther-bearing stamens\r\nunder upper lip; 2 sterile but apparent; 1 pistil with 2-cleft\r\nstyle. Stem: Low, erect, branched, square, hairy, 6 to 18 in.\r\nhigh. Leaves: Small, opposite, ovate to oblong, scantily toothed,\r\nstrongly aromatic, pungent.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, open woodland.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Cape Breton Island westward to Nebraska, south to\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nHowever insignificant its flower, this common little plant\r\nunmistakably proclaims its presence throughout the neighborhood.\r\nSo powerful is the pungent aroma of its leaves that dog doctors\r\nsprinkle them about freely in the kennels to kill fleas, a pest\r\nby no means exterminated in Southern Europe, however, where the\r\ntrue pennyroyal of commerce (Mentha Pulegium) is native. Herb\r\ngatherers who collect our pennyroyal, that is so similar to the\r\nEuropean species it is similarly employed in medicine, say they\r\ncan scent it from a greater distance than any other plant.\r\n\r\nBASTARD PENNYROYAL, which, like the Self-heal, is sometimes\r\ncalled BLUE CURLS (Trichostema dichotomum), chooses dry fields,\r\nbut preferably sandy ones, where we find its abundant, tiny blue\r\nflowers, that later change to purple, from July to October. Its\r\nbalsam-like odor is not agreeable, neither has the plant beauty\r\nto recommend it; yet where it grows, from Maine to Florida, and\r\nwest to Texas, it is likely to be so common we cannot well pass\r\nit unnoticed. The low, stiff, slender, much-branched, and rather\r\nclammy stem bears opposite, oblong, smooth-edged leaves narrowed\r\ninto petioles. One, two, or three flowers, borne at the tips of\r\nthe branches, soon fall off, leaving the 5-cleft calyx to cradle\r\nfour exposed nutlets.\r\n\r\n>From the five-lobed tubular corolla protrude four very long,\r\ncurling, blue or violet stamens - hair stamens the Greek generic\r\ntitle signifies - and the pretty popular name of blue curls also\r\nhas reference to these conspicuous filaments that are spirally\r\ncoiled in the bud.\r\n\r\nIn general habit like the two preceding plants, the FALSE\r\nPENNYROYAL (Isanthus brachiatus) nevertheless prefers that its\r\nsandy home should be near streams. From Quebec to Georgia,\r\nwestward to Minnesota and Texas, it blooms in midsummer, lifting\r\nits small, tubular, pale blue flowers from the axils of pointed,\r\nopposite leaves. An unusual characteristic in one of the mint\r\ntribe is that the five sharp lobes of its bell-shaped calyx, and\r\nthe five rounded, spreading lobes of the corolla, are of equal\r\nlength, hence its Greek name signifying an equal flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD or CREEPING THYME\r\n  (Thymus Serpyllum)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small purple or pink purple, fragrant, clustered\r\nat ends of branches or in leaf axils. Hairy calyx and corolla\r\n2-lipped, the latter with lower lip 3-cleft; stamens 4; style\r\n2-cleft. Leaves: Oblong, opposite, aromatic. Stem: 4 to 12 in.\r\nlong) creeping, woody, branched, forming dense cushions.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, dry banks, and waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe. Nova Scotia to Middle\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n    \"I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\r\n     Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows;\r\n     Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,\r\n     With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine.\"\r\n                        - A Midsummer Night's Dream.\r\n\r\nAccording to Danish tradition, anyone waiting by an elder-bush on\r\nMidsummer Night at twelve o'clock will see the king of fairyland\r\nand all his retinue pass by and disport themselves in favorite\r\nhaunts, among others the mounds of fragrant wild thyme. How well\r\nShakespeare knew his folklore!\r\n\r\nThyme is said to have been one of the three plants which made the\r\nVirgin Mary's bed. Indeed, the European peasants have as many\r\nmyths as there are quotations from the poets about this classic\r\nplant. Its very name denotes that it was used as an incense in\r\nGreek temples. No doubt it was the Common Thyme (T. vulgaris), an\r\nerect, tall plant cultivated in gardens here as a savory, that\r\nHorace says the Romans used so extensively for bee culture.\r\n\r\nDense cushions of creeping thyme usually contain two forms of\r\nblossoms on separate plants - hermaphrodite (male and female\r\nwhich are much the commoner; and pistillate, or only female,\r\nflowers, in which the stamens develop no pollen. The latter are\r\nmore fertile; none can fertilize itself. But blossoms so rich in\r\nnectar naturally attract quantities of insects - bees and\r\nbutterflies chiefly. A newly opened hermaphrodite flower, male on\r\nthe first day, dusts its visitors as they pass the ripe stamens.\r\nThis pollen they carry to a flower two days old, which, having\r\nreached the female stage, receives it on the mature two-cleft\r\nstigma, now erect and tall, whereas the stamens are past\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN, SPEAR, or MACKEREL MINT\r\n  (Mentha spicata; M. viridis of Gray)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, pale bluish, or pinkish purple, in whorls,\r\nforming terminal, interrupted, narrow spikes, 2 to 4 in. long in\r\nfruit, the central one surpassing lateral ones. Calyx\r\nbell-shaped, toothed; corolla tubular, 4-cleft. Stamens 4; style\r\n2-cleft. Stem: Smooth, 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high, branched. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, narrowly oblong, acute, saw-edged, aromatic.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil.\r\nFlowering Season  - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Eastern half of Canada and United States. Also\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe poets tell us that Proserpine, Pluto's wife, in a fit of\r\njealousy changed a hated rival into the mint plant, whose name\r\nMentha, in its Latin form, or Minthe, the Greek equivalent, is\r\nstill that of the metamorphosed beauty, a daughter of Cocytus,\r\nwho was also Pluto's wife. Proserpine certainly contrived to keep\r\nher rival's memory fragrant. But how she must delight in seeing\r\nher under the chopping-knife and served up as sauce!\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that among the Labiates, or two-lipped\r\nblossoms to which thymes and mints belong, there very frequently\r\noccur species bearing flowers that are male on the first day\r\n(staminate) and female, or pistillate, on the second day, and\r\nalso smaller female flowers on distinct plants. Muller believed\r\nthis plan was devised to attract insects, first by the more showy\r\nhermaphrodite flower, that they might carry its pollen to the\r\nless conspicuous female flower, which they would naturally visit\r\nlast; but this interesting theory has yet to be proved. Nineteen\r\nspecies of flies, to which the mints are specially adapted, have\r\nbeen taken in the act of transferring pollen. Ten varieties of\r\nthe lower hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and others) commonly resort\r\nto the fragrant spikes of bloom.\r\n\r\nPEPPERMINT (M. piiterita), similar in manner of growth to the\r\npreceding, is another importation from Europe now thoroughly at\r\nhome here in wet soil. The volatile oil obtained by distilling\r\nits leaves has long been an important item of trade in Wayne\r\nCounty, New York. One has only to crush the leaves in one's hand\r\nto name the flower.\r\n\r\nOur native WILD MINT (M. Canadensis), common along brook-sides\r\nand in moist soil from New Brunswick to Virginia and far\r\nwestward, has its whorls of small purplish flowers seated in the\r\nleaf axils. Its odor is like pennyroyal. The true PENNYROYAL, not\r\nto be confused with our spurious woodland annual, is M. Pulegium,\r\na native of Europe, whence a number of its less valuable\r\nrelatives, all perennials, have traveled to become naturalized\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nIn dry open woods and thickets and by the roadside, from late\r\nAugust throughout September, we find blooming the aromatic\r\nfragrant STONE MINT, SWEET HORSE-MINT, or AMERICAN DITTANY\r\n(Cunila origanoides; C. Mariana of Gray). Its small pink-purple,\r\nlilac, or whitish flowers, that are only about half as long as\r\nthe protruding pair of stamens, are borne in loose terminal\r\nclusters at the ends of the stiff, branched, slender, sometimes\r\nreddish, stem. A pair of rudimentary, useless stamens remain\r\nwithin the two-lipped tube; the exserted pair, affording the most\r\nconvenient alighting place for the visiting flies, dust their\r\nundersides with pollen the first day the flower opens; on the\r\nnext, the stigma will be ready to receive pollen carried from\r\nyoung flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHTSHADE; BLUE BINDWEED; FELONWORT; BITTERSWEET; SCARLET or\r\nSNAKE BERRY; POISON-FLOWER; WOODY NIGHTSHADE\r\n  (Solanum Dulcamara)  Potato family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Blue, purple, or, rarely, white with greenish spots on\r\neach lobe; about 1/2 in. broad, clustered in slender, drooping\r\ncymes. Calyx 5-lobed, oblong, persistent on the berry; corolla\r\ndeeply, sharply 5-cleft, wheel-shaped, or points curved backward;\r\n5 stamens inserted on throat, yellow, protruding, the anthers\r\nunited to form a cone; stigma small. Stem: Climbing or\r\nstraggling, woody below, branched, 2 to 8 ft. long. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, 2 to 4 in. long, 1 to 2 1/2 in. wide, pointed at the\r\napex, usually heart-shaped at base; some with 2 distinct leaflets\r\nbelow on the petiole, others have leaflets united with leaf like\r\nlower lobes or wings. Fruit: A bright red, oval berry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist thickets, fence rows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - United States east of Kansas, north of New Jersey.\r\nCanada, Europe, and Asia.\r\n\r\nMore beautiful than the graceful flowers are the drooping cymes\r\nof bright berries, turning from green to yellow, then to orange\r\nand scarlet, in the tangled thicket by the shady roadside in\r\nautumn, when the unpretending, shrubby vine, that has crowded its\r\nway through the rank midsummer vegetation, becomes a joy to the\r\neye. Another bittersweet, so-called, festoons the hedgerows with\r\nyellow berries which, bursting, show their scarlet-coated seeds.\r\nRose hips and mountain-ash berries, among many other conspicuous\r\nbits of color, arrest attention, but not for us were they\r\ndesigned. Now the birds are migrating, and, hungry with their\r\nlong flight, they gladly stop to feed upon fare so attractive.\r\nHard, indigestible seeds traverse the alimentary canal without\r\nalteration and are deposited many miles from the parent that bore\r\nthem. Nature's methods for widely distributing plants cannot but\r\nstir the dullest imagination.\r\n\r\nThe purple pendent flowers of this nightshade secrete no nectar,\r\ntherefore many insects let them alone; but it is now believed\r\nthat no part of the plant is poisonous. Certainly one that claims\r\nthe potato, tomato, and eggplant among its kin has no right to be\r\ndangerous. The BLACK, GARDEN, or DEADLY NIGHTSHADE, also called\r\nMOREL (S. nigrum), bears jet-black berries that are alleged to be\r\nfatal. Nevertheless, female bumblebees, to which its white\r\nflowers are specially adapted, visit them to draw out pollen from\r\nthe chinks of the anthers with their jaws, just as they do in the\r\ncase of the wild, sensitive plant, and with no more disastrous\r\nresult. It has been well said that the nightshades are a blessing\r\nboth to the sick and to the doctors. The present species takes\r\nits name from dulcis, sweet, and amaras, bitter, referring to the\r\ntaste of the juice; the generic name is derived from solamen,\r\nsolace or consolation, referring to the relief afforded by the\r\nnarcotic properties of some of these plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE or WILD TOADFLAX; BLUE LINARIA\r\n  (Linaria Canadensis)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale blue to purple, small, irregular, in slender\r\nspikes. Calyx 5-pointed; corolla 2-lipped, with curved spur\r\nlonger than its tube, which is nearly closed by a white, 2-ridged\r\nprojection or palate; the upper lip erect, 2-lobed; lower lip\r\n3-lobed, spreading. Stamens 4, in pairs, in throat; 1 pistil.\r\nStem: Slender, weak, of sterile shoots, prostrate; flowering\r\nstem, ascending or erect, 4 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Small,\r\nlinear, alternately scattered along stem, or oblong in pairs or\r\nthrees on leafy sterile shoots.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, gravel, or sand.\r\nFlowering Season - May-October.\r\nDistribution - North, Central, and South Americas.\r\n\r\nSometimes lying prostrate in the dust, sometimes erect, the\r\nlinaria's delicate spikes of bloom wear an air of injured\r\ninnocence, yet the plant, weak as it looks, has managed to spread\r\nover three Americas from ocean to ocean. More beautiful than the\r\nrather scrawny flowers are the tufts of cool green foliage made\r\nby the sterile shoots that take complete possession of a wide\r\narea around the parent plants.\r\n\r\nUnlike its relative butter-and-eggs, the corolla of this toadflax\r\nis so contracted that bees cannot enter it; but by inserting\r\ntheir long tongues, they nevertheless manage to drain it. Small,\r\nshort-tongued bees contrive to reach only a little nectar. The\r\npalate, so valuable to the other linaria, has in this one lost\r\nits function; and the larger flies, taking advantage of the\r\nflower's weakness, pilfer both sweets and pollen. Butterflies, to\r\nwhich a slender spurred flower is especially attractive, visit\r\nthis one in great numbers, and as they cannot regale themselves\r\nwithout touching the anthers and stigma, they may be regarded as\r\nthe legitimate visitors.\r\n\r\nWolf, rat, mouse, sow, cow, cat, snake, dragon, dog, toad, are\r\namong the many animal prefixes to the names of flowers that the\r\nEnglish country people have given for various and often most\r\ninteresting reasons. Just as dog, used as a prefix, expresses an\r\nidea of worthlessness to them, so toad suggests a spurious plant;\r\nthe toadflax being made to bear what is meant to be an odious\r\nname because before flowering it resembles the true flax, linum,\r\nfrom which the generic title is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYLAND FIGWORT; BEE PLANT; KNOTTED FIGWORT; HEAL-ALL; PILEWORT\r\n  (Scrophularia Marylandica; S. nodosa of Gray)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, dull green on outside; vivid, shining\r\nbrownish purple within; borne in almost leafless terminal\r\nclusters on slender stems; Calyx 5-parted.; corolla of 5 rounded\r\nlobes, the 2 upper ones erect, side ones ascending, lower one\r\nbent downward; 5 staroens, 4 of them twin-like and bearing\r\nanthers, the fifth sterile, a mere scale on roof of the globular\r\ncorolla tube; style with knot-like stigma. Stem: From 3 to 10 ft.\r\nhigh, square, with grooved sides, widely. branching. Leaves: From\r\n3 to 12 in. long, oblong, pointed, coarsely toothed, on slender\r\nstems, strong smelling.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, shady ground.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - New York to the Carolinas, westward to Tennessee\r\nand Kansas; possibly beyond.\r\n\r\nAn insignificant little flower by itself, conspicuous only\r\nbecause it rears itself in clusters on a level with one's eyes,\r\nlacking beauty, perfume, and all that makes a blossom charming to\r\nthe human mind - why has it been elevated by the botanists to the\r\ndignity of lending its name to a large and important family, and\r\nwhy is it mentioned at all in a popular flower book beside the\r\nmore showy ornaments of nature's garden? Both questions have the\r\nsame answer: Because it is the typical flower of the family, and\r\ntherefore serves as an illustration of the manner in which many\r\nothers are fertilized. Beautiful blossoms are by no means always\r\nthe most important ones.\r\n\r\nIt well repays one to observe the relative times of maturing\r\nanthers and stigmas in the flowers, as thereby hangs a tale in\r\nwhich some insect plays an interesting role. The figwort matures\r\nits stigma at the lip of the style before its anthers have\r\nripened their pollen. Why? By having the stigma of a newly opened\r\nflower thrust forward to the mouth of the corolla, an insect\r\nalighting on the lip, which forms his only convenient landing\r\nplace, must brush against it and leave upon it some pollen\r\nbrought from an older flower, whose anthers are already matured.\r\nAt this early stage of the flower's development its stamens lie\r\ncurved over in the tube of the corolla; but presently, as the\r\nalready fertilized style begins to wither, and its stigma is dry\r\nand no longer receptive to pollen, then, since there can be no\r\nlonger any fear of self-pollination - the horror of so many\r\nflowers - the figwort uncurls and elevates its stamens. The\r\ninsect visitor in search of nectar must get dusted with pollen\r\nfrom the late maturing anthers now ready for him. By this\r\ningenious method the flower becomes cross-fertilized and wastes\r\nthe least pollen.\r\n\r\nBees and wasps evidently pursue opposite routes in going to work,\r\nthe former beginning at the bottom of a spike or raceme, where\r\nthe older, more mature flowers are, and working upward; the wasps\r\ncommencing at the top, among the newly opened ones. In spite of\r\nthe fact that we usually see hive bees about this plant,\r\npilfering the generous supply of nectar in each tiny cup, it is\r\nundoubtedly the wasp that is the flower's truest benefactor,\r\nsince he carries pollen from the older blossoms of the last\r\nraceme visited to the projecting stigmas of the newly opened\r\nflowers at the top of the next cluster. Manifestly no flower,\r\neven though it were especially adapted to wasps, as this one is,\r\ncould exclude bees. About one-third of all its visitors are\r\nwasps.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRY BEARD-TONGUE\r\n  (Pentstemon hirsutus; P. pubescens of Gray)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull violet or lilac and white, about 1 in. long, borne\r\nin a loose spike. Calyx 5-parted, the sharply pointed sepals\r\noverlapping; corolla, a gradually inflated tube widening where\r\nthe mouth divides into a 2-lobed upper lip and a 3-lobed lower\r\nlip; the throat nearly closed by hairy palate at base of lower\r\nlip; sterile fifth stamen densely bearded for half its length; 4\r\nanther-bearing stamens, the anthers divergent. Stem: 1 to 3 ft.\r\nhigh, erect, downy above. Leaves: Oblong to lance shape, upper\r\nones seated on stem; lower ones narrowed into petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry or rocky fields, thickets, and open\r\nwoods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Ontario to Florida, Manitoba to Texas.\r\n\r\nIt is the densely bearded, yellow, fifth stamen (pente =five,\r\nstemon = a stamen) which gives this flower its scientific name\r\nand its chief interest to the structural botanist. From the fact\r\nthat a blossom has a lip in the center of the lower half of its\r\ncorolla, that an insect must use as its landing place, comes the\r\nnecessity for the pistil to occupy a central position. Naturally,\r\na fifth stamen would be only in its way, an encumbrance to be\r\nbanished in time. In the figwort, for example, we have seen the\r\nfifth stamen reduced, from long sterility, to a mere scale on the\r\nroof of the corolla tube in other lipped flowers, the useless\r\norgan has disappeared; but in the beard-tongue, it goes through a\r\nseries of curious curves from the upper to the under side of the\r\nflower to get out of the way of the pistil. Yet it serves an\r\nadmirable purpose in helping close the mouth of the flower, which\r\nthe hairy lip alone could not adequately guard against pilferers.\r\nA long-tongued bee, thrusting in his head up to his eyes only,\r\nreceives the pollen in his face. The blossom is male (staminate)\r\nin its first stage and female (pistillate) in its second.\r\n\r\nWhile this is the beard-tongue commonly found in the Eastern\r\nUnited States, particularly southward, and one of the most\r\nbeautiful of its clan, the western species have been selected by\r\nthe gardeners for hybridizing into those more showy, but often\r\nless charming, flowers now quite extensively cultivated. Several\r\nvarieties of these, having escaped from gardens in the East, are\r\nlocally common wild.\r\n\r\nThe LARGE-FLOWERED BEARD-TONGUE (P. grandiflorus), one of the\r\nfinest prairie species, whose lavender-blue, bell-shaped corolla\r\nis abruptly dilated above the calyx, measures nearly two inches\r\nlong. Its sterile filament, curved over at the summit, is bearded\r\nthere only.\r\n\r\nHandsomest of all is the COBEA BEARD-TONGUE, a native of the\r\nSouthwest, with a broadly rounded, bell-shaped corolla, hairy\r\nwithout, like the leaves, but smooth within. The pale purple\r\nblossom, delicately suffused with yellow, and pencilled with red\r\nlines - pathfinders for the bees - has the base of its tube\r\ncreamy white. Few flowers hang from each stout clammy spike.\r\n\r\nThe more densely crowded spikes of the large SMOOTH BEARD-TONGUE\r\n(P. glaber), a smaller blue or purple flowered, narrower-leaved\r\nspecies, that shows an unusual preference for moist soil\r\nthroughout its range, is, like the other beard-tongues mentioned,\r\nbetter known to the British gardener, perhaps, than to Americans,\r\nwho have yet to learn the value of many of their wild flowers\r\nunder cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe tall FOXGLOVE BEARD-TONGUE (P. digitalis), with large, showy\r\nwhite blossoms tinged with purple, the one most commonly grown in\r\ngardens here, escapes on the slightest encouragement to run wild\r\nagain from Maine to Virginia, west to Illinois and Arkansas.\r\nSmall bees crawl into the broad tube, and butterflies drain the\r\nnectar evidently secreted for long-tongued bees, but without\r\ncertainly transferring pollen. To insure cross-fertilization, the\r\nflower first develops its anthers, whose saw-edges grating\r\nagainst the visitors thorax, aid in sifting out the dry pollen;\r\nand later the style, which when immature clung to the top of the\r\ncorolla, lowers its receptive stigma to oppose the bee's\r\nentrance. Professor Robertson has frequently detected the common\r\nwasp nipping holes with her sharp jaws in the base of the tube.\r\nWith remarkable intelligence she invariably chose to insert her\r\ntongue at the precise spots where the nectar is stored on either\r\nside of the sterile filament.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE-EYED MARY; INNOCENCE; BROAD-LEAVED COLLINSIA\r\n  (Collinsia verna)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - On slender, weak stalks; whorled in axils of upper\r\nleaves. Blue on lower lip of corolla, its middle lobe folded\r\nlengthwise to enclose 4 adhering stamens and pistil; upper lip\r\nwhite, with scalloped margins; corolla from 1/2 to 3/4 in. long,\r\nits throat about equaling the deeply 5-cleft calyx. Stem: Hoary,\r\nslender, simple or branched, from 6 in. to 2 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nThin, opposite; upper and more acute ones clasping the stem;\r\nlower, ovate ones on short petioles. Fruit: A round capsule to\r\nwhich the enlarged calyx adheres.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist meadows, woods, and thickets. Flowering\r\nSeason - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Western New York and Pennsylvania to Wisconsin,\r\nKentucky, and Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nNext of kin to the great Paulonia tree, whose deliciously sweet,\r\nvanilla-scented, trumpet-shaped violet flowers are happily fast\r\nbecoming as common here as in their native Japan, what has this\r\nfragile, odorless blossom of the meadows in common with it?\r\nApparently nothing; but superficial appearances count for little\r\nor nothing among scientists, to whom the structure of floral\r\norgans is of prime importance; and analysis instantly shows the\r\nclose relationship between these dissimilar-looking cousins. Even\r\nwithout analysis one can readily see that the monkey flower is\r\nnot far removed.\r\n\r\nBecause few writers have arisen as yet in the newly settled\r\nregions of the middle West and Southwest, where blue-eyed Mary\r\ndyes acres of meadow land with her heavenly color, her praises\r\nare little sung in the books, but are loudly buzzed by myriads of\r\nbees that are her most devoted lovers. \"I regard the flower as\r\nespecially adapted to the early flying bees with abdominal\r\ncollecting brushes for pollen - i.e., species of Osmia - and\r\nthese bees,\" says Professor Robertson of Illinois, \"although not\r\nthe exclusive visitors, are far more abundant and important than\r\nall the other visitors together.\" For them are the brownish marks\r\non the palate provided as pathfinders. At the pressure of their\r\nstrong heads the palate yields to give them entrance, and at\r\ntheir removal it springs back to protect the pollen against the\r\ninroads of flies, mining bees, and beetles. As the longer stamens\r\nshed their pollen before the shorter ones mature theirs, bees\r\nmust visit the flower several times to collect it all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONKEY-FLOWER\r\n  (Minulus ringens)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purple, violet, or lilac, rarely whitish; about 1 in.\r\nlong, solitary, borne on slender footstems from axils of upper\r\nleaves. Calyx prismatic, 5-angled, 5-toothed; corolla irregular,\r\ntubular, narrow in throat, 2-lipped; upper lip 2-lobed, erect;\r\nunder lip 3-lobed, spreading; 4 stamens, a long and a short pair,\r\ninserted on corolla tube; pistil with 2-lobed, plate-like stigma.\r\nStem: Square, erect, usually branched, 1 to 3 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, oblong to lance-shaped, saw-edged, mostly seated on\r\nstem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, beside streams and ponds.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Manitoba, Nebraska, and Texas, eastward to\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nNo wader is the square-stemmed Monkey-flower whose grinning\r\ncorolla peers at one from grassy tuffets in swamps, from the\r\nbrookside, the springy soil of low meadows, and damp hollows\r\nbeside the road; but moisture it must have to fill its nectary\r\nand to soften the ground for the easier transit of its creeping\r\nrootstock. Imaginative eyes see what appears to them the gaping\r\n(ringens) face of a little ape or buffoon (mimulus) in this\r\ncommon flower whose drolleries, such as they are, call forth the\r\nonly applause desired - the buzz of insects that become\r\npollen-laden during the entertainment.\r\n\r\nNow the advanced stigma of this flower is peculiarly irritable,\r\nand closes up on contact with an incoming visitor's body, thus\r\nexposing the pollen-laden anthers behind it, and, except in rare\r\ncases, preventing self-fertilization. Delpino was the first to\r\nguess what advantage so sensitive a stigma might mean. Probably\r\nthe smaller bees find the tube too long for their short tongues.\r\nThe yellow palate, which partially guards the entrance to the\r\nnectary from pilferers, of course serves also as a pathfinder to\r\nthe long-tongued bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN BROOKLIME\r\n  (Veronica Americana)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light blue to white, usually striped with deep blue or\r\npurple structure of flower similar to that of V. officinalis, but\r\nborne in long, loose racemes branching outward on stems that\r\nspring from axils of most of the leaves. Stem: Without hairs,\r\nusually branched, 6 in. to 3 ft. long, lying partly on ground and\r\nrooting from lower joints. Leaves: Oblong, lance-shaped,\r\nsaw-edged, opposite, petioled, and lacking hairs; 1 to 3 in.\r\nlong, 1/4 to 1 in. wide. Fruit: A nearly round, compressed, but\r\nnot flat, capsule with flat seeds in 2 cells.\r\nPreferred Habitat - In brooks, ponds, ditches, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - April-September.\r\nDistribution - From Atlantic to Pacific, Alaska to California and\r\nNew Mexico, Quebec to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis, the perhaps most beautiful native speedwell, whose sheets\r\nof blue along the brookside are so frequently mistaken for masses\r\nof forget-me-nots by the hasty observer, of course shows marked\r\ndifferences on closer investigation; its tiny blue flowers are\r\nmarked with purple pathfinders, and the plant is not hairy, to\r\nmention only two. But the poets of England are responsible for\r\nmost of whatever confusion stills lurks in the popular mind\r\nconcerning these two flowers. Speedwell, a common medieval\r\nbenediction from a friend, equivalent to our farewell or adieu,\r\nand forget - me-not of similar intent, have been used\r\ninterchangeably by some writers in connection with parting gifts\r\nof small blue flowers. It was the germander speedwell that in\r\nliterature and botanies alike was most commonly known as the\r\nforget-me-not for over two hundred years, or until only fifty\r\nyears ago. When the \"Mayflower\" and her sister ships were\r\nlaunched; \"Speedwell\" was considered a happier name for a vessel\r\nthan it proved to be.\r\n\r\nThe WATER SPEEDWELL, or PIMPERNEL (V. Anagallis-aquatica),\r\ndiffers from the preceding chiefly in having most of its leaves\r\nseated on the stalk, only the lower ones possessing stems, and\r\nthose short ones. In autumn the increased growth of sterile\r\nshoots from runners produce almost circular leaves, often two\r\ninches broad, a certain aid to identification.\r\n\r\nAnother close relation, the MARSH or SKULLCAP SPEEDWELL (V.\r\nscutellata), on the other hand, has long, very slender, acute\r\nleaves, their teeth far apart; and as these three species are the\r\nonly members of their clan likely to be found in watery places\r\nwithin our limits, a close examination of the leaves of any\r\nwater-loving plant bearing small four-lobed blue flowers, usually\r\nmarked with lines of a deeper blue or purple, should enable one\r\nto correctly name the species. None of these blossoms can be\r\ncarried far after being picked; they have a tantalizing habit of\r\ndropping off, leaving a bouquet of tiny green calices chiefly.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of bees, wasps, flies, and butterflies fertilize all\r\nthese little flowers, which are first staminate, then pistillate,\r\nsimply by crawling over them in search of nectar.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON SPEEDWELL; FLUELLIN; PAUL'S BETONY; GROUND-HELE\r\n  (Veronica officinalis)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale blue, very small, crowded on spike-like racemes\r\nfrom axils of leaves, often from alternate axils. Calyx 4-parted;\r\ncorolla of 4 lobes, lower lobe commonly narrowest ; 2 divergent\r\nstamens inserted at base and on either side of upper corolla lobe\r\n; a knob-like stigma on solitary pistil. Stem: From 3 to 10 in.\r\nlong, hairy, often prostrate, and rooting at joints. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, oblong, obtuse, saw-edged, narrowed at base. Fruit:\r\nCompressed heart-shaped capsule, containing numerous flat seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, uplands, open woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - From Michigan and Tennessee eastward, also from\r\nOntario to Nova Scotia. Probably an immigrant from Europe and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nAn ancient tradition of the Roman Church relates that when Jesus\r\nwas on His way to Calvary, He passed the home of a certain Jewish\r\nmaiden, who, when she saw the drops of agony on His brow, ran\r\nafter Him along the road to wipe His face with her kerchief. This\r\nlinen, the monks declared, ever after bore the impress of the\r\nsacred features - vera iconica, the true likeness. When the\r\nChurch wished to canonize the pitying maiden, an abbreviated form\r\nof the Latin words was given her, St. Veronica, and her kerchief\r\nbecame one of the most precious relics at St. Peter's, where it\r\nis said to be still preserved. Medieval flower lovers, whose\r\npiety seems to have been eclipsed only by their imaginations,\r\nnamed this little flower from a fancied resemblance to the relic.\r\nOf course, special healing virtue was attributed to the square of\r\npictured linen, and since all could not go to Rome to be cured by\r\nit, naturally the next step was to employ the common, wayside\r\nplant that bore the saint's name. Mental healers will not be\r\nsurprised to learn that because of the strong popular belief in\r\nits efficacy to cure all fleshly ills, it actually seemed to\r\npossess miraculous powers. For scrofula it was said to be the\r\ninfallible remedy, and presently we find Linnaeus grouping this\r\nflower, and all its relatives under the family name of\r\nScrofulariaceae. \"What's in a name?\" Religion, theology,\r\nmedicine, folk-lore, metaphysics, what not?\r\n\r\nOne of the most common wild flowers in England is this same\r\nfamiliar little blossom of that lovely shade of blue known by\r\nChinese artists as \"the sky after rain.\" \"The prettiest of all\r\nhumble roadside flowers I saw,\" says Burroughs, in \"A Glance at\r\nBritish Wild Flowers.\" \"It is prettier than the violet, and\r\nlarger and deeper colored than our houstonia. It is a small and\r\ndelicate edition of our hepatica, done in indigo blue, and wonted\r\nto the grass in the fields and by the waysides.\r\n\r\n    'The little speedwell's darling blue'\r\n\r\nsings Tennyson. I saw it blooming with the daisy and buttercup\r\nupon the grave of Carlyle. The tender human and poetic element of\r\nhis stern, rocky nature was well expressed by it.\"\r\n\r\nOnly as it grows in masses is the speedwell conspicuous - a\r\nsufficient reason for its habit of forming colonies and of\r\ngathering its insignificant blossoms together into dense spikes,\r\nsince by these methods it issues a flaunting advertisement of its\r\nnectar. The flower that simplifies dining for insects has its\r\ncertain reward in rapidly increased and vigorous descendants. To\r\nsave repetition, the reader interested in the process of\r\nfertilization is referred to the account of the Maryland figwort,\r\nsince many members of the large family to which both belong\r\nemploy the same method of economizing pollen and insuring fertile\r\nseed. In this case visitors have only to crawl over the tiny\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n>From Labrador to Alaska, throughout almost every section of the\r\nUnited States, in South America, Europe, and Asia, roams the\r\nTHYME-LEAVED SPEEDWELL (V. serpyllifolia), by the help of its\r\nnumerous flat seeds, that are easily transported on the wind, and\r\nby its branching stem, that lies partly on the ground, rooting\r\nwhere the joints touch earth. The small oval leaves, barely half\r\nan inch long, grow in pairs. The tiny blue, or sometimes white,\r\nflowers, with dark pathfinders to the nectary, are borne on\r\nspike-like racemes at the ends of the stem and branches that rear\r\nthemselves upward in fields and thickets to display their bloom\r\nbefore the passing bee.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALE, or NAKED, or ONE-FLOWERED BROOM-RAPE\r\n  (Thalesia uniflora; Aphyllon uniflorum of Gray)  Broom-rape\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Violet, rarely white, delicately fragrant, solitary at\r\nend of erect, glandular peduncles. Calyx hairy, bell-shaped,\r\n5-toothed, not half the length of corolla, which is 1 in. or less\r\nlong, with curved tube spreading into 2 lips, 5-lobed,\r\nyellow-bearded within; 4 stamens, in pairs, inserted on tube of\r\ncorolla ; 1 pistil. Stem: About 1 in. long, scaly, often entirely\r\nunderground; the 1 to 4 brownish scape-like peduncles, on which\r\nflowers are borne, from 3 to 8 in. high. Leaves: None. Fruit: An\r\nelongated, egg-shaped, 1-celled capsule containing numerous\r\nseeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Damp woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - British Possessions and United States from coast\r\nto coast, southward to Virginia, and Texas.\r\n\r\nA curious, beautiful parasite, fastened on the roots of honest\r\nplants from which it draws its nourishment. The ancestors of this\r\nspecies, having deserted the path of rectitude ages ago to live\r\nby piracy, gradually lost the use of their leaves, upon which\r\nvirtuous plants depend as upon a part of their digestive\r\napparatus; they grew smaller and smaller, shriveled and dried,\r\nuntil now that the one-flowered broom-rape sucks its food,\r\nrendered already digestible through another's assimilation, no\r\nleaves remain on its brownish scapes. Disuse of any talent in the\r\nvegetable kingdom, as in the spiritual, leads to inevitable loss:\r\n\"Unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath\r\nnot, even that he hath shall be taken away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRY RUELLIA\r\n  (Ruellia ciliosa)  Acanthus family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale violet blue, showy, about 2 in. long, solitary or\r\nclustered in the axils or at the end of stem. Calyx of 5\r\nbristle-shaped hairy segments; corolla with very slender tube\r\nexpanding above in 5 nearly equal obtuse lobes; stamens 4; pistil\r\nwith recurved style. Stem: Hairy, especially above, erect, 1 to 2\r\n1/2 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite, oblong, narrowed at apex, entire,\r\ncovered with soft white hairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - New Jersey southward to the Gulf and westward to\r\nMichigan and Nebraska.\r\n\r\nMany charming ruellias from the tropics adorn hothouses and\r\nwindow gardens in winter; but so far north as the New Jersey pine\r\nbarrens, and westward where killing frosts occur, this perennial\r\nproves to be perfectly hardy. In addition to its showy blossoms,\r\nwhich so successfully invite insects to transfer their pollen,\r\nthereby counteracting the bad effects of close inbreeding, the\r\nplant bears inconspicuous cleistogamous or blind ones also. These\r\nlook like arrested buds that never open; but, being fertilized\r\nwith their own pollen, ripen abundant seed nevertheless.\r\n\r\nOne frequently finds holes bitten in these flowers, as in so many\r\nothers long of tube or spur. Bumblebees, among the most\r\nintelligent and mischievous of insects, are apt to be the chief\r\noffenders; but wasps are guilty too, and the female carpenter\r\nbee, which ordinarily slits holes to extract nectar, has been\r\ndetected in the act of removing circular pieces of the corolla\r\nfrom this ruellia with which to plug up a thimble-shaped tube in\r\nsome decayed tree. Here she deposits an egg on top of a layer of\r\nbaby food, consisting of a paste of pollen and nectar, and seals\r\nup the nursery with another bit of leaf or flower, repeating the\r\nprocess until the long tunnel is filled with eggs and food for\r\nlarvae. Then she dies, leaving her entire race apparently\r\nextinct, and living only in embryo for months. This is the bee\r\nwhich commonly cuts her round plugs from rose leaves.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH RUELLIA (R. strepens), an earlier bloomer than the\r\npreceding, and with a more southerly range, has a shorter,\r\nthicker tube to its handsome blue flower, and lacks the hairs\r\nwhich guard its relative from crawling pilferers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUETS; INNOCENCE; HOUSTONIA; QUAKER LADIES; QUAKER BONNETS;\r\nVENUS' PRIDE\r\n  (Houstonia caerulea)  Madder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, light to purplish blue or white, with\r\nyellow center, and borne at end of each erect slender stem that\r\nrises from 3 to 7 in. high. Corolla funnel-shaped, with 4 oval,\r\npointed, spreading lobes that equal the slender tube in length;\r\nrarely the corolla has more divisions; 4 stamens inserted on tube\r\nof corolla; 2 stigmas; calyx 4-lobed. Leaves: Opposite, seated on\r\nstem, oblong, tiny; the lower ones spatulate. Fruit: A 2-lobed\r\npod, broader than long, its upper half free from calyx; seeds\r\ndeeply concave. Root stock: Slender, spreading, forming dense\r\ntufts.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist meadows, wet rocks and banks.\r\nFlowering Season - April-July, or sparsely through summer.\r\nDistribution - Eastern Canada and United States west to Michigan,\r\nsouth to Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\nMillions of these dainty wee flowers, scattered through the grass\r\nof moist meadows and by the wayside, reflect the blue and the\r\nserenity of heaven in their pure, upturned faces. Where the white\r\nvariety grows, one might think a light snowfall had powdered the\r\ngrass, or a milky way of tiny floral stars had streaked a\r\nterrestrial path. Linnaeus named the flower for Dr. Houston, a\r\nyoung English physician, botanist, and collector, who died in\r\nSouth America in 1733, after an exhausting tramp about the Gulf\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo secure cross-fertilization, the object toward which so much\r\nmarvelous floral organism is directed, this little plant puts\r\nforth two forms of blossoms - one with the stamens in the lower\r\nportion of the corolla tube, and the stigmas exserted; the other\r\nform with the stigmas below, and the stamens elevated to the\r\nmouth of the corolla. But the two kinds do not grow in the same\r\npatch, seed from either producing after its kind. Many insects\r\nvisit these blossoms, but chiefly small bees and butterflies.\r\nConspicuous among the latter is the common little meadow\r\nfritillary (Brenthis bellona), whose tawny, dark-speckled wings\r\nexpand and close in apparent ecstasy as he tastes the tiny drop\r\nof nectar in each dainty enameled cup. Coming to feast with his\r\ntongue dusted from anthers nearest the nectary, he pollenizes the\r\nlarge stigmas of a short-styled blossom without touching its tall\r\nanthers. But it is evident that he could not be depended on to\r\nfertilize the long-styled form, with its smaller stigma, because\r\nof this ability to insert his slender tongue from the side where\r\nit avoids contact. Flies and beetles enter the blossoms, but\r\nsmall bees are best adapted as all-round benefactors. This\r\nsimple-looking blossom, that measures barely half an inch across,\r\nis clever enough to multiply its lovely species a thousand fold,\r\nwhile many a larger, and therefore one might suppose a wiser,\r\nflower dwindles toward extinction.\r\n\r\nJohn Burroughs found a single bluet in blossom one January, near\r\nWashington, when the clump of earth on which it grew was frozen\r\nsolid. A pot of roots gathered in autumn and placed in a sunny\r\nwindow has sent up a little colony of star-like flowers\r\nthroughout a winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD, COMMON, or CARD TEASEL; GYPSY COMBS\r\n  (Dipsacus sylvestris)  Teasel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purple or lilac, small, packed in dense, cylindric\r\nheads, 3 to 4 in. long; growing singly on ends of footstalks, the\r\nflowers set among stiffly pointed, slender scales. Calyx\r\ncup-shaped, 4-toothed. Corolla 4-lobed; stamens 4; leaves of\r\ninvolucre, slender, bristled, curved upward as high as\r\nflower-head or beyond. Stems: 3 to 6 ft. high, stout, branched,\r\nleafy, with numerous short prickles. Leaves: Opposite,\r\nlance-shaped, seated on stem, with bristles along the stout\r\nmidrib.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides and waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Virginia, westward to Ontario and the\r\nMississippi. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nManufacturers find that no invention can equal the natural teasel\r\nhead for raising a nap on woolen cloth, because it breaks at any\r\nserious obstruction, whereas a metal substitute, in such a case,\r\ntears the material. Accordingly, the plant is largely cultivated\r\nin the west of England, and quantities that have been imported\r\nfrom France and Germany may be seen in wagons on the way to the\r\nfactories in any of the woolen-trade towns. After the\r\nflower-heads wither, the stems are cut about eight inches long,\r\nstripped of prickles, to provide a handle, and after drying, the\r\nnatural tool is ready for use.\r\n\r\nBristling with armor, the teasel is not often attacked by\r\nbrowsing cattle. Occasionally even the upper leaf surfaces are\r\ndotted over with prickles enough to tear a tender tongue. This is\r\na curious feature, for prickles usually grow out of veins. In the\r\nreceptacle formed where the bases of the upper leaves grow\r\ntogether, rain and dew are found collected - a certain cure for\r\nwarts, country people say. Venus' Cup, Bath, or Basin, and Water\r\nThistle, are a few of the teasel's folk names earned by its\r\ncurious little tank. In it many small insects are drowned, and\r\nthese are supposed to contribute nourishment to the plant; for\r\nMr. Francis Darwin has noted that protoplasmic filaments reach\r\nout into the liquid.\r\n\r\nOwing to the stiff spines which radiate from the flower cluster,\r\nthe bumblebees, which principally fertilize it, can reach the\r\nflorets only with their heads, and not pollenize them by merely\r\ncrawling over them as in the true compositae. But by first\r\nmaturing its anthers, then when they have shed their pollen,\r\nelevating its stigmas, the teasel prevents self-fertilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAREBELL or HAIRBELL; BLUE BELLS of SCOTLAND; LADY'S THIMBLE\r\n  (Campanula rotundifolia)  Bellflower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright blue or violet blue, bell-shaped, 1/2 in. long\r\nor over, drooping from hair-like stalks. Calyx of 5-pointed,\r\nnarrow, spreading lobes; slender stamens alternate with lobes of\r\ncorolla, and borne on summit of calyx tube, which is adherent to\r\novary; pistil with 3 stigmas in maturity only. Stem: Very\r\nslender, 6 in. to 3 ft. high, often several from same root;\r\nsimple or branching. Leaves: Lower ones nearly round, usually\r\nwithered and gone by flowering season; stem leaves narrow,\r\npointed, seated on stem. Fruit: An egg-shaped, pendent, 3-celled\r\ncapsule with short openings near base; seeds very numerous, tiny.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist rocks, uplands.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and America;\r\nsouthward on this continent, through Canada to New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania; westward to Nebraska, to Arizona in the Rockies,\r\nand to California in the Sierra Nevadas.\r\n\r\nThe inaccessible crevice of a precipice, moist rocks sprayed with\r\nthe dashing waters of a lake or some tumbling mountain stream,\r\nwind-swept upland meadows, and shady places by the roadside may\r\nhold bright bunches of these hardy bells, swaying with exquisite\r\ngrace on tremulous, hair-like stems that are fitted to withstand\r\nthe fiercest mountain blasts, however frail they appear. How\r\ndainty, slender, tempting these little flowers are! One gladly\r\nrisks a watery grave or broken bones to bring down a bunch from\r\nits aerial cranny.\r\n\r\nIt was a long stride forward in the evolutionary scale when the\r\nharebell welded its five once separate petals together; first at\r\nthe base, then farther and farther up the sides, until a solid\r\nbell-shaped structure resulted. This arrangement which makes\r\ninsect fertilization a more certain process because none of the\r\npollen is lost through apertures, and because the visitor must\r\nenter the flower only at the vital point where the stigmas come\r\nin contact with his pollen-laden body, has given to all the\r\nflowers that have attained to it, marked ascendency.\r\n\r\nLike most inverted blossoms, the harebell hangs its head to\r\nprotect its nectar and pollen, not only from rain, but from the\r\nintrusion of undesirable crawling insects which would simply\r\nbrush off its pollen in the grass before reaching the pistil of\r\nanother flower, and so defeat cross-fertilization, the end and\r\naim of so many blossoms. Advertising for winged insects by its\r\nbright color, the harebell attracts bees, butterflies, and many\r\nothers. These visitors cannot well walk on the upright petals,\r\nand sooner or later must clasp the pistil if they would secure\r\nthe nectar secreted at the base. In doing so, they will dust\r\nthemselves and the immature pistil with the pollen from the\r\nsurrounding anthers; but a newly opened flower is incapable of\r\nfertilization. The pollen, although partially discharged in the\r\nunopened bud, is prevented from falling out by a coat of hairs on\r\nthe upper part of the style. By the time all the pollen has been\r\nremoved by visitors, however, and the stamens which matured early\r\nhave withered, the pistil has grown longer, until it looks like\r\nthe clapper in a bell; the stigma at its top has separated into\r\nthree horizontal lobes which, being sticky on the under side, a\r\npollen-laden insect on entering the bell must certainly brush\r\nagainst them and render them fertile. But bumblebees, its chief\r\nbenefactors, and others may not have done their duty by the\r\nflower; what then? Why, the stigmas in that case finally bend\r\nbackward to reach the left over pollen, and fertilize themselves,\r\nobviously the next best thing for them to do. How one's reverence\r\nincreases when one begins to understand, be it ever so little of,\r\nthe divine plan!\r\n\r\n\"Probably the most striking blue and purple wild flowers we\r\nhave,\" says John Burroughs, \"are of European origin. These\r\ncolors, except with the fall asters and gentians, seem rather\r\nunstable in our flora.\" This theory is certainly borne out in the\r\ncase of the RAMPION, EUROPEAN, or CREEPING BELLFLOWER (C.\r\nrapunculoides), now detected in the act of escaping from gardens\r\nfrom New Brunswick to Ontario, Southern New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nand Ohio, and making itself very much at home in our fields and\r\nalong the waysides. Compared with the delicate little harebell,\r\nit is a plant of rank, rigid habit. Its erect, rather stout stem,\r\nset with elongated oval, hairy, alternate leaves, and crowned\r\nwith a one-sided raceme of widely expanded, purple-blue bells\r\nrising about two feet above the ground, has little of the\r\nexquisite grace of its cousin. It blooms from July to September.\r\nThis is the species whose roots are eaten by the omnivorous\r\nEuropean peasant.\r\n\r\nOne of the few native campanulas, the TALL BELLFLOWER (C.\r\nAmericana), waves long, slender wands studded with blue or\r\nsometimes whitish flowers high above the ground of moist thickets\r\nand woods throughout the eastern half of this country, but rarely\r\nnear the sea. Doubtless the salt air, which intensifies the color\r\nof so many flowers, would brighten its rather slatey blue. The\r\ncorolla, which is flat, round, about an inch across, and deeply\r\ncleft into five pointed petals, has the effect of a miniature\r\npinwheel in motion. Mature flowers have the style elongated, bent\r\ndownward, then curved upward, that the stigmas may certainly be\r\nin the way of the visiting insect pollen-laden from an earlier\r\nbloomer, and be cross-fertilized. The larger bees, its\r\nbenefactors, which visit it for nectar, touch only the upper side\r\nof the style, on which they must alight; but the anthers waste\r\npollen by shedding it on all sides. No insect can take shelter\r\nfrom rain or pass the night in this flower, as he frequently does\r\nin its more hospitable relative, the harebell. English gardeners,\r\nmore appreciative than our own of our native flora, frequently\r\nutilize this charming plant in their rockwork, increasing their\r\nstock by a division of the dense, leafy rosettes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENUS' LOOKING-GLASS; CLASPING BELLFLOWER\r\n  (Legouzia perfoliata; Specularia perfoliata of Gray)\r\nBellflower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Violet blue, from 1/2 to 3/4 in. across; solitary or 2\r\nor 3 together, seated, in axils of upper leaves. Calyx lobes\r\nvarying from 3 to 5 in earlier and later flowers, acute, rigid;\r\ncorolla a 5-spoked wheel; 5 stamens; pistil with 3 stigmas. Stem:\r\n6 in. to 2 ft. long, hairy, densely leafy, slender, weak. Leaves:\r\nRound, clasped about stem by heart-shaped base.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sterile waste places, dry woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - From British Columbia, Oregon, and Mexico, east to\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nAt the top of a gradually lengthened and apparently overburdened\r\nleafy stalk, weakly leaning upon surrounding vegetation, a few\r\nperfect blossoms spread their violet wheels, while below them\r\ninsignificant earlier flowers, which, although they have never\r\nopened, nor reared their heads above the hollows of the little\r\nshell-like leaves where they lie secluded, have, nevertheless,\r\nbeen producing seed without imported pollen while their showy\r\nsisters slept. But the later blooms, by attracting insects, set\r\ncross-fertilized seed to counteract any evil tendencies that\r\nmight weaken the species if it depended upon self-fertilization\r\nonly. When the European Venus' looking-glass used to be\r\ncultivated in gardens here, our grandmothers tell us it was\r\naltogether too prolific, crowding out of existence its less\r\nfruitful, but more lovely, neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe SMALL VENUS' LOOKING-GLASS (L. biflora), of similar habit to\r\nthe preceding, but with egg-shaped or oblong leaves seated on,\r\nnot clasping, its smooth and very slender stem, grows in the\r\nSouth and westward to California.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT LOBELIA; BLUE CARDINAL-FLOWER\r\n  (Lobelia syphilitica)  Bellflower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright blue, touched with white, fading to pale blue,\r\nabout 1 in. long, borne on tall, erect, leafy spike. Calyx\r\n5-parted, the lobes sharply cut, hairy. Corolla tubular, open to\r\nbase on one side, 2-lipped, irregularly 5-lobed, the petals\r\npronounced at maturity only. Stamens 5, united by their hairy\r\nanthers into a tube around the style; larger anthers smooth.\r\nStem: 1 to 3 ft. high, stout, simple, leafy, slightly hairy.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, oblong, tapering, pointed, irregularly\r\ntoothed, 2 to 6 in. long, 1/2 to 2 in. wide.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist or wet soil; beside streams.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October\r\nDistribution - Ontario and northern United States west to Dakota,\r\nsouth to Kansas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nTo the evolutionist, ever on the lookout for connecting links,\r\nthe lobelias form an interesting group, because their corolla,\r\nslit down the upper side and somewhat flattened, shows the\r\nbeginning of the tendency toward the strap or ray flowers that\r\nare nearly confined to the composites of much later development,\r\nof course, than tubular single blossoms. Next to massing their\r\nflowers in showy heads, as the composites do, the lobelias have\r\nthe almost equally advantageous plan of crowding theirs along a\r\nstem so as to make a conspicuous advertisement to attract the\r\npassing bee and to offer him the special inducement of numerous\r\nfeeding places close together.\r\n\r\nThe handsome GREAT LOBELIA, constantly and invidiously compared\r\nwith its gorgeous sister the cardinal flower, suffers unfairly.\r\nWhen asked what his favorite color was, Eugene Field replied:\r\n\"Why, I like any color at all so long as it's red!\" Most men, at\r\nleast, agree with him, and certainly hummingbirds do; our\r\nscarcity of red flowers being due, we must believe, to the\r\nscarcity of hummingbirds, which chiefly fertilize them. But how\r\nbees love the blue blossoms!\r\n\r\nThere are many cases where the pistil of a flower necessarily\r\ncomes in contact with its own pollen, yet fertilization does not\r\ntake place, however improbable this may appear. Most orchids, for\r\nexample, are not susceptible to their own pollen. It would seem\r\nas if our lobelia, in elevating its stigma through the ring\r\nformed by the united anthers, must come in contact with some of\r\nthe pollen they have previously discharged from their tips, not\r\nonly on the bumblebee that shakes it out of them when he jars the\r\nflower, but also within the tube. But when the anthers are\r\nmature, the two lobes of the still immature stigma are pressed\r\ntogether, and cannot be fertilized. Nevertheless, the hairy tips\r\nof some of the anthers brush off the pollen grains that may have\r\nlodged on the stigma as it passes through the ring in its ascent,\r\nthus making surety doubly sure. Only after the stigma projects\r\nbeyond the ring of anthers does it expand its lobes, which are\r\nnow ready to receive pollen brought from another later flower by\r\nthe incoming bumblebee to which it is adapted.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus named this group of plants for Matthias de l'Obel, a\r\nFlemish botanist, or herbalist more likely, who became physician\r\nto James I. of England.\r\n\r\nPreferably in dry, sandy soil or in meadows, and over a wide\r\nrange, the slender, straight shoots of PALE SPIKED LOBELIA (L.\r\nspicata) bloom early and throughout the summer months, the\r\ninflorescence itself sometimes reaching a height of two feet. At\r\nthe base of the plant there is usually a tuft of broadly oblong\r\nleaves; those higher up narrow first into spoon-shaped, then into\r\npointed, bracts, along the thick and gradually lengthened spike\r\nof scattered bloom. The flowers are oft en pale enough to be\r\ncalled white. Like their relatives, they first ripen their\r\nanthers to prevent self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nThe lithe, graceful little BROOK LOBELIA (L. Kalmii), whose\r\nlight-blue flowers, at the end of thread-like footstems, form a\r\nloose raceme, sways with a company of its fellows among the grass\r\non wet banks, beside meadow runnels and brooks, particularly in\r\nlimestone soil, from Nova Scotia to the Northwest Territory and\r\nsouthward to New Jersey. It bears an insignificant capsule, not\r\ninflated like the Indian tobacco's; and long, narrow,\r\nspoon-shaped leaves. Twenty inches is the greatest height this\r\nlittle plant may hope to attain.\r\n\r\nNot only beside water, and in it, but often totally immersed,\r\ngrows the WATER LOBELIA or GLADIOLE (L. Dortmanna). The slender,\r\nhollow, smooth stem rises from a submerged tuft of round, hollow,\r\nfleshy leaves longitudinally divided by a partition, and bears at\r\nthe top a scattered array of pale-blue flowers from August to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN or WILD TOBACCO; GAG-ROOT; ASTHMA-WEED; BLADDER-POD\r\nLOBELIA\r\n  (Lobelia inflata)  Bellflower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale blue or violet, small, borne at short intervals in\r\nspike-like leafy racemes. Calyx 5-parted, its awl-shaped lobes\r\n1/4 in. long, or as long as the tubular, 2-lipped, 5-cleft,\r\ncorolla that opens to base of tube on upper side. Stamens, 5\r\nunited by their hairy anthers into a ring around the 2-lobed\r\nstyle. Stem: From 1 to 3 feet high, hairy, very acrid, much\r\nbranched, leafy. Leaves: Alternate, oblong or ovate, toothed, the\r\nupper ones acute, seated on stem; lower ones obtuse, petioled, to\r\n2 1/2 in. long. Fruit: A much inflated, rounded, ribbed, many\r\nseeded capsule.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields and thickets; poor soil.\r\nFlowering Season - July-November.\r\nDistribution - Labrador westward to the Missouri River, south to\r\nArkansas and Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe most stupid of the lower animals knows enough to let this\r\npoisonous, acrid plant alone; but not so man, who formerly made a\r\nquack medicine from it in the days when a drug that set one's\r\ninternal organism on fire was supposed to be especially\r\nbeneficial. One taste of the plant gives a realizing sense of its\r\nvalue as an emetic. How the red man enjoyed smoking and chewing\r\nthe bitter leaves, except for the drowsiness that followed, is a\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nOn account of the smallness of its flowers and their scantiness,\r\nthe Indian tobacco is perhaps the least attractive of the\r\nlobelias, none of which has so inflated a seed vessel, the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic of this common plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICORY; SUCCORY; BLUE SAILORS; BUNK\r\n  (Cichorium Intybus)  Chicory family\r\n\r\nFlower-head - Bright, deep azure to gray blue, rarely pinkish or\r\nwhite, 1 to 1 1/2 in. broad, set close to stem, often in small\r\nclusters for nearly the entire length; each head a composite of\r\nray flowers only, 5-toothed at upper edge, and set in a flat\r\ngreen receptacle. Stem: Rigid, branching, to 3 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nLower ones spreading on ground, 3 to 6 in. long, spatulate, with\r\ndeeply cut or irregular edges, narrowed into petioles, from a\r\ndeep tap-root; upper leaves of stem and branches minute,\r\nbract-like.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, waste places, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribuition - Common in Eastern United States and Canada, south\r\nto the Carolinas; also sparingly westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nAt least the dried and ground root of this European invader is\r\nknown to hosts of people who buy it undisguised or not, according\r\nas they count it an improvement to their coffee or a disagreeable\r\nadulterant. So great is the demand for chicory that,\r\nnotwithstanding its cheapness, it is often in its turn\r\nadulterated with roasted wheat, rye, acorns, and carrots. Forced\r\nand blanched in a warm, dark place, the bitter leaves find a\r\nready market as a salad known as \"barbe de Capucin\" by the\r\nfanciful French. Endive and dandelion, the chicory's relatives,\r\nappear on the table too, in spring, where people have learned the\r\npossibilities of salads, as they certainly have in Europe.\r\n\r\n>From the depth to which the tap-root penetrates, it is not\r\nunlikely the succory derived its name from the Latin succurrere =\r\nto run under. The Arabic name chicourey testifies to the almost\r\nuniversal influence of Arabian physicians and writers in Europe\r\nafter the Conquest. As chicoree, achicoria, chicoria, cicorea,\r\nchicorie, cichorei, cikorie, tsikorei, and cicorie the plant is\r\nknown respectively to the French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italians,\r\nGermans, Dutch, Swedes, Russians, and Danes.\r\n\r\nOn cloudy days or in the morning only throughout midsummer the\r\n\"peasant posy\" opens its \"dear blue eyes\"\r\n\r\n     \"Where tired feet\r\n      Toil to and fro;\r\n      Where flaunting Sin\r\n      May see thy heavenly hue,\r\n      Or weary Sorrow look from thee\r\n      Toward a tenderer blue!\"\r\n                          - Margaret Deland.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Humble Bee\" Emerson, too, sees only beauty in the\r\n\"Succory to match the sky;\" but, mirabile dictu, Vergil, rarely\r\ncaught in a prosaic, practical mood, wrote, \"And spreading\r\nsucc'ry chokes the rising field.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON-WEED; FLAT TOP\r\n  (Vernonia Noveboracensis)  Thistle family.\r\n\r\nFlower-head - Composite of tubular florets only, intense\r\nreddish-purple thistle-like heads, borne on short, branched\r\npeduncles and forming broad, flat clusters; bracts of involucre,\r\nbrownish purple, tipped with awl-shaped bristles. Stem: 3 to 9\r\nft. high, rough or hairy, branched. Leaves: Alternate, narrowly\r\noblong or lanceolate, saw-edged, 3 to 10 in. long, rough.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, meadows, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Massachusetts to Georgia, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nEmerson says a weed is a plant whose virtues we have not yet\r\ndiscovered; but surely it is no small virtue in the iron-weed to\r\nbrighten the roadsides and low meadows throughout the summer with\r\nbright clusters of bloom. When it is on the wane, the asters, for\r\nwhich it is sometimes mistaken, begin to appear, but an instant's\r\ncomparison shows the difference between the two flowers. After\r\nnoting the yellow disk in the center of an aster, it is not\r\nlikely the iron-weed's thistle-like head of ray florets only will\r\never again be confused with it. Another rank-growing neighbor\r\nwith which it has been confounded by the novice is the Joe Pye\r\nweed, a far paler, pinkish flower.\r\n\r\nTo each tiny floret, secreting nectar in its tube, many insects,\r\nattracted by the bright color of the iron-weed standing high\r\nabove surrounding vegetation, come to feast. Long-lipped bees and\r\nflies rest awhile for refreshment, but butterflies of many\r\nbeautiful kinds are by far the most abundant visitors. Pollen\r\ncarried out by the long, hairy styles as they extend to maturity\r\nmust attach itself to their tongues. The tiger swallow-tail\r\nbutterfly appears to have a special preference for this flower.\r\n(See Self-Heal.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON or SCALY BLAZING STAR; COLIC-ROOT; RATTLESNAKE MASTER;\r\nBUTTON SNAKEROOT\r\n  (Lacinaria squarrosa; Liatris squarrosa of Gray)  Thistle\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Composite, about 1 in. long, bright purple or rose\r\npurple, of tubular florets only, from an involucre of\r\noverlapping, rigid, pointed bracts; each of the few flower-heads\r\nfrom the leaf axils along a slender stem in a wand-like raceme.\r\nStem: 1/2 to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Alternate, narrow, entire.\r\nPreferred habitat - Dry, rich soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the top, the apparently fringed flower-heads open\r\ndownward along the wand, whose length depends upon the richness\r\nof the soil. All of the flowers are perfect and attract\r\nlong-tongued bees and flies (especially Exoprosopa fasciata) and\r\nbutterflies, which, as they sip from the corolla tube, receive\r\nthe pollen carried out and exposed on the long divisions of the\r\nstyle. Some people have pretended to cure rattlesnake bites with\r\napplications of the globular tuber of this and the next species.\r\n\r\nThe LARGE BUTTON SNAKEROOT, BLUE BLAZING STAR, or GAY FEATHER (L.\r\nscariosa), may attain six feet, but usually not more than half\r\nthat height; and its round flower-heads normally stand well away\r\nfrom the stout stem on foot-stems of their own. The bristling\r\nscales of the involucre, often tinged with purple at the tips,\r\nare a conspicuous feature. With much the same range and choice of\r\nhabitat as the last species, this Blazing Star is a later\r\nbloomer, coming into flower in August, and helping the goldenrods\r\nand asters brighten the landscape throughout the early autumn.\r\nThe name of gay feather, miscellaneously applied to several\r\nblazing stars, is especially deserved by this showy beauty of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nUnlike others of its class, the DENSE BUTTON SNAKEROOT, DEVIL'S\r\nBIT, ROUGH or BACKACHE ROOT, PRAIRIE PINE or THROATWORT (L.\r\nspicata), the commonest species we have, chooses moist soil, even\r\nsalt marshes near the coast, and low meadows throughout a range\r\nnearly corresponding with that of the scaly blazing star.\r\nResembling its relatives in general manner of growth, we note\r\nthat its oblong involucre, rounded at the base, has blunt, not\r\nsharply pointed, bracts; that the flower-heads are densely set\r\nclose to the wand for from four to fifteen inches; that the five\r\nto thirteen bright rose-purple florets which compose each head\r\noccasionally come white; that its leaves are long and very\r\nnarrow, and that October is not too late to find the plant in\r\nbloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE and PURPLE ASTERS or STARWORTS\r\n  Thistle family\r\n\r\nEvolution teaches us that thistles, daisies, sunflowers, asters,\r\nand all the triumphant horde of composites were once very\r\ndifferent flowers from what we see today. Through ages of natural\r\nselection of the fittest among their ancestral types, having\r\nfinally arrived at the most successful adaptation of their\r\nvarious parts to their surroundings in the whole floral kingdom,\r\nthey are now overrunning the earth. Doubtless the aster's remote\r\nancestors were simple green leaves around the vital organs, and\r\ndepended upon the wind, as the grasses do - a most extravagant\r\nmethod - to transfer their pollen. Then some rudimentary flower\r\nchanged its outer row of stamens into petals, which gradually\r\ntook on color to attract insects and insure a more economical\r\nmethod of transfer. Gardeners today take advantage of a blossom's\r\nnatural tendency to change stamens into petals when they wish to\r\nproduce double flowers. As flowers and insects developed side by\r\nside, and there came to be a better and better understanding\r\nbetween them of each other's requirements, mutual adaptation\r\nfollowed. The flower that offered the best advertisement, as the\r\ncomposites do, by its showy rays; that secreted nectar in tubular\r\nflowers where no useless insect could pilfer it; that fastened\r\nits stamens to the inside wall of the tube where they must dust\r\nwith pollen the underside of every insect, unwittingly\r\ncross-fertilizing the blossom as he crawled over it; that massed\r\na great number of these tubular florets together where insects\r\nmight readily discover them and feast with the least possible\r\nloss of time - this flower became the winner in life's race.\r\nSmall wonder that our June fields are white with daisies and the\r\nautumn landscape is glorified with goldenrod and asters!\r\n\r\nSince North America boasts the greater part of the two hundred\r\nand fifty asters named by scientists, and as variations in many\r\nof our common species frequently occur, the tyro need expect no\r\neasy task in identifying every one he meets afield. However, the\r\nfollowing are possible acquaintances to everyone:\r\n\r\nIn dry, shady places the LARGE or BROAD-LEAVED ASTER (A.\r\nmacrophyllus), so called from its three or four conspicuous,\r\nheart-shaped leaves on long petioles, in a clump next the ground,\r\nmay be more easily identified by these than by the pale lavender\r\nor violet flower-heads of about sixteen rays each which crown its\r\nreddish angular stem in August and September. The disk turns\r\nreddish brown.\r\n\r\nIn prairie soil, especially about the edges of woods in western\r\nNew York, southward and westward to Texas and Minnesota, the\r\nbeautiful SKY-BLUE ASTER (A. azureus) blooms from August till\r\nafter frost. Its slender, stiff, rough stem branches above to\r\ndisplay the numerous bright blue flowers, whose ten to twenty\r\nrays measure only about a quarter of an inch in length. The upper\r\nleaves are reduced to small flat bracts; the next are linear; and\r\nthe lower ones, which approach a heart shape, are rough on both\r\nsides, and may be five or six inches long.\r\n\r\nMuch more branched and bushy is the COMMON BLUE, BRANCHING, WOOD,\r\nor HEART-LEAVED ASTER (A. cordifolius), whose generous masses of\r\nsmall, pale lavender flower-heads look like a mist hanging from\r\none to five feet above the earth in and about the woods and shady\r\nroadsides from September even to December in favored places.\r\n\r\nThe WAVY or VARIOUS-LEAVED ASTER or SMALL FLEABANE (A. undulatus)\r\nhas a stiff, rough, hairy, widely branching stalk, whose thick,\r\nrough lowest leaves are heart-shaped and set on long foot-stems;\r\nabove these, the leaves have shorter stems, dilating where they\r\nclasp the stalk; the upper leaves, lacking stems, are seated on\r\nit, while those of the branches are shaped like tiny awls. The\r\nflowers, which measure less than an inch across, often grow along\r\none side of an axis as well as in the usual raceme. Eight to\r\nfifteen pale blue to violet rays surround the disks which, yellow\r\nat first, become reddish brown in maturity. We find the plant in\r\ndry soil, blooming in September and October.\r\n\r\nBy no means tardy, the LATE PURPLE ASTER, so-called, or PURPLE\r\nDAISY (A. patens), begins to display its purplish-blue,\r\ndaisy-like flower-heads early in August, and farther north may be\r\nfound in dry, exposed places only until October. Rarely the\r\nsolitary flowers, that are an inch across or more, are a deep,\r\nrich violet. The twenty to thirty rays which surround the disk,\r\ncurling inward to dry, expose the vase-shaped, green, shingled\r\ncups that terminate each little branch. The thick, somewhat\r\nrigid, oblong leaves, tapering at the tip, broaden at the base to\r\nclasp the rough, slender stalk. Range similar to the next\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nCertainly from Massachusetts, northern New York, and Minnesota\r\nsouthward to the Gulf of Mexico one may expect to find the NEW\r\nENGLAND ASTER or STARWORT (A. Novae-Angliae) one of the most\r\nstriking and widely distributed of the tribe, in spite of its\r\nlocal name. It is not unknown in Canada. The branching clusters\r\nof violet or magenta-purple flower-heads, from one to two inches\r\nacross - composites containing as many as forty to fifty purple\r\nray florets around a multitude of perfect five-lobed, tubular,\r\nyellow disk florets in a sticky cup - shine out with royal\r\nsplendor above the swamps, moist fields, and roadsides from\r\nAugust to October. The stout, bristle-hairy stem bears a quantity\r\nof alternate lance-shaped leaves lobed at the base where they\r\nclasp it.\r\n\r\nIn even wetter ground we find the RED-STALKED, PURPLE-STEMMED, or\r\nEARLY PURPLE ASTER, COCASH, SWANWEED, or MEADOW SCABISH (A.\r\npuniceus) blooming as early as July or as late as November. Its\r\nstout, rigid stem, bristling with rigid hairs, may reach a height\r\nof eight feet to display the branching clusters of pale violet or\r\nlavender flowers. The long, blade-like leaves, usually very rough\r\nabove and hairy along the midrib beneath, are seated on the stem.\r\nThe lovely SMOOTH or BLUE ASTER (A. laevis), whose sky-blue or\r\nviolet flower-heads, about one inch broad, are common through\r\nSeptember and October in dry soil and open woods, has strongly\r\nclasping, oblong, tapering leaves, rough margined, but rarely\r\nwith a saw-tooth, toward the top of the stem, while those low\r\ndown on it gradually narrow into clasping wings.\r\n\r\nIn dry, sandy soil, mostly near the coast, from Massachusetts to\r\nDelaware, grows one of the loveliest of all this beautiful clan,\r\nthe LOW, SHOWY, or SEASIDE PURPLE ASTER (A. spectabilis). The\r\nstiff, usually unbranched stem does its best in attaining a\r\nheight of two feet. Above, the leaves are blade-like or narrowly\r\noblong, seated on the stem, whereas the tapering, oval basal\r\nleaves are furnished with long footstems, as is customary with\r\nmost asters. The handsome, bright, violet-purple flower-heads,\r\nmeasuring about an inch and a half across, have from fifteen to\r\nthirty rays, or only about half as many as the familiar New\r\nEngland aster. Season August to November.\r\n\r\nThe low-growing BOG ASTER (A. nemoralis), not to be confused with\r\nthe much taller Red-stalked species often found growing in the\r\nsame swamp, and having, like it, flower-heads measuring about an\r\ninch and a half across, has rays that vary from light violet\r\npurple to rose pink. Its oblong to lance-shaped leaves, only two\r\ninches long at best, taper to a point at both ends, and are\r\nseated on the stem. We look for this aster in sandy bogs from New\r\nJersey northward and westward during August and September.\r\n\r\nThe STIFF or SAVORY-LEAVED ASTER, SANDPAPER, or PINE STARWORT\r\n(Ionactis linariifolius), now separated from the other asters\r\ninto a genus by itself, is a low, branching little plant with no\r\nbasal leaves, but some that are very narrow and blade-like,\r\nrigid, entire and one-nerved, ascending the stiff stems. The\r\nleaves along the branches are minute and awl-shaped, like those\r\non a branch of pine. Only from ten to fifteen violet ray flowers\r\n(pistillate) surround the perfect disk florets. From Quebec to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico, and westward beyond the Mississippi this prim\r\nlittle shrub grows in tufts on dry or rocky soil, and blooms from\r\nJuly to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBIN'S, or POOR ROBIN'S, or ROBERT'S PLANTAIN; BLUE SPRING\r\nDAISY; DAISY-LEAVED FLEABANE\r\n  (Erigeron pulchellus; E. bellifolium of Gray)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Composite, daisy-like, 1 to 1/2 in. across; the\r\nouter circle of about 50 pale bluish-violet ray florets; the disk\r\nflorets greenish yellow. Stem: Simple, erect, hairy, juicy,\r\nflexible, from 10 in. to 2 ft. high, producing runners and\r\noffsets from base. Leaves: Spatulate, in a flat tuft about the\r\nroot; stem leaves narrow, more acute, seated, or partly clasping.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist ground, hills, banks, grassy fields.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - United States and Canada, east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nLike an aster blooming long before its season, Robin's plantain\r\nwears a finely cut lavender fringe around a yellow disk of minute\r\nflorets; but one of the first, not the last, in the long\r\nprocession of composites has appeared when we see gay companies\r\nof these flowers nodding their heads above the grass in the\r\nspring breezes as if they were village gossips.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was the necessity for attracting insects which led\r\nthe Robin's plantain and other composites to group a quantity of\r\nminute florets, each one of which was once an independent,\r\ndetached blossom, into a common head. In union there is strength.\r\nEach floret still contains, however, its own tiny drop of nectar,\r\nits own stamens, its own pistil connected with embryonic seed\r\nbelow; therefore, when an insect alights where he can get the\r\ngreatest amount of nectar for the least effort, and turns round\r\nand round to exhaust each nectary, he is sure to dust the pistils\r\nwith pollen, and so fertilize an entire flower-head in a trice.\r\nThe lavender fringe and the hairy involucre and stem serve the\r\nend of discouraging crawling insects, which cannot transfer\r\npollen from plant to plant, from pilfering sweets that cannot be\r\nproperly paid for. Small wonder that, although the composites\r\nhave attained to their socialistic practices at a comparatively\r\nrecent day as evolutionists count time, they have become as\r\nindividuals and as species the most numerous in the world; the\r\nthistle family, dominant everywhere, containing not less than ten\r\nthousand members.\r\n\r\nCOMMON or PHILADELPHIA FLEABANE, or SKEVISH (E. Philadelphicus),\r\na smaller edition of Robin's plantain, with a more findely cut\r\nfringe, its reddish-purple ray florets often numbering one\r\nhundred and fifty, may be found in low fields and woods\r\nthroughout North America, except in the circumpolar regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHISTLES\r\n  (Carduus)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nIs land fulfilling the primal curse because it brings forth\r\nthistles? So thinks the farmer, no doubt, but not the goldfinches\r\nwhich daintily feed among the fluffy seeds, nor the bees, nor the\r\n\"painted lady,\" which may be seen in all parts of the world where\r\nthistles grow, hovering about the beautiful rose-purple flowers.\r\nIn the prickly cradle of leaves, the caterpillar of this thistle\r\nbutterfly weaves a web around its main food store.\r\n\r\nWhen the Danes invaded Scotland, they stole a silent night march\r\nupon the Scottish camp by marching barefoot; but a Dane\r\ninadvertently stepped on a thistle, and his sudden, sharp cry,\r\narousing the sleeping Scots, saved them and their country: hence\r\nthe Scotch emblem.\r\n\r\n>From July to November blooms the COMMON, BURR, SPEAR, PLUME,\r\nBANK, HORSE, BULL, BLUE, BUTTON, BELL, or ROADSIDE THISTLE\r\n(C. lanceolatus or Circium lanceolatum of Gray), a native of\r\nEurope and Asia, now a most thoroughly naturalized American from\r\nNewfoundland to Georgia, westward to Nebraska. Its violet\r\nflower-heads, about an inch and a half across, and as high as\r\nwide, are mostly solitary at the ends of formidable branches, up\r\nwhich few crawling creatures venture. But in the deep tube of\r\neach floret there is nectar secreted for the flying visitor who\r\ncan properly transfer pollen from flower to flower. Such a one\r\nsuffers no inconvenience from the prickles, but, on the contrary,\r\nfinds a larger feast saved for him because of them. Dense,\r\nmatted, wool-like hairs, that cover the bristling stems of most\r\nthistles, make climbing mighty unpleasant for ants, which ever\r\ndelight in pilfering sweets. Perhaps one has the temerity to\r\nstart upward.\r\n\r\n     \"Fain would I climb, yet fear to fall.\"\r\n     \"If thy heart fail thee, climb not at all,\"\r\n\r\nmight be the ant's passionate outburst to the thistle, and the\r\nthistle's reply, instead of a Sir Walter and Queen Elizabeth\r\ncouplet. Long, lance-shaped, deeply cleft, sharply pointed, and\r\nprickly dark green leaves make the ascent almost unendurable;\r\nnevertheless the ant bravely mounts to where the bristle-pointed,\r\noverlapping scales of the deep green cup hold the luscious\r\nflowers. Now his feet becoming entangled in the cottony fibers\r\nwound about the scaly armor, and a bristling bodyguard thrusting\r\nspears at him in his struggles to escape, death happily releases\r\nhim. All this tragedy to insure the thistle's cross-fertilized\r\nseed that, seated on the autumn winds, shall be blown far and\r\nwide in quest of happy conditions for the offspring!\r\n\r\nSometimes the PASTURE or FRAGRANT THISTLE (C. odoratus or C.\r\npumilum of Gray) still further protects its beautiful, odorous\r\npurple or whitish flower-head, that often measures three inches\r\nacross, with a formidable array of prickly small leaves just\r\nbelow it. In case a would-be pilferer breaks through these lines,\r\nhowever, there is a slight glutinous strip on the outside of the\r\nbracts that compose the cup wherein the nectar-filled florets are\r\npacked; and here, in sight of Mecca, he meets his death, just as\r\na bird is caught on limed twigs. The pasture thistle, whose range\r\nis only from Maine to Delaware, blooms from July to September.\r\n\r\nEven gentle Professor Gray hurls anathema at the CANADA THISTLE;\r\n\"a vile pest\" he calls it. As CURSED, CORN, HARD, and CREEPING\r\nTHISTLE it is variously known here and in Europe, whence it came\r\nto overrun our land from Newfoundland to Virginia, westward to\r\nNebraska. By horizontal rootstocks it creeps and forms patches\r\nalmost impossible to eradicate. The small reddish-purple\r\nflower-heads, barely an inch across, usually contain about a\r\nhundred florets each. In their tubes the abundant nectar rises\r\nhigh, so that numerous insects, even with the shortest tongues,\r\nare able to enjoy it. Not only bees and butterflies, but wasps,\r\nflies, and beetles feast diligently. When a floret opens, a\r\nquantity of pollen emerges at the upper end of the anther\r\ncylinder, pressed up by the growing style. Owing to their slight\r\nstickiness and the sharp processes over their entire surface, the\r\npollen grains, which readily cling to the hairs of insects, are\r\ntransported to the two-branched, hairy stigma of an older floret.\r\nBut even should insects not visit the flower (and in fine weather\r\nthey swarm about it), it is marvelously adapted to fertilize\r\nitself. Farmers may well despair of exterminating a plant so\r\nperfectly equipped in every part; to win life's battles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The colour of purple...was, amongst the ancients, typical of\r\nroyalty. It was a kind of red richly shot with blue, and the dye\r\nproducing it was attained from a shell found in considerable\r\nnumbers off the coast of Tyre, and on the shore near the site of\r\nthat ancient city, great heaps of such shells are still to be\r\nfound. The production of the true royal purple dye was a very\r\ncostly affair, and therefore it was often imitated with a mixture\r\nof cochineal and indigo...\" - J. JAMES TISSOT.\r\n\r\nAs many so-called purple flowers are more strictly magenta, the\r\nreader is referred to the next group if he has not found the\r\nflower for which he is in search here. Also to the \"White and\r\nGreenish\" section since many colored flowers show a tendency to\r\nrevert to the white type from which, doubtless, all were evolved.\r\nHe should remember that all flowers are more or less variable in\r\nshade, according to varying conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGENTA TO PINK FLOWERS\r\n\r\n\"Botany is a sequel of murder and a chronicle of the dead.\" -\r\nJULIAN HAWTHORNE.\r\n\r\n\"A plant is not to be studied as an absolutely dead thing, but\r\nrather as a sentient being.... To measure petals, to count\r\nstamens, to describe pistils without reference to their\r\nfunctions, or the why and wherefore of their existence, is to\r\ncontent one's self with husks in the presence of a feast of\r\nfatness - to listen to the rattle of dry bones rather than the\r\nheavenly harmonies of life. We have reason to be profoundly\r\nthankful for the signs to be seen on every side, that the dreary\r\nstuff which was called botany in the teaching of the past will\r\nsoon cease to masquerade in its stolen costume, and that our\r\nchildren and our children's children will study not dried\r\nspecimens or drier books, but the living things which Nature\r\nfurnishes in such profusion....\r\n\r\n\"The reason of this radical change is not far to seek. Since man\r\nhas learned that the universal brotherhood of life includes\r\nhimself as the highest link in the chain of organic creation, his\r\ninterest in all things that live and move and have a being has\r\ngreatly increased. The movements of the monad now appeal to him\r\nin a way that was impossible under the old conceptions. He sees\r\nin each of the millions of living forms with which the earth is\r\nteeming, the action of many of the laws which are operating in\r\nhimself; and has learned that to a great extent his welfare is\r\ndependent on these seemingly insignificant relations; that in\r\nways undreamed of a century ago they affect human progress.\" -\r\nCLARENCE MOORES WEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGENTA TO PINK FLOWERS\r\n\r\nSESSILE-LEAVED TWISTED-STALK\r\n  (Streptopus roseus)  Lily-of-the-Valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull, purplish pink, 1/2 in. long or less, solitary, on\r\nthreadlike, curved footstalks longer than the small flower\r\nitself, nodding from leaf-axils. Perianth bill-shaped, of 6\r\nspreading segments; stamens 6, 2-horned; style spreading into 3\r\nbranches, stigmatic on inner side. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high,\r\nsimple or forked. Leaves: Thin, alternate, green on both sides,\r\nmany nerved, tapering at end, rounded at base, where they are\r\nseated on stem. Fruit: A round, red, many-seeded berry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - North America east and west, southward to Georgia\r\nand Oregon.\r\n\r\nAs we look down on this graceful plant, no blossoms are visible;\r\nbut if we bend the zig-zagged stem backward, we shall discover\r\nthe little rosy bells swaying from the base of the leaves on\r\ncurved footstalks (streptos = twisted, pous = a foot or stalk)\r\nvery much as the plant's relatives the Solomon's seals grow. In\r\nthe confident expectation of having its seeds dropped far and\r\nwide, it bears showy red berries in August for the birds now\r\nwandering through the woods with increased, hungry families.\r\n\r\nThe CLASPING-LEAVED TWISTED-STALK (S. amplexifolius), which has\r\none or two greenish-white bells nodding from its axils, may be\r\ndistinguished when not in flower by its leaves, which are hoary -\r\nnot green - on the under side, or by its oval berry. Indeed most\r\nplants living in wet soil have a coating of down on the under\r\nsides of their leaves to prevent the pores from clogging with\r\nrising vapors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOCCASIN FLOWER; PINK, VENUS', or STEMLESS LADY'S SLIPPER\r\n  (Cypripedium acaule)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fragrant, solitary, large, showy, drooping from end of\r\nscape, 6 to 12 in. high. Sepals lance-shaped, spreading, greenish\r\npurple, 2 in. long or less; petals narrower and longer than\r\nsepals. Lip an inflated sac, often over 2 in. long, slit down the\r\nmiddle, and folded inwardly above, pale magenta, veined with\r\ndarker pink upper part of interior crested with long white hairs.\r\nStamens united with style into unsymmetrical declined column,\r\nbearing an anther on either side, and a dilated triangular\r\npetal-like sterile stamen above, arching over the broad concave\r\nstigma. Leaves: 2, from the base; elliptic, thick, 6 to 8 in.\r\nlong.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Deep, rocky, or sandy woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Canada southward to North Carolina, westward to\r\nMinnesota and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nBecause most people cannot forbear picking this exquisite flower\r\nthat seems too beautiful to be found outside a millionaire's\r\nhothouse, it is becoming rarer every year, until the finding of\r\none in the deep forest, where it must now hide, has become the\r\nevent of a day's walk. Once it was the commonest of the orchids.\r\n\r\n\"Cross-fertilization,\" says Darwin, \"results in offspring which\r\nvanquish the offspring of self-fertilization in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\" This has been the motto of the orchid family for\r\nages. No group of plants has taken more elaborate precautions\r\nagainst self-pollination or developed more elaborate and\r\ningenious mechanism to compel insects to transfer their pollen\r\nthan this.\r\n\r\nThe fissure down the front of the pink lady's slipper is not so\r\nwide but that a bee must use some force to push against its\r\nelastic sloping sides and enter the large banquet chamber where\r\nhe finds generous entertainment secreted among the fine white\r\nhairs in the upper part. Presently he has feasted enough. Now one\r\ncan hear him buzzing about inside, trying to find a way out of\r\nthe trap. Toward the two little gleams of light through apertures\r\nat the end of a passage beyond the nectary hairs, he at length\r\nfinds his way. Narrower and narrower grows the passage until it\r\nwould seem as if he could never struggle through; nor can he\r\nuntil his back has rubbed along the sticky, overhanging stigma,\r\nwhich is furnished with minute, rigid, sharply pointed papillae,\r\nall directed forward, and placed there for the express purpose of\r\ncombing out the pollen he has brought from another flower on his\r\nback or head. The imported pollen having been safely removed, he\r\nstill has to struggle on toward freedom through one of the narrow\r\nopenings, where an anther almost blocks his way.\r\n\r\nAs he works outward, this anther, drawn downward on its hinge,\r\nplasters his back with yellow granular pollen as a parting gift,\r\nand away he flies to another lady's slipper to have it combed out\r\nby the sticky stigma as described above. The smallest bees can\r\nsqueeze through the passage without paying toll. To those of the\r\nAndrena and Halictus tribe the flower is evidently best adapted.\r\nSometimes the largest bumblebees, either unable or unwilling to\r\nget out by the legitimate route, bite their way to liberty.\r\nMutilated sacs are not uncommon. But when unable to get out by\r\nfair means, and too bewildered to escape by foul, the large bee\r\nmust sometimes perish miserably in his gorgeous prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWY, GAY, or SPRING ORCHIS\r\n  (Orchis spectabilis)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink, of deeper and lighter shade, the lower\r\nlip white, and thick of texture; from 3 to 6 on a spike;\r\nfragrant. Sepals pointed, united, arching above the converging\r\npetals, and resembling a hood; lip large, spreading, prolonged\r\ninto a spur, which is largest at the tip and as long as the\r\ntwisted footstem. Sterm: 4 to 12 in. high, thick, fleshy,\r\n5-sided. Leaves: 2 large, broadly ovate, glossy green, silvery on\r\nunder side, rising from a few scales from root. Fruit: A sharply\r\nangled capsule, 1 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods, especially under hemlocks.\r\nFlowering Season  - April-June.\r\nDistribution - From New Brunswick and Ontario southward to our\r\nSouthern States, westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nOf the six floral leaves which every orchid, terrestrial or\r\naerial, possesses, one is always peculiar in form, pouch-shaped,\r\nor a cornucopia filled with nectar, or a flaunted, fringed\r\nbanner, or a broad platform for the insect visitors to alight on.\r\nSome orchids look to imaginative eyes as if they were\r\nmasquerading in the disguise of bees, moths, frogs, birds,\r\nbutterflies. A number of these queer freaks are to be found in\r\nEurope. Spring traps, adhesive plasters, and hair-triggers\r\nattached to explosive shells of pollen are among the many devices\r\nby which orchids compel insects to cross-fertilize them, these\r\nflowers as a family showing the most marvelous mechanism adapted\r\nto their requirements from insects in the whole floral kingdom.\r\nNo other blossoms can so well afford to wear magenta, the ugliest\r\nshade nature produces, the \"lovely rosy purple\" of Dutch bulb\r\ngrowers, a color that has an unpleasant effect on not a few\r\nAmerican stomachs outside of Hoboken.\r\n\r\nBut an orchid, from the amazing cleverness of its operations, is\r\nattractive under any circumstances to whomever understands\r\nit. This earliest member of the family to appear charms the\r\nfemale bumblebee, to whose anatomy it is especially adapted. The\r\nmales, whose faces are hairy where the females' are bare, and\r\ntherefore not calculated to retain the sticky pollen masses, are\r\nnot yet flying when the showy orchis blooms. Bombus Americanorum,\r\nwhich can drain the longest spurs, B. separatus, B. terricola,\r\nand, rarely, butterflies as well, have been caught with its\r\npollen masses attached. The bee alights on the projecting lip,\r\npushes her head into the mouth of the corolla, and, as she sips\r\nthe nectar from the horn of plenty, ruptures by the slight\r\npressure a membrane of the pouch where two sticky buttons, to\r\nwhich two pollen masses are attached, lie imbedded. Instantly\r\nafter contact these adhere to the round bare spots on her face,\r\nthe viscid cement hardening before her head is fairly withdrawn.\r\nNow the diverging pollen masses, that look like antennae, fall\r\nfrom the perpendicular, by remarkable power of contraction, to a\r\nhorizontal attitude, that they may be in the precise position to\r\nfertilize the stigma of the next flower visited - just as if they\r\npossessed a reasoning intelligence! Even after all the pollen has\r\nbeen deposited on the sticky stigmas of various blossoms,\r\nstump-like caudicles to which the two little sacs were attached\r\nhave been found still plastered on a long-suffering bee. But so\r\nrich in nectar are the moisture-loving orchids that, to obtain a\r\ndraught, the sticky plasters which she must carry do not seem too\r\ndear a price to pay. In this showy orchis the nectar often rises\r\nan eighth of an inch in the tube, and sufficient pressure to\r\ncause a rupture will eject it a foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE or SWEET POGONIA; SNAKE-MOUTH\r\n  (Pogonia ophioglossoides)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale rose pink, fragrant, about  1 in. long, usually\r\nsolitary at end of stem 8 to 15 in. high, and subtended by a\r\nleaf-like bract. Sepals and petals equal, oval, about 1/2 in.\r\nlong, the lip spoon-shaped, crested, and fringed. Column shorter\r\nthan petals, thick, club-shaped. Anther terminal, attached to\r\nback of column, pollen mass in each of its 2 sacs. Stigma a\r\nflattened disk below anther. Leaves: 1 to 3, erect, lance-oblong,\r\nsometimes one with long footstem from fibrous root.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps and low meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Canada to Florida, westward to Kansas.\r\n\r\nRearing its head above the low sedges, often brightened with\r\ncolonies of the grass pink at the same time, this shy recluse of\r\nthe swamps woos the passing bee with lovely color, a fragrance\r\nlike fresh red raspberries, an alluring alighting place all\r\nfringed and crested, and with the prospect of hospitable\r\nentertainment in the nectary beyond. So in she goes, between the\r\nplatform and the column overhead, pushing first her head, then\r\nbrushing her back against the stigma just below the end of the\r\nthick column that almost closes the passage. Any powdery pollen\r\nshe brought on her back from another pogonia must now be brushed\r\noff against the sticky stigma. Her feast ended, out she backs.\r\nAnd now a wonderful thing happens. The lid of the anther which is\r\nat the end of the column, catching in her shoulders, swings\r\noutward on its elastic hinge, releasing a little shower of golden\r\ndust, which she must carry on the hairs of her head or back until\r\nthe sticky stigma of the next pogonia entered kindly wipes it\r\noff! This is one of the few orchids whose pollen, usually found\r\nin masses, is not united by threads. Without the bee's aid in\r\nreleasing it from its little box, the lovely species would\r\nquickly perish from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nARETHUSA; INDIAN PINK\r\n (Arethusa bulbosa)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - 1 to 2 in. long, bright purple pink, solitary, violet\r\nscented, rising from between a pair of small scales at end of\r\nsmooth scape from 5 to 10 in. high. Lip dropping beneath sepals\r\nand petals, broad, rounded, toothed, or fringed, blotched with\r\npurple, and with three hairy ridges down its surface. Leaf:\r\nSolitary, hidden at first, coming after the flower, but attaining\r\nlength of 6 in. Root: Bulbous. Fruit: A 6-ribbed capsule, 1 in.\r\nlong, rarely maturing.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Northern bogs and swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - From North Carolina and Indiana northward to the\r\nFur Countries.\r\n\r\nOne flower to a plant, and that one rarely maturing seed; a\r\ntemptingly beautiful prize which few refrain from carrying home,\r\nto have it wither on the way pursued by that more persistent\r\nlover than Alpheus, the orchid-hunter who exports the bulbs to\r\nEuropean collectors - little wonder this exquisite orchid is\r\nrare, and that from certain of those cranberry bogs of Eastern\r\nNew England, which it formerly brightened with its vivid pink, it\r\nhas now gone forever. Like Arethusa, the nymph whom Diana changed\r\ninto a fountain that she might escape from the infatuated river\r\ngod, Linnaeus fancied this flower a maiden in the midst of a\r\nspring bubbling from wet places where presumably none may follow\r\nher.\r\n\r\nBut the bee, our Arethusa's devoted lover, although no villain,\r\nstill pursues her. He knows that moisture-loving plants secrete\r\nthe most nectar. When the head of the bee enters the flower to\r\nsip, nothing happens; but as he raises his head to depart, it\r\ncannot help lifting the lid of the helmet-shaped anther and so\r\nletting fall a few soft pellets of pollen on it. Now, after he\r\nhas drained the next arethusa, his pollen-laden head must rub\r\nagainst the long sticky stigma before it touches the helmet-like\r\nanther lid and precipitates another volley of pollen. In some\r\nsuch manner most of our orchids compel insects to work for them\r\nin preventing self-fertilization.\r\n\r\nAnother charming, but much smaller, orchid, that we must don our\r\nrubber boots to find where it hides in cool, peaty bogs from\r\nCanada and the Northern United States to California, and\r\nsouthward in the Rockies to Arizona, is the CALYPSO (Calypso\r\nbulbosa). It is a solitary little flower, standing out from the\r\ntop of a jointed scape that never rises more than six inches from\r\nthe solid bulb, hidden in the moss, nor boasts more than one\r\nnearly round leaf near its base. The blossom itself suggests one\r\nof the lady's slipper orchids, with its rosy purple, narrow,\r\npointed sepals and petals clustered at the top above a large,\r\nsac-shaped, whitish lip. The latter is divided into two parts,\r\nheavily blotched with cinnamon brown, and woolly with a patch of\r\nyellow hairs near the point of the division. May - June.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALOPOGON; GRASS PINK\r\n  (Limodorum tuberosum; Calopogon pulchellus of Gray)  Orchid\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink, 1 in. long, 3 to 15 around a long, loose\r\nspike. Sepals and petals similar, oval, acute; the lip on upper\r\nside of flower is broad at the summit, tapering into a claw,\r\nflexible as if hinged, densely bearded on its face with white,\r\nyellow, and magenta hairs (Calopogon = beautiful beard). Column\r\nbelow lip (ovary not twisted in this exceptional case); sticky\r\nstigma at summit of column, and just below it a 2-celled anther,\r\neach cell containing 2 pollen masses, the grain lightly connected\r\nby threads. Scape: 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high, slender, naked. Leaf:\r\nSolitary, long, grass-like, from a round bulb arising from bulb\r\nof previous year.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, cranberry bogs, and low meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Florida, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nFortunately this lovely orchid, one of the most interesting of\r\nits highly organized family, is far from rare, and where we find\r\nthe rose pogonia and other bog-loving relatives growing, the\r\ncalopogon usually outnumbers them all. Limodorum translated reads\r\nmeadow-gift; but we find the flower less frequently in grassy\r\nplaces than those who have waded into its favorite haunts could\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nOwing to the crested lip being oddly situated on the upper part\r\nof the flower, which appears to be growing upside down in\r\nconsequence, one might suppose a visiting insect would not choose\r\nto alight on it. The pretty club-shaped, vari-colored hairs,\r\nwhich he may mistake for stamens, and which keep his feet from\r\nslipping, irresistibly invite him there, however, when, presto!\r\ndown drops the fringed lip with startling suddenness. Of course,\r\nthe bee strikes his back against the column when he falls. Now,\r\nthere are two slightly upturned little wings on either side of\r\nthe column, which keep his body from slipping off at either side\r\nand necessitate its exit from the end where the stigma smears it\r\nwith viscid matter. The pressure of the insect on this part\r\nstarts the pollen masses from their pocket just below; and as the\r\nbee slides off the end of the column, the exposed, cobwebby\r\nthreads to which the pollen grains are attached cling to his\r\nsticky body. The sticky substance instantly hardening, the pollen\r\nmasses, which are drawn out from their pocket as he escapes, are\r\ncemented to his abdomen in the precise spot where they must\r\nstrike against the stigma of the next calopogon he tumbles in;\r\nhence cross-fertilization results. What recompense does the bee\r\nget for such rough handling? None at all, so far as is known. The\r\nflower, which secretes no nectar, is doubtless one of those gay\r\ndeceivers that Sprengel named \"Scheinsaftblumen,\" only it leads\r\nits visitors to look for pollen instead of nectar, on the\r\nsupposition that the club-shaped hairs on the crests are stamens.\r\nThe wonder is that the intelligent little bees (a species of\r\nAndrenidae), which chiefly are its Victims, have not yet learned\r\nto boycott it.\r\n\r\n\"Calopogon,\" says Professor Robertson, who knows more about the\r\nfertilization of American wild flowers by insects than most\r\nwriters, \"is one of a few flowers which move the insect toward\r\nthe stigma.... There is no expenditure in keeping up a supply of\r\nnectar, and the flower, although requiring a smooth insect of a\r\ncertain size and weight, suffers nothing from the visits of those\r\nit cannot utilize. Then, there is no delay caused by the insect\r\nwaiting to suck; but as soon as it alights it is thrown down\r\nagainst the stigma. This occurs so quickly that, while standing\r\nnet in hand, I have seen insects effect pollination and escape\r\nbefore I could catch them. So many orchids fasten their pollinia\r\nupon the faces and tongues of insects that it is interesting to\r\nfind one which applies them regularly to the first abdominal\r\nsegment. Mr. Darwin has observed that absence of hair on the\r\ntongues of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and on the faces\r\nof Hymenoptera (bees; wasps, etc.) has led to the more usual\r\nadaptations, and sparseness of hair has its influence in this\r\ncase. Species of Augochlora are the only insects on which I found\r\npollinia. These bees are very smooth, depending for ornament on\r\nthe metallic sheen of their bodies. An Halictus repeatedly pulled\r\ndown the labella (lips) of flowers from which pollinia had not\r\nbeen removed; and the only reason I can assign for its failure to\r\nextract pollinia is that it is more hairy than the Augochlora.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON PERSICARIA, PINK KNOTWEED, or JOINT-WEED; SMARTWEED\r\n  (Polygonum Pennsylvanicum)  Buckwheat family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, pink, collected in terminal, dense, narrow,\r\nobtuse spikes, 1 to 2 in. long. Calyx pink or greenish, 5-parted,\r\nlike petals; no corolla; stamens 8 or less; style 2-parted. Stem:\r\n1 to 3 ft. high, simple or branched, often partly red, the joints\r\nswollen and sheathed; the branches above, and peduncles\r\nglandular. Leaves: Oblong, lance-shaped, entire edged, 2 to 11\r\nin. long, with stout midrib, sharply tapering at tip, rounded\r\ninto short petioles below.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places, roadsides, moist soil.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico; westward to\r\nTexas and Minnesota.\r\n\r\nEverywhere we meet this commonest of plants or some of its\r\nsimilar kin, the erect pink spikes brightening roadsides, rubbish\r\nheaps, fields, and waste places, from midsummer to frost. The\r\nlittle flowers, which open without method anywhere on the spike\r\nthey choose, attract many insects, the smaller bees (Andrena)\r\nconspicuous among the host. As the spreading divisions of the\r\nperianth make nectar-stealing all too easy for ants and other\r\ncrawlers that would not come in contact with anthers and stigma\r\nwhere they enter a flower near its base, most buckwheat plants\r\nwhose blossoms secrete sweets protect themselves from theft by\r\ncoating the upper stems with glandular hairs that effectually\r\ndiscourage the pilferers. Shortly after fertilization, the little\r\nrounded, flat-sided fruit begins to form inside the persistent\r\npink calyx. At any time the spike-like racemes contain more\r\nbright pink buds and shining seeds than flowers. Familiarity\r\nalone breeds contempt for this plant, that certainly possesses\r\nmuch beauty.\r\n\r\nThe LADY'S THUMB (P. Persicaria), often a troublesome weed, roams\r\nover the whole of North America, except at the extreme north -\r\nanother illustration of the riotous profusion of European floral\r\nimmigrants rejoicing in the easier struggle for existence here.\r\nIts pink spikes are shorter and less slender than those of the\r\npreceding taller, but similar species, and its leaves, which are\r\nnearly seated on the stem, have dark triangular or lunar marks\r\nnear the center in the majority of cases.\r\n\r\nAn insignificant little plant, found all over our continent,\r\nEurope, and Asia, is the familiar KNOT-GRASS or DOORWEED (P.\r\naviculare), often trailing its leafy, jointed stems over the\r\nground, but at times weakly erect, to display its tiny greenish\r\nor white pink-edged flowers, clustered in the axils of oblong,\r\nbluish-green leaves that are considerably less than an inch long.\r\nAlthough in bloom from June to October, insects seldom visit it,\r\nfor it secretes very little, if any, nectar. As might be expected\r\nin such a case, its stem is smooth.\r\n\r\nWhen the amphibious WATER PERSICARIA (P. amphibium) lifts its\r\nshort, dense, rose-colored ovoid or oblong club of bloom above\r\nponds and lakes, it is sufficiently protected from crawling\r\npilferers, of course, by the water in which it grows. But suppose\r\nthe pond dries up and the plant is left on dry ground, what then?\r\nNow, a remarkable thing happens: protective glandular, sticky\r\nhairs appear on the epidermis of the leaves and stems, which were\r\nperfectly smooth when the flowers grew in water. Such small\r\nwingless insects as might pilfer nectar without bringing to their\r\nhostess any pollen from other blossoms are held as fast as on\r\nbird-lime. The stem, which sometimes floats, sometimes is\r\nimmersed, may attain a length of twenty feet; the rounded,\r\nelliptic, petioled leaves may be four inches long or only half\r\nthat size. From Quebec to New Jersey, and westward to the\r\nPacific, the solitary, showy inflorescence, which does well to\r\nattain a height of an inch, may be found during July and August.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer, narrow, terminal, erect, spike-like\r\nracemes of small, pale pink, flesh-colored, or greenish flowers\r\nare sent upward by the MILD WATER PEPPER (P. hydropiperoides). It\r\nis like a slender, pale variety of the common pink persicaria.\r\nOne finds its inconspicuous, but very common, flowers from June\r\nto September. The plant, which grows in shallow water, swamps,\r\nand moist places throughout the Union and considerably north and\r\nsouth of it, rises three feet or less. The cylindric sheaths\r\naround the swollen joints of the stem are fringed with long\r\nbristles - a clue to identification. Another similar WATER PEPPER\r\nor SMARTWEED (P. hydropiper) is so called because of its acrid,\r\nbiting juice.\r\n\r\nThe CLIMBING FALSE BUCKWHEAT (P. scandens) straggles over bushes\r\nin woods, thickets, and by the waysides throughout a very wide\r\nrange; yet its small, dull, greenish-yellow and pinkish flowers,\r\nloosely clustered in long pedicelled racemes, are so\r\ninconspicuous during August and September, when the showy\r\ncomposites are in their glory, that we give them scarcely a\r\nglance. The alternate leaves, which are heart-shaped at the base\r\nand pointed at the lip, suggesting those of the morning glory,\r\nare on petioles arising from sheaths over the enlarged joints\r\nwhich, in this family, are always a most prominent characteristic\r\n- (Poly = many, gonum = a knee). The three outer sepals, keeled\r\nwhen in flower, are irregularly winged when the three-angled,\r\nsmooth achene hangs from the matured blossom in autumn, the\r\nseason at which the vine assumes its greatest attractiveness.\r\n\r\nThe ARROW-LEAVED TEAR THUMB (P. sagittatum), found in ditches and\r\nswampy wet soil, weakly leans on other plants, or climbs over\r\nthem with the help of the many sharp, recurved prickles which arm\r\nits four-angled stem. Even the petioles and underside of the\r\nleaf's midrib are set with prickles. The light green leaves, that\r\ncombine the lance and the arrow shapes, take on a beautiful\r\nrusset-red tint in autumn. The little, five-parted rose-colored\r\nor greenish-white flowers grow in small, close terminal heads\r\nfrom July to September from Nova Scotia to the Gulf and far\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nSEASIDE or COAST JOINTWEED or KNOT-GRASS (Polygonella articulata;\r\nPolygonum articulatum of Gray) a low, slender, wiry, diffusely\r\nspreading little plant, with thread-like leaves seated on its\r\nmuch-jointed stem, rises cleanly from out the sand of the coast\r\nfrom Maine to Florida, and the shores of the Great Lakes. Very\r\nslender racemes of tiny, nodding, rose-tinted white flowers, with\r\na dark midrib to each of the five calyx segments, are\r\ninsignificant of themselves; but when seen in masses, from July\r\nto October, they tinge the upper beaches and sandy meadows with a\r\npink blush that not a few artists have transferred to the\r\nforeground of their marine pictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN COCKLE; CORN ROSE; CORN or RED CAMPION; CROWN-OF-THE-FIELD\r\n  (Agrostemma Githago; Lychnis Githago of Gray)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Magenta or bright purplish crimson, to 3 in. broad,\r\nsolitary at end of long, stout footstem; 5 lobes of calyx\r\nleaf-like, very long and narrow, exceeding petals. Corolla of 5\r\nbroad, rounded petals; 10 stamens; 5 styles alternating with\r\ncalyx lobes, opposite petals. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, erect, with\r\nfew or no branches, leafy, the plant covered with fine white\r\nhairs. Leaves: Opposite, seated on stem, long, narrow, pointed,\r\nerect. Fruit: a 1-celled, many-seeded capsule.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wheat and other grain fields; dry, waste\r\nplaces.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - United States at large; most common in Central and\r\nWestern States. Also in Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n\"Allons! allons! sow'd cockle, reap'd no corn,\" exclaims Biron in\r\n\"Love's Labor Lost.\" Evidently the farmers even in Shakespeare's\r\nday counted this brilliant blossom the pest it has become in many\r\nof our own grain fields just as it was in ancient times, when\r\nJob, after solemnly protesting his righteousness, called on his\r\nown land to bear record against him if his words were false. \"Let\r\nthistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley,\" he\r\ncried, according to James the First's translators; but the\r\n\"noisome weeds\" of the original text seem to indicate that these\r\ngood men were more anxious to give the English people an adequate\r\nconception of Job's willingness to suffer for his honor's sake\r\nthan to translate literally. Possibly the cockle grew in Southern\r\nAsia in Job's time : today its range is north.\r\n\r\nLike many another immigrant to our hospitable shores, this\r\nvigorous invader shows a tendency to outstrip native blossoms in\r\nlife's race. Having won in the struggle for survival in the old\r\ncountry, where the contest has been most fiercely waged for\r\ncenturies, it finds life here easy, enjoyable. What are its\r\nmethods for insuring an abundance of fertile seed? We see that\r\nthe tube of the flower is so nearly closed by the stamens and\r\nfive-styled pistil as to be adapted only to the long, slender\r\ntongues of moths and butterflies, for which benefactors it became\r\nnarrow and deep to reserve the nectar. \"A certain night-flying\r\nmoth (one of the Dianthaecia) fertilizes flowers of this genus\r\nexclusively, and its larvae feed on their unripe seeds as a\r\nstaple. Bees and some long-tongued flies seen about the corn\r\ncockle doubtless get pollen only; but there are few flowers so\r\ndeep that the longest-tongued bees cannot sip them. Butterflies,\r\nattracted by the bright color of the flower - and to them color\r\nis the most catchy of advertisements - are guided by a few dark\r\nlines on the petals to the nectary.\r\n\r\nSoon after the blossom opens, five of the stamens emerge from the\r\ntube and shed their pollen on the early visitor. Later, the five\r\nother stamens empty the contents of their anthers on more tardy\r\ncomers. Finally, when all danger of self-fertilization is past,\r\nthe styles stretch upward, and the butterfly, whose head is\r\ndusted with pollen brought from earlier flowers, necessarily\r\nleaves some on their sticky surfaces as he takes the leavings in\r\nthe nectary.\r\n\r\nSo much cross-fertilized seed as the plant now produces and\r\nscatters through the grain fields may well fill the farmer's\r\nprosaic mind with despair. To him there is no glory in the\r\nscarlet of the poppy comparable with the glitter of a silver\r\ndollar; no charm in the heavenly blue of the corn-flower, that\r\nlikewise preys upon the fertility of his soil; the vivid flecks\r\nof color with which the cockle lights up his fields mean only\r\nloss of productiveness in the earth that would yield him greater\r\nprofit without them. Moreover, seeds of this so-called weed not\r\nonly darken his wheat when they are threshed out together, but\r\nare positively injurious if swallowed in any quantity. Emerson\r\nsaid every plant is called a weed until its usefulness is\r\ndiscovered. Linnaeus called this flower Agrostemma = the\r\ncrown-of-the-field. Agriculturalists never realize that beauty is\r\nin itself a sufficient plea for respected existence. Not a few of\r\nthe cockle's relatives adorn men's gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD PINK or CATCHFLY\r\n  (Silene Caroliniana; S. Pennsylvanica of Gray)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Rose pink, deep or very pale; about inch broad, on\r\nslender footstalks, in terminal clusters. Calyx tubular,\r\n5-toothed, much enlarged in fruit, sticky; 5  petals with claws\r\nenclosed in calyx, wedged-shaped above, slightly notched. Stamens\r\n10; pistil with 3 styles. Stem: 4 to 10 in. high, hairy, sticky\r\nabove, growing in tufts. Leaves: Basal ones spatulate; 2 or 3\r\npairs of lance-shaped, smaller leaves seated on stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, gravelly, sandy, or rocky soil.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - New England, south to Georgia, westward to\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nFresh, dainty, and innocent-looking as Spring herself are these\r\nbright flowers. Alas, for the tiny creatures that try to climb up\r\nthe rosy tufts to pilfer nectar, they and their relatives are not\r\nso innocent as they appear! While the little crawlers are almost\r\nwithin reach of the cup of sweets, their feet are gummed to the\r\nviscid matter that coats it, and here their struggles end as\r\nflies' do on sticky fly-paper, or birds' on limed twigs. A\r\nnaturalist counted sixty-two little corpses on the sticky stem of\r\na single pink. All this tragedy to protect a little nectar for\r\nthe butterflies which, in sipping it, transfer the pollen from\r\none flower to another, and so help them to produce the most\r\nbeautiful and robust offspring.\r\n\r\nThe pink, which has two sets of stamens of five each, elevates\r\nfirst one set, then the other, for economy's sake and to run less\r\nrisk of failure to get its pollen transferred in case of rain\r\nwhen its friends are not flying. After all the golden dust has\r\nbeen shed, however, up come the three recurved styles from the\r\ndepth of the tube to receive pollen brought by butterflies from\r\nyounger flowers. There are few cups so deep that the largest\r\nbumblebees cannot suck them. Flies which feed on the pink's\r\npollen only, sometimes come by mistake to older blossoms in the\r\nstigmatic stage, and doubtless cross-fertilize them once in a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\nIn waste places and woods farther southward and westward, and\r\nthroughout the range of the Wild Pink as well, clusters of the\r\nSLEEPY CATCHFLY (S. antirrhina) open their tiny pink flowers for\r\na short time only in the sunshine. At any stage they are mostly\r\ncalyx, but in fruit this part is much expanded. Swollen, sticky\r\njoints are the plant's means of defense from crawlers. Season:\r\nSummer.\r\n\r\nWhen moths begin their rounds at dusk, the NIGHT-FLOWERING\r\nCATCHFLY (S. noctiflora) opens its pinkish or white flowers to\r\nemit a fragrance that guides them to a feast prepared for them\r\nalone. Day-blooming catchflies have no perfume, nor do they need\r\nit; their color and markings are a sufficient guide to the\r\nbutterflies. Sticky hairs along the stems of this plant\r\nruthlessly destroy, not flies, but ants chiefly, that would\r\npilfer nectar without being able to render the flower any\r\nservice. Yet the calyx is beautifully veined, as if to tantalize\r\nthe crawlers by indicating the path to a banquet hail they may\r\nnever reach. Only a very few flowers, an inch across or less, are\r\nclustered at the top of the plant, which blooms from July to\r\nSeptember in waste places east of the Mississippi and in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOAPWORT; BOUNCING BET; HEDGE PINK; BRUISEWORT; OLD MAID'S PINK;\r\nFULLER'S HERB\r\n  (Saponaria officinalis)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink or whitish, fragrant, about 1 inch broad, loosely\r\nclustered at end of stem, also sparingly from axils of upper\r\nleaves. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed, about 3/4 in. long; 5 petals,\r\nthe claws inserted in deep tube. Stamens 10, in 2 sets; 1 pistil\r\nwith 2 styles. Flowers frequently double. Stem: to 2 ft. high,\r\nerect, stout, sparingly branched, leafy. Leaves: Opposite,\r\nacutely oval, 2 to 3 in. long, about 1 in. wide, 3 to 5 ribbed.\r\nFruit: An oblong capsule, shorter than calyx, opening at top by 4\r\nshort teeth or valves.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, banks, and waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Generally common. Naturalized from Europe.\r\n\r\nA stout, buxom, exuberantly healthy lassie among flowers is\r\nbouncing Bet, who long ago escaped from gardens whither she was\r\nbrought from Europe, and ran wild beyond colonial farms to\r\nroadsides, along which she has traveled over nearly our entire\r\narea. Underground runners and abundant seed soon form thrifty\r\ncolonies. This plant, to which our grandmothers ascribed healing\r\nvirtues, makes a cleansing, soap-like lather when its bruised\r\nleaves are agitated in water.\r\n\r\nButterflies, which delight in bright colors and distinct\r\nmarkings, find little to charm them here; but the pale shade of\r\npink or white, easily distinguished in the dark, and the\r\nfragrance, strongest after sunset, effectively advertise the\r\nflower at dusk when its benefactors begin to fly. The sphinx\r\nmoth, a frequent visitor, works as rapidly in extracting nectar\r\nfrom the deep tube as any hawk moth, so frequently mistaken for a\r\nhummingbird. The little cliff-dwelling bees (Halictus), among\r\nothers, visit the flowers by day for pollen only. At first five\r\nouter stamens protrude slightly from the flower and shed their\r\npollen on the visitor, immediately over the entrance. Afterward,\r\nhaving spread apart to leave the entrance free, the path is clear\r\nfor the five inner stamens to follow the same course. Now the\r\nstyles are still enclosed in the tube but when there is no longer\r\nfear of self-fertilization - that is to say, when the pollen has\r\nall been carried off, and the stamens have withered - up they\r\ncome and spread apart to expose their rough upper surfaces to\r\npollen brought from younger flowers by the moths.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTFORD PINK\r\n  (Dianthus Armeria)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink, with whitish dots, small, borne in small clusters\r\nat end of stem. Calyx tubular, 5-toothed, with several bract-like\r\nleaves at base; 5 petals with toothed edges, clawed at base\r\nwithin deep calyx; 10 stamens; 1 pistil with 2 styles. Stem: 6 to\r\n18 in. high, stiff, erect, finely hairy, few branches. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, blade-shaped, or lower ones rounded at end.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Southern Ontario, New England, south to Maryland,\r\nwest to Michigan.\r\n\r\nThe true pinks of Europe, among which are the SWEET WILLIAM or\r\nBUNCH PINK (D. barbatus) of our gardens, occasionally wild here,\r\nand the deliciously spicy CLOVE PINK (D. Carophyllus), ancestor\r\nof the superb carnations of the present day, that have reached a\r\nclimax in the Lawson pink of newspaper fame, were once held\r\nsacred to Jupiter, hence Dianthus = Jove's own flower. The\r\nDeptford pink, a rather insignificant little European immigrant,\r\nwithout fragrance, has a decided charm, nevertheless, when seen\r\nin bright patches among the dry grass of early autumn, with small\r\nbutterflies, that are its devoted admirers, hovering above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINK OR PALE CORYDALIS\r\n  (Capnoides sempervirens; Corydalis glauca of Gray)  Poppy\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink, with yellow tip, about 1/2 in. long, a few borne\r\nin a loose, terminal raceme. Calyx of 2 small sepals; corolla\r\nirregular, of 4 erect, closed, and flattened petals joined, 1 of\r\nouter pair with short rounded spur at base, the interior ones\r\nnarrow and keeled on back. Stamens 6, in 2 sets, Opposite outer\r\npetals; 1 pistil. Stem: Smooth, curved, branched, 1 to 2 feet\r\nhigh. Leaves: Pale grayish green, delicate, divided into\r\nvariously and finely cut leaflets. Fruit: Very narrow, erect pod,\r\n1 to 2 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky, rich, cool woods.\r\nFlowering Season - April-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia westward to Alaska, south to Minnesota\r\nand North Carolina.\r\n\r\nDainty little pink sacs, yellow at the mouth, hang upside down\r\nalong a graceful stem, and instantly suggest the Dutchman's\r\nbreeches, squirrel corn, bleeding heart, and climbing fumitory,\r\nto which the plant is next of kin. Because the lark (Korydalos)\r\nhas a spur, the flower, which boasts a small one also, borrows\r\nits Greek name.\r\n\r\nHildebrand proved by patient experiments that some flowers of\r\nthis genus have not only lost the power of self-fertilization,\r\nbut that they produce fertile seed only when pollen from another\r\nplant is carried to them. Yet how difficult they make dining for\r\ntheir benefactors! The bumblebee, which can reach the nectar, but\r\nnot lap it conveniently, often \"gets square\" with the secretive\r\nblossom by nipping holes through its spur, to which the hive bees\r\nand others hasten for refreshment. We frequently find these\r\npunctured flowers. But hive and other bees visiting the blossom\r\nfor pollen, some rubs off against their breast when they depress\r\nthe two middle petals, a sort of sheath that contains pistil and\r\nstamens.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDHACK; STEEPLE BUSH\r\n  (Spiraea tomentosa)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink or magenta, rarely white, very small, in dense,\r\npyramidal clusters. Calyx of 5 sepals; corolla of 5 rounded\r\npetals; stamens, 20 to 60; usually 5 pistils, downy. Stem: 2 to 3\r\nft. high, erect, shrubby, simple, downy. Leaves: Dark green\r\nabove, covered with whitish woolly hairs beneath; oval,\r\nsaw-edged, 1 to 2 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low moist ground, roadside ditches, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia westward, and southward to Georgia and\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nThese bright spires of pink bloom attract our attention no less\r\nthan the countless eyes of flies, beetles, and bees, ever on the\r\nlookout for food to be eaten on the spot or stored up for future\r\nprogeny. Pollen-feeding insects such as these, delight in the\r\nspireas, most of which secrete little or no nectar, but yield an\r\nabundance of pollen, which they can gather from the crowded\r\npanicles with little loss of time, transferring some of it to the\r\npistils, of course, as they move over the tiny blossoms. But most\r\nspireas are also able to fertilize themselves, insects failing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAn instant's comparison shows the steeple bush to be closely\r\nrelated to the fleecy, white meadow-sweet, often found growing\r\nnear. The pink spires, which bloom from the top downward, have\r\npale brown tips where the withered flowers are, toward the end of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nWhy is the under side of the leaves so woolly? Not as a\r\nprotection against wingless insects crawling upward, that is\r\ncertain; for such could only benefit these tiny clustered\r\nflowers. Not against the sun's rays, for it is only the under\r\nsurface that is coated. When the upper leaf surface is hairy, we\r\nknow that the plant is protected in this way from perspiring too\r\nfreely. Doubtless these leaves of the steeple bush, like those of\r\nother plants that choose a similar habitat, have woolly hairs\r\nbeneath as an absorbent to protect their pores from clogging with\r\nthe vapors that must rise from the damp ground where the plant\r\ngrows. If these pores were filled with moisture from without, how\r\ncould they possibly throw off the waste of the plant? All plants\r\nare largely dependent upon free perspiration for health, but\r\nespecially those whose roots, struck in wet ground, are\r\nconstantly sending up moisture through the stem and leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE-FLOWERING OR VIRGINIA RASPBERRY\r\n  (Rubus odoratus)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Royal purple or bluish pink, showy, fragrant, 1 to 2\r\nin. broad, loosely clustered at top of stem. Calyx sticky-hairy,\r\ndeeply 5-parted, with long pointed tips; corolla of 5 rounded\r\npetals; stamens and pistils very numerous. Stem: 3 to 5 ft. high,\r\nerect, branched, shrubby, bristly, not prickly. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, petioled, 3 to 5 lobed, middle lobe largest, and all\r\npointed; saw-edged lower leaves immense. Fruit: A depressed red\r\nberry, scarcely edible.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky woods, dells, shady roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Northern Canada south to Georgia, westward to\r\nMichigan and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nTo be an unappreciated, unloved relative of the exquisite wild\r\nrose, with which this flower is so often likened, must be a\r\nsimilar misfortune to being the untalented son of a great man, or\r\nthe unhappy author of a successful first book never equaled in\r\nlater attempts. But where the bright blossoms of the Virginia\r\nraspberry burst forth above the roadside tangle and shady\r\nwoodland dells, even those who despise magenta see beauty in them\r\nwhere abundant green tones all discordant notes into harmony.\r\nPurple, as we of today understand the color, the flower is not;\r\nbut rather the purple of ancient Orientals. On cool, cloudy days\r\nthe petals are a deep, clear purplish rose, that soon fades and\r\ndulls with age, or changes into pale, bluish pink when the sun is\r\nhot.\r\n\r\nMany yellow stamens help conceal the nectar secreted in a narrow\r\nring between the filaments and the base of the receptacle.\r\nBumblebees, the principal and most efficient visitors, which can\r\nreach sweets more readily than most insects, although numerous\r\nothers help to self-fertilize the flower, bring to the mature\r\nstigmas of a newly opened blossom pollen carried on their\r\nundersides from the anthers of a flower a day or two older. When\r\nthe inner row of anthers shed their pollen, some doubtless falls\r\non the stigmas below them, and so spontaneous self-fertilization\r\nmay occur. Fruit sets quickly; nevertheless the shrub keeps on\r\nflowering nearly all summer. Children often fold the lower\r\nleaves, which sometimes measure a foot across, to make\r\ndrinking-cups.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN-OF-THE-PRAIRIE\r\n  (Ulmaria rubra; Spirea lobata of Gray)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Deep pink, like the peach blossom, fragrant, about 1/3\r\nin. across, clustered in large cymose panicles on a long\r\nfootstalk. Calyx 5-lobed; 5-clawed, rose-like petals; stamens\r\nnumerous; pistils 5 to 15, usually 10. Stem: 2 to 8 ft. tall,\r\nsmooth, grooved, branched. Leaves: Mostly near the ground, large,\r\nrarely measuring 3 ft. long, compounded of from 3 to 7 leaflets;\r\nend leaflet, of 7 to 9 divisions, much the largest; side leaflets\r\nopposite, seated on stem, 3 to 5 lobed or parted; all lobes\r\nacute, and edges unequally incised. Prominent kidney-shaped\r\nstipules.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist meadows and prairies.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Western Pennsylvania to Michigan and Iowa, and\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nA stately, beautiful native plant, seen to perfection where it\r\nrears bright panicles of bloom above the ranker growth in the low\r\nmoist meadows of the Ohio Valley. When we find it in the East, it\r\nhas only recently escaped from man's gardens into Nature's.\r\nButterflies and bees pay grateful homage to this queen. Indeed,\r\nbutterflies appear to have a special fondness for pink, as bees\r\nhave for blue flowers. Cattle delight to chew the leaves, which,\r\nwhen crushed, give out a fragrance like sweet birch.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD ROSES\r\n  (Rosa)  Rose family\r\n\r\nJust as many members of the lily tribe show a preference for the\r\nrule of three in the arrangements of their floral parts, so the\r\nwild roses cling to the quinary method of some primitive\r\nancestor, a favorite one also with the buttercup and many of its\r\nkin, the geraniums, mallows, and various others. Most of our\r\nfruit trees and bushes are near relatives of the rose. Five\r\npetals and five sepals, then, we always find on roses in a state\r\nof nature; and although the progressive gardener of today has\r\nnowhere shown his skill more than in the development of a\r\nmultitude of petals from stamens in the magnificent roses of\r\nfashionable society, the most highly cultivated darling of the\r\ngreenhouses quickly reverts to the original wild type, setting\r\nhis work of years at naught, if once it regain its natural\r\nliberties through neglect.\r\n\r\nTo protect its foliage from being eaten by hungry cattle, the\r\nrose goes armed into the battle of life with curved, sharp\r\nprickles, not true thorns or modified branches, but merely\r\nsurface appliances which peel off with the bark. To destroy\r\ncrawling pilferers of pollen, several species coat their calices,\r\nat least, with fine hairs or sticky gum; and to insure wide\r\ndistribution of offspring, the seeds are packed in the\r\nattractive, bright red calyx tube or hip, a favorite food of many\r\nbirds, which drop them miles away. When shall we ever learn that\r\nnot even a hair has been added to or taken from a blossom without\r\na lawful cause, and study it accordingly? Fragrance, abundant\r\npollen, and bright-colored petals naturally attract many insects;\r\nbut roses secrete no nectar. Some species of bees, and a common\r\nbeetle (Trichius piger) for example, seem to depend upon certain\r\nwild roses exclusively for pollen to feed themselves and their\r\nlarvae. Bumblebees, to which roses are adapted, require a firmer\r\nsupport than the petals would give, and so alight on the center\r\nof the flower, where the pistil receives pollen carried by them\r\nfrom other roses. Although the numerous stamens and the pistils\r\nmature simultaneously, the former are usually turned outward,\r\nthat the incoming pollen-laden insect may strike the stigma\r\nfirst. When the large bees cease their visits as they may in\r\nlong-continued dull or rainy weather, the rose, turning toward\r\nthe sun, stands more or less obliquely, and some of the pollen\r\nmust fall on its stigma. Occasional self-fertilization matters\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nIf plants have insect benefactors, they have their foes as well\r\nand hordes of tiny aphids, commonly known as green flies or plant\r\nlice, moored by their sucking tubes to the tender sprays of\r\nroses, wild and cultivated, live by extracting their juices. A\r\ncurious relationship exists between these little creatures and\r\nthe ants, which \"milk\" them by stroking and caressing them with\r\ntheir antennae until they emit a tiny drop of sweet, white fluid.\r\nThe yellow ant, that lives an almost subterranean life, actually\r\ndomesticates flocks and herds of root-feeding aphids; the brown\r\nant appropriates those that live among the bark of trees; and the\r\ncommon black garden ant (Lasius niger), devoting itself to the\r\naphis of the rose bushes, protects it in extraordinary ways,\r\ndelightfully described by the author of \"Ants, Bees, and Wasps.\"\r\n\r\nIn literature, ancient and modern, sacred and profane, no flower\r\nfigures so conspicuously as the rose. To the Romans it was most\r\nsignificant when placed over the door of a public or private\r\nbanquet hall. Each who passed beneath it bound himself thereby\r\nnot to disclose anything said or done within; hence the\r\nexpression sub rosa, common to this day.\r\n\r\nThe PRAIRIE, CLIMBING, or MICHIGAN ROSE (R. setigera) lifts\r\nclusters of deep, bright pink flowers, that after a while fade\r\nalmost white, above the thickets and rich prairie soil, from\r\nsouthern Ontario and Wisconsin to the Gulf, as far eastward as\r\nFlorida. Its distinguishing characteristics are: Stout, widely\r\nseparated prickles along the stem, that grows several feet long;\r\nleaves compounded of three, rarely five, oval leaflets, acute or\r\nobtuse at the apex; stalks and calyx often glandular; odorless\r\nflowers that, opening in June and July, measure about two and a\r\nhalf inches across, their styles cohering in a smooth column on\r\nwhich bees are tempted to alight; and a round hip, or seed\r\nvessel, formed by the fruiting calyx, which is more or less\r\nglandular. From this parent stock several valuable\r\ndouble-flowering roses have been derived, among others the Queen\r\nand the Gem of the Prairies, but it is our only native rose that\r\nhas ever passed into cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH, EARLY, or MEADOW ROSE (R. blanda), found blooming in\r\nJune and July in moist, rocky places from Newfoundland to New\r\nJersey and a thousand miles westward, has a trifle larger and\r\nslightly fragrant flowers, at first pink, later pure white. Their\r\nstyles are separate, not cohering in a column nor projecting as\r\nin the climbing rose. This is a leafy, low bush mostly less than\r\nthree feet high; it is either entirely unarmed, or else provided\r\nwith only a few weak prickles; the stipules are rather broad, and\r\nthe leaf is compounded of from five to seven oval, blunt, and\r\npale green leaflets, often hoary below.\r\n\r\nIn swamps and low wet ground from Quebec to Florida, and westward\r\nto the Mississippi, the SWAMP ROSE (R. Carolina) blooms late in\r\nMay and on to midsummer. The bush may grow taller than a man, or\r\nperhaps only a foot high. It is armed with stout, hooked, rather\r\ndistant prickles, and few or no bristles. The leaflets, from five\r\nto nine, but usually seven, to a leaf, are smooth, pale, or\r\nperhaps hairy beneath to protect the pores from filling with\r\nmoisture arising from the wet ground. Long, sharp calyx lobes,\r\nwhich drop off before the cup swells in fruit into a round,\r\nglandular, hairy red hip, are conspicuous among the clustered\r\npink flowers and buds.\r\n\r\nSurely no description of our COMMON, LOW, DWARF, or PASTURE ROSE\r\n(R. humilis; R. lucida of Gray) is needed. One's acquaintance\r\nwith flowers must be limited indeed, if it does not include this\r\nmost abundant of all the wild roses from Ontario to Georgia, and\r\nwestward to Wisconsin. In light, dry, or rocky soil we find the\r\nexquisite, but usually solitary, blossom late in May until July,\r\nand, like most roses, it has the pleasant practice of putting\r\nforth a stray blossom or two in early autumn. The stamens of this\r\nspecies are turned outward so strongly that self- pollination\r\nmust very rarely take place.\r\n\r\nAmong the following charming wild roses, not natives, but\r\nnaturalized immigrants from foreign lands, that have escaped from\r\ngardens, is Shakespeare's CANKER-BLOOM, the lovely DOG ROSE or\r\nWILD BRIER (R. canina), that spreads its long, straggling\r\nbranches along the roadsides and banks, covering the waste lands\r\nwith its smooth, beautiful foliage, and in June and July with\r\npink or white roses. Because it lacks the fragrance of\r\nsweetbrier, which it otherwise closely resembles, it has been\r\nbranded with the dog prefix as a mark of contempt. Professor Koch\r\nsays that long before it was customary to surround gardens with\r\nwalls, men had rose hedges. \"Each of the four great peoples of\r\nAsia,\" he continues, \"possessed its own variety of rose, and\r\ncarried it during all wanderings, until finally all four became\r\nthe common property of the four peoples. The great Indo-Germanic\r\nstock chose the 'hundred-leaved' and RED ROSE (R. Gallica);\r\nnevertheless, after the Niebelungen the common dog rose played an\r\nimportant part among the ancient Germans. The DAMASCUS ROSE (R.\r\nDamascena), which blooms twice a year, as well as the MUSK ROSE\r\n(R. moschata), were cherished by the Semitic or Arabic stock;\r\nwhile the Turkish-Mongolian people planted by preference the\r\nYELLOW ROSE (R. lutea). Eastern Asia (China and Japan) is the\r\nfatherland of the INDIAN and TEA ROSES.\"\r\n\r\nHow fragrant are the pages of Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare\r\nwith the Eglantine! This delicious plant, known here as\r\nSWEETBRIAR (R. rubIginosa), emits its very aromatic odor from\r\nrusset glands on the under, downy side of the small leaflets,\r\nalways a certain means of identification. From eastern Canada to\r\nVirginia and Tennessee the plant has happily escaped from man's\r\ngardens back to Nature's.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its American Indian name, the lovely white CHEROKEE\r\nROSE (R. Sinica), that runs wild in the South, climbing, rambling\r\nand rioting with a truly Oriental abandon and luxuriance, did\r\nindeed come from China. Would that our northern thickets and\r\nroadsides might be decked with its pure flowers and almost\r\nequally beautiful dark, glossy, evergreen leaves!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON RED, PURPLE, MEADOW, or HONEYSUCKLE CLOVER\r\n  (Trifolium pratense)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Magenta, pink, or rarely whitish, sweet-scented, the\r\ntubular corollas set in dense round, oval, or egg-shaped heads\r\nabout 1 in. long, and seated in a sparingly hairy calyx. Stem: 6\r\nin. to 2 ft. high, branching, reclining, or erect, more or less\r\nhairy. Leaves: On long petioles, commonly compounded of 3, but\r\nsometimes of 4 to 11 oval or oblong leaflets, marked with white\r\ncrescent, often dark-spotted near center; stipules egg-shaped,\r\nsharply pointed, strongly veined, over 1/2 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, meadows, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-November.\r\nDistribution - Common throughout Canada and United States.\r\n\r\nMeadows bright with clover-heads among the grasses, daisies, and\r\nbuttercups in June resound with the murmur of unwearying industry\r\nand rapturous enjoyment. Bumblebees by the tens of thousands\r\nbuzzing above acres of the farmer's clover blossoms should be\r\nhappy in a knowledge of their benefactions, which doubtless\r\nconcern them not at all. They have never heard the story of the\r\nAustralians who imported quantities of clover for fodder, and had\r\nglorious fields of it that season, but not a seed to plant next\r\nyear's crops, simply because the farmers had failed to import the\r\nbumblebee. After her immigration the clovers multiplied\r\nprodigiously. No; the bee's happiness rests on her knowledge that\r\nonly the butterflies' long tongues can honestly share with her\r\nthe brimming wells of nectar in each tiny floret. Children who\r\nhave sucked them too appreciate her rapture. If we examine a\r\nlittle flower under the magnifying glass, we shall see why its\r\nstructure places it in the pea family. Bumblebees so depress the\r\nkeel either when they sip, or feed on pollen, that their heads\r\nand tongues get well dusted with the yellow powder, which they\r\ntransfer to the stigmas of other flowers; whereas the butterflies\r\nare of doubtful value, if not injurious, since their long,\r\nslender tongues easily drain the nectar without depressing the\r\nkeel. Even if a few grains of pollen should cling to their\r\ntongues, it would probably be wiped off as they withdrew them\r\nthrough the narrow slit, where the petals nearly meet, at the\r\nmouth of the flower. Bombus terrestris delights in nipping holes\r\nat the base of the tube, which other pilferers also profit by.\r\nOur country is so much richer in butterflies than Europe, it is\r\nscarcely surprising that Professor Robertson found thirteen\r\nLepidoptera out of twenty insect visitors to this clover in\r\nIllinois, whereas Muller caught only eight butterflies on it out\r\nof a list of thirty-nine visitors in Germany. The fritillaries\r\nand the sulphurs are always seen about the clover fields among\r\nmany others, and the \"dusky wings\" and the caterpillar of several\r\nspecies feeds almost exclusively on this plant.\r\n\r\n\"To live in clover,\" from the insect's point of view at least,\r\nmay well mean a life of luxury and affluence. Most peasants in\r\nEurope will tell you that a dream about the flower foretells not\r\nonly a happy marriage, but long life and prosperity. For ages the\r\nclover has been counted a mystic plant, and all sorts of good and\r\nbad luck were said to attend the finding of variations of its\r\nleaves which had more than the common number of leaflets. At\r\nevening these leaflets fold downward, the side ones like two\r\nhands clasped in prayer, the end one bowed over them. In this\r\nfashion the leaves of the white and other clovers also go to\r\nsleep, to protect their sensitive surfaces from cold by\r\nradiation, it is thought.\r\n\r\nThe ZIG-ZAG CLOVER, COW or MARL-GRASS (T. Medium), a native of\r\nEurope and Asia, now naturalized in the eastern half of the\r\nUnited States and Canada, may scarcely be told from the common\r\nred clover, except by its crooked, angular stems - often\r\nprovokingly straight - by its unspotted leaves, and the short\r\npeduncle in which its heads are elevated above the calyx.\r\n\r\nFarmers here are beginning to learn the value of the beautiful\r\nCRIMSON, CARNATION or ITALIAN CLOVER or NAPOLEONS (T.\r\nincarnatum), and happily there are many fields and waste places\r\nin the East already harboring the brilliant runaways. The narrow\r\nheads may be two and a half inches long. A meadow of this fodder\r\nplant makes one envious of the very cattle that may spend the\r\nsummer day wading through acres of its deep bright bloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOAT'S RUE; CAT-GUT; HOARY PEA or WILD SWEET PEA\r\n  (Cracca Virginiana; Tephrosia Virginiana of Gray)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - In terminal cluster, each 1/2 in. long or over,\r\nbutterfly-shaped, consisting of greenish, cream-yellow standard,\r\npurplish-rose wings, and curved keel of greenish yellow tinged\r\nwith rose; petals clawed; 10 stamens (9 and 1); calyx 5-toothed.\r\nStem: Hoary, with white, silky hairs, rather woody, 1 to 2 feet\r\nhigh. Leaves: Compounded of 7 to 25 oblong leaflets. Root: Long,\r\nfibrous, tough. Fruit: A hoary, narrow pod, to 2 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, sandy soil, edges of pine woods.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Southern New England, westward to Minnesota, south\r\nto Florida, Louisiana, and Mexico.\r\n\r\nFlowers far less showy and attractive than this denizen of sandy\r\nwastelands, a cousin of the wisteria vine and the locust tree,\r\nhave been introduced to American gardens. Striking its long\r\nfibrous root deep into the dry soil, the plant spreads in thrifty\r\nclumps through heat and drought - and so tough are its fibers\r\nthey might almost be used for violin strings. As in the case of\r\nthe lupine, the partridge pea and certain others akin to it, the\r\nleaves of the hoary pea \"go to sleep\" at night, but after a\r\nmanner of their own, i.e., by lying along the stem and turning on\r\ntheir own bases.\r\n\r\nIn similar situations from New York south and southwestward, the\r\nMILK PEA (Galactia regularis; G. glabella of Gray) lies prostrate\r\nalong the ground, the matted, usually branched stems sending up\r\nat regular intervals a raceme of rose-purple flowers in July and\r\nAugust from the axil of the trefoliate leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAILING BUSH CLOVER\r\n  (Lespedeza procumbens)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink or violet, veined, the butterfly-shaped\r\nones having standard petal, wings, and keel, clustered at end of\r\npeduncles; the minute flowers lacking a corolla, nearly sessile.\r\nCalyx of 5 slender, nearly equal lobes. Stems: Prostrate,\r\ntrailing, or sometimes ascending, woolly or downy, leafy. Leaves:\r\nClover-like, trefoliate. Fruit: A very small, hairy, flat,\r\nrounded, acute pod.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil open, sandy places.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - Massachusetts to the Gulf, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nSpringing upward from a mass of clover-like leaves, these showy\r\nlittle blossoms elevate themselves to arrest, not our attention,\r\nbut the notice of the passing bee. As the claw of the standard\r\npetal and the calyx are short, he need not have a long tongue to\r\ndrain the nectary pointed out to him by a triangular white mark\r\nat the base of the banner. Now, as his weight depresses the\r\nincurved keel, wherein the vital organs are protected, the stigma\r\nstrikes the visitor in advance of the anthers, so that pollen\r\nbrought on his underside from another flower must come off on\r\nthis one before he receives fresh pollen to transfer to a third\r\nblossom. At first the keel returns to its original position when\r\ndepressed; later it loses its elasticity. But besides these showy\r\nflowers intended to be cross-fertilized by insects, the bush\r\nclovers bear, among the others, insignificant-looking, tightly\r\nclosed, bud-like ones that produce abundant self-fertilized seed.\r\nThe petaliferous flowers are simply to counteract the inevitable\r\nevils resulting from close inbreeding. One usually finds\r\ncaterpillars of the \"dusky wings\" butterfly feeding on the\r\nfoliage and the similar tick trefoils which are its staple. At\r\nnight the bush clover leaves turn upward, completely changing the\r\naspect of these plants as we know them by day. Michaux named the\r\ngroup of flowers for his patron, Lespedez, a governor of Florida\r\nunder the Spanish regime.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest of the tribe is the VIOLET BUSH CLOVER (L.\r\nviolacea), a variable, branching, erect, or spreading plant,\r\nsometimes only a foot high, or again three times as tall. Its\r\nthin leaves are more elliptic than the decidedly clover-like ones\r\nof the preceding species; its rose-purple flowers are more\r\nloosely clustered, and the stems are only sparingly hairy, never\r\nwoolly.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the erect, usually unbranched, but very leafy stem\r\nof the WAND-LIKE BUSH CLOVER (L. frutescens), the two kinds of\r\nflowers grow in a crowded cluster, and more sparingly from the\r\naxils below. The clover-like leaflets, dark green and smooth\r\nabove, are paler and hairy below. Like the rest of its kin, this\r\nbush clover delights in dry soil, particularly in open, sandy\r\nplaces near woods of pine and oak. One readily distinguishes the\r\nSLENDER BUSH CLOVER (L. Virginica) by the very narrowly oblong\r\nleaves along its wand, which bears two kinds of bright rose\r\nflowers, clustered at the top chiefly, and in the axils.\r\n\r\nYellowish-white flowers, about a quarter of an inch long, and\r\nwith a purplish-rose spot on the standard petal to serve as a\r\npathfinder to the nectary, are crowded in oblong spikes an inch\r\nand a half long or less on the HAIRY BUSH CLOVER (L. hirta). The\r\nstem, which may attain four feet, or half that height, is usually\r\nbranched; and the entire plant is often downy to the point of\r\nsilkiness.\r\n\r\nDense clusters of the yellowish-white flowers of the ROUND-HEADED\r\nBUSH CLOVER (L. capitata) are seated in the upper axils of the\r\nsilvery-hairy, wand-like stem. Pink streaks at the base of the\r\nstandard petal serve as pathfinders, and its infolded edges guide\r\nthe bee's tongue straight to the opening in the stamen tube\r\nthrough which he sucks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD or SPOTTED GERANIUM or CRANE'S-BILL; ALUM-ROOT\r\n  (Geranium maculatum)  Geranium family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale magenta, purplish pink, or lavender, regular, 1 to\r\n1 1/2 in. broad, solitary or a pair, borne on elongated\r\npeduncles, generally with pair of leaves at their base. Calyx of\r\n5 lapping, pointed sepals; 5 petals, woolly at base; 10 stamens;\r\npistil with 5 styles. Fruit: A slender capsule pointed like a\r\ncrane's bill. In maturity it ejects seeds elastically far from\r\nthe parent plant. Stem: 1 to 2 ft. high, hairy, slender, simple\r\nor branching above. Leaves: Older ones sometimes spotted with\r\nwhite; basal ones 3 to 6 in. wide, 3 to 5 parted, variously cleft\r\nand toothed; 2 stem leaves opposite.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open woods, thickets, and shady roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-July.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Georgia, and westward a thousand\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nSprengel, who was the first to exalt flowers above the level of\r\nmere botanical specimens, had his attention led to the intimate\r\nrelationship existing between plants and insects by studying out\r\nthe meaning of the hairy corolla of the common wild geranium of\r\nGermany (G. sylvaticum), being convinced, as he wrote in 1787,\r\nthat \"the wise Author of Nature has not made even a single hair\r\nwithout a definite design.\" A hundred years before, Nehemias Grew\r\nhad said that it was necessary for pollen to reach the stigma of\r\na flower in order that it might set fertile seed; and Linnaeus\r\nhad to come to his aid with conclusive evidence to convince a\r\ndoubting world that this was true. Sprengel made the next step\r\nforward, but his writings lay neglected over seventy years\r\nbecause he advanced the then incredible and only partially true\r\nstatement that a flower is fertilized by insects which carry its\r\npollen from its anthers to its stigma. In spite of his\r\ndiscoveries that the hairs inside the geranium's corolla protect\r\nits nectar from rain for the insect's benefit, just as eyebrows\r\nkeep perspiration from falling into the eye; that most flowers\r\nwhich secrete nectar have what he termed \"honey guides\" - spots\r\nof bright color, heavy veining, or some such pathfinder on the\r\npetals - in spite of the most patient and scientific research\r\nthat shed great light on natural selection a half-century before\r\nDarwin advanced the theory, he left it for the author of \"The\r\nOrigin of Species\" to show that cross-fertilization - the\r\ntransfer of pollen from one blossom to another, not from anthers\r\nto stigma of the same flower - is the great end to which so much\r\nmarvelous mechanism is chiefly adapted. Cross-fertilized blossoms\r\ndefeat self-fertilized flowers in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Sprengel's theory was disproved by his scornful\r\ncontemporaries in the very case of his wild geranium, which sheds\r\nits pollen before it has developed a stigma to receive any;\r\ntherefore no insect that had not brought pollen from an earlier\r\nbloom could possibly fertilize this flower. How amazing that he\r\ndid not see this! Our common wild crane's-bill, which also has\r\nlost the power to fertilize itself, not only ripens first the\r\nouter, then the inner, row of anthers, but actually drops them\r\noff after their pollen has been removed, to overcome the barest\r\nchance of self-fertilization as the stigmas become receptive.\r\nThis is the geranium's and many other flowers' method to compel\r\ncross-fertilization by insects. In cold, stormy, cloudy weather a\r\ngeranium blossom may remain in the male stage several days before\r\nbecoming female; while on a warm, sunny day, when plenty of\r\ninsects are flying, the change sometimes takes place in a few\r\nhours. Among others, the common sulphur or puddle butterfly, that\r\nsits in swarms on muddy roads and makes the clover fields gay\r\nwith its bright little wings, pilfers nectar from the geranium\r\nwithout bringing its long tongue in contact with the pollen.\r\nNeither do the smaller bees and flies which alight on the petals\r\nnecessarily come in contact with the anthers and stigmas.\r\nDoubtless the larger bees are the flowers' true benefactors.\r\n\r\nThe so-called geraniums in cultivation are pelargoniums, strictly\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nIn barren soil, from Canada to the Gulf, and far westward, the\r\nCAROLINA CRANE'S-BILL (G. Carolinianum), an erect, much-branched\r\nlittle plant resembling the spotted geranium in general features,\r\nbears more compact clusters of pale rose or whitish flowers,\r\nbarely half an inch across. As their inner row of anthers comes\r\nvery close to the stigmas, spontaneous self-fertilization may\r\nsometimes occur; although in fine weather small bees, especially,\r\nvisit them constantly. The beak of the seed vessel measures\r\nnearly an inch long.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERB ROBERT; RED ROBIN; RED SHANKS; DRAGON'S BLOOD\r\n  (Geranium Robertianum)  Geranium family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish rose, about 1/2 in. across, borne chiefly in\r\npairs on slender peduncles. Five sepals and petals; stamens 10;\r\npistil with 5 styles. Stem: Weak, slender, much branched, forked,\r\nand spreading, slightly hairy, 6 to i8 in. high. Leaves: Strongly\r\nscented, opposite, thin, of 3 divisions, much subdivided and\r\ncleft. Fruit: Capsular, elastic, the beak 1 in. long,\r\nawn-pointed.\r\nPreferreed Habitat - Rocky, moist woods and shady roadsides\r\nFlowering Season - May-October\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania, and westward to\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nWho was the Robert for whom this his \"holy herb\" was named? Many\r\nsuppose that he was St. Robert, a Benedictine monk, to whom the\r\ntwenty-ninth of April - the day the plant comes into flower in\r\nEurope - is dedicated. Others assert that Robert Duke of\r\nNormandy, for whom the \"Ortus Sanitatis,\" a standard medical\r\nguide for some hundred of years, was written, is the man honored;\r\nand since there is now no way of deciding the mooted question, we\r\nmay take our choice.\r\n\r\nOnly when the stems are young are they green; later the plant\r\nwell earns the name of red shanks, and when its leaves show\r\ncrimson stains, of dragon's blood.\r\n\r\nAt any time the herb gives forth a disagreeable odor, but\r\nespecially when its leaves and stem have been crushed until they\r\nemit a resinous secretion once an alleged cure for the plague.\r\nFlies, that never object to a noxious smell, constantly visit the\r\nflower, and have their tongues guided through passages between\r\nlittle ridge-like processes on each petal to the nectar secreted\r\nby the base of the filaments at the base of each sepal. To\r\nprevent self-fertilization the five stigmas are folded close\r\ntogether when the flower opens, nor do they spread apart and\r\nbecome receptive until after the outer row of anthers, then the\r\ninner row, have shed their pollen. When the elastic carpels have\r\nripened their seed, bang! go the little guns, scattering them far\r\nand wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE OR TRUE WOOD~SORREL; ALLELULA\r\n  (Oxalis acetosella)  Wood-sorrel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or delicate pink, veined with deep pink, about\r\n1/2 in. long. Five sepals; 5 spreading petals rounded at tips; 10\r\nstamens, 5 longer, 5 shorter, all anther-bearing; 1 pistil with 5\r\nstigmatic styles. Scape: Slender, leafless, 1-flowered, 2 to 5\r\nin, high. Leaf: Clover-like, of 3 leaflets, on long petioles from\r\nscaly, creeping rootstock.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cold, damp woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and Manitoba, southward to North\r\nCarolina. Also a native of Europe.\r\n\r\nClumps of these delicate little pinkish blossoms and abundant\r\nleaves, cuddled close to the cold earth of northern forests,\r\nusually conceal near the dry leaves or moss from which they\r\nspring blind flowers that never open - cleistogamous the\r\nbotanists call them - flowers that lack petals, as if they were\r\nimmature buds; that lack odor, nectar, and entrance; yet they are\r\nperfectly mature, self-fertilized, and abundantly fruitful.\r\nFifty-five genera of plants contain one or more species on which\r\nthese peculiar products are found, the pea family having more\r\nthan any other, although violets offer perhaps the most familiar\r\ninstance to most of us. Many of these species bury their\r\noffspring below ground; but the wood-sorrel bears its blind\r\nflowers nodding from the top of a curved scape at the base of the\r\nplant, where we can readily find them. By having no petals, and\r\nother features assumed by an ordinary flower to attract insects,\r\nand chiefly in saving pollen, they produce seed with literally\r\nthe closest economy. It is estimated that the average blind\r\nflower of the wood-sorrel does its work with four hundred pollen\r\ngrains, while the prodigal peony scatters with the help of wind\r\nand insect visitors over three and a half millions!\r\n\r\nYet no plant, however economically inclined, can afford to\r\ndeteriorate its species through self-fertilization; therefore, to\r\novercome the evils of in-breeding, the wood-sorrel, like other\r\nplants that bear cleistogamous flowers, takes special pains to\r\nproduce showy blossoms to attract insects, on which they\r\nabsolutely depend to transfer their pollen from flower to flower.\r\nThese have their organs so arranged as to make self-fertilization\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nEvery child knows how the wood-sorrel \"goes to sleep\" by drooping\r\nits three leaflets until they touch back to back at evening,\r\nregaining the horizontal at sunrise - a performance most\r\nscientists now agree protects the peculiarly sensitive leaf from\r\ncold by radiation. During the day, as well, seedling, scape, and\r\nleaves go through some interesting movements, closely followed by\r\nDarwin in his \"Power of Movement in Plants,\" which should be read\r\nby all interested.\r\n\r\nOxalis, the Greek for sour, applies to all sorrels because of\r\ntheir acid juice; but acetosella = vinegar salt, the specific\r\nname of this plant, indicates that from it druggists obtain salt\r\nof lemons. Twenty pounds of leaves yield between two and three\r\nounces of oxalic acid by crystallization. Names locally given the\r\nplant in the Old World are wood sour or sower, cuckoo's meat,\r\nsour trefoil, and shamrock - for this is St. Patrick's own\r\nflower, the true shamrock of the ancient Irish, some claim.\r\nAlleluia, another folk-name, refers to the joyousness of the\r\nEaster season, when the plant comes into bloom in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIOLET WOOD-SORREL\r\n  (Oxalis violacea)  Wood-sorrel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pinkish purple, lavender, or pale magenta; less than 1\r\nin. long; borne on slender stems in umbels or forking clusters,\r\neach containing from 3 to 12 flowers. Calyx of 5 obtuse sepals; 5\r\npetals; 10 (5 longer, 5 shorter) stamens; 5 styles persistent\r\nabove 5-celled ovary. Stem: From brownish, scaly bulb 4 to 9 in.\r\nhigh. Leaves: About 1 in. wide, compounded of 3 rounded,\r\nclover-like leaflets with prominent midrib, borne at end of\r\nslender petioles, springing from root.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky and sandy woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Northern United States to Rocky Mountains, south\r\nto Florida and New Mexico; more abundant southward.\r\n\r\nBeauty of Leaf and blossom is not the only attraction possessed\r\nby this charming little plant. As a family the wood-sorrels have\r\ngreat interest for botanists since Darwin devoted such exhaustive\r\nstudy to their power of movement, and many other scientists have\r\ndescribed the several forms assumed by perfect flowers of the\r\nsame species to secure cross-fertilization. Some members of the\r\nclan also bear blind flowers, which have been described in the\r\naccount of the white wood-sorrel given above. Even the\r\nrudimentary leaves of the seedlings \"go to sleep\" at evening, and\r\nduring the day are in constant movement up and down. The stems,\r\ntoo, are restless; and as for the mature leaves, every child\r\nknows how they droop their three leaflets back to back against\r\nthe stem at evening, elevating them to the perfect horizontal\r\nagain by day. Extreme sensitiveness to light has been thought to\r\nbe the true explanation of so much activity, and yet this is not\r\na satisfactory theory in many cases. It is certain that drooping\r\nleaves suffer far less from frost than those whose upper surfaces\r\nare flatly exposed to the zenith. This view that the sleep of\r\nleaves saves them from being chilled at night by radiation is\r\nDarwin's own, supported by innumerable experiments; and probably\r\nit would have been advanced by Linnaeus, too, since so many of\r\nhis observations in \"Somnus Plantarum\" verify the theory, had the\r\nprinciple of radiation been discovered in his day.\r\nThe violet wood-sorrel produces two sorts of perfect flowers\r\nreciprocally adapted to each other, but on different plants in\r\nthe same neighborhood. The two are essentially alike, except in\r\narrangement of stamens and pistil; one flower having high anthers\r\nand low stigmas, the other having lower anthers and higher\r\nstigmas; and as the high stigmas are fertile only when pollenized\r\nwith grains from a flower having high anthers, it is evident\r\ninsect aid to transfer pollen is indispensable here. Small bees,\r\nwhich visit these blossoms abundantly, are their benefactors;\r\nalthough there is nothing to prevent pollen from falling on the\r\nstigmas of the short-styled form. Hildebrand proved that\r\nproductiveness is greatest, or exists only, after legitimate\r\nfertilization. To accomplish cross-pollination, many plants bear\r\nflowers of opposite sexes on different individuals; but the\r\nviolet wood-sorrel's plan, utilized by the bluet and\r\npartridge-vine also, has the advantage in that both kinds of its\r\nflowers are fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON, FIELD, or PURPLE MILKWORT; PURPLE POLYGALA\r\n  (Polygala viridescens; P. sanguinca of Gray) Milkwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Numerous, very small, variable; bright magenta, pink,\r\nor almost red, or pale to whiteness, or greenish, clustered in a\r\nglobular clover-like head, gradually lengthening to a cylindric\r\nspike. Stem: 6 to 15 in. high, smooth, branched above, leafy.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, narrowly oblong, entire.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields and meadows, moist or sandy.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Southern Canada to North Carolina, westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nWhen these bright clover-like heads and the inconspicuous\r\ngreenish ones grow together, the difference between them is so\r\nstriking it is no wonder Linnaeus thought they were borne by two\r\ndistinct species, sanguinea and viridescens, whereas they are now\r\nknown to be merely two forms of the same flower. At first glance\r\none might mistake the irregular little blossom for a member of\r\nthe pea family; two of the five very unequal sepals - not petals\r\n- are colored wings. These bright-hued calyx-parts overlap around\r\nthe flower-head like tiles on a roof. Within each pair of wings\r\nare three petals united into a tube, split on the back, to expose\r\nthe vital organs to contact with the bee, the milkwort's best\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nPlants of this genus were named polygala, the Greek for much\r\nmilk, not because they have milky juice - for it is bitter and\r\nclear - but because feeding on them is supposed to increase the\r\nflow of cattle's milk.\r\n\r\nIn sandy swamps, especially near the coast from Maine to the\r\nGulf, and westward to the Mississippi, grows the MARSH or\r\nCROSS-LEAVED MILKWORT (P. cruciata). Most of its leaves,\r\nespecially the lower ones, are in whorls of four, and from July\r\nto September its dense, bright purple-pink, white, or greenish\r\nflower-heads, the wings awn-pointed, are seated on the ends of\r\nthe square branching stem of this low, mossy little plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRINGED MILKWORT or POLYGALA; FLOWERING WINTERGREEN; GAY WINGS\r\n  (Polygala paucifolia)  Milkwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish rose, rarely white, showy, over 1/2 in. long,\r\nfrom 1 to 4 on short, slender peduncles from among upper leaves.\r\nCalyx of 5 unequal sepals, of which 2 are wing-like and highly\r\ncolored like petals. Corolla irregular, its crest finely fringed;\r\n6 stamens; pistil. Also pale, pouch-like, cleistogamous flowers\r\nunderground. Stem: Prostrate, 6 to 15 in. long, slender, from\r\ncreeping rootstock, sending up flowering shoots 4 to 7 in. high.\r\nLeaves: Clustered at summit, oblong, or pointed egg-shaped, 1 1/2\r\nin. long or less; those on lower part of shoots scale-like.\r\nPreferred habitat - Moist, rich woods, pine lands, light soil.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Northern Canada, southward and westward to Georgia\r\nand Illinois.\r\n\r\nGay companies of these charming, bright little blossoms hidden\r\naway in the woods suggest a swarm of tiny mauve butterflies that\r\nhave settled among the wintergreen leaves. Unlike the common\r\nmilkwort and many of its kin that grow in clover-like heads, each\r\none of the gay wings has beauty enough to stand alone, Its oddity\r\nof structure, its lovely color and enticing fringe, lead one to\r\nsuspect it of extraordinary desire to woo some insect that will\r\ncarry its pollen from blossom to blossom and so enable the plant\r\nto produce cross-fertilized seed to counteract the evil\r\ntendencies resulting from the more prolific self-fertilized\r\ncleistogamous flowers buried in the ground below. It has been\r\nsaid that the fringed polygala keeps \"one flower for beauty and\r\none for use\"; \"one playful flower for the world, another for\r\nserious use and posterity\"; but surely the showy flowers, the\r\n\"giddy sisters,\" borne by all cleistogamous species to save them\r\nfrom degenerating through close inbreeding, are no idle,\r\nirresponsible beauties. Let us watch a bumblebee as she alights\r\non the convenient fringe which edges the lower petal of this\r\nmilkwort. Now the weight of her body so depresses the keel, or\r\ntubular petals, wherein the stamens and pistil lie protected from\r\nthe rain and useless insects, that as soon as it is pressed\r\ndownward a spoon-tipped pistil pushes out the pollen through the\r\nslit on the top on the bee's abdomen. The stigmatic surface of\r\nthe pistil is on the opposite side of the spoon, nearest the base\r\nof the flower, to guard against self-pollination. After the\r\npollen has been removed, a bumblebee, already dusted from other\r\nblossoms, must leave some on the stigma as she sucks the nectar.\r\nIndeed, every feature possessed by this pretty flower has been\r\ndeveloped for the most serious purpose of life - the salvation of\r\nthe species.\r\n\r\nOnly locally common throughout a wide area, embracing the eastern\r\nhalf of the United States and Canada, is the RACEMED MILKWORT (P.\r\npolygama), whose small, purple-pink, but showy flowers, clustered\r\nalong the upper part of numerous leafy stems, are found in dry\r\nsoil during June and July. Like the fringed milkwort, this one\r\nbears many cleistogamous, or blind flowers, on underground\r\nbranches, flowers that always set an abundance of fertile\r\nself-planted seed in case of failure to form any on the part of\r\ntheir showy sisters, which are utterly dependent upon the bee's\r\nministrations. During prolonged stormy weather few insects are\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWAMP ROSE-MALLOW; MALLOW ROSE\r\n  (Hibiscus Moscheutos)  Mallow family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very large, clear rose pink, sometimes white, often\r\nwith crimson center, 4 to 7 in. across, solitary, or clustered on\r\npeduncles at summit of stems. Calyx 5-cleft, subtended by\r\nnumerous narrow bractlets; 5 large, veined petals; stamens united\r\ninto a valvular column bearing anthers on the outside for much of\r\nits length; 1 pistil partly enclosed in the column, and with five\r\nbutton-tipped stigmatic branches above. Stem: 4 to 7 ft. tall,\r\nstout, from perennial root. Leaves: 3 to 7 in. long, tapering,\r\npointed, egg-shaped, densely white, downy beneath lower leaves,\r\nor sometimes all, lobed at middle.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Brackish marshes, riversides, lake shores,\r\nsaline situations.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - Massachusetts to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to\r\nLouisiana; found locally in the interior, but chiefly along\r\nAtlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nStately ranks of these magnificent flowers, growing among the\r\ntall sedges and \"cat-tails\" of the marshes, make the most\r\ninsensate traveler exclaim at their amazing loveliness. To reach\r\nthem one must don rubber boots and risk sudden seats in the\r\nslippery ooze; nevertheless, with spade in hand to give one\r\nsupport, it is well worthwhile to seek them out and dig up some\r\nroots to transplant to the garden. Here, strange to say, without\r\nsalt soil or more water than the average garden receives from\r\nshowers and hose, this handsomest of our wild flowers soon makes\r\nitself delightfully at home under cultivation. Such good, deep\r\nearth, well enriched and moistened, as the hollyhock thrives in,\r\nsuits it perfectly. Now we have a better opportunity to note how\r\nthe bees suck the five nectaries at the base of the petals and\r\ncollect the abundant pollen of the newly opened flowers, which\r\nthey perforce transfer to the five button-shaped stigmas\r\nintentionally impeding the entrance to older blossoms. Only its\r\ncousin the hollyhock, a native of China, can vie with the\r\nrose-mallow's decorative splendor among the shrubbery; and the\r\nROSE OF CHINA (Hibiscus Rosa-Sinensis), cultivated in greenhouses\r\nhere, eclipse it in the beauty of the individual blossom. This\r\nlatter flower, whose superb scarlet corolla stains black, is\r\nemployed by the Chinese married women, it is said, to discolor\r\ntheir teeth; but in the West Indies it sinks to even greater\r\nignominy as a dauber for blacking shoes!\r\n\r\nMARSH MALLOW (Althaea officinalis), a name frequently misapplied\r\nto the swamp rose-mallow, is properly given to a much smaller\r\npink flower, measuring only an inch and a half across at the\r\nmost, and a far rarer one, being a naturalized immigrant from\r\nEurope found only in the salt marshes from the Massachusetts\r\ncoast to New York. It is also known as WYMOTE. This is a bushy,\r\nleafy plant, two to four feet high, and covered with velvety down\r\nas a protection against the clogging of its pores by the moisture\r\narising from its wet retreats. Plants that live in swamps must\r\n\"perspire\" freely and keep their pores open. From the marsh\r\nmallow's thick roots the mucilage used in confectionery is\r\nobtained, a soothing demulcent long esteemed in medicine. Another\r\nrelative, the OKRA or GUMBO PLANT of vegetable gardens (Hibiscus\r\nesculentus), has mucilage enough in its narrow pods to thicken a\r\npotful of soup. Its pale yellow, crimson-centered flowers are\r\nquite as beautiful as any hollyhock, but not nearly so\r\nconspicuous, because of the plant's bushy habit of growth. In\r\nspite of its name, the ALTHAEA of our gardens, or ROSE OF SHARON\r\n(Hibiscus Syriacus), is not so closely allied to Althaea\r\nofficinalis as to the swamp rose-mallow.\r\n\r\nAnother immigrant from Europe and Asia sparingly naturalized in\r\nwaste places and roadsides in Canada, the United States, and\r\nMexico is the COMMON HIGH MALLOW, CHEESEFLOWER, or ROUND DOCK\r\n(Malva sylvestris). Its purplish-rose flowers, from which the\r\nFrench have derived their word mauve, first applied to this\r\nplant, appear in small clusters on slender pedicels from the leaf\r\naxils along a leafy, rather weak, but ascending stem, maybe only\r\na foot high, or perhaps a yard, throughout the summer months. The\r\nleaf, borne on a petiole two to six inches long, is divided into\r\nfrom five to nine shallow, angular, or rounded saw-edged lobes.\r\nCountry children eat unlimited quantities of the harmless little\r\ncircular, flattened \"cheeses\" or seed vessels, a characteristic\r\nof the genus Malva. Since the flower invites a great number of\r\ninsects to feast on its nectar, secreted in five little pits\r\n(protected for them from the rain by hairs at the base of the\r\npetals), and compels its visitors to wipe off pollen brought from\r\nthe pyramidal group of anthers in a newly opened blossom to the\r\nexserted, radiating stigmas of older ones, the mallow produces\r\nmore cheeses than all the dairies of the world. So rich is its\r\nstore of nectar that the hive-bee, shut out from a legitimate\r\nentrance to the flower when it closes in the late afternoon,\r\nclimbs up the outside of the calyx, and inserting his tongue\r\nbetween the five petals, empties the nectaries one after another\r\n- intelligent rogue that he is!\r\n\r\nThe LOW, DWARF, or RUNNING MALLOW (M. rotundifolia), a very\r\ncommon little weed throughout our territory, Europe, and Asia,\r\ndepends scarcely at all upon insects to transfer its pollen, as\r\nmight be inferred from its unattractive pale blue to white\r\nflowers, that measure only about half an inch across. In default\r\nof visitors, its pollen-laden anthers, instead of drooping to get\r\nout of the way of the stigmas, as in the showy high mallow,\r\nremain extended so as to come in contact with the rough, sticky\r\nsides of the long curling stigmas. The leaves of this spreading\r\nplant, which are nearly round, with five to nine shallow,\r\nsaw-edged lobes, are thin, and furnished with long petioles;\r\nwhereas the flowers which spring from their axils keep close to\r\nthe main stem. Usually there are about fifteen rounded carpels\r\nthat go to make up the Dutch, doll, or fairy cheeses, as the seed\r\nvessels are called by children. Only once is the mallow mentioned\r\nin the Bible, and then as food for the most abject and despised\r\npoor (Job 30: 4); but as eighteen species of mallow grow in\r\nPalestine, who is the higher critic to name the species eaten?\r\n\r\nOccasionally we meet by the roadside in Canada, the Eastern,\r\nMiddle, and Southern States pink, sometimes white, flowers, about\r\ntwo inches across, growing in small clusters at the top of a stem\r\na foot or two high, the whole plant emitting a faint odor of\r\nmusk. If the stem leaves are deeply divided into several narrow,\r\nmuch-cleft segments, and the little cheeses are densely hairy, we\r\nmay safely call the plant MUSK MALLOW (M. moschata), and expect\r\nto find it blooming throughout the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSH ST.-JOHN'S-WORT\r\n  (Triadenum Virginicum; Elodea Virginica of Gray)\r\nSt.-John's-wort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale magenta, pink, or flesh color, about 1/2 in.\r\nacross, in terminal clusters, or from leaf axils. Calyx of 5\r\nequal sepals, persistent on fruit; 5 petals; 9 or more stamens\r\nunited in 3 sets; pistil of 3 distinct styles. Stem: to 1 1/2 ft.\r\nhigh, simple, leafy. Leaves: Opposite, pale, with black,\r\nglandular dots, broadly oblong, entire edged, seated on stem or\r\nclasping by heart-shaped base. Fruit: An oblong, acute, deep red\r\ncapsule.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps and cranberry bogs.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Labrador to the Gulf, and westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nLate in the summer, after the rather insignificant pink flowers\r\nhave withered, this low plant, which almost never lacks some\r\ncolor in its green parts, greatly increases its beauty by tinting\r\nstems, leaves, and seed vessels with red. Like other members of\r\nthe family, the flower arranges its stamens in little bundles of\r\nthree, and when an insect comes to feast on the abundant pollen -\r\nno nectar being secreted - he cannot avoid rubbing some off on\r\nthe stigmas that are on a level with the anthers. He may\r\nsometimes carry pollen from blossom to blossom, it is true, but\r\ncertainly the St.-John's-wort takes no adequate precautions\r\nagainst self-fertilization at any time. Toward the close of its\r\nexistence the flower draws its petals together toward the axils,\r\nthus bringing anthers and stigmas in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKED WILLOW-HERB; LONG PURPLES; SPIKED or PURPLE LOOSESTRIFE\r\n  (Lythrum Salicaria)  Loosestrife family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright magenta (royal purple) or pinkish purple, about\r\n1/2 in. broad, crowded in whorls around long bracted spikes.\r\nCalyx tubular, ribbed, 5 to 7 toothed, with small projections\r\nbetween. Corolla of 5 or 6 slightly wrinkled or twisted petals.\r\nStamens, in 2 whorls of 5 or 6 each, and 1 pistil, occurring in\r\nthree different lengths. Stem: 2 to 3 ft. high, leafy, branched.\r\nLeaves: Opposite, or sometimes in whorls of 3; lance-shaped, with\r\nheart-shaped base clasping stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet meadows, watery places, ditches, and\r\nbanks of streams.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Eastern Canada to Delaware, and westward through\r\nMiddle States; also in Europe.\r\n\r\nThrough Darwin's patient study of this trimorphic flower, it has\r\nassumed so important a place in his theory of the origin of\r\nspecies that its fertilization by insects deserves special\r\nattention. On page 5, the method by which the pickerel weed,\r\nanother flower whose stamens and pistil occur in three different\r\nlengths, should be read to avoid much repetition. Now the\r\nloosestrife produces six different kinds of yellow and green\r\npollen on its two sets of three stamens; and when this pollen is\r\napplied by insects to the stigmatic surface of three different\r\nlengths of pistil, it follows that there are eighteen ways in\r\nwhich it may be transferred. But Darwin proved that only pollen\r\nbrought from the shortest stamens to the shortest pistil, from\r\nthe middle-length stamens to the middle-length pistil, and from\r\nthe long stamens to the long pistil effectually fertilizes the\r\nflower. And as all the flowers on any one plant are of the same\r\nkind, we have here a marvelous mechanism to secure\r\ncross-fertilization. His experiments with this loosestrife also\r\ndemonstrated that \"reproductive organs, when of different length,\r\nbehave to one another like different species of the same genus in\r\nregard both to direct productiveness and the character of the\r\noffspring; and that consequently mutual barrenness, which was\r\nonce thought conclusive proof of difference of species, is\r\nworthless as such, and the last barrier that was raised between\r\nspecies and varieties is broken down.\" (Muller.)\r\n\r\nNaturally the bright-hued, hospitable flower, which secretes\r\nabundant nectar at the base of its tube, attracts many insects,\r\namong others, bees of larger and middle size, and the butterflies\r\nfor which it is especially adapted. They alight on the stamens\r\nand pistil on the upper side of the flower. Those with the\r\nlongest tongues stand on one blossom to sip from the next one:\r\nthis is the butterfly's customary attitude. But nearly every\r\nvisitor comes in contact with at least one set of organs. When\r\nDarwin first interpreted the trimorphism of the loosestrife, we\r\ncan realize something of the enthusiasm such a man must have felt\r\nin writing to Gray: \"I am almost stark, staring mad over\r\nlythrum.... For the love of Heaven have a look at some of your\r\nspecies, and if you can get me some seed, do!\"\r\n\r\nLong ago this beautiful plant reached our shores from Europe, and\r\nyear by year is extending its triumphal march westward,\r\nbrightening its course of empire through low meadows and marshes\r\nwith torches that lengthen even as they glow. It is not a spring\r\nflower, even in England; and so when Shakespeare, whose knowledge\r\nof floral nature was second only to that of human nature, wrote\r\nof Ophelia,\r\n\r\n    \"With fantastic garlands did she come,\r\n     Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\"\r\n\r\nis it probable he so combined flowers having different seasons of\r\nbloom? Dr. Prior suggests that the purple orchis (0. mascula)\r\nmight have been the flower Ophelia wore; but, as long purples has\r\nbeen the folk name of this loosestrife from time immemorial in\r\nEngland, it seems likely that Shakespeare for once may have made\r\na mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE WAX-WEED; CLAMMY CUPHEA; TAR-WEED\r\n  (Parsonia petiolata; Cuphea viscosissima of Gray)  Loosestrife\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink, about 1/4 in. across, on short peduncles\r\nfrom leaf axils, solitary or clustered. Calyx sticky, tubular,\r\n12-ribbed, with 6 primary teeth, oblique at mouth, extending into\r\na rounded swelling on upper side at base; 6 unequal, wrinkled\r\npetals, on short claws; 11 or 12 stamens inserted on calyx\r\nthroat; pistil with 2-lobed stigma. Stem: 6 to 20 in. high,\r\nbranched, very sticky-hairy. Leaves: Opposite, on slender\r\npetioles, lance-shaped, rounded at base, harsh to the touch.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, waste places, fields, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Rhode Island to Georgia, westward to Louisiana,\r\nKansas, and Illinois.\r\n\r\nA first cousin of the familiar Mexican cigar plant, or\r\nfire-cracker plant (Cuphea platycentra), whose abundant little\r\nvermilion tubes, with black-edged lower lip tipped with white,\r\nbrighten the borders of so many Northern flower-beds. Kyphos, the\r\nGreek for curved, from which cuphea was derived, has reference to\r\nthe peculiar, swollen little seedpod. From a slit on one side of\r\nthe clammy cuphea's capsule the placenta, set with tiny flattened\r\nseeds, sticks out like a handle. Probably the flower has already\r\nfertilized itself in the bud, although, from the fact that the\r\nplant has taken such pains to punish crawling insect foes by\r\ncoating itself with sticky hairs, one might imagine it was wholly\r\ndependent upon winged insects to transfer its pollen. What an\r\nunworthy relative of the purple loosestrife, whose elaborate\r\nscheme to insure cross-fertilization is one of the botanical\r\nwonders!\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW-BEAUTY; DEER GRASS\r\n  (Rhexia Virginica)  Meadow-beauty family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink, 1 to 1 1/2 in. across, pedicelled,\r\nclustered at top of stem. Calyx 4-lobed, tubular or urn-shaped,\r\nnarrowest at neck; 4 rounded, spreading petals, joined for half\r\ntheir length; 8 equal, prominent stamens in 2 rows; pistil. Stem:\r\n1 to 1 1/2 ft. high, square, more or less hairy, erect, sometimes\r\nbranching at top. Leaves: Opposite, ascending, seated on stem,\r\noval, acute at tip, mostly 5-nerved, the margins saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sandy swamps or near water.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - United States, chiefly east of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nSuggesting a brilliant magenta evening primrose in form, the\r\nmeadow-beauty is likewise a rather niggardly bloomer, only a few\r\nflowers in each cluster opening at once; but where masses adorn\r\nour marshes, we cannot wonder so effective a plant is exported to\r\nEuropean peat gardens. Its lovely sister, the MARYLAND\r\nMEADOW-BEAUTY (R. Mariana), a smaller, less brilliant flower,\r\nfound no farther north than the swamps and pine barrens of New\r\nJersey, also goes abroad to be admired; yet neither is of any\r\nvalue for cutting, for the delicate petals quickly discolor and\r\ndrop off when handled. Blossoms so attractively colored naturally\r\nhave many winged visitors to transfer their pollen. All too soon\r\nafter fertilization the now useless petals fall, leaving the\r\npretty urn-shaped calyx, with the large yellow protruding\r\nstamens, far more conspicuous than some flowers. \"Its\r\nseed-vessels are perfect little cream pitchers of graceful form,\"\r\nsaid Thoreau. Within the smooth capsule the minute seeds are\r\ncoiled like snail-shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT OR SPIKED WILLOW-HERB; FIRE-WEED\r\n  (Chamaenerion angustifolium; Epilobium angustifolium of Gray)\r\nEvening Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Magenta or pink, sometimes pale, or rarely white, more\r\nor less than 1 in. across, in an elongated, terminal, spike-like\r\nraceme. Calyx tubular, narrow, in 4 segments; 4 rounded,\r\nspreading petals; 8 stamens; 1 pistil, hairy at base; the stigma\r\n4-lobed. Stem: 2 to 8 ft. high, simple, smooth, leafy. Leaves:\r\nNarrow, tapering, willow-like, 2 to 6 in. long. Fruit: A slender,\r\ncurved, violet-tinted capsule, from 2 to 3 in. long, containing\r\nnumerous seeds attached to tufts of fluffy, white, silky threads.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, fields, roadsides, especially in\r\nburnt-over districts.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - From Atlantic to Pacific, with few interruptions;\r\nBritish Possessions and United States southward to the Carolinas\r\nand Arizona. Also Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nSpikes of these beautiful brilliant flowers towering upward above\r\ndry soil, particularly where the woodsman's axe and forest fires\r\nhave devastated the landscape, illustrate Nature's abhorrence of\r\nugliness. Other kindly plants have earned the name of fire-weed,\r\nbut none so quickly beautifies the blackened clearings of the\r\npioneer, nor blossoms over the charred trail in the wake of the\r\nlocomotive. Beginning at the bottom of the long spike, the\r\nflowers open in slow succession upward throughout the summer,\r\nleaving behind the attractive seed-vessels, which, splitting\r\nlengthwise in September, send adrift white silky tufts attached\r\nto seeds that will one day cover far distant wastes with beauty.\r\nAlmost perfect rosettes, made by the young plants, are met with\r\non one's winter walks.\r\n\r\nEpi, upon, and lobos, a pod, combine to make a name applicable to\r\nmany flowers of this family. In general structure the fire-weed\r\nclosely resembles its relative the evening primrose. Bees, not\r\nmoths, however, are its benefactors. Coming to a newly opened\r\nflower, the bee finds abundant pollen on the anthers and a sip of\r\nnectar in the cup below. At this stage the flower keeps its still\r\nimmature style curved downward and backward lest it should become\r\nself-fertilized - an evil ever to be guarded against by ambitious\r\nplants. In a few days, or after the pollen has been removed, up\r\nstretches the style, spreading its four receptive stigmas just\r\nwhere an incoming bee, well dusted from a younger flower, must\r\ncertainly leave some pollen on their sticky surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT HAIRY WILLOW-HERB (Epilobium hirsutum), whose white\r\ntufted seeds came over from Europe in the ballast to be blown\r\nover Ontario and the Eastern States, spreads also by underground\r\nshoots, until it seems destined to occupy wide areas. In these\r\nshowy magenta flowers, about one inch across, the stigmas and\r\nanthers mature simultaneously but cross-fertilization is usually\r\ninsured because the former surpass the latter, and naturally are\r\nfirst touched by the insect visitor. In default of visits,\r\nhowever, the stigmas, at length curling backward, come in contact\r\nwith the pollen-laden anthers. The fire-weed, on the contrary, is\r\nunable to fertilize itself.\r\n\r\nA pale magenta-pink or whitish, very small-flowered, branching\r\nspecies, one to two feet high, found in swamps from New Brunswick\r\nto the Pacific, and southward to Delaware, is the LINEAR-LEAVED\r\nWILLOW-HERB (F. lineare), whose distinguishing features are its\r\nvery narrow, acute leaves, its hoariness throughout, the dingy\r\nthreads on its tiny seeds, and the occasional bulblets it bears\r\nnear the base of the stem. It is scarcely to be distinguished by\r\none not well up in field practice from another bog lover, the\r\nDOWNY or SOFT WILLOW-HERB (F. strictum), which, however, is a\r\ntrifle taller, glandular throughout, and with sessile, not\r\npetioled, leaves. The PURPLE-LEAVED WILLOW-HERB (E. coloratum),\r\ncommon in low grounds, may best be named by the reddish-brown\r\ncoma to which its seeds are attached. Both leaves and stem are\r\noften highly colored.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOG WINTERGREEN\r\n  (Pyrola uliginosa; P. rotundifolia, var. uliginosa of Gray)\r\nWintergreen family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Magenta pink, fragrant, about 1/2 in. across, 7 to 15\r\non a leafless scape 6 to 15 in. high. Calyx 5-parted; 5 concave\r\npetals; 10 stamens; style curved upward, exserted. Leaves: From\r\nthe root, broadly oval or round, rather thick and dull, on\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps and bogs.\r\nFlowering Season - June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to British Columbia, southward to New\r\nYork and Colorado.\r\n\r\nFragrant colonies of this little plant cuddled close to the moss\r\nof cool, northern peat bogs draw forth our admiration when we go\r\norchid hunting in early summer. A similar species, the LIVER-LEAF\r\nWINTERGREEN (P. asarifolia), with shining, not dull, leaves and\r\nrose-colored flowers, not to mention minor differences, is\r\nlikewise found in swamps and wet woods. These two wintergreens,\r\nformerly counted mere varieties of the white-flowered\r\nrotundifolia, a lover of dry woods, have now been given specific\r\nindividuality by later-day systematists. Short-lipped bees and\r\nflies may be detected in the act of applying their mouths to the\r\norifices of the anthers through which pollen is shed, and some\r\nmust be carried to the stigma of another flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPSISSEWA; PRINCE'S PINE\r\n  (Chimaphila umbellata)  Wintergreen family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Flesh-colored, or pinkish, fragrant, waxy, usually with\r\ndeep pink ring around center, and the anthers colored; about 1/2\r\nin. across; several flowers in loose, terminal cluster. Calyx\r\n5-cleft; corolla of 5 concave, rounded, spreading petals; 10\r\nstamens, the filaments hairy style short, conical, with a round\r\nstigma. Stem: Trailing far along ground, creeping, or partly\r\nsubterranean, sending up sterile and flowering branches 3 to 10\r\nin. high. Leaves: Opposite or in whorls, evergreen, bright,\r\nshining, spatulate to lance-shaped, sharply saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry woods, sandy leaf-mould.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - British Possessions and the United States north of\r\nGeorgia from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Also Mexico, Europe,\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nA lover of winter indeed (cheima = winter and phileo = to love)\r\nis the prince's pine, whose beautiful dark leaves keep their\r\ncolor and gloss in spite of snow and intense cold. A few yards of\r\nthe trailing stem, easily ripped from the light soil of its\r\nwoodland home, make a charming indoor decoration, especially when\r\nthe little brown seed-cases remain. Few flowers are more\r\nsuggestive of the woods than these shy, dainty, deliciously\r\nfragrant little blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe SPOTTED WINTERGREEN, or PIPSISSEWA (C. maculata), closely\r\nresembles the prince's pine, except that its slightly larger\r\nwhite or pinkish flowers lack the deep pink ring; and the\r\nlance-shaped leaves, with rather distant saw-teeth, are\r\nbeautifully mottled with white along the veins. When we see\r\nshort-lipped bees and flies about these flowers, we may be sure\r\ntheir pollen-covered mouths come in contact with the moist stigma\r\non the summit of the little top-shaped style, and so effect\r\ncross-fertilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD HONEYSUCKLE; PINK, PURPLE, or WILD AZALEA; PINXTER-FLOWER\r\n  (Azalea nudiflora)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Crimson pink, purplish or rose pink, to nearly white, 1\r\n1/2 to 2 in. across, faintly fragrant, clustered, opening before\r\nor with the leaves, and developed from cone-like, scaly brown\r\nbuds. Calyx minute, 5-parted; corolla funnel-shaped, the tube\r\nnarrow, hairy, with 5 regular, spreading lobes; 5 long red\r\nstamens; 1 pistil, declined, protruding. Stem: Shrubby, usually\r\nsimple below, but branching above, 2 to 6 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nUsually clustered, deciduous, oblong, acute at both ends, hairy\r\non midrib.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, rocky woods, or dry woods and\r\nthickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Illinois, and southward to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nWoods and hillsides are glowing with fragrant, rosy masses of\r\nthis lovely azalea, the Pinxter-bloem or Whitsunday flower of the\r\nDutch colonists, long before the seventh Sunday after Easter.\r\nAmong our earliest exports, this hardy shrub, the swamp azalea,\r\nand the superb flame-colored species of the Alleghanies, were\r\nsent early in the eighteenth century to the old country, and\r\nthere crossed with A. Pontica of southern Europe by the Belgian\r\nhorticulturalists, to whom we owe the Ghent azaleas, the final\r\ntriumphs of the hybridizer, that glorify the shrubberies on our\r\nown lawns to-day. The azalea became the national flower of\r\nFlanders. These hardy species lose their leaves in winter,\r\nwhereas the hothouse varieties of A. Indica, a native of China\r\nand Japan, have thickish leaves, almost if not quite evergreen. A\r\nfew of the latter stand our northern winters, especially the pure\r\nwhite variety now quite commonly planted in cemetery lots. In\r\nthat delightfully enthusiastic little book, \"The Garden's Story,\"\r\nMr. Ellwanger says of the Ghent azalea \"In it I find a charm\r\npresented by no other flower. Its soft tints of buff, sulphur,\r\nand primrose; its dazzling shades of apricot, salmon, orange, and\r\nvermilion are always a fresh revelation of color. They have no\r\nparallel among flowers, and exist only in opals, sunset skies,\r\nand the flush of autumn woods.\" Certainly American\r\nhorticulturists were not clever in allowing the industry of\r\nraising these plants from our native stock to thrive on foreign\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nNaturally the azalea's protruding style forms the most convenient\r\nalighting place for the female bee, its chief friend; and there\r\nshe leaves a few grains of pollen, brought on her hairy underside\r\nfrom another flower, before again dusting herself there as she\r\ncrawls over the pretty colored anthers on her way to the nectary.\r\nHoney produced from azaleas by the hive bee is in bad repute. All\r\ntoo soon after fertilization the now useless corolla slides along\r\nto the tip of the pistil, where it swings a while before dropping\r\nto earth.\r\n\r\nOur beautiful wild honeysuckle, called naked (nudiflora), because\r\nvery often the flowers appear before the leaves, has a peculiar\r\nJapanese grace on that account. Every farmer's boy's mouth waters\r\nat sight of the cool, juicy May-apple, the extraordinary pulpy\r\ngrowth on this plant and the swamp pink. This excrescence seems\r\nto have no other use than that of a gratuitous, harmless gift to\r\nthe thirsty child, from whom it exacts no reward of carrying\r\nseeds to plant distant colonies, as the mandrake's yellow,\r\ntomato-like May-apple does. But let him beware, as he is likely\r\nto, of the similar looking, but hollow, stringy apples growing on\r\nthe bushy Andromeda, which turn black with age.\r\n\r\n>From Maine to Florida and westward to Texas, chiefly near the\r\ncoast, in low, wet places only need we look for the SWAMP PINK or\r\nHONEYSUCKLE, WHITE or CLAMMY AZALEA (A. viscosa), a more hairy\r\nspecies than the Pinxter-flower, with a very sticky, glandular\r\ncorolla tube, and deliciously fragrant blossoms, by no means\r\ninvariably white. John Burroughs is not the only one who has\r\npassed \"several patches of swamp honeysuckles, red with blossoms\"\r\n(\"Wake-Robin\"). But as this species does not bloom until June and\r\nJuly, when the sun quickly bleaches the delicate flowers, it is\r\ntrue we most frequently find them white, merely tinged with pink.\r\nThe leaves are well developed before the blossoms appear.\r\nConcerning azaleas' poisonous property, see the discussion under\r\nmountain laurel that follows.\r\n\r\nRHODORA\r\n  (Rhodora Canadensis; Rhododendron Rhodora of Gray)  Heath\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink, rose, or nearly white, 1 1/2 in. broad\r\nor less, in clusters on short, stiff, hairy pedicels, and usually\r\nappearing before the leaves, from scaly, terminal buds. Calyx\r\nminute; corolla 2-lipped, upper lip unequally 2-3 lobed; lower\r\nlip 2-cleft; 10 stamens; pistil, the style slightly protruding.\r\nStem: 1 to 3 ft. high, shrubby, branching. Leaves: Deciduous,\r\noval to oblong, dark green above, pale and hairy beneath.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet hillsides, damp woods, beside sluggish\r\nstreams, cool bogs.\r\nFlowering Season - May.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Pennsylvania mountains.\r\n\r\nA superficial glance at this low, little, thin shrub might\r\nmistake it for a magenta variety of the leafless Pinxter-flower.\r\nIt does its best to console the New Englanders for the scarcity\r\nof the magnificent rhododendron, with which it was formerly\r\nclassed. The Sage of Concord, who became so enamored of it that\r\nMassachusetts people often speak of it as \"Emerson's flower,\"\r\nextols its loveliness in a sonnet:\r\n\r\n     \"Rhodora! If the sages ask thee why\r\n      This charm is wasted on the earth and sky,\r\n      Tell them, dear, if eyes were made for seeing,\r\n      Then Beauty is its own excuse for being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN or GREAT RHODODENDRON; GREAT LAUREL; ROSE TREE, or BAY\r\n  (Rhododendron maximum)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Rose pink, varying to white, greenish in the throat,\r\nspotted with yellow or orange, in broad clusters set like a\r\nbouquet among leaves, and developed from scaly, cone-like buds;\r\npedicels sticky-hairy. Calyx 5-parted, minute; corolla 5-lobed,\r\nbroadly bell-shaped, 2 in. broad or less usually 10 stamens,\r\nequally spreading; pistil. Stem: Sometimes a tree attaining a\r\nheight of 40 ft., usually 6 to 20 ft., shrubby, woody. Leaves:\r\nEvergreen, drooping in winter, leathery, dark green on both\r\nsides, lance-oblong, 4 to 10 in. long, entire edged, narrowing\r\ninto stout petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Mountainous woodland, hillsides near streams.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Uncommon from Ohio and New England to Nova Scotia;\r\nabundant through the Alleghanies to Georgia.\r\n\r\nWhen this most magnificent of our native shrubs covers whole\r\nmountain sides throughout the Alleghany region with bloom, one\r\nstands awed in the presence of such overwhelming beauty. Nowhere\r\nelse does the rhododendron attain such size or luxuriance. There\r\nit produces a tall trunk, and towers among the trees; it spreads\r\nits branches far and wide until they interlock and form almost\r\nimpenetrable thickets locally called \"hells;\" it glorifies the\r\nloneliest mountain road with superb bouquets of its delicate\r\nflowers set among dark, glossy foliage scarcely less attractive.\r\nThe mountain in bloom is worth travelling a thousand miles to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nFarther south the more purplish-pink or lilac-flowered CAROLINA\r\nRHODODENDRON (R. Catawbiense) flourishes. This southern shrub,\r\nwhich is perfectly hardy, unlike its northern sister, has been\r\nused by cultivators as a basis for producing the fine hybrids now\r\nso extensively grown on lawns in this country and Europe. Crossed\r\nwith the Nepal species (R. arboreum) the best results follow.\r\nAmericans, ever too prone to make the eagle scream on their trips\r\nabroad, need not monopolize all the glory for the cultivated\r\nrhododendron, as they are apt to do when they see it on fine\r\nestates in England. The Himalayas, which are covered with\r\nrhododendrons of brighter hue than ours, furnish many of the\r\nshrubs of commerce. Our rhododendron produces one of the hardest\r\nand strongest of woods, weighing thirty-nine pounds per cubic\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nRhododendrons, azaleas, and laurels fall under a common ban\r\npronounced by bee-keepers. The bees which transfer pollen from\r\nblossom to blossom while gathering nectar, manufacture honey said\r\nto be poisonous. Cattle know enough to let all this foliage\r\nalone. Apparently the ants fear no more evil results from the\r\nnectar than the bees themselves; and were it not for the sticky\r\nparts nearest the flowers, on which they crawl to meet their\r\ndeath, the blossom's true benefactors would find little\r\nrefreshment left.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTAIN or AMERICAN LAUREL; CALICO BUSH; SPOONWOOD; CALMOUN;\r\nBROAD-LEAVED KALMIA\r\n  (Kalmia latifolia)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Buds and new flowers bright rose pink, afterward fading\r\nwhite, and only lined with pink, 1 in. across, or less, numerous,\r\nin terminal clusters. Calyx small, 5-parted, sticky corolla like\r\na 5-pointed saucer, with 10 projections on outside; 10 arching\r\nstamens, an anther lodged in each projection; 1 pistil. Stem:\r\nShrubby, woody, stiffly branched, 2 to 20 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nEvergreen, entire, oval to elliptic, pointed at both ends,\r\ntapering into petioles. Fruit: A round, brown capsule, with the\r\nstyle long remaining on it.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sandy or rocky woods, especially in hilly or\r\nmountainous country.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick and Ontario, southward to the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, and westward to Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt would be well if Americans, imitating the Japanese in making\r\npilgrimages to scenes of supreme natural beauty, visited the\r\nmountains, rocky, woody hillsides, ravines, and tree-girt uplands\r\nwhen the laurel is in its glory; when masses of its pink and\r\nwhite blossoms, set among the dark evergreen leaves, flush the\r\nlandscape like Aurora, and are reflected from the pools of\r\nstreams and the serene depths of mountain lakes. Peter Kalm, a\r\nSwedish pupil of Linnaeus, who traveled here early in the\r\neighteenth century, was more impressed by its beauty than that of\r\nany other flower. He introduced the plant to Europe, where it is\r\nknown as kalmia, and extensively cultivated on fine estates that\r\nare thrown open to the public during the flowering season. Even a\r\nflower is not without honor, save in its own country. We have\r\nonly to prepare a border of leaf-mould, take up the young plant\r\nwithout injuring the roots or allowing them to dry, hurry them\r\ninto the ground, and prune back the bush a little, to establish\r\nit in our gardens, where it will bloom freely after the second\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAll the kalmias resort to a most ingenious device for compelling\r\ninsect visitors to carry their pollen from blossom to blossom. A\r\nnewly opened flower has its stigma erected where the incoming bee\r\nmust leave on its sticky surface the four minute orange-like\r\ngrains carried from the anther of another flower on the hairy\r\nunderside of her body. Now, each anther is tucked away in one of\r\nthe ten little pockets of the saucer-shaped blossom, and the\r\nelastic filaments are strained upward like a bow. After hovering\r\nabove the nectary, the bee has only to descend toward it, when\r\nher leg, touching against one of the hair-triggers of the spring\r\ntrap, pop goes the little anther-gun, discharging pollen from its\r\nbores as it flies upward. So delicately is the mechanism\r\nadjusted, the slightest jar or rough handling releases the\r\nanthers; but, on the other hand, should insects be excluded by a\r\nnet stretched over the plant, the flowers will fall off and\r\nwither without firing off their pollen-charged guns. At least,\r\nthis is true in the great majority of tests. As in the case of\r\nhothouse flowers no fertile seed is set when nets keep away the\r\nlaurel's benefactors. One has only to touch the hair-trigger with\r\nthe end of a pin to see how exquisitely delicate is this\r\nprovision for cross-fertilization.\r\n\r\nHowever much we may be cautioned by the apiculturalists against\r\nhoney made from laurel nectar, the bees themselves ignore all\r\nwarnings and apparently without evil results - happily for\r\nflowers dependent upon them and their kin. Mr. Frank R. Cheshire,\r\nin \"Bees and Bee-keeping,\" the standard English work on the\r\nsubject, writes: \"During the celebrated Retreat of the Ten\r\nThousand, as recorded by Xenophon in his 'Anabasis,' the soldiers\r\nregaled themselves upon some honey found near Trebizonde where\r\nwere many beehives. Intoxication with vomiting was the result.\r\nSome were so overcome, he states, as to be incapable of standing.\r\nNot a soldier died, but very many were greatly weakened for\r\nseveral days. Tournefort endeavored to ascertain whether this\r\naccount was corroborated by anything ascertainable in the\r\nlocality, and had good reason to be satisfied respecting it. He\r\nconcluded that the honey had been gathered from a shrub growing\r\nin the neighborhood of Trebizonde, which is well known there as\r\nproducing the before-mentioned effects. It is now agreed that the\r\nplants were species of rhododendron and azaleas. Lamberti\r\nconfirms Xenophon's account by stating that similar effects are\r\nproduced by honey of Colchis, where the same shrubs are common.\r\nIn 1790, even, fatal cases occurred in America in consequence of\r\neating wild honey, which was traced to Kahmia latifolia by an\r\ninquiry instituted under direction of the American government.\r\nHappily, our American cousins are now never likely to thus\r\nsuffer, thanks to drainage, the plow, and the bee-farm.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the beautiful swallow-tail butterflies lays its eggs on\r\nlaurel leaves, that the larvae may feed on them later; yet the\r\nfoliage often proves deadly to more highly organized creatures.\r\nMost cattle know enough to let it alone; nevertheless some fall\r\nvictims to it every year. Even the intelligent grouse, hard\r\npressed with hunger when deep snow covers much of their chosen\r\nfood are sometimes found dead and their crops distended by these\r\nleaves. How far more unkind than the bristly armored thistle's is\r\nthe laurel's method of protecting itself against destruction!\r\nEven the ant, intent on pilfering sweets secreted for bees, it\r\nruthlessly glues to death against its sticky stems and calices.\r\nAccording to Dr. Barton the Indians drink a decoction of kalmia\r\nleaves when they wish to commit suicide.\r\n\r\nAs laurel wood is very hard and solid, weighing forty-four pounds\r\nto the cubic foot, it is in great demand for various purposes,\r\none of them indicated in the plant's popular name of Spoon-wood.\r\n\r\nSHEEP-LAUREL, LAMB-KILL, WICKY, CALF-KILL, SHEEP-POISON\r\nNARROW-LEAVED LAUREL (K. angustifolia), and so on through a list\r\nof folk names testifying chiefly to the plant's wickedness in the\r\npasture, may be especially deadly food for cattle, but it\r\ncertainly is a feast to the eyes. However much we may admire the\r\nsmall, deep crimson-pink flowers that we find in June and July in\r\nmoist fields or swampy ground or on the hillsides, few of us will\r\nagree with Thoreau, who claimed that it is \"handsomer than the\r\nmountain laurel.\" The low shrub may be only six inches high, or\r\nit may attain three feet. The narrow evergreen leaves, pale on\r\nthe underside, have a tendency to form groups of threes, standing\r\nupright when newly put forth, but bent downward with the weight\r\nof age. A peculiarity of the plant is that clusters of leaves\r\nusually terminate the woody stem, for the flowers grow in whorls\r\nor in clusters at the side of it below.\r\n\r\nThe PALE or SWAMP LAUREL (K. glauca), found in cool bogs from\r\nNewfoundland to New Jersey and Michigan, and westward to the\r\nPacific Coast, coats the under side of its mostly upright leaves\r\nwith a smooth whitish bloom like the cabbage's. It is a\r\nstraggling little bush, even lower than the lamb-kill, and an\r\nearlier bloomer, putting forth its loose, niggardly clusters of\r\ndeep rose or lilac-colored flowers in June.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAILING ARBUTUS; MAYFLOWER; GROUND LAUREL\r\n  (Epigaea repens)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pink, fading to nearly white, very fragrant about 1/2\r\nin. across when expanded, few or many in clusters at ends of\r\nbranches. Calyx of 5 dry overlapping sepals; corolla\r\nsalver-shaped, the slender, hairy tube spreading into 5 equal\r\nlobes; 10 stamens; 1 pistil with a column-like style and a\r\n5-lobed stigma. Stem: Spreading over the ground (Epigaea = on the\r\nearth); woody, the leafy twigs covered with rusty hairs. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, oval, rounded at the base, smooth above, more or less\r\nhairy below, evergreen, weather-worn, on short, rusty, hairy\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Light sandy loam in woods, especially under\r\nevergreen trees, or in mossy, rocky places.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Florida, west to Kentucky, and the\r\nNorthwest Territory.\r\n\r\nCan words describe the fragrance of the very breath of spring -\r\nthat delicious commingling of the perfume of arbutus, the odor of\r\npines, and the snow-soaked soil just warming into life? Those who\r\nknow the flower only as it is sold in the city streets, tied with\r\nwet, dirty string into tight bunches, withered and forlorn, can\r\nhave little idea of the joy of finding the pink, pearly blossoms\r\nfreshly opened among the withered leaves of oak and chestnut,\r\nmoss, and pine needles in which they nestle close to the cold\r\nearth in the leafless, windy northern forest. Even in Florida,\r\nwhere broad patches carpet the woods in February, one misses\r\nsomething of the arbutus's accustomed charm simply because there\r\nare no slushy remnants of snow drifts, no reminders of winter\r\nhardships in the vicinity. There can be no glad surprise at\r\nfinding dainty spring flowers in a land of perpetual summer.\r\nLittle wonder that the Pilgrim Fathers, after the first awful\r\nwinter on the \"stern New England coast,\" loved this early\r\nmessenger of hope and gladness above the frozen ground at\r\nPlymouth. In an introductory note to his poem \"The Mayflowers,\"\r\nWhittier states that the name was familiar in England, as the\r\napplication of it to the historic vessel shows; but it was\r\napplied by the English, and still is, to the hawthorn. Its use in\r\nNew England in connection with the trailing arbutus dates from a\r\nvery early day, some claiming that the first Pilgrims so used it\r\nin affectionate memory of the vessel and its English flower\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n    \"Sad Mayflower I watched by winter stars,\r\n       And nursed by winter gales,\r\n     With petals of the sleeted spars,\r\n       And leaves of frozen sails!\r\n\r\n    \"But warmer suns ere long shall bring\r\n       To life the frozen sod,\r\n     And through dead leaves of hope shall spring\r\n       Afresh the flowers of God!\"\r\n\r\nSome have attempted to show that the Pilgrims did not find the\r\nflowers until the last month of spring, and that, therefore, they\r\nwere named Mayflowers. Certainly the arbutus is not a typical May\r\nblossom even in New England. Bryant associates it with the\r\nhepatica, our earliest spring flower, in his poem, \"The,\r\nTwenty-seventh of March\":\r\n\r\n               \"Within the woods\r\n     Tufts of ground laurel, creeping underneath\r\n     The leaves of the last summer, send their sweets\r\n     Upon the chilly air, and by the oak,\r\n     The squirrel cups, a graceful company\r\n     Hide in their bells a soft aerial blue.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little use trying to coax this shyest of sylvan flowers\r\ninto our gardens where other members of its family,\r\nrhododendrons, laurels, and azaleas make themselves delightfully\r\nat home. It is wild as a hawk, an untamable creature that slowly\r\npines to death when brought into contact with civilization.\r\nGreedy street venders, who ruthlessly tear up the plant by the\r\nyard, and others without even the excuse of eking out a paltry\r\nincome by its sale, have already exterminated it within a wide\r\nradius of our Eastern cities. How curious that the majority of\r\npeople show their appreciation of a flower's beauty only by\r\nselfishly, ignorantly picking every specimen they can find!\r\n\r\nIn many localities the arbutus sets no fruit, for it is still\r\nundergoing evolutionary changes looking toward the perfecting of\r\nan elaborate system to insure cross-fertilization. Already it has\r\nattained to perfume, nectar, and color to attract quantities of\r\ninsects, chiefly flies and small female bees but in some flowers\r\nthe anthers produce no pollen for them to carry, while others are\r\nfilled with grains, yet all the stigmas in the neighboring\r\nclusters may be defective. The styles and the filaments are of\r\nseveral different lengths, showing a tendency toward trimorphism,\r\nperhaps, like the wonderful purple loosestrife; but at present\r\nthe flower pursues a most wasteful method of distributing pollen,\r\nand in different sections of the country acts so differently that\r\nits phases are impossible to describe except to the advanced\r\nstudent. They may, however, be best summarized in the words of\r\nProfessor Asa Gray: \"The flowers are of two kinds, each with two\r\nmodifications; the two main kinds characterized by the nature and\r\nperfection of the stigma, along with more or less abortion of the\r\nstamens; their modifications by the length of the style.\"\r\n\r\nWhen our English cousins speak of the arbutus, they have in mind\r\na very different species from ours. Theirs is the late flowering\r\nstrawberry-tree, an evergreen shrub with clustering white\r\nblossoms and beautiful rough, red berries. Indeed, the name\r\narbutus is derived from the Celtic word Arboise, meaning rough\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE or AMERICAN CRANBERRY\r\n  (Oxycoccus macrocarpus; Vaccinium macrocarpon of Gray)\r\nHuckleberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light pink, about 1/2 in. across, nodding on slender\r\npedicels from sides and tips of erect branches. Calyx round, 4-or\r\n5-parted; corolla a long cone in bud, its four or five nearly\r\nseparate, narrow petals turned far backward later; 8 or 10\r\nstamens, the anthers united into a protruding cone, its hollow\r\ntubes shedding pollen by a pore at tip. Stem: Creeping or\r\ntrailing, slender, woody, 1 to 3 ft. long, its leafy branches 8\r\nin. high or less. Leaves: Small, alternate, oblong, evergreen,\r\npale beneath, the edges rolled backward. Fruit: An oblong or\r\novoid, many seeded, juicy red berry (Oxycoccus = sour berry).\r\nPreferred Habitat - Bogs; sandy, swampy meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina, Michigan, and Minnesota northward\r\nand westward.\r\n\r\nA hundred thousand people are interested in the berry of this\r\npretty vine to one who has ever seen its flowers. Yet if the\r\nblossom were less attractive, to insects at least, and took less\r\npains to shake out its pollen upon them as they cling to the cone\r\nto sip its nectar, few berries would accompany the festive\r\nThanksgiving turkey. Cultivators of the cranberry know how\r\nimportant it is to have the flooded bogs well drained before the\r\nflowering season. Water (or ice) may cover the plants to the\r\ndepth of a foot or more all winter and until the 10th of May; and\r\nduring the late summer it is often advisable to overflow the bogs\r\nto prevent injury of the fine, delicate roots from drought, and\r\nto destroy the worm that is the plant's worst enemy; but until\r\nthe flowers have wooed the bees, flies, and other winged\r\nbenefactors, and fruit is well formed, every cultivator knows\r\nenough not to submerge his bog. With flowers under water there\r\nare no insect visitors, consequently no berries. Dense mats of\r\nthe wiry vines should yield about one hundred and fifty bushels\r\nof berries to the acre, under skilful cultivation - a most\r\nprofitable industry, since the cranberry costs less to cultivate,\r\ngather, and market than the strawberry or any of the small\r\nperishable fruits. Planted in muck and sand in the garden, the\r\nvines yield surprisingly good results. The Cape Cod Bell is the\r\nbest known market berry. One of the interesting sights to the\r\ncity loiterer about the New England coast in early autumn is the\r\nberry picking that is conducted on an immense scale. Men, women,\r\nand children drop all other work; whole villages are nearly\r\ndepopulated while daylight lasts; temporary buildings set up on\r\nthe edges of the bogs contain throngs of busy people sorting,\r\nmeasuring, and packing fruit; and lonely railroad stations, piled\r\nhigh with crates, give the branch line its heaviest freight\r\nbusiness of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOOTING STAR; AMERICAN COWSLIP; PRIDE OF OHIO\r\n  (Dodecatheon Meadia)  Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Purplish pink or yellowish white, the cone tipped with\r\nyellow; few or numerous, hanging on slender, recurved pedicels in\r\nan umbel at top of a simple scape 6 in. to 2 ft. high. Calyx\r\ndeeply 5-parted; corolla of 5 narrow lobes bent backward and\r\nupward; the tube very short, thickened at throat, and marked with\r\ndark reddish-purple dots; 5 stamens united into a protruding\r\ncone; 1 pistil, protruding beyond them. Leaves: Oblong or\r\nspatulate 3 to 12 in. long, narrowed into petioles, all from\r\nfibrous roots. Fruit: A 5-valved capsule on erect pedicels.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Prairies, open woods, moist cliffs. Flowering\r\nSeason - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania southward and westward, and from\r\nTexas to Manitoba.\r\n\r\nAges ago Theophrastus called an entirely different plant by this\r\nsame scientific name, derived from dodeka = twelve, and theos =\r\ngods; and although our plant is native of a land unknown to the\r\nancients, the fanciful Linnaeus imagined he saw in the flowers of\r\nits umbel a little congress of their divinities seated around a\r\nminiature Olympus! Who has said science kills imagination? These\r\nhandsome, interesting flowers so familiar in the Middle West and\r\nSouthwest, especially, somewhat resemble the cyclamen in oddity\r\nof form, indeed, these prairie wildflowers are not unknown in\r\nflorists' shops in Eastern cities.\r\n\r\nMany flowers like the shooting star, cyclamen, and nightshade,\r\nwith protruding cones made up of united stamens, are so designed\r\nthat, as the bees must cling to them while sucking nectar, they\r\nreceive pollen jarred out from the end of the cone on their\r\nundersides. The reflexed petals serve three purposes: First, in\r\nmaking the flower more conspicuous; secondly, in facilitating\r\naccess to nectar and pollen; and, finally, in discouraging\r\ncrawling intruders. Where the short tube is thickened, the bee\r\nfinds her foothold while she forces her tongue between the anther\r\ntips. The nectar is well concealed and quite deeply seated,\r\nthanks to the rigid cone. Few bee workers are flying at the\r\nshooting star's early blooming season. Undoubtedly the female\r\nbumblebees, which, by striking the protruding stigma before they\r\njar out any pollen, cross-fertilize it, are the flower's\r\nbenefactors; but one frequently sees the little yellow puddle\r\nbutterfly clinging to the pretty blossoms.\r\n\r\nVery different from the bright yellow cowslip of Europe is our\r\nodd, misnamed blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTER-BLOOM; ROSE-PINK; SQUARE-STEMMED SABBATIA; ROSY CENTAURY\r\n  (Sabbatia angularis)  Gentian family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Clear rose pink, with greenish star in center, rarely\r\nwhite, fragrant, 1 1/2 in. broad or less, usually solitary on\r\nlong peduncles at ends of branches. Calyx lobes very narrow;\r\ncorolla of 5 rounded segments; stamens 5; style 2-cleft. Stem:\r\nSharply 4-angled, 2 to 3 ft. high, with opposite branches, leafy.\r\nLeaves: Opposite, 5-nerved, oval, tapering at tip, and clasping\r\nstem by broad base.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich soil, meadows, thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - New York to Florida, westward to Ontario,\r\nMichigan, and Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nDuring the drought of midsummer the lovely rose-pink blooms\r\ninland with cheerful readiness to adapt itself to harder\r\nconditions than most of its moisture-loving kin will tolerate;\r\nbut it may be noticed that although we may oftentimes find it\r\ngrowing in dry soil, it never spreads in such luxuriant clusters\r\nas when the roots are struck beside meadow runnels and ditches.\r\nProbably the plant would be commoner than it is about populous\r\nEastern districts were it not so much sought after as a tonic\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nIt was the Centaurea, represented here by the blue ragged sailor\r\nof gardens, and not our Centaury, a distinctly American group of\r\nplants, which, Ovid tells us, cured a wound in the foot of the\r\nCentaur Chiron, made by an arrow hurled by Hercules.\r\n\r\nThree exquisite members of the Sabbatia tribe keep close to the\r\nAtlantic coast in salt meadows and marshes, along the borders of\r\nbrackish rivers, and very rarely in the sand at the edges of\r\nfresh-water ponds a little way inland. From Maine to Florida they\r\nrange, and less frequently are met along the shores of the Gulf\r\nof Mexico so far as Louisiana. How bright and dainty and are!\r\nWhole meadows are radiant with their blushing lovliness. Probably\r\nif they consented to live far away from the sea, they would lose\r\nsome of the deep, clear pink from out their lovely petals, since\r\nall flowers show a tendency to brighten their colors as they\r\napproach the coast. In England some of the same wildflowers we\r\nhave here are far deeper-hued, owing, no doubt to the fact that\r\nthey live on a sea-girt, moisture-laden island, and also that the\r\nsun never scorches and blanches at the far north as it does in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, blossoms so bright of hue as the marsh\r\npinks attract many insects. Guided by the yellow eye that serves\r\nas a pathfinder to the nectary, they feast on the generour supply\r\nof sweets; but all unwittingly they must pay for their\r\nentertainment by carrying pollen from early to later flowers.\r\nLike so many other blossoms, the sabbatias guard themselves\r\nagainst the evils of self-fertilization by shedding their pollen\r\nbefore they mature and spread their two-cleft style, which is now\r\nready to receive the golden, quickening dust on its stigmatic\r\ninner surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe SEA or MARSH PINK, or ROSE OF PLYMOUTH (S. stellaris), whose\r\ngraceful alternate branching stem attains a height of two feet\r\nonly under most favorable conditions, from July to September\r\nopens a succession of pink flowers that often fade to white. The\r\nyellow eye is bordered with carmine. They measure about one inch\r\nacross, and are usually solitary at the ends of branches, or else\r\nsway on slender peduncles from the axils. The upper leaves are\r\nnarrow and bract-like; those lower down gradually widen as they\r\napproach the root.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Rose of Plymouth is the even more graceful SLENDER\r\nMARSH PINK (S. Campanulata - the S. gracilis of Gray), whose\r\nupper leaves are almost thread-like in their narrowness. Its five\r\ncalyx lobes, too, are exceedingly slender, and often as long as\r\nthe corolla lobes. One of our soldiers in Cuba, during the\r\nSpanish War, sent home to his sister in Massachusetts some of\r\nthese same little flowers in a letter. \"You would just love to\r\nsee the marshes here,\" he wrote. \"They are filled with beautiful\r\nlittle pink flowers. I wish I knew their names.\" That soldier had\r\npassed by New England marshes aglow with the blossoms all his\r\nlife, but he had never noticed them until all his perceptions\r\nbecame quickened by the stimulus of travel and the excitement of\r\nwar. How blind and deaf we all are in some directions; having\r\neyes we see not, and ears we hear not, in the natural as in the\r\nspiritual realm.\r\n\r\nNo danger of confusing the LARGE MARSH PINK (S. dodecandra - S.\r\nchloroides of Gray) with its smaller, more branching relatives.\r\nIt displays few flowers to a plant, but each measures two and a\r\nhalf inches or less across, and has from nine to twelve pink (or\r\nrarely white) petals. This sabbatia often chooses the sandy\r\nborders of ponds for its habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPREADING DOGBANE; FLY-TRAP DOGBANE; HONEY-BLOOM; BITTER-ROOT\r\n  (Apocynum androsaemifolium)  Dogbane family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Delicate pink, veined with a deeper shade, fragrant,\r\nbell-shaped, about 1/3 in. across, borne in loose terminal cymes.\r\nCalyx 5-parted; corolla of 5 spreading, recurved lobes united\r\ninto a tube; within the tube 5 tiny, triangular appendages\r\nalternate with stamens; the arrow-shaped anthers united around\r\nthe stigma and slightly adhering to it. Stem: 1 to 4 ft. high,\r\nwith forking, spreading, leafy branches. Leaves: Opposite,\r\nentire-edged, broadly oval, narrow at base, paler, and more or\r\nless hairy below. Fruit: Two pods about 4 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, thickets, beside roads, lanes, and\r\nwalls.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Northern part of British Possessions south to\r\nGeorgia, westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nEverywhere at the North we come across this interesting, rather\r\nshrubby plant, with its pretty but inconspicuous little\r\nrose-veined bells suggesting pink lilies-of-the-valley. Now that\r\nwe have learned to read the faces of flowers, as it were, we\r\ninstantly suspect by the color, fragrance, pathfinders, and\r\nstructure that these are artful wilers, intent on gaining ends of\r\ntheir own through their insect admirers. What are they up to?\r\n\r\nLet us watch. Bees, flies, moths, and butterflies, especially the\r\nlatter, hover near. Alighting, the butterfly visitor unrolls his\r\nlong tongue and inserts it where the five pink veins tell him to,\r\nfor five nectar-bearing glands stand in a ring around the base of\r\nthe pistil. Now, as he withdraws his slender tongue through one\r\nof the V-shaped cavities that make a circle of traps, he may\r\ncount himself lucky to escape with no heavier toll imposed than\r\npollen cemented to it. This granular dust he is required to rub\r\noff against the stigma of the next flower entered. Some bees,\r\ntoo, have been taken with the dogbane's pollen cemented to their\r\ntongues. But suppose a fly call upon this innocent-looking\r\nblossom? His short tongue, as well as the butterfly's, is guided\r\ninto one of the V-shaped cavities after he has sipped; but,\r\ngetting wedged between the trap's horny teeth, the poor little\r\nvictim is held a prisoner there until he slowly dies of\r\nstarvation in sight of plenty. This is the penalty he must pay\r\nfor trespassing on the butterfly's preserves! The dogbane, which\r\nis perfectly adapted to the butterfly, and dependent upon it for\r\nhelp in producing fertile seed, ruthlessly destroys all poachers\r\nthat are not big or strong enough to jerk away from its vise-like\r\ngrasp. One often sees small flies and even moths dead and\r\ndangling by the tongue from the wicked little charmers. If the\r\nflower assimilated their dead bodies as the pitcher plant, for\r\nexample, does those of its victims, the fly's fate would seem\r\nless cruel. To be killed by slow torture and dangled like a\r\nscarecrow simply for pilfering a drop of nectar is surely an\r\nexecution of justice medieval in its severity.\r\n\r\nIn July the most splendid of our native beetles, the green dandy\r\n(Eumolpus auratus) fastens itself to the dogbane's foliage in\r\nnumbers until often the leaves appear to be studded with these\r\nbrilliant little jewels. \"It is not easy,\" says William Hamilton\r\nGibson, \"to describe its burnished hue, which is either\r\nshimmering green, or peacock blue, or purplish-green, or\r\nrefulgent ruby, according to the position in which it rests.\" But\r\nit is not golden, as its specific name would imply. It confines\r\nitself exclusively to the dogbane. To prevent capture, it has a\r\ntrick of drawing up its legs and rolling off into the grass its\r\nbody so cleverly matches.\r\n\r\n>From the silky coma on which the small seeds float away from long\r\npods to found new colonies, from the opposite leaves, milky\r\njuice, and certain structural resemblances in the flowers, one\r\nmight guess this plant belonged to the milkweed tribe. Formerly\r\nit was so classed; and although the botanists have now removed\r\nits family one step away, the milkweed butterflies, especially\r\nthe Monarch (Anosia plexippus), ignoring the arbitrary dividing\r\nline of man, still includes the dogbane on its visiting list. We\r\nknow that this plant derived its name from the fact that it was\r\nconsidered poisonous to dogs; and we also know that all the tribe\r\nof milkweed butterflies are provided with protective secretions\r\nwhich are distasteful to birds and predaceous insects, enjoying\r\ntheir immunity from attack, it is thought, from the acrid,\r\npoisonous character of the foliage on which the caterpillars\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON MIIKWEED or SILKWEED\r\n  (Asclepias Syriaca; A. cornuti of Gray)  Milkweed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull pale greenish purple pink, or brownish pink, borne\r\non pedicels, in many flowered, broad umbels. Calyx inferior,\r\n5-parted; corolla deeply 5-cleft, the segments turned backward.\r\nAbove them an erect, 5-parted crown, each part called a hood,\r\ncontaining a nectary, and with a tooth on either side, and an\r\nincurved horn projecting from within. Behind the crown the short,\r\nstout stamens, united by their filaments in a tube, are inserted\r\non the corolla. Broad anthers united around a thick column of\r\npistils terminating in a large, sticky, 5-angled disk. The anther\r\nsacs tipped with a winged membrane; a waxy, pear-shaped\r\npollen-mass in each sac connected with the stigma in pairs or\r\nfours by a dark gland, and suspended by a stalk like a pair of\r\nsaddle-bags. Stem: Stout, leafy, usually unbranched, 3 to 5 ft.\r\nhigh, juice milky. Leaves: Opposite, oblong, entire-edged smooth\r\nabove, hairy below, 4 to 9 in. long. Fruit: 2 thick, warty pods,\r\nusually only one filled with compressed seeds attached to tufts\r\nof silky, white, fluffy hairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields and waste places, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick, far westward and southward to North\r\nCarolina and Kansas.\r\n\r\nAfter the orchids, no flowers show greater executive ability,\r\nnone have adopted more ingenious methods of compelling insects to\r\nwork for them than the milkweeds. Wonderfully have they perfected\r\ntheir mechanism in every part until no member of the family even\r\nattempts to fertilize itself; hence their triumphal, vigorous\r\nmarch around the earth, the tribe numbering over nineteen hundred\r\nspecies located chiefly in those tropical and warm, temperate\r\nregions that teem with insect life.\r\n\r\nCommonest of all with us is this rank weed, which possesses the\r\ndignity of a rubber plant. Much more attractive to human eyes, at\r\nleast, than the dull, pale, brownish-pink umbels of flowers are\r\nits exquisite silky seed-tufts. But not so with insects. Knowing\r\nthat the slightly fragrant blossoms are rich in nectar, bees,\r\nwasps, flies, beetles, and butterflies come to feast. Now, the\r\nvisitor finding his alighting place slippery, his feet claw about\r\nin all directions to secure a hold, just as it was planned they\r\nshould for in his struggles some of his feet must get caught in\r\nthe fine little clefts at the base of the flower. His efforts to\r\nextricate his foot only draw it into a slot at the end of which\r\nlies a little dark-brown body. In a newly opened flower five of\r\nthese little bodies may be seen between the horns of the crown,\r\nat equal distances around it. This tiny brown excrescence is hard\r\nand horny, with a notch in its face. It is continuous with and\r\nforms the end of the slot in which the visitor's foot is caught.\r\nInto this he must draw his foot or claw, and finding it rather\r\ntightly held, must give a vigorous jerk to get it free. Attached\r\nto either side of the little horny piece is a flattened yellow\r\npollen-mass, and so away he flies with a pair of these pollinia,\r\nthat look like tiny saddle-bags, dangling from his feet. One\r\nmight think that such rough handling as many insects must submit\r\nto from flowers would discourage them from making any more\r\nvisits; but the desire for food is a mighty passion. While the\r\ninsect is flying off to another blossom, the stalk to which the\r\nsaddlebags are attached twists until it brings them together,\r\nthat, when his feet get caught in other slots, they may be in the\r\nposition to get broken off in his struggles for freedom precisely\r\nwhere they will fertilize the stigmatic chambers. Now the visitor\r\nflies away with the stalks alone sticking to his claws.\r\nBumblebees and hive-bees have been caught with a dozen\r\npollen-masses dangling from a single foot. Outrageous imposition!\r\n\r\nDoes this wonderful mechanism always work to perfection? Alas!\r\nno. It is a common thing to find dead hive-bees and flies hanging\r\nfrom the flowers. While still struggling to escape, the unhappy\r\nvictims will be attacked by ants, beetles, and spiders, or killed\r\nby heavy showers. Larger and stronger insects than honeybees are\r\nrequired to regularly effect pollination and free themselves,\r\nespecially when they are so unfortunate as to catch several feet\r\nin the grooves. Doubtless it is the bumblebee that can transfer\r\npollen with impunity; but very many other insects, not perfectly\r\nadapted to the flowers, occasionally benefit them. Among the\r\nlarge butterflies the Papilios, which suck with their wings in\r\nmotion, are the most useful, because in using their legs to\r\noffset the motion of their wings they rapidly repeat those\r\nmovements which are necessary to draw the pollinia from the\r\nanther cells and insert them in the stigmatic chambers of other\r\nflowers. \"Large butterflies like Danais,\" says Professor\r\nRobertson, \"hold their wings still in sucking, spending more time\r\non an umbel, but generally carrying pollinia. Small butterflies\r\nare worse than useless. They remain long on the umbels sucking,\r\nbut resting their feet superficially on the flowers.\r\n\r\nSince several moths were found entrapped, pollination must often\r\nbe brought about by night-flying Lepidoptera. As a rule, Diptera\r\n(flies) either do not transfer pollinia at all, or become\r\nhopelessly entangled when they do. \"Occasionally pollen-masses\r\nare found on the tongues of insects, especially on those of bees\r\nand wasps, which move about with their unruly member sticking\r\nout. Probably no one has ever made the exhaustive and absorbingly\r\ninteresting study of the milkweeds that Professor Robertson has.\r\n\r\nBetter than any written description of the milkweed blossom's\r\nmechanism is a simple experiment. If you have neither time nor\r\npatience to sit in the hot sun, magnifying glass in hand, and\r\nwatch for an unwary insect to get caught, take an ordinary\r\nhousefly, and hold it by the wings so that it may claw at one of\r\nthe newly opened flowers from which no pollinia have been\r\nremoved. It tries frantically to hold on, and with a little\r\ndirection it may be led to catch its claws in the slots of the\r\nflower. Now pull it gently away, and you will find a pair of\r\nsaddlebags slung over his foot by a slender curved stalk. If you\r\nare rarely skilful, you may induce your fly to withdraw the\r\npollinia from all five slots on as many of his feet. And they are\r\nnot to be thrown or scraped off, let the fly try as hard as he\r\npleases. You may now invite the fly to take a walk on another\r\nflower in which he will probably leave one or more pollinia in\r\nits stigmatic cavities.\r\n\r\nDr. Kerner thought the milky juice in milkweed plants, especially\r\nabundant in the uppermost leaves and stems, serves to protect the\r\nflowers from useless crawling pilferers. He once started a number\r\nof ants to climb up a milky stalk. When they neared the summit,\r\nhe noticed that at each movement the terminal hooks of their feet\r\ncut through the tender epiderm, and from the little clefts the\r\nmilky juice began to flow, bedraggling their feet and the hind\r\npart of their bodies. \"The ants were much impeded in their\r\nmovements,\" he writes, \"and in order to rid themselves of the\r\nannoyance, drew their feet through their mouths. Their movements\r\nhowever, which accompanied these efforts, simply resulted in\r\nmaking fresh fissures and fresh discharges of milky juice, so\r\nthat the position of the ants became each moment worse and worse.\r\nMany escaped by getting to the edge of a leaf and dropping to the\r\nground. Others tried this method of escape too late, for the air\r\nsoon hardened the milky juice into a tough brown substance, and\r\nafter this, all the strugglings of the ants to free themselves\r\nfrom the viscid matter were in vain.\" Nature's methods of\r\npreserving a flower's nectar for the insects that are especially\r\nadapted to fertilize it, and of punishing all useless intruders,\r\noften shock us yet justice is ever stern, ever kind in the\r\nlargest sense.\r\n\r\nIf the asclepias really do kill some insects with their juice,\r\nothers doubtless owe their lives to it. Among the \"protected\"\r\ninsects are the milkweed butterflies and their caterpillars,\r\nwhich are provided with secretions that are distasteful to birds\r\nand predaceous insects. \"These acrid secretions are probably due\r\nto the character of the plants upon which the caterpillars feed,\"\r\nsays Dr. Holland, in his beautiful and invaluable \"Butterfly\r\nBook.\" \"Enjoying on this account immunity from attack, they have\r\nall, in the process of time, been mimicked by species in other\r\ngenera which have not the same immunity.\" \"One cannot stay long\r\naround a patch of milkweeds without seeing the monarch butterfly.\r\n(Anosia plexippus), that splendid, bright, reddish-brown winged\r\nfellow, the borders and veins broadly black, with two rows of\r\nwhite spots on the outer borders and two rows of pale spots\r\nacross the tip of the fore wings. There is a black scent-pouch on\r\nthe hind wings. The caterpillar, which is bright yellow or\r\ngreenish yellow, banded with shining black, is furnished with\r\nblack fleshy 'horns' fore and aft.\"\r\n\r\nLike the dandelion, thistle, and other triumphant strugglers for\r\nsurvival, the milkweed sends its offspring adrift on the winds to\r\nfound fresh colonies afar. Children delight in making pompons for\r\ntheir hats by removing the silky seed-tufts from pods before they\r\nburst, and winding them, one by one, on slender stems with fine\r\nthread. Hung in the sunshine, how charmingly fluffy and soft they\r\ndry!\r\n\r\nAmong the comparatively few butterfly flowers - although, of\r\ncourse, other insects not adapted to them are visitors - is the\r\nPURPLE MILKWEED (A. purpurasceus), whose deep magenta umbels are\r\nso conspicuous through the summer months. Hummingbirds\r\noccasionally seek it too. From Eastern Massachusetts to Virginia,\r\nand westward to the Mississippi, or beyond, it is to be found in\r\ndry fields, woods, and thickets.\r\n\r\nThe SWAMP MILKWEED (A. incarnata), on the other hand, rears its\r\nintense purplish-red or pinkish hoods in wet places. Its leaves\r\nare lance-shaped or oblong-lanceolate, whereas the purple\r\nmilkweed's leaves are oblong or ovate-oblong. This is a smooth\r\nplant; and a similar species once reckoned as a mere variety (A.\r\npulchra) is the HAIRY MILKWEED. It differs chiefly in having some\r\nhairs on the under side of its leaves, and a great many hairs on\r\nits stem. Both plants bear erect, rather slender, tapering pods.\r\n\r\nThe POKE or TALL MILKWEED (A. exaltata - A. phytolaecoides of\r\nGray) may attain a height of six feet if the moist soil in which\r\nit grows be exactly to its liking. Drooping or spreading umbels\r\nof flowers whose corolla segments are pale purplish green, and\r\nwhose crown is clear ivory white or pink, appear from June to\r\nAugust from Maine to Georgia and far westward. Sometimes the\r\ntapering oblong leaves may be nine inches long. The erect\r\nseedpods are drawn out to an unusually long point.\r\n\r\nOne may always distinguish the low-growing FOUR-LEAVED MILKWEED\r\n(A. quadrifolia) from its relatives of ranker growth by its\r\ngeneral air of refinement, as well as by the two pairs of thin,\r\ntapering leaves that grow in an upright whorl near the middle of\r\nthe slender stem. Usually there are no leaves on the lower part.\r\nSmall terminal umbels of delicate pink and white fragrant\r\nflowers, which appear from May till July, give place to very\r\nnarrow pointed pods in late summer. From Maine to Ontario\r\nsouthward to North Carolina and Arkansas is its range, in woods\r\nand thickets chiefly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEDGE or GREAT BINDWEED; WILD MORNING-GLORY; RUTLAND BEAUTY;\r\nBELL-BIND; LADY'S NIGHTCAP\r\n\r\n  (Convolvulus sepium; Calystegia sepium of Gray)  Morning-glory\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light pink, with white stripes or all white,\r\nbell-shaped, about 2 in. long, twisted in the bud, solitary, on\r\nlong peduncles from leaf axils. Calyx of 5 sepals, concealed by 2\r\nlarge bracts at base. Corolla 5-lobed, the 5 included stamens\r\ninserted on its tube; style with 2 oblong stigmas. Stem: Smooth\r\nor hairy, 3 to 10 ft. long, twining or trailing over ground.\r\nLeaves: Triangular or arrow-shaped, 2 to 5 in. long, on slender\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wayside hedges, thickets, fields, walls.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to North Carolina, westward to\r\nNebraska. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nNo one need be told that the pretty, bell-shaped pink and white\r\nflower on the vigorous vine clambering over stone walls and\r\nwinding about the shrubbery of wayside thickets in a suffocating\r\nembrace is akin to the morning-glory of the garden trellis (C.\r\nmajor). An exceedingly rapid climber, the twining stem often\r\ndescribes a complete circle in two hours, turning against the\r\nsun, or just contrary to the hands of a watch. Late in the\r\nseason, when an abundance of seed has been set, the flower can\r\nwell afford to keep open longer hours, also in rainy weather; but\r\nearly in the summer, at least, it must attend to business only\r\nwhile the sun shines and its benefactors are flying. Usually it\r\ncloses at sundown. On moonlight nights, however, the hospitable\r\nblossom keeps open for the benefit of certain moths. In Europe\r\nthe plant's range is supposed to be limited to that of a\r\ncrepuscular moth (Sphinx convolvuli), and where that benefactor\r\nis rare, as in England, the bindweed sets few seeds where it does\r\nnot occur, as in Scotland, this convolvulus is seldom found wild;\r\nwhereas in Italy Delpino tells of catching numbers of the moths\r\nin hedges overgrown with the common plant, by standing with thumb\r\nand forefinger over a flower, ready to close it when the insect\r\nhas entered. We know that every floral clock is regulated by the\r\nhours of flight of its insect friends. When they have retired,\r\nthe flowers close to protect nectar and pollen from useless\r\npilferers. In this country various species of bees chiefly\r\nfertilize the bindweed blossoms. Guided by the white streaks, or\r\npathfinders, they crawl into the deep tube and sip through one of\r\nthe five narrow passages leading to the nectary. A transverse\r\nsection of the flower cut to show these five passages standing in\r\na circle around the central ovary looks like the end of a\r\nfive-barreled revolver. Insects without a suitably long proboscis\r\nare, of course, excluded by this arrangement.\r\n\r\n>From July until hard frost look for that exquisite little beetle,\r\nCassida aurichalcea, like a drop of molten gold, clinging beneath\r\nthe bindweed's leaves. The small perforations reveal his hiding\r\nplaces. \"But you must be quick if you would capture him,\" says\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson, \"for he is off in a spangling streak of\r\nglitter. Nor is this golden sheen all the resource of the little\r\ninsect; for in the space of a few seconds, as you hold him in\r\nyour hand, he has become a milky, iridescent opal, and now\r\nmother-of-pearl, and finally crawls before you in a coat of dull\r\norange.\" A dead beetle loses all this wonderful luster. Even on\r\nthe morning-glory in our gardens we may sometimes find these\r\njeweled mites, or their fork-tailed, black larvae, or the tiny\r\nchrysalids suspended by their tails, although it is the wild\r\nbindweed that is ever their favorite abiding place.\r\n\r\nThe small FIELD BINDWEED (C. arvensis), a common immigrant from\r\nEurope, which has taken up its abode from Nova Scotia and Ontario\r\nsouthward to New Jersey, and westward to Kansas, trails over the\r\nground with a deathless persistency which fills farmers with\r\ndismay. It is like a small edition of the hedge bind weed, only\r\nits calyx lacks the leaf-like bracts at its base, its slender\r\nstem rarely exceeds two feet in length, and the little pink and\r\nwhite flowers often grow in pairs. Their habit of closing both in\r\nthe evening and in rainy weather indicates that they are adapted\r\nfor diurnal insects only; but if the bell hang down, or if the\r\ncorolla drop off, the pollen must fall on the stigma and effect\r\nself-fertilization. Many more insects visit this flower than the\r\nlarge bindweed, attracted by the peculiar fragrance, and led by\r\nthe white streaks to the orange-colored under surface of the\r\novary, where the nectar lies concealed. Stigmas and anthers\r\nmature at the same time; but as the former are slightly the\r\nlonger, they receive pollen brought from another flower before\r\nthe visitor gets freshly dusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND OR MOSS PINK\r\n  (Phlox subulata)  Phlox family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very numerous, small, deep purplish pink, lavender or\r\nrose, varying to white, with a darker eye, growing in simple\r\ncymes, or solitary in a Western variety. Calyx with 5 slender\r\nteeth; corolla salver-form with 5 spreading lobes; 5 stamens\r\ninserted on corolla tube; style 3-lobed. Stems: Rarely exceeding\r\n6 in. in height, tufted like mats, much branched, plentifully set\r\nwith awl-shaped, evergreen leaves barely 1/2 in. long, growing in\r\ntufts at joints of stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky ground, hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June\r\nDistribution - Southern New York to Florida, westward to Michigan\r\nand Kentucky.\r\n\r\nA charming little plant, growing in dense evergreen mats with\r\nwhich Nature carpets dry, sandy, and rocky hillsides, is often\r\ncompletely hidden beneath its wealth of flowers. Far beyond its\r\nnatural range, as well as within it, the moss pink glows in\r\ngardens, cemeteries and parks, wherever there are rocks to\r\nconceal or sterile wastes to beautify. Very slight encouragement\r\ninduces it to run wild. There are great rocks in Central Park,\r\nNew York, worth travelling miles to see in early May, when their\r\nstern faces are flushed and smiling with these blossoms.\r\n\r\nAnother low ground species is the CRAWLING PHLOX (P. reptans). It\r\nrarely exceeds six inches in height; nevertheless its larger\r\npink, purple, or white flowers, clustered after the manner of the\r\ntall garden phloxes, are among the most showy to be found in the\r\nspring woods. A number of sterile shoots with obovate leaves,\r\ntapering toward the base, rise from the runners and set off the\r\nbrilliant blossoms among their neat foliage. From Pennsylvania\r\nsouthward and westward is its range, especially in mountainous\r\nregions; but this plant, too, was long ago transplanted from\r\nNature's gardens into man's.\r\n\r\nLarge patches of the DOWNY PHLOX (P. pilosa) brighten dry prairie\r\nland with its pinkish blossoms in late spring. Britton and\r\nBrown's botany gives its range as \"Ontario to Manitoba, New\r\nJersey, Florida, Arkansas, and Texas.\" The plant does its best to\r\nattain a height of two feet; usually its flowers are much nearer\r\nthe ground. Butterflies, the principal visitors of most phloxes,\r\nalthough long-tongued bees and even flies can sip their nectar,\r\nare ever seen hovering above them and transferring pollen,\r\nalthough in this species the style is so short pollen must often\r\nfall into the tube and self-fertilize the stigma. To protect the\r\nflowers from useless crawling visitors, the calices are coated\r\nwith sticky matter, and the stems are downy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBEDIENT PLANT; FALSE DRAGONHEAD; LION'S HEART\r\n  (Physostegia Virginiana)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale magenta, purplish rose, or flesh-colored, often\r\nvariegated with white, 1 in. long or over, in dense spikes from 4\r\nto 8 in. long. Calyx a 5-toothed oblong bell, swollen and\r\nremaining open in fruit, held up by lance-shaped bracts. Corolla\r\ntubular and much enlarged where it divides into 2 lips, the upper\r\nlip concave, rounded, entire, the lower lip 3 lobed. Stamens 4,\r\nin two pairs under roof of upper lip, the filaments hairy; 1\r\npistil. Stem: 1 to 4 ft. high, simple or branched above, leafy.\r\nLeaves: Opposite, firm, oblong to oblong-lanceolate, narrowing at\r\nbase, deeply saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to the Northwest Territory, southward to\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico as far west as Texas.\r\n\r\nBright patches of this curious flower enliven railroad ditches,\r\ngutters, moist meadows and brooksides - curious, for it has the\r\npeculiarity of remaining in any position in which it is placed.\r\nWith one puff a child can easily blow the blossoms to the\r\nopposite side of the spike, there to stay in meek obedience to\r\nhis will. \"The flowers are made to assume their definite\r\nposition,\" says Professor W. W. Bailey in the \"Botanical\r\nGazette,\" \"by friction of the pedicels against the subtending\r\nbracts. Remove the bracts, and they at once fall limp.\"\r\n\r\nQf course the plant has some better reason for this peculiar\r\nobedience to every breath that blows than to amuse windy-cheeked\r\nboys and girls. Is not the ready movement useful during stormy\r\nweather in turning the mouth of the flower away from driving\r\nrain, and in fair days, when insects are abroad, in presenting\r\nits gaping lips where they can best alight? We all know that\r\ninsects, like birds, make long flights most easily with the wind,\r\nbut in rising and alighting it is their practice to turn against\r\nit. When bees, for example, are out for food on windy days, and\r\nmust make frequent stops for refreshment among the flowers, they\r\nwill be found going against the wind, possibly to catch the\r\nwhiffs of fragrance borne on it that guide them to feast, but\r\nmore likely that they may rise and alight readily. One always\r\nsees bumblebees conspicuous among the obedient plant's visitors.\r\nAfter the anthers have shed their pollen - and tiny teeth at the\r\nedges of the outer pair aid its complete removal by insects - the\r\nstigma comes up to occupy their place under the roof. Certainly\r\nthis flower; which is so ill-adapted to fertilize itself, has\r\nevery reason to court insect messengers in fair and stormy\r\n'weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHERWORT\r\n  (Leonurus Cardiaca)  Mint family.\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull purple pink, pale purple, or white, small,\r\nclustered in axils of upper leaves. Calyx tubular, bell-shaped,\r\nwith 5 rigid awl-like teeth; corolla 2-lipped, upper lip arched,\r\nwoolly without; lower lip 3-lobed, spreading, mottled; the tube\r\nwith oblique ring of hairs inside. Four twin-like stamens,\r\nanterior pair longer, reaching under upper lip; style 2-cleft at\r\nsummit. Stem: 2 to 5 ft. tall, straight, branched, leafy,\r\npurplish. Leaves: Opposite, on slender petioles; lower ones\r\nrounded, 2 to 4 in. broad, palmately cut into 2 to 5 lobes; upper\r\nleaves narrower, 3-cleft or 3- toothed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places near dwellings.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia southward to North Carolina, west to\r\nMinnesota and Nebraska. Naturalized from Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n\"One is tempted to say that the most human plants, after all, are\r\nthe weeds,\" says John Burroughs. \"How they cling to man and\r\nfollow him around the world, and spring up wherever he sets foot\r\nHow they crowd around his barns and dwellings, and throng his\r\ngarden, and jostle and override each other in their strife to be\r\nnear him! Some of them are so domestic and familiar, and so\r\nharmless withal, that one comes to regard them with positive\r\naffection. Motherwort, catnip, plantain, tansy, wild mustard -\r\nwhat a homely, human look they have! They are an integral part of\r\nevery old homestead. Your smart, new place will wait long before\r\nthey draw near it.\"\r\n\r\nHow the bees love this generous, old-fashioned entertainer! One\r\nnearly always sees them clinging to the close whorls of flowers\r\nthat are strung along the stem, and of course transferring\r\npollen, in recompense, as they journey on. A more credulous\r\ngeneration imported the plant for its alleged healing virtues.\r\nWhat is the significance of its Greek name, meaning a lion's\r\ntail? Let no one suggest, by a far-stretched metaphor, that our\r\ngrandmothers, in Revolutionary days, enjoyed pulling it to vent\r\ntheir animosity against the British.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD BERGAMOT\r\n  (Monarda fisiulosa)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Extremely variable, purplish, lavender, magenta, rose,\r\npink, yellowish pink, or whitish, dotted; clustered in a\r\nsolitary, nearly flat terminal head. Calyx tubular, narrow,\r\n5-toothed, very hairy within. Corolla 1 to 1 1/2 in. long,\r\ntubular, 2-lipped, upper lip erect, toothed; lower lip spreading,\r\n3-lobed, middle lobe longest; 2 anther-bearing stamens\r\nprotruding; 1 pistil; the style 2-lobed. Stem: 2 to 3 ft. high,\r\nrough, branched. Leaves: Opposite, lance-shaped, saw-edged, on\r\nslender petioles, aromatic, bracts and upper leaves whitish or\r\nthe color of flower.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open woods, thickets, dry rocky hills.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Eastern Canada and Maine, westward to Minnesota,\r\nsouth to Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen different shades of bloom worn by this handsome,\r\nrobust perennial afford an excellent illustration of the trials\r\nthat beset one who would arbitrarily group flowers according to\r\ncolor. If the capricious blossom shows a decided preference for\r\nany shade, it is for magenta, the royal purple of the ancients,\r\nscarcely tolerated now except by Hoboken Dutch and the belles of\r\nthe kitchen, whose Sunday hats are resplendent with intense\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nOnly a few bergamot flowers open at a time; the rest of the\r\nslightly rounded head, thickly set with hairy calices, looks as\r\nif it might be placed in a glass cup and make an excellent pen\r\nwiper. If the cultivated human eye (and stomach) revolt at\r\nmagenta, It is ever a favorite shade with butterflies. They\r\nflutter in ecstasy over the gay flowers; indeed, they are the\r\nprincipal visitors and benefactors, for the erect corollas,\r\nexposed organs, and level-topped heads are well adapted to their\r\nrequirements. That exquisite little feathered jewel, the\r\nruby-throated hummingbird, flashes about the bright patches an\r\ninstant, and is gone; but he too has paid for his feast in\r\ntransferring pollen. Insects which land anywhere they please on\r\nthe flowers, receive pollen on various places, just as in the\r\ncase of the scarlet Oswego tea, of similar formation. Small bees,\r\nwhich if unable to drain the brimming tubes of nectar, at least\r\nsip from them and help themselves to pollen also, without paying\r\nthe flower's price; and certain mischievous wasps, forever bent\r\non nipping holes in tubes they cannot honestly drain, give a\r\nscore of other pilferers an opportunity to steal sweets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKE-HEAD; TURTLE-HEAD; BALMONY; SHELL-FLOWER; COD-HEAD\r\n  (Chelone glabra)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White tinged with pink, or all white, about 1 in. long,\r\ngrowing in a dense terminal cluster. Calyx 5-parted, bracted at\r\nbase; corolla irregular, broadly tubular, 2-lipped; upper lip\r\narched, swollen, slightly notched; lower lip 3-lobed, spreading,\r\nwoolly within; 5 stamens, sterile, 4 in pairs, anther-bearing,\r\nwoolly; 1 pistil. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, erect, smooth, simple,\r\nleafy. Leaves: Opposite, lance-shaped, saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Ditches, beside streams, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Florida, and half way across the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nIt requires something of a struggle for even so strong and\r\nvigorous an insect as the bumblebee to gain admission to this\r\ninhospitable-looking flower before maturity; and even he abandons\r\nthe attempt over and over again in its earliest stage before the\r\nlittle heart-shaped anthers are prepared to dust him over. As\r\nthey mature, it opens slightly, but his weight alone is\r\ninsufficient to bend down the stiff, yet elastic, lower lip.\r\nEnergetic prying admits first his head, then he squeezes his body\r\nthrough, brushing past the stamens as he finally disappears\r\ninside. At the moment when he is forcing his way in, causing the\r\nlower lip to spring up and down, the eyeless turtle seems to chew\r\nand chew until the most sedate beholder must smile at the\r\nparadoxical show. Of course it is the bee that is feeding, though\r\nthe flower would seem to be masticating the bee with the keenest\r\nrelish The counterfeit tortoise soon disgorges its lively\r\nmouthful, however, and away flies the bee, carrying pollen on his\r\nvelvety back to rub on the stigma of an older flower. After the\r\nanthers have shed their pollen and become effete, the stigma\r\nmatures, and occupies their place. By this time the flower\r\npresents a wider entrance, and as the moisture-loving plant keeps\r\nthe nectaries abundantly filled, what is to prevent insects too\r\nsmall to come in contact with anthers and stigma in the roof from\r\npilfering to their heart's content? The woolly throat discourages\r\nmany, to be sure; but the turtle-head, like its cousins the\r\nbeard-tongues, has a sterile fifth stamen, whose greatest use is\r\nto act as a drop-bar across the base of the flower. The\r\nlong-tongued bumblebee can get his drink over the bar, but\r\nsmaller, unwelcome visitors are literally barred out.\r\n\r\nIf bees are the preferred visitors of the turtle-head, why do we\r\nfind the Baltimore butterfly, that very beautiful, but freaky,\r\ncreature (Melitaea phaeton) hovering near? - that is, when we\r\nfind it at all; for where it is present, it swarms, and keeps\r\naway from other localities altogether. On the under side of the\r\nleaves we shall often see patches of its crimson eggs. Later the\r\ncaterpillars use the plant as their main, if not exclusive, food\r\nstore. They are the innocent culprits which nine times out of ten\r\nmutilate the foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE PURPLE GERARDIA\r\n  (Gerardia purpurea)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright purplish pink, deep magenta, or pale to whitish,\r\nabout 1 in. long and broad, growing along the rigid, spreading\r\nbranches. Calyx 5-toothed; corolla funnel-form, the tube much\r\ninflated above and spreading into 5 unequal, rounded lobes,\r\nspotted within, or sometimes downy; 4 stamens in pairs, the\r\nfilaments hairy; 1 pistil. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high, slender,\r\nbranches erect or spreading. Leaves: Opposite, very narrow, 1 to\r\n1 1/2 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low fields and meadows; moist, sandy soil.\r\nFlowering Season - August-October.\r\nDistribution - Northern United States to Florida, chiefly along\r\nAtlantic coast.\r\n\r\nLow-lying meadows gay with gerardias were never seen by that\r\nquaint old botanist and surgeon, John Gerarde, author of the\r\nfamous \"Herball or General Historie of Plants,\" a folio of nearly\r\nfourteen hundred pages, published in London toward the close of\r\nQueen Elizabeth's reign. He died without knowing how much he was\r\nto be honored by Linnaeus in giving his name to this charming\r\nAmerican genus.\r\n\r\nLarge patches of the lavender-pink gerardia, peeping above the\r\ngrass, make the wayfarer pause to feast his eyes, while the\r\npractical bee, meanwhile, takes a more substantial meal within\r\nthe spreading funnels. It is his practice to hang upside down\r\nwhile sucking, using the hairs on the filaments as footholds.\r\nNaturally he receives the pollen on his underside - just where it\r\nwill be rubbed off against the stigma impeding his entrance to\r\nthe next funnel visited. Any of the very dry pollen that may have\r\nfallen on the hairy filaments drops upon him.\r\n\r\n    \"And 'tis my faith that every flower\r\n     Enjoys the air it breathes,\"\r\n\r\nchanted Wordsworth. It is a special pity to gather the gerardias,\r\nwhich, as they grow, seem to enjoy life to the full, and when\r\npicked, to be so miserable they turn black as they dry. Like\r\ntheir relatives the foxgloves, they are difficult to transplant,\r\nbecause it is said they are more or less parasitic, fastening\r\ntheir roots on those of other plants. When robbery becomes\r\nflagrant, Nature brands sinners in the vegetable kingdom by\r\ntaking away their color, and perhaps their leaves, as in the case\r\nof the broom-rape and Indian pipe; but the fair faces of the\r\ngerardias and foxgloves give no hint of the petty thefts\r\ncommitted under cover of darkness in the soil below.\r\n\r\nThe SMALL-FLOWERED GERARDIA (G. Paupercula) so like the preceding\r\nspecies it was once thought to be a mere variety, ranges westward\r\nas far as Wisconsin, especially about the Great Lakes. But it is\r\na lower plant, with more erect branches, smaller flowers, quite\r\nwoolly within, and with a decided preference for bogs as well as\r\nlow meadows.\r\n\r\nIn salt marshes along the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nfrom Maine to Louisiana, the SEA-SIDE GERARDIA (G. maritima)\r\nflowers in midsummer, or a few weeks ahead of the autumnal,\r\nupland species. The plant, which rarely exceeds a foot in height,\r\nis sometimes only four inches above ground; and although at the\r\nNorth the paler magenta blossoms are only about half the length\r\nof the purple gerardias, in the South they are sometimes quite as\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nIn dry woods and thickets, on banks and hills from Quebec to\r\nGeorgia, and westward to the Mississippi we find the SLENDER\r\nGERARDIA (G. tenuifolia), its pale magenta, spotted, compressed\r\ncorolla about half an inch long; its very slender, low stem set\r\nwith exceedingly narrow leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIN-FLOWER; GROUND VINE\r\n  (Linnaea borealis)  Honeysuckle family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Delicate pink or white tinged with rose, bell-shaped,\r\nabout 1/2 in. long, fragrant, nodding in pairs on slender, curved\r\npedicels from an erect peduncle, 2-bracted where they join. Calyx\r\n5-toothed, sticky; corolla 5-lobed, bell-shaped, hairy within; 4\r\nstamens in pairs inserted near base of tube; 1 pistil. Stem:\r\nTrailing, 6 in. to 2 ft. long; the branches erect. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, rounded, petioled, evergreen.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Deep, cool, mossy woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Northern parts of America, Europe, and Asia. In\r\nthe United States southward as far as the mountains of Maryland,\r\nand the Sierra Nevadas in California.\r\n\r\nWith the consent of modest Linnaeus himself, Dr. Gronovius\r\nselected this typical woodland blossom to transmit the great\r\nmaster's flame to posterity -\r\n\r\n    \"Monument of the man of flowers.\"\r\n\r\nBut small and shy as it is, does Nature's garden contain a\r\nlovelier sight than scores of these deliciously fragrant pink\r\nbells swaying above a carpet of the little evergreen leaves in\r\nthe dim aisle of some deep, cool, lonely forest? Trailing over\r\nprostrate logs and mossy rocks, racing with the partridge vine\r\namong the ferns and dwarf cornels, the plant sends up \"twin-born\r\nheads\" that seem more fair and sweet than the most showy pampered\r\ndarlings of the millionaire's conservatory. Little wonder that\r\nLinnaeus loved these little twin sisters, or that Emerson\r\nenshrined them in his verse.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular impression, this vine, that suggests the dim\r\nold forest and exhales the very breath of the spring woods, will\r\nconsent to run about our rock gardens, although it seems almost a\r\nsacrilege to move it from natural surroundings so impressively\r\nbeautiful. Unlike the arbutus, which remains ever a wildling,\r\npining slowly to death on close contact with civilization, the\r\ntwin-flower thrives in light, moist garden soil where the sun\r\npeeps for a little while only in the morning. By nodding its head\r\nthe flower protects its precious contents from rain, the hairs\r\ninside exclude small pilferers; but bees, attracted by the\r\nfragrance and color, are guided to the nectary by five dark lines\r\nand a patch of orange color near it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOE-PYE WEED; TRUMPET WEED; PURPLE THOROUGHWORT; GRAVEL or\r\nKIDNEY-ROOT; TALL or PURPLE BONESET\r\n  (Eupatorium purpureum)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Pale or dull magenta or lavender pink, slightly\r\nfragrant, of tubular florets only, very numerous, in large,\r\nterminal, loose, compound clusters, generally elongated. Several\r\nseries of pink overlapping bracts form the oblong involucre from\r\nwhich the tubular floret and its protruding fringe of\r\nstyle-branches arise. Stem: 3 to 10 ft. high, green or purplish,\r\nleafy, usually branching toward top. Leaves: In whorls of 3 to 6\r\n(usually 4), oval to lance-shaped, saw-edged, petioled, thin,\r\nrough.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, meadows, woods, low ground.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to\r\nManitoba and Texas.\r\n\r\nTowering above the surrounding vegetation of low-lying meadows,\r\nthis vigorous composite spreads clusters of soft, fringy bloom\r\nthat, however deep or pale of tint, are ever conspicuous\r\nadvertisements, even when the goldenrods, sunflowers, and asters\r\nenter into close competition for insect trade. Slight fragrance,\r\nwhich to the delicate perception of butterflies is doubtless\r\nheavy enough, the florets' color and slender tubular form\r\nindicate an adaptation to them, and they are by far the most\r\nabundant visitors, which is not to say that long-tongued bees and\r\nflies never reach the nectar and transfer pollen, for they do.\r\nBut an excellent place for the butterfly collector to carry his\r\nnet is to a patch of Joe-Pye weed in September. As the spreading\r\nstyle-branches that fringe each tiny floret are furnished with\r\nhairs for three-quarters of their length, the pollen caught in\r\nthem comes in contact with the alighting visitor. Later, the\r\nlower portion of the style-branches, that is covered with\r\nstigmatic papillae along the edge, emerges from the tube to\r\nreceive pollen carried from younger flowers when the visitor sips\r\nhis reward. If the hairs still contain pollen when the stigmatic\r\npart of the style is exposed, insects self-fertilize the flower;\r\nand if in stormy, weather no insects are flying, the flower is\r\nnevertheless able to fertilize itself, because the hairy fringe\r\nmust often come in contact with the stigmas of neighboring\r\nflorets. It is only when we study flowers with reference to their\r\nmotives and methods that we understand why one is abundant and\r\nanother rare. Composites long ago utilized many principles of\r\nsuccess in life that the triumphant Anglo-Saxon carries into\r\nlarger affairs today.\r\n\r\nJoe-Pye, an Indian medicine-man of New England, earned fame and\r\nfortune by curing typhus fever and other horrors with decoctions\r\nmade from this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON BURDOCK; COCKLE-BUR; BEGGARS BUTTONS; CLOT-BUR; CUCKOO\r\nBUTTON\r\n  (Arctium minus; Lappa officinalis: var. minor of Gray)  Thistle\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Composite of tubular florets only, about 1/2 in.\r\nbroad; magenta varying to purplish or white; the prominent round\r\ninvolucre of many overlapping leathery bracts, tipped with hooked\r\nbristles. Stem: 2 to 5 ft. high, simple or branching, coarse.\r\nLeaves: Large, the lower ones often 1 ft. long, broadly ovate,\r\nentire edged, pale or loosely cottony beneath, on hollow\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste ground, waysides, fields, barnyards.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Common throughout our area. Naturalized from\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nA larger burdock than this (A. Lappa) may be more common in a few\r\nlocalities of the East, but wherever one wanders, this plebeian\r\nboldly asserts itself. In close-cropped pastures it still\r\nflourishes with the well-armed thistles and mulleins, for the\r\ngreat leaves contain an exceedingly bitter, sour juice,\r\ndistasteful to grazers. Nevertheless the unpaid cattle, like\r\nevery other beast and man, must nolens volens transplant the burs\r\nfar away from the parent plant to found new colonies. Literally\r\nby hook or by crook they steal a ride on every switching tail,\r\nevery hairy dog and woolly sheep, every trouser-leg or petticoat.\r\nEven the children, who make dolls and baskets of burdock burs,\r\naid them in their insatiate love of travel. Wherever man goes,\r\nthey follow, until, having crossed Europe - with the Romans? -\r\nthey are now at home throughout this continent. Their vitality is\r\namazing; persecution with scythe and plow may retard, but never\r\ncheck their victorious march. Opportunity for a seed to germinate\r\nmay not come until late in the summer; but at once the plant sets\r\nto work putting forth flowers and maturing seed, losing no time\r\nin developing superfluous stalk and branches. Butterflies, which,\r\nlike the Hoboken Dutch, ever delight in magenta, and bees of\r\nvarious kinds, find these flowers, with a slight fragrance as an\r\nadditional attraction, generous entertainers.\r\n\r\nPink, of all colors, is the most unstable in our flora, and the\r\nmost likely to fade. Magentas incline to purple, on the one hand,\r\nor to pure pink on the other, and delicate shades quickly blanch\r\nwhen long exposed to the sun's rays. Thus we frequently find\r\nwhite blossoms of the once pink rhododendron, laurel, azalea,\r\nbouncing Bet, and turtle-head. Albinos, too, regularly occur in\r\nnumerous species. Many colored flowers show a tendency among\r\nindividuals to revert to the white type of their ancestors. The\r\nreader should bear these facts in mind, and search for his\r\nunidentified flower in the previous section or in the following\r\none if this group does not contain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE AND GREENISH FLOWERS\r\n\r\n\"The transition from wind-fertilization to insect-fertilization\r\nand the first traces of adaptation to insects, could only be due\r\nto the influence of quite short-lipped insects with feebly\r\ndeveloped color sense. The most primitive flowers are therefore\r\nfor the most part simple, widely open, regular, devoid of nectar\r\nor with their nectar unconcealed and easily accessible, and\r\ngreenish, white, or yellow in color.... Lepidoptera, by the\r\nthinness, sometimes by the length, of their tongues, were able to\r\nproduce special modifications. Through their agency were\r\ndeveloped flowers with long and narrow tubes, whose colors and\r\ntime of opening were in relation to the tastes and habits of\r\ntheir visitors.\" - Hermann Muller.\r\n\r\n\"Of all colors, white is the prevailing one; and of white flowers\r\na considerably larger proportion smell sweetly than of any other\r\ncolor, namely, 14.6 per cent; of red only 8.2 per cent are\r\nodoriferous. The fact of a large proportion of white flowers\r\nsmelling sweetly may depend in part on those which are fertilized\r\nby moths requiring the double aid of conspicuousness in the dusk\r\nand of odor. So great is the economy of Nature, that most flowers\r\nwhich are fertilized by crepuscular or nocturnal insects emit\r\ntheir odor chiefly or exclusively in the evening.\" - Charles\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER-PLANTAIN\r\n  (Alisma Plantago-aquatica)  Water-plantain family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small and numerous, white, or pale pink, whorled\r\nin bracted clusters forming a large, loose panicle 6 to 15 in.\r\nlong on a usually solitary scape 1/2 to 3 ft. high. Calyx of 3\r\nsepals corolla of 3 deciduous petals; 6 or more stamens; many\r\ncarpels in a ring on a small flat receptacle. Leaves: Erect or\r\nfloating, oblong or ovate, with several ribs, or lance-shaped or\r\ngrass-like, petioled, all from root.\r\nPerferred Habitat - Shallow water, mud, marshes.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - North America, Europe, Asia.\r\n\r\nUnlike its far more showy, decorative cousin the arrow-head, this\r\nwee-blossomed plant, whose misty white panicles rise with\r\ncompensating generosity the world around, bears only perfect,\r\nregular flowers. Twelve infinitesimal drops of nectar, secreted\r\nin a fleshy ring around the center, are eagerly sought by flies.\r\nAs the anthers point obliquely outward and away from the stigmas,\r\nan incoming fly, bearing pollen on his under side, usually\r\nalights in the center, and leaves some of the vitalizing dust\r\njust where it is most needed. But a \"fly starting from a petal,\"\r\nsays Muller, \"usually applies its tongue to the nectar-drops one\r\nby one, and after each it strokes an anther with its labellae; in\r\nso doing it may bring various parts of its body in contact with\r\nthe anthers. As a rule, however, the parts which come in contact\r\nwith the anthers are not those which come in contact with the\r\nstigmas in the same flower.\" Any plant that lives in shallow\r\nwater, which may dry up as summer advances, is under special\r\nnecessity to produce an extra quantity of cross-fertilized seed\r\nto guard against extinction during drought. For the same reason\r\nit bears several kinds of leaves adapted to its environment:\r\nbroad ones that spread their surfaces to the sunshine, and long\r\ngrass-like ones to glide through currents of water that would\r\ntear those of any other shape. What diversity of leaf-form and\r\nstructure we meet daily, and yet how very little does the wisest\r\nman of science understand of the reasons underlying such\r\nmarvellous adaptability!\r\n\r\n\r\nBROAD-LEAVED ARROWHEAD\r\n  (Sagittaria latifolia; S. variabilis of Gray)  Water-plantain\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, 1 to 1 1/2 in. wide, in 3-bracted whorls of 3,\r\nborne near the summit of a leafless scape 4 in. to 4 ft. tall.\r\nCalyx of 3 sepals corolla of 3 rounded, spreading petals. Stamens\r\nand pistils numerous, the former yellow in upper flowers usually\r\nabsent or imperfect in lower pistillate flowers. Leaves:\r\nExceedingly variable; those under water usually long and\r\ngrasslike; upper ones sharply arrow-shaped or blunt and broad,\r\nspongy or leathery, on long petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Shallow water and mud.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - From Mexico northward throughout our area to the\r\ncircumpolar regions.\r\n\r\nWading into shallow water or standing on some muddy shore, like a\r\nheron, this striking plant, so often found in that bird's haunts,\r\nis quite as decorative in a picture, and, happily, far more\r\napproachable in life. Indeed, one of the comforts of botany as\r\ncompared with bird study is that we may get close enough to the\r\nflowers to observe their last detail, whereas the bird we have\r\nfollowed laboriously over hill and dale, through briers and\r\nswamps, darts away beyond the range of field-glasses with\r\ntantalizing swiftness.\r\n\r\nWhile no single plant is yet thoroughly known to scientists, in\r\nspite of the years of study devoted by specialists to separate\r\ngroups, no plant remains wholly meaningless. When Keppler\r\ndiscovered the majestic order of movement of the heavenly bodies,\r\nhe exclaimed, \"Oh God, I think Thy thoughts after Thee!\" - the\r\nexpression of a discipleship every reverent soul must be\r\nconscious of in penetrating, be it ever so little a way, into the\r\ninner meaning of the humblest wayside weed.\r\n\r\nFragile, delicate, pure white, golden-centered flowers of the\r\narrowhead, usually clustered about the top of the scape,\r\nnaturally are the first to attract the attention whether of man\r\nor insect. Below these, dull green, unattractive collections of\r\npistils, which by courtesy only may be called flowers, also form\r\nlittle groups of three. Like the Quakers at meeting, the male and\r\nfemale arrowhead flowers are separated, often on distinct plants.\r\nOf course the insect visitors - bees and flies chiefly - alight\r\non the showy staminate blossoms first, and transfer pollen from\r\nthem to the dull pistillate ones later, as it was intended they\r\nshould, to prevent self-fertilization. How endless are the\r\ndevices of the flowers to guard against this evil and to compel\r\ninsects to cross-pollinate them! The most minute detail of the\r\nmechanism involved, which the microscope reveals, only increases\r\nour interest and wonder.\r\n\r\nAny plant which elects to grow in shallow water must be\r\namphibious; it must be able to breathe beneath the surface as the\r\nfish do, and also be adapted to thrive without those parts that\r\ncorrespond to gills; for ponds and streams have an unpleasant way\r\nof drying up in summer, leaving it stranded on the shore. This\r\naccounts in part for the variable leaves on the arrowhead, those\r\nunderneath the water being long and ribbon-like, to bring the\r\ngreatest possible area into contact with the air with which the\r\nwater is charged. Broad leaves would be torn to shreds by the\r\ncurrent through which grass-like blades glide harmlessly; but\r\nwhen this plant grows on shore, having no longer use for its\r\nlower ribbons, it loses them, and expands only broad arrow-shaped\r\nsurfaces to the sunny air, leaves to be supplied with carbonic\r\nacid to assimilate, and sunshine to turn off the oxygen and store\r\nup the carbon into their system.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER ARUM; MARSH CALLA\r\n  (Calla palustris)  Arum family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Minute, greenish yellow, clustered on a cylinder-like,\r\nfleshy spadix about 1 in. long, partly enfolded by a large,\r\nwhite, oval, pointed, erect spathe, the whole resembling a small\r\ncalla lily open in front. The solitary \"flower\" on a scape as\r\nlong as the petioles of leaves, and, like them, sheathed at base.\r\nLeaves: Thick, somewhat heart-shaped, their spreading or erect\r\npetioles 4 to 8 in. long. Fruit: Red berries clustered in a head.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool Northern bogs; in or beside sluggish\r\nwater.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia southward to Virginia, westward to\r\nMinnesota and Iowa.\r\n\r\nAt a glance one knows this beautiful denizen of Northern bogs and\r\nditches to be a poor relation of the stately Ethiopian calla lily\r\nof our greenhouses. Where the arum grows in rich, cool retreats,\r\nit is apt to be abundant, its slender rootstocks running hither\r\nand thither through the yielding soil with thrifty rapidity until\r\nthe place is carpeted with its handsome dark leaves, from which\r\nthe pure white \"flowers\" arise; and yet many flower lovers well\r\nup in field practice know it not. Thoreau, for example, was no\r\nlonger young when he first saw, or, rather, noticed it. \"Having\r\nfound this in one place,\" he wrote, \"I now find it in another.\r\nMany an object is not seen, though it falls within the range of\r\nour visual ray, because it does not come within the range of our\r\nintellectual ray. So, in the largest sense, we find only the\r\nworld we look for.\"\r\n\r\nNow, the true flowers of the arum and all its spadix-bearing kin\r\nare so minute that one scarcely notices them where they are\r\nclustered on the club-shaped column in the center of the apparent\r\n\"flower.\" The beautiful white banner of the marsh calla, or the\r\ngreen and maroon striped pulpit from which Jack preaches, is no\r\nmore the flower proper than the papery sheath below the daffodil\r\nis the daffodil. In the arum the white advertisement flaunted\r\nbefore flying insects is not even essential to the florets'\r\nexistence, except as it helps them attract their pollen-carrying\r\nfriends. Almost all waterside plants, it will be noticed, depend\r\nchiefly upon flies and midges, and these lack aesthetic taste.\r\n\"Such plants have usually acquired small and inconspicuous\r\nseparate flowers,\" says Grant Allen; \"and then, to make up for\r\ntheir loss in attractiveness, like cheap sweetmeats, they have\r\nvery largely increased their numbers. Or, to put the matter more\r\nsimply and physically, in waterside situations those plants\r\nsucceed best which have a relatively large number of individually\r\nsmall and unnoticeable flowers massed together into large and\r\nclosely serried bundles. Hence, in such situations, there is a\r\ntendency for petals to be suppressed, and for blossoms to grow\r\nminute; because the large and bright flowers seldom succeed in\r\nattracting big land insects like bees or butterflies, while the\r\nsmall and thick-set ones usually do succeed in attracting a great\r\nmany little flitting midges.\" Flies, which are guided far more by\r\ntheir sense of smell than by sight, resort to the petalless,\r\ninsignificant florets of the ill-scented marsh calla in numbers;\r\nand as the uppermost clusters are staminate only, while the lower\r\nflorets contain stamens and pistil, it follows they must often\r\neffect cross-pollination as they crawl over the spadix. But here\r\nis no trap to catch the tiny benefactors such as is set by wicked\r\nJack-in-the-pulpit, or the skunk-cabbage, or another cousin, a\r\nstill more terrible executioner, the cuckoo-pint (Arum maculatum)\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nFew coroner's inquests are held over the dead bodies of our\r\nfeathered friends; and it is not known whether the\r\ninnocent-looking marsh calla really poisons the birds on which it\r\ndepends to carry its bright seeds afar or not. The cuckoo-pint,\r\nas is well known, destroys the winged messenger bearing its\r\noffspring to plant fresh colonies in a distant bog, because the\r\ndecayed body of the bird acts as the best possible fertilizer\r\ninto which the seedling may strike its roots. Most of our noxious\r\nweeds, like our vermin, have come to us from Europe; but Heaven\r\ndeliver us from this cannibalistic pest!\r\n\r\nThe very common GREEN ARROW-ARUM (Peltandra Virginica), found in\r\nshallow water, ditches, swamps, and the muddy shores of ponds\r\nthroughout the eastern half of the United States, attracts us\r\nmore by its stately growth and the beauty of its bright, lustrous\r\ngreen arrow-shaped leaves (which have been found thirty inches\r\nlong), than by the insignificant florets clustered on the spadix\r\nwithin a long pointed green sheath that closely enfolds it.\r\nPistillate florets cover it for only about one-fourth its length.\r\nTo them flies carry pollen from the staminate florets covering\r\nthe rest of the spadix. After the club is set with green berries\r\n- green, for this plant has no need to attract birds with bright\r\nred ones - the flower stalk curves, bends downward, and the\r\npointed leathery sheath acting as an auger, it bores a hole into\r\nthe soft mud in which the seeds germinate with the help of their\r\nsurrounding jelly as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN WHITE HELLEBORE; INDIAN POKE; ITCH-WEED\r\n  (Veratrum viride)  Bunch-flower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dingy, pale yellowish or whitish green, growing greener\r\nwith age, 1 in. or less across, very numerous, in\r\nstiff-branching, spike-like, dense-flowered panicles. Perianth of\r\n6 oblong segments; 6 short curved stamens; 3 styles. Stem: Stout,\r\nleafy, 2 to 8 ft. tall. Leaves: Plaited, lower ones broadly oval,\r\npointed, 6 to 12 in. long; parallel ribbed, sheathing the stem\r\nwhere they clasp it; upper leaves gradually narrowing; those\r\namong flowers small.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, wet woods, low meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - British Possessions from ocean to ocean; southward\r\nin the United States to Georgia, Tennessee, and Minnesota.\r\n\r\n    \"Borage and hellebore fill two scenes -\r\n     Sovereign plants to purge the veins\r\n     Of melancholy, and cheer the heart\r\n     Of those black fumes which make it smart.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the antidotes for madness prescribed by Burton in his\r\n\"Anatomie of Melancholy.\" But like most medicines, so the\r\nhomeopaths have taught us, the plant that heals may also poison;\r\nand the coarse, thick rootstock of this hellebore sometimes does\r\ndeadly work. The shining plaited leaves, put forth so early in\r\nthe spring they are especially tempting to grazing cattle on that\r\naccount, are too well known by most animals, however, to be\r\ntouched by them - precisely the end desired, of course, by the\r\nhellebore, nightshade, aconite, cyclamen, Jamestown weed, and a\r\nhost of others that resort, for protection, to the low trick of\r\nmixing poisonous chemicals with their cellular juices. Pliny told\r\nhow the horses, oxen, and swine of his day were killed by eating\r\nthe foliage of the black hellebore. Flies, which visit the dirty,\r\nyellowish-green flowers in abundance, must cross-fertilize them,\r\nas the anthers mature before the stigmas are ready to receive\r\npollen. Apparently the visitors suffer no ill effects from the\r\nnectar. We nave just seen how the green arrow-arum bores a hole\r\nin the mud and plants its own seeds in autumn. The hellebore uses\r\nits auger in the spring, when we find the stout, shining, solid\r\ntool above ground with the early skunk-cabbage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR OF BETHLEHEM; TEN O'CLOCK\r\n (Ornithogalum umbellatum)  Lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Opening in the sunshine, white within, greenish on the\r\noutside, veined, borne on slender pedicels in an erect, loose\r\ncluster. Perianth of 6 narrowly oblong divisions, 1/2 in. long or\r\nover, or about twice as long as the flattened stamens; style\r\nshort, 3-sided. Scape: Slender, 4 to 12 in. high, with narrow,\r\nblade-like bracts above. Leaves: Narrow, grass-like with white\r\nmidvein, fleshy, all from coated, egg-shaped bulb.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, grassy meadows, old lawns. Flowering\r\nSeason - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Escaped from gardens from Massachusetts to\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe finding of these exquisite little flowers, growing wild among\r\nthe lush grass of a meadow not far from some old homestead where\r\ntheir ancestors, with crocuses and grape hyacinths, once\r\nbrightened the lawn in early spring, makes one long to start a\r\nParkinson Society instantly. Some school children not far from\r\nNew York, receiving their inspiration from Mrs. Ewing's little\r\nbook, \"Mary's Meadow,\" have spread the gospel of beauty, like the\r\ntrue missionaries they are, by systematically planting in lanes\r\nand fields sweet violets, golden coreopsis, hardy poppies, blue\r\ncorn-flowers, Japanese roses, orange day-lilies, larkspurs, and\r\nmany other charming garden flowers that need only the slightest\r\nencouragement to run wild. Immense quantities of seed, that go to\r\nloss in every garden, might so easily be sprinkled at large on\r\nour walks. Nearly all the beautiful hardy perennials cultivated\r\nhere grow in Nature's garden in Europe or Asia, and will do so in\r\nAmerica if they are but given the chance. The Star of Bethlehem\r\nis a case in point. Several members of the large group of\r\ncharming spring flowers to which it belongs grow in such\r\nabundance in the Old World that for centuries the bulbs have\r\nfurnished food to the omnivorous Italian and Asiatic peasants. If\r\nwe cannot spare offsets from the garden, and will wait a few\r\nyears for seeds to bear, the rich, light loam of our grassy\r\nmeadows, too, will be streaked with a Milky Way of floral stars,\r\nas they are in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Greek generic name of the Star of Bethlehem, meaning \"bird's\r\nmilk\" (a popular folk expression in Europe for some marvellous\r\nthing) was applied by Linnaeus because of the flower's likeness\r\nto the wonderful star in the East which guided the Wise Men to\r\nthe manger where Jesus lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR-GRASS; COLIC-ROOT\r\n  (Aletris farinosa)  Lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, oblong-tubular, pure white or yellowish, about\r\n1/4 in. long, set obliquely in a long, wand-like, spiked raceme,\r\nat the end of a slender scape 2 to 3 ft. tall. Perianth somewhat\r\nbell-shaped, 6-pointed, rough or mealy outside; 6 stamens,\r\ninserted below each point; style 3-cleft at tip. (A Southern form\r\nor distinct species (?) has yellower, fragrant flowers.) Leaves:\r\n>From the base, lance-shaped, 2 to 6 in. long, thin, pale\r\nyellowish green, in a spreading cluster.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil; roadsides; open, grassy, sandy\r\nwoods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - From Ontario and the Mississippi eastward to the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nHerb gatherers have searched far and wide for this plant's\r\nbitter, fibrous root, because of its supposed medicinal virtues.\r\nWhat decoctions have not men swallowed from babyhood to old age\r\nto get relief from griping colic! In partial shade, colonies of\r\nthe tufted yellow-green leaves send up from the center gradually\r\nlengthening spikes of bloom that may finally attain over a foot\r\nin length. The plant is not unknown in borders of men's gardens.\r\nThe Greek word (aletron = meal) from which its generic title is\r\nderived, refers to the rough, granular surface of the little\r\noblong white flower.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD SPIKENARD; FALSE SOLOMON'S SEAL; SOLOMON'S ZIG-ZAG\r\n  (Vagnera racemosa; Smilacina racemosa of Gray)\r\nLily-of-the-Valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or greenish, small, slightly fragrant, in a\r\ndensely flowered terminal raceme. Perianth of 6 separate,\r\nspreading segments; 6 stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: Simple, somewhat\r\nangled, 1 to 3 ft. high, scaly below, leafy, and sometimes finely\r\nhairy above. Leaves: Alternate and seated along stem, oblong,\r\nlance-shaped, 3 to 6 in. long, finely hairy beneath. Rootstock:\r\nThick, fleshy. Fruit: A cluster of aromatic, round, pale red\r\nspeckled berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods, thickets, hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia; westward to Arizona and\r\nBritish Columbia.\r\n\r\nAs if to offer opportunities for comparison to the confused\r\nnovice, the true Solomon's seal and the so-called false species -\r\nquite as honest a plant - usually grow near each other. Grace of\r\nline, rather than beauty of blossom, gives them both their chief\r\ncharm. But the feathery plume of greenish-white blossoms that\r\ncrowns the false Solomon's seal's somewhat zig-zagged stem is\r\nvery different from the small, greenish, bell-shaped flowers,\r\nusually nodding in pairs along the stem, under the leaves, from\r\nthe axils of the true Solomon's seal. Later in summer, when\r\nhungry birds wander through the woods with increased families,\r\nthe wild spikenard offers them branching clusters of pale red\r\nspeckled berries, whereas the latter plant feasts them with\r\nblue-black fruit, in the hope that they will drop the seeds miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBy clustering its small, slightly fragrant flowers at the end of\r\nits stem, the wild spikenard offers a more taking advertisement\r\nto its insect friends than its cousin can show. A few flies and\r\nbeetles visit them; but apparently the less specialized bees,\r\nchiefly those of the Halictus tribe, which predominate in May,\r\nare the principal guests. These alight in the center of the\r\nwidely expanded blossoms set on the upper side of the branching\r\nraceme so as to make their nectar and pollen easily accessible;\r\nand as the newly opened flower has its stigma already receptive\r\nto pollen brought to it while its own anthers are closed, it\r\nfollows the plant is dependent upon the bees' help, as well as\r\nthe birds', to perpetuate itself.\r\n\r\nThe STAR-FLOWERED SOLOMON'S SEAL (V. stellata), found from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific, from Newfoundland as far south as\r\nKansas, has larger, but fewer, flowers than the wild spikenard,\r\nat the end of its erect, low-growing stem. Where the two species\r\ngrow together - and they often do - it will be noticed that the\r\nstar-flowered one frequently forms colonies on rich, moist banks,\r\nits leaves partly clasp the stem, and its berries, which may be\r\nentirely black, are more frequently green, with six black\r\nstripes.\r\n\r\nThe TWO-LEAVED SOLOMON'S SEAL, or FALSE LILY-OF-THE-VALLEY\r\n(Unifolium Canadense), very common in moist woods and thickets\r\nNorth and West, is a curious little plant, sometimes with only a\r\nsolitary, long-petioled leaf; but where many of these sterile\r\nplants grow together, forming shining beds. Other individuals\r\nlift a white-flowered raceme six inches above the ground; and on\r\nthe slender, often zig-zagged flowering stem there may be one to\r\nthree, but usually two, ovate leaves, pointed at the apex,\r\nheart-shaped at the base, either seated on it, one above the\r\nother, or standing out from it on distinct but short petioles.\r\nThis flower has only four segments and four stamens. Like the\r\nwild spikenard, the little plant bears clusters of pale red\r\nspeckled berries in autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRY or TRUE or TWIN-FLOWERED SOLOMON'S SEAL\r\n  (Polygonatum biftorum)  Lily-of-the-Valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Whitish or yellowish green, tubular, bell-shaped, 1 to\r\n4, but usually 2, drooping on slender peduncles from leaf axils.\r\nPerianth 6-lobed at entrance, but not spreading; 6 stamens, the\r\nfilaments roughened; 1 pistil. Stem: Simple, slender, arching,\r\nleafy, 8 in. to 3 ft. long. Leaves: Oval, pointed, or\r\nlance-shaped, alternate, 2 to 4 in. long, seated on stem, pale\r\nbeneath and softly hairy along veins. Rootstock: Thick,\r\nhorizontal, jointed, scarred. (Polygonatum = many joints). Fruit:\r\nA blue-black berry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods, thickets, shady banks.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Florida, westward to Michigan.\r\n\r\n>From a many-jointed, thick rootstock a single graceful curved\r\nstem arises each spring, withers after fruiting, and leaves a\r\nround scar, whose outlines suggested to the fanciful man who\r\nnamed the genus the seal of Israel's wise king. Thus one may know\r\nthe age of a root by its seals, as one tells that of a tree by\r\nthe rings in its trunk.\r\n\r\nThe dingy little cylindric flowers, hidden beneath the leaves,\r\nmay be either self-pollenized or cross-pollenized by the\r\nbumblebees to which they are adapted. \"We may suppose,\" says\r\nProfessor Robertson, \"that the pendulous position of the flowers\r\nowes its origin to the fact that it renders them less convenient\r\nto other insects, but equally convenient to the higher bees which\r\nare the most efficient pollinators; and that the resulting\r\nprotection to pollen and nectar is merely an incidental effect.\"\r\nCertain Lepidoptera, and small insects which crawl into the\r\ncylinder, visit all the Solomon's seals.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH SOLOMON'S SEAL (P. commutatum; P.giganteum of Gray),\r\nwith much the same range as its smaller relative, grows in moist\r\nwoods and along shaded streams. It is a variable, capricious\r\nplant, with a stout or slender stem, perhaps only one foot high,\r\nor again towering above the tallest man's head; the oval leaves\r\nalso vary greatly in breadth and length; and a solitary flower\r\nmay droop from an axil, or perhaps eight dingy greenish cylinders\r\nmay hang in a cluster. But the plant is always smooth throughout.\r\nEven the incurved filaments which obstruct the entrance to this\r\nflower are smooth where those of the preceding species are\r\nrough-hairy. The style is so short that it may never come in\r\ncontact with the anthers, although the winged visitors must often\r\nleave pollen of the same flower on the stigma.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY or DWARF WAKE-ROBIN\r\n  (Trillium nivale)  Lily-of-the-Valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Solitary, pure white, about 1 in. long, on an erect or\r\ncurved peduncle, from a whorl of 3 leaves at summit of stem.\r\nThree spreading, green, narrowly oblong sepals; 3 oval or oblong\r\npetals; 6 stamens, the anthers about as long as filaments; 3\r\nslender styles stigmatic along inner side. Stem: 2 to 6 in. high,\r\nfrom a short, tuber-like rootstock. Leaves: 3 in a whorl below\r\nthe flower, 1 to 2 in. long, broadly oval, rounded at end, on\r\nshort petioles. Fruit: A 3-lobed reddish berry, about 1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter, the sepals adhering.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania, westward to Minnesota and Iowa,\r\nsouth to Kentucky.\r\n\r\nOnly this delicate little flower, as white as the snow it\r\nsometimes must push through to reach the sunshine melting the\r\nlast drifts in the leafless woods, can be said to wake the robins\r\ninto song; a full chorus of feathered love-makers greets the\r\nappearance of the more widely distributed, and therefore better\r\nknown, species.\r\n\r\nBy the rule of three all the trilliums, as their name implies,\r\nregulate their affairs. Three sepals, three petals, twice three\r\nstamens, three styles, a three-celled ovary, the flower growing\r\nout from a whorl of three leaves, make the naming of wake-robins\r\na simple matter to the novice. Rarely do the parts divide into\r\nfours, or the petals and sepals revert to primitive green leaves.\r\nWith the exception of the painted trillium which sometimes grows\r\nin bogs, all the clan live in rich, moist woods. It is said the\r\nroots are poisonous. In them the next year's leaves lie curled\r\nthrough the winter, as in the iris and Solomon's seal, among\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most chastely beautiful of our native wild flowers -\r\nso lovely that many shady nooks in English rock-gardens and\r\nferneries contain imported clumps of the vigorous plant - is the\r\nLARGE-FLOWERED WAKE-ROBIN, or WHITE WOOD LILY (T. grandiflorum).\r\nUnder favorable conditions the waxy, thin, white, or occasionally\r\npink, strongly veined petals may exceed two inches; and in\r\nMichigan a monstrous form has been found. The broadly rhombic\r\nleaves, tapering to a point, and lacking petioles, are seated in\r\nthe usual whorl of three, at the summit of the stem, which may\r\nattain a foot and a half in height; from the center the\r\ndecorative flower arises on a long peduncle. At first the\r\nentrance to the blossom is closed by the long anthers which much\r\nexceed the filaments; and hive-bees, among other insects, in\r\ncollecting pollen, transfer it to older and now expanded flowers,\r\nin which the low stigmas appear between the tall separated\r\nstamens. Nectar stored in septal glands at the base invites the\r\nvisitor laden with pollen from young flowers to come in contact\r\nwith the three late maturing stigmas. The berry is black. From\r\nQuebec to Florida and far westward we find this tardy wake-robin\r\nin May or June.\r\n\r\nCertainly the commonest trillium in the East, although it thrives\r\nas far westward as Ontario and Missouri, and south to Georgia, is\r\nthe NODDING WAKE-ROBIN (T. cernuum), whose white or pinkish\r\nflower droops from its peduncle until it is all but hidden under\r\nthe whorl of broadly rhombic, tapering leaves. The wavy margined\r\npetals, about as long as the sepals - that is to say, half an\r\ninch long or over - curve backward at maturity. According to Miss\r\nCarter, who studied the flower in the Botanical Garden at South\r\nHadley, Mass., it is slightly proterandrous, maturing its anthers\r\nfirst, but with a chance of spontaneous self-pollination by the\r\nstigmas recurving to meet the shorter stamens. She saw bumblebees\r\nvisiting it for nectar. In late summer an egg-shaped, pendulous\r\nred-purple berry swings from the summit. One finds the plant in\r\nbloom from April to June, according to the climate of its long\r\nrange,\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most strikingly beautiful member of the tribe is the\r\nPAINTED TRILLIUM (T. undulatum; T. erythrocarpum of Gray). At the\r\nsummit of the slender stem, rising perhaps only eight inches, or\r\nmaybe twice as high, this charming flower spreads its long,\r\nwavy-edged, waxy-white petals veined and striped with deep pink\r\nor wine color. The large ovate leaves, long-tapering to a point,\r\nare rounded at the base into short petioles. The rounded,\r\nthree-angled, bright red, shining berry is seated in the\r\npersistent calyx. With the same range as the nodding trillium's,\r\nthe painted wake-robin comes into bloom nearly a month later - in\r\nMay and June - when all the birds are not only wide awake, but\r\nhave finished courting, and are busily engaged in the most\r\nserious business of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWY LADY'S SLIPPER\r\n  (Cypripedium reginae; C. spectabile of Gray)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Usually solitary, at summit of stem, white, or the\r\ninflated white lip painted with purplish pink and white stripes;\r\nsepals rounded oval, spreading, white, not longer than the lip;\r\npetals narrower, white; the broad sac-shaped pouch open in front,\r\n1 in. long or over. Stem: Stout, leafy, 1 to 2 ft. high. Leaves:\r\n3 to 8 in. long, downy, elliptic, pointed, many ribbed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Peat-bogs; rich, low, wet woods.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, westward to the\r\nMississippi. Chiefly North.\r\n\r\nQuite different from the showy orchis, is this far more chaste\r\nshowy lady's slipper which Dr. Gray has called \"the most\r\nbeautiful of the genus.\" Because the plants live in inaccessible\r\nswampy places, where only the most zealous flower lover\r\npenetrates, they have a reputation for rarity at which one who\r\nknows a dozen places to find colonies of the stately exquisites\r\nduring a morning's walk, must smile with superiority. Wine\r\nappears to overflow the large white cup and trickle down its\r\nsides. Sometimes unstained, pure white chalices are found. C.\r\nalbum is the name by which the plant is known in England. See\r\nnote after Common Daisy.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE ROUND-LEAVED or GREATER GREEN ORCHIS\r\n  (Habenaria orbiculata) Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish white, in a loosely set spike; the upper sepal\r\nshort, rounded; side ones spreading; petals smaller, arching; the\r\nlip long, narrow, drooping, white, prolonged into a spur often 1\r\n1/2 in. long, curved and enlarged at base; anther sacs prominent,\r\nconverging. Scape: 1 to 2 ft. high. Leaves: 2, spreading flat on\r\nground, glossy above, silvery underneath, parallel-veined,\r\nslightly longer than wide, very large, from 4 to 7 in. across.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods in mountainous regions,\r\nespecially near evergreens.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - From British Columbia to the Atlantic; eastern\r\nhalf of the United States southward to the Carolinas.\r\n\r\nWonderfully interesting structure and the comparative rarity of\r\nthis orchid, rather than superficial beauty, are responsible for\r\nthe thrill of pleasure one experiences at the sight of the spike\r\nof unpretentious flowers. Two great leaves, sometimes as large as\r\ndinner plates, attract the eye to where they glisten on the\r\nground. The spur of the blossom, the nectary, \"implies a welcome\r\nto a tongue two inches long, and will reward none other,\" says\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson. \"This clearly shuts out the bees,\r\nbutterflies, and smaller moths. What insect, then, is here\r\nimplied? The sphinx moth, one of the lesser of the group. A\r\nlarger individual might sip the nectar, it is true, but its\r\nlonger tongue would reach the base of the tube without effecting\r\nthe slightest contact with the pollen, which is, of course, the\r\ndesideratum.\" How the moth, in sipping the nectar, thrusts his\r\nhead against the sticky buttons to which the pollen messes are\r\nattached, and, in trying to release himself, loosens them; how he\r\nflies off with these little clubs sticking to his eyes; how they\r\nautomatically adjust themselves to the attitude where they will\r\ncome in contact with the stigma of the next flower visited, and\r\nso cross-fertilize it, has been told in the account of the great\r\npurple-fringed orchis of similar construction. To that species\r\nthe interested reader is, therefore, referred; or, better still,\r\nto the luminous description by Dr. Asa Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE-FRINGED ORCHIS\r\n  (Habenaria blephariglottis)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pure white, fragrant, borne on a spike from 3 to 6 in.\r\nlong. Spur long, slender; oval sepals; smaller petals toothed;\r\nthe oblong lip deeply fringed. Stem: Slender, 1 to 2 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Lance-shaped, parallel-veined, clasping the stem; upper\r\nones smallest.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Peat-bogs and swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Northeastern United States and eastern Canada to\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nOne who selfishly imagines that all the floral beauty of the\r\nearth was created for man's sole delight will wonder why a flower\r\nso exquisitely beautiful as this dainty little orchid should be\r\nhidden in inaccessible peat-bogs, where overshoes and tempers get\r\nlost with deplorable frequency, and the water-snake and bittern\r\nmock at man's intrusion of their realm by the ease with which\r\nthey move away from him. Not for man, but for the bee, the moth,\r\nand the butterfly, are orchids where they are and what they are.\r\nThe white-fringed orchis grows in watery places that it may more\r\neasily manufacture nectar, and protect itself from crawling\r\npilferers; its flowers are clustered on a spike, their lips are\r\nfringed, they have been given fragrance and a snowy-white color\r\nthat they may effectually advertise their sweets on whose removal\r\nby an insect benefactor that will carry pollen from flower to\r\nflower as he feeds depends their chance of producing fertile\r\nseed. It is probable the flower is white that night-flying moths\r\nmay see it shine in the gloaming. From the length and slenderness\r\nof its spur it is doubtless adapted to the sphinx moth.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the nectary, two sticky disks stand on guard,\r\nready to fasten themselves to the eyes of the first moth that\r\ninserts his tongue; and he finds on withdrawing his head that two\r\npollen-masses attached to these disks have been removed with\r\nthem. This plastering over of insects' eyes by the orchids might\r\nbe serious business, indeed, were not the lepidoptera gifted with\r\nnumerous pairs. The fragrance of many orchids, however, would be\r\na sufficient guide even to a blind insect. With the pollen-masses\r\nsticking to his forehead, the moth enters another flower and\r\nnecessarily rubs off some grains from the pollen masses, that\r\nhave changed their attitude during his flight that they may be in\r\nthe precise position to fertilize the viscid stigma. In almost\r\nthe same way the similar Yellow-Fringed Orchis (H. ciliaris) and\r\nthe great green orchids compel insects to work for them.\r\n\r\nA larger-flowered species, the PRAIRIE WHITE-FRINGED ORCHIS (H.\r\nlepicophea), found in bloom in June and July, on moist, open\r\nground from western New York to Minnesota and Arkansas, differs\r\nfrom the preceding chiefly in having larger and greenish-white\r\nflowers, the lip cleft into wedge-shaped segments deeply fringed.\r\nThe hawk-moth removes on its tongue one, but not often both, of\r\nthe pollinia attached to disks on either side of the entrance to\r\nthe spur.\r\n\r\n\r\nNODDING LADIES' TRESSES or TRACES\r\n  (Gyrostachys cernua; Spiranthes cernua of Gray)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white or yellowish, without a spur, fragrant,\r\nnodding or spreading in 3 rows on a cylindrical, slightly twisted\r\nspike 4 or 5 in. long. Side sepals free, the upper ones arching,\r\nand united with petals; the oblong, spreading lip crinkle-edged,\r\nand bearing minute, hairy callosities at bases Stem: 6 in. to 2\r\nft. tall, with several pointed, wrapping bracts. Leaves: From or\r\nnear the base, linear, almost grass-like.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low meadows, ditches, and swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, and westward to\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThis last orchid of the season, and perhaps the commonest of its\r\ninteresting tribe in the eastern United States, at least, bears\r\nflowers that, however insignificant in size, are marvelous pieces\r\nof mechanism, to which such men as Charles Darwin and Asa Gray\r\nhave devoted hours of study and, these two men particularly, much\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nJust as a woodpecker begins at the bottom of a tree and taps his\r\nway upward, so a bee begins at the lower and older flowers on a\r\nspike and works up to the younger ones; a fact on which this\r\nlittle orchid, like many another plant that arranges its b1ossoms\r\nin long racemes, depends. Let us not note for the present what\r\nhappens in the older flowers, but begin our observations, with\r\nthe help of a powerful lens, when the bee has alighted on the\r\nspreading lip of a newly opened blossom toward the top of the\r\nspire. As nectar is already secreted for her in its receptacle,\r\nshe thrusts her tongue through the channel provided to guide it\r\naright, and by the slight contact with the furrowed rostellum, it\r\nsplits, and releases a boat-shaped disk standing vertically on\r\nits stern in the passage. Within the boat is an extremely sticky\r\ncement that hardens almost instantly on exposure to the air. The\r\nsplitting of the rostellum, curiously enough, never happens\r\nwithout insect aid; but if a bristle or needle be passed over it\r\never so lightly, a stream of sticky, milky fluid exudes, hardens,\r\nand the boat-shaped disk, with pollen masses attached, may be\r\nwithdrawn on the bristle just as the bee removes them with her\r\ntongue. Each pollinium consists of two leaves of pollen united\r\nfor about half their length in the middle with elastic threads.\r\nAs the pollinia are attached parallel to the disk, they stick\r\nparallel on the bee's tongue, yet she may fold up her proboscis\r\nunder her head, if she choose, without inconvenience from the\r\npollen masses, or without danger of loosening them. Now, having\r\nfinished sucking the newly opened flowers at the top of the\r\nspike, away she flies to an older flower at the bottom of another\r\none. Here a marvelous thing has happened. The passage which, when\r\nthe flower first expanded, scarcely permitted a bristle to pass,\r\nhas now widened through the automatic downward movement of the\r\ncolumn in order to expose the stigmatic surfaces to contact with\r\nthe pollen masses brought by the bee. Without the bee's help this\r\norchid, with a host of other flowers, must disappear from the\r\nface of the earth. So very many species which have lost the power\r\nto fertilize themselves now depend absolutely on these little\r\npollen carriers, it is safe to say that, should the bees perish,\r\none half our flora would be exterminated with them. On the slight\r\ndownward movement of the column in the ladies' tresses, then, as\r\nwell as on the bee's ministrations, the fertilization of the\r\nflower absolutely depends. \"If the stigma of the lowest flower\r\nhas already been fully fertilized,\" says Darwin, \"little or no\r\npollen will be left on its dried surface; but on the next\r\nsucceeding flower, of which the stigma is adhesive, large sheets\r\nof pollen will be left. Then as soon as the bee arrives near the\r\nsummit of the spike she will withdraw fresh pollinia, will fly to\r\nthe lower flowers on another plant, and fertilize them; and thus,\r\nas she goes her rounds and adds to her store of honey, she\r\ncontinually fertilizes fresh flowers and perpetuates the race of\r\nautumnal spiranthes, which will yield honey to future generations\r\nof bees.\"\r\n\r\nThe SLENDER LADIES' TRESSES (G. gracilis; [S. gracilis]), with a\r\nrange and season of blossom similar to the preceding species, and\r\nwith even smaller white, fragrant flowers, growing on one side of\r\na twisted spike, chooses dry fields, hillsides, open woods, and\r\nsandy places - queer habitats for a member of its moisture-loving\r\ntribe. Its leaves have usually fallen by flowering time. The\r\ncluster of tuberous, spindle-shaped roots are an aid to\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSER RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN [DWARF RATTLESNAKE-PLANTAIN]\r\n  (Peramium repens; Goodyera repens of Gray)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, greenish white, the lip pocket-shaped, borne on\r\none side of a bracted spike 5 to 10 in. high, from a fleshy,\r\nthick fibrous root. Leaves: From the base, tufted, or ascending\r\nthe stem on one side for a few inches, 1/2 in. to over 1 in.\r\nlong, ovate, the silvery-white veins forming a network, or leaf\r\nblotched with white.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods, especially under evergreens.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Colorado eastward to the Atlantic, from Nova\r\nScotia to Florida. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nTufts of these beautifully marked little leaves carpeting the\r\nground in the shadow of the hemlocks attract the eye, rather than\r\nthe spires of insignificantly small flowers. Whoever wishes to\r\nknow how the bumblebee ruptures the sensitive membrane within the\r\ntiny blossom with her tongue, and draws out the pollinia that are\r\ninstantly cemented to it after much the same plan employed by the\r\nladies' tresses, must use a good lens in studying the operation.\r\nTo the structural botanist the rattlesnake plantains form an\r\ninteresting connecting link between orchids of d1stinct forms. In\r\nthem we see a tendency to lengthen the pollen-masses into\r\ncaudicles as the showy orchis, for example, has done. \"Goodyera\r\nprobably shows us the state of organs in a group of orchids now\r\nmostly extinct,\" says Darwin; \"but the parents of many living\r\ndescendants.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Indians use this plant to cure bites of\r\nthe rattlesnake; that they will handle the deadly creature\r\nwithout fear if some of these leaves are near at hand - in fact,\r\na good deal is said about Indians by palefaces that makes even\r\nthe stolid red man smile when confronted with the white man's\r\ntales about him. An intelligent Indian student declares that none\r\nof his race will handle a rattlesnake unless its fangs have been\r\nremoved; that this plant takes its name from the resemblance of\r\nits netted-veined leaves to the belly of a serpent, and not to\r\ntheir curative powers; and, finally, that the Southern tribes,\r\nespecially so reverence the rattlesnake that, far from trying to\r\ncure its bite, they count themselves blessed to be bitten to\r\ndeath by one. Indeed, the rattle, a sacred symbol, has been\r\nemployed in religious ceremonies of most tribes. Snakes may be\r\nrevered in other lands, but only in America is the rattlesnake\r\nworshipped. Among the Moquis there still survives much of the\r\nreligion of the snake-worshipping Aztecs. Bernal Diaz tells how\r\nliving rattlesnakes, kept in the great temple at Mexico as sacred\r\nand petted objects, were fed with the bodies of the sacrificed.\r\nCortes found a town called by the Spaniards Terraguea, or the\r\ncity of serpents, whose walls and temples were decorated with\r\nfigures of the reptiles, which the inhabitants worshiped as gods.\r\n\r\nThe DOWNY RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN (P. pubescens), usually a taller\r\nplant than the preceding, with larger cream-white,\r\nglobular-lipped flowers on both sides of its spike, and\r\nglandular-hairy throughout, has even more strongly marked leaves.\r\nThese, the most conspicuous parts, are dark grayish green,\r\nheavily netted with greenish or silvery-white veins, silky to the\r\ntouch, and often wavy edged. This plant scarcely strays westward\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, but it is common East. It also blooms in\r\nmidsummer, and shows a preference for dry woods where oak and\r\npine abound.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIZARD'S TAIL [LIZARD'S-TAIL, WATER-DRAGON]\r\n  (Saurus cernuus)  Lizard's-tail family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fragrant, very small, white, lacking a perianth,\r\nbracted, densely crowded on peduncled, slender spikes 4 to 6 in.\r\nlong and nodding at the tip. Stamens 6 to 8, the filaments white;\r\ncarpels 3 or 4, united at base, dangling. Stem: 2 to 5 ft. high,\r\njointed, sparingly branched, leafy. Leaves: Heart-shaped,\r\npalmately ribbed, dark green, thin, on stout petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, shallow water.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Southern New England to the Gulf, westward to\r\nMinnesota and Texas.\r\n\r\nThe fragrance arising from these curious, drooping, tail-like\r\nspikes of flowers, where they grow in numbers, must lure their\r\ninsect friends as it does us, since no showy petals or sepals\r\nadvertise their presence. Nevertheless they are what are known as\r\nperfect flowers, each possessing stamens and pistils, the only\r\ntruly essential parts, however desirable a gaily colored perianth\r\nmay be to blossoms attempting to woo such large land insects as\r\nthe bumblebee and butterfly. Since flies, whose color sense is by\r\nno means so acute as their sense of smell, are by far the most\r\nabundant fertilizers of waterside plants, we can see a tendency\r\nin such to suppress their petals, for the flowers to become\r\nminute and massed in series that the little visitors may more\r\nreadily transfer pollen from one to another, and to become\r\nfragrant - just what the lizard's tail has done.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING BEAUTY; CLAYTONIA\r\n  (Claytonia Virginica)  Purslane family.\r\n\r\nFlowers - White veined with pink, or all pink, the veinings of\r\ndeeper shade, on curving, slender pedicels, several borne in a\r\nterminal loose raceme, the flowers mostly turned one way\r\n(secund). Calyx of 2 ovate sepals; corolla of 5 petals slightly\r\nunited by their bases; 5 stamens, 1 inserted on base of each\r\npetal; the style 3-cleft. Stem: Weak, 6 to 12 in. long, from a\r\ndeep, tuberous root. Leaves: Opposite above, linear to\r\nlance-shaped, shorter than basal ones, which are 3 to 7 in. long;\r\nbreadth variable.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods, open groves, low meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and far westward, south to Georgia and\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nDainty clusters of these delicate, starry blossoms, mostly turned\r\nin one direction, expand in the sunshine only, like their gaudy\r\ncousin the portulaca and the insignificant little yellow flowers\r\nof another relative, the ubiquitous, invincible \"pussley\"\r\nimmortalized in \"My Summer in a Garden.\" At night and during\r\ncloudy, stormy weather, when their benefactors are not flying,\r\nthe claytonias economically close their petals to protect nectar\r\nand pollen from rain and pilferers. Pick them, the whole plant\r\ndroops, and the blossoms close with indignation; nor will any\r\ncoaxing but a combination of hot water and sunshine induce them\r\nto open again. Theirs is a long beauty sleep. They are\r\nsupersensitive exquisites, however hardy.\r\n\r\nVery early in the spring a race is run with the hepatica,\r\narbutus, adder's tongue, blood-root, squirrel corn, and anemone\r\nfor the honor of being the earliest wild flower; and although\r\nJohn Burroughs and Dr. Abbott have had the exceptional experience\r\nof finding the claytonia even before the hepatica - certainly the\r\nearliest spring blossom worthy the name in the Middle and New\r\nEngland States - of course the rank skunk-cabbage, whose name is\r\nsnobbishly excluded from the list of fair competitors, has\r\nquietly opened dozens of minute florets in its incurved horn\r\nbefore the others have even started.\r\n\r\nWhether the petals of the spring beauty are white or pink, they\r\nare always exquisitely marked with pink lines converging near the\r\nbase and ending in a yellow blotch to serve as pathfinders for\r\nthe female bumblebees and the little brown bombylius, among other\r\npollen carriers. A newly opened flower, with its stamens\r\nsurrounding the pistil, must be in peril of self-fertilization\r\none would think who did not notice that when the pollen is in\r\ncondition for removal by the bees and flies, the stigmatic\r\nsurfaces of the three-cleft style are tightly pressed together\r\nthat not a grain may touch them. But when the anthers have shed\r\ntheir pollen, and the filaments have spread outward and away from\r\nthe pistil, the three stigmatic arms branch out to receive the\r\nfertilizing dust carried from younger flowers by their busy\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARRY CAMPION\r\n  (Silene stellata)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, about 1/2 in. broad or over, loosely clustered\r\nin a showy, pyramidal panicle. Calyx bell-shaped, swollen,\r\n5-toothed, sticky; 5 fringed and clawed petals; 10 long, exserted\r\nstamens; 3 styles. Stem: Erect, leafy, 2 to 3 1/2 ft. tall,\r\nrough-hairy. Leaves: Oval, tapering to a point, 2 to 4 in. long,\r\nseated in whorls of 4 around stem, or loose ones opposite.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods, shady banks.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Rhode Island westward to Mississippi, south to the\r\nCarolinas and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nFeathery white panicles of the starry campion, whose protruding\r\nstamens and fringed petals give it a certain fleeciness, are\r\ndainty enough for spring; by midsummer we expect plants of ranker\r\ngrowth and more gaudy flowers. To save the nectar in each deep\r\ntube for the moths and butterflies which cross-fertilize all this\r\ntribe of night and day blossoms, most of them - and the campions\r\nare notorious examples - spread their calices, and some their\r\npedicels as well, with a sticky substance to entrap little\r\ncrawling pilferers. Although a popular name for the genus is\r\ncatchfly, it is usually the ant that is glued to the viscid\r\nparts, for the fly that moves through the air alights directly on\r\nthe flower it is too short-lipped to suck. An ant catching its\r\nfeet on the miniature lime-twig, at first raises one foot after\r\nanother and draws it through its mouth, hoping to rid it of the\r\nsticky stuff, but only with the result of gluing up its head and\r\nother parts of the body. In ten minutes all the pathetic\r\nstruggles are ended. Let no one guilty of torturing flies to\r\ndeath on sticky paper condemn the Silenes!\r\n\r\nThe BLADDER CAMPION (S. vulgaris; S. inflata of Gray) to be\r\nrecognized by its much inflated calyx, especially round in fruit,\r\nthe two-cleft white petals; and its opposite leaves that are\r\nspatulate at the base of the plant, is a European immigrant now\r\nnaturalized and locally very common from Illinois eastward to New\r\nJersey and north to New Brunswick. Like the night-flowering\r\ncatchfly this blossom has adapted itself to the night-flying\r\nmoths; but when either remains open in the morning, bumblebees\r\ngladly take the leavings in the deep cup. To insure\r\ncross-fertilization, some of the bladder-campion flowers have\r\nstamens only, some have a pistil only; some have both organs\r\nmaturing at different times. In all the night-flowering Silene,\r\neach flower, unless unusually disturbed, lasts three days and\r\nthree nights. Late in the afternoon of the first day, when the\r\npetals begin to expand, the five stamens opposite the sepals\r\nlengthen in about two hours, and by sunset the anthers, which\r\nhave matured at the same time, are covered with pollen. So they\r\nremain until the forenoon of the second day, and then the emptied\r\nanthers hang like shriveled bags, or drop off altogether. Late in\r\nthe second afternoon, the second set of stamens repeat the\r\nactions of their predecessors, bend backward and shed their\r\nanthers the following, that is to say the third, morning. But on\r\nthe third afternoon up rise the S-shaped, twisted stigmas, which\r\nuntil now had been hidden in the center of the flower. Moths,\r\ntherefore, must transfer pollen from younger to older blossoms.\r\n\r\n\"With this lengthening and bending of the stamens and stigmas,\"\r\nsays Dr. Kerner, \"goes hand in hand the opening and shutting of\r\nthe corolla. With the approach of dusk, the bifid limbs of the\r\npetals spread out in a flat surface and fall back against the\r\ncalyx. In this position they remain through the night, and not\r\ntill the following morning do they begin (more quickly in\r\nsunshine and with a mild temperature, more slowly with a cloudy\r\nsky and in cold, wet weather) to curl themselves up in an\r\nin-curved spire, while at the same time they form longitudinal\r\ncreases, and look as though they were gathered in, or\r\nwrinkled;...but no sooner does evening return than the wrinkles\r\ndisappear, the petals become smooth, uncurl themselves, and fall\r\nback upon the calyx, and the corolla is again expanded.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, these flowers, which by day we should certainly\r\nsay were not fragrant, give forth a strong perfume at evening the\r\nbetter to guide moths to their feast. From eight in the evening\r\nuntil three in the morning the fragrance is especially strong.\r\nThe white blossoms, so conspicuous at night, have little\r\nattraction for color-loving butterflies and bees by day; then, as\r\nthere is no pollen to be carried from the shriveled anther sacs,\r\nno visitor is welcome, and the petals close to protect the nectar\r\nfor the flower's true benefactors. Indeed, few flowers show more\r\nthorough adaptation to the night-flying moths than these Silene.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOKEWEED; SCOKE; PIGEON-BERRY; INK-BERRY; GARGET\r\n  (Phytolacca decandra)  Pokeweed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, with a green centre, pink-tinted outside, about\r\n1/4 in. across, in bracted racemes 2 to 8 in. long. Calyx of 4 or\r\n5 rounded persistent sepals, simulating petals; no corolla; 10\r\nshort stamens; 10-celled ovary, green, conspicuous; styles\r\ncurved. Stem: Stout, pithy, erect, branching, reddening toward\r\nthe end of summer, 4 to 10 ft. tall, from a large, perennial,\r\npoisonous root. Leaves: Alternate, petioled, oblong to\r\nlance-shaped, tapering at both ends, 8 to 12 in. long. Fruit:\r\nVery juicy, dark purplish berries, hanging in long clusters from\r\nreddened footstalks; ripe, August-October.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, thickets, field borders, and waste\r\nsoil, especially in burnt-over districts.\r\nFlowering Season - June-October.\r\nDistribution - Maine and Ontario to Florida and Texas.\r\n\r\nWhen the pokeweed is \"all on fire with ripeness,\" as Thoreau\r\nsaid; when the stout, vigorous stem (which he coveted for a\r\ncane), the large leaves, and even the footstalks, take on\r\nsplendid tints of crimson lake, and the dark berries hang heavy\r\nwith juice in the thickets, then the birds, with increased,\r\nhungry families, gather in flocks as a preliminary step to\r\ntraveling southward. Has the brilliant, strong-scented plant no\r\nulterior motive in thus attracting their attention at this\r\nparticular time? Surely! Robins, flickers, and downy woodpeckers,\r\nchewinks and rose-breasted grosbeaks, among other feathered\r\nagents, may be detected in the act of gormandizing on the fruit,\r\nwhose undigested seeds they will disperse far and wide. Their\r\ndroppings form the best of fertilizers for young seedlings;\r\ntherefore the plants which depend on birds to distribute seeds,\r\nas most berry bearers do, send their children abroad to found new\r\ncolonies, well equipped for a vigorous start in life. What a\r\nhideous mockery to continue to call this fruit the pigeon-berry,\r\nwhen the exquisite bird whose favorite food it once was, has been\r\nannihilated from this land of liberty by the fowler's net! And\r\nyet flocks of wild pigeons, containing not thousands but millions\r\nof birds, nested here even thirty years ago. When the market\r\nbecame glutted with them, they were fed to hogs in the West!\r\n\r\nChildren, and some grown-ups, find the deep magenta juice of the\r\nink-berry useful. Notwithstanding the poisonous properties of the\r\nroot, in some sections the young shoots are boiled and eaten like\r\nasparagus, evidently with no disastrous consequences. For any\r\nservice this plant may render to man and bird, they are under\r\nspecial obligation to the little Halictus bees, but to other\r\nshort-tongued bees and flies as well. These small visitors,\r\nflying from such of the flowers as mature their anthers first,\r\ncarry pollen to those in the female, or pistillate, stage.\r\nExposed nectar rewards their involuntary kindness. In stormy\r\nweather, when no benefactors can fly, the flowers are adapted to\r\nfertilize themselves through the curving of the styles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON CHICKWEED\r\n  (Aisine media; Stellaria media of Gray)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, on slender pedicels from leaf axils, also\r\nin terminal clusters. Calyx (usually) of 5 sepals, much longer\r\nthan the 5 (usually) 2-parted petals; 2-10 stamens; 3 or 4\r\nstyles. Stem: Weak, branched, tufted, leafy, 4 to 6 in long, a\r\nhairy fringe on one side. Leaves: Opposite, acutely oval, lower\r\nones petioled, upper ones seated on stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, shady soil; woods; meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - Throughout the year.\r\nDistribution - Almost universal.\r\n\r\nThe sole use man has discovered for this often pestiferous weed\r\nwith which nature carpets moist soil the world around is to feed\r\ncaged song-birds. What is the secret of the insignificant little\r\nplant's triumphal progress? Like most immigrants that have\r\nundergone ages of selective struggle in the Old World, it\r\nsuccessfully competes with our native blossoms by readily\r\nadjusting itself to new conditions, filling places unoccupied,\r\nand chiefly by prolonging its season of bloom beyond theirs, to\r\nget relief from the pressure of competition for insect trade in\r\nthe busy season. Except during the most cruel frosts, there is\r\nscarcely a day in the year when we may not find the little\r\nstar-like chickweed flowers. Contrast this season with that of a\r\nnative chickweed, the LONG-LEAVED STITCHWORT [LONG-LEAVED\r\nCHICKWEED] (A. longifolia [S. longifolia]), blooming only from\r\nMay till July, when competition is fiercest! Also, the common\r\nchickweed has its parts so arranged that it can fertilize itself\r\nwhen it is too cold for insect pollen-carriers to fly; then,\r\nespecially, are many of its stamens abortive, not to waste the\r\nprecious dust. Yet even in winter it produces abundant seed. In\r\nsunny, fine spring weather, however, when so much nectar is\r\nsecreted the fine little drops may be easily seen by the naked\r\neye, small bees, flies, and even thrips visit the blossoms whose\r\nanthers shed pollen one by one before the three stigmatic\r\nsurfaces are ready to receive any from younger flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-SCENTED WHITE WATER LILY; POND LILY; WATER NYMPH; WATER\r\nCABBAGE [FRAGRANT WATER-LILY]\r\n  (Castalia odorata; Nymphaea odorata of Gray)  Water-lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pure white or pink tinged, rarely deep pink, solitary,\r\n3 to 8 in. across, deliciously fragrant, floating. Calyx of 4\r\nsepals, green outside; petals of indefinite number, overlapping\r\nin many rows, and gradually passing into an indefinite number of\r\nstamens; outer row of stamens with petaloid filaments and short\r\nanthers, the inner yellow stamens with slender filaments and\r\nelongated anthers; carpels of indefinite number, united into a\r\ncompound pistil, with spreading and projecting stigmas. Leaves:\r\nFloating, nearly round, slit at bottom, shining green above,\r\nreddish and more or less hairy below, 4 to 12 in. across,\r\nattached to petiole at center of lower surface. Petioles and\r\npeduncles round and rubber-like, with 4 main air-channels.\r\nRootstock: (Not true stem), thick, simple or with few branches,\r\nvery long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Still water, ponds, lakes, slow streams.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Gulf of Mexico, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nSumptuous queen of our native aquatic plants, of the royal family\r\nto which the gigantic Victoria regia of Brazil belongs, and all\r\nthe lovely rose, lavender, blue, and golden exotic water lilies\r\nin the fountains of our city parks, to her man, beast, and insect\r\npay grateful homage. In Egypt, India, China, Japan, Persia, and\r\nAsiatic Russia, how many millions have bent their heads in\r\nadoration of her relative the sacred lotus! From its center\r\nBrahma came forth; Buddha, too, whose symbol is the lotus, first\r\nappeared floating on the mystic flower (Nelumbo nelumbo, formerly\r\nNelumbium speciosum). Happily the lovely pink or white \"sacred\r\nbean\" or \"rose-lily\" of the Nile, often cultivated here, has been\r\nsuccessfully naturalized in ponds about Bordentown, New Jersey,\r\nand maybe elsewhere. If he who planteth a tree is greater than he\r\nwho taketh a city, that man should be canonized who introduces\r\nthe magnificent wild flowers of foreign lands to our area of\r\nNature's garden.\r\n\r\nNow, cultivation of our native water lilies and all their hardy\r\nkin, like charity, begins at home. Their culture in tubs, casks,\r\nor fountains on the lawn, is so very simple a matter, and the\r\nflowers bloom so freely, every garden should have a corner for\r\naquatic plants. Secure the water-lily roots as early in the\r\nspring as possible, and barely cover them with good rich loam or\r\nmuck spread over the bottom of the sunken tub to a depth of six\r\nor eight inches. After it has been filled with water, and\r\nreplenished from time to time to make good the loss by\r\nevaporation, the water garden needs no attention until autumn.\r\nThen the tub should be drained, and removed to a cellar, or it\r\nmay be covered over with a thick mattress of dry leaves to\r\nprotect from hard freezing. In their natural haunts, water lilies\r\nsink to the bottom, where the water is warmest in winter.\r\nPossibly the seed is ripened below the surface for the same\r\nreason. At no time should the crown of the cultivated plant be\r\nlower than two feet below the water. If a number of species are\r\ngrown, it is best to plant each kind in a separate basket, sunk\r\nin the shallow tub, to prevent the roots from growing together,\r\nas well as to obtain more effective decoration. Charming results\r\nmay be obtained with small outlay of either money or time.\r\nNothing brings more birds about the house than one of these water\r\ngardens; that serves at once as drinking fountain and bath to our\r\nnot over-squeamish feathered neighbors. The number of insects\r\nthese destroy, not to mention the joy of their presence, would\r\nalone compensate the householder of economic bent for the cost of\r\na shallow concrete tank.\r\n\r\nOpening some time after six o'clock in the morning, the white\r\nwater lily spreads its many-petalled, deliciously fragrant,\r\ngolden-centered chalice to welcome the late-flying bees and\r\nflower flies, the chief pollinators. Beetles, \"skippers,\" and\r\nmany other creatures on wings alight too. \"I have named two\r\nspecies of bees (Halictus nelumbonis and Prosopis nelumbonis) on\r\naccount of their close economic relation to these flowers,\" says\r\nProfessor Robertson, who has captured over two hundred and fifty\r\nspecies of bees near his home in Carlinville, Illinois, and\r\ndescribed nearly a third of them as new. Linnaeus, no doubt the\r\nfirst to conceive the pretty idea of making a floral clock, drew\r\nup a list of blossoms whose times of opening and closing marked\r\nthe hours on its face; but even Linnaeus failed to understand\r\nthat the flight of insects is the mainspring on which flowers\r\ndepend to set the mechanism going. In spite of its whiteness and\r\nfragrance, the water lily requires no help from night-flying\r\ninsects in getting its pollen transferred; therefore, when the\r\nbees and flies rest from their labors at sundown, it may close\r\nthe blinds of its shop, business being ended for the day.\r\n\r\n\"When doctors disagree, who shall decide?\" It is contended by one\r\ngroup of scientists that the water lily, which shows the plainest\r\nmetamorphosis of some sort, has developed its stamens from petals\r\n- just the reverse of Nature's method, other botanists claim. A\r\nperfect flower, we know, may consist of only a stamen and a\r\npistil, the essential organs, all other parts being desirable,\r\nbut of only secondary importance. Gardeners, taking advantage of\r\na wild flower's natural tendency to develop petals from stamens\r\nand to become \"double,\" are able to produce the magnificent roses\r\nand chrysanthemums of today; and so it would seem that the water\r\nlily, which may be either self-fertilized or cross-fertilized by\r\npollen-carriers in its present state of development, is looking\r\nto a more ideal condition by increasing its attractiveness to\r\ninsects as it increases the number of its petals, and by\r\neconomizing pollen in transforming some of the superfluous\r\nstamens into petals.\r\n\r\nScientific speculation, incited by the very fumes of the student\r\nlamp, may weary us in winter, but just as surely is it dispelled\r\nby the fragrance of the lilies in June. Then, floating about in a\r\nbirch canoe among the lily-pads, while one envies the very moose\r\nand deer that may feed on fare so dainty and spend their lives\r\namid scenes of such exquisite beauty, one lets thought also float\r\nas idly as the little clouds high overhead.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL or SMALL MAGNOLIA; SWEET or WHITE BAY; SWAMP LAUREL or\r\nSASSAFRAS; BEAVER-TREE [SWEETBAY MAGNOLIA]\r\n  (Magnolia Virginiana; M. glauca of Gray)  Magnolia family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, 2 to 3 in. across, globular, depressed,\r\ndeliciously fragrant, solitary at ends of branches. Calyx of 3\r\npetal-like, spreading sepals. Corolla of 6 to 12 concave rounded\r\npetals in rows; stamens very numerous, short, with long anthers;\r\ncarpels also numerous, and borne on the thick, green, elongated\r\nreceptacle. Trunk: 4 to 70 ft. high. Leaves: Enfolded in the bud\r\nby stipules that fall later and leave rings around gradually\r\nlengthening branch; the leaves 3 to 6 in. long in maturity,\r\nbroadly oblong, thick, almost evergreen, dark above, pale\r\nbeneath, on short petioles. Fruit: An oblong, reddish pink cone,\r\nfleshy, from which the scarlet seeds hang by slender threads.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swampy woods and open swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Atlantic States from Massachusetts southward, and\r\nGulf States from Florida to Texas.\r\n\r\n\"Every flower its own bo-quet!\" shouted by a New York street\r\nvender of the lovely magnolia blossoms he had just gathered from\r\nthe Jersey swamps, emphasized only one of the many claims they\r\nhave upon popular attention. Far and wide the handsome shrub,\r\nwhich frequently attains a tree's height, is exported from its\r\nnative hiding-places to adorn men's gardens, and there, where a\r\nbetter opportunity to know it at all seasons is granted, one\r\ncannot tell which to admire most, the dark, bluish-green leathery\r\nleaves, silvery beneath; the cream-white, deliciously fragrant\r\nblossoms that turn pale apricot with age; or the brilliant\r\nfruiting cone with the scarlet seeds a-dangling. At all seasons\r\nit is a delight. When most members of this lovely tribe confine\r\nthemselves to warm latitudes, we especially prize the species\r\nthat naturally endures the rigorous climate of the \"stern New\r\nEngland coast.\"\r\n\r\nBeavers (when they used to be common in the East) so often made\r\nuse of the laurel magnolia, not only of the roots for food, but\r\nof the trunk, whose bitter bark, white sapwood, and soft,\r\nreddish-brown heartwood were gnawed in constructing their huts,\r\nthat in some sections it is still known as the beaver-tree.\r\nAccording to Delpino, the conspicuous, pollen-laden magnolia\r\nflowers, with their easily accessible nectar, attract beetles\r\nchiefly. These winged messengers, entering the heart of a newly\r\nopened blossom, find shelter beneath the inner petals that form a\r\nvault above their heads, and warmth that may be felt by the\r\nfinger, and abundant food; consequently they remain long in an\r\nasylum so delightful, or until the expanding petals turn them out\r\nto carry the pollen, with which they have been thoroughly dusted\r\nduring their hospitable entertainment, to younger flowers. As the\r\nblossoms mature their stigmas in the first stage and the anthers\r\nin the second, it follows the beetles must regularly\r\ncross-fertilize them as they fly from one shelter to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD-THREAD; CANKER-ROOT [GOLDTHREAD]\r\n  (Coptis trifolia)  Crowfoot family [Buttercup family]\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small white, solitary, on a slender scape 3 to 6 in.\r\nhigh. Sepals 5 to 7, petal-like, falling early; petals 5 or 6,\r\ninconspicuous, like club-shaped columns; stamens numerous carpels\r\nfew, the stigmatic surfaces curved. Leaves: From the base, long\r\npetioled, divided into 3 somewhat fan-shaped, shining, evergreen,\r\nsharply toothed leaflets. Rootstock: Thread-like, long, bright\r\nyellow, wiry, bitter.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool mossy bogs, damp woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August\r\nDistribution - Maryland and Minnesota northward to circumpolar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe shining, evergreen, thrice-parted leaves with which this\r\ncharming little plant carpets its retreats form the best of\r\nbackgrounds to set off the fragile, tiny white flowers that look\r\nlike small wood anemones. Why does the gold-thread choose to\r\ndwell where bees and butterflies, most flowers' best friends,\r\nrarely penetrate? Doubtless because the cool, damp habitat that\r\ndevelops abundant fungi also perfectly suits the fungus gnats and\r\ncertain fungus-feeding beetles that are its principal\r\nbenefactors. \"The entire flower is constructed with reference to\r\ntheir visits,\" says Mr. Clarence Moores Weed; \"the showy sepals\r\nattract their attention; the abnormal petals furnish them food;\r\nthe many small stamens with white anthers and white pollen\r\nfurnish a surface to walk upon, and a foreground in which the\r\nyellow nectar-cups are distinctly visible; the long-spreading\r\nrecurved stigmas cover so large a portion of the blossom that it\r\nwould be difficult even for one of the tiny visitors to take many\r\nsteps without contact with one of them.\" On a sunny June day the\r\nlens usually reveals at least one tiny gnat making his way from\r\none club-shaped petal to another - for the insignificant petals\r\nare mere nectaries - and transferring pollen from flower to\r\nflower.\r\n\r\nDig up a plant, and the fine tangled, yellow roots tell why it\r\nwas given its name. In the good old days when decoctions of any\r\nherb that was particularly nauseous were swallowed in the simple\r\nfaith that virtue resided in them in proportion to their\r\nrevolting taste, the gold-thread's bitter roots furnished a tea\r\nmuch valued as a spring tonic and as a cure for ulcerated throats\r\nand canker-sore mouths of helpless children.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE BANEBERRY\r\n  (Actaea alba)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, in a terminal oblong raceme. Calyx of 3\r\nto 5 petal-like, early-falling sepals; petals very small, 4 to\r\n10, spatulate, clawed; stamens white, numerous, longer than\r\npetals; 1 pistil with a broad stigma. Stem: Erect, bushy, to 2\r\nft. high. Leaves: Twice or thrice compounded of sharply toothed\r\nand pointed, sometimes lobed, leaflets, petioled. Fruit: Clusters\r\nof poisonous oval white berries with dark purple spot on end,\r\nformed from the pistils. Both pedicels and peduncles much\r\nthickened and often red after fruiting.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool, shady, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia and far West.\r\n\r\nHowever insignificant the short fuzzy clusters of flowers lifted\r\nby this bushy little plant, we cannot fail to name it after it\r\nhas set those curious white berries with a dark spot on the end,\r\nwhich Mrs. Starr Dana graphically compares to \"the china eyes\r\nthat small children occasionally manage to gouge from their\r\ndolls' heads.\" For generations they have been called \"doll's\r\neyes\" in Massachusetts. Especially after these poisonous berries\r\nfully ripen and the rigid stems which bear them thicken and\r\nredden, we cannot fail to notice them. As the sepals fall early,\r\nthe white stamens and stigmas are the most conspicuous parts of\r\nthe flowers. A cluster opening its blossoms almost\r\nsimultaneously, the plant's only hope of cross-fertilization lies\r\nin the expectation that the small female bees (Halictus) which\r\ncome for pollen - no nectar being secreted - will leave some\r\nbrought from another flower on the stigma as they enter, and\r\nbefore collecting a fresh supply. The time elapsing between the\r\nmaturity of the stigmas and the anthers is barely perceptible;\r\nnevertheless there is a tendency toward the former maturing\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe RED BANEBERRY, COHOSH, or HERB-CHRISTOPHER (A. rubra; A.\r\nspicata, var. rubra of Gray) - a more common species northward,\r\nalthough with a range, habit, and aspect similar to the\r\npreceding, may be known by its more ovoid raceme of feathery\r\nwhite flowers, its less sharply pointed leaves, and, above all,\r\nby its rigid clusters of oval red berries on slender pedicels, so\r\nconspicuous in the woods of late summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK COHOSH; BLACK SNAKEROOT; TALL BUGBANE\r\n  (Cimicifuga racemosa)  Crowfoot family [Buttercup family]\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fetid, feathery, white, in an elongated wand-like\r\nraceme, 6 in. to 2 ft. long, at the end of a stem 3 to 8 ft.\r\nhigh. Sepals petal-like, falling early; 4 to 8 small stamen-like\r\npetals 2-cleft; stamens very numerous, with long filaments; 1 or\r\n2 sessile pistils with broad stigmas. Leaves: Alternate, on long\r\npetioles, thrice compounded of oblong, deeply toothed or cleft\r\nleaflets, the end leaflet often again compound. Fruit: Dry oval\r\npods, their seeds in 2 rows.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich woods and woodland borders, hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Georgia, and westward from Ontario to\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nTall white rockets, shooting upward from a mass of large handsome\r\nleaves in some heavily shaded midsummer woodland border, cannot\r\nfail to impress themselves through more than one sense, for their\r\nodor is as disagreeable as the fleecy white blossoms are\r\nstriking. Obviously such flowers would be most attractive to the\r\ncarrion and meat flies. Cimicifuga, meaning to drive away bugs,\r\nand the old folk-name of bugbane testify to a degree of\r\noffensiveness to other insects, where the flies' enjoyment\r\nbegins. As these are the only insects one is likely to see about\r\nthe fleecy wands, doubtless they are their benefactors. The\r\ncountless stamens which feed them generously with pollen\r\nwillingly left for them alone must also dust them well as they\r\ncrawl about before flying to another fetid lunch.\r\n\r\nThe close kinship with the baneberries is detected at once on\r\nexamining one of these flowers. Were the vigorous plant less\r\noffensive to the nostrils, many a garden would be proud to own so\r\ndecorative an addition to the shrubbery border.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD ANEMONE; WIND FLOWER\r\n  (Anemone quinquefolia)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Solitary, about 1 in. broad, white or delicately tinted\r\nwith blue or pink outside. Calyx of 4 to 9 oval, petal-like\r\nsepals; no petals; stamens and carpels numerous, of indefinite\r\nnumber. Stem: Slender, 4 to 9 in. high, from horizontal elongated\r\nrootstock. Leaves: On slender petioles, in a whorl of 3 to 5\r\nbelow the flower, each leaf divided into 3 to 5 variously cut and\r\nlobed parts; also a late-appearing leaf from the base.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woodlands, hillsides, light soil, partial\r\nshade.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Canada and United States, south to Georgia, west\r\nto Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAccording to one poetical Greek tradition, Anemos, the wind,\r\nemploys these exquisitely delicate little star-like namesakes as\r\nheralds of his coming in early spring, while woods and hillsides\r\nstill lack foliage to break his gust's rude force. Pliny declared\r\nthat only the wind could open anemones! Another legend utilized\r\nby countless poets pictures Venus wandering through the forests\r\ngrief-stricken over the death of her youthful lover.\r\n\r\n    \"Alas, the Paphian! fair Adonis slain!\r\n     Tears plenteous as his blood she pours amain;\r\n     But gentle flowers are born and bloom around\r\n     From every drop that falls upon the ground:\r\n     Where streams his blood, there blushing springs the rose;\r\n     And where a tear has dropped, a wind-flower blows.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, in reading the poets ancient and modern for references to\r\nthis favorite blossom, one realizes as never before the\r\nsignificance of an anthology, literally a flower gathering.\r\n\r\nBut it is chiefly the European anemone that is extolled by the\r\npoets. Nevertheless our more slender, fragile, paler-leaved, and\r\nsmaller-flowered species, known, strange to say, by the same\r\nscientific name, possesses the greater charm. Doctors, with more\r\nprosaic eyes than the poets, find acrid and dangerous juices in\r\nthe anemone and its kin. Certain European peasants will run past\r\na colony of these pure innocent blossoms in the belief that the\r\nvery air is tainted by them. Yet the Romans ceremonially picked\r\nthe first anemone of the year, with an incantation supposed to\r\nguard them against fever. The identical plant that blooms in our\r\nwoods, which may be found also in Asia, is planted on graves by\r\nthe Chinese, who call it the \"death flower.\"\r\n\r\nTo leave legend and folk lore, the practical scientist sees in\r\nthe anemone, trembling and bending before the wind, a perfect\r\nadaptation to its environment. Anchored in the light soil by a\r\nhorizontal rootstock; furnished with a stem so slender and\r\npliable no blast can break it; its pretty leaves whorled where\r\nthey form a background to set off the fragile beauty of the\r\nsolitary flower above them; a corolla economically dispensed\r\nwith, since the white sepals are made to do the advertising for\r\ninsects; the slightly nodding attitude of the blossom in cloudy\r\nweather, that the stigmas may be in the line of the fall of\r\npollen jarred out by the wind in case visitors seeking pollen\r\nfail to bring any from other anemones -  all these features teach\r\nthat every plant is what it is for excellent reasons of its own;\r\nthat it is a sentient being, not to be admired for superficial\r\nbeauty merely, but also for those same traits which operate in\r\nthe human race, making it the most interesting of studies.\r\n\r\nNote the clusters of tuberous dahlia-like roots, the whorl of\r\nthin three-lobed rounded leaflets on long, fine petioles\r\nimmediately below the smaller pure white or pinkish flowers\r\nusually growing in loose clusters, to distinguish the more common\r\nRUE-ANEMONE (Syndesmon thalictroides - Thalictrum anemonoides of\r\nGray) from its cousin the solitary flowered wood or true anemone.\r\nGenerally there are three blossoms of the rue-anemone to a\r\ncluster, the central one opening first, the side ones only after\r\nit has developed its stamens and pistils to prolong the season of\r\nbloom and encourage cross-pollination by insects. In the eastern\r\nhalf of the United States, and less abundantly in Canada, these\r\nare among the most familiar spring wild flowers. Pick them and\r\nthey soon wilt miserably; lift the plants early, with a good ball\r\nof soil about the roots, and they will unfold their fragile\r\nblossoms indoors, bringing with them something of the unspeakable\r\ncharm of their native woods and hillsides just waking into life.\r\n\r\nThe TALL or SUMMER ANEMONE (A. Virginiana), called also\r\nTHIMBLE-WEED from its oblong, thimble-like fruit-head, bears\r\nsolitary, inconspicuous greenish or white flowers, often over an\r\ninch across, and generally with five rounded sepals, on erect,\r\nlong stalks from June to August. Contrasted with the dainty\r\ntremulous little spring anemones, it is a rather coarse, stiff,\r\nhairy plant two or three feet tall. Its preference is for\r\nwoodlands, whereas another summer bloomer, the LONG-FRUITED\r\nANEMONE (A. cylindrica), a smaller, silky-hairy plant often\r\nconfused with it, chooses open places, fields, and roadsides. The\r\nleaves of the thimble-weed, which are set in a whorl high up on\r\nthe stem, and also spring from the root, after the true anemone\r\nfashion, are long petioled, three-parted, the divisions variously\r\ncut, lobed, and saw-edged. The flower-stalks which spring from\r\nthis whorl continue to rise throughout the summer. The first, or\r\nmiddle of these peduncles, lacks leaves; later ones bear two\r\nleaves in the middle, from which more flower-stalks arise, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGIN'S BOWER; VIRGINIA CLEMATIS; TRAVELLER'S JOY; OLD MAN'S\r\nBEARD\r\n  (Clematis Virginiana)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White and greenish, about 1 in. across or less, in\r\nloose clusters from the axils. Calyx of 4 or 5 petal-like sepals;\r\nno petals; stamens and pistils numerous, of indefinite number;\r\nthe staminate and pistillate flowers on separate plants; the\r\nstyles feathery, and over 1 in. long in fruit. Stem: Climbing,\r\nslightly woody. Leaves: Opposite, slender petioled, divided into\r\n3 pointed and widely toothed or lobed leaflets.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Climbing over woodland borders, thickets,\r\nroadside shrubbery, fences, and walls; rich, moist soil.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Georgia and Kansas northward less common beyond\r\nthe Canadian border.\r\n\r\nFleecy white clusters of wild clematis, festooning woodland and\r\nroadside thickets, vary so much in size and attractiveness that\r\none cannot but investigate the reason. Examination shows that\r\ncomparatively few of the flowers are perfect, that is, few\r\ncontain both stamens and pistils; the great majority are either\r\nmale - the more showy ones - or female - the ones so conspicuous\r\nin fruit - and, like Quakers in meeting, the sexes are divided.\r\nThe plant that bears staminate blossoms produces none that are\r\npistillate, and vice versa - another marvelous protection against\r\nthat horror of the floral race, self-fertilization, and a case of\r\nabsolute dependence on insect help to perpetuate the race. Since\r\nthe clematis blooms while insect life is at its height, and after\r\nmost, if not all, of the Ranunculaceae have withdrawn from the\r\ncompetition for trade; moreover, since its white color, so\r\nconspicuous in shady retreats, and its accessible nectar attract\r\nhosts of flies and the small, short-tongued bees chiefly, that\r\nare compelled to work for it by transferring pollen while they\r\nfeed, it goes without saying that the vine is a winner in life's\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin, who made so many interesting studies of the power\r\nof movement in various plants, devoted special attention to the\r\nclematis clan, of which about one hundred species exist but,\r\nalas! none to our traveller's joy, that flings out the right hand\r\nof good fellowship to every twig within reach, winds about the\r\nsapling in brotherly embrace, drapes a festoon of flowers from\r\nshrub to shrub, hooks even its sensitive leafstalks over any\r\navailable support as it clambers and riots on its lovely way. By\r\nrubbing the footstalk of a young leaf with a twig a few times on\r\nany side, Darwin found a clematis leaf would bend to that side in\r\nthe course of a few hours, but return to the straight again if\r\nnothing remained on which to hook itself. \"To show how sensitive\r\nthe young petioles are,\" he wrote, \"I may mention that I just\r\ntouched the undersides of two with a little watercolor which,\r\nwhen dry, formed an excessively thin and minute crust but this\r\nsufficed in twenty-four hours to cause both to bend downwards.\"\r\n\r\nIn early autumn, when the long, silvery, decorative plumes\r\nattached to a ball of seeds form feathery, hoary masses even more\r\nfascinating than the flower clusters, the name of old man's beard\r\nis most suggestive. These seeds never open, but, when ripe, each\r\nis borne on the autumn gales, to sink into the first moist,\r\nspringy resting place.\r\n\r\nThe English counterpart of our virgin's bower is fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALL MEADOW-RUE\r\n  (Thalictrum polyganum; T. Cornuti of Gray)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish white, the calyx of 4 or 5 sepals, falling\r\nearly; no petals; numerous white, thread-like, green-tipped\r\nstamens, spreading in feathery tufts, borne in large, loose,\r\ncompound terminal clusters 1 ft. long or more. Stem: Stout,\r\nerect, 3 to 11 ft. high, leafy, branching above. Leaves: Arranged\r\nin threes, compounded of various shaped leaflets, the lobes\r\npointed or rounded, dark above, paler below.\r\nPreferred Habitat- Open sunny swamps, beside sluggish water, low\r\nmeadows.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to Florida, westward to Ohio.\r\n\r\nMasses of these soft, feathery flowers, towering above the ranker\r\ngrowth of midsummer, possess an unseasonable, ethereal, chaste,\r\nspring-like beauty. On some plants the flowers are white and\r\nexquisite; others, again, are dull and coarser. Why is this?\r\nBecause these are what botanists term polygamous flowers, i.e.,\r\nsome of them are perfect, containing both stamens and pistils;\r\nsome are male only others, again, are female. Naturally an\r\ninsect, like ourselves, is first attracted to the more beautiful\r\nmale blossoms, the pollen bearers, and of course it transfers the\r\nvitalizing dust to the dull pistillate flowers visited later. But\r\nthe meadow-rue, which produces a superabundance of very light,\r\ndry pollen, easily blown by the wind, is often fertilized through\r\nthat agent also, just as grasses, plantains, sedges, birches,\r\noaks, pines, and all cone-bearing trees are. As might be\r\nexpected, a plant which has not yet ascended the evolutionary\r\nscale high enough to economize its pollen by making insects carry\r\nit invariably, overtops surrounding vegetation to take advantage\r\nof every breeze that blows.\r\n\r\nThe EARLY MEADOW-RUE (T. dioicum), found blooming in open, rocky\r\nwoods during April and May, from Alabama northward to Labrador,\r\nand westward to Missouri, grows only one or two feet high, and,\r\nlike its tall sister, bears fleecy, greenish-white flowers, the\r\nstaminate and the pistillate ones on different plants. These\r\nproduce no nectar; they offer no showy corolla advertisement to\r\ncatch the eye of passing insects; yet so abundant is the dry\r\npollen produced by the male blossoms that insects which come to\r\nfeed on it must occasionally transfer some, albeit this primitive\r\ngenus still depends largely on the wind. Not its flower, but the\r\nexquisite foliage resembling sprays of a robust maidenhair fern,\r\nis this meadow-rue's chief charm.\r\n\r\nThe PURPLISH MEADOW-RUE (T. purpurascens), so like the tall\r\nspecies in general characteristics that one cannot tell the dried\r\nand pressed specimens of these variable plants apart, is easily\r\nnamed afield by the purplish tinge of its green polygamous\r\nflowers. Often its stems show color also. Sometimes, not always,\r\nthe plant is downy, and the comparatively thick leaflets, which\r\nare dark green above, are waxy beneath. We look for this\r\nmeadow-rue in copses and woodlands from Northern Canada to\r\nFlorida, and far westward after the early meadow-rue has\r\nflowered, but before the tall one spreads its fleecy panicles.\r\nQuite as decorative as the flower clusters are the compound\r\nseed-bearing stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIN-LEAF; RHEUMATISM ROOT\r\n  (Jeffersonia diphylla)  Barberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, 1 in. broad, solitary, on a naked scape about 7\r\nin. high in flower, more than twice as tall in fruit. Calyx of 4\r\npetal-like sepals falling early; 8 longer, flat, oblong petals; 8\r\nstamens; 1 pistil. Leaves: From the root, long-petioled, rounded,\r\npalmately veined, cleft into 2 divisions. Fruit: A leathery,\r\nmany-seeded capsule, slit horizontally.\r\nPreferred habitat - Rich shady woods.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - New York to Virginia, west to Ontario and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nLike many little darkies in the United States, this low plant was\r\nnamed for Thomas Jefferson. One suspects from a glance at its\r\nsolitary white flower and deeply divided leaves that it is not\r\nfar removed from the May apple, which is characterized by even\r\ngreater Jeffersonian simplicity of habit, although separated into\r\nanother genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY APPLE; HOG APPLE; MANDRAKE; WILD LEMON\r\n  (Podophyllum peltatum)  Barberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, solitary, large, unpleasantly scented, nodding\r\nfrom the fork between a pair of terminal leaves. Calyx of 6\r\nshort-lived sepals; 6 to 9 rounded, flat petals stamens as many\r\nas petals or (usually) twice as many; 1 pistil, with a thick\r\nstigma. Stem: 1 to 1 1/2 ft. high, from a long, running\r\nrootstock. Leaves: Of flowerless stems (from separate\r\nroot-stock), solitary, on a long petiole from base, nearly 1 ft.\r\nacross, rounded, centrally peltate, umbrella fashion, 5 to 7\r\nlobed, the lobes 2-cleft, dark above, light green below. Leaves\r\nof flowering stem 1 to 3, usually a pair, similar to others, but\r\nsmaller. Fruit: A fleshy, yellowish, egg-shaped, many-seeded\r\nfruit about 2 in. long.\r\nPreferred habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico, westward to\r\nMinnesota and Texas.\r\n\r\nIn giving this plant its abridged scientific name, Linnaeus\r\nseemed to see in its leaves a resemblance to a duck's foot\r\n(Anapodophyllum) but equally imaginative American children call\r\nthem green umbrellas, and declare they unfurl only during April\r\nshowers. In July, a sweetly mawkish, many-seeded fruit,\r\nresembling a yellow egg-tomato, delights the uncritical palates\r\nof little people, who should be warned, however, against putting\r\nany other part of this poisonous, drastic plant in their mouths.\r\nPhysicians best know its uses. Dr. Asa Gray's statement about the\r\nharmless fruit \"eaten by pigs and boys\" aroused William Hamilton\r\nGibson, who had happy memories of his own youthful gorges on\r\nanything edible that grew. \"Think of it, boys!\" he wrote; \"and\r\nthink of what else he says of it: 'Ovary ovoid, stigma sessile,\r\nundulate, seeds covering the lateral placenta each enclosed in an\r\naril.' Now it may be safe for pigs and billygoats to tackle such\r\na compound as that, but we boys all like to know what we are\r\neating, and I cannot but feel that the public health officials of\r\nevery township should require this formula of Dr. Gray's to he\r\nprinted on every one of these big loaded pills, if that is what\r\nthey are really made of.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOODROOT; INDIAN PAINT; RED PUCCOON\r\n  (Sanguinaria Canadensis)  Poppy family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pure white, rarely pinkish, golden centered, 1 to 1 1/2\r\nin. across, solitary, at end of a smooth naked scape 6 to 14 in.\r\ntall. Calyx of 2 short-lived sepals; corolla of 8 to 12 oblong\r\npetals, early falling; stamens numerous; 1 short pistil composed\r\nof 2 carpels. Leaves: Rounded, deeply and palmately lobed, the 5\r\nto 9 lobes often cleft. Rootstock: Thick, several inches long,\r\nwith fibrous roots, and filled with orange-red juice.\r\nPreferred habitat - Rich woods and borders; low hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nSnugly protected in a papery sheath enfolding a silvery-green\r\nleaf-cloak, the solitary erect bud slowly rises from its embrace,\r\nsheds its sepals, expands into an immaculate golden-centered\r\nblossom that, poppy-like, offers but a glimpse of its fleeting\r\nloveliness ere it drops its snow-white petals and is gone. But\r\nwere the flowers less ephemeral, were we always certain of\r\nhitting upon the very time its colonies are starring the\r\nwoodland, would it have so great a charm? Here to-day, if there\r\ncomes a sudden burst of warm sunshine; gone tomorrow, if the\r\nspring winds, rushing through the nearly leafless woods, are too\r\nrude to the fragile petals - no blossom has a more evanescent\r\nbeauty, none is more lovely. After its charms have been\r\ndisplayed, up rises the circular leaf-cloak on its smooth reddish\r\npetiole, unrolls, and at length overtops the narrow, oblong\r\nseed-vessel. Wound the plant in any part, and there flows an\r\norange-red juice, which old-fashioned mothers used to drop on\r\nlumps of sugar and administer when their children had coughs and\r\ncolds. As this fluid stains whatever it touches - hence its value\r\nto the Indians as a war-paint - one should be careful in picking\r\nthe flower. It has no value for cutting, of course; but in some\r\nrich, shady corner of the garden, a clump of the plants will\r\nthrive and bring a suggestive picture of the spring woods to our\r\nvery doors. It will be noticed that plants having thick\r\nrootstocks, corms, and bulbs, which store up food during the\r\nwinter, like the irises, Solomon's seals, bloodroot, adder's\r\ntongue, and crocuses, are prepared to rush into blossom far\r\nearlier in spring than fibrous-rooted species that must\r\naccumulate nourishment after the season has opened.\r\n\r\nA newly opened flower which is in the female stage has its\r\nanthers tightly closed, and pollen must therefore be carried from\r\ndistinct plants by the short-tongued bees and flies out\r\ncollecting it. No nectar rewards their search, although they\r\nalight on young blossoms in the expectation of finding some food,\r\nand so cross-fertilize them. Late in the afternoon the petals,\r\nwhich have been in a showy horizontal position during the day,\r\nrise to the perpendicular before closing to protect the flower's\r\nprecious contents for the morrow's visitors. In the blossom's\r\nstaminate stage, abundant pollen is collected by the hive bees\r\nchiefly; but, those of the Halictus tribe, the mining bees and\r\nthe Syrphidae flies also pay profitable visits. Inasmuch as the\r\nhive bee is a naturalized foreigner, not a native, the bloodroot\r\nprobably depended upon the other little bees to fertilize it\r\nbefore her arrival. For ages this bee's small relatives and the\r\nflowers they depended upon developed side by side, adapting\r\nthemselves to each other's wants. Now along comes an immigrant\r\nand profits by their centuries of effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCHMAN'S BREECHES; WHITE HEARTS; SOLDIER'S CAP; EAR-DROPS\r\n  (Bicuculla Cucullaria; Dicentra cucullaria of Gray)  Poppy\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, tipped with yellow, nodding in a 1-sided raceme.\r\nTwo scale-like sepals; corolla of 4 petals, in 2 pairs, somewhat\r\ncohering into a heart-shaped, flattened, irregular flower, the\r\nouter pair of petals extended into 2 widely spread spurs, the\r\nsmall inner petals united above; 6 stamens in 2 sets; style\r\nslender, with a 2-lobed stigma. Scape: 5 to 10 in. high, smooth,\r\nfrom a bulbous root. Leaves: Finely cut, thrice compound, pale\r\nbeneath, on slender petioles, all from base\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, rocky woods.\r\nFlowering Season- - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Carolinas, west to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nRich leaf mould, accumulated between crevices of rock, makes the\r\nideal home of this delicate, yet striking, flower, coarse-named,\r\nbut refined in all its parts. Consistent with the dainty,\r\nheart-shaped blossoms that hang trembling along the slender stem\r\nlike pendants from a lady's ear, are the finely dissected,\r\nlace-like leaves, the whole plant repudiating by its femininity\r\nits most popular name. It was Thoreau who observed that only\r\nthose plants which require but little light, and can stand the\r\ndrip of trees, prefer to dwell in the woods - plants which have\r\ncommonly more beauty in their leaves than in their pale and\r\nalmost colorless blossoms. Certainly few woodland dwellers have\r\nmore delicately beautiful foliage than the fumitory tribe.\r\n\r\nOwing to this flower's early season of bloom and to the depth of\r\nits spurs, in which nectar is secreted by two long processes of\r\nthe middle stamens, only the long-tongued female bumblebees then\r\nflying are implied by its curious formation. Two canals leading\r\nto the sweets invite the visitor to thrust in her tongue, and as\r\nshe hangs from the white heart and presses forward to drain the\r\nluscious drops, first on one side, then on the other, her hairy\r\nunderside necessarily comes in contact with the pollen of younger\r\nflowers and - with the later maturing stigmas of older ones, to\r\nwhich she carries it later. But, as might be expected, this\r\nintelligent bee occasionally nips holes through the spurs of the\r\nflower that makes dining so difficult for her - holes that lesser\r\nfry are not slow to investigate.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Rev. Alexander S. Wilson, bumblebees make holes\r\nwith jagged edges; wasps make clean-cut, circular openings; and\r\nthe carpenter bees cut slits, through which they steal nectar\r\nfrom deep flowers. Who has tested this statement about the guilty\r\nlittle pilferers on our side of the Atlantic?\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUIRREL CORN\r\n  (Bicuculla Canadensis)  Poppy family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Irregular, greenish white tinged with rose, slightly\r\nfragrant, heart-shaped, with 2 short rounded spurs, over 1/2 in.\r\nlong, nodding on a slender scape. Calyx of 2 scale-like sepals;\r\ncorolla heart-shaped at base, consisting of 4 petals in 2 united\r\npairs, a prominent crest on tips of inner ones; 6 stamens in 2\r\nsets; style with 2-lobed stigma. Scape: Smooth, 6 to 12 in. high,\r\nthe rootstock bearing many small, round, yellow tubers like\r\nkernels of corn. Leaves: All from root, delicate, compounded of 3\r\nvery finely dissected divisions.\r\nPrferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Virginia, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nAny one familiar with the Bleeding-heart (B. eximia) of old-\r\nfashioned gardens, found growing wild in the Alleghanies, and\r\nwith the exquisite White Mountain Fringe (Adlumia fungosa) often\r\nbrought from the woods to be planted over shady trellises, or\r\nwith the Dutchman's breeches, need not be told that the little\r\nsquirrel corn is next of kin or far removed from the pink\r\ncorydalis. It is not until we dig up the plant and look at its\r\nroots that we see why it received its name. A delicious perfume\r\nlike hyacinths, only fainter and subtler, rises from the dainty\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBULBOUS or SPRING CRESS\r\n\r\n  (Cardamine bulbosa; C. rhomboidea of Gray)  Mustard family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, about 1/2 in. across, clustered in a simple\r\nterminal raceme. Calyx of four sepals; corolla of 4 petals in\r\nform of a cross; 6 stamens; 1 compound pistil with a 2-lobed\r\nstyle. Stem: 6 to 18 in. high, erect, smooth, from a tuberous\r\nbase. Leaves: Basal ones rounded, on long petioles; upper leaves\r\noblong or lance-shaped, toothed or entire-edged, short petioled\r\nor seated on stem. Fruit: Very slender, erect pods about 1 in.\r\nlong, tapering at each end, tipped with a slender style, the\r\nstigma prominent; 1 row of seeds in each cell, the pods rapidly\r\nfollowing flowers up the stem and opening suddenly.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet meadows, low ground, near springs.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, west to Minnesota and\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nPretty masses of this flower, that look like borders of garden\r\ncandy-tuft planted beside some trickling brook, are visited and\r\ncross-fertilized by small bees, of the Andrena and Halictus clans\r\nchiefly. How well the butterflies understand scientific\r\nclassification with instinct for their sure guide! The\r\ncaterpillar of that exquisite little white butterfly with a dark\r\nyellow triangular spot across his wings, the fulcate orange-tip\r\n(Euchloe genutia), a first-cousin of the common small white\r\ncabbage butterfly, feeds on this plant and several of its kin,\r\nknowing better than if the books had told it so, that all belong\r\nto the same cross-bearing family. The watery, biting juice in the\r\nCruciferae - the radishes, nasturtiums, cabbage, peppergrass,\r\nwater-cress, mustards, and horseradish - by no means protects\r\nthem from preying worms and caterpillars; but ants, the worst\r\npilferers of nectar extant, let them alone. Authorities declare\r\nthat the chloride of potassium and iodine these plants contain\r\nincrease their food value to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe PURPLE CRESS (C. purpurea), formerly counted a mere variety\r\nof the preceding, has now been ranked as a distinct species. Its\r\npurplish-pink flowers, found about cold, springy places\r\nnorthward, appear two or three weeks earlier than those of the\r\nwhite spring cress.\\\r\nThe MEADOW BITTER-CRESS (or CROSS), LADIES' SMOCK, OR\r\nCUCKOO-FLOWER (C. pratensis), an immigrant from Europe and Asia\r\nnow naturalized here north of New Jersey from coast to coast,\r\nlifts its larger and more showy white or purplish-pink flowers,\r\nthat stand well out from the stem on slender pedicels, in loose\r\nclusters above watery low-lying ground in April and May.\r\n\r\n    \"Lady-smocks all silver white\"\r\n\r\nnow paint our meadows with delight, as they do Shakespeare's\r\nEngland; but ours have quite frequently a decided pink tinge. The\r\nlight and graceful growth, and the pinnately divided foliage,\r\ngive the plant a special charm. In olden times, when it was\r\ncounted a valuable remedy in hysteria and epilepsy, Linnaeus gave\r\nit its generic name Cardamine from two Greek words signifying\r\nheart-strengthening.\r\n\r\nMore bees, flies, butterflies, and other insects visit the\r\nladies' smock than perhaps any other crucifer found here, since\r\nit has showy flowers and so much nectar the long-persistent\r\nsepals require little pouches to hold it. No wonder this plant\r\nhas triumphantly marched around the world, leaving its relatives\r\nthat take less pains to woo and work insects far behind in the\r\nrace. Owing to a partial revolution of the tall stamens away from\r\nthe stigmas, a visitor in sipping nectar must brush off some\r\npollen on his head or tongue, although in stormy weather, when\r\nthe movement of the stamens is incomplete, self-pollination may\r\noccasionally occur, according to Muller.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO-LEAVED TOOTHWORT; CRINKLE-ROOT\r\n  (Dentaria diphylla)  Mustard family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, about 1/2 in. across, in a terminal loose\r\ncluster, the formation of each similar to that of bulbous cress.\r\nStem: 8 to 15 in. high. Root stock: Long, crinkled, toothed,\r\nfleshy, crisp, edible. Leaves: 2, opposite or nearly so, on the\r\nstem, compounded of 3 ovate and toothed leaflets; also larger,\r\nbroader leaves on larger petioles from the rootstock. Fruit:\r\nFlat, lance-shaped pods, 1 in. long or over, tipped with the\r\nslender style.\r\nPerferred Habitat - Rich leaf mould in woods, sometimes in\r\nthickets and meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Carolinas, west to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nClusters of these pretty, white, cross-shaped flowers, found near\r\nthe bloodroot, claytonia, anemones, and a host of other delicate\r\nspring blossoms, enter into a short but fierce competition with\r\nthem for the visits of the small Andrena and Halictus bees then\r\nflying to collect nectar and pollen for a generation still\r\nunborn. In tunnels underground, or in soft, partially decayed\r\nwood, each busy little mother places the pellets of pollen and\r\nnectar paste, then when her eggs have been laid on the food\r\nsupply in separate nurseries and sealed up, she dies from\r\nexhaustion, leaving her grub progeny to eat its way through the\r\nlarva into the chrysalis state, and finally into that of a winged\r\nbee that flies away to liberty. These are the little bees so\r\nconstantly seen about willow catkins.\r\n\r\nCountry children, on their way to school through the woods, often\r\ndig up the curious, long crisp root of the toothwort, which\r\ntastes much like the water-cress, to eat with their sandwiches at\r\nthe noon recess. Then, as they examine the little pointed\r\nprojections on the rootstock, they see why the plant received its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nAnother toothwort found throughout a similar range, the\r\nCUT-LEAVED TOOTHWORT, or PEPPER-ROOT (D. laciniata), has its\r\nequally edible rootstock scarcely toothed, but rather constricted\r\nin places, giving its little tubers the appearance of beads\r\nstrung into a necklace. Its white or pale purplish-pink\r\ncross-shaped flowers, loosely clustered at the end of an\r\nunbranched stem, rise by preference above moist ground in rich\r\nwoods, often beside a spring, from April to June - a longer\r\nseason for wooing and working its insect friends than the\r\ntwo-leaved toothwort has attained to - hence it is the commoner\r\nplant. Instead of having two leaves on its stem, this species\r\nspreads whorls of three leaves, thrice divided, almost to the\r\nbase, the divisions toothed or lobed, and the side ones sometimes\r\ndeeply cleft. The larger, longer petioled leaves that rise\r\ndirectly from the rootstock have scarcely developed at flowering\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEPHERD'S PURSE; MOTHER'S HEART\r\n  (Bursa Bursa-pastoris; Capsella Bursa-pastoris of Gray)\r\nMustard family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, in a long loose raceme, followed by\r\ntriangular and notched (somewhat heart-shaped) pods, the valves\r\nboat-shaped and keeled. Sepals and petals 4; stamens 6; 1 pistil.\r\nStem: 6 to 18 in. high, from a deep root. Leaves: Forming a\r\nrosette at base, 2 to 5 in. long, more or less cut (pinnatifid),\r\na few pointed, arrow-shaped leaves also scattered along stem and\r\npartly clasping it.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, roadsides, waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - Almost throughout the year.\r\nDistribution - Over nearly all parts of the earth.\r\n\r\n>From Europe this little low plant found its way, to become the\r\ncommonest of our weeds, so completing its march around the globe.\r\nAt a glance one knows it to be related to the alyssum and\r\ncandy-tuft of our gardens, albeit a poor relation in spite of its\r\nvaunted purses - the tiny, heart-shaped seed-pods that so rapidly\r\nsucceed the flowers. What is the secret of its successful march\r\nover the face of the earth? Like the equally triumphant\r\nchickweed, it is easily satisfied with unoccupied wasteland, it\r\navoids the fiercest competition for insect trade by prolonging\r\nits season of bloom far beyond that of any native flower, for\r\nthere is not a month in the year when one may not find it even in\r\nNew England in sheltered places. Having vanquished in the fiercer\r\nstruggle for survival in the Old World, it finds life here one\r\nlong holiday; and finally, by clustering a large number of\r\nrelatively small flowers together, it attracts the insects that\r\nthis method of arrangement pleases best, the flies (Syrphidae and\r\nMuscidae) which cross-fertilize it in fine weather, transferring\r\nenough pollen from plant to plant to save the species from\r\ndegeneracy through close inbreeding. However, the long stamens\r\nstanding on a level with the stigma are well calculated to\r\nself-pollenize the flowers, the flies failing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERNAL WHITLOW-GRASS\r\n  (Draba verna)  Mustard family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, white, distant, growing on numerous scapes\r\n1 to 5 in. high; in formation each flower is similar to all the\r\nmustards, except that the 4 petals are 2-cleft, destroying the\r\ncross-like effect. Leaves: 1/2 to 1 in. long, in a tuft or\r\nrosette on the ground, oblong or spatulate, covered with stiff\r\nhairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste lands, sandy fields, and roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - February-May.\r\nDistribution - Throughout our area; naturalized from Europe and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nAn insignificantly small plant, too common, however, to be wholly\r\nignored. Although each tiny flower secretes four drops of nectar\r\nbetween the bases of the short stamens and the long ones next\r\nthem, it would be unreasonable to depend wholly upon insects to\r\ncarry pollen, since there is so little else to attract them.\r\nTherefore the anthers of the four long stamens regularly shed\r\ndirectly upon the stigma below them, leaving to the few visitors,\r\nthe small bees chiefly, the transferring from flower to flower of\r\npollen from the two short stamens which must be touched if they\r\nwould reach the nectar. In spite of the persistency with which\r\nthese little blossoms fertilize themselves, they certainly\r\nincrease at a prodigious rate; but how much larger and more\r\nbeautiful might they not be if they possessed more executive\r\nability\r\n\r\nA similar but larger plant, with its hairy leaves not only tufted\r\nat the base, but also alternating up the stiff stem, is the HAIRY\r\nROCK-CRESS (Arabis hirsuta), whose white or greenish flowers,\r\ngrowing in racemes after the usual mustard fashion, are quickly\r\nfollowed by very narrow, flattened pods two inches long or less.\r\nAround the world this small traveler has likewise found its way,\r\nchoosing rocky places to display its insignificant flowers\r\nthroughout the entire summer to such small bees and flies as seek\r\nthe nectar in its two tiny glands. It is not to be confused with\r\nthe saxifrage or stone-breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND-LEAVED SUNDEW; DEW-PLANT\r\n  (Drosera rotundifolia)  Sundew family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, growing in a 1-sided, curved raceme of\r\nbuds chiefly. Calyx usually 5-parted; usually 5 petals, and as\r\nmany stamens as petals; usually 3 styles, but 2-cleft, thus\r\nappearing to be twice as many. Scape: 4 to 10 in. high. Leaves:\r\nGrowing in an open rosette on the ground; round or broader,\r\nclothed with reddish bristly hairs tipped with purple glands, and\r\nnarrowed into long, flat, hairy petioles; young leaves curled\r\nlike fern fronds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Bogs, sandy and sunny marshes.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico and westward. From\r\nAlaska to California. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nHere is a bloodthirsty little miscreant that lives by reversing\r\nthe natural order of higher forms of life preying upon lower\r\nones, an anomaly in that the vegetable actually eats the animal!\r\nThe dogbane, as we have seen, simply catches the flies that dare\r\ntrespass upon the butterflies' preserves, for excellent reasons\r\nof its own; the Silenes and phloxes, among others, spread their\r\ncalices with a sticky gum that acts as limed twigs do to birds,\r\nin order to guard the nectar secreted for flying benefactors from\r\npilfering ants; the honey bee being an imported, not a native,\r\ninsect, and therefore not perfectly adapted to the milkweed,\r\noccasionally gets entrapped by it; the big bumblebee is sometimes\r\nfatally imprisoned in the moccasin flower's gorgeous tomb - the\r\npunishment of insects that do not benefit the flowers is infinite\r\nin its variety. But the local Venus's flytrap (Dionaea\r\nmuscipula), gathered only from the low savannas in North Carolina\r\nto entertain the owners of hothouses as it promptly closes the\r\ncrushing trap at the end of its sensitive leaves over a hapless\r\nfly, and the common sundew that tinges the peat-bogs of three\r\ncontinents with its little reddish leaves, belong to a distinct\r\nclass of carnivorous plants which actually masticate their animal\r\nfood, depending upon it for nourishment as men do upon cattle\r\nslaughtered in an abattoir. Darwin's luminous account of these\r\ntwo species alone, which occupies over three hundred absorbingly\r\ninteresting pages of his \"Insectivorous Plants\" should be read by\r\neveryone interested in these freaks of nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we go to some sunny cranberry bog to look for these sundews,\r\nnothing could be more innocent looking than the tiny plant, its\r\nnodding raceme of buds, usually with only a solitary little\r\nblossom (that opens only in the sunshine) at the top of the\r\ncurve, its leaves glistening with what looks like dew, though the\r\nmidsummer sun may be high in the heavens. A little fly or gnat,\r\nattracted by the bright jewels, alights on a leaf only to find\r\nthat the clear drops, more sticky than honey, instantly glue his\r\nfeet, that the pretty reddish hairs about him act like tentacles,\r\nreaching inward, to imprison him within their slowly closing\r\nembrace. Here is one of the horrors of the Inquisition operating\r\nin this land of liberty before our very eyes! Excited by the\r\nstruggles of the victim, the sensitive hairs close only the\r\nfaster, working on the same principle that a vine's tendrils do\r\nwhen they come in contact with a trellis. More of the sticky\r\nfluid pours upon the hapless fly, plastering over his legs and\r\nwings and the pores on his body through which he draws his\r\nbreath. Slowly, surely, the leaf rolls inward, making a temporary\r\nstomach; the cruel hairs bind, the glue suffocates and holds him\r\nfast. Death alone releases him. And now the leafs orgy begins:\r\nmoistening the fly with a fresh peptic fluid, which helps in the\r\nassimilation, the plant proceeds to digest its food. Curiously\r\nenough, chemical analysis proves that this sundew secretes a\r\ncomplex fluid corresponding almost exactly to the gastric juice\r\nin the stomach of animals.\r\n\r\nDarwin, who fed these leaves with various articles, found that\r\nthey could dissolve matter out of pollen, seeds, grass, etc.; yet\r\nwithout a human caterer, how could a leaf turn vegetarian? When a\r\nbit of any undesirable substance, such as chalk or wood, was\r\nplaced on the hairs and excited them, they might embrace it\r\ntemporarily; but as soon as the mistake was discovered, it would\r\nbe dropped! He also poisoned the plants by administering acids,\r\nand gave them fatal attacks of indigestion by overfeeding them\r\nwith bits of raw beef!\r\n\r\nOther common sundews, the SPATULATE-LEAVED SUNDEW (D. intermedia)\r\nand the THREAD-LEAVED SUNDEW (D. filiformis) whose purplish-pink\r\nflowers are reared above wet sand along the coast, possess\r\ncontrivances similar to the round-leaved plant's to pursue their\r\ngruesome business. Why should these vegetables turn carnivorous?\r\nDoubtless because the soil in which they grow can supply little\r\nor no nitrogen. Very small roots testify to the small use they\r\nserve. The water sucked up through them from the bog aids in the\r\nmanufacture of the fluid so freely exuded by the bristly glands,\r\nbut nitrogen must be obtained by other means, even at the\r\nsacrifice of insect victims.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SAXIFRAGE\r\n  (Saxifraga Virginiensis)  Saxifrage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, small, numerous, perfect, spreading into a loose\r\npanicle. Calyx 5-lobed; 5 petals; 10 stamens; 1 pistil with 2\r\nstyles. Scape: 4 to 12 in. high, naked, sticky-hairy. Leaves:\r\nClustered at the base, rather thick, obovate, toothed, and\r\nnarrowed into spatulate-margined petioles. Fruit: Widely spread,\r\npurplish-brown pods.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky woodlands, hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Georgia, and westward a thousand\r\nmiles or more.\r\n\r\nRooted in clefts of rock that, therefore, appears to be broken by\r\nthis vigorous plant, the saxifrage shows rosettes of fresh green\r\nleaves in earliest spring, and soon whitens with its blossoms the\r\nmost forbidding niches. (Saxum = a rock; frango = 1 break.) At\r\nfirst a small ball of green buds nestles in the leafy tuffet,\r\nthen pushes upward on a bare scape, opening its tiny, white,\r\nfive-pointed star flowers as it ascends, until, having reached\r\nthe allotted height, it scatters them in spreading clusters that\r\nlast a fortnight. Again we see that, however insignificantly\r\nsmall nectar-bearing flowers may be, they are somehow protected\r\nfrom crawling pilferers; in this case by the commonly employed\r\nsticky hairs in which ants' feet become ensnared. As the anthers\r\nmature before the stigmas are ready to receive pollen, certainly\r\nthe flowers cannot afford to send empty away the benefactors on\r\nwhom the perpetuation of their race depends; and must prevent it\r\neven with the most heroic measures.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE MITERWORT; COOLWORT; FOAM-FLOWER; NANCY-OVER-THE-GROUND\r\n  (Tiarella cordifolia)  Saxifrage family.\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, small, feathery, borne in a close raceme at the\r\ntop of a scape 6 to 12 in. high. Calyx white, 9-lobed; 5 clawed\r\npetals; 10 stamens, long-exserted; 1 pistil with 2 styles.\r\nLeaves: Long-petioled from the rootstock or runners, rounded or\r\nbroadly heart-shaped, 3 to 7-lobed, toothed, often downy along\r\nveins beneath.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods, especially along\r\nmountains.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, and westward scarcely to\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nFuzzy, bright white foam-flowers are most conspicuous in the\r\nforest when seen against their unevenly colored leaves that\r\ncarpet the ground. A relative, the TRUE MITERWORT or BISHOP'S CAP\r\n(Mittella diphylla), with similar foliage, except that two\r\nopposite leaves may be found almost seated near the middle of its\r\nhairy stem, has its flowers rather distantly scattered on the\r\nraceme, and their fine petals deeply cut like fringe. Both\r\nspecies may be found in bloom at the same time, offering an\r\nopportunity for comparison to the confused novice. Now, tiarella,\r\nmeaning a little tiara, and mitella, a little miter, refer, of\r\ncourse, to the odd forms of their seed-cases; but all of us are\r\nnot gifted with the imaginative eyes of Linnaeus, who named the\r\nplants. Xenophon's assertion that the royal tiara or turban of\r\nthe Persians was encircled with a crown helps us no more to see\r\nwhat Linnaeus saw in the one case than the fact that the papal\r\nmiter is encircled by three crowns helps in the other. And as for\r\nthe lofty, two-peaked cap worn by bishops in the Roman Church, a\r\ndozen plants, with equal propriety, might be said to wear it.\r\n\r\nCAROLINA GRASS OF PARNASSUS\r\n  (Parnassia Caroliniana)  Saxifrage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Creamy white, delicately veined with greenish,\r\nsolitary, 1 in. broad or over, at the end of a scape 8 in. to 2\r\nft. high, 1 ovate leaf clasping it. Calyx deeply 5-lobed; corolla\r\nof 5 spreading, parallel veined petals; 5 fertile stamens\r\nalternating with them, and 3 stout imperfect stamens clustered at\r\nbase of each petal; 1 very short pistil with 4 stigmas. Leaves:\r\n>From the root, on long petioles, broadly oval or rounded,\r\nheart-shaped at base, rather thick.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet ground, low meadows, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Virginia, west to Iowa.\r\n\r\nWhat's in a name? Certainly our common grass of Parnassus, which\r\nis no grass at all, never starred the meadows round about the\r\nhome of the Muses, nor sought the steaming savannas of the\r\nCarolinas. The European counterpart (P. palustris), fabled to\r\nhave sprung up on Mount Parnassus, is at home here only in the\r\nCanadian border States and northward.\r\n\r\nAt first analysis one is puzzled by the clusters of filaments at\r\nthe base of each petal. Of what use are they? We have seen in the\r\ncase of the beard-tongue and the turtle-head that even imperfect\r\nstamens sometimes serve useful ends, or they would doubtless have\r\nbeen abolished. A fly or bee mistaking, as he well may, the\r\nabortive anthers for beads of nectar on this flower, alights on\r\none of the white petals, a convenient, spreading landing place;\r\nbut finding his mistake, and guided by the greenish lines, the\r\npathfinders to the true nectaries situated on the other side of\r\nthe curious fringy structures, he must, because of their\r\ntroublesome presence, climb over them into the center of the\r\nflower to suck its sweets from the point where he will dust\r\nhimself with pollen in young blossoms. Of course he will carry\r\nsome of their vitalizing powder to the late maturing stigmas of\r\nolder ones. Without the fringe of imperfect stamens, that serves\r\nas a harmless trellis easily climbed over, the visitor might\r\nstand on the petals and sip nectar without rendering any\r\nassistance in cross-fertilizing his entertainers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNINEBARK\r\n  (Opulaster opulifolius; Spiraea opulifolia of Gray)  Rose\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or pink, small, in numerous rounded terminal\r\nclusters to 2 in. broad. Calyx 5-lobed; 5 rounded petals inserted\r\nin its throat; 20 to 40 stamens; several pistils. Stem: Shrubby,\r\n3 to 10 ft. high, with long, recurved branches, the loose bark\r\npeeling off annually in thin strips. Leaves: Simple, heart-shaped\r\nor rounded, 3-lobed, toothed. Fruit: 3 to 5 smooth, shining,\r\nreddish, inflated, pointed pods.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky banks, riversides.\r\nFlowering Season - June.\r\nDistribution - Canada to Georgia, west to Kansas.\r\n\r\nWhether the nurserymen agree with Dr. Gray or not when he says\r\nthese balls of white flowers possess \"no beauty,\" the fact\r\nremains that numbers of the shrubs are sold for ornament,\r\nespecially a golden-leaved variety. But the charm certainly lies\r\nin their fruit. (Opulus = a wild cranberry tree.) When this is\r\nplentifully set at the ends of long branches that curve backward,\r\nand the bladder-like pods have taken on a rich purplish or\r\nreddish hue, the shrub is undeniably decorative. Even the old\r\nflowers, after they have had their pollen carried away by the\r\nsmall bees and flies, show a reddish tint on the ovaries which\r\ndeepens as the fruit forms; and Ludwig states that this is not\r\nonly to increase the conspicuousness of the shrubs, but to entice\r\nunbidden guests away from the younger flowers. Who will tell us\r\nwhy the old bark should loosen every year and the thin layers\r\nseparate into not nine, but dozens of ragged strips?\r\n\r\n\r\nMEADOW-SWEET; QUAKER LADY; QUEEN-OF-THE-MEADOW\r\n  (Spiraea salicifolia)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white or flesh pink, clustered in dense\r\npyramidal terminal panicles. Calyx 5 cleft; carolla of 5 rounded\r\npetals; stamens numerous; pistils 5 to 8. Stem: 2 to 4 ft. high,\r\nsimple or bushy, smooth, usually reddish. Leaves: Alternate, oval\r\nor oblong, saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low meadows, swamps, fence-rows, ditches.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Georgia, west to Rocky Mountains.\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\nFleecy white plumes of meadow-sweet, the \"spires of closely\r\nclustered bloom\" sung by Dora Read Goodale, are surely not\r\nfrequently found near dusty \"waysides scorched with barren heat,\"\r\neven in her Berkshires; their preference is for moister soil,\r\noften in the same habitat with a first cousin, the pink\r\nsteeple-bush. But plants, like humans, are capricious creatures.\r\nIf the meadow-sweet always elected to grow in damp ground whose\r\nrising mists would clog the pores of its leaves, doubtless they\r\nwould be protected with a woolly absorbent, as its cousins are.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as perfume serves as an attraction to the more highly\r\nspecialized, aesthetic insects, not required by the spiraeas, our\r\nmeadow-sweet has none, in spite of its misleading name. Small\r\nbees (especially Andrenidae), flies (Syrphidae), and beetles,\r\namong other visitors, come in great numbers, seeking the\r\naccessible pollen, and, in this case, nectar also, secreted in a\r\nconspicuous orange-colored disk. When a floret first opens, or\r\neven before, the already mature stigmas overtop the incurved,\r\nundeveloped stamens, so that any visitor dusted from other\r\nclusters cross-fertilizes it; but as the stigmas remain fresh\r\neven after the stamens have risen and shed their abundant pollen,\r\nit follows that in long-continued stormy weather, when few\r\ninsects are flying, the flowers fertilize themselves.\r\nSelf-fertilization with insect help must often occur in the\r\nflower's second stage. The fragrant yellowish-white ENGLISH\r\nMEADOW-SWEET (S. ulmaria), often cultivated in old-fashioned\r\ngardens here, has escaped locally.\r\n\r\nIn long, slender, forking spikes the GOAT'S-BEARD (Aruncus\r\nAruncus - Spiraea aruncus of Gray) lifts its graceful panicles of\r\nminute whitish flowers in May and June from three to seven feet\r\nabove the rich soil of its woodland home. The petioled, pinnate\r\nleaves are compounded of several leaflets like those on its\r\nrelative the rose-bush. From New York southward and westward to\r\nMissouri, also on the Pacific Coast to Alaska, is its range on\r\nthis Continent. Very many more beetles than any other visitors\r\ntransfer pollen from the staminate flowers on one plant to the\r\npistillate ones on another; other plants produce only perfect\r\nflowers - the reason different panicles vary so much in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAnother herbaceous perennial once counted a spiraea is the common\r\nINDIAN PHYSIC or BOWMAN'S-ROOT (Porteranthus trifoliatus -\r\nGillensia trifoliata of Gray) found blooming in the rich woods\r\nduring June and July from western New York southward and\r\nwestward. Two to four feet high, it displays its very loose,\r\npretty clusters of white or pale pink flowers, comparatively few\r\nin the whole panicle, each blossom measuring about a half inch\r\nacross and borne on a slender pedicel. A tubular, 5-toothed calyx\r\nhas the long slender petals inserted within. Owing to the depth\r\nand narrowness of the tube, the small, long-tongued bees cannot\r\nreach the nectar without dusting their heads with pollen from the\r\nanthers inserted in a ring around the entrance or leaving some on\r\nthe stigmas of other blossoms. Later, the five carpels make as\r\nmany hairy, awl-tipped little pods within the reddish cup. The\r\nleaves may be compounded of three oblong or ovate, saw-edged\r\nleaflets, or merely three-lobed, and with small stipules at their\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RED RASPBERRY\r\n  (Rubus strigosus)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, about 1/2 in. across, on slender, bristly\r\npedicels, in a loose cluster. Calyx deeply 5-parted, persistent\r\nin fruit; 5 erect, short-lived petals, about the length of the\r\nsepals; stamens numerous; carpels numerous, inserted on a convex\r\nspongy receptacle, and ripening into drupelets. Stem: 3 to 6 ft.\r\nhigh, shrubby, densely covered with bristles; older, woody stems\r\nwith rigid, hooked prickles. Leaves: Compounded of 3 to 5 ovate,\r\npointed, and irregularly saw-edged leaflets, downy beneath, on\r\nbristly petioles. Fruit: A light red, watery, tender,\r\nhigh-flavored, edible berry; ripe July-September.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, rocky hillsides, fence-rows,\r\nhedges.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Labrador to North Carolina, also in Rocky Mountain\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nWho but the bees and such small visitors care about the raspberry\r\nblossoms? Notwithstanding the nectar secreted in a fleshy ring\r\nfor their benefit, comparatively few insects enter the flowers,\r\nwhose small, erect petals imply no hospitable welcome.\r\nOccasionally a visitor laden with pollen from another plant\r\nalights in the center of a blossom, and leaves some on the\r\nstigmas in bending his head down between them and the stamens to\r\nreach the refreshment; but inasmuch as the erect petals allow no\r\nroom for the stamens to spread out and away from the stigmas, it\r\nfollows that self-fertilization very commonly occurs.\r\n\r\nOf course, men and children, bears and birds, are vastly more\r\ninterested in the delicious berries; men for the reason that\r\nseveral excellent market varieties, some white or pale red, the\r\nCuthbert and Hansall berries among others, owe their origin to\r\nthis hardy native. Many superior sorts derived from its European\r\ncounterpart (R. Idaeus) cannot well endure our rigorous northern\r\nclimate. As in the case of most berry-bearing species, the\r\nraspberry depends upon the birds to drop its undigested seeds\r\nover the country, that new colonies may arise under freer\r\nconditions. Indeed, one of the best places for the budding\r\nornithologist to take opera-glasses and notebook is to a\r\nraspberry patch early in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK RASPBERRY, BLACK CAP or SCOTCH CAP or THIMBLE-BERRY (R.\r\noccidentalis), common in such situations as the red raspberry\r\nchooses, but especially in burned-over districts from Virginia\r\nnorthward and westward, has very long, smooth, cane-like stems,\r\noften bending low until they root again at the tips. These are\r\nonly sparingly armed with small, hooked prickles, no bristles.\r\nThe flowers, which are similar to the preceding, but clustered\r\nmore compactly, are sparingly visited by insects; nevertheless\r\nwhen self-fertilized, as they usually are, abundant\r\npurplish-black berries, hollow like a thimble where they drop\r\nfrom the spongy receptacle, ripen in July. Numerous garden\r\nhybrids have been derived from this prolific species also. Indeed\r\nits offspring are the easiest raspberries to grow, since they\r\nform new plants at the tips of the branches, yet do not weaken\r\nthemselves with suckers, and so, even without care, yield immense\r\ncrops. One need not stir many feet around a good raspberry patch\r\nto enjoy a Transcendental feast.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH BUSH BLACKBERRY; BRAMBLE\r\n (Rubus villosus)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, 1 in. or less across, in terminal raceme-like\r\nclusters. Calyx deeply 5-parted, persistent; 5 large petals;\r\nstamens and carpels numerous, the latter inserted on a pulpy\r\nreceptacle. Stem: 3 to 10 ft. high, woody, furrowed, curved,\r\narmed with stout, recurved prickles. Leaves: Compounded of 3 to 5\r\novate, saw-edged leaflets, the end one stalked, all hairy\r\nbeneath. Fruit: Firmly attached to the receptacle; nearly black,\r\noblong juicy berries 1 in. long or less, hanging in clusters.\r\nRipe, July-August.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, thickets, fence-rows, old fields,\r\nwaysides. Low altitudes.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - New England to Florida, and far westward.\r\n\r\n     \"There was a man of our town,\r\n      And he was wondrous wise,\r\n      He jumped into a bramble bush\" -\r\n\r\nIf we must have poetical associations for every flower, Mother\r\nGoose furnishes several.\r\n\r\nBut for the practical mind this plant's chief interest lies in\r\nthe fact that from its wild varieties the famous Lawton and\r\nKittatinny blackberries have been derived. The late Peter\r\nHenderson used to tell how the former came to be introduced. A\r\ncertain Mr. Secor found an unusually fine blackberry growing wild\r\nin a hedge at New Rochelle, New York, and removed it to his\r\ngarden, where it increased apace. But not even for a gift could\r\nhe induce a neighbor to relieve him of the superfluous bushes, so\r\nlittle esteemed were blackberries in his day. However, a shrewd\r\nlawyer named Lawton at length took hold of it, exhibited the\r\nfruit, advertised it cleverly, and succeeded in pocketing a snug\r\nlittle fortune from the sale of the prolific plants. Another fine\r\nvariety of the common wild blackberry, which was discovered by a\r\nclergyman at the edge of the woods on the Kittatinny Mountains in\r\nNew Jersey, has produced fruit under skilled cultivation that\r\nstill remains the best of its class. When clusters of blossoms\r\nand fruit in various stages of green, red, and black hang on the\r\nsame bush, few ornaments in Nature's garden are more decorative.\r\n\r\nBecause bramble flowers show greater executive ability than the\r\nraspberries do, they flaunt much larger petals, and spread them\r\nout flat to attract insect workers as well as to make room for\r\nthe stamens to spread away from the stigmas - an arrangement\r\nwhich gives freer access to the nectar secreted in a fleshy ring\r\nat the base. Heavy bumblebees, which require a firm support,\r\nnaturally alight in the center, just as they do in the wild\r\nroses, and deposit on the early maturing stigmas some imported\r\npollen. They may therefore be regarded as the truest benefactors,\r\nand it will be noticed that for their special benefit the nectar\r\nis rather deeply concealed, where short-tongued insects cannot\r\nrob them of it. Small bees, which come only to gather pollen from\r\nfirst the outer and then the inner rows of stamens, and a long\r\nlist of other light-weight visitors, too often alight on the\r\npetals to effect cross-fertilization regularly, but they usually\r\nself-fertilize the blossoms. Competition between these flowers\r\nand the next is fierce, for their seasons overlap.\r\n\r\nThe DEWBERRY or LOW RUNNING BLACKBERRY (R. Canadensis), that\r\ntrails its woody stem by the dusty roadside, in dry fields, and\r\non sterile, rocky hillsides, calls forth maledictions from the\r\nbare-footed farmer's boy, except during June and July, when its\r\nprickles are freely forgiven it in consideration of the\r\ndelicious, black, seedy berries it bears. He is the last one in\r\nthe world to confuse this vine with the SWAMP BLACKBERRY (R.\r\nhispidus), a smaller flowered runner, slender and weakly prickly\r\nas to its stem, and insignificant and sour as to its fruit. Its\r\ngreatest charm is when we come upon it in some low meadow in\r\nwinter, when its still persistent, shining, large leaves, that\r\nhave taken on rich autumnal reds, glow among the dry, dead weeds\r\nand grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEPING DALIBARDA\r\n  (Dalibarda repens)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, solitary, or 2 at end of a scape 2 to 5 in.\r\nhigh. Calyx deeply, unevenly 5 or 6 parted, the larger divisions\r\ntoothed; 5 petals falling early; numerous stamens; 5 to 10\r\ncarpels forming as many dry drupelets within the persistent\r\ncalyx. Stem: Creeping, slender, no prickles. Leaves: Long\r\npetioled, in tufts from the runner, almost round, heart-shaped at\r\nbase, crenate-edged, both sides hairy.\r\nPreferred habitat - Woods and wooded hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania, and westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nThis delicate blossom, which one might mistake for a white violet\r\namong a low tuft of violet-like leaves, shows its rose kinship by\r\nits rule of five and its numerous stamens. Like the violet again,\r\nhowever, it bears curious little economical flowers near the\r\nground - flowers which never open, and so save pollen. These,\r\nrequiring no insects to fertilize them, waste no energy in\r\nputting forth petals to advertise for visitors. Nevertheless, to\r\nsave the species from degeneracy from close inbreeding, this\r\nlittle plant needs must display a few showy blossoms to insure\r\ncross-fertilized seed; for the offspring of such defeats the\r\noffspring of self-fertilized plants in the struggle for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA STRAWBERRY\r\n  (Fragaria Virginiana)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, loosely clustered at summit of an erect hairy\r\nscape usually shorter than the leaves. Calyx persistent in fruit,\r\ndeeply 5-cleft, with 5 bracts between the divisions; 5 petals;\r\nstamens and pistils numerous, the latter inserted on a\r\ncushion-like receptacle becoming fleshy in fruit. Staminate and\r\npistillate flowers, from separate roots. Stem: Running, and\r\nforming new plants. Leaves: Tufted from the root, on hairy\r\npetioles 2 to 6 in. tall, compounded of 3 broadly oval, saw-edged\r\nleaflets. Fruit. An ovoid, glistening red berry, the minute\r\nachenes imbedded in pits on its surface. Ripe, June-July. (Latin,\r\nfragum = fragrant fruit, the strawberry.)\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, banks, roadsides, woodlands.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to the Gulf of Mexico, and westward\r\nto Dakota.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but doubtless God\r\nnever did.\" Whether one is kneeling in the fields, gathering the\r\nsun-kissed, fragrant, luscious, wet scarlet berries nodding among\r\nthe grass, or eating the huge cultivated fruit smothered with\r\nsugar and cream, one fervently quotes Dr. Boteler with dear old\r\nlzaak Walton. Shakespeare says : \"My lord of Ely, when I was last\r\nin Holborn, I saw good strawberries in your garden there.\" Is not\r\nthis the first reference to the strawberry under cultivation?\r\nSince the time of Henry V, what multitudes of garden varieties\r\npast the reckoning have been evolved from the smooth, conic\r\nEUROPEAN WOOD STRAWBERRY (F. vesca) now naturalized in our\r\nEastern and Middle States, as well as from our own precious\r\npitted native! Some authorities claim the berry received its name\r\nfrom the straw laid between garden rows to keep the fruit clean,\r\nbut in earliest Anglo-Saxon it was called streowberie, and later\r\nstraberry, from the peculiarity of its straying suckers lying as\r\nif strewn on the ground; and so, after making due allowance for\r\nthe erratic, go-as-you-please spelling of early writers, it would\r\nseem that there might be two theories as to the origin of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\nSince the different sexes of these flowers frequently occur on\r\nseparate plants, good reason have they to woo insect messengers\r\nwith a showy corolla, a ring of nectar, and abundant pollen to be\r\ntransferred while they are feasted. Lucky is the gardener who\r\nsucceeds in keeping birds from pecking their share of the berries\r\nwhich, of course, were primarily intended for them. In English\r\ngardens one is almost certain to find a thrush or two imprisoned\r\nunder the nets so futilely spread over strawberry beds, just as\r\ntheir American cousin, the robin, is caught here in June.\r\n\r\nA young botanist may be interested to note the difference in the\r\nformation of the raspberry or blackberry and the strawberry: in\r\nthe former it is the carpels (ovaries) that swell around the\r\nspongy receptacle into numerous little fruits (drupelets) united\r\ninto one berry, whereas it is the cushion-like receptacle itself\r\nin the strawberry blossom that swells and reddens into fruit,\r\ncarrying with it the tiny yellow pistils to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe NORTHERN WILD STRAWBERRY (F. Canadensis), with clusters of\r\nelongated, oblong little berries delightful to three senses,\r\ncomes over the Canadian border no farther south than the\r\nCatskills. Nearly all strawberry plants show the useless but\r\ncharming eccentricity of bursting into bloom again in autumn, the\r\nlittle white-petaled blossoms coming like unexpected flurries of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nNo one will confuse our common, fruiting species with the small,\r\nyellow-flowered DRY or BARREN STRAWBERRY (Waldsteinia\r\nfragarioides), more nearly related to the cinquefoils. Tufts of\r\nits pretty trefoliate leaves, sent up from a creeping rootstock,\r\ncarpet the woods and hillsides from New England and along the\r\nAlleghanies to Georgia, and westward a thousand miles or more.\r\nFlowers in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE AVENS\r\n  (Geum Canadense; G. album of Gray)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or pale greenish yellow, about 1/2 in. across,\r\nloosely scattered in small clusters on slender peduncles. Calyx\r\npersistent, 5-cleft, with little bracts between the reflexed\r\ndivisions; 5 petals, equaling or shorter than the sepals; stamens\r\nand carpels numerous, the latter collected on a short,\r\nbristly-hairy receptacle; styles smooth below, hairy above,\r\njointed. Stem: 2 1/2 ft. high or less, slender, branching above.\r\nLeaves: Seated on stem or short petioled, of 3 to 5 divisions, or\r\nlobed, toothed small stipules; also irregularly divided large\r\nroot-leaves on long petioles, 3-foliate, usually the terminal\r\nleaflet large, broadly ovate side leaflets much smaller, all more\r\nor less lobed and toothed. Fruit: A ball of achenes, each ending\r\nin an elongated, hooked style.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woodland borders, shady thickets and\r\nroadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, west to the Mississippi or\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nSmall bees and flies attracted to sheltered, shady places by\r\nthese loosely scattered flowers at the ends of zig-zagged stems,\r\npay for the nectar they sip from the disk where the stamens are\r\ninserted, by carrying some of the pollen lunch on their heads\r\nfrom the older to the younger flowers, which mature stigmas\r\nfirst. But saucy bumblebees, undutiful pilferers from the purple\r\navens, rarely visit blossoms so inconspicuous. Insects failing\r\nthese, they are well adapted to pollenize themselves. Most of us\r\nare all too familiar with the seeds, clinging by barbed styles to\r\nany garment passing their way, in the hope that their stolen ride\r\nwill eventually land them in good colonizing ground. Whoever\r\nspends an hour patiently picking off the various seed tramps from\r\nhis clothes after a walk through the woods and fields in autumn,\r\nrealizes that the by hook or by crook method of scattering\r\noffspring is one of Nature's favorites. Simpler plants than those\r\nwith hooked achenia produce enormous numbers of spores so light\r\nand tiny that the wind and rain distribute them wholesale.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED CHOKE-BERRY; DOGBERRY TREE\r\n  (Aronia arbutifolia; Pyrus arbutifolia of Gray)  Apple family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or magenta tinged, 1/2 in. across or less, in\r\nterminal, compound cymes, finally overtopped by young sterile\r\nshoots. Calyx 5-lobed, hairy; 5 concave, spreading petals;\r\nstamens numerous; 3 to 5 styles united at base; ovary woolly.\r\nStem: Shrubby, branching, usually low, rarely 12 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, petioled, oval to oblong, finely cut-edged,\r\nsmooth above, matted with woolly hairs underneath. Fruit: Small,\r\nround or top-shaped, bright red berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, low ground, wet thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Gulf of Mexico, westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nAnother common species often found in the same haunts, the BLACK\r\nCHOKE-BERRY (A. nigra), with similar flowers, the berries very\r\ndark purple, was formerly confounded with the red choke-berry.\r\nBut because it sometimes elects to live in dry ground its leaves\r\nrequire no woolly mat on the underside to absorb vapors arising\r\nfrom wet retreats. No wonder that the insipid little berries.\r\nrelated to apples, pears, and other luscious fruits, should share\r\nwith a cousin, the mountain ash, or rowan, the reproachful name\r\nof dogberry.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNEBERRY; SERVICEBERRY; MAY-CHERRY\r\n  (Amelanchier Canadensis)  Apple family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pure white, over 1 in. across, on long, slender\r\npedicels, in spreading or drooping racemes, with silky, reddish\r\nbracts, early falling, among them. Calyx persistent, 5-parted; 5\r\nlong, narrow, tapering petals, 3 or 4 times the length of calyx;\r\nnumerous stamens inserted on calyx throat; 2 to 5 styles, hairy\r\nat base. Stem: A large shrub or tree, usually much less than 25\r\nft. high, rarely twice that height, wood very hard and heavy.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, oval, tapering at tip, finely saw-edged,\r\nsmooth (like the pear tree's), often hairy when young. Fruit.\r\nRound, crimson, sweet, edible, seedy berries, ripe in June and\r\nJuly.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woodland borders, pasture thickets, dry soil.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico, westward over\r\na thousand miles.\r\n\r\nSilvery-white chandeliers, hanging from the edges of the woods,\r\nlight Flora's path in earliest spring, before the trees and\r\nshrubbery about them have begun to put forth foliage, much less\r\nflowers. Little plants that hug the earth for protection while\r\nrude winds rush through the forest and across the hillsides, are\r\nalready starring her way with fragile, dainty blossoms; but what\r\nother shrub, except the serviceberry's twin sister the shadbush,\r\nor perhaps the spicebush, has the temerity to burst into bloom\r\nwhile March gusts howl through the naked forests? Little female\r\nbees of the Andrena tribe, already at work collecting pollen and\r\nnectar for generations yet unborn, buzz their gratitude about the\r\nbeautiful feathery clusters that lean away from the crowded\r\nthicket with a wild, irregular grace. Nesting birds have abundant\r\ncause for gratitude also, for the attractive, sweet berries, that\r\nripen providentially early; but, of course, the bees which\r\ntransfer pollen from flower to flower, and the birds which drop\r\nthe seeds far and wide, are not the receivers of wholly\r\ndisinterested favors.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe SHADBUSH or SWAMP SUGAR-PEAR (A. Botryapium), because it was\r\nformerly accounted a mere variety (oblongifolia) of the preceding\r\nspecies, still shares with it its popular names; but swamps,\r\nriver banks, brook sides, and moist thickets are its habitat.\r\nConsequently both its inflorescence and pale green, glossy\r\nfoliage are covered with a sort of whitish cotton, absorbent when\r\nyoung, to prevent the pores from clogging with vapors arising\r\nfrom its damp retreats. Late in the season, when streams narrow\r\nor dry up altogether, and the air becomes drier, as the sun rises\r\nhigher in the heavens, the foliage is usually quite smooth. It\r\nwill be noticed that, lovely as the shadbush is, its smaller\r\nflowers have shorter pedicels than the serviceberry's;\r\nconsequently its feathery sprays, which are flung outward to the\r\nsunshine in April and May, lack something of the grace for which\r\nits sister stands preeminent. Under cultivation both species\r\nassume conventional form, and lose the wild irregularities of\r\ngrowth that charm us in Nature's garden. Indians believed, what\r\nis an obvious fact, that when this bush whitens the swampy river\r\nbanks, shad are swimming up the stream from the sea to spawn.\r\nThen, too, the nighthawk, returning from its winter visit south,\r\nbooms forth its curious whirring, vibrating, jarring sound as it\r\ndrops through the air at unseen heights, a dismal, weird noise\r\nwhich the red man thought proceeded from the shad spirits come to\r\nwarn the schools of fish of their impending fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON HAWTHORN: WHITE THORN; SCARLET-FRUITED THORN; RED HAW;\r\nMAYFLOWERS\r\n  (Cratoegus coccinea)  Apple family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, rarely pinkish, usually less than 1 in. across,\r\nnumerous, in terminal corymbs. Calyx 5-lobed; 5 spreading petals\r\ninserted in its throat numerous stamens; styles 3 to 5. Stem: A\r\nshrub or small tree, rarely attaining 30 ft. in height (Kratos =\r\nstrength, in reference to hardness and toughness of the wood);\r\nbranches spreading, and beset with stout spines (thorns) nearly 2\r\nin. long. Leaves: Alternate, petioled, 2 to 3 in. long, ovate,\r\nvery sharply cut or lobed, the teeth glandular-tipped. Fruit:\r\nCoral red, round or oval; not edible.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Thickets, fence-rows, woodland borders.\r\nFlowering Season - May.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland and Manitoba southward to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n     \"The fair maid who, the first of May,\r\n      Goes to the fields at break of day\r\n      And washes in dew from the hawthorn tree\r\n      Will ever after handsome be.\"\r\n\r\nHere is a popular recipe omitted from that volume of\r\nheart-to-heart talks entitled \"How to Be Pretty though Plain\"!\r\n\r\nThe sombre-thoughted Scotchman, looking for trouble, tersely\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n     \"Mony haws,\r\n      Mony snaws.\"\r\n\r\nBut in delicious, blossoming May, when the joy of living fairly\r\nintoxicates one, and every bird's throat is swelling with happy\r\nmusic, who but a Calvinist would croak dismal prophecies? In\r\nIreland, old crones tell marvelous tales about the hawthorns, and\r\nthe banshees which have a predilection for them. So much for\r\nfolklore.\r\n\r\nAs one might suspect from the rather disagreeable odor of these\r\nblossoms, they are most attractive to flies and beetles, which,\r\ncarrying pollen from older flowers, leave some on the stigmas\r\nthat are already mature in newly-opened ones. A concave\r\nnectar-secreting disk, not concealed by the filaments in this\r\ncase, is eagerly pilfered by numerous little short-lipped insects\r\nwhich render no benefit in return; but many others assist in\r\nself-pollination after the anthers ripen. The splendid monarch\r\nbutterfly (Anosia plexippus), the banded purple (Basilarchia\r\narthemis), whose caterpillar feeds on hawthorn foliage, and the\r\nlight brown hunter's butterfly [American painted lady] (Pyrameis\r\nhuntera [Vanessa virginiensis]) are, among the visitors seen\r\nflitting about this exquisite little tree in early May, when it\r\nis fairly white with bloom.\r\n\r\nThe RED-FRUITED THORN (C. mollis), more hairy on its twigs,\r\npetioles, calices, and fruit than the preceding, but so like it\r\nin most respects it was formerly accounted a mere variety, is an\r\nearlier and even more prolific bloomer, the generous, large\r\nclusters of malodorous flowers coming with the leaves in April,\r\nand lasting until the common hawthorn starts into lively\r\ncompetition with it for insect trade.\r\n\r\nNumerous long, slender thorns, often measuring a finger-length,\r\ndistinguish the COCKSPUR or NEWCASTLE THORN (C. Crus-Galli),\r\nwhose abundant small flowers and shining, leathery leaves, dull\r\nunderneath, are conspicuous in thickets from Quebec to the Gulf.\r\nImmense numbers of little bees, among many other visitors, may be\r\nnoted on a fine day in May and early June about this showy shrub\r\nor tree. Because it blooms later than its rival sisters, it has\r\nthe insect wooers then abroad all to itself.\r\n\r\nWhile most of our beautiful native hawthorns have been introduced\r\nto European gardens, it is the WHITE THORN or MAY (C. Oxyacantha)\r\nof Europe and Asia which is most commonly cultivated here. Truly\r\na shrub, like a prophet, is not without honor save in its own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SWEET CLOVER; BOKHARA or TREE CLOVER; WHITE MELILOT; HONEY\r\nLOTUS\r\n  (Melilotus alba)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, fragrant, papilionaceous, the standard\r\npetal a trifle longer than the wings; borne in slender racemes.\r\nStem: 3 to 10 ft. tall, branching. Leaves: Rather distant,\r\npetioled, compounded of 3 oblong, saw-edged leaflets; fragrant,\r\nespecially when dry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wastelands, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - United States, Europe, Asia.\r\n\r\nHappy must the honeybees have been to find that the sweet clover,\r\none of their dearest delights in the Old World, had preceded them\r\nin immigrating to the New. Immense numbers of insects - bees in\r\ngreat variety, wasps, flies, moths, and beetles - visit the\r\nlittle blossoms that provide entertainment so generous and\r\naccessible; but honey-bees are ever especially abundant. Slight\r\nweight depresses the keel, releasing the stigma and anthers\r\ntherefore, so soon as a bee alights and opens the flower, he is\r\nhit below the belt by the projecting stigma. Pollen carried by\r\nhim there from other clovers comes off on its sticky surface\r\nbefore his abdomen gets freshly dusted from the anthers, which\r\nare necessarily rubbed against while he sips nectar. On the\r\nremoval of his pressure, the floret springs back to its closed\r\ncondition, to protect the precious nectar and pollen from rain\r\nand pilferers. As the stigma projects too far beyond the anthers\r\nto be likely to receive any of the flower's own pollen, good\r\nreason is there for the blossoms guarding their attractions for\r\nthe benefit of their friends, which transfer the vitalizing dust\r\nfrom one floret to another. By clustering its small flowers in\r\nspikes, to make them conspicuous, as well as to facilitate dining\r\nfor its benefactors; by prolonging its season of bloom, to get\r\nrelief from the fiercest competition for insect trade, and so to\r\ninsure an abundance of vigorous cross-fertilized seed, this plant\r\nreveals at a glance some of the reasons why it has been able to\r\nestablish itself so quickly throughout our vast area.\r\n\r\nBoth the white and the yellow sweet clover put their leaves to\r\nsleep at night in a remarkable manner: the three leaflets of each\r\nleaf twist through an angle of 90 degrees, until one edge of each\r\nvertical blade is uppermost. The two side leaflets, Darwin found,\r\nalways tend to face the north with their upper surface, one\r\nfacing north-northwest and the other north-northeast, while the\r\nterminal leaflet escapes the chilling of its sensitive upper\r\nsurface through radiation by twisting to a vertical also, but\r\nbending to either east or west, until it comes in contact with\r\nthe vertical upper surface of either of the side leaflets. Thus\r\nthe upper surface of the terminal and of at least one of the side\r\nleaflets is sure to be well protected through the night; one is\r\n\"left out in the cold.\"\r\n\r\nThe dried branches of sweet clover will fill a room with\r\ndelightful fragrance; but they will not drive away flies, nor\r\nprotect woolens from the ravages of moths, as old women once\r\ntaught us to believe.\r\n\r\nThe ubiquitous WHITE or DUTCH CLOVER (Trifolium repens), whose\r\ncreeping branches send up solitary round heads of white or\r\npinkish flowers on erect, leafless stems, from May to December,\r\nin fields, open waste land, and cultivated places throughout our\r\narea, Europe, and Asia, devotes itself to wooing bees, since\r\nthese are the only insects that effect cross-fertilization\r\nregularly, other visitors aiding it only occasionally. When nets\r\nare stretched over these flowers to exclude insects, only\r\none-tenth the normal quantity of fertile seed is set. Therefore,\r\nfor the bee's benefit, does each little floret conceal nectar in\r\na tube so deep that small pilferers cannot reach it; but when a\r\nhoneybee, for example, depresses the keel of the papilionaceous\r\nblossom, abundant reward awaits him in consideration of his\r\nservices in transferring pollen. After the floret which he has\r\nbeen the means of fertilizing closes over its seed-vessel on his\r\ndeparture, it gradually withers, grows brown, and hangs downward,\r\npartly to indicate to the next bee that comes along which fords\r\nin the head still contain nectar, and which are done for; partly\r\nto hide the precious little vigorous green seed-pod in the center\r\nof each withered, papery corolla from the visitation of certain\r\ninsects whose minute grubs destroy countless millions of the\r\nprogeny of less careful plants. Thus the erect florets in a head\r\nstand awaiting their benefactors; those drooping around the outer\r\nedge are engaged in the most serious business of life. Sometimes\r\na solitary old maid remains standing, looking anxiously for a\r\nlover, at the end of the season. Usually all the florets are then\r\nbent down around the stem in a brown and crumpled mass. But\r\nhowever successfully the clover guards its seeds from\r\nannihilation, its foliage is the favorite food of very many\r\nspecies of caterpillars and of all grazing cattle the world\r\naround. This is still another plant frequently miscalled\r\nshamrock. Good luck or bad attends the finding of the leaves,\r\nwhen compounded of an even or an odd number of leaflets more than\r\nthe normal count, according to the saying of many simple-minded\r\nfolk.\r\n\r\nThe little RABBIT'S-FOOT, PUSSY, OLD-FIELD, or STONE CLOVER (T.\r\narvense) has silky plumed calices to hold its minute whitish\r\nflorets, giving the dense, oblong heads a charming softness and\r\ndove color after it has gone to seed. Like most other clovers, it\r\nhas come to us from the Old World.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING SPURGE\r\n  (Euphorbia corollata)  Spurge family\r\n\r\nFlowers - (Apparently) white, small, borne in forked,\r\nlong-stalked umbels, subtended by green bracts; but the true\r\nflowers are minute, and situated within the white cup-shaped\r\ninvolucre, usually mistaken for a corolla. Staminate flowers\r\nscattered over inner surface of involucre, each composed of a\r\nsingle stamen on a thread-like pedicel with a rudimentary calyx\r\nor tiny bract below it. A solitary pistillate flower at bottom of\r\ninvolucre, consisting of 3-celled ovary; 3 styles, 2-cleft, at\r\nlength forming an erect 3-lobed capsule separating into 3\r\n2-valved carpels. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. high, often brightly spotted,\r\nsimple below, umbellately 5-branched above (usually). Leaves:\r\nLinear, lance-shaped or oblong, entire; lower ones alternate,\r\nupper ones whorled.\r\nPreferred Habitat -  Dry soil, gravelly or sandy.\r\nFlowering Season - April-October.\r\nDistribution - From Kansas and Ontario to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nA very commonplace and uninteresting looking weed is this spurge,\r\nwhich no one but a botanist would suspect of kinship with the\r\nbrilliant vermilion poinsettia, so commonly grown in American\r\ngreenhouses. Examination shows that these little bright white\r\ncups of the flowering spurge, simulating a five-cleft corolla,\r\nare no more the true flowers in the one case than the large red\r\nbracts around the poinsettia's globular greenish blossom\r\ninvolucres are in the other. From the milky juice alone one might\r\nguess the spurge to be related to the rubber plant. Still another\r\nfamiliar cousin is the stately castor-oil plant; and while the\r\ncommon dull purplish IPECAC SPURGE (E. Ipecacuanhae) also\r\nsuggests unpleasant doses, it is really a member of quite another\r\nfamily that furnishes the old-fashioned emetic. The flowering\r\nspurge, having its staminate and pistillate flowers distinct,\r\ndepends upon flies, its truest benefactors, to transfer pollen\r\nfrom the former to the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAGHORN SUMAC; VINEGAR TREE\r\n  (Rhus hirta; R. typhina of Gray)  Sumac family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish or yellowish white, very small, usually\r\n5-parted, and borne in dense upright, terminal, pyramidal\r\nclusters. Stem: A shrub or small tree, 6 to 40 ft. high, the ends\r\nof branches forked somewhat like a stag's horns. Leaves.\r\nCompounded of 11 to 31 lance-shaped, saw-edged leaflets, dark\r\ngreen above, pale below; the petioles and twigs often\r\nvelvety-hairy. Fruit: Small globules, very thickly covered with\r\ncrimson hairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, rough or rocky places, banks, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, and westward 1500 miles.\r\n\r\nPainted with glorious scarlet, crimson, and gold, the autumnal\r\nfoliage of the sumacs, and even the fruit, so far eclipse their\r\ninconspicuous flowers in attractiveness that one quite ignores\r\nthem. Not so the small, short-tongued bees (chiefly Andrenidae)\r\nand flies (Dipteria) seeking the freely exposed nectar secreted\r\nin five orange-colored glands in the shallow little cups. As some\r\nof the flowers are staminate and some pistillate, although others\r\nshow a tendency to revert to the perfect condition of their\r\nancestors, it behooves them to entertain their little\r\npollen-carrying visitors generously, otherwise no seed can\r\npossibly be set. And how the autumnal landscape would suffer from\r\nthe loss of the decorative, dark-red, velvety panicles! Beware\r\nonly of the poison sumac's deadly, round grayish-white berries.\r\n\r\nMost sumacs contain more or less tannin in their bark and leaves,\r\nthat are therefore eagerly sought by agents for the leather\r\nmerchants. The beautiful SMOKE or MIST TREE (R. cotinus),\r\ncommonly imported from southern Europe to adorn our lawns\r\n(although a similar species grows wild in the Southwest), serves\r\na more utilitarian purpose in supplying commerce with a rich\r\norange-yellow dye-wood known as young fustic. All this tribe of\r\nshrubs and trees contain resinous, milky juice, drying dark like\r\nvarnish, which in a Japanese species is transformed by the clever\r\nnative artisans into their famous lacquer. With a commercial\r\ninstinct worthy of the Hebrew, they guard this process as a\r\nnational secret.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH, UPLAND, or SCARLET SUMAC (R. glabra), similar to the\r\nstaghorn, but lacking its velvety down, and usually of much lower\r\ngrowth, is the very common and widely distributed shrub of dry\r\nroadsides, railroad banks, and barren fields. Another\r\nlow-growing, but more or less downy upland sumac, the DWARF,\r\nBLACK, or MOUNTAIN SUMAC (R. copallina), may be known by its\r\ndark, glossy green foliage, pale on the underside, and by the\r\nbroadening of the stem into wings between the leaflets. Hungry\r\nmigrating birds alight to feast on the harmless acid red fruit\r\nwhen the gorgeous autumnal foliage illuminates their route\r\nsouthward. But while they are, of course, the natural agents for\r\ndistributing the plants over the country, men find that by\r\ncutting bits of any sumac root and planting them in good garden\r\nsoil, strong specimens are secured within a year. An exquisite\r\ncut-leaved variety of the smooth sumac adorns many fine lawns.\r\n\r\nEveryone should know the POISON SUMAC (R. Vernix - R. venenata of\r\nGray) as the shrub above all others to avoid. Like its cousin,\r\nthe POISON or THREE-LEAVED IVY (R. radicans), which once had the\r\nspecific name Toxicodendron, although Linnaeus applied that title\r\nto a hairy shrub of the Southern States, the poison sumac causes\r\nmost painful swelling and irritation to the skin of some people,\r\nthough they do nothing more than pass it by when the wind is\r\nblowing over it. Others may handle both these plants with\r\nimpunity. In spring they are especially noisome; but when the\r\npores of the skin are opened by perspiration, people who are at\r\nall sensitive should give them a wide berth at any season.\r\nUsually the poison sumac grows in wet or swampy ground; its bark\r\nis gray, its leaf-stalks are red; the leaves are compounded, of\r\nfewer leaflets than those of the innocent sumacs - that is, of\r\nfrom seven to thirteen - which are green on both sides; the\r\nflowers, which are dull whitish-green, grow in loose panicles\r\nfrom the axils of the leaves, and naturally the berries follow\r\nthem in the same unusual situation. \"By their fruits ye shall\r\nknow them:\" all the harmless sumacs have red fruit clusters at\r\nthe ends of the branches, whereas both the poison sumac's and the\r\npoison ivy's axillary clusters are dull grayish-white.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN HOLLY\r\n  (Ilex opaca)  Holly family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, greenish or yellowish white, from 3 to 10\r\nstaminate ones in a short cyme; fertile flowers usually solitary,\r\nscattered. Stem: A small tree of very slow growth, rarely\r\nattaining any great height. Leaves: Evergreen, thick, rigid,\r\nglossy, elliptical, scalloped edged, spiny-tipped. Fruit: Round,\r\nred berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, west to Texas,\r\nchiefly near the coast and south of New York.\r\n\r\nHappily we continue to borrow all the beautiful Old World\r\nassociations, poetical and legendary, that cluster about the\r\nholly at Christmas time, although our native tree furnishes most\r\nof our holiday decorations. So far back as Pliny's day, the\r\nEuropean holly had all manner of supernatural qualities\r\nattributed to it: its insignificant little flowers caused water\r\nto freeze, he tells us; because it was believed to repel\r\nlightning, the Romans planted it near their houses; and a branch\r\nof it thrown after any refractory animal, even if it did not hit\r\nhim, would subdue him instantly, and cause him to lie down meekly\r\nbeside the stick! Can it be that the Italian peasants, who still\r\nbelieve cattle kneel in their stalls at midnight on the\r\nanniversary of Jesus' birth, decorate the mangers on Christmas\r\neve with holly, among other plants, because of a survival of this\r\nold pagan notion about its subduing effect on animals?\r\n\r\nWould that the beautiful holly of English gardens (I.\r\nAquifolium), more glossy and spiny of leaf and redder of berry\r\nthan our own, might live here; but it is too tender to withstand\r\nNew England winters, and the hot, dry summers farther south soon\r\nprove fatal. Ilex was the ancient name, not of these plants, but\r\nof the holly oak.\r\n\r\nThe MOUNTAIN HOLLY (Ilicioides mucronata - Nemopanthes Canadensis\r\nof Gray) a shrub of the northern swamps, about six feet high, and\r\nby no means confined to mountainous regions, since it is also\r\nabundant in the middle West, has smooth-edged, elliptic, petioled\r\nleaves, ash-colored bark, small, solitary, narrow-petalled\r\nstaminate and pistillate flowers on long, threadlike pedicels\r\nfrom the leaf-axils in May. In August dull pale-red berries\r\nappear. Darwin proved that seed set with the help of pollen\r\nbrought from distinct plants produces offspring that vanquishes\r\nthe offspring of seed set with pollen brought from another flower\r\non the same plant in the struggle for existence. Thus we see, in\r\nvery many ambitious plants besides those of the holly tribe, a\r\ntendency to separate the male and the female flowers as widely as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK ALDER; WINTERBERRY FEVER-BUSH\r\n  (Ilex verticillata)  Holly family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, greenish white, the staminate clusters 2 to 10\r\nflowered the fertile ones 1 to 3 flowered. Stem: A shrub 6 to 25\r\nft. high. Leaves: Oval, tapering to a point, about 1 in. wide,\r\nsaw-edged, dark green, smooth above, hairy, especially along\r\nveins underneath. Fruit: Bright red berries, about the size of a\r\npea, apparently whorled around the twigs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, ditches, fencerows, and low thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, west to Missouri.\r\n\r\nBeautiful bright red berries, dotted or clustered along the naked\r\ntwigs of the black alder, add an indispensable cheeriness to the\r\nsomber winter landscape. Bunches of them, commonly sold in the\r\ncity streets for household decoration, bring twenty-five cents\r\neach; hence the shrubs within a large radius of each market get\r\nample pruning every autumn. The leaves turn black before dropping\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH WINTERBERRY (I. laevigata), a similar species, but of\r\nmore restricted range, ripens its larger, orange-red berries\r\nearlier than the preceding, and before its leaves, which turn\r\nyellow, not black, in autumn, have fallen. Another distinguishing\r\nfeature is that its small, greenish-white staminate flowers grow\r\non long, very slender pedicels; whereas the solitary fertile\r\nflowers are much nearer the stern.\r\n\r\n\r\nBITTERSWEET; WAX-WORK; STAFF-TREE\r\n  (Celastrus scandens)  Staff-tree family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, greenish-white, 5-parted, some staminate, some\r\npistillate only; in terminal compound racemes 4 in. long or less.\r\nStem: Woody, twining. Leaves: Alternate, oval, tapering, finely\r\ntoothed, thin, with a tendency to show white variations. Fruit: A\r\nyellow-orange berry-like capsule, splitting at maturity and\r\ncurling back to display the scarlet, pulpy coating of the seeds\r\nwithin.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich soil of thickets, fence rows, and\r\nwayslde tangles.\r\nFlowering Season - June.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina, New Mexico, and far north.\r\n\r\nNot to be hung above mirror and picture frames in farmhouse\r\nparlors, as we have been wont to think, do the brilliant clusters\r\nof orange-red wax-work berries attract the eye, where they\r\nbrighten old walls, copses, and fence rows in autumn; but to\r\nadvertise their charming wares to hungry migrating birds, which\r\nwill drop the seeds concealed within the red berry perhaps a\r\nthousand miles away, and so plant new colonies. On the smaller,\r\nless specialized bees and flies the vine depends in June to carry\r\npollen from its staminate flowers to the fertile ones, whose\r\nthick, erect pistil would wither without fruiting without their\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nBut the best laid plans of other creatures than mice and men\r\n\"gang aft a-gley.\" What mean the little cottony tufts all along\r\nthe stems of so very many bittersweet vines, but that these have\r\nfoes as well as friends? Curious little parasitic tree-hoppers\r\n(Membracis binotata), which spend their entire lives on the\r\nstems, sucking the juices through their little beaks, just as the\r\naphids moor themselves to the tender rose-twigs, might be\r\nmistaken for thorns during one of their protective masquerades.\r\nAgain they look like diminutive flocks of fowl, their heads ever\r\npointing in one direction, no matter how the vine may twist and\r\nturn - always toward the top of the branch, that they may the\r\nbetter siphon the sap down their tiny throats. Toward the end of\r\nsummer the females, which have a sharp instrument at the rear of\r\ntheir bodies, cut deeply into the juicy food-store, the cambium\r\nlayer of bark, and there deposit their eggs. Presently, a nest\r\nbeing filled, the mother emits a substantial froth at the end of\r\nher ovipositor, and proceeds to construct the cottony, corrugated\r\ndome over her nursery which first attracted our attention. This\r\nis especially skilful work, for she works behind her, evidently\r\nnot from sight, but from instinct only. Inasmuch as the young\r\nhoppers will not come forth until the following summer, some such\r\nsnug protection is required during winter's cold and snows. With\r\nhordes of little parasites constantly preying on its juices, is\r\nit any wonder the vine is often too enfeebled to produce seed, or\r\nthat the leaves lose part of their color and become, as we say,\r\nvariegated? Occasionally one finds the cottony nursery domes of\r\nthis little hopper on the locust tree - the favorite home of its\r\nbig, noisy relative, the so-called locust, or cicada.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY TEA; WILD SNOWBALL; RED-ROOT\r\n  (Ceanothus Americanus)  Buckthorn family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, on white pedicels, crowded in dense,\r\noblong, terminal clusters. Calyx white, hemispheric, 5-lobed;\r\npetals, hooded and long-clawed; 5 stamens with long filaments;\r\nstyle short, 3-cleft. Stems: Shrubby, 1 to 3 ft. high, usually\r\nseveral, from a deep reddish root. Leaves: Alternate,\r\novate-oblong, acute at tip, finely saw-edged, 3-nerved, on short\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, open woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Ontario south and west to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nLight, feathery clusters of white little flowers crowded on the\r\ntwigs of this low shrub interested thrifty colonial housewives of\r\nRevolutionary days not at all; the tender, young, rusty, downy\r\nleaves were what they sought to dry as a substitute for imported\r\ntea. Doubtless the thought that they were thereby evading George\r\nthe Third's tax and brewing patriotism in every kettleful added a\r\nsweetness to the homemade beverage that sugar itself could not\r\nimpart. The American troops were glad enough to use New Jersey\r\ntea throughout the war. A nankeen or cinnamon-colored dye is made\r\nfrom the reddish root.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN, WILD, FOX, or PLUM GRAPE\r\n  (Vitis Labrusca)  Grape family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish, small, deliciously fragrant, some staminate,\r\nsome pistillate, rarely perfect; the fertile flowers in more\r\ncompact panicles than the sterile ones. Stem: Climbing with the\r\nhelp of tendrils; woody, bark loose. Leaves: Large, rounded or\r\nlobed, toothed, rusty-hairy underneath, especially when young,\r\neach leathery leaf opposite a tendril or a flower cluster. Fruit:\r\nClusters containing a few brownish, purple, musky-scented grapes,\r\n3/4 in. across. Ripe, August-September.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sunny thickets, loamy or gravelly soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June.\r\nDistribution - New England to Georgia, west to Minnesota and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nAesop's fox may never have touched the grapes of fable, but this,\r\nour wild species, certainly retains a strong foxy odor, which at\r\nleast suggests that he came very near them. Tough pulp and thick\r\nskin by no means deter birds and beasts from feasting on this\r\nfruit, and so dispersing the seeds; but mankind prefers the\r\ntender, delightful flavored Isabella, Catawba, and Concord grapes\r\nderived from it. The Massachusetts man who produced the Concord\r\nvariety in the town whose name he gave it, declares he would be a\r\nmillionaire had he received only a penny royalty on every Concord\r\ngrapevine planted.\r\n\r\nWhat fragrance is more delicious than that of the blossoming\r\ngrape? To swing in a loop made by some strong old vine, when the\r\nair almost intoxicates one with its sweetness on a June evening,\r\nis many a country child's idea of perfect bliss. Not until about\r\nnine o'clock do the leaves \"go to sleep\" by becoming depressed in\r\nthe center like saucers. This was the signal for bedtime that one\r\nchild, at least, used to wait for. We have seen in the clematis\r\nhow its sensitive leafstalks hook themselves over any support\r\nthey rub against; but the grapevine has gone a step farther, and\r\nby discarding an occasional flower cluster and prolonging the\r\nflower stalk into a coiling, forking tendril it moors itself to\r\nthe thicket. We know that all tendrils are either transformed\r\nleaves, as in the case of the pea vine, where each branch of its\r\ntendril represents a modified leaflet; or they are transformed\r\nflower stalks or other organs. Occasionally the tendril of a\r\ngrapevine reveals its ancestry by bearing a blossom or a cluster\r\nof flowers, and sometimes even fruit, about midway on the coil,\r\nwhich attempts to fill all offices at once like Pooh Bah.\r\n\r\nThe phylloxera having destroyed many of the finest vineyards in\r\nEurope, it would seem that Americans have the best of chances to\r\nsupply the world with high-class wines, for there is not a State\r\nin the Union where the vine will not flourish. Here its worst\r\nenemy is mildew, a parasitical fungus which attacks the leaves,\r\nrevealing itself in yellowish-brown patches on the upper side,\r\nand thin, frosty patches underneath. Soon the leaves become sere,\r\nand then they fall. The microscope reveals a miniature forest of\r\ngrowth in each leaf, with the threadlike roots of the fungi\r\nsearching about the leaf cells for food. To burn old leaves, and\r\nto blow sulphur over the vine while it is wet, are efficacious\r\nremedies. Bees and wasps which puncture grapes to feast on them,\r\nare the innocent means of destroying quantities.\r\n\r\nBoth the RIVERSIDE or SWEET-SCENTED GRAPE (V. vulpina; formerly\r\nV. cordifolia, var. riparia) - whose bluish-black, bloom-covered\r\nfruit begins to ripen in July; and the FROST, CHICKEN, POSSUM, or\r\nWINTER GRAPE (V. cordifolia), whose smaller, shining black\r\nberries are not at their best till after frost, grow along\r\nstreams and preferably in rocky situations. The shining, light\r\ngreen, thin leaves of the sweet-scented species are sharply\r\nlobed, the three to seven lobes have acute teeth, and the\r\ntendrils are intermittent. The frost grape's leaves, which are\r\ncommonly three or four inches wide, are deeply heart-shaped,\r\nentire (rarely slightly three-lobed), tapering to a long point\r\nand acutely toothed.\r\n\r\nAnother familiar member of the Grape family, the VIRGINIA\r\nCREEPER, FALSE GRAPE, AMERICAN or FIVE-LEAVED IVY, also\r\nerroneously called WOODBINE (Parthenocissus quinquefolia;\r\nformerly Ampelopsis quinquefolia) - is far more charming in its\r\nglorious autumnal foliage, when its small dark blue berries hang\r\nfrom red peduncles, than when its insignificant greenish flower\r\nclusters appear in July. The leaves, compounded of five leaflets,\r\nshould sufficiently distinguish the harmless vine from the\r\nthree-leaved poison ivy, sometimes confounded with it. From\r\nManitoba and Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean, and even in Cuba, the\r\nVirginia creeper rambles over thickets, fences, and walls,\r\nascends trees, festoons rocky woodlands, drapes our verandas,\r\nmaking its way with the help of modified flower stalks that are\r\nnow branching tendrils, each branch bearing an adhesive disk at\r\nthe end. \"In the course of about two days after a tendril has\r\narranged its branches so as to press upon any surface,\" says\r\nDarwin, \"its curved tips swell, become bright red, and form on\r\ntheir undersides little disks or cushions with which they adhere\r\nfirmly.\" It is supposed that these disks secrete a cement. At any\r\nrate, we know that they have a very tenacious hold, because often\r\none contracting tendril, as elastic as a steel spring, supports,\r\nby means of these little disks, the entire weight of the branch\r\nit lifts up. Darwin concluded that a tendril with five\r\ndisk-bearing branches, on which he experimented, would stand a\r\nstrain of ten pounds, even after ten years' exposure to high\r\nwinds and softening rains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE VIOLETS\r\n  (Viola)  Violet family\r\n\r\nThree small-flowered, white, purple-veined, and almost beardless\r\nspecies which prefer to dwell in moist meadows, damp, mossy\r\nplaces, and along the borders of streams, are the LANCE-LEAVED\r\nVIOLET (V. lanceolata), the PRIMROSE-LEAVED VIOLET (V.\r\nprirnulaefolia), and the SWEET WHITE VIOLET (V. blanda), whose\r\nleaves show successive gradations from the narrow, tapering,\r\nsmooth, long-petioled blades of the first to the oval form of the\r\nsecond and the almost circular, cordate leaf of the delicately\r\nfragrant, little white blanda, the dearest violet of all.\r\nInasmuch as these are short-spurred species, requiring no effort\r\nfor bees to drain their nectaries, no footholds in the form of\r\nbeards on the side petals are provided for them. The purple\r\nveinings show the stupidest visitor the path to the sweets.\r\n\r\nThe sprightly CANADA VIOLET (V. Canadensis), widely distributed\r\nin woodlands, chiefly in hilly and mountainous regions, rears\r\ntall, leafy stems terminated by faintly fragrant white or pale\r\nlavender blossoms, purple-tinged without and purple veined, the\r\nside petals bearded, the long sepals tapering to sharp points.\r\nHere we see a violet in the process of changing from the white\r\nancestral type to the purple color which Sir John Lubbock, among\r\nother scientists, considers the highest step in chromatic\r\nevolution. This species has heart-shaped, saw-edged leaves which\r\ntaper acutely. From May even to July is its regular blooming\r\nseason; but the delightful family eccentricity of flowering again\r\nin autumn appears to be a confirmed habit with the Canada violet.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCHANTER'S NIGHTSHADE\r\n  (Circaea Lutetiana)  Evening Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, white, slender pedicelled, in terminal and\r\nlateral racemes. Calyx 2-parted, hairy 2 petals, 2 alternate\r\nstamens. Stem: 1 to 2 ft. high, slender, branching, swollen at\r\nnodes. Leaves: Opposite, tapering to a point, distantly toothed,\r\n2 to 4 in. long, slender petioled. Fruit: Pear-shaped, 2-celled,\r\ndensely covered with stiff, hooked hairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods; shady roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, westward to Nebraska.\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\nWhy Circe, the enchantress, skilled in the use of poisonous\r\nherbs, should have had her name applied to this innocent and\r\ninsignificant looking little plant is not now obvious; neither is\r\nthe title of nightshade any more appropriate.\r\n\r\nEach tiny flower having a hairy calyx, that acts as a stockade\r\nagainst ants and other such crawling pilferers, we suspect there\r\nare abundant sweets secreted in the fleshy ring at the base of\r\nthe styles for the benefit of the numerous flies seen hovering\r\nabout. Among other visitors, watch the common housefly alighting\r\non the knobby stigma, a most convenient landing place, where he\r\nleaves some pollen carried on his underside from other nightshade\r\nblossoms. In clasping the bases of the two pliable stamens, his\r\nonly available supports as he sucks, he will surely get well\r\ndusted again, that he may fertilize the next blossom he flies to\r\nfor refreshment. The nightshade's little pear-shaped seed\r\nvessels, armed with hooked bristles by which they steal a ride on\r\nany passing petticoat or trouser leg, reveal at a glance how this\r\nplant has contrived to travel around the globe.\r\n\r\nA smaller, weaker species (Circaea alpina), found in cool, moist\r\nwoods, chiefly north, has thin, shining leaves and soft, hooked\r\nhairs on its vagabond seeds. Less dependence seems to be placed\r\non these ineffective hooks to help perpetuate the plant than on\r\nthe tiny pink bulblets growing at the end of an exceedingly\r\nslender thread sent out by the parent roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SPIKENARD; INDIAN ROOT; SPIGNET\r\n  (Aralia racemosa)  Ginseng family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish white, small, 5-parted, mostly imperfect, in a\r\ndrooping compound raceme of rounded clusters. Stem: 3 to 6 ft.\r\nhigh, branches spreading. Roots: Large, thick, fragrant. Leaves:\r\nCompounded of heart-shaped, sharply tapering, saw-edged leaflets\r\nfrom 2 to 5 in. long, often downy underneath. Lower leaves often\r\nenormous. Fruit: Dark reddish-brown berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich open woods, wayside thickets, light\r\nsoil.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Georgia, west to the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA striking, decorative plant, once much sought after for its\r\nmedicinal virtues - still another herb with which old women\r\ndelight to dose their victims for any malady from a cold to a\r\ncarbuncle. Quite a different plant, but a relative, is the one\r\nwith hairy, spike-like shoots from its fragrant roots, from which\r\nthe \"very precious\" ointment poured by Mary upon the Saviour's\r\nhead was made. The nard, an Indian product from that plant, which\r\nis still found growing on the distant Himalayas, could then be\r\nimported into Palestine only by the rich.\r\n\r\nThe wild spikenard, or false Solomon's seal, has not the remotest\r\nconnection with this tribe of plants. Inasmuch as some of the\r\nAmerican spikenard's tiny flowers are staminate and some\r\npistillate, while others again are perfect, they depend upon\r\nflies chiefly - but on some wasps and beetles, too - to transfer\r\npollen and enable the fertile ones to set seed. How certain of\r\nthe winter birds gormandize on the resinous, spicy little\r\nberries! A flock of juncos will strip the fruit from every\r\nspikenard in the neighborhood the first day it arrives from the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nThe WILD or FALSE SARSAPARILLA (A. nudicaulis), so common in\r\nwoods, hillsides, and thickets, shelters its three spreading\r\numbels of greenish-white flowers in May and June beneath a canopy\r\nformed by a large, solitary, compound leaf. The aromatic roots,\r\nwhich run horizontally sometimes three feet or more through the\r\nsoil, send up a very short, smooth proper stem which lifts a tall\r\nleafstalk and a shorter, naked flower stalk. The single large\r\nleaf, of exquisite bronzy tints when young, is compounded of from\r\nthree to five oval, toothed leaflets on each of its three\r\ndivisions. The tiny five-parted flowers have their petals curved\r\nbackward over the calyx to make their refreshments more\r\naccessible for the flies, on which they chiefly rely for aid in\r\nproducing those close clusters of dark-purple berries on which\r\nmigrating birds feast in early autumn. By these agents the plant\r\nhas been distributed from Newfoundland to the Carolinas, westward\r\nfrom Manitoba to Missouri, which is not surprising when we\r\nremember that certain birds travel from the Gulf of Mexico to the\r\nGreat Lakes in a single night. While the true sarsaparilla of\r\nmedicine should come from a quite different herb that flourishes\r\nin Mexico and South America, this one furnishes a commercial\r\nsubstitute enormously used as a blood purifier and cooling summer\r\ndrink. Burrowing rabbits delight to nibble the long, slender,\r\nfragrant roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe GINSENG (Panax quinquefolium; Aralia quinquefolia of Gray)\r\nfound in rich woods from Quebec to Alabama, and westward to\r\nNebraska - that is, where found at all, for much hunting has all\r\nbut exterminated it in many regions - bears a solitary umbel of\r\nsmall yellowish-green, five-parted, polygamous flowers in July\r\nand August at the end of a smooth stem about a foot high. Bright\r\ncrimson berries follow the clusters on the female plants in early\r\nautumn. Three long-petioled leaves, which grow in a whorl at the\r\ntop of the low stem, are palmately divided into five thin, ovate,\r\npointed, and irregularly toothed leaflets. But it is the deep\r\nfusiform root, simple or branched, about which the Americanized\r\nChinese, at least, are most concerned. For centuries Chinese\r\nphysicians have ascribed miraculous virtues to the Manchurian\r\nginseng. Not only can it remove fatigue and restore lost powers,\r\nbut by its use veterans became frisky youths again according to\r\nthese wise men of the East. In short, they consider it the\r\npanacea for all ills (Panax: pan = all, akos = remedy) - the\r\nsource of immortality. Naturally the roots were and are in great\r\ndemand, especially such as branch so as to resemble the human\r\nform. (Both the Chinese name Schin-sen, and Garan-toguen, the\r\nIndian one, are said to mean like a man. Here is an interesting\r\nclue for the ethnologists to follow !) Imperial edict prohibited\r\nthe Chinese from digging up their native plant lest it be\r\nexterminated. So Jesuit missionaries, who discovered our similar\r\nginseng, were not slow in exporting it to China when it was\r\nliterally worth its weight in gold. Indeed, it is always sold by\r\nweight - a fact on which the heathen Chinee \"with ways that are\r\ndark and tricks that are vain\" not infrequently relies. Chinamen,\r\nwho gather large quantities in our Western States to sell to the\r\nwholesale druggists for export, sometimes drill holes into the\r\nlargest roots, pour in melted lead, and plug up the drills so\r\ningeniously that druggists refuse to pay for a Chinaman's\r\ndiggings until they have handled and weighed each root\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nThe DWARF GINSENG, OR GROUND NUT (P. trifolium; Aralia trifolia\r\nof Gray) whose little white flowers are clustered in feathery,\r\nfluffy balls above the whorl of three compound leaves in April\r\nand May, chooses low thickets and moist woods for its habitat -\r\noften in the same neighborhood with its larger relative.\r\nYellowish berries follow the fragrant white pompons. One must\r\nburrow deep, like the rabbits, to find its round, pungent, sweet,\r\nnut-like root, measuring about half an inch across, which few\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD CARROT; QUEEN ANNE'S LACE; BIRD'S-NEST\r\n  (Daucus Carota)  Carrot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, of unequal sizes (polygamous), white, rarely\r\npinkish gray, 5-parted, in a compound, flat, circular umbel, the\r\ncentral floret often dark crimson; the umbels very concave in\r\nfruit. An involucre of narrow, pinnately cut bracts. Stem: 1 to 3\r\nft. high, with stiff hairs; from a deep, fleshy, conic root.\r\nLeaves: Cut into fine, fringy divisions; upper ones smaller and\r\nless dissected.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wastelands, fields, roadsides. Flowering\r\nSeason - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Eastern half of United States and Canada. Europe\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nA pest to farmers, a joy to the flower lover, and a welcome\r\nsignal for refreshment to hosts of flies, beetles, bees, and\r\nwasps, especially to the paper-nest builders, the sprangly wild\r\ncarrot lifts its fringy foliage and exquisite lacy, blossoms\r\nabove the dry soil of three continents. From Europe it has come\r\nto spread its delicate wheels over our summer landscape, until\r\nwhole fields are whitened by them east of the Mississippi. Having\r\nproved fittest in the struggle for survival in the fiercer\r\ncompetition of plants in the over-cultivated Old World, it takes\r\nits course of empire westward year by year, Finding most\r\nfavorable conditions for colonizing in our vast, uncultivated\r\narea; and the less aggressive, native occupants of our soil are\r\nonly too readily crowded out. Would that the advocates of\r\nunrestricted immigration of foreign peasants studied the parallel\r\nexamples among floral invaders!\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of the wild carrots' triumphal march? As\r\nusual, it is to be sought chiefly in the flower's scheme to\r\nattract and utilize visitors. Nectar being secreted in open disks\r\nnear to one another, the shortest-tongued insects can lick it up\r\nfrom the Umbelliferae with even less loss of time than from the\r\ntubular florets of the Cornpositae. Over sixty distinct species\r\nof insects may be taken on the wild carrot by any amateur, since\r\nit blooms while insect life is at its height but, as might be\r\nexpected, the long-tongued and color-loving, specialized bees and\r\nbutterflies do not often waste time on florets so easily drained\r\nby the mob. Ants find the stiff hairs on the stem disagreeable\r\nobstacles to pilfering; but no visitors seem to object to the\r\nflowers' suffocating odor.\r\n\r\nOne of these lacy, white umbels must be examined under a lens\r\nbefore its delicate structure and perfection of detail can be\r\nappreciated. Naturally a visitor is attracted first by the\r\nlargest, most showy florets situated around the outer edge of the\r\nwheel, on which he leaves pollen, brought from another umbel; and\r\nany vitalizing dust remaining on his under side may be left on\r\nthe less conspicuous hermaphrodite blossoms as he makes his way\r\ntoward the center, where the tiny, pollen-bearing florets are\r\ngrouped. From the latter, as he flies away, he will carry fresh\r\npollen to the outer row of florets on another umbel, and so on -\r\nat least this is the usual and highly advantageous method. After\r\ngeneral fertilization, the slender flower-stalks curl inward, and\r\nthe umbel forms a hollow nest that gradually contracts as it\r\ndries, almost, if not quite, closing at the top, albeit the\r\nfiction that bees and spiders make their home in the seeding\r\numbels circulates freely.\r\n\r\nStill another fiction is that the cultivated carrot, introduced\r\nto England by the Dutch in Queen Elizabeth's reign, was derived\r\nfrom this wild species. Miller, the celebrated English botanist\r\nand gardener, among many others, has disproved this statement by\r\nutterly failing again and again to produce an edible vegetable\r\nfrom this wild root. When cultivation of the garden carrot lapses\r\nfor a few generations, it reverts to the ancestral type -a\r\nspecies quite distinct from Daucus Carota.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOOTHER SWEET CICELY\r\n  (Washingtonia longistylis; Osmorrhiza longistylis of Gray)\r\nCarrot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, 5-parted; in few rayed, long-peduncled\r\numbels, with small bracts below them. Stem: 1 1/2 to 3 ft. high,\r\nbranching, from thick, fleshy, fragrant, edible roots. Leaves:\r\nLower ones often very large, long-petioled, thrice-compound, and\r\nagain divided, the leaflets ovate, pointed, deeply toothed,\r\nslightly downy; upper leaves less compound, nearly sessile.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Carolinas, westward to Dakota.\r\n\r\nGraceful in gesture, with delicate, fernlike leaves and\r\nanise-scented roots that children, like rabbits, delight to\r\nnibble, the sweet cicely attracts attention by its fragrance,\r\nhowever insignificant its flowers. In wooded places, such as it\r\nprefers to dwell in, white blossoms, which are far more\r\nnoticeable in a dim light than colored ones, and finely cut\r\nleaves that can best withstand the drip from trees, abound. These\r\nwhite umbels bear a large proportion of male, or pollen-bearing,\r\nflorets to the number of hermaphrodite, or two-sexed, florets;\r\nbut as the latter mature their pollen before their stigmas become\r\nsusceptible to it, self-fertilization is well guarded against,\r\nand cross-fertilization is effected with the help of as many\r\nflies as small bees, which come in numbers to lick up the nectar\r\nso freely exposed in consideration of their short tongues. We\r\nhave to thank these little creatures for the long, slender seeds,\r\narmed with short bristles along the ribs, that they may snatch\r\nrides on our garments, together with the beggar-ticks, burdock,\r\ncleavers, and other vagabond colonists in search of unoccupied\r\nground. Be sure you know the difference between sweet cicely and\r\nthe poisonous water hemlock before tasting the former's spicy\r\nroot.\r\n\r\nWas there no more important genus - containing, if possible, red,\r\nwhite, and blue flowers - to have named in honor of the Father of\r\nhis Country?\r\n\r\nAnother member of the Carrot family, the SANICLE or BLACK\r\nSNAKEROOT (Sanicula Marylandica), found blooming from May to July\r\nin such rich, moist woodlands and shrubbery as the sweet cicely\r\nprefers, lifts spreading, two to four rayed umbels of\r\ninsignificant-looking but interesting little greenish-white\r\nflorets. At first the tips of the five petals are tucked into the\r\ncenter of each little flower; underneath them the stamens are now\r\nimprisoned while any danger of self-fertilizing the stigma\r\nremains. The few hermaphrodite florets have their styles\r\nprotruding from the start, and incoming insects leave pollen\r\nbrought from staminate florets on the early-maturing stigmas.\r\nAfter cross-fertilization has been effected, it is the pistil's\r\nturn to keep out of the way, and give the imprisoned stamens a\r\nchance: the styles curve until the stigmas are pressed against\r\nthe sides of the ovary, that not a grain of pollen may touch\r\nthem; the petals spread and release the stamens; but so great is\r\nthe flower's zeal not to be fertilized with its own pollen that\r\nit sometimes holds the anthers tightly between the petals until\r\nall the vitalizing dust has been shed! Around the hermaphrodite\r\nflorets are a large number of male florets in each hemispheric\r\ncluster. Hooked bristles and slender, curved styles protrude from\r\nthe little burr-like seeds, that any creature passing by may give\r\nthem a lift to fresh colonizing land! The firm bluish-green\r\nleaves, palmately divided into from five to seven oblong,\r\nirregularly saw-edged segments, the upper leaves seated on the\r\nstem, the lower ones long-petioled, help us to identify this\r\ncommon weed.\r\n\r\nWith splendid, vigorous gesture the COW-PARSNIP (Heracleum\r\nlanatum) rears itself from four to eight feet above moist, rich\r\nsoil from ocean to ocean in circumpolar regions as in temperate\r\nclimes. A perfect Hercules for coarseness and strength does it\r\nappear when contrasted with some of the dainty members of the\r\ncarrot tribe. In June and July, when a myriad of winged creatures\r\nare flying, large, compound, many-rayed umbels of both\r\nhermaphrodite and male white flowers are spread to attract their\r\nbenefactors the flies, of which twenty-one species visit them\r\nregularly, besides small bees, wasps, and other short-tongued\r\ninsects, which have no difficulty in licking up the freely\r\nexposed nectar. The anthers, maturing first, compel\r\ncross-fertilization which accounts for the plant's vigor and its\r\naggressive march across the continent. A very stout, ridged,\r\nhairy stem, the petioled leaves compounded of three broadly\r\novate, lobed and saw-edged divisions, downy on the underside, and\r\nthe great umbels, which sometimes measure a foot across, all bear\r\nout the general impression of a Hercules of the fields.\r\n\r\nFOOL'S PARSLEY, or CICELY, or DOG-POISON (Aethusa cynapium), a\r\nEuropean immigrant found in waste ground and rubbish heaps from\r\nNova Scotia to New Jersey and westward to the Mississippi, should\r\nbe known only to be avoided. The dark bluish-green, finely\r\ndivided, rather glossy leaves when bruised do not give out the\r\nfamiliar fragrance of true parsley; the little narrow bracts,\r\nturned downward around each separate flower-cluster, give it a\r\nbearded appearance, otherwise the white umbel suggests a small\r\nwild carrot head of bloom. Cows have died from eating this\r\ninnocent-looking little plant among the herbage; but most\r\ncreatures know by instinct that it must not be touched.\r\n\r\nStrange that a family which furnishes the carrot, parsnip,\r\nparsley, fennel, caraway, coriander, and celery to mankind,\r\nshould contain many members with deadly properties. Fortunately\r\nthe large, coarse WATER HEMLOCK, SPOTTED COWBANE, MUSQUASH ROOT,\r\nor BEAVER-POISON (Cicuta maculata) has been branded as a\r\nmurderer. Purple streaks along its erect branching stem\r\ncorrespond to the marks on Cain's brow. Above swamps and low\r\nground it towers. Twice or thrice pinnate leaves, the lower ones\r\nlong-stalked and often enormous, the leaflets' conspicuous veins\r\napparently ending in the notches of the coarse, sharp teeth, help\r\nto distinguish it from its innocent relations sometimes\r\nconfounded with it. Its several tuberiform fleshy roots contain\r\nan especially deadly poison; nevertheless, some highly\r\nintelligent animals, beavers, rabbits, and the omnivorous small\r\nboy among others have mistaken it for sweet-cicely with fatal\r\nresults. Indeed, the potion drunk by Socrates and other\r\nphilosophers and criminals at Athens, is thought to have been a\r\ndecoction made from the roots of this very hemlock. Many little\r\nwhite flowers in each cluster make up a large umbel; and many\r\numbels to a plant attract great numbers of flies, small bees, and\r\nwasps, which sip the freely exposed nectar apparently with only\r\nthe happiest consequences, as they transfer pollen from the male\r\nto the proterandrous hermaphrodite flowers. Just as the\r\ncow-parsnip shows a preponderance of flies among its visitors, so\r\nthe water hemlock seems to attract far more bees and wasps than\r\nany of the umbel-bearing carrot tribe. It blooms from the end of\r\nJune through August.\r\n\r\nStill another poisonous species is the HEMLOCK WATER-PARSNIP\r\n(Sium cicutaefolium), found in swampy places throughout Canada\r\nand the United States from ocean to ocean. The compound,\r\nlong-rayed umbels of small white flowers, fringy-bracted below,\r\nwhich measure two or three inches across; the extremely variable\r\npinnate leaves, which may be divided into from three to six pairs\r\nof narrow and sharply toothed leaflets (or perhaps the lower\r\nlong-stalked ones as finely dissected as a wild carrot leaf where\r\nthey grow in water), and the stout, grooved, branching stem, from\r\ntwo to six feet tall, are its distinguishing characteristics. In\r\nthese umbels it will be noticed there are far more hermaphrodite,\r\nor two-sexed, florets (maturing their anthers first), than there\r\nare male ones; consequently quantities of unwelcome seed are set\r\nwith the help of small bees, wasps, and flies, which receive\r\ngenerous entertainment from July to October.\r\n\r\nThe MOCK BISHOP'S-WEED (Ptilimnium capillaceum), a slender,\r\ndelicate, dainty weed found chiefly in saltwater meadows from\r\nMassachusetts to Florida and around the Gulf coast to Texas, has\r\nvery finely dissected, fringy leaves and compound umbels two to\r\nfour inches across, of tiny white florets, with threadlike bracts\r\nbelow. It blooms throughout the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING DOGWOOD\r\n  (Cornus florida)  Dogwood family\r\n\r\nFlowers - (Apparently) large, white or pinkish, the four\r\nconspicuous parts simulating petals, notched at the top, being\r\nreally bracts of an involucre below the true flowers, clustered,\r\nin the center, which are very small, greenish yellow, 4-parted,\r\nperfect. Stem: A large shrub or small tree, wood hard, bark\r\nrough. Leaves: Opposite, oval, entire-edged, petioled, paler\r\nunderneath. Fruit: Clusters of egg-shaped scarlet berries, tipped\r\nwith the persistent calyx.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woodlands rocky thickets, wooded roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Florida, west to Ontario and Texas.\r\n\r\nHas Nature's garden a more decorative ornament than the flowering\r\ndogwood, whose spreading flattened branches whiten the woodland\r\nborders in May as if an untimely snowstorm had come down upon\r\nthem, and in autumn paint the landscape with glorious crimson,\r\nscarlet, and gold, dulled by comparison only with the clusters of\r\nvivid red berries among the foliage? Little wonder that\r\nnurserymen sell enormous numbers of these small trees to be\r\nplanted on lawns. The horrors of pompous monuments, urns, busts,\r\nshafts, angels, lambs, and long-drawn-out eulogies in stone in\r\nmany a cemetery are mercifully concealed in part by these boughs,\r\nladen with blossoms of heavenly purity.\r\n\r\n    \"Let dead names be eternized in dead stone,\r\n     But living names by living shafts be known.\r\n     Plant thou a tree whose leaves shall sing\r\n     Thy deeds and thee each fresh, recurrent spring.\"\r\n\r\nFit symbol of immortality! Even before the dogwood's leaves fall\r\nin autumn, the round buds for next year's bloom appear on the\r\ntwigs, to remain in consoling evidence all winter with the\r\nscarlet fruit. When the buds begin to swell in spring, the four\r\nreddish-purple, scale-like bracts expand, revealing a dozen or\r\nmore tiny green flowers clustered within for the large, white,\r\npetal-like parts, with notched, tinted, and puckered lips, into\r\nwhich these reddish bracts speedily develop, and which some of us\r\nhave mistaken for a corolla, are not petals at all - not the true\r\nflowers - merely appendages around the real ones, placed there,\r\nlike showy advertisements, to attract customers. Nectar, secreted\r\nin a disk on each minute ovary, is eagerly sought by little\r\nAndrena and other bees, besides flies and butterflies. Insects\r\ncrawling about these clusters, whose florets are all of one kind,\r\nget their heads and undersides dusted with pollen, which they\r\ntransfer as they suck. Hungry winter birds, which bolt the red\r\nfruit only when they can get no choicer fare, distribute the\r\nsmooth, indigestible stones far and wide.\r\n\r\nWhen the Massachusetts farmers think they hear the first brown\r\nthrasher in April advising them to plant their Indian corn,\r\nreassuringly calling, \"Drop it, drop it - cover it up, cover it\r\nup - pull it up, pull it up, pull it up\" (Thoreau), they look to\r\nthe dogwood flowers to confirm the thrasher's advice before\r\ntaking it.\r\n\r\nThe LOW or DWARF CORNEL, or BUNCHBERRY (C. canadensus) whose\r\nscaly stem does its best to attain a height of nine inches, bears\r\na whorl of from four to six oval, pointed, smooth leaves at the\r\nsummit. From the midst of this whorl comes a cluster of minute\r\ngreenish florets, encircled by four to six large, showy, white\r\npetal-like bracts, quite like a small edition of the flowering\r\ndogwood blossom. Tight clusters of round berries, that are lifted\r\nupward on a gradually lengthened peduncle after the flowers fade\r\n(May-July), brighten with vivid touches of scarlet shadowy, mossy\r\nplaces in cool, rich woods, where the dwarf cornels, with the\r\npartridge vine, twin flower, gold thread, and fern, form the most\r\ncharming of carpets.\r\n\r\nOther common dogwoods there are - shrubs from three to ten feet\r\nin height - which bear flat clusters of small white flowers\r\nwithout the showy petal-like bracts, imitating a corolla, as in\r\nthe two preceding species, but each little four-parted blossom\r\nattracting its miscellaneous crowd of benefactors by association\r\nwith dozens of its counterparts in a showy cyme. Because these\r\nflowers expand farther than the minute florets of the dwarf\r\ncornel or the flowering dogwood, and the sweets are therefore\r\nmore accessible, all the insects which fertilize them come to the\r\nshrub dogwoods too, and in addition very many beetles, to which\r\ntheir odor seems especially attractive. (\"Odore carabico o\r\nscarabeo\" - Delpino.) The ROUND-LEAVED CORNEL or DOGWOOD [now\r\nROUNDLEAF DOGWOOD] (C. circinata), found on shady hillsides, in\r\nopen woodlands, and roadside thickets - especially in rocky\r\ndistricts - from Nova Scotia to Virginia, and westward to Iowa,\r\nmay be known by its greenish, warty twigs; its broadly ovate, or\r\nround petioled, opposite leaves, short-tapering to a point, and\r\ndowny beneath; and, in May and June, by its small, flat, white\r\nflower-clusters about two inches across, that are followed by\r\nlight-blue (not edible) berries.\r\n\r\nEven more abundant is the SILKY CORNEL, KINNIKINNICK, or SWAMP\r\nDOGWOOD [now SILKY DOGWOOD] (C. amonum; C. sericca of Gray) found\r\nin low, wet ground, and beside streams, from Nebraska to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, south to Florida and north to New Brunswick. Its\r\ndull-reddish twigs, oval or oblong leaves, rounded at the base\r\nbut tapering to a point at the apex, and usually silky-downy with\r\nfine, brownish hairs underneath (to prevent the pores from\r\nclogging with vapors arising from its damp habitat); its rather\r\ncompact, flat clusters of white flowers from May to July, and its\r\nbluish berries are its distinguishing features. The Indians loved\r\nto smoke its bark for its alleged tonic effect.\r\n\r\nThe RED-OSIER CORNEL or DOGWOOD (C. stolonifera), which has\r\nspread, with the help of running shoots, through the soft soil of\r\nits moist retreats, over the British Possessions north of us and\r\nthroughout the United States from ocean to ocean, except at the\r\nextreme south, may be known by its bright purplish-red twigs; its\r\nopposite, slender, petioled leaves, rather abruptly pointed at\r\nthe apex, roughish on both sides, but white or nearly so beneath;\r\nits small, flat-topped white flower-clusters in June or July; and\r\nfinally, by its white or lead-colored fruit.\r\n\r\nIn good, rich, moist soil another white-fruited species, the\r\nPANICLED CORNEL or DOGWOOD (C. candidissima; C. paniculata of\r\nGray) rears its much-branched, smooth, gray stems. In May or June\r\nthe shrub is beautiful with numerous convex, loose clusters of\r\nwhite flowers at the ends of the twigs. So far do the stamens\r\ndiverge from the pistil that self-pollination is not likely; but\r\nan especially large number of the less specialized insects,\r\nseeking the freely exposed nectar, do all the necessary work as\r\nthey crawl about and fly from shrub to shrub. This species bears\r\ncomparatively long and narrow leaves, pale underneath. Its range\r\nis from Maine to the Carolinas and westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ALDER; SWEET PEPPERBUSH; ALDER-LEAVED CLETHRA\r\n  (Clethra alnifolia)  White Alder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very fragrant, white, about 1/3 in. across, borne in\r\nlong, narrow, upright, clustered spikes, with awl-shaped bracts.\r\nCalyx of 5 sepals; 5 longer petals; 10 protruding stamens, the\r\nstyle longest. Stem: A much-branched shrub, 3 to 10 ft. high.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, oblong or ovate, finely saw-edged above the\r\nmiddle at least, green on both sides, tapering at base into short\r\npetioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low, wet woodland and roadside thickets;\r\nswamps; beside slow streams; meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Chiefly near the coast, in States bordering the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nLike many another neglected native plant, the beautiful sweet\r\npepperbush improves under cultivation; and when the departed\r\nlilacs, syringa, snowball, and blossoming almond, found with\r\nalmost monotonous frequency in every American garden, leave a\r\nblank in the shrubbery at midsummer, these fleecy white spikes\r\nshould exhale their spicy breath about our homes. But wild\r\nflowers, like a prophet, may remain long without honor in their\r\nown country. This and a similar but more hairy species found in\r\nthe Alleghany region, the MOUNTAIN SWEET PEPPERBUSH (C.\r\nacuminata), with pointed leaves, pale beneath, and spreading or\r\ndrooping flower-spikes, go abroad to be appreciated. Planted\r\nbeside lakes and streams on noblemen's estates, how overpowering\r\nmust their fragrance be in the heavy, moisture-laden air of\r\nEngland! Even in our drier atmosphere, it hangs about the\r\nthickets like incense.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND-LEAVED PYROLA; PEAR-LEAVED, or FALSE WINTERGREEN; INDIAN or\r\nCANKER LETTUCE\r\n  (Pyrola rolundifolia)  Wintergreen family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very fragrant, white, in a spike; 6 to 20, nodding from\r\nan erect, bracted scape 6 to 20 in. high. Calyx 5-parted corolla,\r\nover 1/2 in. across, of 5 concave, obtuse petals 10 stamens,\r\nprotruding pistil, style curved, stigma 5-lobed. Leaves: All\r\nspreading from the base by margined petioles; shining leathery\r\ngreen, round or broadly oval, obtuse, 1 1/2 to 3 in. long,\r\npersistent through the winter.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open woods.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, west to Ohio and\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nDeliciously fragrant little flowers, nodding from an erect,\r\nslender stalk, when seen at a distance are often mistaken for\r\nlilies-of-the-valley growing wild. But closer inspection of the\r\nrounded, pearlike leaves in a cluster from the running root, and\r\nthe concave, not bell-shaped, white, waxen blossoms, with the\r\npistil protruding and curved, indicate the commonest of the\r\npyrolas. Some of its kin dwell in bogs and wet places, but this\r\nplant and the shin-leaf carpet drier woodland where dwarf\r\ncornels, partridge vines, pipsissewa, and goldthread weave their\r\ncharming patterns too. Certain of the lovely pyrola clan, whose\r\nblossoms range from greenish white, flesh-color, and pink to deep\r\npurplish rose, have so many features in common they were once\r\ncounted mere varieties of this round-leaved wintergreen - an\r\neasygoing classification broken up by later-day systematists, who\r\nnow rank the varieties as distinct species. It will be noticed\r\nthat all these flowers have their anthers erect in the bud but\r\nreversed at flowering time, each of the two sacs opening by a\r\npore which, in reality, is at the base of the sac, though by\r\nreversion it appears to be at the top. To these pores small bees\r\nand flies fasten their short lips to feed on pollen, some of\r\nwhich will be necessarily .jarred out on them as they struggle\r\nfor a foothold on the stamens, and will be carried by them to\r\nanother flower's protruding stigma, which impedes their entrance\r\npurposely to receive the imported pollen.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the old custom of clapping on a so-called\r\n\"shinplaster\" to every bruise, regardless of its location on the\r\nhuman body, a lovely little plant, whose leaves were once counted\r\na first aid to the injured, still suffers instead under an\r\nunlovely name. The SHIN-LEAF (P. elliptica) sends up a naked\r\nflower-stalk, scaly at the base, often with a bract midway, and\r\nbearing at the top from seven to fifteen very fragrant, nodding,\r\nwaxen, greenish-white blossoms, similar to the round-leaved\r\nwintergreen's. But on the thinner, dull, dark-green, upright\r\nleaves, with slight wavy indentations, scarcely to be called\r\nteeth, on the margins, their shorter leaf-stalks often reddish,\r\none chiefly depends to name this common plant. It is usually\r\nfound, in company with a few or many of its fellows, in rich\r\nwoodlands so far west as the Rocky Mountains, blooming from June\r\nto August, according to the climate of its wide range.\r\n\r\nWhen the little SERRATED or ONE-SIDED WINTERGREEN (P. secunda)\r\nfirst sends up its slender raceme in June or July, it is erect\r\nbut presently the small, greenish-white flowers, opening\r\nirregularly along one side, appear to weigh it downward into a\r\ncurve. Usually several bracted scapes rise from a running,\r\nbranched rootstock, to a height of from three to (rarely) ten\r\ninches above a cluster of basal evergreen leaves. These latter\r\nare rather thin, oval, slightly pointed, wavy or slightly\r\nsaw-edged, the midrib prominent above and below. A peculiarity of\r\nthe flowers is, that their petals are partially welded together\r\ninto little bells, with the clapper (alias the straight green\r\npistil) protruding, and the stamens united around its base. After\r\nthe blossoms have been fertilized, the tiny, round,\r\nfive-scalloped seed capsules, with the pistil still protruding,\r\nremain in evidence for months, as is usual in the pyrola clan.\r\nSmall as the plant is, it has managed to distribute itself over\r\nEurope, Asia, and the woods and thickets of our own land from\r\nLabrador to Alaska, southward to California, Mexico, and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\nAnother little globe-trotter, so insignificant in size that one\r\nis apt to overlook it until its surprisingly large blossom\r\nappears in June or July, is the ONE-FLOWERED WINTERGREEN (Moneses\r\nuniflora), found in cool northern woods, especially about the\r\nroots of pines, in such yielding soil as will enable its long\r\nstem to run just below the surface. ONE-FLOWERED PYROLA, it is\r\noften called, although it belongs to a genus all its own. A\r\nboldly curved stalk, like a miniature Bo-peep crook, enables the\r\nsolitary white or pink widely open flower to droop from the tip,\r\nthus protecting its precious contents from rain, and from\r\ncrawling pilferers, to whom a pendent blossom is as inaccessible\r\nas a hanging bird's nest is to snakes. This five-petalled waxen\r\nflower, half an inch across or over, with its ten white,\r\nyellow-tipped stamens, and green, club-shaped pistil projecting\r\nfrom a conspicuous round ovary, never nods more than six inches\r\nabove the ground, often at only half that height. When there is\r\nno longer need for the stalk to crook, that is to say, after the\r\nflower has begun to fruit, it gradually straightens itself out so\r\nthat the little seed capsule, with the style and its five-lobed\r\nstigma still persistent, is held erect. The thin, rounded, finely\r\nnotched leaves, measuring barely an inch in length, are clustered\r\nin whorls next the ground. Whether one comes upon colonies of\r\nthis gregarious little plant, or upon a lonely straggler, the\r\n\"single delight\" (moneses), as Dr. Gray called the solitary\r\nflower, is one of the joys of a tramp through the summer woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN PIPE; ICE-PLANT; GHOST-FLOWER; CORPSE-PLANT\r\n  (Monotropa uniflora)  Indian-pipe family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Solitary, smooth, waxy, white (rarely pink),\r\noblong-bell shaped, nodding from the tip of a fleshy, white,\r\nscaly scape 4 to 10 in. tall. Calyx of 2 to 4 early-falling white\r\nsepals; 4 or 5 oblong, scale-like petals; 8 or 10 tawny, hairy\r\nstamens; a 5-celled, egg-shaped ovary, narrowed into the short,\r\nthick style. Leaves: None. Roots: A mass of brittle fibers, from\r\nwhich usually a cluster of several white scapes arises. Fruit: A\r\n5-valved, many-seeded, erect capsule.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Heavily shaded, moist, rich woods, especially\r\nunder oak and pine trees.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Almost throughout temperate North America.\r\n\r\nColorless in every part, waxy, cold, and clammy, Indian pipes\r\nrise like a company of wraiths in the dim forest that suits them\r\nwell. Ghoulish parasites, uncanny saprophytes, for their matted\r\nroots prey either on the juices of living plants or on the\r\ndecaying matter of dead ones, how weirdly beautiful and\r\ndecorative, they are! The strange plant grows also in Japan, and\r\none can readily imagine how fascinated the native artists must be\r\nby its chaste charms.\r\n\r\nYet to one who can read the faces of flowers, as it were, it\r\nstands a branded sinner. Doubtless its ancestors were\r\nindustrious, honest creatures, seeking their food in the soil,\r\nand digesting it with the help of leaves filled with good green\r\nmatter (chlorophyll) on which virtuous vegetable life depends;\r\nbut some ancestral knave elected to live by piracy, to drain the\r\nalready digested food of its neighbors; so the Indian pipe\r\ngradually lost the use of parts for which it had need no longer,\r\nuntil we find it today without color and its leaves degenerated\r\ninto mere scaly bracts. Nature has manifold ways of illustrating\r\nthe parable of the ten pieces of money. Spiritual law is natural\r\nlaw: \"From him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken\r\naway.\" Among plants as among souls, there are all degrees of\r\nbacksliders. The foxglove, which is guilty of only sly, petty\r\nlarceny, wears not the equivalent of the striped suit and the\r\nshaved head; nor does the mistletoe, which steals crude food from\r\nthe tree, but still digests it itself, and is therefore only a\r\ndingy yellowish green. Such plants, however, as the broomrape,\r\npinesap, beechdrops, the Indian pipe, and the dodder - which\r\nmarks the lowest stage of degradation of them all - appear among\r\ntheir race branded with the mark of crime as surely as was Cain.\r\n\r\nNo wonder this degenerate hangs its head; no wonder it grows\r\nblack with shame on being picked, as if its wickedness were only\r\njust then discovered! To think that a plant related on one side\r\nto many of the loveliest flowers in Nature's garden- - the\r\nazaleas, laurels, rhododendrons, and the bonny heather - and on\r\nthe other side to the modest but no less charming wintergreen\r\ntribe, should have fallen from grace to such a depth! Its\r\nscientific name, meaning a flower once turned, describes it\r\nduring only a part of its career. When the minute, innumerable\r\nseeds begin to form, it proudly raises its head erect, as if\r\nconscious that it had performed the one righteous act of its\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABRADOR TEA\r\n  (Ledum Groenlandicum; L. latifolium of Gray)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, 5-parted, 1/2 in. across or less, numerous,\r\nborne in terminal, umbellate clusters rising from scaly, sticky\r\nbud-bracts. Stem: A compact shrub 1 to 4 ft. high, resinous, the\r\ntwigs woolly-hairy. Leaves: Alternate, thick, evergreen, oblong,\r\nobtuse, small, dull above, rusty-woolly beneath, the margins\r\ncurled.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, bogs, wet mountain woods. Flowering\r\nSeason - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Greenland to Pennsylvania, west to Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nWhoever has used the homeopathic lotion distilled from the leaves\r\nof Ledum palustre, a similar species found at the far North,\r\nknows the tea-like fragrance given forth by the leaves of this\r\ncommon shrub when crushed in a warm hand. But because the\r\nhomeopathists claim that like is cured by like, are we to assume\r\nthat these little bushes, both of which afford a soothing lotion,\r\nalso irritate and poison? It may be; for they are next of kin to\r\nthe azaleas, laurels, and rhododendrons, known to be injurious\r\nsince Xenophon's day. At the end of May, when the Labrador tea is\r\nwhite with abundant flower clusters, one cannot but wonder why so\r\ndesirable an acquisition is never seen in men's gardens here\r\namong its relatives. Over a hundred years ago the dense, compact\r\nlittle shrub was taken to England to adorn sunny bog gardens on\r\nfine estates. Doubtless the leaves have woolly mats underneath\r\nfor the reason given in reference to the Steeple-bush.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD ROSEMARY; MARCH HOLY ROSE; WATER ANDROMEDA; MOORWORT\r\n  (Andromeda Polifolia)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or pink-tinted, small, round, tubular, 5-toothed\r\nat the tip; drooping from curved footstalks in few-flowered\r\nterminal umbels. Calyx deeply 5-parted; 10 bearded stamens; style\r\nlike a column. Stem: A sparingly branched, dwarf shrub, 6 in. to\r\n3 ft. tall. Leaves: Linear to lance-shape, evergreen, dark and\r\nglossy above, with a prominent white bloom underneath, the\r\nmargins curled.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool bogs, wet places.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania and Michigan, far northward.\r\n\r\nOnly a delightfully imaginative optimist like Linnaeus could feel\r\nthe enthusiasm he expended on this dwarf shrub, with its little,\r\nwhite, heath-like flowers, which most of us consider rather\r\ninsignificant, if the truth be told. But then the blossoms he\r\nfound in Lapland must have been much pinker than any seen in\r\nAmerican swamps, since they reminded him of \"a fine female\r\ncomplexion.\"\r\n\r\n\"This plant is always fixed on some little turfy hillock in the\r\nmidst of the swamps,\" he wrote, \"just as Andromeda herself was\r\nchained to a rock in the sea, which bathed her feet as the fresh\r\nwater does the roots of this plant.... As the distressed virgin\r\ncast down her blushing face through excessive affliction, so does\r\nthis rosy-colored flower hang its head, growing paler and paler\r\ntill it withers away.\" Under the old go-as-you-please method of\r\napplying scientific names, most of this shrub's relatives shared\r\nwith it the name of the fair maid whom Perseus rescued from the\r\ndragons.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful, low-growing STAGGERBUSH (Pieris Mariana) has its\r\nsmall, cylindric, five-parted, white or pink-tinted flowers\r\nclustered at intervals along one side of the upright, nearly\r\nleafless, smooth, dark-dotted branches of the preceding year.\r\nWhen the glossy oval leaves, black dotted beneath, are freshly\r\nput forth in early summer - for the shrub is not strictly an\r\nevergreen, however late the old leaves may cling - it is said\r\nthat stupid sheep and calves, which find them irresistibly\r\nattractive, stagger about from their poisonous effect just as\r\nthey do after feeding on this shrub's relative the Lambkill\r\n(q.v.). In sandy soil from southern New England to Florida,\r\nrarely far inland, one finds the staggerbush in bloom from May to\r\nJuly. On the dry plains of Long Island, where it is common\r\nindeed, it appears a not unworthy relative of the FETTERBUSH\r\n(Pieris fioribunda), that exquisite little evergreen with\r\nquantities of small white urns drooping along its twigs, which\r\nnurserymen acquire from the mountains of our Southern States to\r\nadorn garden shrubbery at home and abroad. Mr. William Robinson,\r\nin his delightful book, \"The English Flower Garden\" (a book, by\r\nthe way, that Rudyard Kipling reads as the Puritan read his\r\nBible), counts this fetterbush among the \"indispensables.\"\r\n\r\nMuch taller than the preceding dwarfs is the COMMON PRIVET\r\nANDROMEDA found in swamps and low ground from New England to the\r\nGulf and in the southwest (Xolisma ligustrina). Whoever has seen\r\nthe privet almost universally grown in hedges is familiar with\r\nthe general aspect of this much-branched shrub. Most farmers'\r\nboys know the Andromeda's mock May-apple, a hollow, stringy\r\ngrowth of insect origin, which they are not likely to confuse\r\nwith the pulpy, juicy apple found on the closely related azaleas\r\n(q.v.). Abundant terminal spike-like or branched clusters of\r\nwhite, globular, four or five parted flowers in close array,\r\nattract quantities of bees from the end of May to early July,\r\nnotwithstanding each individual flower measures barely an eighth\r\nof an inch across. We have seen the fine hair-triggers which\r\nother members of this same family, the beautiful pink laurels\r\n(q.v.), have set to be sprung by an incoming visitor. Now this\r\nAndromeda, and similarly several of its immediate kin, have a\r\nquite different, but equally effective, method of throwing pollen\r\non its friends who come to call. When one of the little banded\r\nbees clings, as he must, to the tiny flower scarce half his size,\r\nthrusting his tongue obliquely through the globe's narrow opening\r\nto reach the nectar, suddenly a shower of pollen is inhospitably\r\nthrown upon him from within. In probing between the ring of\r\nanthers (that are pressed against the style by the S-shaped\r\ncurvature of the filaments so as to retain the pollen), he needs\r\nmust displace some of them and release the vitalizing dust\r\nthrough the large terminal pores in the anther-sacs. Is he\r\ndiscouraged by such rough treatment? Not at all. Off he flies to\r\nanother Andromeda blossom, and leaves some of the dust with which\r\nhe is powdered on the sticky stigma that impedes his entrance,\r\nbefore precipitating a fresh shower as he sips another reward.\r\nThe straight column-like pistil, stigmatic on its tip only,\r\nallows the flower's own pollen to slide harmlessly down its\r\nsides. How exquisite are the most minute adjustments of floral\r\nmechanism! Is it possible for one to remain an agnostic after the\r\nevidences even the flowers show us of infinite wisdom and love?\r\n\r\nAnother denizen of swamps and low ground, next of kin to the\r\ntrailing arbutus, is the LEATHERLEAF, or DWARF CASSANDRA\r\n(Chamaedaphne calyculata), a modest little shrub, its stiff,\r\nslender branches plentifully set with thick oblong leaves that\r\ngrow gradually smaller the higher they go, and when young are\r\ndensely covered with minute scurfy scales. Sometimes before the\r\nsnow has melted in April, the leafy terminal shoots are hung with\r\nmultitudes of little waxy-white, cylindric, typical heath flowers\r\nonly about a quarter of an inch long, each nodding from a leaf\r\naxil, and the whole forming one-sided racemes. But as the shrub\r\nranges from Newfoundland to Georgia, and westward to Illinois,\r\nBritish Columbia, and Alaska, some people find it blooming even\r\nin July.\r\nMythological names were evidently in high favor among the\r\nbotanists who labeled the genuses comprising the heath family:\r\nPhyllodoce, the sea-nymph; Cassiope, mother of Andromeda;\r\nLeucothoe; Andromeda herself; Pieris, a name sometimes applied to\r\nthe Muses from their supposed abode at Pieria, Thessaly; and\r\nCassandra, daughter of Priam, the prophetess who was shut up in a\r\nmad-house because she prophesied the ruin of Troy - these names\r\nare as familiar to the student of this group of shrubs today as\r\nthey were to the devout Greeks in the brave days of old.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEPING WINTERGREEN; CHECKERBERRY; PARTRIDGE-BERRY; MOUNTAIN\r\nTEA; GROUND TEA; DEER, BOX, or SPICE BERRY\r\n  (Gaultheria procumbens)  Heath family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, small, usually solitary, nodding from a leaf\r\naxil. Corolla rounded bell-shape, 5-toothed; calyx 5-parted,\r\npersistent; 10 included stamens, their anther-sacs opening by a\r\npore at the top. Stem: Creeping above or below ground, its\r\nbranches 2 to 6 in. high. Leaves: Mostly clustered at top of\r\nbranches; alternate, glossy, leathery, evergreen, much darker\r\nabove than underneath, oval to oblong, very finely saw-edged; the\r\nentire plant aromatic. Fruit: Bright red, mealy, spicy,\r\nberry-like; ripe in October.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool woods, especially under evergreens.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Georgia, westward to Michigan and\r\nManitoba.\r\n\r\nHowever truly the poets may make us feel the spirit of Nature in\r\ntheir verse, can many be trusted when it comes to the letter of\r\nnatural science? \"Where camels arch their cool, dark boughs o'er\r\nbeds of wintergreen,\" wrote Bryant; yet it is safe to say that\r\nnine colonies of this hardy little plant out of every ten he saw\r\nwere under evergreen trees, not dogwoods. When the July sun melts\r\nthe fragrance out of the pines high overhead, and the dim, cool\r\nforest aisles are more fragrant with commingled incense from a\r\nhundred natural censers than any stone cathedral's, the\r\nwintergreen's little waxy bells hang among the glossy leaves that\r\nform their aromatic carpet. On such a day, in such a resting\r\nplace, how one thrills with the consciousness that it is good to\r\nbe alive!\r\n\r\nOmnivorous children who are addicted to birch-chewing, prefer\r\nthese tender yellow-green leaves tinged with red, when newly put\r\nforth in June - \"Youngsters\" rural New Englanders call them then.\r\nIn some sections a kind of tea is steeped from the leaves, which\r\nalso furnish the old-fashioned embrocation, wintergreen oil. Late\r\nin the year the glossy bronze carpet of old leaves dotted over\r\nwith vivid red \"berries\" invites much trampling by hungry birds\r\nand beasts, especially deer and bears, not to mention well-fed\r\nhumans. Coveys of Bob Whites and packs of grouse will plunge\r\nbeneath the snow for fare so delicious as this spicy, mealy fruit\r\nthat hangs on the plant till spring, of course for the benefit of\r\njust such colonizing agents as they. Quite a different species,\r\nbelonging to another family, bears the true Partridgeberry,\r\nalbeit the wintergreen shares with it a number of popular names.\r\nIn a strict sense neither of these plants produces a berry; for\r\nthe fruit of the true partridge[berry] vine (Mitchella repens) is\r\na double drupe, or stone bearer, each half containing four hard,\r\nseed-like nutlets; while the wintergreen's so called berry is\r\nmerely the calyx grown thick, fleshy, and gaily colored - only a\r\ncoating for the five-celled ovary that contains the minute seeds.\r\nLittle baskets of wintergreen berries bring none too high prices\r\nin the fancy fruit and grocery shops when we calculate how many\r\ncharming plants such unnatural use of them sacrifices.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the wintergreen is the RED BEARBERRY,\r\nKINNIKINIC, BEAR'S GRAPE, FOXBERRY or MEALBERRY, as it is\r\nvariously called (Arctostaphylos-uva-ursi = bearberry). Trailing\r\nits spreading branches over sandy ground, rocky hillsides and\r\nsteeps until it sometimes forms luxuriant mats, it closely\r\nresembles its cousin the arbutus in its manner of growth, and has\r\nbeen mistaken for it by at least one poet. But its tiny, rounded,\r\nurn-shaped flowers, which come in May and June, are white, not\r\nsalver form and pink; the entire plant is not rusty-hairy; the\r\ndark little leathery evergreen leaves are spatulate, and,\r\nmoreover, it bears small but abundant clusters of round,\r\nberry-like fruit, an attainment the arbutus still struggles for,\r\nbut cannot yet reach. Bumblebees are the flower's chief\r\nbenefactors. Game fowl, especially grouse, but many other birds\r\ntoo, and various animals which are glad to add the clusters of\r\nsmooth red bearberries to their scanty winter menu, however\r\ninsipid and dry they may be, have distributed the seed from\r\nLabrador across Arctic America to Alaska, southward to\r\nPennsylvania, Illinois, Nebraska, and California. How plants do\r\ncompel insects, birds, and beasts to work for them! The entire\r\nplant is astringent, and has been used in medicine; also by\r\nleather dressers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK or HIGH-BUSH HUCKLEBERRY; WHORTLEBERRY [now TALL\r\nHUCKLEBERRY]\r\n  (Gaylussacia resinosa)  Huckleberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White and pink, pale or deep, small, cylindric,\r\nbell-shaped. 5-parted, borne in 1-sided racemes from the sides of\r\nthe stiff, grayish branches. Stem: A shrub to 3 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, oval to oblong, firm, entire edged, green on both\r\nsides, dotted underneath with resinous spots, especially when\r\nyoung. Fruit: A round, black, bloomless, sweet, berry-like drupe,\r\ncontaining 10 seed-like nutlets, in each of which is a solitary\r\nseed. Ripe, July-August.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, sandy soil, thickets, open woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Georgia, west to Manitoba and\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nThis common huckleberry, oftener found in pies and muffins by the\r\naverage observer than in its native thickets, unfortunately\r\nripens in fly-time, when the squeamish boarder in the summer\r\nhotel does well to carefully scrutinize each mouthful. For the\r\nabundant fruit set on huckleberry bushes, as on so many others,\r\nwe are indebted chiefly to the lesser bees, which, receiving the\r\npollen jarred out from the terminal chinks in the anther-sacs on\r\ntheir undersides as they cling, transfer it to the protruding\r\nstigmas of the next blossom visited. After fertilization, when\r\nthe now useless corolla falls, the ten-celled ovary is protected\r\nby the encircling calyx, that grows rapidly, swells, fills with\r\njuice, and takes on color until it and the ovary together become\r\na so-called berry, whose seeds are dropped far and wide by birds\r\nand beasts. \"The name huckleberry, which is applied\r\nindiscriminately to several species of Vaccinium and\r\nGaylussacia,\" says Professor L. H. Bailey, \"is evidently a\r\ncorruption of whortleberry. Whortleberry is in turn a corruption\r\nof myrtleberry. In the Middle Ages, the true myrtleberry was\r\nlargely used in cookery and medicine, but the European bilberry\r\nor Vaccinium so closely resembled it that the name was\r\ntransferred to the latter plant, a circumstance commemorated by\r\nLinnaeus in the giving of the name Vaccinium Myrtillus to the\r\nbilberry. From the European whortleberry the name was transferred\r\nto the similar American plants.\"\r\n\r\nA common little bushy shrub, not a true blueberry, found in moist\r\nwoods, especially beside streams, from New England to the Gulf\r\nStates, and westward to Ohio, is the BLUE TANGLE, TANGLEBERRY, or\r\nDANGLEBERRY [now TALL HUCKLEBERRY (G. frondosa). It bears a few\r\ntiny greenish-pink flowers dangling from pedicels in loose\r\nracemes, and corresponding clusters of most delicious, sweet,\r\ndark-blue berries, covered with hoary bloom in midsummer. The\r\nabundant resinous leaves on its slender gray branches are pale\r\nand hoary beneath. The caterpillars of several species of sulphur\r\nbutterflies (Colias) feed on huckleberry leaves.\r\n\r\nTo a genus quite distinct from the huckleberries belong the true\r\nblueberries, however interchangeably these names are misused.\r\nPerhaps the first species to send its fruit to market in June and\r\nJuly is the DWARF, SUGAR, or LOW-BUSH BLUEBERRY (Vaccinium\r\nPennsylvanicum), sometimes six inches tall, never more than\r\ntwenty inches. It prefers sandy or rocky soil from southern New\r\nJersey far northward, and west to Illinois. Shortly after the\r\nsmall, bell-shaped, white or pink flowers, that grow in racemes\r\non the ends or sides of the angular, green, warty branches of\r\nnearly all blueberry bushes, have been fertilized by bees, this\r\nspecies forms an especially sweet berry with a bloom on its blue\r\nsurface. The alternate oblong leaves, smooth and green on both\r\nsides, are very finely and sharply saw-edged.\r\n\r\nAnother, and perhaps the commonest, as it is the finest, species,\r\nwhose immature fruit is still green or red when the dwarf's is\r\nripe, is the HIGH-BUSH, TALL, or SWAMP BLUEBERRY (V. corymbosum),\r\nfound in low wet ground from Virginia westward to the\r\nMississippi, and very far north. Only the bees and their kind\r\nconcern themselves with the little cylindric, five-parted,\r\nnectar-bearing flowers. These appear with the oblong, entire\r\nleaves, paler below than above. But thousands of fruit sellers\r\nand housekeepers depend on the sweet blueberries (with a pleasant\r\nacid flavor) as a market staple. In July and August, even in\r\nearly September, the berries arrive in the cities. One picker in\r\nNew Jersey claims to have filled an entire crate with the fruit\r\nof a single bush.\r\n\r\nThe DEERBERRY, BUCKBERRY, or SQUAW HUCKLEBERRY (V. stainineum),\r\ncommon in dry woods and thickets from Maine and Minnesota to the\r\nGulf States, puts forth quantities of small greenish-white,\r\nyellow, or purplish-green, open bell-shaped, five-cleft flowers,\r\nnodding from hair-like pedicels in graceful, leafy-bracted\r\nracemes. Both the tips of the stamens and the style protrude like\r\na fringe. No creature, unless hard pressed by hunger, could\r\nrelish the greenish or yellowish berries. This is a low-growing,\r\nspreading shrub, with firm oval or oblong tapering leaves, dull\r\nabove, and pale, sometimes even hoary, underneath.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREEPING SNOWBERRY\r\n  (Chiogenes hispidula)  Huckleberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Very small, white, few, solitary, nodding on short,\r\ncurved peduncles from the leaf axils. Calyx 2-bracted, 4-cleft;\r\ncorolla a short 4-cleft bell; 8 short stamens, each anther sac\r\nopening by a slit to the middle; 1 pistil, the ovary 4-celled.\r\nStem: Creeping along the ground, the slender, leafy, hairy\r\nbranches 3 to 12 in. long. Leaves: Evergreen, alternate,\r\n2-ranked, oval, very small, dark and glossy above, coated with\r\nstiff, rusty hairs underneath, the edges curled. Fruit: A\r\nsnow-white, round or oval, mealy, aromatic berry; ripe\r\nAugust-September.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool bogs; low, moist, mossy woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina and Michigan northward to the\r\nBritish Possessions.\r\n\r\nAllied on the one hand to the cranberry, so often found with it\r\nin the cool northern peat bogs, and on the other to the delicious\r\nblueberries, this \"snow-born\" berry, which appears on no dining\r\ntable, nevertheless furnishes many a good meal to hungry birds\r\nand fagged pedestrians. Both the pretty foliage and the fruit\r\nhave the refreshing flavor of sweet birch.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYXIE; FLOWERING MOSS; PINE-BARREN BEAUTY\r\n  (Pyxidanthera barbulata)  Diapensia family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Abundant, white, or sometimes pink, about 1/4 in.\r\nacross, 5-parted, solitary, seated at tips of branches. Stem:\r\nProstrate, creeping, much branched, the main branches often 1 ft.\r\nlong, very leafy, growing in mat-like patches. Leaves: Moss-like,\r\nvery narrow, pointed, seated on stem, and overlapping like\r\nscales, on upper part of branches.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry sandy soil; pine barrens.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - New Jersey, south to North Carolina.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, this creeping, tufted, mat-like little plant is\r\nbotanically known as a shrub, yet it is lower than many mosses,\r\nand would seem to the untrained eye to be certainly of their kin.\r\nIn earliest spring, when Lenten penitents, jaded with the\r\nwinter's frivolities in the large cities, seek the salubrious\r\npine lands of southern New Jersey and beyond, they are amazed and\r\ndelighted to find the abundant little evergreen mounds of pyxie\r\nalready starred with blossoms. The dense mossy cushions,\r\nplentifully sprinkled with pink buds and white flowers, are so\r\nbeautiful, one cannot resist taking a few tuffets home to\r\nnaturalize in the rock garden. Planted in a mixture of clear sand\r\nand leaf-mould, with exposure to the morning sun, pyxie will\r\nsmile up at us from under our very windows, spring after spring,\r\nwith increased charms; whereas the arbutus, that untamable\r\nwildling, carried home from the pinewoods at the same time, soon\r\nsulks itself to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARFLOWER; CHICKWEED-WINTERGREEN; STAR ANEMONE\r\n  (Trientalis Americana)  Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White, solitary, or a few rising on slender, wiry\r\nfoot-stalks above a whorl of leaves. Calyx of 5 to 9 (usually 7)\r\nnarrow sepals. Corolla wheel-shaped, 1/2 in. across or less,\r\ndeeply cut into (usually) 7 tapering, spreading, petal-like\r\nsegments. Stem: A long horizontal rootstock, sending up smooth\r\nstem-like branches 3 to 9 in. high, usually with a scale or two\r\nbelow. (Trientalis = one-third of a foot, the usual height of a\r\nplant.) Leaves: 5 to 10, in a whorl at summit; thin, tapering at\r\nboth ends, of unequal size, 1 1/2 to 4 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist shade of woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - From Virginia and Illinois far north.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs any other blossom poised quite so airily above its whorl of\r\nleaves as the delicate, frosty-white little starflower? It is\r\nnone of the anemone kin, of course, in spite of one of its\r\nmisleading folk names; but only the wind-flower has a similar\r\nlightness and grace. No nectar rewards the small bee and fly\r\nvisitors; they get pollen only. Those coming from older blossoms\r\nto a newly opened one leave some of the vitalizing dust clinging\r\nto them on the moist and sticky stigma, which will wither to\r\nprevent self-fertilization before the flower's own curved anthers\r\nmature and shed their grains. Sometimes, when the blossoms do not\r\nrun on schedule time, or the insects are not flying in stormy\r\nweather, this well laid plan may gang a-gley. An occasional lapse\r\nmatters little; it is perpetual self-fertilization that Nature\r\nabhors.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN HEMP: AMY-ROOT\r\n  (Apocynum cannabinum)  Dogbane family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish white, about 1/4 in. across, on short\r\npedicels, in dense clusters at ends of branches and from the\r\naxils. Calyx of 5 segments; corolla nearly erect, bell-shaped,\r\n5-lobed, with 5 small triangular appendages alternating with the\r\nstamens within its tube. Stem: 1 to 4 ft. high, branching,\r\nsmooth, often dull reddish, from a deep, vertical root. Leaves:\r\nOpposite, entire, 2 to 6 in. long, mostly oblong, abruptly\r\npointed, variable. Fruit: A pair of slender pods, the numerous\r\nseeds tipped with tufts of hairs.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Gravelly soil, banks of streams, low fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Almost throughout the United States and British\r\nPossessions.\r\n\r\nInstead of setting a trap to catch flies and hold them by the\r\ntongue in a vise-like grip until death alone releases them, as\r\nits heartless sister the spreading dogbane does (q.v.), this\r\nawkward, rank herb lifts clusters of smaller, less conspicuous,\r\nbut innocent, flowers, with nectar secreted in rather shallow\r\nreceptacles, that even short-tongued insects may feast without\r\nharm. Honey and mining bees, among others; wasps and flies in\r\nvariety, and great numbers of the spangled fritillary (Argynnis\r\ncybele) and the banded hair-streak (Thecla calanus) among the\r\nbutterfly tribe; destructive bugs and beetles attracted by the\r\nwhite color, a faint odor, and liberal entertainment, may be seen\r\nabout the clusters. Many visitors are useless pilferers, no\r\ndoubt; but certainly the bees which depart with pollen masses\r\ncemented to their lips or tongues, to leave them in the stigmatic\r\ncavities of the next blossoms their heads enter, pay a fair price\r\nfor all they get.\r\n\r\n>From the fact that Indians used to substitute this very common\r\nplant's tough fiber for hemp in making their fishnets, mats,\r\nbaskets, and clothing, came its popular name; and from their use\r\nof the juices to poison mangy old dogs about their camps, its\r\nscientific one.\r\n\r\nWHORLED or GREEN-FLOWERED MILKWEED\r\n  (Asclepias verticillata)  Milkweed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or greenish, on short pedicels, in several small\r\nterminal clusters. Calyx inferior; corolla deeply 5-parted, the\r\noblong segments turned back; a 5-parted, erect crown of hooded\r\nnectaries between them and the stamens, each shorter than the\r\nincurved horn within. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2 ft. tall, simple or\r\nsparingly branched, hairy, leafy to summit, containing milky\r\njuice. Leaves: In upright groups, very narrow, almost\r\nthread-like, from 3 to 7 in each whorl. Fruit: 2 smooth, narrow,\r\nspindle-shaped, upright pods, the seeds attached to silky fluff;\r\n1 pod usually abortive.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, hills, uplands.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Maine and far westward, south to Florida and\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nIn describing the common milkweed (q.v.), so many statements were\r\nmade that apply quite as truly to this far daintier and more\r\nethereal species, the reader is referred back to the pink and\r\nmagenta section. Compared with some of its rank-growing, heavy\r\nrelatives, how exquisite is this little denizen of the uplands,\r\nwith its whorls of needle-like leaves set at intervals along a\r\nslender swaying stem! The entire plant, with its delicate foliage\r\nand greenish-white umbels of flowers, rather suggests a member of\r\nthe carrot tribe; and much the same class of small-sized,\r\nshort-tongued visitors come to seek its accessible nectar as we\r\nfind about the parsnips, for example. When little bees alight -\r\nand these are the truest benefactors, however frequently larger\r\nbees, wasps, flies, and even the almost useless butterflies come\r\naround - their feet slip about within the low crown to find a\r\nsecure lodging. As they rise to fly away after sucking, the\r\npollen masses which have attached themselves to the hairs on the\r\nlower part of their legs are drawn out, to be transferred to\r\nother blossoms, perhaps today, perhaps not for a fortnight.\r\nAnnoying as they may be, it is very rarely, indeed, that an\r\ninsect can rid itself of the pollen masses carried from either\r\norchids or milkweeds, except by the method Nature intended; and\r\nit is not until the long-suffering bee is outrageously loaded\r\nthat he attains his greatest usefulness to milkweed blossoms. \"Of\r\nninety-two specimens bearing corpuscula of Asclepias\r\nverticillata,\" says Professor Robertson, \"eighty-eight have them\r\non hairs alone, and four on the hairs and claws.\" And again: \"As\r\nfar as the mere application of pollen to an insect is concerned,\r\na flower with loose pollen has the advantage. But the advantage\r\nis on the side of Asclepias after the insect is loaded with it.\r\nIt is only a general rule that insects keep to flowers of a\r\nparticular species on their honey and pollen gathering\r\nexpeditions. If a bee dusted with loose pollen visits flowers of\r\nanother species, it will not long retain pollen in sufficient\r\nquantity to effectually fertilize flowers of the original\r\nspecies. On the other hand, if an insect returns at any time\r\nduring the day, or even after a few days, to the species of\r\nAsclepias from which it got a load of pollinia, it may bring with\r\nit all or most of the pollinia which it has carried from the\r\nfirst plants visited. The firmness with which the pollinia keep\r\ntheir hold on the insect is one of the best adaptations for\r\ncross-fertilization.\"\r\n\r\nAnts, the worst pilferers of nectar extant, find the hairy stem\r\nof the whorled milkweed, as well as its sticky juice, most\r\ndiscouraging, if not fatal, obstacles to climbing. How daintily\r\nthe goldfinch picks at the milkweed pods and sets adrift the\r\nseeds attached to silky aeronautic fluff!\r\n\r\nWILD POTATO-VINE; MAN-OF-THE-EARTH; MECHA-MECK\r\n  (Ipomoea pandurata)  Morning-glory family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Funnel form, wide-spread, 2 to 3 in. long, pure white\r\nor pinkish purple inside the throat; the peduncles 1 to 5\r\nflowered. Stem: Trailing over the ground or weakly twining, 2 to\r\n12 ft. long. Leaves: Heart, fiddle, or halbert shaped (rarely\r\n3-lobed), on slender petioles. Root: Enormous, fleshy.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, sandy or gravelly fields or hills.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Ontario, Michigan, and Texas, east to the Atlantic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nNo one need be told that this flaring, trumpet-shaped flower is\r\nnext of kin to the morning-glory that clambers over the trellises\r\nof countless kitchen porches, and escapes back to Nature's garden\r\nwhenever it can. When the ancestors of these blossoms welded\r\ntheir five petals into a solid deep bell, which still shows on\r\nits edges the trace of five once separate parts, they did much to\r\nprotect their precious contents from rain; but some additional\r\nprotection was surely needed against the little interlopers not\r\nadapted to fertilize the flower, which could so easily crawl down\r\nits tube. Doubtless the hairs on the base of the filaments,\r\nbetween which certain bumblebees and other long-tongued\r\nbenefactors can easily penetrate to suck the nectar secreted in a\r\nfleshy disk below, act as a stockade to little would-be\r\npilferers. The color in the throat serves as a pathfinder to the\r\ndeep-hidden sweets. How pleasant the way is made for such insects\r\nas a flower must needs encourage! For these the perennial wild\r\npotato vine keeps open house far later in the day than its annual\r\nrelatives. Professor Robertson says it is dependent mainly upon\r\ntwo bees, Entechnia taurea and Xenoglossa ipomoeae, the latter\r\nits namesake.\r\n\r\nOne has to dig deep to find the huge, fleshy, potato-like root\r\nfrom which the vine derived its name of man-of-the-earth. Such a\r\nstorehouse of juices is surely necessary in the dry soil where\r\nthe wild potato lives.\r\n\r\nHappily, the COMMON MORNING-GLORY (I. purpurea)  - the\r\nConvolvulus major of seedsmen's catalogues - has so commonly\r\nescaped from cultivation in the eastern half of the United States\r\nand Canada as now to deserve counting among our wild flowers,\r\nalbeit South America is its true home. Surely no description of\r\nthis commonest of all garden climbers is needed; everyone has an\r\nopportunity to watch how the bees cross-fertilize it.\r\n\r\nThe vine has a special interest because of Darwin's illuminating\r\nexperiments upon it when he planted six self-fertilized seeds and\r\nsix seeds fertilized with the pollen brought from flowers on a\r\ndifferent vine, on opposite sides of the same pot. Vines produced\r\nby the former reached an average height of five feet four inches,\r\nwhereas the cross-pollenized seed sent its stems up two feet\r\nhigher, and produced very many more flowers. If so marked a\r\nbenefit from imported pollen may be observed in a single\r\ngeneration, is it any wonder that ambitious plants employ every\r\nsort of ingenious device to compel insects to bring them pollen\r\nfrom distant flowers of the same species? How punctually the\r\nMOON-FLOWER (I. grandiflora), next of kin to the morning-glory,\r\nopens its immense, pure white, sweet-scented flowers at night to\r\nattract night-flying moths, because their long tongues, which\r\nonly can drain the nectar, may not be withdrawn until they are\r\ndusted with vitalizing powder for export to some waiting sister.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRONOVIUS' or COMMON DODDER; STRANGLE-WEED; LOVE VINE; ANGEL'S\r\nHAIR\r\n  (Cuscuta gronovii)  Dodder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull white, minute, numerous, in dense clusters. Calyx\r\ninferior, greenish white, 5-parted; corolla bell-shaped, the 5\r\nlobes spreading, 5 fringed scales within; 5 stamens, each\r\ninserted on corolla throat above a scale; 2 slender styles. Stem:\r\nBright orange yellow, thread-like, twining high, leafless.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, meadows, ditches, beside streams.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and Manitoba, south to the Gulf\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nLike tangled yellow yarn wound spirally about the herbage and\r\nshrubbery in moist thickets, the dodder grows, its beautiful\r\nbright threads plentifully studded with small flowers tightly\r\nbunched. Try to loosen its hold on the support it is climbing up,\r\nand the secret of its guilt is out at once; for no honest vine is\r\nthis, but a parasite, a degenerate of the lowest type, with\r\nnumerous sharp suckers (haustoria) penetrating the bark of its\r\nvictim, and spreading in the softer tissues beneath to steal all\r\ntheir nourishment. So firmly are these suckers attached, that the\r\ngolden thread-like stem will break before they can be torn from\r\ntheir hold.\r\n\r\nNot a leaf now remains on the vine to tell of virtue in its\r\nremote ancestors; the absence of green matter (chlorophyll)\r\ntestifies to dishonest methods of gaining a living (see Indian\r\npipe); not even a root is left after the seedling is old enough\r\nto twine about its hard-working, respectable neighbors. Starting\r\nout in life with apparently the best intentions, suddenly the\r\ntender young twiner develops an appetite for strong drink and\r\nmurder combined, such as would terrify any budding criminal in\r\nFive Points or Seven Dials! No sooner has it laid hold of its\r\nvictim and tapped it, than the now useless root and lower portion\r\nwither away, leaving the dodder in mid-air, without any\r\nconnection with the soil below, but abundantly nourished with\r\njuices already stored up, and even assimilated, at its host's\r\nexpense. By rapidly lengthening the cells on the outer side of\r\nits stem more than on the inner side, the former becomes convex,\r\nthe latter concave; that is to say, a section of spiral is formed\r\nby the new shoot, which, twining upward, devitalizes its\r\nbenefactor as it goes. Abundant, globular seed vessels, which\r\ndevelop rapidly, while the blossoming continues unabated, soon\r\nsink into the soft soil to begin their piratical careers close\r\nbeside the criminals which bore them; or better still, from their\r\npoint of view, float downstream to found new colonies afar. When\r\nthe beautiful jewelweed - a conspicuous sufferer - is hung about\r\nwith dodder, one must be grateful for at least such symphony of\r\nyellows.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA WATERLEAF\r\n  (Hydrophyllum Virginicum)  Waterleaf family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White or purplish tinged, in a single or forking\r\ncluster on a long peduncle. Calyx deeply 5-parted, the spreading\r\nsegments very narrow, bristly hairy. Corolla erect, bell-shaped,\r\ndeeply 5-lobed; 5 protruding stamens, with soft hairs about their\r\nmiddle; 2 styles united to almost the summit. Stem: Slender,\r\nrather weak, to 3 ft. long, leafy, sparingly branched, from a\r\nscaly rootstock. Leaves: Alternate, lower ones on long petioles,\r\n6 to 10 in. long, pinnately divided into 5 to 7 oblong, sharply\r\ntoothed, acute leaflets or segments; upper leaves similar, but\r\nsmaller, and with fewer divisions.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to South Carolina, west to Kansas and\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nSo very many flowers especially adapted to the bumblebee are in\r\nbloom when the cymes of the waterleaf uncoil, like the borages,\r\nfrom their immature roll, that some special inducement to attract\r\nthis benefactor were surely needed. In high altitudes the\r\nclusters became deeper hued; but much as the more specialized\r\nbees love color, food appeals to them far more. Accordingly the\r\nfive lobes of each little flower stand erect to increase the\r\ndifficulty a short-tongued insect would have to drain its\r\nprecious stores; the stamens are provided with hairs for the same\r\nreason; and even the calyx is bristly, to discourage crawling\r\nants, the worst pilferers out. By these precautions against\r\ntheft, plenty of nectar remains for the large bees. To prevent\r\nself-fertilization, pollen is shed on visitors, which remove it\r\nfrom a newly opened flower before the stigmas become receptive to\r\nany; but in any case these are elevated in maturity above the\r\nanthers, well out of harm's way.\r\n\r\nEarly in spring the large lower leaves are calculated to hold the\r\ndrip from the trees overhead, hence the plant's scientific and\r\npopular names.\r\n\r\n\r\nJIMSONWEED; JAMESTOWN WEED; THORN APPLE; STRAMONIUM; DEVIL'S\r\nTRUMPET\r\n  (Datura stramonium)  Potato family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Showy, large, about 4 in. high, solitary, erect,\r\ngrowing from the forks of branches. Calyx tubular, nearly half as\r\nlong as the corolla, 5-toothed, prismatic; corolla funnel-form,\r\ndeep-throated, the spreading limb 2 in. across or less, plaited,\r\n5-pointed; stamens 5; 1 pistil. Stem: Stout, branching, smooth, 1\r\nto 5 ft. high. Leaves: Alternate, large, rather thin, petioled,\r\negg-shaped in outline, the edges irregularly wavy-toothed or\r\nangled, rank-scented. Fruit: A densely prickly, egg-shaped\r\ncapsule, the lower prickles smallest. The seeds and stems contain\r\na powerful narcotic poison.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Light soil, fields, waste land near\r\ndwellings, rubbish heaps.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, westward beyond\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that there are over five million Gypsies\r\nwandering about the globe, and that the narcotic seeds of the\r\nthorn apple, which apparently heal, as well as poison, have been\r\na favorite medicine of theirs for ages, we can understand at\r\nleast one means of the weed reaching these shores from tropical\r\nAsia. (Hindoo, dhatura). Our Indians, who call it \"white man's\r\nplant,\" associate it with the Jamestown settlement - a plausible\r\nconnection, for Raleigh's colonists would have been likely to\r\ncarry with them to the New World the seeds of an herb yielding an\r\nalkaloid more esteemed in the England of their day than the\r\nalkaloid of opium known as morphine. Daturina, the narcotic, and\r\nanother product, known in medicine as stramonium, smoked by\r\nasthmatics, are by no means despised by up-to-date practitioners.\r\nWere it not for the rank odor of its leaves, the vigorous weed,\r\ncoarse as it is, would be welcome in men's gardens. Indeed, many\r\nof its similar relatives adorn them. The fragrant petunia and\r\ntobacco plants of the flower beds, the potato, tomato, and\r\negg-plant in the kitchen garden, call it cousin.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon the plaited corolla of this long\r\ntrumpet-shaped flower expands to welcome the sphinx moths. So\r\ndeep a tube implies their tongues; not that these are the\r\nbenefactors to which the blossom originally adapted itself - they\r\nwere doubtless left behind in Asia - but apparently our moths\r\nmake excellent substitutes, for there is no abatement of the\r\nweed's vigor here, as there surely would be did it habitually\r\nfertilize itself. Any time after four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\naccording to the light, the sphinx moth, a creature of the\r\ngloaming, begins its rounds, to be mistaken for a hummingbird\r\nseven times out of ten. Hovering about its chosen white or yellow\r\nflowers, that open for it at the approach of twilight, it remains\r\npoised above one a second, as if motionless - although the faint\r\nhum of its wings, while sucking, indicates that no magic suspends\r\nit - then darts swift as thought to another deep tube to feast\r\nagain, of course transferring pollen as it goes. But what if the\r\nJamestown weed miscalculate the hour of her lover's call and open\r\ntoo soon? Mischievous bees, quick to seize so golden an\r\nopportunity, squeeze into the flower when it begins to unfold\r\n(flies and beetles following them), to steal pollen, which will\r\nsometimes be entirely removed before the moth's arrival.\r\n\r\nThe THORN-APPLE [now PURPLE THORN-APPLE, considered a variant of\r\nJIMSONWEED]; PURPLE STRAMONIUM (D. tatula), a similar species,\r\nusually with darker leaves, and pale lavender or violet flowers,\r\nor with its long, slender tube white, has become at home in so\r\nmany fields and waste lands east of Minnesota and Texas that no\r\none thinks of it as belonging to tropical America.\r\n\r\nOnly sphinx moths can reach its deep well of nectar, from which\r\nbees are literally barred out by an inward turn of the stamens\r\ntoward the center of the tube. Caterpillars of our commonest\r\nmember of the sphinx tribe conceal themselves on the tomato vine\r\nby a mimicry of its color so faultless that a bright eye only may\r\ndetect their presence. In the South the caterpillar of another of\r\nthese moths (Sphinx Carolina) does fearful havoc under its\r\nappropriate alias of \"tobacco worm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCULVER'S-ROOT; CULVER'S PHYSIC\r\n(Leptandra Virginica; Veronica Virginica of Gray)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white or rarely bluish, crowded in dense\r\nspike-like racemes 3 to 9 in. long, usually several spikes at top\r\nof stem or from upper axils. Calyx 4-parted, very small; corolla\r\ntubular, 4-lobed; 2 stamens protruding; pistil. Stem: Straight,\r\nerect, usually unbranched, 2 to 7 ft. tall. Leaves: Whorled, from\r\n3 to 9 in a cluster, lance-shaped or oblong, and long-tapering,\r\nsharply saw-edged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods, thickets, meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Alabama, west to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nSlender, erect white wands make conspicuous advertisements in\r\nshady retreats at midsummer, when insect life is at its height\r\nand floral competition for insect favors at its fiercest. Next of\r\nkin to the tiny blue speedwell, these minute, pallid blossoms\r\ncould have little hope of winning wooers were they not living\r\nexamples of the adage, \"In union there is strength.' Great\r\nnumbers crowded together on a single spike, and several spikes in\r\na cluster that towers above the woodland undergrowth, cannot well\r\nbe overlooked by the dullest insects, especially as nectar\r\nrewards the search of those having midlength or long tongues.\r\nSimply by crawling over the spikes, of which the terminal one\r\nusually matures first, they fertilize the little flowers. The\r\npollen thrust far out of each tube in the early stage of bloom,\r\nhas usually all been brushed off on the underside of bees, wasps,\r\nbutterflies, flies, and beetles before the stigma matures;\r\nnevertheless, when it becomes susceptible, the anthers spread\r\napart to keep out of its way lest any leftover pollen should\r\ntouch it.\r\n\r\n\"The leaves of the herbage at our feet,\" says Ruskin, \"take all\r\nkinds of strange shapes, as if to invite us to examine them.\r\nStar-shaped. heart-shaped, spear-shaped, arrow-shaped, fretted,\r\nfringed, cleft, furrowed, serrated, in whorls, in tufts, in\r\nwreaths, in spires, endlessly expressive, deceptive, fantastic,\r\nnever the same from footstalks to blossom, they seem perpetually\r\nto tempt our watchfulness, and take delight in outstripping our\r\nwonder.\" Doubtless light is the factor with the greatest effect\r\nin determining the position of the leaves on the stem, if not\r\ntheir shape. After plenty of light has been secured, any aid they\r\nmay render the flowers in increasing their attractiveness is\r\ngladly rendered. Who shall deny that the brilliant foliage of the\r\nsumacs, the dogwood, and the pokeweed in autumn does not greatly\r\nhelp them in attracting the attention of migrating birds to their\r\nfruit, whose seeds they wish distributed? Or that the clustered\r\nleaves of the dwarf cornel and Culver's-root, among others, do\r\nnot set off to great advantage their white flowers which, when\r\nseen by an insect flying overhead, are made doubly conspicuous by\r\nthe leafy background formed by the whorl?\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTONBUSH; HONEY-BALLS; GLOBE-FLOWER; BUTTON-BALL SHRUB;\r\nRIVER-BUSH\r\n  (Cephalanthus occidentalis)  Madder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fragrant, white, small, tubular, hairy within,\r\n4-parted, the long, yellow-tipped style far protruding; the\r\nflorets clustered on a fleshy receptacle, in round heads (about 1\r\nin. across), elevated on long peduncles from leaf-axils or ends\r\nof branches. Stem: A shrub 3 to 12 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite or\r\nin small whorls, petioled, oval, tapering at the tip, entire.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Beside streams and ponds; swamps, low ground.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Florida and Cuba, westward to\r\nArizona and California.\r\n\r\nDelicious fragrance, faintly suggesting jasmine, leads one over\r\nmarshy ground to where the buttonbush displays dense,\r\ncreamy-white globes of bloom, heads that Miss Lounsberry aptly\r\nlikens to \"little cushions full of pins.\" Not far away the sweet\r\nbreath of the white-spiked clethra comes at the same season, and\r\none cannot but wonder why these two bushes, which are so\r\nbeautiful when most garden shrubbery is out of flower, should be\r\nleft to waste their sweetness, if not on desert air exactly, on\r\nair that blows far from the homes of men. Partially shaded and\r\nsheltered positions near a house, if possible, suit these water\r\nlovers admirably. Cultivation only increases their charms. We\r\nhave not so many fragrant wild flowers that any can be neglected.\r\nJohn Burroughs, who included the blossoms of several trees in his\r\nlist of fragrant ones, found only thirty-odd species in New\r\nEngland and New York.\r\n\r\nExamine a well-developed ball of bloom on the button-bush under a\r\nmagnifying glass to appreciate its perfection of detail. After\r\ncounting two hundred and fifty minute florets, tightly clustered,\r\none's tired eyes give out. A honey-ball, with a well of nectar in\r\neach of these narrow tubes, invites hosts of insects to its\r\nhospitable feast; but only visitors long and slender of tongue\r\ncan drain the last drop, therefore the vicinity of this bush is\r\nan excellent place for a butterfly collector to carry his net.\r\nButterflies are by far the most abundant visitors; honey-bees\r\nalso abound, bumblebees, carpenter and mining bees, wasps, a\r\nhorde of flies, and some destructive beetles; but the short\r\ntongues can reach little nectar. Why do the pistils of the\r\nflorets protrude so far? Even before each minute bud opened, all\r\nits pollen had been shed on the tip of the style, to be in a\r\nposition to be removed by the first visitor alighting on the ball\r\nof bloom. After the removal of the pollen from the still immature\r\nstigma, it becomes sticky, to receive the importation from other\r\nblossoms. Did not the floret pass through two distinct stages,\r\nfirst male, then female, self-fertilization, not\r\ncross-fertilization, would be the inevitable result. The dull red\r\nand green seed-balls, which take on brown and bronze tints after\r\nfrost, make beautiful additions to an autumn bouquet. The bush is\r\nnext of kin to the coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGE VINE; TWIN-BERRY; MITCHELLA-VINE; SQUAW-BERRY\r\n  (Mitchella repens)  Madder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Waxy, white (pink in bud), fragrant, growing in pairs\r\nat ends of the branches. Calyx usually 4-lobed; corolla\r\nfunnel-form, about 1/2 in. long, the 4 spreading lobes bearded\r\nwithin; 4 stamens inserted on corolla throat; style with 4\r\nstigmas; the ovaries of the twin flowers united. (The style is\r\nlong when the stamens are short, or vice versa). Stem: Slender,\r\ntrailing, rooting at joints, 6 to 12 in. long, with numerous\r\nerect branches. Leaves: Opposite, entire, short petioled, oval or\r\nrounded, evergreen, dark, sometimes white veined. Fruit: A small,\r\nred, edible, double berry-like drupe.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods; usually, but not always, dry ones.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June. Sometimes again in autumn.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Gulf States, westward to\r\nMinnesota and Texas.\r\n\r\nA carpet of these dark, shining, little evergreen leaves, spread\r\nat the foot of forest trees, whether sprinkled over in June with\r\npairs of waxy, cream-white, pink-tipped, velvety, lilac-scented\r\nflowers that suggest attenuated arbutus blossoms, or with\r\ncoral-red \"berries\" in autumn and winter, is surely one of the\r\nloveliest sights in the woods. Transplanted to the home garden in\r\nclosely packed, generous clumps, with plenty of leaf-mould, or,\r\nbetter still, chopped sphagnum, about them, they soon spread into\r\nthick mats in the rockery, the hardy fernery, or about the roots\r\nof rhododendrons and the taller shrubs that permit some sunlight\r\nto reach them. No woodland creeper rewards our care with greater\r\nluxuriance of growth. Growing near our homes, the partridge vine\r\noffers an excellent opportunity for study.\r\n\r\nThe two flowers at the tip of a branch may grow distinct down to\r\ntheir united ovaries, or their tubes may be partly united, like\r\nSiamese twins - a union which in either case accounts for the odd\r\nshape of the so-called berry, that shows further traces of\r\nconsolidation in its \"two eyes,\" the remnants of eight calyx\r\nteeth. Experiment proves that when only one of the twin flowers\r\nis pollenized by insects (excluded from the other one by a net),\r\nfruit is rarely set; but when both are, a healthy seeded berry\r\nfollows. To secure cross-fertilization, the partridge flower,\r\nlike the bluets (q.v.), occurs in two different forms on distinct\r\nplants, seed from either producing after its kind. In one form\r\nthe style is low within the tube, and the stamens protrude; in\r\nthe other form the stamens are concealed, and the style, with its\r\nfour spreading stigmas, is exserted. No single flower matures\r\nboth its reproductive organs. Short-tongued small bees and flies\r\ncannot reach the nectar reserved for the blossom's benefactors\r\nbecause of the hairs inside the tube, which nearly close it; but\r\nlarger bees and butterflies coming to suck a flower with tall\r\nstamens receive pollen on the precise spot on their long tongues\r\nthat will come in contact with the sticky stigmas of the\r\nlong-styled form visited later, and there rub the pollen off. The\r\nlobes' velvety surface keeps insect feet from slipping.\r\n\r\nWhat endless confusion arises through giving the same popular\r\nfolk names to different species! The Bob White, which is called\r\nquail in New England or wherever the ruffed grouse is known as\r\npartridge, is called partridge in the Middle and Southern States,\r\nwhere the ruffed grouse is known as pheasant. But as both these\r\ndistributing agents, like most winter rovers, whether bird or\r\nbeast, are inordinately fond of this tasteless partridge berry,\r\nas well as of the spicy fruit of quite another species, the\r\naromatic wintergreen (q.v.), which shares with it a number of\r\ncommon names, every one may associate whatever bird and berry\r\nthat best suit him. The delicious little twin-flower, beloved of\r\nLinnaeus, also comes in for a share of lost identity through\r\nconfusion with the partridge vine.\r\n\r\nCLEAVERS; GOOSE-GRASS; BEDSTRAW\r\n  (Galium Aparine)  Madder family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, white, 4-parted, inconspicuous, in clusters of 1\r\nto 3 on peduncles from the axils of upper leaves. Stem: 2 to 5\r\nft. long, scrambling, weak, square; bristly on the angles.\r\nLeaves: in whorls of 6 or 8, narrow, midrib and edges very rough.\r\nFruit: Rounded, twin seed-vessels, beset with many hooked\r\nbristles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Shady ground.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Eastern half of United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nAmong some seventy other English folk names by which cleavers are\r\nknown are the following, taken from Britton and Brown's\r\n\"Illustrated Flora\": \"CATCHWEED, BEGGAR-LICE, BURHEAD,\r\nCLOVER-GRASS, CLING-RASCAL, SCRATCH-GRASS, WILD HEDGE-BURS,\r\nHAIRIF or AIRIF, STICK-A-BACK or STICKLE-BACK, GOSLING-GRASS or\r\nGOSLING-WEED, TURKEY-GRASS, PIGTAIL, GRIP or GRIP-GRASS, LOVEMAN,\r\nSWEETHEARTS.\" From these it will be seen that the insignificant\r\nlittle white flowers impress not the popular mind. But the twin\r\nburs which steal a ride on every passing animal, whether man or\r\nbeast, in the hope of reaching new colonizing ground far from the\r\nparent plant, rarely fail to make an impression on one who has to\r\npick trailing sprays beset with them off woollen clothing.\r\n\r\nSeveral other similar bur-bearing relatives there are, common in\r\nvarious parts of America as they are in Europe. The SWEET-SCENTED\r\nBEDSTRAW (G. trifolium), always with three little greenish\r\nflowers at the end of a footstalk, or branched into three\r\npedicels that are one to three flowered, and with narrowly oval,\r\none-nerved leaves arranged in whorls of six on its square stem,\r\nranges from ocean to ocean on this continent, over northern\r\nEurope, and in Asia from Japan to the Himalayas. It will be\r\nnoticed that plants depending upon the by hook or by crook method\r\nof travel are among the best of globe trotters. This species\r\nbecomes increasingly fragrant as it dries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON ELDER; BLACK-BERRIED, AMERICAN or SWEET ELDER; ELDERBERRY\r\n  (Sambucus Canadensis)  Honeysuckle family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, creamy, white, numerous, odorous, in large,\r\nflat-topped, or convex cymes at ends of branches. Calyx tubular,\r\nminute; corolla of 5 spreading lobes; 5 stamens; style short,\r\n3-parted. Stem: A shrub 4 to 10 ft. high, smooth, pithy, with\r\nlittle wood. Leaves: Opposite, pinnately compounded of 5 to 11\r\n(usually 7) oval, pointed, and saw-edged leaflets, heavy-scented\r\nwhen crushed. Fruit: Reddish-black, juicy \"berries\" (drupes).\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist soil; open situation.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, and westward\r\n2,000 miles.\r\n\r\nFlowers far less beautiful than these flat-spread, misty\r\nclusters, that are borne in such profusion along the country lane\r\nand meadow hedgerows in June, are brought from the ends of the\r\nearth to adorn our over-conventional gardens. Certain European\r\nrelatives, with golden or otherwise variegated foliage that looks\r\nsickly after the first resplendent outburst in spring, receive\r\nplaces of honor with monotonous frequency in American shrubbery\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nLike the wild carrot among all the umbel-bearers, and the daisy\r\namong the horde of composites, the elder flower has massed its\r\nminute florets together, knowing that there was no hope of\r\nattracting insect friends, except in such union. Where clumps of\r\nelder grow - and society it ever prefers to solitude - few\r\nshrubs, looked at from above, which, of course, is the winged\r\ninsect's point of view, offer a better advertisement. There are\r\npeople who object to the honey-like odor of the flowers.\r\nDoubtless this is what most attracts the flies and beetles, while\r\nthe lesser bees, that frequent them also, are more strongly\r\nappealed to through the eye. No nectar rewards visitors,\r\nconsequently butterflies rarely stop on the flat clusters; but\r\nthere is an abundant lunch of pollen for such as like it. Each\r\nminute floret has its five anthers so widely spread away from the\r\nstigmas that self-pollination is impossible; but with the help of\r\nsmall, winged pollen carriers plenty of cross-fertilized fruit\r\nforms. With the help of migrating birds, the minute nutlets\r\nwithin the \"berries\" are distributed far and wide.\r\n\r\nWhen clusters of dark, juicy fruit make the bush top-heavy, it\r\nis, of course, no part of their plan to be gathered into pails,\r\ncrushed and boiled and fermented into the spicy elderberry wine\r\nthat is still as regularly made in some old-fashioned kitchens as\r\ncurrant jelly and pickled peaches. Both flowers and fruit have\r\nstrong medicinal properties. Snuffling children are not loath to\r\nswallow sugar pills moistened with the homeopathic tincture of\r\nSambucus. The common European species (S. nigra), a mystic plant,\r\nwas once employed to cure every ill that flesh is heir to; not\r\nonly that, but, when used as a switch, it was believed to check a\r\nlad's growth. Very likely! Every whittling schoolboy knows how\r\neasy it is to remove the white pith from an elder stem. An\r\nancient musical instrument, the sambuca, was doubtless made from\r\nmany such hollow reed-like sticks properly attuned.\r\n\r\nA more woody species than the common elder, whose stems are so\r\ngreen it is scarcely like a true shrub, is the very beautiful\r\nRED-BERRIED or MOUNTAIN ELDER (S. pubens), found in rocky places,\r\nespecially in uplands and high altitudes, from the British\r\nPossessions north of us to Georgia on the Atlantic Coast, and to\r\nCalifornia on the Pacific. Coming into bloom in April or May, it\r\nproduces numerous flower clusters which are longer than broad,\r\npyramidal rather than flat-topped. They turn brown when drying.\r\nIn young twigs the pith is reddish-brown, not white as in the\r\ncommon elder. Birds with increased families to feed in June are\r\nnaturally attracted by the bright red fruit; and while they may\r\nnot distribute the stones over so vast an area as autumn migrants\r\ndo those of the fall berries, they nevertheless have enabled the\r\nshrub to travel across our continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOBBLE-BUSH; AMERICAN WAYFARING TREE\r\n  (Viburnum alnifolium; V. lantanoides of Gray)  Honeysuckle\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - In loose, compound, flat, terminal clusters, 3 to 5 in.\r\nacross; the outer, showy, white flowers each about 1 in. across,\r\nneutral; inner ones very much smaller, perfect. Calyx 5-parted;\r\ncorolla 5-lobed; 5 stamens; 3 stigmas. Stem: A widely and\r\nirregularly branching shrub, sometimes 10 ft. high; the young\r\ntwigs rusty scurfy. Leaves: Opposite, rounded or broadly ovate,\r\npointed at the tip, finely saw-edged, unevenly divided by midrib,\r\nscurfy on veins beneath. Fruit: Not edible, berry-like, at first\r\ncoral-red, afterward darker.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Cool, low, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina and Michigan, far northward.\r\n\r\nWidespread, irregular clusters of white bloom, that suggest heads\r\nof hydrangea whose plan has somehow miscarried, form a very\r\ndecorative feature of the woods in May, when the shrubbery in\r\nNature's garden, as in men's, is in its glory. For what reason\r\nare there two sizes and kinds of flowers in each cluster? Around\r\nthe outer margin are large showy shams: they lack the essential\r\norgans, the stamens and pistil; therefore what use are they?\r\nUndoubtedly they are mere advertisements to catch the eye of\r\npassing insects - no small service, however. It is the\r\ninconspicuous little flowers grouped within their circle that\r\nattend to the serious business of life. The shrub found it good\r\neconomy to increase the size of the outer row of flowers, even at\r\nthe expense of their reproductive organs, simply to add to the\r\nconspicuousness of the clusters, when so many blossoms enter into\r\nfierce competition with them for insect trade. Many beetles,\r\nattracted by the white color, come to feed on pollen, and often\r\ndestroy the anthers in their greed. But the lesser bees (Andrena\r\nchiefly), and more flies, whose short tongues easily obtain the\r\naccessible nectar, render constant service. These welcome guests\r\nwe have to thank for the clusters of coral-red berries that make\r\nthe shrub even more beautiful in September than in May.\r\n\r\nBecause it sometimes sends its straggling branches downward in\r\nloops that touch the ground and trip up the unwary pedestrian,\r\nwho presumably hobbles off in pain, the bush received a name with\r\nwhich the stumbler will be the last to find fault. From the bark\r\nof the Wayfaring Tree of the Old World (V. lantana), the tips of\r\nwhose procumbent branches often take root as they lie on the\r\nground, is obtained bird-lime. No warm, sticky scales enclose the\r\nbuds of our hardy hobble-bush; the only protection for its tender\r\nbaby foliage is in the scurfy coat on its twigs; yet with this\r\nthin covering, or without it, the young leaves safely withstand\r\nthe intense cold of northern winters.\r\n\r\nThe chief beauty of the HIGH BUSH-CRANBERRY, CRANBERRY TREE, or\r\nWILD GUELDER-ROSE (V. Opulus) lies in its clusters of bright red,\r\noval, very acid \"berries\" (drupes), that are commonly used by\r\ncountry people as a substitute for the fruit they so closely\r\nresemble. This is a symmetrical, erect, tall, smooth shrub, found\r\nin moist, low ground. Among the Berkshires it grows in\r\nperfection. From New Jersey, Michigan, and Oregon far northward\r\nis its range; also in Europe and Asia. The broadly ovate,\r\nsaw-edged, three-lobed leaves are more or less hairy along the\r\nveins on the underside. Like the hobble-bush, this one produces\r\nan outer circle of showy, neutral flowers, as advertisements, on\r\nits peduncled, flat cluster; and small, perfect ones, to\r\nreproduce the species, in June or July. As the flies and small\r\npollen-collecting bees move rapidly over a corymb to feast on the\r\nlayer of nectar freely exposed for their benefit, they usually\r\ncross-fertilize the flowers; for, as Muller pointed out, the\r\nanthers and stigmas of each come in contact with different parts\r\nof the insect's feet or tongue. Beetles, which visit the clusters\r\nin great numbers, often prove destructive visitors. Kerner claims\r\nthat nectar is secreted in the leaves of this species, whether in\r\nthe two glands that appear at the top of the petioles or not, he\r\ndoes not say. Of what possible advantage to the plant could such\r\nan arrangement be? Plants, as well as humans, are not in business\r\nfor philanthropy.\r\n\r\nNo garden is complete - was garden ever complete? - without the\r\nbeautiful SNOWBALL BUSH, a sterile variety of this shrub, with\r\nwhose abundant balls of white flowers everyone is familiar. When\r\nvarious members of the viburnum and the hydrangea tribes are\r\ncultivated, the corollas of both the small interior flowers and\r\nthose in the showy exterior circle become largely developed,\r\nwhile the reproductive organs of the former gradually become\r\nabortive. The snowball bush rather overdoes its advertising\r\nbusiness; for however attractive its round white masses of\r\nsterile bloom, the effect is of no advantage to itself.\r\n\r\nIn light, dry, rocky woods, from North Carolina and Minnesota,\r\nfar northward, grows the common MAPLE-LEAVED ARROW-WOOD or\r\nDOCKMACKIE (V. acerifolium), which one might easily mistake for a\r\nmaple sapling when it is not in flower or fruit. All the blossoms\r\nin its slender peduncled, flat-topped, white clusters are\r\nperfect; none are sterile for advertising purposes merely, as in\r\nthe cases of so many of its relatives. The five stamens protrude\r\nfrom each five-lobed little flower for plain reasons. The\r\nopposite leaves are broadly ovate, three-ribbed, three-lobed,\r\ncoarsely toothed, acute at the tip, and, except for their soft\r\nhairiness underneath, are too like maple leaves to be mistaken.\r\nIn autumn, when they take on rich tints, and the clusters of\r\n\"berries\" become first crimson, then nearly black, the shrub is a\r\ndelight to see.\r\n\r\nTo become familiar with one of the Viburnum bushes is to\r\nrecognize any member of the tribe when in blossom or fruit, for\r\nall spread more or less flattened, compound cymes of white\r\nflowers in late spring or early summer, followed by red or very\r\ndark \"berries\" (drupes); but it is on the leaves that we depend\r\nto name a species. The opposite, slender petioled, pale leaves of\r\nthe ARROW-WOOD or MEALY-TREE (V. dentalum), have no lobes; but\r\nare ovate, coarsely toothed, pointed at the tip, prominently\r\npinnately veined. All the flowers in a cyme are perfect; and the\r\ndrupes, which are at first blue, become nearly black when fully\r\nripe. In moist, or even wet, ground, from the Georgia mountains,\r\nwestern New York, and Minnesota far northward, this smooth,\r\nslender, gray shrub is found. Its wood once furnished the Indians\r\nwith arrows.\r\n\r\nA much lower growing, but similar, bush, the DOWNY-LEAVED\r\nARROW-WOOD (V. pubescens), formerly counted a mere variety of the\r\npreceding, may be known by the velvety down on the under side of\r\nits leaves. It grows in rocky, wooded places, often on some high\r\nbank above a stream. Beetles and the less specialized bees visit\r\nthe flat-topped flower clusters abundantly in May. Short-tongued\r\nvisitors quickly lick up the abundant nectar secreted at the base\r\nof each little style, cross-fertilizing their entertainers as\r\nthey journey across the cyme. So widely do the anthers diverge,\r\nthat pollen must often drop on the stigma of a neighboring\r\nfloret, and quite as often a flower is likely to be\r\nself-fertilized through the curvature of the filaments.\r\n\r\nThe WITHE-ROD OR APPALACHIAN TEA (V. cassinoides; V. nudum of\r\nGray) is found in swamps and wet ground from North Carolina and\r\nMinnesota northward, flowering in May or June. Its dense clusters\r\nof perfect, small white flowers, on a rather short peduncle, are\r\nfollowed by oval \"berries\" that, although pink at first, soon\r\nturn a dark blue, with a bloom like the huckleberry's. The\r\nopposite, oval to oblong, rather thick, smooth leaves and the\r\nsomewhat scurfy twigs help the novice to name this common shrub,\r\nwhose tough, pliable branches make excellent binders for farmer's\r\nbundles, but whose leaves cannot be recommended as a substitute\r\nfor tea.\r\n\r\nBeautiful enough for any gentleman's lawn is the SWEET VIBURNUM,\r\nNANNY-BERRY, SHEEP-BERRY, or NANNY-BUSH, as it is variously\r\ncalled (V. Lentago). Indeed, its name appears in many\r\nnurserymen's catalogues. From Georgia, Indiana, and Missouri far\r\nnorthward it grows in rich, moist soil, sometimes attaining the\r\nheight of a tree, more frequently that of a good-sized shrub. A\r\nprofusion of dense white, broad flower clusters, seated among the\r\nrich green terminal leaves in May, indicate a feast for migrating\r\nbirds and hungry beasts, including the omnivorous small boy in\r\nOctober, when the bluish-black, bloom-covered, sweet, edible\r\n\"berries\" ripen. A peculiarity of the ovate, long-tapering, and\r\nfinely saw-edged leaves is that their long petioles often broaden\r\nout and become wavy margined.\r\n\r\nAnother Viburnum, with smooth, bluish-black, sweet, and edible\r\nfruit, that ripens a month earlier than the nanny-berry's, is the\r\nsimilar BLACK HAW, STAG-BUSH or SLOE (V. prunifolium). As its\r\nLatin name indicates, the leaves suggest those of a plum tree. It\r\nis a very early bloomer; the flat-topped white clusters appearing\r\nin April, and lasting through June, in various parts of its range\r\nfrom the Gulf States to southern New England and Michigan. Unlike\r\nthe hobble-bush and the withe-rod, both the nanny-berry and the\r\nblack haw have conspicuous winter buds, the latter bush often\r\nclothing its tender undeveloped foliage with warm-looking reddish\r\ndown, although few of its naked kin have so southerly a range.\r\n\r\nONE-SEEDED, BUR- or STAR CUCUMBER; NIMBLE KATE\r\n\r\n  (Sicyos angulatus)  Gourd family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, greenish-white, 5-parted, of 2 kinds: staminate\r\nones in a loose raceme on a very long peduncle; fertile ones\r\nclustered in a little head on a short peduncle. Stem: A climbing\r\nvine with branched tendrils; more or less sticky-hairy. Leaves:\r\nBroad, 5-angled or 5-lobed, heart-shaped at base, rough,\r\nsometimes enormous, on stout petioles. Fruit: From 3 to 10\r\nbur-like, yellowish, prickly seed-vessels in a star-shaped\r\ncluster, each containing one seed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, shady waste ground; banks of streams.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to the Gulf States, and westward beyond the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nIn a damp, shady, waste corner, perhaps the first weed to take\r\npossession is the star cucumber, a poor relation of the musk and\r\nwater melons, the squash, cucumber, pumpkin, and gourd of the\r\ngarden. Its sole use yet discovered is to screen ugly fences and\r\nrubbish heaps by climbing and trailing luxuriantly over\r\neverything within reach. That it thinks more highly of its own\r\nimportance in the world than men do of it, is shown by the\r\nprecaution it takes to insure a continuance of its species. By\r\nseparating the sexes of its flowers, like Quakers at meeting, it\r\nprevents self-fertilization, and compels its small-winged\r\nvisitors to carry the smooth-banded, rough pollen from the\r\nstaminate to the tiny pistillate group. By roughening its angled\r\nstem and leaves, it discourages pilfering ants and other crawlers\r\nfrom reaching the sweets reserved for legitimate benefactors. So\r\nextremely sensitive are the tips of the tendrils that by rubbing\r\nthem with the finger they will coil up perceptibly; then\r\nstraighten out again if they find they have been deceived, and\r\nthat there is no stick for them to twine around. Give them a\r\nstick, however, and the coils remain fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATTLESNAKE-ROOT; WHITE LETTUCE or CANKER-WEED; LION'S-FOOT\r\n  (Nabalus albus)  Chickory family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Composite, numerous, greenish or cream white, or\r\ntinged with lilac, fragrant, nodding; borne in loose, open,\r\nnarrow terminal, and axillary clusters. Each bell-like flowerhead\r\nonly about 1/4 in. across, composed of 8 to 15 ray flowers,\r\ndrooping from a cup-like involucre consisting of 8 principal,\r\ncolored bracts. Stem: 2 to 5 ft. high, smooth, green or dark\r\npurplish red, leafy, from a tuberous, bitter root. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, variable, sometimes very large, broad, hastate, ovate,\r\nor heart-shaped, wavy-toothed, lobed, or palmately cleft; upper\r\nleaves smaller, lance-shaped, entire.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods; rich, moist borders; roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - Southern Canada to Georgia and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nNodding in graceful, open clusters from the top of a shining\r\ncolored stalk, the inconspicuous little bell-like flowers of this\r\ncommon plant spread their rays to release the branching styles\r\nfor contact with pollen-laden visitors. These styles presently\r\nbecome a bunch of cinnamon-colored hairs, a seed-tassel\r\nresembling a sable paint brush - the principal feature that\r\ndistinguishes this species from the smaller-flowered TALL WHITE\r\nLETTUCE (N. altissimus), whose pappus is a light straw color.\r\nBoth these plants are most easily recognized when their fluffy,\r\nplumed seeds are waiting for a stiff breeze to waft them to fresh\r\ncolonizing ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nBONESET; COMMON THOROUGHWORT; AGUE-WEED; INDIAN SAGE\r\n\r\n  (Eupatorium perfoliatum)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Composite, the numerous, small, dull, white heads\r\nof tubular florets only, crowded in a scaly involucre and borne\r\nin spreading, flat-topped terminal cymes. Stem: Stout, tall,\r\nbranching above, hairy, leafy. Leaves: Opposite, often united at\r\ntheir bases, or clasping, lance-shaped, saw-edged, wrinkled.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet ground, low meadows, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - From the Gulf States north to Nebraska, Manitoba,\r\nand New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nFrequently, in just such situations as its sister the Joe-Pye\r\nweed selects (q.v.), and with similar intent, the boneset spreads\r\nits soft, leaden-white bloom; but it will be noticed that the\r\nbutterflies, which love color, especially deep pinks and magenta,\r\nlet this plant alone, whereas beetles, that do not find the\r\nbutterfly's favorite, fragrant Joe-Pye weed at all to their\r\nliking, prefer these dull, odorous flowers. Many flies, wasps,\r\nand bees also, get generous entertainment in these tiny florets,\r\nwhere they feast with the minimum loss of time, each head in a\r\ncluster containing, as it does, from ten to sixteen restaurants.\r\nAn ant crawling up the stem is usually discouraged by its hairs\r\nlong before reaching the sweets. Sometimes the stem appears to\r\nrun through the center of one large leaf that is kinky in the\r\nmiddle and taper-pointed at both ends, rather than between a pair\r\nof leaves.\r\n\r\nAn old-fashioned illness known as break-bone fever - doubtless\r\nparalleled to-day by the grippe - once had its terrors for a\r\npatient increased a hundredfold by the certainty he felt of\r\ntaking nauseous doses of boneset tea, administered by zealous old\r\nwomen outside the \"regular practice.\" Children who had to have\r\ntheir noses held before they would - or, indeed, could - swallow\r\nthe decoction, cheerfully munched boneset taffy instead.\r\n\r\nThe bright white, wide-spread inflorescence of the WHITE\r\nSNAKEROOT, WHITE or INDIAN SANICLE, or DEERWORT BONESET (E.\r\nageratoides) is displayed from July to November in the hope of\r\ngetting relief from the fiercest competition for the visits of\r\nbutterflies, honey and other small bees, wasps, and flies. From\r\nJuly to September the vast army of composites appear in such\r\nhopeless predominance that prolonged bloom on the part of any of\r\ntheir number is surely an advantage. In the rich, moist woods, or\r\nby shady roadsides, where it prefers to dwell, the white sanicle\r\nmakes a fine show. Above its fringy bloom how often one sees the\r\nexquisite little lavender-blue butterflies (Lycaena\r\npseudargiolus) pausing an instant to drain the tiny cups of\r\nnectar, and usually transferring pollen from the protruding\r\nstyles (q.v.) as they flit to another cluster.\r\n\r\nThe opposite, petioled leaves, broadly oval at the base,\r\ntaper-pointed, coarsely toothed, three-nerved, and veiny, are\r\nthin and easily skeletonized by the insects that enjoy the leaves\r\nof all this clan of plants. From one to four feet high, the White\r\nSnakeroot grows in the United States and Canada as far west as\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the eupatoriums, and with similar\r\ninflorescence, is the CLIMBING BONESET or HEMPWEED (Willughbaeaa\r\nscandens; Mikania scandens of Gray.) Straggling over bushes in\r\nswamps, by the brookside thicket, or in moist, shady roadsides,\r\nthe vine reveals its kinship to the boneset instantly it comes\r\ninto bloom in midsummer, although its flower clusters are\r\noccasionally pinkish. The opposite, petioled leaves are quite\r\ndifferent from the boneset's, however, being heart-shaped at the\r\nbase, and taper-pointed, somewhat triangular, two to four inches\r\nlong, and one or two inches wide. From Massachusetts and the\r\nMiddle States even to South America and the West Indies is its\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nWHITE ASTERS or STARWORTS\r\n  (Aster = a star)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nIn dry, open woodlands, thickets, and roadsides, from August to\r\nOctober, we find the dainty WHITE WOOD ASTER (A. divaricatus; A.\r\ncorymbosus of Gray) its brittle zig-zag stem two feet high or\r\nless, branching at the top, and repeatedly forked where loose\r\nclusters of flower-heads spread in a broad, rather flat corymb.\r\nOnly a few white rays - usually from six to nine - surround the\r\nyellow disk, whose forets soon turn brown. Range from Canada\r\nsouthward to Tennessee.\r\n\r\nFirst to bloom among the white species, beginning in July, is the\r\nUPLAND WHITE ASTER (A. ptarmicoides), which elects to grow in the\r\nrocky or dry soil of high ground in the northern United States\r\nwestward to Colorado. The leaves, which resemble grayish-green\r\nshining grass-blades, arranged alternately up the rigid stem, and\r\ndiminishing in size near the top until they become mere bracts\r\namong the flowers, enable us to name the plant. The heads, in a\r\nbranching cluster, are not numerous; each measures barely an inch\r\nacross its ten to twenty snow-white rays; the center is of a pale\r\nyellow-green, turning a light brown in maturity.\r\n\r\nThe TALL WHITE or PANICLED ASTER (A. paniculatus), in bloom from\r\nAugust to October in different parts of its wide range, attracts\r\ngreat numbers of beetles, which do it more harm than good; but\r\nmany more butterflies (some of whose caterpillars feed on aster\r\nfoliage as a staple), quantities of flies, some moths, swarms of\r\nbees, wasps, and miscellaneous winged visitors. Professor\r\nRobertson found several thousand callers, representing\r\nninety-eight distinct species, on this one aster during four\r\nOctober days. Such popularity as the asters have attained finds\r\nits just reward in the triumphant progress of the lovely tribe\r\n(q.v.). For the amateur to name each member of such a horde is\r\nquite hopeless. In branching, raceme-like clusters, from August\r\nto October, this aster displays its numerous flower-heads, less\r\nthan an inch across, each with a green cup formed of four or five\r\nseries of overlapping bracts, and many white rays, occasionally\r\nviolet tipped. The smooth stem, which rises from two to eight\r\nfeet above moist soil, is plentifully set with alternate,\r\npointed-tipped, lance-shaped leaves, tapering to a sessile or\r\npartly clasping base, and sparingly saw-edged. Its range is from\r\nMontana east to Virginia, south to Louisiana, north to Ontario\r\nand New England.\r\n\r\nThe bushy little WHITE HEATH ASTER (A. ericoides) every one must\r\nknow, possibly, as MICHAELMAS DAISY, FAREWELL SUMMER, WHITE\r\nROSEMARY, or FROSTWEED; for none is commoner in dry soil,\r\nthroughout the eastern United States at least. Its smooth, much\r\nbranched stem rarely reaches three feet in height, usually it is\r\nnot over a foot tall, and its very numerous flower-heads, white\r\nor pink tinged, barely half an inch across, appear in such\r\nprofusion from September even to December as to transform it into\r\na feathery mass of bloom.\r\n\r\nGrowing like branching wands of golden rod, the DENSE-FLOWERED,\r\nWHITE-WREATHED, or STARRY ASTER (A. multiflorus) bears its minute\r\nflower-heads crowded close along the branches, where many small,\r\nstiff leaves, like miniature pine needles, follow them. Each\r\nflower measures only about a quarter of an inch across. From\r\nMaine to Georgia and Texas westward to Arizona and British\r\nColumbia the common bushy plant lifts its rather erect, curving,\r\nfeathery branches perhaps only a foot, sometimes above a man's\r\nhead, from August till November, in such dry, open, sterile\r\nground as the white heath aster also chooses.\r\n\r\nNo one not a latter-day, structural botanist could see why the\r\nTALL, FLAT-TOP WHITE ASTER (Doellingeria umbella) is now an\r\noutcast from the aster tribe into a separate genus. This common\r\nspecies of moist soil and swamps has its numerous small heads\r\n(containing ten to fifteen rays each) arranged in large,\r\nterminal, compound clusters (corymbs). The stem, which rises from\r\ntwo to eight feet, has its long-tapering, alternate leaves, hairy\r\non the veins beneath and rough margined.\r\n\r\nLate in the fall you may hear the rich tone of a Bombilius, one\r\nof the commonest flies seen about flowers, as he darts rapidly\r\namong the white asters. Unless you have been initiated, you may\r\nmistake this fly for a bee. He sings a very similar song and\r\nwears a similar dress; but he is not a very good imitation, after\r\nall, and a little familiarity with him will give you courage to\r\ncatch him in your hand if you are quick enough, for he is\r\nincapable of stinging or biting: he can merely make a noise out\r\nof all proportion to his size. He is simply living from hour to\r\nhour, and lays up no store for the winter, enjoying more or less\r\nsecurity from his resemblance to the industrious and dangerous\r\ninsect which he imitates.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAISY FLEABANE; SWEET SCABIOUS\r\n  (Erigeron annus)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Numerous, daisy-like, about 1/2 in. across; from\r\n40 to 70 long, fine, white rays (or purple- or pink-tinged),\r\narranged around yellow disk florets in a rough, hemispheric cup\r\nwhose bracts overlap. Stem: Erect, to 4 ft. high, branching\r\nabove, with spreading, rough hairs. Leaves: Thin, lower ones\r\novate, coarsely toothed, petioled; upper ones sessile, becoming\r\nsmaller, lance-shaped.\r\nPreferred Habitat: Fields, wasteland, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season: May-November.\r\nDistribution: Nova Scotia to Virginia, westward to Missouri.\r\n\r\nAt a glance one knows this flower to be akin to Robin's plantain\r\n(q.v.) the the asters and daisy. A smaller, more delicate\r\nspecies, with mostly entire leaves and appressed hairs (E.\r\nramosus; E. strigosum of Gray) has a similar range and season of\r\nbloom. Both soon grow hoary-headed after they have been\r\nfertilized by countless insects crawling over them (Erigeron =\r\nearly old). That either of these plants, or the pinkish,\r\nsmall-flowered, strong-scented SALT-MARSH FLEABANE (Pluchea\r\ncamphorata), drive away fleas, is believed only by those who have\r\nnot used them dried, reduced to powder, and sprinkled in kennels,\r\nfrom which, however, they have been known to drive away dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUNDSEL-BUSH or -TREE; PENCIL-TREE\r\n  (Baccharis halimifolia)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads: White or yellowish tubular florets, 1 to 5 in\r\npeduncled clusters. Staminate and pistillate clusters on\r\ndifferent shrubs; the former almost round at first, the latter\r\nconspicuous only when seeding; then their pappus is white, and\r\nabout 1/3 in. long. Stem: A smooth, branching shrub, 3 to 10 ft.\r\nhigh. Leaves: Thick, lower ones ovate to wedge-shaped, coarsely\r\nangular-toothed; upper ones smaller, few-toothed or entire.\r\nPreferred Habitat: Salt marshes, tidewater streams, often far\r\nfrom the coast.\r\nFlowering Season: September-November\r\nDistribution: The Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Maine to Texas.\r\n\r\nWhen the little bright white, silky cockades, clustered at the\r\nends of the branches, appear on a female groundsel-bush in\r\nautumn, our eyes are attracted to the shrub for the first time.\r\nBut had not small pollen carriers discovered it weeks before, the\r\nscaly, glutinous cups would hold no charming, plumed seeds ready\r\nto ride on autumn gales. Self-fertilization has been guarded\r\nagainst by precarious means, but the safest of all devices -\r\nseparation of the sexes on distinct plants. These are absolutely\r\ndependent, of course, on insect messengers - not visitors merely.\r\nBees, which always show less inclination to dally from one\r\nspecies of flower to another than any other guests, and more\r\nintelligent directness of purpose when out for business are the\r\ngroundsel-bush's truest benefactors. This is the only shrub among\r\nthe multitudinous composite clan that most of us are ever likely\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nPEARLY or LARGE-FLOWERED EVERLASTING; IMMORTELLE; SILVER LEAF;\r\nMOONSHINE; COTTON-WEED; NONE-SO-PRETTY\r\n\r\n  (Anaphalis margaritacea; Antennaria margaritacea of Gray)\r\nThistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Numerous pearly-white scales of the involucre\r\nholding tubular florets only; borne in broad, rather flat,\r\ncompound corymbs at the summit. Stem: Cottony, to 3 ft. high,\r\nleafy to the top. Leaves: Upper ones small, narrow, linear; lower\r\nones broader, lance-shaped, rolled backward, more or less woolly\r\nbeneath.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, hillsides, open woods, uplands.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina, Kansas, and California, far north.\r\n\r\nWhen the small, white, overlapping scales of an everlasting's\r\noblong involucre expand stiff and straight, each pert little\r\nflower-head resembles nothing so much as a miniature pond lily,\r\nonly what would be a lily's yellow stamens are in this case the\r\ntrue flowers, which become brown in drying. It will be noticed\r\nthat these tiny florets, so well protected in the center, are of\r\ntwo different kinds, separated on distinct heads: the female\r\nflorets with a tubular, five-cleft corolla, a two-cleft style,\r\nand a copious pappus of hairy bristles; the staminate, or male,\r\nflorets more slender, the anthers tailed at the base.\r\nSelf-fertilization being, of course, impossible under such an\r\narrangement, the florets are absolutely dependent upon little\r\nwinged pollen carriers, whose sweet reward is well protected for\r\nthem from pilfering ants by the cottony substance on the wiry\r\nstem, a device successfully employed by thistles also (q.v.).\r\n\r\nAn imaginary blossom that never fades has been the dream of poets\r\nfrom Milton's day; but seeing one, who loves it? Our amaranth has\r\nthe aspect of an artificial flower - stiff, dry, soulless, quite\r\nin keeping with the decorations on the average farmhouse\r\nmantelpiece. Here it forms the most uncheering of winter\r\nbouquets, or a wreath about flowers made from the lifeless hair\r\nof some dear departed.\r\n\r\nIn open, rocky places, moist or dry, the CLAMMY EVERLASTING,\r\nSWEET BALSAM, OR WINGED CUDWEED (Gnaphalium decurrens) prefers to\r\ndwell. A wholesome fragrance, usually mingled with that of sweet\r\nfern, pervades its neighborhood. Its yellowish-white little\r\nflower-heads clustered at the top of an erect stem, and its pale\r\nsage-green leaves, densely woolly beneath, the lower ones seeming\r\nto run along the stem, need no further description: every one\r\nknows the common everlasting. Its right to the Greek generic\r\nname, meaning a lock of wool, no one will dispute. From\r\nPennsylvania and Arizona, north to Nova Scotia and British\r\nColumbia, its amaranthine flowers are displayed from July to\r\nSeptember, the staminate and the pistillate heads on distinct\r\nplants. Many insect visitors approach the flowers; some, like the\r\nbees, are working for them in transferring pollen; others, like\r\nthe ants, which are trying to steal nectar, usually getting\r\nkilled on the sticky, cottony stem; and, hovering near, ever\r\nconspicuous among the larger visitors, is the beautiful hunter's\r\nbutterfly (Pyrameis huntera), to be distinguished from its sister\r\nthe painted lady, always seen about thistles, by the two large\r\neye-like spots on the under side of the hind wings. What are\r\nthese butterflies doing about their chosen plants? Certainly the\r\nminute florets of the everlasting offer no great inducements to a\r\ncreature that lives only on nectar. But that cocoon, compactly\r\nwoven with silk and petals, which hangs from the stem, tells the\r\nstory of the hunter's butterfly's presence. A brownish-drab\r\nchrysalis, or a slate-colored and black-banded little caterpillar\r\nwith tufts of hairs on its back, and pretty red and white dots on\r\nthe dark stripes, shows our butterfly in the earlier stages of\r\nits existence, when the everlastings form its staple diet.\r\n\r\nWhen the hepatica, arbutus, saxifrage, and adder's tongue are\r\nrunning for first place among the earliest spring flowers,\r\nanother modest little competitor joins the race - the DWARF\r\nEVERLASTING (Antennaria plantaginifolia), also known as\r\nPLANTAIN-LEAVED, MOUSE-EAR, SPRING or EARLY EVERLASTING, WHITE\r\nPLANTAIN, PUSSY-TOES and LADIES' TOBACCO. From March to June, in\r\ndifferent parts of its wide range, rocky fields, hillsides, and\r\ndry, open woods are whitened with broad patches of it, formed by\r\nrunners; the fertile plants from six to eighteen inches high; the\r\nmale plants, in distinct patches, smaller throughout. At the base\r\nthe tufted leaves, which are green on the upper side, but silvery\r\nbeneath, often woolly when young, are broadly oval or spatulate,\r\nthe upper leaves oblong to lance-shaped, seated on the woolly\r\nstem. Charming little rosettes remain all winter, ready to send\r\nup the first flowers displayed by the vast host of composites.\r\nSeveral little heads of fertile florets, resembling tufts of\r\nsilvery-white silk, are set in pale-greenish cups in a broad\r\ncluster at the top of the stem; the staminate florets in whiter\r\ncups with more rounded scales. Small bees, chiefly those of the\r\nAndrena and Halictus tribe, and many flies, attend to\r\ntransferring pollen. Our friend, the hunter's butterfly, also\r\nhovers near. Range from Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico, westward\r\nto Nebraska.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARROW; MILFOIL; OLD MAN'S PEPPER; NOSEBLEED\r\n  (Achillea Millefolium)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Grayish-white, rarely pinkish, in a hard, close,\r\nflat-topped, compound cluster. Ray florets 4 to 6, pistillate,\r\nfertile; disk florets yellow, afterward brown, perfect, fertile.\r\nStem: Erect, from horizontal rootstalk, 1 to 2 ft. high, leafy,\r\nsometimes hairy. Leaves: Very finely dissected (Millefolium =\r\nthousand leaf), narrowly oblong in outline.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste land, dry fields, banks, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe and Asia throughout North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nEverywhere this commonest of common weeds confronts us; the\r\ncompact, dusty-looking clusters appearing not by waysides only,\r\naround the world, but in the mythology, folklore, medicine, and\r\nliterature of many peoples. Chiron, the centaur, who taught its\r\nvirtues to Achilles that he might make an ointment to heal his\r\nMyrmidons wounded in the siege of Troy, named the plant for this\r\nfavorite pupil, giving his own to the beautiful blue corn-flower\r\n(Centaurea Cyanus). As a love-charm; as an herb-tea brewed by\r\ncrones to cure divers ailments, from loss of hair to the ague; as\r\nan inducement to nosebleed for the relief of congestive headache;\r\nas an ingredient of an especially intoxicating beer made by the\r\nSwedes, it is mentioned in old books. Nowadays we are satisfied\r\nmerely to admire the feathery masses of lace-like foliage formed\r\nby young plants, to whiff the wholesome, nutty, autumnal odor of\r\nits flowers, or to wonder at the marvelous scheme it employs to\r\noverrun the earth.\r\n\r\nLike the daisy, each small flower in a cluster, as symmetrically\r\narranged as brain coral, is made up of a large number of minute\r\nbut perfect florets, suited to attract insects by making a better\r\nshow than each could do alone, and by offering them accessible\r\nfeeding places close together, where they may feast with minimum\r\nloss of time. Simultaneous cross-fertilization of many florets\r\nmust be effected by every visitor crawling over a cluster. The\r\nflorets in each disk open in regular array toward the centers. At\r\nthe expense of stamens, which are absent in the grayish-white ray\r\nflorets, they have attained their development, another instance\r\nof \"progress by loss\" from the evolutionary standpoint. By\r\nprolonging its season of bloom to get relief from the fierce\r\ncompetition for insect visitors in midsummer; by increase through\r\nseeds, and runners too; by contenting itself with neglected\r\ncorners of the earth, the yarrow gives us many valuable lessons\r\non how to succeed.\r\n\r\nDOG'S or FETID CAMOMILE; MAYWEED; PIG-STY DAISY; DILLWEED;\r\nDOG-FENNEL\r\n\r\n  (Anthemis Cotula; Maruta Cotula of Gray)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Like smaller daisies, about 1 in. broad; 10 to 18\r\nwhite, notched, neutral ray florets around a convex or conical\r\nyellow disk, whose florets are fertile, containing both stamens\r\nand pistil, their tubular corollas 5-cleft. Stem: Smooth, much\r\nbranched, 1 to 2 ft. high, leafy, with unpleasant odor and acrid\r\ntaste. Leaves: Very finely dissected into slender segments.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, dry wasteland, sandy fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - Throughout North America, except in circumpolar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\"Naturalized from Europe, and widely distributed as a weed in\r\nAsia, Africa, and Australasia\" (Britton and Brown's \"Flora\").\r\nLittle wonder the camomile encompasses the earth, for it imitates\r\nthe triumphant daisy, putting into practice those business\r\nmethods of the modern department store, by which the composite\r\nhorde have become the most successful strugglers for survival.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant odor given forth by this bushy little plant repels\r\nbees and other highly organized insects; not so flies, which, far\r\nfrom objecting to a fetid smell, are rather attracted by it. They\r\nvisit the camomile in such numbers as to be the chief\r\nfertilizers. As the development of bloom proceeds toward the\r\ncenter, the disk becomes conical, to present the newly opened\r\nflorets, where a fly alighting on it must receive pollen, to be\r\ntransferred as he crawls and flies to another head. After\r\nfertilization the white rays droop. Dog, used as a prefix by\r\nseveral of the plant's folk names, implies contempt for its\r\nworthlessness. It is quite another species, the GARDEN CAMOMILE\r\n(A. nobilis) which furnishes the apothecary with those flowers\r\nwhich, when steeped into a bitter aromatic tea, have been\r\nsupposed for generations to make a superior tonic and blood\r\npurifier.\r\n\r\nNot so common a plant here, but almost as widespread as the\r\npreceding species, is the similar, but not fetid, CORN or FIELD\r\nCAMOMILE (A. arvensis), a pest to European farmers. Both are\r\nclosely related to the garden FEVERFEW, FEATHERFEW, OR PELLITORY\r\n(Chrysanthemum Parthenium), which escapes from cultivation\r\nwhenever it can into waste fields and roadsides.\r\n\r\nCOMMON DAISY; WHITE-WEED; WHITE OR OX-EYE DAISY; LOVE-ME,\r\nLOVE-ME-NOT\r\n\r\n  (Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Disk florets yellow, tubular, 4 or 5 toothed,\r\ncontaining stamens and pistil; surrounded by white ray florets,\r\nwhich are pistillate, fertile. Stem: Smooth, rarely branched, to\r\n3 ft. high. Leaves: Mostly oblong in outline, coarsely toothed\r\nand divided.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Meadows, pastures, roadsides, wasteland.\r\nFlowering Season - May-November.\r\nDistribution - Throughout the United States and Canada; not so\r\ncommon in the South and West.\r\n\r\nMyriads and myriads of daisies, whitening our fields as if a\r\nbelated blizzard had covered them with a snowy mantle in June,\r\nfill the farmer with dismay, the flower-lover with rapture. When\r\nvacation days have come; when chains and white-capped old women\r\nare to be made of daisies by happy children turned out of\r\nschoolrooms into meadows; when pretty maids, like Goethe's\r\nMarguerite, tell their fortunes by the daisy \"petals;\" when music\r\nbubbles up in a cascade of ecstasy from the throats of bobolinks\r\nnesting among the daisies, timothy, and clover; when the blue sky\r\narches over the fairest scenes the year can show, and all the\r\nworld is full of sunshine and happy promises of fruition, must we\r\nAmericans always go to English literature for a song to fit our\r\njoyous mood?\r\n\r\n     \"When daisies pied, and violets blue,\r\n        And lady-smocks all silver white,\r\n      And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue,\r\n        Do paint the meadows with delight-\"\r\n\r\nsang Shakespeare. His lovely suggestion of an English spring\r\nrecalls no familiar picture to American minds. No more does\r\nBurns's\r\n\r\n     \"Wee, modest crimson-tippit flower.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare, Burns, Chaucer, Wordsworth, and all the British\r\npoets who have written familiar lines about the daisy, extolled a\r\nquite different flower from ours - Bellis perennis, the little\r\npink and white blossom that hugs English turf as if it loved it -\r\nthe true day's-eye, for it closes at nightfall and opens with the\r\ndawn.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the secret of the large, white daisy's triumphal\r\nconquest of our territory? A naturalized immigrant from Europe\r\nand Asia, how could it so quickly take possession? In the\r\nover-cultivated Old World no weed can have half the chance for\r\nunrestricted colonizing that it has in our vast unoccupied area.\r\nMost of our weeds are naturalized foreigners, not natives. Once\r\nreleased from the harder conditions of struggle at home (the\r\nseeds being safely smuggled in among the ballast of freight\r\nships, or hay used in packing), they find life here easy,\r\npleasant; as if to make up for lost time, they increase a\r\nthousandfold. If we look closely at a daisy - and a lens is\r\nnecessary for any but the most superficial acquaintance - we\r\nshall see that, far from being a single flower, it is literally a\r\nhost in itself. Each of the so-called white \"petals\" is a female\r\nfloret, whose open corolla has grown large, white, and showy, to\r\naid its sisters in advertising for insect visitors - a prominence\r\ngained only by the loss of its stamens. The yellow center is\r\ncomposed of hundreds of minute tubular florets huddled together\r\nin a green cup as closely as they can be packed. Inside each of\r\nthese tiny yellow tubes stand the stamens, literally putting\r\ntheir heads together. As the pistil within the ring of stamens\r\ndevelops and rises through their midst, two little hair brushes\r\non its tip sweep the pollen from their anthers as a rounded brush\r\nwould remove the soot from a lamp chimney. Now the pollen is\r\nelevated to a point where any insect crawling over the floret\r\nmust remove it. The pollen gone, the pistil now spreads its two\r\narms, that were kept tightly closed together while any danger of\r\nself-fertilization lasted. Their surfaces become sticky, that\r\npollen brought from another flower may adhere to them. Notice\r\nthat the pistils in the white ray florets have no hairbrushes on\r\ntheir tips, because, no stamens being there, there is no pollen\r\nto be swept out. Because daisies are among the most conspicuous\r\nof flowers, and have facilitated dining for their visitors by\r\noffering them countless cups of refreshment that may be drained\r\nwith a minimum loss of time, almost every insect on wings alights\r\non them sooner or later. In short, they run their business on the\r\nprinciple of a cooperative department store. Immense quantities\r\nof the most vigorous, because cross-fertilized, seed being set in\r\nevery patch, small wonder that our fields are white with daisies\r\n- a long and a merry life to them!\r\n\r\n\r\nSince all flowers must once have passed through a white stage\r\nbefore attaining gay colors, so evolution teaches, it is not\r\nsurprising that occasional reversions to the white type should be\r\nfound even among the brightest-hued species. Again, some white\r\nflowers which are in a transition state show aspirations after\r\ncolor, often so marked in individuals as to mislead one into\r\nbelieving them products of a far advanced colored type. Also,\r\npale colors blanch under a summer sun. These facts must be borne\r\nin mind, and the blue, pink, and yellow blossoms should be\r\ninvestigated before the reader despairs of identifying a flower\r\nnot found in the white group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW AND ORANGE FLOWERS\r\n\r\n\"All variations which render the blossoms more attractive, either\r\nby scent, color, size of corolla, or quantity of nectar, make the\r\ninsect visit more sure, and therefore the production of seed more\r\nlikely. Thus, the conspicuous blossoms secure descendants which\r\ninherit the special variations of their parents, and so,\r\ngeneration after generation, we have selections in favor of\r\nconspicuous flowers, where insects are at work. Their\r\nappreciation of color, because it has brought the blossom\r\npossessing it more immediately into their view, and more surely\r\nunder their attention, has enabled them, through the ages, to be\r\npreparing the specimens upon which man now operates, he taking up\r\nthe work where they have left it, selecting, inoculating, and\r\nhybridizing, according to his own rules of taste, and developing\r\na beauty which insects alone could never have evolved. His are\r\nthe finishing touches, his the apparent effects, yet no less is\r\nit true, that the results of his floriculture would never have\r\nbeen attainable without insect helpers. It is equally certain,\r\nthat the beautiful perfume, and the nectar also, are, in their\r\npresent development, the outcome of repeated insect selection,\r\nand here, it seems to me, we get an inkling of a deep mystery:\r\nWhy is life, in all its forms, so dependent upon the fusion of\r\ntwo individual elements? Is it not, that thus the door of\r\nprogress has been opened? If each alone had reproduced, itself\r\nall-in-all, advance would have been impossible, the insect and\r\nhuman florists and pomologists, like the improvers of animal\r\nraces, would have had no platform for their operation, and not\r\nonly the forms of life, but life itself would have been\r\nstereotyped unalterably, ever mechanically giving repetition to\r\nidentical phenomena.\" - Frank R. Cheshire in \"Bees and\r\nBee-keeping.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW AND ORANGE FLOWERS\r\n\r\nGOLDEN CLUB\r\n  (Orontium aquaticum)  Arum family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, minute, perfect, crowded on a spadix\r\n(club) 1 to 2 in. long; the scape, 6 in. to 2 ft. tall, flattened\r\njust below it; the club much thickened in fruit. Leaves: All from\r\nroot, petioled, oblong-elliptic, dull green above, pale\r\nunderneath, 5 to 12 in. long, floating or erect.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Shallow ponds, standing water, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - April-May.\r\nDistribution - New England to the Gulf States, mostly near the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nA first cousin of cruel Jack-in-the-pulpit, the skunk cabbage,\r\nand the water-arum (q.v.), a poor relation also of the calla\r\nlily, the golden club seems to be denied part of its tribal\r\ninheritance - the spathe, corresponding to the pulpit in which\r\nJack preaches, or to the lily's showy white skirt. In the\r\ntropics, where the lily grows, where insect life teems in myriads\r\nand myriads, and competition among the flowers for their visits\r\nis infinitely more keen than here, she has greater need to flaunt\r\nshowy clothes to attract benefactors than her northern relatives.\r\nBut the golden club, which looks something like a calla stripped\r\nof her lovely white robe, has not lacked protection for its\r\nlittle buds from the cold spring winds while any was needed. By\r\nthe time we notice the plant in bloom, however, its bract-like\r\nspathe has usually fallen away, as if conscious that the pretty\r\nmosaic club of golden florets, so attractive in itself, was quite\r\nable to draw all the visitors needed without further help. Merely\r\nby crawling over the clubs, flies and midges cross-fertilize\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFOLIATE BELLWORT; STRAW BELL\r\n  (Uvularia perfoliala)  Bunch-flower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fragrant, pale yellow, about 1 in. long, drooping\r\nsingly (rarely 2) from tips of branches; perianth narrow,\r\nbell-shaped, of 6 petal-like segments, rough within, spreading at\r\nthe tip; 6 stamens; 3 styles united to the middle. Stem: 6 to 20\r\nin. high, smooth, shining, forking about half way. Leaves:\r\nApparently strung on the slender stem, oval, tapering at tip.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, rich woods; thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to the Gulf of Mexico, west to Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHanging like a palate (uvula) from the roof of a mouth, according\r\nto imaginative Linnaeus, the little bellwort droops, and so\r\nmodestly hides behind the leaf its footstalk pierces that the eye\r\noften fails to find it when so many more showy blossoms arrest\r\nattention in the May woods. Slight fragrance helps to guide the\r\nkeen bumblebee to the pale yellow bell. The tips spreading apart\r\nvery little and the flower being pendent, how is she to reach the\r\nnectar secreted at the base of each of its six divisions? Is it\r\nnot more than probable that the inner surface is rough, as if\r\ndusted with yellow meal, to provide a foothold for her as she\r\nclings? Now securely hanging from within the inhospitable flower,\r\nher long tongue can easily drain the sweets, and in doing so she\r\nwill receive pollen, to be deposited, in all probability, on the\r\nstigmatic style branches of the next bellwort entered.\r\n\r\nWith a more westerly range than the perfoliate species, the\r\nsimilar LARGE-FLOWERED BELLWORT (U. grandiflora) grows in like\r\nsituations. Its greenish lemon-yellow flowers, an inch to an inch\r\nand a half long, appear from April to May, or when the female\r\nbumblebees, that fly before their lords, are the only insects\r\nlarge and strong enough to force an entrance. Mr. Trelease, who\r\nnoted them on the flowers near Madison, Wisconsin, saw that one\r\nladen with pollen from another blossom came in contact with the\r\nthree sticky branches of the style, protruding between the\r\nanthers, when she crawled between the anthers and sepals, as she\r\nmust, to reach the nectar secreted at the base. But the linear\r\nanthers shedding their pollen longitudinally, there is a chance\r\nthat the flower may fertilize itself should no bee arrive before\r\na certain point is reached.\r\n\r\nThe SESSILE-LEAVED BELLWORT, or WILD OAT (U. sessifolia), as its\r\nname implies, has its thin, pale green leaves tapering at either\r\nend, seated on the stem, not surrounding it, or apparently strung\r\non it. The smaller flower is cream colored. A sharply\r\nthree-angled capsule about an inch long follows. Range from\r\nMinnesota and Arkansas to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD YELLOW, MEADOW or FIELD LILY; CANADA LILY\r\n (Lilium Canadense)  Lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow to orange-red, of a deeper shade within, and\r\nspeckled with dark reddish-brown dots. One or several (rarely\r\nmany) nodding on long peduncles from the summit. Perianth\r\nbell-shaped, of 6 spreading segments 2 to 3 in. long, their tips\r\ncurved backward to the middle; 6 stamens, with reddish-brown\r\nlinear anthers; 1 pistil, club-shaped; the stigma 3-lobed. Stem:\r\n2 to 5 ft. tall, leafy, from a bulbous rootstock composed of\r\nnumerous fleshy white scales. Leaves: Lance-shaped, to oblong;\r\nusually in whorls of fours to tens, or some alternate. Fruit: An\r\nerect, oblong, 3-celled capsule, the flat, horizontal seeds\r\npacked in 2 rows in each cavity.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, low meadows; moist fields. Flowering\r\nSeason - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Georgia, westward beyond the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nNot our gorgeous lilies that brighten the low-lying meadows in\r\nearly summer with pendent, swaying bells; possibly not a true\r\nlily at all was chosen to illustrate the truth which those who\r\nlistened to the Sermon on the Mount, and we, equally anxious,\r\nfoolishly overburdened folk of to-day, so little comprehend.\r\n\r\n     \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;\r\n        they toil not, neither do they spin\r\n      And yet I say unto you,\r\n      That even Solomon in all his glory\r\n        was not arrayed like one of these.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions differ as to the lily of Scripture. Eastern peoples use\r\nthe same word interchangeably for the tulip, anemone, ranunculus,\r\niris, the water-lilies, and those of the field. The superb\r\nScarlet Martagon Lily (L. chalcedonicum), grown in gardens here,\r\nis not uncommon wild in Palestine; but whoever has seen the large\r\nanemones there \"carpeting every plain and luxuriantly pervading\r\nthe land\" is inclined to believe that Jesus, who always chose the\r\nmost familiar objects in the daily life of His simple listeners\r\nto illustrate His teachings, rested His eyes on the slopes about\r\nHim glowing with anemones in all their matchless loveliness. What\r\nflower served Him then matters not at all. It is enough that\r\nscientists - now more plainly than ever before - see the\r\nuniversal application of the illustration the more deeply they\r\nstudy nature, and can include their \"little brothers of the air\"\r\nand the humblest flower at their feet when they say with Paul,\r\n\"In God we live and move and have our being.\"\r\n\r\nTallest and most prolific of bloom among our native lilies, as it\r\nis the most variable in color, size, and form, the TURK'S CAP, or\r\nTURBAN LILY (L. superburn), sometimes nearly merges its identity\r\ninto its Canadian sister's. Travelers by rail between New York\r\nand Boston know how gorgeous are the low meadows and marshes in\r\nJuly or August, when its clusters of deep yellow, orange, or\r\nflame-colored lilies tower above the surrounding vegetation. Like\r\nthe color of most flowers, theirs intensifies in salt air.\r\nCommonly from three to seven lilies appear in a terminal group;\r\nbut under skilful cultivation even forty will crown the stalk\r\nthat reaches a height of nine feet where its home suits it\r\nperfectly; or maybe only a poor array of dingy yellowish caps top\r\na shriveled stem when unfavorable conditions prevail. There\r\ncertainly are times when its specific name seems extravagant.\r\n\r\nIts range is from Maine to the Carolinas, westward to Minnesota\r\nand Tennessee. A well-conducted Turk's cap is not bell-shaped at\r\nmaturity, like the Canada lily: it should open much farther,\r\nuntil the six points of its perianth curve so far backward beyond\r\nthe middle as to expose the stamens for nearly their entire\r\nlength. One of the purple-dotted divisions of the flower when\r\nspread out flat may measure anywhere from two and a half to four\r\ninches in length. Smooth, lance-shaped leaves, tapering at both\r\nends, occur in whorls of threes to eights up the stem, or the\r\nupper ones may be alternate. Abundant food, hidden in a round,\r\nwhite-shingled storehouse under ground, nourishes the plant, and\r\nsimilarly its bulb-bearing kin, when emergency may require - a\r\nthrifty arrangement that serves them in good stead during\r\nprolonged drought and severe winters.\r\n\r\nWhy, one may ask, are some lilies radiantly colored and speckled;\r\nothers, like the Easter lily, deep chaliced, white, spotless?\r\nNow, in all our lily kin nectar is secreted in a groove at the\r\nbase of each of the six divisions of the flower, and upon its\r\nremoval by that insect best adapted to come in contact with\r\nanthers and stigma as it flies from lily to lily depends all hope\r\nof perpetuating the lovely race. For countless ages it has been\r\nthe flower's business to find what best pleased the visitors on\r\nwhom so much depended. Some lilies decided to woo one class of\r\ninsects; some, another. Those which literally set their caps for\r\ncolor-loving bees and butterflies whose long tongues could easily\r\ndrain nectar deeply hidden from the mob for their special\r\nbenefit, assumed gay hues, speckling the inner side of their\r\nspreading divisions, even providing lines as pathfinders to their\r\nnectaries in some cases, lest a visitor try to thrust in his\r\ntongue between the petal-like parts while standing on the\r\noutside, and so defeat their well-laid plan. It is almost\r\npathetic to see how bright and spotted they are inside, that the\r\nvisitor may not go astray. Thus we find the chief pollenizers of\r\nthe Canada and the Turk's cap lilies to be specialized bees, the\r\ninteresting upholsterers, or 1eaf-cutters, conspicuous among the\r\nthrong. Nectar they want, of course; but the dark, rich pollen is\r\nneeded also to mix with it for the food supply of a generation\r\nstill unborn. Anyone who has smelled a lily knows how his nose\r\nlooks afterward. The bees have no difficulty whatever in removing\r\nlily pollen and transferring it. So much for the colored lilies.\r\n\r\nThe long, white, trumpet-shape type of lily chooses for her lover\r\nthe sphinx moth. For him she wears a spotless white robe -\r\nspeckles would be superfluous - that he may see it shine in the\r\ndusk, when colored flowers melt into the prevailing blackness;\r\nfor him she breathes forth a fragrance almost overwhelming at\r\nevening, to guide him to her neighborhood from afar; in\r\nconsideration of his very long, slender tongue she hides her\r\nsweets so deep that none may rob him of it, taking the additional\r\nprecaution to weld her six once separate parts together into a\r\nsolid tube lest any pilferer thrust in his tongue from the side.\r\n\r\nThe common orange-tan DAY LILY (Hemerocallis fulva) and the\r\ncommoner speckled, orange-red TIGER LILY (L. tigrinum) are not\r\nslow in seizing opportunities to escape from gardens into\r\nroadsides and fence corners.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW ADDER'S TONGUE; TROUT LILY; DOG-TOOTH \"VIOLET\"\r\n  (Erythronium Americanum)  Lily family\r\n\r\nFlower - Solitary, pale russet yellow, rarely tinged with purple,\r\nslightly fragrant, 1 to 2 in. long, nodding from the summit of a\r\nfootstalk 6 to 12 in. high, or about as tall as the leaves.\r\nPerianth bell-shaped, of 6 petal-like, distinct segments,\r\nspreading at tips, dark spotted within; 6 stamens; the\r\nclub-shaped style with 3 short, stigmatic ridges. Leaves: 2,\r\nunequal, grayish green, mottled and streaked with brown or all\r\ngreen, oblong, 3 to 8 in. long, narrowing into clasping petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist open woods and thickets, brooksides.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nColonies of these dainty little lilies, that so often grow beside\r\nleaping brooks where and when the trout hide, justify at least\r\none of their names; but they have nothing in common with the\r\nviolet or a dog's tooth. Their faint fragrance rather suggests a\r\ntulip; and as for the bulb, which in some of the lily-kin has\r\ntooth-like scales, it is in this case a smooth, egg-shaped corm,\r\nproducing little round offsets from its base. Much fault is also\r\nfound with another name on the plea that the curiously mottled\r\nand delicately pencilled leaves bring to mind, not a snake's\r\ntongue, but its skin, as they surely do. Whoever sees the sharp\r\npurplish point of a young plant darting above ground in earliest\r\nspring, however, at once sees the fitting application of adder's\r\ntongue. But how few recognize their plant friends at all seasons\r\nof the year!\r\n\r\nEvery one must have noticed the abundance of low-growing spring\r\nflowers in deciduous woodlands, where, later in the year, after\r\nthe leaves overhead cast a heavy shade, so few blossoms are to be\r\nfound, because their light is seriously diminished. The thrifty\r\nadder's tongue, by laying up nourishment in its storeroom\r\nunderground through the winter, is ready to send its leaves and\r\nflower upward to take advantage of the sunlight the still naked\r\ntrees do not intercept, just as soon as the ground thaws. But the\r\nspring beauty, the rue-anemone, bloodroot, toothwort, and the\r\nfirst blue violet (palmata) among other early spring flowers,\r\nhave not been slow to take advantage of the light either. Fierce\r\ncompetition, therefore, rages among them to secure visits from\r\nthe comparatively few insects then flying - a competition so\r\nsevere that the adder's tongue often has to wait until afternoon\r\nfor the spring beauty to close before receiving a single caller.\r\nHive-bees, and others only about half their size, of the Andrena\r\nand Halictus clans, the first to fly, the Bombylius frauds, and\r\ncommon yellow butterflies, come in numbers then. Guided by the\r\nspeckles to the nectaries at the base of the flower, they must\r\neither cling to the stamens and style while they suck, or fall\r\nout. Thus cross-fertilization is commonly effected; but in the\r\nabsence of insects the lily can fertilize itself. Crawling\r\npilferers rarely think it worthwhile to slip and slide up the\r\nsmooth footstalk and risk a tumble where it curves to allow the\r\nflower to nod - the reason why this habit of growth is so\r\npopular. The adder's tongue, which is extremely sensitive to the\r\nsunlight, will turn on its stalk to follow it, and expand in its\r\nwarmth. At night it nearly closes.\r\n\r\nA similar adder's tongue, bearing a white flower, purplish tinged\r\non the outside, yellow at the base within to guide insects to the\r\nnectaries, is the WHITE ADDER'S TONGUE (E. albidum), rare in the\r\nEastern States, but quite common westward as far as Texas and\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW CLINTONIA\r\n  (Clintonia borealis)  Lily-of-the-valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Straw color or greenish yellow, less than 1 in. long, 3\r\nto 6 nodding on slender pedicels from the summit of a leafless\r\nscape 6 to 15 in. tall. Perianth of 6 spreading divisions, the 6\r\nstamens attached; style, 3-lobed. Leaves: Dark, glossy, large,\r\noval to oblong, 2 to 5 (usually 3), sheathing at the base. Fruit.\r\nOval blue berries on upright pedicels.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, rich, cool woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - From the Carolinas and Wisconsin far northward.\r\n\r\nTo name canals, bridges, city thoroughfares, booming factory\r\ntowns after DeWitt Clinton seems to many appropriate enough; but\r\nwhy a shy little woodland flower? As fitly might a wee white\r\nviolet carry down the name of Theodore Roosevelt to posterity!\r\n\"Gray should not have named the flower from the Governor of New\r\nYork,\" complains Thoreau. \"What is he to the lovers of flowers in\r\nMassachusetts? If named after a man, it must be a man of\r\nflowers.\" So completely has Clinton, the practical man of\r\naffairs, obliterated Clinton, the naturalist, from the popular\r\nmind, that, were it not for this plant keeping his memory green,\r\nwe should be in danger of forgetting the weary, overworked\r\ngovernor, fleeing from care to the woods and fields; pursuing in\r\nthe open air the study which above all others delighted and\r\nrefreshed him; revealing in every leisure moment a too-often\r\nforgotten side of his many-sided greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CUCUMBER-ROOT\r\n (Medeola Virginiana)  Lily-of-the-valley family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish yellow, on fine, curving footstalks, in a\r\nloose cluster above a circle of leaves. Perianth of 6 wide-spread\r\ndivisions about 1/4 in. long; 6 reddish-brown stamens; 3 long\r\nreddish-brown styles, stigmatic on inner side. Stem: 1 to 2 1/2\r\nft. high, unbranched, cottony when young. Leaves: Of flowering\r\nplants, in 2 whorls; lower whorl of 5 to 9 large, thin, oblong,\r\ntaper-pointed leaves above the middle of stem; upper whorl of 3\r\nto 5 small, oval, pointed leaves 1 to 2 in. long, immediately\r\nunder flowers. Flowerless plants with a whorl at summit. Fruit:\r\nRound, dark-purple berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and Minnesota, southward nearly to the\r\nGulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAgain we see the leaves of a plant coming to the aid of otherwise\r\ninconspicuous flowers to render them more attractive. By placing\r\nthemselves in a circle just below these little spidery blossoms\r\nof weak and uncertain coloring, some of the Indian cucumber's\r\nleaves certainly make them at least noticeable, if not showy. It\r\nwould be short-sighted philanthropy on the leaves' part to help\r\nthe flowers win insect wooers at the expense of the plant's\r\ngeneral health; therefore those in the upper whorl are fewer and\r\nmuch smaller than the leaves in the lower circle, and a\r\nsufficient length of stem separates them to allow the sunlight\r\nand rain to conjure with the chlorophyll in the group below.\r\nWhile there is a chance of nectar being pilfered from the flowers\r\nby ants, the stem is cottony and ensnares their feet. In\r\nSeptember, when small clusters of dark-purple berries replace the\r\nflowers, and rich tints dye the leaves, the plant is truly\r\nbeautiful - of course to invite migrating birds to disperse its\r\nseeds. It is said the Indians used to eat the horizontal, white,\r\nfleshy rootstock, which has a flavor like a cucumber's.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRION-FLOWER\r\n  (Smilax herbacea)  Smilax family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Carrion-scented, yellowish-green, 15 to 80 small,\r\n6-parted ones clustered in an umbel on a long peduncle. Stem:\r\nSmooth, unarmed, climbing with the help of tendril-like\r\nappendages from the base of leafstalks. Leaves: Egg-shaped,\r\nheart-shaped, or rounded, pointed tipped, parallel-nerved,\r\npetioled. Fruit: Bluish-black berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, thickets, woods, roadside fences.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Northern Canada to the Gulf States, westward to\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\n\"It would be safe to say,\" says John Burroughs, \"that there is a\r\nspecies of smilax with an unsavory name, that the bee does not\r\nvisit, herbacea. The production of this plant is a curious freak\r\nof nature.... It would be a cruel joke to offer it to any person\r\nnot acquainted with it, to smell. It is like the vent of a\r\ncharnel-house.\" (Thoreau compared its odor to that of a dead rat\r\nin a wall!) \"It is first cousin to the trilliums, among the\r\nprettiest of our native wild flowers,\" continues Burroughs, \"and\r\nthe same bad blood crops out in the purple trillium or\r\nbirthroot.\"\r\n\r\nStrange that so close an observer as Burroughs or Thoreau should\r\nnot have credited the carrion-flower with being something more\r\nintelligent than a mere repellent freak! Like the purple trillium\r\n(q.v.), it has deliberately adapted itself to please its\r\nbenefactors, the little green flesh flies so commonly seen about\r\nuntidy butcher shops in summer. These, sharing with many beetles\r\nthe unthankful task of removing putrid flesh and fowl from the\r\nearth, acting the part of scavengers for nature, are naturally\r\nattracted to carrion-scented flowers. Of these they have an\r\nungrudged monopoly. But the purple trillium has an additional\r\nadvantage in both smelling and looking like the same thing - a\r\npiece of raw meat past its prime. Bees and butterflies, with\r\ntheir highly developed aesthetic sense, ever delighting in\r\nbeautiful colors, perfume, and nectar, naturally let such flowers\r\nas these alone - another object aimed at by them, for then the\r\nflies get all the pollen they can eat. Some they transfer, of\r\ncourse, from the larger staminate flowers to the smaller\r\npistillate ones as they crawl over one umbel of the\r\ncarrion-flower, then alight on another.\r\n\r\nPresently fruit begins to set, and we can approach the luxuriant\r\nvine without offence to our noses. The beautiful glossy green\r\nfoliage takes on resplendent tints in early autumn - again with\r\ninterested motives, for are there not seeds within the little\r\nbluish-black berries, waiting for the birds to distribute them\r\nduring their migration?\r\n\r\nThe vicious CATBRIER, GREENBRIER, or HORSEBRIER (S.\r\nrotundifolia), similar to the preceding, except that its\r\nfour-angled stem is well armed with green prickles, its beautiful\r\nglossy, decorative leaves are more rounded, and its greenish\r\nflower umbels lack foul odor, scarcely needs description. Who has\r\nnot encountered it in the roadside and woodland thickets, where\r\nit defiantly bars the way?\r\n\r\nIn the most inaccessible part of such a briery tangle, that\r\nrollicking polyglot, the yellow-breasted chat, loves to hide its\r\nnest. Indeed, many birds can say with Br'er Rabbit that they were\r\n\"bred en bawn in a brier-patch.\" Throughout the eastern half of\r\nthe United $tates and Upper Canada the catbrier displays its\r\ninsignificant little blossoms from April to June for a\r\nmiscellaneous lot of flies - insects which are content with the\r\nslightest floral attractions offered. The florist's staple vine\r\npopularly known as \"SMILAX\" (Myrslphyllum asparagoides), a native\r\nof the Cape of Good Hope, is not even remotely connected with\r\ntrue Smilaceae.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW STAR-GRASS\r\n  (Hypoxis hirsuta; H. erecta of Gray)  Amaryllis family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow within, greenish and hairy outside, about\r\n1/2 in. across, 6-parted; the perianth divisions spreading,\r\nnarrowly oblong; a few flowers at the summit of a rough, hairy\r\nscape 2 to 6 in. high. Leaves: All from an egg-shaped corm;\r\nmostly longer than scapes, slender, grass-like, more or less\r\nhairy.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, open woods, prairies, grassy waste\r\nplaces, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - May-October.\r\nDistribution - From Maine far westward, and south to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nUsually only one of these little blossoms in a cluster on each\r\nplant opens at a time; but that one peers upward so brightly from\r\namong the grass it cannot well be overlooked. Sitting in a meadow\r\nsprinkled over with these yellow stars, we see coming to them\r\nmany small bees - chiefly Halictus - to gather pollen for their\r\nunhatched babies' bread. Of course they do not carry all the\r\npollen to their tunneled nurseries; some must often be rubbed off\r\non the sticky pistil tip in the center of other stars. The\r\nstamens radiate, that self-fertilization need not take place\r\nexcept as a last extremity. Visitors failing, the little flower\r\ncloses, bringing its pollen-laden anthers in contact with its own\r\nstigma.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKBERRY LILY\r\n  (Gemmingia Ciminensis; Pardanthus Chinensis of Gray)  Iris\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Deep orange color, speckled irregularly with crimson\r\nand purple within (Pardos = leopard; anthos = flower); borne in\r\nterminal, forked clusters. Perianth of 6 oblong, petal-like,\r\nspreading divisions; 6 stamens with linear anthers; style\r\nthickest above, with 3 branches. Stem: 1 1/2 to 4 ft. tall,\r\nleafy. Leaves: Like the iris; erect, folded blades, 8 to 10 in.\r\nlong. Fruit: Resembling a blackberry; an erect mass of round,\r\nblack, fleshy seeds, at first concealed in a fig-shaped capsule,\r\nwhose 3 valves curve backward, and finally drop off.\r\nPreferred habitat - Roadsides and hills.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Connecticut to Georgia, westward to Indiana and\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nHow many beautiful foreign flowers, commonly grown in our gardens\r\nhere, might soon become naturalized Americans were we only\r\ngenerous enough to lift a few plants, scatter a few seeds over\r\nour fences into the fields and roadsides - to raise the bars of\r\ntheir prison, as it were, and let them free! Many have run away,\r\nto be sure. Once across the wide Atlantic, or wider Pacific,\r\ntheir passage paid (not sneaking in among the ballast like the\r\nmore fortunate weeds), some are doomed to stay in prim, rigidly\r\ncultivated flower beds forever; others, only until a chance to\r\nbolt for freedom presents itself, and away they go. Lucky are\r\nthey if every flower they produce is not picked before a single\r\nseed can be set.\r\n\r\nThis blackberry lily of gorgeous hue originally came from China.\r\nEscaping from gardens here and there, it was first reported as a\r\nwild flower at East Rock, Connecticut; other groups of vagabonds\r\nwere met marching along the roadsides on Long Island; near\r\nSuffern, New York; then farther southward and westward, until it\r\nhas already attained a very respectable range. Every plant has\r\nsome good device for sending its offspring away from home to\r\nfound new colonies, if man would but let it alone. Better still,\r\ngive the eager travelers a lift!\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE YELLOW LADY'S SLIPPER; WHIPPOORWILL'S SHOE; YELLOW MOCCASIN\r\nFLOWER\r\n  (Cypripedium hirsutum; C. pubescens of Gray)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlower - Solitary, large, showy, borne at the top of a leafy stem\r\nto 2 ft. high. Sepals 3, 2 of them united, greenish or yellowish,\r\nstriped with purple or dull red, very long, narrow; 2 petals,\r\nbrown, narrower, twisting; the third an inflated sac, open at the\r\ntop, 1 to 2 in. long, pale yellow, purple lined white hairs\r\nwithin; sterile stamen triangular; stigma thick. Leaves: Oval or\r\nelliptic, pointed, 3 to 5 in, long, parallel-nerved, sheathing.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist or boggy woods and thickets; hilly\r\nground.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Alabama, westward to Minnesota and\r\nNebraska.\r\n\r\nSwinging outward from a leaf-clasped stem, this orchid attracts\r\nus by its flaunted beauty and decorative form from tip to root,\r\nnot less than the aesthetic little bees for which its adornment\r\nand mechanism are so marvelously adapted. Doubtless the heavy,\r\noily odor is an additional attraction to them. Parallel purplish\r\nlines, converging toward the circular opening of the pale yellow,\r\ninflated pouch, guide the visitor into a spacious banquet-hall\r\n(labellum) such as the pink lady's slipper (q.v.) also entertains\r\nher guests in. Fine hairs within secrete tiny drops of fluid at\r\ntheir tips - a secretion which hardens into a brittle crust, like\r\na syrup's, when it dries. Darwin became especially interested in\r\nthis flower through a delightful correspondence with Professor\r\nAsa Gray, who was the first to understand it, and he finally\r\nsecured a specimen to experiment on.\r\n\r\n\"I first introduced some flies into the labellum through the\r\nlarge upper opening,\" Darwin wrote, \"but they were either too\r\nlarge or too stupid, and did not crawl out properly. I then\r\ncaught and placed within the labellum a very small bee which\r\nseemed of about the right size, namely Andrena parvula.... The\r\nbee vainly endeavored to crawl out again the same way it entered,\r\nbut always fell backwards, owing to the margins being inflected.\r\nThe labellum thus acts like one of those conical traps with the\r\nedges turned inwards, which are sold to catch beetles and\r\ncockroaches in London kitchens. It could not creep out through\r\nthe slit between the folded edges of the basal part of the\r\nlabellum, as the elongated, triangular, rudimentary stamen here\r\ncloses the passage. Ultimately it forced its way out through one\r\nof the small orifices close to one of the anthers, and was found\r\nwhen caught to be smeared with the glutinous pollen. I then put\r\nthe same bee into another labellum; and again it crawled out\r\nthrough one of the small orifices, always covered with pollen. I\r\nrepeated the operation five times, always with the same result. I\r\nafterwards cut away the labellum, so as to examine the stigma,\r\nand found its whole surface covered with pollen. It should be\r\nnoticed that an insect in making its escape, must first brush\r\npast the stigma and afterwards one of the anthers, so that it\r\ncannot leave pollen on the stigma, until being already smeared\r\nwith pollen from one flower it enters another; and thus there\r\nwill be a good chance of cross-fertilization between two distinct\r\nplants.... Thus the use of all parts of the flower, - namely, the\r\ninflected edges, or the polished inner sides of the labellum; the\r\ntwo orifices and their position close to the anthers and stigma,\r\n- the large size of the medial rudimentary stamen, - are rendered\r\nintelligible. An insect which enters the labellum is thus\r\ncompelled to crawl out by one of the two narrow passages, on the\r\nsides of which the pollen-masses and stigma are placed.\"\r\n\r\nThese common orchids, which are not at all difficult to\r\nnaturalize in a well-drained, shady spot in the garden, should be\r\nlifted with a good ball of earth and plenty of leaf-mould\r\nimmediately after flowering. Here we can note little American\r\nAndrena bees unwittingly becoming the flower's slaves. Several\r\nspecies of exotic cypripediums are so common in the city\r\nflorist's shops every one has an opportunity to study their\r\nmarvelous structure.\r\n\r\nThe similar SMALL YELLOW LADY'S SLIPPER (C. parviflorum), a\r\ndelicately fragrant orchid about half the size of its big sister,\r\nhas a brighter yellow pouch, and occasionally its sepals and\r\npetals are purplish. As they usually grow in the same localities,\r\nand have the same blooming season, opportunities for comparison\r\nare not lacking. This fairer, sweeter, little orchid roams\r\nwestward as far as the State of Washington.\r\n\r\nYELLOW FRINGED ORCHIS\r\n  (Habenaria ciliaris)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow or orange, borne in a showy, closely set,\r\noblong spike, 3 to 6 in. long. The lip of each flower copiously\r\nfringed; the slender spur 1 to 1 1/2 in. long; similar to white\r\nfringed orchis (q.v.); and between the two, intermediate pale\r\nyellow hybrids may be found. Stem: Slender, leafy, 1 to 2 1/2\r\nfeet high. Leaves: Lance-shaped, clasping.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist meadows and sandy bogs.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Vermont to Florida; Ontario to Texas.\r\n\r\nWhere this brilliant, beautiful orchid and its lovely white\r\nsister grow together in the bog - which cannot be through a very\r\nwide range, since one is common northward, where the other is\r\nrare, and vice versa - the yellow fringed orchis will be found\r\nblooming a few days later. In general structure the plants\r\nclosely resemble each other. Their similar method of enforcing\r\npayment for a sip of nectar concealed in a tube so narrow and\r\ndeep none but a sphinx moth or butterfly may drain it all (though\r\nlarge bumblebees occasionally get some too, from brimming\r\nnectaries) has been described (q.v.), to which the interested\r\nreader is referred. Both these orchids have their sticky discs\r\nprojecting unusually far, as if raised on a pedicel - an\r\narrangement which indicates that they \"are to be stuck to the\r\nface or head of some nectar-sucking insect of appropriate size\r\nthat visits the flowers,\" wrote Dr. Asa Gray over forty years\r\nago. Various species of hawk moths, common in different parts of\r\nour area, of course have tongues of various lengths, and\r\nnaturally every visitor does not receive his load of pollen on\r\nthe same identical spot. At dusk, when sphinx moths begin their\r\nrounds, it will be noticed that the white and yellow flowers\r\nremain conspicuous long after blossoms of other colors have\r\nmelted into the general darkness. Such flowers as cater to these\r\nmoths, if they have fragrance, emit it then most strongly, as an\r\nadditional attraction. Again, it will be noticed that few such\r\nflowers provide a strong projecting petal-platform for visitors\r\nto alight on; that would be superfluous, since sphinx moths suck\r\nwhile hovering over a tube, with their wings in exceedingly rapid\r\nmotion, just like a hummingbird, for which the larger species are\r\nso often mistaken at twilight. This deep-hued orchid apparently\r\nattracts as many butterflies as sphinx moths, which show a\r\npredilection for the white species.\r\n\r\n>From Ontario and the Mississippi eastward, and southward to the\r\nGulf, the TUBERCLED or SMALL PALE GREEN ORCHIS (H. flava) lifts a\r\nspire of inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers, more attractive\r\nto the eye of the structural botanist than to the aesthete. It\r\nblooms in moist places, as most orchids do, since water with\r\nwhich to manufacture nectar enough to fill their deep spurs is a\r\nprime necessity. Orchids have arrived at that pinnacle of\r\nachievement that it is impossible for them to fertilize\r\nthemselves. More than that, some are absolutely sterile to their\r\nown pollen when it is applied to their stigmas artificially with\r\ninsect aid, however, a single plant has produced over 1,000,700\r\nseeds. No wonder, then, that, as a family, they have adopted the\r\nmost marvelous blandishments and mechanism in the whole floral\r\nkingdom to secure the visits of that special insect to which each\r\nis adapted, and, having secured him, to compel him unwittingly to\r\ndo their bidding. In the steaming tropical jungles, where\r\nvegetation is luxuriant to the point of suffocation, and where\r\ninsect life swarms in mvriads undreamed of here, we can see the\r\nbest of reasons for orchids mounting into trees and living on air\r\nto escape strangulation on the ground, and for donning larger and\r\nmore gorgeous apparel to attract attention in the fierce\r\ncompetition for insect trade waged about them. Here, where the\r\nstruggle for survival is incomparably easier, we have terrestrial\r\norchids, small, and quietly clad, for the most part.\r\n\r\nHaving the gorgeous, exotic air plants of the hothouse in mind,\r\nthis little tubercled orchis seems a very poor relation indeed.\r\nIn June and July, about a week before the ragged orchis comes\r\nout, we may look for this small, fringeless sister. Its clasping\r\nleaves, which decrease in size as they ascend the stem (not to\r\nshut off the light and rain from the lower ones), are\r\nparallel-veined, elliptic, or, the higher ones, lance-shaped. A\r\nprominent tubercle, or palate, growing upward from the lip,\r\nalmost conceals the entrance to the nectary. and makes a side\r\napproach necessary. Why? Usually an insect has free, straight\r\naccess down the center of a flower's throat, but here he cannot\r\nhave it. A slender tongue must be directed obliquely from above\r\ninto the spur, and it will enter the discal groove as a thread\r\nenters the eye of a needle. By this arrangement the tongue must\r\ncertainly come in contact with one of the sticky discs to which\r\nan elongated pollen gland is attached. The cement on the disc\r\nhardening even while the visitor sucks, the pollen gland is\r\ntherefore drawn out, because firmly attached to his tongue. At\r\nfirst the pollen mass stands erect on the proboscis; but in the\r\nfraction of a moment which it takes a butterfly to flit to\r\nanother blossom, it has bent forward automatically into the exact\r\nposition required for it to come in contact with the sticky\r\nstigma of the next tubercled orchis entered, where it will be\r\nbroken off. Now we understand the use of the palate. Butterfly\r\ncollectors often take specimens with remnants of these pollen\r\nstumps stuck to their tongues. In his classical work \"On the\r\nFertilization of Orchids by Insects,\" Darwin tells of finding a\r\nmottled rustic butterfly whose proboscis was decorated with\r\neleven pairs of pollen masses, taken from as many blossoms of the\r\npyramidal orchis. Have these flowers no mercy on their\r\nlong-suffering friends? A bee with some orchid pollen-stumps\r\nattached to its head was once sent to Mr. Frank Cheshire, the\r\nEnglish expert who had just discovered some strange bee diseases.\r\nHe was requested to name the malady that had caused so abnormal\r\nan outgrowth on the bee's forehead!\r\n\r\nOften found growing in the same bog with the tubercled species is\r\nthe RAGGED or FRINGED GREEN ORCHIS (H. lacera), so inconspicuous\r\nwe often overlook it unawares. Examine one of the dingy,\r\ngreenish-yellow flowers that are set along the stern in a spike\r\nto make all the show in the world possible, each with its\r\nthree-parted, spreading lip finely and irregularly cut into\r\nthread-like fringe to hail the passing butterfly, and we shall\r\nsee that it, too, has made ingenious provision against the\r\ndraining of its spur by a visitor without proper pay for his\r\nentertainment. Even without the gay color that butterflies ever\r\ndelight in, these flowers contain so much nectar in their spurs,\r\nneither butterflies nor large bumblebees are long in hunting them\r\nout. In swamps and wet woodland from Nova Scotia to Georgia, and\r\nwestward to the Mississippi, the ragged orchis blooms in June or\r\nJuly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE YELLOW POND or WATER LILY; COW LILY; SPATTER-DOCK\r\n  (Nymphaea advena; Nupisar advena of Gray)  Water-lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow or greenish outside, rarely purple tinged,\r\nround, depressed, 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 in. across. Sepals 6, unequal,\r\nconcave, thick, fleshy; petals stamen-like, oblong, fleshy,\r\nshort; stamens very numerous, in 5 to 7 rows; pistil compounded\r\nof many carpels, its stigmatic disc pale red or yellow, with 12\r\nto 24 rays. Leaves: Floating, or some immersed, large, thick,\r\nsometimes a foot long, egg-shaped or oval, with a deep cleft at\r\nbase, the lobes rounded.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Standing water, ponds, slow streams.\r\nFlowering Season - April-September.\r\nDistribution - Rocky Mountains eastward, south to the Gulf of\r\nMexico, north to Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nComparisons were ever odious. Because the yellow water lily has\r\nthe misfortune to claim relationship with the sweet-scented white\r\nspecies (q.v.), must it never receive its just meed of praise?\r\nHiawatha's canoe, let it be remembered,\r\n\r\n     \"Floated on the river\r\n      Like a yellow leaf in autumn,\r\n      Like a yellow water-lily.\"\r\n\r\nBut even those who admire Longfellow's lines see no beauty in the\r\ngolden flower-bowls floating among the large, lustrous, leathery\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nBy assuming the functions of petals, the colored sepals advertise\r\nfor insects. Beetles, which answer the first summons to a free\r\nlunch, crowd in as the sepals begin to spread. In the center the\r\nstar-like disc, already sticky, is revealed, and on it any pollen\r\nthey have carried with them from older flowers necessarily rubs\r\noff. At first, or while the stigma is freshly receptive to\r\npollen, an insect cannot make his entrance except by crawling\r\nover this large, sticky plate. At this time, the anthers being\r\nclosed, self-fertilization is impossible. A day or two later,\r\nafter the pollen begins to ripen on countless anthers, the flower\r\nis so widely open that visitors have no cause to alight in the\r\ncenter; anyway, no harm could result if they did,\r\ncross-fertilization having been presumably accomplished. While\r\nbeetles (especially Donacia) are ever abundant visitors, it is\r\nlikely they do much more harm than good. So eagerly do they gnaw\r\nboth petals and stamens, which look like loops of narrow yellow\r\nribbon within the bowl of an older flower, that, although they\r\nmust carry some pollen to younger flowers as they travel on, it\r\nis probable they destroy ten times more than their share. Flies\r\ntransport pollen too. The smaller bees (Halictus and Andrena\r\nchiefly) find some nectar secreted on the outer faces of the\r\nstamen-like petals, which they mix with pollen to make their\r\nbabies' bread.\r\n\r\nThe very beautiful native AMERICAN LOTUS (Nelumbo lutea), also\r\nknown as WATER CHINKAPIN or WANKAPIN, found locally in Ontario,\r\nthe Connecticut River, some lakes, slow streams, and ponds in New\r\nJersey, southward to Florida, and westward to Michigan and\r\nIllinois, Indian Territory and Louisiana, displays its pale\r\nyellow flowers in July and August. They measure from four to ten\r\ninches across, and suggest a yellow form of the sweet-scented\r\nwhite water lily; but there are fewer petals, gradually passing\r\ninto an indefinite number of stamens. The great round, ribbed\r\nleaves, smooth above, hairy beneath, may be raised high above the\r\nwater, immersed or floating. Both leaf and flower stalks contain\r\nseveral large air canals. The flowers which are female when they\r\nexpand far enough for a pollen-laden guest to crawl into the\r\ncenter, are afterward male, securing cross-fertilization by this\r\nmeans, just as the yellow pond lily does; only the small bees\r\nmust content themselves here with pollen only - a diet that\r\npleases the destructive beetles and the flies (Syrphidae)\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\nJapanese artists especially have taught us how much of the beauty\r\nof a Nelumbo we should lose if it ripened its decorative\r\nseed-vessel below the surface as the sweet-scented white water\r\nlily does. This flat-topped receptacle, held erect, has its\r\nlittle round nuts imbedded in pits in its surface, ready to be\r\npicked out by aquatic birds, and distributed by them in their\r\nwanderings. Both seeds and tubers are farinaceous and edible. In\r\nsome places it is known the Indians introduced the plant for\r\nfood. Professor Charles Goodyear has written an elaborate,\r\nplausible argument, illustrated, with many reproductions of\r\nsculpture, pottery, and mural painting in the civilized world of\r\nthe ancients to prove that all decorative ornamental design has\r\nbeen evolved from the sacred Egyptian lotus (Nelumbo Nelumubo),\r\nstill revered throughout the East (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSH MARIGOLD; MEADOW-GOWAN; AMERICAN COWSLIP\r\n (Caltha palustris)  Crowfoot family'\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright, shining yellow, 1 to 1 1/2 in. across, a few in\r\nterminal and axillary groups. No petals; usually 5 (often more)\r\noval, petal-like sepals; stamens numerous; many pistils (carpels)\r\nwithout styles. Stem: Stout, smooth, hollow, branching, 1 to 2\r\nft. high. Leaves: Mostly from root, rounded, broad, and\r\nheart-shaped at base, or kidney-shaped, upper ones almost\r\nsessile, lower ones on fleshy petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Springy ground, low meadows, swamps, river\r\nbanks, ditches.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Carolina to Iowa, the Rocky Mountains, and very\r\nfar north.\r\n\r\nNot a true marigold, and even less a cowslip, it is by these\r\nnames that this flower, which looks most like a buttercup, will\r\ncontinue to be called, in spite of the protests of scientific\r\nclassifiers. Doubtless the first of these folk-names refers to\r\nits use in church festivals during the Middle Ages as one of the\r\nblossoms devoted to the Virgin Mary.\r\n\r\n     \"And winking Mary-buds begin\r\n      To ope their golden eyes,\"\r\n\r\nsing the musicians in \"Cymbeline.\" Whoever has seen the watery\r\nAvon meadows in April, yellow and twinkling with marsh marigolds\r\nwhen \"the lark at heaven's gate sings,\" appreciates why the\r\ncommentators incline to identify Shakespeare's Mary-buds with the\r\nCaltha of these and our own marshes.\r\n\r\nNot for poet's rhapsodies, but for the more welcome hum of small\r\nbees and flies intent on breakfasting do these flowers open in\r\nthe morning sunshine. Nectar secreted on the sides of each of the\r\nmany carpels invites a conscientious bee all around the center,\r\non which she should alight to truly benefit her entertainer.\r\nHoney bees may be seen sucking only enough nectar to aid them in\r\nstoring pollen; bumblebees feasting for their own benefit, not\r\ntheir descendants'; little mining bees and quantities of flies\r\nalso, although not many species are represented among the\r\nvisitors, owing to the flower's early blooming season. Always\r\nconspicuous among the throng are the brilliant Syrphidae flies -\r\ngorgeous little creatures which show a fondness for blossoms as\r\ngaily colored as their own lustrous bodies. Indeed, these are the\r\nprincipal pollinators.\r\n\r\nSome country people who boil the young plants declare these\r\n\"greens\" are as good as spinach. What sacrilege to reduce crisp,\r\nglossy, beautiful leaves like these to a slimy mess in a pot! The\r\ntender buds, often used in white sauce as a substitute for\r\ncapers, probably do not give it the same piquancy where piquancy\r\nis surely most needed - on boiled mutton, said to be Queen\r\nVictoria's favorite dish. Hawked about the streets in tight\r\nbunches, the marsh-marigold blossoms - with half their yellow\r\nsepals already dropped - and the fragrant, pearly-pink arbutus\r\nare the most familiar spring wild flowers seen in Eastern cities.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON MEADOW BUTTERCUP; TALL CROWFOOT; KINGCUPS; CUCKOO FLOWER;\r\nGOLDCUPS; BUTTER-FLOWERS; BLISTER-FLOWERS\r\n\r\n  (Ranunculus acris)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright, shining yellow, about 1 in. across, numerous,\r\nterminating long slender footstalks. Calyx of 5 spreading sepals;\r\ncorolla of 5 petals; yellow stamens and carpels. Stem: Erect,\r\nbranched above, hairy (sometimes nearly smooth), 2 to 3 feet\r\ntall, from fibrous roots. Leaves: In a tuft from the base, long\r\npetioled, of 3 to 7 divisions cleft into numerous lobes; stem\r\nleaves nearly sessile, distant, 3-parted.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Meadows, fields, roadsides, grassy places.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe in Canada and the United\r\nStates; most common North.\r\n\r\nWhat youngster has not held these shining golden flowers under\r\nhis chin to test his fondness for butter? Dandelions and\r\nmarsh-marigolds may reflect their color in his clear skin too,\r\nbut the buttercup is every child's favorite. When\r\n\r\n     \"Cuckoo-buds of yellow hue\r\n      Do paint the meadows with delight,\"\r\n\r\ndaisies, pink clover, and waving timothy bear them company here;\r\nnot the \"daisies pied,\" violets, and lady-smocks of Shakespeare's\r\nEngland. How incomparably beautiful are our own meadows in June!\r\nBut the glitter of the buttercup, which is as nothing to the\r\nglitter of a gold dollar in the eyes of a practical farmer, fills\r\nhim with wrath when this immigrant takes possession of his\r\npastures. Cattle will not eat the acrid, caustic plant - a\r\nsufficient reason for most members of the Ranunculaceae to stoop\r\nto the low trick of secreting poisonous or bitter juices.\r\nSelf-preservation leads a cousin, the garden monk's hood, even to\r\nmurderous practices. Since children will put everything within\r\nreach into their mouths, they should be warned against biting the\r\nbuttercup's stem and leaves, that are capable of raising\r\nblisters. \"Beggars use the juice to produce sores upon their\r\nskin,\" says Mrs. Creevy. A designer might employ these\r\nexquisitely formed leaves far more profitably.\r\n\r\nThis and the bulbous buttercup, having so much else in common,\r\nhave also the same visitors. \"It is a remarkable fact,\" says Sir\r\nJohn Lubbock, \"as Aristotle long ago mentioned, that in most\r\ncases bees confine themselves in each journey to a single species\r\nof plant; though in the case of some very nearly allied forms\r\nthis is not so; for instance, it is stated on good authority\r\n(Muller) that Ranunculus acris, R. repens, and R. bulbosus are\r\nnot distinguished by the bees, or at least are visited\r\nindifferently by them, as is also the case with two of the\r\nspecies of clover.\" From what we already know of the brilliant\r\nSyrphidae flies' fondness for equally brilliant colors, it is not\r\nsurprising to find great numbers of them about the buttercups,\r\nwith bees, wasps, and beetles - upwards of sixty species. Modern\r\nscientists believe that the habit of feeding on flowers has\r\ncalled out the color-sense of insects and the taste for bright\r\ncolors, and that sexual selection has been guided by this taste.\r\nThe most unscientific among us soon finds evidence on every hand\r\nthat flowers and insects have developed together through mutual\r\ndependence.\r\n\r\nBy having its nourishment thriftily stored up underground all\r\nwinter, the BULBOUS BUTTERCUP (R. bulbosus) is able to steal a\r\nmarch on its fibrous-rooted sister that must accumulate hers all\r\nspring; consequently it is first to flower, coming in early May,\r\nand lasting through June. It is a low and generally more hairy\r\nplant, but closely resembling the tall buttercup in most\r\nrespects, and, like it, a naturalized European immigrant now\r\nthoroughly at home in fields and roadsides in most sections of\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nMuch less common is the CREEPING BUTTERCUP (R. repens), which\r\nspreads by runners until it forms large patches in fields and\r\nroadsides, chiefly in the Eastern States. Its leaves, which are\r\nsometimes blotched, are divided into three parts, the terminal\r\none, often all three, stalked. May-July.\r\n\r\nFirst to bloom in the vicinity of New York (from March to May) is\r\nthe HISPID BUTTERCUP (R. hispidus), densely hairy when young. The\r\nleaves, which are pinnately divided into from three to five\r\nleaflets, cleft or lobed, chiefly arise on long petioles from a\r\ncluster of thickened fibrous roots. The flower may be only half\r\nan inch or an inch and a half across. It is found in dry woods\r\nand thickets throughout the eastern half of the United States;\r\nwhereas the much smaller flowered BRISTLY BUTTERCUP (R.\r\nPennsylvanicus) shows a preference for low-lying meadows and wet,\r\nopen ground through a wider, more westerly range. Its stout,\r\nhollow, leafy stem, beset with stiff hairs, discourages the\r\ntongues of grazing animals. June-August.\r\n\r\nCommonest of the early buttercups is the TUFTED BUTTERCUP (R.\r\nfascicularis), a little plant seldom a foot high, found in the\r\nwoods and on rocky hillsides from Texas and Manitoba, east to the\r\nAtlantic, flowering in April or May. The long-stalked leaves are\r\ndivided into from three to five parts; the bright yellow flowers,\r\nwith rather narrow, distant petals, measure about an inch across.\r\nThey open sparingly, usually only one or two at a time on each\r\nplant, to favor pollination from another one.\r\n\r\nScattered patches of the SWAMP or MARSH BUTTERCUP (P.\r\nseptentrionalis) brighten low, rich meadows also with their-large\r\nsatiny yellow flowers, whose place in the botany even the\r\nuntrained eye knows at sight. The smooth, spreading plant\r\nsometimes takes root at the joints of its branches and sends\r\nforth runners, but the stems mostly ascend. The large lower\r\nmottled leaves are raised well out of the wet, or above the\r\ngrass, on long petioles. They have three divisions, each lobed\r\nand cleft. From Georgia and Kentucky far northward this buttercup\r\nblooms from April to July, opening only a few flowers at a time-a\r\nmethod which may make it less showy, but more certain to secure\r\ncross-pollination between distinct plants.\r\n\r\nThe YELLOW WATER BUTTERCUP or CROWFOOT (R. deiphinifolius; R.\r\nmultifidus of Gray) found blooming in ponds through the summer\r\nmonths, certainly justifies the family name derived from rana = a\r\nfrog. Many other members grow in marshes, it is true, but this\r\nranunculus lives after the manner of its namesake, sometimes\r\nimmersed, sometimes stranded on the muddy shore. Two types of\r\nleaves occur on the same stem. Their waving filaments, which make\r\nthe immersed leaves look fringy, take every advantage of what\r\nlittle carbonic acid gas is dissolved under the surface.\r\nMoreover, they are better adapted to withstand the water's\r\npressure and possible currents than solid blades would be. The\r\nfloating leaves which loll upon the surface to take advantage of\r\nthe air and sunlight, expand three, four, or five divisions,\r\nvariously lobed. On this plant we see one set of leaves perfectly\r\nadapted to immersion, and another set to aerial existence. The\r\nstem, which may measure several feet in length, roots at the\r\njoints when it can. Range from the Mississippi and Ontario\r\neastward to the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE WATER-CROWFOOT (Batrachium trichophyllum; Ranunculus\r\naquatilis of Gray) has its fine thread-like leaves entirely\r\nsubmerged; but the flowers, like a whale, as the old conundrum\r\nput it, come to the surface to blow. The latter are small, white,\r\nor only yellow at the base, where each petal bears a spot or\r\nlittle pit that serves as a pathfinder to the flies. When the\r\nwater rises unusually high, the blossoms never open, but remain\r\nsubmerged, and fertilize themselves. Seen underwater, the\r\ndelicate leaves, which are little more than forked hairs, spread\r\nabroad in dainty patterns; lifted cut of the water these flaccid\r\nfilaments utterly collapse. In ponds and shallow, slow streams,\r\nthis common plant flowers from June to September almost\r\nthroughout the Union, the British Possessions north of us, and in\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe WATER PLANTAIN SPEARWORT (K. obtusiusculus; R. a/isrnaefoiius\r\nof Gray) flecks the marshes from June to August with its small\r\ngolden flowers, which the merest novice knows must be kin to the\r\nbuttercup. The smooth, hollow stem, especially thick at the base,\r\nlikes to root from the lower joints. A peculiarity of the\r\nlance-shaped or oblong lance-shaped leaves is that the lower ones\r\nhave petioles so broad where they clasp the stem that they appear\r\nto be long blades suddenly contracted just above their base.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBERRY; PEPPERIDGE-BUSH\r\n  (Berberis vulgaris)  Barberry family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, small, odor disagreeable, 6-parted, borne in\r\ndrooping, many-flowered racemes from the leaf axils along arching\r\ntwigs. Stem: A much branched, smooth, gray shrub, to 8 ft. tall,\r\narmed with sharp spines. Leaves: From the 3-pronged spines\r\n(thorns); oval or obovate, bristly edged. Fruit: Oblong, scarlet,\r\nacid berries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Thickets; roadsides; dry or gravelly soil.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized in New England and Middle States; less\r\ncommon in Canada and the West. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nWhen the twigs of barberry bushes arch with the weight of\r\nclusters of beautiful bright berries in September, everyone must\r\ntake notice of a shrub so decorative, which receives scant\r\nattention from us, however, when its insignificant little flowers\r\nare out. Yet these blossoms, small as they are, are up to a\r\nmarvelous trick, quite as remarkable as the laurel's (q.v.) or\r\nthe calopogon's (q.v.), to compel insects to do their bidding.\r\nThree of the six sepals, by their size and color, attend to the\r\nadvertising, playing the part of a corolla; and partly by curving\r\ninward at the tip, partly by the drooping posture of the flower,\r\nhelp protect the stamens, pistil, and nectar glands within from\r\nrain. Did the flowers hang vertically, not obliquely, such\r\ncurvature of the tips of sepals and petals would be unnecessary.\r\nSix stamens surround a pistil, but each of their six anthers,\r\nwhich are in reality little pollen boxes opening by trap-doors on\r\neither side, is tucked under the curving tip of a petal at whose\r\nbase lie two orange-colored nectar glands. A small bee or fly\r\nenters the flower: what happens? To reach the nectar, he must\r\nprobe between the bases of two exceedingly irritable stamens. The\r\nmerest touch of a visitor's tongue against them releases two\r\nanthers, just as the nibbling mouse all unsuspectingly releases\r\nthe wire from the hook of the wooden trap he is caught in. As the\r\ntwo stamens spring upward on being released, pollen instantly\r\nflies out of the trap-doors of the anther boxes on the bee, which\r\nsuffers no greater penalty than being obliged to carry it to the\r\nstigma of another flower. So short are the stamens, it is\r\nimprobable that a flower's pollen ever reaches its own stigma\r\nexcept through the occasional confused fumbling of a visitor.\r\nUsually he is so startled by the sudden shower of pollen that he\r\nflies away instantly.\r\n\r\nIn the barberry bushes, as in the gorse, when grown in dry,\r\ngravelly situations, we see many leaves and twigs modified into\r\nthorns to diminish the loss of water through evaporation by\r\nexposing too much leaf surface to the sun and air. That such\r\nspines protect the plants which bear them from the ravages of\r\ngrazing cattle is, of course, an additional motive for their\r\npresence. Under cultivation, in well-watered garden soil - and\r\nhow many charming varieties of barberries are cultivated - the\r\nthorny shrub loses much of its armor, putting forth many more\r\nleaves, in rosettes, along more numerous twigs, instead. Even the\r\nprickly-pear cactus might become mild as a lamb were it to\r\nforswear sandy deserts and live in marshes instead. Country\r\npeople sometimes rob the birds of the acid berries to make\r\npreserves. The wood furnishes a yellow dye.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough it is the EUROPEAN BARBERRY that is the common\r\nspecies here. The AMERICAN BARBERRY (B. Canadensis), a lower\r\nshrub, with dark reddish-brown twigs; its leaves more distantly\r\ntoothed; its flowers, and consequently its berries, in smaller\r\nclusters, keeps almost exclusively to the woods in the Alleghany\r\nregion and in the southwest, in spite of its specific name.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPICE-BUSH; BENJAMIN-BUSH; WILD ALLSPICE; FEVER-BUSH\r\n  (Benzoin Benzoin; Lindera Benzoin of Gray)  Laurel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Before the leaves, lemon yellow, fragrant, small, in\r\nclusters close to the slender, brittle twigs. Six petal-like\r\nsepals; sterile flowers with 9 stamens in 3 series; fertile\r\nflowers with a round ovary encircled by abortive stamens. Stem: A\r\nsmooth shrub 4 to 20 ft. tall. Leaves: Alternate, entire, oval or\r\nelliptic, 2 to 5 in, long. Fruit: Oblong, red, berry-like drupes.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woodlands, thickets, beside streams.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Central New England, Ontario, and Michigan,\r\nsouthward to Carolina and Kansas.\r\n\r\nEven before the scaly catkins on the alders become yellow, or the\r\nsilvery velvet pussy willows expand to welcome the earliest bees\r\nthat fly, this leafless bush breathes a faint spicy fragrance in\r\nthe bleak gray woods. Its only rivals among the shrubbery, the\r\nservice-berry and its twin sister the shad-bush, have scarcely\r\nhad the temerity to burst into bloom when the little clusters of\r\nlemon-yellow flowers, cuddled close to the naked branches, give\r\nus our first delightful spring surprise. All the favor they ask\r\nof the few insects then flying is that they shall transfer the\r\npollen from the sterile to the fertile flowers as a recompense\r\nfor the early feast spread. Inasmuch as no single blossom\r\ncontains both stamens and pistil, little wonder the flowers\r\nshould woo with color and fragrance the guests on whose\r\nministrations the continuance of the species absolutely depends.\r\nLater, when the leaves appear, we may know as soon as we crush\r\nthem in the hand that the aromatic sassafras is next of kin. But\r\nages before Linnaeus published \"Species Plantarum\" butterflies\r\nhad discovered floral relationships.\r\n\r\nSharp eyes may have noticed how often the leaves on both the\r\nspice-bush and the sassafras tree are curled. Have you ever drawn\r\napart the leaf edges and been startled by the large, fat green\r\ncaterpillar, speckled with blue, whose two great black \"eyes\"\r\nstare up at you as he reposes in his comfortable nest - a cradle\r\nwhich also combines the advantages of a restaurant? This is the\r\ncaterpillar of the common spice-bush swallow-tail butterfly\r\n(Papilio troilus), an exquisite, dark, velvety creature with pale\r\ngreenish-blue markings on its hind wings. (See Dr. Holland's\r\n\"Butterfly Book,\" Plate XLI.) The yellow stage of this\r\ncaterpillar (which William Hamilton Gibson calls the \"spice-bush\r\nbugaboo\") indicates, he says, that \"its period of transformation\r\nis close at hand. Selecting a suitable situation, it spins a tiny\r\ntuft of silk, into which it entangles its hindmost pair of feet,\r\nafter which it forms a V-shaped loop about the front portion of\r\nits body, and hangs thus suspended, soon changing to a chrysalis\r\nof a pale wood color. These chrysalides commonly survive the\r\nwinter, and in the following June the beautiful 'blue\r\nswallow-tail' will emerge, and may be seen suggestively\r\nfluttering and poising about the spice and sassafras bushes.\"\r\nAfter the eggs she lays on them hatch, the caterpillars live upon\r\nthe leaves. Mrs. Starr Dana says the leaves were used as a\r\nsubstitute for tea during the Rebellion; and the powdered berries\r\nfor allspice by housekeepers in Revolutionary days.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATER CELANDINE; SWALLOW-WORT\r\n  (Chelidonium majus)  Poppy family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Lustreless yellow, about 1/2 in. across, on slender\r\npedicels, in a small umbel-like cluster. Sepals 2, soon falling;\r\n4 petals, many yellow stamens, pistil prominent. Stem: Weak, to 2\r\nft. high, branching, slightly hairy, containing bright orange\r\nacrid juice. Leaves: Thin, 4 to 8 in. long, deeply cleft into 5\r\n(usually) irregular oval lobes, the terminal one largest. Fruit:\r\nSmooth, slender, erect pods, 1 to 2 in, long, tipped with the\r\npersistent style.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry waste land, fields, roadsides, gardens,\r\nnear dwellings.\r\nFlowering Season - April-September.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe in Eastern United States.\r\n\r\nNot this weak invader of our roadsides, whose four yellow petals\r\nsuggest one of the cross-bearing mustard tribe, but the pert\r\nlittle LESSER CELANDINE, PILEWORT, or FIGWORT BUTTERCUP (Ficaria\r\nFicaria), one of the Crowfoot family, whose larger solitary\r\nsatiny yellow flowers so commonly star European pastures, was\r\nWordsworth's special delight - a tiny, turf-loving plant, about\r\nwhich much poetical association clusters. Having stolen passage\r\nacross the Atlantic, it is now making itself at home about\r\nCollege Point, Long Island; on Staten Island; near Philadelphia,\r\nand maybe elsewhere. Doubtless it will one day overrun our\r\nfields, as so many other European immigrants have done.\r\n\r\nThe generic Greek name of the greater celandine, meaning a\r\nswallow, was given it because it begins to bloom when the first\r\nreturning swallows are seen skimming over the water and freshly\r\nploughed fields in a perfect ecstasy of flight, and continues in\r\nflower among its erect seed capsules until the first cool days of\r\nautumn kill the gnats and small winged insects not driven to\r\ncover. Then the swallows, dependent on such fare, must go to\r\nwarmer climes where plenty still fly. Quaint old Gerarde claims\r\nthat the swallow-wort was so called because \"with this herbe the\r\ndams restore eye-sight to their young ones when their eye be put\r\nout\" by swallows. Coles asserts \"the swallow cureth her dim eyes\r\nwith celandine.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little satisfaction in picking a weed which droops\r\nimmediately, poppy fashion, and whose saffron juice stains\r\nwhatever it touches. A drop of this acrid fluid on the tip of the\r\ntongue is not soon forgotten. The luminous experiments of Darwin,\r\nLubbock, Wallace, Muller, and Sprengel, among others, have proved\r\nthat color in flowers exists for the purpose of attracting\r\ninsects. But how about colored juices in the blood-roots' and\r\npoppies' stems, for example; the bright stalk of the pokeweed,\r\nthe orange-yellow root of the carrot, the exquisite tints of\r\nautumn leaves, fungi, and seaweed? Besides the green color\r\n(chlorophyll), the most necessary of all ingredients to a plant\r\nare the lipochromes, which vary from yellow to red. These are\r\nmost conspicuous when they displace the chlorophyll in autumn\r\nfoliage. Then there are the anthocyans, ranging from magenta to\r\nblue and violet. These vary according to the amount of acid or\r\nalkali in the sap. Try the effect of immersing a blue morning\r\nglory in an acid solution, or a deep pink one in an alkaline\r\nsolution. One theory to account for the presence of color is that\r\nit exists to screen the plant's protoplasm from light; that it\r\nhas a physiological function with which insects have nothing\r\nwhatever to do; and that by its presence the temperature is\r\nraised and the plant is protected from cold. Every one who has\r\nhandled the colorless Indian pipe knows how cold and clammy it\r\nis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe YELLOW or CELANDINE POPPY (Stylophorum diphyllum), with\r\nshining yellow flowers double the size of the greater\r\ncelandine's, and similar pinnatifid leaves springing chiefly from\r\nthe base, blooms even in March and through the spring in the\r\nMiddle States and westward to Wisconsin and Missouri. Usually\r\nonly one of the few terminal blossoms opens at a time, but in\r\nlow, open woodlands it gleams like a miniature sun. Alas! that\r\nthe glorious CALIFORNIA POPPY, so commonly grown in Eastern\r\ngardens (Eschscholtzia Californica), should confine itself to a\r\nlimited range on the Pacific Coast. We have no true native\r\npoppies (Papaver) in America; such as are rarely to be seen in a\r\nwild state, have only locally escaped from cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN CORYDALIS\r\n  (Capnoides aureum; Corydalis aurea of Gray)  Poppy family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, about 1/2 in. long, with a spur half the\r\nlength of the tubular corolla; irregular, lipped; each upheld by\r\na little bract, mostly at a horizontal; borne in a terminal,\r\nshort raceme. Stem: Smooth, 6 to 14 in. high, branching. Leaves:\r\nFinely dissected, decom pound, petioled. Fruit: Sickle-shaped,\r\ndrooping pods, wavy lumped, and tipped with the style.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods, rocky banks.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - Minnesota to Nova Scotia and Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nA dainty little plant, next of kin to the pink corydalis (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK MUSTARD\r\n  (Brassica nigra)  Mustard family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, fading pale, 1/4 to 1/2 in. across,\r\n4-parted, in elongated racemes; quickly followed by narrow\r\nupright 4-sided pods about 1/2 in. long appressed against the\r\nstem. Stem: Erect, 2 to 7 ft. tall, branching. Leaves: Variously\r\nlobed and divided, finely toothed, the terminal lobe larger than\r\nthe 2 to 4 side ones.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, fields, neglected gardens.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - Common throughout our area; naturalized from\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\n\"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed,\r\nwhich a man took and sowed in his field which indeed is less than\r\nall seeds but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and\r\nbecometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in\r\nthe branches thereof.\"\r\n\r\nCommentators differ as to which is the mustard of the parable -\r\nthis common black mustard, or a rarer shrub-like tree (Salvadora\r\nPersica), with an equivalent Arabic name, a pungent odor, and a\r\nvery small seed. Inasmuch as the mustard which is systematically\r\nplanted for fodder by Old World farmers grows with the greatest\r\nluxuriance in Palestine, and the comparison between the size of\r\nits seed and the plant's great height was already proverbial in\r\nthe East when Jesus used it, evidence strongly favors this\r\nwayside weed. Indeed, the late Dr. Royle, who endeavored to prove\r\nthat it was the shrub that was referred to, finally found that it\r\ndoes not grow in Galilee.\r\n\r\nNow, there are two species which furnish the most powerfully\r\npungent condiment known to commerce; but the tiny dark brown\r\nseeds of the black mustard are sharper than the serpent's tooth,\r\nwhereas the pale brown seeds of the WHITE MUSTARD, often mixed\r\nwith them, are far more mild. The latter (Sinapis alba) is a\r\nsimilar, but more hairy, plant, with slightly larger yellow\r\nflowers. Its pods are constricted like a necklace between the\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nThe coarse HEDGE MUSTARD (Sisymbrium officinale), with rigid,\r\nspreading branches, and spikes of tiny pale yellow flowers,\r\nquickly followed by awl-shaped pods that are closely appressed to\r\nthe stem, abounds in waste places throughout our area. It blooms\r\nfrom May to November, like the next species.\r\n\r\nAnother common and most troublesome weed from Europe is the FIELD\r\nor CORN MUSTARD, CHARLOCK or FIELD KALE (Brassica arvensis;\r\nSinapis arvensis of Gray) found in grain fields, gardens, rich\r\nwaste lands, and rubbish heaps. The alternate leaves, which stand\r\nboldly out from the stem, are oval, coarsely saw-toothed, or the\r\nlower ones more irregular, and lobed at their bases, all rough to\r\nthe touch, and conspicuously veined. The four-parted yellow\r\nflowers, measuring half an inch or more across, have six stamens\r\n(like the other members of this cross-bearing family), containing\r\nnectar at their bases. Two of them are shorter than the other\r\nfour. Honey-bees, ever abundant, the brilliant Syrphidae flies\r\nwhich love yellow, and other small visitors after pollen and\r\nnectar, to obtain the latter insert their tongues between the\r\nstamens, and usually cross-fertilize the flowers. In stormy\r\nweather, when few insects fly, the anthers finally turn their\r\npollen-covered tips upward; then, by a curvature of the tip of\r\nthe stamens, they are brought in contact with the flower's own\r\nstigma; for it is obviously better that even self-fertilized seed\r\nshould be set than none at all. (See Ladies'-smock.) \"The birds\r\nof the air\" may not lodge in the charlock's few and feeble\r\nbranches; nevertheless they come seeking the mild seeds in the\r\nstrongly nerved, smooth pods that spread in a loose raceme.\r\nDomestic pigeons eat the seeds greedily.\r\n\r\nThe highly intelligent honey-bee, which usually confines itself\r\nto one species of plant on its flights, apparently does not know\r\nthe difference between the field mustard and the WILD RADISH, or\r\nJOINTED or WHITE CHARLOCK (Raphanus Raphanistrum); or, knowing\r\nit, does not care to make distinctions, for it may be seen\r\nvisiting these similar flowers indiscriminately. At first the\r\nblossoms of the radish are yellow, but they quickly fade to\r\nwhite, and their purplish veins become more conspicuous. Rarely\r\nthe flowers are all purplish. The entire plant is rough to the\r\ntouch; the leaves, similar to those of the garden radish, are\r\ndeeply cleft (lyrate-pinnatifid); the seed pods, which soon\r\nfollow the flowers up the spike, are nearly cylindric when fresh,\r\nbut become constricted between the seeds, as they dry, until each\r\nlittle pod looks like a section of a bead necklace.\r\n\r\nThe GARDEN RADISH of the market (R. sativus), occasionally\r\nescaped from cultivation, although credited to China, is entirely\r\nunknown in its native state. \"It has long been held in high\r\nesteem,\" wrote Peter Henderson, \"and before the Christian era a\r\nvolume was written on this plant alone. The ancient Greeks, in\r\noffering their oblations to Apollo, presented turnips in lead,\r\nbeets in silver, and radishes in vessels of beaten gold.\" Pliny\r\ndescribes a radish eaten in Rome as being so transparent one\r\nmight see through the root. It was not until the sixteenth\r\ncentury that the plant was introduced into England. Gerarde\r\nmentions cultivating four varieties for Queen Elizabeth in Lord\r\nBurleigh's garden.\r\n\r\nThe YELLOW ROCKET, HERB OF ST. BARBARA, YELLOW BITTER-CRESS,\r\nWINTER- or ROCKET-CRESS (Barbarca Barbarea; B. vulgaris of Gray)\r\nsends up spikes of little flowers like a yellow sweet alyssum as\r\nearly as April, and continues in bloom through June. Smooth pods\r\nabout one inch long quickly follow. The thickish, shining, tufted\r\nleaves, very like the familiar WATER-CRESS (Roripa Nasturtium),\r\nwere formerly even more commonly eaten as a salad. In rich but\r\ndry soil the plant flourishes from Virginia far northward,\r\nlocally in the interior of the United States and on the Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITCH-HAZEL\r\n  (Hamamelis Virginiana)  Witch-hazel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, fringy, clustered in the axils of branches.\r\nCalyx 4-parted; 4 very narrow curving petals about 34 in. long; 4\r\nshort stamens, also 4 that are scale-like; 2 styles. Stem: A\r\ntall, crooked shrub. Leaves: Broadly oval, thick, wavy-toothed,\r\nmostly fallen at flowering time. Fruit: Woody capsules maturing\r\nthe next season and remaining with flowers of the succeeding year\r\n(Hama = together with; mela = fruit).\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods or thickets near streams.\r\nFlowering Season - August-December.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and Minnesota, southward to the Gulf\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nTo find a stray. apple blossom among the fruit in autumn, or an\r\noccasional violet deceived by caressing Indian Summer into\r\nthinking another spring has come, surprises no one; but when the\r\nwitch-hazel bursts into bloom for the first time in November, as\r\nif it were April, its leafless twigs conspicuous in the gray\r\nwoods with their clusters of spidery pale yellow flowers, we\r\ncannot but wonder with Edward Rowland Sill:\r\n\r\n     \"Has time grown sleepy at his post\r\n        And let the exiled Summer back?\r\n      Or is it her regretful ghost,\r\n        Or witchcraft of the almanac?\"\r\n\r\nNot to the blue gentian but to the witch-hazel should Bryant have\r\naddressed at least the first stanza of his familiar lines (See\r\nFringed Gentian). The shrub doubtless gives the small bees and\r\nflies their last feast of the season in consideration of their\r\nservices in transferring pollen from the staminate to the fertile\r\nflowers. Very slowly through the succeeding year the seeds within\r\nthe woody capsules mature until, by the following autumn, when\r\nfresh flowers appear, they are ready to bombard the neighborhood\r\nafter the violets' method, in the hope of landing in moist\r\nyielding soil far from the parent shrub to found a new colony.\r\nJust as a watermelon seed shoots from between the thumb and\r\nforefinger pinching it, so the large, bony, shining black,\r\nwhite-tipped witch-hazel seeds are discharged through the elastic\r\nrupture of their capsule whose walls pinch them out. To be\r\nsuddenly hit in the face by such a missile brings no smile while\r\nthe sting lasts. Witch-hazel twigs ripening indoors transform a\r\npeaceful living room into a defenseless target for light\r\nartillery practice.\r\n\r\nNowhere more than in the naming of wild flowers can we trace the\r\nhomesickness of the early English colonists in America. Any plant\r\neven remotely resembling one they had known at home was given the\r\ndear familiar name. Now our witch-hazel, named for an English\r\nhazel tree of elm lineage, has similar leaves it is true, but\r\nlikeness stops there; nevertheless, all the folklore clustered\r\nabout that mystic tree has been imported here with the title. By\r\nthe help of the hazel's divining-rod the location of hidden\r\nsprings of water, precious ore, treasure, and thieves may be\r\nrevealed, according to old superstition. Cornish miners, who live\r\nin a land so plentifully stored with tin and copper lodes they\r\ncan have had little difficulty in locating seams of ore with or\r\nwithout a hazel rod, scarcely ever sink a shaft except by its\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThe literature of Europe is filled with allusions to it. Swift\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     \"They tell us something strange and odd\r\n      About a certain magic rod\r\n      That, bending down its top divines\r\n      Where'er the soil has hidden mines\r\n      Where there are none, it stands erect\r\n      Scorning to show the least respect.\"\r\n\r\nA good story is told on Linnaeus in Baring-Gould's \"Curious Myths\r\nof the Middle Ages\": \"When the great botanist was on one of his\r\nvoyages, hearing his secretary highly extol the virtues of his\r\ndivining-wand, he was willing to convince him of its\r\ninsufficiency, and for that purpose concealed a purse of one\r\nhundred ducats under a ranunculus, which grew by itself in a\r\nmeadow, and bid the secretary find it if he could. The wand\r\ndiscovered nothing, and Linnaeus's mark was soon trampled down by\r\nthe company present, so that when he went to finish the\r\nexperiment by fetching the gold himself, he was utterly at a loss\r\nwhere to find it. The man with the wand assisted him, and\r\ninformed him that it could not lie in the way they were going,\r\nbut quite the contrary so they pursued the direction of the wand,\r\nand actually dug out the gold. Linnaeus said that another such\r\nexperiment would be sufficient to make a proselyte of him.\"\r\n\r\nMany a well has been dug even in this land of liberty where our\r\nwitch-hazel indicated; but here its kindly magic is directed\r\nchiefly through the soothing extract distilled from its juices.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE-FINGER; COMMON CINQUEFOIL\r\n  (Potentilla Canadensis)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, 1/4 to 1/2 in. across, growing singly on long\r\npeduncles from the leaf axils. Five petals longer than the 5\r\nacute calyx lobes with 5 linear bracts between them; about 20\r\nstamens; pistils numerous, forming a head. Stem: Spreading over\r\nground by slender runners or ascending. Leaves: 5-fingered, the\r\ndigitate, saw-edged leaflets (rarely 3 or 4) spreading from a\r\ncommon point, petioled; some in a tuft at base.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, roadsides, hills, banks.\r\nFlowering Season - April-August.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to Georgia, and westward beyond the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nEveryone crossing dry fields in the eastern United States and\r\nCanada at least must have trod on a carpet of cinquefoil (cinque\r\n= five, feuilles = leaves), and have noticed the bright little\r\nblossoms among the pretty foliage, possibly mistaking the plant\r\nfor its cousin, the trefoliate barren strawberry (q.v.). Both\r\nhave flowers like miniature wild yellow roses. During the Middle\r\nAges, when misdirected zeal credited almost any plant with\r\nhealing virtues for every ill that flesh is heir to, the\r\ncinquefoils were considered most potent remedies, hence their\r\ngeneric name.\r\n\r\nThe SHRUBBY CINQUEFOIL, or PRAIRIE WEED (P. fructicosa), becomes\r\nfairly troublesome in certain parts of its range, which extends\r\nfrom Greenland to Alaska, and southward to New Jersey, Arizona,\r\nand California; as well as over northern Europe and Asia. It is a\r\nbushy, much branched, and leafy shrub, six inches to four feet\r\nhigh), with bright yellow, five-parted flowers an inch across,\r\nmore or less, either solitary or in cymes at the tips of the\r\nbranches. They appear from June to September. The honeybee,\r\nalighting in the center of a blossom and turning around, passes\r\nits tongue over the entire nectar-bearing ring at the base of the\r\nstamens, then proceeding to another flower to do likewise,\r\neffects cross-fertilization regularly. On a sunny day the bright\r\nblossoms attract many visitors of the lower grade out after\r\nnectar and pollen, the beetles often devouring the anthers in\r\ntheir greed. The leaves on this cinquefoil are usually compounded\r\nof one terminal and four side leaflets that are narrowly oblong,\r\nan inch or less in length, and silky hairy. Sometimes there may\r\nbe seven leaflets pinnately, not digitately, arranged. Although\r\nthe shrubby cinquefoil prefers swamps and moist, rocky places to\r\ndwell in, it wisely adapts itself, as globe-trotters should, to\r\nwhatever conditions it meets.\r\n\r\nSILVERY or HOARY CINQUEFOIL (P. argentea), found in dry soil,\r\nblooming from May to September from Canada to Delaware, Indiana,\r\nKansas, and Dakota, also in Europe and Asia, has yellow flowers\r\nonly about a quarter of an inch across, but foliage of special\r\nbeauty. From the tufted, branching, ascending stems, four to\r\ntwelve inches long, the finely cleft, five-foliate leaves are\r\nspread on foot stems that diminish in size as they ascend, not to\r\nlet the upper leaves shut off the light from the lower ones.\r\nThese leaves are smooth and green above, silvery on the under\r\nside, with fine white hairs, adapted for protection from\r\nexcessive sunlight and too rapid transpiration of precious\r\nmoisture. They entirely conceal the sensitive epidermis from\r\nwhich they grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW AVENS; FIELD AVENS\r\n  (Geum strictum)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Golden yellow, otherwise much resembling the lower\r\ngrowing white avens (q.v.).\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low ground, moist meadows, swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Arizona, far\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nAfter the marsh marigolds have withdrawn their brightness from\r\nlow-lying meadows, blossoms of yellow avens twinkle in their\r\nstead. In autumn the jointed, barbed styles, protruding from the\r\nseed clusters, steal a ride by the same successful method of\r\ntravel to new colonizing ground adopted by burdocks, goose-grass,\r\ntick-trefoils (q.v.), agrimony, and a score of other \"tramps of\r\nthe vegetable world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTALL or HAIRY AGRIMONY\r\n  (Agrimonia hirsuta; Eupatoria of Gray)  Rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, small, 5-parted, in narrow, spike-like racemes.\r\nStem: Usua11y 3 to 4 ft. tall, sometimes less or more clothed,\r\nwith long, soft hairs. Leaves: Large, thin, bright green,\r\ncompounded of (mostly) 7 principal oblong, coarsely saw-edged\r\nleaflets, with pairs of tiny leaflets between.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Woods, thickets, edges of fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina, westward to California, and far\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nQuite a different species, not found in this country, is the\r\ncommon European Agrimony - A. Eupatoria of Linnaeus - which\r\nfigures so prominently in the writings of medieval herbalists as\r\na cure-all. Slender spires of green fruit below and yellow\r\nflowers above curve and bend at the borders of woodlands here\r\napparently for no better reason than to enjoy life. Very few\r\ninsects visit them, owing to the absence of nectar - certainly\r\nnot the highly specialized and intelligent \"Humble-Bee,\" to whom\r\nEmerson addressed the lines:\r\n\r\n     \"Succory to match the sky,\r\n      Columbine with horn of honey,\r\n      Scented fern and agrimony,\r\n      Clover, catch-fly, adder's-tongue,\r\n      And brier-roses, dwelt among.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true the bumblebee may dwell among almost any flowers, but\r\nhe has decided preferences for such showy ones as have adapted\r\nthemselves to please his love of certain colors (not yellow), or\r\nhave secreted nectar so deeply hidden from the mob that his long\r\ntongue may find plenty preserved when he calls. Occasional\r\nvisitors alighting on the agrimony for pollen may distribute\r\nsome, but the little blossoms chiefly fertilize themselves. When\r\ncrushed they give forth a faint, pleasant odor. Pretty, nodding\r\nseed urns, encircled with a rim of hooks, grapple the clothing of\r\nman or beast passing their way, in the hope of dropping off in a\r\nsuitable place to found another colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSITIVE PEA; WILD or SMALL-FLOWERED SENSITIVE PLANT\r\n  (Cassia nictitans)  Senna family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, regular, 5-parted, about 1/4 in. across; 2 or 3\r\ntogether in the axils. Stem: Weak, 6 to 15 in. tall, branching,\r\nleafy. Leaves: Alternate, sensitive, compounded of 12 to 44\r\nsmall, narrowly oblong leaflets; a cup-shaped gland below lowest\r\npair; stipules persistent. Fruit: A pod, an inch long or more,\r\ncontaining numerous seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, sandy wasteland, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - New England westward to Indiana, south to Georgia\r\nand Texas.\r\n\r\nHow many of us ever pause to test the sensitiveness of this\r\nexquisite foliage that borders the roadsides, and in appearance\r\nis almost identical with the South American sensitive plant's, so\r\ncommonly cultivated in hothouses here? Failing to see its fine\r\nlittle leaflets fold together instantly when brushed with the\r\nhand, as they do in the tropical species (Mimosa pudica), many\r\npass on, concluding its title a misnomer. By simply touching the\r\nleaves, however roughly, only a tardy and slight movement\r\nfollows. A sharp blow produces quicker effect, while if the whole\r\nplant be shaken by forcibly snapping the stem with the finger,\r\nall the leaves will be strongly affected; their sensitiveness\r\nbeing apparently more aroused by vibration through jarring than\r\nby contact with foreign bodies. The leaves, which ordinarily\r\nspread out flat, partly close in bright sunshine and \"go to\r\nsleep\" at night, not to expose their sensitive upper surfaces to\r\nfierce heat in the first case, and to cold by radiation in the\r\nsecond. \"Lifeless things may be moved or acted on,\" says Asa\r\nGray; \"living beings move and act - plants less conspicuously,\r\nbut no less really than animals. In sharing the mysterious gift\r\nof life they share some of its simpler powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe PARTRIDGE PEA or LARGE-FLOWERED SENSITIVE PLANT (C.\r\nChamaecrista) likewise goes to sleep; the ten to fifteen pairs of\r\nleaflets which, with a terminal one, make up each pinnate leaf,\r\nslowly turning their outer edges uppermost after sunset, and\r\noverlapping as they flatten themselves against their common stem\r\nuntil the entire aspect of the plant is changed. By day the\r\nexpanded foliage is feathery, fine, acacia-like; at night the\r\nbushy, branching, spreading plant, that measures only a foot or\r\ntwo high, appears to produce nothing but pods. These leaves\r\nrespond slowly to vibration, just as the sensitive pea's do. In\r\nspite of their names, neither produces the butterfly-shaped\r\n(papilionaceous) blossom of true peas. The partridge pea bears\r\nfrom two to four showy flowers together, each measuring an inch\r\nor more across, on a slender pedicel from the axils. It fully\r\nexpands only four of its five bright yellow petals; they are\r\nsomewhat unequal in size, the upper ones, with touches of red at\r\nthe base, as pathfinders, not, however, as nectar-guides, since\r\nno sweets are secreted here. Curiously enough, both right and\r\nleft hand flowers are found upon the same plant; that is to say,\r\nthe sickle-shaped pistil turns either to the right or the left.\r\nOne lateral petal, instead of being flexible and spread like the\r\nrest, stands so stiffly erect and incurved that it commonly\r\nbreaks on being bent back. Why? The pistil, it will be noticed,\r\npoints away from the ten long black anthers. Obviously, then, the\r\nflower cannot fertilize itself. Its benefactors are bumblebee\r\nfemales and workers out after pollen. Cup-shaped nectaries\r\n(\"extra nuptial\") are situated on the upper side and near the\r\nbase of the leaf stalks on these cassia plants, where they can\r\nhave no direct influence on the fertilization of the blossoms.\r\nApparently, they are free lunch-counters, kept open out of pure\r\ncharity. Landing upon the long black anthers with pores in their\r\ntips to let out the pollen, the bumblebees \"seize them between\r\ntheir mandibles, says Professor Robertson, \"and stroke them\r\ndownward with a sort of milking motion. The pollen...falls either\r\ndirectly upon the bee or upon the erect lateral petal which is\r\npressed close against the bee's side. In this way the side of the\r\nbee which is next to the incurved petal receives the most\r\npollen.... A bee visiting a left-hand flower receives pollen upon\r\nthe right side, and then flying to a right-hand flower, strikes\r\nthe same side against the stigma.\" When we find circular holes in\r\nthese petals we may know the leaf-cutter or upholsterer bee\r\n(Megachile brevis) has been at work collecting roofs for her\r\nnurseries (see Hairy Ruellia). The partridge pea, which has a\r\nmore westerly range than the sensitive pea's, extends it\r\nsouthward even to Bolivia. Game birds, migrants and rovers, which\r\nfeed upon the seeds, have of course helped in their wider\r\ndistribution. The plant blooms from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD or AMERICAN SENNA\r\n  (Cassia Marylandica)  Senna family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, about 3/4 in. broad, numerous, in short\r\naxillary clusters on the upper part of plant. Calyx of 5 oblong\r\nlobes; 5 petals, 3 forming an upper lip, 2 a lower one; 10\r\nstamens of 3 different kinds; 1 pistil. Stem: 3 to 8 ft. high,\r\nlittle branched. Leaves: Alternate, pinnately compounded of 6 to\r\n10 pairs of oblong leaflets. Fruit: A narrow, flat curving pod, 3\r\nto 4 in. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Alluvial or moist, rich soil, swamps,\r\nroadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - New England, westward to Nebraska, south to the\r\nGulf States.\r\n\r\nWhoever has seen certain Long Island roadsides bordered with wild\r\nsenna, the brilliant flower clusters contrasted with the deep\r\ngreen of the beautiful foliage, knows that no effect produced by\r\nart along the drives of public park or private garden can match\r\nthese country lanes in simple charm. Bumblebees, buzzing about\r\nthe blossoms, may be observed \"milking\" the anthers just as they\r\ndo those of the partridge pea. No red spots on any of these\r\npetals guide the visitors, as in the previous species, however;\r\nfor do not the three small, dark stamens, which are reduced to\r\nmere scales, answer every purpose as pathfinders here? The\r\nstigma, turned sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left,\r\nstrikes the bee on the side; the senna being what Delpino, the\r\nItalian botanist, calls a pleurotribe flower.\r\n\r\nWhile leaves of certain African and East Indian species of senna\r\nare most valued for their medicinal properties, those of this\r\nplant are largely collected in the Middle and Southern States as\r\na substitute. Caterpillars of several sulphur butterflies, which\r\nlive exclusively on cassia foliage, appear to feel no evil\r\neffects from overdoses.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD INDIGO; YELLOW or INDIGO BROOM; HORSEFLY-WEED\r\n  (Baptisia tinctoria)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, papilionaceous, about 1/2 in. long, on\r\nshort pedicels, in numerous but few flowered terminal racemes.\r\nCalyx light green, 4 or 5-toothed; corolla of 5 oblong petals,\r\nthe standard erect, the keel enclosing 10 incurved stamens and\r\npistil. Stem: Smooth, branched, 2 to 4 ft. high. Leaves:\r\nCompounded of 3 ovate leaflets. Fruit: A many-seeded round or\r\negg-shaped pod tipped with the awl-shaped style.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, sandy soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Maine and Minnesota to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nDark grayish green, clover-like leaves, and small, bright yellow\r\nflowers growing in loose clusters at the ends of the branches of\r\na bushy little plant, are so commonly met with they need little\r\ndescription. A relative, the true indigo-bearer, a native of\r\nAsia, once commonly grown in the Southern States when slavery\r\nmade competition with Oriental labor possible, has locally\r\nescaped and become naturalized. But the false species, although,\r\nas Dr. Gray says, it yields \"a poor sort of indigo,\" yields a\r\nmost valuable medicine employed by the homeopathists in malarial\r\nfevers. The plant turns black in drying. As in the case of other\r\npapilionaceous blossoms, bees are the visitors best adapted to\r\nfertilize the flowers. When we see the little, sleepy,\r\ndusky-winged butterfly (Thanaos brizo) around the plant we may\r\nknow she is there only to lay eggs, that the larvae and\r\ncaterpillars may find their favorite food at hand on waking into\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATTLE-BOX\r\n  (Crotalaria sagittalis)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, 1/2 in. long or less, usually only 2 or 3 on a\r\nlong peduncle. Calyx 5-toothed, slightly 2-lipped; corolla\r\npapilionaceous. Stem: 3 to 10 in. high, weak, hairy. Leaves:\r\nAlternate, simple, oval to lance-shaped; stipules arrow-shaped\r\nabove and running along stem. Fruit: An inflated oblong pod 1 in,\r\nlong, blackish, seedy.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, sandy, open situations.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - New England and Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThese insignificant little yellow flowers attract scant notice\r\nfrom human observers accustomed to associate their generic name\r\nwith some particularly beautiful relatives from the West Indies\r\ngrown in hothouses here. But did not small bees alight on the\r\nkeel and depress it, as in the lupine, next of kin (q.v.) there\r\nmight be no seeds to rattle in the dark inflated pods that so\r\ndelight children. (Krotalon = a castanet.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW SWEET CLOVER; YELLOW MELILOT\r\n  (Melilotus officinalis)  Pea family\r\n\r\nResembling the white sweet clover, except in color. (q.v.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW or HOP CLOVER\r\n  (Trifotium agrarium)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, scale-like, overlapping in a densely\r\nmany-flowered oblong head about 1/2 in. long, becoming brown with\r\nage. Stem: Ascending, branched, 6 to 18 in. high. Leaves:\r\n3-foliate, very finely toothed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places, fields, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Virginia to Iowa, and far northward.\r\n\r\nWhat did the sulphur butterflies provide as food for their\r\ncaterpillar babies before the commonest clovers came over from\r\nthe Old World to possess the soil? Wherever a trifolium grows,\r\nthere one is sure to see\r\n\r\n          \"gallow-yellow butterflies,\r\n      Like blooms of lorn primroses blowing loose,\r\n        when autumn winds arise.\"\r\n\r\nThe BLACKSEED HOP CLOVER, BLACK or HOP MEDIC (Medicago lupulina),\r\nwith even smaller, bright yellow oblong heads which turn black\r\nwhen ripe, lies on the ground, its branches spreading where they\r\nleave the root. A native of Europe and Asia, it is now\r\ndistributed as a common weed throughout our area, for there is\r\nscarcely a month in the year when it does not bloom and set seed.\r\nIt is still another of the many plants known as the shamrock.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW WOOD-SORREL; LADY'S SORREL\r\n  (Oxalis stricta)  Wood-sorrel family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Golden, fragrant, in long peduncled, small, terminal\r\ngroups. Calyx of 5 sepals; corolla of 5 petals, usually reddish\r\nat base; stamens, 10; 1 pistil with 5 styles; followed by slender\r\npods. Stem: Pale, erect, 3 to 12 in. high, the sap sour. Leaves:\r\nPalmately compound, of 3 heart-shaped, clover-like leaflets on\r\nlong petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open woodlands, waste or cultivated soil,\r\nroadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - April-October.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia and Dakota westward to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nAn extremely common little weed, whose peculiarly sensitive\r\nleaves children delight to set in motion by rubbing, or to chew\r\nfor the sour juice. Concerning the night \"sleep\" of wood-sorrel\r\nleaves and the two kinds of flowers these plants bear, see the\r\nwhite and violet wood-sorrels.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD or SLENDER YELLOW FLAX\r\n  (Linum Virginianum) Flax family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, about 1/3 in. across, each from a leaf axil,\r\nscattered along the slender branches. Sepals, 5; 5 petals, 5\r\nstamens. Stem: 1 to 2 ft. high, branching, leafy. Leaves.\r\nAlternate, seated on the stem; small, oblong, or lance-shaped, 1\r\nnerved.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry woodlands and borders; shady places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - New England to Georgia.\r\n\r\nCertainly in the Atlantic States this is the commonest of its\r\nslender, dainty tribe; but in bogs and swamps farther southward\r\nand westward to Texas the RIDGED YELLOW FLAX (L. striatum), with\r\nleaves arranged opposite each other up to the branches and an\r\nangled stem so sticky it \"adheres to paper in which it is dried,\"\r\ntakes its place.\r\n\r\n     \"Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,\"\r\n\r\nwrote Longfellow, as if blue flax were a familiar sight on this\r\nside of the Atlantic. The charming little European plant (L.\r\nusitatissimum), which has furnished the fiber for linen and the\r\noily seeds for poultices from time immemorial, is only a fugitive\r\nfrom cultivation here. Unhappily, it is rarely met with along the\r\nroadsides and railways as it struggles to gain a foothold in our\r\nwaste places. Possibly Longfellow had in mind the blue toad flax\r\n(q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWEL-WEED; SPOTTED TOUCH-ME-NOT: SILVER CAP; WILD BALSAM: LADY'S\r\nEARDROPS; SNAP WEED; WILD LADY'S SLIPPER\r\n  (Impatiens biflora; I. fulva of Gray)  Jewel-weed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Orange yellow, spotted with reddish-brown, irregular, 1\r\nin. long or less, horizontal, 2 to 4 pendent by slender\r\nfootstalks on a long peduncle from leaf axils. Sepals, 3,\r\ncolored; 1 large, sac-shaped, contracted into a slender incurved\r\nspur and 2-toothed at apex; 2 other sepals small. Petals, 3; 2 of\r\nthem 2-cleft into dissimilar lobes; 5 short stamens, 1 pistil.\r\nStem: 2 to 5 ft. high, smooth, branched, colored, succulent.\r\nLeaves: Alternate, thin, pale beneath, ovate, coarsely toothed,\r\npetioled. Fruit: An oblong capsule, its 5 valves opening\r\nelastically to expel the seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Beside streams, ponds, ditches; moist ground.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Oregon, south to Missouri and\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nThese exquisite, bright flowers, hanging at a horizontal, like\r\njewels from a lady's ear, may be responsible for the plant's folk\r\nname; but whoever is abroad early on a dewy morning, or after a\r\nshower, and finds notched edges of the drooping leaves hung with\r\nscintillating gems, dancing, sparkling in the sunshine, sees\r\nstill another reason for naming this the jewel-weed. In a brook,\r\npond, spring, or wayside trough, which can never be far from its\r\nhaunts, dip a spray of the plant to transform the leaves into\r\nglistening silver. They shed water much as the nasturtium's do.\r\n\r\nWhen the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird flashes northward out of\r\nthe tropics to spend the summer, where can he hope to find nectar\r\nso deeply secreted that not even the long-tongued bumblebee may\r\nrob him of it all? Beyond the bird's bill his tongue can be run\r\nout and around curves no other creature can reach. Now the early\r\nblooming columbine, its slender cornucopias brimming with sweets,\r\nwelcomes the messenger whose needle-like bill will carry pollen\r\nfrom flower to flower; presently the coral honeysuckle and the\r\nscarlet painted-cup attract him by wearing his favorite color;\r\nnext the jewel-weed hangs horns of plenty to lure his eye; and\r\nthe trumpet vine and cardinal flower continue to feed him\r\nsuccessively in Nature's garden; albeit cannas, nasturtiums,\r\nsalvia, gladioli, and such deep, irregular showy flowers in men's\r\nflower beds sometimes lure him away. These are bird flowers\r\ndependent in the main on the ruby-throat, which is not to say\r\nthat insects never enter them, for they do; only they are not the\r\nvisitors catered to. Watch the big, velvety bumblebee approach a\r\nroomy jewel-weed blossom and nearly disappear within. The large\r\nbunch of united stamens, suspended directly over the entrance,\r\nbears copious white pollen. So much comes off on his back that\r\nafter visiting a flower or two he becomes annoyed; clings to a\r\nleaf with his fore legs while he thoroughly brushes his back and\r\nwings with his middle and hind pairs, and then collects the\r\nsticky grains into a wad on his feet which he presently kicks off\r\nwith disgust to the ground. Examine a jewel-weed blossom to see\r\nthat the clumsy bumblebee's pollen-laden back is not so likely to\r\ncome in contact with the short five-parted stigma concealed\r\nbeneath the stamens, as a hummingbird's slender bill that is\r\nthrust obliquely into the spur while he hovers above.\r\n\r\nBut, as if the plant had not sufficient confidence in its\r\nvisitors to rely exclusively on them for help in continuing the\r\nlovely species, it bears also cleistogamous blossoms that never\r\nopen - economical products without petals, which ripen abundant\r\nself-fertilized seed (see white wood sorrel). It is calculated\r\nthat each jewel-weed blossom produces about two hundred and fifty\r\npollen grains; yet each is by no means able to produce seed in\r\nspite of its prodigality. Nevertheless, enough cross-fertilized\r\nseed is set to save the species from the degeneracy that follows\r\nclose inbreeding among plants as well as animals. In England,\r\nwhere this jewel-weed is rapidly becoming naturalized, Darwin\r\nrecorded there are twenty plants producing cleistogamous flowers\r\nto one having showy blossoms which, even when produced, seldom\r\nset seed. What more likely, since hummingbirds are confined to\r\nthe New World? Therefore why should the plant waste its energy on\r\na product useless in England? It can never attain perfection\r\nthere until hummingbirds are imported, as bumblebees had to be\r\ninto Australia before the farmers could harvest seed from their\r\nclover fields (see red clover).\r\n\r\nFamiliar as we may be with the nervous little seedpods of the\r\ntouch-me-not, which children ever love to pop and see the seeds\r\nfly, as they do from balsam pods in grandmother's garden, they\r\nstill startle with the suddenness of their volley. Touch the\r\ndelicate hair-trigger at the end of a capsule, and the lightning\r\nresponse of the flying seeds makes one jump. They sometimes land\r\nfour feet away. At this rate of progress a year, and with the\r\nother odds against which all plants have to contend, how many\r\ngenerations must it take to fringe even one mill pond with\r\njewel-weed; yet this is rapid transit indeed compared with many\r\nof Nature's processes. The plant is a conspicuous sufferer from\r\nthe dodder (q.v.).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PALE TOUCH-ME-NOT (I. aurea; I. pallida of Gray) most\r\nabundant northward, a larger, stouter species found in similar\r\nsituations, but with paler yellow flowers only sparingly dotted\r\nif at all, has its broader sac-shaped sepal abruptly contracted\r\ninto a short, notched, but not incurved spur. It shares its\r\nsister's popular names.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELVET LEAF; INDIAN MALLOW; AMERICAN JUTE\r\n  (Abutilon Abulilon; A. Avicennae of Gray)  Mallow family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Deep yellow, 1/2 to 3/4 in. broad, 5-parted, regular,\r\nsolitary on stout peduncles from the leaf axils. Stem: 3 to 6 ft.\r\nhigh, velvety, branched. Leaves: Soft velvety, heart-shaped, the\r\nlobes rounded, long petioled. Fruit: In a head about 1 in.\r\nacross, 12 to 15 erect hairy carpels, with spreading sharp beaks.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Escaped from cultivation to waste sandy loam,\r\nfields, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - August-October.\r\nDistribution - Common or frequent, except at the extreme North.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, not many years ago, when this now common and\r\noften troublesome weed was imported from India and tenderly\r\ncultivated in flower gardens. In the Orient it and allied species\r\nare grown for their fiber, which is utilized for cordage and\r\ncloth; but the equally valuable plant now running wild here has\r\nyet to furnish American men with a profitable industry. Although\r\nthe blossom is next of kin to the veiny Chinese bell-flower, or\r\nstriped abutilon, so common in greenhouses, its appearance is\r\nquite different.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ANDREW'S CROSS\r\n  (Ascyrum hypericoides; A. Crux-Andreae of Gray)  St.\r\nJohn's-wort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, 1/2 to 3/4 in. across, terminal and from the\r\nleaf axils. Calyx of 4 sepals in 2 pairs; 4 narrow, oblong\r\npetals; stamens numerous; 2 styles. Stem: Much branched and\r\nspreading from base, 5 to 10 in. high, leafy. Leaves: Opposite,\r\noblong, small, seated on stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, sandy soil; pine barrens.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August.\r\nDistribution - Nantucket Island (Mass.), westward to Illinois,\r\nsouth to Florida and Texas.\r\n\r\nBecause the four pale yellow petals of this flower approach each\r\nother in pairs, suggesting a cross with equals arms, the plant\r\nwas given its name by Linnaeus in 1753. ST. PETER'S-WORT (A.\r\nstans), a similar plant, found in the same localities, in bloom\r\nat the same time, has larger flowers in small clusters at the\r\ntips only of its upright branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON ST. JOHN'S-WORT\r\n  (Hypericum perforatum)  St. John's-wort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, 1 in. across or less, several or many in\r\nterminal clusters. Calyx of 5 lance-shaped sepals; 5 petals\r\ndotted with black; numerous stamens in 3 sets 3 styles. Stem: to\r\n2 ft. high, erect, much branched. Leaves: Small, opposite,\r\noblong, more or less black-dotted.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, waste lands, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Throughout our area, except the extreme North;\r\nEurope, and Asia.\r\n\r\n\"Gathered upon a Friday, in the hour of Jupiter when he comes to\r\nhis operation, so gathered, or borne, or hung upon the neck, it\r\nmightily helps to drive away all phantastical spirits.\" These are\r\nthe blossoms which have been hung in the windows of European\r\npeasants for ages on St. John's eve, to avert the evil eye and\r\nthe spells of the spirits of darkness. \"Devil chaser\" its Italian\r\nname signifies. To cure demoniacs, to ward off destruction by\r\nlightning, to reveal the presence of witches, and to expose their\r\nnefarious practices, are some of the virtues ascribed to this\r\nplant, which superstitious farmers have spared from the scythe\r\nand encouraged to grow near their houses until it has become,\r\neven in this land of liberty, a troublesome weed at times. \"The\r\nflower gets its name,\" says F. Schuyler Mathews, \"from the\r\nsuperstition that on St. John's day, the 24th of June, the dew\r\nwhich fell on the plant the evening before was efficacious in\r\npreserving the eyes from disease. So the plant was collected,\r\ndipped in oil, and thus transformed into a balm for every wound.\"\r\nHere it is a naturalized, not a native, immigrant. A blooming\r\nplant, usually with many sterile shoots about its base, has an\r\nunkempt, untidy look; the seed capsules and the brown petals of\r\nwithered flowers remaining among the bright yellow buds through a\r\nlong season. No nectar is secreted by the St. John's-worts,\r\ntherefore only pollen collectors visit them regularly, and\r\noccasionally cross-fertilize the blossoms, which are best\r\nadapted, however, to pollinate themselves.\r\n\r\nThe SHRUBBY ST. JOHN'S-WORT (H. prolificum) bears yellow\r\nblossoms, about half an inch across, which are provided with\r\nstamens so numerous, the many flowered terminal clusters have a\r\nsoft, feathery effect. In the axils of the oblong, opposite\r\nleaves are tufts of smaller ones, the stout stems being often\r\nconcealed under a wealth of foliage. Sandy or rocky places from\r\nNew Jersey southward best suit this low, dense, diffusely\r\nbranched shrub which blooms prolifically from July to September.\r\n\r\nFarther north, and westward to Iowa, the GREAT or GIANT ST.\r\nJOHN'S-WORT (H. Ascyron) brightens the banks of streams at\r\nmidsummer with large blossoms, each on a long footstalk in a\r\nfew-flowered cluster.\r\n\r\nLONG-BRANCHED FROST-WEED; FROST-FLOWER; FROST-WORT; CANADIAN\r\nROCK-ROSE\r\n  (Helianthemum Canadense)  Rock-rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Solitary, or rarely 2; about 1 in. across, 5-parted,\r\nwith showy yellow petals; the 5 unequal sepals hairy. Also\r\nabundant small flowers lacking petals, produced from the axils\r\nlater. Stem: Erect, 3 in. to 2 ft. high; at first simple, later\r\nwith elongated branches. Leaves: Alternate, oblong, almost seated\r\non stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, sandy or rocky soil.\r\nFlowering Season - Petal-bearing flowers, May-July.\r\nDistribution - New England to the Carolinas, westward to\r\nWisconsin and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nOnly for a day, and that must be a bright sunny one, does the\r\nsolitary frost-flower expand its delicate yellow petals. On the\r\nnext, after pollen has been brought to it by insect messengers\r\nand its own carried away, the now useless petal advertisements\r\nfall, and the numerous stamens, inserted upon the receptacle with\r\nthem, also drop off, leaving the club-shaped pistil to develop\r\nwith the ovary into a rounded, ovoid, three-valved capsule.\r\nNotice how flat the stamens lie upon the petals to keep safely\r\nout of reach of the stigma. Another flower, exactly like the\r\nfirst, now expands, and the bloom continues for weeks. Why does\r\nonly one blossom open at a time? Because the whole aim of the\r\nshowy flowers is to set cross-fertilized seed, and when only one\r\nat a time appears, pollination not only between distinct blossoms\r\nbut between distinct plants insures the healthiest, most vigorous\r\noffspring - a wise precaution against degeneracy, in view of the\r\nquantities of self-fertilized seed that will be set late in\r\nsummer by the tiny apetalous flowers that never open (see white\r\nwood sorrel). Surely two kinds of blossoms should be enough for\r\nany species; but why call this the frost-flower when its bloom is\r\nended by autumn? Only the witch-hazel may be said to flower for\r\nthe first time after frost. When the stubble in the dry fields is\r\nwhite some cold November morning, comparatively few notice the\r\nice crystals, like specks of glistening quartz, at the base of\r\nthe stems of this plant. The similar HOARY FROST-WEED (H. majus),\r\nwhose showy flowers appear in clusters at the hoary stein's\r\nsummit, in June and July, also bears them. Often this ice\r\nformation assumes exquisite feathery, whimsical forms, bursting\r\nthe bark asunder where an astonishing quantity of sap gushes\r\nforth and freezes. Indeed, so much sap sometimes goes to the\r\nmaking of this crystal flower, that it would seem as if an extra\r\nreservoir in the soil must pump some up to supply it with its\r\nlarge fantastic corolla.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACH or FALSE HEATHER; POVERTY GRASS\r\n  (Hudsonia tomentosa)  Rock-rose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright yellow, small, about 1/4 in. across, numerous,\r\nclosely ascending the upper part of the heath-like branches.\r\nSepals 5, unequal; 5 petals; stamens, 9 to 18. Stem: 4 to 8 in.\r\ntall, tufted, densely branched and matted, hoary hairy, pale.\r\nLeaves: Overlapping like scales, very small.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sands of the seashore, pine barrens, beaches\r\nof rivers and lakes.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Maryland, west to Lake of the\r\nWoods.\r\n\r\nLike the showy flowers of the frost-weed, these minute ones open\r\nin the sunshine only, and then but for a single day.\r\nNevertheless, the hoary, heath-like little shrub, by growing in\r\nlarge colonies and keeping up a succession of bright bloom,\r\ntinges the sand dunes back of the beach with charming color that\r\nartists delight to paint in the foreground of their marine\r\npictures.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW VIOLETS\r\n  (Viola)  Violet family\r\n\r\nFine hairs on the erect, leafy, usually single stem of the DOWNY\r\nYELLOW VIOLET (V. pubescens), whose dark veined, bright yellow\r\npetals gleam in dry woods in April and May, easily distinguish it\r\nfrom the SMOOTH YELLOW VIOLET (V. scabriuscula), formerly\r\nconsidered a mere variety in spite of its being an earlier\r\nbloomer, a lover of moisture, and well equipped with basal leaves\r\nat flowering time, which the downy species is not. Moreover, it\r\nbears a paler blossom, more coarsely dentate leaves, often\r\ndecidedly taper-pointed, and usually several stems together.\r\n\r\nOur other common yellow species, the ROUND-LEAVED VIOLET (V.\r\nrotundifolia), lifts smaller, pale, brown-veined, and bearded\r\nblossoms above a tuffet of broad, shining leaves close to the\r\nground. The veins on the petals serve as pathfinders to the\r\nnectary for the bee, and the beard as footholds, while she probes\r\nthe inverted blossoms. Such violets as have their side petals\r\nbearded are most frequently visited by small greenish mason bees\r\n(Osmia), with collecting brushes on their abdomen that receive\r\nthe pollen as it falls. Abundant cleistogamous flowers (see blue\r\nviolets and white wood sorrel) are borne on the runners late in\r\nthe season. Bryant, whose botanical lore did not always keep step\r\nwith his Muse, wrote of the yellow violet as the first spring\r\nflower, because he found it \"by the snowbank's edges cold,\" one\r\nApril day, when the hepaticas about his home at Roslyn, Long\r\nIsland, had doubtless been in bloom a month.\r\n\r\n     \"Of all her train the hands of Spring\r\n      First plant thee in the watery mould,\"\r\n\r\nhe wrote, regardless of the fact that the round-leaved violet's\r\npreferences are for dry, wooded, or rocky hillsides. Muller\r\nbelieved that all violets were originally yellow, not white,\r\nafter they evoluted from the green stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTERN CACTUS; PRICKLY PEAR; INDIAN FIG\r\n  (Opuntia Opuntia; 0. vulgaris of Gray)  Cactus family\r\n\r\nFlowers -Yellow, sometimes reddish at center, 2 to 3 in. across,\r\nsolitary, mostly seated at the side of joints. Calyx tube not\r\nprolonged beyond ovary, its numerous lobes spreading. Petals\r\nnumerous; stamens very numerous; ovary cylindric; the style\r\nlonger than stamens, and with several stigmas. Stem: Prostrate or\r\nascending, fleshy, juicy, branching, the thick, flattened joints\r\noblong or rounded, 2 to 5 in. long. Leaves: Tiny, awl-shaped,\r\ndotting the joints, but usually falling early; tufts of yellowish\r\nbristles at their base. Plant unarmed, or with few solitary stout\r\nspines. Fruit: Pear-shaped, pulpy, red, nearly smooth, 1 in. long\r\nor over, edible.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Sandy or dry or rocky places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Massachusetts to Florida.\r\n\r\nUpwards of one hundred and fifty species of Opuntia, which elect\r\nto grow in parching sands, beneath a scorching sun, often\r\nprostrate on baking hot rocks, on glaring plains, beaches, and\r\ndeserts, from Massachusetts to Peru - for all are natives of the\r\nNew World - show so marvelous an adaptation to environment in\r\neach instance that no group of plants is more interesting to the\r\nbotanist, more decorative in form and color from an artistic\r\nstandpoint, more distinctively characteristic. Plants choosing\r\nsuch habitats as they have adopted, usually in tropical or\r\nsemi-tropical regions, had to resort to various expedients to\r\nsave loss of water through transpiration and evaporation. Now, as\r\nleaves are the natural outlets for moisture thrown off by any\r\nplant, manifestly the first thing to do was either to reduce the\r\nnumber of branches and leaves, or to modify them into sharp\r\nspines (not surface prickles like the rose's); to cultivate a low\r\nhabit of growth, not to expose unnecessary surface to sun and\r\nair; to thicken the skin until little moisture could evaporate\r\nthrough the leathery coat; and, finally, to utilize the material\r\nthus saved in developing stems so large, fleshy, and juicy that\r\nthey should become wells in a desert, with powers of sustenance\r\ngreat enough to support the plant through its fiery trials. A\r\ncommon expedient of plants in dry situations, even at the north,\r\nis to modify their leaves into spines, as the gorse and the\r\nbarberry, for example, have done. That such an armor also serves\r\nto protect them against the ravages of grazing animals is an\r\nadditional advantage, of course; but not their sole motive in\r\nwearing it. Popular to destruction would the cool juices of the\r\ncacti be in thirsty lands, if only they might be obtained without\r\npainful and often poisonous scratches. Given moist soil and\r\ngreater humidity of atmosphere to grow in, spiny plants at once\r\nshow a tendency to grow taller, to branch and become leafy. A\r\ncovering of hairs which reflect the light, thus diminishing the\r\namount that might reach the juicy interior area, has likewise\r\nbeen employed by many cacti, among other denizens of dry soil.\r\n\r\nIn this common prickly pear cactus of the Atlantic seaboard,\r\nwhere the air is laden with moisture from the ocean, few or no\r\nspines are produced; and dotted over the surface of its\r\nbranching, fleshy, flattened joints we find tiny, awl-shaped\r\nleaves, whereas foliage is entirely wanting in the densely\r\nprickly, rounded, solid, unbranched, hairy cacti of the\r\nsouthwestern deserts, and the arid plains of Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn sunshine the beautiful yellow blossom of our prickly pear\r\nexpands to welcome the bees, folding up its petals again for\r\nseveral successive nights. William Hamilton Gibson says it\r\n\"encloses its buzzing visitor in a golden bower, from which he\r\nmust emerge at the roof as dusty as a miller,\" only to enter\r\nanother blossom and leave some pollen on its numerous stigmas.\r\n\r\nBut the cochineal, not the bee, is forever associated with cacti\r\nin the popular mind. Indeed, several species are extensively\r\ngrown on plantations, known as Nopaleries, which furnish food to\r\ncountless trillions of these tiny insects. Like its relative the\r\naphis of rose bushes (see wild roses), the cochineal fastens\r\nitself to a cactus plant by its sucking tube, to live on the\r\njuices. The males are winged, and only the female, which yields\r\nthe valuable dye, sticks tight to the plant. Three crops of\r\ninsects a year are harvested on a Mexican plantation. After three\r\nmonths' sucking, the females are brushed off, dried in ovens, and\r\nsold for about two thousand dollars a ton. The annual yield of\r\nMexico amounting to many thousands of tons, it is no wonder the\r\ncactus plant, which furnishes so valuable an industry, should\r\nappear on the coat-of-arms of the Mexican republic. Some cacti\r\nare planted for hedges, the fruit of others furnishes a\r\nrefreshing drink in tropical climates, the juices are used as a\r\nwater color, and to dye candies - in short, this genus Opuntia\r\nand allied clans have great commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe WESTERN PRICKLY PEAR (0. humifusa; O. Rafnesquii of Gray) - a\r\nvariable species ranging from Minnesota to Texas, is similar to\r\nthe preceding, but bears a larger flower, and longer, more\r\nrounded, deeper green joints, beset with not numerous spines,\r\nscattered chiefly near their margins. A few deflexed spines in a\r\ncluster leave the surface where a tiny awl-shaped leaf and a tuft\r\nof reddish brown hairs are likewise usually found.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING-PRIMROSE; NIGHT WILLOW-HERB\r\n  (Onagra biennis; Qenothera biennis of Gray)  Evening-primrose\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, fragrant, opening at evening, 1 to 2 in.\r\nacross, borne in terminal leafy-bracted spikes. Calyx tube\r\nslender, elongated, gradually enlarged at throat, the 4-pointed\r\nlobes bent backward; corolla of 4 spreading petals; 8 stamens; 1\r\npistil; the stigma 4-cleft. Stem: Erect, wand-like, or branched,\r\nto 1 to 5 ft. tall, rarely higher, leafy. Leaves: Alternate,\r\nlance-shaped, mostly seated on stem, entire, or obscurely\r\ntoothed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, dry fields, thickets,\r\nfence-corners.\r\nFlowering Season - June-October.\r\nDistribution - Labrador to the Gulf of Mexico, west to the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nLike a ballroom beauty, the evening primrose has a jaded,\r\nbedraggled appearance by day when we meet it by the dusty\r\nroadside, its erect buds, fading flowers from last night's\r\nrevelry, wilted ones of previous dissipations, and hairy oblong\r\ncapsules, all crowded together among the willow-like leaves at\r\nthe top of the rank growing plant. But at sunset a bud begins to\r\nexpand its delicate petals slowly, timidly - not suddenly and\r\nwith a pop, as the evening primrose of the garden does.\r\n\r\nNow, its fragrance, that has been only faintly perceptible during\r\nthe day, becomes increasingly powerful. Why these blandishments\r\nat such an hour? Because at dusk, when sphinx moths, large and\r\nsmall, begin to fly (see Jamestown weed), the primrose's special\r\nbenefactors are abroad. All these moths, whose length of tongue\r\nhas kept pace with the development of the tubes of certain white\r\nand yellow flowers dependent on their ministrations, find such\r\nglowing like miniature moons for their special benefit, when\r\nblossoms of other hues have melted into the deepening darkness.\r\nIf such have fragrance, they prepare to shed it now. Nectar is\r\nsecreted in tubes so deep and slender that none but the moths'\r\nlong tongues can drain the last drop. An exquisite, little,\r\nrose-pink twilight flyer, his wings bordered with yellow,\r\nflutters in ecstasy above the evening primrose's freshly opened\r\nflowers, transferring in his rapid flight some of their abundant,\r\nsticky pollen that hangs like a necklace from the outstretched\r\nfilaments. By day one may occasionally find a little fellow\r\nasleep in a wilted blossom, which serves him as a tent, under\r\nwhose flaps the brightest bird eye rarely detects a dinner. After\r\na single night's dissipation the corolla wilts, hangs a while,\r\nthen drops from the maturing capsule as if severed with a sharp\r\nknife. Few flowers, sometimes only one opens on a spike on a\r\ngiven evening - a plan to increase the chances of\r\ncross-fertilization between distinct plants; but there is a very\r\nlong succession of bloom. If a flower has not been pollenized\r\nduring the night it remains open a while in the morning.\r\nBumblebees now hurry in, and an occasional hummingbird takes a\r\nsip of nectar. Toward the end of summer, when so much seed has\r\nbeen set that the flower can afford to be generous, it distinctly\r\nchanges its habit and keeps open house all day.\r\n\r\nDuring our winter walks we shall see close against the ground the\r\nrosettes of year-old evening primrose plants - exquisitely\r\nsymmetrical, complex stars from whose center the flower stalks of\r\nanother summer will arise.\r\n\r\nFloriform sunshine bursts forth from roadsides, fields, and\r\nprairies when the COMMON SUNDROPS (Kneiffia fructicosa; formerly\r\nQenothera fructicosa) - is in flower. It is first cousin to the\r\nsimilar evening primrose of taller, ranker growth. Often only one\r\nblossom on a stalk expands at a time, to increase the chances of\r\ncross-fertilization between distinct plants; but where colonies\r\ngrow it is a conspicuous acquaintance, for its large, bright\r\nyellow corollas remain open all day. Bumblebees with their long\r\ntongues, and some butterflies, drain the deeply hidden nectar;\r\nsmaller visitors get some only when it wells up high in the tube.\r\nAs the stigma surpasses the anthers, self-fertilization is\r\nimpossible unless an insect blunders by alighting elsewhere than\r\non the lower side, where the stigma is purposely turned to be\r\nrubbed against his pollen-laden ventral surface when he settles\r\non a blossom. Unable to reach the nectar, mining and leaf-cutter\r\nbees, wasps, flower flies, and beetles visit it for the abundant\r\npollen; and the common little white cabbage butterfly (Pieris\r\nprotodice) sucks here constantly. The capsules of the sundrops\r\nare somewhat club-shaped and four-winged, angled above, with four\r\nintervening ribs between. Range from Nova Scotia to Georgia, west\r\nbeyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nA similar, but smaller, diurnal species (K. pumilla), likewise\r\nfound blooming in dry soil from June to August, has a more\r\nwesterly range North and South.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD OR FIELD PARSNIP; MADNEP; TANK\r\n  (Pastinaca sativa)  Carrot family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull or greenish yellow, small, without involucre or\r\ninvolucels; borne in 7 to 15 rayed umbels, 2 to 6 in. across.\r\nStem: 2 to 5 ft. tall, stout, smooth, branching, grooved, from a\r\nlong, conic, fleshy, strong-scented root. Leaves: Compounded\r\n(pinnately), of several pairs of oval, lobed, or cut, sharply\r\ntoothed leaflets; the petioled lower leaves often 1 1/2 ft. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places, roadsides, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Common throughout nearly all parts of the United\r\nStates and Canada. Europe.\r\n\r\nMen are not the only creatures who feed upon such of the\r\numbel-bearing plants as are innocent - parsnips, celery, parsley,\r\ncarrots, caraway, and fennel, among others; and even those which\r\ncontain properties that are poisonous to highly organized men and\r\nbeasts, afford harmless food for insects. Pliny says that\r\nparsnips, which were cultivated beyond the Rhine in the days of\r\nTiberius, were brought to Rome annually to please the emperor's\r\nexacting palate; yet this same plant, which has overrun two\r\ncontinents, in its wild state (when its leaves are a paler\r\nyellowish green than under cultivation) often proves poisonous. A\r\nstrongly acrid juice in the very tough stem causes intelligent\r\ncattle to let it alone - precisely the object desired. But\r\ncaterpillars of certain swallow-tail butterflies, particularly of\r\nthe common eastern swallow-tail (Papilio asterias), may be taken\r\non it - the same greenish, black-banded, and yellow-dotted fat\r\n\"worm\" found on parsnips, fennel, and parsley in the kitchen\r\ngarden. Insects understood plant relationships ages before\r\nLinnaeus defined them. When we see this dark, velvety butterfly,\r\nmarked with yellow, hovering above the wild parsnip, we may know\r\nshe is there only to lay eggs that her larvae may eat their way\r\nto maturity on this favorite food store. After the flat, oval,\r\nshining seeds with their conspicuous oil tubes are set in the\r\nspreading umbels, the strong, vigorous plant loses nothing of its\r\ndecorative charm.\r\n\r\n>From April to June the lower-growing EARLY or GOLDEN MEADOW\r\nPARSNIP (Zizia aurea) spreads its clearer yellow umbels above\r\nmoist fields, meadows, and swamps from New Brunswick and Dakota\r\nto the Gulf of Mexico. Its leaves are twice or thrice compounded\r\nof oblong, pointed, saw-edged, but not lobed leaflets.\r\n\r\nThe HAIRY-JOINTED MEADOW PARSNIP (Thaspium barbinode), another\r\nearly bloomer, with pale-yellow flowers, most common in the\r\nMississippi basin, may always be distinguished by the little\r\ntufts of hair at the joints of the stem, the compound leaves, and\r\noften on the rays of the umbels.\r\n\r\nA yellow variety of the PURPLE MEADOW PARSNIP, which is popularly\r\nknown as GOLDEN ALEXANDERS (T. trifoliatum var. aureum), confines\r\nitself chiefly to woodlands. The leaves are compounded of three\r\nleaflets, longer and more lance-shaped in outline than those of\r\nother yellow species.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUR-LEAVED or WHORLED LOOSESTRIFE; CROSSWORT\r\n  (Lysimachia quadrifolia)  Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, streaked with dark red, 1/2 in. across or less;\r\neach on a thread-like, spreading footstem from a leaf axil.\r\nCalyx, 5 to 7 parted; corolla of 5 to 7 spreading lobes, and as\r\nmany stamens inserted on the throat; 1 pistil. Stem: Slender,\r\nerect, to 3 ft. tall, leafy. Leaves: In whorls of 4 (rarely in\r\n3's to 7's), lance-shaped or oblong, entire, black dotted.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open woodland, thickets, roadsides, moist,\r\nsandy soil.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Georgia and Illinois, north to New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nMedieval herbalists usually recorded anything that \"Plinie\r\nsaieth\" with profoundest respect; not always so, quaint old\r\nParkinson. Speaking of the common (vulgaris), wild loosestrife of\r\nEurope, a rather stout, downy species with terminal clusters of\r\ngood-sized, yellow flowers, that was once cultivated in our\r\nEastern States, and has sparingly escaped from gardens, he thus\r\nrefers to the reputation given it by the Roman naturalist: \"It is\r\nbelieved to take away strife, or debate between ye beasts, not\r\nonely those that are yoked together, but even those that are wild\r\nalso, by making them tame and quiet...if it be either put about\r\ntheir yokes or their necks,\" significantly adding, \"which how\r\ntrue, I leave to them shall try and find it soe.\" Our slender,\r\nsymmetrical, common loosestrife, with its whorls of leaves and\r\nlittle star-shaped blossoms on thread-like pedicels at regular\r\nintervals up the stem, is not even distantly related to the\r\nwonderful purple loosestrife (q.v.).\r\n\r\nAnother common, lower-growing species, the BULB-BEARING\r\nLOOSESTRIFE (L. terrestris; L. stricta of Gray) - blooming from\r\nJuly to September, lifts a terminal, elongated raceme of even\r\nsmaller, slender-pedicelled, yellow flowers streaked or dotted\r\nwith reddish; and in the axils of its abundant, opposite,\r\nlance-shaped, black-dotted leaves, long bulblets, that are in\r\nreality suppressed branches, are usually borne after the\r\nflowering season. Occasionally no flowers are produced, only\r\nthese strange bulblets. In this state Linnaeus mistook the plant\r\nfor a terrestrial mistletoe. This species shows a decided\r\npreference for swamps, moist thickets, and ditches throughout a\r\nrange which extends from Manitoba and Arkansas to the Atlantic\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nMONEYWORT, or CREEPING LOOSESTRIFE (L. Nummularia), a native of\r\nGreat Britain, which has long been a favorite vine in American\r\nhanging baskets and urns, when kept in moist soil, suspended from\r\na veranda, will produce prolific shoots two or three feet in\r\nlength, hanging down on all sides. Pairs of yellow, dark-spotted,\r\nfive-lobed flowers grow from the axils of the opposite leaves\r\nfrom June to August. One often finds it running wild in moist\r\nsoil beyond the pale of old gardens from Pennsylvania and Indiana\r\nnorthward into Canada. Slight encouragement in starting runaways\r\nwould easily induce the hardy little evergreen to be as common\r\nhere as it is in England.\r\n\r\nThe LANCE-LEAVED LOOSESTRIFE (Steironema lanceolatum), most\r\ncommon in the West and South, although it is by no means rare in\r\nthe northeastern States, produces either single blossoms or\r\nfew-flowered, spreading, axillary clusters on slender peduncles,\r\neach unspotted, yellow corolla half an inch across or over; the\r\npetal edges as if gnawed by the finest of teeth; the pointed\r\ncalyx segments showing between them. Sterile stamens in addition\r\nto the fertile ones characterize this clan. In moist soil it\r\nblooms from June to August. It is a strange fact that female bees\r\nof the genus Macropis have never been taken on plants outside the\r\nloosestrife connection. Here there appears to be the closest\r\ninterdependence between flower and insect. Even in Germany,\r\nMuller found them by far the most abundant visitors, \"diligently\r\nsweeping the flowers (L. vulgaris) and piling large masses of\r\nmoistened pollen on their hind legs.\" He inclined to believe that\r\nsuch blossoms in this group as have spots or streaks on their\r\npetals - pathfinders for insect visitors - are largely dependent\r\non them, and cannot easily fertilize themselves; whereas the\r\nunmarked blossoms, growing in such situations as are less\r\nfavorable to insect visits, are regularly self-fertile.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLY-WEED; PLEURISY-ROOT; ORANGE-ROOT; ORANGE MILKWEED\r\n  (Asclepias tuberosa)  Milkweed family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Bright reddish orange, in many-flowered, terminal\r\nclusters, each flower similar in structure to the common milkweed\r\n(q.v.). Stem: Erect, 1 to 2 ft. tall, hairy, leafy, milky juice\r\nscanty. Leaves: Usually all alternate, lance-shaped, seated on\r\nstem. Fruit: A pair of erect, hoary pods, 2 to 5 in. long, at\r\nleast containing silky plumed seeds.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry or sandy fields, hills, roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Maine and Ontario to Arizona, south to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nIntensely brilliant clusters of this the most ornamental of all\r\nnative milkweeds set dry fields ablaze with color. Above them\r\nbutterflies hover, float, alight, sip, and sail away - the great,\r\ndark, velvety, pipe-vine swallow-tail (Papilio philenor), its\r\ngreen-shaded hind wings marked with little white half moons; the\r\nyellow and brown, common, Eastern swallow-tail (P. asterias),\r\nthat we saw about the wild parsnip and other members of the\r\ncarrot family the exquisite, large, spice-bush swallow-tail,\r\nwhose bugaboo caterpillar startled us when we unrolled a leaf of\r\nits favorite food supply (see spice-bush); the small, common,\r\nwhite, cabbage butterfly (Pieris protodice); the even more common\r\nlittle sulphur butterflies, inseparable from clover fields and\r\nmud puddles; the painted lady that follows thistles around the\r\nglobe; the regal fritillary (Argynnis idalia), its black and\r\nfulvous wings marked with silver crescents, a gorgeous creature\r\ndeveloped from the black and orange caterpillar that prowls at\r\nnight among violet plants; the great spangled fritillary of\r\nsimilar habit; the bright fulvous and black pearl crescent\r\nbutterfly (Phyciodes tharos), its small wings usually seen\r\nhovering about the asters; the little grayish-brown, coral\r\nhair-streak (Thecla titus), and the bronze copper (Chrysophanus\r\nthoe), whose caterpillar feeds on sorrel (Rumex); the delicate,\r\ntailed blue butterfly (Lycaena comyntas), with a wing expansion\r\nof only an inch from tip to tip; all these visitors duplicated\r\nagain and again - these and several others that either escaped\r\nthe net before they were named, or could not be run down, were\r\nseen one bright midsummer day along a Long Island roadside\r\nbordered with butterfly weed. Most abundant of all was still\r\nanother species, the splendid monarch (Anosia plexippus), the\r\nmost familiar representative of the tribe of milkweed butterflies\r\n(see common milkweed). Swarms of this enormously prolific species\r\nare believed to migrate to the Gulf States, and beyond at the\r\napproach of cold weather, as regularly as the birds, traveling in\r\nnumbers so vast that the naked trees on which they pause to rest\r\nappear to be still decked with autumnal foliage. This milkweed\r\nbutterfly \"is a great migrant,\" says Dr. Holland, \"and within\r\nquite recent years, with Yankee instinct, has crossed the\r\nPacific, probably on merchant vessels, the chrysalids being\r\npossibly concealed in bales of hay, and has found lodgment in\r\nAustralia where it has greatly multiplied in the warmer parts of\r\nthe Island Continent, and has thence spread northward and\r\nwestward, until in its migrations it has reached Java and\r\nSumatra, and long ago took possession of the Philippines.... It\r\nhas established a more or less precarious foothold for itself in\r\nsouthern England. It is well established at the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, and in a short time we may expect to hear of it as\r\nhaving taken possession of the Continent of Africa, in which the\r\nfamily of plants upon which the caterpillars feed is well\r\nrepresented.\"\r\n\r\nSurely here is a butterfly flower if ever there was one, and such\r\nare rare. Very few are adapted to tongues so long and slender\r\nthat the bumblebee cannot help himself to their nectar; but one\r\nalmost never sees him about the butterfly-weed. While other bees,\r\na few wasps, and even the ruby-throated hummingbird, which ever\r\ndelights in flowers with a suspicion of red about them, sometimes\r\nvisit these bright clusters, it is to the ever-present butterfly\r\nthat their marvelous structure is manifestly adapted. Only\r\nvisitors long of limb can easily remove the pollinia, which are\r\nusually found dangling from the hairs of their legs. We may be\r\nsure that after generously feeding its guests, the flower does\r\nnot allow many to depart without rendering an equivalent service.\r\nThe method of compelling visitors to withdraw pollen-masses from\r\none blossom and deposit them in another - an amazing process -\r\nhas been already described under the common milkweed. Lacking the\r\nquantity of sticky milky juice which protects that plant from\r\ncrawling pilferers, the butterfly-weed suffers outrageous\r\nrobberies from black ants. The hairs on its stem, not sufficient\r\nto form a stockade against them, serve only as a screen to\r\nreflect light lest too much may penetrate to the interior juices.\r\nWe learned, in studying the prickly pear cactus, how necessary it\r\nis for plants living in dry soil to guard against the escape of\r\ntheir precious moisture.\r\n\r\nTransplanted from Nature's garden into our own, into what Thoreau\r\ntermed \"that meager assemblage of curiosities, that poor apology\r\nfor Nature and Art which I call my front yard,\" clumps of\r\nbutterfly-weed give the place real splendor and interest. It is\r\nsaid the Indians used the tuberous root of this plant for various\r\nmaladies, although they could scarcely have known that because of\r\nthe alleged healing properties of the genus Linnaeus dedicated it\r\nto Aesculapius, of whose name Asclepias is a Latinized\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-BALM; CITRONELLA; RICH-WEED; STONE-ROOT; HORSE-WEED\r\n  (Collinsonia Canadensis)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light yellowish, lemon-scented, about 1/2 in. long,\r\nmostly opposite, in numerous spreading racemes, forming long,\r\nloose terminal clusters. Calyx bell-shaped, 2-lipped, upper lip\r\n3-toothed, lower lip 2-cleft; corolla 5-lobed, 4 lobes nearly\r\nequal, the fifth much larger, fringed; stamens protruding, 2\r\nanther-bearing; 1 long style, the stigma forked.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - New England, Ontario, and Wisconsin, south to\r\nFlorida and Kansas.\r\n\r\nNow that we have come to read the faces of flowers much as their\r\ninsect friends must have done for countless ages, we suspect at a\r\nglance that the strong-scented horse-balm, with its profusion of\r\nlemon-colored, irregular little blossoms, is up to some ingenious\r\ntrick. The lower lip, out of all proportion to the rest of the\r\ncorolla, flaunting its enticing fringes; the long stamens\r\nprotruding from some flowers, and only the long style from others\r\non the same plant, excite our curiosity. Where many fragrant\r\nclumps grow in cool, shady woods at midsummer, is an excellent\r\nplace to rest a while and satisfy it. Presently a bumblebee,\r\nattracted by the odor from afar, alights on the fringed platform\r\ntoo weak to hold him. Dropping downward, he snatches the\r\nfilaments of the two long stamens to save himself; and, as he\r\ndoes so, pollen jarred out of their anther sacs falls on his\r\nthorax at the juncture of his wings. Hanging beneath the flower a\r\nsecond, he sips its nectar and is off. Many bees, large and\r\nsmall, go through a similar performance. Now the young, newly\r\nopened flowers have the forked stigmas of the long style only\r\nprotruding at this stage, the miniature stamens being still\r\ncurled within the tube. Obviously a pollen-dusted bee coming to\r\none of these young flowers must rub off some of the vitalizing\r\ndust on the sticky fork that purposely impedes his entrance at\r\nthe precise spot necessary. Notice that after a flower's stamens\r\nprotrude in the second stage of its development the fork is\r\nturned far to one side to get out of harm's way -\r\nself-fertilization being an abomination. It was the lamented\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson who first called attention to the\r\nhorse-balm's ingenious scheme to prevent it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA GROUND CHERRY\r\n  (Physalis Virginiana; P. Pennsylvanica of Gray)  Potato family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Sulphur or greenish yellow, with 5 dark purplish dots,\r\n1 in. across or less, solitary from the leaf axils. Calyx\r\n5-toothed, much inflated in fruit; corolla open bell-shaped, the\r\nedge 5-cleft; 5 stamens, the anthers yellow, style slender,\r\n2-cleft. Stem: l 1/2 to 3 ft. tall, erect, more or less hairy or\r\nglandular, branched, from a thick rootstock. Leaves: Ovate to\r\nlanceolate, tapering at both ends or wedge-shaped, often\r\nyellowish green, entire or sparingly wavy-toothed. Fruit: An\r\ninflated, 5-angled capsule, sunken at the base, loosely\r\nsurrounding the edible reddish berry.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open ground; rich, dry pastures; hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September\r\nDistribution - New York to Manitoba, south to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nA common plant, so variable, however, that the earlier botanists\r\nthought it must be several distinct species, lanceolata among\r\nothers. A glance within shows that the open flower is not so\r\ngenerous as its spreading form would seem to indicate, for tufts\r\nof dense hairs at each side of grooves where nectar is secreted,\r\nconceal it from the mob, and, with the thickened filaments,\r\nalmost close the throat. Doubtless these hairs also serve as\r\nfootholds for the welcome bee clinging to its pendent host. The\r\ndark spots are pathfinders. One anther maturing after another, a\r\nvisitor must make several trips to secure all the pollen, and if\r\nshe is already dusted from another blossom, nine chances out of\r\nten she will first leave some of the vitalizing dust on the\r\nstigma poked forward to receive it before collecting more.\r\nProfessor Robertson says that all the ground cherries near his\r\nhome in Illinois are remarkable for their close mutual relation\r\nwith two bees of the genus Colletes. So far as is known, the\r\ninsignificant little greenish or purplish bell-shaped flowers of\r\nthe Alum-root (Heuchera Americana), with protruding orange\r\nanthers, are the only other ones to furnish these females with\r\npollen for their babies' bread. Slender racemes of this species\r\nare found blooming in dry or rocky woods from the Mississippi\r\neastward, from May to July, by which time the ground cherry is\r\nready to provide for the bee's wants. The similar Philadelphia\r\nspecies was formerly cultivated for its \"strawberry tomato.\" Many\r\nbirds which feast on all this highly attractive fruit disperse\r\nthe numerous kidney-shaped seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT MULLEIN; VELVET or FLANNEL PLANT; MULLEIN DOCK; AARON'S ROD\r\n  (Verbascum Thapsus)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, 1 in. across or less, seated around a thick,\r\ndense, elongated spike. Calyx 5-parted; corolla of 5 rounded\r\nlobes; 5 anther-bearing stamens, the 3 upper ones short, woolly;\r\n1 pistil. Stem: Stout, 2 to 7 ft. tall, densely woolly, with\r\nbranched hairs. Leaves: Thick, pale green, velvety-hairy, oblong,\r\nin a rosette on the ground; others alternate, strongly clasping\r\nthe stem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, banks, stony waste land.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Minnesota and Kansas, eastward to Nova Scotia and\r\nFlorida. Europe.\r\n\r\nLeaving the fluffy thistle-down he has been kindly scattering to\r\nthe four winds, the goldfinch spreads his wings for a brief\r\nundulating flight, singing in waves also as he goes to where\r\ntall, thick-set mullein stalks stand like sentinels above the\r\nstony pasture. Here companies of the exquisite little black and\r\nyellow minstrels delight to congregate with their somber families\r\nand feast on the seeds that rapidly follow the erratic flowers up\r\nthe gradually lengthening spikes.\r\n\r\nDelpino long ago pointed out that the blossom is best adapted to\r\npollen-collecting bees, which, alighting on the two long,\r\nprotruding stamens, rub off pollen on their undersides while\r\nclinging for support to the wool on the three shorter stamens,\r\nwhose anthers supply their needs. As a bee settles on another\r\nflower, the stigma is calculated to touch the pollen on his under\r\nside before he gets dusted with more; thus cross-pollination is\r\neffected. Three stamens furnish a visitor with food, two others\r\nclap pollen on him. Numerous flies assist in removing the pollen,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"I have come three thousand miles to see the mullein cultivated\r\nin a garden, and christened the velvet plant,\" says John\r\nBurroughs in \"An October Abroad.\" But even in England it grows\r\nwild, and much more abundantly in Southern Europe, while its\r\nspecific name is said to have been given it because it was so\r\ncommon in the neighborhood of Thapsus; but whether the place of\r\nthat name in Africa, or the Sicilian town mentioned by Ovid and\r\nVirgil, is not certain. Strange that Europeans should labor under\r\nthe erroneous impression that this mullein is native to America,\r\nwhereas here it is only an immigrant from their own land. Rapidly\r\ntaking its course of empire westward from our seaports into which\r\nthe seeds smuggled their passage among the ballast, it is now\r\nmore common in the Eastern States, perhaps, than any native.\r\nForty or more folk-names have been applied to it, mostly in\r\nallusion to its alleged curative powers, its use for candlewick\r\nand funeral torches in the Middle Ages. The generic title, first\r\nused by Pliny, is thought to be a corruption of Barbascum = with\r\nbeards, in allusion to the hairy filaments, or, as some think, to\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\nOf what use is this felt-like covering to the plant? The\r\nimportance of protecting the delicate, sensitive, active cells\r\nfrom intense light, draught, or cold, have led various plants to\r\nvarious practices; none more common, however, than to develop\r\nhairs on the epidermis of their leaves, sometimes only enough to\r\ngive it a downy appearance, sometimes to coat it with felt, as in\r\nthis case, where the hairs branch and interlace. Fierce sunlight\r\nin the exposed, dry situations where the mullein grows; prolonged\r\ndrought, which often occurs at flowering season, when the\r\nperpetuation of the species is at stake; and the intense cold\r\nwhich the exquisite rosettes formed by year-old plants must\r\nendure through a winter before they can send up a flower-stalk\r\nthe second spring - these trials the well-screened, juicy, warm\r\nplant has successfully surmounted through its coat of felt.\r\nHummingbirds have been detected gathering the hairs to line their\r\ntiny nests. The light, strong stalk makes almost as good a cane\r\nas bamboo, especially when the root end, in running under a\r\nstone, forms a crooked handle. Pale country beauties rub their\r\ncheeks with the velvety leaves to make them rosy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTH MULLEIN\r\n  (Verbascum Blattaria)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, or frequently white, 5-parted, about 1 in.\r\nbroad, marked with brown; borne on spreading pedicles in a long,\r\nloose raceme; all the filaments with violet hairs; 1 protruding\r\npistil. Stem: Erect, slender, simple, about 2 ft. high, sometimes\r\nless, or much taller. Leaves: Seldom present at flowering time;\r\noblong to ovate, toothed, mostly sessile, smooth.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, open wasteland; roadsides, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - Naturalized from Europe and Asia, more or less\r\ncommon throughout the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nQuite different from its heavy and sluggish looking sister is\r\nthis sprightly, slender, fragile-flowered mullein. \"Said to repel\r\nthe cockroach (Blatta). hence the name Blattaria; frequented by\r\nmoths, hence moth mullein.\" (Britton and Brown's \"Flora.\") Are\r\nthe latter frequent visitors? Surely there is nothing here to a\r\nmoth's liking. New England women used to pack this plant among\r\nwoolen garments in summer to keep out the tiny clothes moths. The\r\nflower, whose two long stamens and pistil protrude as from the\r\ngreat mullein's blossom, and whose filaments are tufted with\r\nviolet wool footholds - unnecessary provisions for moths, which\r\nrarely alight on any flower, but suck with their wings in motion\r\n- are cross-fertilized by pollen-collecting bees and flies as\r\ndescribed in the account of the great mullein.\r\n\r\n\"Of beautiful weeds quite a long list might be made without\r\nincluding any of the so-called wild flowers,\" says John\r\nBurroughs. \"A favorite of mine is the little moth mullein that\r\nblooms along the highway, and about the fields, and maybe upon\r\nthe edge of the lawn.\" Even in winter, when the slender stem, set\r\nwith round brown seed-vessels, rises above the snow, the plant is\r\npleasing to the human eye, as it is to that of hungry birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER-AND-EGGS; YELLOW TOAD-FLAX; EGGS-AND-BACON; FLAXWEED;\r\nBRIDEWEED\r\n  (Linaria Linaria; L. vulgaris of Gray) Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Light canary yellow and orange, 1 in. long or over,\r\nirregular, borne in terminal, leafy-bracted spikes. Corolla\r\nspurred at the base, 2-lipped, the upper lip erect, 2-lobed; the\r\nlower lip spreading, 3-lobed, its base an orange-colored palate\r\nclosing the throat; 4 stamens in pairs within; 1 pistil. Stem: 1\r\nto 3 ft. tall, slender, leafy. Leaves: Pale, grass-like.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wasteland, roadsides, banks, fields.\r\nFlowering Season - June-October.\r\nDistribution - Nebraska and Manitoba, eastward to Virginia and\r\nNova Scotia. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nAn immigrant from Europe, this plebeian perennial, meekly content\r\nwith waste places, is rapidly inheriting the earth. Its beautiful\r\nspikes of butter-colored cornucopias, apparently holding the yolk\r\nof a diminutive Spanish egg, emit a cheesy odor, suggesting a\r\nclose dairy. Perhaps half the charm of the plant consists in the\r\npale bluish-green grass-like leaves with a bloom on the surface,\r\nwhich are put forth so abundantly from the sterile shoots. (See\r\nblue toad-flax.)\r\n\r\nGuided by the orange palate pathfinder to where the curious,\r\npuzzling flower opens, the big velvety bumblebee alights, his\r\nweight depressing the lower lip until a comfortable entrance\r\nthrough the gaping mouth is offered him. In he goes, and his long\r\ntongue readily reaches the nectar in the deep spur, while his\r\nback brushes off pollen from the stamens in his way overhead.\r\nThen he backs out, and the gaping mouth springs shut after him -\r\nfor the linaria is akin to the snapdragon in the garden. As its\r\nstamens are of two lengths, the flower is able to fertilize\r\nitself in stormy weather, insects failing to transfer its pollen.\r\nTo drain ten of these spurs a minute is no difficult task for the\r\nbumblebee. But how slowly, painfully, the little lightweight\r\nhive-bees and leaf-cutters squeeze in between the tight lips. An\r\noccasional butterfly inserts its long, thin tongue, and, without\r\ntransferring a grain of pollen for the flower, robs it of sweets\r\nclearly intended for the bumblebee alone. Even when ants - the\r\nworst pilferers extant - succeed in entering, they cannot reach\r\nthe nectar, owing to the hairy stockade bordering the groove\r\nwhere it runs. Beetles, out for pollen, also occasionally steal\r\nan entrance, if nothing more. Grazing cattle let the plant alone\r\nto ripen seed in peace, for it secretes disagreeable juices in\r\nits cells - juices that were once mixed with milk by farmers'\r\nwives to poison flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNY FALSE FOXGLOVE\r\n(Dasystoma flava; Gerardia flava of Gray)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Pale yellow, 1 1/2 to 2 in. long; in showy, terminal,\r\nleafy-bracted racemes. Calyx bell-shaped, 5-toothed; corolla\r\nfunnel form, the 5 lobes spreading, smooth outside, woolly\r\nwithin; 4 stamens in pairs, woolly; 1 pistil. Stem: Grayish,\r\ndowny, erect, usually simple, 2 to 4 ft. tall. Leaves: Opposite,\r\nlower ones oblong in outline, more or less irregularly lobed and\r\ntoothed; upper ones small, entire.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Gravelly or sandy soil, dry thickets, open\r\nwoods.\r\nFlowering Season - July-August\r\nDistribution - \"Eastern Massachusetts to Ontario and Wisconsin,\r\nsouth to southern New York, Georgia, and Mississippi.\" (Britton\r\nand Brown.)\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom, as in the spiritual, all degrees of\r\nbacksliding sinners may be found, each branded with a mark of\r\ninfamy according to its deserts. We have seen how the dodder vine\r\nlost both leaf and roots after it consented to live wholly by\r\ntheft of its hardworking host's juices through suckers that\r\npenetrate to the vitals; how the Indian pipe's blanched face\r\ntells the story of guilt perpetrated under cover of darkness, in\r\nthe soil below; how the broom-rape and beech-drops lost their\r\nhonest green color; and, finally, the foxgloves show us plants\r\nwith their faces so newly turned toward the path of perdition,\r\ntheir larceny so petty, that only the expert in criminal botany\r\ncases condemns them. Like its cousins the gerardias (q.v.), the\r\ndowny false foxglove is only a partial parasite, attaching its\r\nroots by disks or suckers to the roots of white oak or witch\r\nhazel (q.v.); not only that, but, quite as frequently, groping\r\nblindly in the dark, it fastens suckers on its own roots,\r\nactually thieving from itself! It is this piratical tendency\r\nwhich makes transplanting of foxgloves into our gardens so very\r\ndifficult; even when lifted with plenty of their beloved\r\nvegetable mould. The term false foxglove, it should be explained,\r\nis by no means one of reproach for dishonesty; it was applied\r\nsimply to distinguish this group of plants from the true\r\nfoxgloves cultivated, not wild, here, which yield digitalis to\r\nthe doctors.\r\n\r\nBut if these foxgloves live at others' expense, there are\r\ncreatures which in turn prey upon them. Caterpillars of a peacock\r\nbutterfly, known as the buckeye (Junonia coenia), with eye-like\r\nspots on its tawny, reddish-gray wings, divide their unwelcome\r\nattentions between various species of plantain, the snapdragon in\r\nthe garden, gerardias, and foxgloves.\r\n\r\nThe SMOOTH FALSE FOXGLOVE (D. Virginica; G. quercifolia of Gray)\r\n- which delights in rich woods, moist or dry, bears similar, but\r\nslightly larger, blossoms on a smooth, usually branched, and\r\ntaller stem, whose lower leaves especially are much cleft\r\n(pinnatifid). This species is commoner South and West, blooming\r\nfrom July to September. All the foxgloves elevate their sticky\r\nstigmas to the mouth of their tubes, that the pollen-dusted\r\nbumblebee may leave some of the vitalizing dust brought from\r\nanother flower on its surface before she turns upside down and\r\nenters in this unusual fashion to receive a fresh supply on her\r\nway to the nectar in the base of the tube. Her pressure against\r\nthe pointed anther-tips causes the light, dry pollen to sift out;\r\non the removal of her pressure the gaping chinks close to save it\r\nfrom small bees and flies. It falls out, therefore, only when the\r\nbee is in the right position to receive it for export to another\r\nfoxglove's stigma. Hairy footholds on anthers and filaments are\r\nprovided lest the bee fall while reversed and sifting out the\r\npollen.\r\n\r\nThe FERN-LEAVED or LOUSEWORT FALSE FOXGLOVE (D. pedicularia; G.\r\npedicularia of Gray) - a very leafy species found in dry woods\r\nand thickets from the Mississippi and Ontario eastward to the\r\nAtlantic, north and south, has all its leaves once or twice\r\npinnatifid, the lobes much cut and toothed. It is a rather\r\nsticky, hairy, slender, and much branched plant, growing from one\r\nto four feet tall; the broad, trumpet-shaped, yellow flower,\r\nwhich is sticky outside, measures an inch or an inch and a half\r\nlong, and is sometimes almost as wide across. \"The most abundant\r\nvisitor, and the one for which the flower is most perfectly\r\nadapted,\" says Professor Robertson, \"is Bombus Americanorum. This\r\nbee always turns head downwards on entering the flower. When it\r\nenters, or backs out, the basal joints of its legs strike the\r\ntips of the anther-cells, when the pollen falls out. I had often\r\nwondered why this bee turned upside down to enter the flower....\r\nI discovered that the form of the flower requires it. The\r\nmodification which requires the bees to reverse is associated\r\nwith the peculiar mode of pollen discharge. Smaller bumblebees\r\nand some other bees which never or rarely try to suck hang under\r\nthe anthers and work out the pollen by striking the trigger-like\r\nawns. They reverse of their own accord, since they are so small\r\nthey are not compelled to do so on account of the form of the\r\nflower. The tube is large...so that most bumblebee workers could\r\neasily reach the nectar if the tube were not curved in the\r\nopposite direction from that of most flowers, and if the anthers\r\ndid not obstruct the entrance.\" Sometimes small bees, despairing\r\nof getting into the tube through the mouth, suck at holes in the\r\nflower's sides, because legitimate feasting was made too\r\ndifficult for the poor little things. The ruby-throated\r\nhummingbird, hovering a second above the tube, drains it with\r\nnone of the clown-like performances exacted from the bumblebee.\r\nPilfering ants find death as speedy on the sticky surfaces here\r\nas on any catchfly.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATER BLADDERWORT; HOODED WATER-MILFOIL; POP-WEED\r\n  (Utricularia vulgaris)  Bladderwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, about 1/2 in. across, 3 to 20 on short pedicels\r\nin a raceme at the top of a stout, naked scape 3 to 14 in. high.\r\nCalyx deeply 2-lobed; corolla 2-lipped, the upper lip erect, the\r\nlower lip larger, its palate prominent, the lip slightly 3-lobed,\r\nand spurred at the base; 2 stamens; 1 pistil; the stigma\r\n2-lipped. Leaves: Very finely divided into threadlike segments,\r\nbearing little air bladders.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Floating free in ponds and slow streams, or\r\nrooting in mud.\r\nFlowering Season - June-August.\r\nDistribution - Throughout nearly the whole of North America,\r\nCuba, and Mexico. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nHere is an extraordinary little plant indeed, which, by its\r\namazing cleverness, now overruns the globe - one of the higher\r\norder of intelligence so closely akin to the animals that the\r\ngulf which separates such from them seems not very wide after\r\nall. In studying the water-crowfoots (q.v.) and other aquatic\r\nplants, we learned why submerged leaves must be so finely cut;\r\nbut what mean the little bladders tipped with bristles among the\r\npop-weed's threadlike foliage? Formerly these were regarded as\r\nmere floats - a thoughtless theory, for branches without bladders\r\nmight have been observed floating perfectly. It is now known they\r\nare traps for capturing tiny aquatic creatures: nearly every\r\nbladder you examine under a microscope contains either minute\r\ncrustaceans or larvae, worms, or lower organisms, some perhaps\r\nstill alive, but most of them more or less advanced toward\r\nputrefaction - a stage hastened, it is thought, by a secretion\r\nwithin the bladders; for the plant cannot digest fresh food; it\r\ncan only absorb, through certain processes within the bladder's\r\nwalls, the fluid products of decay. The little insectivorous\r\nsundew (q.v.), on the contrary, not only digests, but afterward\r\nabsorbs, animal matter. Tiny aquatic creatures, ever seeking\r\nshelter from larger ones ready to devour them, enter the pop-weed\r\nbladders by bending inward the free edge of the valve, which,\r\nbeing strongly elastic, snaps shut again behind them instantly.\r\n\"Abandon hope, all ye who enter here,\" might be written above the\r\nentrance. No victim ever escapes from that prison. Scientists are\r\nnot agreed that the bristles draw creatures into the bladder.\r\nWhatever touches the sensitive valves is at once drawn in. \"To\r\nshow how closely the edge fits,\" says Charles Darwin, \"I may\r\nmention that my son found a daphnia which had inserted one of its\r\nantennae into the slit, and it was thus held fast during a whole\r\nday. On three or four occasions I have seen long narrow larvae,\r\nboth dead and alive, wedged between the corner of the valve and\r\ncollar, with half their bodies within the bladder and half out.\r\nProfessor Cohn of Germany tells of immersing a plant of this\r\nbladderwort one evening in clear water swarming with tiny\r\ncrustaceans, and by the next morning most of the bladders\r\ncontained them, entrapped and swimming around in their prisons.\r\n\r\nSo much for what is going on below the surface of the water: what\r\nabove it? Several flowers on the showy spike attract numerous\r\ninsects. One alighting on the lower lip must thrust his tongue\r\nbeneath the upper one to reach the nectar in the spur, passing on\r\nits way the irritable stigma, which receives any pollen he has\r\nbrought in. Instantly it is touched, the stigma folds up to be\r\nout of the way of the tongue when it is withdrawn from the spur\r\nnow laden with fresh pollen. It is thus that self-fertilization\r\nis escaped. Many vigorous seeds follow in each capsule. This\r\nmarvelous piece of mechanism is what Thoreau termed \"a\r\ndirty-conditioned flower, like a sluttish woman with a gaudy\r\nyellow bonnet\"!\r\n\r\nNot through its seeds alone, however, has the little plant\r\nsucceeded in firmly establishing itself. In early autumn the\r\nstems terminate in large buds which, falling off, lie dormant all\r\nwinter at the bottom of the pond. In spring they root and put\r\nforth leaves bearing bladders, which at this stage of existence\r\nare filled with water to help anchor the plant. As flowering\r\nseason approaches, the bladders undergo an internal change to fit\r\nthem for a change of function; they now fill with air, when the\r\nbuoyed plant rises toward the surface to send up its flowering\r\nscape, while the bladders proceed with their nefarious practices\r\nto nourish it more abundantly while its system is heavily taxed.\r\n\r\nThe HORNED BLADDERWORT (U. cornuta), found in sandy swamps, along\r\nthe borders of ponds, marshy lake margins, and in bogs from\r\nNewfoundland to Florida, westward to Minnesota and Texas, bears\r\nfrom one to six deliciously fragrant yellow flowers on its\r\nleafless scape from June to August. It is \"perhaps the most\r\nfragrant flower we have,\" says John Burroughs. \"In a warm moist\r\natmosphere its odor is almost too strong.... Its perfume is sweet\r\nand spicy in an eminent degree.\" The low scape, rooting in the\r\nmud, has some root-like stems and branches, sometimes with a few\r\nentire leaves and bladders. Its benefactors, bumblebees and\r\nbutterflies, with their highly developed aesthetic taste, are\r\nattracted from afar by this pleasing flower, whose acute, curved\r\nspur filled with nectar may not be drained by small fry, to whom\r\nthe hairy throat is an additional discouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET WILD HONEYSUCKLE, or WOODBINE; ITALIAN OR PERFOLIATE\r\nHONEYSUCKLE\r\n  (Lonicera Caprifoliuin; L. grata of Gray)  Honeysuckle family\r\n\r\nFlowers - White within, the tube pinkish, soon fading yellow, 1\r\nto 1 1/2 in. long, very fragrant; borne in terminal whorls seated\r\nin the united pair of upper leaves. Calyx small, 5-toothed;\r\ncorolla slender, tubular, 2-lipped; upper lip 4-lobed; lower lip\r\nnarrow, curved downward; 5 stamens and 1 style far protruding.\r\nStem: Climbing high, smooth. Leaves: Upper pairs united around\r\nthe stem into an oval disk or shallow cup; lower leaves opposite,\r\nbut not united oval, entire. Fruit: Red berries, clustered.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Thickets, wayside hedges, rocky woodlands.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - New England and Michigan to the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"Escaped from cultivation and naturalized.\" How does it happen\r\nthat this vine, a native of Europe, is now so common in the\r\nEastern United States as to be called the American woodbine? Had\r\nColumbus been a botanist and wandered about our continent in\r\nsearch of flowers, he would have found very few that were\r\nfamiliar to him at home, except such as were common both to\r\nEurope and Asia also. Where the Aleutian Islands jut far out into\r\nthe Pacific, and the strongest of ocean currents flows our way,\r\nmust once have been a substantial highroad for beasts, birds, and\r\nvegetables, if not for men as well; but in the wide, briny\r\nAtlantic no European seed could live long enough to germinate\r\nafter drifting across to our shores, if, indeed, it ever reached\r\nhere. Once the American colonies came to be peopled, with\r\nhomesick Europeans, who sent home for everything portable they\r\nhad loved there, enormous numbers of trees, shrubs, plants, and\r\nseeds were respectably carried across in ships; the seeds of\r\nothers stole a passage, as they do this day, among the hay used\r\nin packing. This was the chance for expansion they had been\r\nwaiting for for ages. While many cultivated species found it\r\npractically impossible to escape from the vigilance of gardeners\r\nhere, others, with a better plan for disseminating seed, quickly\r\nran wild. Now some of the commonest plants we have are of\r\nEuropean origin. This honeysuckle, by bearing red berries to\r\nattract migrating birds in autumn, soon escaped the confines of\r\ngardens. Its undigested seeds, dropped in the woodland far from\r\nthe parent vine, germinated quite as readily as in Europe, and\r\npursued in peace their natural mode of existence, until here too\r\nwe now have banks\r\n\r\n     \"Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine.\"\r\n\r\nThe HAIRY HONEYSUCKLE, or ROUGH WOODBINE (L. hirsuta), with a\r\nmore northerly and westerly range, bears clusters of flowers that\r\nare yellow on the outside, and orange within the tube, the\r\nterminal clusters slightly elevated above a united pair of dull\r\ngreen leaves that are softly hairy underneath. The slender flower\r\ntube is sticky outside to protect it from pilfering ants, and the\r\nhairs at the base of the stamens serve to hide the nectar from\r\nunbidden guests. Berries, bright orange. Flowering season,\r\nJune-July.\r\n\r\nThe deliciously fragrant CHINESE or JAPANESE HONEYSUCKLE (L.\r\nJaponica), as commonly grown on garden trellises and fences here\r\nas the morning-glory, has freely escaped from cultivation from\r\nNew York southward to West Virginia and North Carolina. Everyone\r\nmust be familiar with the pairs of slender, tubular, two-lipped,\r\nwhite or pinkish flowers, quickly turning yellow, which are borne\r\nin the leaf axils along the sprays. The smooth, dark green,\r\nopposite leaves, pale beneath, cling almost the entire year\r\nthrough. The stem, in winding, follows the course taken by the\r\nhands of a clock. Were the berries red instead of black, they\r\nwould, doubtless, have attracted more birds to disperse their\r\nseeds, and the vine would have traveled as fast in its wild state\r\nas the Italian honeysuckle has done. It blooms from June to\r\nAugust, and sparingly again in autumn.\r\nWhen daylight begins to fade, these long, slender-tubed buds\r\nexpand to welcome their chosen benefactors, the sphinx moths,\r\nwooing them with fragrance so especially strong and sweet at this\r\ntime that, long after dark, guests may be guided from afar by it\r\nalone, and entertaining them with copious draughts of deeply\r\nhidden nectar, which their long tongues alone may drain. Poised\r\nabove the blossoms, they sip without pause of their whirring\r\nwings, and it is not strange that many people mistake them in the\r\nhalf light for hummingbirds. Indeed, they are often called\r\nhummingbird moths. Darting away suddenly and swift as thought,\r\nthey have also earned the name of hawk moths. Because the\r\ncaterpillars have a curious trick of raising the fore part of\r\ntheir bodies and remaining motionless so long (like an Egyptian\r\nsphinx), the commoner name seems most appropriate. A sphinx moth\r\nat rest curls up its exceedingly long tongue like .a watch-\r\nspring: in action only the hummingbird can penetrate to such\r\ndepths; hence that honeysuckle which prefers to woo the tiny\r\nbird, whose decided preference is for red, is the TRUMPET or\r\nCORAL HONEYSUCKLE; whereas the other twiners developed deep,\r\ntubular flowers that are white or yellow, so that the moths may\r\nsee them in the dark, when red blossoms are engulfed in the\r\nprevailing blackness. Moreover, the latter bloom at a season when\r\nthe crepuscular and nocturnal moths are most abundant. Rough\r\nrounded pollen grains, carried on the hairs and scales on the\r\nunder side of the moth's body from his head to his abdomen,\r\nincluding antennae, tongue, legs, and wings, cannot but be rubbed\r\noff on the protruding sticky stigma of the next honeysuckle tube\r\nentered; hence cross-fertilization is regularly effected by moths\r\nalone. The next day such interlopers as bees, flies, butterflies,\r\nand even the outwitted hummingbird, may take whatever nectar or\r\npollen remains. If the previous evening has been calm and fine,\r\nthey will find little or none; but if the night has been wild and\r\nstormy, keeping the moths under cover, the tubes will brim with\r\nsweets. After fertilization the corolla turns yellow to let\r\nvisitors know the mutual benefit association has gone out of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSH HONEYSUCKLE; GRAVEL-WEED\r\n  (Diervilla Diervilla; D. trifida of Gray)  Honeysuckle family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Yellow, small, fragrant, 1 to 5 (usually 3) together on\r\na peduncle from upper leaf-axils. Calyx tube slender, elongated;\r\ncorolla narrowly funnel-form, about 3/4 in. long, its 5 lobes\r\nspreading, 3 of them somewhat united; 5 stamens; 1 pistil\r\nprojecting. Stem: A smooth, branching shrub 2 to 4 ft. high.\r\nLeaves. Opposite, oval, and taper-pointed, finely saw-edged.\r\nFruit: Slender, beaked pods crowned with the 5 calyx lobes.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry or rocky soil, woodlands, hills.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - British Possessions southward to Michigan and\r\nNorth Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe coral honeysuckle determined to woo the hummingbird by\r\nwearing his favorite color; the twining white and yellow\r\nhoneysuckles of our porches chose for their benefactors the\r\nsphinx moths, attracting them by delicious fragrance and deeply\r\nhidden nectar in slender tubes that are visible even in the dark;\r\nwhereas the small-flowered bush honeysuckles still cater to the\r\nbees which, in all probability, once sufficed for the entire\r\nfamily. For them a conspicuous landing place has been provided in\r\nthe more highly colored lower lobe of this flower, from which the\r\nvisitor cannot fail to find the pocket full of nectar that swells\r\nthe base of the tube but when he alights, pollen laden from\r\nanother blossom, he must pay toll by leaving some of the\r\nvitalizing dust on the projecting stigma before he feasts and\r\ndusts himself afresh. After they have been plundered, and\r\nconsequently fertilized, all the honeysuckles change color, this\r\none taking on a deeper yellow to let the bees know the larder is\r\nempty, that they may waste no precious time, but confine their\r\nvisits where they are needed. \"Many flowers adapted to bees show\r\nbutterflies, hawk moths and hummingbirds as intruders,\" says\r\nProfessor Robertson; \"and this is important, since it enables us\r\nto understand how bee-flowers might become modified to suit them\"\r\n- just as certain of the honeysuckles have done. Once the\r\nOriental pink weigelias, grown in nearly every American garden,\r\nwere thought to belong to the Diervilla clan, from which\r\nlater-day systematists have banished them.\r\n\r\nThe EARLY FLY or TWIN HONEYSUCKLE (Lonicera ciliata), found in\r\nmoist, cool woods from Pennsylvania and Michigan far northward,\r\nsends forth pairs of funnel-form, honey-yellow flowers, about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch long, with five, regular lobes, on a\r\nslender footstalk from the leaf axils in May. It is a straggling,\r\nshrubby bush from three to five feet tall. The opposite leaves\r\nare thin, oval, bright green on both sides, the edges hairy. Two\r\nlittle ovoid, light red berries follow the flowers.\r\n\r\nAnother species, a shrubby SWAMP FLY-HONEYSUCKLE (L.\r\noblongifolia), found in wet ground and bogs throughout a similar\r\nrange, blooming about two weeks later, coats the under side of\r\nits young leaves with fine hairs to prevent their pores from\r\nclogging with vapors arising from its moist retreats. The little\r\npale yellow flowers, also growing in pairs on a footstalk from\r\nthe leaf axils, have their tubular corollas strongly cleft into\r\ntwo lips. Reddish markings within serve as pathfinders for the\r\nbumblebee, who finds so much nectar at the base that a tiny\r\nbulging pocket had to be provided to hold it. Sometimes the two\r\nflowers join below like Siamese twins, in which case the pair of\r\ncrimson berries become more or less united.\r\n\r\n                         \"So we grew together,\r\n      Like to a double cherry, seeming parted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne occasionally finds the pink and white twin-flowered TARTARIAN\r\nBUSH HONEYSUCKLE (L. Tartarica) escaped from cultivation in the\r\nEastern States through the agency of birds which feast upon its\r\nlittle round, red, translucent berries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON DANDELION; BLOWBALL; LION'S-TOOTH; PEASANT'S CLOCK\r\n  (Taraxacum Taraxacum; T. Densleonis of Gray)  Chicory family\r\n\r\nFlower-head - Solitary, golden yellow, to 2 in. across,\r\ncontaining 150 to 200 perfect ray florets on a flat receptacle at\r\nthe top of a hollow, milky scape 2 to 18 in. tall. Leaves: From a\r\nvery deep, thick, bitter root; oblong to spatulate in outline,\r\nirregularly jagged.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Lawns, fields, grassy waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - Every month in the year.\r\nDistribution - Around the civilized world.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear common flower that grow'st beside the way,\r\n        Fringing the dusty road with harmless gold.\r\n      . . . .\r\n      Gold such as thine ne'er drew the Spanish prow\r\n        Through the primeval hush of Indian seas,\r\n      Nor wrinkled the lean brow\r\n        Of age, to rob the lover's heart of ease.\r\n      'Tis the spring's largess, which she scatters now\r\n        To rich and poor alike, with lavish hand\r\n        Though most hearts never understand\r\n      To take it at God's value, but pass by\r\n      The offered wealth with unrewarded eye.\"\r\n\r\nLet the triumphant Anglo-Saxon with dreams of expansion that\r\ninclude the round earth, the student of sociology who wishes an\r\ninsight into cooperative methods as opposed to individualism, the\r\nyoung man anxious to learn how to get on, parents with children\r\nto be equipped for the struggle for existence, business men and\r\nemployers of labor, all sit down beside the dandelion and take\r\nits lesson to heart. How has it managed without navies and armies\r\n- for it is no imperialist - to land its peaceful legions on\r\nevery part of the civilized world and take possession of the\r\nsoil? How can this neglected wayside composite weed triumph over\r\nthe most gorgeous hothouse individual on which the horticulturist\r\nexpends all the science at his command; to flourish where others\r\ngive up the struggle defeated; to send its vigorous offspring\r\nabroad prepared for similar conquest of adverse conditions\r\nwherever met to attract myriads of customers to its department\r\nstore, and by consummate executive ability to make every visitor\r\nunwittingly contribute to its success? Any one who doubts the\r\ndandelion's fitness to survive, should humble himself by spending\r\ndays and weeks on his knees, trying to eradicate the plant from\r\neven one small lawn with a knife, only to find the turf starred\r\nwith golden blossoms, or, worse still from his point of view,\r\nhoary with seed balloons, the following spring.\r\n\r\nDeep, very deep, the stocky bitter root penetrates where heat and\r\ndrought affect it not, nor nibbling rabbits, moles, grubs of\r\ninsects, and other burrowers break through and steal. Cut off the\r\nupper portion only with your knife, and not one, but several,\r\nplants will likely sprout from what remains; and, however late in\r\nthe season, will economize stem and leaf to produce flowers and\r\nseeds, cuddled close within the tuft, that set all your pains at\r\nnaught. \"Never say die\" is the dandelion's motto. An exceedingly\r\nbitter medicine is extracted from the root of this dandelion,\r\nformerly known as T. officinale. Likewise are the leaves bitter.\r\nAlthough they appear so early in the spring, they must be\r\nespecially tempting to grazing cattle and predaceous insects, the\r\nrosettes remain untouched, while other succulent, agreeable\r\nplants are devoured wholesale. Only Italians and other thrifty\r\nOld-World immigrants, who go about then with sack and knife\r\ncollecting the fresh young tufts, give the plants pause but even\r\nthey leave the roots intact. When boiled like spinach or eaten\r\nwith French salad dressing, the bitter juices are extracted from\r\nthe leaves or disguised - mean tactics by an enemy outside the\r\ndandelion's calculation. All nations know the plant by some\r\nequivalent for the name dent de lion = lion's tooth, which the\r\njagged edges of the leaves suggest.\r\n\r\nPresently a hollow scape arises to display the flower above the\r\nsurrounding grass. Bridge builders and constructing engineers\r\nknow how yielding and economical, yet how invincibly strong, is\r\nthe hollow tube. March winds may buffet and bend the dandelion's\r\nstem without harm. How children delight to split this slippery\r\ntube, and run it in and out of their mouths until curls form! At\r\nthe top of the scape is a double involucre of narrow, green,\r\nleaf-like scales similar to what all composites have. Half the\r\ninvolucre bends downward to protect the flower from crawling\r\npilferers, half stands erect to play the role for the community\r\nof florets within that the calyx does for individual blossoms.\r\nWhen it is time to close the dandelion shop, business being ended\r\nfor the day, this upper-half of the involucre protects it like\r\nthe heavy shutters merchants put up at their windows.\r\n\r\nSeated on a fleshy receptacle, not one flower, but often two\r\nhundred minute, perfect florets generously cooperate. \"In union\r\nthere is strength\" is another motto adopted, not only by the\r\nchicory clan, but by the entire horde of composites. Each floret\r\nof itself could hope for no attention from busy insects; united,\r\nhow gorgeously attractive these disks of overlapping rays are!\r\nDoubtless each tiny flower was once a five-petaled blossom, for\r\nin the five teeth at the top and the five lines are indications\r\nthat once distinct parts have been welded together to form a more\r\nshowy and suitable corolla. Each floret insures cross-pollination\r\nfrom insects crawling over the head, much as the minute yellow\r\ntubes in the center of a daisy do (q.v.). Quantities of small\r\nbees, wasps, flies, butterflies, and beetles - over a hundred\r\nspecies of insects - come seeking the nectar that wells up in\r\neach little tube, and the abundant pollen, which are greatly\r\nappreciated in early spring, when food is so scarce. In rainy\r\nweather and at night, when its benefactors are not flying, the\r\ncanny dandelion closes completely to protect its precious\r\nattractions. Because the plant, which is likely to bloom every\r\nmonth in the year, may not always certainly reckon on being\r\npollinated by insects, each neglected floret will curl the two\r\nspreading, sticky branches of its style so far backward that they\r\ncome in contact with any pollen that has been carried out of the\r\ntube by the sweeping brushes on their tips. Occasional\r\nself-fertilization is surely better than setting no seed at all\r\nwhen insects fail. Not a chance does the dandelion lose to \"get\r\non.\"\r\n\r\nAfter flowering, it again looks like a bud, lowering its head to\r\nmature seed unobserved. Presently rising on a gradually\r\nlengthened scape to elevate it where there is no interruption for\r\nthe passing breeze from surrounding rivals, the transformed head,\r\nnow globular, white, airy, is even more exquisite, set as it is\r\nwith scores of tiny parachutes ready to sail away. A child's\r\nbreath puffing out the time of day, a vireo plucking at the\r\nfluffy ball for lining to put in its nest, the summer breeze, the\r\nscythe, rake, and mowing machines, sudden gusts of winds sweeping\r\nthe country before thunderstorms - these are among the agents\r\nthat set the flying vagabonds free. In the hay used for packing\r\nthey travel to foreign lands in ships, and, once landed, readily\r\nadapt themselves to conditions as they find them. After soaking\r\nin the briny ocean for twenty-eight days - long enough for a\r\ncurrent to carry them a thousand miles along the coast - they are\r\nstill able to germinate.\r\n\r\nThe DWARF DANDELION, CYNTHIA, or VIRGINIA GOATSBEARD (Adepogon\r\nVirginicum; formerly Krigia Virginica) - with from two to six\r\nlong-peduncled, flat, deep yellow or reddish-orange flower heads,\r\nabout an inch and a half across, on the summit of its stem from\r\nMay to October, elects to grow in moist meadows, woodlands, and\r\nshady rocky places. How it glorifies them! From a tuffet of\r\nspatulate, wavy-toothed or entire leaves, the smooth, shining,\r\nbranching stem arises bearing a single oblong, clasping leaf\r\nbelow the middle. Particularly beautiful is its silvery\r\nseed-ball, the pappus consisting of about a dozen hairlike\r\nbristles inside a ring of small oblong scales, on which the seed\r\nsails away. Range, from Massachusetts to Manitoba, south to\r\nGeorgia and Kansas.\r\n\r\nA charming little plant, the CAROLINA DWARF DANDELION or KRIGIA\r\n(A. Carolinianum), once confounded with the above, sends up\r\nseveral unbranched scapes from the same tuffet. It blooms in dry,\r\nsandy soil from April to August, from Maine and Minnesota to the\r\nGulf States.\r\n\r\nLike a small edition of Lowell's \"dear common flower\" is the TALL\r\nDANDELION, or AUTUMNAL HAWKBIT (Leontodon autumnale), its\r\nslender, wiry, branching scape six inches to two feet high,\r\nterminated by several flower-heads, each on a separate peduncle,\r\nwhich is usually a little thickened and scaly just below it. Only\r\nforty to seventy five-toothed ray florets spread in a flat golden\r\ndisk from an oblong involucre. They close in rainy weather and at\r\nnight. From June to November, in spite of its common name, it\r\nblooms in fields and along roadsides, its brownish seed-plumes\r\nrapidly following; but these are produced at the frightfully\r\nextravagant cost of over two hundred thousand grains of pollen to\r\neach head, it is estimated. The Greek generic name, meaning\r\nlion's tooth, refers to the shape of the lobes of the narrowly\r\noblong leaves in a tuft at the base. Range, from New Jersey and\r\nOhio far northward. Naturalized from Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD SOW-THISTLE; MILK THISTLE\r\n  (Sonchus arvensis)  Chicory family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Bright yellow, very showy, to 2 in. across,\r\nseveral or numerous, on rough peduncles in a spreading cluster.\r\nInvolucre nearly 1 in. high; the scales narrow, rough. Stem: 2 to\r\n4 ft. high, leafy below, naked, and paniculately branched above,\r\nfrom deep roots and creeping rootstocks. Leaves: Long, narrow,\r\nspiny, but not sharp-toothed; deeply cut, mostly clasping at\r\nbase.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Meadows, fields, roadsides, saltwater\r\nmarshes.\r\nFlowering Season - July-October.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Minnesota and Utah, south to New\r\nJersey.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be long, at their present rate of increase, before this\r\nand its sister immigrant become very common weeds throughout our\r\nentire area, as they are in Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe ANNUAL SOW-THISTLE or HARE'S LETTUCE (S. oleraceus), its\r\nsmaller, pale yellow flower-heads, with smooth involucres more\r\nclosely grouped, now occupies our fields and waste places with\r\nthe assurance of a native. Honeybees chiefly, but many other\r\nbees, wasps, brilliant little flower-flies (Syrphidae), and\r\nbutterflies among other winged visitors which alight on the\r\nflowers, from May to November, are responsible for the copious,\r\nsoft, fine, white-plumed seeds that the winds waft away to fresh\r\ncolonizing ground. The leaves clasp the stem by deep ear-like or\r\narrow-shaped lobes, or the large lower ones are on petioles,\r\nlyrate-pinnatifid, the terminal division commonly large and\r\ntriangular; the margins all toothed. Frugal European peasants use\r\nthem as a potherb or salad. One of the plant's common folk-names\r\nin the Old World is hare's palace. According to the \"Grete\r\nHerbale,\" if \"the hare come under it, he is sure no beast can\r\ntouch hym!' That was the spot Brer Rabbit was looking for when\r\nBrer Fox lay low! Another early writer declares that \"when hares\r\nare overcome with heat they eat of an herb called hare's-lettuce,\r\nhare's-house, hare's-palace; and there is no disease in this\r\nbeast the cure whereof she does not seek for in this herb.\" Who\r\nhas detected our cottontails nibbling the succulent leaves?\r\n\r\n\r\nTALL or WILD LETTUCE; WILD OPIUM\r\n  (Lactuca Canadensis)  Chicory family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Numerous small, about 1/4 in. across, involucre\r\ncylindric, rays pale yellow; followed by abundant, soft, bright\r\nwhite pappus; the heads growing in loose, branching, terminal\r\nclusters. Stem: Smooth, 3 to 10 ft. high, leafy up to the flower\r\npanicle; juice milky. Leaves: Upper ones lance shaped; lower ones\r\noften 1 ft. long, wavy-lobed, often pinnatifid, taper pointed,\r\nnarrowed into flat petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, open ground; roadsides.\r\nFlowering Season - June-November.\r\nDistribution - Georgia, westward to Arkansas, north to the\r\nBritish Possessions.\r\n\r\nFew gardeners allow the table lettuce (sativa) to go to seed but\r\nas it is next of kin to this common wayside weed, it bears a\r\nstrong likeness to it in the loose, narrow panicles of\r\ncream-colored flowers, followed by more charming, bright white\r\nlittle pompons. Where the garden varieties originated, or what\r\nthey were, nobody knows. Herodotus says lettuce was eaten as a\r\nsalad in 550 B.C.; in Pliny's time it was cultivated, and even\r\nblanched, so as to be had at all seasons of the year by the\r\nRomans. Among the privy-purse expenses of Henry VIII is a reward\r\nto a certain gardener for bringing \"lettuze\" and cherries to\r\nHampton Court. Quaint old Parkinson, enumerating \"the vertues of\r\nthe lettice,\" says, \"They all cool a hot and fainting stomache.\"\r\nWhen the milky juice has been thickened (lactucarium), it is\r\nsometimes used as a substitute for opium by regular practitioners\r\n- a fluid employed by the plants themselves, it is thought, to\r\ndiscourage creatures from feasting at their expense (see\r\nmilkweed). Certain caterpillars, however, eat the leaves readily;\r\nbut offer lettuce or poppy foliage to grazing cattle, and they\r\nwill go without food rather than touch it.\r\n\r\n     \"What's one man's poison, Signor,\r\n      Is another's meat or drink.\"\r\n\r\nRabbits, for example, have been fed on the deadly nightshade for\r\na week without injury.\r\n\r\nThe HAIRY or RED WILD LETTUCE (L. hirsuta), similar to the\r\npreceding, but often with dark reddish stem, peduncles, and tiny\r\nflower-cups, the ray florets varying from yellow to pale reddish\r\nor purplish, has longer leaves, deeply cut or lobed almost to the\r\nwide midrib. After what we learned when studying the barberry and\r\nthe prickly pear cactus, for example, about plants that choose to\r\nlive in dry soil, it is not surprising to find that this is a\r\nlower, less leafy, and more hairy plant than the moisture-loving\r\ntall lettuce.\r\n\r\nAn European immigrant, naturalized here but recently, the PRICKLY\r\nLETTUCE (L. Scariola) has nevertheless made itself so very much\r\nat home in a short time that it has already become a troublesome\r\nweed from New England to Pennsylvania, westward to Minnesota and\r\nMissouri. But when we calculate that every plant produces over\r\neight thousand fluffy white-winged seeds on its narrow panicle,\r\nready to sail away on the first breeze, no wonder so well endowed\r\nand prolific an invader marches triumphantly across continents.\r\nThe long, pale green, spiny-margined, milky leaves, with stiff\r\nprickles on the midrib beneath, are doubly protected against\r\ninsect borers and grazing cattle.\r\n\r\n \"Look at this delicate plant that lifts its head from the\r\nmeadow;\r\n  See how its leaves all point to the North as true as the\r\nmagnet.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Longfellow must have had the coarse-growing,\r\nyellow-flowered, daisy-like PRAIRIE ROSIN-WEED (Silphium\r\nlaciniatum) in mind when he wrote this stanza of \"Evangeline,\"\r\nhis lines apply with more exactness to the delicate prickly\r\nlettuce, our eastern compass plant. Not until 1895 did Professor\r\nJ. C. Arthur discover that when the garden lettuce is allowed to\r\nflower, its stem leaves also exhibit polarity. The great lower\r\nleaves of the rosin-weed, which stand nearly vertical, with their\r\nfaces to the east and west, and their edges to the north and\r\nsouth, have directed many a traveler, not from Acadia only,\r\nacross the prairie until it has earned the titles pilot-weed,\r\ncompass or polar plant. Various theories have been advanced to\r\naccount for the curious phenomenon, some claiming that the leaves\r\ncontained sufficient iron to reader them magnetic - a theory\r\npromptly exploded by chemical analysis. Others supposed that the\r\nresinous character of the leaves made them susceptible to\r\nmagnetic influence; but as rosin is a non-conductor of\r\nelectricity, of course this hypothesis likewise proved untenable.\r\nAt last Dr. Asa Gray brought forward the only sensible\r\nexplanation: inasmuch as both surfaces of the rosin-weed leaf are\r\nessentially alike, there being very nearly as many stomata on the\r\nupper side as on the under, both surfaces are equally sensitive\r\nto sunlight; therefore the leaf twists on its petiole until both\r\nsides share it as equally as is possible. While the polarity of\r\nthe prickly lettuce leaves is by no means so marked, Dr. Gray's\r\ntheory about the rosin-weed may be applied to them as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nORANGE or TAWNY HAWKWEED; GOLDEN MOUSE-EAR HAWKWEED; DEVIL'S\r\nPAINT-BRUSH\r\n  (Hieracium aurantiacum)  Chicory family\r\n\r\nFlower-beads - Reddish orange; 1 in. across or less, the\r\n5-toothed rays overlapping in several series; several heads on\r\nshort peduncles in a terminal cluster. Stem: Usually leafless, or\r\nwith 1 to 2 small sessile leaves; 6 to 20 in. high, slender,\r\nhairy, from a tuft of hairy, spatulate, or oblong leaves at the\r\nbase.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Fields, woods, roadsides, dry places.\r\nFlowering Season - June-September.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania and Middle States northward into\r\nBritish Possessions.\r\n\r\nPeculiar reddish-orange disks, similar in shade to the butterfly\r\nweed's umbels, attract our eyes no less than those of the bees,\r\nflies, and butterflies for whom such splendor was designed. After\r\ncross-fertilization has been effected, chiefly through the agency\r\nof the smaller bees, a single row of slender, brownish,\r\npersistent bristles attached to the seeds transforms the head\r\ninto the \"devil's paint-brush.\" Another popular title in England,\r\nfrom whence the plant originally came, is Grimm the Collier. All\r\nthe plants in this genus take their name from hierax = a hawk,\r\nbecause people in the old country once thought that birds of prey\r\nswooped earthward to sharpen their eyesight with leaves of the\r\nhawkweed, hawkbit, or speerhawk, as they are variously called.\r\nTransplanted into the garden, the orange hawkweed forms a\r\nspreading mass of unusual, splendid color.\r\n\r\nThe RATTLESNAKE-WEED, EARLY or VEIN-LEAF HAWKWEED, SNAKE or POOR\r\nROBIN'S PLANTAIN (H. venosum), with flower-heads only about half\r\nan inch across, sends up a smooth, slender stem, paniculately\r\nbranched above, to display the numerous dandelion-yellow disks as\r\nearly as May, although October is not too late to find this\r\ngenerous bloomer in pine woodlands, dry thickets, and sandy soil.\r\nPurplish-veined oval leaves, more or less hairy, that spread in a\r\ntuft next the ground, are probably as efficacious in curing\r\nsnakebites as those of the rattlesnake plantain (q.v.). When a\r\ncredulous generation believed that the Creator had indicated with\r\nsome sign on each plant the special use for which each was\r\nintended, many leaves were found to have veinings suggesting the\r\nmarks on a snake's body; therefore, by simple reasoning, they\r\nmust extract venom. How delightful is faith cure!\r\n\r\nUnlike the preceding, the CANADA HAWKWEED (H. Canadense), lacks a\r\nbasal tuft at flowering time, but its firm stem, that may be any\r\nheight from one to five feet, is amply furnished with oblong to\r\nlance-shaped leaves seated on it, their midrib prominent, the\r\nmargins sparingly but sharply toothed. In dry, open woods and\r\nthickets, and along shady roadsides, its loosely clustered heads\r\nof clear yellow, about one inch across, are displayed from July\r\nto September; and later the copious brown bristles remain for\r\nsparrows to peck at.\r\n\r\nThe ROUGH HAWKWEED (H. scabrum), with a stout, stiff stem crowned\r\nwith a narrow branching cluster of small yellow flower-heads on\r\ndark bristly peduncles, also lacks a basal tuft at flowering\r\ntime. Its hairy oblong leaves are seated on the rigid stem. In\r\ndry, open places, clearings, and woodlands from Nova Scotia to\r\nGeorgia, and westward to Nebraska, it blooms from July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nMore slender and sprightly is the HAIRY HAWKWEED (H. Gronovii),\r\ncommon in sterile soil from Massachusetts and Illinois to the\r\nGulf States. The basal leaves and lower part of the stiff stem,\r\nespecially, are hairy, not to allow too free transpiration of\r\nprecious moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN ASTER\r\n  (Chrysopsis Mariana)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nPlower-heads - Composite, yellow, 1 in. wide or less, a few\r\ncorymbed flowers on glandular stalks; each composed of perfect\r\ntubular disk florets surrounded by pistillate ray florets the\r\ninvolucre campanulate, its narrow bracts overlapping in several\r\nseries. Stem: Stout, silky-hairy when young, nearly smooth later,\r\n1 to 2 1/2 ft. tall. Leaves: Alternate, oblong to spatulate,\r\nentire.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry soil, or sandy, not far inland.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - Long Island and Pennsylvania to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nWhoever comes upon clumps of these handsome flowers by the dusty\r\nroadside cannot but be impressed with the appropriateness of\r\ntheir generic name (Chrysos = gold; opsis = aspect). Farther\r\nwestward, north and south. it is the HAIRY GOLDEN ASTER (C.\r\nvillosa), a pale, hoary-haired plant with similar flowers borne\r\nat midsummer, that is the common species.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDENRODS\r\n  (Solidago)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nWhen these flowers transform whole acres into \"fields of the\r\ncloth-of-gold,\" the slender wands swaying by every roadside, and\r\npurple asters add the final touch of imperial splendor to the\r\nautumn landscape, already glorious with gold and crimson, is any\r\nparterre of Nature's garden the world around more gorgeous than\r\nthat portion of it we are pleased to call ours? Within its limits\r\neighty-five species of goldenrod flourish, while a few have\r\nstrayed into Mexico and South America, and only two or three\r\nbelong to Europe, where many of ours are tenderly cultivated in\r\ngardens, as they should be here, had not Nature been so lavish.\r\nTo name all these species, or the asters, the sparrows, and the\r\nwarblers at sight is a feat probably no one living can perform;\r\nnevertheless, certain of the commoner goldenrods have\r\nwell-defined peculiarities that a little field practice soon\r\nfixes in the novice's mind.\r\n\r\nAlong shady roadsides, and in moist woods and thickets, from\r\nAugust to October, the BLUE-STEMMED, WREATH or WOODLAND GOLDENROD\r\n(S. caesia) sways an unbranched stem with a bluish bloom on it.\r\nIt is studded with pale golden clusters of tiny florets in the\r\naxils of lance-shaped, feather-veined leaves for nearly its\r\nentire length. Range from Maine, Ontario, and Minnesota to the\r\nGulf States. None is prettier, more dainty, than this common\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn rich woodlands and thicket borders we find the ZIG-ZAG or\r\nBROAD-LEAVED GOLDENROD (S. flexicaulis; S. latifolia of Gray) its\r\nprolonged, angled stem that grows as if waveringly uncertain of\r\nthe proper direction to take, strung with small clusters of\r\nyellow florets, somewhat after the manner of the preceding\r\nspecies. But its saw-edged leaves are ovate, sharply tapering to\r\na point, and narrowed at the base into petioles. It blooms from\r\nJuly to September. Range from New Brunswick to Georgia, and\r\nwestward beyond the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nDuring the same blooming period, and through a similar range, our\r\nonly albino, with an Irish-bull name, the WHITE GOLDENROD, or\r\nmore properly SILVER-ROD (S. bicolor), cannot be mistaken. Its\r\ncream-white florets also grow in little clusters from the upper\r\naxils of a usually simple and hairy gray stem six inches to four\r\nfeet high. Most of the heads are crowded in a narrow, terminal\r\npyramidal cluster. This plant approaches more nearly the idea of\r\na rod than its relatives. The leaves; which are broadly oblong\r\ntoward the base of the stem, and narrowed into long margined\r\npetioles, are frequently quite hairy, for the silver-rod elects\r\nto live in dry soil, and its juices must be protected from heat\r\nand too rapid transpiration.\r\n\r\nIn swamps and peat bogs the BOG GOLDENROD (S. uliginosa) sends up\r\ntwo to four feet high a densely flowered, oblong, terminal spire;\r\nits short branches so appressed that this stem also has a\r\nwand-like effect. The leaves, which are lance-shaped or oblong,\r\ngradually increase in size and length of petiole until the lowest\r\noften measure nine inches long. Season, July to September. Range,\r\nfrom Newfoundland to Pennsylvania and westward beyond the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nNow we leave the narrow, unbranched, wand goldenrods strung with\r\nclusters of minute florets, which, however slender and charming,\r\nare certainly far less effective in the landscape than the\r\nfollowing members of their clan which have their multitudes of\r\nflorets arranged in large, compound, more or less widely\r\nbranching, terminal, pyramidal clusters. On this latter plan the\r\nSHOWY or NOBLE GOLDENROD (S. speciosa) displays its splendid,\r\ndense, ascending branches of bloom from August to October.\r\nEuropean gardeners object to planting goldenrods, complaining\r\nthat they so quickly impoverish a rich bed that neighboring\r\nplants starve. This noble species becomes ignoble indeed, unless\r\ngrown in rich soil, when it spreads in thrifty circular tufts.\r\nThe stout stem, which often assumes reddish tints, rises from\r\nthree to seven feet high, and the smooth, firm, broadly oval,\r\nsaw-toothed lower leaves are long-petioled. Range, from Nova\r\nScotia to the Carolinas, westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\nWhen crushed in the hand, the dotted, bright green, lance-shaped,\r\nentire leaves of the SWEET GOLDENROD or BLUE MOUNTAIN TEA (S.\r\nodora) cannot be mistaken, for they give forth a pleasant anise\r\nscent. The slender, simple, smooth stem is crowned with a\r\ngraceful panicle, whose branches have the florets seated all on\r\none side. Dry soil. New England to the Gulf States, July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThe WRINKLE-LEAVED or TALL, HAIRY GOLDENROD or BITTERWEED (S.\r\nrugosa), a perversely variable species, its hairy stem perhaps\r\nonly a foot high, or, maybe, over seven feet, its rough leaves\r\nbroadly oval to lance-shaped, sharply saw-edged, few if any\r\nfurnished with footstems, lifts a large, compound, and gracefully\r\ncurved panicle, whose florets are seated on one side of its\r\nspreading branches. Sometimes the stem branches at the summit.\r\nOne usually finds it blooming in dry soil from July to November,\r\nthroughout a range extending from Newfoundland and Ontario to the\r\nGulf States.\r\n\r\nUsually the ELM-LEAVED GOLDENROD (S. ulmifolia) sends up several\r\nslender, narrow spires of deep yellow bloom from about the same\r\npoint at the summit of the smooth stem, like long, tapering\r\nfingers. Small, oblong, entire leaves are seated on these\r\nelongated sprays, while below the inflorescence the large leaves\r\ntaper to a sharp point, and are coarsely and sharply toothed. In\r\nwoods and copses from Maine and Minnesota to Georgia and Texas\r\nthis common goldenrod blooms from July to September.\r\n\r\nThe unusually beautiful, spreading, recurved, branching panicle\r\nof bloom borne by the EARLY, PLUME, or SHARP-TOOTHED GOLDENROD or\r\nYELLOW-TOP (S. juncea), so often dried for winter decoration, may\r\nwave four feet high, but usually not over two, at the summit of a\r\nsmooth, rigid stem. Toward the top, narrow, elliptical, uncut\r\nleaves are seated on the stalk; below, much larger leaves, their\r\nsharp teeth slanting forward, taper into a broad petiole, whose\r\nedges may be cut like fringe. In dry, rocky soil this is,\r\nperhaps, the first and last goldenrod to bloom, having been found\r\nas early as June, and sometimes lasting into November. Range,\r\nfrom North Carolina and Missouri very far north.\r\n\r\nWest of the Mississippi how beautiful are the dry prairies in\r\nautumn with the MISSOURI GOLDENROD (S. Missouriensis), its short,\r\nbroad, spreading panicle waving at the summit of a smooth,\r\nslender stem from two to five feet tall. Its firm, rather thick\r\nleaves are lance-shaped, triple-nerved, entire, very\r\nrough-margined, or perhaps the lowest ones with a few scattered\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the commonest of all the lovely clan east of the\r\nMississippi, or throughout a range extending from Arizona and\r\nFlorida northward to British Columbia and New Brunswick, is the\r\nCANADA GOLDENROD or YELLOW-WEED (S. Canadensis). Surely everyone\r\nmust be familiar with the large, spreading, dense-flowered\r\npanicle, with recurved sprays, that crowns a rough, hairy stem\r\nsometimes eight feet tall, or again only two feet. Its\r\nlance-shaped, acutely pointed, triple-nerved leaves are rough,\r\nand the lower ones saw-edged. From August to November one cannot\r\nfail to find it blooming in dry soil.\r\n\r\nMost brilliantly colored of its tribe is the low-growing GRAY or\r\nFIELD GOLDENROD or DYER'S WEED (S. nemoralis). The rich, deep\r\nyellow of its little spreading, recurved, and usually one-sided\r\npanicles is admirably set off by the ashy gray, or often cottony,\r\nstem, and the hoary, grayish-green leaves in the open, sterile\r\nplaces where they arise from July to November. Quebec and the\r\nNorthwest Territory to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nNo longer classed as a true Solidago, but the type of a distinct\r\ngenus, the LANCE-LEAVED, BUSHY, or FRAGRANT GOLDENROD (Euthamia\r\ngraminifolia; formerly S. lanceolata) lifts its flat-topped,\r\ntansy-like, fragrant clusters of flower-heads from two to four\r\nfeet above moist ground. From July to September it transforms\r\nwhole riverbanks, low fields, and roadsides into a veritable El\r\nDorado. Its numerous leaves are very narrow, lance-shaped, triple\r\nor five nerved, uncut, sometimes with a few resinous dots. Range,\r\nfrom New Brunswick to the Gulf, and westward to Nebraska.\r\n\r\n     \"Along the roadside, like the flowers of gold\r\n        That tawny Incas for their gardens wrought,\r\n      Heavy with sunshine droops the goldenrod.\"\r\n\r\nBewildered by the multitude of species, and wondering at the\r\nenormous number of representatives of many of them, we cannot but\r\ninquire into the cause of such triumphal conquest of a continent\r\nby a single genus. Much is explained simply in the statement that\r\ngoldenrods belong to the vast order of Compositae, flowers in\r\nreality made up sometimes of hundreds of minute florets united\r\ninto a far-advanced socialistic community having for its motto,\r\n\"In union there is strength.\" (See Daisy) In the first place,\r\nsuch an association of florets makes a far more conspicuous\r\nadvertisement than a single flower, one that can be seen by\r\ninsects at a great distance; for most of the composite plants\r\nlive in large colonies, each plant, as well as each floret,\r\nhelping the others in attracting their benefactors' attention.\r\nThe facility with which insects are enabled to collect both\r\npollen and nectar makes the goldenrods exceedingly popular\r\nrestaurants. Finally, the visits of.insects are more likely to\r\nprove effectual, because any one that alights must touch several\r\nor many florets, and cross-pollinate them simply by crawling over\r\na head. The disk florets mostly contain both stamens and pistil,\r\nwhile the ray florets in one series are all male. Immense numbers\r\nof wasps, hornets, bees, flies, beetles, and \"bugs\" feast without\r\neffort here indeed, the budding entomologist might form a large\r\ncollection of Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera\r\nfrom among the. visitors to a single field of goldenrod alone.\r\nUsually to be discovered among the throng are the velvety black\r\nLytta or Cantharis, that impostor wasp-beetle, the black and\r\nyellow wavy-banded, red-legged locust-tree borer, and the painted\r\nClytus, banded with yellow and sable, squeaking contentedly as he\r\ngnaws the florets that feed him.\r\n\r\nWhere the slender, brown, plume-tipped wands etch their charming\r\noutline above the snow-covered fields, how the sparrows, finches,\r\nbuntings, and juncos love to congregate, of course helping to\r\nscatter the seeds to the wind while satisfying their hunger on\r\nthe swaying, down-curved stalks. Now that the leaves are gone,\r\nsome of the goldenrod stems are seen to bulge as if a tiny ball\r\nwere concealed under the bark. In spring a little winged tenant,\r\na fly, will emerge from the gall that has been his cradle all\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECAMPANE; HORSEHEAL; YELLOW STARWORT\r\n  (Inula Helenium)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Large, yellow, solitary or a few, 2 to 4 in.\r\nacross; on long, stout peduncles; the scaly green involucre\r\nnearly 1 in. high, holding disk florets surrounded by a fringe of\r\nlong, very narrow, 3-toothed ray florets. Stem: Usually\r\nunbranched, 2 to 6 ft. high, hairy above. Leaves: Alternate,\r\nlarge, broadly oblong, pointed, saw-edged, rough above, woolly\r\nbeneath some with heart-shaped, clasping bases.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides, fields, fence rows, damp pastures.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Carolinas, and westward to\r\nMinnesota and Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"September may be described as the month of tall weeds;\" says\r\nJohn Burroughs. \"Where they have been suffered to stand, along\r\nfences, by roadsides, and in forgotten corners,- redroot,\r\nragweed, vervain, goldenrod, burdock, elecampane, thistles,\r\nteasels, nettles, asters, etc. - how they lift themselves up as\r\nif not afraid to be seen now! They are all outlaws; every man's\r\nhand is against them yet how surely they hold their own. They\r\nlove the roadside, because here they are comparatively safe and\r\nragged and dusty, like the common tramps that they are, they form\r\none of the characteristic features of early fall.\"\r\n\r\nYet the elecampane has not always led a vagabond existence. Once\r\nit had its passage paid across the Atlantic, because special\r\nvirtue was attributed to its thick, mucilaginous roots as a\r\nhorse-medicine. For over two thousand years it has been employed\r\nby home doctors in Europe and Asia; and at first Old World\r\nimmigrants thought they could not live here without the plant on\r\ntheir farms. Once given a chance to naturalize itself, no\r\ncomposite is slow in seizing it. The vigorous elecampane, rearing\r\nits fringy, yellow disks above lichen-covered stone walls in New\r\nEngland, the Virginia rail fence, and the rank weedy growth along\r\nbarbed-wire barriers farther west, now bids fair to cross the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUP-PLANT; INDIAN-CUP; RAGGED CUP; ROSIN-PLANT\r\n  (Silphium perfoliatum)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nPlower-heads - Yellow, nearly flat; 2 to 3 in. across; 20 to 30\r\nnarrow, pistillate ray florets, about 1 in. long, overlapping in\r\n2 or 3 series around the perfect but sterile disk florets. Stem:\r\n4 to 8 ft. tall, square, smooth, usually branched above.\r\nLeaves: Opposite, ovate, upper ones united by their bases to form\r\na cup; lower ones large, coarsely toothed, and narrowed into\r\nmargined petioles; all filled with resinous juice.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, low ground near streams.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Ontario, New York, and Georgia, westward to\r\nMinnesota, Nebraska, and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIt behooves a species related to the wonderful compass-plant\r\n(q.v.) to do something unusual with its leaves; hence this one\r\nmakes cups to catch rain by uniting its upper pairs. Darwin's\r\nexperiments with infinitesimal doses of ammonia in stimulating\r\nleaf activity may throw some light on this singular arrangement.\r\nSo many plants provide traps to catch rain, although fourteen\r\ngallons of it contain only one grain of ammonia, that we must\r\nbelieve there is a wise physiological reason for calling upon the\r\nleaves to assist the roots in absorbing it, A native of Western\r\nprairies, the cup-plant has now become naturalized so far east as\r\nthe neighborhood 6f New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE SUNFLOWER; OX-EYE\r\n  (Heliopsis helianthoides; H. laevis of Gray)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Entirely golden yellow, daisy-like, 1 1/2 to 2 1/2\r\nin. across, the perfect disk florets inserted on a convex, chaffy\r\nreceptacle, and surrounded by pistillate, fertile, 3-toothed ray\r\nflorets; usually numerous solitary heads borne on long peduncles\r\nfrom axils of upper leaves. Stem: 3 to 5 ft. tall, branching\r\nabove, smooth. Leaves: Opposite, ovate, and tapering to a sharp\r\npoint, sharply and evenly toothed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open places; rich, low ground; beside\r\nstreams.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Southern Canada to Florida, westward to Illinois\r\nand Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAlong the streams the numerous flower-heads of this gorgeous\r\nsunbearer shine out from afar, brightening a long, meandering\r\ncourse across the low-lying meadows. Like heralds of good things\r\nto come, they march a little in advance of the brilliant pageant\r\nof wild flowers that sweeps across the country from midsummer\r\ntill killing frost. Most people mistake them for true,\r\nyellow-disked sunflowers, whose ray florets are neutral, not\r\nfertile as these long persistent ones are, But no one should\r\nconfuse them with the dark cone-centered ox-eye daisy. Small\r\nbees, wasps, hornets, flies, little butterflies, beetles, and\r\nlower insects come to feast on the nectar and pollen within the\r\nminute tubular disk florets. The bright fulvous and black pearl\r\ncrescent butterfly, with a trifle over an inch wing expanse; the\r\ncommon hairstreak; the even commoner little white butterfly; and\r\nthe tiny black sooty wing, among others, appear to find generous\r\nentertainment here. The last named little fellow, when in the\r\ncaterpillar stage, formed a cradle for himself by folding\r\ntogether a leaf of the ubiquitous green-flowered pigweed or\r\nlamb's quarters (Cizenopodium album) and stitching the edges\r\ntogether with a few silken threads. Here it slept by day,\r\nemerging only at night to feed. Usually one has not long to wait\r\nbefore discovering the white-dotted sooty wing among the\r\nmidsummer composites.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-EYED SUSAN; YELLOW or OX-EYE DAISY; NIGGER-HEAD; GOLDEN\r\nJERUSALEM; PURPLE CONE-FLOWER\r\n (Rudbeckia hirta)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - From 10 to 20 orange-yellow neutral rays around a\r\nconical, dark purplish-brown disk of florets containing both\r\nstamens and pistil. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. tall, hairy, rough, usually\r\nunbranched, often tufted. Leaves: Oblong to lance-shaped, thick,\r\nsparingly notched, rough.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open sunny places; dry fields.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Ontario and the Northwest Territory south to\r\nColorado and the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nSo very many weeds having come to our Eastern shores from Europe,\r\nand marched farther and farther west year by year, it is but fair\r\nthat black-eyed Susan, a native of Western clover fields, should\r\ntravel toward the Atlantic in bundles of hay whenever she gets\r\nthe chance, to repay Eastern farmers in their own coin. Do these\r\ngorgeous heads know that all our showy rudbeckias - some with\r\norange red at the base of their ray florets - have become prime\r\nfavorites of late years in European gardens, so offering them\r\nstill another chance to overrun the Old World, to which so much\r\nAmerican hay is shipped? Thrifty farmers may decry the\r\nimportation into their mowing lots, but there is a glory to the\r\ncone-flower beside which the glitter of a gold coin fades into\r\npaltry nothingness. Having been instructed in the decorative\r\nusefulness of all this genus by European landscape gardeners, we\r\nAmericans now importune the Department of Agriculture for seeds\r\nthrough members of Congress, even Representatives of States that\r\nhave passed stringent laws against the dissemination of \"weeds.\"\r\nInasmuch as each black-eyed Susan puts into daily operation the\r\nbusiness methods of the white daisy (q.v.), methods which have\r\nbecome a sort of creed for the entire composite horde to live by,\r\nit is plain that she may defy both farmers and legislators. Bees,\r\nwasps, flies, butterflies, and beetles could not be kept away\r\nfrom an entertainer so generous; for while the nectar in the\r\ndeep, tubular brown florets may be drained only by long, slender\r\ntongues, pollen is accessible to all. Anyone who has had a jar of\r\nthese yellow daisies standing on a polished table indoors, and\r\ntried to keep its surface free from a ring of golden dust around\r\nthe flowers, knows how abundant their pollen is. There are those\r\nwho vainly imagine that the slaughter of dozens of English\r\nsparrows occasionally is going to save this land of liberty from\r\nbeing overrun with millions of the hardy little gamins that have\r\nproved themselves so fit in the struggle for survival. As vainly\r\nmay farmers try to exterminate a composite that has once taken\r\npossession of their fields.\r\n\r\nBlazing hot sunny fields, in which black-eyed Susan feels most\r\ncomfortable, suit the TALL or GREEN-HEADED CONE-FLOWER OR\r\nTHIMBLEWEED (R. laciniata) not at all. Its preference is for\r\nmoist thickets such as border swamps and meadow runnels.\r\nConsequently it has no need of the bristly-hairy coat that\r\nscreens the yellow daisy from too tierce, sunlight, and great\r\nneed of more branches and leaves. (See prickly pear.) This is a\r\nsmooth, much branched plant, towering sometimes twelve feet high,\r\nthough commonly not even half that height; its great lower\r\nleaves, on long petioles, have from three to seven divisions\r\nvariously lobed and toothed; while the stem leaves are\r\nirregularly three to five parted or divided. The numerous showy\r\nheads, which measure from two and a half to four inches across,\r\nhave from six to ten bright yellow rays drooping a trifle around\r\na dull greenish-yellow conical disk that gradually lengthens to\r\ntwice its breadth, if not more, as the seeds mature.\r\nJuly-September, Quebec to Montana, and southward to the Gulf of\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALL or GIANT SUNFLOWER\r\n  (Heliainthus giganteus)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Several, on long, rough-hairy peduncles; 1 1/2 to\r\n2 1/4 in. broad; 10 to 20 pale yellow neutral rays around a\r\nyellowish disk whose florets are perfect, fertile. Stem: 3 to 12\r\nft. tall, bristly-hairy, usually branching above, often reddish\r\nfrom a perennial, fleshy root. Leaves: Rough, firm, lance-shaped,\r\nsaw-toothed, sessile.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Low ground, wet meadows, swamps. Flowering\r\nSeason - August-October.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Nebraska and the Northwest Territory,\r\nsouth to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nTo how many sun-shaped golden disks with outflashing rays might\r\nnot the generic name of this clan (helios = the sun, anthos = a\r\nflower) be as fittingly applied: from midsummer till frost the\r\nearth seems given up to floral counterparts of his worshipful\r\nmajesty. If, as we are told, one-ninth of all flowering plants in\r\nthe world belong to the composite order, of which over sixteen\r\nhundred species are found in North America north of Mexico,\r\nsurely over half this number are made up after the daisy pattern\r\n(q.v.), the most successful arrangement known, and the majority\r\nof these are wholly or partly yellow. Most conspicuous of the\r\nhorde are the sunflowers, albeit they never reach in the wild\r\nstate the gigantic dimensions and weight that cultivated, dark\r\nbrown centered varieties produced from the COMMON SUNFLOWER (H.\r\nannus) have attained. For many years the origin of the latter\r\nflower, which suddenly shone forth in European gardens with\r\nunwonted splendor, was in doubt. Only lately. it was learned that\r\nwhen Champlain and Segur visited the Indians on Lake Huron's\r\neastern shores about three centuries ago, they saw them\r\ncultivating this plant, which must have been brought by them from\r\nits native prairies beyond the Mississippi - a plant whose stalks\r\nfurnished them with a textile fiber, its leaves fodder, its\r\nflowers a yellow dye, and its seeds, most valuable of all, food\r\nand hair oil. Early settlers in Canada were not slow in sending\r\nhome to Europe so decorative and useful an acquisition. Swine,\r\npoultry, and parrots were fed on its rich seeds. Its flowers,\r\neven under Indian cultivation had already reached abnormal size.\r\nOf the sixty varied and interesting species of wild sunflowers\r\nknown to scientists, all are North American.\r\nMoore's pretty statement,\r\n\r\n     \"As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets\r\n      The same look which she turn'd when he rose,\"\r\n\r\nlacks only truth to make it fact. The flower does not travel\r\ndaily on its stalk from east to west. Often the top of the stem\r\nturns sharply toward the light to give the leaves better\r\nexposure, but the presence or absence of a terminal flower\r\naffects its action not at all.\r\n\r\nFormerly the garden species was thought to be a native, not of\r\nour prairies, but of Mexico and Peru, because the Spanish\r\nconquerors found it employed there as a mystic and sacred symbol,\r\nmuch as the Egyptians employed the lotus in their sculpture. In\r\nthe temples the handmaidens wore upon their breasts plates of\r\ngold beaten into the likeness of the sunflower. But none of the\r\neighteen species of helianthus found south of our borders\r\nproduces under cultivation the great plants that stand like a\r\ngolden-helmeted phalanx in every old-fashioned garden at the\r\nNorth. Many birds, especially those of the sparrow and finch\r\ntribe, come to feast on the oily seeds; and where is there a more\r\ncharming sight than when a family of goldfinches settle upon the\r\nhuge, top-heavy heads, unconsciously forming a study in sepia and\r\ngold?\r\n\r\nOn prairies west of Pennsylvania to South Dakota, Missouri, and\r\nTexas, the SAW-TOOTH SUNFLOWER (H. grosse-serratus) is common.\r\nDeep yellow instead of pale rays around a yellowish disk\r\notherwise resemble the tall sunflower's heads in appearance as in\r\nseason of bloom. The smooth stalk, with a bluish-hoary bloom on\r\nits surface, may have hairs on the branches only. Long,\r\nlance-shaped, pointed leaves, the edges of lower ones especially\r\nsharply saw-toothed, their upper surface rough, and underneath\r\nsoft-hairy, are on slender, short petioles, the lower ones\r\nopposite, the upper ones alternate. Honeybees find abundant\r\nrefreshment in the tubular disk florets in which many of their\r\ntribe may be caught sucking; brilliant little Syrphidae, the\r\nBombilius cheat, and other flies come after pollen; butterflies\r\nfeast here on nectar, too and greedy beetles, out for pollen,\r\noften gnaw the disks with their pinchers.\r\n\r\nVery common in dry woodlands and in roadside thickets from\r\nOntario to Florida, and westward to Nebraska, is the ROUGH OR\r\nWOODLAND SUNFLOWER (H. divaricatus). Its stem, which is smooth\r\nnearly to the summit, does not often exceed three feet in height,\r\nthough it may be less, or twice as high. Usually all its\r\nwide-spread leaves are opposite, sessile, lance-shaped to ovate,\r\nslightly toothed, and rough on their upper surface. Few or\r\nsolitary flower-heads, about two inches across, have from eight\r\nto fifteen rays round a yellow disk.\r\n\r\nThe THIN-LEAVED or TEN-PETALLED SUNFLOWER (H. decapetalus), on\r\nthe contrary, chooses to dwell in moist woods and thickets,\r\nbeside streams, no farther west than Michigan and Kentucky. Its\r\nsmooth, branching stem may be anywhere from one foot to five feet\r\ntall; its thin, membranous, sharply saw-edged leaves, from ovate\r\nto lance-shaped, with a rounded base, roughest above and soft\r\nunderneath, are commonly alternate toward the summit, while the\r\nlower ones, on slender petioles, are opposite. There are by no\r\nmeans always ten yellow rays around the yellow disks produced in\r\nAugust and September; there may be any number from eight to\r\nfifteen, although this free-flowering species, like the\r\nPALE-LEAVED WOOD SUNFLOWER (H. strumosus), an earlier bloomer,\r\noften arranges its \"petals\" in tens.\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM ARTICHOKE, EARTH APPLE, CANADA POTATO, GIRASOLE (H.\r\ntuberosus), often called WILD SUNFLOWER, too, has an interesting\r\nhistory similar to the dark-centered, common garden sunflower's.\r\nIn a musty old tome printed in 1649, and entitled \"A Perfect\r\nDescription of Virginia,\" we read that the English planters had\r\n\"rootes of several kindes, Potatoes, Sparagus, Carrets and\r\nHartichokes\" - not the first mention of the artichoke by\r\nAnglo-Americans. Long before their day the Indians, who taught\r\nthem its uses, had cultivated it; and wherever we see the bright\r\nyellow flowers gleaming like miniature suns above roadside\r\nthickets and fence rows in the East, we may safely infer the spot\r\nwas once an aboriginal or colonial farm. White men planted it\r\nextensively for its edible tubers, which taste not unlike celery\r\nroot or salsify. As early as 1617 the artichoke was introduced\r\ninto Europe, and only twelve years later Parkinson records that\r\nthe roots had become very plentiful and cheap in London. The\r\nItalians also cultivated it under the name Girasole Articocco\r\n(sunflower artichoke), but it did not take long for the girasole\r\nto become corrupted into Jerusalem, hence the name Jerusalem\r\nArtichoke common to this day. When the greater value of the\r\npotato came to be generally recognized, the use of artichoke\r\nroots gradually diminished. Quite different from this sunflower\r\nis the true artichoke (Cynara Scolymus), a native of Southern\r\nEurope, whose large, unopened flower-heads offer a tiny edible\r\nmorsel at the base of each petal-like part.\r\n\r\nThe Jerusalem artichoke sends up from its thickened, fleshy,\r\ntuber-bearing rootstock, hairy, branching stems six to twelve\r\nfeet high. Especially are the flower-stalks rough, partly to\r\ndiscourage pilfering crawlers. The firm, oblong leaves, taper\r\npointed at the apex and saw-edged, are rough above, the lower\r\nleaves opposite each other on petioles, the upper alternate. The\r\nbrilliant flower-heads, which are produced freely in September\r\nand October, defying frost, are about two or three inches across,\r\nand consist of from twelve to twenty lively yellow rays around a\r\ndull yellow disk. The towering prolific plant prefers moist but\r\nnot wet soil from Georgia and Arkansas northward to New Brunswick\r\nand the Northwest Territory. Omnivorous small boys are not always\r\nparticular about boiling, not to say washing, the roots before\r\neating them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANCE-LEAVED TICKSEED; GOLDEN COREOPSIS\r\n  (Coreopsis lanceolata)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlowers-heads - Showy, bright golden yellow, the 6 to io\r\nwedge-shaped, coarsely toothed ray florets around yellowish disk\r\nflorets soon turning brown; each head on a very long, smooth,\r\nslender footstalk. Stems. 1 to 2 ft. high, tufted. Leaves: A few\r\nseated on stem, lance-shaped to narrowly oblong; or lower ones\r\ncrowded, spatulate, on slender petioles.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Open, sunny places, moist or dry.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Western Ontario to Missouri and the Gulf States;\r\nescaped from gardens in the East.\r\n\r\nGlorious masses of this prolific bloomer persistently outshine\r\nall rivals in the garden beds throughout the summer. Cut as many\r\nslender-stalked flowers and buds as you will for vases indoors,\r\ncut them by armfuls, and two more soon appear for every one\r\ntaken. From seeds scattered by the wind over a dry, sandy field\r\nadjoining a Long Island garden one autumn, myriads of these\r\nflowers swarmed like yellow butterflies the next season. Very\r\nslight encouragement induces this coreopsis to run wild in the\r\nEast. Grandiflora, with pinnately parted narrow leaves and\r\nsimilar flowers, a Southwestern species, is frequently a runaway.\r\nBees and flies, attracted by the showy neutral rays which are\r\nborne solely for advertising purposes, unwittingly\r\ncross-fertilize the heads as they crawl over the tiny, tubular,\r\nperfect florets massed together in the central disk; for some of\r\nthese florets having the pollen pushed upward by hair brushes and\r\nexposed for the visitor's benefit, while others have their sticky\r\nstyle branches spread to receive any vitalizing dust brought to\r\nthem, it follows that quantities of vigorous seed must be set.\r\n\r\n\"There is a natural rotation of crops, as yet little understood,\"\r\nsays Miss Going. \"Where a pine forest has been cleared away, oaks\r\ncome up; and a botanist can tell beforehand just what flowers\r\nwill appear in the clearings of pine woods. In northern Ohio,\r\nwhen a piece of forestland is cleared, a particular sort of grass\r\nappears. When that is ploughed under, a growth of the golden\r\ncoreopsis comes up, and the pretty yellow blossoms are followed\r\nin their turn by the plebeian rag-weed which takes possession of\r\nthe entire field.\"\r\n\r\nThe charmingly delicate, wiry GARDEN TICKSEED, known in\r\nseedsmen's catalogues as CALLIOPSIS (Coreopsis tinctoria), which\r\nhas also locally escaped to roadsides and waste places eastward,\r\nis at home in moist, rich soil from Louisiana, Arizona, and\r\nNebraska northward into Minnesota and the British Possessions.\r\n>From May to September its fine, slender, low-growing stems are\r\ncrowned with small yellow composite flowers whose rays are\r\nvelvety maroon or brown at the base. (Coreopsis = like a bug,\r\nfrom the shape of the seeds.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGER or SMOOTH BUR-MARIGOLD; BROOK SUNFLOWER\r\n  (Bidens laevis; B. chrysanthemoides of Gray)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Showy golden yellow, 1 to 2 1/2 in. across,\r\nnumerous, on short peduncles; 8 to 10 neutral rays around a dingy\r\nyellowish or brown disk of tubular, perfect, fertile florets.\r\nStem: 1 to 2 ft. high. Leaves: Opposite, sessile, lance-shaped,\r\nregularly saw-toothed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet ground, swamps, ditches, meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - August-November.\r\nDistribution - Quebec and Minnesota, southward to the Gulf States\r\nand Lower California.\r\n\r\nNext of kin to the golden coreopsis, it behooves some of the\r\nbur-marigolds to redeem their clan's reputation for ugliness and\r\ncertainly the brook sunflower is a not unworthy relative. How gay\r\nthe ditches and low meadows are with its bright, generous bloom\r\nin late summer, and until even the goldenrod wands turn brown!\r\nYet all this show is expended merely for advertising purposes.\r\nThe golden ray florets, sacrificing their fertility to the\r\ngeneral welfare of the cooperative community, which each\r\nflower-head is in reality, have grown conspicuous to attract bees\r\nand wasps, butterflies, flies, and some beetles to the dingy mass\r\nof tubular florets in the center, in which nectar is concealed,\r\nwhile pollen is exposed for the visitors to transfer as they\r\ncrawl. The rays simply make a show; within the minute,\r\ninsignificant looking tubes is transacted the important business\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nLater in the season, when the bur-marigolds are transformed into\r\narmories bristling with rusty, two-pronged, and finely-barbed\r\npitchforks (Bidens = two teeth), our real quarrel with the tribe\r\nbegins. The innocent passerby - man, woman, or child, woolly\r\nsheep, cattle with switching tails, hairy dogs or foxes, indeed,\r\nany creature within reach of the vicious grappling-hooks - must\r\ntransport them on his clothing; for it is thus that these tramps\r\nhave planned to get away from the parent plant in the hope of\r\nbeing picked off, and the seeds dropped in fresh colonizing\r\nground; travelling in the disreputable company of their kinsmen\r\nthe beggar-ticks and Spanish needles, the burdock burs, cleavers,\r\nagrimony, and tick-trefoils.\r\n\r\nBEGGAR-TICKS, STICK-TIGHT, RAYLESS MARIGOLD, BEGGAR-LICE,\r\nPITCHFORKS, or STICK-SEED (B. frondosa) sufficiently explains its\r\njustly defamed character in its popular names. Numerous dull,\r\ndark, tawny orange flower-heads without, rays, or with\r\ninsignificant ones scarcely to be detected, and surrounded by\r\ntaller leaf-like bracts, add little to the beauty of the moist\r\nfields and roadsides where they rear themselves on long peduncles\r\nfrom July to October. The smooth, erect, branched, and often\r\nreddish, stem may be anywhere from two to nine feet tall. Usually\r\nthe upper leaves are not divided, but the lower ones are\r\npinnately compounded of three to five divisions, the segments\r\nlance-shaped or broader, and sharply toothed. As in all the\r\nbur-marigolds, we find each floret's calyx converted into a\r\nbarbed implement - javelin, pitchfork, or halberd - for grappling\r\nthe clothing of the first innocent victim unwittingly acting as a\r\ncolonizing agent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNEEZEWEED; SWAMP SUNFLOWER\r\n  (Helenium autumnale)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Bright yellow, to 2 in. across, numerous, borne on\r\nlong peduncles in corymb-like clusters; the rays 3 to 5 cleft,\r\nand drooping around the yellow or yellowish-brown disk. Stem: 2\r\nto 6 ft. tall, branched above. Leaves: Alternate, firm,\r\nlance-shaped to oblong, toothed, seated on stem or the bases\r\nslightly decurrent; bitter.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, wet ground, banks of streams.\r\nFlowering Season - August-October.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to the Northwest Territory; southward to\r\nFlorida and Arizona.\r\n\r\nSeptember, which also brings out lively masses of the swamp\r\nsunflower in the low-lying meadows, was appropriately called our\r\ngolden month by an English traveler who saw for the first time\r\nthe wonderful yellows in our autumn foliage, the surging seas of\r\ngoldenrod; the tall, showy sunflowers, ox-eyes, rudbeckias,\r\nmarigolds, and all the other glorious composites in Nature's\r\ngarden, as in men's, which copy the sun's resplendent disk and\r\nrays to brighten with one final dazzling outburst the somber face\r\nof the dying year.\r\n\r\nTo the swamp sunflowers honey-bees hasten for both nectar and\r\npollen, velvety bumblebees suck the sweets, leaf-cutter and mason\r\nbees, wasps, some butterflies, flies, and beetles visit them\r\ndaily, for the round disks mature their perfect fertile florets\r\nin succession. Since the drooping ray flowers, which are\r\npistillate only, are fertile too, there is no scarcity of seed\r\nset, much to the farmer's dismay. Most cows know enough to\r\nrespect the bitter leaves' desire to be let alone; but many a\r\npail of milk has been spoiled by a mouthful of Helenium among the\r\nherbage. Whoever cares to learn from experience why this was\r\ncalled the sneezeweed, must take a whiff of snuff made of the\r\ndried and powdered leaves.\r\n\r\nThe PURPLE-HEAD SNEEZEWEED (H. nudiflorum), its yellow rays\r\nsometimes wanting, occurs in the South and West.\r\n\r\n\r\nTANSY; BITTER-BUTTONS\r\n  (Tanacetum vulgare)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Small, round, of tubular florets only, packed\r\nwithin a depressed involucre, and borne, in flat-topped corymbs.\r\nStem: 1 1/2 to 3 ft. tall, leafy. Leaves: Deeply and pinnately\r\ncleft into narrow, toothed divisions; strong scented.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Roadsides; commonly escaped from gardens.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia, westward to Minnesota, south to\r\nMissouri and North Carolina. Naturalized from Europe.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring time, are made with the leaves hereof newly sprung\r\nup, and with eggs, cakes or Tansies which be pleasant in taste\r\nand goode for the Stomache,\" wrote quaint old Gerarde. That these\r\nwere popular dainties in the seventeenth century we further know\r\nthrough Pepys, who made a \"pretty dinner\" for some guests, to\r\nwit: \"A brace of stewed carps, six roasted chickens, and a jowl\r\nof salmon, hot, for the first course; a tansy, and two neat's\r\ntongues, and cheese, the second.\" Cole's \"Art of Simpling,\"\r\npublished in 1656, assures maidens that tansy leaves laid to soak\r\nin buttermilk for nine days \"maketh the complexion very fair.\"\r\nTansy tea, in short, cured every ill that flesh is heir to,\r\naccording to the simple faith of mediaeval herbalists - a faith\r\nsurviving in some old women even to this day. The name is said to\r\nbe a corruption of athanasia, derived from two Greek words\r\nmeaning immortality. When some monks in reading Lucian came\r\nacross the passage where Jove, speaking of Ganymede to Mercury,\r\nsays, \"Take him hence, and when he has tasted immortality let him\r\nreturn to us,\" their literal minds inferred that this plant must\r\nhave been what Ganymede tasted, hence they named it athanasia! So\r\ngreat credence having been given to its medicinal powers in\r\nEurope, it is not strange the colonists felt they could not live\r\nin the New World without tansy. Strong-scented pungent tufts\r\ntopped with bright yellow buttons - runaways from old gardens -\r\nare a conspicuous feature along many a roadside leading to\r\ncolonial homesteads.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLDEN RAGWORT; GROUNDSEL; SQUAW-WEED\r\n  (Senecio aureus)  Thistle family\r\n\r\nFlower-heads - Golden yellow, about 3/4 in. across, borne on\r\nslender peduncles in a loose, leafless cluster; rays 8 to 12\r\naround minute disk florets. Stem: Slender, 1 to 2 1/2 ft. high,\r\nsolitary or tufted, from a strong-scented root. Leaves: From the\r\nroot, on long petioles, rounded or heart-shaped, scalloped-edged,\r\noften purplish; stem leaves variable, lance-shaped or lyrate,\r\ndeeply cut, sessile.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, wet ground, meadows.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Gulf States northward to Missouri, Ontario, and\r\nNewfoundland.\r\n\r\nWhile the aster clan is the largest we have in North America,\r\nthis genus Senecio is really the most numerous branch of the\r\ngreat composite tribe, numbering as it does nearly a thousand\r\nspecies, represented in all quarters of the earth. It is said to\r\ntake its name from senex = an old man, in reference to the white\r\nhairs on many species; or, more likely, to the silky pappus that\r\nsoon makes the fertile disks hoary headed. \"I see the downy heads\r\nof the senecio gone to seed, thistle like but small,\" wrote\r\nThoreau in his journal under date of July 2nd, when only the\r\npussy-toes everlasting could have plumed its seeds for flight\r\nover the dry uplands in a similar fashion. Innumerable as the\r\nyellow, daisy-like composites are, most of them appear in late\r\nsummer or autumn, and so the novice should have little difficulty\r\nin naming these loosely clustered, bright, early blooming small\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED AND INDEFINITES\r\n\r\n\"I want the inner meaning and the understanding of the\r\nwildflowers in the meadow. Why are they? What end? What purpose?\r\nThe plant knows, and sees, and feels; where is its mind when the\r\npetal falls?

' - Richard Jeffries.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK-IN-THE-PULPIT; INDIAN TURNIP\r\n  (Arisaema triphyllum)  Arum family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Minute, greenish yellow, clustered on the lower part of\r\na smooth, club-shaped, slender spadix within a green and maroon\r\nor whitish-striped spathe that curves in a broad-pointed flap\r\nabove it. Leaves: 3-foliate, usually overtopping the spathe,\r\ntheir slender petioles 9 to 30 in. high, or as tall as the scape\r\nthat rises from an acrid corm. Fruit: Smooth, shining red berries\r\nclustered on the thickened club.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woodland and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia westward to Minnesota, and southward\r\nto the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nA jolly looking preacher is Jack, standing erect in his\r\nparticolored pulpit with a sounding-board over his head; but he\r\nis a gay deceiver, a wolf in sheep's clothing,, literally a\r\n\"brother to dragons,\" an arrant upstart, an ingrate, a murderer\r\nof innocent benefactors! \"Female botanizing classes pounce upon\r\nit as they would upon a pious young clergyman,\" complains Mr.\r\nEllwanger. A poor relation of the stately calla lily one knows\r\nJack to be at a glance, her lovely white robe corresponding to\r\nhis striped pulpit, her bright yellow spadix to his sleek\r\nreverence. In the damp woodlands where his pulpit is erected\r\nbeneath leafy cathedral arches, minute flies or gnats, recently\r\nemerged from maggots in mushrooms, toadstools, or decaying logs,\r\nform the main part of his congregation.\r\n\r\nNow, to drop the clerical simile, let us peep within the\r\nsheathing spathe, or, better still, strip it off altogether. Dr.\r\nTorrey states that the dark-striped spathes are the fertile\r\nplants, those with green and whitish lines, sterile. Within are\r\nsmooth, glossy columns, and near the base of each we shall find\r\nthe true flowers, minute affairs, some staminate; others, on\r\ndistinct plants, pistillate, the berry bearers; or rarely both\r\nmale and female florets seated on the same club, as if Jack's\r\nelaborate plan to prevent self-fertilization were not yet\r\ncomplete. Plants may be detected in process of evolution toward\r\ntheir ideals: just as nations and men are. Doubtless, when Jack's\r\nmechanism is perfected, his guilt will disappear. A little way\r\nabove the florets the club enlarges abruptly, forming a\r\nprojecting ledge that effectually closes the avenue of escape for\r\nmany a guileless victim. A fungus gnat, enticed perhaps by the\r\nstriped house of refuge from cold spring winds, and with a\r\nprospect of food below, enters and slides down the inside walls\r\nor the slippery colored column: in either case descent is very\r\neasy; it is the return that is made so difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, for the tiny visitors. Squeezing past the projecting\r\nledge, the gnat finds himself in a roomy apartment whose floor -\r\nthe bottom of the pulpit - is dusted over with fine pollen; that\r\nis, if he is among staminate flowers already mature. To get some\r\nof that pollen, with which the gnat presently covers himself,\r\ntransferred to the minute pistillate florets waiting for it in a\r\ndistant chamber is, of course, Jack's whole aim in enticing\r\nvisitors within his polished walls; but what means are provided\r\nfor their escape? Their efforts to crawl upward over the slippery\r\nsurface only land them weak and discouraged where they started.\r\nThe projecting ledge overhead prevents them from using their\r\nwings; the passage between the ledge and the spathe is far too\r\nnarrow to permit flight. Now, if a gnat be persevering, he will\r\npresently discover a gap in the flap where the spathe folds\r\ntogether in front, and through this tiny opening he makes his\r\nescape, only to enter another pulpit, like the trusted, but too\r\ntrusting, messenger he is, and leave some of the vitalizing\r\npollen on the fertile florets awaiting his coming.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the fly, small as he is, is too large to work his way\r\nout through the flap, or too bewildered or stupid to find the\r\nopening, or too exhausted after his futile efforts to get out\r\nthrough the overhead route to persevere, or too weak with hunger\r\nin case of long detention in a pistillate trap where no pollen\r\nis, what then? Open a dozen of Jack's pulpits, and in several, at\r\nleast, dead victims will be found - pathetic little corpses\r\nsacrificed to the imperfection of his executive system. Had the\r\nflies entered mature spathes, whose walls had spread outward and\r\naway from the polished column, flight through the overhead route\r\nmight have been possible. However glad we may be to make every\r\ndue allowance for this sacrifice of the higher life to the lower,\r\nas only a temporary imperfection of mechanism incidental to the\r\nplant's higher development, Jacks present cruelty shocks us no\r\nless. Or, it may be, he will become insectivorous like the\r\npitcher plant in time. He comes from a rascally family, anyhow.\r\n(See cuckoo pint.)\r\n\r\nIn June and July the thick-set club, studded over with bright\r\nberries, becomes conspicuous, to attract hungry woodland rovers\r\nin the hope that the seeds will be dropped far from the parent\r\nplant. The Indians used to boil the berries for food. The\r\nfarinaceous root (corm) they likewise boiled or dried to extract\r\nthe stinging, blistering juice, leaving an edible little\r\n\"turnip,\" however insipid and starchy.\r\n\r\nThe GREEN DRAGON, or DRAGON-ROOT (A. Dracontium), to which Jack\r\nis brother, is found in similar situations or beside streams in\r\nwet, shady ground, and sends up a narrow greenish or whitish\r\ntapering spathe, one or two inches long, enwrapping a slender,\r\npointed spadix, that projects sometimes seven inches beyond its\r\ntip. Within, tiny pistillate florets are seated around the base,\r\nwhile on the staminate plants the inflorescence extends higher. A\r\nlarge, solitary, dark green leaf, divided into from five to\r\nseventeen oblong, pointed segments, spreads above. Large ovoid\r\nheads of reddish-orange berries are the plant's most conspicuous\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKUNK OR SWAMP CABBAGE\r\n  (Spathyema fetida; Symplocarpus fetidus of Gray)  Arum family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Minute, perfect, fetid; many scattered over a thick,\r\nrounded, fleshy spadix, and hidden within a swollen,\r\nshell-shaped, purplish-brown to greenish-yellow, usually mottled,\r\nspathe, close to the ground, that appears before the leaves.\r\nSpadix much enlarged and spongy in fruit, the bulb-like berries\r\nimbedded in its surface. Leaves: In large crowns like cabbages,\r\nbroadly ovate, often 1 ft. across, strongly nerved, their\r\npetioles with deep grooves, malodorous.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Swamps, wet ground.\r\nFlowering Season - February-April.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, and westward to Minnesota\r\nand Iowa.\r\n\r\nThis despised relative of the stately calla lily proclaims spring\r\nin the very teeth of winter, being the first bold adventurer\r\nabove ground. When the lovely hepatica, the first flower worthy\r\nthe name to appear, is still wrapped in her fuzzy furs, the skunk\r\ncabbage's dark incurved horn shelters within its hollow, tiny,\r\nmalodorous florets. Why is the entire plant so fetid that one\r\nflees the neighborhood, pervaded as it is with an odor that\r\ncombines a suspicion of skunk, putrid meat, and garlic? After\r\ninvestigating the carrion-flower (q.v.) and the purple trillium,\r\namong others, we learned that certain flies delight in foul odors\r\nloathsome to higher organisms; that plants dependent on these\r\npollen carriers woo them from long distances with a stench, and\r\nin addition sometimes try to charm them with color resembling the\r\nsort of meat it is their special mission, with the help of\r\nbeetles and other scavengers of Nature, to remove from the face\r\nof the earth. In such marshy ground as the skunk cabbage lives\r\nin, many small flies and gnats live in embryo under the fallen\r\nleaves during the winter. But even before they are warmed into\r\nactive life, the hive-bees, natives of Europe, and with habits\r\nnot perfectly adapted as yet to our flora (nor our flora's habits\r\nto theirs - see milkweed), are out after pollen. Where would they\r\nfind any so early, if not within the skunk cabbage's livid horn\r\nof plenty? Not even an alder catkin or a pussy willow has\r\nexpanded yet. In spite of the bee's refined taste in the matter\r\nof perfume and color, she has no choice, now, but to enter so\r\ngenerous an entertainer. At the top of the thick rounded spadix\r\nwithin, the skunk cabbage florets there first mature their\r\nstigmas, and pollen must therefore be carried to them on the\r\nbodies of visitors. Later these stigmas wither, and abundant\r\npollen is shed from the now ripe anthers. Meantime the lower,\r\nyounger florets having matured their stigmas, some pollen may\r\nfall directly on them from the older flowers above. A bee\r\ncrawling back and forth over the spadix gets thoroughly dusted,\r\nand flying off to another cluster of florets cross-fertilizes\r\nthem - that is, if all goes well. But because the honeybee never\r\nentered the skunk cabbage's calculations, useful as the immigrant\r\nproved to be, the horn that was manifestly designed for smaller\r\nflies often proves a fatal trap. Occasionally a bee finds the\r\nentrance she has managed to squeeze through too narrow and\r\nslippery for an exit, and she perishes miserably.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of weeks after finding the first bee,\" says Mr. William\r\nTrelease in the \"American Naturalist,\" \"the spathes will be found\r\nswarming with the minute black flies that were sought in vain\r\nearlier in the season, and their number is attested not only by\r\nthe hundreds of them which can be seen, but also by the many\r\nsmall but very fat spiders whose webs bar the entrance to\r\nthree-fourths of the spathes. During the present spring a few\r\nspecimens of a small scavenger beetle have been captured within\r\nthe spathes of this plant.... Finally, other and more attractive\r\nflowers opening, the bees appear to cease visiting those of this\r\nspecies, and countless small flies take their place, compensating\r\nfor their small size by their great numbers.\" These, of course,\r\nare the benefactors the skunk cabbage catered to ages before the\r\nhoneybee reached our shores.\r\n\r\nAfter the flowering time come the vivid green crowns of leaves\r\nthat at least please the eye. Lizards make their home beneath\r\nthem, and many a yellowthroat, taking advantage of the plant's\r\nfoul odor, gladly puts up with it herself and builds her nest in\r\nthe hollow of the cabbage as a protection for her eggs and young\r\nfrom four-footed enemies. Cattle let the plant alone because of\r\nthe stinging, acrid juices secreted by it, although such tender,\r\nfresh, bright foliage must be especially tempting, like the\r\nhellebore's, after a dry winter diet. Sometimes tiny insects are\r\nfound drowned in the wells of rain water that accumulate at the\r\nbase of the grooved leafstalks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED, WOOD, FLAME, or PHILADELPHIA LILY\r\n  (Lilium Philadelphicum)  Lily family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Erect, tawny or red-tinted outside; vermilion, or\r\nsometimes reddish orange, and spotted with madder brown within; 1\r\nto 5, on separate peduncles, borne at the summit. Perianth of 6\r\ndistinct, spreading, spatulate segments, each narrowed into a\r\nclaw, and with a nectar groove at its base; 6 stamens; 1 style,\r\nthe club-shaped stigma 3-lobed. Stem: 1 to 3 ft. tall, from a\r\nbulb composed of narrow, jointed, fleshy scales. Leaves: In\r\nwhorls of 3's to 8's, lance-shaped, seated at intervals on the\r\nstem.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry woods, sandy soil, borders, and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - June-July.\r\nDistribution - Northern border of United States, westward to\r\nOntario, south to the Carolinas and West Virginia.\r\n\r\nErect, as if conscious of its striking beauty, this vivid lily\r\nlifts a chalice that suggests a trap for catching sunbeams from\r\nfiery old Sol. Defiant of his scorching rays in its dry habitat,\r\nit neither nods nor droops even during prolonged drought; and vet\r\nmany people confuse it with the gracefully pendent, swaying bells\r\nof the yellow Canada lily, which will grow in a swamp rather than\r\nforego moisture. Li, the Celtic for white, from which the family\r\nderived its name, makes this bright-hued flower blush to own it.\r\nSeedmen, who export quantities of our superb native lilies to\r\nEurope, supply bulbs so cheap that no one should wait four years\r\nfor flowers from seed, or go without their splendor in our\r\nover-conventional gardens. Why this early lily is radiantly\r\ncolored and speckled is told in the description of the Canada\r\nlily (q.v.).\r\n\r\nThe WESTERN RED LILY (L. umbellatum), that takes the place of the\r\nPhiladelphia species from Ohio, Minnesota, and the Northwest\r\nTerritory, southward to Missouri, Arkansas, and Colorado, lifts\r\nsimilar but smaller red, orange, or yellow flowers on a more\r\nslender stem, two feet high or less, set with narrow, linear,\r\nalternate leaves, or perhaps the upper ones in whorls. It blooms\r\nin June or July, in dry soil, preferably in open, sandy\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE CORAL-ROOT\r\n  (Corallorhiza multiflora)  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull brownish purple, about 1/2 in. high; 10 to 30\r\nborne in a raceme 2 to 8 in. long. Petals about the length of\r\nsepals, and somewhat united at the base; spur yellowish, the oval\r\nlip white, spotted and lined with purplish; 3-lobed, wavy edged.\r\nScape, 8 to 20 in. tall, colored, furnished with several flat\r\nscales. Leaves: None. Root: A branching, coral-like mass.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry woods.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia, westward to British Columbia; south\r\nto Florida, Missouri, and California.\r\n\r\nTo the majority of people the very word orchid suggests a\r\nmillionaire's hothouse, or some fashionable florist's show\r\nwindow, where tropical air plants send forth gorgeous blossoms,\r\nexquisite in color, marvelous in form; so that when this\r\ninsignificant little stalk pokes its way through the soil at\r\nmidsummer and produces some dull flowers of indefinite shades and\r\nno leaves at all to help make them attractive, one feels that the\r\ncoral-root is a very poor relation of theirs indeed. The prettily\r\nmarked lower lip, at once a platform and nectar guide to the\r\ninsect alighting on it, is all that suggests ambition worthy of\r\nan orchid.\r\n\r\nIf poverty of men and nations can be traced to certain radical\r\ncauses by the social economist, just as surely can the botanist\r\naccount for loss of leaves - riches - by closely examining the\r\npoverty-stricken plant. Every phenomenon has its explanation. A\r\nglance at the extraordinary formation under ground reveals the\r\nfact that the coral-roots, although related to the most\r\naristocratic and highly organized plants in existence, have\r\nstooped to become ghoulish saprophytes. An honest herb abounds in\r\ngood green coloring matter (chlorophyll), that serves as a light\r\nscreen to the cellular juices of leaf and stem. It also forms\r\npart of its digestive apparatus, aiding a plant in the\r\nmanufacture of its own food out of the soil, water, and gases;\r\nwhereas a plant that lives by piracy - a parasite - or a\r\nsaprophyte, that sucks up the already assimilated products of\r\nanother's decay, loses its useless chlorophyll as surely as if it\r\nhad been kept in a cellar. In time its equally useless leaves\r\ndwindle to bracts, or disappear. Nature wastes no energy. Fungi,\r\nfor example, are both parasites and saprophytes; and so when\r\nplants far higher up in the evolutionary scale than they lose\r\nleaves and green color too, we may know they are degenerates\r\nbelonging to that disreputable gang of branded sinners which\r\nincludes the Indian-pipe, broom-rape, dodder, pine-sap, and\r\nbeech-drops. Others, like the gerardias and foxgloves, may even\r\nnow be detected on the brink of a fall from grace.\r\n\r\nThe EARLY CORAL-ROOT (C. Corallorhiza; C. innata of Gray)\r\n - a similar but smaller species, whose loose spike of dull\r\npurplish flowers likewise terminates a scaly purplish or\r\nyellowish scape arising from a mass of short, thick, whitish,\r\nfleshy, blunt fibers, may be found in the moist woods blooming in\r\nMay or June. It has a more northerly range, however, extending\r\nfrom the mountains of Georgia, it is true, but chiefly from the\r\nnorthern boundary of the United States, from New England westward\r\nto the State of Washington, and northward to Nova Scotia and\r\nAlaska.\r\n\r\n\r\nADAM AND EVE; PUTTY-ROOT\r\n  (Aplectrum spicatum; A. hyemale of Gray))  Orchid family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dingy yellowish brown and purplish, about 1 in. long,\r\neach on a short pedicel, in a few-flowered, loose, bracted raceme\r\n2 to 4 in. long. No spur; sepals and petals similar, small and\r\nnarrow, the lip wavy-edged. Scape: to 2 ft. high, smooth, with\r\nabout 3 sheathing scales. Leaf: Solitary, rising from the corm in\r\nautumn, elliptic, broad, plaited-nerved, 4 to 6 in. long. Root: A\r\ncorm usually attached to one of the preceding season.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist woods or swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Georgia, Missouri, and California northward, into\r\nBritish Possessions.\r\n\r\nMore curious than beautiful is this small orchid whose dingy\r\nflowers of indefinite color and without spurs interest us far\r\nless than the two corms barely hidden below ground. These\r\nsingular solid bulbs, about an inch thick, are connected by a\r\nslender stalk, suggesting to the imaginative person who named the\r\nplant our first parents standing hand in hand in the Garden of\r\nEden.\r\n\r\nBut usually several old corms - not always two, by any means -\r\nremain attached to the nearest one, a bulb being produced each\r\nyear until Cain and Abel often join Adam and Eve to make up quite\r\na family group. A strong, glutinous matter within the corms has\r\nbeen used as a cement, hence the plant's other popular name. From\r\nthe newest bulb added, a solitary large leaf arises in late\r\nsummer or autumn, to remain all winter. The flower stalk comes up\r\nat one side of it the following spring. Meantime the old corms\r\nretain their life, apparently to help nourish the young one still\r\njoined to them, while its system is taxed with flowering.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD GINGER; CANADA SNAKEROOT; ASARABACCA\r\n  (Asarum Canadense)  Birthwort family\r\n\r\nFlower - Solitary, dull purplish brown, creamy white within,\r\nabout 1 in. broad when expanded, borne on a short peduncle close\r\nto or upon the ground. Calyx cup-shaped, deeply cleft, its 3\r\nacutely pointed lobes spreading, curved; corolla wanting; 12\r\nshort, stout stamens inserted on ovary; the thick style 6-lobed,\r\nits stigmas radiating on the lobes. Leaves: A single pair, dark\r\ngreen, reniform, 4 to 7 in. broad, on downy petioles 6 to 12 in.\r\nhigh, from a creeping, thick, aromatic, pungent rootstock.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods; hillsides.\r\nFlowering Season - March-May.\r\nDistribution - North Carolina, Missouri, and Kansas, northward,\r\nto New Brunswick and Manitoba.\r\n\r\nLike the wicked servant who buried the one talent entrusted to\r\nhis care, the wild ginger hides its solitary flower if not\r\nactually under the dry leaves that clothe the ground in the still\r\nleafless woodlands, then not far above them. Why? When most\r\nplants flaunt their showy blossoms aloft, where they may be seen\r\nof all, why should this one bear only one dull, firm cup,\r\ninconspicuous in color as in situation? In early spring - and it\r\nis one of the earliest flowers - gnats and small flies are\r\nwarming into active life from the maggots that have lain under\r\ndead leaves and the bark of decaying logs all winter. To such\r\nguests a flower need offer few attractions to secure them in\r\nswarms. Bright, beautiful colors, sweet fragrance, luscious\r\nnectar, with which the highly specialized bees, butterflies, and\r\nmoths are wooed, would all be lost on them, lacking as they do\r\nesthetic taste. For flies, a snug shelter from cold spring winds\r\nsuch as Jack-in-the-pulpit, the marsh calla, the pitcher-plant,\r\nor the skunk cabbage offers; sometimes a fetid odor like the\r\nlatter's, or dull purplish red or brownish color resembling stale\r\nmeat, which the purple trillium likewise wears as an additional\r\nattraction, are necessary when certain carrion flies must be\r\ncatered to; and, above all, an abundance of pollen for food -\r\nwith any or all of these seductions a flower dependent on flies\r\nhas nothing to fear from neglect. Therefore the wild ginger does\r\nnot even attempt to fertilize itself. Within the cozy cup one can\r\nusually find a contented fly seeking shelter or food. Close to\r\nthe ground it is warm and less windy. When the cup first opens,\r\nonly the stigmas are mature and sticky to receive any pollen the\r\nvisitors may bring in on their bodies from other asylums where\r\nthey have been hiding. These stigmas presently withering, up rise\r\nthe twelve stamens beside them to dust with pollen the flies\r\ncoming in search of it. Only one flower from a root compels\r\ncross-fertilizing between flowers of distinct plants - a means to\r\ninsure the most vigorous seed, as Darwin proved. Evidently the\r\nginger is striving to attain some day the ambitious mechanism for\r\ntemporarily imprisoning its guests that its cousin the Dutchman's\r\npipe has perfected. After fertilization the cup nods, inverted,\r\nand the leathery capsule following it bursts irregularly,\r\ndischarging many seeds.\r\n\r\nNo ruminant will touch the leaves, owing to their bitter juices,\r\nnor will a grub or nibbling rodent molest the root, which bites\r\nlike ginger; nevertheless credulous mankind once utilized the\r\nplant as a tonic medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCHMAN'S PIPE; PIPE-VINE\r\n  (Aristolochia macrophylla; A. Sipho of Gray))\r\n\r\nFlower - An inflated, curved, yellowish-green, veiny tube\r\n(calyx), pipe-shaped, except that it abruptly broadens beyond the\r\ncontracted throat into 3 flat, spreading, dark purplish or\r\nreddish-brown lobes; pipe 1 to 1 1/2 in. long, borne on a long,\r\ndrooping peduncle, either solitary or 2 or 3 together, from the\r\nbracted leaf-axils; 6 anthers, without filaments, in united pairs\r\nunder the 3 lobes of the short, thick stigma. Stem: A very long,\r\ntwining vine, the branches smooth and green. Leaves: Thin,\r\nreniform to heart-shaped, slender petioled, downy underneath when\r\nyoung; 6 to 15 in. broad when mature. Fruit: An oblong, cylindric\r\ncapsule, containing quantities of seeds within its six sections.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, moist woods.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Pennsylvania, westward to Minnesota, south to\r\nGeorgia and Kansas. Escaped from cultivation further north.\r\n\r\nAfter learning why the pitcher plant, Jack-in-the-pulpit, and\r\nskunk cabbage are colored and shaped as they are, no one will be\r\nsurprised on opening this curious flower to find numbers of\r\nlittle flies within the pipe. Certain relatives of this vine\r\nproduce flowers that are not only colored like livid, putrid meat\r\naround the entrance, but also emit a fetid odor to attract\r\ncarrion flies especially. (See purple trillium.)\r\n\r\nIn May, when the pipe-vine blooms, gauzy-winged small flies and\r\ngnats gladly seek food and shelter from the wind within so\r\nattractive an asylum as the curving tube offers. They enter\r\neasily enough through the narrow throat, around which fine hairs\r\npoint downward - an entrance resembling an eel trap's. Any pollen\r\nthey may bring in on their bodies now rubs off on the sticky\r\nstigma lobes, already matured at the bottom of a newly opened\r\nflower, in which they buzz, crawl, slide, and slip, seeking an\r\navenue of escape. None presents itself: they are imprisoned. The\r\nhairs at the entrance, approached from within, form an\r\nimpenetrable stockade. Must the poor little creatures perish? Is\r\nthe flower heartless enough to murder its benefactors, on which\r\nthe continuance of its species depends? By no means is it so\r\nshortsighted! A few tiny drops of nectar exuding from the center\r\ntable prevent the visitors from starving. Presently the\r\nfertilized stigmas wither, and when they have safely escaped the\r\ndanger of self-fertilization, the pollen hidden under their lobes\r\nripens and dusts afresh the little flies so impatiently awaiting\r\nthe feast. Now, and not till now, it is to the advantage of the\r\nspecies that the prisoners be released, that they may carry the\r\nvitalizing dust to stigmas waiting for it in younger flowers.\r\nAccordingly, the slippery pipe begins to shrivel, thus offering a\r\nfoothold; the once stiff hairs that guarded its exit grow limp,\r\nand the happy gnats, after a generous entertainment and snug\r\nprotection, escape uninjured, and by no means unwilling to repeat\r\nthe experience. Evidently the wild ginger, belonging to a genus\r\nnext of kin, is striving to perfect a similar prison. In the\r\nlanguage of the street, the ginger flower does not yet \"work\"\r\nits.visitors \"for all they are worth.\"\r\n\r\nLater, when we see the exquisite dark, velvety, blue-green,\r\npipe-vine, swallow-tail butterfly (Papilio philenor) hovering\r\nabout verandas or woodland bowers that are shaded with the\r\npipe-vine's large leaves, we may know she is there only to lay\r\neggs that her caterpillar descendants may find themselves on\r\ntheir favorite food store.\r\n\r\nThe VIRGINIA SNAKEROOT or SERPENTARY (A. serpentaria), found in\r\ndry woods, chiefly in the Middle States and South, although its\r\nrange extends northward to Connecticut, New York, and Michigan,\r\nis the species whose aromatic root is used in medicine. It is a\r\nlow-growing herb, not a vine; its heart-shaped leaves, which are\r\nnarrow and tapering to a point, are green on both sides, and the\r\ncurious, greenish, S-shaped flower, which grows alone at the tip\r\nof a scaly footstalk from the root, appears in June or July.\r\nSometimes the flowers are cleistogamous (see violet wood-sorrel).\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE PINK; VIRGINIA CATCHFLY\r\n  (Silene Virginica)  Pink family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Scarlet or crimson, 1 1/2 in. broad or less, a few on\r\nslender pedicels from the upper leaf-axils. Calyx sticky,\r\ntubular, bell-shaped, 5-cleft, enlarged in fruit; corolla of 5\r\nwide-spread, narrow, notched petals, sometimes deeply 2-cleft; 10\r\nstamens; 3 styles. Stem: 1 to 2 ft. high; erect, slender, sticky.\r\nLeaves: Thin, spatulate, 3 to 5 in. long; or upper ones oblong to\r\nlance-shaped.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, open woodland.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Southern New Jersey to Minnesota, south to Georgia\r\nand Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe rich, glowing scarlet of these pinks that fleck the Southern\r\nwoodland as with fire, will light up our Northern rock gardens\r\ntoo, if we but sow the seed under glass in earliest spring, and\r\nset out the young plants in well-drained, open ground in May.\r\nDivision of old perennial roots causes the plants to sulk;\r\ndampness destroys them.\r\n\r\nTo the brilliant blossoms butterflies chiefly come to sip (see\r\nwild pink), and an occasional hummingbird, fascinated by the\r\ncolor that seems ever irresistible to him, hovers above them on\r\nwhirring wings. Hapless ants, starting to crawl up the stem,\r\nbecome more and more discouraged by its stickiness, and if they\r\npersevere in their attempts to steal from the butterfly's\r\nlegitimate preserves, death overtakes their erring feet as\r\nspeedily as if they ventured on sticky fly paper. How humane is\r\nthe way to protect flowers from crawling thieves that has been\r\nadopted by the high-bush cranberry and the partridge pea (q.v.),\r\namong other plants! These provide a free lunch of sweets in the\r\nglands of their leaves to satisfy pilferers, which then seek no\r\nfarther, leaving the flowers to winged insects that are at once\r\ndespoilers and benefactors.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD COLUMBINE\r\n  (Aquilegia Canadensis)  Crowfoot family\r\n\r\nFlower - Red outside, yellow within, irregular, 1 to 2 in. long,\r\nsolitary, nodding from a curved footstalk from the upper\r\nleaf-axils. Petals 5, funnel-shaped, but quickly narrowing into\r\nlong, erect, very slender hollow spurs, rounded at the tip and\r\nunited below by the 5 spreading red sepals, between which the\r\nstraight spurs ascend; numerous stamens and 5 pistils projecting.\r\nStem: 1 to 2 ft. high; branching, soft-hairy or smooth. Leaves:\r\nMore or less divided, the lobes with rounded teeth; large lower\r\ncompound leaves on long petioles. Fruit: An erect pod, each of\r\nthe 5 divisions tipped with a long, sharp beak.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rocky places, rich woodland.\r\nFlowering Season - April-July.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to the Northwest Territory; southward\r\nto the Gulf States. Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAlthough under cultivation the columbine nearly doubles its size,\r\nit never has the elfin charm in a conventional garden that it\r\npossesses wild in Nature's. Dancing in red and yellow petticoats\r\nto the rhythm of the breeze, along the ledge of overhanging\r\nrocks, it coquettes with some Punchinello as if daring him to\r\nreach her at his peril. Who is he? Let us sit a while on the\r\nrocky ledge and watch for her lovers.\r\n\r\nPresently a big muscular bumblebee booms along. Owing to his\r\ngreat strength, an inverted, pendent blossom, from which he must\r\ncling upside down, has no more terrors for him than a trapeze for\r\nthe trained acrobat. His long tongue - if he is one of the\r\nlargest of our sixty-two species of Bombus - can suck almost any\r\nflower unless it is especially adapted to night-flying sphinx\r\nmoths, but can he drain this? He is the truest benefactor of the\r\nEuropean columbine (q.v.), whose spurs suggested the talons of an\r\neagle (aquila) to imaginative Linnaeus when he gave this group of\r\nplants its generic name. Smaller bumblebees, unable through the\r\nshortness of their tongues to feast in a legitimate manner, may\r\nbe detected nipping holes in the tips of all columbines, where\r\nthe nectar is secreted, just as they do in larkspurs, Dutchman's\r\nbreeches, squirrel corn, butter and eggs, and other flowers whose\r\ndeeply hidden nectaries make dining too difficult for the little\r\nrogues. Fragile butterflies, absolutely dependent on nectar,\r\nhover near our showy wild columbine with its five tempting horns\r\nof plenty, but sail away again, knowing as they do that their\r\nweak legs are not calculated to stand the strain of an inverted\r\nposition from a pendent flower, nor are their tongues adapted to\r\nslender tubes unless these may be entered from above. The tongues\r\nof both butterflies and moths bend readily only when directed\r\nbeneath their bodies. It will be noticed that our columbine's\r\nfunnel-shaped tubes contract just below the point where the\r\nnectar is secreted - doubtless to protect it from small bees.\r\nWhen we see the honeybee or the little wild bees - Haliclus\r\nchiefly - on the flower, we may know they get pollen only.\r\n\r\nFinally a ruby-throated hummingbird whirs into sight. Poising\r\nbefore a columbine, and moving around it to drain one spur after\r\nanother until the five are emptied, he flashes like thought to\r\nanother group of inverted red cornucopias, visits in turn every\r\nflower in the colony, then whirs away quite as suddenly as he\r\ncame. Probably to him, and no longer to the outgrown bumblebee,\r\nhas the flower adapted itself. The European species wears blue,\r\nthe bee's favorite color according to Sir John Lubbock; the\r\nnectar hidden in its spurs, which are shorter, stouter, and\r\ncurved, is accessible only to the largest humblebees. There are\r\nno hummingbirds in Europe. (See jewel-weed.) Our native\r\ncolumbine, on the contrary, has longer, contracted, straight,\r\nerect spurs, most easily drained by the ruby-throat which, like\r\nEugene Field, ever delights in \"any color at all so long as it's\r\nred.\"\r\n\r\nTo help make the columbine conspicuous, even the sepals become\r\nred; but the flower is yellow within, it is thought to guide\r\nvisitors to the nectaries. The stamens protrude like a golden\r\ntassel. After the anthers pass the still immature stigmas, the\r\npollen of the outer row ripens, ready for removal, while the\r\ninner row of undeveloped stamens still acts as a sheath for the\r\nstigmas. Owing to the pendent position of the flower, no pollen\r\ncould fall on the latter in any case. The columbine is too highly\r\norganized to tolerate self-fertilization. When all the stamens\r\nhave discharged their pollen, the styles then elongate; and the\r\nfeathery stigmas, opening and curving sidewise, bring themselves\r\nat the entrance of each of the five cornucopias, just the\r\nposition the anthers previously occupied. Probably even the small\r\nbees, collecting pollen only, help carry some from flower to\r\nflower but perhaps the largest bumblebees, and certainly the\r\nhummingbird, must be regarded as the columbine's legitimate\r\nbenefactors. Caterpillars of one of the dusky wings (Papilio\r\nlucilius) feed on the leaves.\r\n\r\nVery rarely is the columbine white, and then its name, derived\r\nfrom words meaning two doves, does not seem wholly misapplied.\r\n\r\n     \"O Columbine, open your folded wrapper\r\n      Where two twin turtle-doves dwell,\"\r\n\r\nlisp thousands of children speaking the \"Songs of Seven\" as a\r\nfirst \"piece\" at school. How Emerson loved the columbine! Dr.\r\nPrior says the flower was given its name because \"of the\r\nresemblance of the nectaries to the heads of pigeons in a ring\r\naround a dish - a favorite device of ancient artists.\"\r\n\r\nThis exquisite plant was forwarded from the Virginia colony to\r\nEngland for the gardens of Hampton Court by a young kinsman of\r\nTradescant, gardener and herbalist to Charles I.\r\n\r\n\r\nPITCHER-PLANT; SIDE-SADDLE FLOWER; HUNTSMAN'S CUP; INDIAN DIPPER\r\n  (Sarracenea purpurea)  Pitcher-plant family\r\n\r\nFlower - Deep reddish purple, sometimes partly greenish, pink, or\r\nred, 2 in. or more across, globose; solitary, nodding from scape\r\n1 to 2 ft. tall. Calyx of 5 sepals, with 3 or 4 bracts at base; 5\r\noverlapping petals, enclosing a yellowish, umbrella-shaped\r\ndilation of the style, with 5 rays terminating in 5-hooked\r\nstigmas; stamens indefinite. Leaves: Hollow, pitcher-shaped\r\nthrough the folding together of their margins, leaving a broad\r\nwing; much inflated, hooded, yellowish green with dark maroon or\r\npurple lines and veinings, 4 to 12 in. long, curved, in a tuft\r\nfrom the root.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Peat bogs; spongy, mossy swamps.\r\nFlowering Season - May-June.\r\nDistribution - Labrador to the Rocky Mountains, south to Florida,\r\nKentucky, and Minnesota.\r\n\r\n        \"What's this I hear\r\n      About the new carnivora?\r\n         Can little piants\r\n         Eat bugs and ants\r\n         And gnats and flies? -\r\n      A sort of retrograding:\r\n         Surely the fare\r\n         Of flowers is air\r\n         Or sunshine sweet\r\n         They shouldn't eat\r\n      Or do aught so degrading!\"\r\n\r\nThere must always be something shocking in the sacrifice of the\r\nhigher life to the lower, of the sensate to what we are pleased\r\nto call the insensate, although no one who has studied the\r\nmarvelously intelligent motives that impel a plant's activities\r\ncan any longer consider the vegetable creation as lacking\r\nsensibility. Science is at length giving us a glimmering of the\r\nmeaning of the word universe, teaching, as it does, that all\r\ncreatures in sharing the One Life share in many of its powers,\r\nand differ from one another only in degree of possession, not in\r\nkind. The transition from one so-called kingdom into another\r\npresumably higher one is a purely arbitrary line marked by man,\r\nand often impossible to define. The animalcule and the\r\ninsectivorous plant know no boundaries between the animal and the\r\nvegetable. And who shall say that the sun-dew or the bladderwort\r\nis not a higher organism than the amoeba? Animated plants, and\r\nvegetating. animals parallel each other. Several hundred\r\ncarnivorous plants in all parts of the world have now been named\r\nby scientists.\r\n\r\nIt is well worth a journey to some spongy, sphagnum bog to gather\r\nclumps of pitcher-plants which will furnish an interesting study\r\nto an entire household throughout the summer while they pursue\r\ntheir nefarious business in a shallow bowl on the veranda. A\r\nmodification of the petiole forms a deep hollow pitcher having\r\nfor its spout a modification of the blade of the leaf. Usually\r\nthe pitchers are half filled with water and tiny drowned victims\r\nwhen we gather them. Some of this fluid must be rain, but the\r\nopen pitcher secretes much juice too. Certain relatives, whose\r\npitchers have hooded lids that keep out rain, are nevertheless\r\nfilled with fluid. On the Pacific Coast the golden jars of\r\nDarlingtonia Californica, with their overarching hoods, are often\r\nso large and watery as to drown small birds and field mice. Note\r\nin passing that these otherwise dark prisons have translucent\r\nspots at the top, whereas our pitcher-plant is lighted through\r\nits open transom.\r\n\r\nA sweet secretion within the pitcher's rim, which some say is\r\nintoxicating, others, that it is an anaesthetic, invites insects\r\nto a fatal feast. It is a simple enough matter for them to walk\r\ninto the pitcher over the band of stiff hairs, pointing downward\r\nlike the withes of a lobster pot, that form an inner covering, or\r\nto slip into the well if they attempt crawling over its polished\r\nupper surface. To fly upward in a perpendicular line once their\r\nwings are wet is additionally hopeless, because of the hairs that\r\nguard the mouth of the trap; and so, after vain attempts to fly\r\nor crawl out of the prison, they usually sink exhausted into a\r\nwatery grave.\r\n\r\nWhen certain plants live in soil that is so poor in nitrogen\r\ncompounds that protein formation is interfered with, they have\r\ncome to depend more or less on a carnivorous diet. The sundew\r\n(q.v.) actually digests its prey with the help of a gastric juice\r\nsimilar to what is found in the stomach of animals; but the\r\nbladderwort (q.v.) and pitcher-plants can only absorb in the form\r\nof soup the products of their victims' decay. Flies and gnats\r\ndrowned in these pitchers quickly yield their poor little bodies;\r\nbut owing to the beetle's hard-shell covering, many a rare\r\nspecimen may be rescued intact to add to a collection.\r\n\r\nA similar ogre plant is the YELLOW-FLOWERED TRUMPET-LEAF (S.\r\nflava) found in bogs in the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUND-NUT\r\n  (Apios Apios; A. tuberosa of Gray)  Pea family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Fragrant, chocolate brown and reddish purple, numerous,\r\nabout 1/2 in. long, clustered in racemes from the leaf-axils.\r\nCalyx 2-lipped, corolla papilionaceous, the broad standard petal\r\nturned backward, the keel sickle-shaped; stamens within it 9 and\r\n1. Stem: From tuberous, edible rootstock; climbing, slender,\r\nseveral feet long, the juice milky. Leaves: Compounded of 5 to 7\r\novate leaflets. Fruit: A leathery, slightly curved pod, 2 to 4\r\nin. long.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Twining about undergrowth and thickets in\r\nmoist or wet ground.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to Ontario, south to the Gulf States\r\nand Kansas.\r\n\r\nNo one knows better than the omnivorous \"barefoot boy\" that\r\n\r\n     \"where the ground-nut trails its vine\"\r\n\r\nthere is hidden something really good to eat under the soft,\r\nmoist soil where legions of royal fern, usually standing guard\r\nabove it, must be crushed before he digs up the coveted tubers.\r\nHe would be the last to confuse it with the WILD KIDNEY BEAN or\r\nBEAN VINE (Phaseolus polystachyus; P. perennis of Gray). The\r\nlatter has loose racemes of smaller purple flowers and leaflets\r\nin threes; nevertheless it is often confounded with the\r\nground-nut vine by older naturalists whose knowledge was \"learned\r\nof schools.\"\r\n\r\nUsually a bee, simply by alighting on the wings of a blossom\r\nbelonging to the pea family, releases the stamens and pistil from\r\nthe keel; not so here. The sickle-shaped keel of the ground-nut's\r\nflower rests its tip firmly in a notch of the standard petal, nor\r\nwill any jar or pressure from outside release it. A bee, guided\r\nto the nectary by the darker color of the underside of the curved\r\nkeel which spans the open cavity of the flower, enters, at least\r\npartially, and so releases by his pressure, applied from\r\nunderneath, the tip of the sickle from its notch in the standard.\r\nNow the released keel curves all the more, and splits open to\r\nrelease the stigmatic tip of the style that touches any pollen\r\nthe bee may have brought from another blossom. Continuing to\r\ncurve and coil while the bee sucks, it presently dusts him afresh\r\nwith pollen from the now released anthers. A mass of pulp between\r\nanthers and stigma prevents any of the flower's own pollen from\r\nself-fertilizing it. These little blossoms, barely half an inch\r\nlong, with their ingenious mechanism to compel\r\ncross-fertilization, repay the closest study.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the leaves of the ground-nut.and wild bean \"are\r\nhardly to be recognized in their queer antics,\" says William\r\nHamilton Gibson. \"The garden beans too play similar pranks. Those\r\nlima bean poles of the garden hold a sleepy crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE SAP; FALSE BEECH-DROPS; YELLOW BIRD'S-NEST\r\n  (Hypopitis Hypopitis; Monolropa Hypopitis of Gray)  Indian-pipe\r\nfamily\r\n\r\nFlowers - Tawny, yellow,ecru, brownish pink, reddish, or bright\r\ncrimson, fragrant, about 1/2 in. long; oblong bell-shaped; borne\r\nin a one-sided, terminal, slightly drooping raceme, becoming\r\nerect after maturity. Scapes: Clustered from a dense mass of\r\nfleshy, fibrous roots; 4 to 12 in. tall, scaly bracted, the\r\nbractlets resembling the sepals. Leaves: None.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry woods, especially under fir, beech, and\r\noak trees.\r\nFlowering Season - June-October.\r\nDistribution - Florida and Arizona, far northward into British\r\nPossessions. Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nBranded a sinner, through its loss of leaves and honest green\r\ncoloring matter (chlorophyll), the pine sap stands among the\r\ndisreputable 'gang' of thieves that includes its next of kin the\r\nIndian-pipe, the broom-rape, dodder, coral-root, and beech-drops\r\n(q.v.). Degenerates like these, although members of highly\r\nrespectable, industrious, virtuous families, would appear to be\r\nas low in the vegetable kingdom as any fungus, were it not for\r\nthe flowers they still bear. Petty larceny, no greater than the\r\nfoxglove's at first, then greater and greater thefts, finally\r\nlead to ruin, until the pine-sap parasite either sucks its food\r\nfrom the roots of the trees under which it takes up its abode, or\r\nabsorbs, like a ghoulish saprophyte, the products of vegetable\r\ndecay. A plant that does not manufacture its own dinner has no\r\nneed of chlorophyll and leaves, for assimilation of crude food\r\ncan take place only in those cells which contain the vital green.\r\nThis substance, universally found in plants that grub in the soil\r\nand literally sweat for their daily bread, acts also as a\r\nmoderator of respiration by its absorptive influence on light,\r\nand hence allows the elimination of carbon dioxide to go on in\r\nthe cells which contain it. Fungi and these degenerates which\r\nlack chlorophyll usually grow in dark, shady woods.\r\n\r\nWithin each little fragrant pine-sap blossom a fringe of hairs,\r\nradiating from the style, forms a stockade against short-tongued\r\ninsects that fain would pilfer from the bees. As the plant grows\r\nold, whatever charm it had in youth disappears, when an\r\nunwholesome mold overspreads its features.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET PIMPERNEL; POOR MAN'S or SHEPHERD'S WEATHER-GLASS; RED\r\nCHICKWEED; BURNET ROSE; SHEPHERD'S CLOCK\r\n  (Anagallis arvensis)  Primrose family\r\n\r\nFlower - Variable, scarlet, deep salmon, copper red, flesh\r\ncolored, or rarely white; usually darker in the center; about 1/4\r\nin. across; wheel-shaped; 5-parted; solitary, on thread-like\r\npeduncles from the leaf-axils. Stem: Delicate; 4-sided, 4 to 12\r\nin. long, much branched, the sprays weak and long. Leaves: Oval,\r\nopposite, sessile, black dotted beneath.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Waste places, dry fields and roadsides, sandy\r\nsoil.\r\nFlowering Season - May-August.\r\nDistribution - Newfoundland to Florida, westward to Minnesota and\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nTiny pimpernel flowers of a reddish copper or terra cotta color\r\nhave only to be seen to be named, for no other blossoms on our\r\ncontinent are of the same peculiar shade. Thrifty patches of the\r\ndelicate little annuals have spread themselves around the\r\ncivilized globe; dying down every autumn, and depending on seeds\r\nalone to keep the foothold once gained here, in Mexico and South\r\nAmerica, Europe, Egypt, Abyssinia, Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius,\r\nNew Holland, Nepal, Persia, and China. What amazing travelers\r\nplants are! The blue-flowered plants are now believed to be a\r\ndistinct species (A. coerulea).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that many birds delight to feast on the\r\nseeds, or perhaps because of it, for many must be dropped\r\nundigested, the scarlet pimpernel is one of the most widely\r\ndistributed species known.\r\n\r\nBefore a storm, when the sun goes under a cloud, or on a dull\r\nday, each little weather prophet closes. A score of pretty folk\r\nnames given it in every land it adopts testifies to its\r\nsensitiveness as a barometer. Under bright skies the flower may\r\nbe said to open out flat at about nine in the morning and to\r\nbegin to close at three in the afternoon. No nectar is secreted\r\nunless there may be some in the colored hairs which clothe the\r\nfilaments. As if it knew perfectly well that however.desirable\r\ninsect visitors are - and it has an excellent device for\r\ncompelling them to transfer pollen - it is likewise independent\r\nof them, it takes no risk in exposing the precious vitalizing\r\ndust to wind and rain, but closes up tight, thereby bringing its\r\npollen-laden stamens in contact with its stigma. Manifestly, it\r\nis better for a plant having aspirations to colonize the globe to\r\nset even self-fertilized seed than none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUND'S TONGUE; GYPSY FLOWER\r\n  (Cynoglossum officinale) Borage family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Dull purplish red, about 1/3 in. across, borne in a\r\ncurved raceme or panicle that straightens as the bloom advances\r\nupward. Calyx 5-parted; corolla salverform, its 5 lobes\r\nspreading; 5 stamens; 1 pistil. Stem: Erect, stout, hairy, leafy,\r\nusually branched, 1 1/2 to 3 ft. high. Leaves: Rather pale, lower\r\nones large, oblong, slender petioled; upper ones lance-shaped,\r\nsessile, or clasping. (Thought to resemble a dog's tongue.)\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry fields, waste places.\r\nFlowering Season - May-September.\r\nDistribution - Quebec to Minnesota, south to the Carolinas and.\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\nThis is still another weed \"naturalized from Europe\" which, by\r\ncontenting itself with waste land, has been able in an incredibly\r\nshort time to overrun half our continent. How easy conquest of\r\nour vast unoccupied area is for weeds that have proved fittest\r\nfor survival in the overcultivated Old World! Protected from the\r\nravages of cattle by a disagreeable odor suggesting a nest of\r\nmice, and foliage that tastes even worse than it smells; by hairs\r\non its stem that act as a light screen as well as a stockade\r\nagainst pilfering ants; by humps on the petals that hide the\r\nnectar from winged trespassers on the bees' and butterflies'\r\npreserves, the hound's tongue goes into the battle of life\r\nfurther armed with barbed seeds that sheep must carry in their\r\nfleece, and other animals, including most unwilling humans,\r\ntransport to fresh colonizing ground. For a plant to shower its\r\nseeds beside itself is almost fatal; so many offspring impoverish\r\nthe soil and soon choke each other to death, if, indeed, ants and\r\nsuch crawlers have not devoured the seeds where they lie on the\r\nground. Some plants like the violet, jewelweed, and witch-hazel\r\nforcibly eject theirs a few inches, feet or yards. The wind blows\r\nmillions about with every gust. Streams and currents of water\r\ncarry others; ships and railroads give free transportation to\r\nquantities among the hay used in packing; birds and animals lift\r\nmany on their feet - Darwin raised 537 plants from a ball of mud\r\ncarried between the toes of a snipe! - and such feathered and\r\nfurred agents as feed on berries and other fruits sometimes drop\r\nthe seeds a thousand miles from the parent. but it will be\r\nnoticed that such vagabonds as travel by the hook or by crook\r\nmethod, getting a lift in the world frpm every passer-by\r\n-.burdocks, beggar-ticks, cleavers, pitchforks, Spanish needles,\r\nand scores of similar tramps that we pick off our clothing after\r\nevery walk in autumn - make, perhaps, the most successful\r\ntravelers on the globe. The hound's tongue's four nutlets,\r\ngrouped in a pyramid, and with barbed spears as grappling-hooks,\r\nimbed themselves in our garments until they pucker the cloth.\r\nWool growers hurl anathemas at this whole tribe of plants.\r\n\r\nA near relative, the common VIRGINIA STICKSEED (Lappula\r\nVirginiana; C. Morisoni of Gray) produces similar little barbed\r\nnutlets, following insignificant, tiny, palest blue or white\r\nflowers up the spike. These bristling seeds, shaped like\r\nsad-irons, reflect in their title the ire of the persecuted man\r\nwho named them Beggar's Lice. If as Emerson said, a weed, is a\r\nplant whose virtues have not yet been discovered, the hound's\r\ntongue, the similar but blue-flowered WILD COMFREY (C.\r\nVirginicum), next of kin, and the stickseed are no weeds; for\r\nages ago the caterpillars of certain tiger moths learned to\r\ndepend on their foliage as a food store,\r\n\r\n\r\nOSWEGO TEA; BEE BALM; INDIAN'S PLUME; FRAGRANT BALM; MOUNTAIN\r\nMINT\r\n  (Monarda didyma)  Mint family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Scarlet, clustered in a solitary, terminal, rounded\r\nhead of dark-red calices, with leafy bracts below it. Calyx\r\nnarrow, tubular, sharply 5-toothed; corolla tubular, widest at\r\nthe mouth, 2-lipped, 1 1/2 to 2 inches long; 2 long,\r\nanther-bearing stamens ascending, protruding; 1 pistil; the style\r\n2-cleft. Stem: 2 to 3 ft. tall. Leaves: Aromatic, opposite, dark\r\ngreen, oval to oblong lance-shaped, sharply saw-edged, often\r\nhairy beneath, petioled; upper leaves and bracts often red.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist soil, especially near streams, in hilly\r\nor mountainous regions.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - Canada to Georgia, west to Michigan.\r\n\r\nGorgeous, glowing scarlet heads of bee balm arrest the dullest\r\neye, bracts and upper leaves often taking on blood-red color,\r\ntoo, as if it had dripped from the lacerated flowers. Where their\r\nvivid doubles are reflected in a shadowy mountain stream, not\r\neven the cardinal flower is more strikingly beautiful. Thrifty\r\nclumps transplanted from Nature's garden will spread about ours\r\nand add a splendor like the flowers of salvia, next of kin, if\r\nonly the roots get a frequent soaking.\r\n\r\nWith even longer flower tubes than the wild bergamot's (q.v.),\r\nthe bee balm belies its name, for, however frequently bees may\r\ncome about for nectar when it rises high, only long-tongued\r\nbumblebees could get enough to compensate for their trouble.\r\nButterflies, which suck with their wings in motion plumb the\r\ndepths. The ruby-throated hummingbird - to which the Brazilian\r\nsalvia of our gardens has adapted itself - flashes about these\r\nwhorls of Indian plumes just as frequently - of course\r\ntransferring pollen on his needle-like bill as he darts from\r\nflower to flower. Even the protruding stamens and pistil take on\r\nthe prevailing hue. Most of the small, blue or purple flowered\r\nmembers of the mint family cater to bees by wearing their\r\nfavorite color; the bergamot charms butterflies with magenta, and\r\ntubes so deep the short-tongued mob cannot pilfer their sweets;\r\nand from the frequency of the hummingbird's visits, from the\r\ngreater depth of the bee balm's tubes and their brilliant,\r\nflaring red - an irresistibly attractive color to the ruby-throat\r\n- it would appear that this is a bird flower. Certainly its\r\nadaptation is quite as perfect as the salvia's. Mischievous bees\r\nand wasps steal nectar they cannot reach legitimately through\r\nbungholes of their own making in the bottom of the slender casks.\r\n\r\n\"This species,\" says Mr. Ellwanger, \"is said to give a decoction\r\nbut little inferior to the true tea, and was largely used as a\r\nsubstitute\" by the Indians and the colonists, who learned from\r\nthem how to brew it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET PAINTED CUP; INDIAN PAINT-BRUSH\r\n  (Castilleja coccinea)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish yellow, enclosed by broad, vermilion, 3-cleft\r\nfloral bracts; borne in a terminal spike. Calyx flattened,\r\ntubular, cleft above and below into 2 lobes; usually green,\r\nsometimes scarlet; corolla very irregular, the upper lip long and\r\narched, the short lower lip 3-lobed; 4 unequal stamens; pistil.\r\nStem: 1 to 2 ft. high, usually unbranched, hairy. Leaves: Lower\r\nones tufted, oblong, mostly uncut; stem leaves deeply cleft into\r\n3 to 5 segments, sessile.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Meadows; prairies; moist, sandy soil;\r\nthickets.\r\nFlowering Season - May-July.\r\nDistribution - Maine to Manitoba, south to Virginia, Kansas, and\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nHere and there the fresh green meadows show a touch of as vivid a\r\nred as that in which Vibert delighted to dip his brush.\r\n\r\n                         \"Scarlet tufts\r\n      Are glowing in the green like flakes of fire;\r\n      The wanderers of the prairie know them well,\r\n      And call that brilliant flower the 'painted cup.'\"\r\n\r\nThoreau, who objected to this name, thought flame flower a better\r\none, the name the Indians gave to Oswego tea; but here the floral\r\nbracts, not the flowers themselves, are on fire. Lacking good,\r\nhonest, deep green, one suspects from the yellowish tone of\r\ncalices, stem, and leaves, that this plant is something of a\r\nthief. That it still possesses foliage, proves only petty larceny\r\nagainst it, similar to the foxglove's (q.v.). Caterpillars of\r\ncertain checker-spot butterflies in turn prey upon Castilleja.\r\nUnder cover of darkness, in the soil below, the roots of our\r\npainted cup occasionally break in and steal from the roots of its\r\nneighbors such juices as the plant must work over into vegetable\r\ntissue. Therefore it still needs leaves, indispensable parts of a\r\ndigestive apparatus. Were it wholly given up to piracy, like the\r\ndodder, or as parasitic as the Indian pipe, even the green and\r\nthe leaf that it hath would be taken away from this slothful\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nBut even without honest leaf green (chlorophyll), we know that\r\nplants as low in the scale as fungi often take on the most\r\nbrilliant of yellows and reds. In the painted cup the bracts,\r\nwhich enfold the insignificant yellowish cloistered flowers like\r\na cape, render them great service in attracting the ruby-throated\r\nhummingbird by donning his favorite color. No lip landing place\r\nis provided for insects, as in other members of the figwort\r\nfamily dependent on bees; although bumblebees, which desire one,\r\nand butterflies, which suck with their wings in motion, may be\r\nrarely caught robbing the short tubes. Among the wild flowers,\r\nonly the columbine, with an almost parallel blooming season,\r\nrivals the painted cup for the bird's beneficent attentions. The\r\nlatter flowers at about the time the ruby-throat flashes\r\nnorthward out of the tropics to spend the summer. Professor\r\nRobertson of Illinois says, \"In 1886 the first hummingbird seen\r\nwas on May 5, visiting the Castilleja.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD BETONY; LOUSEWORT; BEEFSTEAK PLANT; HIGH HEAL-ALL\r\n  {Pedicularis Canadensis)  Figwort family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Greenish yellow and purplish red, in a short dense\r\nspike. Calyx oblique, tubular, cleft on lower side, and with 2 or\r\n3 scallops on upper; corolla about 3/4 in. long, 2-lipped, the\r\nupper lip arched, concave, the lower 3-lobed; 4 stamens in pairs;\r\n1 pistil. Stems: Clustered, simple, hairy, 6 to 18 in. high.\r\nLeaves: Mostly tufted, oblong lance-shaped in outline, and\r\npinnately lobed.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Dry, open woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-June.\r\nDistribution - Nova Scotia to Florida, westward to Manitoba,\r\nColorado, and Kansas.\r\n\r\nWhen the Italians wish to extol someone they say, \"He has more\r\nvirtues than betony,\" alluding, of course, to the European\r\nspecies, Betonica officinalis, a plant that was worn about the\r\nneck and cultivated in cemeteries during the Middle Ages as a\r\ncharm against evil spirits; and prepared into plasters,\r\nointments, syrups, and oils, was supposed to cure every ill that\r\nflesh is heir to. Our commonest American species fulfils its\r\nmission in beautifying roadside banks and dry, open woods and\r\ncopses with thick, short spikes of bright flowers, that rise\r\nabove large rosettes of coarse, hairy, fern-like foliage. At\r\nfirst, these flowers, beloved of bumblebees, are all greenish\r\nyellow; but as the spike lengthens with increased bloom, the\r\narched, upper lip of the blossom becomes dark purplish red, the\r\nlower one remains pale yellow, and the throat turns reddish,\r\nwhile some of the beefsteak color often creeps into stems and\r\nleaves as well.\r\n\r\nFarmers once believed that after their sheep fed on the foliage\r\nof this group of plants a skin disease, produced by a certain\r\ntiny louse (pediculus), would attack them - hence our innocent\r\nbetony's repellent name.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEECH-DROPS\r\n  (Septamnium Virginianum; Epifegus Virginiana of Gray)\r\nBroom-rape family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Small, dull purple and white, tawny, or brownish\r\nstriped; scattered along loose, tiny bracted, ascending branches.\r\nStem: Brownish or reddish tinged, slender, tough, branching\r\nabove, 6 in. to 2 ft. tall, from brittle, fibrous roots.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Under beech, oak, and chestnut trees.\r\nFlowering Season - August-October.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick, westward to Ontario and Missouri,\r\nsouth to the Gulf States.\r\n\r\nNearly related to the broom-rape is this less attractive pirate,\r\na taller, brownish-purple plant, with a disagreeable odor, whose\r\nerect, branching stem without leaves is still furnished with\r\nbrownish scales, the remains of what were once green leaves in\r\nvirtuous ancestors, no doubt. But perhaps even these relics of\r\nhonesty may one day disappear. Nature brands every sinner\r\nsomehow; and the loss of green from a plant's leaves may be taken\r\nas a certain indication that theft of another's food stamps it\r\nwith this outward and visible sign of guilt. The grains of green\r\nto which foliage owes its color are among the most essential of\r\nproducts to honest vegetables that have to grub in the soil for a\r\nliving, since it is only in such cells as contain it that\r\nassimilation of food can take place. As chlorophyll, or\r\nleaf-green, acts only under the influence of light and air, most\r\nplants expose all the leaf surface possible; but a parasite,\r\nwhich absorbs from others juices already assimilated, certainly\r\nhas no use for chlorophyll, nor for leaves either; and in the\r\nbroom-rape, beech-drops, and Indian pipe, among other thieves, we\r\nsee leaves degenerated into bracts more or less without color,\r\naccording to the extent of their crime. Now they cannot\r\nmanufacture carbohydrates, even if they would, any more than\r\nfungi can.\r\n\r\nOn the beech-drop's slender branches two kinds of flowers are\r\nseated: below are the minute fertile ones, which never open, but,\r\nwithout imported pollen, ripen an abundance of seed with\r\nliterally the closest economy. Nevertheless, to save the species\r\nfrom still deeper degeneracy through perpetual\r\nself-fertilization, small purplish-striped flowers above them\r\nmature stigmas and anthers on different days, and invite insect\r\nvisits to help them produce a few cross-fertilized seeds. Even a\r\nfew will save it. Every plant which bears cleistogamous or blind\r\nflowers - violets, wood-sorrel, jewelweed, among others - must\r\nalso display some showy ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUMPET-FLOWER; TRUMPET-CREEPER\r\n  (Tecoma radicans)  Trumpet-creeper family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Red and veined within, paler and inclined toward tawny\r\nwithout, trumpet-shaped, about 2 1/2 in. long, the limb with 5\r\nrounded lobes; 2 to 9 flowers in the terminal clusters;\r\nanther-bearing stamens 4, in pairs, under upper part of tube; 1\r\npistil. Stem: A woody vine 20 to 40 ft. long, prstrate or\r\nclimbing. Leaves: Opposite, pinnately compounded of 7 to 11\r\novate, saw-edged leaflets.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Moist, rich woods and thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - August-September.\r\nDistribution - New Jersey and Pennsylvania, westward to Illinois,\r\nand soutb to the Gulf States. Occasionally escaped from gardens\r\nfarther north.\r\n\r\n>From early May untll the middle of October, the ruby-throated\r\nhummingbird forsakes the tropics to spend the flowery months with\r\nus. Which wild flowers undertake to feed him? Years before showy\r\nflowers were brought from all corners of the earth to adorn our\r\ngardens, about half a dozen natives in that parterre of Nature's\r\neast of the Mississippi catered to him in orderly succeswsion. In\r\nfeasting at their board he could not choose but reciprocate the\r\nfavor by transferring their pollen as they took pains to arrange\r\nmatters. Nectar and tiny insects he is ever seeking. Of course\r\nhundreds of flowers secrete nectar which taxes them little; and\r\nwhile the vast majority of these are avowedly adapted to insect\r\nbenefactors; what is to prevent the bird's needle-like bill from\r\nprobing the sweets from most of them? Certain flowers dependent\r\non him, finding that the mere offering of nectar was not enough\r\nto insure his fidelity, that he was constantly lured away, had to\r\noffer some especially strong attractions to make his regular\r\nvisits sure. How did these learn that red is irresistibly\r\nfascinating to him, and orange scarcely less so, perhaps for the\r\nsake of the red that is mixed with the yellow? Today we find such\r\nflowers as need him sorely, wearing his favorite colors. But even\r\nthis delicate attention is not enough. He demands that his\r\nrefreshments shall be reserved for him in a tube so deep or\r\ninaccessible that, when he calls, he will find all he desires,\r\nnotwithstanding the occasional intrusion of such long-tongued\r\ninsects as bumblebees, butterflies, and moths. First the\r\nlong-spurred red and yellow columbine and the painted cup, then\r\nthe coral honeysuckle, jewelweed, trumpet-creeper, Oswego tea,\r\nand cardinal flower have the honor of catering to the exacting\r\nlittle sprite from spring to autumn. His sojourn in our gardens\r\nis prolonged until his beloved gladioli, cannas, honeysuckles,\r\nnasturtiums, and salvia succumb to frost.\r\n\r\nWhere a trumpet vine climbs with the help of its aerial roots,\r\nlike an ivy's, and sends forth clusters of brilliant tubes at the\r\ntips of long, wiry branches, there one is sure to see sooner or\r\nlater, the ruby-throat flashing, whirring, darting from flower to\r\nflower. Eight birds at once were counted about a vine one sunny\r\nmorning. The next, a pair of tame pigeons walked over the roof of\r\nthe summer-house where the creeper grew luxuriantly, and\r\npunctured, with a pop that was distinctly heard fifty feet away,\r\nthe base of every newly opened nectar-filled trumpet on it! That\r\nafternoon all the corollas discolored, and no hummers came near.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORAL or TRUMPET HONEYSUCKLE\r\n  (Lonicera sempervirens)  Honeysuckle family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Red outside, orange yellow within; whorled round\r\nterminal spikes. Calyx insignificant; corolla tubular, slender, 1\r\n1/2 in. long or less, slightly spread below the 5-lobed limb; 5\r\nstamens; 1 pistil. Stem: A high, twining vine. Leaves: Evergreen\r\nin the South only; opposite, rounded oval, dark, shining green\r\nabove, the upper leaves united around the stem by their bases to\r\nform a cup. Fruit: An interrupted spike of deep orange-red\r\nberries.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Rich, light, warm soil; hillsides, thickets.\r\nFlowering Season - April-September.\r\nDistribution - Connecticut, westward to Nebraska, and south to\r\nthe Gulf States. Occasionally escaped from cultivation farther\r\nnorth,.\r\n\r\nSmall-flowered bush honeysuckles elected to serve and be served\r\nby bees; those with longer tubes welcomed bumblebees; the white\r\nand yellow flowered twining honeysuckles, deep of tube and\r\ndeliciously fragrant, especially after dark, when they are still\r\nvisible, cater to the sphinx moths (see sweet wild honeysuckle);\r\nbut surely the longest-tongued bumblebee could not plumb the\r\ndepths of this slender-tubed trumpet honeysuckle, nor the\r\nnight-flying moth discover a flower that has melted into the\r\nprevailing darkness when he begins his rounds, and takes no pains\r\nto guide him with perfume. What creature, then, does it cater to?\r\nAfter reading of the aims of the trumpet-flower on the preceding\r\npage, no one will be surprised to hear that the ruby-throated\r\nhummingbird's visits are responsible for most of the berries that\r\nfollow these charming, generous, abundant flowers, so eminently\r\nto his liking. Larger migrants than he, in search of fare so\r\nattractive, distribute the seeds far and wide. Is any other\r\nspecies more wholly dependent on birds?\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDINAL FLOWER; RED LOBELIA\r\n  (Lobelia cardinalis)  Bellflower family\r\n\r\nFlowers - Rich vermilion, very rarely rose or white, 1 to 1 1/2\r\nin, long, numerous, growing in terminal, erect, green-bracted,\r\nmore or less 1-sided racemes. Calyx 5-cleft; corolla tubular,\r\nsplit down one side, 2-lipped; the lower lip with 3 spreading\r\nlobes, the upper lip 2-lobed, erect; 5 stamens united into a tube\r\naround the style; 2 anthers with hairy tufts. Stem: 2 to 4 1/2\r\nft. high, rarely branched. Leaves: Oblong to lance-shaped,\r\nslightly toothed, mostly sessile.\r\nPreferred Habitat - Wet or low ground, beside streams, ditches,\r\nand meadow runnels.\r\nFlowering Season - July-September.\r\nDistribution - New Brunswick to the Gulf States, westward to the\r\nNorthwest Territory and Kansas.\r\n\r\nBy the depth and brilliancy of its incomparable hue, the shade\r\nwith which Vibert delighted to illumine his rich canvases, the\r\ncolor of the famous hat worn by seventy ecclesiastical princes of\r\nthe Roman Church, but a richer red than the bird which shares the\r\nname can boast, the cardinal flower proclaims its title to all\r\nbeholders. Because its vivid beauty cannot be hid, and few\r\nwithstand the temptation to pick it, its extermination goes on as\r\nrapidly as its bird namesake's.\r\n\r\n     \"Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?\r\n      Loved the wood rose and left it on its stalk?\"\r\n\r\nThe easy cultivation from seed of this peerless wildflower -  and\r\nit is offered in many trade catalogues - might save it to those\r\nregions in Nature's wide garden that now know it no more. The\r\nranks of floral missionaries need recruits.\r\n\r\nCurious that the great blue lobelia should be the cardinal\r\nflower's twin sister! Why this difference of color? Sir John\r\nLubbock proved by tireless experiment that the bees' favorite\r\ncolor is blue, and the shorter-tubed blue lobelia elected to woo\r\nthem as her benefactors. Whoever has made a study of the\r\nruby-throated hummingbird's habits must have noticed how red\r\nflowers entice him - columbines, painted cups, coral honeysuckle,\r\nOswego tea, trumpet flower, and cardinal in Nature's garden;\r\ncannas, salvia, gladioli, pelargoniums, fuchsias, phloxes,\r\nverbenas, and nasturtiums among others in ours. How the cardinal\r\nflower's wonderful mechanism works to utilize his visits has\r\nalready been told under great lobelia, in the description of the\r\nblue lobelia of similar construction. But with a bird so much\r\ngreater than the ruby-throat that the jeweled-feathered atom\r\ncould be concealed under one of its talons is the red lobelia\r\nforever associated:\r\n\r\n     \"The cardinal, and the blood-red spots,\r\n        Its double in the stream\r\n      As if some wounded eagle's breast,\r\n        Slow throbbing o'er the plain,\r\n      Had left its airy path impressed\r\n        In drops of scarlet rain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     A P P E N D I C E S\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGRANT FLOWERS OR LEAVES.\r\n\r\nBaby's Breath.
