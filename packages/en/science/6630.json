It is not the mathematics\r\nof astronomy, but the wonder and the mystery that seize upon the\r\nimagination. The calculation of an eclipse owes all its prestige to the\r\nsublimity of its data; the operation, in itself, requires no more\r\nmental effort than the preparation of a railway time-table.\r\n\r\nThe dominion which astronomy has always held over the minds of men is\r\nakin to that of poetry; when the former becomes merely instructive and\r\nthe latter purely didactic, both lose their power over the imagination.\r\nAstronomy is known as the oldest of the sciences, and it will be the\r\nlongest-lived because it will always have arcana that have not been\r\npenetrated.\r\n\r\nSome of the things described in this book are little known to the\r\naverage reader, while others are well known; but all possess the\r\nfascination of whatever is strange, marvelous, obscure, or\r\nmysterious—magnified, in this case, by the portentous scale of the\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the author is to tell about these things in plain language,\r\nbut with as much scientific accuracy as plain language will permit,\r\nshowing the wonder that is in them without getting away from the facts.\r\nMost of them have hitherto been discussed only in technical form, and\r\nin treatises that the general public seldom sees and never reads.\r\n\r\nAmong the topics touched upon are:\r\n\r\nThe strange unfixedness of the “fixed stars,” the vast migrations of\r\nthe suns and worlds constituting the universe.\r\n\r\nThe slow passing out of existence of those collocations of stars which\r\nfor thousands of years have formed famous “constellations,” preserving\r\nthe memory of mythological heroes and heroines, and perhaps of\r\notherwise unrecorded history.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of stars to assemble in immense clouds, swarms, and\r\nclusters.\r\n\r\nThe existence in some of the richest regions of the universe of\r\nabsolutely black, starless gaps, deeps, or holes, as if one were\r\nlooking out of a window into the murkiest night.\r\n\r\nThe marvelous phenomena of new, or temporary, stars, which appear as\r\nsuddenly as conflagrations, and often turn into something else as\r\neccentric as themselves.\r\n\r\nThe amazing forms of the “whirlpool,” “spiral,” “pinwheel,” and “lace,”\r\nor “tress,” nebulæ.\r\n\r\nThe strange surroundings of the sun, only seen in particular\r\ncircumstances, but evidently playing a constant part in the daily\r\nphenomena of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary transformations undergone by comets and their tails.\r\n\r\nThe prodigies of meteorites and masses of stone and metal fallen from\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThe cataclysms that have wrecked the moon.\r\n\r\nThe problem of life and intelligence on the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nThe problematical origin and fate of the asteroids.\r\n\r\nThe strange phenomena of the auroral lights.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to develop these topics in an orderly way,\r\nshowing their connection, so that the reader may obtain a broad general\r\nview of the chief mysteries and problems of astronomy, and an idea of\r\nthe immense field of discovery which still lies, almost unexplored,\r\nbefore it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOSITIES OF THE SKY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\nThe Windows of Absolute Night\r\n\r\n\r\nTo most minds mystery is more fascinating than science. But when\r\nscience itself leads straight up to the borders of mystery and there\r\ncomes to a dead stop, saying, “At present I can no longer see my way,”\r\nthe force of the charm is redoubled. On the other hand, the illimitable\r\nis no less potent in mystery than the invisible, whence the dramatic\r\neffect of Keats’ “stout Cortez” staring at the boundless Pacific while\r\nall his men look at each other with a wild surmise, “silent upon a peak\r\nin Darien.” It is with similar feelings that the astronomer regards\r\ncertain places where from the peaks of the universe his vision seems to\r\nrange out into endless empty space. He sees there the shore of his\r\nlittle isthmus, and, beyond, unexplored immensity.\r\n\r\nThe name, “coal-sacks,” given to these strange voids is hardly\r\ndescriptive. Rather they produce upon the mind the effect of blank\r\nwindows in a lonely house on a pitch-dark night, which, when looked at\r\nfrom the brilliant interior, become appalling in their rayless murk.\r\nInfinity seems to acquire a new meaning in the presence of these black\r\nopenings in the sky, for as one continues to gaze it loses its purely\r\nmetaphysical quality and becomes a kind of entity, like the ocean. The\r\nobserver is conscious that he can actually _see_ the beginning of its\r\nebon depths, in which the visible universe appears to float like an\r\nenchanted island, resplendent within with lights and life and gorgeous\r\nspectacles, and encircled with screens of crowded stars, but with its\r\ndazzling vistas ending at the fathomless sea of pure darkness which\r\nencloses all.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy, or Milky Way, surrounds the borders of our island in space\r\nlike a stellar garland, and when openings appear in it they are, by\r\ncontrast, far more impressive than the general darkness of the\r\ninterstellar expanse seen in other directions. Yet even that expanse is\r\nnot everywhere equally dark, for it contains gloomy deeps discernable\r\nwith careful watching. Here, too, contrast plays an important part,\r\nthough less striking than within the galactic region. Some of Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel’s observations appear to indicate an association\r\nbetween these tenebrious spots and neighboring star clouds and nebulæ.\r\nIt is an illuminating bit of astronomical history that when he was\r\nsweeping the then virgin heavens with his great telescopes he was\r\naccustomed to say to his sister who, note-book in hand, waited at his\r\nside to take down his words, fresh with the inspiration of discovery:\r\n“Prepare to write; the nebulæ are coming; here space is vacant.”\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the “coal-sacks,” and the first to be brought to\r\ngeneral attention before astronomers had awakened to the significance\r\nof such things, lies adjacent to the “Southern Cross,” and is truly an\r\namazing phenomenon. It is not alone the conspicuousness of this\r\ncelestial vacancy, opening suddenly in the midst of one of the richest\r\nparts of the Galaxy, that has given it its fame, but quite as much the\r\nsuperstitious awe with which it was regarded by the early explorers of\r\nthe South Seas. To them, as well as to those who listened in rapt\r\nwonder to their tales, the “Coal-sack” seemed to possess some occult\r\nconnection with the mystic “Cross.” In the eyes of the sailors it was\r\nnot a vacancy so much as a sable reality in the sky, and as,\r\nshuddering, they stared at it, they piously crossed themselves. It was\r\nanother of the magical wonders of the unknown South, and as such it\r\nformed the basis of many a “wild surmise” and many a sea-dog’s yarn.\r\nScientific investigation has not diminished its prestige, and today no\r\ntraveler in the southern hemisphere is indifferent to its fascinating\r\nstrangeness, while some find it the most impressive spectacle of the\r\nantarctic heavens.\r\n\r\nAll around, up to the very edge of the yawning gap, the sheen of the\r\nMilky Way is surpassingly glorious; but there, as if in obedience to an\r\nalmighty edict, everything vanishes. A single faint star is visible\r\nwithin the opening, producing a curious effect upon the sensitive\r\nspectator, like the sight of a tiny islet in the midst of a black,\r\nmotionless, waveless tarn. The dimensions of the lagoon of darkness,\r\nwhich is oval or pear-shaped, are eight degrees by five, so that it\r\noccupies a space in the sky about one hundred and thirty times greater\r\nthan the area of the full moon. It attracts attention as soon as the\r\neye is directed toward the quarter where it exists, and by virtue of\r\nthe rarity of such phenomena it appears a far greater wonder than the\r\ndrifts of stars that are heaped around it. Now that observatories are\r\nmultiplying in the southern hemisphere, the great austral “Coal-sack”\r\nwill, no doubt, receive attention proportioned to its importance as one\r\nof the most significant features of the sky. Already at the Sydney\r\nObservatory photographs have shown that the southern portion of this\r\nDead Sea of Space is not quite “bottomless,” although its northern part\r\ndefies the longest sounding lines of the astronomer.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar, but less perfect, “coal-sack” in the northern\r\nhemisphere, in the constellation of “The Swan,” which, strange to say,\r\nalso contains a well-marked figure of a cross outlined by stars. This\r\ngap lies near the top of the cross-shaped figure. It is best seen by\r\naverted vision, which brings out the contrast with the Milky Way, which\r\nis quite brilliant around it. It does not, however, exercise the same\r\nweird attraction upon the eye as the southern “Coal-sack,” for instead\r\nof looking like an absolute void in the sky, it rather appears as if a\r\ncanopy of dark gauze had been drawn over the stars. We shall see the\r\npossible significance of this appearance later.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Milky Way. Region near M.S. Photographed by\r\nProfessor Barnard]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust above the southern horizon of our northern middle latitudes, in\r\nsummer, where the Milky Way breaks up into vast sheets of nebulous\r\nluminosity, lying over and between the constellations Scorpio and\r\nSagittarius, there is a remarkable assemblage of “coal-sacks,” though\r\nnone is of great size. One of them, near a conspicuous star-cluster in\r\nScorpio, M80, is interesting for having been the first of these strange\r\nobjects noted by Herschel. Probably it was its nearness to M80 which\r\nsuggested to his mind the apparent connection of such vacancies with\r\nstar-clusters which we have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut the most marvelous of the “coal-sacks” are those that have been\r\nfound by photography in Sagittarius. One of Barnard’s earliest and most\r\nexcellent photographs includes two of them, both in the star-cluster\r\nM8. The larger, which is roughly rectangular in outline, contains one\r\nlittle star, and its smaller neighbor is lune-shaped—surely a most\r\nsingular form for such an object. Both are associated with curious dark\r\nlanes running through the clustered stars like trails in the woods.\r\nAlong the borders of these lanes the stars are ranked in parallel rows,\r\nand what may be called the bottoms of the lanes are not entirely dark,\r\nbut pebbled with faint stellar points. One of them which skirts the two\r\ndark gaps and traverses the cluster along its greatest diameter is\r\nedged with lines of stars, recalling the alignment of the trees\r\nbordering a French highway. This _road of stars_ cannot be less than\r\nmany billions of miles in length!\r\n\r\nAll about the cluster the bed of the Galaxy is strangely disturbed, and\r\nin places nearly denuded, as if its contents had been raked away to\r\nform the immense stack and the smaller accumulations of stars around\r\nit. The well-known “Trifid Nebula” is also included in the field of the\r\nphotograph, which covers a truly marvelous region, so intricate in its\r\nmingling of nebulæ, star-clusters, star-swarms, star-streams, and dark\r\nvacancies that no description can do it justice. Yet, chaotic as it\r\nappears, there is an unmistakable suggestion of unity about it,\r\nimpressing the beholder with the idea that all the different parts are\r\nin some way connected, and have not been fortuitously thrown together.\r\nMiss Agnes M. Clerke made the striking remark that the dusky lanes in\r\nM8 are exemplified on the largest scale in the great rift dividing the\r\nMilky Way, from Cygnus in the northern hemisphere all the way to the\r\n“Cross” in the southern. Similar lanes are found in many other\r\nclusters, and they are generally associated with flanking rows of\r\nstars, resembling in their arrangement the thick-set houses and villas\r\nalong the roadways that traverse the approaches to a great city.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the black gaps. Are they really windows in the\r\nstar-walls of the universe? Some of them look rather as if they had\r\nbeen made by a shell fired through a luminous target, allowing the eye\r\nto range through the hole into the void space beyond. If science is\r\ndiscretely silent about these things, what can the more venturesome and\r\nless responsible imagination suggest? Would a huge “runaway sun,” like\r\nArcturus, for instance, make such an opening if it should pass like a\r\nprojectile through the Milky Way? It is at least a stimulating inquiry.\r\nBeing probably many thousands of times more massive than the galactic\r\nstars, such a stellar missile would not be stopped by them, though its\r\ndirection of flight might be altered. It would drag the small stars\r\nlying close to its course out of their spheres, but the ultimate\r\ntendency of its attraction would be to sweep them round in its wake,\r\nthus producing rather a star-swarm than a vacancy. Those that were very\r\nclose to it might be swept away in its rush and become its satellites,\r\ncareering away with it in its flight into outer space; but those that\r\nwere farther off, and they would, of course, greatly outnumber the\r\nnearer ones, would tend inward from all sides toward the line of\r\nflight, as dust and leaves collect behind a speeding motor (though the\r\nforces operating would be different), and would fill up the hole, if\r\nhole it were. A swarm thus collected should be rounded in outline and\r\nbordered with a relatively barren ring from which the stars had been\r\n“sucked” away. In a general sense the M8 cluster answers to this\r\ndescription, but even if we undertook to account for its existence by a\r\nsupposition like the above, the black gaps would remain unexplained,\r\nunless one could make a further draft on the imagination and suggest\r\nthat the stars had been thrown into a vast eddy, or system of eddies,\r\nwhose vortices appear as dark holes. Only a maelstrom-like motion could\r\nkeep such a funnel open, for without regard to the impulse derived from\r\nthe projectile, the proper motions of the stars themselves would tend\r\nto fill it. Perhaps some other cause of the whirling motion may be\r\nfound. As we shall see when we come to the spiral nebulæ, gyratory\r\nmovements are exceedingly prevalent throughout the universe, and the\r\nstructure of the Milky Way is everywhere suggestive of them. But this\r\nis hazardous sport even for the imagination—to play with _suns_ as if\r\nthey were but thistle-down in the wind or corks in a mill-race.\r\n\r\nAnother question arises: What is the thickness of the hedge of stars\r\nthrough which the holes penetrate? Is the depth of the openings\r\nproportionate to their width? In other words, is the Milky Way round in\r\nsection like a rope, or flat and thin like a ribbon? The answer is not\r\nobvious, for we have little or no information concerning the relative\r\ndistances of the faint galactic stars. It would be easier, certainly,\r\nto conceive of openings in a thin belt than in a massive ring, for in\r\nthe first case they would resemble mere rifts and breaks, while in the\r\nsecond they would be like wells or bore-holes. Then, too, the fact that\r\nthe Milky Way is not a _continuous_ body but is made up of stars whose\r\nactual distances apart is great, offers another quandary; persistent\r\nand sharply bordered apertures in such an assemblage are _a priori_ as\r\nimprobable, if not impossible, as straight, narrow holes running\r\nthrough a swarm of bees.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of these questions indicates one of the reasons why it\r\nhas been suggested that the seeming gaps, or many of them, are not\r\nopenings at all, but opaque screens cutting off the light from stars\r\nbehind them. That this is quite possible in some cases is shown by\r\nBarnard’s later photographs, particularly those of the singular region\r\naround the star Rho Ophiuchi. Here are to be seen somber lanes and\r\npatches, apparently forming a connected system which covers an immense\r\nspace, and which their discoverer thinks may constitute a “dark\r\nnebula.” This seems at first a startling suggestion; but, after all,\r\nwhy should their not be dark nebulæ as well as visible ones? In truth,\r\nit has troubled some astronomers to explain the luminosity of the\r\nbright nebulæ, since it is not to be supposed that matter in so diffuse\r\na state can be incandescent through heat, and phosphorescent light is\r\nin itself a mystery. The supposition is also in accord with what we\r\nknow of the existence of dark solid bodies in space. Many bright stars\r\nare accompanied by obscure companions, sometimes as massive as\r\nthemselves; the planets are non-luminous; the same is true of meteors\r\nbefore they plunge into the atmosphere and become heated by friction;\r\nand many plausible reasons have been found for believing that space\r\ncontains as many obscure as shining bodies of great size. It is not so\r\ndifficult, after all, then, to believe that there are immense\r\ncollections of shadowy gases and meteoric dust whose presence is only\r\nmanifested when they intercept the light coming from shining bodies\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nThis would account for the apparent extinguishment of light in open\r\nspace, which is indicated by the falling off in relative number of\r\ntelescopic stars below the tenth magnitude. Even as things are, the\r\namount of light coming to us from stars too faint to be seen with the\r\nnaked eye is so great that the statement of it generally surprises\r\npersons who are unfamiliar with the inner facts of astronomy. It has\r\nbeen calculated that on a clear night the total starlight from the\r\nentire celestial sphere amounts to one-sixtieth of the light of the\r\nfull moon; but of this less than one-twenty-fifth is due to stars\r\nseparately distinguished by the eye. If there were no obscuring medium\r\nin space, it is probable that the amount of starlight would be\r\nnoticeably and perhaps enormously increased.\r\n\r\nBut while it seems certain that some of the obscure spots in the Milky\r\nWay are due to the presence of “dark nebulæ,” or concealing veils of\r\none kind or another, it is equally certain that there are many which\r\nare true apertures, however they may have been formed, and by whatever\r\nforces they may be maintained. These, then, are veritable windows of\r\nthe Galaxy, and when looking out of them one is face to face with the\r\ngreat mystery of infinite space. _There_ the known universe visibly\r\nends, but manifestly space itself does not end there. It is not within\r\nthe power of thought to conceive an end to space, for the instant we\r\nthink of a terminal point or line the mind leaps forward to the\r\n_beyond._ There must be space outside as well as inside. Eternity of\r\ntime and infinity of space are ideas that the intellect cannot fully\r\ngrasp, but neither can it grasp the idea of a limitation to either\r\nspace or time. The metaphysical conceptions of hypergeometry, or\r\nfourth-dimensional space, do not aid us.\r\n\r\nHaving, then, discovered that the universe is a thing _contained_ in\r\nsomething indefinitely greater than itself; having looked out of its\r\nwindows and found only the gloom of starless night outside—what\r\nconclusions are we to draw concerning the beyond? It _seems_ as empty\r\nas a vacuum, but is it really so? If it be, then our universe is a\r\nsingle atom astray in the infinite; it is the only island in an ocean\r\nwithout shores; it is the one oasis in an illimitable desert. Then the\r\nMilky Way, with its wide-flung garland of stars, is afloat like a tiny\r\nsmoke-wreath amid a horror of immeasurable vacancy, or it is an\r\nevanescent and solitary ring of sparkling froth cast up for a moment on\r\nthe viewless billows of immensity. From such conclusions the mind\r\ninstinctively shrinks. It prefers to think that there is _something_\r\nbeyond, though we cannot see it. Even the universe could not bear to be\r\nalone—a Crusoe lost in the Cosmos! As the inhabitants of the most\r\nelegant château, with its gardens, parks, and crowds of attendants,\r\nwould die of loneliness if they did not know that they have neighbors,\r\nthough not seen, and that a living world of indefinite extent surrounds\r\nthem, so we, when we perceive that the universe has limits, wish to\r\nfeel that it is not solitary; that beyond the hedges and the hills\r\nthere are other centers of life and activity. Could anything be more\r\nterrible than the thought of an _isolated universe?_ The greater the\r\nbeing, the greater the aversion to seclusion. Only the infinite\r\nsatisfies; in that alone the mind finds rest.\r\n\r\nWe are driven, then, to believe that the universal night which\r\nenvelopes us is not tenantless; that as we stare out of the star-framed\r\nwindows of the Galaxy and see nothing but uniform blackness, the fault\r\nis with our eyes or is due to an obscuring medium. Since _our_ universe\r\nis limited in extent, there must be _other_ universes beyond it on all\r\nsides. Perhaps if we could carry our telescopes to the verge of the\r\ngreat “Coal-sack” near the “Cross,” being then on the frontier of our\r\nstarry system, we could discern, sparkling afar off in the vast night,\r\nsome of the outer galaxies. They may be grander than ours, just as many\r\nof the suns surrounding us are immensely greater than ours. If we could\r\ntake our stand somewhere in the midst of immensity and, with vision of\r\ninfinite reach, look about us, we should perhaps see a countless number\r\nof stellar systems, amid which ours would be unnoticeable, like a\r\nsingle star among the multitude glittering in the terrestial sky on a\r\nclear night. Some might be in the form of a wreath, like our own; some\r\nmight be globular, like the great star-clusters in Hercules and\r\nCentaurus; some might be glittering circles, or disks, or rings within\r\nrings. If we could enter them we should probably find a vast variety of\r\ncomposition, including elements unknown to terrestrial chemistry; for\r\nwhile the _visible_ universe appears to contain few if any substances\r\nnot existing on the earth or in the sun, we have no warrant to assume\r\nthat others may not exist in infinite space.\r\n\r\nAnd how as to gravitation? We do not _know_ that gravitation acts\r\nbeyond the visible universe, but it is reasonable to suppose that it\r\ndoes. At any rate, if we let go _its_ sustaining hand we are lost, and\r\ncan only wander hopelessly in our speculations, like children astray.\r\nIf the empire of gravitation is infinite, then the various outer\r\nsystems must have _some,_ though measuring by our standards an\r\nimperceptible, attractive influence upon each other, for gravitation\r\nnever lets go its hold, however great the space over which it is\r\nrequired to act. Just as the stars about us are all in motion, so the\r\nstarry systems beyond our sight may be in motion, and our system as a\r\nwhole may be moving in concert with them. If this be so, then after\r\ninterminable ages the aspect of the entire system of systems must\r\nchange, its various members assuming new positions with respect to one\r\nanother. In the course of time we may even suppose that our universe\r\nwill approach relatively close to one of the others; and then, if men\r\nare yet living on the earth, they may glimpse through the openings\r\nwhich reveal nothing to us now, the lights of another nearing star\r\nsystem, like the signals of a strange squadron, bringing them the\r\nassurance (which can be but an inference at present) that the ocean of\r\nspace has other argosies venturing on its limitless expanse.\r\n\r\nThere remains the question of the luminiferous ether by whose agency\r\nthe waves of light are borne through space. The ether is as mysterious\r\nas gravitation. With regard to ether we only infer its existence from\r\nthe effects which we ascribe to it. Evidently the ether must extend as\r\nfar as the most distant visible stars. But does it continue on\r\nindefinitely in outer space? If it does, then the invisibility of the\r\nother systems must be due to their distance diminishing the quantity of\r\nlight that comes from them below the limit of perceptibility, or to the\r\ninterposition of absorbing media; if it does not, then the reason why\r\nwe cannot see them is owing to the absence of a means of conveyance for\r\nthe light waves, as the lack of an interplanetary atmosphere prevents\r\nus from hearing the thunder of sun-spots. (It is interesting to recall\r\nthat Mr Edison was once credited with the intention to construct a\r\ngigantic microphone which should render the roar of sun-spots audible\r\nby transforming the electric vibrations into sound-waves). On this\r\nsupposition each starry system would be enveloped in its own globule of\r\nether, and no light could cross from one to another. But the\r\nprobability is that both the ether and gravitation are ubiquitous, and\r\nthat all the stellar systems are immersed in the former like clouds of\r\nphosphorescent organisms in the sea.\r\n\r\nSo astronomy carries the mind from height to greater height. Men were\r\nlong in accepting the proofs of the relative insignificance of the\r\nearth; they were more quickly convinced of the comparative littleness\r\nof the solar system; and now the evidence assails their reason that\r\nwhat they had regarded as _the_ universe is only one mote gleaming in\r\nthe sunbeams of Infinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nStar-Clouds, Star-Clusters, and Star-Streams\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen something of the strangely\r\ncomplicated structure of the Galaxy, or Milky Way. We now proceed to\r\nstudy more comprehensively that garlanded “Pathway of the Gods.”\r\n\r\nJudged by the eye alone, the Milky Way is one of the most delicately\r\nbeautiful phenomena in the entire realm of nature—a shimmer of silvery\r\ngauze stretched across the sky; but studied in the light of its\r\nrevelations, it is the most stupendous object presented to human ken.\r\nLet us consider, first, its appearance to ordinary vision. Its apparent\r\nposition in the sky shifts according to the season. On a serene,\r\ncloudless summer evening, in the absence of the moon, whose light\r\nobscures it, one sees the Galaxy spanning the heavens from north to\r\nsoutheast of the zenith like a phosphorescent arch. In early spring it\r\nforms a similar but, upon the whole, less brilliant arch west of the\r\nzenith. Between spring and summer it lies like a long, faint, twilight\r\nband along the northern horizon. At the beginning of winter it again\r\nforms an arch, this time spanning the sky from east to west, a little\r\nnorth of the zenith. These are its positions as viewed from the mean\r\nlatitude of the United States. Even the beginner in star-gazing does\r\nnot have to watch it throughout the year in order to be convinced that\r\nit is, in reality, a great circle, extending entirely around the\r\ncelestial sphere. We appear to be situated near its center, but its\r\nperiphery is evidently far away in the depths of space.\r\n\r\nAlthough to the casual observer it seems but a delicate scarf of light,\r\nbrighter in some places than in others, but hazy and indefinite at the\r\nbest, such is not its appearance to those who study it with care. They\r\nperceive that it is an organic whole, though marvelously complex in\r\ndetail. The telescope shows that it consists of stars too faint and\r\nsmall through excess of distance to be separately visible. Of the\r\nhundred million suns which some estimates have fixed as the probable\r\npopulation of the starry universe, the vast majority (at least thirty\r\nto one) are included in this strange belt of misty light. But they are\r\nnot uniformly distributed in it; on the contrary, they are arrayed in\r\nclusters, knots, bunches, clouds, and streams. The appearance is\r\nsomewhat as if the Galaxy consisted of innumerable swarms of\r\nsilver-winged bees, more or less intermixed, some massed together, some\r\ncrossing the paths of others, but all governed by a single purpose\r\nwhich leads them to encircle the region of space in which we are\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the systematic study of the heavens, the fact has\r\nbeen recognized that the form of the Milky Way denotes the scheme of\r\nthe sidereal system. At first it was thought that the shape of the\r\nsystem was that of a vast round disk, flat like a cheese, and filled\r\nwith stars, our sun and his relatively few neighbors being placed near\r\nthe center. According to this view, the galactic belt was an effect of\r\nperspective; for when looking in the direction of the plane of the\r\ndisk, the eye ranged through an immense extension of stars which\r\nblended into a glimmering blur, surrounding us like a ring; while when\r\nlooking out from the sides of the disk we saw but few stars, and in\r\nthose directions the heavens appeared relatively blank. Finally it was\r\nrecognized that this theory did not correspond with the observed\r\nappearances, and it became evident that the Milky Way was not a mere\r\neffect of perspective, but an actual band of enormously distant stars,\r\nforming a circle about the sphere, the central opening of the ring\r\n(containing many scattered stars) being many times broader than the\r\nwidth of the ring itself. Our sun is one of the scattered stars in the\r\ncentral opening.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the ring of the Galaxy is very irregular, and in\r\nplaces it is partly broken. With its sinuous outline, its pendant\r\nsprays, its graceful and accordant curves, its bunching of masses, its\r\noccasional interstices, and the manifest order of a general plan\r\ngoverning the jumble of its details, it bears a remarkable resemblance\r\nto a garland—a fact which appears the more wonderful when we recall its\r\ncomposition. That an elm-tree should trace the lines of beauty with its\r\nleafy and pendulous branches does not surprise us; but we can only gaze\r\nwith growing amazement when we behold _a hundred million suns imitating\r\nthe form of a chaplet!_ And then we have to remember that this form\r\nfurnishes the ground-plan of the universe.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the extraordinary speculations to which the mystery\r\nof the Milky Way has given rise, a theory recently (1909) proposed by\r\nProf. George C. Comstock may be mentioned. Starting with the data\r\n(first) that the number of stars increases as the Milky Way is\r\napproached, and reaches a maximum in its plane, while on the other hand\r\nthe number of nebulæ is greatest outside the Milky Way and increases\r\nwith distance from it, and (second) that the Milky Way, although a\r\ncomplete ring, is broad and diffuse on one side through one-half its\r\ncourse—that half alone containing nebulæ—and relatively narrow and well\r\ndefined on the opposite side, the author of this singular speculation\r\navers that these facts can best be explained by supposing that the\r\ninvisible universe consists of two interpenetrating parts, one of which\r\nis a chaos of indefinite extent, strewn with stars and nebulous dust,\r\nand the other a long, broad but comparatively thin cluster of stars,\r\nincluding the sun as one of its central members. This flat star-cluster\r\nis conceived to be moving edgewise through the chaos, and, according to\r\nProfessor Comstock, it acts after the manner of a snow-plough sweeping\r\naway the cosmic dust and piling it on either hand above and below the\r\nplane of the moving cluster. It thus forms a transparent rift, through\r\nwhich we see farther and command a view of more stars than through the\r\nintensified dust-clouds on either hand. This rift is the Milky Way. The\r\ndust thrown aside toward the poles of the Milky Way is the substance of\r\nthe nebulæ which abound there. Ahead, where the front of the\r\nstar-plough is clearing the way, the chaos is nearer at hand, and\r\nconsequently there the rift subtends a broader angle, and is filled\r\nwith primordial dust, which, having been annexed by the vanguard of the\r\nstar-swarm, forms the nebulæ seen only in that part of the Milky Way.\r\nBut behind, the rift appears narrow because there we look farther away\r\nbetween dust-clouds produced ages ago by the front of the plough, and\r\nno scattered dust remains in that part of the rift.\r\n\r\nIn quoting an outline of this strikingly original theory the present\r\nwriter should not be understood as assenting to it. That it appears\r\nbizarre is not, in itself, a reason for rejecting it, when we are\r\ndealing with so problematical and enigmatical a subject as the Milky\r\nWay; but the serious objection is that the theory does not sufficiently\r\naccord with the observed phenomena. There is too much evidence that the\r\nMilky Way is an organic system, however fantastic its form, to permit\r\nthe belief that it can only be a rift in chaotic clouds. As with every\r\norganism, we find that its parts are more or less clearly repeated in\r\nits ensemble. Among all the strange things that the Milky Way contains\r\nthere is nothing so extraordinary as itself. Every astronomer must many\r\ntimes have found himself marveling at it in those comparatively rare\r\nnights when it shows all its beauty and all its strangeness. In its\r\ngreat broken rifts, divisions, and spirals are found the gigantic\r\nprototypes of similar forms in its star-clouds and clusters. As we have\r\nsaid, it determines the general shape of the whole sidereal system.\r\nSome of the brightest stars in the sky appear to hang like jewels\r\nsuspended at the ends of tassels dropped from the Galaxy. Among these\r\npendants are the Pleiades and the Hyades. Orion, too, the “Mighty\r\nHunter,” is caught in “a loop of light” thrown out from it. The\r\nmajority of the great first-magnitude stars seem related to it, as if\r\nthey formed an inner ring inclined at an angle of some twenty degrees\r\nto its plane. Many of the long curves that set off from it on both\r\nsides are accompanied by corresponding curves of lucid stars. In a\r\nword, it offers every appearance of structural connection with the\r\nentire starry system. That the universe should have assumed the form of\r\na wreath is certainly a matter for astonishment; but it would have been\r\nstill more astonishing if it had been a cube, a rhomboid, or a\r\ndodecahedron, for then we should have had to suppose that something\r\nresembling the forces that shape crystals had acted upon the stars, and\r\nthe difficulty of explaining the universe by the laws of gravitation\r\nwould have been increased.\r\n\r\nFrom the Milky Way as a whole we pass to the vast clouds, swarms, and\r\nclusters of stars of which it is made up. It may be, as some\r\nastronomers hold, that most of the galactic stars are much smaller than\r\nthe sun, so that their faintness is not due entirely to the effect of\r\ndistance. Still, their intrinsic brilliance attests their solar\r\ncharacter, and considering their remoteness, which has been estimated\r\nat not less than ten thousand to twenty thousand light-years (a\r\nlight-year is equal to nearly six thousand thousand million miles)\r\ntheir actual masses cannot be extremely small. The minutest of them are\r\nentitled to be regarded as real suns, and they vary enormously in\r\nmagnitude. The effects of their attractions upon one another can only\r\nbe inferred from their clustering, because their relative movements are\r\nnot apparent on account of the brevity of the observations that we can\r\nmake. But imagine a being for whom a million years would be but as a\r\nflitting moment; to him the Milky Way would appear in a state of\r\nceaseless agitation—swirling with “a fury of whirlpool motion.”\r\n\r\nThe cloud-like aspect of large parts of the Galaxy must always have\r\nattracted attention, even from naked-eye observers, but the true\r\nstar-clouds were first satisfactorily represented in Barnard’s\r\nphotographs. The resemblance to actual clouds is often startling. Some\r\nare close-packed and dense, like cumuli; some are wispy or mottled,\r\nlike cirri. The rifts and modulations, as well as the general outlines,\r\nare the same as those of clouds of vapor or dust, and one notices also\r\nthe characteristic thinning out at the edges. But we must beware of\r\nsupposing that the component suns are thickly crowded as the particles\r\nforming an ordinary cloud. They _look,_ indeed, as if they were matted\r\ntogether, because of the irradiation of light, but in reality millions\r\nand billions of miles separate each star from its neighbors.\r\nNevertheless they form real assemblages, whose members are far more\r\nclosely related to one another than is our sun to the stars around him,\r\nand if we were in the Milky Way the aspect of the nocturnal sky would\r\nbe marvelously different from its present appearance.\r\n\r\nStellar clouds are characteristic of the Galaxy and are not found\r\nbeyond its borders, except in the “Magellanic Clouds” of the southern\r\nhemisphere, which resemble detached portions of the Milky Way. These\r\nsingular objects form as striking a peculiarity of the austral heavens\r\nas does the great “Coal-sack” described in Chapter 1. But it is their\r\nisolation that makes them so remarkable, for their composition is\r\nessentially galactic, and if they were included within its boundaries\r\nthey would not appear more wonderful than many other parts of the Milky\r\nWay. Placed where they are, they look like masses fallen from the great\r\nstellar arch. They are full of nebulæ and star-clusters, and show\r\nstriking evidences of spiral movement.\r\n\r\nStar-swarms, which are also characteristic features of the Galaxy,\r\ndiffer from star-clouds very much in the way that their name would\r\nimply—_i.e.,_ their component stars are so arranged, even when they are\r\ncountless in number, that the idea of an exceedingly numerous\r\nassemblage rather than that of a cloud is impressed on the observer’s\r\nmind. In a star-swarm the separate members are distinguishable because\r\nthey are either larger or nearer than the stars composing a “cloud.” A\r\nsplendid example of a true star-swarm is furnished by Chi Persei, in\r\nthat part of the Milky Way which runs between the constellations\r\nPerseus and Cassiopeia. This swarm is much coarser than many others,\r\nand can be seen by the naked eye. In a small telescope it appears\r\ndouble, as if the suns composing it had divided into two parties which\r\nkeep on their way side by side, with some commingling of their members\r\nwhere the skirts of the two companies come in contact.\r\n\r\nSmaller than either star-clouds or star-swarms, and differing from both\r\nin their organization, are star-clusters. These, unlike the others, are\r\nfound outside as well as inside the Milky Way, although they are more\r\nnumerous inside its boundaries than elsewhere. The term star-cluster is\r\nsometimes applied, though improperly, to assemblages which are rather\r\ngroups, such, for instance, as the Pleiades. In their most\r\ncharacteristic aspect star-clusters are of a globular shape—globes of\r\nsuns! A famous example of a globular star-cluster, but one not included\r\nin the Milky Way, is the “Great Cluster in Hercules.” This is barely\r\nvisible to the naked eye, but a small telescope shows its character,\r\nand in a large one it presents a marvelous spectacle. Photographs of\r\nsuch clusters are, perhaps, less effective than those of star-clouds,\r\nbecause the central condensation of stars in them is so great that\r\ntheir light becomes blended in an indistinguishable blur. The beautiful\r\neffect of the incessant play of infinitesimal rays over the apparently\r\ncompact surface of the cluster, as if it were a globe of the finest\r\nfrosted silver shining in an electric beam, is also lost in a\r\nphotograph. Still, even to the eye looking directly at the cluster\r\nthrough a powerful telescope, the central part of the wonderful\r\ncongregation seems almost a solid mass in which the stars are packed\r\nlike the ice crystals in a snowball.\r\n\r\nThe same question rises to the lips of every observer: How can they\r\npossibly have been brought into such a situation? The marvel does not\r\ngrow less when we know that, instead of being closely compacted, the\r\nstars of the cluster are probably separated by millions of miles; for\r\nwe know that their distances apart are slight as compared with their\r\nremoteness from the Earth. Sir William Herschel estimated their number\r\nto be about fourteen thousand, but in fact they are uncountable. If we\r\ncould view them from a point just within the edge of the assemblage,\r\nthey would offer the appearance of a hollow hemisphere emblazoned with\r\nstars of astonishing brilliancy; the near-by ones unparalleled in\r\nsplendor by any celestial object known to us, while the more distant\r\nones would resemble ordinary stars. An inhabitant of the cluster would\r\nnot know, except by a process of ratiocination, that he was dwelling in\r\na globular assemblage of suns; only from a point far outside would\r\ntheir spherical arrangement become evident to the eye. Imagine\r\nfourteen-thousand fire-balloons with an approach to regularity in a\r\nspherical space—say, ten miles in diameter; there would be an average\r\nof less than thirty in every cubic mile, and it would be necessary to\r\ngo to a considerable distance in order to see them as a globular\r\naggregation; yet from a point sufficiently far away they would blend\r\ninto a glowing ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Star-cluster in Hercules\r\n(Photographed with a two-foot reflector)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographs show even better than the best telescopic views that the\r\ngreat cluster is surrounded with a multitude of dispersed stars,\r\nsuggestively arrayed in more or less curving lines, which radiate from\r\nthe principle mass, with which their connection is manifest. These\r\nstars, situated outside the central sphere, look somewhat like vagrant\r\nbees buzzing round a dense swarm where the queen bee is sitting. Yet\r\nwhile there is so much to suggest the operation of central forces,\r\nbringing and keeping the members of the cluster together, the attentive\r\nobserver is also impressed with the idea that the whole wonderful\r\nphenomenon may be _the result of explosion._ As soon as this thought\r\nseizes the mind, confirmation of it seems to be found in the appearance\r\nof the outlying stars, which could be as readily explained by the\r\nsupposition that they have been blown apart as that they have flocked\r\ntogether toward a center. The probable fact that the stars constituting\r\nthe cluster are very much smaller than our sun might be regarded as\r\nfavoring the hypothesis of an explosion. Of their real size we know\r\nnothing, but, on the basis of an uncertain estimate of their parallax,\r\nit has been calculated that they may average forty-five thousand miles\r\nin diameter—something more than half the diameter of the planet\r\nJupiter. Assuming the same mean density, fourteen thousand such stars\r\nmight have been formed by the explosion of a body about twice the size\r\nof the sun. This recalls the theory of Olbers, which has never been\r\naltogether abandoned or disproved, that the Asteroids were formed by\r\nthe explosion of a planet circulating between the orbits of Mars and\r\nJupiter. The Asteroids, whatever their manner of origin, form a ring\r\naround the sun; but, of course, the explosion of a great independent\r\nbody, not originally revolving about a superior center of gravitational\r\nforce, would not result in the formation of a ring of small bodies, but\r\nrather of a dispersed mass of them. But back of any speculation of this\r\nkind lies the problem, at present insoluble: How could the explosion be\r\nproduced? (See the question of explosions in Chapters 6 and 14).\r\n\r\nThen, on the other hand, we have the observation of Herschel, since\r\nabundantly confirmed, that space is unusually vacant in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of condensed star-clusters and nebulæ, which, as far as it\r\ngoes, might be taken as an indication that the assembled stars had been\r\ndrawn together by their mutual attractions, and that the tendency to\r\naggregation is still bringing new members toward the cluster. But in\r\nthat case there must have been an original condensation of stars at\r\nthat point in space. This could probably have been produced by the\r\ncoagulation of a great nebula into stellar nuclei, a process which\r\nseems now to be taking place in the Orion Nebula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Great southern star-cluster, Omega Centauri]\r\n\r\n\r\nA yet more remarkable globular star-cluster exists in the southern\r\nhemisphere, Omega Centauri. In this case the central condensation of\r\nstars presents an almost uniform blaze of light. Like the Hercules\r\ncluster, that in Centaurus is surrounded with stars scattered over a\r\nbroad field and showing an appearance of radial arrangement. In fact,\r\nexcept for its greater richness, Omega Centauri is an exact duplicate\r\nof its northern rival. Each appears to an imaginative spectator as a\r\nveritable “city of suns.” Mathematics shrinks from the task of\r\ndisentangling the maze of motions in such an assemblage. It would seem\r\nthat the chance of collisions is not to be neglected, and this idea\r\nfinds a certain degree of confirmation in the appearance of “temporary\r\nstars” which have more than once blazed out in, or close by, globular\r\nstar-clusters.\r\n\r\nThis leads up to the notable fact, first established by Professor\r\nBailey a few years ago, that such clusters are populous with variable\r\nstars. Omega Centauri and the Hercules cluster are especially\r\nremarkable in this respect. The variables found in them are all of\r\nshort period and the changes of light show a noteworthy tendency to\r\nuniformity. The first thought is that these phenomena must be due to\r\ncollisions among the crowded stars, but, if so, the encounters cannot\r\nbe between the stars themselves, but probably between stars and meteor\r\nswarms revolving around them. Such periodic collisions might go on for\r\nages without the meteors being exhausted by incorporation with the\r\nstars. This explanation appears all the more probable because one would\r\nnaturally expect that flocks of meteors would abound in a close\r\naggregation of stars. It is also consistent with Perrine’s\r\ndiscovery—that the globular star clusters are powdered with minute\r\nstars strewn thickly among the brighter ones.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Professor Comstock’s extraordinary theory of the Milky\r\nWay, the fact was mentioned that, broadly speaking, the nebulæ are less\r\nnumerous in the galactic belt than in the comparatively open spaces on\r\neither side of it, but that they are, nevertheless, abundant in the\r\nbroader half of the Milky Way which he designates as the front of the\r\ngigantic “plough” supposed to be forcing its way through the enveloping\r\nchaos. In and around the Sagittarius region the intermingling of nebulæ\r\nand galactic star clouds and clusters is particularly remarkable. That\r\nthere is a causal connection no thoughtful person can doubt. We are\r\nunable to get away from the evidence that a nebula is like a\r\nseed-ground from which stars spring forth; or we may say that nebulæ\r\nresemble clouds in whose bosom raindrops are forming. The wonderful\r\naspect of the admixtures of nebulæ and star-clusters in Sagittarius has\r\nbeen described in Chapter 1. We now come to a still more extraordinary\r\nphenomenon of this kind—the Pleiades nebulæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pleiades]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of the Pleiades, although lying outside the main course of\r\nthe Galaxy, is connected with it by a faint loop, and is the scene of\r\nthe most remarkable association of stars and nebulous matter known in\r\nthe visible universe. The naked eye is unaware of the existence of\r\nnebulæ in the Pleiades, or, at the best, merely suspects that there is\r\nsomething of the kind there; and even the most powerful telescopes are\r\nfar from revealing the full wonder of the spectacle; but in photographs\r\nwhich have been exposed for many hours consecutively, in order to\r\naccumulate the impression of the actinic rays, the revelation is\r\nstunning. The principle stars are seen surrounded by, and, as it were,\r\n_drowned in,_ dense nebulous clouds of an unparalleled kind. The forms\r\nassumed by these clouds seem at first sight inexplicable. They look\r\nlike fleeces, or perhaps more like splashes and daubs of luminous paint\r\ndashed carelessly from a brush. But closer inspection shows that they\r\nare, to a large extent, _woven_ out of innumerable threads of filmy\r\ntexture, and there are many indications of spiral tendencies. Each of\r\nthe bright stars of the group—Alcyone, Merope, Maia, Electra, Taygeta,\r\nAtlas—is the focus of a dense fog (totally invisible, remember, alike\r\nto the naked eye and to the telescope), and these particular stars are\r\nveiled from sight behind the strange mists. Running in all directions\r\nacross the relatively open spaces are nebulous wisps and streaks of the\r\nmost curious forms. On some of the nebular lines, which are either\r\nstraight throughout, or if they change direction do so at an angle,\r\nlittle stars are strung like beads. In one case seven or eight stars\r\nare thus aligned, and, as if to emphasize their dependence upon the\r\nchain which connects them, when it makes a slight bend the file of\r\nstars turns the same way. Many other star rows in the group suggest by\r\ntheir arrangement that they, too, were once strung upon similar threads\r\nwhich have now disappeared, leaving the stars spaced along their\r\nancient tracks. We seem forced to the conclusion that there was a time\r\nwhen the Pleiades were embedded in a vast nebula resembling that of\r\nOrion, and that the cloud has now become so rare by gradual\r\ncondensation into stars that the merest trace of it remains, and this\r\nwould probably have escaped detection but for the remarkable actinic\r\npower of the radiant matter of which it consists. The richness of many\r\nof these faint nebulous masses in ultra-violet radiations, which are\r\nthose that specifically affect the photographic plate, is the cause of\r\nthe marvelous revelatory power of celestial photography. So the\r\nveritable unseen universe, as distinguished from the “unseen universe”\r\nof metaphysical speculation, is shown to us.\r\n\r\nA different kind of association between stars and nebulæ is shown in\r\nsome surprising photographic objects in the constellation Cygnus, where\r\nlong, wispy nebulæ, billions of miles in length, some of them looking\r\nlike tresses streaming in a breeze, lie amid fields of stars which seem\r\nrelated to them. But the relation is of a most singular kind, for\r\nnotwithstanding the delicate structure of the long nebulæ they appear\r\nto act as barriers, causing the stars to heap themselves on one side.\r\nThe stars are two, three, or four times as numerous on one side of the\r\nnebulæ as on the other. These nebulæ, as far as appearance goes, might\r\nbe likened to rail fences, or thin hedges, against which the wind is\r\ndriving drifts of powdery snow, which, while scattered plentifully all\r\naround, tends to bank itself on the leeward side of the obstruction.\r\nThe imagination is at a loss to account for these extraordinary\r\nphenomena; yet there they are, faithfully giving us their images\r\nwhenever the photographic plate is exposed to their radiations.\r\n\r\nThus the more we see of the universe with improved methods of\r\nobservation, and the more we invent aids to human senses, each enabling\r\nus to penetrate a little deeper into the unseen, the greater becomes\r\nthe mystery. The telescope carried us far, photography is carrying us\r\nstill farther; but what as yet unimagined instrument will take us to\r\nthe bottom, the top, and the end? And then, what hitherto untried power\r\nof thought will enable us to comprehend the meaning of it all?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nStellar Migrations\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the untrained eye the stars and the planets are not distinguishable.\r\nIt is customary to call them all alike “stars.” But since the planets\r\nmore or less rapidly change their places in the sky, in consequence of\r\ntheir revolution about the sun, while the stars proper seem to remain\r\nalways in the same relative positions, the latter are spoken of as\r\n“fixed stars.” In the beginnings of astronomy it was not known that the\r\n“fixed stars” had any motion independent of their apparent annual\r\nrevolution with the whole sky about the earth as a seeming center. Now,\r\nhowever, we know that the term “fixed stars” is paradoxical, for there\r\nis not a single really fixed object in the whole celestial sphere. The\r\napparent fixity in the positions of the stars is due to their immense\r\ndistance, combined with the shortness of the time during which we are\r\nable to observe them. It is like viewing the plume of smoke issuing\r\nfrom a steamer, hull down, at sea: if one does not continue to watch it\r\nfor a long time it appears to be motionless, although in reality it may\r\nbe traveling at great speed across the line of sight. Even the planets\r\nseem fixed in position if one watches them for a single night only, and\r\nthe more distant ones do not sensibly change their places, except after\r\nmany nights of observation. Neptune, for instance, moves but little\r\nmore than two degrees in the course of an entire year, and in a month\r\nits change of place is only about one-third of the diameter of the full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nYet, fixed as they seem, the stars are actually moving with a speed in\r\ncomparison with which, in some cases, the planets might almost be said\r\nto stand fast in their tracks. Jupiter’s speed in his orbit is about\r\neight miles per second, Neptune’s is less than three and one-half\r\nmiles, and the earth’s is about eighteen and one-half miles; while\r\nthere are “fixed stars” which move two hundred or three hundred miles\r\nper second. They do not all, however, move with so great a velocity,\r\nfor some appear to travel no faster than the planets. But in all cases,\r\nnotwithstanding their real speed, long-continued and exceedingly\r\ncareful observations are required to demonstrate that they are moving\r\nat all. No more overwhelming impression of the frightful depths of\r\nspace in which the stars are buried can be obtained than by reflecting\r\nupon the fact that a star whose actual motion across the line of sight\r\namounts to two hundred miles per second does not change its apparent\r\nplace in the sky, in the course of a thousand years, sufficiently to be\r\nnoticed by the casual observer of the heavens!\r\n\r\nThere is one vast difference between the motions of the stars and those\r\nof the planets to which attention should be at once called: the\r\nplanets, being under the control of a central force emanating from\r\ntheir immediate master, the sun, all move in the same direction and in\r\norbits concentric about the sun; the stars, on the other hand, move in\r\nevery conceivable direction and have no apparent center of motion, for\r\nall efforts to discover such a center have failed. At one time, when\r\ntheology had finally to accept the facts of science, a grandiose\r\nconception arose in some pious minds, according to which the Throne of\r\nGod was situated at the exact center of His Creation, and, seated\r\nthere, He watched the magnificent spectacle of the starry systems\r\nobediently revolving around Him. Astronomical discoveries and\r\nspeculations seemed for a time to afford some warrant for this view,\r\nwhich was, moreover, an acceptable substitute for the abandoned\r\ngeocentric theory in minds that could only conceive of God as a\r\nsuperhuman artificer, constantly admiring his own work. No longer ago\r\nthan the middle of the nineteenth century a German astronomer, Maedler,\r\nbelieved that he had actually found the location of the center about\r\nwhich the stellar universe revolved. He placed it in the group of the\r\nPleiades, and upon his authority an extraordinary imaginative picture\r\nwas sometimes drawn of the star Alcyone, the brightest of the Pleiades,\r\nas the very seat of the Almighty. This idea even seemed to gain a kind\r\nof traditional support from the mystic significance, without known\r\nhistorical origin, which has for many ages, and among widely separated\r\npeoples, been attached to the remarkable group of which Alcyone is the\r\nchief. But since Maedler’s time it has been demonstrated that the\r\nPleiades cannot be the center of revolution of the universe, and, as\r\nalready remarked, all attempts to find or fix such a center have proved\r\nabortive. Yet so powerful was the hold that the theory took upon the\r\npopular imagination, that even today astronomers are often asked if\r\nAlcyone is not the probable site of “Jerusalem the Golden.”\r\n\r\nIf there were a discoverable center of predominant gravitative power,\r\nto which the motions of all the stars could be referred, those motions\r\nwould appear less mysterious, and we should then be able to conclude\r\nthat the universe was, as a whole, a prototype of the subsidiary\r\nsystems of which it is composed. We should look simply to the law of\r\ngravitation for an explanation, and, naturally, the center would be\r\nplaced within the opening enclosed by the Milky Way. If it were there\r\nthe Milky Way itself should exhibit signs of revolution about it, like\r\na wheel turning upon its hub. No theory of the star motions as a whole\r\ncould stand which failed to take account of the Milky Way as the basis\r\nof all. But the very form of that divided wreath of stars forbids the\r\nassumption of its revolution about a center. Even if it could be\r\nconceived as a wheel having no material center it would not have the\r\nform which it actually presents. As was shown in Chapter 2, there is\r\nabundant evidence of motion in the Milky Way; but it is not motion of\r\nthe system as a whole, but motion affecting its separate parts. Instead\r\nof all moving one way, the galactic stars, as far as their movements\r\ncan be inferred, are governed by local influences and conditions. They\r\nappear to travel crosswise and in contrary directions, and perhaps they\r\neddy around foci where great numbers have assembled; but of a universal\r\nrevolution involving the entire mass we have no evidence.\r\n\r\nMost of our knowledge of star motions, called “proper motions,” relates\r\nto individual stars and to a few groups which happen to be so near that\r\nthe effects of their movements are measurable. In some cases the motion\r\nis so rapid (not in appearance, but in reality) that the chief\r\ndifficulty is to imagine how it can have been imparted, and what will\r\neventually become of the “runaways.” Without a collision, or a series\r\nof very close approaches to great gravitational centers, a star\r\ntraveling through space at the rate of two hundred or three hundred\r\nmiles per second could not be arrested or turned into an orbit which\r\nwould keep it forever flying within the limits of the visible universe.\r\nA famous example of these speeding stars is “1830 Groombridge,” a star\r\nof only the sixth magnitude, and consequently just visible to the naked\r\neye, whose motion across the line of sight is so rapid that it moves\r\nupon the face of the sky a distance equal to the apparent diameter of\r\nthe moon every 280 years. The distance of this star is at least\r\n200,000,000,000,000 miles, and may be two or three times greater, so\r\nthat its actual speed cannot be less than two hundred, and may be as\r\nmuch as four hundred, miles per second. It could be turned into a new\r\ncourse by a close approach to a great sun, but it could only be stopped\r\nby collision, head-on, with a body of enormous mass. Barring such\r\naccidents it must, as far as we can see, keep on until it has traversed\r\nour stellar system, whence in may escape and pass out into space\r\nbeyond, to join, perhaps, one of those other universes of which we have\r\nspoken. Arcturus, one of the greatest suns in the universe, is also a\r\nrunaway, whose speed of flight has been estimated all the way from\r\nfifty to two hundred miles per second. Arcturus, we have every reason\r\nto believe, possesses hundreds of times the mass of our sun—think,\r\nthen, of the prodigious momentum that its motion implies! Sirius moves\r\nmore moderately, its motion across the line of sight amounting to only\r\nten miles per second, but it is at the same time approaching the sun at\r\nabout the same speed, its actual velocity in space being the resultant\r\nof the two displacements.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about the motion of Sirius brings us to another\r\naspect of this subject. The fact is, that in every case of stellar\r\nmotion the displacement that we observe represents only a part of the\r\nactual movement of the star concerned. There are stars whose motion\r\ncarries them straight toward or straight away from the earth, and such\r\nstars, of course, show no cross motion. But the vast majority are\r\ntraveling in paths inclined from a perpendicular to our line of sight.\r\nTaken as a whole, the stars may be said to be flying about like the\r\nmolecules in a mass of gas. The discovery of the radial component in\r\nthe movements of the stars is due to the spectroscope. If a star is\r\napproaching, its spectral lines are shifted toward the violet end of\r\nthe spectrum by an amount depending upon the velocity of approach; if\r\nit is receding, the lines are correspondingly shifted toward the red\r\nend. Spectroscopic observation, then, combined with micrometric\r\nmeasurements of the cross motion, enables us to detect the real\r\nmovement of the star in space. Sometimes it happens that a star’s\r\nradial movement is periodically reversed; first it approaches, and then\r\nit recedes. This indicates that it is revolving around a near-by\r\ncompanion, which is often invisible, and superposed upon this motion is\r\nthat of the two stars concerned, which together may be approaching or\r\nreceding or traveling across the line of sight. Thus the complications\r\ninvolved in the stellar motions are often exceedingly great and\r\npuzzling.\r\n\r\nYet another source of complication exists in the movement of our own\r\nstar, the sun. There is no more difficult problem in astronomy than\r\nthat of disentangling the effects of the solar motion from those of the\r\nmotions of the other stars. But the problem, difficult as it is, has\r\nbeen solved, and upon its solution depends our knowledge of the speed\r\nand direction of the movement of the solar system through space, for of\r\ncourse the sun carries its planets with it. One element of the solution\r\nis found in the fact that, as a result of perspective, the stars toward\r\nwhich we are going appear to move apart toward all points of the\r\ncompass, while those behind appear to close up together. Then the\r\nspectroscopic principle already mentioned is invoked for studying the\r\nshift of the lines, which is toward the violet in the stars ahead of us\r\nand toward the red in those that we are leaving behind. Of course the\r\neffects of the independent motions of the stars must be carefully\r\nexcluded. The result of the studies devoted to this subject is to show\r\nthat we are traveling at a speed of twelve to fifteen miles per second\r\nin a northerly direction, toward the border of the constellations\r\nHercules and Lyra. A curious fact is that the more recent estimates\r\nshow that the direction is not very much out of a straight line drawn\r\nfrom the sun to the star Vega, one of the most magnificent suns in the\r\nheavens. But it should not be inferred from this that Vega is drawing\r\nus on; it is too distant for its gravitation to have such an effect.\r\n\r\nMany unaccustomed thoughts are suggested by this mighty voyage of the\r\nsolar system. Whence have we come, and whither do we go? Every year of\r\nour lives we advance at least 375,000,000 miles. Since the traditional\r\ntime of Adam the sun has led his planets through the wastes of space no\r\nless than 225,000,000,000 miles, or more than 2400 times the distance\r\nthat separates him from the earth. Go back in imagination to the\r\ngeologic ages, and try to comprehend the distance over which the earth\r\nhas flown. Where was our little planet when it emerged out of the\r\nclouds of chaos? Where was the sun when his “thunder march” began? What\r\nstrange constellations shone down upon our globe when its masters of\r\nlife were the monstrous beasts of the “Age of Reptiles”? A million\r\nyears is not much of a span of time in geologic reckoning, yet a\r\nmillion years ago the earth was farther from its present place in space\r\nthan any of the stars with a measurable parallax are now. It was more\r\nthan seven times as far as Sirius, nearly fourteen times as far as\r\nAlpha Centauri, three times as far as Vega, and twice as far as\r\nArcturus. But some geologists demand two hundred, three hundred, even\r\none thousand million years to enable them to account for the\r\nevolutionary development of the earth and its inhabitants. In a\r\nthousand million years the earth would have traveled farther than from\r\nthe remotest conceivable depths of the Milky Way!\r\n\r\nOther curious reflections arise when we think of the form of the\r\nearth’s track as it follows the lead of the sun, in a journey which has\r\nneither known beginning nor conceivable end. There are probably many\r\nminds which have found a kind of consolation in the thought that every\r\nyear the globe returns to the same place, on the same side of the sun.\r\nThis idea may have an occult connection with our traditional regard for\r\nanniversaries. When that period of the year returns at which any great\r\nevent in our lives has occurred we have the feeling that the earth, in\r\nits annual round, has, in a manner, brought us back to the scene of\r\nthat event. We think of the earth’s orbit as a well-worn path which we\r\ntraverse many times in the course of a lifetime. It seems familiar to\r\nus, and we grow to have a sort of attachment to it. The sun we are\r\naccustomed to regard as a fixed center in space, like the mill or pump\r\naround which the harnessed patient mule makes his endless circuits. But\r\nthe real fact is that the earth never returns to the place in space\r\nwhere it has once quitted. In consequence of the motion of the sun\r\ncarrying the earth and the other planets along, the track pursued by\r\nour globe is a vast spiral in space continually developing and never\r\nreturning upon its course. It is probable that the tracks of the sun\r\nand the others stars are also irregular, and possibly spiral, although,\r\nas far as can be at present determined, they appear to be practically\r\nstraight. Every star, wherever it may be situated, is attracted by its\r\nfellow-stars from many sides at once, and although the force is\r\nminimized by distance, yet in the course of many ages its effects must\r\nbecome manifest.\r\n\r\nLooked at from another side, is there not something immensely\r\nstimulating and pleasing to the imagination in the idea of so\r\nstupendous a journey, which makes all of us the greatest of travelers?\r\nIn the course of a long life a man is transported through space thirty\r\nthousand million miles; Halley’s Comet does not travel one-quarter as\r\nfar in making one of its immense circuits. And there are adventures on\r\nthis voyage of which we are just beginning to learn to take account.\r\nSpace is full of strange things, and the earth must encounter some of\r\nthem as it advances through the unknown. Many singular speculations\r\nhave been indulged in by astronomers concerning the possible effects\r\nupon the earth of the varying state of the space that it traverses.\r\nEven the alternation of hot and glacial periods has sometimes been\r\nascribed to this source. When tropical life flourished around the\r\npoles, as the remains in the rocks assure us, the needed high\r\ntemperature may, it has been thought, have been derived from the\r\npresence of the earth in a warm region of space. Then, too, there is a\r\ncertain interest for us in the thought of what our familiar planet has\r\npassed through. We cannot but admire it for its long journeying as we\r\nadmire the traveler who comes to us from remote and unexplored lands,\r\nor as we gaze with a glow of interest upon the first locomotive that\r\nhas crossed a continent, or a ship that has visited the Arctic or\r\nAntarctic regions. If we may trust the indications of the present\r\ncourse, the earth, piloted by the sun, has come from the Milky Way in\r\nthe far south and may eventually rejoin that mighty band of stars in\r\nthe far north.\r\n\r\nWhile the stars in general appear to travel independently of one\r\nanother, except when they are combined in binary or trinary systems,\r\nthere are notable exceptions to this rule. In some quarters of the sky\r\nwe behold veritable migrations of entire groups of stars whose members\r\nare too widely separated to show any indications of revolution about a\r\ncommon center of gravity. This leads us back again to the wonderful\r\ngroup of the Pleiades. All of the principle stars composing that group\r\nare traveling in virtually parallel lines. Whatever force set them\r\ngoing evidently acted upon all alike. This might be explained by the\r\nassumption that when the original projective force acted upon them they\r\nwere more closely united than they are at present, and that in drifting\r\napart they have not lost the impulse of the primal motion. Or it may be\r\nsupposed that they are carried along by some current in space, although\r\nit would be exceedingly difficult, in the present state of our\r\nknowledge, to explain the nature of such a current. Yet the theory of a\r\ncurrent has been proposed. As to an attractive center around which they\r\nmight revolve, none has been found. Another instance of similar\r\n“star-drift” is furnished by five of the seven stars constituting the\r\nfigure of the “Great Dipper.” In this case the stars concerned are\r\nseparated very widely, the two extreme ones by not less than fifteen\r\ndegrees, so that the idea of a common motion would never have been\r\nsuggested by their aspect in the sky; and the case becomes the more\r\nremarkable from the fact that among and between them there are other\r\nstars, some of the same magnitude, which do not share their motion, but\r\nare traveling in other directions. Still other examples of the same\r\nphenomenon are found in other parts of the sky. Of course, in the case\r\nof compact star-clusters, it is assumed that all the members share a\r\nlike motion of translation through space, and the same is probably true\r\nof dense star-swarms and star-clouds.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of star-drift has lately assumed a new phase, in\r\nconsequence of the investigations of Kapteyn, Dyson, and Eddington on\r\nthe “systematic motions of the stars.” This research will, it is hoped,\r\nlead to an understanding of the general law governing the movements of\r\nthe whole body of stars constituting the visible universe. Taking about\r\neleven hundred stars whose proper motions have been ascertained with an\r\napproach to certainty, and which are distributed in all parts of the\r\nsky, it has been shown that there exists an apparent double drift, in\r\ntwo independent streams, moving in different and nearly opposed\r\ndirections. The apex of the motion of what is called “Stream I” is\r\nsituated, according to Professor Kapteyn, in right ascension 85°,\r\ndeclination south 11°, which places it just south of the constellation\r\nOrion; while the apex of “Stream II” is in right ascension 260°,\r\ndeclination south 48°, placing it in the constellation Ara, south of\r\nScorpio. The two apices differ very nearly 180° in right ascension and\r\nabout 120° in declination. The discovery of these vast star-streams, if\r\nthey really exist, is one of the most extraordinary in modern\r\nastronomy. It offers the correlation of stellar movements needed as the\r\nbasis of a theory of those movements, but it seems far from revealing a\r\nphysical cause for them. As projected against the celestial sphere the\r\nstars forming the two opposite streams appear intermingled, some\r\nobeying one tendency and some the other. As Professor Dyson has said,\r\nthe hypothesis of this double movement is of a revolutionary character,\r\nand calls for further investigation. Indeed, it seems at first glance\r\nnot less surprising than would be the observation that in a snow-storm\r\nthe flakes over our heads were divided into two parties and driving\r\nacross each other’s course in nearly opposite directions, as if urged\r\nby interpenetrating winds.\r\n\r\nBut whatever explanation may eventually be found for the motions of the\r\nstars, the knowledge of the existence of those motions must always\r\nafford a new charm to the contemplative observer of the heavens, for\r\nthey impart a sense of life to the starry system that would otherwise\r\nbe lacking. A stagnant universe, with every star fixed immovably in its\r\nplace, would not content the imagination or satisfy our longing for\r\nceaseless activity. The majestic grandeur of the evolutions of the\r\ncelestial hosts, the inconceivable vastness of the fields of space in\r\nwhich they are executed, the countless numbers, the immeasurable\r\ndistances, the involved convolutions, the flocking and the scattering,\r\nthe interpenetrating marches and countermarches, the strange community\r\nof impulsion affecting stars that are wide apart in space and causing\r\nthem to traverse the general movement about them like aides and\r\ndespatch-bearers on a battle-field—all these arouse an intensity of\r\ninterest which is heightened by the mystery behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nThe Passing of the Constellations\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a historical and picturesque point of view, one of the most\r\nstriking results of the motions of the stars described in the last\r\nchapter is their effect upon the forms of the constellations, which\r\nhave been watched and admired by mankind from a period so early that\r\nthe date of their invention is now unknown. The constellations are\r\nformed by chance combinations of conspicuous stars, like figures in a\r\nkaleidoscope, and if our lives were commensurate with the æons of\r\ncosmic existence we should perceive that the kaleidoscope of the\r\nheavens was ceaselessly turning and throwing the stars into new\r\nsymmetries. Even if the stars stood fast, the motion of the solar\r\nsystem would gradually alter the configurations, as the elements of a\r\nlandscape dissolve and recombine in fresh groupings with the traveler’s\r\nprogress amid them. But with the stars themselves all in motion at\r\nvarious speeds and in many directions, the changes occur more rapidly.\r\nOf course, “rapid” is here understood in a relative sense; the wheel of\r\nhuman history to an eye accustomed to the majestic progression of the\r\nuniverse would appear to revolve with the velocity of a whirling\r\ndynamo. Only the deliberation of geological movements can be contrasted\r\nwith the evolution and devolution of the constellations.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this secular fluctuation of the constellation figures is not\r\nwithout keen interest for the meditative observer. It is another\r\nreminder of the swift mutability of terrestial affairs. To the passing\r\nglance, which is all that we can bestow upon these figures, they appear\r\nso immutable that they have been called into service to form the most\r\nlasting records of ancient thought and imagination that we possess. In\r\nthe forms of the constellations, the most beautiful, and, in\r\nimaginative quality, the finest, mythology that the world has ever\r\nknown has been perpetuated. Yet, in a broad sense, this scroll of human\r\nthought imprinted on the heavens is as evanescent as the summer clouds.\r\nAlthough more enduring than parchment, tombs, pyramids, and temples, it\r\nis as far as they from truly eternizing the memory of what man has\r\nfancied and done.\r\n\r\nBefore studying the effects that the motions of the stars have had and\r\nwill have upon the constellations, it is worth while to consider a\r\nlittle further the importance of the stellar pictures as archives of\r\nhistory. To emphasize the importance of these effects it is only\r\nnecessary to recall that the constellations register the oldest\r\ntraditions of our race. In the history of primeval religions they are\r\nthe most valuable of documents. Leaving out of account for the moment\r\nthe more familiar mythology of the Greeks, based on something older\r\nyet, we may refer for illustration to that of the mysterious Maya race\r\nof America. At Izamal, in Yucatan, says Mr Stansbury Hagar, is a group\r\nof ruins perched, after the Mexican and Central-American plan, on the\r\nsummits of pyramidal mounds which mark the site of an ancient theogonic\r\ncenter of the Mayas. Here the temples all evidently refer to a cult\r\nbased upon the constellations as symbols. The figures and the names, of\r\ncourse, were not the same as those that we have derived from our Aryan\r\nancestors, but the star groups were the same or nearly so. For\r\ninstance, the loftiest of the temples at Izamal was connected with the\r\nsign of the constellation known to us as Cancer, marking the place of\r\nthe sun at the summer solstice, at which period the sun was supposed to\r\ndescend at noon like a great bird of fire and consume the offerings\r\nleft upon the altar. Our Scorpio was known to the Mayas as a sign of\r\nthe “Death God.” Our Libra, the “Balance,” with which the idea of a\r\ndivine weighing out of justice has always been connected, seems to be\r\nidentical with the Mayan constellation Teoyaotlatohua, with which was\r\nassociated a temple where dwelt the priests whose special business it\r\nwas to administer justice and to foretell the future by means of\r\ninformation obtained from the spirits of the dead. Orion, the “Hunter”\r\nof our celestial mythology, was among the Mayas a “Warrior,” while\r\nSagittarius and others of our constellations were known to them (under\r\ndifferent names, of course), and all were endowed with a religious\r\nsymbolism. And the same star figures, having the same significance,\r\nwere familiar to the Peruvians, as shown by the temples at Cuzco. Thus\r\nthe imagination of ancient America sought in the constellations symbols\r\nof the unchanging gods.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, there is no nation and no people that has not recognized\r\nthe constellations, and at one period or another in its history\r\nemployed them in some symbolic or representative capacity. As handled\r\nby the Greeks from prehistoric times, the constellation myths became\r\nthe very soul of poetry. The imagination of that wonderful race\r\nidealized the principal star groups so effectively that the figures and\r\ntraditions thus attached to them have, for civilized mankind, displaced\r\nall others, just as Greek art in its highest forms stands without\r\nparallel and eclipses every rival. The Romans translated no heroes and\r\nheroines of the mythical period of their history to the sky, and the\r\ndeified Cæsars never entered that lofty company, but the heavens are\r\nfilled with the early myths of the Greeks. Herakles nightly resumes his\r\nmighty labors in the stars; Zeus, in the form of the white “Bull,”\r\nTaurus, bears the fair Europa on his back through the celestial waves;\r\nAndromeda stretches forth her shackled arms in the star-gemmed ether,\r\nbeseeching aid; and Perseus, in a blaze of diamond armor, revives his\r\nheroic deeds amid sparkling clouds of stellar dust. There, too, sits\r\nQueen Cassiopeia in her dazzling chair, while the Great King, Cepheus,\r\ntowers gigantic over the pole. Professor Young has significantly\r\nremarked that a great number of the constellations are connected in\r\nsome way or other with the Argonautic Expedition—that strangely\r\nfascinating legend of earliest Greek story which has never lost its\r\ncharm for mankind. In view of all this, we may well congratulate\r\nourselves that the constellations will outlast our time and the time of\r\ncountless generations to follow us; and yet they are very far from\r\nbeing eternal. Let us now study some of the effects of the stellar\r\nmotions upon them.\r\n\r\nWe begin with the familiar figure of the “Great Dipper.” He who has not\r\ndrunk inspiration from its celestial bowl is not yet admitted to the\r\ncircle of Olympus. This figure is made up of seven conspicuous stars in\r\nthe constellation Ursa Major, the “Greater Bear.” The handle of the\r\n“Dipper” corresponds to the tail of the imaginary “Bear,” and the bowl\r\nlies upon his flank. In fact, the figure of a dipper is so evident and\r\nthat of a bear so unevident, that to most persons the “Great Dipper” is\r\nthe only part of the constellation that is recognizable. Of the seven\r\nstars mentioned, six are of nearly equal brightness, ranking as of the\r\nsecond magnitude, while the seventh is of only the third magnitude. The\r\ndifference is very striking, since every increase of one magnitude\r\ninvolves an increase of two-and-a-half times in brightness. There\r\nappears to be little doubt that the faint star, which is situated at\r\nthe junction of the bowl and the handle, is a variable of long period,\r\nsince three hundred years ago it was as bright as its companions. But\r\nhowever that may be, its relative faintness at the present time\r\ninterferes but little with the perfection of the “Dipper’s” figure. In\r\norder the more readily to understand the changes which are taking\r\nplace, it will be well to mention both the names and the Greek letters\r\nwhich are attached to the seven stars. Beginning at the star in the\r\nupper outer edge of the rim of the bowl and running in regular order\r\nround the bottom and then out to the end of the handle, the names and\r\nletters are as follows: Dubhe (α), Merak (β), Phaed (γ), Megrez (δ),\r\nAlioth (ε), Mizar (ζ), and Benetnasch (η). Megrez is the faint star\r\nalready mentioned at the junction of the bowl and handle, and Mizar, in\r\nthe middle of the handle, has a close, naked-eye companion which is\r\nnamed Alcor. The Arabs called this singular pair of stars “The Horse\r\nand Rider.” Merak and Duhbe are called “The Pointers,” because an\r\nimaginary line drawn northward through them indicates the Pole Star.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Great Dipper”]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it has been found that five of these stars—_viz.,_ Merak, Phaed,\r\nMegrez, Alioth, and Mizar (with its comrade)—are moving with\r\npractically the same speed in an easterly direction, while the other\r\ntwo, Dubhe and Benetnasch, are simultaneously moving westward, the\r\nmotions of Benetnasch being apparently more rapid. The consequence of\r\nthese opposed motions is, of course, that the figure of the “Dipper”\r\ncannot always have existed and will not continue to exist. In the\r\naccompanying diagrams it has been thought interesting to show the\r\nrelative positions of these seven stars, as seen from the point which\r\nthe earth now occupies, both in the past and in the future. Arrows\r\nattached to the stars in the figure representing the present appearance\r\nof the “Dipper” indicate the directions of the motions and the\r\ndistances over which they will carry the stars in a period of about\r\nfive hundred centuries. The time, no doubt, seems long, but remember\r\nthe vast stretch of ages through which the earth has passed, and then\r\nreflect that no reason is apparent why our globe should not continue to\r\nbe a scene of animation for ten thousand centuries yet to come. The\r\nfact that the little star Alcor placed so close to Mizar should\r\naccompany the latter in its flight is not surprising, but that two of\r\nthe principal stars of the group should be found moving in a direction\r\ndirectly opposed to that pursued by the other five is surprising in the\r\nhighest degree; and it recalls the strange theory of a double drift\r\naffecting all the stars, to which attention was called in the preceding\r\nchapter. It would appear that Benetnasch and Dubhe belong to one\r\n“current,” and Merak, Phaed, Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar to the other. As\r\nfar as is known, the motion of the seven stars are not shared by the\r\nsmaller stars scattered about them, but on the theory of currents there\r\nshould be such a community of motion, and further investigation may\r\nreveal it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cassiopeia]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the “Great Dipper” we turn to a constellation hardly less\r\nconspicuous and situated at an equal distance from the pole on the\r\nother side—Cassiopeia. This famous star-group commemorating the\r\nromantic Queen of Ethiopia whose vain boasting of her beauty was\r\npunished by the exposure of her daughter Andromeda to the “Sea\r\nMonster,” is well-marked by five stars which form an irregular letter\r\n“W” with its open side toward the pole. Three of these stars are\r\nusually ranked as of the second magnitude, and two of the third; but to\r\nordinary observation they appear of nearly equal brightness, and\r\npresent a very striking picture. They mark out the chair and a part of\r\nthe figure of the beautiful queen. Beginning at the right-hand, or\r\nwestern, end of the “W,” their Greek letter designations are: Beta (β),\r\nAlpha (α), Gamma (γ), Delta (δ), and Epsilon (ε). Four of them, Beta,\r\nAlpha, Delta, and Epsilon are traveling eastwardly at various speeds,\r\nwhile the fifth, Gamma, moves in a westerly direction. The motion of\r\nBeta is more rapid than that of any of the others. It should be said,\r\nhowever, that no little uncertainty attaches to the estimates of the\r\nrate of motion of stars which are not going very rapidly, and different\r\nobservers often vary considerably in their results.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful “Northern Crown,” one of the most perfect and charming\r\nof all the figures to be found in the stars, the alternate combining\r\nand scattering effects of the stellar motions are shown by comparing\r\nthe appearance which the constellation must have had five hundred\r\ncenturies ago with that which it has at present and that which it will\r\nhave in the future. The seven principle stars of the asterism, forming\r\na surprisingly perfect coronet, have movements in three directions at\r\nright angles to one another. That in these circumstances they should\r\never have arrived at positions giving them so striking an appearance of\r\ndefinite association is certainly surprising; from its aspect one would\r\nhave expected to find a community of movement governing the brilliants\r\nof the “Crown,” but instead of that we find evidence that they will\r\ninevitably drift apart and the beautiful figure will dissolve.\r\n\r\nA similar fate awaits such asterisms as the “Northern Cross” in Cygnus;\r\nthe “Crow” (Corvus), which stands on the back of the great “Sea\r\nSerpent,” Hydra, and pecks at his scales; “Job’s Coffin” (Delphinus);\r\nthe “Great Square of Pegasus”; the “Twins” (Gemini); the beautiful\r\n“Sickle” in Leo; and the exquisite group of the Hyades in Taurus. In\r\nthe case of the Hyades, two controlling movements are manifest: one,\r\naffecting five of the stars which form the well-known figure of a\r\nletter “V,” is directed northerly; the other, which controls the\r\ndirection of two stars, has an easterly trend. The chief star of the\r\ngroup, Aldebaran, one of the finest of all stars both for its\r\nbrilliance and its color, is the most affected by the easterly motion.\r\nIn time it will drift entirely out of connection with its present\r\nneighbors. Although the Hyades do not form so compact a group as the\r\nPleiades in the same constellation, yet their appearance of\r\nrelationship is sufficient to awaken a feeling of surprise over the\r\nfact that, as with the stars of the “Dipper,” their association is only\r\ntemporary or apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Northern Crown”]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great figure of Orion appears to be more lasting, not because its\r\nstars are physically connected, but because of their great distance,\r\nwhich renders their movements too deliberate to be exactly ascertained.\r\nTwo of the greatest of its stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, possess, as far\r\nas has been ascertained, no perceptible motion across the line of\r\nsight, but there is a little movement perceptible in the “Belt.” At the\r\npresent time this consists of an almost perfect straight line, a row of\r\nsecond-magnitude stars about equally spaced and of the most striking\r\nbeauty. In the course of time, however, the two right-hand stars,\r\nMintaka and Alnilam (how fine are these Arabic star names!) will\r\napproach each other and form a naked-eye double, but the third, Alnita,\r\nwill drift away eastward, so that the “Belt” will no longer exist.\r\n\r\nFor one more example, let us go to the southern hemisphere, whose most\r\ncelebrated constellation, the “Southern Cross,” has found a place in\r\nall modern literatures, although it has no claim to consideration on\r\naccount of association with ancient legends. This most attractive\r\nasterism, which has never ceased to fascinate the imagination of\r\nChristendom since it was first devoutly described by the early\r\nexplorers of the South, is but a passing collocation of brilliant\r\nstars. Yet even in its transfigurations it has been for hundreds of\r\ncenturies, and will continue to be for hundreds of centuries to come, a\r\nmost striking object in the sky. Our figures show its appearance in\r\nthree successive phases: first, as it was fifty thousand years ago\r\n(viewed from the earth’s present location); second, as it is in our\r\nday; and, third, as it will be an equal time in the future. The\r\nnearness of these bright stars to one another—the length of the longer\r\nbeam of the “Cross” is only sixdegrees—makes this group very\r\nnoticeable, whatever the arrangement of its components may be. The\r\nlargest star, at the base of the “Cross,” is of the first magnitude,\r\ntwo of the others are of the second magnitude, and the fourth is of the\r\nthird. Other stars, not represented in the figures, increase the effect\r\nof a celestial blazonry, although they do not help the resemblance to a\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The “Southern Cross”]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since the motion of the solar system itself will, in the course of\r\nso long a period as fifty thousand years, produce a great change in the\r\nperspective of the heavens as seen from the earth, by carrying us\r\nnearly nineteen trillion miles from our present place, why, it may be\r\nasked, seek to represent future appearances of the constellations which\r\nwe could not hope to see, even if we could survive so long? The answer\r\nis: Because these things aid the mind to form a picture of the effects\r\nof the mobility of the starry universe. Only by showing the changes\r\nfrom some definite point of view can we arrive at a due comprehension\r\nof them. The constellations are more or less familiar to everybody, so\r\nthat impending changes of their forms must at once strike the eye and\r\nthe imagination, and make clearer the significance of the movements of\r\nthe stars. If the future history of mankind is to resemble its past and\r\nif our race is destined to survive yet a million years, then our remote\r\ndescendents will see a “new heavens” if not a “new earth,” and will\r\nhave to invent novel constellations to perpetuate their legends and\r\nmythologies.\r\n\r\nIf our knowledge of the relative distances of the stars were more\r\ncomplete, it would be an interesting exercise in celestial geometry to\r\nproject the constellations probably visible to the inhabitants of\r\nworlds revolving around some of the other suns of space. Our sun is too\r\ninsignificant for us to think that he can make a conspicuous appearance\r\namong them, except, perhaps, in a few cases. As seen, for instance,\r\nfrom the nearest known star, Alpha Centauri, the sun would appear of\r\nthe average first magnitude, and consequently from that standpoint he\r\nmight be the gem of some little constellation which had no Sirius, or\r\nArcturus, or Vega to eclipse him with its superior splendor. But from\r\nthe distance of the vast majority of the stars the sun would probably\r\nbe invisible to the naked eye, and as seen from nearer systems could\r\nonly rank as a fifth or sixth magnitude star, unnoticed and unknown\r\nexcept by the star-charting astronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nConflagrations in the Heavens\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose it were possible for the world to take fire and burn up—as some\r\npessimists think that it will do when the Divine wrath shall have\r\nsufficiently accumulated against it—nobody out of our own little corner\r\nof space would ever be aware of the catastrophe! With all their\r\ntelescopes, the astronomers living in the golden light of Arcturus or\r\nthe diamond blaze of Canopus would be unable to detect the least\r\nglimmer of the conflagration that had destroyed the seat of Adam and\r\nhis descendents, just as now they are totally ignorant of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nBut at least fifteen times in the course of recorded history men\r\nlooking out from the earth have beheld in the remote depths of space\r\ngreat outbursts of fiery light, some of them more splendidly luminous\r\nthan anything else in the firmament except the sun! If _they_ were\r\nconflagrations, how many million worlds like ours were required to feed\r\ntheir blaze?\r\n\r\nIt is probable that “temporary” or “new” stars, as these wonderful\r\napparitions are called, really are conflagrations; not in the sense of\r\na bonfire or a burning house or city, but in that of a sudden eruption\r\nof inconceivable heat and light, such as would result from the\r\nstripping off the shell of an encrusted sun or the crashing together of\r\ntwo mighty orbs flying through space with a hundred times the velocity\r\nof the swiftest cannon-shot.\r\n\r\nTemporary stars are the rarest and most erratic of astronomical\r\nphenomena. The earliest records relating to them are not very clear,\r\nand we cannot in every instance be certain that it was one of these\r\nappearances that the ignorant and superstitious old chroniclers are\r\ntrying to describe. The first temporary star that we are absolutely\r\nsure of appeared in 1572, and is known as “Tycho’s Star,” because the\r\ncelebrated Danish astronomer (whose remains, with his gold-and-silver\r\nartificial nose—made necessary by a duel—still intact, were disinterred\r\nand reburied in 1901) was the first to perceive it in the sky, and the\r\nmost assiduous and successful in his studies of it. As the first fully\r\naccredited representative of its class, this new star made its entry\r\nupon the scene with becoming _éclat._ It is characteristic of these\r\nphenomena that they burst into view with amazing suddenness, and, of\r\ncourse, entirely unexpectedly. Tycho’s star appeared in the\r\nconstellation Cassiopeia, near a now well-known and much-watched little\r\nstar named Kappa, on the evening of November 11, 1572. The story has\r\noften been repeated, but it never loses interest, how Tycho, going home\r\nthat evening, saw people in the street pointing and staring at the sky\r\ndirectly over their heads, and following the direction of their hands\r\nand eyes he was astonished to see, near the zenith, an unknown star of\r\nsurpassing brilliance. It outshone the planet Jupiter, and was\r\ntherefore far brighter than the first magnitude. There was not another\r\nstar in the heavens that could be compared with it in splendor. Tycho\r\nwas not in all respects free from the superstitions of his time—and who\r\nis?—but he had the true scientific instinct, and immediately he began\r\nto study the stranger, and to record with the greatest care every\r\nchange in its aspect. First he determined as well as he could with the\r\nimperfect instruments of his day, many of which he himself had\r\ninvented, the precise location of the phenomena in the sky. Then he\r\nfollowed the changes that it underwent. At first it brightened until\r\nits light equaled or exceeded that of the planet Venus at her\r\nbrightest, a statement which will be appreciated at its full value by\r\nanyone who has ever watched Venus when she plays her dazzling rôle of\r\n“Evening Star,” flaring like an arc light in the sunset sky. It even\r\nbecame so brilliant as to be visible in full daylight, since, its\r\nposition being circumpolar, it never set in the latitude of Northern\r\nEurope. Finally it began to fade, turning red as it did so, and in\r\nMarch, 1574, it disappeared from Tycho’s searching gaze, and has never\r\nbeen seen again from that day to this. None of the astronomers of the\r\ntime could make anything of it. They had not yet as many bases of\r\nspeculation as we possess today.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chart showing location of Tycho’s star, 1572,  and Nova\r\nPersei of 1901]\r\n\r\n\r\nTycho’s star has achieved a romantic reputation by being fancifully\r\nidentified with the “Star of Bethlehem,” said to have led the wondering\r\nMagi from their eastern deserts to the cradle-manger of the Savior in\r\nPalestine. Many attempts have been made to connect this traditional\r\n“star” with some known phenomenon of the heavens, and none seems more\r\nidle than this. Yet it persistently survives, and no astronomer is free\r\nfrom eager questions about it addressed by people whose imagination has\r\nbeen excited by the legend. It is only necessary to say that the\r\nsupposition of a connection between the phenomenon of the Magi and\r\nTycho’s star is without any scientific foundation. It was originally\r\nbased on an unwarranted assumption that the star of Tycho was a\r\nvariable of long period, appearing once every three hundred and fifteen\r\nyears, or thereabout. If that were true there would have been an\r\napparition somewhere near the traditional date of the birth of Christ,\r\na date which is itself uncertain. But even the data on which the\r\nassumption was based are inconsistent with the theory. Certain monkish\r\nrecords speak of something wonderful appearing in the sky in the years\r\n1264 and 945, and these were taken to have been outbursts of Tycho’s\r\nstar. Investigation shows that the records more probably refer to\r\ncomets, but even if the objects seen were temporary stars, their dates\r\ndo not suit the hypothesis; from 945 to 1264 there is a gap of 319\r\nyears, and from 1264 to 1572 one of only 308 years; moreover 337 years\r\nhave now (1909) elapsed since Tycho saw the last glimmer of his star.\r\nUpon a variability so irregular and uncertain as that, even if we felt\r\nsure that it existed, no conclusion could be found concerning an\r\napparition occurring 2000 years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1600 (the year in which Giordano Bruno was burned at the\r\nstake for teaching that there is more than one physical world), a\r\ntemporary star of the third magnitude broke out in the constellation\r\nCygnus, and curiously enough, considering the rarity of such phenomena,\r\nonly four years later another surprisingly brilliant one appeared in\r\nthe constellation Ophiuchus. This is often called “Kepler’s star,”\r\nbecause the great German astronomer devoted to it the same attention\r\nthat Tycho had given to the earlier phenomenon. It, too, like Tycho’s,\r\nwas at first the brightest object in the stellar heavens, although it\r\nseems never to have quite equaled its famous predecessor in splendor.\r\nIt disappeared after a year, also turning of a red color as it became\r\nmore faint. We shall see the significance of this as we go on. Some of\r\nKepler’s contemporaries suggested that the outburst of this star was\r\ndue to a meeting of atoms in space, and idea bearing a striking\r\nresemblance to the modern theory of “astronomical collisions.”\r\n\r\nIn 1670, 1848, and 1860 temporary stars made their appearance, but none\r\nof them was of great brilliance. In 1866 one of the second magnitude\r\nbroke forth in the “Northern Crown” and awoke much interest, because by\r\nthat time the spectroscope had begun to be employed in studying the\r\ncomposition of the stars, and Huggins demonstrated that the new star\r\nconsisted largely of incandescent hydrogen. But this star, apparently\r\nunlike the others mentioned, was not absolutely new. Before its\r\noutburst it had shown as a star of the ninth magnitude (entirely\r\ninvisible, of course, to the naked eye), and after about six weeks it\r\nfaded to its original condition in which it has ever since remained. In\r\n1876 a temporary star appeared in the constellation Cygnus, and\r\nattained at one time the brightness of the second magnitude. Its\r\nspectrum and its behavior resembled those of its immediate predecessor.\r\nIn 1885, astronomers were surprised to see a sixth-magnitude star\r\nglimmering in the midst of the hazy cloud of the great Andromeda\r\nNebula. It soon absolutely disappeared. Its spectrum was remarkable for\r\nbeing “continuous,” like that of the nebula itself. A continuous\r\nspectrum is supposed to represent a body, or a mass, which is either\r\nsolid or liquid, or composed of gas under great pressure. In January,\r\n1892, a new star was suddenly seen in the constellation Auriga. It\r\nnever rose much above the fourth magnitude, but it showed a peculiar\r\nspectrum containing both bright and dark lines of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nBut a bewildering surprise was now in store; the world was to behold at\r\nthe opening of the twentieth century such a celestial spectacle as had\r\nnot been on view since the times of Tycho and Kepler. Before daylight\r\non the morning of February 22, 1901, the Rev. Doctor Anderson, of\r\nEdinburgh, an amateur astronomer, who had also been the first to see\r\nthe new star in Auriga, beheld a strange object in the constellation\r\nPerseus not far from the celebrated variable star Algol. He recognized\r\nits character at once, and immediately telegraphed the news, which\r\nawoke the startled attention of astronomers all over the world. When\r\nfirst seen the new star was no brighter than Algol (less than the\r\nsecond magnitude), but within twenty-four hours it was ablaze,\r\noutshining even the brilliant Capella, and far surpassing the first\r\nmagnitude. At the spot in the sky where it appeared nothing whatever\r\nwas visible on the night before its coming. This is known with\r\ncertainty because a photograph had been made of that very region on\r\nFebruary 21, and this photograph showed everything down to the twelfth\r\nmagnitude, but not a trace of the stranger which burst into view\r\nbetween the 21st and the 22nd like the explosion of a rocket.\r\n\r\nUpon one who knew the stars the apparition of this intruder in a\r\nwell-known constellation had the effect of a sudden invasion. The new\r\nstar was not far west of the zenith in the early evening, and in that\r\nposition showed to the best advantage. To see Capella, the hitherto\r\nunchallenged ruler of that quarter of the sky, abased by comparison\r\nwith this stranger of alien aspect, for there was always an unfamiliar\r\nlook about the “nova,” was decidedly disconcerting. It seemed to\r\nportend the beginning of a revolution in the heavens. One could\r\nunderstand what the effect of such an apparition must have been in the\r\nsuperstitious times of Tycho. The star of Tycho had burst forth on the\r\nnorthern border of the Milky Way; this one was on its southern border,\r\nsome forty-five degrees farther east.\r\n\r\nAstronomers were well-prepared this time for the scientific study of\r\nthe new star, both astronomical photography and spectroscopy having\r\nbeen perfected, and the results of their investigations were calculated\r\nto increase the wonder with which the phenomenon was regarded. The star\r\nremained at its brightest only a few days; then, like a veritable\r\nconflagration, it began to languish; and, like the reflection of a\r\ndying fire, as it sank it began to glow with the red color of embers.\r\nBut its changes were spasmodic; once about every three days it flared\r\nup only to die away again. During these fluctuations its light varied\r\nalternately in the ratio of one to six. Finally it took a permanent\r\ndownward course, and after a few months the naked eye could no longer\r\nperceive it; but it remained visible with telescopes, gradually fading\r\nuntil it had sunk to the ninth magnitude. Then another astonishing\r\nchange happened: in August photographs taken at the Yerkes Observatory\r\nand at Heidelberg showed that the “nova” was _surrounded by a spiral\r\nnebula!_ The nebula had not been there before, and no one could doubt\r\nthat it represented a phase of the same catastrophe that had produced\r\nthe outburst of the new star. At one time the star seemed virtually to\r\nhave disappeared, as if all its substance had been expanded into the\r\nnebulous cloud, but always there remained a stellar nucleus about which\r\nthe misty spiral spread wider and ever wider, like a wave expanding\r\naround a center of disturbance. The nebula too showed a variability of\r\nbrightness, and four condensations which formed in it seemed to have a\r\nmotion of revolution about the star. As time went on the nebula\r\ncontinued to expand at a rate which was computed to be not less than\r\ntwenty thousand miles per second! And now the star itself, showing\r\nindications of having turned into a nebula, behaved in a most erratic\r\nmanner, giving rise to the suspicion that it was about to burst out\r\nagain. But this did not occur, and at length it sunk into a state of\r\nlethargy from which it has to the present time not recovered. But the\r\nnebulous spiral has disappeared, and the entire phenomena as it now\r\n(1909) exists consists of a faint nebulous star of less than the ninth\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful transformations just described had been forecast in\r\nadvance of the discovery of the nebulous spiral encircling the star by\r\nthe spectroscopic study of the latter. At first there was no suggestion\r\nof a nebular constitution, but within a month or two characteristic\r\nnebular lines began to appear, and in less than six months the whole\r\nspectrum had been transformed to the nebular type. In the mean time the\r\nshifting of the spectral lines indicated a complication of rapid\r\nmotions in several directions simultaneously. These motions were\r\nestimated to amount to from one hundred to five hundred miles per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe human mind is so constituted that it feels forced to seek an\r\nexplanation of so marvelous a phenomenon as this, even in the absence\r\nof the data needed for a sound conclusion. The most natural hypothesis,\r\nperhaps, is that of a collision. Such a catastrophe could certainly\r\nhappen. It has been shown, for instance, that in infinity of time the\r\nearth is sure to be hit by a comet; in the same way it may be asserted\r\nthat, if no time limit is fixed, the sun is certain to run against some\r\nobstacle in space, either another star, or a dense meteor swarm, or one\r\nof the dark bodies which there is every reason to believe abound around\r\nus. The consequences of such a collision are easy to foretell, provided\r\nthat we know the masses and the velocities of the colliding bodies. In\r\na preceding chapter we have discussed the motions of the sun and stars,\r\nand have seen that they are so swift that an encounter between any two\r\nof them could not but be disastrous. But this is not all; for as soon\r\nas two stars approached within a few million miles their speed would be\r\nenormously increased by their reciprocal attractions and, if their\r\nmotion was directed radially with respect to their centers, they would\r\ncome together with a crash that would reduce them both to nebulous\r\nclouds. It is true that the chances of such a “head-on” collision are\r\nrelatively very small; two stars approaching each other would most\r\nprobably fall into closed orbits around their common center of gravity.\r\nIf there were a collision it would most likely be a grazing one instead\r\nof a direct front-to-front encounter. But even a close approach,\r\nwithout any actual collision, would probably prove disastrous, owing to\r\nthe tidal influence of each of the bodies on the other. Suns, in\r\nconsequence of their enormous masses and dimensions and the\r\npeculiarities of their constitution, are exceedingly dangerous to one\r\nanother at close quarters. Propinquity awakes in them a mutually\r\ndestructive tendency. Consisting of matter in the gaseous, or perhaps,\r\nin some cases, liquid, state, their tidal pull upon each other if\r\nbrought close together might burst them asunder, and the photospheric\r\nenvelope being destroyed the internal incandescent mass would gush out,\r\nbringing fiery death to any planets that were revolving near. Without\r\nregard to the resulting disturbance of the earth’s orbit, the close\r\napproach of a great star to the sun would be in the highest degree\r\nperilous to us. But this is a danger which may properly be regarded as\r\nindefinitely remote, since, at our present location in space, we are\r\ncertainly far from every star except the sun, and we may feel confident\r\nthat no great invisible body is near, for if there were one we should\r\nbe aware of its presence from the effects of its attraction. As to dark\r\nnebulæ which may possibly lie in the track that the solar system is\r\npursuing at the rate of 375,000,000 miles per year, that is another\r\nquestion—and they, too, could be dangerous!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nova Persei, with its nebular rings]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis brings us directly back to “Nova Persei,” for among the many\r\nsuggestions offered to explain its outburst, as well as those of other\r\ntemporary stars, one of the most fruitful is that of a collision\r\nbetween a star and a vast invisible nebula. Professor Seeliger, of\r\nMunich, first proposed this theory, but it afterward underwent some\r\nmodifications from others. Stated in a general form, the idea is that a\r\nhuge dark body, perhaps an extinguished sun, encountered in its\r\nprogress through space a widespread flock of small meteors forming a\r\ndark nebula. As it plunged into the swarm the friction of the\r\ninnumerable collisions with the meteors heated its surface to\r\nincandescence, and being of vast size it then became visible to us as a\r\nnew star. Meanwhile the motion of the body through the nebula, and its\r\nrotation upon itself, set up a gyration in the blazing atmosphere\r\nformed around it by the vaporized meteors; and as this atmosphere\r\nspread wider, under the laws of gyratory motion a rotation in the\r\nopposite direction began in the inflamed meteoric cloud outside the\r\ncentral part of the vortex. Thus the spectral lines were caused to show\r\nmotion in opposite directions, a part of the incandescent mass\r\napproaching the earth simultaneously with the retreat of another part.\r\nSo the curious spectroscopic observations before mentioned were\r\nexplained. This theory might also account for the appearance of the\r\nnebulous spiral first seen some six months after the original outburst.\r\nThe sequent changes in the spectrum of the “nova” are accounted for by\r\nthis theory on the assumption, reasonable enough in itself, that at\r\nfirst the invading body would be enveloped in a vaporized atmosphere of\r\nrelatively slight depth, producing by its absorption the fine dark\r\nlines first observed; but that as time went on and the incessant\r\ncollisions continued, the blazing atmosphere would become very deep and\r\nextensive, whereupon the appearance of the spectral lines would change,\r\nand bright lines due to the light of the incandescent meteors\r\nsurrounding the nucleus at a great distance would take the place of the\r\noriginal dark ones. The vortex of meteors once formed would protect the\r\nflying body within from further immediate collisions, the latter now\r\noccurring mainly among the meteors themselves, and then the central\r\nblaze would die down, and the original splendor of the phenomenon would\r\nfade.\r\n\r\nBut the theories about Nova Persei have been almost as numerous as the\r\nastronomers who have speculated about it. One of the most startling of\r\nthem assumed that the outburst was caused by the running amuck of a\r\ndark star which had encountered another star surrounded with planets,\r\nthe renewed outbreaks of light after the principal one had faded being\r\ndue to the successive running down of the unfortunate planets! Yet\r\nanother hypothesis is based on what we have already said of the tidal\r\ninfluence that two close approaching suns would have upon each other.\r\nSupposing two such bodies which had become encrusted, but remained\r\nincandescent and fluid within, to approach within almost striking\r\ndistance; they would whirl each other about their common center of\r\ngravity, and at the same time their shells would burst under the tidal\r\nstrain, and their glowing nuclei being disclosed would produce a great\r\noutburst of light. Applying this theory to a “nova,” like that of 1866\r\nin the “Northern Crown,” which had been visible as a small star before\r\nthe outbreak, and which afterward resumed its former aspect, we should\r\nhave to assume that a yet shining sun had been approached by a dark\r\nbody whose attraction temporarily burst open its photosphere. It might\r\nbe supposed that in this case the dark body was too far advanced in\r\ncooling to suffer the same fate from the tidal pull of its victim. But\r\na close approach of that kind would be expected to result in the\r\nformation of a binary system, with orbits of great eccentricity,\r\nperhaps, and after the lapse of a certain time the outburst should be\r\nrenewed by another approximation of the two bodies. A temporary star of\r\nthat kind would rather be ranked as a variable.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated French astronomer, Janssen, had a different theory of\r\nNova Persei, and of temporary stars in general. According to his idea,\r\nsuch phenomena might be the result of chemical changes taking place in\r\na sun without interference by, or collision with, another body. Janssen\r\nwas engaged for many years in trying to discover evidence of the\r\nexistence of oxygen in the sun, and he constructed his observatory on\r\nthe summit of Mount Blanc specially to pursue that research. He\r\nbelieved that oxygen must surely exist in the sun since we find so many\r\nother familiar elements included in the constitution of the solar\r\nglobe, and as he was unable to discover satisfactory evidence of its\r\npresence he assumed that it existed in a form unknown on the earth. If\r\nit were normally in the sun’s chromosphere, or coronal atmosphere, he\r\nsaid, it would combine with the hydrogen which we know is there and\r\nform an obscuring envelope of water vapor. It exists, then, in a\r\nspecial state, uncombined with hydrogen; but let the temperature of the\r\nsun sink to a critical point and the oxygen will assume its normal\r\nproperties and combine with the hydrogen, producing a mighty outburst\r\nof light and heat. This, Janssen thought, might explain the phenomena\r\nof the temporary stars. It would also, he suggested, account for their\r\nbrief career, because the combination of the elements would be quickly\r\naccomplished, and then the resulting water vapor would form an\r\natmosphere cutting off the radiation from the star within.\r\n\r\nThis theory may be said to have a livelier human interest than some of\r\nthe others, since, according to it, the sun may carry in its very\r\nconstitution a menace to mankind; one does not like to think of it\r\nbeing suddenly transformed into a gigantic laboratory for the explosive\r\ncombination of oxygen and hydrogen! But while Janssen’s theory might do\r\nfor some temporary stars, it is inadequate to explain all the phenomena\r\nof Nova Persei, and particularly the appearance of the great spiral\r\nnebula that seemed to exhale from the heart of the star. Upon the\r\nwhole, the theory of an encounter between a star and a dark nebula\r\nseems best to fit the observations. By that hypothesis the expanding\r\nbillow of light surrounding the core of the conflagration is very well\r\naccounted for, and the spectroscopic peculiarities are also explained.\r\n\r\nDr Gustov Le Bon offers a yet more alarming theory, suggesting that\r\ntemporary stars are the result of _atomic explosion;_ but we shall\r\ntouch upon this more fully in Chapter 14.\r\n\r\nTwice in the course of this discussion we have called attention to the\r\nchange of color invariably undergone by temporary stars in the later\r\nstages of their career. This was conspicuous with Nova Persei which\r\nglowed more and more redly as it faded, until the nebulous light began\r\nto overpower that of the stellar nucleus. Nothing could be more\r\nsuggestive of the dying out of a great fire. Moreover, change of color\r\nfrom white to red is characteristic of all variable stars of long\r\nperiod, such as “Mira” in Cetus. It is also characteristic of stars\r\nbelieved to be in the later stages of evolution, and consequently\r\napproaching extinction, like Antares and Betelgeuse, and still more\r\nnotably certain small stars which “gleam like rubies in the field of\r\nthe telescope.” These last appear to be suns in the closing period of\r\nexistence as self-luminous bodies. Between the white stars, such as\r\nSirius and Rigel, and the red stars, such as Aldebaran and Alpha\r\nHerculis, there is a progressive series of colors from golden yellow\r\nthrough orange to deep red. The change is believed to be due to the\r\nincrease of absorbing vapors in the stellar atmosphere as the body\r\ncools down. In the case of ordinary stars these changes no doubt occupy\r\nmany millions of years, which represent the average duration of solar\r\nlife; but the temporary stars run through similar changes in a few\r\nmonths: they resemble ephemeral insects—born in the morning and doomed\r\nto perish with the going down of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nExplosive and Whirling Nebulæ\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising triumphs of celestial photography was\r\nProfessor Keeler’s discovery, in 1899, that the great majority of the\r\nnebulæ have a distinctly spiral form. This form, previously known in\r\nLord Rosse’s great “Whirlpool Nebula,” had been supposed to be\r\nexceptional; now the photographs, far excelling telescopic views in the\r\nrevelation of nebular forms, showed the spiral to be the typical shape.\r\nIndeed, it is a question whether all nebulæ are not to some extent\r\nspiral. The extreme importance of this discovery is shown in the effect\r\nthat it has had upon hitherto prevailing views of solar and planetary\r\nevolution. For more than three-quarters of a century Laplace’s\r\ncelebrated hypothesis of the manner of origin of the solar system from\r\na rotating and contracting nebula surrounding the sun had guided\r\nspeculation on that subject, and had been tentatively extended to cover\r\nthe evolution of systems in general. The apparent forms of some of the\r\nnebulæ which the telescope had revealed were regarded, and by some are\r\nstill regarded, as giving visual evidence in favor of this theory.\r\nThere is a “ring nebula” in Lyra with a central star, and a “planetary\r\nnebula” in Gemini bearing no little resemblance to the planet Saturn\r\nwith its rings, both of which appear to be practical realizations of\r\nLaplace’s idea, and the elliptical rings surrounding the central\r\ncondensation of the Andromeda Nebula may be cited for the same kind of\r\nproof.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Rosse’s nebula]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut since Keeler’s discovery there has been a decided turning away of\r\nspeculation another way. The form of the spiral nebulæ seems to be\r\nentirely inconsistent with the theory of an originally globular or\r\ndisk-shaped nebula condensing around a sun and throwing or leaving off\r\nrings, to be subsequently shaped into planets. Some astronomers,\r\nindeed, now reject Laplace’s hypothesis _in toto,_ preferring to think\r\nthat even our solar system originated from a spiral nebula. Since the\r\nspiral type prevails among the existing nebulæ, we must make any\r\nmechanical theory of the development of stars and planetary systems\r\nfrom them accord with the requirements which that form imposes. A\r\nglance at the extraordinary variations upon the spiral which Professor\r\nKeeler’s photographs reveal is sufficient to convince one of the\r\ndifficulty of the task of basing a general theory upon them. In truth,\r\nit is much easier to criticize Laplace’s hypothesis than to invent a\r\nsatisfactory substitute for it. If the spiral nebulæ seem to oppose it\r\nthere are other nebulæ which appear to support it, and it may be that\r\nno one fixed theory can account for all the forms of stellar evolution\r\nin the universe. Our particular planetary system may have originated\r\nvery much as the great French mathematician supposed, while others have\r\nundergone, or are now undergoing, a different process of development.\r\nThere is always a too strong tendency to regard an important new\r\ndiscovery and the theories and speculations based upon it as\r\nrevolutionizing knowledge, and displacing or overthrowing everything\r\nthat went before. Upon the plea that “Laplace only made a guess” more\r\nrecent guesses have been driven to extremes and treated by injudicious\r\nexponents as “the solid facts at last.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wonderful spiral in triangulum]\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore considering more recent theories than Laplace’s, let us see what\r\nthe nature of the photographic revelations is. The vast celestial\r\nmaelstrom discovered by Lord Rosse in the “Hunting Dogs” may be taken\r\nas the leading type of the spiral nebulæ, although there are less\r\nconspicuous objects of the kind which, perhaps, better illustrate some\r\nof their peculiarities. Lord Rosse’s nebula appears far more wonderful\r\nin the photographs than in his drawings made with the aid of his giant\r\nreflecting telescope at Parsonstown, for the photographic plate records\r\ndetails that no telescope is capable of showing. Suppose we look at the\r\nphotograph of this object as any person of common sense would look at\r\nany great and strange natural phenomenon. What is the first thing that\r\nstrikes the mind? It is certainly the appearance of violent whirling\r\nmotion. One would say that the whole glowing mass had been spun about\r\nwith tremendous velocity, or that it had been set rotating so rapidly\r\nthat it had become the victim of “centrifugal force,” one huge fragment\r\nhaving broken loose and started to gyrate off into space. Closer\r\ninspection shows that in addition to the principal focus there are\r\nvarious smaller condensations scattered through the mass. These are\r\nconspicuous in the spirals. Some of them are stellar points, and but\r\nfor the significance of their location we might suppose them to be\r\nstars which happen to lie in a line between us and the nebula. But when\r\nwe observe how many of them follow most faithfully the curves of the\r\nspirals we cannot but conclude that they form an essential part of the\r\nphenomenon; it is not possible to believe that their presence in such\r\nsituations is merely fortuitous. One of the outer spirals has at least\r\na dozen of these star-like points strung upon it; some of them sharp,\r\nsmall, and distinct, others more blurred and nebulous, suggesting\r\ndifferent stages of condensation. Even the part which seems to have\r\nbeen flung loose from the main mass has, in addition to its central\r\ncondensation, at least one stellar point gleaming in the half-vanished\r\nspire attached to it. Some of the more distant stars scattered around\r\nthe “whirlpool” look as if they too had been shot out of the mighty\r\nvortex, afterward condensing into unmistakable solar bodies. There are\r\nat least two curved rows of minute stars a little beyond the periphery\r\nof the luminous whirl which clearly follow lines concentric with those\r\nof the nebulous spirals. Such facts are simply dumbfounding for anyone\r\nwho will bestow sufficient thought upon them, for these are _suns,_\r\nthough they may be small ones; and what a birth is that for a sun!\r\n\r\nLook now again at the glowing spirals. We observe that hardly have they\r\nleft the central mass before they begin to coagulate. In some places\r\nthey have a “ropy” aspect; or they are like peascods filled with\r\ngrowing seeds, which eventually will become stars. The great focus\r\nitself shows a similar tendency, especially around its circumference.\r\nThe sense that it imparts of a tremendous shattering force at work is\r\noverwhelming. There is probably more matter in that whirling and\r\nbursting nebula than would suffice to make a hundred solar systems! It\r\nmust be confessed at once that there is no confirmation of the\r\nLaplacean hypothesis here; but what hypothesis will fit the facts?\r\nThere is one which it has been claimed does so, but we shall come to\r\nthat later. In the meanwhile, as a preparation, fix in the memory the\r\nappearance of that second spiral mass spinning beside its master which\r\nseems to have spurned it away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spiral in Ursa Major]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a second example of the spiral nebulæ look at the one in the\r\nconstellation Triangulum. _God, how hath the imagination of puny man\r\nfailed to comprehend Thee!_ Here is creation through destruction with a\r\nvengeance! The spiral form of the nebula is unmistakable, but it is\r\nhalf obliterated amid the turmoil of flying masses hurled away on all\r\nsides with tornadic fury. The focus itself is splitting asunder under\r\nthe intolerable strain, and in a little while, as time is reckoned in\r\nthe Cosmos, it will be gyrating into stars. And then look at the\r\ncyclonic rain of already finished stars whirling round the outskirts of\r\nthe storm. Observe how scores of them are yet involved in the fading\r\nstreams of the nebulous spirals; see how they have been thrown into\r\nvast loops and curves, of a beauty that half redeems the terror of the\r\nspectacle enclosed within their lines—like iridescent cirri hovering\r\nabout the edges of a hurricane. And so again are suns born!\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the exquisite spiral in Ursa Major; how different its\r\naspect from that of the other! One would say that if the terrific coil\r\nin Triangulum has all but destroyed itself in its fury, this one on the\r\ncontrary has just begun its self-demolition. As one gazes one seems to\r\nsee in it the smooth, swift, accelerating motion that precedes\r\ncatastrophe. The central part is still intact, dense, and uniform in\r\ntexture. How graceful are the spirals that smoothly rise from its oval\r\nrim and, gemmed with little stars, wind off into the darkness until\r\nthey have become as delicate as threads of gossamer! But at bottom the\r\nstory told here is the same—creation by gyration!\r\n\r\nCompare with the above the curious mass in Cetus. Here the plane of the\r\nwhirling nebula nearly coincides with our line of sight and we see the\r\nobject at a low angle. It is far advanced and torn to shreds, and if we\r\ncould look at it perpendicularly to its plane it is evident that it\r\nwould closely resemble the spectacle in Triangulum.\r\n\r\nThen take the famous Andromeda Nebula (see Frontispiece), which is so\r\nvast that notwithstanding its immense distance even the naked eye\r\nperceives it as an enigmatical wisp in the sky. Its image on the\r\nsensitive plate is the masterpiece of astronomical photography; for\r\nwild, incomprehensible beauty there is nothing that can be compared\r\nwith it. Here, if anywhere, we look upon the spectacle of creation in\r\none of its earliest stages. The Andromeda Nebula is apparently less\r\nadvanced toward transformation into stellar bodies than is that in\r\nTriangulum. The immense crowd of stars sprinkled over it and its\r\nneighborhood seem in the main to lie this side of the nebula, and\r\nconsequently to have no connection with it. But incipient stars (in\r\nsome places clusters of them) are seen in the nebulous rings, while one\r\nor two huge masses seem to give promise of transformation into stellar\r\nbodies of unusual magnitude. I say “rings” because although the loops\r\nencompassing the Andromeda Nebula have been called spirals by those who\r\nwish utterly to demolish Laplace’s hypothesis, yet they are not\r\nmanifestly such, as can be seen on comparing them with the undoubted\r\nspirals of the Lord Rosse Nebula. They look quite as much like circles\r\nor ellipses seen at an angle of, say, fifteen or twenty degrees to\r\ntheir plane. If they are truly elliptical they accord fairly well with\r\nLaplace’s idea, except that the scale of magnitude is stupendous, and\r\nif the Andromeda Nebula is to become a solar system it will surpass\r\nours in grandeur beyond all possibility of comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nebula in Cetus]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one circumstance connected with the spiral nebulæ, and\r\nconspicuous in the Andromeda Nebula on account of its brightness, which\r\nmakes the question of their origin still more puzzling; they all show\r\ncontinuous spectra, which, as we have before remarked, indicate that\r\nthe mass from which the light comes is either solid or liquid, or a gas\r\nunder heavy pressure. Thus nebulæ fall into two classes: the “white”\r\nnebulæ, giving a continuous spectrum; and the “green” nebulæ whose\r\nspectra are distinctly gaseous. The Andromeda Nebula is the great\r\nrepresentative of the former class and the Orion Nebula of the latter.\r\nThe spectrum of the Andromeda Nebula has been interpreted to mean that\r\nit consists not of luminous gas, but of a flock of stars so distant\r\nthat they are separately indistinguishable even with powerful\r\ntelescopes, just as the component stars of the Milky Way are\r\nindistinguishable with the naked eye; and upon this has been based the\r\nsuggestion that what we see in Andromeda is an outer universe whose\r\nstars form a series of elliptical garlands surrounding a central mass\r\nof amazing richness. But this idea is unacceptable if for no other\r\nreason than that, as just said, all the spiral nebulæ possess the same\r\nkind of spectrum, and probably no one would be disposed to regard them\r\nall as outer universes. As we shall see later, the peculiarity of the\r\nspectra of the spiral nebulæ is appealed to in support of a modern\r\nsubstitute for Laplace’s hypothesis.\r\n\r\nFinally, without having by any means exhausted the variety exhibited by\r\nthe spiral nebulæ, let us turn to the great representative of the other\r\nspecies, the Orion Nebula. In some ways this is even more marvelous\r\nthan the others. The early drawings with the telescope failed to convey\r\nan adequate conception either of its sublimity or of its complication\r\nof structure. It exists in a nebulous region of space, since\r\nphotographs show that nearly the whole constellation is interwoven with\r\nfaintly luminous coils. To behold the entry of the great nebula into\r\nthe field even of a small telescope is a startling experience which\r\nnever loses its novelty. As shown by the photographs, it is an\r\ninscrutable chaos of perfectly amazing extent, where spiral bands,\r\nradiating streaks, dense masses, and dark yawning gaps are strangely\r\nintermingled without apparent order. In one place four conspicuous\r\nlittle stars, better seen in a telescope than in the photograph on\r\naccount of the blurring produced by over-exposure, are suggestively\r\nsituated in the midst of a dark opening, and no observer has ever felt\r\nany doubt that these stars have been formed from the substance of the\r\nsurrounding nebula. There are many other stars scattered over its\r\nexpanse which manifestly owe their origin to the same source. But\r\ncompare the general appearance of this nebula with the others that we\r\nhave studied, and remark the difference. If the unmistakably spiral\r\nnebulæ resemble bursting fly-wheels or grindstones from whose\r\nperimeters torrents of sparks are flying, the Orion Nebula rather\r\nrecalls the aspect of a cloud of smoke and fragments produced by the\r\nexplosion of a shell. This idea is enforced by the look of the outer\r\nportion farthest from the bright half of the nebula, where sharply\r\nedged clouds with dark spaces behind seem to be billowing away as if\r\ndriven by a wind blowing from the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Orion nebula]\r\n\r\n\r\nNext let us consider what scientific speculation has done in the effort\r\nto explain these mysteries. Laplace’s hypothesis can certainly find no\r\nstanding ground either in the Orion Nebula or in those of a spiral\r\nconfiguration, whatever may be its situation with respect to the grand\r\nNebula of Andromeda, or the “ring” and “planetary” nebulæ. Some other\r\nhypothesis more consonant with the appearances must be found. Among the\r\nmany that have been proposed the most elaborate is the “Planetesimal\r\nHypothesis” of Professors Chamberlin and Moulton. It is to be remarked\r\nthat it applies to the spiral nebulæ distinctively, and not to an\r\napparently chaotic mass of gas like the vast luminous cloud in Orion.\r\nThe gist of the theory is that these curious objects are probably the\r\nresult of close approaches to each other of two independent suns,\r\nreminding us of what was said on this subject when we were dealing with\r\ntemporary stars. Of the previous history of these appulsing suns the\r\ntheory gives us no account; they are simply supposed to arrive within\r\nwhat may be called an effective tide-producing distance, and then the\r\ndrama begins. Some of the probable consequences of such an approach\r\nhave been noticed in Chapter 5; let us now consider them a little more\r\nin detail.\r\n\r\nTides always go in couples; if there is a tide on one side of a globe\r\nthere will be a corresponding tide on the other side. The cause is to\r\nbe found in the law that the force of gravitation varies inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance; the attraction on the nearest surface of\r\nthe body exercised by another body is greater than on its center, and\r\ngreater yet than on its opposite surface. If two great globes attract\r\neach other, each tends to draw the other out into an ellipsoidal\r\nfigure; they must be more rigid than steel to resist this—and even then\r\nthey cannot altogether resist. If they are liquid or gaseous they will\r\nyield readily to the force of distortion, the amount of which will\r\ndepend upon their distance apart, for the nearer they are the greater\r\nbecomes the tidal strain. If they are encrusted without and liquid or\r\ngaseous in the interior, the internal mass will strive to assume the\r\nfigure demanded by the tidal force, and will, if it can, burst the\r\nrestraining envelope. Now this is virtually the predicament of the body\r\nwe call a sun when in the immediate presence of another body of\r\nsimilarly great mass. Such a body is presumably gaseous throughout, the\r\ncomponent gases being held in a state of rigidity by the compression\r\nproduced by the tremendous gravitational force of their own aggregate\r\nmass. At the surface such a body is enveloped in a shell of relatively\r\ncool matter. Now suppose a great attracting body, such as another sun,\r\nto approach near enough for the difference in its attraction on the two\r\nopposite sides of the body and on its center to become very great; the\r\nconsequence will be a tidal deformation of the whole body, and it will\r\nlengthen out along the line of the gravitational pull and draw in at\r\nthe sides, and if its shell offers considerable resistance, but not\r\nenough to exercise a complete restraint, it will be violently burst\r\napart, or blown to atoms, and the internal mass will leap out on the\r\ntwo opposite sides in great fiery spouts. In the case of a sun further\r\nadvanced in cooling than ours the interior might be composed of molten\r\nmatter while the exterior crust had become rigid like the shell of an\r\negg; then the force of the “tidal explosion” produced by the appulse of\r\nanother sun would be more violent in consequence of the greater\r\nresistance overcome. Such, then, is the mechanism of the first phase in\r\nthe history of a spiral nebula according to the Planetesimal\r\nHypothesis. Two suns, perhaps extinguished ones, have drawn near\r\ntogether, and an explosive outburst has occured in one or both. The\r\nsecond phase calls for a more agile exercise of the imagination.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the case, let us suppose that only one of the tugging suns\r\nis seriously affected by the strain. Its vast wings produced by the\r\noutburst are twisted into spirals by their rotation and the contending\r\nattractions exercised upon them, as the two suns, like battleships in\r\ndesperate conflict, curve round each other, concentrating their\r\ndestructive energies. Then immense quantities of débris are scattered\r\nabout in which eddies are created, and finally, as the sun that caused\r\nthe damage goes on its way, leaving its victim to repair its injuries\r\nas it may, the dispersed matter cools, condenses, and turns into\r\nstreams of solid particles circling in elliptical paths about their\r\nparent sun. These particles, or fragments, are the “planetesimals” of\r\nthe theory. In consequence of the inevitable intersection of the orbits\r\nof the planetesimals, nodes are formed where the flying particles meet,\r\nand at these nodes large masses are gradually accumulated. The larger\r\nthe mass the greater its attraction, and at last the nodal points\r\nbecome the nuclei of great aggregations from which planets are shaped.\r\n\r\nThis, in very brief form, is the Planetesimal Hypothesis which we are\r\nasked to substitute for that based on Laplace’s suggestion as an\r\nexplanation of the mode of origin of the solar system; and the\r\nphenomena of the spiral nebulæ are appealed to as offering evident\r\nsupport to the new hypothesis. We are reminded that they are elliptical\r\nin outline, which accords with the hypothesis; that their spectra are\r\nnot gaseous, which shows that they may be composed of solid particles\r\nlike the planetesimals; and that their central masses present an oval\r\nform, which is what would result from the tidal effects, as just\r\ndescribed. We also remember that some of them, like the Lord Rosse and\r\nthe Andromeda nebulæ, are visually double, and in these cases we might\r\nsuppose that the two masses represent the tide-burst suns that ventured\r\ninto too close proximity. It may be added that the authors of the\r\ntheory do not insist upon the appulse of two suns as the _only_ way in\r\nwhich the planetesimals may have originated, but it is the only\r\nsupposition that has been worked out.\r\n\r\nBut serious questions remain. It needs, for instance, but a glance at\r\nthe Triangulum monster to convince the observer that it cannot be a\r\nsolar system which is being evolved there, but rather a swarm of stars.\r\nMany of the detached masses are too vast to admit of the supposition\r\nthat they are to be transformed into planets, in our sense of planets,\r\nand the distances of the stars which appear to have been originally\r\nejected from the focal masses are too great to allow us to liken the\r\nassemblage that they form to a solar system. Then, too, no nodes such\r\nas the hypothesis calls for are visible. Moreover, in most of the\r\nspiral nebulæ the appearances favor the view that the supposititious\r\nencountering suns have not separated and gone each rejoicing on its\r\nway, after having inflicted the maximum possible damage on its\r\nopponent, but that, on the contrary, they remain in close association\r\nlike two wrestlers who cannot escape from each other’s grasp. And this\r\nis exactly what the law of gravitation demands; stars cannot approach\r\none another with impunity, with regard either to their physical make-up\r\nor their future independence of movement. The theory undertakes to\r\navoid this difficulty by assuming that in the case of our system the\r\napproach of the foreign body to the sun was not a close one—just close\r\nenough to produce the tidal extrusion of the relatively insignificant\r\nquantity of matter needed to form the planets. But even then the effect\r\nof the appulse would be to change the direction of flight, both of the\r\nsun and of its visitor, and there is no known star in the sky which can\r\nbe selected as the sun’s probable partner in their ancient _pas deux._\r\nThat there are unconquered difficulties in Laplace’s hypothesis no one\r\nwould deny, but in simplicity of conception it is incomparably more\r\nsatisfactory, and with proper modifications could probably be made more\r\nconsonant with existing facts in our solar system than that which is\r\noffered to replace it. Even as an explanation of the spiral nebulæ, not\r\nas solar systems in process of formation, but as the birthplaces of\r\nstellar clusters, the Planetesimal Hypothesis would be open to many\r\nobjections. Granting its assumptions, it has undoubtedly a strong\r\nmathematical framework, but the trouble is not with the mathematics but\r\nwith the assumptions. Laplace was one of the ablest mathematicians that\r\never lived, but he had never seen a spiral nebula; if he had, he might\r\nhave invented a hypothesis to suit its phenomena. His actual hypothesis\r\nwas intended only for our solar system, and he left it in the form of a\r\n“note” for the consideration of his successors, with the hope that they\r\nmight be able to discover the full truth, which he confessed was hidden\r\nfrom him. It cannot be said that that truth has yet been found, and\r\nwhen it is found the chances are that intuition and not logic will have\r\nled to it.\r\n\r\nThe spiral nebulæ, then, remain among the greatest riddles of the\r\nuniverse, while the gaseous nebulæ, like that of Orion, are no less\r\nmysterious, although it seems impossible to doubt that both forms give\r\nbirth to stars. It is but natural to look to them for light on the\r\nquestion of the origin of our planetary system; but we should not\r\nforget that the scale of the phenomena in the two cases is vastly\r\ndifferent, and the forces in operation may be equally different. A hill\r\nmay have been built up by a glacier, while a mountain may be the\r\nproduct of volcanic forces or of the upheaval of the strata of the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nThe Banners of the Sun\r\n\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows, the sun, a blinding globe pouring forth an\r\ninconceivable quantity of light and heat, whose daily passage through\r\nthe sky is caused by the earth’s rotation on its axis, constitutes the\r\nmost important phenomenon of terrestial existence. Viewed with a dark\r\nglass to take off the glare, or with a telescope, its rim is seen to be\r\na sharp and smooth circle, and nothing but dark sky is visible around\r\nit. Except for the interference of the moon, we should probably never\r\nhave known that there is any more of the sun than our eyes ordinarily\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nBut when an eclipse of the sun occurs, caused by the interposition of\r\nthe opaque globe of the moon, we see its immediate surroundings, which\r\nin some respects are more wonderful than the glowing central orb. These\r\nsurroundings, although not in the sense in which we apply the term to\r\nthe gaseous envelope of the earth, may be called the sun’s atmosphere.\r\nThey consist of two very different parts—first, the red “prominences,”\r\nwhich resemble tongues of flame ascending thousands of miles above the\r\nsun’s surface; and, second, the “corona,” which extends to distances of\r\nmillions of miles from the sun, and shines with a soft, glowing light.\r\nThe two combined, when well seen, make a spectacle without parallel\r\namong the marvels of the sky. Although many attempts have been made to\r\nrender the corona visible when there is no eclipse, all have failed,\r\nand it is to the moon alone that we owe its revelation. To cover the\r\nsun’s disk with a circular screen will not answer the purpose because\r\nof the illumination of the air all about the observer. When the moon\r\nhides the sun, on the other hand, the sunlight is withdrawn from a\r\ngreat cylinder of air extending to the top of the atmosphere and\r\nspreading many miles around the observer. There is then no glare to\r\ninterfere with the spectacle, and the corona appears in all its\r\nsurprising beauty. The prominences, however, although they were\r\ndiscovered during an eclipse, can now, with the aid of the\r\nspectroscope, be seen at any time. But the prominences are rarely large\r\nenough to be noticed by the naked eye, while the streamers of the\r\ncorona, stretching far away in space, like ghostly banners blown out\r\nfrom the black circle of the obscuring moon, attract every eye, and to\r\nthis weird apparition much of the fear inspired by eclipses has been\r\ndue. But if the corona has been a cause of terror in the past it has\r\nbecome a source of growing knowledge in our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Corona]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the first scientific observation of the corona and the\r\nprominences is thrillingly interesting, and in fact dramatic. The\r\nobservation was made during the eclipse of 1842, which fortunately was\r\nvisible all over Central and Southern Europe so that scores of\r\nastronomers saw it. The interest centers in what happened at Pavia in\r\nNorthern Italy, where the English astronomer Francis Baily had set up\r\nhis telescope. The eclipse had begun and Bailey was busy at his\r\ntelescope when, to quote his own words in the account which he wrote\r\nfor the _Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society:_\r\n\r\n\r\nI was astounded by a tremendous burst of applause from the streets\r\nbelow, and at the same moment was electrified by the sight of one of\r\nthe most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be imagined;\r\nfor at that instant the dark body of the moon was suddenly surrounded\r\nwith a corona, or kind of bright glory, similar in shape and magnitude\r\nto that which painters draw round the heads of saints...\r\n\r\nPavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of whom were\r\nat this early hour walking about the streets and squares or looking out\r\nof windows in order to witness this long-talked-of phenomenon; and when\r\nthe total obscuration took place, which was _instantaneous,_ there was\r\na universal shout from every observer which “made the welkin ring,” and\r\nfor the moment withdrew my attention from the object with which I was\r\nimmediately occupied. I had, indeed, expected the appearance of a\r\nluminous circle round the moon during the time of total obscurity; but\r\nI did not expect, from any of the accounts of preceding eclipses that I\r\nhad read, to witness so magnificent an exhibition as that which took\r\nplace...\r\n\r\nSplendid and astonishing, however, as this remarkable phenomenon really\r\nwas, and although it could not fail to call forth the admiration and\r\napplause of every beholder, yet I must confess that there was at the\r\nsame time something in its singular and wonderful appearance that was\r\nappalling...\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was the\r\nappearance of _three large protuberances_ apparently emanating from the\r\ncircumference of the moon, but evidently forming a portion of the\r\ncorona. They had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious elevation;\r\ntheir color was red tinged with lilac or purple; perhaps the color of\r\nthe peach-blossom would more nearly represent it. They somewhat\r\nresembled the tops of the snowy Alpine mountains when colored by the\r\nrising or the setting sun. They resembled the Alpine mountains in\r\nanother respect, inasmuch as their light was perfectly steady, and had\r\nnone of that flickering or sparkling motion so visible in other parts\r\nof the corona...\r\n\r\nThe whole of these protuberances were visible even to the last moment\r\nof total obscuration, and when the first ray of light was admitted from\r\nthe sun they vanished, with the corona, altogether, and daylight was\r\ninstantly restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have quoted nearly all of this remarkable description not alone for\r\nits intrinsic interest, but because it is the best depiction that can\r\nbe found of the general phenomena of a total solar eclipse. Still, not\r\nevery such eclipse offers an equally magnificent spectacle. The\r\neclipses of 1900 and 1905, for instance, which were seen by the writer,\r\nthe first in South Carolina and the second in Spain, fell far short of\r\nthat described by Bailey in splendor and impressiveness. Of course,\r\nsomething must be allowed for the effect of surprise; Bailey had not\r\nexpected to see what was so suddenly disclosed to him. But both in 1900\r\nand 1905 the amount of scattered light in the sky was sufficient in\r\nitself to make the corona appear faint, and there were no very\r\nconspicuous prominences visible. Yet on both occasions there was\r\nmanifest among the spectators that mingling of admiration and awe of\r\nwhich Bailey speaks. The South Carolinians gave a cheer and the ladies\r\nwaved their handkerchiefs when the corona, ineffably delicate of form\r\nand texture, _melted_ into sight and then in two minutes melted away\r\nagain. The Spaniards, crowded on the citadel hill of Burgos, with their\r\nking and his royal retinue in their midst, broke out with a great\r\nclapping of hands as the awaited spectacle unfolded itself in the sky;\r\nand on both occasions, before the applause began, after an awed silence\r\na low murmur ran through the crowds. At Burgos it is said many made the\r\nsign of the cross.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Bailey’s idea that the prominences were a part\r\nof the corona was abandoned, and it was perceived that the two\r\nphenomena were to a great extent independent. At the eclipse of 1868,\r\nwhich the astronomers, aroused by the wonderful scene of 1842, and\r\neager to test the powers of the newly invented spectroscope, flocked to\r\nIndia to witness, Janssen conceived the idea of employing the\r\nspectroscope to render the prominences visible when there was no\r\neclipse. He succeeded the very next day, and these phenomena have been\r\nstudied in that way ever since.\r\n\r\nThere are recognized two kinds of prominences—the “erruptive” and the\r\n“quiescent.” The latter, which are cloud-like in form, may be seen\r\nalmost anywhere along the edge of the sun; but the former, which often\r\nshoot up as if hurled from mighty volcanoes, appear to be associated\r\nwith sun-spots, and appear only above the zones where spots abound.\r\nEither of them, when seen in projection against the brilliant solar\r\ndisk, appears white, not red, as against a background of sky. The\r\nquiescent prominences, whose elevation is often from forty thousand to\r\nsixty thousand miles, consist, as the spectroscope shows, mainly of\r\nhydrogen and helium. The latter, it will be remembered, is an element\r\nwhich was known to be in the sun many years before the discovery that\r\nit also exists in small quantities on the earth. A fact which may have\r\na significance which we cannot at present see is that the emanation\r\nfrom radium gradually and spontaneously changes into helium, an\r\nalchemistical feat of nature that has opened many curious vistas to\r\nspeculative thinkers. The eruptive prominences, which do not spread\r\nhorizontally like the others, but ascend with marvelous velocity to\r\nelevations of half a million miles or more, are apparently composed\r\nlargely of metallic vapors—_i.e._ metals which are usually solid on the\r\nearth, but which at solar temperatures are kept in a volatilized state.\r\nThe velocity of their ascent occasionally amounts to three hundred or\r\nfour hundred miles per second. It is known from mathematical\r\nconsiderations that the gravitation of the sun would not be able to\r\nbring back any body that started from its surface with a velocity\r\nexceeding three hundred and eighty-three miles per second; so it is\r\nevident that some of the matter hurled forth in eruptive prominences\r\nmay escape from solar control and go speeding out into space, cooling\r\nand condensing into solid masses. There seems to be no reason why some\r\nof the projectiles from the sun might not reach the planets. Here,\r\nthen, we have on a relatively small scale, _explosions_ recalling those\r\nwhich it has been imagined may be the originating cause of some of the\r\nsudden phenomena of the stellar heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A solar “prominence.” Photographed May 21, 1907]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the sun-spots it is not our intention here specifically to speak,\r\nbut they evidently have an intimate connection with eruptive\r\nprominences, as well as some relation, not yet fully understood, with\r\nthe corona. Of the real cause of sun-spots we know virtually nothing,\r\nbut recent studies by Professor Hale and others have revealed a strange\r\nstate of things in the clouds of metallic vapors floating above them\r\nand their surroundings. Evidences of a cyclonic tendency have been\r\nfound, and Professor Hale has proved that sun-spots are strong magnetic\r\nfields, and consist of columns of ionized vapors rotating in opposite\r\ndirections in the two hemispheres. A fact which may have the greatest\r\nsignificance is that titanium and vanadium have been found both in\r\nsun-spots and in the remarkable variable Mira Ceti, a star which every\r\neleven months, or thereabout, flames up with great brilliancy and then\r\nsinks back to invisibility with the naked eye. It has been suggested\r\nthat sun-spots are indications of the beginning of a process in the sun\r\nwhich will be intensified until it falls into the state of such a star\r\nas Mira. Stars very far advanced in evolution, without showing\r\nvariability, also exhibit similar spectra; so that there is much reason\r\nfor regarding sunspots as emblems of advancing age.\r\n\r\nThe association of the corona with sun-spots is less evident than that\r\nof the eruptive prominences; still such an association exists, for the\r\nform and extent of the corona vary with the sun-spot period of which we\r\nshall presently speak. The constitution of the corona remains to be\r\ndiscovered. It is evidently in part gaseous, but it also probably\r\ncontains matter in the form of dust and small meteors. It includes one\r\nsubstance altogether mysterious—“coronium.” There are reasons for\r\nthinking that this may be the lightest of all the elements, and\r\nProfessor Young, its discoverer, said that it was “absolutely unique in\r\nnature; utterly distinct from any other known form of matter,\r\nterrestial, solar, or cosmical.” The enormous extent of the corona is\r\none of its riddles. Since the development of the curious subject of the\r\n“pressure of light” it has been proposed to account for the\r\nsustentation of the corona by supposing that it is borne upon the\r\nbillows of light continually poured out from the sun. Experiment has\r\nproved, what mathematical considerations had previously pointed out as\r\nprobable, that the waves of light exert a pressure or driving force,\r\nwhich becomes evident in its effects if the body acted upon is\r\nsufficiently small. In that case the light pressure will prevail over\r\nthe attraction of gravitation, and propel the attenuated matter away\r\nfrom the sun in the teeth of its attraction. The earth itself would be\r\ndriven away if, instead of consisting of a solid globe of immense\r\naggregate mass, it were a cloud of microscopic particles. The reason is\r\nthat the pressure varies in proportion to the _surface_ of the body\r\nacted upon, while the gravitational attraction is proportional to the\r\n_volume,_ or the total amount of matter in the body. But the surface of\r\nany body depends upon the _square_ of its diameter, while the volume\r\ndepends upon the _cube_ of the diameter. If, for instance, the diameter\r\nis represented by 4, the surface will be proportional to 4 × 4, or 16,\r\nand the volume to 4 × 4 × 4, or 64; but if the diameter is taken as 2,\r\nthe surface will be 2 × 2, or 4, and the volume 2 × 2 × 2, or 8. Now,\r\nthe ratio of 4 to 8 is twice as great as that of 16 to 64. If the\r\ndiameter is still further decreased, the ratio of the surface to the\r\nvolume will proportionally grow larger; in other words, the pressure\r\nwill gain upon the attraction, and whatever their original ratio may\r\nhave been, a time will come, if the diminution of size continues, when\r\nthe pressure will become more effective than the attraction, and the\r\nbody will be driven away. Supposing the particles of the corona to be\r\nbelow the critical size for the attraction of a mass like that of the\r\nsun to control them, they would be driven off into the surrounding\r\nspace and appear around the sun like the clouds of dust around a mill.\r\nWe shall return to this subject in connection with the Zodiacal Light,\r\nthe Aurora, and Comets.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are parts of the corona which suggest by their\r\nforms the play of electric or magnetic forces. This is beautifully\r\nshown in some of the photographs that have been made of the corona\r\nduring recent eclipses. Take, for instance, that of the eclipse of\r\n1900. The sheaves of light emanating from the poles look precisely like\r\nthe “lines of force” surrounding the poles of a magnet. It will be\r\nnoticed in this photograph that the corona appears to consist of two\r\nportions: one comprising the polar rays just spoken of, and the other\r\nconsisting of the broader, longer, and less-defined masses of light\r\nextending out from the equatorial and middle-latitude zones. Yet even\r\nin this more diffuse part of the phenomenon one can detect the presence\r\nof submerged curves bearing more or less resemblance to those about the\r\npoles. Just what part electricity or electro-magnetism plays in the\r\nmechanism of the solar radiation it is impossible to say, but on the\r\nassumption that it is a very important part is based the hypothesis\r\nthat there exists a direct solar influence not only upon the magnetism,\r\nbut upon the weather of the earth. This hypothesis has been under\r\ndiscussion for half a century, and still we do not know just how much\r\ntruth it represents. It is certain that the outbreak of great\r\ndisturbances on the sun, accompanied by the formation of sun-spots and\r\nthe upshooting of eruptive prominences (phenomena which we should\r\nnaturally expect to be attended by action), have been instantly\r\nfollowed by corresponding “magnetic storms” on the earth and brilliant\r\ndisplays of the auroral lights. There have been occasions when the\r\ninfluence has manifested itself in the most startling ways, a great\r\nsolar outburst being followed by a mysterious gripping of the cable and\r\ntelegraph systems of the world, as if an invisible and irresistible\r\nhand had seized them. Messages are abruptly cut off, sparks leap from\r\nthe telegraph instruments, and the entire earth seems to have been\r\nthrown into a magnetic flurry. These occurrences affect the mind with a\r\ndeep impression of the dependence of our planet on the sun, such as we\r\ndo not derive from the more familiar action of the sunlight on the\r\ngrowth of plants and other phenomena of life depending on solar\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the theory of solar magnetic influence upon the weather is best\r\nknown in connection with the “sun-spot cycle.” This, at any rate, is,\r\nas already remarked, closely associated with the corona. Its existence\r\nwas discovered in 1843 by the German astronomer Schwabe. It is a period\r\nof variable length, averaging about eleven years, during which the\r\nnumber of spots visible on the sun first increases to a maximum, then\r\ndiminishes to a minimum, and finally increases again to a maximum. For\r\nunknown reasons the period is sometimes two or three years longer than\r\nthe average and sometimes as much shorter. Nevertheless, the phenomena\r\nalways recur in the same order. Starting, for instance, with a time\r\nwhen the observer can find few or no spots, they gradually increase in\r\nnumber and size until a maximum, in both senses, is reached, during\r\nwhich the spots are often of enormous size and exceedingly active.\r\nAfter two or three years they begin to diminish in number, magnitude,\r\nand activity until they almost or quite disappear. A strange fact is\r\nthat when a new period opens, the spots appear first in high northern\r\nand southern latitudes, far from the solar equator, and as the period\r\nadvances they not only increase in number and size, but break out\r\nnearer and nearer to the equator, the last spots of a vanishing period\r\nsometimes lingering in the equatorial region after the advance-guard of\r\nits successor has made its appearance in the high latitudes. Spots are\r\nnever seen on the equator nor near the poles. It was not very long\r\nafter the discovery of the sun-spot cycle that the curious observation\r\nwas made that a striking coincidence existed between the period of the\r\nsun-spots and another period affecting the general magnetic condition\r\nof the earth. When a curved line representing the varying number of\r\nsun-spots was compared with another curve showing the variations in the\r\nmagnetic state of the earth the two were seen to be in almost exact\r\naccord, a rise in one curve corresponding to a rise in the other, and a\r\nfall to a fall. Continued observation has proved that this is a real\r\ncoincidence and not an accidental one, so that the connection, although\r\nas yet unexplained, is accepted as established. But does the influence\r\nextend further, and directly affect the weather and the seasons as well\r\nas the magnetic elements of the earth? A final answer to this question\r\ncannot yet be given, for the evidence is contradictory, and the\r\ninterpretations put upon it depend largely on the predilections of the\r\njudges.\r\n\r\nBut, in a broad sense, the sun-spots and the phenomena connected with\r\nthem _must_ have a relation to terrestial meteorology, for they prove\r\nthe sun to be a variable star. Reference was made, a few lines above,\r\nto the resemblance of the spectra of sun-spots to those of certain\r\nstars which seem to be failing through age. This in itself is extremely\r\nsuggestive; but if this resemblance had never been discovered, we\r\nshould have been justified in regarding the sun as variable in its\r\noutput of energy; and not only variable, but probably increasingly so.\r\nThe very inequalities in the sun-spot cycle are suspicious. When the\r\nsun is most spotted its total light may be reduced by one-thousandth\r\npart, although it is by no means certain that its outgiving of thermal\r\nradiations is then reduced. A loss of one-thousandth of its luminosity\r\nwould correspond to a decrease of .0025 of a stellar magnitude,\r\nconsidering the sun as a star viewed from distant space. So slight a\r\nchange would not be perceptible; but it is not alone sun-spots which\r\nobscure the solar surface, its entire globe is enveloped with an\r\nobscuring veil. When studied with a powerful telescope the sun’s\r\nsurface is seen to be thickly mottled with relatively obscure specks,\r\nso numerous that it has been estimated that they cut off from one-tenth\r\nto one-twentieth of the light that we should receive from it if the\r\nwhole surface were as brilliant as its brightest parts. The condition\r\nof other stars warrants the conclusion that this obscuring envelope is\r\nthe product of a process of refrigeration which will gradually make the\r\nsun more and more variable until its history ends in extinction.\r\nLooking backward, we see a time when the sun must have been more\r\nbrilliant than it is now. At that time it probably shone with the\r\nblinding white splendor of such stars as Sirius, Spica, and Vega; now\r\nit resembles the relatively dull Procyon; in time it will turn ruddy\r\nand fall into the closing cycle represented by Antares. Considering\r\nthat once it must have been more radiantly powerful than at present,\r\none is tempted to wonder if that could have been the time when tropical\r\nlife flourished within the earth’s polar circles, sustained by a\r\nvivific energy in the sun which it has now lost.\r\n\r\nThe corona, as we have said, varies with the sun-spot cycle. When the\r\nspots are abundant and active the corona rises strong above the spotted\r\nzones, forming immense beams or streamers, which on one occasion, at\r\nleast, had an observed length of _ten million miles._ At the time of a\r\nspot minimum the corona is less brilliant and has a different outline.\r\nIt is then that the curved polar rays are most conspicuous. Thus the\r\nvast banners of the sun, shaken out in the eclipse, are signals to tell\r\nof its varying state, but it will probably be long before we can read\r\ncorrectly their messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nThe Zodiacal Light Mystery\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a singular phenomenon in the sky—one of the most puzzling of\r\nall—which has long arrested the attention of astronomers, defying their\r\nefforts at explanation, but which probably not one in a hundred, and\r\npossibly not one in a thousand, of the readers of this book has ever\r\nseen. Yet its name is often spoken, and it is a conspicuous object if\r\none knows when and where to look for it, and when well seen it exhibits\r\na mystical beauty which at the same time charms and awes the beholder.\r\nIt is called “The Zodiacal Light,” because it lies within the broad\r\ncircle of the Zodiac, marking the sun’s apparent annual path through\r\nthe stars. What it is nobody has yet been able to find out with\r\ncertainty, and books on astronomy usually speak of it with singular\r\nreserve. But it has given rise to many remarkable theories, and a true\r\nexplanation of it would probably throw light on a great many other\r\ncelestial mysteries. The Milky Way is a more wonderful object to look\r\nupon, but its nature can be comprehended, while there is a sort of\r\nuncanniness about the Zodiacal Light which immediately impresses one\r\nupon seeing it, for its part in the great scheme of extra-terrestrial\r\naffairs is not evident.\r\n\r\nIf you are out-of-doors soon after sunset—say, on an evening late in\r\nthe month of February—you may perceive, just after the angry flush of\r\nthe dying winter’s day has faded from the sky, a pale ghostly presence\r\nrising above the place where the sun went down. The writer remembers\r\nfrom boyhood the first time it was pointed out to him and the unearthly\r\nimpression that it made, so that he afterward avoided being out alone\r\nat night, fearful of seeing the spectral thing again. The phenomenon\r\nbrightens slowly with the fading of the twilight, and soon distinctly\r\nassumes the shape of an elongated pyramid of pearly light, leaning\r\ntoward the south if the place of observation is in the northern\r\nhemisphere. It does not impress the observer at all in the same manner\r\nas the Milky Way; that looks far off and is clearly among the stars,\r\nbut the Zodiacal Light seems closer at hand, as if it were something\r\nmore intimately concerning the earth. To all it immediately suggests a\r\nconnection, also, with the sunken sun. If the night is clear and the\r\nmoon absent (and if you are in the country, for city lights ruin the\r\nspectacles of the sky), you will be able to watch the apparition for a\r\nlong time. You will observe that the light is brightest near the\r\nhorizon, gradually fading as the pyramidal beam mounts higher, but in\r\nfavorable circumstances it may be traced nearly to the meridian south\r\nof the zenith, where its apex at last vanishes in the starlight. It\r\ncontinues visible during the evenings of March and part of April, after\r\nwhich, ordinarily, it is seen no more, or if seen is relatively faint\r\nand unimpressive. But when autumn comes it appears again, this time not\r\nlike a wraith hovering above the westward tomb of the day-god, but\r\nrather like a spirit of the morning announcing his reincarnation in the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Zodiacal Light is best seen in our latitudes at the\r\nperiods just mentioned is because at those times the Zodiac is more\r\nnearly perpendicular to the horizon, first in the west and then in the\r\neast; and, since the phenomenon is confined within the borders of the\r\nZodiac, it cannot be favorably placed for observation when the zodiacal\r\nplane is but slightly inclined to the horizon. Its faint light requires\r\nthe contrast of a background of dark sky in order to be readily\r\nperceptible. But within the tropics, where the Zodiac is always at a\r\nfavorable angle, the mysterious light is more constantly visible.\r\nNearly all observant travelers in the equatorial regions have taken\r\nparticular note of this phenomenon, for being so much more conspicuous\r\nthere than in the temperate zones it at once catches the eye and holds\r\nthe attention as a novelty. Humboldt mentions it many times in his\r\nworks, for his genius was always attracted by things out of the\r\nordinary and difficult of explanation, and he made many careful\r\nobservations on its shape, its brilliancy, and its variations; for\r\nthere can be no doubt that it does vary, and sometimes to an\r\nastonishing degree. It is said that it once remained practically\r\ninvisible in Europe for several years in succession. During a trip to\r\nSouth Africa in 1909 an English astronomer, Mr E. W. Maunder, found a\r\nremarkable difference between the appearance of the Zodiacal Light on\r\nhis going and coming voyages. In fact, when crossing the equator going\r\nsouth he did not see it at all; but on returning he had, on March 6th,\r\nwhen one degree south of the equator, a memorable view of it.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, clear night, and the Zodiacal Light was\r\nextraordinarily brilliant—brighter than he had ever seen it before. The\r\nMilky Way was not to be compared with it. The brightest part extended\r\n75° from the sun. There was a faint and much narrower extension which\r\nthey could just make out beyond the Pleiades along the ecliptic, but\r\nthe greater part of the Zodiacal Light showed as a broad truncated\r\ncolumn, and it did not appear nearly as conical as he had before seen\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen out of the brief twilight of intertropical lands, where the sun\r\ndrops vertically to the horizon and night rushes on like a wave of\r\ndarkness, the Zodiacal Light shoots to the very zenith, its color is\r\ndescribed as a golden tint, entirely different from the silvery sheen\r\nof the Milky Way. If I may venture again to refer to personal\r\nexperiences and impressions, I will recall a view of the Zodiacal Light\r\nfrom the summit of the cone of Mt Etna in the autumn of the year 1896\r\n(more briefly described in _Astronomy with the Naked Eye_). There are\r\nfew lofty mountains so favorably placed as Etna for observations of\r\nthis kind. It was once resorted to by Prof. George E. Hale, in an\r\nattempt to see the solar corona without an eclipse. Rising directly\r\nfrom sea-level to an elevation of nearly eleven thousand feet, the\r\nobserver on its summit at night finds himself, as it were, lost in the\r\nmidst of the sky. But for the black flanks of the great cone on which\r\nhe stands he might fancy himself to be in a balloon. On the occasion to\r\nwhich I refer the world beneath was virtually invisible in the moonless\r\nnight. The blaze of the constellations overhead was astonishingly\r\nbrilliant, yet amid all their magnificence my attention was immediately\r\ndrawn to a great tapering light that sprang from the place on the\r\nhorizon where the sun would rise later, and that seemed to be blown out\r\nover the stars like a long, luminous veil. It was the finest view of\r\nthe Zodiacal light that I had ever enjoyed—thrilling in its\r\nstrangeness—but I was almost disheartened by the indifference of my\r\nguide, to whom it was only a light and nothing more. If he had no\r\nscience, he had less poetry—rather a remarkable thing, I thought, for a\r\nchild of his clime. The Light appeared to me to be distinctly brighter\r\nthan the visible part of the Milky Way which included the brilliant\r\nstretches in Auriga and Perseus, and its color, if one may speak of\r\ncolor in connection with such an object, seemed richer than that of the\r\ngalactic band; but I did not think of it as yellow, although Humboldt\r\nhas described it as resembling a golden curtain drawn over the stars,\r\nand Du Chaillu in Equatorial Africa found it of a bright yellow color.\r\nIt may vary in color as in conspicuousness. The fascination of that\r\nextraordinary sight has never faded from my memory. I turned to regard\r\nit again and again, although I had never seen the stellar heavens so\r\nbrilliant, and it was one of the last things I looked for when the\r\nmorning glow began softly to mount in the east, and Sicily and the\r\nMediterranean slowly emerged from the profound shadow beneath us.\r\n\r\nThe Zodiacal Light seems never to have attracted from astronomers in\r\ngeneral the amount of careful attention that it deserves; perhaps\r\nbecause so little can really be made of it as far as explanation is\r\nconcerned. I have referred to the restraint that scientific writers\r\napparently feel in speaking of it. The grounds for speculation that it\r\naffords may be too scanty to lead to long discussions, yet it piques\r\ncuriosity, and as we shall see in a moment has finally led to a most\r\ninteresting theory. Once it was the subject of an elaborate series of\r\nstudies which carried the observer all round the world. That was in\r\n1845—46, during the United States Exploring Expedition that visited the\r\nthen little known Japan. The chaplain of the fleet, the Rev. Mr Jones,\r\nwent out prepared to study the mysterious light in all its phases. He\r\nsaw it from many latitudes on both sides of the equator, and the\r\nimagination cannot but follow him with keen interest in his\r\nworld-circling tour, keeping his eyes every night fixed upon the\r\nphantasm overhead, whose position shifted with that of the hidden sun.\r\nHe demonstrated that the flow extends at times completely across the\r\ncelestial dome, although it is relatively faint directly behind the\r\nearth. On his return the government published a large volume of his\r\nobservations, in which he undertook to show that the phenomenon was due\r\nto the reflection of sunlight from a ring of meteoric bodies encircling\r\nthe earth. But, after all, this elaborate investigation settled\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nProf. E. E. Barnard has more recently devoted much attention to the\r\nZodiacal Light, as well as to a strange attendant phenomenon called the\r\n“Gegenschein,” or Counterglow, because it always appears at that point\r\nin the sky which is exactly opposite the sun. The Gegenschein is an\r\nextremely elusive phenomenon, suitable only for eyes that have been\r\nspecially trained to see it. Professor Newcomb has cautiously remarked\r\nthat\r\n\r\nit is said that in that point of the heavens directly opposite the sun\r\nthere is an elliptical patch of light... This phenomenon is so\r\ndifficult to account for that its existence is sometimes doubted; yet\r\nthe testimony in its favor is difficult to set aside.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt certainly cannot be set aside at all since the observations of\r\nBarnard. I recall an attempt to see it under his guidance during a\r\nvisit to Mount Hamilton, when he was occupied there with the Lick\r\ntelescope. Of course, both the Gegenschein and the Zodiacal Light are\r\ntoo diffuse to be studied with telescopes, which, so to speak, magnify\r\nthem out of existence. They can only be successfully studied with the\r\nnaked eye, since every faintest glimmer that they afford must be\r\nutilized. This is especially true of the Gegenschein. At Mount\r\nHamilton, Mr Barnard pointed out to me its location with reference to\r\ncertain stars, but with all my gazing I could not be sure that I saw\r\nit. To him, on the contrary, it was obvious; he had studied it for\r\nmonths, and was able to indicate its shape, its boundaries, its\r\ndiameter, and the declination of its center with regard to the\r\necliptic. There is not, of course, the shadow of a doubt of the\r\nexistence of the Gegenschein, and yet I question if one person in a\r\nmillion has ever seen or ever will see it. The Zodiacal Light, on the\r\nother hand, is plain enough, provided that the time and the\r\ncircumstances of the observation are properly chosen.\r\n\r\nIn the attempts to explain the Zodiacal Light, the favorite hypothesis\r\nhas been that it is an appendage of the sun—perhaps simply an extension\r\nof the corona in the plane of the ecliptic, which is not very far from\r\ncoinciding with that of the sun’s equator. This idea is quite a natural\r\none, because of the evident relation of the light to the position of\r\nthe sun. The vast extension of the equatorial wings of the corona in\r\n1878 gave apparent support to this hypothesis; if the substance of the\r\ncorona could extend ten million miles from the sun, why might it not\r\nextend even one hundred million, gradually fading out beyond the orbit\r\nof the earth? A variation of this hypothesis assumes that the\r\nreflection is due to swarms of meteors circling about the sun, in the\r\nplane of its equator, all the way from its immediate neighborhood to a\r\ndistance exceeding that of the earth. But in neither form is the\r\nhypothesis satisfactory; there is nothing in the appearance of the\r\ncorona to indicate that it extends even as far as the planet Mercury,\r\nwhile as to meteors, the orbits of the known swarms do not accord with\r\nthe hypothesis, and we have no reason to believe that clouds of others\r\nexist traveling in the part of space where they would have to be in\r\norder to answer the requirements of the theory. The extension of the\r\ncorona in 1878 did not resemble in its texture the Zodiacal Light.\r\n\r\nNow, it has so often happened in the history of science that an\r\nimportant discovery in one branch has thrown unexpected but most\r\nwelcome light upon some pending problem in some other branch, that a\r\nstrong argument might be based upon that fact alone against the too\r\nexclusive devotion of many investigators to the narrow lines of their\r\nown particular specialty; and the Zodiacal Light affords a case in\r\npoint, when it is considered in connection with recent discoveries in\r\nchemistry and physics. From the fact that atoms are compound bodies\r\nmade up of corpuscles at least a thousand times smaller than the\r\nsmallest known atom—a fact which astounded most men of science when it\r\nwas announced a few years ago—a new hypothesis has been developed\r\nconcerning the nature of the Zodiacal Light (as well as other\r\nastronomical riddles), and this hypothesis comes not from an\r\nastronomer, but from a chemist and physicist, the Swede, Svante\r\nArrhenius. In considering an outline of this new hypothesis we need\r\nneither accept nor reject it; it is a case rather for suspension of\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it carries us back to the “pressure of light” mentioned\r\nin the preceding chapter. The manner in which this pressure is believed\r\ngenerally to act was there sufficiently explained, and it only remains\r\nto see how it is theoretically extended to the particles of matter\r\nsupposed to constitute the Zodiacal Light. We know that corpuscles, or\r\n“fragments of atoms” negatively electrified, are discharged from hot\r\nbodies. Streams of these “ions” pour from many flames and from molten\r\nmetals; and the impact of the cathode and ultra-violet rays causes them\r\nto gush even from cold bodies. In the vast laboratory of the sun it is\r\nbut reasonable to suppose that similar processes are taking place. “As\r\na very hot metal emits these corpuscles,” says Prof. J. J. Thomson, “it\r\ndoes not seem an improbable hypothesis that they are emitted by that\r\nvery hot body, the sun.” Let it be assumed, then, that the sun does\r\nemit them; what happens next? Negatively charged corpuscles, it is\r\nknown, serve as nuclei to which particles of matter in the ordinary\r\nstate are attracted, and it is probable that those emitted from the sun\r\nimmediately pick up loads in this manner and so grow in bulk. If they\r\ngrow large enough the gravitation of the sun draws them back, and they\r\nproduce a negative charge in the solar atmosphere. But it is probable\r\nthat many of the particles do not attain the critical size which,\r\naccording to the principles before explained, would enable the\r\ngravitation of the sun to retain them in opposition to the pressure of\r\nthe waves of light, and with these particles the light pressure is\r\ndominant. Clouds of them may be supposed to be continually swept away\r\nfrom the sun into surrounding space, moving mostly in or near the plane\r\nof the solar equator, where the greatest activity, as indicated by\r\nsunspots and related phenomena, is taking place. As they pass outward\r\ninto space many of them encounter the earth. If the earth, like the\r\nmoon, had no atmosphere the particles would impinge directly on its\r\nsurface, giving it a negative electric charge. But the presence of the\r\natmosphere changes all that, for the first of the flying particles that\r\nencounter it impart to it their negative electricity, and then, since\r\nlike electric charges repel like, the storm of particles following will\r\nbe sheered off from the earth, and will stream around it in a maze of\r\nhyperbolic paths. Those that continue on into space beyond the earth\r\nmay be expected to continue picking up wandering particles of matter\r\nuntil their bulk has become so great that the solar attraction prevails\r\nagain over the light pressure acting upon them, and they turn again\r\nsunward. Passing the earth on their return they will increase the\r\namount of dust-clouds careering round it; and these will be further\r\nincreased by the action of the ultra-violet rays of the sunlight\r\ncausing particles to shoot radially away from the earth when the\r\nnegative charge of the upper atmosphere has reached a certain amount,\r\nwhich particles, although starting sunward, will be swept back to the\r\nearth with the oncoming streams. As the final result of all this\r\naccumulation of flying and gyrating particles in the earth’s\r\nneighborhood, we are told that the latter must be transformed into the\r\nsemblance of a gigantic solid-headed comet provided with streaming\r\ntails, the longest of them stretching away from the direction of the\r\nsun, while another shorter one extends toward the sun. This shorter\r\ntail is due to the particles that we have just spoken of as being\r\ndriven sunward from the earth by the action of ultra-violet light. No\r\ndoubt this whole subject is too technical for popular statement; but at\r\nany rate the general reader can understand the picturesque side of the\r\ntheory, for its advocates assure us that if we were on the moon we\r\nwould doubtless be able to see the comet-like tails of the earth, and\r\nthen we could appreciate the part that they play in producing the\r\nphenomenon of the Zodiacal Light.\r\n\r\nThat the Light as we see it could be produced by the reflection of\r\nsunlight from swarms of particles careering round the earth in the\r\nmanner supposed by Arrhenius’ hypothesis is evident enough; and it will\r\nbe observed that the new theory, after all, is only another variant of\r\nthe older one which attributes the Zodiacal Light to an extension of\r\nthe solar corona. But it differs from the older theory in offering an\r\nexplanation of the manner in which the extension is effected, and it\r\ndifferentiates between the corona proper and the streams of negative\r\nparticles shot away from the sun. In its details the hypothesis of\r\nArrhenius also affords an explanation of many peculiarities of the\r\nZodiacal Light, such as that it is confined to the neighborhood of the\r\necliptic, and that it is stronger on the side of the earth which is\r\njust turning away from a position under the sun than on the other side;\r\nbut it would carry us beyond our limits to go into these particulars.\r\nThe Gegenschein, according to this theory, is a part of the same\r\nphenomenon as the Zodiacal Light, for by the laws of perspective it is\r\nevident that the reflection from the streams of particles situated at a\r\npoint directly opposite to the sun would be at a maximum, and this is\r\nthe place which the Gegenschein occupies. Apart from its geometrical\r\nrelations to the position of the sun, the variability of the Zodiacal\r\nLight appears to affirm its solar dependence, and this too would be\r\naccounted for by Arrhenius’ hypothesis better than by the old theory of\r\ncoronal extension. The amount of corpuscular discharge from the sun\r\nmust naturally be governed by the state of relative activity or\r\ninactivity of the latter, and this could not but be reflected in the\r\nvarying splendor of the Zodiacal Light. But much more extended study\r\nthan has yet been given to the subject will be required before we can\r\nfeel that we know with reasonable certainty what this mysterious\r\nphenomenon really is. By the hypothesis of Arrhenius every planet that\r\nhas an atmosphere must have a Zodiacal Light attending it, but the\r\nphenomenon is too faint for us to be able to see it in the case, for\r\ninstance, of Venus, whose atmosphere is very abundant. The moon has no\r\ncorresponding “comet’s tail” because, as already explained, of the lack\r\nof a lunar atmosphere to repel the streams by becoming itself\r\nelectrified; but if there were a lunar Zodiacal Light, no doubt we\r\ncould see it because of the relative nearness of our satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\nMarvels of the Aurora\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most vivid recollections of my early boyhood is that of\r\nseeing my father return hastily into the house one evening and call out\r\nto the family: “Come outside and look at the sky!” Ours was a country\r\nhouse situated on a commanding site, and as we all emerged from the\r\ndoorway we were dumbfounded to see the heavens filled with pale flames\r\nwhich ran licking and quivering over the stars. Instantly there sprang\r\ninto my terrified mind the recollection of an awful description of “the\r\nDay of Judgment” (the _Dies Iræ_), which I had heard with much\r\nperturbation of spirit in the Dutch Reformed church from the lips of a\r\ntall, dark-browed, dreadfully-in-earnest preacher of the old-fashioned\r\ntype. My heart literally sank at sight of the spectacle, for it\r\nrecalled the preacher’s very words; it was just as he had said it would\r\nbe, and it needed the assured bearing of my elders finally to convince\r\nme that\r\n\r\nThat Day of Wrath, O dreadful day,\r\nWhen Heaven and Earth shall pass away,\r\nAs David and the Sibyl say\r\n\r\n\r\nhad not actually come upon us. And even the older members of the\r\nhousehold were not untouched with misgivings when menacing spots of\r\ncrimson appeared, breaking out now here, now there, in the shuddering\r\nsky. Toward the north the spectacle was appalling. A huge arch spanned\r\nan unnaturally dark segment resting on the horizon, and above this arch\r\nsprang up beams and streamers in a state of incessant agitation,\r\nsometimes shooting up to the zenith with a velocity that took one’s\r\nbreath, and sometimes suddenly falling into long ranks, and _marching,\r\nmarching, marching,_ like an endless phalanx of fiery specters, and\r\nmoving, as I remember, always from east to west. The absolute silence\r\nwith which these mysterious evolutions were performed and the quavering\r\nreflections which were thrown upon the ground increased the awfulness\r\nof the exhibition. Occasionally enormous curtains of lambent flame\r\nrolled and unrolled with a majestic motion, or were shaken to and fro\r\nas if by a mighty, noiseless wind. At times, too, a sudden billowing\r\nrush would be made toward the zenith, and for a minute the sky overhead\r\nwould glow so brightly that the stars seemed to have been consumed. The\r\nspectacle continued with varying intensity for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Auroral beams seen in England]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis exhibition occurred in Central New York, a latitude in which the\r\nAurora Borealis is seldom seen with so much splendor. I remember\r\nanother similar one seen from the city of New York in November, 1882.\r\nOn this last occasion some observers saw a great upright beam of light\r\nwhich majestically moved across the heavens, stalking like an\r\napparition in the midst of the auroral pageant, of whose general\r\nmovements it seemed to be independent, maintaining always its upright\r\nposture, and following a magnetic parallel from east to west. This\r\nmysterious beam was seen by no less than twenty-six observers in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, and a comparison of their observations\r\nled to a curious calculation indicating that the apparition was about\r\n_one hundred and thirty-three miles tall_ and moved at the speed of ten\r\nmiles per second!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Auroral arches of an eliptic form seen in the Arctic\r\nregions]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, as everybody knows, it is in the Arctic regions that the Aurora,\r\nor the “Northern Lights,” can best be seen. There, in the long polar\r\nnight, when for months together the sun does not rise, the strange\r\ncoruscations in the sky often afford a kind of spectral daylight in\r\nunison with the weird scenery of the world of ice. The pages in the\r\nnarratives of Arctic exploration that are devoted to descriptions of\r\nthe wonderful effects of the Northern Lights are second to none that\r\nman has ever penned in their fascination. The lights, as I have already\r\nintimated, display astonishing colors, particularly shades of red and\r\ngreen, as they flit from place to place in the sky. The discovery that\r\nthe magnetic needle is affected by the Aurora, quivering and darting\r\nabout in a state of extraordinary excitement when the lights are\r\nplaying in the sky, only added to the mystery of the phenomenon until\r\nits electro-magnetic nature had been established. This became evident\r\nas soon as it was known that the focus of the displays was the magnetic\r\npole; and when the far South was visited the Aurora Australis was\r\nfound, having its center at the South Magnetic Pole. Then, if not\r\nbefore, it was clear that the earth was a great globular magnet, having\r\nits poles of opposite magnetism, and that the auroral lights, whatever\r\ntheir precise cause might be, were manifestations of the magnetic\r\nactivity of our planet. After the invention of magnetic telegraphy it\r\nwas found that whenever a great Aurora occurred the telegraph lines\r\nwere interrupted in their operation, and the ocean cables ceased to\r\nwork. Such a phenomenon is called a “magnetic storm.”\r\n\r\nThe interest excited by the Aurora in scientific circles was greatly\r\nstimulated when, in the last half of the nineteenth century, it was\r\ndiscovered that it is a phenomenon intimately associated with\r\ndisturbances on the sun. The ancient “Zurich Chronicles,” extending\r\nfrom the year 1000 to the year 1800, in which both sun-spots visible to\r\nthe naked eye and great displays of the auroral lights were recorded,\r\nfirst set Rudolf Wolf on the track of this discovery. The first notable\r\nproof of the suspected connection was furnished with dramatic emphasis\r\nby an occurrence which happened on September 1, 1859. Near noon on that\r\nday two intensely brilliant points suddenly broke out in a group of\r\nsun-spots which were under observation by Mr R. C. Carrington at his\r\nobservatory at Redhill, England. The points remained visible for not\r\nmore than five minutes, during which interval they moved _thirty-five\r\nthousand miles_ across the solar disk. Mr R. Hodgson happened to see\r\nthe same phenomenon at his observatory at Highgate, and thus all\r\npossibility of deception was removed. But neither of the startled\r\nobservers could have anticipated what was to follow, and, indeed, it\r\nwas an occurrence which has never been precisely duplicated. I quote\r\nthe eloquent account given by Miss Clerke in her _History of Astronomy\r\nDuring the Nineteenth Century._\r\n\r\nThis unique phenomenon seemed as if specially designed to accentuate\r\nthe inference of a sympathetic relation between the earth and the sun.\r\nFrom August 28 to September 4, 1859, a magnetic storm of unparalleled\r\nintensity, extent, and duration was in progress over the entire globe.\r\nTelegraphic communication was everywhere interrupted—except, indeed,\r\nthat it was in some cases found practicable to work the lines _without\r\nbatteries_ by the agency of the earth-currents alone; sparks issued\r\nfrom the wires; gorgeous auroras draped the skies in solemn crimson\r\nover both hemispheres, and even in the tropics; the magnetic needle\r\nlost all trace of continuity in its movements and darted to and fro as\r\nif stricken with inexplicable panic. The coincidence was even closer.\r\n_At the very instant_ of the solar outburst witnessed by Carrington and\r\nHodgson the photographic apparatus at Kew registered a marked\r\ndisturbance of all the three magnetic elements; while shortly after the\r\nensuing midnight the electric agitation culminated, thrilling the whole\r\nearth with subtle vibrations, and lighting up the atmosphere from pole\r\nto pole with coruscating splendors which perhaps dimly recall the times\r\nwhen our ancient planet itself shone as a star.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this amazing occurrence stood alone, and as I have already said it\r\nhas never been exactly duplicated, doubt might be felt concerning some\r\nof the inferences drawn from it; but in varying forms it has been\r\nrepeated many times, so that now hardly anyone questions the reality of\r\nthe assumed connection between solar outbursts and magnetic storms\r\naccompanied by auroral displays on the earth. It is true that the late\r\nLord Kelvin raised difficulties in the way of the hypothesis of a\r\ndirect magnetic action of the sun upon the earth, because it seemed to\r\nhim that an inadmissible quantity of energy was demanded to account for\r\nsuch action. But no calculation like that which he made is final, since\r\nall calculations depend upon the validity of the data; and no authority\r\nis unshakable in science, because no man can possess omniscience. It\r\nwas Lord Kelvin who, but a few years before the thing was actually\r\naccomplished, declared that aerial navigation was an impracticable\r\ndream, and demonstrated its impracticability by calculation. However\r\nthe connection may be brought about, it is as certain as evidence can\r\nmake it that solar outbursts are coincident with terrestial magnetic\r\ndisturbances, and coincident in such a way as to make the inference of\r\na causal connection irresistible. The sun is only a little more than a\r\nhundred times its own diameter away from the earth. Why, then, with the\r\nsubtle connection between them afforded by the ether which conveys to\r\nus the blinding solar light and the life-sustaining solar heat, should\r\nit be so difficult to believe that the sun’s enormous electric energies\r\nfind a way to us also? No doubt the impulse coming from the sun acts\r\nupon the earth after the manner of a touch upon a trigger, releasing\r\nenergies which are already stored up in our planet.\r\n\r\nBut besides the evidence afforded by such occurrences as have been\r\nrelated of an intimate connection between solar outbreaks and\r\nterrestial magnetic flurries, attended by magnificent auroral displays,\r\nthere is another line of proof pointing in the same direction. Thus, it\r\nis known that the sun-spot period, as remarked in a preceding chapter,\r\ncoincides in a most remarkable manner with the periodic fluctuations in\r\nthe magnetic state of the earth. This coincidence runs into the most\r\nastonishing details. For instance, when the sun-spot period shortens,\r\nthe auroral period shortens to precisely the same extent; as the short\r\nsun-spot periods usually bring the most intense outbreaks of solar\r\nactivity, so the corresponding short auroral periods are attended by\r\nthe most violent magnetic storms; a secular period of about two hundred\r\nand twenty-two years affecting sun-spots is said to have its auroral\r\nduplicate; a shorter period of fifty-five and a half years, which some\r\nobservers believe that they have discovered appears also to be common\r\nto the two phenomena; and yet another “superposed” period of about\r\nthirty-five years, which some investigators aver exists, affects\r\nsun-spots and aurora alike. In short, the coincidences are so numerous\r\nand significant that one would have to throw the doctrine of\r\nprobability to the winds in order to be able to reject the conclusion\r\nto which they so plainly lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Auroral curtain seen in Scandinavia]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut still the question recurs: How is the influence transmitted? Here\r\nArrhenius comes once more with his hypothesis of negative corpuscles,\r\nor ions, driven away from the sun by light-pressure—a hypothesis which\r\nseems to explain so many things—and offers it also as an explanation of\r\nthe way in which the sun creates the Aurora. He would give the Aurora\r\nthe same lineage with the Zodiacal Light. To understand the application\r\nof this theory we must first recall the fact that the earth is a great\r\nmagnet having its two opposite poles of magnetism, one near the Arctic\r\nand the other near the Antarctic Circle. Like all magnets, the earth is\r\nsurrounded with “lines of force,” which, after the manner of the curved\r\nrays we saw in the photograph of a solar eclipse, start from a pole,\r\nrising at first nearly vertically, then bend gradually over, passing\r\nhigh above the equator, and finally descending in converging sheaves to\r\nthe opposite pole. Now the axis of the earth is so placed in space that\r\nit lies at nearly a right angle to the direction of the sun, and as the\r\nstreams of negatively charged particles come pouring on from the sun\r\n(see the last preceding chapter), they arrive in the greatest numbers\r\nover the earth’s equatorial regions. There they encounter the lines of\r\nmagnetic force at the place where the latter have their greatest\r\nelevation above the earth, and where their direction is horizontal to\r\nthe earth’s surface. Obeying a law which has been demonstrated in the\r\nlaboratory, the particles then follow the lines of force toward the\r\npoles. While they are above the equatorial regions they do not become\r\nluminescent, because at the great elevation that they there occupy\r\nthere is virtually no atmosphere; but as they pass on toward the north\r\nand the south they begin to descend with the lines of force, curving\r\ndown to meet at the poles; and, encountering a part of the atmosphere\r\ncomparable in density with what remains in an exhausted Crookes tube,\r\nthey produce a glow of cathode rays. This glow is conceived to\r\nrepresent the Aurora, which may consequently be likened to a gigantic\r\nexhibition of vacuum-tube lights. Anybody who recalls his student days\r\nin the college laboratory and who has witnessed a display of Northern\r\nLights will at once recognize the resemblance between them in colors,\r\nforms, and behavior. This resemblance had often been noted before\r\nArrhenius elaborated his hypothesis.\r\n\r\nWithout intending to treat his interesting theory as more than a\r\npossibly correct explanation of the phenomena of the Aurora, we may\r\ncall attention to some apparently confirmatory facts. One of the most\r\nstriking of these relates to a seasonal variation in the average number\r\nof auroræ. It has been observed that there are more in March and\r\nSeptember than at any other time of the year, and fewer in June and\r\nDecember; moreover (and this is a delicate test as applied to the\r\ntheory), they are slightly rarer in June than in December. Now all\r\nthese facts seem to find a ready explanation in the hypothesis of\r\nArrhenius, thus: (1) The particles issuing from the sun are supposed to\r\ncome principally from the regions whose excitement is indicated by the\r\npresence of sun-spots (which accords with Hale’s observation that\r\nsun-spots are columns of ionized vapors), and these regions have a\r\ndefinite location on either side of the solar equator, seldom\r\napproaching it nearer than within 5° or 10° north or south, and never\r\nextending much beyond 35° toward either pole; (2) The equator of the\r\nsun is inclined about 7° to the plane of the earth’s orbit, from which\r\nit results that twice in a year—_viz.,_ in June and December—the earth\r\nis directly over the solar equator, and twice a year—_viz.,_ in March\r\nand September—when it is farthest north or south of the solar equator,\r\nit is over the inner edge of the sun-spot belts. Since the corpuscles\r\nmust be supposed to be propelled radially from the sun, few will reach\r\nthe earth when the latter is over the solar equator in June and\r\nDecember, but when it is over, or nearly over, the spot belts, in March\r\nand September, it will be in the line of fire of the more active parts\r\nof the solar surface, and relatively rich streams of particles will\r\nreach it. This, as will be seen from what has been said above, is in\r\nstrict accord with the observed variations in the frequency of auroræ.\r\nEven the fact that somewhat fewer auroræ are seen in June than in\r\nDecember also finds its explanation in the known fact that the earth is\r\nabout three million miles nearer the sun in the winter than in the\r\nsummer, and the number of particles reaching it will vary, like the\r\nintensity of light, inversely as the square of the distance. These\r\ncoincidences are certainly very striking, and they have a cumulative\r\nforce. If we accept the theory, it would appear that we ought to\r\ncongratulate ourselves that the inclination of the sun’s equator is so\r\nslight, for as things stand the earth is never directly over the most\r\nactive regions of the sun-spots, and consequently never suffers from\r\nthe maximum bombardment of charged particles of which the sun is\r\ncapable. Incessant auroral displays, with their undulating draperies,\r\nflitting colors, and marching columns might not be objectionable from\r\nthe point of view of picturesqueness, but one magnetic storm of extreme\r\nintensity following closely upon the heels of another, for months on\r\nend, crazing the magnetic needle and continually putting the telegraph\r\nand cable lines out of commission, to say nothing of their effect upon\r\n“wireless telegraphy”, would hardly add to the charms of terrestrial\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Auroral arches seen in Scandinavia]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne or two other curious points in connection with Arrhenius’\r\nhypothesis may be mentioned. First, the number of auroræ, according to\r\nhis explanation, ought to be greatest in the daytime, when the face of\r\nthe earth on the sunward side is directly exposed to the atomic\r\nbombardment. Of course visual observation can give us no information\r\nabout this, since the light of the Aurora is never sufficiently intense\r\nto be visible in the presence of daylight, but the records of the\r\nmagnetic observatories can be, and have been, appealed to for\r\ninformation, and they indicate that the facts actually accord with the\r\ntheory. Behind the veil of sunlight in the middle of the afternoon,\r\nthere is good reason to believe, auroral exhibitions often take place\r\nwhich would eclipse in magnificence those seen at night if we could\r\nbehold them. Observation shows, too, that auroræ are more frequent\r\nbefore than after midnight, which is just what we should expect if they\r\noriginate in the way that Arrhenius supposes. Second, the theory offers\r\nan explanation of the alleged fact that the formation of clouds in the\r\nupper air is more frequent in years when auroræ are most abundant,\r\nbecause clouds are the result of the condensation of moisture upon\r\nfloating particles in the atmosphere (in an absolutely dustless\r\natmosphere there would be no clouds), and it has been proved that\r\nnegative ions like those supposed to come from the sun play a master\r\npart in the phenomena of cloud formation.\r\n\r\nYet another singular fact, almost mystical in its suggestions, may be\r\nmentioned. It seems that the dance of the auroral lights occurs most\r\nfrequently during the absence of the moon from the hemisphere in which\r\nthey appear, and that they flee, in greater part, to the opposite\r\nhemisphere when the moon’s revolution in an orbit considerably inclined\r\nto the earth’s equator brings her into that where they have been\r\nperforming. Arrhenius himself discovered this curious relation of\r\nauroral frequency to the position of the moon north or south of the\r\nequator, and he explains it in this way. The moon, like the earth, is\r\nexposed to the influx of the ions from the sun; but having no\r\natmosphere, or almost none, to interfere with them, they descend\r\ndirectly upon her surface and charge her with an electric negative\r\npotential to a very high degree. In consequence of this she affects the\r\nelectric state of the upper parts of the earth’s atmosphere where they\r\nlie most directly beneath her, and thus prevents, to a large extent,\r\nthe negative discharges to which the appearance of the Aurora is due.\r\nAnd so “the extravagant and erring spirit” of the Aurora avoids the\r\nmoon as Hamlet’s ghost fled at the voice of the cock announcing the\r\nawakening of the god of day.\r\n\r\nThere are even other apparent confirmations of the hypothesis, but we\r\nneed not go into them. We shall, however, find one more application of\r\nit in the next chapter, for it appears to be a kind of cure-all for\r\nastronomical troubles; at any rate it offers a conceivable solution of\r\nthe question, How does the sun manage to transmit its electric\r\ninfluence to the earth? And this solution is so grandiose in\r\nconception, and so novel in the mental pictures that it offers, that\r\nits acceptance would not in the least detract from the impression that\r\nthe Aurora makes upon the imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\nStrange Adventures of Comets\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fears and legends of ancient times before Science was born, and the\r\nsuperstitions of the Dark Ages, sedulously cultivated for theological\r\npurposes by monks and priests, have so colored our ideas of the\r\ninfluence that comets have had upon the human mind that many readers\r\nmay be surprised to learn that it was the apparition of a wonderful\r\ncomet, that of 1843, which led to the foundation of our greatest\r\nastronomical institution, the Harvard College Observatory. No doubt the\r\ncomet superstition existed half a century ago, as, indeed, it exists\r\nyet today, but in this case the marvelous spectacle in the sky proved\r\nless effective in inspiring terror than in awakening a desire for\r\nknowledge. Even in the sixteenth century the views that enlightened\r\nminds took of comets tended powerfully to inspire popular confidence in\r\nscience, and Halley’s prediction, after seeing and studying the motion\r\nof the comet which appeared in 1682, that it would prove to be a\r\nregular member of the sun’s family and would be seen returning after a\r\nperiod of about seventy-six years, together with the fulfillment of\r\nthat prediction, produced a revulsion from the superstitious notions\r\nwhich had so long prevailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swift’s comet. Taken at Arequipa, March 30 1892]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen the facts were made plain that comets are subject to the law of\r\ngravitation equally with the planets; that there are many which\r\nregularly return to the neighborhood of the sun (perihelion); and that\r\nthese travel in orbits differing from those of the planets only in\r\ntheir greater eccentricity, although they have the peculiarity that\r\nthey do not, like the planets, all go round the sun in the same\r\ndirection, and do not keep within the general plane of the planetary\r\nsystem, but traverse it sometimes from above and sometimes from below.\r\nOther comets, including most of the “great” ones, appear to travel in\r\nparabolic or, in a few cases, hyperbolic orbits, which, not being\r\nclosed curves, never bring them back again. But it is not certain that\r\nthese orbits may not be extremely eccentric ellipses, and that after\r\nthe lapse of hundreds, or thousands, of years the comets that follow\r\nthem may not reappear. The question is an interesting one, because if\r\nall orbits are really ellipses, then all comets must be permanent\r\nmembers of the solar system, while in the contrary case many of them\r\nare simply visitors, seen once and never to be seen again. The\r\nhypothesis that comets are originally interlopers might seem to derive\r\nsome support from the fact that the certainly periodic ones are\r\nassociated, in groups, with the great outer planets, whose attraction\r\nappears to have served as a trap for them by turning them into\r\nelliptical orbits and thus making them prisoners in the solar system.\r\nJupiter, owing to his great mass and his commanding situation in the\r\nsystem, is the chief “comet-catcher;” but he catches them not for\r\nhimself, but for the sun. Yet if comets do come originally from without\r\nthe borders of the planetary system, it does not, by any means, follow\r\nthat they were wanderers at large in space before they yielded to the\r\novermastering attraction of the sun. Investigation of the known\r\ncometary orbits, combined with theoretical considerations, has led some\r\nastronomers to the conclusion that as the sun travels onward through\r\nspace he “picks up _en route_” cometary masses which, without belonging\r\nstrictly to his empire, are borne along in the same vast “cosmical\r\ncurrent” that carries the solar system.\r\n\r\nBut while no intelligent person any longer thinks that the appearance\r\nof a great comet is a token from the heavenly powers of the approaching\r\ndeath of a mighty ruler, or the outbreak of a devastating war, or the\r\ninfliction of a terrible plague upon wicked mankind, science itself has\r\ndiscovered mysteries about comets which are not less fascinating\r\nbecause they are more intellectual than the irrational fancies that\r\nthey have displaced. To bring the subject properly before the mind, let\r\nus see what the principal phenomena connected with a comet are.\r\n\r\nAt the present day comets are ordinarily “picked up” with the telescope\r\nor the photographic plate before any one except their discoverer is\r\naware of their existence, and usually they remain so insignificant in\r\nappearance that only astronomers ever see them. Yet so great is the\r\nprestige of the word “comet” that the discovery of one of these\r\ninconspicuous wanderers, and its subsequent movements, become items of\r\nthe day’s news which everybody reads with the feeling, perhaps, that at\r\nleast he knows what is going on in the universe even if he doesn’t\r\nunderstand it. But a truly great comet presents quite a different\r\nproposition. It, too, is apt to be detected coming out of the depths of\r\nspace before the world at large can get a glimpse of it, but as it\r\napproaches the sun its aspect undergoes a marvelous change. Agitated\r\napparently by solar influence, it throws out a long streaming tail of\r\nnebulous light, directed away from the sun and looking as if blown out\r\nlike a pennon by a powerful wind. Whatever may be the position of the\r\ncomet with regard to the sun, as it circles round him it continually\r\nkeeps its tail on the off side. This, as we shall soon see, is a fact\r\nof capital importance in relation to the probable nature of comets’\r\ntails. Almost at the same time that the formation of the tail is\r\nobserved a remarkable change takes place in the comet’s head, which, by\r\nthe way, is invariably and not merely occasionally its most important\r\npart. On approaching the sun the head usually contracts. Coincidently\r\nwith this contraction a nucleus generally makes its appearance. This is\r\na bright, star-like point in the head, and it probably represents the\r\ntotality of solid matter that the comet possesses. But it is regarded\r\nas extremely unlikely that even the nucleus consists of a uniformly\r\nsolid mass. If it were such, comets would be far more formidable\r\nvisitors when they pass near the planets than they have been found to\r\nbe. The diameter of the nucleus may vary from a few hundred up to\r\nseveral thousand miles; the heads, on the average, are from twenty-five\r\nthousand to one hundred thousand miles in diameter, although a few have\r\ngreatly exceeded these dimensions; that of the comet of 1811, one of\r\nthe most stupendous ever seen, was a million and a quarter miles in\r\ndiameter! As to the tails, not withstanding their enormous length—some\r\nhave been more than a hundred million miles long—there is reason to\r\nbelieve that they are of extreme tenuity, “as rare as vacuum.” The\r\nsmallest stars have been seen shining through their most brilliant\r\nportions with undiminished luster.\r\n\r\nAfter the nucleus has been formed it begins to throw out bright jets\r\ndirected toward the sun. A stream, and sometimes several streams, of\r\nlight also project sunward from the nucleus, occasionally appearing\r\nlike a stunted tail directed oppositely to the real tail. Symmetrical\r\nenvelopes which, seen in section, appear as half circles or parabolas,\r\nrise sunward from the nucleus, forming a concentric series. The ends of\r\nthese stream backward into the tail, to which they seem to supply\r\nmaterial. Ordinarily the formation of these ejections and envelopes is\r\nattended by intense agitation of the nucleus, which twists and turns,\r\nswinging and gyrating with an appearance of the greatest violence.\r\nSometimes the nucleus is seen to break up into several parts. The\r\nentire heads of some comets have been split asunder in passing close\r\naround the sun; The comet of 1882 retreated into space after its\r\nperihelion passage with _five heads_ instead of the one that it had\r\noriginally, and each of these heads had its own tail!\r\n\r\nThe possession of the spectroscope has enabled astronomers during later\r\nyears to study the chemical composition of comets by analyzing their\r\nlight. At first the only substances thus discovered in them were\r\nhydro-carbon compounds, due evidently to the gaseous envelopes in which\r\nsome combination of hydrogen with carbon existed. Behind this gaseous\r\nspectrum was found a faint continuous spectrum ascribed to the nucleus,\r\nwhich apparently both reflects the sunlight and gives forth the light\r\nof a glowing solid or liquid. Subsequently sodium and iron lines were\r\nfound in cometary spectra. The presence of iron would seem to indicate\r\nthat some of these bodies may be much more massive than observations on\r\ntheir attractive effects have indicated. In some recent comets, such as\r\nMorehouse’s, in 1908, several lines have been found, the origin of\r\nwhich is unknown.\r\n\r\nWithout going back of the nineteenth century we may find records of\r\nsome of the most extraordinary comets that man has ever looked upon. In\r\n1811, still spoken of as “the year of the comet,” because of the\r\nwonderful vintage ascribed to the skyey visitor, a comet shaped like a\r\ngigantic sword amazed the whole world, and, as it remained visible for\r\nseventeen months, was regarded by superstitious persons as a symbol of\r\nthe fearful happenings of Napoleon’s Russian campaign. This comet, the\r\nextraordinary size of whose head, greatly exceeding that of the sun\r\nitself, has already been mentioned, was also remarkable for exhibiting\r\nso great a brilliancy without approaching even to the earth’s distance\r\nfrom the sun. But there was once a comet (and only once—in the year\r\n1729) which never got nearer to the sun than four times the distance of\r\nthe earth and yet appeared as a formidable object in the sky. As\r\nProfessor Young has remarked, “it must have been an enormous comet to\r\nbe visible from such a distance.” And we are to remember that there\r\nwere no great telescopes in the year 1729. That comet affects the\r\nimagination like a phantom of space peering into the solar system,\r\ndisplaying its enormous train afar off (which, if it had approached as\r\nnear as other comets, would probably have become _the_ celestial wonder\r\nof all human memory), and then turning away and vanishing in the depths\r\nof immensity.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 a comet appeared which was so brilliant that it could be seen\r\nin broad day close beside the sun! This was the first authenticated\r\ninstance of that kind, but the occurrence was to be repeated, as we\r\nshall see in a moment, less than forty years later.\r\n\r\nThe splendid comet of 1858, usually called Donati’s, is remembered by\r\nmany persons yet living. It was, perhaps, both as seen by the naked eye\r\nand with the telescope, the most beautiful comet of which we have any\r\nrecord. It too marked a rich vintage year, still remembered in the\r\nvineyards of France, where there is a popular belief that a great comet\r\nripens the grape and imparts to the wine a flavor not attainable by the\r\nmere skill of the cultivator. There are “comet wines,” carefully\r\ntreasured in certain cellars, and brought forth only when their owner\r\nwishes to treat his guests to a sip from paradise.\r\n\r\nThe year 1861 saw another very remarkable comet, of an aspect strangely\r\nvast and diffuse, which is believed to have swept the earth with its\r\nimmense tail when it passed between us and the sun on the night of June\r\n30th, an event which produced no other known effect than the appearance\r\nof an unwonted amount of scattered light in the sky.\r\n\r\nThe next very notable comet was the “Great Southern Comet” of 1880,\r\nwhich was not seen from the northern hemisphere. It mimicked the aspect\r\nof the famous comet of 1843, and to the great surprise of astronomers\r\nappeared to be traveling in the same path. This proved to be the rising\r\nof the curtain for an astronomical sensation unparalleled in its kind;\r\nfor two years later another brilliant comet appeared, first in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, _and it too followed the same track._ The\r\nstartling suggestion was now made that this comet was identical with\r\nthose of 1843 and 1880, its return having been hastened by the\r\nresistance experienced in passing twice through the coronal envelope,\r\nand there were some who thought that it would now swing swiftly round\r\nand then plunge straight into the sun, with consequences that might be\r\ndisastrous to us on account of the “flash of heat” that would be\r\nproduced by the impact. Nervous people were frightened, but observation\r\nsoon proved that the danger was imaginary, for although the comet\r\nalmost grazed the sun, and must have rushed through two or three\r\nmillion miles of the coronal region, no retardation of its immense\r\nvelocity was perceptible, and it finally passed away in a damaged\r\ncondition, as before remarked, and has never since appeared.\r\n\r\nThen the probable truth was perceived—_viz.,_ that the three comets\r\n(1843, 1880, and 1882) were not one identical body, but three separate\r\nones all traveling in the same orbit. It was found, too, that a comet\r\nseen in 1668 bore similar insignia of relationship. The natural\r\ninference was that these four bodies had once formed a single mass\r\nwhich had been split apart by the disruptive action of the sun.\r\nStrength was lent to this hypothesis by the fact that the comet of 1882\r\nwas apparently torn asunder during its perihelion passage, retreating\r\ninto space in a dissevered state. But Prof. George Forbes has a theory\r\nthat the splitting of the original cometary mass was effected by an\r\nunknown planet, probably greater than Jupiter, situated at a hundred\r\ntimes the earth’s distance from the sun, and revolving in a period of a\r\nthousand years. He supposes that the original comet was not that of\r\n1668, but one seen in 1556, which has since been “missing,” and that\r\nits disruption occurred from an encounter with the supposititious\r\nplanet about the year 1700. Truly from every point of view comets are\r\nthe most extraordinary of adventurers!\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1882 was likewise remarkable for being visible, like its\r\npredecessor of 1843, in full daylight in close proximity to the sun.\r\nThe story of its detection when almost in contact with the solar disk\r\nis dramatic. It had been discovered in the southern hemisphere only a\r\ncouple of weeks before its perihelion, which occurred on September\r\n17th, and on the forenoon of that day it was seen by Doctor Common in\r\nEngland, and by Doctor Elkin and Mr Finlay at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nalmost touching the sun. It looked like a dazzling white bird with\r\noutspread wings. The southern observers watched it go _right into the\r\nsun,_ when it instantly disappeared. What had happened was that the\r\ncomet in passing its perihelion point had swung exactly between the\r\nearth and the sun. On the following morning it was seen from all parts\r\nof the world close by the sun on the opposite side, and it remained\r\nthus visible for three days, gradually receding from the solar disk. It\r\nthen became visible for northern observers in the morning sky before\r\nsunrise, brandishing a portentous sword-shaped tail which, if it had\r\nbeen in the evening sky, would have excited the wonder of hundreds of\r\nmillions, but situated where it was, comparatively few ever saw it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daniels’ comet. August 11, 1907]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe application of photography to the study of comets has revealed many\r\ncurious details which might otherwise have escaped detection, or at\r\nbest have remained subject to doubt. It has in particular shown not\r\nonly the precise form of the tails, but the remarkable vicissitudes\r\nthat they undergo. Professor Barnard’s photographs of Brooks’ comet in\r\n1893 suggested, by the extraordinary changes in the form of the tail\r\nwhich they revealed, that the comet was encountering a series of\r\nobstructions in space which bent and twisted its tail into fantastic\r\nshapes. The reader will observe the strange form into which the tail\r\nwas thrown on the night of October 21st. A cloud of meteors through\r\nwhich the comet was passing might have produced such deformations of\r\nits tail. In the photograph of Daniels’ comet of 1907, a curious\r\nstriping of the tail will be noticed. The short bright streaks seen in\r\nthe photograph, it may be explained, are the images of stars which are\r\ndrawn out into lines in consequence of the fact that the photographic\r\ntelescope was adjusted to follow the motion of the comet while the\r\nstars remained at rest.\r\n\r\nBut the adventures of comets are not confined to possible encounters\r\nwith unknown obstacles. We have referred to the fact that the great\r\nplanets, and especially Jupiter, frequently interfere with the motions\r\nof comets. This interference is not limited to the original alteration\r\nof their orbits from possible parabolas to ellipses, but is sometimes\r\nexercised again and again, turning the bewildered comets into\r\nelliptical paths of all degrees of eccentricity. A famous example of\r\nthis kind of planetary horse-play is furnished by the story of Lexell’s\r\nmissing comet. This comet was first seen in 1770. Investigation showed\r\nthat it was moving in an orbit which should bring it back to perihelion\r\nevery five and a half years; yet it had never been seen before and,\r\nalthough often searched for, has never been seen since. Laplace and\r\nLeverrier proved mathematically that in 1767 it had approached so close\r\nto Jupiter as to be involved among the orbits of his satellites. What\r\nits track had been before is not known, but on that occasion the giant\r\nplanet seized the interloper, threw it into a short elliptic orbit and\r\nsent it, like an arrested vagrant, to receive sentence at the bar of\r\nthe sun. On this journey it passed within less than 1,500,000 miles of\r\nthe earth. The form of orbit which Jupiter had impressed required, as\r\nwe have said, its return in about five and a half years; but soon after\r\n1770 it had the misfortune a second time to encounter Jupiter at close\r\nrange, and he, as if dissatisfied with the leniency of the sun, or\r\nindignant at the stranger’s familiarity, seized the comet and hurled it\r\nout of the system, or at any rate so far away that it has never since\r\nbeen able to rejoin the family circle that basks in the immediate rays\r\nof the solar hearth. Nor is this the only instance in which Jupiter has\r\ndealt summarily with small comets that have approached him with too\r\nlittle deference.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brooks’ comet. Photographed by Barnard, October 21,\r\n1893]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe function which Jupiter so conspicuously fulfills as master of the\r\nhounds to the sun is worth considering a little more in detail. To\r\nchange the figure, imagine the sun in its voyage through space to be\r\nlike a majestic battleship surrounded by its scouts. Small vessels (the\r\ncomets, as they are overhauled by the squadron, are taken in charge by\r\nthe scouts, with Jupiter for their chief, and are forced to accompany\r\nthe fleet, but not all are impressed. If a strange comet undertakes to\r\nrun across Jupiter’s bows the latter brings it to, and makes prize of\r\nit by throwing it into a relatively small ellipse with the sun for its\r\nfocus. Thenceforth, unless, as happened to the unhappy comet of Lexell,\r\nit encounters Jupiter again in such a way as to be diverted by him into\r\na more distant orbit, it can never get away. About thirty comets are\r\nnow known to have thus been captured by the great planet, and they are\r\ncalled “Jupiter’s Comet Family.” But, on the other hand, if a wandering\r\ncomet crosses the wake of the chief planetary scout the latter simply\r\ndrives it away by accelerating its motion and compels it to steer off\r\ninto open space. The transformation of comets into meteors will be\r\nconsidered in the next chapter, but here, in passing, mention may be\r\nmade of the strange fate of one member of Jupiter’s family, Biela’s\r\ncomet, which, having become over bold in its advances to its captor,\r\nwas, after a few revolutions in is impressed orbit, torn to pieces and\r\nturned into a flock of meteors.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us return to the mystery of comets’ tails. That we are\r\nfully justified in speaking of the tails of comets as mysterious is\r\nproved by the declaration of Sir John Herschel, who averred, in so many\r\nwords, that “there is some profound secret and mystery of nature\r\nconcerned in this phenomenon,” and this profound secret and mystery has\r\nnot yet been altogether cleared up. Nevertheless, the all-explaining\r\nhypothesis of Arrhenius offers us once more a certain amount of aid.\r\nComets’ tails, Arrhenius assures us, are but another result of the\r\npressure of light. The reader will recall the applications of this\r\ntheory to the Zodiacal Light and the Aurora. In the form in which we\r\nnow have to deal with it, the supposition is made that as a comet\r\napproaches the sun eruptions of vapor, due to the solar heat, occur in\r\nits nucleus. These are naturally most active on the side which is\r\ndirectly exposed to the sun, whence the appearance of the immense\r\nglowing envelopes that surround the nucleus on the sunward side. Among\r\nthe particles of hydro-carbon, and perhaps solid carbon in the state of\r\nfine dust, which are thus set free there will be many whose size is\r\nwithin the critical limit which enables the light-waves from the sun to\r\ndrive them away. Clouds of such particles, then, will stream off behind\r\nthe advancing comet, producing the appearance of a tail. This accounts\r\nfor the fact that the tails of comets are always directed away from the\r\nsun, and it also explains the varying forms of the tails and the\r\nextraordinary changes that they undergo. The speed of the particles\r\ndriven before the light-waves must depend upon their size and weight,\r\nthe lightest of a given size traveling the most swiftly. By accretion\r\ncertain particles might grow, thus losing velocity and producing the\r\nappearance of bunches in the tail, such as have been observed. The\r\nhypothesis also falls in with the researches of Bredichin, who has\r\ndivided the tails of comets into three principal classes—_viz.:_ (1)\r\nThose which appear as long, straight rays; (2) Those which have the\r\nform of curved plumes or scimitars; (3) Those which are short, brushy,\r\nand curved sharply backward along the comet’s path. In the first type\r\nhe calculates the repulsive force at from twelve to fifteen times the\r\nforce of gravity; in the second at from two to four times; and in the\r\nthird at about one and a half times. The straight tails he ascribes to\r\nhydrogen because the hydrogen atom is the lightest known; the\r\nsword-shaped tails to hydro-carbons; and the stumpy tails to vaporized\r\niron. It will be seen that, if the force driving off the tails is that\r\nwhich Arrhenius assumes it to be, the forms of those appendages would\r\naccord with those that Bredichin’s theory calls for. At the same time\r\nwe have an explanation of the multiple tails with which some comets\r\nhave adorned themselves. The comet of 1744, for instance, had at one\r\ntime no less than seven tails spread in a wide curved brush behind it.\r\nDonati’s comet of 1858 also had at least two tails, the principal one\r\nsword-shaped and the other long, narrow, and as straight as a rule.\r\nAccording to Bredichin, the straight tail must have been composed of\r\nhydrogen, and the other of some form of hydro-carbon whose atoms are\r\nheavier than those of hydrogen, and, consequently, when swept away by\r\nthe storm of light-waves, followed a curvature depending upon the\r\nresultant of the forces operating upon them. The seven tails of the\r\ncomet of 1744 presented a kind of diagram graphically exhibiting its\r\ncomplex composition, and, if we knew a little more about the\r\nconstituents of a comet, we might be able to say from the amount of\r\ncurvature of the different tails just what were the seven substances of\r\nwhich that comet consisted.\r\n\r\nIf these theories seem to the reader fantastic, at any rate they are no\r\nmore fantastic than the phenomena that they seek to explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\nMeteors, Fire-Balls, and Meteorites\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most terrorizing spectacles with which the heavens have ever\r\ncaused the hearts of men to quake occurred on the night of November 13,\r\n1833. On that night North America, which faced the storm, was under a\r\ncontinual rain of fire from about ten o’clock in the evening until\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\n_The fragments of a comet had struck the earth._\r\n\r\nBut the meaning of what had happened was not discovered until long\r\nafterward. To the astronomers who, with astonishment not less than that\r\nof other people, watched the wonderful scene, it was an unparalleled\r\n“shower of meteors.” They did not then suspect that those meteors had\r\nonce formed the head of a comet. Light dawned when, a year later, Prof.\r\nDenison Olmsted, of Yale College, demonstrated that the meteors had all\r\nmoved in parallel orbits around the sun, and that these orbits\r\nintersected that of the earth at the point where our planet happened to\r\nbe on the memorable night of November 13th. Professor Olmsted even went\r\nso far as to suggest that the cloud of meteors that had encountered the\r\nearth might form a diffuse comet; but full recognition of the fact that\r\nthey were cometary débris came later, as the result of further\r\ninvestigation. The key to the secret was plainly displayed in the\r\nspectacle itself, and was noticed without being understood by thousands\r\nof the terror-stricken beholders. It was _an umbrella of fire_ that had\r\nopened overhead and covered the heavens; in other words, the meteors\r\nall radiated from a particular point in the constellation Leo, and,\r\nbeing countless as the snowflakes in a winter tempest, they ribbed the\r\nsky with fiery streaks. Professor Olmsted showed that the radiation of\r\nthe meteors from a fixed point was an effect of perspective, and in\r\nitself a proof that they were moving in parallel paths when they\r\nencountered the earth. The fact was noted that there had been a\r\nsimilar, but incomparably less brilliant, display of meteors on the\r\nsame day of November, 1832, and it was rightly concluded that these had\r\nbelonged to the same stream, although the true relationship of the\r\nphenomena was not immediately apprehended. Olmsted ascribed to the\r\nmeteors a revolution about the sun once in every six months, bringing\r\nthem to the intersection of their orbit with that of the earth every\r\nNovember 13th; but later investigators found that the real period was\r\nabout thirty-three and one-quarter years, so that the great displays\r\nwere due three times in a century, and their return was confidently\r\npredicted for the year 1866. The appearance of the meteors in 1832, a\r\nyear before the great display, was ascribed to the great length of the\r\nstream which they formed in space—so great that they required more than\r\ntwo years to cross the earth’s orbit. In 1832 the earth had encountered\r\na relatively rare part of the stream, but in 1833, on returning to the\r\ncrossing-place, it found there the richest part of the stream pouring\r\nacross its orbit. This explanation also proved to be correct, and the\r\npredicted return in 1866 was duly witnessed, although the display was\r\nmuch less brilliant than in 1833. It was followed by another in 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Curious forms of meteorite trains\r\nNos. 1 to 6 show the changes undergone by a train left by a meteorite\r\nwhich passed near the “Great Dipper”; 7 shows the changes and drift of\r\na train seen in the constellation Virgo; 8 is the singular train of the\r\nmeteorite of February 22, 1909, near the Pole Star. (From _La\r\nNature_.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Olmsted’s idea of a cometary relationship of the\r\nmeteors was demonstrated to be correct by the researches of\r\nSchiaparelli and others, who showed that not only the November meteors,\r\nbut those of August, which are seen more or less abundantly every year,\r\ntraveled in the tracks of well-known comets, and had undoubtedly an\r\nidentical origin with those comets. In other words the comets and the\r\nmeteor-swarms were both remnants of original masses which had probably\r\nbeen split up by the action of the sun, or of some planet to which they\r\nhad made close approaches. The annual periodicity of the August meteors\r\nwas ascribed to the fact that the separation had taken place so long\r\nago that the meteors had become distributed all around the orbit, in\r\nconsequence of which the earth encountered some of them every year when\r\nit arrived at the crossing-point. Then Leverrier showed that the\r\noriginal comet associated with the November meteors was probably\r\nbrought into the system by the influence of the planet Uranus in the\r\nyear 126 of the Christian era. Afterward Alexander Herschel identified\r\nthe tracks of no less than seventy-six meteor-swarms (most of them\r\ninconspicuous) with those of comets. The still more recent researches\r\nof Mr W. F. Denning make it probable that there are no meteors which do\r\nnot belong to a flock or system probably formed by the disintegration\r\nof a cometary mass; even the apparently sporadic ones which shoot\r\nacross the sky, “lost souls in the night,” being members of flocks\r\nwhich have become so widely scattered that the earth sometimes takes\r\nweeks to pass through the region of space where their paths lie.\r\n\r\nThe November meteors should have exhibited another pair of spectacles\r\nin 1899 and 1900, and their failure to do so caused at first much\r\ndisappointment, until it was made plain that a good reason existed for\r\ntheir absence. It was found that after their last appearance, in 1867,\r\nthey had been disturbed in their movements by the planets Jupiter and\r\nSaturn, whose attractions had so shifted the position of their orbit\r\nthat it no longer intersected that of the earth, as it did before.\r\nWhether another planetary interference will sometime bring the\r\nprincipal mass of the November meteors back to the former point of\r\nintersection with the earth’s orbit is a question for the future to\r\ndecide. It would seem that there may be several parallel streams of the\r\nNovember meteors, and that some of them, like those of August, are\r\ndistributed entirely around the orbit, so that every mid-November we\r\nsee a few of them.\r\n\r\nWe come now to a very remarkable example of the disintegration of a\r\ncomet and the formation of a meteor-stream. In 1826 Biela, of\r\nJosephstadt, Austria, discovered a comet to which his name was given.\r\nCalculation showed that it had an orbital period of about six and a\r\nhalf years, belonging to Jupiter’s “family.” On one of its returns, in\r\n1846, it astonished its watchers by suddenly splitting in two. The two\r\ncomets thus formed out of one separated to a distance of about one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand miles, and then raced side by side,\r\nsometimes with a curious ligature connecting them, like Siamese twins,\r\nuntil they disappeared together in interplanetary space. In 1852 they\r\ncame back, still nearly side by side, but now the distance between them\r\nhad increased to a million and a quarter of miles. After that, at every\r\nrecurrence of their period, astronomers looked for them in vain, until\r\n1872, when an amazing thing happened. On the night of November 28th,\r\nwhen the earth was crossing the plane of the orbit of the missing\r\ncomet, a brilliant shower of meteors burst from the northern sky,\r\ntraveling nearly in the track which the comet should have pursued. The\r\nastronomers were electrified. Klinkerfues, of Göttingen, telegraphed to\r\nPogson, of Madras: _“Biela touched earth; search near Theta Centauri.”_\r\nPogson searched in the place indicated and saw a cometary mass\r\nretreating into the southern heavens, where it was soon swallowed from\r\nsight!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the atmosphere up to 100 kilometers.\r\nShowing the mean elevation at which meteorites and meteors make their\r\nappearance. Below are shown the elevation of Mount Everest, the highest\r\nmanned balloon ascent by M. Berson; the height of cirrus clouds; the\r\nhighest free balloon ascent; and the elevation attained by the clouds\r\nof fire-dust ejected by the Krakatoa eruption in 1883. (From _La\r\nNature_)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince then the Biela meteors have been among the recognized periodic\r\nspectacles of the sky, and few if any doubt that they represent a\r\nportion of the missing comet whose disintegration began with the\r\nseparation into two parts in 1846. The comet itself has never since\r\nbeen seen. The first display of these meteors, sometimes called the\r\n“Andromedes,” because they radiate from the constellation Andromeda,\r\nwas remarkable for the great brilliancy of many of the fire-balls that\r\nshot among the shower of smaller sparks, some of which were described\r\nas equaling the full moon in size. None of them is known to have\r\nreached the earth, but during the display of the same meteors in 1885 a\r\nmeteoric mass fell at Mazapil in Northern Mexico (it is now in the\r\nMuseum at Vienna), which many have thought may actually be a piece of\r\nthe original comet of Biela. This brings us to the second branch of our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nMore rare than meteors or falling stars, and more startling, except\r\nthat they never appear in showers, are the huge balls of fire which\r\noccasionally dart through the sky, lighting up the landscapes beneath\r\nwith their glare, leaving trains of sparks behind them, often producing\r\npeals of thunder when they explode, and in many cases falling upon the\r\nearth and burying themselves from a few inches to several feet in the\r\nsoil, from which, more than once, they have been picked up while yet\r\nhot and fuming. These balls are sometimes called bolides. They are not\r\nreally round in shape, although they often look so while traversing the\r\nsky, but their forms are fragmentary, and occasionally fantastic. It\r\nhas been supposed that their origin is different from that of the true\r\nmeteors; it has even been conjectured that they may have originated\r\nfrom the giant volcanoes of the moon or have been shot out from the sun\r\nduring some of the tremendous explosions that accompany the formation\r\nof eruptive prominences. By the same reasoning some of them might be\r\nsupposed to have come from some distant star. Others have conjectured\r\nthat they are wanderers in space, of unknown origin, which the earth\r\nencounters as it journeys on, and Lord Kelvin made a suggestion which\r\nhas become classic because of its imaginative reach—_viz.,_ that the\r\nfirst germs of life may have been brought to the earth by one of these\r\nbodies, “a fragment of an exploded world.”\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that astronomers and scientific men in general\r\nwere among the last to admit the possibility of solid masses falling\r\nfrom the sky. The people had believed in the reality of such phenomena\r\nfrom the earliest times, but the savants shook their heads and talked\r\nof superstition. This was the less surprising because no scientifically\r\nauthenticated instance of such an occurrence was known, and the stones\r\npopularly believed to have fallen from the sky had become the objects\r\nof worship or superstitious reverence, a fact not calculated to\r\nrecommend them to scientific credence. The celebrated “black stone”\r\nsuspended in the Kaaba at Mecca is one of these reputed gifts from\r\nheaven; the “Palladium” of ancient Troy was another; and a stone which\r\nfell near Ensisheim, in Germany, was placed in a church as an object to\r\nbe religiously venerated. Many legends of falling stones existed in\r\nantiquity, some of them curiously transfigured by the imagination, like\r\nthe “Lion of the Peloponnesus,” which was said to have sprung down from\r\nthe sky upon the Isthmus of Corinth. But near the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, in 1803, a veritable shower of falling stones\r\noccurred at L’Aigle, in Northern France, and this time astronomers took\r\nnote of the phenomenon and scientifically investigated it. Thousands of\r\nthe strange projectiles came from the sky on this occasion, and were\r\nscattered over a wide area of country, and some buildings were hit.\r\nFour years later another shower of stones occurred at Weston, Conn.,\r\nnumbering thousands of individuals. The local alarm created in both\r\ncases was great, as well it might be, for what could be more\r\nintimidating than to find the blue vault of heaven suddenly hurling\r\nsolid missiles at the homes of men? After these occurrences it was\r\nimpossible for the most skeptical to doubt any longer, and the regular\r\nstudy of “aerolites,” or “meteorites,” began.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things recognized was the fact that fire-balls are\r\nsolid meteorites in flight, and not gaseous exhalations in the air, as\r\nsome had assumed. They burn in the air during their flight, and\r\nsometimes, perhaps, are entirely consumed before reaching the ground.\r\nTheir velocity before entering the earth’s atmosphere is equal to that\r\nof the planets in their orbits—_viz.,_ from twenty to thirty miles per\r\nsecond—a fact which proves that the sun is the seat of the central\r\nforce governing them. Their burning in the air is not difficult to\r\nexplain; it is the heat of friction which so quickly brings them to\r\nincandescence. Calculation shows that a body moving through the air at\r\na velocity of about a mile per second will be brought, superficially,\r\nto the temperature of “red heat” by friction with the atmosphere. If\r\nits velocity is twenty miles per second the temperature will become\r\nthousands of degrees. This is the state of affairs with a meteorite\r\nrushing into the earth’s atmosphere; its surface is liquefied within a\r\nfew seconds after the friction begins to act, and the melted and\r\nvaporized portion of its mass is swept backward, forming the train of\r\nsparks that follows every great fire-ball. However, there is one\r\nphenomenon connected with the trains of meteorites which has never been\r\nsatisfactorily explained: they often persist for long periods of time,\r\ndrifting and turning with the wind, but not ceasing to glow with a\r\nphosphorescent luminosity. The question is, Whence comes this light? It\r\nmust be light without heat, since the fine dust or vapor of which the\r\ntrain can only consist would not retain sufficient heat to render it\r\nluminous for so long a time. An extremely remarkable incident of this\r\nkind occurred on February 22, 1909, when an immense fire-ball that\r\npassed over southern England left a train that remained visible during\r\ntwo hours, assuming many curious shapes as it was drifted about by\r\ncurrents in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A meteor photographed in flight]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the enormous velocity with which meteorites enter\r\nthe air they are soon slowed down to comparatively moderate speed, so\r\nthat when they disappear they are usually traveling not faster than a\r\nmile a second. The courses of many have been traced by observers\r\nsituated along their track at various points, and thus a knowledge has\r\nbeen obtained of their height above the ground during their flight and\r\nof the length of their visible courses. They generally appear at an\r\nelevation of eighty or a hundred miles, and are seldom visible after\r\nhaving descended to within five miles of the ground, unless the\r\nobserver happens to be near the striking-point, when he may actually\r\nwitness the fall. Frequently they burst while high in the air and their\r\nfragments are scattered like shrapnel over the surface of the ground,\r\nsometimes covering an area of several square miles, but of course not\r\nthickly; different fragments of the same meteorite may reach the ground\r\nat points several miles apart. The observed length of their courses in\r\nthe atmosphere varies from fifty to five hundred miles. If they\r\ncontinued a long time in flight after entering the air, even the\r\nlargest of them would probably be consumed to the last scrap, but their\r\nfiery career is so short on account of their great speed that the heat\r\ndoes not have time to penetrate very deeply, and some that have been\r\npicked up immediately after their fall have been found cold as ice\r\nwithin. Their size after reaching the ground is variable within wide\r\nlimits; some are known which weigh several tons, but the great majority\r\nweigh only a few pounds and many only a few ounces.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are of two kinds: _stony_ meteorites and _iron_ meteorites.\r\nThe former outnumber the latter twenty to one; but many stone\r\nmeteorites contain grains of iron. Nickel is commonly found in iron\r\nmeteorites, so that it might be said that that redoubtable alloy\r\nnickel-steel is of cosmical invention. Some twenty-five chemical\r\nelements have been found in meteorites, including carbon and the\r\n“sun-metal,” helium. The presence of the latter is certainly highly\r\nsuggestive in connection with the question of the origin of meteorites.\r\nThe iron meteorites, besides metallic iron and nickel, of which they\r\nare almost entirely composed, contain hydrogen, helium, and carbonic\r\noxide, and about the only imaginable way in which these gases could\r\nhave become absorbed in the iron would be through the immersion of the\r\nlatter while in a molten or vaporized state in a hot and dense\r\natmosphere composed of them, a condition which we know to exist only in\r\nthe envelopes of the sun and the stars.\r\n\r\nThe existence of carbon in the Canyon Diablo iron meteorites is\r\nattended by a circumstance of the most singular character—a very “fairy\r\ntale of science.” In some cases _the carbon has become diamond!_ These\r\nmeteoric diamonds are very small; nevertheless, they are true diamonds,\r\nresembling in many ways the little black gems produced by Moissan’s\r\nmethod with the aid of the electric furnace. The fact that they are\r\nfound embedded in these iron meteorites is another argument in favor of\r\nthe hypothesis of the solar or stellar origin of the latter. To\r\nappreciate this it is necessary to recall the way in which Moissan made\r\nhis diamonds. It was by a combination of the effects of great heat,\r\ngreat pressure, and sudden or rapid superficial cooling on a mass of\r\niron containing carbon. When he finally broke open his iron he found it\r\na pudding stuffed with miniature black diamonds. When a fragment of the\r\nCanyon Diablo meteoric iron was polished in Philadelphia over fifteen\r\nyears ago it cut the emery-wheel to pieces, and examination showed that\r\nthe damage had been effected by microscopic diamonds peppered through\r\nthe mass. How were those diamonds formed? If the sun or Sirius was the\r\nlaboratory that prepared them, we can get a glimpse at the process of\r\ntheir formation. There is plenty of heat, plenty of pressure, and an\r\nabundance of vaporized iron in the sun and the stars. When a great\r\nsolar eruption takes place, masses of iron which have absorbed carbon\r\nmay be shot out with a velocity which forbids their return. Plunged\r\ninto the frightful cold of space, their surfaces are quickly cooled, as\r\nMoissan cooled his prepared iron by throwing it into water, and thus\r\nthe requisite stress is set up within, and, as the iron solidifies, the\r\nincluded carbon crystallizes into diamonds. Whether this explanation\r\nhas a germ of truth in it or not, at any rate it is evident that iron\r\nmeteorites were not created in the form in which they come to us; they\r\nmust once have been parts of immeasurably more massive bodies than\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe fall of meteorites offers an appreciable, though numerically\r\ninsignificant, peril to the inhabitants of the earth. Historical\r\nrecords show perhaps three or four instances of people being killed by\r\nthese bodies. But for the protection afforded by the atmosphere, which\r\nacts as a very effective shield, the danger would doubtless be very\r\nmuch greater. In the absence of an atmosphere not only would more\r\nmeteorites reach the ground, but their striking force would be\r\nincomparably greater, since, as we have seen, the larger part of their\r\noriginal velocity is destroyed by the resistance of the air. A\r\nmeteorite weighing many tons and striking the earth with a velocity of\r\ntwenty or thirty miles per second, would probably cause frightful\r\nhavoc.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking across Coon Butte crater from northern rim]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that recent investigations seem to have proved\r\nthat an event of this kind actually happened in North America—perhaps\r\nnot longer than a thousand or two thousand years ago. The scene of the\r\nsupposed catastrophe is in northern central Arizona, at Coon Butte,\r\nwhere there is a nearly circular crater in the middle of a circular\r\nelevation or small mountain. The crater is somewhat over four thousand\r\nfeet in diameter, and the surrounding rim, formed of upturned strata\r\nand ejected rock fragments, rises at its highest point one hundred and\r\nsixty feet above the plain. The crater is about six hundred feet in\r\ndepth—that is, from the rim to the visible floor or bottom of the\r\ncrater. There is no evidence that volcanic action has ever taken place\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of Coon Butte. The rock in which the\r\ncrater has been made is composed of horizontal sandstone and limestone\r\nstrata. Between three hundred and four hundred million tons of rock\r\nfragments have been detached, and a large portion hurled by some cause\r\nout of the crater. These fragments lie concentrically distributed\r\naround the crater, and in large measure form the elevation known as\r\nCoon Butte. The region has been famous for nearly twenty years on\r\naccount of the masses of meteoric iron found scattered about and known\r\nas the “Canyon Diablo” meteorites. It was one of these masses, which\r\nconsist of nickel-iron containing a small quantity of platinum, and of\r\nwhich in all some ten tons have been recovered for sale to the various\r\ncollectors throughout the world, that as before mentioned destroyed the\r\ngrinding-tool at Philadelphia through the cutting power of its embedded\r\ndiamonds. These meteoric irons are scattered about the crater-hill, in\r\nconcentric distribution, to a maximum distance of about five miles.\r\nWhen the suggestion was first made in 1896 that a monster meteorite\r\nmight have created by its fall this singular lone crater _in stratified\r\nrocks,_ it was greeted with incredulous smiles; but since then the\r\nmatter has assumed a different aspect. The Standard Iron Company,\r\nformed by Messrs. D. M. Barringer, B. C. Tilghman, E. J. Bennitt, and\r\nS. J. Holsinger, having become, in 1903, the owner of this freak of\r\nnature, sunk shafts and bored holes to a great depth in the interior of\r\nthe crater, and also trenched the slopes of the mountain, and the\r\nresult of their investigations has proved that the meteoric hypothesis\r\nof origin is correct. (See the papers published in the _Proceedings of\r\nthe Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia,_ December, 1905,\r\nwherein it is proved that the United States Geological Survey was wrong\r\nin believing this crater to have been due to a steam explosion. Since\r\nthat date there has been discovered a great amount of additional\r\nconfirmatory proof). Material of unmistakably meteoric origin was found\r\nby means of the drills, mixed with crushed rock, to a depth of six\r\nhundred to seven hundred feet below the floor of the crater, and a\r\ngreat deal of it has been found admixed with the ejected rock fragments\r\non the outer slopes of the mountain, absolutely proving synchronism\r\nbetween the two events, the formation of this great crater and the\r\nfalling of the meteoric iron out of the sky. The drill located in the\r\nbottom of the crater was sent, in a number of cases, much deeper (over\r\none thousand feet) into unaltered horizontal red sandstone strata, but\r\nno meteoric material was found below this depth (seven hundred feet, or\r\nbetween eleven and twelve hundred feet below the level of the\r\nsurrounding plain), which has been assumed as being about the limit of\r\npenetration. It is not possible to sink a shaft at present, owing to\r\nthe water which has drained into the crater, and which forms, with the\r\nfinely pulverized sandstone, a very troublesome quicksand encountered\r\nat about two hundred feet below the visible floor of the crater. As\r\nsoon as this water is removed by pumping it will be easy to explore the\r\ndepths of the crater by means of shafts and drifts. The rock strata\r\n(sandstone and limestone) of which the walls consist present every\r\nappearance of having been violently upturned by a huge body penetrating\r\nthe earth like a cannon-ball. The general aspect of the crater\r\nstrikingly resembles the impression made by a steel projectile shot\r\ninto an armor-plate. Mr Tilghman has estimated that a meteorite about\r\nfive hundred feet in diameter and moving with a velocity of about five\r\nmiles per second would have made just such a perforation upon striking\r\nrocks of the character of those found at this place. There was some\r\nfusion of the colliding masses, and the heat produced some steam from\r\nthe small amount of water in the rocks. As a result there has been\r\nfound at depth a considerable amount of fused quartz (original\r\nsandstone), and with it innumerable particles or sparks of fused\r\nnickel-iron (original meteorite). A projectile of that size penetrating\r\neleven to twelve hundred feet into the rocky shell of the globe must\r\nhave produced a shock which was perceptible several hundred miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trail on south side, Coon Butte crater]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great velocity ascribed to the supposed meteorite at the moment of\r\nstriking could be accounted for by the fact that it probably plunged\r\nnearly vertically downward, for it formed a circular crater in the\r\nrocky crust of the earth. In that case it would have been less retarded\r\nby the resistance of the atmosphere than are meteorites which enter the\r\nair at a lower angle and shoot ahead hundreds of miles until friction\r\nhas nearly destroyed their original motion when they drop upon the\r\nearth. Some meteoric masses of great size, such as Peary’s iron\r\nmeteorite found at Cape York, Greenland, and the almost equally large\r\nmass discovered at Bacubirito, Mexico, appear to have penetrated but\r\nslightly on striking the earth. This may be explained by supposing that\r\nthey pursued a long, horizontal course through the air before falling.\r\nThe result would be that, their original velocity having been\r\npractically destroyed, they would drop to the ground with a velocity\r\nnearly corresponding to that which gravity would impart within the\r\nperpendicular distance of their final fall. A\r\nsix-hundred-and-sixty-pound meteorite, which fell at Knyahinya,\r\nHungary, striking at an angle of 27° from the vertical, penetrated the\r\nground to a depth of eleven feet.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the Coon Butte meteorite may have fallen not\r\nlonger ago than a few thousand years. This is based upon the fact that\r\nthe geological indications favor the supposition that the event did not\r\noccur more than five thousand years ago, while on the other hand the\r\nrings of growth in the cedar-trees growing on the slopes of the crater\r\nshow that they have existed there about seven hundred years. Prof.\r\nWilliam H. Pickering has recently correlated this with an ancient\r\nchronicle which states that at Cairo, Egypt, in the year 1029, “many\r\nstars passed with a great noise.” He remarks that Cairo is about 100°,\r\nby great circle, from Coon Butte, so that if the meteorite that made\r\nthe crater was a member of a flock of similar bodies which encountered\r\nthe earth moving in parallel lines, some of them might have traversed\r\nthe sky tangent to the earth’s surface at Cairo. That the spectacle\r\nspoken of in the chronicle was caused by meteorites he deems\r\nexceedingly probable because of what is said about “a great noise;”\r\nmeteorites are the only celestial phenomena attended with perceptible\r\nsounds. Professor Pickering conjectures that this supposed flock of\r\ngreat meteorites may have formed the nucleus of a comet which struck\r\nthe earth, and he finds confirmation of the idea in the fact that out\r\nof the ten largest meteorites known, no less than seven were found\r\nwithin nine hundred miles of Coon Butte. It would be interesting if we\r\ncould trace back the history of that comet, and find out what malicious\r\nplanet caught it up in its innocent wanderings and hurled it with so\r\ntrue an aim at the earth! This remarkable crater is one of the most\r\ninteresting places in the world, for there is absolutely no record of\r\nsuch a mass, possibly an iron-headed comet, from outer space having\r\ncome into collision with our earth. The results of the future\r\nexploration of the depths of the crater will be awaited with much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\nThe Wrecking of the Moon\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are sympathetic moods under whose influence one gazes with a\r\ncertain poignant tenderness at the worn face of the moon; that little\r\n“fossil world” (the child of our mother earth, too) bears such terrible\r\nscars of its brief convulsive life that a sense of pity is awakened by\r\nthe sight. The moon is the wonder-land of the telescope. Those towering\r\nmountains, whose “proud aspiring peaks” cast silhouettes of shadow that\r\nseem drawn with india-ink; those vast plains, enchained with gentle\r\nwinding hills and bordered with giant ranges; those oval “oceans,”\r\nwhere one looks expectant for the flash of wind-whipped waves; those\r\nenchanting “bays” and recesses at the seaward feet of the Alps; those\r\nbroad straits passing between guardian heights incomparably mightier\r\nthan Gibraltar; those locket-like valleys as secluded among their\r\nmountains as the Vale of Cashmere; those colossal craters that make us\r\nsmile at the pretensions of Vesuvius, Etna, and Cotopaxi; those strange\r\nwhite ways which pass with the unconcern of Roman roads across\r\nmountain, gorge, and valley—all these give the beholder an irresistible\r\nimpression that it is truly a world into which he is looking, a world\r\nakin to ours, and yet no more like our world than Pompeii is like\r\nNaples. Its air, its waters, its clouds, its life are gone, and only a\r\nskeleton remains—a mute but eloquent witness to a cosmical tragedy\r\nwithout parallel in the range of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but regret that the moon, if it ever was the seat of\r\nintelligent life, has not remained so until our time. Think what the\r\nconsequences would have been if this other world at our very door had\r\nbeen found to be both habitable and inhabited! We talk rather airily of\r\ncommunicating with Mars by signals; but Mars never approaches nearer\r\nthan 35,000,000 miles, while the moon when nearest is only a little\r\nmore than 220,000 miles away. Given an effective magnifying power of\r\nfive thousand diameters, which will perhaps be possible at the mountain\r\nobservatories as telescopes improve, and we should be able to bring the\r\nmoon within an apparent distance of about forty miles, while the\r\ncorresponding distance for Mars would be more than seven thousand\r\nmiles. But even with existing telescopic powers we can see details on\r\nthe moon no larger than some artificial constructions on the earth. St\r\nPeter’s at Rome, with the Vatican palace and the great piazza, if\r\nexisting on the moon, would unquestionably be recognizable as something\r\nelse than a freak of nature. Large cities, with their radiating lines\r\nof communication, would at once betray their real character. Cultivated\r\ntracts, and the changes produced by the interference of intelligent\r\nbeings, would be clearly recognizable. The electric illumination of a\r\nlarge town at night would probably be markedly visible. Gleams of\r\nreflected sunlight would come to us from the surfaces of the lakes and\r\noceans, and a huge “liner” traversing a lunar sea could probably be\r\nfollowed by its trail of smoke. As to communications by “wireless”\r\nsignals, which certain enthusiasts have thought of in connection with\r\nMars, in the case of the moon they should be a relatively simple\r\nmatter, and the feat might actually be accomplished. Think what a\r\nliterature would grow up about the moon if it were a living world! Its\r\nvery differences from the earth would only accentuate its interest for\r\nus. Night and day on the moon are each two weeks in length; how\r\ninteresting it would be to watch the manner in which the lunarians\r\ndealt with such a situation as that. Lunar and terrestrial history\r\nwould keep step with each other, and we should record them both. Truly\r\none might well wish to have a neighbor world to study; one would feel\r\nso much the less alone in space.\r\n\r\nIt is not impossible that the moon did at one time have inhabitants of\r\nsome kind. But, if so, they vanished with the disappearance of its\r\natmosphere and seas, or with the advent of its cataclysmic age. At the\r\nbest, its career as a living world must have been brief. If the water\r\nand air were gradually absorbed, as some have conjectured, by its\r\ncooling interior rocks, its surface might, nevertheless, have retained\r\nthem for long ages; but if, as others think, their disappearance was\r\ndue to the escape of their gaseous molecules in consequence of the\r\ninability of the relatively small lunar gravitation to retain them,\r\nthen the final catastrophe must have been as swift as it was\r\ninevitable. Accepting Darwin’s hypothesis, that the moon was separated\r\nfrom the earth by tidal action while both were yet plastic or nebulous,\r\nwe may reasonably conclude that it began its career with a good supply\r\nof both water and air, but did not possess sufficient mass to hold them\r\npermanently. Yet it may have retained them long enough for life to\r\ndevelop in many forms upon its surface; in fact, there are so many\r\nindications that air and water have not always been lacking to the\r\nlunar world that we are driven to invent theories to explain both their\r\nformer presence and their present absence.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The craters Clavius, Longomontanus, Tycho, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whatever the former condition of the moon may have been, its\r\nexisting appearance gives it a resistless fascination, and it bears so\r\nclearly the story of a vast catastrophe sculptured on its rocky face\r\nthat the thoughtful observer cannot look upon it without a feeling of\r\nawe. The gigantic character of the lunar features impresses the\r\nbeholder not less than the universality of the play of destructive\r\nforces which they attest. Let us make a few comparisons. Take the lunar\r\ncrater called “Tycho”, which is a typical example of its kind. In the\r\ntelescope Tycho appears as a perfect ring surrounding a circular\r\ndepression, in the center of which rises a group of mountains. Its\r\nsuperficial resemblance to some terrestrial volcanic craters is very\r\nstriking. Vesuvius, seen from a point vertically above, would no doubt\r\nlook something like that (the resemblance would have been greater when\r\nthe Monte del Cavallo formed a more complete circuit about the crater\r\ncone). But compare the dimensions. The remains of the outer crater ring\r\nof Vesuvius are perhaps half a mile in diameter, while the active\r\ncrater itself is only two or three hundred feet across at the most;\r\nTycho has a diameter of fifty-four miles! The group of relatively\r\ninsignificant peaks in the center of the crater floor of Tycho is far\r\nmore massive than the entire mountain that we call Vesuvius. The\r\nlargest known volcanic crater on the earth, Aso San, in Japan, has a\r\ndiameter of seven miles; it would take _sixty_ craters like Aso San to\r\nequal Tycho in area! And Tycho, though one of the most perfect, is by\r\nno means the largest crater on the moon. Another, called “Theophilus,”\r\nhas a diameter of sixty-four miles, and is eighteen thousand feet deep.\r\nThere are hundreds from ten to forty miles in diameter, and thousands\r\nfrom one to ten miles. They are so numerous in many places that they\r\nbreak into one another, like the cells of a crushed honeycomb.\r\n\r\nThe lunar craters differ from those of the earth more fundamentally\r\nthan in the matter of mere size; _they are not situated on the tops of\r\nmountains._ If they were, and if all the proportions were the same, a\r\ncrater like Tycho might crown a conical peak fifty or one hundred miles\r\nhigh! Instead of being cavities in the summits of mountains, the lunar\r\ncraters are rather gigantic sink-holes whose bottoms in many cases lie\r\ntwo or three miles below the general surface of the lunar world. Around\r\ntheir rims the rocks are piled up to a height of from a few hundred to\r\ntwo or three thousand feet, with a comparatively gentle inclination,\r\nbut on the inner side they fall away in gigantic broken precipices\r\nwhich make the dizzy cliffs of the Matterhorn seem but “lover’s leaps.”\r\nDown they drop, ridge below ridge, crag under crag, tottering wall\r\nbeneath wall, until, in a crater named “Newton,” near the south lunar\r\npole, they attain a depth where the rays of the sun never reach.\r\nNothing more frightful than the spectacle which many of these terrible\r\nchasms present can be pictured by the imagination. As the lazy lunar\r\nday slowly advances, the sunshine, unmitigated by clouds or atmospheric\r\nveil of any kind, creeps across their rims and begins to descend the\r\nopposite walls. Presently it strikes the ragged crest of a ridge which\r\nhad lain hidden in such darkness as we never know on the earth, and\r\nruns along it like a line of kindling fire. Rocky pinnacles and needles\r\nshoot up into the sunlight out of the black depths. Down sinks the line\r\nof light, mile after mile, and continually new precipices and cliffs\r\nare brought into view, until at last the vast floor is attained and\r\nbegins to be illuminated. In the meanwhile the sun’s rays, darting\r\nacross the gulf, have touched the summits of the central peaks, twenty\r\nor thirty miles from the crater’s inmost edge, and they immediately\r\nkindle and blaze like huge stars amid the darkness. So profound are\r\nsome of these awful craters that days pass before the sun has risen\r\nhigh enough above them to chase the last shadows from their depths.\r\n\r\nAlthough several long ranges of mountains resembling those of the earth\r\nexist on the moon, the great majority of its elevations assume the\r\ncrateriform aspect. Sometimes, instead of a crater, we find an immense\r\nmountain ring whose form and aspect hardly suggest volcanic action. But\r\neverywhere the true craters are in evidence, even on the sea-beds,\r\nalthough they attain their greatest number and size on those parts of\r\nthe moon—covering sixty per cent of its visible surface—which are\r\ndistinctly mountainous in character and which constitute its most\r\nbrilliant portions. Broadly speaking, the southwestern half of the moon\r\nis the most mountainous and broken, and the northeastern half the least\r\nso. Right down through the center, from pole to pole, runs a wonderful\r\nline of craters and crateriform valleys of a magnitude stupendous even\r\nfor the moon. Another similar line follows the western edge. Three or\r\nfour “seas” are thrust between these mountainous belts. By the effects\r\nof “libration” parts of the opposite hemisphere of the moon which is\r\nturned away from the earth are from time to time brought into view, and\r\ntheir aspect indicates that that hemisphere resembles in its surface\r\nfeatures the one which faces the earth. There are many things about the\r\ncraters which seem to give some warrant for the hypothesis which has\r\nbeen particularly urged by Mr G. K. Gilbert, that they were formed by\r\nthe impact of meteors; but there are also many things which militate\r\nagainst that idea, and, upon the whole, the volcanic theory of their\r\norigin is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe enormous size of the lunar volcanoes is not so difficult to account\r\nfor when we remember how slight is the force of lunar gravity as\r\ncompared with that of the earth. With equal size and density, bodies on\r\nthe moon weigh only one-sixth as much as on the earth. Impelled by the\r\nsame force, a projectile that would go ten miles on the earth would go\r\nsixty miles on the moon. A lunar giant thirty-five feet tall would\r\nweigh no more than an ordinary son of Adam weighs on his greater\r\nplanet. To shoot a body from the earth so that it would not drop back\r\nagain, we should have to start it with a velocity of seven miles per\r\nsecond; a mile and a half per second would serve on the moon. It is by\r\nno means difficult to believe, then, that a lunar volcano might form a\r\ncrater ring eight or ten times broader than the greatest to be found on\r\nthe earth, especially when we reflect that in addition to the\r\nrelatively slight force of gravity, the materials of the lunar crust\r\nare probably lighter than those of our terrestrial rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Western part of the Mare Serenitatis]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons it seems not impossible that the theory mentioned\r\nin a former chapter—that some of the meteorites that have fallen upon\r\nthe earth originated from the lunar volcanoes—is well founded. This\r\nwould apply especially to the stony meteorites, for it is hardly to be\r\nsupposed that the moon, at least in its superficial parts, contains\r\nmuch iron. It is surely a scene most strange that is thus presented to\r\nthe mind’s eye—that little attendant of the earth’s (the moon has only\r\none-fiftieth of the volume, and only one-eightieth of the mass of the\r\nearth) firing great stones back at its parent planet! And what can have\r\nbeen the cause of this furious outbreak of volcanic forces on the moon?\r\nEvidently it was but a passing stage in its history; it had enjoyed\r\nmore quiet times before. As it cooled down from the plastic state in\r\nwhich it parted from the earth, it became incrusted after the normal\r\nmanner of a planet, and then oceans were formed, its atmosphere being\r\nsufficiently dense to prevent the water from evaporating and the\r\nwould-be oceans from disappearing continually in mist. This, if any,\r\nmust have been the period of life in the lunar world. As we look upon\r\nthe vestiges of that ancient world buried in the wreck that now covers\r\nso much of its surface, it is difficult to restrain the imagination\r\nfrom picturing the scenes which were once presented there; and, in such\r\na case, should the imagination be fettered? We give it free rein in\r\nterrestrial life, and it rewards us with some of our greatest\r\nintellectual pleasures. The wonderful landscapes of the moon offer it\r\nan ideal field with just enough half-hidden suggestions of facts to\r\nstimulate its powers.\r\n\r\nThe great plains of the _Mare Imbrium_ and the _Mare Serenitatis_ (the\r\n“Sea of Showers” and the “Sea of Serenity”), bordered in part by lofty\r\nmountain ranges precisely like terrestrial mountains, scalloped along\r\ntheir shores with beautiful bays curving back into the adjoining\r\nhighlands, and united by a great strait passing between the nearly\r\nabutting ends of the “Lunar Apennines” and the “Lunar Caucasus,” offer\r\nthe elements of a scene of world beauty such as it would be difficult\r\nto match upon our planet. Look at the finely modulated bottom of the\r\nancient sea in Mr Ritchey’s exquisite photograph of the western part of\r\nthe _Mare Serenitatis,_ where one seems to see the play of the watery\r\ncurrents heaping the ocean sands in waving lines, making shallows,\r\nbars, and deeps for the mariner to avoid or seek, and affording a\r\nplayground for the creatures of the main. What geologist would not wish\r\nto try his hammer on those rocks with their stony pages of fossilized\r\nhistory? There is in us an instinct which forbids us to think that\r\nthere was never any life there. If we could visit the moon, there is\r\nnot among us a person so prosaic and unimaginative that he would not,\r\nthe very first thing, begin to search for traces of its inhabitants. We\r\nwould look for them in the deposits on the sea bottoms; we would\r\nexamine the shores wherever the configuration seemed favorable for\r\nharbors and the sites of maritime cities—forgetting that it may be a\r\nlittle ridiculous to ascribe to the ancient lunarians the same ideas\r\nthat have governed the development of our race; we would search through\r\nthe valleys and along the seeming courses of vanished streams; we would\r\nexplore the mountains, not the terrible craters, but the pinnacled\r\nchains that recall our own Alps and Rockies; seeking everywhere some\r\nvestige of the transforming presence of intelligent life. Perhaps we\r\nshould find such traces, and perhaps, with all our searching, we should\r\nfind nothing to suggest that life had ever existed amid that universal\r\nruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Tranquilitatis and surroundings]\r\n\r\n\r\nLook again at the border of the “Sea of Serenity”—what a name for such\r\na scene!—and observe how it has been rent with almost inconceivable\r\nviolence, the wall of the colossal crater Posidonius dropping\r\nvertically upon the ancient shore and obliterating it, while its giant\r\nneighbor, Le Monnier, opens a yawning mouth as if to swallow the sea\r\nitself. A scene like this makes one question whether, after all, those\r\nmay not be right who have imagined that the so-called sea bottoms are\r\nreally vast plains of frozen lava which gushed up in floods so\r\nextensive that even the mighty volcanoes were half drowned in the fiery\r\nsea. This suggestion becomes even stronger when we turn to another of\r\nthe photographs of Mr Ritchey’s wonderful series, showing a part of the\r\n_Mare Tranquilitatis_ (“Sea of Tranquility”!). Notice how near the\r\ncenter of the picture the outline of a huge ring with radiating ridges\r\nshows through the sea bottom; a fossil volcano submerged in a petrified\r\nocean! This is by no means the only instance in which a buried world\r\nshows itself under the great lunar plains. Yet, as the newer craters in\r\nthe sea itself prove, the volcanic activity survived this other\r\ncatastrophe, or broke out again subsequently, bringing more ruin to\r\npile upon ruin.\r\n\r\nYet notwithstanding the evidence which we have just been considering in\r\nsupport of the hypothesis that the “seas” are lava floods, Messrs.\r\nLoewy and Puiseux, the selenographers of the Paris Observatory, are\r\nconvinced that these great plains bear characteristic marks of the\r\nformer presence of immense bodies of water. In that case we should be\r\nforced to conclude that the later oceans of the moon lay upon vast\r\nsheets of solidified lava; and thus the catastrophe of the lunar world\r\nassumes a double aspect, the earliest oceans being swallowed up in\r\nmolten floods issuing from the interior, while the lands were reduced\r\nto chaos by a universal eruption of tremendous volcanoes; and then a\r\nperiod of comparative quiet followed, during which new seas were\r\nformed, and new life perhaps began to flourish in the lunar world, only\r\nto end in another cataclysm, which finally put a term to the existence\r\nof the moon as a life-supporting world.\r\n\r\nSuppose we examine two more of Mr Ritchey’s illuminating photographs,\r\nand, first, the one showing the crater Theophilus and its surroundings.\r\nWe have spoken of Theophilus before, citing the facts that it is\r\nsixty-four miles in diameter and eighteen thousand feet deep. It will\r\nbe noticed that it has two brother giants—Cyrillus the nearer, and\r\nCatharina the more distant; but Theophilus is plainly the youngest of\r\nthe trio. Centuries, and perhaps thousands of years, must have elapsed\r\nbetween the periods of their upheaval, for the two older craters are\r\npartly filled with débris, while it is manifest at a glance that when\r\nthe south eastern wall of Theophilus was formed, it broke away and\r\ndestroyed a part of the more ancient ring of Cyrillus. There is no more\r\ntremendous scene on the moon than this; viewed with a powerful\r\ntelescope, it is absolutely appalling.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lunar craters Theophilus and surrounding region]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next photograph shows, if possible, a still wilder region. It is\r\nthe part of the moon lying between Tycho and the south pole. Tycho is\r\nseen in the lower left-hand part of the picture. To the right, at the\r\nedge of the illuminated portion of the moon, are the crater-rings,\r\nLongomontanus and Wilhelm I, the former being the larger. Between them\r\nare to be seen the ruins of two or three more ancient craters which,\r\ntogether with portions of the walls of Wilhelm I and Longomontanus,\r\nhave been honeycombed with smaller craters. The vast crateriform\r\ndepression above the center of the picture is Clavius, an unrivaled\r\nwonder of lunar scenery, a hundred and forty-two miles in its greatest\r\nlength, while its whole immense floor has sunk two miles below the\r\ngeneral surface of the moon outside the ring. The monstrous\r\nshadow-filled cavity above Clavius toward the right is Blancanus, whose\r\naspect here gives a good idea of the appearance of these chasms when\r\nonly their rims are in the sunlight. But observe the indescribable\r\nsavagery of the entire scene. It looks as though the spirit of\r\ndestruction had gone mad in this spot. The mighty craters have broken\r\nforth one after another, each rending its predecessor; and when their\r\nwork was finished, a minor but yet tremendous outbreak occurred, and\r\nthe face of the moon was gored and punctured with thousands of smaller\r\ncraters. These relatively small craters (small, however, only in a\r\nlunar sense, for many of them would appear gigantic on the earth)\r\nrecall once more the theory of meteoric impact. It does not seem\r\nimpossible that some of them may have been formed by such an agency.\r\n\r\nOne would not wish for our planet such a fate as that which has\r\novertaken the moon, but we cannot be absolutely sure that something of\r\nthe kind may not be in store for it. We really know nothing of the\r\nultimate causes of volcanic activity, and some have suggested that the\r\ninternal energies of the earth may be accumulating instead of dying\r\nout, and may never yet have exhibited their utmost destructive power.\r\nPerhaps the best assurance that we can find that the earth will escape\r\nthe catastrophe that has overtaken its satellite is to be found in the\r\nrelatively great force of its gravitation. The moon has been the victim\r\nof its weakness; given equal forces, and the earth would be the better\r\nable to withstand them. It is significant, in connection with these\r\nconsiderations, that the little planet Mercury, which seems also to\r\nhave parted with its air and water, shows to the telescope some\r\nindications that it is pitted with craters resembling those that have\r\ntorn to pieces the face of the moon.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, after studying the dreadful lunar landscapes, one\r\ncannot feel a very enthusiastic sympathy with those who are seeking\r\nindications of the continued existence of some kind of life on the\r\nmoon; such a world is better without inhabitants. It has met its fate;\r\nlet it go! Fortunately, it is not so near that it cannot hide its scars\r\nand appear beautiful—except when curiosity impels us to look with the\r\npenetrating eyes of the astronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mare Crisium]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\nThe Great Mars Problem\r\n\r\n\r\nLet any thoughtful person who is acquainted with the general facts of\r\nastronomy look up at the heavens some night when they appear in their\r\ngreatest splendor, and ask himself what is the strongest impression\r\nthat they make upon his mind. He may not find it easy to frame an\r\nanswer, but when he has succeeded it will probably be to the effect\r\nthat the stars give him an impression of the universality of\r\nintelligence; they make him feel, as the sun and the moon cannot do,\r\nthat his world is not alone; that all this was not made simply to form\r\na gorgeous canopy over the tents of men. If he is of a devout turn of\r\nmind, he thinks, as he gazes into those fathomless deeps and among\r\nthose bewildering hosts, of the infinite multitude of created beings\r\nthat the Almighty has taken under his care. The narrow ideas of the old\r\ngeocentric theology, which made the earth God’s especial footstool, and\r\nman his only rational creature, fall away from him like a veil that had\r\nobscured his vision; they are impossible in the presence of what he\r\nsees above. Thus the natural tendency, in the light of modern progress,\r\nis to regard the universe as everywhere filled with life.\r\n\r\nBut science, which is responsible for this broadening of men’s thoughts\r\nconcerning the universality of life, itself proceeds to set limits. Of\r\nspiritual existences it pretends to know nothing, but as to physical\r\nbeings, it declares that it can only entertain the supposition of their\r\nexistence where it finds evidence of an environment suited to their\r\nneeds, and such environment may not everywhere exist. Science, though\r\nrepelled by the antiquated theological conception of the supreme\r\nisolation of man among created beings, regards with complacency the\r\nprobability that there are regions in the universe where no organic\r\nlife exists, stars which shine upon no inhabited worlds, and planets\r\nwhich nourish no animate creatures. The astronomical view of the\r\nuniverse is that it consists of matter in every stage of evolution:\r\nsome nebulous and chaotic; some just condensing into stars (suns) of\r\nevery magnitude and order; some shaped into finished solar bodies\r\nsurrounded by dependent planets; some forming stars that perhaps have\r\nno planets, and will have none; some constituting suns that are already\r\naging, and will soon lose their radiant energy and disappear; and some\r\naggregated into masses that long ago became inert, cold, and rayless,\r\nand that can only be revivified by means about which we can form\r\nconjectures, but of which we actually know nothing.\r\n\r\nAs with the stars, so with the planets, which are the satellites of\r\nstars. All investigations unite to tell us that the planets are not all\r\nin the same state of development. As some are large and some small, so\r\nsome are, in an evolutionary sense, young, and some old. As they depend\r\nupon the suns around which they revolve for their light, heat, and\r\nother forms of radiant energy, so their condition varies with their\r\ndistance from those suns. Many may never arrive at a state suitable for\r\nthe maintenance of life upon their surfaces; some which are not at\r\npresent in such a state may attain it later; and the forms of life\r\nthemselves may vary with the peculiar environment that different\r\nplanets afford. Thus we see that we are not scientifically justified in\r\naffirming that life is ubiquitous, although we are thus justified in\r\nsaying that it must be, in a general sense, universal. We might liken\r\nthe universe to a garden known to contain every variety of plant. If on\r\nentering it we see no flowers, we examine the species before us and\r\nfind that they are not of those which bloom at this particular season,\r\nor perhaps they are such as never bear flowers. Yet we feel no doubt\r\nthat we shall find flowers somewhere in the garden, because there _are_\r\nspecies which bloom at this season, and the garden contains _all_\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nWhile it is tacitly assumed that there are planets revolving around\r\nother stars than the sun, it would be impossible for us to see them\r\nwith any telescope yet invented, and no instrument now in the\r\npossession of astronomers could assure us of their existence; so the\r\nonly planetary system of which we have visual knowledge is our own.\r\nExcluding the asteroids, which could not from any point of view be\r\nconsidered as habitable, we have in the solar system eight planets of\r\nvarious sizes and situated at various distances from the sun. Of these\r\neight we know that one, the earth, is inhabited. The question, then,\r\narises: Are there any of the others which are inhabited or habitable?\r\nSince it is our intention to discuss the habitability of only one of\r\nthe seven to which the question applies, the rest may be dismissed in a\r\nfew words. The smallest of them, and the nearest to the sun, is\r\nMercury, which is regarded as uninhabitable because it has no\r\nperceptible supply of water and air, and because, owing to the\r\nextraordinary eccentricity of its orbit, it is subjected to excessive\r\nand very rapid alterations in the amount of solar heat and light poured\r\nupon its surface, such alterations being inconsistent with the\r\nsupposition that it can support living beings. Even its average\r\ntemperature is more than six and a half times that prevailing on the\r\nearth! Another circumstance which militates against its habitability is\r\nthat, according to the results of the best telescopic studies, it\r\nalways keeps the same face toward the sun, so that one half of the\r\nplanet is perpetually exposed to the fierce solar rays, and the other\r\nhalf faces the unmitigated cold of open space. Venus, the next in\r\ndistance from the sun, is almost the exact twin of the earth in size,\r\nand many arguments may be urged in favor of its habitability, although\r\nit is suspected of possessing the same peculiarity as Mercury, in\r\nalways keeping the same side sunward. Unfortunately its atmosphere\r\nappears to be so dense that no permanent markings on its surface are\r\ncertainly visible, and the question of its actual condition must, for\r\nthe present, be left in abeyance. Mars, the first planet more distant\r\nfrom the sun than the earth, is the special subject of this chapter,\r\nand will be described and discussed a few lines further on. Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the four giant planets, all more distant\r\nthan Mars, and each more distant than the other in the order named, are\r\nall regarded as uninhabitable because none of them appears to possess\r\nany degree of solidity. They may have solid or liquid nuclei, but\r\nexteriorly they seem to be mere balls of cloud. Of course, one can\r\nimagine what he pleases about the existence of creatures suited to the\r\nphysical constitution of such planets as these, but they must be\r\nexcluded from the category of habitable worlds in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term. We go back, then, to Mars.\r\n\r\nIt will be best to begin with a description of the planet. Mars is 4230\r\nmiles in diameter; its surface is not much more than one-quarter as\r\nextensive as that of the earth (.285). Its mean distance from the sun\r\nis 141,500,000 miles, 48,500,000 miles greater than that of the earth.\r\nSince radiant energy varies inversely as the square of distance, Mars\r\nreceives less than half as much solar light and heat as the earth gets.\r\nMars’ year (period of revolution round the sun) is 687 days. Its mean\r\ndensity is 71 per cent of the earth’s, and the force of gravity on its\r\nsurface is 38 per cent of that on the surface of the earth; _i.e.,_ a\r\nbody weighing one hundred pounds on the earth would, if transported to\r\nMars, weigh but thirty-eight pounds. The inclination of its equator to\r\nthe plane of its orbit differs very little from that of the earth’s\r\nequator, and its axial rotation occupies 24 hours 37 minutes. so that\r\nthe length of day and night, and the extent of the seasonal changes on\r\nMars, are almost precisely the same as on the earth. But owing to the\r\ngreater length of its year, the seasons of Mars, while occurring in the\r\nsame order, are almost twice as long as ours. The surface of the planet\r\nis manifestly solid, like that of our globe, and the telescope reveals\r\nmany permanent markings on it, recalling the appearance of a globe on\r\nwhich geographical features have been represented in reddish and dusky\r\ntints. Around the poles are plainly to be seen rounded white areas,\r\nwhich vary in extent with the Martian seasons, nearly vanishing in\r\nsummer and extending widely in winter. The most recent spectroscopic\r\ndeterminations indicate that Mars has an atmosphere perhaps as dense as\r\nthat to be found on our loftiest mountain peaks, and there is a\r\nperceptible amount of watery vapor in this atmosphere. The surface of\r\nthe planet appears to be remarkably level, and it has no mountain\r\nranges. No evidences of volcanic action have been discovered on Mars.\r\nThe dusky and reddish areas were regarded by the early observers as\r\nrespectively seas and lands, but at present it is not believed that\r\nthere are any bodies of water on the planet. There has never been much\r\ndoubt expressed that the white areas about the poles represent snow.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this brief description that many remarkable\r\nresemblances exist between Mars and the earth, and there is nothing\r\nwonderful in the fact that the question of the habitability of the\r\nformer has become one of extreme and wide-spread interest, giving rise\r\nto the most diverse views, to many extraordinary speculations, and\r\nsometimes to regrettably heated controversy. The first champion of the\r\nhabitability of Mars was Sir William Herschel, although even before his\r\ntime the idea had been suggested. He was convinced by the revelations\r\nof his telescopes, continually increasing in power, that Mars was more\r\nlike the earth than any other planet. He could not resist the testimony\r\nof the polar snows, whose suggestive conduct was in such striking\r\naccord with what occurs upon the earth. Gradually, as telescopes\r\nimproved and observers increased in number, the principal features of\r\nthe planet were disclosed and charted, and “areography,” as the\r\ngeography of Mars was called, took its place among the recognized\r\nbranches of astronomical study. But it was not before 1877 that a\r\nfundamentally new discovery in areography gave a truly sensational turn\r\nto speculation about life on “the red planet.” In that year Mars made\r\none of its nearest approaches to the earth, and was so situated in its\r\norbit that it could be observed to great advantage from the northern\r\nhemisphere of the earth. The celebrated Italian astronomer,\r\nSchiaparelli, took advantage of this opportunity to make a\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the surface of Mars—as coolly and confidently\r\nas if he were not taking his sights across a thirty-five-million-mile\r\ngulf of empty space—and in the course of this survey he was astonished\r\nto perceive that the reddish areas, then called continents, were\r\ncrossed in many directions by narrow, dusky lines, to which he gave the\r\nsuggestive name of “canals.” Thus a kind of firebrand was cast into the\r\nfield of astronomical speculation, which has ever since produced\r\ndisputes that have sometimes approached the violence of political\r\nfaction. At first the accuracy of Schiaparelli’s observations was\r\ncontested; it required a powerful telescope, and the most excellent\r\n“seeing,” to render the enigmatical lines visible at all, and many\r\nsearchers were unable to detect them. But Schiaparelli continued his\r\nstudies in the serene sky of Italy, and produced charts of the\r\ngridironed face of Mars containing so much astonishing detail that one\r\nhad either to reject them _in toto_ or to confess that Schiaparelli was\r\nright. As subsequent favorable oppositions of Mars occurred, other\r\nobservers began to see the “canals” and to confirm the substantial\r\naccuracy of the Italian astronomer’s work, and finally few were found\r\nwho would venture to affirm that the “canals” did not exist, whatever\r\ntheir meaning might be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Schiaparelli’s chart of Mars, showing the so-called\r\nsystem of canals]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Schiaparelli began his observations it was generally believed, as\r\nwe have said, that the dusky areas on Mars were seas, and since\r\nSchiaparelli thought that the “canals” invariably began and ended at\r\nthe shores of the “seas,” the appropriateness of the title given to the\r\nlines seemed apparent. Their artificial character was immediately\r\nassumed by many, because they were too straight and too suggestively\r\ngeometrical in their arrangement to permit the conclusion that they\r\nwere natural watercourses. A most surprising circumstance noted by\r\nSchiaparelli was that the “canals” made their appearance _after_ the\r\nmelting of the polar snow in the corresponding hemisphere had begun,\r\nand that they grew darker, longer, and more numerous in proportion as\r\nthe polar liquidation proceeded; another very puzzling observation was\r\nthat many of them became double as the season advanced; close beside an\r\nalready existing “canal,” and in perfect parallelism with it, another\r\nwould gradually make its appearance. That these phenomena actually\r\nexisted and were not illusions was proved by later observations, and\r\ntoday they are seen whenever Mars is favorably situated for\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nIn the closing decade of the nineteenth century, Mr Percival Lowell\r\ntook up the work where Schiaparelli had virtually dropped it, and soon\r\nadded a great number of “canals” to those previously known, so that in\r\nhis charts the surface of the wonderful little planet appears covered\r\nas with a spider’s web, the dusky lines criss-crossing in every\r\ndirection, with conspicuous knots wherever a number of them come\r\ntogether. Mr Lowell has demonstrated that the areas originally called\r\nseas, and thus named on the earlier charts, are not bodies of water,\r\nwhatever else they may be. He has also found that the mysterious lines\r\ndo not, as Schiaparelli supposed, begin and end at the edges of the\r\ndusky regions, but often continue on across them, reaching in some\r\ncases far up into the polar regions. But Schiaparelli was right in his\r\nobservation that the appearance of the “canals” is synchronous with the\r\ngradual disappearance of the polar snows, and this fact has become the\r\nbasis of the most extraordinary theory that the subject of life in\r\nother worlds has ever given birth to.\r\n\r\nNow, the effect of such discoveries, as we have related, depends upon\r\nthe type of mind to whose attention they are called. Many are content\r\nto accept them as strange and inexplicable at present, and to wait for\r\nfurther light upon them; others insist upon an immediate inquiry\r\nconcerning their probable nature and meaning. Such an inquiry can only\r\nbe based upon inference proceeding from analogy. Mars, say Mr Lowell\r\nand those who are of his opinion, is manifestly a solidly incrusted\r\nplanet like the earth; it has an atmosphere, though one of great\r\nrarity; it has water vapor, as the snows in themselves prove; it has\r\nthe alternation of day and night, and a succession of seasons closely\r\nresembling those of the earth; its surface is suggestively divided into\r\nregions of contrasting colors and appearance, and upon that surface we\r\nsee an immense number of lines geometrically arranged, with a system of\r\nsymmetrical intersections where the lines expand into circular and oval\r\nareas—and all connected with the annual melting of the polar snows in a\r\nway which irresistibly suggests the interference of intelligence\r\ndirected to a definite end. Why, with so many concurrent circumstances\r\nto support the hypothesis, should we not regard Mars as an inhabited\r\nglobe?\r\n\r\nBut the differences between Mars and the earth are in many ways as\r\nstriking as their resemblances. Mars is relatively small; it gets less\r\nthan half as much light and heat as we receive; its atmosphere is so\r\nrare that it would be distressing to us, even if we could survive in it\r\nat all; it has no lakes, rivers, or seas; its surface is an endless\r\nprairie. and its “canals” are phenomena utterly unlike anything on the\r\nearth. Yet it is precisely upon these divergences between the earth and\r\nMars, this repudiation of terrestrial standards, that the theory of\r\n“life on Mars,” for which Mr Lowell is mainly responsible, is based.\r\nBecause Mars is smaller than the earth, we are told it must necessarily\r\nbe more advanced in planetary evolution, the underlying cause of which\r\nis the gradual cooling and contraction of the planet’s mass. Mars has\r\nparted with its internal heat more rapidly than the earth; consequently\r\nits waters and its atmosphere have been mostly withdrawn by chemical\r\ncombinations, but enough of both yet remain to render life still\r\npossible on its surface. As the globe of Mars is evolutionally older\r\nthan that of the earth, so its forms of organic life may be\r\nproportionally further advanced, and its inhabitants may have attained\r\na degree of cultivated intelligence much superior to what at present\r\nexists upon the earth. Understanding the nature and the causes of the\r\ndesiccation of their planet, and possessing engineering science and\r\ncapabilities far in advance of ours, they may be conceived to have\r\ngrappled with the stupendous problem of keeping their world in a\r\nhabitable condition as long as possible. Supposing them to have become\r\naccustomed to live in their rarefied atmosphere (a thing not\r\ninconceivable, since men can live for a time at least in air hardly\r\nless rare), the most pressing problem for them is that of a\r\nwater-supply, without which plant life cannot exist, while animal life\r\nin turn depends for its existence upon vegetation. The only direction\r\nin which they can seek water is that of the polar regions, where it is\r\nalternately condensed into snow and released in the liquid form by the\r\neffect of the seasonal changes. It is, then, to the annual melting of\r\nthe polar snow-fields that the Martian engineers are supposed to have\r\nrecourse in supplying the needs of their planet, and thus providing the\r\nmeans of prolonging their own existence. It is imagined that they have\r\nfor this purpose constructed a stupendous system of irrigation\r\nextending over the temperate and equatorial regions of the planet. The\r\n“canals” represent the lines of irrigation, but the narrow streaks that\r\nwe see are not the canals themselves, but the irrigated bands covered\r\nby them. Their dark hue, and their gradual appearance after the polar\r\nmelting has begun, are due to the growth of vegetation stimulated by\r\nthe water. The rounded areas visible where several “canals” meet and\r\ncross are called by Mr Lowell “oases.” These are supposed to be the\r\nprincipal centers of population and industry. It must be confessed that\r\nsome of them, with their complicated systems of radiating lines, appear\r\nto answer very well to such a theory. No attempt to explain them by\r\nanalogy with natural phenomena on the earth has proved successful.\r\n\r\nBut a great difficulty yet remains: How to explain the seemingly\r\nmiraculous powers of the supposed engineers? Here recourse is had once\r\nmore to the relative smallness of the planet. We have remarked that the\r\nforce of gravity on Mars is only thirty-eight per cent of that on the\r\nearth. A steam-shovel driven by a certain horse-power would be nearly\r\nthree times as effective there as here. A man of our stature on Mars\r\nwould find his effective strength increased in the same proportion. But\r\njust because of the slight force of gravity there, a Martian might\r\nattain to the traditional stature of Goliath without finding his own\r\nweight an encumbrance to his activity, while at the same time his huge\r\nmuscles would come into unimpeded play, enabling him single-handed to\r\nperform labors that would be impossible to a whole gang of terrestrial\r\nworkmen. The effective powers of huge machines would be increased in\r\nthe same way; and to all this must be added the fact that the mean\r\ndensity of the materials of which Mars is composed is much less than\r\nthat of the constituents of the earth. Combining all these\r\nconsiderations, it becomes much less difficult to conceive that public\r\nworks might be successfully undertaken on Mars which would be\r\nhopelessly beyond the limits of human accomplishment.\r\n\r\nCertain other difficulties have also to be met; as, for instance, the\r\nrelative coldness of the climate of Mars. At its distance it gets\r\nconsiderably less than half as much light and heat as we receive. In\r\naddition to this, the rarity of its atmosphere would naturally be\r\nexpected to decrease the effective temperature at the planet’s surface,\r\nsince an atmosphere acts somewhat like the glass cover of a hot-house\r\nin retaining the solar heat which has penetrated it. It has been\r\ncalculated that, unless there are mitigating circumstances of which we\r\nknow nothing, the average temperature at the surface of Mars must be\r\nfar below the freezing-point of water. To this it is replied that the\r\npossible mitigating circumstances spoken of evidently exist in fact,\r\nbecause we can _see_ that the watery vapor condenses into snow around\r\nthe poles in winter, but melts again when summer comes. The mitigating\r\nagent may be supposed to exist in the atmosphere where the presence of\r\ncertain gases would completely alter the temperature gradients.\r\n\r\nIt might also be objected that it is inconceivable that the Martian\r\nengineers, however great may be their physical powers, and however\r\ngigantic the mechanical energies under their control, could force water\r\nin large quantities from the poles to the equator. This is an\r\nachievement that measures up to the cosmical standard. It is admitted\r\nby the champions of the theory that the difficulty is a formidable one;\r\nbut they call attention to the singular fact that on Mars there can be\r\nfound no chains of mountains, and it is even doubtful if ranges of\r\nhills exist there. The entire surface of the planet appears to be\r\nalmost “as smooth as a billiard ball,” and even the broad regions which\r\nwere once supposed to be seas apparently lie at practically the same\r\nlevel as the other parts, since the “canals” in many cases run\r\nuninterruptedly across them. Lowell’s idea is that these sombre areas\r\nmay be expanses of vegetation covering ground of a more or less marshy\r\ncharacter, for while the largest of them appear to be permanent, there\r\nare some which vary coincidently with the variations of the canals.\r\n\r\nAs to the kind of machinery employed to force the water from the poles,\r\nit has been conjectured that it may have taken the form of a gigantic\r\nsystem of pumps and conduits; and since the Martians are assumed to be\r\nso far in advance of us in their mastery of scientific principles, the\r\nhypothesis will at least not be harmed by supposing that they have\r\nlearned to harness forces of nature whose very existence in a\r\nmanageable form is yet unrecognized on the earth. If we wish to let the\r\nimagination loose, we may conjecture that they have conquered the\r\nsecret of those intra-atomic forces whose resistless energy is\r\nbeginning to become evident to us, but the possibility of whose\r\nutilization remains a dream, the fulfillment of which nobody dares to\r\npredict.\r\n\r\nSuch, in very brief form, is the celebrated theory of Mars as an\r\ninhabited world. It certainly captivates the imagination, and if we\r\nbelieve it to represent the facts, we cannot but watch with the deepest\r\nsympathy this gallant struggle of an intellectual race to preserve its\r\nplanet from the effects of advancing age and death. We may, indeed,\r\nwonder whether our own humanity, confronted by such a calamity, could\r\nbe counted on to meet the emergency with equal stoutness of heart and\r\ninexhaustibleness of resource. Up to the present time we certainly have\r\nshown no capacity to confront Nature toe to toe, and to seize her by\r\nthe shoulders and turn her round when she refuses to go our way. If we\r\ncould get into wireless telephonic communication with the Martians we\r\nmight learn from their own lips the secret of their more than “Roman\r\nrecovery.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\nThe Riddle of the Asteroids\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter revolves the most remarkable\r\nsystem of little bodies with which we are acquainted—the Asteroids, or\r\nMinor Planets. Some six hundred are now known, and they may actually\r\nnumber thousands. They form virtually a ring about the sun. The most\r\nstriking general fact about them is that they occupy the place in the\r\nsky which should be occupied, according to Bode’s Law, by a single\r\nlarge planet. This fact, as we shall see, has led to the invention of\r\none of the most extraordinary theories in astronomy—_viz.,_ that of the\r\nexplosion of a world!\r\n\r\nBode’s Law, so-called, is only an empiric formula, but until the\r\ndiscovery of Neptune it accorded so well with the distances of the\r\nplanets that astronomers were disposed to look upon it as really\r\nrepresenting some underlying principle of planetary distribution. They\r\nwere puzzled by the absence of a planet in the space between Mars and\r\nJupiter, where the “law” demanded that there should be one, and an\r\nassociation of astronomers was formed to search for it. There was a\r\ndecided sensation when, in 1801, Piazzi, of Palermo, announced that he\r\nhad found a little planet which apparently occupied the place in the\r\nsystem which belonged to the missing body. He named it Ceres, and it\r\nwas the first of the Asteroids. The next year Olbers, of Bremen, while\r\nlooking for Ceres with his telescope, stumbled upon another small\r\nplanet which he named Pallas. Immediately he was inspired with the idea\r\nthat these two planets were fragments of a larger one which had\r\nformerly occupied the vacant place in the planetary ranks, and he\r\npredicted that others would be found by searching in the neighborhood\r\nof the intersection of the orbits of the two already discovered. This\r\nbold prediction was brilliantly fulfilled by the finding of two\r\nmore—Juno in 1804, and Vesta in 1807. Olbers would seem to have been\r\nled to the invention of his hypothesis of a planetary explosion by the\r\nfaith which astronomers at that time had in Bode’s Law. They appear to\r\nhave thought that several planets revolving in the gap where the “law”\r\ncalled for but one could only be accounted for upon the theory that the\r\noriginal _one_ had been broken up to form the several. Gravitation\r\ndemanded that the remnants of a planet blown to pieces, no matter how\r\ntheir orbits might otherwise differ, should all return at stated\r\nperiods to the point where the explosion had occurred; hence Olbers’\r\nprediction that any asteroids that might subsequently be discovered\r\nwould be found to have a common point of orbital intersection. And\r\ncuriously enough all of the first asteroids found practically answered\r\nto this requirement. Olbers’ theory seemed to be established.\r\n\r\nAfter the first four, no more asteroids were found until 1845, when one\r\nwas discovered; then, in 1847, three more were added to the list; and\r\nafter that searchers began to pick them up with such rapidity that by\r\nthe close of the century hundreds were known, and it had become almost\r\nimpossible to keep track of them. The first four are by far the largest\r\nmembers of the group, but their actual sizes remained unknown until\r\nless than twenty years ago. It was long supposed that Vesta was the\r\nlargest, because it shines more brightly than any of the others; but\r\nfinally, in 1895, Barnard, with the Lick telescope, definitely measured\r\ntheir diameters, and proved to everybody’s surprise that Ceres is\r\nreally the chief, and Vesta only the third in rank. His measures are as\r\nfollows: Ceres, 477 miles; Pallas, 304 miles; Vesta, 239 miles; and\r\nJuno, 120 miles. They differ greatly in the reflective power of their\r\nsurfaces, a fact of much significance in connection with the question\r\nof their origin. Vesta is, surface for surface, rather more than three\r\ntimes as brilliant as Ceres, whence the original mistake about its\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nNowadays new asteroids are found frequently by photography, but\r\nphysically they are most insignificant bodies, their average diameter\r\nprobably not exceeding twenty miles, and some are believed not to\r\nexceed ten. On a planet only ten miles in diameter, assuming the same\r\nmean density as the earth’s, which is undoubtedly too much, the force\r\nof gravity would be so slight that an average man would not weigh more\r\nthan three ounces, and could jump off into space whenever he liked.\r\n\r\nAlthough the asteroids all revolve around the sun in the same direction\r\nas that pursued by the major planets, their orbits are inclined at a\r\ngreat variety of angles to the general plane of the planetary system,\r\nand some of them are very eccentric—almost as much so as the orbits of\r\nmany of the periodic comets. It has even been conjectured that the two\r\ntiny moons of Mars and the four smaller satellites of Jupiter may be\r\nasteroids gone astray and captured by those planets. Two of the\r\nasteroids are exceedingly remarkable for the shapes and positions of\r\ntheir orbits; these are Eros, discovered in 1898, and T. G., 1906,\r\nfound eight years later. The latter has a mean distance from the sun\r\nslightly greater than that of Jupiter, while the mean distance of Eros\r\nis less than that of Mars. The orbit of Eros is so eccentric that at\r\ntimes it approaches within 15,000,000 miles of the earth, nearer than\r\nany other regular member of the solar system except the moon, thus\r\naffording an unrivaled means of measuring the solar parallax. But for\r\nour present purpose the chief interest of Eros lies in its\r\nextraordinary changes of light.\r\n\r\nThese changes, although irregular, have been observed and photographed\r\nmany times, and there seems to be no doubt of their reality. Their\r\nsignificance consists in their possible connection with the form of the\r\nlittle planet, whose diameter is generally estimated at not more than\r\ntwenty miles. Von Oppolzer found, in 1901, that Eros lost three-fourths\r\nof its brilliancy once in every two hours and thirty-eight minutes.\r\nOther observers have found slightly different periods of variability,\r\nbut none as long as three hours. The most interesting interpretation\r\nthat has been offered of this phenomenon is that it is due to a great\r\nirregularity of figure, recalling at once Olbers’ hypothesis. According\r\nto some, Eros may be double, the two bodies composing it revolving\r\naround each other at very close quarters; but a more striking, and it\r\nmay be said probable, suggestion is that Eros has a form not unlike\r\nthat of a dumb-bell, or hour-glass, turning rapidly end over end so\r\nthat the area of illuminated surface presented to our eyes continually\r\nchanges, reaching at certain times a minimum when the amount of light\r\nthat it reflects toward the earth is reduced to a quarter of its\r\nmaximum value. Various other bizarre shapes have been ascribed to Eros,\r\nsuch, for instance, as that of a flat stone revolving about one of its\r\nlonger axes, so that sometimes we see its face and sometimes its edge.\r\n\r\nAll of these explanations proceed upon the assumption that Eros cannot\r\nhave a simple globular figure like that of a typical planet, a figure\r\nwhich is prescribed by the law of gravitation, but that its shape is\r\nwhat may be called accidental; in a word, it is a _fragment,_ for it\r\nseems impossible to believe that a body formed in interplanetary space,\r\neither through nebular condensation or through the aggregation of\r\nparticles drawn together by their mutual attractions, should not be\r\npractically spherical in shape. Nor is Eros the only asteroid that\r\ngives evidence by variations of brilliancy that there is something\r\nabnormal in its constitution; several others present the same\r\nphenomenon in varying degrees. Even Vesta was regarded by Olbers as\r\nsufficiently variable in its light to warrant the conclusion that it\r\nwas an angular mass instead of a globe. Some of the smaller ones show\r\nvery notable variations, and all in short periods, of three or four\r\nhours, suggesting that in turning about one of their axes they present\r\na surface of variable extent toward the sun and the earth.\r\n\r\nThe theory which some have preferred—that the variability of light is\r\ndue to the differences of reflective power on different parts of the\r\nsurface—would, if accepted, be hardly less suggestive of the origin of\r\nthese little bodies by the breaking up of a larger one, because the\r\nmost natural explanation of such differences would seem to be that they\r\narose from variations in the roughness or smoothness of the reflecting\r\nsurface, which would be characteristic of fragmentary bodies. In the\r\ncase of a large planet alternating expanses of land and water, or of\r\nvegetation and desert, would produce a notable variation in the amount\r\nof reflection, but on bodies of the size of the asteroids neither water\r\nnor vegetation could exist, and an atmosphere would be equally\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest objections to Olbers’ hypothesis is that only a\r\nfew of the first asteroids discovered travel in orbits which measurably\r\nsatisfy the requirement that they should all intersect at the point\r\nwhere the explosion occurred. To this it was at first replied that the\r\nperturbations of the asteroidal orbits, by the attractions of the major\r\nplanets, would soon displace them in such a manner that they would\r\ncease to intersect. One of the first investigations undertaken by the\r\nlate Prof. Simon Newcomb was directed to the solution of this question,\r\nand he arrived at the conclusion that the planetary perturbations could\r\nnot explain the actual situation of the asteroidal orbits. But\r\nafterward it was pointed out that the difficulty could be avoided by\r\nsupposing that not one but a series of explosions had produced the\r\nasteroids as they now are. After the primary disruption the fragments\r\nthemselves, according to this suggestion, may have exploded, and then\r\nthe resulting orbits would be as “tangled” as the heart could wish.\r\nThis has so far rehabilitated the explosion theory that it has never\r\nbeen entirely abandoned, and the evidence which we have just cited of\r\nthe probably abnormal shapes of Eros and other asteroids has lately\r\ngiven it renewed life. It is a subject that needs a thorough\r\nrediscussion.\r\n\r\nWe must not fail to mention, however, that there is a rival hypothesis\r\nwhich commends itself to many astronomers—_viz.,_ that the asteroids\r\nwere formed out of a relatively scant ring of matter, situated between\r\nMars and Jupiter and resembling in composition the immensely more\r\nmassive rings from which, according to Laplace’s hypothesis, the\r\nplanets were born. It is held by the supporters of this theory that the\r\nattraction of the giant Jupiter was sufficient to prevent the small,\r\nnebulous ring that gave birth to the asteroids from condensing like the\r\nothers into a single planet.\r\n\r\nBut if we accept the explosion theory, with its corollary that minor\r\nexplosions followed the principal one, we have still an unanswered\r\nquestion before us: What caused the explosions? The idea of _a world\r\nblowing up_ is too Titanic to be shocking; it rather amuses the\r\nimagination than seriously impresses it; in a word, it seems\r\nessentially chimerical. We can by no appeal to experience form a mental\r\npicture of such an occurrence. Even the moon did not blow up when it\r\nwas wrecked by volcanoes. The explosive nebulæ and new stars are far\r\naway in space, and suggest no connection with such a catastrophe as the\r\nbursting of a planet into hundreds of pieces. We cannot conceive of a\r\ngreat globe thousands of miles in diameter resembling a pellet of\r\ngunpowder only awaiting the touch of a match to cause its sudden\r\ndisruption. Somehow the thought of human agency obtrudes itself in\r\nconnection with the word “explosion,” and we smile at the idea that\r\ngiant powder or nitro-glycerine could blow up a planet. Yet it would\r\nonly need _enough_ of them to do it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we may deceive ourselves in thinking, as we are apt to do,\r\nthat explosive energies lock themselves up only in small masses of\r\nmatter. There are many causes producing explosions in nature, every\r\nvolcanic eruption manifests the activity of some of them. Think of the\r\ngiant power of confined steam; if enough steam could be suddenly\r\ngenerated in the center of the earth by a downpour of all the waters of\r\nthe oceans, what might not the consequences be for our globe? In a\r\nsmaller globe, and it has never been estimated that the original\r\nasteroid was even as large as the moon, such a catastrophe would,\r\nperhaps, be more easily conceivable; but since we are compelled in this\r\ncase to assume that there was a series of successive explosions, steam\r\nwould hardly answer the purpose; it would be more reasonable to suppose\r\nthat the cause of the explosion was some kind of chemical reaction, or\r\nsomething affecting the atoms composing the exploding body. Here Dr\r\nGustav Le Bon comes to our aid with a most startling suggestion, based\r\non his theory of the dissipation of intra-atomic energy. It will be\r\nbest to quote him at some length from his book on _The Evolution of\r\nForces._\r\n\r\n“It does not seem at first sight,” says Doctor Le Bon,\r\n\r\n\r\nvery comprehensible that worlds which appear more and more stable as\r\nthey cool could become so unstable as to afterward dissociate entirely.\r\nTo explain this phenomenon, we will inquire whether astronomical\r\nobservations do not allow us to witness this dissociation.\r\n\r\nWe know that the stability of a body in motion, such as a top or a\r\nbicycle, ceases to be possible when its velocity of rotation descends\r\nbelow a certain limit. Once this limit is reached it loses its\r\nstability and falls to the ground. Prof. J. J. Thomson even interprets\r\nradio-activity in this manner, and points out that when the speed of\r\nthe elements composing the atoms descends below a certain limit they\r\nbecome unstable and tend to lose their equilibria. There would result\r\nfrom this a commencement of dissociation, with diminution of their\r\npotential energy and a corresponding increase of their kinetic energy\r\nsufficient to launch into space the products of intra-atomic\r\ndisintegration.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the atom being an enormous reservoir of\r\nenergy is by this very fact comparable with explosive bodies. These\r\nlast remain inert so long as their internal equilibria are undisturbed.\r\nSo soon as some cause or other modifies these, they explode and smash\r\neverything around them after being themselves broken to pieces.\r\n\r\nAtoms, therefore, which grow old in consequence of the diminution of a\r\npart of their intra-atomic energy gradually lose their stability. A\r\nmoment, then, arrives when this stability is so weak that the matter\r\ndisappears by a sort of explosion more or less rapid. The bodies of the\r\nradium group offer an image of this phenomenon—a rather faint image,\r\nhowever, because the atoms of this body have only reached a period of\r\ninstability when the dissociation is rather slow. It probably precedes\r\nanother and more rapid period of dissociation capable of producing\r\ntheir final explosion. Bodies such as radium, thorium, etc., represent,\r\nno doubt, a state of old age at which all bodies must some day arrive,\r\nand which they already begin to manifest in our universe, since all\r\nmatter is slightly radio-active. It would suffice for the dissociation\r\nto be fairly general and fairly rapid for an explosion to occur in a\r\nworld where it was manifested.\r\n\r\nThese theoretical considerations find a solid support in the sudden\r\nappearances and disappearances of stars. The explosions of a world\r\nwhich produce them reveal to us, perhaps, how the universes perish when\r\nthey become old.\r\n\r\nAs astronomical observations show the relative frequency of these rapid\r\ndestructions, we may ask ourselves whether the end of a universe by a\r\nsudden explosion after a long period of old age does not represent its\r\nmost general ending.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, it will be well to stop, since, entrancing as the\r\nsubject may be, we know very little about it, and Doctor Le Bon’s\r\ntheory affords a limitless field for the reader’s imagination.",
