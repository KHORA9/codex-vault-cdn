Such a schedule of decrees and\r\nregulations can, of course, lay no claim to completeness. I have\r\nattempted simply to present examples of prohibitions and condemnations,\r\nfrom decade to decade, which were typical or characteristic, and from\r\nwhich some impression could be gathered as to the nature and the extent\r\nof the censorship experiments throughout the centuries in the several\r\ncommunities concerned.\r\n\r\nA brief account has been added of the organisation and of the\r\noperations of the Roman Inquisition and of the Congregation of the\r\nIndex, as it was from these bodies that emanated the series of papal\r\nIndexes, and with them rested, from the middle of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the responsibility for the shaping of the general policy of\r\nthe Church in regard to censorship. The plan of the treatise does\r\nnot render it practicable to attempt any general survey of political\r\ncensorship or the censorship of the State, but I have presented a brief\r\nselection of examples of State action in censorship, in order to make\r\nthe necessary comparison between the methods followed by the State\r\nand those of the Church, and to make clear that the censorship of the\r\nRoman Church was (at least outside of Spain) not so autocratic in its\r\nprinciples, nor so exacting and burdensome in its methods, as was the\r\ncensorship which was from time to time attempted by State governments\r\nacting for the most part under Protestant influence.\r\n\r\nI have attempted to base upon these schedules and records some\r\nconclusions as to the actual influence of the general system of\r\ncensorship, as connected more particularly with the enforcement of\r\nthe penalties prescribed by the Indexes, upon the production and\r\ndistribution of literature in the several communities which recognised\r\nto a greater or less extent the authority of the Church. An interesting\r\nindication of the extent of this influence is given through the\r\nrecords of the business of the printer-publishers and booksellers\r\nof the period, in such States as Italy, Spain, France, Germany, the\r\nNetherlands, and England.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have attempted, in the closing chapters, to make a study of\r\nthe literary policy of the modern Church as indicated in the latest\r\nof the papal Indexes and in certain utterances by representative\r\nCatholics concerning the censorship policy of the Church, which have\r\ncome into print during the past quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIn collecting the material for the several schedules of Indexes,\r\ndecrees, etc., I am chiefly indebted to the treatise of Heinrich\r\nReusch, _Der Index der Verbotenen Bücher_, published in Bonn\r\nin 1885. Dr. Reusch’s work may be described as monumental in the\r\nthoroughness and authoritativeness of its scholarship. The information\r\npresented in regard to the series of Indexes and decrees is most\r\ncomprehensive and precise. The compass of Reusch’s three volumes (which\r\ncomprise twenty-four hundred closely printed octavo pages) renders\r\nthem, however, unavailable for the use of the general reader. I have\r\nknowledge of no work in English which presents, with any measure of\r\ncompleteness, the record of the Indexes, and of no book in any language\r\nwhich attempts a general survey of the purpose and results of the\r\ncensorship of the Church. It has seemed to me, therefore, that I might\r\nrender some service to the study of the conditions affecting literary\r\nproduction and distribution, by utilising certain portions of the\r\nmaterial collected by Reusch in a work prepared for English-speaking\r\nreaders, which should present the schedule of the Indexes and a summary\r\nof the more noteworthy of the decrees, edicts, briefs, etc., having to\r\ndo with censorship, and by connecting with this a study of the results\r\nsecured through this censorship policy of the Church and of the range\r\nof its influence.\r\n\r\nI have been able to include in the catalogue of Indexes certain titles\r\nwhich were not listed by Reusch, and I have added the record of the\r\nIndexes which have been published since the date of Reusch’s treatise.\r\nI have not been dependent upon Reusch’s schedules for the contents\r\nof the Indexes themselves, as I have been able to make a personal\r\nexamination of all of the more important Indexes in the series from\r\nexamples in my own library, and in the comprehensive collection of\r\nmy valued friend Mr. Archer M. Huntington. Mr. Huntington has, I may\r\nmention, rendered a most important service to students of the Index\r\nthrough his reprints, produced in facsimile, of five of the earlier\r\nissues as follows: Louvain, 1546; Louvain, 1550; Cordova, 1550;\r\nCordova, 1554; Valladolid, 1559.\r\n\r\nCertain Indexes have been selected from the long series as on one\r\nground or another entitled to special attention. For these I have\r\ngiven, in addition to some analysis of the prefatory matter, the\r\naccompanying Bull and the regulations, and a specification of the\r\nmore important of the literature which is represented in the lists\r\nof the books condemned. Among the Indexes that call for such fuller\r\ndescription and analysis are the following: Louvain, 1546, (usually\r\nclassed as the first in the series of the Church Indexes); Rome, 1559,\r\n(the first in the series of papal Indexes); Trent, 1564, (the papal\r\nIndex which secured the widest and most continued influence); Rome,\r\n1607, (the only expurgatory Index in the papal series); Rome, 1664,\r\n(in which is presented the condemnation of Galileo); Rome, 1758, (the\r\nIndex which marked the beginning of the wider literary policy for the\r\nChurch); Rome, 1900, (the latest of the papal Indexes and the one which\r\nmust, therefore, be taken as expressing the present literary policy of\r\nRome). I have also given, with some detail, analyses of certain of the\r\nSpanish expurgatory Indexes, as these present a class of censorship\r\nquite distinct in character and not attempted outside of Spain.\r\n\r\nSeparate chapters are devoted to the treatment throughout the series\r\nof Indexes of certain subjects of continued importance, such as the\r\nrelations between the Church and State, the consideration given to\r\nErasmus and to Luther, the treatment of the monastic orders, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IX of the second volume, is presented a study of the\r\ninfluence of the Index upon the book-trade in the several States of\r\nEurope. While there are in existence no trustworthy statistics for such\r\na record, certain general results can be determined from the history\r\nof the printer-publishers and from the transfer of the centres of book\r\nproduction and distribution from the States which were under the direct\r\ncontrol of the Index regulations to territories in which the action of\r\ncensorship was less effective, or, as in Holland, non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe titles of the works utilised or cited as authorities from which\r\nquotations have been made will be found in the bibliography. I have\r\nthought it desirable, for the convenience of later students of the\r\nsubject, to include also in this bibliography the titles of certain\r\nother important works having to do with the subject of censorship, from\r\nwhich I did not have occasion or opportunity to make citations.\r\n\r\nI desire to express special acknowledgment to Dr. Mendham, whose\r\n_Literary Policy of the Church of Rome_ was published in London\r\nin 1834. The author made a thorough study of such of the Roman and\r\nSpanish Indexes as were within his reach, and he has been able to\r\nthrow no little light upon the methods adopted in Church censorship.\r\nHis vivacious treatise, which may be said fairly to bristle with\r\ncontroversial opinions and conclusions, constitutes a curious\r\nantithesis to the volumes of Reusch, who hardly permits himself to\r\nconnect with his comprehensive catalogues and records any opinions\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nFor matters connected with the Inquisition, the authorities are the\r\nwell-known _Histoire de l’Inquisition_ of Llorente, and the monumental\r\n_History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages_ by Henry C. Lea. The\r\nfirst volume of Lea’s _History of the Inquisition in Spain_ comes\r\ninto publication just as my own work is completed. For the history of\r\nthe operations of the Church in Spain, operations which were largely\r\nconducted under the authority of the Spanish Inquisition, I have,\r\nhowever, been able to utilise Lea’s _Religious History of Spain_, which\r\nfor this division of the subject-matter is the book most frequently\r\ncited. (In the Spanish chapters, in order to avoid the repetition of\r\nthe full title, the reference has been made simply to “Lea,” and is to\r\nbe understood as connected with the above volume.)\r\n\r\nFor matters connected with the book-trade and with the influence on\r\nthe work of the publishers of the regulations of the Index, the chief\r\ncitations are from Kapp’s _Geschichte des Deutschen Buchhandels_ and\r\nfrom Putnam’s _Books and their Makers in the Middle Ages_.\r\n\r\nThe leading authority for the modern Catholic view of the literary\r\npolicy of the Church is the treatise on the Index by the Jesuit Father\r\nHilgers, which was published in Freiburg as recently as 1905, and which\r\nis certainly a most forcible and effective example of controversial\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nA little volume by the Paulist Father Searle entitled _Plain Facts\r\nfor Fair Minds_, published in New York in 1895, is valuable for its\r\nstatement of the present policy of the Church in regard to the relation\r\nof faith with science and as to the rightful influence of the authority\r\nof the Church upon intellectual action.\r\n\r\nA treatise by Charles Dejob, a French Catholic, which came into\r\nprint in Paris in 1885, has been found interesting for its effective\r\npresentation of the Gallican point of view, both of the present date\r\nand of the earlier centuries, in regard to controversial matters.\r\n\r\nI have occasion to render a cordial personal acknowledgment to\r\nthe well-known scholar the Rev. Thomas J. Shahan, of the Catholic\r\nUniversity of America, for most friendly service and valuable\r\nsuggestions. I owe thanks also for friendly counsel received from the\r\nRev. A. A. Lambert, of the Paulist Fathers.\r\n\r\nWith the expectation that these volumes will be used chiefly for\r\npurposes of reference, it has seemed desirable to arrange the material\r\naccording to the cyclopaedia method, under certain main headings\r\nwith sub-headings for the special divisions of each subject.

During the centuries following, a number of similar edicts\r\nor mandates were published by councils, by individual ecclesiastics,\r\nand by civil officials acting at the instance of the authorities of\r\nthe Church, under which edicts the faithful were cautioned against the\r\npernicious influence of various works classed as heretical, and the\r\nheretics who had been concerned in the production and circulation of\r\nsuch writings were threatened with penalties ranging from confiscation\r\nof property to imprisonment, excommunication, and death. A schedule of\r\nthese decrees and edicts will be found in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in the methods of the production and distribution of\r\nliterature brought about by the invention of printing in the middle of\r\nthe 15th century, had, as an immediate result, an enormous increase\r\nin the influence upon the shaping of popular opinion of the written,\r\nor rather of the printed word, that is, of thought in the form of\r\nliterature. The work of the printers was at first welcomed by the\r\nrulers of the Church. They convinced themselves that the Lord had\r\nplaced at their disposal a valuable instrument for the spread of\r\nsound doctrine and for the enlightenment of believers, and with this\r\nconviction, they found funds for the support of a number of the early\r\nprinters and kept their presses employed in the production of works of\r\napproved theological instruction.\r\n\r\nIt was in fact not until nearly three fourths of a century after\r\nGutenberg, when the leaders of the Reformation were utilising the\r\nprinting-presses of Wittenberg for the spread of the Protestant\r\nheresies, that the ecclesiastics became aroused to the perils that the\r\nnew art was bringing upon the true faith and upon the authority of\r\nthe Church. If the people were to be protected against the insidious\r\ninfluence of the new heresies, it was absolutely essential that\r\nsome system should be instituted under which the productions of the\r\nprinting-press could be supervised and controlled. The more active and\r\nfar-reaching the operations of the printers, the greater the necessity\r\nfor the watchful supervision of their work, and the greater at the same\r\ntime the difficulty in making such supervision complete and effective.\r\nThe requirement was met by the institution of a system planned to\r\npermit no books to reach the public that had not been passed upon and\r\napproved by ecclesiastical examiners appointed for the purpose. To\r\nthis end, the production and the circulation of any literature not\r\nso approved were stamped as constituting a misdemeanour of the most\r\nserious character, one that might, under certain circumstances, become\r\nthe final sin against the light, the offence against the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nThe German historian Pütter says[1]:\r\n\r\n   “As a result of the great facility brought about in the\r\n   production of books by the invention of printing, there came\r\n   to be anxiety on the part of the authorities lest teachings\r\n   destructive of religion or morality, or inimical to the\r\n   interests of the State, should be given to the public. On this\r\n   ground, the conclusion was in all countries promptly arrived\r\n   at that no production should be permitted to come into print\r\n   that had not been passed upon and approved by an officially\r\n   instituted censorship, and that no printing-offices should\r\n   be established excepting under proper license and effective\r\n   supervision.”\r\n\r\nIn 1559, the responsibility for the censorship of literature was first\r\nassumed directly by the papal authority through the publication of\r\nthe _Index Auctorum et Librorum Prohibitorum_, of Paul IV, the\r\nfirst of a long series of papal Indexes, aggregating, up to 1899,\r\nforty-two in all. It does not appear to have been the intention either\r\nof Pope Paul IV or of his successors that the responsibility for the\r\nsystem of censorship should be retained under the exclusive direction\r\nof the papal authorities, and I find no record of objections having\r\nbeen raised to the publication of the Indexes prepared by such\r\nrepresentatives of the Church as the theological faculties of the\r\nUniversities of Louvain and of Paris, or by the Inquisition of Spain.\r\nThere were, however, very material differences between the lists as\r\nshaped in Rome of works condemned as heretical and the similar lists\r\nissued within the same period in Louvain, Paris, or Valladolid; books\r\nof undoubted heresy included in one Index would fail to find place in\r\nanother, and it is difficult to arrive at any consistently followed\r\nprinciple or policy by which the selections of the different compilers\r\nwere determined.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any definite instruction to the contrary, it\r\nmight at first be assumed from the wording of the prohibitions that\r\nany and all of the Indexes, published under the direction of such\r\necclesiastical authorities as those specified, must have been intended\r\nto be equally binding on all the faithful, irrespective of political or\r\necclesiastical boundaries. We know, however, as a matter of history,\r\nthat, in the majority of cases, no attempt was made to enforce the\r\nprohibitions of the Index outside of the territory of the State in\r\nwhich it had been promulgated.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to secure any trustworthy information as to the\r\nprecise range of the effectiveness of these prohibitions, but it seems\r\nprobable that the Roman Indexes were held to be in force outside of the\r\nimmediate territory of the Church only after they had been formally\r\naccepted and promulgated by the authorities, ecclesiastical and\r\npolitical, of the individual States, such as Spain, France, the Empire,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe Index of 1559 was, as stated, the first of the series of papal\r\nIndexes; but as early as 1542, the Inquisition of Rome had promulgated\r\na special edict prescribing penalties for the reading of heretical or\r\nof doubtful books, and in 1545 was published the first Italian list of\r\nprohibited books and authors. In 1571, under Pope Pius V, the task of\r\ncompiling the papal Indexes was confided to a body organised under the\r\nname of the Congregation of the Index, which is still (1906) carrying\r\non its work.\r\n\r\nThe work of the framers of these Roman Indexes exercised an important\r\ninfluence even in the States in which the papal prohibitions had not\r\nbeen officially published, as the titles collected for them were\r\nlargely utilised by the makers of the Indexes of Spain, France, and\r\nBelgium; and in like manner, the material put into print in Louvain,\r\nParis, and Valladolid formed the basis of certain of the Roman lists.\r\n\r\nA more authoritative position in regard to the work of censorship was\r\ntaken by the Papacy through the publication, in 1564, of the Tridentine\r\nIndex. This Index, as well through its formulation of the rules for\r\ncensorship, as because of the greater comprehensiveness of its lists,\r\nconstituted the most authoritative guide that had yet been issued.\r\nThe Tridentine Index was promulgated, under the authority of pope and\r\nof council, throughout all the Catholic States and also in countries\r\nin which the Catholic Church, while no longer the ruling power, still\r\npossessed followers. It was printed in a long series of editions\r\nissued from all the more important publishing centres of Europe; its\r\nlists formed the basis of all subsequent Indexes, while its rules were\r\naccepted as the guide for future censors and compilers. After the\r\nCouncil of Trent, a wider and more assured recognition was given by\r\nchurchmen throughout the Catholic world (from which must, curiously\r\nenough, be excepted Catholic Spain) to the authority of the Papacy,\r\nacting through the Congregation of the Index, to retain the general\r\ndirection and control of the business of censorship.\r\n\r\nIn 1758, two centuries after the publication of the Tridentine\r\nIndex, was issued the Index of Benedict XIV, the lists in which\r\nrepresented better bibliographical work than had previously been\r\nattempted, and which was particularly important as representing what\r\nmay be called the last attempt of the Papacy to maintain any general\r\ncensorship of the world’s literature. The series of papal Indexes from\r\ntime to time has been continued, the latest bearing date 1899; but the\r\ncompilers of these later Indexes content themselves with repeating\r\nthe general rules or principles by which the reading of the faithful\r\nshould be guided, while the lists of current publications are limited\r\nalmost exclusively to works by Catholic writers, and chiefly to works\r\nof a doctrinal character, the teachings of which are found to be in\r\none respect or another open to condemnation. The proportion of books\r\nabsolutely prohibited becomes smaller, the greater number of the\r\nworks cited being placed in the lists of _libros expurgandos_,\r\nthe reading of which is forbidden only until certain corrections or\r\neliminations have been made, _donec corrigatur_. The Index of 1884\r\nand that of 1899 bring forward from the more important of the preceding\r\npapal Indexes the titles of the most noteworthy of the works condemned\r\nin these. No attempt, however, is made to condemn (except under general\r\nrules and principles) the increasing lists of modern Protestant\r\ndoctrinal books, or to characterise or differentiate the great mass of\r\nthe world’s literature. The printing-press had outgrown the machinery\r\nof ecclesiastical censorship.\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries in which the censorship of the Church was active\r\nand comprehensive, it must have exerted a very material influence\r\nover the relations of authors with their public; the effectiveness of\r\nliterature as an intellectual force in directing or shaping public\r\nopinion was assuredly not a little hampered and restricted, while the\r\nvalue of literary productions as property was seriously lessened and,\r\nin certain territories, entirely destroyed. It is evident that if\r\nthe production, the sale, and the possession of copies of a book are\r\nprohibited, the work can possess no property value within the territory\r\nthroughout which such prohibition can be enforced. Its possibilities\r\nas property are either cancelled altogether, in case the prohibition\r\ncan be made effective throughout the entire possible market, or are\r\nlessened in the proportion in which such market has been curtailed.\r\nIn fact, in the cases in which, under the more extreme penalties of\r\na censorship system, the purchase or the possession of a copy of\r\na condemned work involved fine, imprisonment, or excommunication,\r\nthe work might be said to possess a negative in place of a positive\r\ncommercial value. The author, and others interested with the author,\r\nin securing a circulation for the book, might even be imagined as\r\noffering, if not a bonus, something in the nature of a guaranty against\r\nrisks, to those who would co-operate with them in the dangerous task of\r\ndistributing copies.\r\n\r\nThe other obstacles that have been noted as standing in the way of the\r\ndevelopment of literary property had been negative in their character.\r\nThe lack of realisation on the part of the literary worker himself\r\nthat he was producing anything entitled to be classed as property;\r\nthe difficulty on the part of the reading public in arriving at the\r\nconception that there could be property in anything not material,\r\nin such an abstract entity as a right; the physical impossibility,\r\nin advance of the invention of printing, of the multiplication of\r\ncopies of a literary production by any method that should preserve\r\nfor the author any control over the text of each copy, or any share\r\nin the selling price of the same; the limitations of the territory\r\nwithin which, after the era of printed books had begun, and after the\r\ndevelopment of public opinion had brought a community to the point of\r\nrecognising the property rights of one of its own literary workers,\r\nsuch recognition could be made effective; the fragmentary character and\r\nnecessary inadequacy of the system of local privileges; and finally the\r\nlack, during a long series of years after the invention of printing, of\r\nany adequate publishing machinery for making known to possible buyers\r\nthe existence of books, for distributing the copies, and for collecting\r\nthe amounts paid by the purchasers;--all these obstacles operated\r\nagainst the possibility of securing for producers of literature such\r\nprotection under the law and such recognition for the results of their\r\nlabours as had, in all organised communities, been for centuries\r\nassured for other classes of producers.\r\n\r\nAgainst such obstacles and difficulties, the recognition of literary\r\nproductions as property and the actual commercial value of the labour\r\nof literary workers had, through the first century of printing been\r\nmaking an assured, though fitful and interrupted, progress. Early in\r\nthe 16th century, however, the rulers of the State and the authorities\r\nof the Church began to find occasion for alarm at the increasing range\r\nof influence of the printed word, and came to the conclusion that if\r\nthe community was not to be undermined by heretical, dangerous, and\r\ndemoralising opinions, measures must be taken to maintain supervision\r\nand control over the production of books.\r\n\r\nThe interference on the part of the political rulers was fitful and\r\nintermittent, and appears at no time to have arrived at the dignity\r\nof a continued policy or system. In a number of States, while the\r\nrulers continued to claim for themselves the exclusive control of\r\nthe printing-press (as was, for instance, the case with Spain,\r\nFrance, and the Holy Roman Empire), they were willing to confide to\r\nthe ecclesiastics the selection of the books to be condemned and\r\nprohibited. The actual work of censorship, at least in the countries\r\nwhich remained Catholic, fell, therefore, more and more into the hands\r\nof the Church, and was, as a result, carried on with reference to\r\nthe clerical standard of orthodoxy and morality, and to the clerical\r\ntheories of what was required for the welfare of the community.\r\n\r\nIn the series of the Indexes, the proportion of works of a purely\r\npolitical character was small as compared with the long lists of books\r\nwhich had been condemned on doctrinal grounds. It is in order, however,\r\nto bear in mind, as a limitation of this statement, that during the\r\ntwo centuries in which censorship was the most active and exerted the\r\nlargest influence upon intellectual development, say from 1550 to 1750,\r\nthe minds of men were directed more largely to doctrinal questions\r\nthan to political matters. It was not the State but the Church whose\r\nauthority and existence had been assailed and the contest was fought\r\nout over creeds and not political platforms.\r\n\r\nWhen, with the outbreak of the Reformation movement, it became apparent\r\nhow great a range of influence was possessed by the printed sheet, the\r\nproblem which confronted the authorities of the Church was certainly\r\nserious in more ways than one. For the space of fifteen centuries, the\r\neducation of the people had remained almost exclusively under the\r\ndirection of the Church. The faithful believers (and the unbelievers\r\nwere but few) had accepted their entire intellectual sustenance at\r\nthe hands of the priests. The instruction given in the parish schools\r\ninstituted by the Church was almost entirely oral, although some use\r\nwas made of written alphabet tables and of written psalters with the\r\nmusical notations.\r\n\r\nThe instruction for those who took up higher branches of study,\r\nstudents who were for the greater part destined for the Church, was\r\nnaturally, during the manuscript period, carried on by the priests, not\r\nonly because but few others possessed anything that could be called\r\nscholarship, but also because it was only in the collections of the\r\nmonasteries (the _armaria_) that the requisite manuscripts could\r\nbe found. It is true that with the beginning of the 13th century, the\r\neducational work of the earlier universities, such as Bologna, Paris,\r\nand Oxford, begins to assume importance; but even in the universities,\r\noutside of the faculties of law and of medicine, the direction of the\r\ninstruction was retained very largely in the hands of the Church, the\r\nlecturers in the department of philosophy, for instance, being almost\r\nexclusively ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nDuring the 13th century, there does come into existence a body of\r\nscholarship which is outside of the Church, but it remains the case\r\nthat, up to the time of Luther, the great mass of the people had looked\r\nto Rome, and to teachers acting under the authority of Rome, for its\r\nlight and leading, intellectual as well as religious. The association\r\nof education and intellectual training with the Church is in fact\r\nfairly indicated by the use of the term “cleric.”\r\n\r\nIn 1516, the leaders of the Reformation, in beginning their long\r\ncontest against the abuses of the Church of Rome, a contest which\r\nsoon developed into a fight for the complete overthrow of the\r\npapal supremacy, promptly availed themselves of the power of the\r\nprinting-press. While the words spoken in the pulpit or in the\r\nmarket-place could reach at best but a few hundred of hearers the\r\ntracts poured forth from the Wittenberg presses, the “flying-leaves”\r\n(_Flüg-schriften_), carried the teachings of Luther and Melanchthon\r\nto many thousands, and it was through the influence of these “winged\r\nwords” (_epea pteroenta_) that the revolt developed into a revolution.\r\n\r\nTo the devout adherents of the Church of Rome, and particularly to\r\nthose to whom had been given the responsibility for its government\r\nand for the spiritual guidance of its members, the situation, not\r\nonly during these earlier years of fierce strife against Protestant\r\nheresies, but throughout the succeeding centuries, presented the\r\ngravest difficulties. There is something almost pathetic in the long\r\nseries of attempts made by popes, councils, bishops, congregations, and\r\ninquisitors to protect the souls of the faithful against the baneful\r\ninfluence of the ever-increasing tide of literature that was pouring\r\nforth from the various publishing centres, and so much of which was\r\ncalculated to lead men astray from the true doctrines and to bring them\r\ninto risk of everlasting perdition. To ecclesiastical rulers, honestly\r\nholding such a conviction, there was, of course, but one duty. They\r\nmust use every means in their power to suppress the heresies, and to\r\nwarn and protect their flocks. What were the fortunes or even the lives\r\nof a few evil-minded or devil-inspired printers and writers as compared\r\nwith the eternal hopes of the great masses of men? Nay! It was better\r\nthat the misguided reader himself should, by prompt and, if necessary,\r\nextreme penalties, lose all that he had in this world, rather than that\r\nhe should be permitted, in continuing to absorb heresy and in spreading\r\nits leprosy abroad, not only to sacrifice his own soul, but also to\r\nundermine the faith of his fellow-men.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Church was, therefore, not only logical and\r\nreasonable; it was the only course that was possible for an\r\norganisation to which, as its rulers undoubtedly believed, the\r\nAlmighty had confided the care of the spiritual welfare of mankind.\r\nThe safety of the soul depended upon the nature of the intellectual\r\nsustenance taken in, whether through the ears or through the eyes. All\r\nliterature or instruction in any form, spoken, written, or printed,\r\nmust, therefore, before reaching the understanding, be sifted under\r\nthe authority of an all-wise and infallible Church. The believer must\r\nbe protected against harm, the doubter must be recalled to the true\r\npath, and the heresies and the heretics must alike be exterminated.\r\nWhile it was only after the active propaganda work of the Reformers\r\nof Wittenberg had made clear the perils of the printing-press that\r\nany general system of censorship was attempted, there had been, as\r\npointed out, instances of prohibited books centuries before the time of\r\nGutenberg. An heretical utterance in manuscript form was a restricted\r\nor manageable evil, in that its influence was limited to the small\r\ncircle of clerics and could not, at least directly, reach the masses.\r\nIt was, however, none the less an evil which it was the duty of the\r\nChurch to condemn and to repress.\r\n\r\nThe record of the Index is also to be considered as an important\r\ncontribution to the history of literature. Thomas James, whose treatise\r\non the _Index Generalis Librorum Prohibitorum_ was printed\r\nat Oxford in 1627, says in his preface that his book is addressed\r\nparticularly to the curators of the Bodleian Library to whom it should\r\nserve as a guide concerning the works which it was particularly\r\ndesirable to collect and to preserve; only the curators must be sure to\r\nsecure the earlier and, therefore, unexpurgated editions. Bishop Barlow\r\nwrites that he has found the\r\n\r\n   “_Indices Expurgatorii_ invaluable as records of the literature\r\n   of the doctrines and opinions obnoxious to Rome.... Their\r\n   _Indices Expurgatorii_ are very good common-place books and\r\n   repertories (for that use we make of them) by help of which we\r\n   may presently find what any author by them censured has uttered\r\n   against the vulnerable parts of the Catholic system. In these\r\n   _Indices_ we are directed to the book, chapter, and line where\r\n   anything is spoken against any superstition or error of Rome; so\r\n   that he who has the _Indices_ cannot want testimonies against\r\n   Rome.”[2]\r\n\r\nReusch points out that the Indexes have preserved the record and\r\nthe purport of not a few works of interest and importance, the very\r\nexistence of which would otherwise have been lost sight of. It is also\r\nthe case that the Index lists have preserved the titles of a number of\r\nworks of comparatively trivial importance, which, if they had not been\r\nfortunate enough to secure the condemnation of the Church, would have\r\nfallen still-born from the press.\r\n\r\nIt was the practice, in making condemnation of books either through\r\na general Index or under a separate decree, to order destroyed\r\nsuch copies of the condemned books as could be collected, and this\r\ndestruction was, as a rule, done by fire. In the record of censorship,\r\nthere are, however, a number of instances of books which had received\r\nthe honour of a special condemnation for burning, the titles of which\r\nhad not appeared in any Index issued by the Church or in any separate\r\npapal or diocesan decree. The books so recorded were, with hardly\r\nan exception, condemned under civil authority. The writers who have\r\nbrought together records of books condemned to be burned (of whom\r\nPeignot is perhaps the most important) give, under the same general\r\nheading, titles of books selected from the Index, books condemned\r\nunder special decrees of the Church, and works which had fallen under\r\nthe censorship of the civil authorities. As will be noticed in the\r\nlater chapters, the special emphasis given to the importance of a book\r\nthrough the burning of copies in a public place, constituted a valuable\r\nadvertisement and usually extended its influence.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Index may be divided into two main periods. The\r\nfirst begins, as far as the papal censorship is concerned, in 1559,\r\nwith the publication of the _Index Auctorum et Librorum_, prepared\r\nunder the instructions of Paul IV, and closes with the end of the\r\n16th century, with the issue of the final appendices to the Index of\r\nthe Council of Trent. During this period, the chief and almost the\r\nonly subject-matters considered are the great questions raised by the\r\nReformation. In the second period, which closes with the Index of\r\nBenedict XIV, issued in 1758, the controversies turn, as indicated by\r\nthe character of the works placed on the lists, on issues of doctrine,\r\nopinion, and conduct arising within the Church itself. The writers\r\nwhose works are condemned during this period are for the most part\r\necclesiastics of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe work done during the 19th century by the Congregation of the Index\r\nmay be said to belong to a third or modern period, in which, as\r\nwill be noted later, the censorship over literature and the literary\r\ninstruction for the faithful has for the most part taken the form\r\nof statements of general principles in place of detailed lists of\r\npernicious books. The attempt to characterise the mass of the world’s\r\nliterature has been abandoned and the comparatively few titles named\r\nare (with a few curious exceptions) those of doctrinal works emanating\r\nfrom within the Church itself and the errors in which are, therefore,\r\nlikely to mislead believers.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind further in connection with the general\r\ndivision of periods suggested by Reusch, that while the greater portion\r\nof the work of the Index was carried on under the direct supervision of\r\nthe popes, a long series of Indexes were issued by authorities acting\r\nindependently of the Papacy, such as the Inquisition of Spain, the\r\ntheological faculty of the University of Paris, the theological faculty\r\nof the University of Louvain, and other bodies.\r\n\r\nThe first Index, in point of date, of the long series, was in fact\r\nissued not in Rome but in Paris, the second and third in Louvain,\r\nthe fourth in Valladolid, etc. The several dates will be given in\r\nthe schedules presented later. It is also noteworthy that, while the\r\npapal Indexes were of course in form binding on the entire Church and\r\nthroughout all the States classed as Catholic, they were not actually\r\nput into force in the several States unless or until they had been\r\naccepted and confirmed by the respective rulers; and, as a fact, a\r\nnumber of the papal Indexes were never so accepted either in France\r\nor in Spain. The Church of Spain, acting through the Inquisition,\r\nundertook to carry on an independent system of literary censorship and\r\nof literary repression. The inquisitors condemned a number of works\r\nwhich do not appear in the Roman lists, and declined to condemn not\r\na few books which had in Rome been classed as pernicious. A similar\r\ncourse was taken by the Gallican Church, whose censorship was carried\r\non by commissions of ecclesiastics acting under the direct authority of\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\nA necessary result of the condemnation of books by a number of\r\nauthorities was a large measure of confusion in regard to the status\r\nof a number of books and of not a few authors. A faithful believer,\r\nwho was fully prepared to accept in regard to literature the guidance\r\nof the authorities, may well have had cause for perplexity in finding\r\ncondemned and prohibited by one pope the works of an author whose\r\nwritings had received the special commendation of another, or in\r\nbeing prohibited in Madrid from reading books which were permitted or\r\neven recommended in Rome. In not a few instances, Indexes which had\r\nbeen issued in regular course with the papal sanction were themselves\r\nprohibited from being printed or promulgated in Spain, in France, in\r\nGermany, or even in places as near to the papal seat as Venice.\r\n\r\nDuring the period before the Council of Trent, the work of the\r\ncompilers of the Roman Indexes was chiefly based upon the Indexes\r\nwhich had originated in Spain or in the Netherlands, while there is,\r\nas said, occasionally ground for perplexity at the absence from the\r\nRoman lists of works of undoubted heresy which had been duly condemned\r\nby the censors of Valladolid or Louvain. It is not easy to understand\r\nwhy the Papacy, having recognised the necessity for the exercise of\r\ncontrol over literary production, and over the operations of the\r\nprinting-press, should have permitted the system of Indexes to be\r\ninitiated anywhere but in Rome, and should have further permitted,\r\napparently without reprimand or protest, so large a proportion of the\r\nlong series of Indexes to be compiled and published by ecclesiastics\r\nwho, while claiming to be defending the true faith and to be carrying\r\nout the policy of the Church, were not acting under the direct\r\nsupervision or authority of Rome. Independent action in such an\r\nall-important matter as the direction of public opinion as expressed\r\nthrough printed literature might have been considered a dangerous\r\nprecedent and undoubtedly did constitute an important factor in\r\nstrengthening the separate authority of the State churches of Spain and\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nJoseph Mendham finds in the Indexes the literary policy and the\r\ndoctrinal policy of the Church of Rome. He writes:\r\n\r\n   “The Indexes issued by the Church of Rome may be regarded\r\n   as a grand Index of the sentiment, spirit, and policy of an\r\n   ecclesiastical empire, claiming with the most critical exactness\r\n   the terrific appellation of the Mystery of Iniquity.\r\n\r\n   “To no power but modern Rome is equally applicable the encomium\r\n   of the poet on the ancient:\r\n\r\n    _Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;\r\n    Hae tibi erunt artes; passisque imponere morem:\r\n    Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos._\r\n\r\n                                      Aen. VI, 852.\r\n\r\n   “The other class of Indexes, the expurgatory, contains a\r\n   particular examination of the works specified and indicates\r\n   the passages condemned to be expunged or altered. For these\r\n   Expurgatory Indexes, publicity was so little desired that it\r\n   was the chief thing guarded against.... The copies were intended\r\n   for the possession and inspection only of those to whom they\r\n   were necessary for the execution of their provisions.... It was\r\n   not thought desirable that the dishonest dealings of the writers\r\n   of these censures should be known either to the authors who were\r\n   injured and who would thus have an opportunity of justifying\r\n   themselves, or to readers whose judgment must in many instances\r\n   be at variance with that of the censors.”[3]\r\n\r\nThe framers of the several expurgatory Indexes found themselves\r\noccasionally under the necessity of censuring and correcting the works\r\nof writers accepted as the Fathers of the Church. Mendham gives an\r\nexample, from the Roman Index of Brasichelli, of a condemnation of\r\ncertain propositions printed by Robert Estienne, which propositions\r\nare, he says, direct citations from the Fathers. Mornay, in his edition\r\nof the Spanish Index of 1601, presents a list of similar condemnations\r\nor expurgations of the texts of the writings of the Fathers themselves.\r\nThe propositions which, naturally enough, came under this condemnation\r\nare those which appear to present grounds for the doctrine of\r\njustification by faith and those which enforce the importance of the\r\ninjunction against the worship of images. The Jesuit Gretser, in\r\napologising for the action of the Church in the case of Bertram’s book,\r\nmakes the following interesting argument:\r\n\r\n   “Although Bertram be prohibited, I deny that a Father is\r\n   prohibited, for that one can properly be called a Father of\r\n   the Church who feeds and nourishes to the faithful salutary\r\n   doctrine, who being placed over the family of the Lord, gives it\r\n   in due season its portion of the corn. If, therefore, instead\r\n   of the food of salutary doctrine and the portion of corn, he\r\n   offered and distributed cockles and tares and the burrs and\r\n   briars of perverse doctrines, so far from being a Father he is\r\n   but a stepfather, not a doctor but a seductor.”[4]\r\n\r\nIn another page, Gretser writes: “Who, therefore, is so stupid as not\r\nto recognise that the Church or the sovereign pontiff, while he reviews\r\nthe lucubrations of his sons, and wherein he corrects these, performs a\r\nservice grateful to the authors and a work useful to posterity.”[5]\r\n\r\nIt is a natural inference from the assumption by the Church of the\r\nresponsibility of indicating in the Index lists the books which are\r\non one ground or another pernicious and which require important\r\ncorrections, that the further responsibility is assumed of approving\r\nby implication the books not thus condemned or not corrected through\r\nexpurgation. While it is the case that the Church has never admitted\r\nthis responsibility, the contention is one which has often been raised\r\nand which does not appear to have been answered. If the books that\r\nare not condemned by the Index are considered as having been approved\r\nor even sanctioned by the Church, it would follow that the authority\r\nin the Church from which the Indexes emanate could be understood to\r\napprove and to sanction those doctrines or assertions from the writers\r\nwithin the fold of the Church which these condemning decrees have\r\nfailed to proscribe or to expurgate. Such a contention does not appear,\r\nhowever, to be really well founded when we bear in mind the necessary\r\nlimitations, even in the earlier years of the work of the Index, of the\r\nfacilities possessed by the examiners in passing upon publications\r\noriginating in various countries and not always even printed in the\r\ncommon ecclesiastical language. The criticism presents, however, one of\r\nthe most serious difficulties attending the assumption by the Church\r\nof this responsibility for the control of literary productions, even\r\nthough this control be limited to the writings of members of the Church\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe Indexes were certainly utilised, and were intended to be utilised,\r\nas instruments for the suppression of heresy and for the maintenance\r\nof true doctrine as interpreted by the rulers of the Church. The\r\nchaplain of Philip II of Spain (Alphonso de Castro) has declared that\r\nin his opinion the purification of Spain from heretics was due to the\r\nfact that in Spain and in Spain alone the prohibition of heretical\r\nliterature was effectively enforced. The continued prevalence of\r\nheresies in other countries, even in such Catholic States as France,\r\nItaly, and South Germany, was, in the opinion of Castro, due to the\r\nlack of effectiveness in enforcing the purification of literature.[6]\r\nIt is the inference of Mendham that the effect referred to by Castro\r\nwas due not to the simple prohibitions of the Index but to the\r\nenforcing of these prohibitions under the thorough-going methods of\r\nthe Inquisition. Cardinal Pallavicino has assigned the preservation\r\nof Italy from the infection of presumed heresy to the activity of the\r\nInquisition and particularly to the work done both by the Inquisition\r\nand the Index of the Congregation in suppressing heretical literature.\r\nHe speaks as if there had been serious risk, in the absence of\r\npersistent efforts of this kind, that Italy itself might embrace the\r\nReformation.[7]\r\n\r\nMendham, who writes always as a bitter controversialist, is of opinion\r\nthat the expurgatory Indexes, and the expurgatory work done quietly\r\nwithout the use of Indexes, were utilised so as to modify in the later\r\neditions the text of the writings of the Fathers and of the earlier\r\nauthorities of the Church, in the respects in which this text did not\r\nappear to give consistent support to the accepted doctrine of the\r\nlater Church, or in which words were used by the authors which could\r\nbe interpreted and which had been interpreted in support of heresies.\r\nIt is not practicable, without a careful textual comparison of the\r\n“orthodox” and approved editions of the Fathers with the editions of\r\nearlier date and with those which the Church censors found occasion to\r\ncondemn, to say how far there may be any foundation for this severe\r\narraignment. Mendham goes on to suggest that it had been the hope of\r\nthe Church gradually to replace the former and original editions of\r\nbooks of this class with the editions approved by the Church.\r\n\r\n   “In this way, the mouth of antiquity should be thoroughly shut\r\n   up and prevented from uttering any syllable or sound against\r\n   the doctrines of the later Church.... By the addition of words\r\n   where opportunity and pretence might serve, and by drawing the\r\n   marginal notes and glosses of their friars into the texts of\r\n   the Fathers (as has already been handsomely begun with certain\r\n   texts) the mouth of antiquity should also be opened for them\r\n   (the present leaders of the Church). There remained then only\r\n   the rectifying of St. Paul and of the other scriptural writers\r\n   whose authority being already set beneath that of the Church,\r\n   it were not such great matter to submit it also to her gentle\r\n   and moderate censures; especially for so good an intent as the\r\n   weeding out of heresies and the preserving of the faith Catholic\r\n   in her purity and glory.”[8]\r\n\r\nPanzer makes reference[9] to an Index printed in Louvain as early as\r\n1510. The title is recorded as follows:\r\n\r\n_Die Cathlogen of inventargen van den Quaden verboden bouken: na\r\nadvis der Universiteyt van Louen. Met een edict of Mandement der\r\nKeyserlicken Majesteyt. Te Louen geprint bej Sewaes van Sassen.\r\nMCCCCCX. 4^o._\r\n\r\nNo copy of an Index of this date was known (1897) in the British\r\nMuseum, and it is not referred to by Reusch. Knapp, in his scheme for a\r\nHistory of the Index, is in accord with Reusch in making that of Paris\r\nof 1544 the earliest. It seems probable that Panzer has been misled as\r\nto the date of the Flemish Index.\r\n\r\nThe series of Indexes is understood, therefore, to begin with the\r\nmiddle of the 16th century (that is, a century after the invention\r\nof printing), but from the earliest years of the organised Church,\r\nattempts had been made from time to time to protect the faithful\r\nagainst the pernicious influence of heretical writings, by the\r\ndestruction of the copies and by the punishment of the writers when\r\nthese were within reach of the strong arm of the Church and when they\r\nrefused to be convinced of their errors.\r\n\r\nA number of the editions of the Roman Indexes, as for instance that of\r\n1819, bear as their motto: “Many of them also which used curious arts\r\nbrought their books together, and burned them before all men” (Acts\r\nxix, 19); while on others was printed a head-piece engraved on copper,\r\nrepresenting the believers burning their books of magic. The example,\r\nhowever, of these early converts, under the influence of the eloquence\r\nof Paul, bringing of their own free will, to be destroyed, books the\r\nteachings of which were believed to be incompatible with the doctrines\r\nof Christianity, does not constitute a fairly logical precedent for the\r\nlater practice of the Church in punishing by excommunication and in\r\nother ways those who continued to read books condemned as heretical.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages, there are a number of examples of\r\nprohibitions, emanating from various authorities, and applying\r\nsometimes to single books or individual authors, and sometimes to\r\ngroups. It is not likely that during the manuscript period, the\r\nduplication or reading of the books denounced was seriously affected,\r\nexcept in the immediate locality in which the prohibition was issued.\r\nThese earlier attempts at censorship possess interest chiefly as\r\nindications of the ecclesiastical policy and of the varying standards\r\nof different periods and of different places, and also because the\r\ntitles of the works selected for condemnation were in part utilised by\r\nthe compilers of the Indexes.\r\n\r\nA “Directory” of heresy was prepared early in the 16th century\r\nby Nicholas Eymeric of Cologne, under the title of _Directorium\r\nInquisitorium_. This was reprinted in Venice in 1607, _cum commentariis\r\nFrancisci Pegnae_. This Directory was, says Reusch, utilised by Bernard\r\nLutzenburg as the basis for his _Catalogus Haereticorum_,--Catalogue\r\nof Heretics,--first issued in 1522. In these two lists have been\r\npreserved the names of a number of persons classed as heretics, of\r\nwhose books there is no record, and who may possibly even never have\r\nwritten anything, or at least never have brought anything into print.\r\nThe Lutzenburg Catalogue was utilised in the compilation of the Index\r\nof Paul IV.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the 13th century, the papal condemnations of\r\nspecific books frequently included the specification of names of the\r\nexaminer or examiners, usually one or more of the cardinals. We have\r\nhere the beginnings of the body that became later the Congregation of\r\nthe Index.\r\n\r\nIn 1256, in a Bull issued by Alexander IV against a tractate of William\r\nof Saint-Amour, of Paris, the Pope says that his action is based upon\r\nthe report of four cardinals, to whom had been confided the task of\r\nexamining the work. All copies are ordered to be burnt within eight\r\ndays, under penalty of excommunication. Saint-Amour’s essay presents a\r\nvery unfavourable picture of the condition of the Church of the times,\r\nand is especially sharp in its strictures upon the newly instituted\r\nmendicant orders. After the beginning of the series of official\r\nIndexes, the list of works concerning which the judgment of the\r\nChurch was reversed under the authority of the different popes, or of\r\nsuccessive councils, becomes considerable, and may easily have proved a\r\nperplexity to faithful believers who were prepared to accept as a final\r\nguide the infallible authority of the Church.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the 12th century, there appear to have been no\r\nattempts on the part of the Church to restrict the reading of the\r\nScriptures, or the distribution of the manuscript copies of the\r\nScriptural books. During the 13th century, several of the synods held\r\nin France issued prohibitions of the use or circulation of versions in\r\nthe vernacular of the Scriptural books, with the exception only of the\r\nPsalms. A similar prohibition was enacted for popular versions of any\r\ndoctrinal or theological writings. The Church was gradually developing\r\nthe procedure, finally formulated as a general policy, under which\r\nlaymen were to be forbidden reading either the Scriptures or works of\r\ndoctrine except under the immediate direction of the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 1239 and 1320, a series of orders were issued by\r\nsuccessive popes, beginning with Gregory IX, for the destruction of\r\ncopies of the _Talmud_.[10] In the first portion of the 16th century,\r\na more tolerant view was taken by the papal authorities in regard to\r\nthe preservation of the literature and the learning of the Hebrews; but\r\nJulius III and his immediate successors again ordered the destruction\r\nof the _Talmud_. The work is also included in the first of the official\r\nIndexes, that of Paul IV. In the Tridentine Index, the previous\r\nprohibitions are relaxed, but under Clement VIII the _Talmud_ was once\r\nmore condemned.\r\n\r\nThe whole business of the supervision of literature and the control of\r\nopinion was of necessity very materially modified by the invention of\r\nprinting. It was at first assumed that the control of literature by\r\nthe Church would be strengthened by the new method of book production.\r\nThe ecclesiastical authorities decided that no books should be printed\r\nexcepting under their own supervision, and if there had been any\r\neffective means of carrying out such a decision, the printing-press\r\nwould speedily have become a mere means of expression of Church\r\ndoctrine and Church policy.\r\n\r\nThe multiplying of the printing-presses and the development of\r\nmachinery for the distribution of the copies of the printed books,\r\ntogether with the rapid increase in the public demand for such books,\r\nspeedily, however, rendered impracticable the effort on the part of\r\nthe Church to retain the control of book production.\r\n\r\nThe Louvain Index of 1546 was, as will be noticed in the later summary\r\nof the Indexes, followed by several Spanish Indexes which were for the\r\nmost part compiled and issued under the direction of the Inquisition,\r\nand during the succeeding centuries, the general control of the\r\ncensorship throughout the dominions of Spain remained in the hands\r\nof the Inquisition. There was, in such an arrangement, one manifest\r\nadvantage; the authority that determined the offence was the same as\r\nthat which put into force the penalties that had been prescribed. As a\r\nresult of this identity between the power that judged and condemned,\r\nand the power that carried the condemnation into effect, the censorship\r\nwas effective throughout Spanish dominions to an extent which was never\r\nreached under any censorship machinery that was put into force in other\r\nStates. A book that was condemned in Spain did actually pass out of\r\nexistence, as far, at least, as Spanish territory was concerned, and a\r\nsimilar fate occasionally befell the author. The copies that had been\r\nprinted were destroyed, and the printing or circulation of further\r\ncopies was too perilous an undertaking to be ventured upon.\r\n\r\nIf the Inquisition had been in a position to carry on throughout\r\nEurope, or even throughout the Catholic States, a censorship as\r\neffective as that put into force in Spain, the extermination of books\r\nwould have been so considerable that there would have been brought\r\nabout a serious break between the literatures of the centuries.\r\n\r\nIn France, the censorship was exercised in a more fitful and less\r\nconsistent manner. The Indexes originating in France were for the most\r\npart compiled, under the authority of the Crown, by the theologians of\r\nthe Sorbonne. Books were, however, from time to time condemned under\r\nthe direct supervision of the royal chancellor.\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind also that a refusal on the part of the\r\nchancellor to issue a royal privilege for a book served to prevent its\r\npublication, at least in France (the edition must as a rule have been\r\nprinted before the examination of copies by the royal censors could be\r\nmade), and was, therefore, practically identical with a prohibition.\r\nThe title of such an unprivileged and therefore unpublished work would\r\nas a rule not find its way into the lists of the French Index. The\r\nextent of the repression or restriction of literary activity can,\r\ntherefore, not be fully measured by the number of titles on the lists\r\nof works prohibited.\r\n\r\nIt was unquestionably the case that the censorship had a very material\r\ninfluence in discouraging the production of literature, an influence\r\nthat might be classed as an indirect damage to the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the community. While the fact of such interference\r\nin a country like Spain in which the provisions of the censorship\r\nwere, under the Inquisition, enforced with strictness and often with\r\nseverity, is fully established, there can of course be no data for\r\nascertaining the extent of the loss.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that if an instructor in one of the Spanish\r\nuniversities got into trouble with the Inquisition in bringing into\r\nprint a series of lectures, he would, in the majority of cases, have\r\nkept his later studies or conclusions in the safer form of manuscript.\r\nIt is probable also that his associates on the faculty, or the students\r\nwho had followed his work, would in great part be deterred from\r\npressing their studies to a logical conclusion. Not only would the\r\nbooks not be printed or even completed, but the lectures themselves,\r\non subjects that had once been stamped by the Church as pernicious,\r\nwould be stopped. The Inquisition was in a position to put an end to\r\nany courses of study or lines of investigation that it found reason to\r\ndisapprove, and the record shows that it did not neglect the exercise\r\nof its authority to such end.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if the business of a printer-publisher had been broken\r\nup or seriously hampered through penalties imposed for the crime of\r\ncirculating literature found deserving of condemnation, it is very\r\ncertain that such dealer, if continuing in business at all, would have\r\nreason to avoid taking in the future any such undesirable risks, and\r\nhis competitors in the book-trade would wish to be equally conservative\r\nin the selection or acceptance of books for their own presses.\r\n\r\nApart even from the cases of books which had been condemned as\r\nheretical, and which had involved in their condemnation the authors,\r\nthe printers, and the booksellers, the whole system of censorship\r\nconstituted with its delays, its interference, and its fees or charges,\r\na very heavy burden upon the business of printing and selling books.\r\nThe details of the methods employed by the censors will be referred to\r\nin a later chapter. Their operations, were, of course, not confined\r\nto the supervision of books printed in Spain or prepared for the\r\nSpanish press. An elaborate system of inspection was instituted for\r\nbooks ordered by booksellers or by individuals from other countries.\r\nLarge numbers of these foreign publications were destroyed in the\r\ncustoms-houses, while in other cases, as a milder judgment, the\r\nsupplies were refused admission and had to be returned to the shippers.\r\nAs a result, the business of importing books could hardly be made\r\nprofitable, and at times became dangerous. It is not surprising that,\r\nin the face of such difficulties and under the hampering influence\r\nof such burdens, the book-trade of Spain, during the three centuries\r\nfollowing the date of the first Spanish Index, was attenuated and\r\ninsignificant, and as compared with that of France, Germany, or the Low\r\nCountries, played but an inconsiderable part in the community. It is in\r\nfact difficult to understand how under these exceptional conditions,\r\nany printer-publishers or booksellers should have been able to maintain\r\nan existence.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, also, the publishers and booksellers worked during these\r\ncenturies under similar difficulties, but there were mitigating\r\ncircumstances. The Inquisition was able to retain in its hands only\r\na partial control of the censorship, while outside of the papal\r\nStates its authority was not infrequently set at naught. In fact, in\r\nVenice, for a large portion of this period (to use a phrase of a later\r\ncentury), the writs of the Inquisition “did not run,” an exemption\r\nwhich was by no means the least of the several factors combining to\r\nmake Venice a centre of book-production. The division of the Peninsula\r\ninto a number of states or principalities was an important influence in\r\nmaintaining for the printer-publishers some measure of independence,\r\nas the undertakings that were stopped or interfered with in one State\r\ncould, with no insuperable difficulties, be carried across the nearest\r\nboundary and brought to completion in another. A further influence\r\nserving to secure protection for the printing-press, and to promote\r\nits activity, was the personal interest on the part of many of the\r\nItalian princes in intellectual pursuits and in literary production,\r\nan interest that caused them to compete with each other for the\r\npossession of scholars and to offer special advantages to enterprising\r\nprinter-publishers, and which made them frequently willing, for the\r\nsake of the literary prestige of their States, to brave the disfavour\r\nof the ecclesiastical authorities. In Italy, therefore, while the\r\nproduction and distribution of books was frequently interfered with\r\nby the operations of the Congregation or by the Inquisition, it is\r\nprobable that (at least outside of the papal States) the actual\r\ndetriment caused by the censorship to intellectual interests was by no\r\nmeans as great as, from the long list of mandates, prohibitions, and\r\npenalties, might at first be inferred.\r\n\r\nIn France, the conditions which opposed and those which favoured the\r\nfreedom of the press differed in several respects from those which\r\nobtained in Spain or in Italy. We have here to deal with a central\r\ngovernment whose authority over a fairly homogeneous territory was\r\nfor the greater part of the periods under consideration not seriously\r\nquestioned. The literary and publishing interests of the kingdom\r\nwere centred in the capital, and in fact, with the single exception\r\nof Lyons, there were, outside of Paris, no publishing centres of\r\nimportance. The literary policy of the Church, expressed through the\r\ntheological faculty of the Sorbonne, could, therefore, conveniently\r\nbe brought to bear very directly upon the operations of the Paris\r\nbook-trade, the organised guild of which itself formed part of the\r\nuniversity. Finally, the authority of the Crown, acting through\r\nthe royal courts or directly through the chancellor, was, in form\r\nat least, available for putting into effect any measures for the\r\nsupervision or restriction of literature with which the administration\r\nmight find itself, in accord. Notwithstanding, however, this\r\napparent completeness of the supervising machinery, the book-trade\r\nof Paris was able to retain a very large measure of independence,\r\nand its contributions to the literary productions of Europe were,\r\nnotwithstanding the censorship, of continued importance. Several\r\ninfluences worked in its favour. The divines of the Sorbonne and the\r\nleaders of the Gallic Church, while often actively opposed to scholarly\r\nundertakings, were by no means prepared simply to register and to\r\nexecute the censorship decrees of the authorities of Rome. No Roman\r\nIndexes were accepted as binding upon believers in France unless or\r\nuntil they had been formally approved by the French Church and had been\r\nput into effect by the authorities of the State. With an occasional\r\nexception, such as that of the Index of the Council of Trent, the\r\nGallican censors preferred to frame their own Indexes and to adapt\r\nthese to the requirements and conditions of their own country.\r\n\r\nThe State was still less ready than the Church to accept as\r\nauthoritative instructions emanating from Rome in regard to the\r\ncharacter of the books that should be produced or should be permitted\r\nin France. Successive kings took the ground that the final authority\r\nin regard to censorship was vested in the State, that is to say in the\r\nCrown. The divines of the Sorbonne were instructed or permitted to\r\npass upon the applications for privileges for books belonging to the\r\ndepartment of theology, but even for these, their dicta were not always\r\naccepted and (as in the case of the Bibles of Estienne) were sometimes\r\nentirely set aside by the Crown.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the University of Paris, for centuries the most\r\nimportant in Europe, contended through a long series of years that\r\nthe supervision and control of the book-trade of the kingdom was\r\na university matter, and it succeeded for a series of years, with\r\noccasional exceptions and set-backs, in maintaining this contention\r\nvery largely until, with the gradual extension of the powers of the\r\nCrown, the direction of censorship and of privileges had been, with\r\nnearly all other divisions of government, brought directly under royal\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nMore than one scholar has been quoted as saying that the intellectual\r\nlife and development of Europe during the centuries between 1556 and\r\n1800 could be traced by the lists of condemned books, and that these\r\nbooks would in themselves constitute a fairly complete library for the\r\nthoughtful student. There might be ground for con|plaint that, owing to\r\nthe remissness or ignorance of the censors, the lists included titles\r\nof a number of works not valuable enough to deserve condemnation, and\r\nomitted many of real value and continued importance. Irrespective of\r\nsuch inconsiderable exceptions in one direction or another, there can,\r\nI judge, be no question that a very large proportion, one may say by\r\nfar the largest proportion, of the world’s literature that stood for\r\nintellectual activity and insight, literature which expressed the\r\nconclusions of the greatest minds of their several generations, and\r\nwhich stood for the development and the civilisation of the community\r\nitself, had been placed by the Church in the Index of condemned and\r\nprohibited books. Comparatively few of these books of light and\r\nleading had been omitted (and those apparently through inadvertence)\r\nand comparatively few books had been included which, apart from any\r\nquestions of heresy or pernicious doctrine, would, under a standard\r\nnot theological, be classed as dangerous or unwholesome for the\r\ncommunity. In fact, the service of the Index in suppressing or in\r\ndiscouraging books _contra bonos mores_ may be characterised as\r\nunimportant.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the service to literature and to the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of mankind (a service none the less important because it\r\nwas so entirely unintended) brought about through the action of the\r\nChurch in preparing Indexes that served to chronicle the books of the\r\nthinkers and thus to preserve and extend their teachings. It is natural\r\nto enquire to what extent this service was offset by the interference\r\nwith literary production and distribution caused by the burdens of\r\ncensorship and by the repressive measures of the inquisitors and other\r\ncensors. To such an enquiry there can be no very satisfactory answer.\r\nThe materials or data for any precise calculation do not exist. In the\r\nchapter on the Index and the Book-trade, I have however presented such\r\ngeneral data as I have been able to secure concerning the effect of the\r\ncensorship regulations upon the operations in different States of the\r\nprinter-publishers and the booksellers.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the extent of the influence of the system is not\r\nto be measured by the number of books condemned after publication\r\nor after being put into type. It is probable that the restrictions\r\nand detriments placed in the way of literary production constituted\r\na more important influence on the intellectual life and development\r\nof the people than the cancellation or expurgation of books that had\r\nalready come into existence. These latter might be reprinted, and to\r\na considerable extent were reprinted, in other countries, in which\r\ncase their authors would be able to feel that their work had not been\r\naltogether without results. But the influence of the writers who were\r\ndeterred from writing, and of the lecturers who were afraid to continue\r\nto speak, was lost not only for their own community but for their own\r\ndevelopment, unless, as from time to time happened, they preferred\r\nbanishment to repression and silence. Whether the leaders of thought\r\nwere expatriated or were silenced, the effect in the home country on\r\nthe university centres and on the so-called educated circles was the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAt the very time when in Italy, France, Germany, and the Low Countries\r\nthe intellectual activities were greater than ever before known, and\r\nminds working in new directions of research were expressing themselves\r\nin varied and suggestive literary productions, scholarship in Spain\r\nhad been confined in a few fixed channels, its expression had become\r\nstilted and reiterative, and the literature of thought, imagination,\r\nand opinion had almost disappeared. It would be interesting to\r\nascertain whether an intelligent Romanist of to-day, who believed\r\nconscientiously in the necessity, or at least in the wisdom, of\r\necclesiastical censorship, would be prepared to accept as satisfactory\r\nthe results of such a system in the one country in which it had been\r\ncarried on with any measure of consistency and thoroughness.\r\n\r\nIt must at the same time be borne in mind that this censorship was not\r\nimposed upon Spain by an authority from without. The power of Rome\r\nwas never applied, either in regard to literature or to other matters\r\ncontrolled by the Church, with greater strenuousness or severity in\r\nSpain than in France or in Italy itself. In fact, whether from choice\r\nor from necessity, the direction of the affairs of the Church of Spain,\r\nand the regulation of the discipline of its members, were left by the\r\nPapacy to be controlled by the Spanish ecclesiastics themselves. The\r\nInquisition, as organised in Spain, was the creation of Spaniards and,\r\nwith hardly an exception, the inquisitors who during the centuries in\r\nquestion carried on its work were Spanish in birth and in training.\r\nThe policy of placing in the hands of the Inquisition the creation\r\nand the administration of a system of censorship of literature, and\r\nthe responsibility for the preparation of the Indexes, is one for\r\nwhich the rulers of the kingdom, acting naturally under the influence\r\nof their spiritual advisers, must be held directly responsible. The\r\necclesiastics succeeded in convincing not one but successive Kings\r\nof Spain that for the safety and welfare of the community literature\r\nand education, higher as well as elementary, must be placed under the\r\nsupervision of the Church.\r\n\r\nA further responsibility, however, for this abandonment to\r\necclesiastical control of the intellectual life of the community\r\nmust rest with the people themselves. If the literary productions\r\nof Spain were restricted and hampered to the point of crushing out\r\naltogether, if the men of active minds were banished or made dumb, if\r\nthe business of the printer-publishers was brought to a close, and if\r\nthe few enterprising readers who, notwithstanding the instructions\r\nof their confessors, might still venture to interest themselves in\r\ncurrent literature, were obliged to depend for their supplies upon the\r\nchance of securing copies of the prohibited books smuggled in with\r\nbales of merchandise, it was because the people of Spain had decided\r\nfor themselves that such methods were necessary for their spiritual\r\nsafety. It may well be a matter of surprise that, under the conditions\r\nof censorship obtaining during the 16th and 17th centuries, it should\r\nhave been possible to bring into existence any such national literature\r\nas that which is described by Ticknor and other historians. With a\r\ncensorship which, in form at least, differed very little in the several\r\ngreat Catholic States of Europe, the fact that the Spaniards were\r\nwilling to accept and to give obedience to a series of regulations, of\r\npenalties, and of prohibitions such as it proved to be impossible to\r\nenforce in Italy, in France, or in Germany, is evidence of some special\r\nquality in the Spanish nature.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the fulminations of the Church in regard to heretical or\r\ndangerous literature were, in form at least, as severe in their\r\npenalties and as sweeping in their prohibitions as those which emanated\r\nfrom the inquisitors in Spain. There appears, however, to have been\r\nno period during which there was any consistent consecutive system\r\napplied throughout the entire Italian peninsula in carrying out the\r\nregulations that had been formulated by the Inquisition of Rome\r\nor by the Congregation of the Index. The successive papal Indexes\r\nwere produced at considerable and very varying intervals. There is\r\nno evidence in the series of these Indexes of any definite policy\r\nin regard to the terms of years to be covered or the extent or the\r\nclasses of the literature which was to be considered. From time to\r\ntime, as successive popes assumed the papal chair, there would come\r\none possessing a larger measure of literary interests or a clearer\r\nperception of the influence of literature upon the religious conditions\r\nof the community. Instructions would then be given for the production\r\nof a new papal Index, the lists in which would include, in addition to\r\nthe more important of the titles in the preceding Indexes, the works of\r\nthe later period the use of which was to be forbidden.\r\n\r\nAs will be made clear in the detailed record of the papal Indexes,\r\nthe attempt was made but once in Rome to produce an _Index\r\nExpurgatorius_. The popes and the members of the Congregation,\r\nwho had the immediate responsibility for the work, appear to have\r\nshrunk from a task with which the Spanish inquisitors had charged\r\nthemselves without hesitancy, namely the reshaping of books which had\r\nalready come into circulation and influence, in such manner as to\r\neliminate heretical passages or expressions which might in any way\r\nconflict with sound doctrine. The fact that through such eliminations\r\nand interpolations the purpose and character of the work might be\r\nmaterially altered and the author might be made responsible for\r\nutterances or opinions which were not his own, or the further fact\r\nthat through any such reshaping the literary form, and sometimes even\r\nthe actual sense of the narrative, was practically sacrificed, did not\r\ntrouble the minds of the revisers selected by the Spanish inquisitors.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the prohibitions and regulations instituted\r\nin Rome by the Congregation of the Index varied materially in the\r\ndifferent Italian States. The printer-publishers of Rome were naturally\r\nobliged to give respect to the papal ordinances concerning literature,\r\nbut even in Rome itself it was usually not difficult to secure through\r\nthe booksellers, in Venetian, Florentine, or foreign editions, copies\r\nof prohibited books. It was in Venice that, as far at least as the\r\nterritory of Italy was concerned, the smallest measure of attention was\r\npaid to the prohibitions of the Roman Index. The contest instituted,\r\nabout 1580, by Paolo Sarpi against the authority of Rome to control\r\nthe printing-presses of Venice, was not the beginning but really the\r\nculmination of a long series of active protests on the part not only of\r\nthe printers, but of the government of the republic itself. In fact,\r\nthe conflict in which Sarpi took place as leader was brought about\r\nimmediately by a renewal of attempts on the part of the Curia to secure\r\nfor Rome the control of censorship in Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the Catholic States of South Germany, the record of the censorship\r\nof Rome is very similar to that which has been noted in the case of the\r\nItalian States. There were times in which very strenuous censorship\r\nregulations were issued, under the authority of either emperor or\r\nprince, in such cities as Vienna, Basel, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, etc. The\r\nimmediate result of such ordinances was to check the operations and to\r\ncurtail the undertakings of the local printers, but the effect on the\r\nfinal circulation of the books condemned was but inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nIn France, the prohibitions of the papal Indexes and the censorship\r\nregulations instituted by the Roman Congregation of the Index were not\r\naccepted as binding unless and until they had been confirmed by the\r\nrulers of the Gallic Church, and there were but few instances in which\r\nthe French bishops attempted to take action in regard to censorship\r\nexcepting under instructions emanating from the Crown. There was, under\r\nthe successive kings, not a little variety of policy in connection with\r\ncensorship, and of method in carrying out the policy adopted. With\r\ncertain monarchs the influence of the ecclesiastics was much stronger\r\nthan with others, and during such reigns, the decisions concerning the\r\nacceptance of the Roman Indexes and the work of preparing the Indexes\r\noriginating in France were left in the hands of the bishops. From reign\r\nto reign, however, the precedent became more firmly established that\r\nthe final authority in the matter rested with the Crown, and that even\r\nwhen the immediate direction of censorship was left with the bishops,\r\ntheir power to act came to them not from the pope, but from the king.\r\n\r\nAny jealousy that may have existed with the ecclesiastics against\r\ninterference on the part of the State with functions elsewhere held as\r\nbelonging to the control of the Church, appears in France to have been\r\nmore than offset by the determination of the Gallic Church to maintain\r\nits full independence against Rome. Censorship in France remained,\r\ntherefore, a matter kept under the direct control of the Crown, to\r\nan extent which was paralleled in no country excepting England. The\r\nKings of France, during the two centuries succeeding the invention of\r\nprinting, were for the most part more keenly interested in furthering\r\nthe operations of the printer-publishers, than in protecting the\r\ndoctrines of the Church and the faith of believers against the risks of\r\nheretical literature. The undertakings of the printers had been made\r\npart of the work of the royal university, and the literary achievements\r\nof the Paris press brought prestige to the rulers of France.\r\n\r\nCensorship was, of course, exercised, and in the case of theological\r\nworks, the supervision of which was confided to the divines of the\r\nSorbonne, the prohibitions and restrictions were not infrequently\r\nnarrow and burdensome. It was the case, however, that the press of\r\nParis was on the whole less seriously interfered with during the\r\ncensorship period than that of any other Catholic State. It was further\r\ntrue, also, that while the prohibition of a book by the Sorbonne did\r\nfrom time to time block the sale of the Paris edition, bringing serious\r\nloss to the original publisher, it could not prevent the distribution\r\nof copies even among French readers. A work that had proved of\r\nsufficient importance to be placed on a Paris Index was pretty sure to\r\nbe promptly printed in Lyons or in Tours, and if or when the authority\r\nof the censors had succeeded in stopping the operations of the\r\nprovincial printers, the presses of Geneva, Cologne, and Amsterdam were\r\nalways ready to supply the demand that was quite certain to continue\r\nfor a work classed as heretical or dangerous. The total circulation\r\nand final influence of the book was, therefore, likely to be furthered\r\nrather than restricted by the action of the censors.\r\n\r\nIn the Low Countries, and particularly in Holland, the operations of\r\nthe censors and Index-makers of Italy, Spain, and France constituted a\r\nfactor of not a little importance in furthering the development of the\r\nbook-trade. The printer-publishers of Holland kept themselves promptly\r\ninformed of the operations of the various authorities which had taken\r\nupon themselves the task of supervising the literature of the world.\r\nEarly copies of all the original Indexes found their way, as soon as\r\nproduced, to Leyden, Amsterdam, and Utrecht, and were promptly utilised\r\nby the enterprising Dutch publishers as guides for their publishing\r\nundertakings. Within a few months of the time when the censors of Rome\r\nor of Paris had completed, as they supposed, the cancellation of the\r\nlocal editions of the condemned books, copies of the Holland issues\r\nwould begin to find their way, more or less surreptitiously, into\r\nthe hands of the readers of the country of origin. Literature is, in\r\nthis respect, like water; whatever the intervening obstacles, it is\r\npretty sure to find its level, or, like air, to find its way under the\r\npressure of the mass of the intellectual atmosphere to the points\r\nwhere there exists an intellectual vacuum or need.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that at a time when, in the absence of journals,\r\nthere were but limited means of information as to the existence or\r\nthe character of literary productions, the Indexes proved to be\r\nmost serviceable guides concerning books for which communities were\r\nwaiting. The restrictions and prohibitions of the censorship system\r\nbrought serious and sometimes crushing difficulties upon publishing\r\nundertakings in certain centres, but proved of invaluable service as\r\nsuggestions for active-minded readers throughout Europe, and also for\r\nthe undertakings of publishers in countries like Holland, who, free\r\nfrom restrictions at home, were very ready to utilise their presses\r\nfor the profitable work of distributing abroad literature for which\r\nthe Church, in advertising it as heretical, had taken pains to prepare\r\nthe way and to provide a public. However great were the difficulties\r\nbrought through the Church censorship upon the book-trade in other\r\ncommunities, it was certainly the case that for the printer-publishers\r\nand book-distributors of Holland it secured very direct and\r\nconsiderable advantages.\r\n\r\nIn England, even prior to the schism under Henry VIII, the Church of\r\nRome never secured any control over the censorship of the press. The\r\nresponsibility for the production of books had, with special reference\r\nto the convenience of supervision, been concentrated at an early date\r\nin the Stationers’ Company. The supervision of the operations of\r\nthis company was retained under the direct control of the Crown and\r\nwas carried out by officials appointed under royal authority. These\r\nsupervisors or censors were for the most part not ecclesiastics. Such\r\ncensorship as took place in England was in fact more largely political\r\nthan ecclesiastical. The perils guarded against had to do with assaults\r\nupon the authority of the Crown rather than with opinions classed as\r\nheretical by the Church.\r\n\r\nIt was also the case that while the book-trade of the realm had, very\r\nconveniently for the censors, been centred in London and organised\r\nunder the Company of Stationers, there were from time to time presses\r\nin activity outside of the capital, presses the work of which very\r\nlargely escaped supervision. Either through such county town issues\r\nor by means of supplies imported from Holland, it is probable that\r\nEnglish readers who were prepared to interest themselves in heretical\r\nliterature met with no serious or continued difficulties in the way of\r\nsecuring the desired material. For England as for Holland and North\r\nGermany, the Indexes published at Rome and elsewhere served also as\r\nconvenient guides for the book-buying and the reading of the more\r\nactive-minded members of the community.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, it is not easy to arrive at any trustworthy net\r\nresult concerning the final effect upon the literary conditions of\r\nEurope of the work of the ecclesiastical censors. The preceding brief\r\nsummary gives my impression as to the more immediate effect of the\r\ncensorship in the more important States which were within reach of\r\nthe supervision of the Church. It would appear as if the literary\r\nconditions of each community had been hampered or interfered with in\r\nalmost direct proportion to the efficiency of the censorship machinery.\r\nTo the extent to which the prohibitions and restrictions of the Indexes\r\nwere carried out consistently, literary activity was checked, the\r\nproduction of higher literature was lessened, and the intellectual\r\ncapacities of the people were stunted.\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly possible that the indirect service, to which\r\nreference has been made, that was rendered by the work of the censors\r\nin emphasising for communities not within the control of their\r\nprohibitions the distinctive interest and abiding importance of the\r\nprohibited books, could make an adequate offset for the sterilising\r\ninfluence exerted within the communities that were under thorough\r\nsupervision and control.\r\n\r\nThe system of organised Church censorship had its origin during the\r\ntime of the Reformation in the necessity under which the Church felt\r\nitself of protecting the faithful, and perhaps more particularly\r\nthe doubtful, from the influence of heretical arguments presented\r\nin printed form. The earlier history of the Indexes is therefore\r\nclosely associated with the record of the conflict of the centuries\r\nbetween Protestantism and the Church. This relation has, however, a\r\nconfusing effect in the attempt to estimate the direct influence of\r\nthe censorship upon literature, for the reason that the direction of\r\nliterary activities and the character of literary production were,\r\nduring the two centuries succeeding the first protests of Luther,\r\nvery materially affected, outside entirely of the influence of the\r\ncensorship, by the theological and controversial tendencies of\r\nthe time. The Reformation was an intellectual revolution, and the\r\ncontest was carried out on both sides with intellectual weapons.\r\nThese controversies had the effect of sharpening men’s minds and of\r\ncultivating the capacity for thought, for analysis, and for reasoning\r\npower. In reading the controversial literature which proceeded on the\r\none hand from such Protestant centres as Wittenberg and Geneva, and\r\non the other from Rome, Cologne, or Louvain, it may well be to-day a\r\nmatter of surprise that the writers were able to count upon circles of\r\nreaders likely to be interested in their dissertations and capable of\r\nunderstanding the class of arguments presented. It was the case during\r\nthe 16th and 17th centuries not only that long series of controversial\r\nworks were prepared by scholars for the reading of scholars, but\r\nthat great masses of material, mainly in the form of pamphlets, were\r\nplaced upon the market for the instruction or the influencing of what\r\nwe should to-day call the common people. The tracts, “flyleaves”\r\n(_flügschriften_), which were distributed from the presses of\r\nWittenberg were addressed directly to artisans, farmers, and peasants.\r\nFor a few years, the controversial literature of this class was\r\nmonopolised by the Protestants. The arguments of the defenders of the\r\nChurch were addressed to the scholars and preachers with the idea of\r\nreaching through them the understanding of the common people. Before\r\nthe middle of the 16th century, however, Catholic writers also began to\r\ngive attention to the production of controversial literature addressed\r\ndirectly to the common people. The historian who to-day examines the\r\nfiles of this Reformation literature is struck by the high estimate\r\nplaced by the writers on both sides upon the understanding of these\r\nreaders among the people. It would be difficult to find to-day among\r\nthe peasants of Germany, or in the same classes of other countries,\r\nany body of readers who would be prepared to interest themselves in\r\nthoughtful literature of such a standard, or who would be competent to\r\nfollow the reasoning and the arguments of these controversialists of\r\nthe Reformation period. It may be borne in mind, as a credit to the\r\neducational influence of the Roman Church, that these communities, the\r\ncommon people of which were sufficiently intelligent to be influenced\r\nto the point of revolution by the arguments of the Protestant leaders,\r\nmust have owed their education almost entirely to the priests of the\r\nChurch of Rome.\r\n\r\nWhile, in this direction of controversy, the Reformation had a\r\nstimulating effect on the intellectual interests of a number of the\r\nEuropean States, it may be admitted that in certain respects its\r\ninfluence upon literature was hampering and restricting rather than\r\nelevating. In the countries in which the Protestant opinions secured\r\ncontrol there was, for a considerable period at least, a decided\r\nsetback to the study of the classics and to all literary production\r\noutside of the domain of theology or religion. The interest in\r\nclassical literature which had been initiated in Italy under the\r\nso-called Renaissance and in connection with the rediscovery of the\r\ngreat works of Greece, was for the time lost sight of in the Protestant\r\nStates of Germany and of the Netherlands and among the Calvinists of\r\nFrance and of England. Classic writers were classed as “pagans” and\r\ntheir works were discouraged as likely to have a worldly influence on\r\nthe minds of the faithful. The work in the universities in these States\r\nwas, outside of the theological faculties, more and more restricted\r\nto what might be called utilitarian channels. The textbooks planned\r\nby Melancthon and his associates were of distinctive service for\r\nelementary education and undoubtedly represented a material advance\r\nover the books of the same grade which had been utilised for the\r\nelementary Catholic school. For a considerable period, however, the\r\neducational advance stopped with this elementary work; and in the\r\nuniversities there was a lack of higher grade teaching and a narrowing\r\nof the whole course of training.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Erasmus emphasise the conviction that took shape\r\nin his mind as to the essential injury brought upon the cause of\r\nhigher scholarship by the absorption of so large a proportion of the\r\nactive-minded thinkers in matters purely controversial. He believed\r\nstrongly in the necessity for radical reforms in the Church. He\r\nrecognised as clearly as did the Protestant leaders the enormity of the\r\nevils which had been permitted to creep into the administration of the\r\naffairs of the Church and to corrupt both the teachers and the hearers.\r\nHe looked with dismay, however, upon the operations of the reformers\r\nwhen these took the shape of antagonism to the final authority of pope\r\nor council and thus constituted an assault upon the very existence of\r\nthe Church Universal.\r\n\r\nTo Erasmus and to other scholarly readers in the Church whose devotion\r\nto the religious purposes of the Church organisation was possibly\r\npurer minded and more consistent than his own, men like Sir Thomas\r\nMore, and Dean Colet, it seemed essential for the wise management of\r\nthe Church upon which depended the maintenance of the true faith, that\r\nthe leadership and authority should be left in the hands of scholars.\r\nThey dreaded lest the establishment of the doctrine of individual\r\ninterpretation, of the right of believers to a direct relation with\r\ntheir Creator, and the shaping of creeds and of rules of action apart\r\nfrom the counsel and guidance of trained ecclesiastics, must of\r\nnecessity lead to such excesses as were evidenced in the performances\r\nof the Anabaptists in Westphalia, or in the utterances of the fanatics\r\nwho incited the peasant revolt in Saxony.\r\n\r\nIt may be concluded, therefore, that while the machinery of\r\necclesiastical censorship remained in force only in the countries\r\nwhich the Reformation had not succeeded in detaching from the control\r\nof the Church, there was no such immediate advantage, at least during\r\nthe half-century succeeding the work of Luther, in the production and\r\ndistribution of literature in the Protestant countries as might have\r\nbeen expected to result from the freedom secured from the interference\r\nof the ecclesiastics. By the close of the 16th century, however,\r\nwhen the Protestant control of the States which have since remained\r\nProtestant seemed to be fairly assured (an assurance which was, to be\r\nsure, rudely interrupted twenty years later, by the opening of the\r\n“Thirty Years War”), there came a reaction in the educational centres\r\nin these States in favour of the work of higher education. The study of\r\nGreek, and to a smaller extent that of Hebrew, was taken up in certain\r\nof the Protestant colleges. A wide circulation was secured for the\r\ntext of the Greek Testament, which had been issued by Erasmus through\r\nthe presses of Froben in Basel, and in connection more particularly\r\nwith this Testament the study of Greek was carried on with increasing\r\ninterest in Wittenberg, Erfurt, and other of the educational centres\r\nof North Germany. The introduction, for the purpose of Greek study, of\r\nthe editions of the great Greek classics, prepared by Aldus and one or\r\ntwo other of the more enterprising printers, naturally brought with it\r\na renewed interest in the works of the Latin writers. These were no\r\nlonger classed as pagan frivolities but were accepted as belonging to\r\nthe intellectual property of the world.\r\n\r\nThis revival of letters, untrammelled by Church censorship, was,\r\nof necessity, seriously interfered with during the ravages of the\r\n“Thirty Years War.” A considerable period elapsed after the Peace of\r\nWestphalia, in 1648, before the disasters and destructions of this long\r\ncontest were sufficiently made good to enable the natural interests\r\nand activities of the people to resume their course. By the beginning,\r\nhowever, of the 18th century, the larger intellectual activities of\r\nthe Protestant States of Europe had made themselves clearly apparent.\r\nThe literary production of these States not only greatly exceeded in\r\nmass that of the Catholic States, but included a very much larger\r\nproportion of what might be called the world’s books, that is to\r\nsay, of books which exerted a continued and increasing influence\r\nfrom generation to generation. The great works of imagination, the\r\nrecords of noteworthy scientific discoveries, the histories accepted\r\nas authoritative, the treatises in higher metaphysics, were produced,\r\nof course not exclusively, but in very much greater proportion, in the\r\ncountries which had either thrown off altogether the authority of Rome,\r\nor which, as was the case with France, while still classed as faithful\r\nto the Church, had practically refused to accept the supervision of\r\nthe Roman Church over their national literature. It may be concluded\r\nthat the theory upon which the censorship of the Church was based is\r\nincompatible with the natural and complete development of the literary\r\npotentialities of a people and interferes with the production of higher\r\nliterature in direct proportion to the effectiveness with which it may\r\nbe applied.\r\n\r\nIt may further be concluded that, excepting in the case of Spain,\r\nthe ecclesiastical censors did not succeed in hampering very\r\nlargely the literary production even in Catholic States, although,\r\nas before pointed out, the general influence of the Church appears\r\nalways to have worked against the full intellectual development of\r\nthe communities that remained in the faith and that accepted the\r\necclesiastical authority.\r\n\r\nThe wider enquiry as to the extent of the influence of the Church\r\ncensorship, during the three centuries of its greatest activity, upon\r\nthe literary production of Europe, that is to say, the question as to\r\nhow far, in case no censorship had been attempted, this literature\r\nwould have been different in character from or greater in importance\r\nthan, that which actually came into existence, must, I judge, remain\r\nunanswered.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the policy pursued during the centuries since\r\nthe advent of printing for a censorship control of literature does not\r\nrest alone with the Catholic Church. In all of the Protestant States,\r\nattempts were made from time to time to control and to restrict the\r\noperations of the printing-press. In the Protestant States of Germany,\r\nthe preparation of the local Indexes or lists of books condemned,\r\nand the issue of the decrees for the separate condemnation of any\r\nindividual work, were in part placed in the hands of the Protestant\r\necclesiastics and in part managed directly by the civil authorities.\r\nThe authority, however, under which the orders were issued and the\r\npenalties were enforced was always that of the State. The edicts\r\nwere given out in Dresden, or in Berlin, as in Brussels, Madrid, or\r\nin Paris, in the name of the ruler. The series of such decrees or\r\ncensorship actions is long and complex.\r\n\r\nThere can, of course, be no question that from the outset the leaders\r\nof the Protestant Reformation believed as thoroughly in the necessity\r\nand in the rightfulness of the censorship of literature as did the\r\necclesiastics of Rome or of Spain. The duty of protecting the minds\r\nof the faithful against the insidious and wrong doctrine was just as\r\nclear to Calvin, to Zwingli, and to Luther, as it was to Loyola or\r\nto Brasichelli. The Protestant ecclesiastics were, however, not in a\r\nposition to enforce or even to threaten any such penalties as could\r\nbe imposed by the authorities of Rome, and as in fact were imposed\r\nmost consistently and effectively by the Inquisition in Spain. They\r\nhad under their control no such dread penalty as excommunication. The\r\nleaders of the Protestant faith were compelled to rely upon the civil\r\nauthorities of their several States for carrying out the provisions of\r\nsuch censorship policy as might be decided upon, and concerning the\r\nwisdom of which they had been able to convince the civil rulers.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the censorship initiated by the divines, which had for\r\nits purpose the maintaining of a specific creed and the preservation\r\nfrom attack of “sound theology,” there is record of a long series of\r\nattempts (attempts which have in fact continued into the 20th century)\r\nto enforce what may be called political censorship,--that is to say,\r\nthe control of literary production in the interests of the State and in\r\nsupport of the authority of the State, against opinions believed to be\r\ninimical to such authority. It may at once be admitted that the series\r\nof Protestant prohibitions, whether ecclesiastical or political in\r\ntheir origin, do not compare favourably with the similar prohibitions\r\nissued under the authority of the Church of Rome. There is far less\r\nconsistency of purpose, and, at least as far as the political edicts\r\nare concerned, there are more examples of bitter and brutal oppression\r\nthan can be matched anywhere in the States controlled by the Roman\r\nChurch outside of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe list of books which came into condemnation under such Protestant\r\ncensorship during the centuries in question was very much more\r\nconsiderable than the aggregate of all the lists of the Indexes\r\nissued in Rome or issued under the authority of the Roman Church.\r\nThe censorship policy of the Protestants was more spasmodic, and may\r\nbe admitted to have been directed on the whole by a less wholesome,\r\ndignified, and honourable purpose. It represented very much more\r\nlargely the spirit of faction or of personal grievance, while the\r\npolitical censorship was, of necessity, influenced by the action of the\r\nparty which happened for the moment to be in control or of the minister\r\nwho had for the time the ear of the ruler.\r\n\r\nWhile in form this Protestant censorship may, therefore, be considered\r\nas less defensible than that of the Church of Rome, it may be contended\r\nthat in fact it has proved on the whole much less serious in its effect\r\nupon intellectual activities. In nearly all of the Protestant States,\r\nthe attempts on the part of the divines to exclude religious and\r\ntheological literature which was not in accord with their own dogmas\r\nand opinion, were given up in the century succeeding the Reformation.\r\nThe censorship action of the State has, as we know, continued in\r\ncertain divisions of literature to the present day, but even under\r\nthis political censorship, it cannot be contended that literature\r\nhas been seriously repressed or even largely influenced. It is not\r\npracticable, under the conditions obtaining in modern States and with\r\nthe active intercourse between the residents of such States, to repress\r\nany literary productions for which a circle of readers is waiting. The\r\nbooks condemned and prohibited in Berlin come into print in Leipsic,\r\nor if the Imperial authority is sufficient to control conditions in\r\nLeipsic, are produced without difficulty in Amsterdam or Leyden. It is\r\nimpossible to prevent the books so printed from finding their way back\r\neven into the territory in which their production and distribution has\r\nbeen absolutely forbidden.\r\n\r\nFather Hilgers, whose work on the history of the Index of the Roman\r\nChurch constitutes the latest, and probably the best, authority on the\r\northodox Catholic view of the purpose and the influence of the Roman\r\ncensorship, is able to make a very formidable indictment against the\r\noperations of Protestant censorship, ecclesiastical and political.\r\nCertain of the statistics collected by him are presented in the chapter\r\non Protestant censorship. He does not undertake to explain, however,\r\nwhy it is that the literary activities repressed from the time of the\r\nReformation in the Catholic States have continued to develop and to be\r\nstrengthened in all the States which were outside of the control of\r\nRoman censorship. He makes no reference to the very specific example\r\npresented in his own German country of the transfer of literary\r\nleadership and of publishing activities from the States of the South to\r\nthe States of the North, a transfer which went on in direct connection\r\nwith the success of the Church in controlling the printing-presses in\r\nthe territory of such States as remained Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated attention given during the period of the Reformation\r\nand by the generations immediately succeeding the Reformation to\r\ncontroversial issues had an important influence on the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the people. The effects produced upon general education,\r\nand particularly upon primary education, were also important. The\r\nstudents who had secured from the higher grade schools, established\r\nby the reformers throughout North Germany, a common school education\r\nsuch as prior to Melanchthon’s time had not been attainable anywhere in\r\nEurope, were, in great part at least, not satisfied to let the work of\r\neducation be brought to a close with the end of their school course.\r\nThey pressed into the universities which had remained in existence\r\nafter the withdrawal of the Catholic instructors. New universities\r\nwere speedily required in many of the North German States to meet the\r\ngrowing demand for higher instruction. The organisation of a number\r\nof the important universities of North Germany dates from the century\r\nsucceeding the Reformation. These universities speedily became the\r\ncentres of literary activity and of publishing production. With the\r\nrelaxation of Catholic censorship, the publishers were free to prepare\r\nfor the public reprints of such old-time literature as was now being\r\ncalled for. The study of Hebrew, discouraged and almost brought to\r\na close in the Catholic universities after the long persecution of\r\nReuchlin and his followers, was taken up with earnestness by Protestant\r\nscholars who had so largely based their creed and their conduct on\r\nthe teaching of the Old Testament. The study of Greek, discouraged at\r\nleast for a time in Catholic France, after the banishment from Paris\r\nof Robert Estienne with his printing-presses, was pressed with fresh\r\nenergy in Leipsic, in Leyden, and in Oxford.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy in this 20th century fully to realise the state of\r\nmind of the individuals, whether ecclesiastics or civilians, whether\r\nof Rome, of Paris, or of London, who have not hesitated to assume\r\nfor themselves the wisdom requisite to pass upon all divisions of\r\nknowledge and who have been willing to take the responsibility for the\r\ndirection, the restriction, and the continued control of intellectual\r\nactivity in all realms of thought. I may recall the eloquent argument\r\nin behalf of the freedom of the press which was made three centuries\r\nback by one great thinker, who was at the time (as it is fair to\r\nremember) protesting against the oppressive action not of the Church of\r\nRome, but of the Parliament of Protestant England. John Milton writes\r\nin the _Areopagitica_:\r\n\r\n   “For Bookes are not absolutely dead things, but doe contain a\r\n   potencie of life in them to be as active as that Soule was whose\r\n   progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a violl the purest\r\n   efficacie and extraction of that living intellect that bread\r\n   them. I know they are as lively and as vigorously productive\r\n   as those fabulous Dragons’ teeth; and, being sown up and down,\r\n   may chance to spring up armed men. And yet on the other hand,\r\n   unlesse warinesse be used, as good almost kill a Man as kill a\r\n   good Booke; who destroyes a good Booke, kills Reason itselfe;\r\n   Kills the image of God as it were in the eye. Many a Man lives a\r\n   burden to the Earth; but a good Booke is the pretious life-blood\r\n   of a master spirit, imbalm’d and treasured but on purpose to a\r\n   Life beyond Life. ’Tis true, no age can restore a Life, whereof\r\n   perhaps there is no great losse; and revolutions of ages doe not\r\n   often recover the losse of a rejected Truth, for want of which\r\n   whole Nations fare the worse. We should be wary therefore what\r\n   persecution we raise against the living labours of publick men,\r\n   how we spill that seasoned life of Man preserved and stored\r\n   up in Bookes; since we see a kinde of homicide may be thus\r\n   committed, sometimes even a martyrdom; and if to extend to the\r\n   whole impression, a kinde of massacre, whereof the execution\r\n   ends not in the slaying of an elementalle Life, but strikes at\r\n   that etherialle and first essence, the breath of Reason itselfe\r\n   and slaies an Immortality rather than a Life.”[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                CENSORSHIP IN THE EARLY CHURCH, 150–768\r\n\r\n\r\n“Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together\r\nand burned them before all men.”[12] This reference to the action taken\r\nby certain men in Ephesus under the influence of the eloquence of St.\r\nPaul is frequently cited by upholders of the censorship policy of the\r\nChurch of Rome. Some of the more artistically printed editions of\r\nthe Index (such for instance as the first Roman edition of the Index\r\nof 1758) contain, as a vignette title, a representation of Paul’s\r\nconverts casting into the flames their books of magic, and beneath\r\nthe print the verse from the Acts. The fact that St. Paul was willing\r\nto have his disciples, in their zeal for their new-born faith, make a\r\nvoluntary sacrifice of writings believed to be incompatible with this\r\nfaith cannot, of course, in itself constitute a sufficient warrant\r\nfor the claim developed later by the Church of the right to destroy\r\nall literature that its rulers considered to be pernicious, or for\r\nthe still larger claim of authority to inflict extreme penalties on\r\nthose who produced, multiplied, or possessed the works thus condemned.\r\nAn admonition to get rid of unchristian books is one thing, and the\r\nimposition of excommunication (or of an unconscious liability to\r\nexcommunication), on the ground of the reading of erroneous doctrine,\r\nis another and a very different thing. But the whole theory of Church\r\nauthority and of excommunication was, of course, a matter of slow\r\ndevelopment through the ages that followed the preaching of St.\r\nPaul. It was in fact not until the 16th century that there came into\r\nexistence anything that could be called a censorship policy or any\r\nattempt at a general censorship system; but from the earliest periods\r\nin the history of the Church there are instances of condemnations of\r\nindividual writers, and of prohibitions, under severe penalties, of the\r\nmanifolding or distribution of particular works. These prohibitions\r\nare usually the result of one of the series of fierce controversies\r\nabout dogma that characterised the earlier centuries of the Church.\r\nThey emanate for the most part from councils, but they are occasionally\r\nissued directly by the pope or by local bishops. In certain cases, they\r\ntake the form of an imperial edict, but even in these the initiative\r\ncomes from a council. It is probable that the influence either of\r\nthe councils or of the emperor in restricting the multiplication or\r\ndistribution of the writings that had been condemned was not very\r\neffective. The edicts and decrees may be considered as representing an\r\nexpression of opinion (connected with one of the bitter theological\r\ncontroversies of the day) rather than as regulations to be enforced.\r\nThere was in fact no machinery for the enforcement. The work of the\r\ncopying scribes could not be supervised, as was possible later for\r\nthe operations of the printers, and the manuscripts could be passed\r\nfrom hand to hand among the sectarians, without the intervention of a\r\nbookshop. There are instances of literary censorship on the part of the\r\nimperial authorities of Rome before the institution of the Christian\r\nChurch. These are outside of the range of my present subject, but\r\ncertain examples may be cited as curiosities.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Early Prohibitions of Literature.=--Tacitus remarks that Augustus\r\nwas the first ruler who undertook to punish a word written or spoken\r\n(that is to say, a word unaccompanied by action). While the law of the\r\nRoman Republic had recognised as deserving of punishment only criminal\r\ndeeds, the Emperor brought the authority of the law to bear upon\r\nwritings described as libellous or scandalous (_libelli famosi_).\r\nHe ordered, for instance, that the writings of Labienus should be\r\npublicly burned. His successor, Tiberius, issued a still stronger\r\nregulation for the supervision of undisciplined or insubordinate\r\nwritings. Cremutius Cordus was driven from his occupation and left\r\nto die through poverty for the offence of speaking of Gaius Cassius\r\nas “the last Roman.” His writings were ordered to be burned by the\r\nAediles. Tacitus speaks with scorn of those who, in the possession\r\nof a little momentary power, undertake to crush out opinions not in\r\naccord with their own, or to prevent such opinions from being handed\r\ndown to posterity. The writings of Vejinto were prohibited by Nero.\r\nConcerning this prohibition, Tacitus writes: “So long as the possession\r\nof these writings was attended with danger, they were eagerly sought\r\nand read; when there was no longer any difficulty in securing them,\r\nthey fell into oblivion.” An edict ascribed to Domitian ordered that\r\nthe historian Hermogenes and any book-dealers who concerned themselves\r\nwith the distribution of certain writings of his which had libelled\r\nthe Emperor should be crucified.[13] The German historian Schmitz\r\nis, however, of opinion that this so-called edict of Domitian was\r\napocryphal. It appears certainly, however, to have been the case that\r\nthe policy of these earlier emperors was decidedly opposed to any\r\nfreedom of expression of thought. If it is the case that in the later\r\ncenturies of imperial rule there are fewer instances of punishments of\r\nwriters or orders for the suppression of literature, the explanation\r\nmay be that literary activity had already been substantially repressed.\r\nJustinian deposed from office Severus and certain other bishops\r\nbecause they had been lax in their supervision of literature, and had\r\npermitted the wide circulation throughout the realm of prohibited\r\nbooks and pernicious writings. With the development of the Church of\r\nRome to the ecclesiastical headship of the world, the claim for the\r\nsupervision of literature and for the control of the productions of\r\nauthors was asserted by the Church as the legitimate successor of the\r\nimperial authority. It is the opinion of Lea that the earliest act of\r\ncensorship, and perhaps the most sweeping, of the Christian Church\r\nis that contained in the “Apostolic Constitutions” which purport to\r\nhave been written by St. Clement of Rome at the dictation of the\r\nApostles. These prefigure the Index by forbidding the Christians to\r\nread any books of the Gentiles;--“the Scriptures should suffice for the\r\nbeliever.”[14]\r\n\r\nThe following schedule of the more representative and important of\r\nthe prohibitions of the early Church is based chiefly on the record\r\npresented by Reusch.\r\n\r\n_150_ A. D. (_about_). _A synod of bishops of Asia Minor_, meeting\r\neither at Ephesus or at Smyrna, prohibits the _Acta Pauli_. The _Acta\r\nPauli_ was an historical romance written about the middle of the 2d\r\ncentury and having for its purpose the glorification of the life and\r\nlabours of St. Paul. The text of a portion of the work has recently\r\nbeen produced in facsimile, from a Coptic manuscript, by Professor Carl\r\nSchmidt of Heidelberg. The book is referred to by Eusebius and also\r\nby Photius, who writes in the middle of the 9th century. There is an\r\nearlier reference by Tertullian in his work on baptism, written about\r\n200. According to Father Shahan, the work was condemned on the ground\r\nthat, although apparently the work of an “orthodox” Christian, it did\r\nnot present an authentic record. Notwithstanding this condemnation,\r\nthe _Acta Pauli_ continued throughout the earlier centuries of the\r\nChurch to secure circulation among Christians. This action of the\r\nbishops of Asia Minor appears to be the first recorded instance of\r\necclesiastical censorship of a work classed as heretical or at least as\r\nnot authentic.[15]\r\n\r\n_325._ _The Council of Nicæa_ prohibits the _Thalia_ of Arius.\r\n\r\n_325._ _The Emperor Constantine_ issues an edict directing the\r\ndestruction of the godless books of Porphyry and of the writings of\r\nArius. The penalty of death was ordered for any who might conceal\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n_398._ _The Emperor Arcadius_ issues an edict ordering, under penalty\r\nof death, the destruction of the books of the Eunomians.\r\n\r\n_399._ _Arcadius_ issues an edict ordering the destruction under\r\npenalty of death (_humiliores capite puniuntur_) of all books of\r\nmagic art. These edicts of Arcadius were the result of the action\r\nof the first two councils of the Church. It seems evident that the\r\nextreme penalties prescribed in the Roman law for those who should\r\nuse or distribute books of magic were, under the influence of the\r\necclesiastics, utilised for the repression of their theological\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\n_399._ _The Council of Alexandria_, under Bishop Theophilus, issues a\r\ndecree forbidding the owning or the reading of the books of Origen.\r\nThe Egyptian monks protested and the bishops were obliged to call in\r\nthe aid of the prefects to restore order in the council and to agree\r\nto enforce its authority. It is to be noted that the service of the\r\nsecular government was required to secure the enforcement of this edict.\r\n\r\n_402._ _Innocent I_ writes: “I have read through the treatise of\r\nPelagius. I found in this much that was antagonistic to the Grace of\r\nGod, much that was blasphemous, and hardly anything that was deserving\r\nof approval. The book is one the evil influence of which each believer\r\nought to be able to recognise for himself and to condemn.” This papal\r\nutterance is, of course, not to be classed as a prohibition. I make\r\nplace for it in the schedule because it is an early expression of the\r\nliterary policy that is now, fifteen centuries after Innocent, being\r\nfollowed by the Church, namely, to characterise pernicious books and\r\nto place upon believers the responsibility of condemning them for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n_431._ _The Council of Ephesus_ condemns the errors and the writings of\r\nthe Nestorians.\r\n\r\n_435._ _The Emperor Theodosius_ issues an edict forbidding the\r\npossession, the reading, or the copying of the Nestorian books, and\r\nordering existing copies to be delivered up for burning.[16]\r\n\r\n_436._ _Theodosius_ issues an edict forbidding the possession and the\r\nreading of the books of the Manichaeans and ordering the burning of the\r\nsame.[17]\r\n\r\n_446._ _Pope Leo I_ issues an edict ordering destruction of the books\r\nof Porphyry and of Origen, and the writings of the Nestorians, the\r\nManichaeans, the Eunomians, the Montanists, the Eutychians, and all\r\nothers which were antagonistic to the Christian religion, and which\r\nwere not in accord with the teachings of the Synods of Nicaea and\r\nEphesus. The prohibition reads: “Whoever owns or reads these books is\r\nto suffer extreme punishment.”\r\n\r\n_494._ Under _Pope Gelasius I_, was issued what is afterwards referred\r\nto as the first papal Index. It was a catalogue of works prohibited,\r\nand is so cited in the Decretals of Gratian. It was, however, not\r\nproperly a prohibitory Index, in that it has to do, not with private\r\nand general, but with public or official reading.\r\n\r\n_496._ _Pope Gelasius_ issues a decree, published at a council of\r\nRome, and confirmed in a decree of Gratian, which specifies the\r\npatristic writings accepted and approved by the Church, and which\r\nthen proceeds to the condemnation of a long series of apocryphal\r\nand heretical writings and writers. These writings are specified as\r\nfollows: “_Haec et omnia his similia non solum repudiata, verum etiam\r\nab omni Romana catholica et apostolica ecclesia eliminata atque cum\r\nsuis auctoribus auctorumque sequacibus sub anathematis indissolubili\r\nvinculo in aeternum confitemur esse damnata._”[18] This decree, known\r\nas the _Decretum Gelasianum_, is sometimes referred to as the earliest\r\nexample of an Index emanating from the Church. It is, however, an Index\r\nonly in a restricted sense of the term, as it does not order a general\r\nprohibition of the reading of the works specified but calls simply for\r\ntheir rejection and condemnation. The phrase _omnia his similia_ is\r\ncuriously vague for an Index specification.\r\n\r\n_536._ _The Emperor Justinian_, as a result of a condemnation by the\r\nSynod of Constantinople, orders the burning of the books of Severus.\r\nThe manifolding of these books is prohibited under a penalty for the\r\nscribe of the loss of his writing hand.[19] It appears from these\r\nand from similar examples that, according to the practice of the two\r\ncenturies after Constantine, the responsibility for the condemnation\r\nof heretical writings was assumed by the councils, while the work of\r\nprohibiting the books, of destroying the copies, and of punishing those\r\nwho retained copies was carried out under the authority of the emperor.\r\n\r\n_649._ _Pope Martin I_ issues a decree condemning and prohibiting\r\ncertain heretical literature.\r\n\r\n_681._ _The Council of Constantinople_ issues a decree condemning\r\ncertain heretical literature and ordering all copies of the same to\r\nbe burned. This is the first instance in which, in place of referring\r\nthe matter to the secular authority, a council had itself ordered the\r\ndestruction of the condemned books.\r\n\r\n_692._ _The Council of Trulla_ issues an edict ordering the burning of\r\ncertain histories of the martyrs, which had been produced in versified\r\nform.[20]\r\n\r\n_755._ _The Council of Rome_ issues an edict ordering the burning of\r\ncertain condemned writings of Adelbert. Pope Zacharius took the ground,\r\nhowever, that it would be wiser to preserve the offending books in\r\nthe archives of the Papacy, _ad reprobationem et ad perpetuam ejus\r\nconfusionem_.\r\n\r\n_768._ An authorisation is granted by _Pope Stephen III_ to Ambrosius\r\nAutpert, a Benedictine monk, for a treatise the title of which is not\r\ngiven. In his application, Autpert states that he is the first author\r\nwho has sought for his work the approval of the Head of the Church; and\r\nthat he is anxious to keep his writings in accord with the teachings of\r\nthe Fathers of the Church.[21]\r\n\r\n_787._ _The second Council of Nicaea_ issues an edict ordering the\r\ndestruction of certain “falsified utterances of the Martyrs” which had\r\nbeen prepared by “enemies of the Church.”\r\n\r\n_814._ _The Patriarch Nicephorus_ orders the destruction in\r\nConstantinople of similar falsified acts of the Martyrs. The number of\r\nsuch censorship edicts in the early Church is not considerable, but it\r\nis to be remembered that through the lack of knowledge of reading, the\r\nfaithful were, during these centuries, fairly well protected against\r\nany evil influence from pernicious literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n         THE PROHIBITION OF BOOKS IN THE MIDDLE AGES 830–1480\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the period known as the Middle Ages, a period which, for\r\nthe purposes of this study, can be considered as comprising the\r\ncenturies from the 9th to the 15th, a long series of condemnations\r\nand prohibitions of books were ordered by various ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities. The brief list here given, as a link in the record of\r\nChurch censorship, presents certain types or examples of the attempts\r\nmade, in advance of any system of general Indexes, to supervise,\r\ncontrol, and restrict the production and distribution of literature.\r\n\r\n_830–840._ During these years, measures were taken against Claudius,\r\nBishop of Turin, and Agobardus, Archbishop of Lyons, on the ground of\r\ntheir heretical writings, but these last were not formally condemned.\r\n\r\n_849._ Gottschalk, a German monk, was, at the instance of Hincmar,\r\nArchbishop of Rheims, excommunicated and condemned to imprisonment for\r\nlife, on the ground of his treatise against certain doctrines of St.\r\nAugustine. Gottschalk died in a dungeon about 869. The Index of 1559\r\nplaces Claudius in the first class, in which he has the honour of being\r\nthe earliest author. This entry is continued in the Index of 1564 and\r\nlater. The name of Agobardus first finds place in the Index of 1605,\r\nand there only in connection with the _editio princeps_ of his works\r\nprinted in 1605. The edition of 1666, and the later issues, failed\r\nto receive formal condemnation. Gottschalk’s treatise escaped the\r\nattention of the Index compilers.\r\n\r\n_1050._ _The Synod of Vercelli_ condemns the treatise by Berengar of\r\nTours on the Lords Supper, and also the work by Ratramnus of Corbu\r\n(written some two centuries earlier) entitled _De Corpore et Sanguine\r\nChristi_.[22] The former book came under various later condemnations.\r\n\r\n_1059._ _A Synod at Rome_ compels Berengar himself to burn the thesis\r\nhe had written in defence of his position.\r\n\r\n_1120._ _A Synod at Soissons_ compels Abelard to burn his treatise,\r\n_Introductio in Theologiam_.\r\n\r\n_1140._ _Innocent III_ orders the burning of the writings of Abelard\r\nand of Arnold of Brescia, and the confinement of the two authors in\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\n_1148._ _A Synod at Rheims_ condemns four chapters of the Commentary\r\nby Gilbert de la Porrée on the treatise by Boethius, _de Trinitate_.\r\nGilbert had proposed to make in the book such corrections as the pope\r\nmight order; but the pope had refused to assume the task. Hefele speaks\r\nof this as the first known instance of an attempt to relieve a text\r\nfrom condemnation by means of expurgation. Gilbert does not find place\r\nin any of the official Indexes but is recorded by Lutzenburg.\r\n\r\n_1209._ _A Synod at Paris_ condemns the _Physion_ of Amalric (Amaury)\r\nof Chartres (who had died five years earlier), excommunicates the\r\nwriter, and orders his remains to be cast out of their resting place\r\nin consecrated ground. Amaury had undertaken to identify the Divine\r\nNature with the primary matter of Aristotle. A number of the followers\r\nof Amaury were, in December, 1210, burned under the commands of Philip\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\n_1209._ _The Synod of Paris_ condemns the writings of David of Dinant.\r\nIt also forbids, under pain of excommunication, the reading of the _de\r\nMetaphysica_ until it had been expurgated.\r\n\r\n_1215._ _The Lateran Council_ condemns the same work.\r\n\r\n_1215._ _The fourth Synod of the Lateran_ condemns the tractate written\r\nby the Abbot Joachim against Peter Lombard. Joachim had died in 1202.\r\nThe decree reads: “Any one who shall attempt to defend the heretical\r\nutterances of the said Joachim concerning the Trinity shall be thrust\r\nout as a heretic.” It was ordered that the writings of Joachim were to\r\nbe submitted to the Curia for correction.\r\n\r\n_1225._ _A Synod at Sens_ passes condemnation on the treatise by Scotus\r\nErigena (written about 860), _De Divisione Naturae_. Pope Honorius\r\nconfirmed this condemnation and ordered that all persons possessing\r\ncopies of the book must, under penalty of excommunication, deliver\r\nthe same, within fifteen days, to the ecclesiastical authorities for\r\nburning.[23]\r\n\r\n_1231._ _Pope Gregory IX_ writes to the University of Paris directing\r\nthe prohibition of the _Libri naturales_ of Aristotle, as condemned by\r\nthe Provincial Council, until they have been freed from heresies.\r\n\r\n_1276._ _Bishop Stephen Tempier_, under instructions from the Pope\r\n(John XXI), and in council with the prelates of his diocese, publishes\r\na condemnation of 219 propositions which had been under discussion in\r\nthe Schools. The judgment states, rather naïvely, that while they were\r\ntrue philosophically, they were false when tested by the doctrine of\r\nthe Church. The bishops condemned at the same time a long series of\r\nbooks on magic and necromancy and ordered all copies to be delivered\r\nfor destruction within seven days.\r\n\r\nOne of the teachers whose influence was most potent during the\r\nmiddle of the 13th century against the heresies that were disturbing\r\nuniversity circles was the great schoolman Thomas Aquinas. A writer\r\nin the Dublin _Review_ says that by his astounding powers of\r\nreasoning, he turned the tide of scepticism in Paris, “whose vocation\r\nit was to teach the world!”--Before the lectures of Aquinas began,\r\nother measures had been used against the heretics: “Ten disciples of\r\nthe misbelieving David Dinanto were given over to the civil arm and\r\nhad perished in the flames.” Archbishop Vaughan says naïvely, “several\r\nfanatics of low rank had to be burnt.”[24]\r\n\r\nIn 1300, Gherardo Segarelli, of Parma, the founder of the Apostolic\r\nBrothers, was burned, together with such copies of his writings as had\r\nbeen collected.\r\n\r\n_1311._ The writings of Segarelli were formally condemned by the\r\n_Council of Vienna_, a condemnation which was a year or two later\r\nconfirmed by John XXII. In 1471, that is, more than a century and a\r\nhalf later, these same writings were formally approved by Sixtus IV,\r\nthe condemnation having been recalled.[25] This appears to be the first\r\ninstance on record in which a work condemned by one pope has later\r\nreceived the approval of another.\r\n\r\n_1316._ _The Inquisition in Tarragona_ condemns fourteen treatises of\r\nthe physician Arnold of Villanova (who had died in 1310), and orders\r\ncopies to be delivered under penalty of excommunication.\r\n\r\n_1321._ _John XXII_ condemns twenty-eight propositions selected\r\nfrom the writings of the Dominican Eckart. Seventeen are classed as\r\nheretical and eleven as suspicious and dangerous.\r\n\r\n_1325._ _John XXII_ issues a Bull against conjuring and exorcism, and\r\norders the delivery for destruction of all writings which contained any\r\nteachings on these pernicious subjects.\r\n\r\n_1327._ _John XXII_ issues a Bull condemning as heretics Marsilius\r\nof Padua and John of Jaudun, and as heresy the book _Defensor Pacis_\r\nof which they were joint authors and which he had had examined by\r\ncardinals and canonists.\r\n\r\n_1328._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ condemns as a heretic Cecco d’\r\nAscoli, who is burned together with his offending treatise, _de\r\nSphaera_.\r\n\r\n_1328._ _John XXII_ condemns and orders destroyed the writings of the\r\nMinorite Petrus Johannes Oliva, which had been examined and reported\r\nupon by nine theologians. The bones of Oliva were disinterred and were\r\nburned with copies of his books.[26] _In 1471_, _Sixtus IV_ (who was\r\nhimself a Minorite) orders the writings of Oliva to be again examined\r\nand declares them to be sound in their doctrine.\r\n\r\n_1328._ _John XXII_ condemns in like manner the Minorite General\r\nMichael of Cesena, William of Occam, and Bonagratia of Bergamo, and all\r\ntheir writings.\r\n\r\n_1330._ _The Theological Faculty of Heidelberg_ condemns the teachings\r\nof Eckart.\r\n\r\n_1348._ _Pope Clement VI_ condemns a series of the theological\r\npropositions of the Paris theologian, Nicholas de Ultricuria (de\r\nAutrecourt). Nicholas was ordered to abjure these heresies and to burn\r\nall copies of the writings.[27]\r\n\r\n_1374._ _Pope Gregory XI_, as a result of an examination made by\r\ncertain cardinals and theologians, condemns as false, schismatic,\r\nand heretical, and as _contra bonos mores_, fourteen articles of the\r\n_Sachsenspiegel_. The Bull was directed to the Archbishops of Mayence,\r\nCologne, Bremen, Magdeburg, Prague, and Riga. The _Sachsenspiegel_ was,\r\nhowever, never placed on the Index.\r\n\r\n_1378._ _Gregory XI_, as a result of a denunciation by the Inquisitor,\r\nNicholas Eymeric, condemned two hundred propositions selected from\r\ntwenty treatises of Raymond Lully (who had died in 1315). In 1419, the\r\npapal legate in Spain characterises this Bull as having been secured\r\nunder false representations, and as not to be regarded. After that\r\ntime, there were numerous bitter controversies over the precise status\r\nof Lully’s writings, controversies in which the orthodoxy of Lully was\r\nmaintained by the Franciscans, while the soundness of the denunciation\r\nof Eymeric was upheld by the Dominicans. Paul IV placed Lully in Class\r\nII of his Index: but his name was omitted from the Index of Trent.\r\nIn 1580 and in 1620, question again arose as to placing Lully on the\r\nIndex, but the suggestion was withdrawn at the instance of the Spanish\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n_1387._ _King Richard II_ prohibits, under penalty of imprisonment\r\nand confiscation of property, the sale or purchase of the heretical\r\nwritings of Wyclif (who had died in 1384) and of Nicholas Hereford.\r\n\r\n_1408._ _The Convocation of Canterbury_, under the direction of\r\nArchbishop Arundel, prohibits the reading of any writings of Wyclif,\r\nor of “any other writings of his time,” until the same had been passed\r\nupon and expurgated by censors appointed by the Universities of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, and the expurgated texts had been approved by the\r\narchbishop.[28]\r\n\r\n_1415._ _The Council of Constance_ condemns as heretical the writings\r\nof John Wyclif. It is forbidden, under pain of excommunication, to read\r\nthem or to make citations from them (except for the purpose of refuting\r\ntheir errors); and the bishops are ordered to cause all copies to be\r\ncollected and burned.\r\n\r\nThe council takes similar action in regard to the writings of John\r\nHuss, copies of which were publicly burned. In the year following, the\r\nsame fate came upon Huss himself, and also upon Jerome of Prague.\r\n\r\n_1435._ _The Council of Basel_ condemns a work by Augustinus Favorini,\r\nPrior General of the Augustinian Eremites. The book was characterised\r\nby Cardinal Torquemada as unwholesome and heretical. The author\r\nappealed to the Pope (Eugenius IV) who, against the protest of the\r\ncouncil, referred the book to a committee of investigation. The report\r\nof the committee is not on record, but it was probably unfavourable, as\r\nthe book (which was never printed) stands, since 1559, on the Index.\r\n\r\n_1459._ _Pope Pius II_, at the demand of the Inquisition, condemns the\r\nwritings of Pecock, Bishop of Chichester (charged with Wycliffian\r\nheresies), and orders copies of the same to be delivered for burning.\r\n\r\n_1460._ _Pius II_ condemns certain “Hussite” writings of Gregory of\r\nHeimburg and, in _1461_, the condemnation is repeated in a _Bulla\r\nCoenae_.\r\n\r\n_1463._ _Pope Pius II_ (_Aeneas Sylvius_) issues a Bull entitled _In\r\nMinoribus Agentes_, directed to the University of Cologne. In this\r\nBull, Pius takes the ground that the tractate on the Council of Basel,\r\nwritten by him before his elevation to the Papacy, (which he points\r\nout he had previously withdrawn) is to be considered as cancelled. He\r\ndisapproves of the opinions therein presented. He says further to the\r\nuniversity: “In case you may find among writings of mine (and I have\r\nin my younger days been responsible for many) any that are unsound\r\nor are likely to prove pernicious, these should be pointed out and\r\ncondemned.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn the Index of 1559 is placed not the work above referred to, but the\r\n_Commentarium de Concilio Basileensi_, by Aeneas Sylvius. In the\r\nIndex of Trent is the entry:\r\n\r\n“_In Actis Aeneae Sylvii prohibentur ea quae ipse in Bulla\r\nretractationis damnavit, Ben. in: Piccolominens, Commentariorum de\r\nconcilio Basil. Corrigantur ea quae ipse in B. r. d._”\r\n\r\nReusch points out that, as no corrected edition was ever issued, these\r\ntwo works of Pius II must be considered as still under condemnation.\r\nHis “Letters” and other writings (some of which he had also disavowed)\r\nescaped formal condemnation.\r\n\r\n_1468._ _Paul II_ excommunicates Gregory of Heimburg on the ground of\r\nhis treatise on the Papacy. Gregory’s name fails, however, to find a\r\nplace either in the catalogues of Lutzenburg, or in any of the Indexes,\r\nalthough this treatise was reprinted in 1555.[30]\r\n\r\n_1479._ _Sixtus IV_ gives authority to Carillo, Archbishop of Toledo,\r\nto bring to trial Pedro Martinez de Osma, professor in Salamanca, by\r\nreason of the heresies in his tract _De Confessione_. Pedro recants\r\nhis heresies, and the archbishop orders all copies of the book to be\r\nburned. The university is enjoined to take measures to such end. Sixtus\r\nconfirms this proceeding in 1480, by a Bull. In the same year, Pedro\r\ndies. His name is not included in any Index, either Spanish or general.\r\n\r\n_1480._ _The Inquisition of Mayence_ brings to trial Johann Ruchrath of\r\nOverwesel (de Wesalia) on the ground of certain _Paradoxa_ contained\r\nin his sermons, and of his tractates on the authority of the Church,\r\nabsolution, etc. Ruchrath recanted and was, therefore, spared from\r\ndeath but condemned to imprisonment for life. He died in 1481. The\r\nbooks were burned. The name of Wesalia appears, since 1559, in the\r\nfirst class of the papal Indexes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Prohibitions of Hebrew Writings.= In the centuries preceding the\r\ninstitution of the Indexes, the _Talmud_ and the other doctrinal\r\nwritings of the Hebrews came repeatedly under the prohibitions of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n_1239._ _Pope Gregory IX_ orders the burning of all copies of the\r\n_Talmud_. Graetz states that the antagonism of the authorities was at\r\nthe outset directed against the Babylonian _Gemara_, and against the\r\n_Mischna_ only when this was associated with the _Gemara_.[31] As a\r\nresult of a denunciation by the converted Jew, Nicholas de Rupella,\r\nGregory sent, in 1239, letters to the kings and archbishops of France,\r\nEngland, Spain, and Portugal, ordering that, on a specified day, all\r\ncopies of these books were to be delivered to the Dominicans and\r\nthe Minorites, and that if they were found to contain the heresies\r\ndescribed by Nicholas, they were to be burned. Reusch says that this\r\norder was carried out only in France.\r\n\r\n_1244._ _Innocent IV_ orders Louis IX to burn all copies of the\r\nTalmudic writings to be found in his kingdom. Later, on the protest\r\nof the Jews of France, the Pope directed Cardinal Odo to make a fresh\r\nexamination of the texts, and in so far as it could be done without\r\ninjury to the Christian faith, to permit copies to be retained by\r\nthe Jews themselves. In 1248, after a further investigation by Odo\r\nand forty scholars (including Albertus Magnus), Odo again orders the\r\ndestruction of the books.\r\n\r\n_1254._ _Louis IX_ issues renewed orders for the burning of copies of\r\nthe _Talmud_ and of other Hebrew books containing blasphemies.\r\n\r\n_1267._ _Clement IV_ sends, by the hand of the Dominican Paulus\r\nChristianus, a converted Jew, letters to the Archbishop of Tarragona,\r\nordering the destruction of the books of the Jews, and especially\r\n_librum quem vocant Talmutz_.\r\n\r\n_1415._ _Benedict XIII_ orders all copies of the Talmudic books to be\r\ndelivered to the bishop of the diocese and by him to be preserved,\r\nsubject to the instructions of the Curia. The Jews are forbidden to\r\npossess copies of any works which contain assaults on the Christian\r\nfaith.[32] In the quarter-century between 1495 and 1520 (a term which\r\nincluded the Papacy of Leo X), on the other hand, there was in Italy\r\na keen interest in Cabbalistic studies. Editions of the _Mischna_ and\r\nof the Jerusalem _Talmud_ were printed in Venice and in Florence; the\r\nBabylonian _Talmud_ was printed by Bomberg in Venice in 1520, 1522,\r\nwith a papal privilege, and the demand proved sufficient to call for a\r\nreprinting in 1546.[33]\r\n\r\n_1555._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ orders the confiscation of copies of\r\nthe Talmudic books from the houses of the Jews, and the investigation\r\nof the texts by theologians. The rabbis were themselves interrogated\r\nas to the purport of the books. As a result of this investigation, the\r\nbooks were burned on the 9th of September (the Jewish New Year’s day).\r\n\r\n_1555._ _Julius III_ publishes an edict directing all princes, bishops,\r\nand inquisitors to confiscate and destroy by fire all copies of the\r\n“Talmuds” of Jerusalem and of Babylon. Christians are forbidden, under\r\npain of excommunication, to possess or to read these books, or to aid\r\nthe Jews in producing copies by script or by printing.[34]\r\n\r\n_1559._ _Paul IV._ The Roman Index of this year includes among books\r\nprohibited the _Talmud_ of the Jews, with all commentaries, glosses,\r\nand interpretations. In the same year, Ghislieri, Inquisitor-General,\r\norders the burning of all copies. Sixtus of Siena was sent to Cremona,\r\nwhere there was a great Hebrew school and where was kept in store\r\na supply of copies of the Talmudic books. Sixtus reports that he\r\ndestroyed of these 12,000 volumes.[35]\r\n\r\n_1564._ _Pius IV._ In the Index of Trent, the prohibition of Paul\r\nIV is repeated, with the proviso that if the Talmudic scriptures\r\n(referring probably to the _Talmud_ of Jerusalem rather than to that of\r\nBabylon) are printed without the name of _Talmud_, and have eliminated\r\nfrom them all assaults on the Christian faith, they may be permitted.\r\nGraetz states that in October, 1563, the Jewish congregations had\r\nsent two deputies to Trent to secure the omission from the Index\r\nof the _Talmud_ and the other works of Hebrew doctrine; or if this\r\ncould not be accomplished, that the decision concerning the form of\r\nprohibition or regulation should be reserved for the authority of the\r\nCuria. The latter course was adopted by the council, and the Pope,\r\nfor a substantial consideration in money, issued a Bull (March 24,\r\n1564) permitting the printing and the circulation of an expurgated\r\n_Talmud_.[36]\r\n\r\n_1565._ _The Inquisition of Rome_ (according to the tractate of Sixtus\r\nprinted in 1566) condemns and orders destroyed all books having to do\r\nwith the “Cabbala.”\r\n\r\n_1592._ _Clement VIII_ issues a Bull forbidding both Christians and\r\nJews from owning, reading, buying, or circulating the Talmudic and\r\nCabbalistic books and other godless writings, whether written or\r\nprinted, in Hebrew or in other languages, which contained heresies or\r\nassaults upon Christian doctrines or upon the practices of the Church.\r\nThe possessors of such books were not to be excused on the plea that\r\nthe texts had been expurgated or were to be expurgated. The authority\r\nextended by Pius IV for such expurgation was recalled. The substance\r\nof this Bull was printed in the Index of Clement issued in 1596. In\r\nthe same year, however, Clement issued a brief permitting the use\r\nof certain specified rabbinical books, when they had been verified\r\nas containing nothing directly antagonistic to the doctrines of the\r\nChurch. In the Index of 1596, and in the succeeding Roman Indexes,\r\nstands a special provision concerning the book _Mazazor_ (_Machsor_)\r\nwhich contains in part the offices and ceremonials of the synagogue.\r\nThis is forbidden in any editions printed in the vernacular, that is in\r\nany language other than Hebrew.\r\n\r\n_1775._ _Pope Clement XIV_ issues an edict in which are cited the Bulls\r\nof Innocent IV, Julius III, and Clement VIII, and their prohibitions\r\nare confirmed. Rabbis and Jews generally were forbidden to possess\r\ncopies of the Talmudic and Cabbalistic books and of any others which\r\ncontained heresies or utterances against the Christian faith. No Hebrew\r\nbooks were to be bought or sold until they had been examined and\r\napproved by the _Magister Palatii_ in Rome, or, outside of Rome, by the\r\nbishop or inquisitor. The penalty was a fine of one hundred scudi and\r\nseven years’ imprisonment.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n            REGULATIONS AFFECTING BOOKS, FROM THE BEGINNING\r\n            OF PRINTING TO THE DATE OF THE EARLIEST INDEXES\r\n                               1450–1555\r\n\r\n    1.

Germany       1521–1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. General.=--The great impetus given to the distribution of books\r\nby the work of the printing-press had as one result a fresh effort\r\nat supervision and control on the part of the Church of literary\r\nproduction. The first measures that were put into shape for the\r\nenforcement of such control provided for what has been called\r\npreventive censorship, that is a requirement, before the printed book\r\ncould be put into circulation, of an examination and approval by\r\necclesiastical authorities. It was, however, not until half a century\r\nafter Gutenberg had printed his first book, that official cognisance\r\nwas taken of the new art in a papal Bull.\r\n\r\n_1479._ _Sixtus V_ authorised the Rector and Dean of the University\r\nof Cologne to impose the penalties of the Church upon those printing,\r\nselling, or reading heretical works. This authorisation was confirmed\r\nby Alexander VI. In 1501, the printers of Cologne sent a representative\r\nto Rome to protest against the censorship of the university\r\nauthorities, which was driving their business out of the city.[38]\r\n\r\n_1480._ There was published in Venice a _Nosce te ipsum_ in which\r\nare printed four “approvals,”[39] and in the same year, a volume was\r\nprinted at Heidelberg with a privilege from the Patriarch of Venice.[40]\r\n\r\n_1486._ _Berthold, Archbishop of Mayence_, issues an edict prohibiting\r\nthe printing in his diocese of any translation from Latin or Greek, or\r\nof any books in the vernacular, until the same had been approved by\r\nthe heads of the four faculties in the University of Erfurt.[41] The\r\nground for this prohibition was that a “number of works had recently\r\nbeen disseminated which contained heresies and errors,” or which were\r\nprinted under false titles, or which presented translations of the\r\nliturgies and Mass-books such as “were not fitting for the people.”\r\n\r\nThe Bull of Innocent VIII, issued in 1487 and directed to the\r\nauthorities of the University of Cologne, is described by Hilgers as\r\nthe first general papal censorship regulation. “With the misuse of\r\nthe printing-press for the distribution of pernicious writings, the\r\nregulations of the Church for the protection of the faithful enter of\r\nnecessity upon a new period. It is certainly the case that the evil\r\ninfluence of a badly conducted printing-press constitutes to-day the\r\ngreatest danger to society. This new flood is drawn from three chief\r\nsources. Theism and unbelief arise from the regions of natural science,\r\nof philosophy, and of Protestant theology. Theism is the assured result\r\nof what is called ‘scientific liberty.’ Anarchism and nihilism,\r\nreligious as well as political, may be described as the second source,\r\nfrom which pours out a countless stream of socialistic writings. In\r\nsubstance this is nothing other than a popularised philosophy of\r\nliberalism. The third source, the foulest and most pernicious of all,\r\nstreams forth from the unwholesome romances of the day, romances whose\r\ncreations rest on the foundations of pornography. If the community is\r\nto be protected from demoralisation, the political authorities must\r\nunite with the ecclesiastical in securing for such utterances some wise\r\nand safe control.”[42]\r\n\r\n_1491._ _Niccolo Franco, Bishop of Treviso_, and papal Legate\r\nto Venice, puts into print in Venice a “Constitution,” which is\r\ndescribed as the first printed regulation of the Church having to do\r\nwith censorship. It is also noteworthy as containing the earliest\r\nprohibition of printed books. The Bishop states that he has evidence\r\nthat the printers are bringing before the public works, tainted with\r\nheresy, which are likely to bring into peril the souls of believers. He\r\nfeels that the responsibility rests upon him, as the representative of\r\nthe Church, to withstand this evil. He therefore orders that hereafter\r\nno books shall be brought into print, having to do with matters of\r\nfaith or of the authority of the Church, without the approval and\r\npermission of the bishop or vicar-general of the diocese. Whoever\r\ndisobeys this injunction shall, without further action, come under the\r\npenalty of excommunication.[43]\r\n\r\nApart from the general injunction in this “Constitution,” it contains\r\na specific prohibition of the treatise on Monarchy by Antonio Roselli,\r\nand of the theses of Pico della Mirandola. Those who have printed\r\nor who may hereafter print these works, or who may have bought or\r\ncome into the possession of copies, are ordered, under penalty of\r\nexcommunication, to deliver such copies at once for destruction.\r\nRoselli was professor of law in Siena and later in Padua. His treatise\r\n_De Monarchia_ had been printed in Venice in 1483 and in 1487. His\r\nname stands in all the Roman Indexes except in that of Trent, and\r\nthereafter with the proviso _donec corrigatur_. Pico escaped official\r\nclassification as a heretic and no one of his writings finds place in\r\nthe Index. In 1487, he had brought before the public no less than nine\r\nhundred theses which he was prepared to defend against all critics. The\r\npope ordered an examination to be made of these theses (propositions)\r\nby a commission of theologians and jurists. The commission found\r\nthat thirteen of the theses were tainted with heresy. Pico, while\r\nmaintaining the orthodoxy of his propositions, expressed his readiness\r\nto submit himself to the judgment of the pope. Six years later, he was\r\nable to secure from Alexander VI a further examination, conducted by\r\nthree cardinals and the _Magister Palatii_, and on the report of this\r\ncommission, the pope declared Pico to be free from suspicion of heresy.\r\n\r\n_1501._ _Alexander VI_, in a Bull entitled _Inter Multiplices_,\r\naddressed to the Archbishop of Magdeburg and to the rulers of the\r\nthree ecclesiastical principalities, says: “The art of printing can\r\nbe of great service in so far as it furthers the circulation of\r\nuseful and tested books; but it can bring about serious evils if it\r\nis permitted to widen the influence of pernicious works. It will,\r\ntherefore, be necessary to maintain full control over the printers\r\nso that they may be prevented from bringing into print writings\r\nwhich are antagonistic to the Catholic faith, or which are likely to\r\ncause trouble to believers.” The Bull proceeds to state that in the\r\ndioceses of Cologne, Mayence, Treves, and Magdeburg many books and\r\ntracts are being sent out from the presses which contain pernicious\r\nerrors, wrong doctrine, and heresies; and prohibits, under pain of\r\nthe excommunication _latae sententiae_, any further printing of such\r\nbooks, and also the possession or perusal of the same. The bishops\r\nand inquisitors are charged with the execution of the decree; and\r\nare ordered to enforce its provisions against all persons, whatever\r\ntheir rank or positions, and also against colleges, universities, and\r\nassociations, with the threat that, in case of opposition or evasion,\r\nthe penalties shall be sharpened and multiplied. The civil powers are\r\nto be invoked if necessary, and in order to strengthen the interest\r\nof the local authorities, they are to receive one half the amounts of\r\nthe penalties collected in money. The above ordinance had to do only\r\nwith the German provinces specified. Even at this early date, the city\r\nof Magdeburg appears to have secured repute for the production of\r\nheretical literature.\r\n\r\n_1512._ _The Inquisition of the Netherlands_ condemns as a heretic\r\nMagistrate Hermann of Ryswick, who is burned at The Hague together with\r\nhis books. His name stands in the Index in Class I, although not even\r\nthe titles of his heretical writings have been preserved.\r\n\r\n_1513._ _The “Constitution” of Leo X_, issued in December, on the\r\nsubject of the immortality of the soul, concerns itself with the misuse\r\nof the philosophers and poets of classic times for the undermining of\r\nfaith and morality. The Pope emphasises the importance of purifying\r\nthe roots or foundations of philosophy and poetry as taught in the\r\nuniversities. In the third part of the Constitution, attention is given\r\nto the principles under which must be carried on the education of the\r\nyoung. It is essential that a careful selection be made for their use\r\nfrom classical writings so that only those books shall be brought to\r\ntheir knowledge which are free from immorality.\r\n\r\n_1515._ _Albert, Archbishop of Mayence_, appoints Paul, Bishop of\r\nAscalon, to be “Commissary” for the examination and censorship of books\r\nsubmitted for printing privileges. Bishop Paul and Canon Trutfetter\r\nwere further instructed to act at Erfurt as inquisitors of heresy, and\r\nwere authorised to prohibit the sale of bad and suspicious books.[44]\r\n\r\n_1515._ _Leo X_, in a Lateran council of May 3d, issues the Bull\r\n_Inter Solicitudines_, which concerns itself in like manner with\r\nthe service and the perils of the printing art. In this Bull, it is\r\nordered that no work should be put into print until its text had been\r\nexamined and approved by the authorities of the Church, in Rome by\r\nthe papal Vicar or the _Magister Sacri Palatii_, elsewhere by the\r\nbishop or the inquisitor-general or by examiners authorised by them.\r\nThe privilege to print must, however, bear the original signature of\r\none of the higher officials. This signature must, under penalty of\r\nexcommunication, be given without delay, and without consideration\r\nfor a work not presenting ground for disapproval. (The Pope knew\r\nhis officials and evidently realised what would be the risk and the\r\ntendency of the working of such a system.) Whoever may attempt to evade\r\nthe regulation and may print books without a privilege shall forfeit\r\nfor burning the books so printed, and shall pay 100 ducats to the\r\nbuilding fund of St. Peter’s, and his printing office shall be closed\r\nfor the term of one year. If he remain obstinate and unrepentant, he\r\nshall be excommunicated, and shall further be so chastened that others\r\nmay take warning by the example. Before the issue of this papal Bull,\r\ncertain local ordinances had been put into effect for the control of\r\nthe printing-press in the centres where the new art was showing the\r\ngreatest activity.\r\n\r\nOne Bishop, Alexius of Melfi, voted against this Bull, with the proviso\r\n_placet de novis operibus, non autem de antiquis_.[45]\r\n\r\nThis Bull of Leo X served as a model for a long series of future\r\nsimilar ecclesiastical orders. The fatherly care for the true faith\r\nand for the preservation of the morality of Christendom are, in the\r\nwording of this papal utterance, placed in the background, while the\r\nmain contention is devoted to the assertion of the authority of the\r\npope and of the special responsibility of the pope, as the immediate\r\nrepresentative of God, for the maintenance of censorship throughout the\r\nworld. The single German prince who was willing to confirm this Bull\r\nwas the Elector Albert of Saxony. The enforcement of the regulations of\r\nthe papal Bulls proved to be difficult and usually impracticable unless\r\nthe aid could be secured of the machinery of the civil administration.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1513, began a series of attacks against Johannes Reuchlin,\r\nattacks which continued for seven years. Reuchlin’s treatise _Der\r\nAugenspiegel_, which had been printed in 1511, was, in 1513, condemned\r\nas heretical by the Universities of Louvain, Cologne, Mayence, and\r\nErfurt. In the year following, the theological faculty of the\r\nUniversity of Paris declared the book to be tainted with heresy.\r\n\r\nIt was ordered that existing copies (presumably those available in\r\nFrance) were to be burned and that the author was to be called upon to\r\nrecant.\r\n\r\nIn 1513, at the instance of Jacob Hoogstraten, the Inquisition\r\ninitiated a “process” against Reuchlin. The decision was adverse to\r\nReuchlin, who appealed to the Pope (Leo X). Leo referred the matter\r\nto the Bishop of Speyer, who gave judgment in favour of Reuchlin,\r\ndeclaring that the book was deserving of being read by every one.\r\nThere followed a series of appeals and of conflicting decisions. In\r\nJune, 1520, however, Cardinals Accolti and Giacobazzi, whom the Pope\r\nhad appointed judges, decided that the judgment of the bishop must be\r\nrevoked, that the book was to be condemned and destroyed, and that\r\nReuchlin was to be ordered to keep silence. While the _Augenspiegel_\r\nwas still the text of the proceedings, the contest had now widened\r\nits range, and turned upon the whole relations of Reuchlin’s work\r\nas a scholar and an instructor, and particularly upon his advocacy\r\nof the study of Hebrew. (In the _Augenspiegel_ itself, the wisdom\r\nof preserving instead of destroying the _Talmud_ is maintained.)\r\nLeo X spoke with approval of Reuchlin’s writings and forbade their\r\ncondemnation. In the Vatican Index the name of Reuchlin stands in Class\r\nI, all of his works being thus placed under condemnation. In the Index\r\nof Paul, are entered the _Augenspiegel_, _De Verbo Mirifico_, and\r\n_Ars Cabbalistica_, and these titles are repeated in the succeeding\r\nIndexes (excepting those of Louvain, 1546, 1550, 1558). In the Index\r\nof Benedict XIV (1758), the title of the _Augenspiegel_ is, curiously\r\nenough, recorded only in French. The compilers of the Indexes were\r\nevidently not influenced by the liberal views of Pope Leo.\r\n\r\n_1517._ _Leo X_, in a special brief written by Sadoletus, condemns\r\nthe _Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_. The _Epistolae_ first find place,\r\nhowever, in the Index in 1590.\r\n\r\n_1521._ When the authorities of the Roman Church and the Catholic\r\nprinces of Europe had become thoroughly aroused and alarmed by the\r\ndevelopment of Protestantism, the famous contract was entered into\r\nbetween Leo and the Emperor Charles V which was to repress the\r\nReformation. One of the most important provisions in this contract had\r\nto do with the control of the press and placed at the disposal of the\r\necclesiastical censors the full measure of the imperial authority.\r\nWith the publication of the Edict of Worms, we have the beginning of\r\na general imperial censorship for Germany. From this time the Church\r\nand the State (or at least the Catholic portion of the State,) worked\r\ntogether against the freedom of the press, freedom which involved not\r\nonly heresy against orthodoxy, but treason against the State.\r\n\r\nAbout 1520, Nicholas Eymeric brought into print in Venice, under the\r\ntitle of _Directorium Inquisitorium_, a list of books classed as\r\nheretical. It does not appear under what authority this classification,\r\nor condemnation, had been arrived at, but the list proved of importance\r\nin the history of the Index, as the titles collected by Eymeric were\r\nutilised for the famous catalogue of Lutzenberg, which itself served\r\nas the basis for the Louvain Index of 1546. The Lutzenberg titles were\r\nalso in large part copied by the compiler of the Index of Paul IV. No\r\ncopy of the original issue of Eymeric’s _Directorium_ appears to\r\nhave been preserved. The work is known through the reprint issued in\r\nVenice in 1607, with the commentary by Franciscus Pegna.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of Bernard Lutzenburg was printed in Cologne in 1520,\r\nunder the title of _Catalogus Haereticorum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Regulations in England in Regard to Book-Production and\r\nCensorship, 1526–1555.=--During the years covering the reign of Henry\r\nVIII, a series of royal edicts were issued for the regulation of\r\nheretical publications. The larger part of these edicts were framed\r\nin consultation with the convocation of bishops. Regulations issued\r\nunder the sole authority of the bishops occur only after the rise of\r\nLutheranism.\r\n\r\n_1521._ _Wareham, Archbishop of Canterbury_, writes to Cardinal Wolsey\r\nasking that the names of the associates of Luther might be sent to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, in order that their writings might be added to\r\nthe lists of prohibited books, and might also be included among the\r\nworks the reading of which was to be permitted under special license to\r\nthe scholars engaged in refuting the Lutheran heresies.[46]\r\n\r\n_1526._ _Wareham_ sends to Duvoisey, Bishop of Exeter, a mandate\r\ndirecting him to make search for certain English translations of the\r\nNew Testament, which are “full of heretical pravity.” The copies\r\nsecured are to be burned. The mandate includes, in addition to this\r\nreference to the New Testament, the titles of certain writings by\r\n“Luther, Tyndal, Huss, and Zwingle.”[47]\r\n\r\nFox makes reference to a similar instruction from Tonstal, Bishop of\r\nLondon, to the archdeacons of his diocese. Tonstal specifies the same\r\ntitles as those given in the list of Wareham.\r\n\r\n_1526._ _Henry VIII_ orders the publication of a catalogue of forbidden\r\nbooks which appears to be the first of the English prohibitions and,\r\nif to be classed as an Index, would rank with the earliest of Europe.\r\nThe catalogue contains but eighteen titles, comprising certain of the\r\nproductions of Luther, Zwingli, and Brenz, the _In Oseam_ of Huss, and\r\nfour anonymous works. The editions referred to had been imported.[48]\r\n\r\n_1529._ _Henry VIII_ authorises the publication of catalogue number\r\ntwo, containing 85 works “imported by the adherents of heretical\r\nsects.” The 85 titles include 22 by Luther, 2 by Wyclif, 11 by Zwingli,\r\n9 by Oecolampadius, etc.\r\n\r\n_1530._ _King Henry_ forbids the reading of the Scriptures in the\r\nvernacular. In the proclamation, the King takes the ground that there\r\nis no necessity for the reading of the Bible by the common people.\r\nThey can secure more safely from their religious instructors all the\r\nScripture teaching that is profitable. When the peril of the spread\r\nof heretical opinions has passed, it will be in order to permit\r\ntranslations of the Bible. For the present, however, all copies of the\r\nversions in English, French, German, or Dutch are to be delivered to\r\nthe bishop.[49]\r\n\r\n_1530._ _Henry VIII_, in a proclamation, forbids the printing,\r\nimportation, sale, or possession of books, whether printed or written,\r\nwhich contain doctrines antagonistic to the Catholic faith, or to the\r\nauthority of the king, or to the laws of the land. The magistrates are\r\ninstructed to take all measures necessary to root out the heresies.\r\nThe proclamation enumerates further certain serious heresies in the\r\nwritings of English authors. The first of these, taken from _The Book\r\nof the Wicked Mammon_, is: “Faith oonley doth justifie us.”[50] In a\r\nsecond royal proclamation of the same year, special prohibition is\r\nmade of books printed abroad, all existing copies of which are to be\r\ndelivered at once to the bishops.[51]\r\n\r\n_1531._ _A royal proclamation_ (_of Henry_), read at St. Paul’s Cross,\r\nspecifies thirty English works the selling and reading of which is\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\n_1534._ _The convocation of Canterbury_ petitions the King to authorise\r\nthe preparation, by well qualified persons, of an English version\r\nof the Bible, and to permit the use of the same by the people. The\r\nKing took no action in the matter, but after 1535, several more or\r\nless complete translations came into publication, and in 1536, the\r\nVicar General, Cromwell, ordered that in each parish church should be\r\nplaced, securely fastened by a chain, a copy of the Coverdale Bible,\r\nin the large form, so that the faithful might become familiar with the\r\ntext.[52]\r\n\r\n_1536._ _King Henry_ (who had been excommunicated in 1535) revokes the\r\nprohibition on the use of the Scriptures.[53]\r\n\r\n_1538._ _King Henry_, in a proclamation, orders that the selling of\r\nbooks shall be done only under royal permit or privilege. No books\r\nshall be printed or imported without being examined and approved by\r\nexaminers appointed by the Crown. Every printed book must bear the\r\nname of the printer and also that of the author, translator, or editor.\r\nNo English version of the Bible shall be printed without a permit from\r\nthe King or from the Privy Council. The penalties are imprisonment and\r\nconfiscation of property.[54]\r\n\r\n_1539._ _King Henry_ makes special prohibition, under heavy penalties,\r\nof the writings of the Sacramentarians and Anabaptists.\r\n\r\n_1543._ _King Henry_ again orders that the Scriptures in the vernacular\r\nbe permitted only for the higher classes.\r\n\r\nDuring Henry’s reign, were published nine catalogues of books\r\nprohibited under the authority of the Crown. These lists have the\r\ncharacter of Indexes, but the titles are not arranged alphabetically.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Fox’s _Acts and Monuments_, issued in 1539,\r\ncontains a “list of Condemned Books,” subjoined to certain\r\n“Injunctions.” This list is omitted from the subsequent editions and is\r\nnot included by Wilkins, who reprints the “Injunctions.” The preamble\r\nto the list reads as follows:\r\n\r\n   “Hereafter folow the names of certen bokes, whiche, either after\r\n   this injunction, or some other in the said Kinges daies, were\r\n   prohibyted, the names of whiche bokes folowe in order expressed:\r\n\r\n   Miles Coverdale, the whole Bible; George Joy; Theodore Baselle,\r\n   alias Thomas Beacon; William Tindall; John Frith; Mels\r\n   Coverdalle (bis); William Turner, translated by Fysh; Robert\r\n   Barnes; Richard Tracy; John Bale, alias Haryson; John Goughe;\r\n   Rederick Mors; Henry Stalbridg, otherwyse Bale; George Joy\r\n   (bis); Urb. Regius; Apologia Melanchthonis; Romerani; Sawtrey;\r\n   Luther, translated by Tindall.”[55]\r\n\r\n_1546._ _Henry VIII_ (in the last year of his reign) issues a royal\r\n“Proclamation for abolishing of certain English books.” The list\r\nrepeats nearly the same names, and is followed by an instrument of the\r\nbishops, specifying at length the heresies to be condemned.\r\n\r\n_1547._ _Edward VI_ orders the publication of a list of homilies and\r\nbooks of worship, the use of which is made compulsory for church\r\nservice. Every priest is instructed to make diligent study of the New\r\nTestament, both in Latin and in English, and to compare with this the\r\nParaphrases of Erasmus. Bishop Gardiner remonstrated, pointing out that\r\nthe homilies and the Paraphrases contradicted each other.[56]\r\n\r\n_1549._ _King Edward_ orders the exclusive use of the official\r\nCommunion Book, and the bishops are instructed to cancel, in such\r\nmanner that they cannot again come into use, the liturgies of Sarum,\r\nLincoln, and York.[57] During Edward’s reign, no royal action was taken\r\nin regard to censorship.\r\n\r\n_1555._ _Philip and Mary._ In this year was issued a “proclamation by\r\nthe King and Queen” “for the restraining of all Books and Writings,\r\ntending against the Doctrine of the Pope and his Church.” The\r\nproclamation grounds itself upon a statute of the second year of Henry\r\nIV, and condemns, usually simply with the name of the author, a number\r\nof reformers, both foreign and English. Among the English works is\r\nincluded the Chronicle of Hall. The “Proclamation” bears the imprint of\r\nJohn Cawood.\r\n\r\n_1556._ _The papal Legate, Cardinal Pole_, publishes a\r\n“Reformation-Decree” in which are included the regulations of the\r\n_Bulla Coenae_. It is further ordered that the bishops should\r\narrange for the examination of the booksellers’ shops, and for the\r\nconfiscation and destruction of all heretical writings.[58]\r\n\r\n_1557._ _An edict of the convocation of the province of Canterbury_\r\nrepeats and confirms the royal condemnation. In 1558 (the last year of\r\nthe reign of Mary), is issued a further proclamation worded as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “BY THE KING AND QUEEN.\r\n\r\n   Whereas divers Books, filled with Heresie, Sedition, and\r\n   Treason, have of late, and be dayly brought into this Realm out\r\n   of foreign Countries and places beyond the seas, and some also\r\n   covertly printed within this Realm, and cast abroad in sundry\r\n   parts thereof, whereby not only God is dishonoured, but also an\r\n   encouragement given to disoby lawfull Princes and Governors;\r\n   the King and Queen’s Majesties, for redress hereof, do, by this\r\n   present Proclamation, declare and publish to all their subjects,\r\n   that whosoever shall, after the proclaiming hereof, be found\r\n   to have any of the said wicked and seditious Books, or finding\r\n   them, do not forthwith burn the same without shewing or reading\r\n   the same to any other person, shall in that case be reputed and\r\n   taken for a Rebel, and shall without delay be executed for that\r\n   offence, according to the order of martial law.\r\n\r\n   “Given at our Manor of Saint James the sixth day of June. John\r\n   Cawood, Printer.”\r\n\r\n_1558._ _Queen Mary_, in a proclamation issued in this (the last)\r\nyear of her reign, orders put into force the provisions of the _Bulla\r\nCoenae_ and of the Fifth Lateran Council, and declares that all persons\r\nshall be treated as rebels and punished under the penalties of martial\r\nlaw who distribute or possess copies of godless or heretical books,\r\nsuch as have been wrongfully brought in from foreign lands. With the\r\ndeath of the Queen, later in the same year, these orders were revoked\r\nby Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe author whose name appears most frequently in these English Indexes\r\nis William Tyndale (alias Hichins). His translation of the New\r\nTestament was first printed in Cologne in 1525, and was reissued later\r\nin a great number of editions.\r\n\r\nIn 1563 was issued under the title of _The Acts and Monuments of the\r\nChurch_ a book generally known as Fox’s _Book of Martyrs_. This\r\nwork exercised probably a larger influence than any book of the century\r\nin completing the conversion of England from Romanism to Protestantism,\r\nan influence which continued through the following centuries.\r\n\r\n_1564._ _Queen Elizabeth_ instructs the Bishop of London to cause\r\nthorough examinations to be made of the cargoes of incoming ships, and\r\nto confiscate and destroy copies of slanderous and seditious books.[59]\r\n\r\n_1586._ _Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury_, authorises a bookseller\r\nnamed Ascanius de Renialme to import copies of certain popish books,\r\nwith the restriction that these copies are to be carefully reserved\r\nfor the use of the Archbishop himself and of the members of the Privy\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the censorship control in England over the\r\nproductions of the press and the importation and sale of books\r\nwas from the outset exercised under the direct authority of the\r\nCrown. The bishops were utilised for counsel and also, through the\r\nparish organisation of their dioceses, for the enforcement of the\r\ncensorship and of the penalties. A little later, the machinery of\r\nthe Stationers’ Company, to which was given the practical control of\r\nthe printing-press, was employed for carrying out the policy of the\r\nCrown in the restriction of the works printed and for enforcing the\r\nregulations against delinquents. It is probable that these censorship\r\nregulations of the English Crown were carried out more effectively\r\nthan was found possible for the similar regulations of the Church in\r\nFrance, in Germany, or in Italy. In Spain alone did the Church succeed\r\nin securing and for centuries in maintaining an absolute control over\r\nprinting, publishing, and book-distribution.\r\n\r\n_1588._ _Queen Elizabeth_ issues a proclamation forbidding, under\r\nsevere penalties, the printing of schismatic, seditious, slanderous,\r\nor fantastic works; existing copies of such works (the determination\r\nof their character appears to have been left to the bishops) must\r\nbe delivered to the bishops for destruction.[60] Among the titles\r\nspecified of seditious books thus to be destroyed is that of a pamphlet\r\nentitled _The Gaping Gulf_, which had to do with the scheme for the\r\nmarriage of the Queen with the Duke of Anjou.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. Regulations in the Netherlands for the Supervision of Books,\r\n1521–1550.=--Between the years 1521 and 1550, a series of ordinances\r\nfor the regulation of the printing-press which were issued under the\r\ninstructions of Charles V, were published in the form of placards\r\nthroughout the Provinces. The regulations became each year more severe.\r\nThese ordinances were confirmed and strengthened by Philip II.\r\n\r\n_1522._ _Charles V_ gives a special permit to Franz van der Hulst to\r\npossess and to read books by Luther and by other heretics, for the\r\npurpose of refuting their heresies. The regulations and orders above\r\nspecified are, it may be noted, issued under the sole authority of\r\nthe Emperor. There is no reference to the _Bulla Coenae_ or to any\r\nother papal utterances. The prohibitions concerning literature issued\r\nby the theological faculty of Louvain are based upon the authority and\r\ninstructions not of the pope, but of the Emperor. With the introduction\r\ninto the Netherlands of the Inquisition, however, the pope begins to\r\ntake part in the supervision of literature.\r\n\r\n_1522._ _Charles V_ appoints Van der Hulst as Inquisitor. He is\r\nconfirmed by Adrian VI with the proviso that, as Van der Hulst is a\r\nlayman, he must have two ecclesiastics as assessors. The succeeding\r\ninquisitors, who were all ecclesiastics, were in like manner appointed\r\nby the emperor or by the stadtholder and confirmed by the pope. Several\r\nof the edicts of Charles contain prohibitions of special books.\r\n\r\n_1524._ An ordinance orders the delivery, for destruction, of copies of\r\nheretical books, under penalty of confiscation of goods and corporal\r\npunishment. In 1526, was added the penalty of banishment, and in 1529,\r\nthat of death.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the time speak of frequent bonfires of masses of\r\nconfiscated books. In 1526, it was ordered that no book should be\r\nprinted or imported without a permit from the imperial commissioner.\r\nThe penalty for delinquents was banishment and confiscation of one\r\nthird of their property.[61]\r\n\r\n_1524,--March._ _An imperial edict_ states that, notwithstanding\r\nthe previous edicts forbidding the sale of heretical books, certain\r\nprinters are again bringing before the public reprints of these with\r\nthe excuse that they do not bear the name of Luther but are issued\r\nunder such titles as _Evangelium_ or _Summa Theologiae_. Specially\r\nforbidden are an edition of the _Gospel of St. Matthew_ with notes\r\nby Johann Pelt, and a treatise by the same author called _The Sum of\r\nGodliness_.\r\n\r\n_1526._ _An imperial edict_ orders to be confiscated and burned all\r\ncopies of writings of Luther, Pomeranus, Carolostadius, Melanchthon,\r\nOecolampadius, Lambertus, and Jonas, and of versions in the vernacular\r\nof the Gospels and Epistles and all books which support the Lutheran\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n_1529._ It was ordered that, while all books required a permit from the\r\nCrown, those dealing with matters of faith must also be approved by the\r\nbishop. Whoever prints an heretical book is to be exposed on a scaffold\r\nand then branded by a hot iron with the mark of the cross, or he is to\r\nlose either an eye or a hand.[62]\r\n\r\n_1529._ _An imperial edict_ prohibits the printing, distribution,\r\npossession, etc., of the writings of Luther, Wyclif, Huss, Marsilius,\r\nOecolampadius, Zwingli, Melanchthon, Lambert, Pomeranus, Brunfels,\r\nJonas, and all other “sectarians”; also the Testaments as printed by de\r\nBerghes, von Redmonde, Zell, and others, which had been condemned as\r\nheretical by the faculty of Louvain, all books printed during the past\r\nten years which did not bear the name of author and name and address of\r\nthe printer, and finally all pictures tending to bring dishonour upon\r\nthe Virgin or the Saints.\r\n\r\n_1540._ _An imperial edict_ prohibits a much longer series of books,\r\nthe list including, in addition to the Lutheran writers, histories of\r\nGermany, and editions of certain books of Aristotle, and a number of\r\nissues of the Scriptures. The lists in these earlier prohibitions were\r\nevidently utilised later in the Indexes of Louvain, as some of the\r\nmisprints of names are repeated.\r\n\r\nReusch mentions that the city of Antwerp secured as a privilege from\r\nthe emperor an order forbidding the arrest within its walls of any\r\nprinter or bookseller. In cases in which the regulations had been\r\ndisobeyed, the delinquents were safe from arrest unless they could be\r\nenticed outside the city.[63]\r\n\r\n_1546._ It is ordered that the record of the permit must be printed in\r\neach copy of the book, and before copies can be offered for sale the\r\nprinted text must be compared with that of the manuscript as approved.\r\n\r\n_1550._ It is ordered that if a book has been printed without a permit,\r\nbut is found on examination to contain nothing pernicious, the printer\r\nis simply condemned to banishment for life, first making payment of a\r\nfine of 300 _caroli_. The possession or the reading of heretical books\r\nwas in itself sufficient evidence of heresy. A person found guilty of\r\nheresy was permitted, for a first offence, to purge himself of his\r\nsin by recantation. If the delinquent persisted in his heresy, the\r\npenalty, under the edicts of 1529 and 1531, was for men, beheading, for\r\nwomen, burial alive. Heretics who had recanted and later relapsed were\r\nburned.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Regulations in France, 1521–1551, concerning the Production and\r\nthe Use of Books.=--It was the case in France as in England that the\r\ncontrol of the supervision of the printing-presses and of the business\r\nof book-distribution rested from the outset with the Crown; and that\r\nas far as regulations were framed by the theological faculty of the\r\nSorbonne or by the bishops, this was done under the authority and\r\ninstructions of the king. In France, however, another division of the\r\ntemporal power, namely, the Parliament of Paris, undertakes from time\r\nto time the publication of regulations for the control of the press,\r\nor for the prohibition of books already in print; but by the close of\r\nthe 16th century this independent action on the part of the Parliament\r\ncomes to an end; Thereafter the orders concerning books are based on\r\nthe sole authority of the king, and are, as a rule, issued by the royal\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\n_1521._ _Francis I_ issues an edict, framed at the instance of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, prohibiting the printing of any new works, either\r\nin Latin or in French, having to do with matters of faith or with the\r\nScriptures, until the texts had been examined and approved by the\r\ntheological faculty.[65]\r\n\r\n_1528._ _A Provincial Council, held at Sens_, acting under the\r\ninstructions of the King (Francis I), issues a decree forbidding the\r\npossession of copies of the writings of Luther and his followers. There\r\nis also a prohibition of the reading or the circulation of any works on\r\nreligious subjects which do not bear record of a permit from the bishop.\r\n\r\n_1528._ _A Provincial Council at Bourges_ issues a decree which is in\r\nits wording precisely identical with the above. It is probable that\r\nthey were both prepared in Paris.\r\n\r\n_1530._ _The King gives_ orders for the appointment of certain\r\ninquisitors of literature. The first group comprises two magistrates\r\nselected from the Parliament of Paris, and two divines selected by the\r\nCollege of the Sorbonne. This commission bears, in addition to the\r\nauthority of the Crown and the instructions of the Parliament (which\r\nis, it must be borne in mind, a high court of justice), an instruction\r\nfrom the Archbishop of Paris to take measures for the repression of\r\nheretical literature. The lists of the prohibited and of the permitted\r\nor privileged books were published under the authority of the officials\r\nof the Parliament by the guild of printer-publishers. The scholarship\r\nof the divines of the Sorbonne was called upon by the Parliament for\r\nthe determination of questions of heresy in doctrinal and religious\r\nworks, a course which had the natural result of bringing upon the\r\ncollege an increasing measure of influence in the shaping of the\r\nIndexes and in the control of book-production.\r\n\r\n_1542._ _The Parliament of Paris_ issues an order prohibiting the\r\nprinting of any book without the approval of the rector of the\r\nuniversity and the deans, and directing the rector to appoint two\r\nmembers of each faculty to conduct the examination of the books\r\nsubmitted. It was added later that, for Bibles and works of religion,\r\nthe signatures of not less than four doctors of divinity were to be\r\nrequired. In the same year, it was ordered that all bales of books\r\narriving in Paris must be opened in the presence of four of the\r\ncertified book-dealers (_libraires jurés_) and examined by the divines\r\nappointed by the rector. The examiners were to supply to the royal\r\nprocurator a list of the books the sale of which was authorised. The\r\nselling of any books the titles of which were not included in the list,\r\nwas forbidden under severe penalties.[66]\r\n\r\n_1542._ _The Parliament of Paris_ issues an order to the Sorbonne to\r\nprepare a catalogue of prohibited books. No copies of this catalogue\r\nhave been preserved, but the Paris collection contains a copy of the\r\nsupplement issued in March, 1543. This presents sixty-five titles, put\r\ntogether without any order, chiefly of works by well-known German and\r\nFrench reformers, printed in Latin and in French, together with a few\r\nanonymous French books. This catalogue, while the work of scholarly\r\ncompilers, is described by Reusch as full of blunders.[67]\r\n\r\n_1544._ _The Faculty of the Sorbonne_ issues an alphabetical catalogue\r\nof all the books which it had thus far condemned.\r\n\r\n_1547._ This catalogue is reprinted with a supplement of forty-seven\r\ntitles, the last Index compiled under the direction of the college.\r\n\r\n_1548._ _The Inquisitor of Toulouse, Vidal de Becanis_, places his\r\n“privilege” on an Index the names of the compilers of which do not\r\nappear. The introduction denounces as heretics the persons who, during\r\nthe past three years, have read, possessed, bought, sold, bound, or\r\nprinted the books specified in the following lists; and condemns to\r\nexcommunication all who, after the publication of the Index, fail\r\nto deliver for destruction existing copies, or who protect persons\r\nconcealing copies. The catalogue contains ninety-two titles, which are\r\nin their wording badly confused and misprinted. A few instances are\r\ncited by Fréville:\r\n\r\nMartini Lutheti (for Luther); Vulpici Zironga (for Zwingli). Of\r\ntwenty-one authors, the complete works are condemned, etc. For Erasmus,\r\nthe list covers seventeen titles. The prohibition covers Latin or\r\nFrench Bibles or Testaments, and the possessors of such are to be\r\ndenounced.[68]\r\n\r\n_1551._ _Henry II_, in an edict issued at Chateaubriand and duly\r\nrecorded in Parliament, prohibits the importation of any books printed\r\nin Geneva or in any other towns which had fallen away from the Church.\r\nNo books recorded in the prohibited lists of the Sorbonne could be\r\nprinted, sold, or owned. Only those persons were permitted to possess\r\ncopies to whom had been given canonical permission for the reading of\r\nheretical works. The printers must record their names and their work\r\ncould be carried on only in certain specified places. Bales of books\r\ncoming in from abroad must be opened in the presence of two deputies\r\nfrom the theological faculty or of two magistrates. Twice a year,\r\nthese same deputies must inspect the bookshops. In Lyons, which was\r\na great dépôt for imported books, the shops were inspected not less\r\nthan three times a year, the inspectors including the archbishop and\r\nthe seneschal. Every bookshop must carry in evidence a copy of the\r\nprohibitory catalogue of the Sorbonne, and corrected lists of the books\r\nin stock. Colporteurs (_portepanniers_) were not permitted to sell\r\nbooks, their printed stock being restricted to broadsides or single\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\n_1551._ _The Parliament of Paris_ orders the reprinting, with\r\nadditions, of the Sorbonne Index of 1544. The compilers of this appear\r\nto have done their work without reference to that of the editors of\r\nthe Louvain Indexes. The Paris lists were utilised both in Venice\r\nand in Rome. In the reprint of the supplementary Index of 1547, the\r\nintroduction speaks of the united efforts of the king, the Parliament,\r\nand the faculty of the Sorbonne to protect the realm against the\r\npernicious assaults of heretical literature. Reference is made to\r\nthe insidious forms in which heretical teachings are presented, in\r\nanonymous books, in volumes bearing no name of publisher or printer, or\r\nplace of imprint, in volumes bearing, falsely, the names of orthodox\r\nCatholic writers. A book full of heretical blasphemies had, for\r\nexample, been issued under the title of _Confessio Fidei per Natalem\r\nBedam_ (possibly meant for the Protestant Doctor Noel Beda). Another\r\n“godless treatise” is called _Proverbia Salomonis_, etc.[69]\r\n\r\nAmong the authors whose works appear in these Paris Indexes may be\r\nnoted the following: Erasmus, Jo. Ferus, Polydorus Vergil (editions\r\nof whom had been issued by Stephanus), Louis de Berquin, Estienne\r\nDolet (who was executed for heresy in 1556), Faber Stapulensis, Beda,\r\nFrançois Rabelais, a “Benedictine monk who finally became pastor at\r\nMeudon.” One would hardly recognise under this catalogue description\r\nthe creator of Gargantua and Pantagruel, while it is not at all\r\nsurprising that the narrative of the doings of these two world’s heroes\r\nshould have been found deserving of a place on the Index. The book of\r\nPantagruel, which was first printed anonymously in 1533, was reprinted\r\nin 1546 with the name of its author. It was placed on the Index of the\r\nSorbonne in 1553, and in the same year was condemned in the official\r\nlist of the Parliament. In 1554, however, at the instance of the\r\nCardinal de Châtillon, Henry II cancelled the prohibition. In the Roman\r\nIndex, Rabelais stands in the first class, but is recorded under the\r\nterm “Rabletius.”[70]\r\n\r\nThe various editions of the Scriptures brought into print by Robertus\r\nStephanus (Estienne), many of which included notes and commentaries\r\nby the scholarly publisher, were all condemned by the Sorbonne as\r\nheretical. As long, however, as Francis I lived, the condemnation was\r\nnot put into force. These Bibles also find place in the Louvain Index\r\nof 1546, which was reprinted in Paris in 1548 under the instructions of\r\nthe Sorbonne. In 1548, the opponents of Stephanus were able to secure\r\nfrom Henry II an order for the enforcement of their censorship of his\r\nBibles. The publisher thereupon migrated to Geneva, and was able in his\r\nmasterly retreat to carry with him across the frontier his fonts of\r\ntype and some portions at least of the editions of the Bibles and other\r\noffending books which had been ordered to be delivered to the officials\r\nof the Sorbonne for their burning.\r\n\r\n_1557._ _Francis I_ arranges with the Pope, Paul IV, for the\r\nappointment as Inquisitors-General of the Cardinals Lorraine, Bourbon,\r\nand Châtillon, to whom was confided the supervision, under royal\r\nauthority, of the inspection of books.\r\n\r\n_1559._ _The Parliament_ orders all those possessing doctor’s degrees\r\nto report to the faculty of the college the titles of heretical or\r\nsuspicious books.\r\n\r\n_1562._ _The Parliament_ again orders the college to compile an\r\nIndex, but the work was never completed.[71] Under royal edicts, the\r\nprohibitions in the catalogues of the Sorbonne were made binding on all\r\ncitizens. A further evidence that the final authority in the matter of\r\ncensorship was retained by the State, is the order issued in 1546 by\r\nFrancis I that the Bibles of Robert Estienne were not to be included in\r\nthe Sorbonne Indexes. Another example is a notice which Espencé had\r\nsucceeded in having attached to the orders of 1547, directing that the\r\nprohibition should not be enforced in the case of two books the titles\r\nof which were already on the list of books condemned by the Sorbonne.\r\nThe Index of 1544 comprises five divisions: _a_, works in Latin, by\r\nknown authors, arranged alphabetically; _b_, anonymous works in Latin;\r\n_c_, works in French by known authors; _d_, anonymous works in French;\r\n_e_, French versions of the Scriptures. The lists include no writers\r\nof whom all the works are condemned (Class I of the Roman Indexes).\r\nAmong the better known names may be mentioned: Erasmus, Faber, Ferus,\r\nPeter Martyr, Wyclif, Huss, Corvinus, Osiander, etc. An introduction to\r\nthe fifth part emphasises the peril of placing in the hands of simple\r\nand unscholarly readers versions in the vernacular of the Scriptures,\r\nand refers to the evil results produced with such heretics as the\r\nWaldenses, the Albigenses, and the like.\r\n\r\nIn 1562, there is record of the seizure at some French port by M. de\r\nBourbon of a collection of wine casks packed with books which had\r\nbeen sent from Germany, and which Bourbon found to be of the “most\r\ndistressing character.” These books the lieutenant consigned to the\r\nflames, having apparently taken the responsibility of himself acting as\r\ncensor.[72]\r\n\r\n_1577._ _Henry III_ issues an edict modifying, in behalf of the\r\nProtestants, the regulations of the edict of Chateaubriand. No books\r\nare to be sold without the permit of the local magistrates, or as far\r\nas concerns the works of the adherents of the so-called reformed\r\nreligion, without the approval of special commissioners to be appointed\r\nby Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n=5. Regulations in Spain, 1521–1551, concerning the Production and\r\nthe Use of Books.=\r\n\r\n_1521. March 20._ _Leo X_, in a brief addressed to the High Constable,\r\nthe Admiral of Castile, and Cardinal Adrian (who constituted at the\r\ntime the government of Spain), orders that measures may be taken to\r\nprevent the importation into the country of the pernicious writings of\r\nLuther and his followers. The cardinal issues an order in the same year\r\nfor the confiscation and destruction of all such works.\r\n\r\n_1522._ _Cardinal Adrian_ issues a second order, calling for the\r\ndelivery for destruction of all books by the Reformers of Germany,\r\nunder severe penalties for persons withholding or concealing copies.\r\nBefore the close of the same year, Adrian becomes pope.\r\n\r\n_1530._ _Manrique, Archbishop of Seville_, and Inquisitor General,\r\nconfirms the ordinance of 1521, with some sharpening of the penalties\r\nfor non-obedience. He cautions the faithful that certain Lutheran books\r\nare being circulated under false titles and that pernicious Lutheran\r\nnotes have been printed in editions of works by good Catholics.\r\nThe inquisitors are ordered to search libraries and bookshops. The\r\nauthority to give permits for the printing of books is placed in the\r\nhands of the higher Council of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\n_1531._ _The Inquisitor General_ authorises the inquisitors to\r\nexcommunicate persons who disregard the regulations, who possess or\r\nread copies of such books, or who fail to denounce others.\r\n\r\n_1541._ _The Inquisitor General_ prohibits the inquisitors from\r\ngranting permission for the possession or reading of forbidden books.\r\nEven the Counsellors of the Inquisition (under whose advice the lists\r\nof heretical books were prepared) are forbidden to read the same.[73]\r\n\r\n_1543._ _Charles V_ issues an edict for the control of books, etc.,\r\nin his American possessions. The printing, the importation, and the\r\nreading of novels and romances is forbidden.\r\n\r\n_1550._ _The Bull of Julius III_, recalling all outstanding permissions\r\nfor the reading of forbidden books, is published as authoritative for\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n_1550._ _Charles V_ orders that the book-dealers in Seville must make\r\nregistry before a royal official of the titles of all books planned for\r\nexport to the colonies and must take oath that the schedules contain\r\nnothing prohibited.\r\n\r\n_1556._ _Philip II_ forbids the printing of any works about America\r\nuntil a permit has been secured from the Indian Council.[74]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Regulations in Germany concerning Books, 1521–1555.\r\n\r\n_1521, May 8._ _An edict of the Emperor_ (_Charles V_) forbids the\r\nprinting, selling, buying, owning, copying, or reading any of the\r\nwritings, already condemned by the pope, of “that stubborn heretic\r\nMartin Luther,” and any further works that said Luther may produce. The\r\nprohibition is made to cover also all other books, tracts, and pictures\r\nwhich are antagonistic to the Faith of the Church and to good morality,\r\nand all writings which are designed to bring into disrepute the pope,\r\nor the other dignitaries of the Church, or princes, universities,\r\nmembers of faculties, or other persons of repute. The penalties are\r\nthose previously ordered by the Church, the ban and the interdict.[75]\r\nIt is further ordered that thereafter no one shall print or sell books\r\nhaving to do with the Bible, or with matters of faith, without a\r\nspecific permit from the bishop or from the theological faculty of the\r\nproper university. The responsibility for the framing of this imperial\r\nordinance rested with Aleander[76]. This Edict of Worms secured\r\nacceptance and enforcement only in certain portions of Germany.\r\n\r\n_1523._ _The Imperial Diet of Nuremberg_, in place of making full\r\nconfirmation of the Edict of Worms, simply orders that no new writings\r\nshall be printed or sold until they have been tested and approved by\r\ntrustworthy men. The printing and selling of libellous books (_libelli\r\nfamosi_) is forbidden under heavy penalties.[77]\r\n\r\n_1530._ _The Diet of Augsburg_ receives, through Campeggio, a\r\nbrief from Pope Leo ordering strong measures to be taken for the\r\nenforcement of the Bull and of the provisions of the Decree of Worms\r\nagainst Lutheran writings. The Pope calls for imperial regulations to\r\nsecure the destruction of all copies of such books together with the\r\npunishment of all persons concealing copies, and the rewarding of those\r\nwho give information of concealed heretical books. The Diet declines\r\nhowever to do more than to renew the regulations for the examination of\r\nbooks to be printed and the licensing of those that can be approved.[78]\r\n\r\n_1549–1550._ _A Provincial Synod held at Cologne_ under the\r\ninstructions of the Archbishop, Adolphus von Schauenburg, issues an\r\nedict for the protection more particularly of “simple and unlearned\r\npastors who are not competent to distinguish pernicious literature\r\nfrom sound teaching,” forbidding all the faithful under penalty\r\nof the Anathema, from reading the works of Luther, Bucer, Calvin,\r\nŒcolampadius, Bullinger, Lambert, Melanchthon, Corvinus, Sarcerius,\r\nBrentius, and some dozen other heretical writers. The edict promises\r\nthe publication shortly of a comprehensive catalogue of heretical and\r\npernicious literature, but such catalogue was never prepared. This\r\npreliminary list may be classed as the first German Index of prohibited\r\nbooks, the next in order of date being that published in 1582, in\r\nMunich.\r\n\r\n_1555._ _The Augsburger Pact_ provides that the penalties specified in\r\nthe papal regulations concerning books, etc., are to be enforced only\r\nin the territories classed as Catholic.\r\n\r\n_1570._ _The Diet of Speyer_ orders that printing offices are to be\r\nlicensed only in imperial cities, court cities, and university towns\r\nand each printer must be duly placed under oath (_vereidet_) to uphold\r\nthe imperial regulations.[79] The Imperial Police Regulations repeat\r\nthe instructions of the Diet of Augsburg, with the modification that\r\nnothing was to be printed contrary to the Christian religion or to the\r\nReligious Pact of Augsburg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                  PAPAL CENSORSHIP BEFORE THE INDEXES\r\n\r\n    1. Earlier papal utterances concerning the writings\r\n            of the Reformation                           1487–1521.\r\n\r\n    2. The Bull _Coenae Domini_                          1364–1586.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Earlier Papal Utterances Concerning the Writings of the\r\nReformation, 1487–1521.=\r\n\r\n_1487._ _Papal Bull._ In 1487 was issued the first papal Bull having to\r\ndo with the productions of the printing-press. It is entitled: _Bulla\r\nS. D. N. Innocentii contra Impressores Librorum Reprobatorum_, and was\r\naddressed by Pope Innocent VIII to seven “governments” as follows:\r\nRomana, Curia, Italia, Germania, Francia, Hispania, Anglia, and Scotia.\r\nThe opening paragraph reads: “And, therefore, we who hold on earth the\r\nplace of Him who came down from heaven to enlighten the minds of men\r\nand to disperse the darkness of error,” etc.\r\n\r\n_1516._ _Council of the Lateran._ The fifth Council of the Lateran,\r\nassembled in Rome, in 1516, under Leo X, adopted, with but one\r\ndissenting voice, a papal constitution which recited the injury to\r\nfaith, morals, and public peace arising from the increasing number of\r\nbooks containing doctrines contrary to religion, or libellous attacks\r\non individuals. It was ordered that thereafter no books should be\r\nprinted without a preliminary examination and license. In Rome, the\r\nauthority rested with the papal vicar and with the master of the palace\r\nand elsewhere with the bishop and inquisitor. The duties of censorship\r\nwere thus shared between the bishops and the Inquisition. The former,\r\nas a rule, were engrossed with temporal cares and were negligent, and\r\nas Lea points out, there is no trace of their discharging in Spain\r\nthe functions thus imposed on them. The inquisitors were active and\r\naggressive, eager to extend their jurisdiction, and they formed the\r\nmost convenient instrumentality to be utilised by the Church and the\r\nState for curbing the licentiousness of the press.[80]\r\n\r\n_1518, August 9._ _Hieronymus, Bishop of Ascoli_ and Auditor of\r\nthe Apostolic Chamber, who had been charged by the pope with the\r\ninvestigation of the case of Luther, ordered Luther to report to Rome.\r\nLater, the papal Legate, Cardinal Thomas de Vio (Cajetanus), was\r\nordered to give a hearing to Luther, with the further instruction that\r\nif Luther were recalcitrant he was to be arrested. In case he evaded\r\narrest, he and his supporters were to be excommunicated, and the places\r\nin which he secured protection were to be placed under interdict.[81]\r\nThese instructions were in the main based upon alleged heresies\r\ncontained in the treatises and propositions that Luther had, up to that\r\ndate, brought before the public, although these treatises were not\r\nreferred to by name.\r\n\r\n_1518, Nov._ _Pope Leo_ issues a Bull addressed to Cardinal Cajetan on\r\nthe subject of absolution. In the Bull, Luther’s name is not mentioned.\r\n\r\n_1519._ _The Theological Faculties of Cologne and Louvain_ condemn a\r\ncollection of Luther’s writings (which includes the ninety-five theses\r\nand the sermons on absolution, etc.) and order all copies to be burned.\r\n\r\n_1520, June 15._ _Leo_ issues the Bull _Exurge_, in which the Pope\r\nstates that, after careful consideration with cardinals and other\r\ntheologians, he pronounces to be heretical, false, and pernicious,\r\nforty-three propositions contained in the writings of Martin\r\nLuther;--and therefore are condemned all books, tracts, and sermons\r\nof said Luther, and all citations from the same. It is forbidden to\r\nprint, sell, distribute, read, or possess copies or to quote them, and\r\nall existing copies are to be burned. The penalty for disobedience is\r\nexcommunication _latae sententiae_.\r\n\r\n_1520, July._ _Pope Leo_ in a brief to Cardinal Albert, Archbishop\r\nof Mayence, calls attention to the pernicious and shameless writings\r\nof Ulrich von Hutten, which were being put into print in Mayence in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the bishop’s palace, and orders the\r\nCardinal to take strong measures for their suppression. The Archbishop\r\nreplies that he has put the printers in prison, but that he can do\r\nnothing against the author, who is securely entrenched in his castle\r\nwith a strong body of retainers. The work chiefly complained of was the\r\ntreatise _De Unitate Ecclesiae_. This appears in the Index of Paul IV,\r\nand in the succeeding Indexes.\r\n\r\n_1521, Jany. 3._ _Pope Leo_ issues the Bull _Decet Romanum Pontificem_,\r\nconfirming the penalty of excommunication for Luther and his followers.\r\n\r\n_1521.,_ _The Faculty of the Sorbonne_ publishes a similar condemnation.\r\n\r\n_1521, April 18._ _Pope Leo_ sends a brief to Cardinal Wolsey directing\r\nhim to carry out the orders for the burning of copies of Luther’s\r\nwritings. The Cardinal had evidently delayed the promulgation of the\r\nBull _Exurge_. The Pope sends Wolsey a copy of Luther’s treatise on the\r\nBabylonian captivity, with the remark that not only the book but the\r\nauthor ought to be burned. Thereupon Wolsey, in his capacity as legate,\r\nafter consideration with the Archbishop of Canterbury, and with the\r\napproval of the king, orders the destruction of all copies of Luther’s\r\nwritings to be found in England.[82]\r\n\r\n_1520, June 12._ _Pope Leo_ orders a formal burning in Rome of the\r\navailable copies of Luther’s writings. With these was burned an effigy\r\nof Luther himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. The Bull Coenae Domini, 1364–1586.=--The Bull of the Lord’s Supper\r\npresents a collection of the various excommunications which had been\r\nordered by successive popes against certain specified classes of\r\npersons, and also against certain individuals on the ground of heresy.\r\nIn its original wording, it dates from Urban V in 1364,[83] but the\r\nform in use through the period of the Reformation was given by Julius\r\nII in 1511. Less important changes were made by later popes. Julius\r\nII specifies as under excommunication a number of heretical sects,\r\nincluding the Wyclifites or Hussites. The schedule reads: _Patarenos,\r\nPauperes de Lugduno, Arnaldistas, Speronistas, Passagenos, Wiclifitas\r\nseu Hussitas, Fraticellos de Opinione nuncupatos, et quoscumque alios\r\nhaereticos ac omnes fautores_.[84]\r\n\r\n_1517._ _Leo X_ prohibits, under penalty of the _ex latae sententiae_,\r\nthe further printing of the _editio princeps_ of the first five\r\nbooks of the History of Tacitus, which had been published by Philip\r\nBeroaldus in 1516, under a Milan privilege.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the Casuists in regard to the effect of the\r\nprohibitions in the _Bulla Coenae_ are summarised as follows by\r\nFerraris[85]: In order that the reading of a book shall bring upon the\r\ndelinquent the threatened excommunication,\r\n\r\n1st. The book must be the production of an actual heretic (not merely\r\nof one not baptised, or of a Catholic who through heedlessness or\r\nignorance has given utterance to heresy);\r\n\r\n2d. It must contain a heresy, or must have to do with religious matters;\r\n\r\n3d. The reader must have knowledge that the book is the work of a\r\nheretic, and contains heresy or treats of religion;\r\n\r\n4th. The reading must have been done without the permission of the\r\nApostolic Chair;\r\n\r\n5th. The reading must be sufficient in amount to constitute a mortal\r\nsin. This amount has naturally been variously defined, so as to cover\r\nthe entire work (Sanchez) or a single page, or two lines (Toletus). [86]\r\n\r\nA Bull of Pius IX makes some modification in these regulations. The\r\nexcommunication (reserved as papal) comes into effect through the\r\nreading of works which are written by heretics or apostates, or\r\nwhich present or defend heresy. But this would not exclude weekly\r\nor daily periodicals which might in some of their columns contain\r\npernicious matter. Books produced by writers outside of the Church are\r\nheld as less pernicious than the works of Catholics who have become\r\nFree-Thinkers, Rationalists, or Spiritualists, and who are, therefore,\r\nto be classed as apostates.[87]\r\n\r\nFrom the middle of the 16th century, there are instances of public\r\nprotest and of action on the part of political rulers against the\r\npromulgation of the _Bulla Coenae_ or the enforcement of its penalties.\r\nIn 1536, a commentary by the jurist Pierre Reboeuf on the Bull was\r\nconfiscated in Paris. In 1551, Charles V prohibits the printing of the\r\nBull in Spain. In 1568 Philip II confirms this prohibition, and asks\r\nthe pope to recall the Bull as far as Spain was concerned. In 1570, the\r\npublication of the Bull is forbidden in Naples. In 1568, the Senate of\r\nVenice forbids the publication; but in 1570 the Council of Ten permits\r\nthe reading of the Bull in the churches on Maundy Thursday. In 1582,\r\nPhilip II prohibits the publication in Portugal. In 1580, Henry III\r\nprohibits the publication in France. In 1586, Rudolph II prohibits the\r\npublication in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia.\r\n\r\n_1524._ _Adrian VI_ adds “and Martin Luther, and all who read, listen\r\nto, distribute, or possess his writings, or defend the teachings in the\r\nsame.”\r\n\r\n_1536._ _Paul III_, in a reissue of the _Bulla Coenae Domini_, adds\r\nthe words: “We excommunicate and anathematise ... all heretics, the\r\nKathareni, the Patareni ... who are followers of the godless and\r\nabominable heresies of Martin Luther, condemned by Leo X, and all who\r\nfavour or protect him in any way, and all who read or distribute the\r\nwritings of said Martin.”\r\n\r\n_1583._ _Gregory XIII_, in a Bull issued April 4th, modifies this\r\n_Passus_ to the form which is followed in the later Bulls:\r\n\r\n   “We excommunicate ... all Hussites, Wyclifites, Lutherans,\r\n   Zwinglians, Calvinists, Huguenots, Anabaptists,\r\n   (anti)-Trinitarians, and all heretics of whatever name or sect,\r\n   and their followers (_eorum credentes_) and protectors, and\r\n   all those who print, distribute, possess, or read the writings\r\n   of these heretics, or any books which attempt to undermine the\r\n   authority of the Apostolic Chair,” etc.\r\n\r\nSince Julius II (1503) it is ordered[88] in the Bull that it shall\r\nbe formally promulgated by all bishops once each year. Gregory XIII\r\ndirects all pastors and confessors to keep copies for diligent study.\r\nThe day selected is usually the Thursday before Easter (Maundy\r\nThursday).\r\n\r\nThe excommunication which is made applicable to heretical writings\r\nis, for the most part, the _excommunicatio major_. This excludes the\r\ncondemned from the Sacraments, and from the holding of office (as under\r\nthe _excommunicatio minor_), and also excludes from public worship\r\nand from burial in consecrated ground; while it involves the loss of\r\nlegal rights. It is also, as a rule, _latae_ (instead of _ferendae_)\r\n_sententiae_, that is, its authority goes into effect at once, as a\r\nnecessary result of the sinful action, and without the requirement of\r\na judgment.[89] The Jesuit Faure states that, in the earlier ages of\r\nthe Church, the _censura latae sententiae_ was ordered but seldom,\r\nbut since the 13th century, the instances of its use had very largely\r\nincreased, and (in connection with the supervision of publications) had\r\nbecome almost a routine.\r\n\r\n_1770._ _Clement XIV_ orders that the yearly publication of the Bull be\r\ndiscontinued, but the Bull itself was not recalled or modified.\r\n\r\n_1869. Oct._ _Pius IX_ issues a Bull recalling or modifying certain of\r\nthe provisions of the _Coenae Domini_.[90]\r\n\r\nPeignot (writing in 1806) speaks of this as “an inconceivable Bull\r\nrejected by France and by nearly all of the Catholic States and very\r\nproperly condemned to eternal oblivion.” He goes on to say that\r\n“Rome no longer lays claim to the chimerical right of disposing\r\ncrowns and of controlling kings. It is to-day more sparing of those\r\ninvisible thunder-blasts which in times past have caused sovereigns to\r\ntremble.”[91]\r\n\r\nCardinal Erskine, speaking in 1815, declares the Bull to be\r\n“implicitly in vigour in all its extension,” and defines it as a\r\n“public declaration to preserve the rights of the Pope.” Dr. Sleven,\r\nthe Prefect of the Dunboyne Establishment, speaking in 1826, states\r\nthat “the publication of the Bull during the coming year is something\r\nentirely within the option of the Pope.”[92]\r\n\r\nCount Ferdinand dal Pozzo, a Roman Catholic, writing (in Vienna) in\r\n1825, says: “The reading of the Bull, originally ordered for every year\r\nat Rome on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday), was suspended by Clement\r\nXIV, to avoid giving offence to crowned heads.” Mendham,[93] in quoting\r\ndal Pozzo, points out that the Bull itself (which, he says “contains a\r\nseries of the most absurd pretensions) was not revoked. Permission is\r\nstill granted to absolve in the cases reserved in this Bull.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n       THE ROMAN INQUISITION AND THE CONGREGATION OF THE INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =The Institution of the Roman Inquisition, 1542.=--The year 1542\r\nmarks the beginning of formal regulations framed in Rome itself for\r\nthe suppression of heretical literature and for the supervision and\r\ncontrol of the work of the printers. The English catalogues of 1542\r\nand later, and the edicts of Charles V, published between 1526 and\r\n1540, while having for their expressed purpose the maintenance of\r\nthe doctrines of the Church, were issued under the authority of the\r\nState. These earlier censorship measures do not appear even to have\r\nbeen the result of any direct initiative or suggestion from Rome.\r\nIt may be remembered, indeed, that the _Bulla Coenae_ presents, in\r\nits successive forms, a very forcible expression of the policy of\r\nthe Church in regard to the spread of heresies through literature\r\nand of the intention of controlling the production and distribution\r\nof books, and this Bull in its original form (as issued by Urban V\r\nin 1364) antedates the operation of the printing-press by nearly\r\na century. But the formulation of the measures by which the fight\r\nagainst this perilous ally of heresy was to be carried on, had to wait\r\nfor the reorganisation, in 1542, of the Roman Inquisition, which\r\nreorganisation was the direct result of the revolt of Luther and his\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nIn the present study, I am concerned with the Inquisition only in\r\nso far as this was brought into direct relations with the work of\r\ncensorship. The Inquisition as an institution was not brought into\r\nexistence at any one date but had a gradual development. Lea refers to\r\nthe\r\n\r\n   “gradual organisation of the Inquisition as being the result of\r\n   an evolution arising from the mutual reaction of certain social\r\n   forces. The triumph of the Church in the suppression of the\r\n   Albigensian crusades had increased its responsibilities, while\r\n   the imperfection of the means at its command for discharging\r\n   these responsibilities was evidenced by the enormous spread of\r\n   heresy during the 12th century.”[94]\r\n\r\nThe responsibility for the discovery and the control of heresy had from\r\nthe earlier years of the Church rested in the hands of the bishops. For\r\nmany years after the central authorities undertook to exercise a direct\r\ncontrol over heresy and heretics by means of inquisitors appointed from\r\nRome, the bishops continued to enforce their own jurisdiction in the\r\nmatter of the trial of heretics, sometimes apart from the inquisitors\r\nand sometimes in conjunction with them. The spiritual courts which came\r\nto be attached to their episcopates, and which exercised exclusive\r\njurisdiction over a constantly widening jurisprudence, arose gradually\r\nduring the troubles that followed the division of the Carlovingian\r\nempire. All errors of faith and charges of heresy necessarily came\r\nwithin the purview of these spiritual courts.[95] Following in the\r\ntraces of the civil law, there were in these spiritual courts\r\nthree forms of action in criminal cases: _accusatio_, _denunciato_,\r\nand _inquisitio_. In _accusatio_ there was an accuser who formally\r\ninscribed himself as responsible and who in case of failure was\r\nsubject to the _taglio_. _Denunciatio_ was the official act of a\r\npublic officer, such as the archdeacon, who summoned the court to take\r\naction against the offenders coming within his official knowledge. In\r\n_inquisitio_, the Ordinary arrested the suspected criminal, imprisoning\r\nhim if necessary. The indictment, or _capitula inquisitionis_, was\r\ncommunicated to him and he was interrogated thereupon with the proviso\r\nthat nothing extraneous to the indictment could be subsequently\r\nbrought into the case to aggravate it. The verdict was finally\r\ngiven by the Ordinary. The first inquisitors may be considered as\r\nin a measure successors to the _Missi Dominici_ of Charlemagne,\r\nofficials commissioned to traverse the empire making inquisition into\r\nall cases of disorder, crime, and injustice. We find in Verona, in\r\n1228, “inquisitors” and “manifestors” employed by the State for the\r\n“detection and punishment of blasphemy.”[96] Under Clement, the bishops\r\nwere ordered to make diligent visitations throughout their dioceses\r\ninvestigating all offences, and with the growth of ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction, this inquisitorial duty was perfected and organised. In\r\n1227, the Council of Narbonne commanded all bishops to institute in\r\nevery parish _testes synodales_ who should investigate heresy and other\r\noffences.\r\n\r\nThe popes had endeavoured to overcome episcopal indifference to the\r\nmatter of heresy by a somewhat irregular “Legatine Inquisition.” It\r\nwould appear, however, as if up to the beginning of the 13th century\r\nthis whole business of the discovery and the correction of heresy had\r\nbeen cared for by the Church authorities in an unsystematic manner and\r\nwith no consistency of policy. The more conscientious and more forcible\r\nrulers of the Church recognised that heresy must be exterminated at\r\nwhatever cost, but the measures for its extermination proved to be\r\ndifficult to bring into organisation. “The institution of the mendicant\r\norders,” says Lea, “placed at the disposal of the Church groups of\r\nworkers who possessed exceptional facilities for the task to be\r\nundertaken. The Dominicans and the Franciscans were peculiarly devoted\r\nto the Papacy, and the papal authority placed in their hands to carry\r\non in its larger development the work of the Inquisition, proved to be\r\na powerful instrument to extend the influence of Rome and to lessen the\r\nindependence of the local churches.”[97]\r\n\r\nThe consecutive history of the Inquisition as a definite organisation\r\nmay be said to date from the Council of Toulouse in 1229. The Spanish\r\nInquisition, which proved to be by far the most persistent, the most\r\neffective, and the most terrible of the Inquisition organisations of\r\nthe world, dates from 1480. Curiously enough, the most complete and\r\npitiless of the acts of persecution that were based upon the Lateran\r\ncanons was the work of one of the fiercest opponents of the Church,\r\nthe Emperor Frederick II. It became necessary, on more grounds than\r\none, for the Emperor to meet the charges of heresy that had been freely\r\nbrought against him, and for this purpose, he found it convenient\r\nto manifest special zeal in the persecution of heretics. The edicts\r\nputting this persecution into form were issued between the years\r\n1220 and 1239. In 1232, Frederick placed at the command of the papal\r\ninquisitors the whole machinery of the State, for the purpose of\r\ntracing heresy and of capturing and condemning heretics. Frederick’s\r\ncoronation edict against heretics, issued in 1220, was sent by Pope\r\nHonorius to the University of Bologna to be taught as a part of\r\npractical law. The whole series of Frederick’s edicts was subsequently\r\npromulgated by successive popes in repeated Bulls. The substance of\r\nthese edicts was finally incorporated in the _Corpus Juris_ as\r\npart of the canon law itself, and their regulations may, technically\r\nspeaking, be regarded as in force in the present day.[98]\r\n\r\nThe commission issued in 1227 by Gregory IX may be conveniently\r\naccepted as constituting the foundation of the papal Inquisition.\r\nFrom this date, the policy of the Church in the great work of the\r\nsuppression of heresy was pushed forward with a consistency on the\r\npart of the central organisation that had not before been possible.\r\nIn April, 1233, Gregory IX issued two Bulls making the persecution of\r\nheresy the special function of the Dominicans. The plan, arrived at\r\nby Gregory, for the selection by the provincial churches of certain\r\nbrethren who exercised within their several provinces the delegated\r\nauthority of the Holy See in searching out and examining heretics, was\r\naccepted as a permanent basis of the Inquisition. The bishops continued\r\nfrom time to time to protest against the invasion by these papal\r\ninquisitors of their territories and of their responsibilities, but the\r\npower of the Inquisition continued to strengthen itself through the\r\ncenturies. The germ of the Inquisition lies in the duty of searching\r\nout and correcting error. It was, therefore, natural that when the new\r\nart of printing had largely increased the risk of the spread of error,\r\nthe Inquisition should have claimed and should have secured a large\r\nshare of the responsibility for the control of the printing-press.\r\n\r\nThe chief original authority for the system of the earlier Inquisition\r\nis the _Directorium Inquisitorium_ of Nicholas Eymeric, who was\r\nInquisitor-General for Castile in 1316. Eymeric left, among other\r\nworks, the manuscript of a _Liber Sententiarum_, or Book of Judgments,\r\nwhich presents the early rules of procedure. In 1252, Innocent IV\r\nissued the Bull _Ad Extirpanda_, addressed to the potentates and\r\nrulers of Italy, which presented an elaborate law for the establishing\r\nof machinery for systematic persecution in every city and in every\r\nState. In 1265, Urban IV renewed an order, originally issued in 1257\r\nby Alexander IV, under which the local authorities were forbidden\r\nto interfere in any way with the action of the Inquisition. The\r\nInquisition was made supreme in all lands and it became an accepted\r\nmaxim of law that all legislation interfering with its free action was\r\nvoid and that all who enacted such laws were to be punished. When a\r\nmonarch like Philip the Fair undertook to protect his subjects against\r\ninquisitorial processes, he risked incurring Divine vengeance. Under\r\nthe canon law, any one, from the meanest to the highest, who opposed,\r\nor who impeded in any way, the functions of the inquisitor, or who\r\ngave aid or counsel to others so acting, became at once, _ipso facto_,\r\nexcommunicate. In England, the statute _de haeretico comburendo_,\r\nenacted in 1400, for the first time secured for that country the\r\npenalty of death as a punishment for heresy. It was under this statute\r\nthat dissemination of heretical opinions by preaching or by books was\r\nprohibited and controlled. In 1262, Urban IV instituted the office of\r\ninquisitor-general, the first occupant of which was Cajetano Orsini,\r\nwho became Pope as Nicholas III. After the 13th century, however,\r\nthe post remained vacant. The Spanish Inquisition retained in its\r\norganisation, from the beginning, the post of inquisitor-general,\r\nand under such direction as that of Torquemada and of Ximenes, the\r\nprosecution of heresy secured in Spain a consistency and finality of\r\naction which were not to be found in any other State.\r\n\r\n   “The papal Inquisition was an instrument of infinitely greater\r\n   efficiency for the work in hand than any inquisitorial machinery\r\n   controlled by the bishops. However zealous an episcopal official\r\n   might be, his efforts were necessarily isolated, temporary, and\r\n   spasmodic. The papal Inquisition, on the other hand, constituted\r\n   a chain of tribunals throughout continental Europe, perpetually\r\n   manned by those who had no other work to attend to. Not only\r\n   therefore did persecution in their hands assume the aspect of\r\n   belonging to the endless and inevitable operations of nature,\r\n   which was necessary to accomplish its end and which rendered the\r\n   heretic hopeless that time would bring relief, but by constant\r\n   interchange of documents and mutual co-operation these tribunals\r\n   covered Christendom with a network that rendered escape nearly\r\n   hopeless. The Inquisition had a long arm and a sleepless memory\r\n   and it is not difficult to understand the terror inspired by\r\n   the secrecy of its operations and by its almost supernatural\r\n   vigilance.”[99]\r\n\r\nIn July, 1542, under a Bull of Paul III, a new organisation was\r\ngiven to the Roman Inquisition. Six cardinals were appointed\r\ninquisitors-general, the list including Caraffa who was in 1555 to\r\nbecome Pope under the name of Paul IV, and who had already taken an\r\nactive part in the fight against heresy.\r\n\r\nThe six inquisitors were empowered to take such measures as they found\r\nnecessary, with or without the co-operation of the local bishops,\r\nfor the detection and punishment of heretics, the examination of\r\nsuspected persons, the destruction of pernicious literature, and\r\ngenerally for the suppression of heresy. They were also to appoint\r\ndelegates or sub-inquisitors, and to take action on appeals from all\r\nthe lower tribunals of the Inquisition. In 1558, Paul IV ordered\r\nthat the inquisitor-general or chief should always be a cardinal,\r\nand that he should be charged with the supervision of all matters\r\nof faith, proceedings against heretics, etc. He was to retain this\r\nspecial authority during any vacancy in the Papacy. The Cardinal of\r\nAlexandria, Ghislieri, was, however, the only one who held this sole\r\nauthority. When, in 1566, he was chosen Pope as Pius V, he appointed\r\nfour cardinals as inquisitors-general. Lea points out that the purpose\r\nof the institution of the Inquisition was not merely the suppression\r\nof heresy, but the reform of corruption and the correction of the\r\nimmoralities that had sprung up within the Church. Lea is speaking more\r\ndirectly of the Inquisition in Spain, but the statement apparently\r\nholds good also for the Inquisition of Rome, which charged itself later\r\nparticularly with the work of carrying out the reforms ordered by the\r\nCouncil of Trent.\r\n\r\n_1543._ _The Inquisitors-general_ issue an edict for the suppression of\r\nheretical literature and of books written by heretics. The book-dealers\r\nthroughout Italy are forbidden, under penalty of excommunication and\r\nof a fine of 1000 ducats, and of other punishments to be determined\r\nin the several cases, to sell or to possess any books written by\r\nheretics, or tainted with heresies. They are further ordered to place\r\nin readiness for inspection all books then in stock or later received,\r\nand thereafter to sell no books that have not been examined and\r\napproved by inspectors appointed for the purpose. Similar instructions\r\nare issued for the printers concerning the printing of books condemned.\r\nThe inquisitor of Ferrara and Bologna is delegated to arrange for\r\nthe inspection of printing-offices, bookshops, libraries, convents,\r\nchurches, and private houses, and to make destruction of all books\r\nto be classed as heretical, and to report the names of all printers,\r\ndealers, librarians, or others who refuse or evade co-operation in such\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\n_1550._ _Pope Julius III_, in a Bull issued in April, recalls and\r\ncancels all permissions or dispensations at that time in force, for\r\nthe reading or possession of prohibited books. These permissions had\r\nfor the most part been issued to scholarly ecclesiastics whose studies\r\nappeared to call for some knowledge of heretical literature. The Bull\r\nrepeats also the previous prohibitions, specifications of penalties,\r\netc., against printers, booksellers, or others, who may produce, sell,\r\nbuy, possess, or read such books. The Bull was to be read at St.\r\nPeter’s and at the Lateran, and its provisions became binding, sixty\r\ndays later, on all persons.\r\n\r\nThe possession or the reading of forbidden books constitutes one\r\nof the most frequent charges in the Inquisition trials of the 16th\r\ncentury.[100]\r\n\r\nThe scheme for the development of the Roman Inquisition so that its\r\norganisation should cover as with a comprehensive network the whole\r\nof the territory that accepted the authority of the Church, was never\r\nbrought to completion. The Inquisition of Spain, the most Catholic\r\nof the Catholic States, retained from the outset its independence\r\nfrom Rome. The Spanish Inquisition, in form at least, worked under\r\nthe authority of the king, while in fact, except in the case of\r\nstrong-willed monarchs like Charles V and Philip II, it dominated\r\nthe throne as well as the country. France, in company with the other\r\nCatholic States north of the Alps, in like manner refused to accept\r\nas binding instructions from Rome for the direction of the operations\r\nof the local inquisition. In France as in England, the control of\r\nthe machinery rested practically with the king, while in the several\r\nStates of Germany, the authority was for the most part exercised by\r\nthe archbishops and bishops. Even in Italy, the Roman Inquisition did\r\nnot succeed in securing a general acceptance of its authority. Venice\r\nwas able to retain, during the greater part of the centuries, liberty\r\nof action, particularly in the control of the printing-press; Sicily\r\nwas under the control of Spain, and there were from time to time\r\nprotests and revolts in Florence and Milan.[101] The influence of the\r\nInquisition of Rome was, however, more extended and more important\r\nthan would be indicated by the range of acceptance of the authority\r\nof its edicts and orders. The decisions of its courts and the policy\r\nemphasised in its edicts were very largely followed by the inquisitors\r\nin Spain, France, and elsewhere, and they helped to secure some measure\r\nof consistency throughout the Catholic States in the treatment of\r\nheresy and in the supervision of heretical literature.\r\n\r\n_1550._ _Ghislieri, Inquisitor at Como_ (who became Pope as Pius V)\r\nexcommunicated the vicar and chapter because they had taken part with\r\ncertain book-dealers of whose stock twelve bales of books, classed as\r\nheretical, had been confiscated. By direction of the vicar and chapter\r\nof Como, the books had been returned to the importers. Como was at\r\nthat time being used as a port of entry for Northern Italy for books\r\nfrom Germany and Switzerland. The sympathies of the town were with\r\nthe book-dealers and the Inquisition was said to have escaped with\r\ndifficulty the vengeance of the injured parties.[102]\r\n\r\n_1563._ _Pius IV_ issues a Bull giving authority to the Inquisition to\r\nproceed, in regard to heresy, against prelates as well as laymen. The\r\naction of the Roman Inquisition was as a rule much less severe than\r\nthat of the Spanish organisation, and there was, therefore fierce and\r\neffective opposition when Spanish monarchs, in connection with their\r\ncontrol of Italian territory, attempted from time to time to introduce\r\nthe Spanish regulations into Naples and Milan.\r\n\r\n_1595._ _Decrees of the Roman Inquisition_ order the inquisitors, or\r\nin their absence the bishop, to make search for heretical books in the\r\ncargoes of all incoming ships. The books found are to be confiscated\r\nand burned. In the Inquisition of Rome, as also in the Congregation\r\nof the Index, the Dominicans had from the beginning exercised a very\r\nlarge influence, and were in fact for the greater part of the time in\r\nfull control. From the beginning of the 16th century, this Order had\r\ntaken the leading part in the work of extirpating heresy. It was at\r\nthe instance of Cardinal Caraffa that a Dominican was associated with\r\nthe six cardinals as “Commissary” and became the actual executive of\r\nthe board. Many of the edicts and orders, and particularly those in\r\nregard to books, soon came to be issued on the sole responsibility\r\nof the “Commissary.”[103] In the selection of the authors to be\r\ncondemned and of the phases of doctrine to be brought into disrepute,\r\nthe old-time antagonism of the Dominicans against the Franciscans and\r\nthe Jesuits speedily became apparent. The generals of the Franciscans\r\nemphasised with the popes the evil that was caused to the influence\r\nof the Church by confiding to ignorant and prejudiced monks the\r\nsupervision of literature and the determination of heresies. It is not\r\nclear, however, that the management of the Inquisition became more\r\njudicious or the supervision of the censorship more discriminating at\r\nthe times (comparatively infrequent) when the control of the Dominicans\r\nwas replaced by that of the more scholarly, but no less bitter and\r\npartisan, influence of the Jesuits.\r\n\r\nThe chaplain of Philip II declared it as his opinion that the\r\npurification of Spain from heretics was due to the deaths brought about\r\nunder the regulations of the Index, and the prosecution of heretics by\r\nthe Inquisition. Cardinal Pallavicino, in his eulogy on Paul IV, lays\r\nspecial emphasis on the Pope’s zealous attachment to the Inquisition,\r\nand claims that the preservation of Italy from the infection of\r\ninvading heresies was due to the activity of the holy tribunal, and\r\nparticularly to its work in supervising the Index.[104] Paramo asserts\r\nthat the Holy Office of the Inquisition originated in Paradise and that\r\nits record can be traced through the succeeding ages of Jewish and of\r\nChristian history.\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Trials under the Inquisition in the 17th Century.=--The most\r\nnoteworthy of the trials directed by the Inquisition during the first\r\nhalf of the 17th century is that of Galileo. In connection with a\r\ndenunciation that had been submitted to the authorities concerning the\r\nteachings of Galileo, the Inquisition secured from its theological\r\ncounsellors an examination of and a formal opinion concerning two\r\npropositions which presented the Copernican theory. One of these\r\nwas declared to be heretical, while the other was characterised as\r\nsimply erroneous. As a result of this report, given in March, 1616,\r\nthe Congregation of the Index condemned, with a _d. c._, the treatise\r\nby Copernicus, _De revolutionibus orbium coelestium_, and also the\r\n“Commentary on Job” by Didacus of Stunica. The latter had been issued\r\nin Italy in 1584, and reprinted in Rome in 1592. The same list included\r\nthe prohibition of a volume by Foscarini entitled _Lettera sopra\r\nl’opiniones de’ Pittagorici e del Copernico_, printed in Naples in\r\n1615. A general prohibition was added of all writings which presented\r\nsimilar teachings. This condemnation of the Copernican theories was,\r\nunder the instruction of the pope, communicated by Cardinal Bellarmin\r\nto Galileo, who was at that time in Rome, and, according to the record,\r\nthe astronomer promised to correct his errors. In 1632, however, he\r\npublished a monograph entitled _Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi\r\ndel mondo Tolemaicho e Copernicano_, in which was made substantially\r\nevident the acceptance by Galileo of the Copernican system. This\r\npublication caused the Inquisition to institute proceedings against\r\nGalileo and, in June, 1633, he was ordered to abjure as error and as\r\nheresy the Copernican doctrine. The _Dialogo_ was in August, 1634,\r\nformally condemned and prohibited. Back of these proceedings, in\r\n1620, the Index Congregation had published a _Monitum_ in which were\r\nspecified the eliminations and corrections that had to be made in the\r\nwritings of Copernicus before any further printing of these writings\r\ncould be permitted. The changes ordered in the text caused the theories\r\nof Copernicus to be presented not as a conclusion but as an hypothesis.\r\nIn 1619, the Congregation prohibited the _Epitome astronomiae\r\nCopernicae_ of John Kepler. The above appear to be the only works upon\r\nthe Copernican doctrine which on that ground simply, and specifically\r\nby title, were placed in the Index. It is the case, however, that\r\nthe _Raccolta_ of 1624, the _Elenchus_ of some years later, and the\r\nsucceeding Indexes up to the time of Benedict XIV, all contain, under\r\nthe heading of _libri_, a general prohibition covering all books which\r\nteach the movement of the earth and the fixity of the sun. The Index of\r\nBenedict XIV omits this general prohibition. Since that date, various\r\nbooks have come into print in Rome in which the Copernican doctrine is\r\nopenly explained and maintained. It was, however, not until September,\r\n1822, that the Inquisition gave formal permission for the printing in\r\nRome of books maintaining the theory of the movement of the earth about\r\nthe sun, in accordance with the accepted views of modern astronomy.\r\nThis conclusion was, on the 25th of September, 1822, confirmed by\r\nPius VII and in the next edition of the Index, in 1835, the names of\r\nCopernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Foscarini, and Stunica were omitted. The\r\naccount of the condemnation of Galileo is given in Chapter X, in the\r\nrecord of the Index of 1664.\r\n\r\nIn 1623, under Urban VIII, Mark Antonio de Dominis, formerly Archbishop\r\nof Spalatro, was brought to trial by the Inquisition and died in the\r\nsame year while in prison. He was condemned, after his death, as a\r\nbacksliding heretic, and his body, his portrait, and his books were\r\nburned. He had in 1616 joined the Anglican Church, but in 1622 had\r\nreturned to Rome and had abjured his heresy. The most important of\r\nhis writings that were at this time condemned was the treatise _de\r\nRepublica ecclesiastico_, which was prohibited before it had come\r\ninto print. In 1626, the English Benedictine, John Barnes, was, under\r\nthe command of Urban VIII, arrested in Paris, brought to Rome, and\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition to imprisonment for life. He died after\r\nthirty years’ confinement, in a state of idiocy. Among the writings\r\nof Barnes which have been placed in the Index, the most important\r\nis the treatise entitled _Romano Catholicus pacificus_, which was\r\nfirst published in England after the death of the author. In 1622,\r\nwas prohibited a treatise by Vecchietti under the title of _De anno\r\nprimitivo ab exordio mundi ad annum Julianum_, etc., the author\r\nof which had for a long series of years been imprisoned under the\r\norder of the Inquisition, because he refused to take back an opinion\r\nconcerning the date of the Last Supper. His theory was, however, later\r\nadopted quite generally without further criticism. Cesari Cremonini,\r\na professor in Padua, was ordered more than once by the Inquisition\r\nto report to Rome for trial. He refused obedience, however, and was\r\nprotected by the Republic of Venice. The Inquisition could take no\r\nfurther action than to secure the prohibition of one of his books.\r\nIn 1644, Pallavicini was executed in Avignon under the authority\r\nnot of the Inquisition but of the papal legate. The ground for his\r\ncondemnation was a pasquil written against Urban VIII. The pasquil\r\nitself, doubtless through oversight, escaped condemnation in the Index.\r\n\r\n\r\n=3. The Congregation of the Index.=--In 1571, Pius V instituted\r\nthe Congregation of the Index, which was made up of certain cardinals\r\nselected by the Pope and was charged with the work of continuing the\r\nseries of Indexes and of shaping the regulations for the prohibition\r\nand supervision of books. The original order or edict of Pius appears\r\nnot to have been preserved. The organisation of the Congregation\r\nwas completed in 1572 by the Bull of Gregory XIII. In 1588, fifteen\r\ncongregations of cardinals were instituted by Sixtus V for various\r\nobjects. Of these, the seventh had for its function _pro Indici\r\nlibrorum prohibitorum_. The Congregation is at this date (1906)\r\nstill carrying on its labours, although, under the later policy of the\r\nCuria, its responsibilities have been somewhat restricted.\r\n\r\nBenedict XIV, in the introduction to the _Bulla Solicita_, issued\r\nin 1753, says:\r\n\r\n   “There are two Congregations which have been charged by the\r\n   Curia with the work of supervising pernicious and doubtful\r\n   books, of reprinting those which by means of expurgation can\r\n   be rendered suitable for preservation, and of indicating which\r\n   must be condemned. Paul IV placed this task in the hands of\r\n   the Congregation of the Inquisition, and still to-day (1753)\r\n   the Inquisition gives judgment in regard to books of certain\r\n   classes. The Congregation of the Index was, however, instituted\r\n   by Pius V, and the responsibilities of this body were confirmed\r\n   and extended by Gregory XIII, Sixtus V, and Clement VIII. The\r\n   special duty of the Congregation is to make examination of\r\n   books concerning the authorisation, the correction, or the\r\n   prohibition of which question has arisen.”\r\n\r\nAs first constituted, the Congregation comprised four cardinals and\r\nnine councillors. Under a Bull issued in 1572, by Gregory XIII, the\r\nCongregation was made up of seven cardinals, of whom Sirleto was named\r\nas chief. The Pope states as follows the grounds for the institution of\r\nthe Congregation:\r\n\r\n   “In order to put a stop to the circulation of pernicious\r\n   opinions, and as far as practicable to bring certainty and\r\n   protection to the faithful, it is our desire to bring the Index\r\n   of prohibited books into a condition of completeness, so that\r\n   Christians may be able to know what books it is safe for them\r\n   to read and what they must avoid, and that there may be in\r\n   this matter no occasion for doubt or question.... Therefore we\r\n   give to you or to the majority of your body, full authority\r\n   and powers to take action in regard to the examination and the\r\n   classification of books, and to secure for aid in such work\r\n   the service of learned men, ecclesiastics and laymen, who have\r\n   knowledge of theology and of the canons; and to permit or to\r\n   prohibit the use of books so examined, all authority given by\r\n   my predecessors to their bodies or individuals for the carrying\r\n   on of the work. It shall also be the duty of your body to\r\n   elucidate or eliminate all difficulties or incongruities in the\r\n   existing Indexes; to arrange for the correction or expurgation\r\n   of all texts containing instructions of value, the service of\r\n   which is marred by erroneous and pernicious material; to add to\r\n   the Index the titles of all works found to be unworthy; and to\r\n   prohibit the production and the use of all books so condemned;\r\n   and to give permission for the reading of books approved and of\r\n   books corrected and freed from error; and for the purpose of\r\n   facilitating your task, you shall enjoin upon all bishops ...\r\n   doctors, masters, printers, booksellers, magistrates, and others\r\n   to coöperate with your body in carrying out the regulations\r\n   formulated by your body for the supervision, control, and\r\n   improvement of literature, and for the protection of the\r\n   faithful against heresy.”\r\n\r\nIn the Bull _Immensa_ of Sixtus V, January, 1587, the Congregation\r\nof the Index is directed to secure co-operation from the universities\r\nof Paris, Bologna, Salamanca, and Louvain, and other trustworthy\r\ninstitutions, in the work of examining and correcting books. (The\r\nselection of the universities recommended is interesting.) The\r\nCongregation is empowered to give permissions, exclusively for use\r\nin connection with the Index, to the scholars selected from these\r\nuniversities, and to other scholars whose service is utilised, to read\r\nthe forbidden books without a special papal dispensation.\r\n\r\nThe _Magister_ of the papal palace (who was always a Dominican) was\r\nthe standing counsel of the Inquisition and of the Congregation of the\r\nIndex. The _Magister_ held at one time the office of papal chaplain,\r\nand later served as the personal adviser of the pope in theological\r\nmatters. Leo X assigned to the _Magister_ (acting in conjunction with\r\nthe cardinal vicar) the control of the censorship for Rome of books to\r\nbe printed, and this function is still retained by him.[105] In 1600,\r\nClement VIII decides (through Cardinal Baronius) that the Congregation\r\nhas jurisdiction not only over books, but also over the authors,\r\nprinters, and readers of the same; but that it must not interfere in\r\nthe matters of heresy reserved for the control of the Inquisition.[106]\r\n\r\nLatinus (1593, later counsellor of the Congregation) relates that\r\nhaving occasion to read a volume by Paschasius, he had inadvertently\r\nproceeded with the reading of a treatise by Bertram which was bound in\r\nwith this, forgetting that the latter was on the Index. On recognising\r\nhis error, he threw away the book, and appealed to the Cardinal of\r\nErmland, Grand Penitentiary, for absolution. His sin had brought him\r\nunder the “reserved excommunication.” Later, the secretary of the\r\nCongregation had authority to give permission for the reading of\r\nprohibited books (with a few exceptions), but for no term longer than\r\nthree years, and only in connection with an application on certificate\r\nfrom a bishop, vicar-general, or general of an order.\r\n\r\nThe first _Magister_ of the palace was St. Dominic. The office was\r\nheld more than once by cardinals. Since the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury, the _Magister_ or his associate (_Socius_) is empowered, for\r\nthe city of Rome, to prohibit the printing and the reading of books.\r\nBoth officials have also the authority to permit the use of books other\r\nthan the works of authors placed in Class I, or of books which treat of\r\ntheological matters. For instance, in 1574, the _Magister_ Constabile\r\ngave permission to the scholar, Pierre Morin, to make use of the Greek\r\nlexicon of Stephanus (Estienne).\r\n\r\nDoctor Shahan (of the Catholic University of America) gives me the\r\nfollowing statement concerning the organisation and the work of the\r\nCongregation:\r\n\r\n   “The Congregation of the Index has, since its formal\r\n   organisation, always had for its Secretary a member of the\r\n   Dominican Order. The ‘Master of the Sacred Palace’ is also,\r\n   _ex officio_, a member of the Congregation with the title\r\n   of Perpetual Assistant. The usage under which the office of the\r\n   Secretary and the office of Perpetual Assistant are always held\r\n   by Dominicans is explained as follows:\r\n\r\n   “When St. Dominic was at Rome, he was wont to interpret the\r\n   Holy Scriptures in the presence of the papal Court, and from\r\n   that time one of his brethren has always continued to hold this\r\n   office. A Dominican historian of the 18th century, Echard,[107]\r\n   tells us that the duty placed upon this Dominican consisted\r\n   _in Scholae Romanae et Pontificiae regimine et in publica\r\n   Sacrae Scripturae expositione_, i. e., ‘in the government of\r\n   the Roman and pontifical school and in the public interpretation\r\n   of the Scripture.’ This would mean, in the 13th and 14th\r\n   centuries, the headmastership of all theological teaching and\r\n   preaching in the papal Curia (_Sacrum Palatium_). The\r\n   theological sciences were not then differentiated after their\r\n   present manner. Doctrinal theology was largely Bible-commentary.\r\n   Thus, the Roman ecclesiastical official who had formal charge\r\n   of Bible-study and public teaching in the papal Curia, would\r\n   naturally be expected to control the public utterances of\r\n   his own disciples and of others, to exercise a revision of\r\n   theological and Scriptural manuscripts, and to detect and\r\n   denounce current heresies, where these might be propagated\r\n   orally or made known in writing. As a matter of fact, such\r\n   duties belong yet to the office of the ‘Master of the Sacred\r\n   Palace.’ It is he who selects the preachers for solemn\r\n   pontifical occasions, and revises their sermons, and he is the\r\n   official censor of all books printed at Rome. This office is\r\n   the principal historical source of the Dominican influence in\r\n   the Index. It meant from the 13th century an official duty and\r\n   right of revision of all public ecclesiastical teaching, and\r\n   the immediate practical decisions as to the conformity of such\r\n   teaching with the teachings of the Scripture and of the Holy\r\n   See.\r\n\r\n   “There never has been in Rome a theological faculty\r\n   corresponding in character to the theological faculties of Paris\r\n   and of Oxford; but it would appear that the popes of the 13th\r\n   century had hoped to be able in one way or the other to bring\r\n   about the organisation of such an institution at Rome. There\r\n   were always at the papal Curia theologians of distinction, both\r\n   Italian and foreign, and the subject of ecclesiastical studies\r\n   was naturally a matter of constant attention and concern. It\r\n   was during this particular period of more or less unorganised\r\n   theological activity at Rome in the 13th century that the Master\r\n   of the Sacred Palace acquired and held all the privileges that\r\n   then went with the office of the head schoolmaster, or head of\r\n   the school (_Magister Scholae_). In other words, he was,\r\n   as may be said, the equivalent of the head or rector of the\r\n   theological faculty at Rome. I take it that had the political\r\n   circumstances of the 14th and 15th centuries permitted the\r\n   development at Rome of a good school of theological studies, our\r\n   Master of the Sacred Palace would have taken on the character\r\n   of the chancellor of the university, with such duties as are\r\n   exercised by the chancellor at Paris and at Oxford. Probably\r\n   too, like these officials, he would have met with prejudice and\r\n   opposition and would have been compelled to share more generally\r\n   the functions of his office. This was, however, the period of\r\n   the Avignon Papacy, the Great Schism, and the preponderating\r\n   political interests of the 15th century. So it came about\r\n   that at the time of the Reformation, the Master of the Sacred\r\n   Palace had for fully two centuries been an office reserved\r\n   for a Dominican. The Order was in possession of a place quite\r\n   closely related to its original purpose and its historical\r\n   development. The Dominicans had also, during the first quarter\r\n   of the 16th century, been intimately connected with the work for\r\n   the repression of heresy. It was still the period of influence\r\n   for the old and influential Aristotelian scholasticism and of\r\n   this school of thought the Dominicans remained the most learned\r\n   representatives. The Dominicans held also important theological\r\n   chairs in many of the Catholic universities of Europe. They\r\n   were very learned men of the severe traditional type, with a\r\n   long record for fidelity to the Holy See, for opposition to\r\n   heresy, and for opposition also even to the new learning that\r\n   had led astray so many Churchmen. For these reasons, when in the\r\n   latter quarter of the 16th century, it was the question of the\r\n   reorganisation of the Inquisition and of the creation of the\r\n   Index, the Dominican Order was able to put forth an indisputable\r\n   claim for the representation of both. Possibly also the enormous\r\n   influence of Spain at this period had something to do with the\r\n   actual constitution of these Congregations. Spain was always\r\n   wont to look very closely after its ecclesiastical interests at\r\n   Rome.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Denunciation of Books.]\r\n\r\nThe present regulations of the Index provide official channels for the\r\ndenunciation of books.\r\n\r\nIn Title I, Chapter X, it is stated that the duty of the denunciation\r\nof books to the Congregation belongs to the papal nuncios, the\r\napostolic delegates, the ordinaries (Diocesan bishops), and the rectors\r\nof the more important (Catholic) universities. It is requested that on\r\nsuch occasions not only the title of the book, but the reason for its\r\ncondemnation should be given, and at the same time absolute secrecy is\r\npromised as regards the sources of such denunciation.[108]\r\n\r\nMendham contends that the Italian Church seems to have acted on the\r\npresumption that, not when she condemned and executed (whether the\r\ninnocent or the guilty), but only when she acquitted and allowed to\r\nescape, she did wrong. And, therefore, the power of condemning supposed\r\nheretical books was permitted to any of the superior ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe pope, as head of the Church, claimed the individual right to the\r\ncontrol of literary production. A similar authority was likewise\r\nallowed to, and exercised by, public ecclesiastical bodies, such as the\r\ntheological faculties of the Sorbonne and of Louvain, by individual\r\nsuperior ecclesiastics, and even by the supreme civil magistrate.\r\nThere were from time to time protests, on the part more particularly\r\nof the Jesuits and the Dominicans, against the exercise of censorship\r\nby any bodies or individuals not explicitly authorised by the head\r\nof the Church, or carrying some such general authorisation as that\r\nheld by the Inquisition. The Jesuit Raynaud[109] denies the authority\r\nof the bishops; and his opinion of the censorship authority of the\r\nuniversities is contemptuous. If, he argues, this power resides not in\r\nan individual doctor as such, how can it reside in a collective body of\r\ndoctors? If Aesop’s ass, though in a lion’s skin, was still but an ass,\r\nwould a whole herd of such animals form an assembly of lions?\r\n\r\nVan Espen, in a tract concerning the Congregation of the Inquisition,\r\nstates that the censure or condemnation of the books in the Index is\r\noften to be resolved into the examination and judgment of a single\r\nconsultor, as he is called. Not a few true Romanists whose works were\r\nthus transfixed have protested against the injustice of being, on the\r\njudgment of a single examiner, classified as heretics.[110]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Damages under Censorship]\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find that the ecclesiastical authorities now\r\ntake, or ever have taken, any official notice of the damages brought\r\nupon a publisher or a printer as a result of the condemnation of books\r\nbrought into print by him. I may assume that an Italian or a Spanish\r\npublisher who had reason to suspect the denunciation of a work in which\r\nhe was interested, would see to it that the author either himself bore\r\nthe entire risk and expense for the production and publication of the\r\nbook, or that the author placed himself under bond of some kind for the\r\nprotection and possible reimbursement of his publisher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                THE FIRST SERIES OF INDEXES, 1510–1559\r\n\r\n   1.

The heresies which at that\r\ntime were to be controlled had not as yet been very clearly classified.\r\nMartin Luther, in a letter written February 8, 1516, says: _Nec cessant\r\nuniversitates bonos libros cremare et damnare, rursum malos dictare,\r\nimmo somniare_.[112]\r\n\r\n_2._ _1544._ _Paris._ The first schedule of prohibited books printed\r\nunder the name of an Index was, as far as is at present known, that\r\nissued by the University of Paris, in 1544. The faculty of the Sorbonne\r\nhad been instructed, under an order of the Parliament of July, 1542,\r\nto prepare a list of the books that the college had thus far condemned.\r\nNo copy of the original list has been preserved, but a supplementary\r\nlist is in existence, bringing the record down to 1543. This supplement\r\ncontains sixty-five titles, printed without any order or arrangement,\r\nand presenting the names of the leading German and French Reformers.\r\nThere is also a list of anonymous French works. In 1544, the college\r\nprinted an alphabeted list with about 170 titles. This was reprinted,\r\nwith additions, in 1547, in 1551, and in 1556. This is the last Index\r\npublished by the Sorbonne.[113]\r\n\r\n_3._ _1543._ _Venice._ _Index Generalis Scriptorum Interdictorum._ This\r\nIndex is cited by Reimann in his _Catalogus Bibliothecae Theologicae_.\r\nThe entry of title is connected with the following specification:\r\n_Atque ab hoc tempore conquievit haec libros excommunicandi ratio usque\r\nad A.

Intitulation ou déclaration des livres\r\nreprouvés, faiete par Messieurs les Docteurs en Sacrée Théologie de\r\nl’université de Louvain, a l’ordonnance et commandement de la susdicte\r\nMaiesté Impériale. Imprimé à Louvain par Servais de Sassia. MDXLVI cum\r\ngratia et privilegio._\r\n\r\nThis Index of Louvain is distinctive in being the first of the long\r\nseries of catalogues of books and of authors condemned as heretical\r\nwhich were issued with the sanction of the Church. It antedates by\r\nthirteen years the first of the Indexes produced in Rome, under the\r\nimmediate supervision of the pope, and may possibly be considered\r\nas an example of the special zeal against heresy on the part of\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities of the Spanish realm and of the\r\neffectiveness of the Spanish Inquisition. As the later records give\r\nevidence, it was only in the territory in which the authority of the\r\nInquisition remained unquestioned and by means of its machinery that\r\nit proved practicable to carry out with any thoroughness the policy\r\nof the Church in regard to the ecclesiastical control of literary\r\nproductions. The faith of the believing subjects of the Emperor Charles\r\nwas threatened most seriously by heretical writings coming from\r\nHolland and from Germany, and it was therefore quite fitting that the\r\nfirst official protest of the Church should be made from a place like\r\nLouvain, the university of which stood like a picket-post of orthodoxy\r\nconfronting the perilous heresies advancing from the North and from\r\nthe East. The name of the Inquisition is not directly connected with\r\nthis first Index of Louvain, but it appears on that printed at the\r\nsame place four years later, which is in substance a reissue of the\r\ncatalogue of 1546, and it is probably the case that the command of the\r\nEmperor for the preparation of the earlier publication may be credited\r\nto the Senate of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe _Mandement_ makes reference to _Ordonnances_ for the restraint\r\nof the press, issued in 1540 and 1544. It complains of the continued\r\npublication of heretical books, and particularly of corrupt editions\r\nof the Scriptures; and it accordingly subjects booksellers to new\r\nrestrictions, under penalty of death if they sell any books containing\r\nerror, without the previous inspection and mark of the appointed\r\ninspectors. No books could be printed except by a duly certified\r\nprinter who was a member of the guild. The Index itself comprises, 1,\r\na list of Bibles and New Testaments in Latin, low German, and French\r\neditions; 2, a list of works in Latin, chiefly the writings of the\r\nGerman Reformers (these titles are repeated in Flemish); 3, a list of\r\nheretical works in German and French; and, 4, a list of books which had\r\nbeen condemned in the rescript of 1540.\r\n\r\nThe introduction by the theological faculty states that the Emperor has\r\ncharged the faculty with the duty of examining all the libraries and\r\nbookshops, and of taking out from these the books classed as heretical,\r\ntogether with those which bordered upon heresy, and also all writings\r\nwhich might prove dangerous for the unlearned. A separate class was\r\nto be made of the books which, while not condemned as heretical, were\r\nnot to be left available for the use of the general public or of young\r\npeople. The writers of the introduction admit that their lists might\r\nbe more comprehensive. They point out, however, that the compilers had\r\nundertaken to condemn only those books which they had themselves had an\r\nopportunity of examining. They add a remark, which might to advantage\r\nhave received further consideration on the part of the producers of\r\nlater Indexes, to the effect that it was wiser to ignore books of a\r\ncertain character rather than, in calling attention to them, to incite\r\ncuriosity and risk bringing them into influence. The writers point out\r\nthat the devout reader is in a position to judge, through the titles\r\npresented, as to the class of literature that he is instructed to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe list of titles is arranged alphabetically, but the arrangement\r\nconfuses together the surnames and the forenames of the authors and\r\nthe titles of the books. A list is given of authors all of whose\r\nwritings are prohibited. In certain instances, as with the names of\r\nBucer, Bullinger, and Brenz, certain titles are specified and are\r\nfollowed by a general word to the effect that “as these authors are now\r\nknown as notorious heretics, all of their writings are prohibited.”\r\n\r\nThis first Index of the series makes a precedent, which was followed\r\nbut very seldom in the later Indexes, in adding a list of works the use\r\nof which was commended and which were permitted for the schools.\r\n\r\n_5._ _1550._ _Louvain._ Index, prohibitory and permissive. Compiled,\r\nunder the instructions of the emperor and by authority of the Senate of\r\nthe Inquisition, by the University of Louvain. Title-pages and text in\r\nFlemish.\r\n\r\n_1550._ _Louvain._ The same, with Latin text. S. Sassenus.\r\n\r\n_Catalogi Librorum reprobatorum et praelegendorum ex judicio Academiae\r\nLovaniensis.

Avec l’édict et mandement de la Maiesté\r\nImpériale._\r\n\r\nThe list of books condemned is closed with the words: _solam fidem\r\nsufficere ad salutem_. The condemned Bibles and New Testaments, in\r\neditions printed in various languages, aggregate forty-eight titles.\r\n\r\nThe introduction, addressed to “Christian readers,” is written over\r\nthe signatures of the rector and the members of the general faculty of\r\nthe university. The writers point out that the lists of prohibited\r\nbooks include not only such as are to be classed as heretical or\r\nas very suspicious, but also others which, under the cover of\r\nreligious instruction, are likely to mislead the unlearned or to\r\nconvey erroneous views concerning the pope, the ceremonials of the\r\nChurch, confession, mass, and the saints. Of the chief heretics, all\r\nthe writings are prohibited, the names being in the main those that\r\nappear in the catalogue of 1540. The list includes Brunfels, Brenz,\r\nBucer, Bullinger, Corvinus, Calvin, Petrus Martyr, Urbanus Regius, and\r\nMusculus. The names of Luther and Melanchthon are not included. The\r\nsuggestion is made to students whose work would be hampered through\r\nthe want of certain scholarly treatises, important in themselves and\r\nmarred possibly only through a small proportion of heretical error,\r\nand in the case of texts from the Latin, Greek, Hebrew, or Chaldean,\r\nthe annotations to which may contain error, that permission can be\r\nsecured, by properly accredited applicants, from commissioners to be\r\nappointed for the purpose, for a restricted use of such volumes; or the\r\ncommissioners will, at their discretion, eliminate from the volumes the\r\nheretical or dangerous portions, thus rendering them available for use\r\nin the class-room.\r\n\r\nThis Louvain Index of 1550 was, in 1551, reprinted in Spain under the\r\ndirection of Valdes, Inquisitor-General. Its lists (in the Latin text)\r\nwere included in the Valdes Index of 1559, and in a number of other\r\nof the Indexes produced in Spain. The Latin lists were also utilised\r\nin the first of the Venetian Indexes and from this the titles were\r\ntransferred to the Roman Index of 1559. The work of the theologians of\r\nLouvain was in fact accepted as the foundation or general model for\r\nthe whole series of Indexes which were produced prior to the Council of\r\nTrent, and was indeed, through the Index of Paul IV, utilised by the\r\ncompilers of the Tridentine Index of 1564.\r\n\r\nThe Roman compilers, in including in their schedules the titles from\r\nthe Louvain volume, transferred to Class I (comprising authors of\r\nacknowledged heresy, all of whose works were condemned) the names of a\r\nnumber of writers of whose productions the Louvain doctors had found\r\nbut a few examples deserving of condemnation. These general heretics of\r\nClass I belong, with but one or two exceptions, to Germany and the Low\r\nCountries. From the heretical writers of France are selected Dolet and\r\nMarot, and from Italy, Ochinus and Curio.\r\n\r\n_6._ _1545._ _The Senate of Lucca._ The earliest catalogue issued in\r\nItaly of books condemned as heretical, which is entitled to be classed\r\nas an Index, was published in Lucca in 1545. This was seventy-one\r\nyears after the introduction of printing into Italy, and fourteen\r\nyears earlier than the first papal Index. The catalogue is published\r\nunder the authority not of the bishop but of the Senate or Council of\r\nMagistrates, but the initiative probably came from the Inquisition. The\r\nedict orders that all copies of the books specified in the lists are,\r\nwithin fourteen days, to be delivered for burning, to the confessors or\r\nto the vicar of the bishop, under penalty of confiscation of property.\r\n\r\n_1549._ A supplementary edict of the Senate includes among the works\r\ncondemned all anonymous works treating of religion or the Scriptures\r\nthat have not secured the approval of the vicar. The catalogue, which\r\nis printed in Latin, presents the names of twenty-eight writers all of\r\nwhose works are condemned, the list including Wyclif, Huss, Zwingli,\r\nOecolampadius, Melanchthon, Carlstadt, Hütten, Hessius, Bomelius, and\r\nother less well-known names. Calvin does not appear. There are in\r\naddition the titles of about one hundred other pernicious books. A\r\nbrief of Pius IV, issued in 1562, commends the Senate of Lucca for its\r\n“pious and praiseworthy decree.”\r\n\r\nPaul V takes a different position. Under an order issued by him in\r\n1605 the Lucca decree is annulled on the ground that the repression\r\nof heresy is a matter that belongs exclusively to the Church, and\r\nconcerning which laymen have no authority to take action. At the same\r\ntime, he orders the institution in Lucca of an Inquisition tribunal.\r\n\r\n_7._ _1549._ _Venice._ _Il catalogo de’ Libri li quali nuovamente nel\r\nmesi di maggio nell anno presente MDXLVIIII, sono stati condannati et\r\nscommunicati per heretici, da Giovan della Casa, legato di Venetia et\r\nd’Alcani frati. E aggiunto sopra il medesimo catalogo un judicis et\r\ndiscorso del Vergerio, 1549._ (In dating this Index 1549 instead of\r\n1548 as stated by Reusch, I take the authority of Mendham, who cites\r\nthe _catalogus Bibliothecae Banavianae_.) This Index is known by the\r\nname of Casa. No copies of the original have been found, and the\r\nreferences to it are based upon the reprint issued by Vergerio in 1550.\r\nJohn della Casa was the Archbishop of Benvenuto, and papal Nuncio at\r\nVenice. His Index was, according to Vergerio, prepared by the command\r\nof Pope Paul III. It must in that case take rank as the first Index\r\nissued under direct papal authority. The lists are preceded by the\r\nstatement that: “All works produced by the heretics and heresiarchs\r\nwhose names follow, which have to do with theology or kindred subjects,\r\nare condemned and prohibited.” The names of authors include Luther,\r\nHuss, Marsilius of Padua, and Nicholas Clemangis. The catalogue\r\npresents 142 titles--of which twenty-five are those of books issued (in\r\nLatin) anonymously. There is also a general prohibition of “Bibles and\r\nNew Testaments containing notes or comments opposed to the faith, and\r\nof all works which within the preceding twenty-four years have been\r\nprinted without the name of the author and address of the printer.”\r\nVergerio is able to point out that this Index is a very clumsy\r\ncompilation which contains a full measure of errors and which compares\r\nunfavourably with the catalogues recently issued in Louvain and in\r\nParis. In certain instances, the names of the authors or of their books\r\nare so carelessly worded as to render identification difficult. The\r\ntitles of a number of the Latin books are given in Italian, and those\r\nof some of the few Italian books in Latin. There does not appear to\r\nbe any arrangement of the titles, alphabetical or other. Of certain\r\nauthors, as, for instance, of Giusto Giona, all the writings are\r\ncondemned, and later are given for separate condemnation the titles\r\nof selected books of the same author. Casa speaks of having secured\r\nthe assistance of some of the most learned of the Italian theologians,\r\nbut their work appears to have been most carelessly done, particularly\r\nin view of the fact that they had available for use the comparatively\r\naccurate lists of the Louvain Catalogue of 1546.\r\n\r\nVergerio wrote (in Italian) an analysis pointing out the ignorance, and\r\noccasional impiety, of which this catalogue gave evidence. He speaks\r\nof it as “the first monster of the kind which had appeared in Italy,”\r\na statement which ignores an edition said to have been printed in\r\nVenice in 1543.[115] In 1552, the catalogue was reprinted in Florence\r\nwith some additional titles and with correction of certain of the\r\nerrors previously pointed out by Vergerio. Concerning this catalogue,\r\nalso, Vergerio printed a criticism as a result of which a third edition\r\nwith further revisions was published in 1554, in Milan. In the same\r\nyear, a fourth edition was issued in Venice, the many blunders in\r\nwhich (Vergerio uses the terms “folly” and “madness” of the compilers)\r\nprovoked the commentator to a new exposure which was printed in Latin.\r\nVergerio points out the omission from the lists of obscene books and of\r\nbooks of magic, etc. In the former class ought, as he claims, to have\r\nbeen included a work by Casa himself, _Capitolo del Forno_.\r\n\r\nThis Index of Casa has importance, notwithstanding its slightness and\r\nbad workmanship, as well because the responsibility for its production\r\nrested with Paul III, as because its lists, imperfect as they were, are\r\nin part reproduced, errors included, in the Index of Paul IV.\r\n\r\nIt would have been impossible to present any account of the work\r\nof these earlier Italian Index-makers except for the scholarly and\r\ncritical labours of Vergerio, who charged himself with the duty of\r\nrecording and of characterising these first efforts of the Church to\r\nsupervise the literature of the time and to control the output of the\r\nprinting-presses.\r\n\r\nPeter Paul Vergerio had been papal Nuncio to Germany in 1530, and\r\nBishop of Capo d’Istria in 1536. He became, in 1544, a convert to\r\nProtestantism, and in 1553 was a preacher in Tübingen, where the\r\ngreater part of his later literary work was done. His collected works\r\nwere printed in Tübingen in 1563.\r\n\r\nWhat is possibly the first recorded list of heresiarchs is given in\r\na catalogue compiled under the instructions of the Archbishop of\r\nBenevento and printed in Venice in the year 1549. It is printed under\r\nthe title of _Il catalogo de’ Libri, li quali nuovamente nel mese\r\ndi maggio ... sono stati condannati et scommunicati per heretici_.\r\nThe catalogue is known through the reissue by Vergerio, printed at\r\nStrasburg in 1553.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Heresiarchs, as recorded in 1549._\r\n\r\n(The names are printed partly in the nominative and partly in the\r\ngenitive of the Latin form.)\r\n\r\n    Martin Luther.\r\n    Martini Buceri.\r\n    Martini Borrhai.\r\n    Melanchthonis.\r\n    Eccolampadii.\r\n    Zuinglii.\r\n    Joannis Hus.\r\n    Bullingeri.\r\n    Erasmi Sarcerii.\r\n    Joannis Brentii.\r\n    Pellianai (sic)\r\n    Antonii Corvini.\r\n    M.

It contained the titles collected by Casa, with a few\r\nadditions, and with certain corrections based upon the strictures made\r\nby Vergerio on Casa’s lists.\r\n\r\n_9._ _1554._ _The Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Angelo Arcimboldi_,\r\npublishes an Index, preserved only through the reprint in a\r\ncontroversial pamphlet of Vergerio. The title reads: _Catalogo del\r\nArcimboldo Arcinescovo di Milano, one egli condanna et di ffama per\r\nheretici la magior parte de figliuoli de Dio, et mebri di Christo,\r\nquali ne loro, scritti cercano la reformatione della chiesa Christiana.\r\nCon una riposta fattagli in nome d’ una parte di quei ualenti nomini.\r\nNello anno MDLIII._ The Index bears, in addition to the name of the\r\nArchbishop, that of Castiglione, Commissary General of the Inquisition\r\nfor Lombardy, and the announcement that it is issued “with the approval\r\nof the Senate of Milan.”\r\n\r\nUnder the responsibility of these three authorities, is issued, in a\r\npreamble to the catalogue, an edict, with the following regulations:\r\nEcclesiastics and laymen alike are prohibited, under penalty of\r\nexcommunication and of bodily punishment, from preaching or reading\r\n(aloud?) the Scriptures, either in church or elsewhere, without a\r\nwritten permit from the archbishop. The printing, selling, possessing,\r\nreading, etc. of books classed as heretical is prohibited. The penalty\r\nis for each offence, excommunication, and a fine of one hundred\r\nscudi. The fine is to be divided equally between the informer, the\r\nInquisition, and the imperial representative. Persons concealing\r\nbooks, or withholding information, incur the same penalties. Printers,\r\nbinders, and booksellers must, within a term of two months, deliver\r\nto the authorities a sworn schedule of the books handled by them,\r\nwith supplementary lists from month to month, and the sale, or the\r\npossession of, any book not specified in such schedules brings upon the\r\ndealer excommunication and a fine of ten scudi for each book. Dealers\r\nwho deliver up within ten days after receipt copies of prohibited or\r\nof heretical books are freed from the penalties. Any person having\r\nknowledge of the presence in the diocese of Milan of a heretic or of\r\none suspected of heresy, and failing to give information within thirty\r\ndays, falls under excommunication plus a fine of fifty scudi. The same\r\npenalty comes to one who renders assistance to a Lutheran or other\r\nheretic. A Lutheran or other heretic who recants and who denounces a\r\nfellow heretic receives one fourth of the penalty.\r\n\r\nThe Index contains nearly five hundred titles, arranged alphabetically,\r\nthe names of the authors and those of the books being listed together.\r\nIt is therefore much more considerable than that of Casa. The list\r\nof authors all of whose works (present and future) are condemned\r\n(corresponding to Class I of the Roman Indexes) is proportionately\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n_10._ _1551._ _Valentia, Valladolid, and Toledo._ _Emperor Charles\r\nV and Archbishop Valdes.--Index prohibitory._ Compiled under\r\nthe supervision of Fernando Valdes, Archbishop of Seville and\r\nInquisitor-General. The Emperor Charles sent to Valdes the Louvain\r\nIndex of 1550 with instructions to have the same published in Spain.\r\nThe Spanish issue includes as a supplement a list of the books which\r\nup to that date had been prohibited in Spain. The title reads:\r\n_Catalogi librorum reprobatorum, et praelegendorum ex judicio Academiae\r\nLouaniensis. Cum edicto Caesarae maiestatis evulgate. Valentiae,\r\ntypis Joannis Mey Flandri MDLI, mandato Dominorum de consilio sanctae\r\ngeneralis Inquisitionis._ (Portions of the edition bear the imprints of\r\nValladolid and Toledo).\r\n\r\nThe first list in the volume bears the title: _Catalogus librorum\r\njampridem per sanctum officium Inquisitionis reprobatorum_. This is\r\nfollowed by the Latin lists of the Louvain Index, with the anonymous\r\nworks alphabeted in, and a supplement with eleven further titles.\r\nThis Valdes Index is the first of the Spanish series, and forms the\r\nfoundation of the Index of 1559.\r\n\r\nLlorente mentions[116] an Index prepared in 1555 under the instructions\r\nof the Inquisition, but states that this was kept in the form of\r\nmanuscript for the use only of the inquisitors. Valdes was concerned\r\nwith the compilation of two further Indexes, those of 1554 and 1559.\r\n\r\nThe supplement to the lists of 1551 presents certain general\r\nprohibitions; such as of Bibles in Spanish or in any vernacular\r\nversions; (these are entered curiously under the letter “N,” “New\r\nand Old Testaments”); pictures, figures or statues by means of which\r\nthe Virgin or the Saints might be brought into ridicule; all books\r\ntainted with heresy (_sapiento haeresim_); works having to do with\r\nnecromancy; books (whatsoever their text) which had been printed\r\nwithin twenty-five years, and which failed to present the name and\r\naddress of the printer. A separate prohibition is provided for books\r\nwritten against the proceedings of the Diet of Ratisbon (1541). This\r\nis directed against a monograph by Calvin, published anonymously,\r\nin which this Diet is sharply handled. The lists report the authors\r\ngiven in the Louvain Index, in some instances with fresh errors\r\n(“Bronzins” for “Brentius”). The new names include Michael Servetus\r\n(his first appearance in any Index), connected with his tract on\r\nthe Trinity; Simon Essius, for Simon Hessus, connected with his\r\n_Apologia_; John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (possibly the earliest\r\nEnglish author prohibited outside of England); Ulrich von Hutten,\r\n_libri omnes_ (Hutten, while not listed in Louvain, had been recorded\r\nby Casa); Alcoranus _vel alii libri in arabigo ubi sunt errores sectae\r\nMahometicae_ (this is the first appearance in an Index of Arabic\r\nheresy). As late as 1790, the _Koran_, in every version, finds place in\r\nthe Spanish Index, while there is a special prohibition of the Latin\r\ntranslation of the same that had been made in the 12th century by\r\nPeter of Cluny, and had been printed, _cum refutationibus variorum_,\r\nin Basel in 1543. In the Index of Quiroga, the _Koran_ appears under\r\nthe title _Machumetis ... ejusque successorum vitae ac doctrina ipseque\r\nAlcoran ... adjunctae sunt confutationes multorum una cum M. Lutheri\r\npraemonitione_, etc.\r\n\r\nReusch points out that this prohibition has to do not with the\r\ndoctrines of the _Koran_ but with the godless (_impia_) undertakings\r\nof the publisher, Theodor Bibliander of Basel. In the Index of Clement\r\nVIII, the entry appears, _Instructionum et rituum sectae Mahometanae\r\nlibri omnes_. Since Benedict XIV, the prohibition comes under the\r\ngeneral decree I, 11.\r\n\r\nThe antagonism on the part of the Protestant authorities of Basel to\r\nthe circulation of the _Koran_ appears to have been more decided than\r\nthat of the Inquisition. In 1536, the magistrates refused permission to\r\nHeinrich Petri to print an edition; and, in 1542, an edition printed\r\nby Oporinus was confiscated. The publisher appealed to the scholars,\r\nand the question of permitting the publication was discussed from\r\nthe pulpits. On the receipt of an opinion from Luther in favour of\r\nOporinus, the books were released on condition that when published they\r\nshould not bear the imprint of Basel and that copies should not be sold\r\nwithin the city.\r\n\r\nThis Valdes Index contains but four Spanish titles, the writings of\r\nEnzinas and of Urrea, an anonymous _Dialogue of Christian Doctrine_,\r\nand a Spanish version, printed in Geneva, of Calvin’s _Catechism_. This\r\nlast title does not appear in later lists.\r\n\r\n_11._ _1554._ _Valladolid._ _Senate of the Inquisition.--Index\r\nexpurgatorius. Censura generalis contra errores quibus recentes\r\nhaeretici sacram scripturam asperserunt. Edita a supremo Senatu\r\nInquisitionis, constituto adversus haereticam pravitatem, et apostasiam\r\nin Hispania, et aliis regnis, et dominis Caesareae majestatis\r\nsubjectis. Pinciae, ex officina Francis Ferdinan. Corduben. cum\r\nprivilegio Imperiali. 1554._\r\n\r\nThe text is known through the reprint by Ziletus in Venice, in 1562.\r\n\r\nThe lists in this Index are devoted exclusively to Bibles, of which 103\r\neditions are specified. Many of these find place in Louvain, 1550, and\r\nin Valdes, 1554, among the books entirely prohibited. Here, however,\r\nthese Bibles are presented as open to censure on the ground of certain\r\nerrors and heresies contained in the notes and introductions, which\r\nnotes, etc., are ordered to be cancelled or expunged. Copies thus\r\ncorrected (by cancellations) are permitted to be left in the hands of\r\ntheir owners. This Index of Valdes is the first example of an _Index\r\nexpurgatorius_. A number of such expurgatory Indexes were produced\r\nlater under the authority of the Spanish Inquisition, but outside of\r\nSpain, the attempts to control literature through the expurgation of\r\nbooks already printed were but few. The futility of such attempts came\r\nto be recognised at an early date.\r\n\r\nThe editorial responsibility for this Index of 1554 rested with the\r\nDominican, Alfonso Martinez, who was also the author of the _censura\r\ngeneralis_. The editor had the co-operation of the theological faculty\r\nof Alcala. The possessors of copies of the works specified are directed\r\nto deliver these within sixty days to the bishop of the diocese or\r\nto the local inquisitors. These officials are to take measures to\r\ncancel (_obliterare_) the offending notes, etc., so that they can no\r\nlonger be read. The penalty for retaining uncorrected copies beyond\r\nthe period of sixty days is _excommunicatio major latae sententiae_.\r\nThe books themselves are to be destroyed, and their delinquent owners\r\nare to pay (apparently for each offence) a fine of thirty ducats. A\r\nsimilar punishment comes upon the bookseller who imports copies of\r\nthese condemned editions. The publishing centres at that time actively\r\nengaged in the production of editions of the Scriptures are indicated\r\nby the imprints represented in the lists of this Index as follows:\r\nAntwerp, 14; Basel, 3; Lyons, 35; Paris, 11 (including 4 from Robert\r\nEstienne); Zurich, 1 (Froschover); Venice, 3. Two examples may be cited\r\nto illustrate the principles and the method of the censure.\r\n\r\nDeuteronomy v, 9. _Solus Deus adorandus._\r\n\r\n_Haec propositio, excludens adorationem sanctorum, est erronea._\r\n\r\nDeut. xv, 11. _Alendi pauperes nec permittendi ut mendicant._\r\n\r\n_Et ibidem. Prohibetur mendicitas._\r\n\r\n_Hae et similes propositiones injuriosae sunt et malitiose annotatae\r\nin odium religiosorum mendicantium._\r\n\r\nSpecial condemnation is placed upon the Bibles printed by Estienne\r\n(Stephanus) as edited by Vatablus. The New Testament division is to\r\nbe cancelled altogether, the errors being too many to expunge. The\r\nOld Testament can be retained with the cancellation of the notes\r\n(_scholia_).\r\n\r\n_12._ _1554._ _Venice._ _The Inquisition._ A few months after the\r\npublication of the Index of Milan, an Index was issued in Venice under\r\nthe authority of the Venetian Inquisition. The papal Nuncio, Filippo\r\nArchinto (who succeeded Arcimboldi as Archbishop of Milan), shared with\r\nthe inquisitors the responsibility for the preparation of the lists. Of\r\nthe original issue no copy is known to exist. The description given by\r\nReusch is based on the reprint published by the persistent Vergerio.\r\nThe Index is accompanied by no decree. The catalogue bears as a heading\r\nthe words: _Nomina eorum qui male de fide scripserunt quorum scripta\r\na catholicis legi prohibentur_. The lists comprise a reprint of the\r\ntitles of the Milan Index with the addition of some seventy entries. An\r\nappendix gives the decree of Gelasius (492) together with a few of the\r\nbook prohibitions of the Middle Ages taken from Eymeric. This Venetian\r\nIndex was utilised as the basis of the lists compiled for the Index of\r\nPaul IV.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian and Milan compilers themselves made use of the material\r\ncollected by the Louvain compilers of 1550, and of the titles in\r\nthe Casa Index of 1549. They had also taken from the catalogue of\r\nLutzenburg and from the _Bibliotheca_ of Gesner the names of a number\r\nof the heretics of the Middle Ages. Further names were secured,\r\ncuriously enough, from the letters of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, and\r\nthese last were cited so heedlessly that they include those of a number\r\nof persons who were not, in any respect, authors.[117] Reusch points\r\nout that in the endeavour, without adequate knowledge, to make their\r\nlists comprehensive, the compilers had been led to include a number of\r\nunimportant persons some of whom had published nothing religious or\r\ntheological, while others were, as said, not authors at all. In some\r\ninstances, large sounding entries cover simply the Latin rendering of\r\nthe titles of insignificant German tracts (_flügschriften_).\r\n\r\nThe Venetian Index was reprinted (from Vergerio’s reprint) in\r\nLondon, 1840, by Joseph Mendham, in connection with a reprint of\r\nthe Index of Gregory XXI of 1835. Mendham uses as a general title,\r\n_The Literary Policy of the Church of Rome_. The compilers of this\r\nIndex, like those of Milan, have included the names of a number of\r\npersons classed as heretics in the earlier Middle Ages and before the\r\ninvention of printing, some of whom had never written anything, while\r\nof others no writings had been preserved. To this class belong the\r\nWycliffite Richard “Anglicus,” the Hussite, Mathias Boemus, Desiderius\r\nLongobardus, Joh. de Poliaco, Petrus de Aragonia, Joh. de Stuma, and\r\nPetrus de Luna. These names are taken from Lutzenburg. Of the series\r\nof names taken from the Louvain Index of 1550, a number are so altered\r\n(either by scribes or by printers) as to be identified with difficulty.\r\nFrom the Index of 1546 are taken Petrus Lignius, and the _Facetiae_\r\nof Poggio and of Bebel. From Gesner are taken thirty writers some\r\nof whom are responsible for no books at all either in theology or\r\nreligion.[118] The list includes Maturin Cordier, the instructor of\r\nCalvin, who appears for the first time in the Venetian Index. Other\r\nnames and titles to be noted are Dante, for the _De Monarchia_ (which\r\nwas printed for the first time in 1559, in Germany, and first in Italy\r\nin 1658), Laurentius Valla, Hubmeyer (whose name was secured from a\r\nletter of Zwingli), Botzheim (friend of Erasmus), _Dialogi Obscurorum\r\nVirorum_, Eckstein, and Murnarus for his _Leviathan_.\r\n\r\nThe appendix contains a prohibition, taken from Eymeric, of all works\r\non the subjects of geomancy, necromancy, and pyromancy.\r\n\r\n_13._ _1558._ _Louvain._ In December, 1557, an _ordonnance_ of King\r\nPhilip II directed the preparation by the theological faculty of\r\nLouvain of a revised and enlarged issue of the Index of 1550. This was\r\nprinted, in Flemish and in French, in 1558. The preface, signed by the\r\nRector of the University, states:\r\n\r\n“It is well known to all that, since 1550, avowed heretics and others\r\nwhose catholicity is not to be trusted, have brought secretly into the\r\nland pernicious and dangerous books, through the influence of which\r\nthe heretics are confirmed in their errors and the faithful are led\r\nastray. It is the purpose of the present work to secure the destruction\r\nof the existing copies of this baneful literature and to protect\r\nthe land against the introduction of further similar books. _Le\r\nCatalogue des livres reprouvéz et des livres que l’on pourra lire aux\r\nenfans és escholles particulières, selon le jugement de l’université de\r\nLouvain. Imprimé par ordonnance de la Majesté Royale. Á Louvain. Par\r\nMartin Verhassett. Imprimeur juré. L’an de grace MDLVIII. Avec Grace et\r\nPrivilège du Roy._\r\n\r\n(Then follows a second title-page in Flemish.)\r\n\r\nThe lists contain, with some corrections, the titles printed in 1550.\r\nThe additions (distributed alphabetically) comprise about one hundred\r\ntitles. The bibliography is much more correct, in the matter of names,\r\nbook-titles, freedom from duplicate entries, and consistency of\r\narrangement, than that of the Italian lists of the same period. Among\r\nthe new names in Class I (authors all of whose works are condemned) are\r\nthose of Jo. Athanisius Veluanus, Jo. Sleidanus, and Memno Symonis. The\r\nfirst should read: Jo. Anastasius (Jan Geeraerds ter Stege), Veluanus\r\n(Pastor in Veluve). There are twelve additional titles in the list of\r\nanonymous works.\r\n\r\nThe material of this Louvain Index was undoubtedly utilised by the\r\ncompilers of the Index of Paul IV, but they managed to bring into their\r\ntranscripts a number of errors that did not find place in the original.\r\n\r\n_14._ _1559._ _Valladolid._ _Valdes._--_Catalogus Librorum qui\r\nprohibentur mandato Illustrissimi et Reverend. D. D. Ferdinand de\r\nValdes, Hispalen., Archiepi., Inquisitoris Generalis Hispaniae. Nec\r\nnon et Supremi Sanctae ac Generalis Inquisitionis Senatus. Hoc Anno\r\nMDLIX editus. Quorum jussu et licentia Sebastianus Martinez, Excudebat\r\nPinciae._ The industrious Inquisitor-General had already, as we have\r\nseen, brought into print two Indexes; for the first of these he had\r\nutilised the lists of the Louvain compilers, while the titles in the\r\nsecond were restricted to editions of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nThis Index of 1559 is the first Spanish publication in which the\r\nlists represent original work on the part of the Spanish editors in\r\nthe selection of literature to be condemned. The brief of Paul IV,\r\nprinted in the Valdes Index, which bears date January 4, 1559, gives an\r\nindication of the independent character of the actions of the Spanish\r\nInquisition. Paul states that the Inquisitor-General had informed\r\nhim that the measures taken by the Inquisition against heretical and\r\nsuspicious books had been hampered because of the licenses that had\r\nbeen accorded by the Curia, not only to divines but to many laymen, for\r\nthe reading of such books. The Pope had, however (under his brief of\r\nDecember 21, 1558), recently recalled and cancelled all such licenses.\r\nHe therefore charges Valdes to prohibit absolutely the printing,\r\nselling, reading, or possessing of such books, and to order, under\r\nthe customary penalties, the delivery and destruction of all copies\r\nof the same. To the Inquisitor-General is given the fullest authority\r\nin the matter and no appeals from his decisions will be entertained.\r\nPaul makes no reference in the brief to the Index that had, under his\r\ninstructions, just been brought into print in Rome, and while this is\r\nin form addressed to the whole world, the Pope appears to assume that\r\nas far as the Spanish dominions are concerned, the matter of heretical\r\nliterature is to be left in the charge of the Spanish Inquisition. On\r\nhis part, Valdes makes no reference to the Index of Paul, although\r\nit is hardly to be supposed that he had failed to examine it. In the\r\neditorial preface, Valdes informs the scholars and others who may,\r\nthrough ignorance of their character, have been led into possessing\r\nand reading heretical books that these lists have been prepared for\r\ntheir help and guidance. He says further that those who, with the\r\ninformation presented in these catalogues, may continue to print,\r\nimport, sell, read, or possess copies of the books specified shall be\r\npunished with a fine of two hundred gold ducats and with the greater\r\nexcommunication (_latae sententiae_.) Those who may take part in\r\nthe translating of these works shall be liable to the same penalties.\r\nA curious exception is given in favour of Seb. Martinez, who is\r\npermitted, under the instructions of the Inquisition, to print certain\r\nof the forbidden works. At the close of the Index, the statement is\r\nmade that there are many heretical and dangerous books in addition to\r\nthose whose titles are here given, and that lists of these will be\r\nissued later. In connection with the enforcement of the provisions of\r\nthe Index (a task which was carried out by the Inquisition of Spain\r\nwith a thoroughness that was never attempted elsewhere), the confessors\r\nwere instructed, under penalty of the “reserved excommunication,”\r\nto secure from all their penitents information concerning heretical\r\nliterature possessed either by themselves or by others.\r\n\r\nThrough a brief of January 7th, Valdes is given authority, for a term\r\nof two years, to take measures against bishops who may be charged\r\nwith the utilising of heretical literature, and, if necessary, to\r\nrelieve them of their duties and to place them in confinement. He is\r\ninstructed to report to the Curia such cases of arrest and to send to\r\nRome the record of the evidence. This special authority appears to\r\nhave been secured by Valdes for the particular purpose of proceeding\r\nagainst Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo. Through a brief of January\r\n11th, King Philip II is instructed to take such measures as might be\r\nnecessary for confirming and carrying into effect the regulations of\r\nthe Inquisition. Professors who had been applying themselves to the\r\nstudy of Oriental languages were not to be freed from the obligation to\r\ndeliver up, under penalty of excommunication, (possibly for revision or\r\nfor the cancellation of heretical notes,) copies of the Scriptures in\r\nHebrew or in Greek. Such copies in the hands of the booksellers were to\r\nbe destroyed. Among the books specially marked out for sequestration,\r\nwere works of grammar containing the notes of Melanchthon (who was at\r\nthe time largely engaged in the compilation of school-books to replace\r\nthe earlier monkish texts); all Bibles printed in Germany since 1519\r\nwithout the imprint of the publishers; the editions of St. Chrysostom\r\nby Oecolampadius and Musculus (the first complete editions, by the\r\nway, of the works of this Father that had yet appeared), and the\r\nCommentaries of Vadiamus on Pomponius Mela.\r\n\r\nThe editions with heretical imprints, which had been proscribed by\r\nPaul, of such authors as Lucian, Aristotle, Plato, and Seneca, were not\r\nforbidden by Valdes.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Valdes differs from that of Paul in two respects:\r\n\r\nFirst, the books are classified according to languages, the order\r\nof arrangement being Latin, Spanish, Flemish, Low German, High\r\nGerman, French, and Portuguese. The arrangement of titles is roughly\r\nalphabetical, with frequent confusion in connection with forenames and\r\nsurnames.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Valdes does not undertake to present the three classes which\r\nhad been accepted as a precedent for the Roman Indexes. Class I may be\r\nsaid, however, to find place in the general alphabet in which appear\r\nthe names of a number of authors with the prohibition of _opera omnia_.\r\nThe formula _donec corrigatur_ does not find place in the Valdes Index.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the titles in this Valdes Index are taken from\r\nthe lists in the Spanish reprint of the Louvain Index of 1550. It is\r\ndifficult to trace the principle on which either the omissions or the\r\nselections of these Louvain titles have been arrived at. The additions\r\nmade by the compilers of the Inquisition cover in the main such of the\r\nReformation writings as had found their way into Spain through the\r\nLow Countries. The editors make no reference to preceding Indexes but\r\npresent this as if it could be accepted as a substantially complete\r\nguide for believing readers. The _Historia Ecclesiastica_ of Albert\r\nKranz (1517) finds place in the Valdes Index for the first time among\r\nprohibited books. Bellarmin writes later that the editions of this\r\nhistorian are to be condemned simply on the ground of the godless notes\r\nadded by heretical editors.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy title which also here first finds condemnation is that of\r\nthe _Gesta Romanorum_. The compilation of these old legends of the\r\nChurch has been ascribed to the Cistercian Helimand (†1227). This book\r\nwas first condemned in 1472, when the first printed edition was issued\r\nin Cologne. It was often reprinted. An edition was issued in New York\r\nas late as 1901.\r\n\r\nAnother prohibited title is that of _Hortulus Animae Absque Nomini\r\nAuthoris_. Of this book there had been a great variety of editions,\r\nin one or more of which heretical editors had included scoffing\r\npictures. The text included fifteen prayers of St. Bridget. Of these\r\nprayers it was said that if they should be repeated during an entire\r\nyear, fifteen souls would be saved from everlasting punishment. In the\r\nsame edition, there is a prayer to the Virgin to which was ascribed\r\nespecial soul-saving value. In Aragon, for instance, in the year 1290,\r\none sinner who had during the preceding year sung this hymn daily,\r\nwas able, after being beheaded, to retain his soul in the body until\r\nall his sins had been confessed and he had received absolution. It\r\nwould seem as if this book belonged to the class that should have been\r\nretained _donec corrigatur_.[119]\r\n\r\nLlorente, in his description of this Index, refers to a story of Saint\r\nTheresa, who, when she complained of the unjust proscriptions of\r\ncertain orthodox books, was answered by the Lord: “Disturb not thyself,\r\nI will give thee the book of life.”\r\n\r\nThe entry in the Index of 1559 under the name Desiderius Erasmus is\r\nnoteworthy. The name is placed in Class I, comprising authors all of\r\nwhose writings are prohibited. After the name of Erasmus however,\r\nthere follows a specific prohibition as follows: _Cum universis\r\nCommentariis, Annotationibus, Scholiis, Diologis, Epistolis, Censuris,\r\nVersionibus, Libris et Scriptis suis, etiam si nil penitus contra\r\nReligionem vel de Religione contineant_. This specific condemnation,\r\nin addition to that expressed under the term _opera omnia_, would\r\nappear to have included the edition prepared by Erasmus of the Greek\r\nTestament. It may be borne in mind, however, that the latter had\r\nsecured the approval and very cordial commendation of Pope Leo X, to\r\nwhom the work had been dedicated. The Pope wrote, in 1516, a letter in\r\nwhich he emphasises the exceptional service rendered by Erasmus in\r\nthis work to the study of sacred theology and to the maintenance of\r\nthe true faith. A curious comment made upon this action of the Pope,\r\nin the Spanish Index of 1612, may be inserted here. In the expurgatory\r\ndivision, under the article devoted to _Erasmi Roterodami Opera_,\r\nat the beginning of the censures on the sixth volume, is printed: _Ad\r\nmarginem Epistolae Leonis P. P. X. ad Erasmum, quae incipit, Dilecte\r\nFili, salutem, et adscribe: Dulcibus encomiis pius Pater nutantem ovem\r\nallicere conatur_ (“With gracious commendations the Holy Father\r\nendeavours to attract [win back] the wandering sheep”).[120]\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy detail in the Index of 1559 is the entry in the\r\nlist of works condemned of the title _Liber inscrip. consilium * * *\r\nde emendanda ecclesia_. This _Consilium_ was a report presented by an\r\nassembly of four cardinals (including the Englishman, Pole) and five\r\nprelates, which had been instructed by Pope Paul III, in 1537, to\r\ngive him counsel in regard to the reform of the Church. The report or\r\n_Consilium_ was more outspoken (in regard to corruptions, etc.) than\r\nwas considered desirable, and when one of the body, Cardinal Caraffa,\r\nassumed the tiara (as Paul IV) he caused his own _Advice_ to be placed\r\non the list of prohibited books. The Index of 1559 also contains a\r\ncondemnation of the work by Aeneas Sylvius (afterwards Pius II),\r\n_Commentaria de actis et gestis Concilii Basileen_. In the Tridentine\r\nIndex, this condemnation is modified to read, _In actis Aeneae Silvii\r\nprohibentur ea quae ipse in bulla retractationis damnavit_. It is not\r\nout of order to assume that when a man has become a pope, he may be in\r\na position to see things more clearly and to correct the errors of his\r\nfallible days.\r\n\r\n_14._ _1559._ _Rome._ This is the year of the accession of Paul IV, by\r\nwhose name the Index of 1559 is known. Its lists were in part based\r\nupon the Louvain Index of 1558, and were themselves utilised in the\r\npreparation of the Tridentine Index of 1564. It was published during\r\nthe second interregnum in the council, 1552–1562. The title is:\r\n\r\n_Index Auctorum et Librorum qui ab officio Sanctae Rom. et\r\nUniversalis Inquisitionis caveri ab omnibus et singulis in universa\r\nChristiana Republica mandantur, sub censuris contra legentes, vel\r\ntenentes libros prohibitos in Bulla quae dicta est in Coena Domini\r\nexpressis et sub aliis poenis in Decreto ejusdem Sacri officii\r\ncontentis. Index venundatur apud Antonium Bladum. Cameralem impressorem\r\nde mandato speciali Sacri Officii, Romae Anno Domini, 1559, Mense\r\nJan._\r\n\r\nThis is followed by the prohibitory decree of the Inquisition, with a\r\nspecification of the punishments for transgression as set forth in the\r\n_Bulla Coenae Domini_. To these penalties are added others, _nostro\r\narbitrio infligendis_. The chief penalty was the _excommunicatio latae\r\nsententiae_. The Index itself is presented in three schedules or\r\ndivisions arranged alphabetically: I. Authors, all of whose writings,\r\npast or future, are condemned. II. Books, classified by authors. III.\r\nAnonymous works.\r\n\r\nThen follows a list of _Biblia Prohibita_, and of New Testaments, with\r\na general prohibition of all similar translations; and finally a list\r\nof sixty-one printers (printer-publishers) all of whose publications\r\nare condemned. The formula _donec corrigatur_, later so general, occurs\r\nin this Index but once. It is connected with Boccaccio’s _Decameron_.\r\nIn Trent, the prohibition was confirmed subject to expurgation.\r\nThe text of the _Decameron_ was duly corrected by a commission of\r\nfive, and thus corrected was published in Florence in an authorised\r\nand privileged edition in 1572. The revision eliminated from the\r\n_Decameron_ the obnoxious references to ecclesiastics, but left in the\r\ntext a number of episodes _contra bonos mores_ which had to do only\r\nwith laymen. The revisers had, in some of the stories, changed the nuns\r\ninto noble ladies, the monks to conjurers, an abbess to a countess,\r\netc.[121] Paul includes in his Index a prohibition of the treatise\r\nor report that had been prepared in 1538, under the instructions of\r\nPaul III, by a commission of nine and printed in the papal printing\r\noffice under the title of _Consilium delectorum cardinalium et aliorum\r\npraelatorum de emendanda ecclesia_. Cardinal Caraffa, later Paul IV,\r\nwas a member of the commission. The _Consilium_ was issued by Luther,\r\nin 1539, in a German version, with a polemical commentary. It was again\r\nprinted by the ever-watchful Vergerio in 1559, the year of Caraffa’s\r\nelevation to the Papacy. Vergerio did not fail to point out that the\r\nPope was condemning a work for the production of which he was himself\r\nin part responsible. The prohibition remained on the Index until 1758.\r\nIn the Index of this year, the prohibition was modified so as to cover\r\nonly the editions printed with heretical commentaries. The work closes\r\nwith a form of license to be secured for the reading of the works\r\nprohibited. This license was, for some reason, omitted from the later\r\nreprints of the Index.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Paul is described by the Catholic historian Gretser, but\r\nhe admits that his information concerning it is derived from the\r\nProtestant critic Vergerio. This is the first Index prepared under\r\nthe direct supervision of the Pope, and the first which bears the\r\nofficial designation of “Index,” the previous lists having been termed\r\ncatalogues. Editions of Paul’s Index appeared within the year 1559\r\nin Bologna, Venice, Genoa, and Avignon. In 1560, the indefatigable\r\nVergerio reprinted it with a critical, or rather polemical\r\nintroduction. In the same year, Vergerio published, separately,\r\na treatise (in Latin and Italian) devoted to an attack upon the\r\ninquisitors who were responsible for the Index of Paul IV.\r\n\r\nThe title of the Latin edition of Vergerio’s work reads: _Postremus\r\nCatalogus Haereticorum Romae Conflatus. 1559. Continens Alios Quatuor\r\nCatalogos qui post Decennium in Italia nec non eos omnes qui in Gallia\r\net Flandria post renatum Evangelium fuerunt editi. Cum Annotationibus\r\nVergerii, MDLX Colophon, Corvinus excudebat Pfortzheimii, 1560._\r\nThe volume is dedicated to Count Stanislaus. The Italian edition was\r\nprinted at Ulm and dedicated to the King of Bohemia. The author’s\r\npreface is dated from Tübingen. The author states that the Index or\r\nCatalogue of 1559 was concocted by the Pope with the concurrence of six\r\ninquisitors only. Vergerio goes on to say that when, ten years back,\r\nthe Pope observed that the Gospel and books favourable to the Gospel\r\nwere making their way into Italy, he published, in imitation of the\r\ndivines of the Sorbonne and of Louvain, a small catalogue condemning\r\nseventy books.\r\n\r\nThe _Annotations_ of Vergerio, irrespective of the interest of their\r\nsevere criticisms on the judicial action and the bibliographical\r\nblunders of the inquisitors, have proved of service in preserving the\r\nmost complete enumeration of the Italian Indexes prior to 1559. The\r\nsources of information concerning these earlier Indexes are, in fact,\r\nso scanty and in the main so untrustworthy that the papal historians\r\nthemselves have been under the necessity of accepting the record of\r\ntheir Protestant critic.\r\n\r\nThe task of compiling the Index of 1559 had been confided by Paul\r\nto Cardinal Caraffa and his associates of the Roman Inquisition. An\r\nimpression was struck off in 1557, but was cancelled on account of\r\nerrors that had come to light. The lists as reprinted in 1559 had had\r\nthe advantage of collation with the Louvain Index of 1558. The papal\r\nbrief (dated December 21, 1558) follows in the main the text of that of\r\nJulius III, of 1550, but there is some new material. One of the earlier\r\nsentences is typical of the difficulty of the problems with which the\r\nChurch found itself confronted:\r\n\r\n   “A number of ecclesiastics, both regular and secular, who were\r\n   hopeful of being able to combat the Lutherans and the other\r\n   heretics of our time and to overthrow their heretical doctrines,\r\n   and who secured for the purpose permission from the Apostolic\r\n   Chair to read the works of these heretics, found themselves\r\n   confused and influenced by these writings so that they were\r\n   quite largely led astray and perverted into the acceptance of\r\n   heretical errors. It has therefore, been found necessary to\r\n   recall and to cancel all such permits issued in Briefs or in\r\n   Bulls, whether given to bishops, archbishops, or cardinals, to\r\n   marquises, dukes, kings, or emperors.”\r\n\r\nThe only exceptions to this general cancellation are in the case of\r\nthe inquisitors-general and certain cardinals, who may, from time to\r\ntime, be charged by the Curia with special duties in the examination\r\nand classification of literature. Copies of the books condemned are\r\nto be delivered to the officials appointed by the Inquisition for\r\nthe purpose. All the faithful are charged with the duty of giving\r\ninformation concerning such copies as may become known to them. The\r\nbrief is to be published in Rome by the Inquisition and elsewhere by\r\neach bishop in his own diocese. The lists in the first class include\r\n(given, for the most part, in two places under both surname and\r\nforename) Calvin, Luther, Melanchthon, Zasius, Pirckheimer. Cassander,\r\nBlaurerus, Oecolampadius, Zwingli, Islebius, and Hütten (printed\r\nHuldrychus Huttenus). English names to be noted are John Rogers\r\n(printed John Rochors), Nicholas Ridley (Nic. Ridlaeus), and Thos.\r\nCranmer. The name of Erasmus, omitted here, finds place in Class II\r\nagainst several of his works. These lists are, says Vergerio, marked by\r\nmany errors and inconsistencies. In the third class, under the heading\r\n_Libri_ are given certain general prohibitions of which the\r\nfollowing may be cited as examples:\r\n\r\nAll books and tracts (pamphlets) are forbidden, whatever may be their\r\ntitles, or their subject-matter, and in whatever language they may be\r\nwritten ... and whether they be original productions or translations,\r\nwhich have been written by heretics, or which may be printed by\r\nheretics ... even when such books contain no material bearing upon\r\nfaith or religion.[122] Also all books which, within the preceding\r\nforty years have been issued without the name of the author, and the\r\nname and address of the printer, or for which have not been secured\r\nthe approval and license of the bishop or inquisitor, or of some\r\nother official appointed for the purpose by the pope or by the\r\ninquisitors. Record of such permit must be printed in each copy of the\r\nbook. Forbidden also are all books having to do with the subjects of\r\naeromancy, cheiromancy, physiognomy, geomancy, hydromancy, oneiromancy,\r\npyromancy, or necromancy, divination, magic, or astrology, (exceptions\r\nare made in favour of treatises on natural science planned for the\r\nguidance of mariners, agriculturists, or physicians); and all books\r\nwhich have been or shall be condemned under the decrees of popes or of\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of every work that had been produced, or that might\r\nthereafter be produced, from the presses of printers classed as\r\nheretics (of whom sixty-one were specified by name) constitutes\r\na new feature in the system of Indexes, and is evidence of the\r\nimportance that had come to be associated with the influence of the\r\nprinter-publishers of the time. The list is alphabeted by forenames.\r\nIt comprises: for Augsburg 1, Sig. Grym; for Basel 15, the most\r\nimportant being the brothers Petri, Oporinus, Cratander, and Wolfius;\r\nfor Frankfort 1, Brubachius; for Genoa 5; for Marburg 2; for Hagenau 1;\r\nfor Leipzig 2, Blum and Wohlrab; for Nuremburg 5, including Montanus;\r\nfor Poschlav (Bohemia) 3; for Strasburg 9, including Ulricher and\r\nthe brothers Richelius; for Tübingen 1, Morhadius; for Venice 1,\r\nBrucciolus; for Wittenburg 5, including Rau, Crato, and Klug; for\r\nZurich 3, including Gesner; for Paris 1, but that one noteworthy,\r\nRobert Estienne, the most scholarly publisher of his generation;\r\nwithout specification of place, 5. The selection of firms gives an\r\nindication of the places which in this matter of heretical publishing\r\nwere at that time considered to be the sources of danger for the\r\ndoctrines and for the believers of the Church. The omission of any name\r\nfrom the Low Countries would indicate that the books from the Dutch and\r\nFlemish presses were not making their way into Italy and were not known\r\nto the members of the Roman Inquisition.\r\n\r\nChristopher of Padua, General of the Augustinians, who had had to do\r\nwith this Index, stated at Trent that in the work of its preparation,\r\ncareful examination had been made of all the heretical books in the\r\nlibrary of the Vatican. The compilers had utilised, in addition to the\r\nlists of Louvain, of Venice, and of Casa, certain lists which Reusch\r\ntraces to the “Library” (Bibliothek) of Gesner, and to Cochlaeus’s\r\n_Historia de Actis et Scriptis M. Lutheri_. Further titles are taken\r\nfrom the “Letters” of Oecolampadius and of Zwingli. Certain omissions\r\nof noteworthy and “deserving” names or titles, which were available in\r\nprevious lists, such as Beza, recorded in the Venice Index, and the\r\n_Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_, which appears in Louvain, were due\r\ndoubtless simply to oversights in transcribing. A curious entry in\r\nClass II is _Arturus Britannus_, which stands for the _Legend of King\r\nArthur_ and which is responsible for the appearance in later Indexes\r\nof the heretical author “Thomas Arturus.” The entry in Class I of the\r\nname of an author was not permitted to stand in the way of a separate\r\ncondemnation in Class II or in Class III (under individual titles) of\r\nhis more pernicious productions.\r\n\r\nThis Index of Paul IV seemed to call for some special measure of\r\nattention in this schedule, because it is the first prepared in\r\nRome under the direct instructions of the pope, and because in its\r\ngeneral purpose and policy, in the method of its compilation, in its\r\ncharacteristic features, and its bibliographical errors, it was\r\ntypical of the whole series of Indexes, and was in fact quite closely\r\nfollowed not only by that of Trent, but by not a few of those that\r\ncame later. The policy of the Church in its contest with the perils of\r\nan uncontrolled printing-press may be said to have been marked out in\r\n1559 by Paul IV and his associates. The fact that the lists included,\r\nin addition to works by admitted heretics and to those concerned with\r\nmatters of theology, faith, and dogma, a number of books by Catholic\r\nwriters in good standing, others whose subjects were entirely outside\r\nof theology and religion, and a further number whose only fault was\r\nthat of being printed by heretical printers, is an indication of the\r\nwide view taken by the framers of the Index, and doubtless by Paul\r\nhimself, as to the responsibilities of the Church in the supervision of\r\nliterature. The Index of Paul may also be considered as a declaration\r\nthat the responsibility for the supervision and characterisation of\r\nliterary productions belonged properly to the head of the Church and\r\ncould not safely be left to be cared for by princes, universities, or\r\nlocal inquisitors. It seems very probable that Paul and his advisers\r\nof the Roman Inquisition had such a contention in mind, but as the\r\nrecord of the production of later Indexes makes clear, the authorities\r\nin Rome proved unequal to the task of controlling the prohibition\r\nof books, and were obliged to accept, with more or less protest, a\r\nconsiderable series of Indexes compiled under the direction of kings,\r\nprinces, universities, local inquisitors, and local ecclesiastics. The\r\nfact that the work came to be carried on by a number of authorities\r\nof varying character and with certain inevitable differences of\r\npurpose, of policy, and of method, caused the results to be more\r\nor less inconsistent and incongruous. An obedient believer, whose\r\ndesire was simply to accept and be guided by the instructions of the\r\nauthorities, might easily have found himself not a little perplexed at\r\nthe conflicting instructions that came to him in regard to this matter\r\nof pernicious literature, in the two centuries between the Index of\r\nLouvain and that of Benedict XIV. An example of the effect produced\r\nby this Index on the mind of one Roman scholar is given in a letter\r\nwritten in January, 1559 (immediately after the publication of the\r\nIndex) by Latinus Latinius to Andrea Masius[123]:\r\n\r\n   “Why should you be planning for the publication of any new\r\n   works at a time when nearly all the books which have thus far\r\n   appeared (_qui adhuc sunt editi_) are being taken away from\r\n   us? It seems to me that at least for some years to come, no one\r\n   among us will dare to write anything but letters. There has\r\n   just been published an Index of the books which, under penalty\r\n   of excommunication, we are no longer permitted to possess. The\r\n   number of those prohibited (particularly of works originating\r\n   in Germany) is so great that there will remain but few. On\r\n   this ground, I advise you to put to one side your variants of\r\n   the Bible and the translation of Demosthenes. Faernus has been\r\n   devoting some days to the ‘purifying’ of his library; I shall\r\n   begin to-morrow going over my own collection so that nothing may\r\n   be found in it which is not authorised. Should I describe the\r\n   process as a shipwreck or a holocaust of literature? In any case\r\n   this [censorship] must have the result of deterring many of your\r\n   group from the production of books, and will serve as a warning\r\n   to the printers to be cautious in making selections for their\r\n   presses.”\r\n\r\nIt may be understood, although it is not specifically so stated, that\r\nthe books delivered over to the bishops or inquisitors were burned.\r\nNatalis Comes writes (possibly with some rhetorical exaggeration),\r\n“There was everywhere such a conflagration of books, that one was\r\nreminded of the burning of Troy. Neither private nor public libraries\r\nwere spared, and many were nearly emptied.... In all the cities of\r\nItaly, readers were mourning for their lost treasures.”[124] A letter\r\nfrom Bologna dated February 11, 1559, says: “The prescriptions of the\r\nIndex are obeyed here. Nothing is permitted but the _Thesaurus linguae\r\nlatinae_ and the _Commentaries_ of Dolet. Of the writings of Erasmus,\r\none is permitted to retain nothing but one or two of the translations\r\n[of the Fathers] and in these the name of the translator must be\r\ncancelled.”[125]\r\n\r\nBullinger writes to Ambrose Blaurer: “In Rome, Paul IV is burning\r\nbooks, and among others, all the writings of Erasmus. Even the works\r\nof Cyprian, Jerome, and Augustine are included because they have been\r\nrendered pernicious through the notes of Erasmus.”[126]\r\n\r\nPaul IV died in August, 1559, and after his death, the enforcement\r\nof the provisions and regulations of his Index was very materially\r\nrelaxed. In Venice (a State which in connection with its early and\r\nimportant interests in the production of books maintained from the\r\noutset a protest against the efforts of Rome to control the work of\r\nthe printing-press) this Index was never put into force. The Viceroy\r\nof Naples and the Governor of Milan refused to permit the publication\r\nof the Index in their territories, but referred the matter to the\r\nKing of Spain. The magistrates of Basel, Zurich, and Frankfort and of\r\nother centres of book-production made application to Cosmo, Duke of\r\nTuscany, to protect the interests of their printers. A report prepared\r\nfor Cosmo by the jurist Livio Torelli stated that the execution of the\r\npapal decree would bring upon Florence an immediate loss in property of\r\n100,000 ducats, and would cause the ruin of the printer-publishers and\r\nbooksellers whose business was of increasing importance to the city;\r\nwhile it would also call for the destruction of the supplies of Bibles\r\nand classics and of other valuable literature which had been produced\r\nfor Italian scholars by the printers of Germany and of France. Under\r\npressure from the Cardinal of Alessandria, the Duke finally ordered the\r\nburning of all books which were opposed to religion and of those having\r\nto do with magic and astrology, which order was duly carried out on the\r\n8th of March on the Piazza San Giovanni. The Duke refused to permit the\r\ndestruction of books outside of those two classes, and (as patron of\r\nthe monastery) prohibited the monks of San Marco, who wanted to carry\r\nout the decree in full, from burning any of the volumes presented by\r\nhis predecessors to the library of the monastery. Outside of Italy,\r\nexcepting in the town of Avignon, very little attempt was made to put\r\ninto force the provisions of the Index. In Spain, it was never brought\r\ninto print. In France, the application for a privilege to print was\r\nreferred to a committee of doctors of the Sorbonne, and from this\r\ncommittee no report appears to have been made. Arias Montanus writes\r\nNovember 16, 1571: “This Index has caused indignation to all scholars,\r\nand not only in France and in Spain, but in many portions of Italy,\r\nthey decline to respect its injunctions.”[127] Even in the preface to\r\nthe Index of Trent, it is noted that the Index of Paul IV had failed\r\nto secure acceptance in many provinces because it included in its lists\r\nof prohibited books many whose use was essential for scholars. In\r\nseveral respects, the framers of the Index of Trent, which became the\r\nauthority for the Church, found occasion to modify and to mitigate the\r\nsweeping severity of the provisions of the Index of Paul, while Valdes,\r\nInquisitor-General of Spain, refused to permit these provisions to be\r\nput into force within that kingdom. It is evident that the officials\r\nwho had, under the instructions of Paul, compiled this first Roman\r\nIndex were considered by many of their contemporaries, as well as by\r\ntheir successors, to have done their work in too sweeping a fashion,\r\nand with an ignorance, or a disregard of, the legitimate requirements\r\nof scholars in good standing within the Church, who had a just claim to\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nA repeated complaint on the part of the critics of the censorship\r\noperations under Paul IV was the ignorance and the heedlessness of the\r\nexaminers who had in their hands the responsibility for passing upon\r\nthe works of scholars. The books of the great leaders of thought were,\r\nit was charged, placed under the control of ignorance and mediocrity.\r\nThe work of a learned commentator of St. Chrysostom or of the Psalmist\r\nwas to be condemned by examiners who had no knowledge either of Greek\r\nor of Hebrew. Under such a system, it might still be possible for\r\nscholars to carry on their researches with a patience adequate for the\r\nproduction of compilations, but it was not possible to preserve for\r\noriginal thinkers the serenity of soul and the independence of spirit\r\nrequired for the production of really great works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n         THE COUNCIL OF TRENT AND THE INDEX OF PIUS IV, 1564.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rome, 1564._ _Pius IV, Council of Trent._--_Index librorum\r\nprohibitorum cum regulis confectis per Patres a Tridentinae Synodo\r\ndelectos, auctoritate Sanctis D. N. Pii IV Pont. Max., comprobatus.\r\nRomae, apud Paulum Manutium, Aldi F. 1564._\r\n\r\nThis is the first Index which has behind it the authority of a general\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nAs early as April, 1546, in the fourth session, a papal decree entitled\r\n_De editione et usu librorum sacrorum_ was received and accepted\r\nby the council. This presents the general grounds for the authority\r\nof the Vulgate, the principles that are to control the interpretation\r\nof the Scriptures, a prohibition of any wrongful use or citations of\r\nthe works of the Bible, and, finally, instructions to the council to\r\nframe regulations for the supervision and control of the work of the\r\nprinting-press, “the operations of which as now uncontrolled tend to\r\npernicious license and injury to the faith of the community and to the\r\nauthority of the Church.” Certain suggestions follow concerning the\r\nnecessity for a close supervision of the text of the Scriptures to the\r\nend that it may be printed without error, omission, or interpolation,\r\nand the further necessity of forbidding the printing of any books\r\nhaving to do with religion or with the Scriptures which have not\r\nsecured the approval of examiners appointed by the Church. The approval\r\nof such books must be given in writing and must be recorded in every\r\nwritten or printed copy. Anonymous books must in no case receive\r\napproval.[128]\r\n\r\nTwo archbishops, Beccatelli and Selvaggio, deprecated the discussion\r\nof the subject as calculated to impede the principal object of the\r\ncouncil; since Paul IV had, with the counsel and assistance of all\r\nthe Inquisitions, formed a most complete catalogue, nothing could be\r\nadded but books edited within the two years that had elapsed since\r\nits publication, an act undeserving of the labour of the synod. To\r\nreverse any condemnation in that Index would be to reflect imprudence\r\non Rome; and while such action would lessen the authority of the Index\r\nof Paul, it would also injure the Council itself. In the redundance of\r\nbooks since the invention of printing, it were better that a thousand\r\ninnocent ones should suffer than that one guilty should escape. Neither\r\nshould reasons be given which would provoke opposition and would impair\r\nthe dignity of laws that ought to rest simply upon their own authority.\r\nCorrection and expurgation were likewise deemed inexpedient as tending\r\nto invite criticism and to make enemies. A contrary opinion, however,\r\nprevailed and at the eighteenth session, a decree was passed declaring\r\nthat as the disease of pernicious books had not yielded to the salutary\r\nmedicine hitherto applied, it was deemed proper that certain Fathers\r\nshould be appointed diligently to examine and to state to the council\r\nwhat was necessary to be done respecting the censure of books. In its\r\nlast session, the council referred to the judgment of the pope the work\r\nthat had been prepared by its committee, and publication of the same\r\nwas made in Rome in 1564.\r\n\r\nThe most permanent portion of the work of this council was the series\r\nof Ten Rules prepared as a guide and instruction for all ecclesiastics\r\nor other authorities who might thereafter be charged with the duty\r\nof literary censorship. These Rules were reprinted in nearly all\r\nsubsequent papal Indexes, while in the Spanish Indexes they formed\r\nthe basis of the more or less modified Rules promulgated by the\r\ninquisitors. Sixtus V (1585) replaced the Tridentine Rules with a new\r\nseries of regulations, but they were reissued by Clement VIII (1592)\r\nwith a few additions. They find place in the two Indexes of Leo XIII,\r\n1896 and 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _The Ten Rules of the Tridentine Index_[129]\r\n\r\nI. All books condemned by the supreme pontiffs, or general councils,\r\nbefore the year 1515, and not comprised in the present Index, are,\r\nnevertheless, to be considered as condemned.\r\n\r\nII. The books of heresiarchs, whether of those who broached or\r\ndisseminated their heresies prior to the year above-mentioned, or of\r\nthose who have been, or are, the heads or leaders of heretics, as\r\nLuther, Zwingli, Calvin, Balthasar, Pacimontanus, Swenchfeld, and\r\nothers similar, are altogether forbidden, whatever may be their titles\r\nor subjects. And the books of other heretics, which treat professedly\r\nupon religion, are totally condemned; but those which do not treat\r\nupon religion are allowed to be read, after having been examined and\r\napproved by Catholic divines by order of the bishops and inquisitors.\r\nThose Catholic books also are permitted to be read which have been\r\ncomposed by authors who have afterwards fallen into heresy, or who,\r\nafter their fall, have returned into the bosom of the Church, provided\r\nthese have been approved by the theological faculty of some Catholic\r\nuniversity, or by the general Inquisition.\r\n\r\nIII. Translations of ecclesiastical writers, which have been hitherto\r\npublished by condemned authors, are permitted to be read, if they\r\ncontain nothing contrary to sound doctrine. Translations of the Old\r\nTestament may also be allowed, but only to learned and pious men,\r\nat the discretion of the bishop; provided they use them merely as\r\nelucidations of the Vulgate version, as a means of understanding the\r\nHoly Scriptures, and not in place of the sacred text itself. But\r\ntranslations of the New Testament made by authors of the first class\r\nof this Index are allowed to no one, since little advantage, but much\r\ndanger, generally arises from reading them. If notes accompany the\r\nversions which are allowed to be read, or are joined to the Vulgate\r\nedition, they may be permitted to be read by the same persons as\r\nthe versions, after the suspected places have been expunged by the\r\ntheological faculty of some Catholic university, or by the general\r\ninquisitor. On the same conditions, also, pious and learned men may be\r\npermitted to have what is called the Bible of Vatablus, or any part of\r\nit. But the preface and _Prolegomena_ of the Bible published by\r\nIsodorus Clarius are, however, excepted; and the text of his editions\r\nis not to be considered as the text of the Vulgate edition.\r\n\r\nIV. Inasmuch as it is manifest from experience that if the Holy Bible,\r\ntranslated into the vulgar tongue, be indiscriminately allowed to\r\nevery one, the temerity of men will cause more evil than good to arise\r\nfrom it, this matter is referred to the judgment of the bishops, or\r\ninquisitors, who may, by the advice of the priest, or confessor, permit\r\nthe reading of the Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue by Catholic\r\nauthors, to those persons whose faith and piety, they apprehend, will\r\nbe augmented, and not injured, by it; and this permission they must\r\nhave in writing. But if any one shall have the presumption to read or\r\npossess it without permission, he shall not receive absolution until\r\nhe have first delivered up such Bible to the ordinary. Booksellers,\r\nhowever, who shall sell or otherwise dispose of Bibles in the vulgar\r\ntongue to any person not having such permission, shall forfeit the\r\nvalue of the books, to be applied by the bishop to some pious use; and\r\nbe subjected to such other penalties as the bishop shall judge proper,\r\naccording to the quality of the offence. But regulars shall neither\r\nread nor purchase such Bibles without a special license from their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nV. Books of which heretics are the editors, but which contain little or\r\nnothing of their own, being mere compilations from others, as lexicons,\r\nconcordances, apophthegms, similies, Indexes, and others of a similar\r\nkind, may be allowed by the bishops and inquisitors, after there have\r\nbeen made, with the advice of Catholic divines, such corrections and\r\nemendations as may be deemed requisite.\r\n\r\nVI. Books of controversy betwixt the Catholics and heretics of\r\nthe present time, written in the vulgar tongue, are not to be\r\nindiscriminately allowed, but are to be subject to the same regulations\r\nas Bibles in the vulgar tongue. As to those works in the vulgar\r\ntongue which treat of morality, contemplation, confession, and similar\r\nsubjects, and which contain nothing contrary to sound doctrine, there\r\nis no reason why they should be prohibited; the same may be said also\r\nof sermons in the vulgar tongue, designed for the people. And if in\r\nany kingdom or province, any books have been hitherto prohibited as\r\ncontaining things not proper to be read without selection by all sorts\r\nof persons, they may after correction, if written by Catholic authors,\r\nbe allowed by the bishop and inquisitor.\r\n\r\nVII. Books professedly treating of lascivious or obscene subjects,\r\nor narrating or teaching these, are utterly prohibited, since not\r\nonly faith but morals, which are readily corrupted by the perusal\r\nof them, are to be considered; and those who possess them shall be\r\nseverely punished by the bishop. But the works of antiquity, written\r\nby the heathen, are permitted to be read, because of the elegance and\r\npropriety of the language; though on no account shall they be suffered\r\nto be read by young persons.\r\n\r\nVIII. Books, the principal subject of which is good, but in which some\r\nthings are occasionally introduced tending to heresy and impiety,\r\ndivination, or superstition, may be allowed, after they have been\r\ncorrected by Catholic divines, under the authority of the general\r\nInquisition. The same judgment is also given concerning prefaces,\r\nsummaries, or notes, taken from condemned authors, and inserted in the\r\nworks of authors not condemned; but such works must not be printed in\r\nfuture, until they have been amended.\r\n\r\nIX. All books and writings of geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy,\r\npyromancy, onomancy, cheiromancy, and necromancy; or which treat of\r\nsorceries, poisons, auguries, auspices, or magical incantations are\r\nutterly rejected. The bishops shall also diligently guard against any\r\npersons reading or keeping any books, treatises, or indexes which\r\ntreat of judicial astrology or contain presumptuous predictions of\r\nthe events of future contingencies, and fortuitous occurrences, or of\r\nthose actions which depend upon the will of man. But such opinions and\r\nobservations of natural things as are written in aid of navigation,\r\nagriculture, and medicine are permitted.\r\n\r\nX. In the printing of books or other writings, the rules shall be\r\nobserved which were ordained in the tenth session of the Council of\r\nLateran, under Leo X. Therefore, if any book is to be printed in the\r\ncity of Rome, it shall first be examined by the vicar of the pope or\r\nby the master of the sacred palace or by other persons chosen by our\r\nmost holy Father for that purpose. In places other than Rome, the\r\nexamination of any book or manuscript intended to be printed shall be\r\nreferred to the bishop with whom shall be associated the inquisitor of\r\nheretical pravity of the city or diocese in which the printing is done,\r\nand these officials shall without charge, and without delay, affix\r\ntheir approbation to the work, in their own handwriting, such approval\r\nbeing subject, however, to the pains and censures contained in the said\r\ndecree; there is the further condition, that an authentic copy of the\r\nbook to be printed, signed by the author himself, shall remain in the\r\nhands of the examiner; and it is the judgment of the Fathers of the\r\npresent deputation that those persons who publish works in manuscript\r\nbefore these have been examined and approved, should be subject to the\r\nsame penalties as those who print them; and that those who read or\r\npossess such books should be considered as the authors, if the real\r\nauthors of such writings do not avow themselves. The approbation given\r\nin writing shall be placed at the head of the books, whether printed\r\nor in manuscript, that they may appear to be duly authorised; and this\r\nexamination and approbation, etc., shall be granted gratuitously.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in every city and diocese, the houses or places in which the\r\nwork of printing is carried on, and also the shops of booksellers,\r\nshall be frequently visited by persons deputed for that purpose by\r\nthe bishop or his vicar, conjointly with the inquisitor of heretical\r\npravity, so that nothing that is prohibited may be printed, kept, or\r\nsold. Booksellers of every description shall keep in their libraries a\r\ncatalogue, signed by the said deputies, of the books which they have\r\non sale, nor shall they keep, or sell, nor in any way dispose of,\r\nany other books, without permission from the deputies, under pain of\r\nforfeiting the books, and of liability to such other penalties as shall\r\nbe judged proper by the bishop or inquisitor, who shall also punish\r\nthe buyers, readers, or printers of such works. If any persons import\r\nforeign books into any city, they shall be obliged to announce them\r\nto the deputies; or if this kind of merchandise be exposed to sale in\r\nany public place, the public officers of the place shall signify to\r\nthe said deputies that such books have been brought; and no one shall\r\npresume to read, or lend, or sell any book which he or any other person\r\nhas brought into the city, until he has shown it to the deputies,\r\nand obtained their permission, unless it be a work well known to be\r\nuniversally allowed.\r\n\r\nHeirs and testamentary executors shall make no use of the books of\r\nthe deceased, nor in any way transfer them to others, until they have\r\npresented a catalogue of them to the deputies, and have obtained their\r\nlicense, under pain of confiscation of the books, or the infliction of\r\nsuch other punishment as the bishop or inquisitor shall deem proper,\r\naccording to the contumacy or quality of the delinquent.\r\n\r\nWith regard to those books which the Fathers of the present deputation\r\nshall examine, or correct, or deliver to be corrected, or permit to\r\nbe reprinted on certain conditions, booksellers and others shall be\r\nbound to observe whatever is ordained respecting them. The bishops and\r\ngeneral inquisitors shall, nevertheless, be at liberty, according to\r\nthe authority they possess, to prohibit also such books as may appear\r\nto be permitted by these rules, if they deem such prohibition necessary\r\nfor the good of the kingdom or province or diocese; and the secretary\r\nof these Fathers, shall, according to the command of our holy Father,\r\ntransmit to the notary of the general inquisitor the names of the books\r\nthat have been corrected, as well as of the persons to whom the Fathers\r\nhave granted the power of examination.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is enjoined on all the faithful that no one presume to keep\r\nor read any books contrary to these Rules, or prohibited by this Index.\r\nBut if any one read or keep any books composed by heretics, or the\r\nwritings of any author suspected of excommunication, and those who read\r\nor keep works interdicted on another account, in addition to the burden\r\nof mortal sin, shall, at the discretion of the bishops, be severely\r\npunished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn advance of the Rules are printed the Bull of the Pope, dated Rome,\r\nMarch 24, 1564, and a preface by Francis Forerius, secretary of the\r\ndeputation or commission which had been charged with the compilation\r\nof the Index. Forerius states that this Index is intended to take the\r\nplace of that prepared at Rome by the inquisitors (that of Paul IV)\r\nbecause that had included certain books which did not deserve to be\r\nprohibited, and also because it had not been generally accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Notes on the Ten Rules_\r\n\r\nI. This follows in substance the regulation of Paul IV. Sixtus added:\r\n“To be excepted are certain books which, notwithstanding the errors\r\ncontained in them, the Church has found it desirable to preserve\r\nas records of ecclesiastical traditions and old-time usages, or as\r\nevidence to be used in the specification and condemnation of heretical\r\ndoctrines, as is set forth in the decree of Pope Gelasius I” (492).\r\nGelasius, however, does not prohibit the reading of the condemned\r\nbooks, and in fact no such prohibitions occur before the 16th century.\r\n\r\nII. A somewhat similar distinction between heresiarchs and ordinary\r\nheretics finds place in Louvain, 1546. The definition of heresiarchs\r\nmight, however, have been made a little more precise for the\r\ninformation of the faithful, or a complete list of them might have been\r\ngiven, as was done later by Quiroga (1594) and by Sixtus.\r\n\r\nIII. The later Indexes of Sixtus (1585), Alexander VII (1655), and\r\nBenedict XIV (1756) proscribed, with some slight modifications in the\r\nwording, all editions of the Scriptures edited or printed by heretics.\r\nAlexander added, “the Holy Script or any portions of the same which\r\nhave, since 1515, been printed in metrical form.” Benedict restricts\r\nthis prohibition to metrical versions produced by heretics.\r\n\r\nIV. Paul IV had permitted the reading of the Bible in the vernacular\r\nonly under authorisation of the Inquisition. Sixtus replaced the\r\nmilder regulation of Trent with his rule No. 7. The possession of the\r\nScriptures or of portions of the Scriptures printed in the popular\r\ntongue is prohibited except under special authority of the Curia.\r\nParaphrases in the vernacular are unconditionally condemned. In later\r\nIndexes, the prohibition was extended to cover all “summaries” and\r\nhistorical compends of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. The acceptance\r\nof these prohibitions varied in different lands and in different times.\r\nIn Spain, a Bible had been printed in the dialect of Valentia as early\r\nas 1478. The first issue in the vernacular after that date was that of\r\n1790, edited by San Miguel, later Bishop of Segovia. A second appeared\r\nin 1823, edited by Amat, Bishop of Barcelona.\r\n\r\nThe Lisbon Index of 1624 not only confirmed the prohibition of Bibles\r\nand parts of the Bible, but added a new restriction in forbidding the\r\nuse in works of general literature (printed in the vernacular) of any\r\nextracts from the Scriptures. This order called for the cancellation,\r\nfor instance, in the _Shepherds of Bethlehem_ of Lope de Vega, of\r\nthe poet’s versions of the _Magnificat_, the _Benedictus_, the _Nunc\r\nDimittis_, and the _Miserere_. In Italy, previous to 1560, a number\r\nof translations of the Scriptures had been issued, but after the\r\nprohibitions of Paul IV and of the Index of Trent, we find record of\r\nItalian versions only of the Psalms and a few other portions, and these\r\ncould be read only with a formal permission. In 1596, Clement VIII\r\nauthorised the publication, by the Order of Jesus, of an edition in\r\nthe vernacular of the portions of the Gospels selected for reading on\r\nSundays and Saints’ days. It would appear, however, as if north of the\r\nAlps, this proscription of the Scriptures in the vernacular failed to\r\nsecure any general enforcement, as during the 16th and 17th centuries\r\na large series of editions of the Scriptures and of the New Testament\r\nwere brought into print from Catholic translations, in French, German,\r\nBohemian, Hungarian, and Polish. The Jesuit Serarius, writing in 1612,\r\ncomplains that “any one in Germany can read the Bibles of Eck or\r\nDietenberger, and in place of being reprimanded and punished by their\r\nbishops and confessors, the delinquents are likely to be commended and\r\nhonoured.”\r\n\r\nV. Sixtus orders further that the name of the heretical publisher\r\nof the work must be cancelled and that of the “Expurgator” must be\r\nspecified. Benedict directs that dictionaries, thesauri, and similar\r\nworks compiled by heretics, “like the publications of the Stephani,\r\nScapula, J. J. Hofmann, etc.,” must, before being “permitted,” be\r\nthoroughly “expurgated” of all material which may be antagonistic to\r\nthe Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nVI. Sixtus directs that books written in the vernacular which combat\r\nthe doctrines of the Jews and Mohammedans, shall be read only under\r\nauthorisation of the Inquisition. In Germany, the prohibition against\r\nthe reading of controversial books printed in the vernacular secured\r\nvery little obedience and such books came, during the 16th century,\r\ninto very wide circulation.\r\n\r\nVII. In the Index of Paul, there is recorded under this heading a\r\ngroup of Priapean literature connected (erroneously) with the name of\r\nVirgil. The only other classic author condemned as obscene is Lucian.\r\nIn the Lisbon Index of 1624, it is specified that the Epigrams of\r\nMartial can be permitted only after expurgation, or in the text edited\r\nby the Jesuits Fusius, Radius, and Augerius. Ovid’s erotic poems are\r\npermitted “for private reading,” but for students only the _Epistolae\r\nSelectae_ as edited at Tournay, 1615. Sixtus prohibits also obscene\r\npictures and collections of music containing amatory songs.\r\n\r\nX. In 1625, the Inquisition of Rome issued an order prohibiting any\r\nresident of the States of the Church from printing a book without the\r\npermission, if within the city of Rome, of the cardinal vicar and the\r\n_Magister_ of the palace, or if without the city, of the local\r\nbishop. Alexander VII announced in the Bull of 1664, which accompanied\r\nhis Index, that only those penalties were still in force which were\r\nspecified in this tenth Rule and in the _Bulla Coenae_. Under this\r\ndecision, the excommunication _latae sententiae_ became no longer\r\napplicable to those who might read writings of heretics but still held\r\ngood for the reading of books actually specified in the Index, of\r\nvernacular versions of the Scriptures and controversial works, and of\r\nworks classed as obscene.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement in Germany of the penalties prescribed in Rule X was\r\na matter of dispute among the theologians as had before been the\r\nauthority of the _Bulla Coenae_. In 1869, these penalties were\r\nrescinded by the Bull of Pius IX. In the same Bull, however, Pius\r\nretained the “reserved excommunication” for the printing, reading,\r\netc., of books which had been specifically condemned (by titles), not\r\nby the Inquisition, but by direct apostolic authority (papal Bulls,\r\nbriefs, or encyclicals). This specification would apparently cover the\r\nbooks listed in the two Indexes issued under the direct authority of\r\nPius IX and probably holds good also for the works contained in the\r\ntwo Indexes of Leo XIII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Tridentine Index, presented with the full authority of the Church\r\nrepresented by the Pope (Pius IV) and the general council, and compiled\r\nafter due deliberation, by a representative commission of scholarly\r\ndivines, secured a much wider distribution and more general acceptance\r\nthan had been obtained by the first of the papal Indexes or than could\r\nhave been expected for the comparatively local Indexes of Louvain,\r\nVenice, or Valladolid. The Index was printed in 1564, either separately\r\nor in connection with the record of the Decrees of the Council of\r\nTrent, in Bologna, Modena, Florence, Cremona, Venice, Cologne, and\r\nDillingen, and during the remaining years of the century, in a great\r\nnumber of editions. Within the next thirty years, there were no less\r\nthan ten issues from the presses of Venice (which was still one of the\r\nmost important centres of the printing industry) and four from Cologne.\r\nThroughout the Catholic world, the interest was active and continued\r\nin the proceedings and conclusions of the council which had undertaken\r\nthe task of cleansing the Church from its inner evils and of fortifying\r\nits institutions against the assaults of the heretics without. The\r\ndeliberate policy of the Church in regard to the supervision of books\r\nwas expressed in the Ten Rules of its Index and in the accompanying\r\nlists of prohibited books and of condemned authors, and these rules and\r\nlists now came to the eyes of thousands of readers (or were cited to\r\nthem by their teachers and confessors) who had never before known of\r\necclesiastical censorship. According to the understanding of the Curia,\r\nno formal acceptance or confirmation was required to make binding in\r\nthe lands acknowledging the authority of the Church either the Bull or\r\nthe Index, but this was not the view generally taken.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, Bavaria, and Portugal, the regulations of the Index were\r\nformally adopted under royal edicts. Spain adhered to the policy of\r\nleaving in the hands of the Spanish Inquisition the responsibility for\r\nthe preparation, and for the enforcement of, the successive Indexes,\r\nand neither the Index of Trent nor any other issued under papal\r\nauthority was ever accepted as binding within the Spanish dominions.\r\nThe Ten Tridentine Rules were however adopted in the Spanish Indexes\r\nappearing after 1564. In France and in Germany (outside of Bavaria)\r\nthe Index of Trent was confirmed and promulgated only by one or two\r\nprovincial synods. It is evident that in these countries the Rules\r\nsecured no general acceptance or authority. Reusch adduces as evidence\r\nthat the Roman authorities held the Tridentine Index to be universal in\r\nits authority, certain instructions given in 1580 by Gregory XIII to\r\nToletus. Toletus, who had been sent to Germany and the Low Countries as\r\na papal representative, was empowered to absolve from excommunication\r\nand from other ecclesiastical penalties, believers who had for\r\nscholarly purposes retained or read books condemned as heretical,\r\nprovided they would promise to abandon the pernicious practice.\r\n\r\nThe decrees in regard to book-production issued during the succeeding\r\ntwenty years by the provincial synods of Italy repeated in substance\r\nthe regulations of Trent, with an occasional addition. In Milan for\r\ninstance, in 1583, the synod ordered that printers and booksellers\r\nmust, before securing permission to begin business, make a confession\r\nof faith to the bishops and take an oath to conduct their business\r\naccording to the regulations of the Index.\r\n\r\nIn a number of the dioceses of France, similar edicts were issued,\r\nbut these made no reference to the papal Indexes. In 1566, King\r\nHenry II ordered (at the instance of the theological faculty of the\r\nSorbonne) that no books prohibited by said faculty should be printed,\r\nowned, or read. Further, he authorised the Sorbonne to make personal\r\nexamination of the stock of the booksellers. The supervision exercised\r\nby the Sorbonne over the production and distribution of books worked\r\nto the detriment of the book-trade of Paris, and to the advantage of\r\nthe printers and dealers of Lyons, Montpellier, and other provincial\r\ncentres, where it proved to be impracticable to enforce the regulations\r\nof the Paris theologians. It was also a factor in building up in\r\nHolland (which was practically free from censorship) the business of\r\nproducing books for the students of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, notwithstanding repeated efforts by successive popes, Pius\r\nV, Gregory XIII, and others, and edicts by Maximilian II and Rudolf\r\nII, it was evidently impracticable to keep control or supervision over\r\nthe productions of the rapidly increasing printing-presses, presses\r\nwhich, instead of being concentrated as at Paris, were distributed\r\nthrough a great number of widely separated towns. A letter written in\r\n1582 by the Bishop of Vienna indicates that the lists in the Roman\r\neditions of the Index were not accepted as final authority. “You can\r\npermit the use of books printed in Munich, Ingolstadt, Cologne, and\r\nother such towns [_i.e._ towns under good ecclesiastical influence]\r\nbut those from Wittenberg, Tübingen, etc., must be forbidden. It\r\nwill be well for the inspectors to take in their hands the catalogue\r\nof the Frankfort Fair in which are given the titles of the Protestant\r\ntheological books. They will also find useful the Index as printed in\r\nCologne and in Venice.”[130] In 1566, Josias Simler writes: “A new\r\nIndex has been promulgated in which so many books are condemned that\r\nmany Italian professors complain they will no longer be able to deliver\r\ntheir lectures. The Frankforters and Zürichers and other German cities\r\nhave written to the authorities of Venice begging them not to accept\r\nthe Index.”[131] Kirchhof speaks of the German book-trade with Italy as\r\nbeing practically destroyed through the enforcement of the regulations\r\nof Trent, while the book-dealers of Italy itself were isolated and in\r\nmany cases ruined.[132]\r\n\r\nThe Dominican Bernardo Castiglione writes, in 1581:\r\n\r\n   “In Rome, there is at present much watchfulness concerning the\r\n   books coming into Italy. The Inquisitors are charged with the\r\n   duty of prohibiting or destroying copies of this work or that.\r\n   As a result, the booksellers dare not give orders, and are often\r\n   unable to sell the books they have received. I understand that\r\n   there are now lying in the Roman shops unsalable books to the\r\n   value of many thousand _scudi_.”[133]\r\n\r\nA noteworthy omission in the catalogue of the Trent Index is the entire\r\nlist of condemned Bibles and Testaments which had constituted an\r\nimportant division in the Index of Paul IV. Mendham calls attention to\r\nthe omission of the name of John della Casa.\r\n\r\nPaul’s editors had placed the name of Erasmus in Class I (authors\r\nall of whose writings were condemned) and had added a specification\r\nwhich is connected with no other name, not even those of Luther and\r\nCalvin: “with all his commentaries, criticisms, scholia, dialogues,\r\nletters, translations, books, and writings, including those which have\r\nnothing to do with the subject of religion.” In the Index commission\r\nof Trent, after sharp discussions, this Draconian judgment was\r\nmaterially modified. The name of Erasmus was placed in Class II, in\r\nconnection with the titles _Colloquia_, _Encomium Moriae_, _Christiani\r\nMatrimonii Institutio_, and the _Paraphrasis in Matteum_ (as printed in\r\nan Italian version under the name of Bernardine Tointano). The other\r\nwritings, including those that had already been condemned in Paris and\r\nin Louvain, were left free. For the _Adagia_, a specific authority\r\nwas given to Paulus Manutius for the publication of an edition. Until\r\nthis edition should be in readiness, permission was given for the\r\nuse of the existing editions (the most noteworthy was that printed\r\nin 1498 by Aldus), after certain reprehensible or doubtful passages\r\nhad been eliminated under the authority of the Inquisition or of a\r\ntheological faculty. In 1590, under the authority of Sixtus V, Erasmus\r\nwas again placed in Class I, and all of his writings “whatever their\r\nsubject-matter,” with the exception of the expurgated _Adagia_, were\r\ncondemned. In 1596, Clement VIII again confirmed for the writings\r\nof Erasmus the classification of Pius IV. In the Spanish Indexes,\r\nthe name of Erasmus was, after 1612, retained in Class I. In 1575,\r\nthe expurgated edition of the _Adagia_ was issued in Rome under the\r\nauthority of the Church, without the name of the author. It would\r\nbe a little difficult to secure from these varying pronouncements\r\na trustworthy impression as to the final conclusions of the Church\r\nauthorities in regard to the seriousness of the heresies contained in\r\nthe writings of this scholarly Catholic or as to the actual value of\r\nthe books.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the Trent Index, it is stated that those writers are\r\nto be placed in Class I who are known as heretics or who are suspected\r\nof heresy (_nota haeresis suspecti_). This phrase is capable of\r\nvarying interpretations and would appear to have been worded in order\r\nto cover the cases of writers like Erasmus, who while refusing to class\r\nthemselves with the Protestants, had written or spoken with sharp\r\ncriticism of the Church. As a result of such an instruction, writers\r\nlike Staupitz, Pirckheimer, Hamer, and Billicanus find place in Class\r\nI. There also were included by Paul, Rhenanus and Zasius, who were by\r\nthe Trent editors transferred to Class II.\r\n\r\nSavonarola had suffered death as a heretic in 1498, but no reference\r\nwas made in the judgment to his writings. These came up for\r\nconsideration in the compilation of Paul’s Index, and were discussed\r\nin several sessions of the Inquisition. They were condemned by\r\nrepresentatives of the Jesuits, the Augustinians, the Carmelites, and\r\nthe Franciscans, and were defended by certain Dominicans. It was the\r\ndesire of Paul to have the whole series condemned, and it is said that\r\nas certain passages were read out loud the Pope stamped on the floor\r\nand exclaimed, “This is pestilential teaching, it is Martin Luther\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided to place in the Index the _Dialogo della verita\r\nprophetica_ and fifteen of the sermons preached in 1496–98, including\r\nthat given at the ordeal of fire. The writings of Savonarola came\r\nagain into discussion at Trent when the commission concluded to permit\r\nthe reading of expurgated editions. In 1598, under the permission\r\nof Clement VIII, an edition of Savonarola’s works was undertaken by\r\nCardinal Bonelli and Philip Neri, but was never completed. As late as\r\n1837, was placed upon the Index (under Pius VIII) an edition of the\r\n_Opere inedite_ di Fra Gir. Savonarola, _Libri cinque dell’ Italia_,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nClemangis, placed by Paul in Class I, is transferred by Trent to\r\nClass II, with the specification that the works can be permitted when\r\nexpurgated. Geiler of Kaisersberg, placed by Paul in Class I, is left\r\nout of the Index of Trent, but is replaced by Sixtus V and Clement VIII\r\nin Class I, where his name still remains.\r\n\r\nThe Trent Index, like that of Paul IV, includes in Class I a number of\r\nItalian authors whose works seem to be of hardly sufficient importance\r\nto give warrant for the distinction. Among the names the grounds for\r\nthe condemnation of which are more easily to be understood may be\r\nnoted that of Petrus Paulus Vergerius. The record of Vergerio has\r\nbeen referred to in connection with the Index of 1559. His thorough\r\nknowledge of the methods followed by the compilers of the Italian\r\nIndexes, his strenuous opposition to the policy of permitting literary\r\nproduction to be controlled by the Inquisition, and his trenchant\r\ncontroversial style, had rendered this convert to Protestantism one\r\nof the most dangerous of the opponents of the Church. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore that his name should have been singled out for\r\nspecial condemnation. The compilers were also sufficiently painstaking\r\nto trace and to include in their lists the titles of certain of\r\nVergerio’s writings which had been printed under a pseudonym or\r\nanonymously.\r\n\r\nIn Class II, may be noted Italian translations of certain writings\r\nof Luther which had been issued under the name of Fregoso (Federigo\r\nFregoso died in 1541, as Archbishop of Salerno.) Class III contains\r\nfurther Italian translations of the treatise of Luther on the _Freedom\r\nof Christian Men_ and of the _Address to the Christian Nobility of\r\nGermany_. In the same class is entered the title _Il Beneficio di\r\nChristo_ (also recorded as _Beneficium Christi_), the authorship of\r\nwhich is ascribed to Dom Benedetto, a Benedictine of Mantua. This tract\r\nwas printed throughout Europe in various versions and secured a very\r\nwide circulation. Vergerio speaks of forty thousand copies being sold\r\nin Venice alone, within six months. The tract appears, however, to have\r\nbeen very thoroughly suppressed, as copies are now scarce.\r\n\r\nAmong the non-theological Italian writers whose names find place in the\r\nlists of Trent (and in other of the earlier Indexes) the following may\r\nbe noted: Dante, Macchiavelli, Boccaccio, and Guicciardini. The name\r\nof Dante is connected with the treatise _De Monarchia_. The ground for\r\nthe condemnation was undoubtedly the same that, two centuries earlier,\r\nhad brought the author under the reprobation of John XXII, namely,\r\nthat Dante had ventured to assert that the authority of the emperor\r\nwas derived from God and not from God’s vicar on earth. The book had,\r\nin 1318, been publicly burned in Lombardy. The name of Dante finds\r\nplace also in the expurgatory Index issued, in 1581, in Lisbon. The\r\n_Commedia_ is prohibited until it has been officially expurgated,\r\nand all copies are ordered to be delivered to the Inquisition for\r\ncorrection. The _De Monarchia_ is referred to by Fox in his _Book of\r\nMartyrs_. He speaks of Dante as “an Italian writer against the Pope.”\r\nThe name of Joan. Foxus and that of Oporinus (the Basel publisher of\r\nthe treatise) are placed in the Trent list. In the same Index, are\r\ncondemned certain passages from the commentary on the _Commedia_ by\r\nLandino, in which it is asserted that heretics are not deserving of\r\ndeath but simply of imprisonment. In a Greek version of the _Commedia_\r\nrecently published in Constantinople by Musurus Pacha, certain passages\r\nare omitted which make uncomplimentary references to Mahomet.\r\n\r\nMacchiavelli has, since Paul IV, been placed in Class I. His writings\r\nare available for the faithful only under special authority of the\r\npope. Certain of the books are said by Brudini (writing in 1752) to\r\nhave found favour with Alexander VI, and with Clement VII. Under\r\nGregory XIII, 1572–85, the production of an expurgated edition of\r\nMacchiavelli’s works was undertaken, but the plan was not carried out,\r\nowing to the refusal of the Congregation to permit the books to be\r\nprinted with the name of the author. Villari speaks of having seen a\r\ncopy of an expurgated edition of the _Storie Fiorentini_, printed in\r\n1551.[134] In 1605, under Clement VIII, a fresh prohibition was made\r\nof an edition at Lausanne of the _Discours sur les moyens de bien\r\ngouverner_.\r\n\r\nThe _Decameron_ of Boccaccio is entered in the Index of Trent with the\r\nphrase: _quamdiu expurgatur ab iis, quibus rem Patres commiserunt, non\r\nprodierunt_. An edition so expurgated was printed in Florence in 1573,\r\nat the instance of Cosimo I. The “expurgations” had to do only with the\r\nreferences to religion or to ecclesiastics. Except in the instances in\r\nwhich the characters involved are monks or priests, the obscenities of\r\nthe original are retained in the expurgated edition.\r\n\r\nCertain of the books of the notorious Aretino of Arezzo had been\r\nincluded in the Index of 1559, and the prohibition is confirmed in the\r\nIndex of Trent. This author is condemned not (as might well have been\r\nexpected) on the ground of the pornographic character of his writings,\r\nbut because of their (alleged) heretical tendencies. Professor Paul\r\nvan Dyke points out that “when the influence of the Council of Trent\r\nwas being felt in reforming the abuses and restoring the discipline\r\nof the Church, Aretino’s freedom in criticising the clergy became\r\noffensive.”[135]\r\n\r\nThe works of Guicciardini which came into condemnation had to do with\r\nthe history of the development of the political authority of the\r\nPapacy, a subject concerning which the Congregation of the Index was\r\nalways on the alert.\r\n\r\nIn the Index of Trent, a number of works on astrology and magic, which\r\nhad found place in the Index of Paul, were omitted.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs before indicated, the classifications of the Tridentine editors\r\nindicated a wider and more tolerant policy than had been followed by\r\nthe compilers of the Index of Paul IV. The change is to be credited in\r\npart to the influence exercised in Trent by the delegates from Germany\r\nand in part to the protests which had been called forth from scholars\r\nin Italy and throughout the world by the severe prohibitions in Paul’s\r\nIndex, prohibitions which, as pointed out, were seriously hampering for\r\nscholarly undertakings.\r\n\r\nAfter the Council of Trent, there was for a series of years a decided\r\nincrease in the efforts of the authorities, political as well as\r\necclesiastical, throughout Catholic realms, to repress the production\r\nand the circulation of heretical and dangerous literature. In the\r\nSpanish Low Countries, the regulations under the administration of Alva\r\nwere especially stringent. In the years 1566–7, in Antwerp alone, four\r\nprinters were banished, one was sentenced to the galleys for a term of\r\nsix years, and one was hanged.\r\n\r\nMendham remarks, in regard to the Council of Trent:\r\n\r\n   “The Roman, beyond any other professedly Christian sect,\r\n   is bound to its peculiar faith and discipline by original\r\n   engagements the most sacred, the most precise, the most\r\n   extended, the most rigorous. And it is there that we are to\r\n   look for its true and distinguishing character. No greater\r\n   mercy of the kind was ever vouchsafed to the Christian world by\r\n   a compassionate Providence than the Council of Trent. However\r\n   cautious the managers of this Council, they were obliged by\r\n   many motives to speak out and declare themselves in canons, in\r\n   decrees, in anathemas, and above all in a Creed, none of which\r\n   can be recalled or concealed. The Indexes which emanated in\r\n   great measure from this Assembly stand forth a specimen and\r\n   illustration of the true character of the religion of Rome....\r\n\r\n   “How can he who accepts the creed and oath of Pius IV, as the\r\n   rule of his faith, or actually professes and swears it, and\r\n   therein solemnly engages to _believe and profess all things\r\n   defined_ more especially by the Council of Trent, from which\r\n   all the subsequent Roman Indexes flow, feel himself at liberty,\r\n   not as to the respect, but as to the degree of respect,\r\n   due to the deliberate and constantly renewed expression of\r\n   judgment on religious subjects by the most sacred of all human\r\n   authorities?”[136]\r\n\r\nIt is the conclusion of Dejob that it was possible for a believer\r\nliving during the sixteenth century under the direct influence of the\r\nVatican to remain a good Christian, even to the point of intolerance,\r\nbut that he could hardly, under the existing conditions, attain to real\r\nscholarship.[137]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe work of the Council of Trent marks in more ways than one a\r\nturning-point in the history of the Church of Rome. During the\r\nhalf-century preceding the date of the council, the Protestant revolt\r\nhad wrested from the control of Rome nearly half of the territory of\r\nEurope, and the authority of the Church had been shaken even in States\r\nstill classed as Catholic. The calling together of the council was the\r\nresult of a realisation on the part of the Papacy and its advisers that\r\nthe Protestant advance could not be stayed by simple reassertions of\r\nthe authority of Rome, or by threats or edicts of excommunication. The\r\nChurch must prove its right to rule, must in fact justify its continued\r\nexistence. The practice of the ecclesiastics must be brought into\r\nconformity with ecclesiastical teachings. The claim that the Pope was\r\nthe Vicar of Christ, the Vice-Regent of the Almighty, could be made\r\ngood only through presenting practical evidence that the work of the\r\nChurch was guided by the divine precepts, and that the workers of the\r\nChurch were really the children of God.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Trent retained in its great Index the prohibition of\r\nthe writings of Erasmus, but the reforms initiated by the council\r\nconstituted a justification of the strictures of the great Hollander,\r\nand in not a few instances these reforms simply carried out his\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\nThe divines of Trent did not hesitate to characterise Luther and his\r\nassociates as the “children of the devil,” but these same divines\r\nplaced on record condemnations hardly less specific than those that had\r\ncome from the preachers of Wittenberg, of the abuses and corruptions\r\nthat had taken possession of the Church of Christ.\r\n\r\nIf the work of the reformers of Trent could by any possibility have\r\nbeen brought about fifty years earlier, we may imagine that the theses\r\nof Luther might never have been posted, while the leaders of the\r\nProtestant reform would have had available for their great contest no\r\nadequate ammunition. It may at once, however, be admitted that the “ifs\r\nof history” are at best but futile guesses. It is safer to conclude\r\nthat without such shaking up as was given by the Protestant revolt,\r\nthe reformation within the Church would never have been undertaken, or\r\nwould at least not have taken shape during the sixteenth century. It is\r\npossible even that the loss of half of its realm was necessary if the\r\nexistence of the Church as an institution was to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe history of the succeeding century makes clear that the Catholic\r\nreformation was undertaken in good faith, and with a full measure of\r\ndevotion and earnestness, and that it brought about a great revival in\r\nChristian spirit and a noteworthy advance in scholarship, in wisdom and\r\nadministration, and in faithful service on the part of the rulers, and\r\nof zeal, faith, and good works among their flocks.\r\n\r\nThe popes who initiated the work of the Council of Trent and those\r\nwhose rule followed immediately the years of the council, showed a\r\nvery different standard of life and of official and personal action\r\nthan had characterised such popes as Julius II and Leo X, who had been\r\nresponsible for Church policy at the time of the Reformation. Paul\r\nIV, Pius IV, Pius V, Gregory XIII, and Sixtus V led austere lives\r\nand insisted that their courtiers should accept the same standard of\r\nlife. They were all earnest workers for the reform of the Church,\r\nrealising that its domination could be justified only by its purity,\r\nits severity towards the rebellious, and its charity for the faithful.\r\nThe successful results of the work of the council had brought to\r\nCatholicism confidence in itself; when the adherents of the Church\r\nrealised that the council had escaped the various perils that had been\r\nprophesied, and that without any limitation to the ideal of domination,\r\nwithout any abandonment of essentials to the demands of heretics,\r\nthe Church had made an emphatic condemnation of crying abuses, they\r\nwere able, with lessened anxieties and with large hopes for the\r\nfuture, to look forward to the accomplishment of the promises made\r\nto Christianity. The popes now commence seriously with the reform of\r\nabuses in the Church, not only among its members, but with its rulers.\r\nNepotism is prohibited; the cardinals are brought back to a modest and\r\nconsistent way of living; the bishops are sent back to their dioceses;\r\nthe monks return to their convents. A beginning is made in good faith\r\nwith the correction of ecclesiastical manners and methods.\r\n\r\nAs one result of the reforms, Rome itself was awakened and, so to\r\nspeak, rehabilitated. The court of the popes, which, from the time of\r\nPetrarch to that of Luther, had been denounced by so many eloquent\r\nvoices as the home of scandals and as the source of corruptions, had\r\nthrown off its pernicious habits of life. Virtue and science were\r\nonce again held in honour, and Christian scholarship was placed in a\r\nposition to maintain, without too serious an inferiority, a continuity\r\nwith the profane erudition of the Renaissance. From this time, the\r\nCatholics found themselves less embarrassed when confronted with the\r\nnames of their old-time critics, Erasmus and Melanchthon, and were no\r\nlonger under the necessity of blushing for the intellectual and moral\r\ncondition of their religious capital.[138]\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the general testimony of historians of literature\r\nthat, in spite of certain noteworthy exceptions, the reforms initiated\r\nafter the Council of Trent exercised a largely wholesome effect on the\r\ncharacter of Italian literature. The Italian historian Canello[139]\r\ncontends that the work of the ecclesiastical reformers not only\r\nrestored and preserved the Church, but purified and rehabilitated\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIt is the contention of Dejob that by the close of the 16th century\r\nthe Catholic reformation had exerted in Italian literature an\r\ninfluence that was both significant and lasting, while the effect on\r\nthe literature of Spain was hardly less marked although probably less\r\nlasting. The Protestant peoples had, as he claims, thus far produced,\r\nunder the inspiration of religious feeling, no works that could equal\r\nthe religious productions of these two countries. It was during\r\nthe century following that the literature of France received from\r\nChristianity its most profound impression.[140]\r\n\r\nThe correspondence of Cardinal Sirleto gives an indication of the\r\nlabour undertaken by the clergy of Italy after the Council of Trent\r\nfor the purpose of disputing with the Protestants the leadership in\r\nscience and in scholarship. Sirleto, who had had a chair of rhetoric\r\nin the College of San Silvestro at Rome, was, in 1549, placed in\r\ncharge of the great library of the Vatican. Later, he became Bishop\r\nand Cardinal, but resigned the honours of the Episcopacy in order\r\nto devote himself exclusively to the pursuit of learning and to\r\nthe service of other scholars of the Church. The group of Catholic\r\nwriters who were, during the lifetime of Sirleto, devoting themselves\r\nto scholarly labours included such names as those of Baronius,\r\nBellarmin, Tiraboschi, Latini, Orsini, and many others. Sirleto, with\r\na marvellously intimate knowledge of the great collections of the\r\nVatican that were under his control, devoted himself during a series\r\nof years through correspondence, through suggestions, and through the\r\nloan of manuscripts and books, to furthering the work of the writers\r\nof this group. It would appear as if no Italian writer of the day who\r\nwas giving attention to dogma, to history, to tradition, to exegesis,\r\nor even to general literature, was able to complete his work without\r\nthe co-operation of Sirleto. He typified in his own person the great\r\nrevival in scholarly and in literary interests that accompanied the\r\nreform in morals and in religious zeal brought about by the Council of\r\nTrent. The Protestant writers were no longer to be permitted to have a\r\nmonopoly of applied scholarship or in literary exposition for popular\r\nreading. Men like Baronius devoted themselves in defence of the Church\r\nto the proofs to be secured from history and tradition; while hundreds\r\nof writers who had secured their training in the newly established\r\nor newly revised schools of the Church, brought into print, for the\r\nreading of the people generally, appeals and arguments with which\r\nto offset the influence of the “flyleaves” of Wittenberg. It was in\r\nfact through the furious attacks of Luther and his associates that a\r\ncomprehensive reformation was brought about in the army of Catholicism.\r\n\r\nAmong the correspondents of Sirleto who write soliciting permission for\r\nthe reading of prohibited books (a permission required in connection\r\nwith their work) may be noted Montanus, the editor of the Polyglot\r\nBible, Sigone, and Baronius. Sigone writes, for instance, in 1579:\r\n“Every one knows that I can do nothing to bring to completion my\r\npresent task without an opportunity of reading the ‘Centuries’ of\r\nMagdeburg; but the ‘Centuries’ are under excommunication, and I do not\r\nknow how I am going to be able to obtain a copy or to secure permission\r\nto read the book. I hope very much that you may be interested in\r\nserving me in this matter.”\r\n\r\nPlantin writes to Sirleto stating that he has in plan an edition of\r\nSt. Augustine and asks the librarian to advise him of any variants in\r\nthe text of this Father, of which he has knowledge. He puts a similar\r\nquestion concerning the possible requirement for corrections in texts\r\nof the Scriptures, which corrections he could utilise in the Bible that\r\nwas being edited by Montanus. Later, he asks for aid from Sirleto in\r\nconnection with editions of St. Chrysostom and of St. Jerome which are\r\nto be dedicated to the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard Bartolomeo de Valverde, chaplain of Philip the Second,\r\nwho had rendered important collaboration in certain of the scientific\r\nundertakings of the Vatican, writes in 1584 to Sirleto requesting the\r\nrenewal of the permission that had been accorded to him some time back\r\nfor the use of prohibited books. He alleges as one justification for\r\nhis request certain significant considerations concerning the character\r\nof the examiners with whom rests the fate of books brought into\r\nquestion. Bartolomeo understands that\r\n\r\n   “among the men who are engaged in the production of the new\r\n   Index, there are some whose judgment is so severe and whose zeal\r\n   is so excessive that they have condemned books which they have\r\n   never seen. The people whose judgment should count concerning\r\n   books are of course those who through study have knowledge of\r\n   their character. These compilers have not hesitated to condemn\r\n   the works of many saints and (a loss much to be lamented) all\r\n   the commentaries of the Jews.... The Pope has appointed as\r\n   examiners men who do not know a word of Greek or Hebrew and who\r\n   possess neither judgment or capacity. They are expected to read\r\n   (without any payment for their time) a great mass of volumes and\r\n   in order to get through easily with the repugnant task, they\r\n   declare quite simply and with an air of large knowledge that the\r\n   whole series must be suppressed.”\r\n\r\n   Valverde prays Sirleto to help him to preserve his own\r\n   library against the assaults of this “arbitrary and ignorant\r\n   omnipotence.”[141]\r\n\r\nIt is to be borne in mind, says Dejob, that this letter comes not from\r\na Protestant, denouncing the unintelligent tyranny of the Papists, but\r\nfrom a dignitary of the Spanish Church, who had been charged by the\r\nVatican with special responsibilities; while the Cardinal to whom his\r\napplication was addressed was himself the chief director of the work\r\nof the Congregation of the Index. It is the conclusion of Valverde\r\nthat, as a necessary result of the existing conditions, the work of\r\ncensorship must, in large part at least, be placed in the hands of men\r\nwho are ignorant of the subjects confided to them. These men, charged\r\nby the Pope with an enormous responsibility and with an authority for\r\nwhich there is no supervision, are expected to do this work without\r\npay, and they may be said to give to the Church the equivalent of their\r\ncompensation.[142]\r\n\r\nThe nephew of the Cardinal, Marcello, who was his successor in\r\nthe Diocese of Squillace, was apparently in favour of a strenuous\r\napplication of censorship.\r\n\r\nMarcello, writing to the Cardinal under date of November 2, 1570, says:\r\n\r\n   “It seems to me essential that in affairs like this, having to\r\n   do with heresy, one should proceed with full rigour rather than\r\n   with too close attention to equity, for these matters concern\r\n   the honour of God and that of the whole Catholic Church. As a\r\n   Father of the Church has said, ‘_in hac re summa pietas esset,\r\n   fuisse crudelem_.’ It is the perfection of piety to be ‘cruel’;\r\n   that is to say, to be forcible in punishment.”\r\n\r\nThe examiners of the Congregation of the Index and those delegated\r\nto consider the special subjects referred to the inquisitors found\r\nthemselves swamped by the mass of material submitted for their\r\nconsideration. The task of examining and of reporting upon the\r\nliterature of Europe, or even upon that portion of literature with\r\nwhich the interests of the Church were directly concerned, was beyond\r\nthe powers of the men to whom it had been delegated. The authors whose\r\nworks were under consideration found themselves obliged to retain a\r\nsolicitor or a representative to watch over their interests and to do\r\nwhat might prove practicable to hasten a favourable decision. Abbe\r\nAlessandro Archirota writes to Sirleto, under date of February 23,\r\n1572, complaining that a treatise of his which had been passed upon\r\nwith approval by Pirrotano, has rested in the hands of the Master of\r\nthe Palace for no less than fifteen months. The unfortunate author had\r\nbeen obliged under the terms of his contract to make payment to his\r\nprinter some months back, but was still unable to secure the necessary\r\npermission for the production of his edition. Through the intervention\r\nof Sirleto, the first sheets of the work were secured from the Master\r\nof the Palace and the printing of these sheets was permitted to\r\nproceed.[143]\r\n\r\nA year later, another archbishop advises Sirleto that he has been\r\nwaiting for a year or more for the permission which had been promised\r\nby the Pope for the publication of a work that had already been\r\nexamined three times, the last time by Sirleto himself, and passed upon\r\nwith approval. He had contracts in train for the publication of the\r\nbook in Venice as well as in Rome.[144]\r\n\r\nThe authors found it necessary to guard themselves not only against the\r\nelimination from their text of sentences, paragraphs, or chapters which\r\nwere required for a complete and consistent narrative, but against\r\nthe risk of the interpolation of text of which they had themselves no\r\nknowledge and which might, in its purport, be entirely contrary to\r\nthe purpose and spirit of the work. In May, 1575, Thomasso Thomai,\r\nwriting from Ravenna, complains that his history of Ravenna, which had\r\nsecured the approval of the bishop and of the local inquisitor, had,\r\nbefore being brought into print, been marred by the interpolation of\r\ncertain paragraphs which were entirely contrary to the spirit and to\r\nthe character of the book. Fra Marco, Inquisitor of Venice, reported,\r\nin response to an inquiry made by Sirleto, that the Roman inquisitor,\r\na person both learned and zealous, had found certain passages in the\r\nbook which appeared to him to be undesirable and had undertaken, in\r\nplace of eliminating these, to write further paragraphs correcting and\r\nexplaining them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                CENSORSHIP REGULATIONS, 1550–1591[145]\r\n\r\n    1. Papal regulations concerning books, 1550–1591.\r\n    2. Censorship regulations in Bavaria, 1561–1582.\r\n    3. Censorship under Pius V and Gregory XIII, 1570–1585.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Papal Regulations Concerning Books, 1550–1587.=--According to\r\nthe _Bulla Coenae_, all persons who, without permission of the pope,\r\nread or possess copies of condemned books come under the penalty of\r\nexcommunication, without the requirement of any specific action of\r\nthe authorities. On this ground, the popes reserved to themselves the\r\nexclusive right to grant dispensation for the reading of such books,\r\nbut this claim of the Curia was not always respected. Permits for the\r\nexamination of books classed as heretical were given at different\r\ntimes by Charles V, Francis I, the Bishop of London, and others. Leo\r\nX himself empowered Cardinal Wolsey to grant such permits, according\r\nto his own judgment, to scholars engaged in preparing refutations of\r\nthe Lutheran heresies. Caraffa complained that, in Venice, copies of\r\ncertain condemned books were freely circulated and widely read.[146]\r\nThe Dominican Carranza, later Archbishop of Toledo, secured in 1539\r\nfrom Paul III, as a result of some clever disputations held in Rome, a\r\ndispensation for the reading of heretical books.\r\n\r\n_1550, April._ _A Bull of Julius III_ revokes all dispensations at\r\nthat time outstanding for the use of heretical books, on the ground\r\nthat the privilege had been abused and had worked evil.[147] Bulls of\r\nsimilar purport were issued by Paul IV in 1558, in connection with the\r\npublication of his Index; by Pius IV in 1564 in connection with the\r\nIndex of Trent; by Paul V in 1612; by Gregory XV in 1623; by Urban VIII\r\nin 1627.[148]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that with these difficulties placed in their\r\nway, the scholars of the Church found themselves not infrequently at\r\na serious disadvantage in carrying on their controversies with its\r\nheretical opponents. As an example of a number of similar utterances\r\nmay be cited the complaint of Girolamo Muzio, who had been actively\r\nengaged in suppressing heresy in Northern Italy. He writes in November,\r\n1550, to the commissary-general of the Inquisition that his work was\r\nseriously hampered for want of the privilege of examining the texts of\r\nthe heresies he was refuting. In March, 1551, the dispensation, for\r\nwhich he had made various applications, was finally granted.\r\n\r\n_1551, June._ _A Brief of Julius III_ grants permission to the\r\ncardinals named as presidents of the Council of Trent to read the works\r\ncondemned as heretical, and through personal converse with Protestants,\r\nto secure the fullest possible acquaintance with the grounds of their\r\nheresies.\r\n\r\n_1561, March._ _A Brief of Pius IV_ gives to the legates at Trent a\r\ndispensation identical with that given by Julius III.[149] The letter\r\nto the individual legate specifies that the permission to examine\r\nheretical literature is granted on the ground of the Pope’s confidence\r\nin the strength of his piety and faith and in the trustworthiness\r\nof his scholarship. Similar dispensations were given to the Spanish\r\ndelegates at Trent by the King of Spain.\r\n\r\n_In 1568_, _Pius V_ sends Cardinal Comendon, with two bishops, to\r\nGermany to oppose the spread of Lutheran doctrines. They were charged\r\nto purify the German dioceses from heretical books, “which are\r\nperpetual instructors and solicit without intermission.” They were\r\ninstructed further to engage learned men to write against the heretics\r\nand to print these orthodox and devout arguments in small books, which\r\nbeing sold at a low price or distributed without charge, should come\r\ninto the hands of all. Pius promised to provide the funds required for\r\nthis “missionary” publishing. This method of influencing the public\r\nhad evidently been suggested by the enormous success of the Protestant\r\npresses of Wittenberg.\r\n\r\n_1587._ _Sixtus V_ issues a Bull for the regulation of libraries in\r\nwhich is restated the penalty of the excommunication _latae sententiae_.\r\n\r\n_1591._ _Clement VIII_ (in the _Instructio_ of his Index) authorises\r\nthe bishop to grant such dispensations to trustworthy and faithful\r\nscholars, but for no periods exceeding three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Censorship Regulations in Bavaria, 1561–1582.\r\n\r\n_1561._ _Duke Albrecht V_ appoints the first commission of censorship,\r\nputting at its head two Jesuits, Peltanus and Canisius.\r\n\r\n_1562._ _Duke Albrecht_ orders the destruction of all pernicious and\r\nmisleading books and pamphlets. The commission is directed to take the\r\nresponsibility of determining which these are.\r\n\r\n_1565._ _Duke Albrecht_ issues a general edict directing the\r\nprohibition of all heretical writings, and forbidding the sale of\r\ntheological works in any but Catholic towns.[150]\r\n\r\n_1566._ _The Ducal Commission of Censorship_ issues an _Index\r\nlibrorum prohibitorum_, and also a general catalogue of books which\r\nit is permitted to sell and to read within the duchy. The catalogue\r\nis printed in Munich by Adam Berg. The lists are restricted almost\r\nentirely to books on religion or theology. It is possibly the first\r\nattempt to guide, by official selection and injunction, the religious\r\nreading of a people.[151]\r\n\r\n_1569._ _Duke Albrecht_ orders printed by Adam Berg, for the use of\r\nthe monasteries of Bavaria, a special edition of the Index of Trent,\r\nto which is appended a list, compiled by his commission, of the books\r\nwhich are commended for use in the monastery libraries,--_Index\r\nselectissimum auctorum ex quibus integra bibliotheca constitui recte\r\npotest_. The volume contains a brief, written by Chancellor Eck, in\r\nwhich the heads of the monasteries are cautioned to purge and to\r\nreshape their collections according to the instructions given by the\r\nTridentine Fathers. It is to be noted, however, that the list of works\r\nrecommended include a number of titles which these same Fathers had\r\ncondemned and prohibited. Certain further authors approved by the\r\nBavarian censors find place in either Class I or Class II of the later\r\nRoman Indexes. In the same year, 1569, Berg prints, under authority of\r\nthe Duke, an ordinance prescribing the texts that are to be used in\r\nthe “Latin Schools” of the duchy, and presenting a list of Latin texts\r\nthe use of which is prohibited.\r\n\r\nIn 1569, the Duke commits to the Jesuits the task of purging the\r\nducal library from pernicious books. In the same year was instituted\r\na general inspection or investigation of conditions throughout the\r\nduchy (_allgemeine Landesvisitation_), which continued for two\r\nyears. The inspectors were enjoined to give special attention to the\r\nbookshops as well as to libraries, private as well as public, and\r\nto see that all heretical, pernicious, and non-Catholic books were\r\neliminated and the copies destroyed. They were also to take measures\r\nto stop the distribution of heretical and godless pamphlets and tracts\r\n(_flügschriften_).[152]\r\n\r\n_1580._ _Duke William V_ issues an edict directing the immediate\r\ndelivery to the pastors or magistrates of all copies of heretical\r\nbooks. Persons in whose possession are found any copies of proscribed\r\nbooks are to be so thoroughly punished that thousands shall profit by\r\ntheir example. The effects of deceased persons are to be searched for\r\ngodless literature. No reading of prohibited books is permitted even to\r\necclesiastics or magistrates.\r\n\r\n_1582._ _Duke William_ confirms the authority given to the papal\r\nNuncio, Ninguarda, formerly Vicar-General for Germany of the\r\nDominicans, to issue an Index, which was printed at Munich. It contains\r\nthe text and the lists of the Index of Trent, and certain additional\r\ntitles of “heretical, pernicious, or suspicious books.” The greater\r\nnumber of the books had come into print since 1564, but the Bavarian\r\ncompiler had found some three hundred objectionable authors of\r\nearlier date who had escaped the attention of the Indexers of Trent.\r\nThe additions all find place in Class I. They possess some continued\r\nimportance as with hardly an exception they were later included in the\r\nIndex of Sixtus V. These three hundred names of pernicious authors,\r\nall of whose writings are thus placed under condemnation, had been\r\ntaken by Ninguarda from the catalogue of the Frankfort Book-Fair, for\r\nthe years 1568–1581. The greater number were transcribed from the\r\ndivisions headed: _Protestantium Theologorum Scripta de rebus sacris_\r\nand _Der Protestierenden Theologen Teutsche Schriften_, but there\r\nare also citations from the divisions of history, philosophy, and\r\npoetry. In this manner, the lists of the Roman Index have been made to\r\ninclude, mingled in with the well-known names of the great teachers\r\nof Protestant doctrine, the names of unknown authors whose writings\r\nwere of trifling importance and of no theological or controversial\r\nsignificance. They might well have felt complimented at the distinction\r\nof such an association. It was the case also that certain books\r\nannounced in these publishers’ catalogues never came into publication.\r\nTheir “authors” secured none the less the honour of a general\r\ncondemnation, in Class I, not only in the local Index of Munich, but\r\nin the Sistine Index of Rome addressed to the whole Christian world.\r\nThe names are naturally, in the main, German and Swiss, but there are\r\na few French and English, such as de Loquis, Petrus Ramus, Beza, John\r\nParkhurst, Thomas Dranta (under the poets). The Duke gave orders that\r\ncopies of this Index must be placed in all monasteries and with all\r\npriests, confessors, and deacons. The Nuncio gave authority to the\r\nbishops to appoint commissaries charged with the work of carrying out\r\nthe regulations of the Index.[153]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1581, the Jesuit Peter Canisius wrote to Duke William,\r\nreferring with approval to the Index then in preparation, and adds the\r\nrecommendation that a _Censor Librorum_, to be appointed by the\r\nDuke and the bishops, should be sent to Munich, Ingolstadt, Straubing,\r\nBurghausen, and other places where annual fairs were held, to examine\r\nthe books offered for sale, and particularly those imported, and to\r\ninspect all libraries, both public and private. They were to have\r\nauthority to confiscate and to destroy all copies of books condemned or\r\nlikely to prove pernicious.[154] He suggests further the desirability\r\nof an Index published as a serial from year to year. This idea of\r\nCanisius was, some twenty years later, carried out, though not in\r\nBavaria. From 1606 to about 1619 was published in Mayence a yearly\r\nlist, prepared for the use of booksellers in Catholic States, and\r\npresenting titles selected from the annual catalogue of the Frankfort\r\nFair. The title was: _Index novus librorum imprimis Catholicorum\r\ntheologorum aliorumque celebrium auctorum quarumcunque facultatum et\r\nlinguarum, causas religionis tamen non tractantium ... pro Italia\r\nceterisque nationibus confectus_. The first issue includes a preface\r\nfrom Leuchtius, _Sedis Apost. librorum revisor_, an authorisation\r\nfrom Paul V, and a privilege from the emperor. The Index is devoted to\r\nthe titles of books the reading of which is permitted.[155]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Censorship under Pius V and Gregory XIII, 1570–1585.\r\n\r\n_1570._ _Pius_ gives instructions for the preparation of a new _Index\r\nexpurgatorius_, but the plan was not carried out.\r\n\r\n_1572._ _Gregory XIII_ issues a Bull directing the production of an\r\n_Index expurgatorius_ on the lines of that published in Antwerp. The\r\nwork was, however, delayed so that it was not until 1590, five years\r\nafter Gregory’s death, that this Roman Index appeared.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of both Pius and Gregory, however, attention was\r\ngiven to the production of expurgated editions of the works of a number\r\nof authors, such as Erasmus, Boccaccio, Polydorus, Vergilius, Zasius,\r\nHarphius, etc. Under Pius, condemnation was ordered for the teachings\r\nof Bajus, but this did not bring any new titles into the Index.\r\nIn 1569, Guido Zanetti de Fano was put under arrest for heretical\r\nteaching. The Senate of Venice demanded that the trial should take\r\nplace in Venice. The Pope Pius replied that the civil authorities had\r\nno proper concern with matters of heresy, except to carry out in due\r\ncourse the verdicts or judgments given by the Church.[156]\r\n\r\n_In 1561_, _the Sorbonne_ placed under condemnation the writings of\r\nBishop Jean Monluc of Valence (charged with Calvinistic tendencies)\r\nand resolved, against the protests of the Bishop and the Queen Regent,\r\nto include his name in the Index; but after 1561, no further Index was\r\npublished by the Sorbonne. Monluc was condemned as a heretic by Paul IV\r\nand by Pius V, but his writings do not find place in the Roman Index.\r\nHis sermons were, however, included in the Antwerp and Valdes Indexes\r\nof 1559.\r\n\r\n_In 1561_, a commission appointed by King Philip, under the authority\r\nof Paul IV, took under consideration a series of thirty-one utterances\r\nof Carranza, submitted by his opponents as evidence of his heresies.\r\nThe list was later increased to over one hundred by selections from\r\nhis confiscated papers. The report of the commission, apparently\r\nnot conclusive, was referred to the Council of Trent. Carranza had\r\npublished in Antwerp, in 1558, in a volume dedicated to King Philip,\r\n_Commentaries on the Commandments, the Sacraments, and Faith and Good\r\nWorks_. The book was placed on the Valdes Index of 1559, but did\r\nnot find place in the Roman Index until forty years later.[157] The\r\nauthor, after trial by the Spanish Inquisition, was imprisoned and\r\nharshly treated, although the University of Alcala and a number of the\r\necclesiastics of Spain, including the Archbishop of Granada, declared\r\nthe teachings of Carranza to be orthodox and valuable. The university\r\nwas, as a result of this utterance of the faculty, placed by Valdes\r\nunder excommunication, and subjected to a fine of twenty ducats. It\r\nwas forbidden to exercise any censorship over books except with the\r\napproval of the Inquisition. In 1562, Pius IV, on the recommendation of\r\nthe Council, sent by a special nuncio to King Philip a brief directing\r\nthat the imprisoned Archbishop be delivered to Rome, together with\r\nthe records of his case. Philip declined to acknowledge the Pope’s\r\nauthority in the matter, and refused to permit the publication in\r\nSpain of a brief so injurious to the dignity of his realm. The matter\r\ncontinued to be discussed in the Council at Trent, and was also taken\r\nup by the commission of the Index. The Archbishop of Prague was a\r\nleader among those protesting against the arrogance of Spain in a\r\nmatter which concerned the welfare and the policy of the Church as a\r\nwhole. The treatise of Carranza did not find place in the Trent Index.\r\nIn 1566, Cardinal Ghislieri became Pope as Pius V. He demanded the\r\ndeposition of Valdes as Inquisitor-General and seconded the appointment\r\nof Espinosa as coadjutor with authority to act separately. Camovani,\r\nBishop of Ascoli, was sent to Spain as Nuncio extraordinary with\r\ninstructions not to return without Carranza and the records of the\r\nproceedings. In the brief given to the Nuncio, the Pope complains that\r\nCarranza had now been in prison for seven years, and that specification\r\nof the charges against him had never been sent to the Head of the\r\nChurch. The Pope ordered the Spanish Inquisition, under penalty of the\r\n_excommunicatio latae_, to release Carranza without further delay. The\r\ninquisitors were also directed to deliver the records to the Nuncio,\r\nwithin three months’ time, or to send them in sealed packages to Rome\r\nwithin three months. The penalty for disobedience was excommunication.\r\nCarranza reached Rome in 1567. He was then again given the privilege of\r\nconfession but not of communion. The trial records were never delivered\r\ncomplete. Those that reached Rome in November, 1568, and February,\r\n1570, filled twenty-four folio volumes of 1000 to 1200 pages each. The\r\ninvestigation of the business was assigned by the Pope to a commission\r\nof seventeen. The translation from Spanish into Latin and reading\r\nof the records consumed four years. Pius died in 1572, before the\r\ncommission had completed its work.\r\n\r\nThe Letters of Pius V, edited by F. Goubau, were printed in Antwerp\r\nin 1640, under the title _Apostolicarum Pii Quinti Pont. Max.\r\nEpistolarum Libri Quinque_. They are referred to by Mendham as\r\nimportant in the evidence presented of the strenuous and unremitting\r\nefforts of Pius to incite Charles IX and his mother to the extirpation\r\nof heresy, efforts of which the Massacre of St. Bartholomew may be\r\nconsidered as the chief result.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1576, eighteen years after the original accusation and arrest\r\nof Carranza, the final judgment in his case (based upon the report of\r\nthe commission) was announced by Gregory XIII. Carranza was pronounced\r\nto have laid himself open to the charge of heretical utterances\r\n(_vehementer suspectus de haeresi_). He was ordered to disavow and\r\nrecant all heretical opinions, and particularly those expressed in\r\nsixteen citations from his writings. He was then to be absolved from\r\nfurther censure or condemnation. He was suspended for five years from\r\nauthority in his archbishopric, but was to be paid from its treasury\r\nan annual stipend of one thousand ducats. He was to make his sojourn\r\nin the Dominican monastery of Veyano. Carranza fulfilled the first\r\nobligations of his sentence; but while preparing for his return\r\njourney, he sickened and died, aged seventy-three years. He declared\r\nwith his last utterances that he had never held or taught heretical\r\ndoctrines. He accepted, however, without protest, the judgment of the\r\nPope; and forgave all his enemies. The statements which he was required\r\nto recant specifically included:\r\n\r\n“The Church of the present day does not possess the same measure of\r\nauthority that belonged to the early Church.”\r\n\r\n“In the early Church, the Communion was administered in both forms.”\r\n\r\n“The appointment of the bishop required an election by the clergy and\r\nthe approval of the people.”\r\n\r\n“The election of the pope required the approval of the emperor.”\r\n\r\n“Priests were permitted to marry.”\r\n\r\n“Bishops excommunicated heretics but did not burn them,” etc.\r\n\r\n_In 1566_, _Pius V_ appointed a commission of five cardinals, who\r\nassociated with them twelve scholars, for the preparation of a new\r\nedition of the _Corpus Juris Canonici_. The commission bore the name of\r\n_Congregatio de emendatione decreti Gratiani_, and came to be known as\r\n_Correctores Romani_. The work appeared in 1582, with two briefs (1580,\r\n1582) of Gregory XIII directing that this edition should thereafter be\r\nthe sole authority, and prohibiting the printing of it with notes or\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\n_In 1570_, were printed revised editions of the Book of the Mass\r\nand the Breviary. Pius issued a Bull forbidding, under penalty of\r\nexcommunication, the further printing of liturgies except with special\r\nprivilege. The Bull permitted, however, the reprinting and the use of\r\nliturgies that had been used for not less than two hundred years. Of\r\nthe Breviary of Cologne, which belonged to this class, an edition was\r\nprinted in 1576, with a privilege from Gregory XIII.[158]\r\n\r\n_In 1583_, the famous treatise of Scaliger, _De Emendatione Temporum_,\r\nreceived the honour of a special condemnation from Gregory XIII.\r\nGregory had some years earlier authorised the publication, without\r\nthe name of the author, of an expurgated edition of the _Adagia_ of\r\nErasmus. In 1575, at the instance of the Congregation, Gregory ordered\r\nthat all works by heretical authors which had been authorised for\r\npublication in expurgated editions should be printed without the names\r\nof their authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n             INDEXES OF THE NETHERLANDS, SPAIN, AND ITALY,\r\n                               1569–1588\r\n\r\n\r\n_1._ _1569._ _Antwerp._ Index, issued under the authority of an edict\r\nof the king:\r\n\r\n_Philippi II. Regis Catholici Edictum, de Librorum prohibitorum\r\nCatalogo observando, una cum iis qui mandato Regiae Catholicae\r\nMajestatis, et illustriss. Ducis Albani, consiliiq., Regii decreto,\r\nprohibentur, suo quaeq. loco et ordine repositis._\r\n\r\nThis presents the Tridentine Index with certain titles interpolated,\r\nand with some additional lists.\r\n\r\nThe decree of Philip makes reference to the _Taxae_ of the Church of\r\nRome. The wording is _Praxis et Taxa officinae poenitentiariae Papae_.\r\nMendham speaks of a monograph (of which he possessed a copy reprinted\r\nfrom the Paris edition of 1520) entitled _Taxatio Papalis_, being an\r\naccount of the _Tax-book of the United Church and Court of Modern\r\nRome_, by Emancipatus. He states that Dr. Milner and other Catholic\r\nwriters had asserted that “this vile book had no existence but in the\r\nimagination of heretics”; while Dr. Butler and others had taken the\r\nground that the work was simply a “record of fees of office.”[159]\r\n\r\n_2._ _1570._ _Antwerp._ _Philip II and Duke of Alva._ This is a reprint\r\nof the Index of 1569, with the exception that the Tridentine lists are\r\ngiven without interpolations. The lists following are the same as those\r\nof the previous year. After the edict of the King, printed in French,\r\nFlemish, and Latin, follow the words: _cum Appendice in Belgio ex\r\nmandato Regiae Cathol. Majestatis confecta_. The wording of the edict,\r\nwhich bears date February, 1564, emphasises the claim of the King that\r\nall censorship should emanate from his own authority. The execution of\r\nthe edict is committed to the Duke of Alva and then to the governors of\r\neach province. The most essential provision is that within three months\r\nafter the publication of the statute, all the condemned books should\r\nbe burned, and possession of copies should, therefore, be unlawful.\r\nThe responsibility for the compilation rests with Arius Montanus, the\r\nscholar who had edited the great polyglot Bible, published by Plantin.\r\n\r\nAll books partially condemned or appointed to be expurgated were to\r\nbe brought to the magistrate of the place and corrected according to\r\nthe judgment of the council. The usual penalties are added. The lists\r\ninclude titles in Latin, in French, in Flemish, and in Spanish. This\r\nIndex includes the first index reference to the term _Taxae_, under the\r\nwords _Praxis et Taxa officinae poenitentiariae Papae_. A specification\r\nof the application of the term _Taxa_ will be given later. The term\r\nappears originally to have been used to denote the official fees\r\ncovering the cost of the censorship. Later, there was, however, some\r\nextension of its purport.\r\n\r\nOne detail in this Index of 1570 is the including in it of the lists\r\nof condemned Bibles and Testaments (with some additions) which had\r\nappeared in the Roman Index of 1559 but which had for some reason been\r\nomitted from the Tridentine Index.\r\n\r\nThe lists in this Antwerp appendix to the Trent Index were utilised\r\nwithout change by Quiroga for the Spanish Index of 1571, and also\r\nfor the Index of Sixtus V. It is also stated in the edict that the\r\nselection for condemnation of certain books which had escaped the\r\nattention of the Tridentine compilers or which had been published\r\nsince 1564, had been arrived at through the labours of a commission of\r\nlearned and devout men, including certain bishops, inquisitors, deans,\r\nand doctors, who had been selected by the Duke. Reusch points out,\r\nhowever, that this scholarly commission could not have made a personal\r\nexamination of all the books recorded, as the lists include a number\r\nof titles, copied from the catalogue of the Frankfort Book-Fair, of\r\nbooks which had been announced but not yet printed, and some of which\r\nnever came into print.[160] This Antwerp Index is described as not\r\ndoing credit, in respect to bibliographical or typographical accuracy,\r\nto the editor, Montanus, or to his learned associates. A number of the\r\nauthors in Class I are entered under both surname and forename; the\r\nlists in all classes are characterised by repetitions and a variety of\r\ninaccurate spelling. In this Index appears for the first time in Class\r\nI the name of Stephanus, Robertus (the eldest son of Henry). Several\r\nof his books, such as the _Thesaurus Linguae Graecae_, the edition of\r\nthe Psalms, the _Apology_ for Herodotus, had found place in previous\r\nIndexes. In the Index of Benedict XIV, 1756, the name of Robertus\r\nStephanus is taken out of Class I, and the titles of the several books\r\ncondemned are for the first time correctly printed. Under the heading\r\n_Duytschen Bücher_, are placed one or two English titles, including the\r\n_Psalms of David, in Enghelsche metre_, by Thomas von Sternholde, Lond.\r\n1559.\r\n\r\nThe Commentaries of Scaliger on Theophrastus, published in 1566, appear\r\nin Class II. The schedule of prohibited Bibles and Testaments is in the\r\nmain a repetition of that of Louvain of 1550.\r\n\r\n_3._ _1571._ _Antwerp._ _King Philip II and the Duke of Alva._\r\n\r\n_Index Expurgatorius Librorum qui hoc saeculo prodierunt, vel\r\ndoctrinae non sanae erroribus inspersis, vel inutilis et offensivae\r\nmaladicentiae fellibus permixtis, juxta Sacrae Concilii Tridentini\r\nDecretum, Philippi II. Regis Catholici, Jesu et auctoritate atque\r\nAlbani Ducis concilio ac ministerio in Belgia concinnatus, Anno MDLXXI\r\nAntwerpiae ex officina Christophori Plantini, prototypographi Regii._\r\n\r\nA “diploma” of the King then follows in Flemish. It expresses\r\ndeep concern for the endangered orthodoxy of the King’s subjects\r\nand consideration also for their purses. On this ground, in place\r\nof condemning to the flames all the bad books, it subjects to a\r\nnecessary purgation those which are corrigible. For the assistance\r\nof the prelates authorised to conduct such purgation, an _Index\r\nexpurgatorius_ is provided. The Index was not to be published but\r\nthe bishops were instructed to secure the assistance of selected\r\nbooksellers in the different towns to whom, without the knowledge of\r\nany others, copies of this Index were to be intrusted. They were to\r\ncommunicate it to none but were enjoined themselves to discover in\r\nthe books in their hands the places marked for correction, to expunge\r\nthe condemned passages, or to cancel chapters or pages condemned\r\n_in toto_. After the expunged copies had received the approbation\r\nand the signature of the censor, the books were to be restored to\r\nthe dealers. Copies which had already come into the possession of\r\nindividual owners were to be delivered by them to the censors and\r\nwere to be handed to the booksellers for similar correction. The\r\nintroductory material closes with the following caution: _Cavetur\r\netiam ne quis hunc indicem parte aliqua augeat, vel minuat neve ex\r\nimpressis manuscriptum exprimate, citra gubernatoris et concilii\r\nauctoritatem_. This caution is followed by a selection of the\r\nTridentine Rules and a general statement or explanation on the part of\r\nMontanus, who is the responsible editor.\r\n\r\nA conference was held at Brussels in May, 1570, for the purpose of\r\norganising the work of revising the books to be expurgated. This\r\nconference also gave consideration to certain books ordered for\r\ncorrection by the Council of Trent, the list comprising chiefly\r\neditions of the Fathers printed with “misleading and pernicious notes\r\nand commentaries.” The Index, as finally prepared, was the work of a\r\nboard of editors which was presided over by Bishop Sonnius, and to\r\nwhich Montanus was appointed as royal commissary (representative). The\r\nIndex was printed in July, 1571, with edicts of King Philip and Duke\r\nAlva, and an introduction by Montanus. The cost of the work was borne\r\nby the King. The original edition is very scarce, but reprints have\r\nbeen issued by several of the Protestant publishers of Holland. It was\r\nalso included with the Index of Quiroga, printed at Toledo in 1571.\r\n\r\nThe edict orders, under various penalties for disobedience, the\r\ndelivery for correction of all existing copies of the books specified.\r\nNo further copies of the unexpurgated editions are to be printed,\r\nsold, possessed, or read. New editions can be printed, under careful\r\nsupervision, with the authorised text as expurgated. In each diocese,\r\nthe bishop, or a representative appointed by the bishop, is to be\r\nfurnished with a copy of the Index, and to be charged with the\r\nexecution of its regulations. The copies of the Index must be read\r\nby none but the authorities. The expurgated editions must carry the\r\nnotice of permission or of privilege. On the back of the title-page\r\nof the Index is printed: _Ducis Albae jussu ac decreto cavetur, ne\r\nquis praeter Prototypographum Regium hunc Indicem imprimat, neve ille\r\naut quis alius publice vel private vendat, aut citra ordinariorum\r\nfacultatem, aut permissionem habeat_. The schedule of books to be\r\ncorrected is classified under the terms _deleatur_, _mutetur_,\r\n_corregatur_, _expurgetur_. The reports on the books examined are\r\ngrouped in the Index under the headings: _legi possunt_; _nihil\r\noffendunt_; _nihil quia non legantur habere videntur_; _nullam\r\nreligionis facit mentionem_; _nihil offendiculi habent contra pietatem\r\nvel bonos etiam mores_; _admissum est_; _totus liber rejiciatur ut est\r\nin catalogo_ (Index of 1570); _tollendi sunt, quia correctionem non\r\nadmittunt_; _repurgatione dignum non censuimus_; etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the authors whose texts were largely expurgated under the\r\nspecifications given in this Index and in accordance with rules 2, 5, 8\r\nof the Tridentine, were Gesner, Camerarius, Ramus, and Münster. Certain\r\nothers who had by the Tridentine compilers also been placed in Class I,\r\nwere, with but trifling eliminations, placed in the permitted class,\r\nbut still others were, without any correction at all, freed from the\r\nban.[161]\r\n\r\nThis Antwerp Index found but little acceptance in Rome, although\r\nsome of its material was later utilised by Brasichelli. In Spain, on\r\nthe other hand, it was accepted as authoritative and, as stated, was\r\nmade the basis of the Index issued in 1586, by Quiroga. The Spanish\r\nInquisition, however, extended and enlarged the expurgations, so that\r\nwhile the work of the Antwerp editors is presented in a moderate\r\nsized quarto, the Index of Sotomayor, issued in 1640, requires, for\r\npractically the same list of authors, a portly folio.\r\n\r\nIn this Index was included the _Missa Latina_, with preface\r\nby Illyricus, condemned on the ground of the preface and of what\r\nare described as “offensive additions.” It was reprinted by Francis\r\nJunius in 1586. The editor states in his preface that the expurgatory\r\ncorrectors had not contented themselves with excising certain\r\nstatements that impressed them as erroneous, but had substituted\r\n(as if part of the original text) other phrases, sentences, and\r\neven paragraphs, making a sense entirely different from that of the\r\nauthor.[162]\r\n\r\nMontanus remarks naïvely in his introduction that many of the pious\r\nauthors of the expurgated books, who had died and who in the future\r\nworld had come to know the truth, would, if they could return to earth,\r\nbe very ready to be thankful to their censors. Especially would this be\r\ntrue of those writers whose works as originally issued had been without\r\nblemish, but the later editions of which had called for censorship to\r\neliminate pernicious notes and commentaries. Living authors might in\r\nlike manner have cause for gratitude to the censors, who had through\r\ntheir labours rendered valuable and available books which otherwise it\r\nwould have been necessary to suppress; and, adds Montanus, certain\r\nauthors had written to express their appreciation of the service.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of the work of preparing the expurgated text came\r\nupon the theological faculty of Louvain. In May, 1570, for instance,\r\nthe Louvain divines took up the task of correcting the notes and\r\ncomments of Erasmus on Irenaeus, Jerome, and Augustine. Their report\r\nwas presented in November of the same year. Later in the year, they\r\nwere engaged upon the complete works of Erasmus, a more serious\r\nundertaking. The list of expurgations for Erasmus covers twenty-three\r\npages. Among the divines who took part in this work was Henry Boxhorn\r\nwho afterwards became a Protestant. The writings of Reuchlin and\r\nBertram were confided to the faculty of Douai. The latter gave special\r\ntrouble to the expurgators in connection with his book, _De Corpore\r\net Sanguine Domini_, which called for a full measure of analysis\r\nand elimination. The critique upon this book takes the ground that,\r\n“It was in order,” in judging of the ancient Catholics, “to bear\r\nwith many errors, to extenuate, excuse, and even by some ingenious\r\ndevice to deny” (what the old author has affirmed) “and to fabricate a\r\nconvenient interpretation for any statements which could be objected\r\nto in controversy as unsound.” Reusch speaks of the convenient form in\r\nwhich the expurgated texts were presented by these Antwerp editors, who\r\nin a number of cases printed in full (properly indicated by the type)\r\nthe sentences which were to be cancelled, while the Spanish editions\r\ngive of these sentences only the first and last words. A copy of the\r\nAntwerp Index was submitted in due course by Duke Alva to the Pope,\r\nPius V. Montanus writes from Rome, in November, 1571, that the work\r\nwas not favourably received by the authorities, who inclined to the\r\nopinion that the Antwerp editors had taken undue liberties with the\r\nclassification and conclusions arrived at by the Fathers of Trent.[163]\r\n\r\nIn 1572, Gregory XIII, in instructing the Congregation of the Index to\r\nprepare a new Index, recalled any authorisations previously given to\r\nfaculties or other bodies for the expurgation of books. As a result,\r\nthe Index of Antwerp remains, excepting those prepared in Spain, and\r\nthe single one of the kind issued in Rome, the only expurgatory Index\r\nin the series.\r\n\r\n_4._ _1580._ _Parma._--_Index Librorum Prohibitorum. Apud Erasmum\r\nViotum. Parmae. 1580. Concessu Superiorum._\r\n\r\nThis Index was prepared as a supplement to, or continuation of, the\r\nIndex of Trent, and in accordance with the instructions given in the\r\nTridentine preface to bishops and to local inquisitors. The Indexes of\r\nLiège, 1569, Antwerp, 1570, Lisbon, 1581, and Munich, 1582, were also\r\ncompiled as a result of these instructions of 1564; but this of Parma\r\nis the only Italian example.\r\n\r\nThe lists, which contain 460 names, were undoubtedly utilised by\r\nSixtus V, in the preparation of his Index, as a number of the errors\r\nin the names have been repeated verbatim. The Parma lists are full of\r\nblunders, and the names of the authors and titles of the books are\r\ncuriously mixed together. The compilers have had access to certain\r\nEnglish material and have thought it important, for instance, to\r\ninclude a condemnation of the Bible of Miles Coverdale, of which but\r\nfew copies could have been within reach of readers in Italy. The entry\r\nreads: _Millo Couerdallus pro falsa translatione noui testamenti et\r\nprologis in quaedam loca ejusdem_.\r\n\r\nThe works of some of the Fathers are included, which works it was\r\nprobably intended to condemn in some heretical edition, but the edition\r\nnot being specified, the condemnation covers the teachings of the\r\nFather himself, as in the entry _Tertuliani Opera_.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the alphabetical schedule, is given a list (without\r\nalphabetical arrangement) of twenty-one heretics. The list fails to\r\npresent certain of the assured heresiarchs, such as Luther, Calvin,\r\nand Zwingli, but does include Melanchthon, Erasmus, and the Paris\r\npublishers, Henri and Robert Estienne.\r\n\r\nThis Index of Parma had not been included in any of the earlier records\r\nof censorship in Italy, and had even escaped the attention of the\r\nindefatigable Vergerio. Its existence was unknown to Reusch in 1884,\r\nat the time of the completion of his great history, and it is, as far\r\nas I have been able to ascertain, not mentioned by any of the other\r\nwriters on censorship. A single copy was discovered in 1887 by Ludwig\r\nRosenthal, and, at his instance, a reprint, edited by Reusch, was\r\nissued in Bonn in 1889.\r\n\r\n_5._ _1581._ _Lisbon._ _Inquisitor-General._ In 1568, Cardinal Henry,\r\nat that time Regent, published in Portugal the decree of the Council\r\nof Trent. The Cardinal became King in 1578, and in that year he had\r\npublished a Portuguese version of the Trent Rules, together with\r\na newly compiled list of books prohibited for Portugal. According\r\nto Reusch, no copies of this Portuguese Index are known. In 1581,\r\nPortugal came under the rule of Philip II, and in that year, the\r\nInquisitor-General, Dalmeida, published a reprint of the Index of\r\nTrent, together with a supplementary list of prohibited books. The\r\ntitle reads:\r\n\r\n_Index librorum ... comprobatus. Nunc recens de mandato Illust.\r\nac Rev. D. George Dalmeida, Metrop. Archiep. Olyssipon. totiusque\r\nLusitanicae ditionis Inquis. General. in luce editus. Addito etiam\r\naltero Indice eorum Librorum qui in his Portugaliae Regnis prohibentur,\r\ncum permultis aliis ad eandem Librorum prohibitionem spectantibus, ...\r\nOlyssipone, excudebat Antonio Reberius._\r\n\r\nThe edict of the Inquisition announces the imposition of the penalty\r\nof the _excommunicatio latae sententiae_ for any disobedience of the\r\nregulations. The new lists comprise about 160 titles. A number of these\r\nnew titles became of more than local importance as they were taken over\r\nby Quiroga and also by Sixtus V. The work of the Lisbon compilers was\r\nin part based upon Valdes. Among the new names may be noted: Jerome\r\nCardan, Georgius Venetus, Crinitus and Amatus Lusitanus. Ariosto’s\r\n_Orlando Furioso_, Bocardo’s _Orlando Imamorato_, and Dante’s _Divine\r\nComedy_ are grouped together in Class II. These three titles were,\r\nhowever, not repeated by the compilers of Sixtus. The _Utopia_ of\r\nThomas More and the _Praise of Folly_ of Erasmus are placed together in\r\nClass II. Quiroga, in repeating the _Utopia_, places it with books to\r\nbe permitted if corrected.\r\n\r\n_6._ _1583._ _Madrid._ _Inquisitor-General Quiroga._ In 1583, the\r\nInquisitor-General Quiroga, on the strength of his apostolic authority,\r\norders the preparation of a new catalogue of prohibited books. The\r\nedict states that, by reason of the great increase and wide circulation\r\nof heresies, the catalogues heretofore published are no longer\r\nsufficient. The Inquisition has therefore determined to prepare a new\r\nand comprehensive list of books which have been condemned, and with\r\nsuch lists to publish a series of general authoritative regulations\r\nfor the control of the printing and the reading of books. Quiroga\r\nutilised for the compilation of the Index representatives of the three\r\nuniversities and a number of other scholars. The regulations prohibit,\r\nunder the penalty of the _excommunicatio latae sententiae_, the reading\r\nor the possession (either in bookshops or in private collections)\r\nof the books specified, or of any books containing the pernicious\r\nand heretical doctrines described in the general classification. To\r\nthe secretary of the Inquisition, as consideration for his labour in\r\nthe compilation of this Index, were assigned the “rights” for its\r\npublication. It may well be doubted, however, whether this publishing\r\nprivilege brought to the secretary any very substantial return; as\r\nexcepting in the case of the Tridentine, no one of the series of\r\nIndexes appears to have secured any remunerative sale.\r\n\r\nThe Quiroga Index contains no reference to that of Trent, but the\r\nTridentine lists were largely utilised in its compilation, and the\r\nfourteen “rules” of Quiroga were evidently based upon the Ten Rules\r\nformulated in 1564. In the Spanish rules, however, the authority of\r\nthe Inquisition is throughout substituted for that of bishops and\r\ntheological faculties. Books prohibited in one version are to be held\r\nas prohibited in all versions, a modification repeated later by Clement\r\nVIII. There is a general prohibition of issues in the vernacular of any\r\nportions of the Scriptures. The largest schedule in Quiroga is that\r\nof works in Latin, comprising fifty-seven pages. The other lists give\r\ntitles in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Flemish, and German in\r\nthe order of importance specified. The lists of Valdes were in large\r\npart repeated, and those of Antwerp and Lisbon were also drawn upon.\r\nThe Quiroga served in its turn as the basis for the Index of Sixtus V,\r\nthe next in order from Rome.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the introduction of a number of works by good\r\nCatholics, the editors have addressed the following “Note to the\r\nReader”:\r\n\r\n   “The prohibition of certain books bearing the names of writers\r\n   well known throughout the Christian world as devout believers\r\n   is not to be construed as a condemnation of the men themselves\r\n   or as a charge that they have fallen from the true faith.\r\n   In some cases heretical writings have falsely been issued\r\n   under their names; in others, heretical publishers or editors\r\n   have connected with the original text (in itself, orthodox)\r\n   heretical notes, comments, or interpolations; and in yet others,\r\n   writings addressed to scholars and suited only for scholarly\r\n   understandings have been printed in the language of the common\r\n   folk and circulated in such fashion as to cause mischief and\r\n   error to unlearned believers, unskilled in matters of doctrine;\r\n   and, finally, there are works which, while of service in the\r\n   period in which they were issued and for the special purpose for\r\n   which they were prepared, have fulfilled their mission and ought\r\n   now to be withdrawn and cancelled.”\r\n\r\nAmong the authors whose names are connected with this note are Fisher\r\n(Bishop of Rochester), More, Osorio, Luis de Granda, Cajetanus, Tapper,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nQuiroga’s list of Italian writers includes the following entry:\r\n\r\n_Petrarca, los sonetos siguentes, Del’ empia Babylonia, Otro Fiama\r\ndel ciel. Otro Fontana di dolore. Otro L’avara Babylonia._\r\n\r\nPetrarch’s name does not appear in the Index of Paul IV or in that of\r\nPius IV. It is to be found in that of Sixtus V, 1590, but in subsequent\r\nRoman Indexes it has been dropped. The later Spanish Indexes have\r\nperpetuated, however, this condemnation of the Florentine poet.\r\n\r\nThe character of the criticism of the Church which Petrarch had\r\nexpressed in certain of these objectionable sonnets and which, while\r\nextenuated by the Roman censors, had aroused the indignation of those\r\nof Madrid, is indicated in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    _Fontana di dolore, albergo d’ira,\r\n    Scola d’errori; e tempio d’heresia,\r\n    Gia Roma, hor Babilonia, falsa e ria,\r\n    Per chi tanto si piagne, e si sospira._\r\n\r\n_7._ _1584._ _Toledo._ _Quiroga._ _Index Librorum Expurgatorum._\r\nThe original is reported as exceedingly scarce. The work is known\r\nthrough the reprint in Bonn, 1601, and that in Hanover, 1611. Mendham\r\nreports[164] that the Earl of Essex brought to Thomas Bodley a copy\r\nthat he had secured, at the taking of Cadiz, from the library of Bishop\r\nOsorius. This was the text utilised by Thomas James (first librarian\r\nof the Bodleian) for the edition printed at Bonn. Llorente states[165]\r\nthat the work of compiling the Index was done by the Jesuit, Juan de\r\nMariana. The introduction states that the task has been undertaken as a\r\nbeginning and with the hope that it may serve as a suggestion to godly\r\nand learned men to continue the all-important work of the purging of\r\nliterature; for there are many books calling for expurgation, because\r\non the one hand the heretics are always busying themselves with the\r\ntask of corrupting the writings of accepted authors; while on the\r\nother, it is borne in mind that the heretics themselves have produced\r\nworks which can be made of service for science or for scholarship, when\r\nthey have been freed from pernicious passages or errors. Pains should,\r\ntherefore, be taken so to plan the necessary corrections that these can\r\nbe made with the smallest possible expenditure of labour or of money.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth rule of the Quiroga Index of 1583 directs that any\r\nheresies or errors that may be found in new books are at once to be\r\nreported to the Inquisition, but that the reader must not take upon\r\nhimself the responsibility of cancelling the passages or of burning\r\nthe copies. The expurgation of the books whose titles are given in the\r\nIndex is to be undertaken only by those delegated by the Inquisition\r\nfor the purpose. The schedule of heresiarchs (chief heretics) contains\r\nseventy-six names. The list was reduced by Sandoval to eighteen names.\r\nThese may be specified if only to indicate the basis of the Spanish\r\nclassification of heresy: Wyclif, Huss, Luther, Melanchthon, Zwingli,\r\nCalvin, Beza, Carlstadt, Osiander, Brenz, Bucer, Oecolampadius, Servet\r\n(Servetus), Stancarus, Pacimontanus, Schwenkfeld, Rotmann, Georgius. In\r\nthe Roman Indexes, only that of Sixtus presents a similar list.\r\n\r\nClass I constitutes a large division in the Quiroga Index. The\r\ncompilers find deserving of condemnation the entire works of a number\r\nof authors of whose writings only single books appear in the Tridentine\r\nlists. It was probably less troublesome to put an author once for all\r\nin the class of heretics than to incur the labour of examining all of\r\nhis productions.\r\n\r\nIn Class II, I may note the name of Theophrastus Paracelsus (1541)\r\nconnected with his _Libri tres Chirurgiae_. One of the three books\r\nwas permitted in the expurgated edition. In later Indexes, Paracelsus\r\nis reproved because his writings contain so many magic and cabalistic\r\nnames which are hardly to be understood.\r\n\r\n_8._ _1588._ _Naples._ _F. Gregorius Capucinus._ In 1588 was published\r\nat Venice a handbook for confessors, prepared by F. Gregorius, a\r\nCapucin monk. It bears the title: _Enchiridion Ecclesiasticum sive\r\nPraeparatio pertinens ad Sacramentum Poenitentiae et Sacri Ordinis,\r\nEditum a R. P. F. Gregorio Capucino Neapolitano uno ex Deputatis\r\nPatribus pro Revisione Librorum in Civitate Neapolitana ... cum\r\nPrivilegio S. Fran. Inst. Regu. Fr. Min. Venetiis ... H. Polo\r\nTypographo Venito imprimente_.\r\n\r\nThe volume possesses no official character, but is referred to by\r\nMendham[166] as important because of its references to forbidden and\r\nexpurgated books. Gregorius takes occasion to caution his readers\r\nagainst the _Index expurgatorius_ of Quiroga as unsound, because\r\nQuiroga fails to condemn the works of Molinaeus and Raymond Lullus, and\r\ndoes not make sufficient excisions in the _Practica Papiensis_\r\nof Petrus de Ferrariis. In the succeeding Spanish Indexes, we\r\nfind, as might be expected, a condemnation and prohibition of the\r\n_Enchiridion_ of Gregorius.\r\n\r\nThis Naples Index is described as very scarce. A copy is, however,\r\ncontained in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue or Index forming the second division of the work\r\nbegins on page 146 under the title of _Libri Corrigendi_. The\r\npreface to the catalogue makes clear its connection with the general\r\nsubject of the work. It begins as follows: _Quomodo Confessor\r\npotest cognoscere, si poenitens tenetur ad aliquot placatum, ob\r\nlectionem librorum, qui sunt a Catholicis editi, sed sunt infecti\r\net prohibiti ob interpositionem haereticorum, qui se interposuerunt\r\nindictis libris, et aliorum qui sunt adnotati et prohibiti in Indice\r\nRomano vel Tridentino.... Hoc potest cognosci ex sequenti lista; sed\r\nest quaedam adnotatio, sive memoria edita, A. M. R. D. D. Johanne\r\nFranciso Lombardo_, etc. _Post longum studium contra libros\r\nhaereticorum._\r\n\r\nCapucino adds, after presenting his list:\r\n\r\n   “Finally, avoid carefully a certain book entitled _Index\r\n   of Books to be Expurgated_, printed at Madrid by Alphonso\r\n   Gomez in the year 1584, since we must rather believe the\r\n   statement false that it was printed in such a city and by the\r\n   said Alphonso, and also the statement that it was printed and\r\n   published by the body of the supreme Catholic senate. And\r\n   among other erroneous or heretical passages contained in it is\r\n   that which says that some of the works of Carolus Molinaeus, a\r\n   heretic of the first class, may be permitted without correction.”\r\n\r\nThe editor was not successful in securing for this theory of\r\ninterpretation the approval of the Inquisition, and was himself, in\r\n1590, brought to the stake at Salamanca as a heretic. Llorente[167]\r\nstates that at the same _auto da fe_, Torquemada caused to be\r\nburned many Hebrew Bibles and six thousand other volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                 ROMAN INDEXES AND DECREES, 1590–1661\r\n\r\n    1. 1590.

The work was completed\r\nwithin two years and was printed in July, 1590, by Paul Bladus. This\r\nis the first Index the compilation of which was carried out by the\r\nCongregation. It is issued in the form of a Bull with the following\r\ntitle:\r\n\r\n_Bulla Smi. D. N. Sixti Papae V. Emendationis indicis cum suis\r\nRegulis super librorum prohibitione, expurgatione et revisione necnon\r\ncum abrogatione caeterorum indicum hactenus editorum, et revocatione\r\nfacultatis edendorum, nisi ad praescriptam harum regularam normam._\r\n\r\nThe substance of the Bull may be summarised as follows: Bull of\r\nthe most revered Lord and Father, Pope Sixtus V, in regard to the\r\nproduction of a revised Index, with which are given the Pope’s\r\nregulations concerning the prohibition, expurgation, and revision\r\nof books, together with the abrogation of the authority of Indexes\r\npreviously issued, and the revocation of the authority to print Index\r\nregulations other than those herewith presented. The Bull makes\r\nreference to the precedents for prohibitory censorship as having been\r\nestablished by Gelasius I and Gregory IX. Reference is also made to\r\nthe establishment of the Congregation of the Index, by which this\r\nresponsibility is hereafter to be discharged.\r\n\r\nTo the annexed _Regulae_ are attached the “penalties” of Pius IV.\r\nThe Index is presented for universal acceptance as possessing final\r\nauthority, and the publication by individuals, universities, or other\r\ninstitutions of Indexes, compiled without the specific approval of the\r\nHoly See, is prohibited. The edict is exceptional in the history of\r\nIndexes, and it is in order to cite its phraseology:\r\n\r\n_Universos indices quacunque auctoritate etiam praedecessorum\r\nnostrorum hucusque et ubilibet locorum editos, ad hunc nostrum indicem,\r\ntanquam ad normam ab apostolica sede praescriptum, ex qua recte\r\nsentiendi, credendi, docendique leges in omnem ecclesiam manare par\r\nest, revocamus, et exteris quibuscunque sublatio, hunc tantum, et ejus\r\nregulas ab omnibus personis, et sub poenis omnibus, quae in praedictis\r\nPii IIII literis exprimuntur, et quas praesenti decreto innovamus,\r\napostolica auctoritate tenore praesentium servari, praecipimus, et\r\nmandamus._\r\n\r\nThe rules which follow, and which are to supersede those of Trent, are\r\ntwenty-two in number.\r\n\r\n_Regula I_ (which is one of the new ordinances) reads: _Quicunque\r\nsanctorum patrum libros, vel Scripta fidem, seu mores concernentia,\r\nab ecclesia hactenus recepta, non admiserunt, poenis a jure statutis\r\npuniantur_. _Regula II: Quoniam vero iidem sancti doctores, vel quia\r\nante obortas haereses, vel quia, ut eas surgentes impugnarent, fidei\r\nzelo accensi, quibusdam interdum locationibus usi sunt, quas postea\r\nDei ecclesia Spiritu sancto edocta rejecit, nemini posthac eas tenere,\r\naut eis uti liceat; sanctis vero ipsis doctoribus, quia non animo ab\r\necclesia Catholica, recedendi talia scripserunt, debita reverentia\r\ndeferatur._\r\n\r\nThe ninth rule forbids the circulation of innocent books by heretical\r\nwriters unless the names of the authors are expunged. The sixteenth\r\nrestrains the circulation of manuscripts. The nineteenth limits the\r\nprinting of sacred and ecclesiastical books to cities where the aid\r\nof an inquisitor may be had; and the books printed must be conformed\r\nto the exemplar in the Vatican. The twentieth directs visitations of\r\nbooksellers’ shops, and forbids private persons to burn proscribed\r\nbooks, ordering them to deliver such to the master of the sacred palace\r\nor to the local inquisitor. The twenty-first prescribes the expurgation\r\nof sacred or ecclesiastical books, such as the _Decretals_, etc.,\r\nwhich have been corrupted by heretics. The twenty-second warns the\r\nfaithful that if they offend by reading or retaining the prohibited\r\nbooks, they will incur a sentence of excommunication, from which\r\nthey can be absolved only by papal authority, except in the hour of\r\ndeath, and then only upon giving evidence of true penitence. The rules\r\nconclude with an instruction to booksellers to possess themselves of\r\nthe present authoritative Index in order that they may have no pretext\r\nfor ignorance. A similar instruction is given to all who concern\r\nthemselves with the reading or possession of books that they are to\r\npossess and read this same Index.\r\n\r\nSixtus died a few weeks after the printing of his Index, and when but\r\nfew copies of the same had been sent out. Reusch states that (as was\r\nthe case with the Sistine edition of the Vulgate) no further copies\r\nwere distributed after the Pope’s death, and the copies which had\r\nbeen sent out were, as far as possible, recalled and the edition was\r\ndestroyed. The copies of the original issue are, therefore, at this\r\ntime very scarce. In 1835, however, the Sistine Index was reprinted by\r\nMendham under the following title:\r\n\r\n_Index librorum prohibitorum a Sixto V Papa, confectus et publicatus;\r\nat vero a successoribus ejus in sede Romana suppressus. Edenta Joseph\r\nMendham, London, 1835._\r\n\r\nThe Index is classified in three divisions. The heading of the second\r\ndivision does not, I believe, appear in any other published Index:\r\n_Deinde adduntur nomina Catholicorum quorum libri aut auctoris\r\nincuria, aut etiam impressoris negligentia, doctrinam non sanam, sed\r\nsuspectam, et bonorum morum offensivam continere videntur_.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the possibility is admitted of the appearance\r\nin the works of Catholic writers of doctrine that is unsound or that\r\nis offensive to good morals. The right purpose or intention of such\r\nwriters may be protected under the term “appear” (_videntur_).\r\n\r\nWhile the Index of Sixtus never came into general circulation, it\r\nhas importance in the series because its lists were utilised as the\r\nfoundation for the Index of Clement VIII. In 1591, the edition of the\r\nVulgate undertaken by Sixtus V came into consideration with Gregory\r\nXIV. The Pope had been advised to condemn and prohibit the work, but\r\nhe finally decided to have it reprinted with the corrections and\r\neliminations thought necessary, with a preface explaining that in the\r\noriginal issue, certain errors had found place, errors for which the\r\ncopyists and printers were responsible.\r\n\r\nIn the condemnation of the treatise of the Jesuit Bellarmin (on\r\nthe authority of the papacy) and of the _Reflectiones_ of the\r\nDominican Vittoria, Sixtus acted on his individual authority. The\r\nInquisition and the Congregation of the Index declined to condemn\r\neither book. The Sistine is the only one of the papal Indexes that\r\ncontains a list of heresiarchs. The list is entitled: _Catalogus\r\nHaeresiarcharum, Haeresum auctorum eorumque qui eas suscitarum\r\nseu Haereticorum duces aut capita extiterunt, qui ad faciliorem\r\nintelligentium quartae regulae hujus indicis apponitur_. The list\r\ncompiled by Quiroga has been utilised for this. Fifteen of Quiroga’s\r\nheresiarchs have been omitted, and twenty new names are added. Among\r\nthe eliminations are Ochinus, Ramus, and Agrippa, and among the\r\nadditions are several Hussites and Anabaptists, and Marsilius of Padua.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican, Alfonsus Ciaconius, charged by the Congregation with\r\nthe task of defining an heresiarch, reported that those are to be so\r\nclassed who discover new heresies or who revive ancient errors, or who\r\npresent in heretical institutions a defence of heretical doctrines,\r\nor who undertake in councils the defence of heretics. The name of\r\nCiaconius comes into record also in connection with the following\r\nstatement concerning the Inquisition:\r\n\r\n   “The Roman and the Spanish Inquisition have the same purpose,\r\n   the maintenance of the Catholic faith. It is to be borne in\r\n   mind, however, that the former is the superior, the latter the\r\n   subordinate body; the Roman is the mother, the Spanish the\r\n   daughter; the Roman is to be likened to the Sun, the Spanish\r\n   to the Moon dependent upon the Sun for its light. In the case\r\n   in which the Roman Inquisition presents one conclusion and the\r\n   Spanish another, the faithful churchman will be guided by the\r\n   authority of Rome.”[168]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the point of view is naturally different, and the Spanish\r\nInquisition has always claimed independence from the authority of Rome,\r\nand has often refused to be bound by the regulations issued by the\r\nRoman inquisitor-general.\r\n\r\nSixtus is the first Pope who undertook to retain for the exclusive\r\naction of the Holy Chair, or of the Congregation working under papal\r\ninstructions, the authority for the production of Indexes, for the\r\nprohibition of individual books, for the expurgation of books which\r\nin a modified form it was considered important to preserve, and the\r\ngeneral supervision of the reading of the Church. Preceding popes had\r\naccepted, if not without question at least without formal protest,\r\nthe claims made by the Inquisition or by the Crown of Spain, by the\r\nInquisition or by the universities of the Low Countries, by the\r\nInquisition of Portugal, and by the University of Paris, to produce\r\nIndexes both prohibitory and expurgatory, to publish regulations\r\ncontrolling the production and the use of books, and to institute\r\nand to execute punishments for the breach of such regulations. The\r\ninjunctions of Sixtus, promptly recalled by his successor, seem to have\r\nhad practically no influence towards the prevention or the lessening\r\nof such undertakings on the part of national or local authorities. The\r\nsuccessors of Sixtus wisely abandoned the attempt to retain for the\r\nHoly Chair the exclusive control of this troublesome business.\r\n\r\nSixtus finds place among the authors of Class I for two hundred names,\r\npractically doubling the list contained in the Tridentine Index. He\r\nutilised, in making his additions, the catalogues of Quiroga, the\r\nlexicon of Frisius, and the book-catalogue of the Frankfort Fair as\r\nprinted in the years 1583–87. The general copying of the names from\r\nFrisius and from the Fair catalogues, has the result of bringing into\r\nthe Sistine lists a number of unimportant writers whose names would\r\notherwise hardly have been preserved, certain others whose books were\r\nannounced but never came into publication, and, finally, some good\r\nCatholic authors, editions of whose writings happened to be brought\r\ninto print by Frankfort publishers whose imprints had previously\r\nbeen associated with heresy. Among the orthodox ecclesiastics who\r\nthus secured undeserved condemnation were Caspar Macer, Bishop of\r\nRegensberg, and Andreas Critius, Archbishop of Poland.\r\n\r\nCertain of the entries in the Index deserve separate attention. In the\r\nlist of books published appears the entry, Joannis Casae, _Poemata_.\r\nThis work appears in the Index of Paul IV. Its author is spoken of\r\nby Mendham as “that infamous prelate.”[169] In the Index of Trent,\r\nhowever, the prohibition was removed, Pius IV having apparently\r\nconcluded that the transgressor had done sufficient penance. Under the\r\nauthority of Sixtus, the prohibition was, as stated, renewed, but in\r\nall subsequent Indexes the title is omitted. Another entry to be noted\r\nis the following: Roberti Bellarmini, _Disputationes de Controversiis\r\nChristianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis haereticos_. To this title\r\nis affixed the note: _Nisi prius ex superioribus regulis recognitae\r\nfuerint_. It is difficult to understand why the stalwart champion of\r\nRoman orthodoxy should have been placed under the ban. It is Mendham’s\r\nsuggestion that in the third of the _Disputations_ in question,\r\nwhich has to do with the power of the Roman pontiff, Bellarmin had\r\nstated that power to be no more than indirect as to temporals. The\r\ncensure made necessary a public revocation and self-correction on the\r\npart of the offender. After the death of the critical Sixtus, the\r\ncardinal is said to have vented his resentment as follows: _Conceptis\r\nverbis, quantum capio, quantum sapio, quantum intelligo, descendit ad\r\ninfernum_. The authority for this citation is Baxter’s _Safe Religion_,\r\nin which is quoted the report of William Watson, an English priest, to\r\nwhom the utterance was made.[170]\r\n\r\nThe name of the Englishwoman Anne Askew finds place in Class I (entered\r\nas Anna a Skeue), the only other woman thus honoured being Magdalena\r\nHeymairin. In the Index of 1597, Anne’s name is entered A. S. Keuue,\r\nwhich a conscientious reader, trying to avoid pernicious literature,\r\nmight also find difficulty in identifying. The Sistine compilers have\r\nmade a curious blunder in including in their lists the titles of a\r\nnumber of university controversial dissertations, which had been\r\nprepared for the defence of orthodox doctrine against the assaults of\r\ncertain heretical opponents. The Frankfort catalogue, in its entries\r\nof the heretical treatises, had brought in the names of the orthodox\r\nwriters to whom these treatises were replies.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances, the Sistine lists repeat in Class III,\r\nwithout the names of the writers, the titles of books the authors of\r\nwhich had already been condemned _in toto_ in Class I. It is\r\ndifficult to understand the ground for the insertion in Class III of\r\na long series of historical works which appear to have possessed no\r\ntheological or doctrinal character. The titles had been taken from the\r\nFrankfort catalogues of the publishers Feyerabend and Wechel, probably\r\nbecause these publishers had come into heretical repute in connection\r\nwith previous books.\r\n\r\nThe compilers had discovered the pernicious character of a monograph\r\nby William Camden, published in London in 1584, under the patronage of\r\nLord Robert Cecil. Camden undertook to prove that there had been under\r\nElizabeth no persecution of the Catholics on the ground of their faith.\r\nIn the same group, finds place the title of the monograph by John Knox\r\n(but the author’s name is not given) described as _Liber Contra\r\nRegimen Feminarum_; the original English title, _The First Blast\r\nof the Trumpet against the Monstruous Regiment and Empire of Women_,\r\nis correctly printed for the first time in the Index of Benedict,\r\n1758. The edition of the monograph that came into consideration with\r\nthe Sistine compilers had been printed in Geneva in 1558. The original\r\nissue had been censured (under the directions of Queen Elizabeth)\r\nby the Archbishop of Canterbury and in 1583 was condemned by the\r\nUniversity of Oxford. No sufficient cause appears for the prohibition\r\nof the _Chronology_ of Gerard Mercator. In 1663, the famous atlas\r\nof Mercator was placed on the prohibited list, a prohibition that was\r\nconfirmed by Benedict a century and a half later. It is possible that\r\nthe dedication to Queen Elizabeth of these two books may have worked\r\nto their prejudice. The introduction to the treatise _De Mundi\r\nCreatione_, which is printed with the atlas, contains some remarks\r\nin regard to the six days’ work of creation which may have been thought\r\nto be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe historians are of opinion that succeeding popes, and the Church\r\nitself, believed it to be essential for the interest of the Church to\r\nsuppress this erratic and exceptional production of Pope Sixtus, and\r\nas far as any continued influence of the Index itself was concerned,\r\nsuch a result was certainly secured. Hilgers takes the ground that\r\nthis Index, never having been published, is not to be classed as an\r\nauthentic utterance of the Church. There is a curious reference,\r\nmade in the Index published six years later by Clement VIII, to the\r\nintention that had been formed by Sixtus for the preparation of an\r\nIndex and to the fact that he (Sixtus) had departed this life without\r\ncarrying this plan into execution. The words of Clement are as follows:\r\n_Verum cum idem Sixtus, re minime absoluta, ab hominis excesserit:\r\nNos hoc tempore omnino perficiendum atque in lucem edendum duximus._\r\n\r\nGregoris Lati, the biographer of Pope Sixtus, describes the special\r\npurpose of a printing-office instituted by him. The description is\r\nthought to indicate that some considerable “purification” was at times\r\nfound advisable in the text of editions issued through the papal press:\r\n\r\n_Non lungi della Libraria_ [the Vatican] _vi fece fabricare Sixto\r\nuna Stampa capacissima, acciò che i Libri corotti, e profanati dagli\r\nHeretici, e pieni di gravissimi errori si emendassero e si reducissero\r\nal primiero candore, ed alla prima puritá, e si rimettessero, alla loro\r\nsincera verita, stampandosi, e publicandosi con migliore ordine, e\r\nregola._[171]\r\n\r\n_2._ _1596._ _Rome_, _Clement VIII_, _Index Prohibitorius_. In\r\nApril, 1592, within a few months after his accession, Clement gave\r\ninstructions to the Congregation for the production of a new Index.\r\nAs before mentioned, the Index of Sixtus had been cancelled and\r\nwithdrawn and the Clementine Index was intended to be used as a direct\r\ncontinuation of that of Pius IV. The responsibility for the direction\r\nof the new compilation came upon Bellarmin, who, as consultor of\r\nthe Congregation, had secured the papal disapproval of the work of\r\nSixtus. The title of the Clementine Index makes acknowledgment however\r\nof the initiative taken by Sixtus. The title reads: _Index librorum\r\nprohibitorum cum regulis confectis per Patres a Tridentina Synodo\r\ndelectos auctoritate Pii IIII primum editus postea vero a Sixto V\r\nauctus et nunc demum S. D. N. Clementis PP. VIII jussu, recognitus &\r\npublicatus. Instructione adjecta. De exequendae prohibitionis, dèque\r\nsincere emendandi & imprimendi libros, ratione. Romae, apud Impressores\r\nCamerales._ 1596.\r\n\r\nThe completed draft of the Index of Clement (probably in the form of\r\nproof sheets) was placed in the Pope’s hands by the Cardinal of Ascoli\r\n(the Dominican Bernerio) as early as July, 1593. Clement decided to\r\ndelay the publication in order to give opportunity for suggestions\r\nand criticisms. Baronius submitted certain objections which secured\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe first of the briefs of Clement is simply a restraint on the right\r\nof printing. The second, bearing date October 17, 1595, makes the usual\r\nreference to Gelasius I as the founder of the Index, adds a credit\r\nto Gregory IX, and then passes on to Pius IV. Then follows a minute\r\ndetail concerning the intention, described as having been executed only\r\nin part, of Sixtus V. The remainder of the brief is taken up with a\r\nspecification of the work of Clement in completing the plan of Sixtus,\r\nwith the statement that Clement had commissioned a congregation of\r\ncardinals who had been charged with the prohibition, expurgation, and\r\nregulation of the impression of books. The wording of the reference\r\nto the Congregation of the Index would give the impression that this\r\nwas here instituted for the first time. Catalani is authority for\r\nthe statement that the Congregation certainly existed under Gregory\r\nXIII and probably as early as Pius IV. Mendham finds authority, as\r\npreviously stated, for crediting the Congregation to Sixtus V. The\r\nbrief of Clement is followed by the brief and preface of the Tridentine\r\nedition, with the Ten Rules restored to their place by the suppression\r\nof the Sistine two and twenty.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Clement bears to that of Sixtus a relation similar to\r\nthat borne by the Index of Pius IV to that of Paul IV; but a larger\r\nportion of the Sistine lists was cancelled by the Clementine compilers.\r\nThe order of arrangement follows that of the Index of Trent, the new\r\nnames and new titles being brought in as appendices at the close of\r\neach class, and as additions after each letter. The Ten Rules of Trent\r\nare repeated with the addition of certain “observations” in regard to\r\ntranslations of the Scriptures, works on astrology, the _Talmud_\r\nand other Jewish writings. The most distinctive addition to the\r\nregulations is an instruction placing in the hands of the bishop and\r\ninquisitors (or in Rome in those of the _Magister S. Palatii_)\r\nthe responsibility for the prohibition or expurgation of books that\r\nwere already in print, and for the examination of writings for which a\r\nprinting license was issued. In the brief printed as an introduction,\r\nthe Pope confirms the powers, privileges, and instructions given by\r\nPius V, Gregory XIII, and Sixtus V to the _Magister S. Palatii_\r\nand to the cardinals of the Congregation. The brief goes on to state\r\nthat in the case of any questions or controversies arising in regard to\r\nthe interpretation of the rules and regulations as supplemented, these\r\nshall be passed upon by the Congregation, or in matters of special\r\nmoment shall be referred to the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Clement is the only papal Index which, before coming\r\ninto publication, secured the advantage of consideration from various\r\npoints of view and of a revision extending over three years. The\r\nVenetian ambassador, writing in January and again in March, 1594,\r\nmakes reference to a number of protests that had been submitted, on\r\nbehalf of the scholars and publishers of Italy, in regard to the long\r\nlist of additions to the Index of Italian works. It would appear that\r\nthe Pope took a more liberal view of these Italian writings than that\r\nexpressed by the work of the Congregation. Baronius, writing in July,\r\n1593, to Lipsius, reports that the Pope had found it necessary to\r\ndisapprove the lists as prepared, although these were already in print.\r\nBellarmin, writing late in the same year, explains that his other\r\nduties had compelled him to be absent from many of the sittings of the\r\nCongregation. He appears to desire to make clear that the errors of\r\njudgment complained of did not belong to his responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn the schedules as finally approved, Clement omits from Class I, as\r\nfirst shaped by Sixtus, fifteen names; the only one of these which\r\nmay be considered as of continuing interest is that of Paracelsus. The\r\nadditions to this class comprise twenty-five names. Among these are\r\nincluded a number of Englishmen, such as Matthew Parker of Canterbury,\r\nMatthew Hutton of York, William Fulke, and John Knewstub.\r\n\r\nIn Classes II and III, Clement has omitted (in the list as finally\r\nrevised) a number of astrological works which had been included by\r\nSixtus, a series of Italian poets and novelists, and a group of Spanish\r\ntitles taken from Quiroga. The few additions to Class II contain few\r\nnames of present note. Franciscus Patritius Nova, who held the chair of\r\nphilosophy at Ferrara, had in his lectures on the philosophy of Plato\r\ngiven to Bellarmin and others ground for criticism. Franciscus had, in\r\na letter to Gregory XIV, strongly recommended that the philosophical\r\nteachings of Aristotle should be excluded from all the schools of\r\nChristendom, and that the Church should give its approval to the\r\ndoctrines of Plato (as interpreted in his own lectures).\r\n\r\nThe _Apologia_ of Davila, printed in Madrid in 1591, is the first\r\nwork of the Spanish Regalists (defenders of the authority of the State)\r\nto find place in the Roman Index. Through the 17th century, the list of\r\nthe Spanish treatises of this school condemned by the Roman authorities\r\nis a long one.\r\n\r\nIn Class III, have been added a number of treatises from the Low\r\nCountries, from Germany, and from France, bearing on the relations\r\nof Church and State. The list includes a _Gratulatio_ from\r\nSwitzerland to France for the accession of the most Christian King of\r\nFrance and of Navarre, Henry IV.\r\n\r\nThe “Instruction” of Clement, which is included as an appendix to the\r\nRules of Trent, includes the following provisions:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (I) Concerning the Prohibition of Books]\r\n\r\n(1) All bishops and inquisitors are instructed to give orders that,\r\nunder heavy penalties for disobedience, their people must within a\r\nlimited period make delivery of all copies of the books condemned.\r\n\r\n(2) The bishops and inquisitors (in Rome the _Magister S. Palatii_)\r\nare authorised to give permission to men of assured holiness and\r\nscholarship to retain, for a period not exceeding three years,\r\ncopies of the forbidden books. They bind themselves to report to the\r\nauthorities, in the books which are permitted _donec corrigatur_, such\r\npassages as they may find to be heretical.\r\n\r\n(3) Outside of Italy, the responsibility for the distribution of the\r\nlists of heretical and immoral books rests with the bishops, the\r\ninquisitors, and the universities. The instructions to the people in\r\nregard to the reading or possession of such books are to be given\r\nby the bishops and inquisitors. This instruction was for a time\r\ninterpreted as an authority given by the pope for the preparation of\r\nlocal Indexes. In 1621, however, the Index Congregation issued an order\r\nprohibiting the further production of any such local lists, or the\r\nfurther circulation of the lists already in print.\r\n\r\n(4) The nuncios and legates in foreign lands, and in Italy the bishops\r\nand inquisitors, are to submit annually to the Curia or to the\r\nIndex Congregation lists of the books published in their respective\r\nterritories, which in their judgment call for expurgation or are\r\ndeserving of condemnation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (II) Concerning the Correction of Books]\r\n\r\n(1) The responsibility for the expurgation of books in accordance\r\nwith the principles laid down in this Index rests with the bishops\r\nand inquisitors, or, where there are no inquisitors, with the bishops\r\nalone. They are instructed to secure for such work the service of two\r\nor three scholarly and pious men.\r\n\r\n(2) The expurgators are instructed to cancel passages from the\r\nScriptures which have been wrongly worded by heretical translators,\r\nunless it may be that such passages have been cited simply for the\r\npurpose of refutation; passages which give praise or commendation\r\nto heretics or their writings; passages adverse to the freedom, the\r\nimmunity, and the jurisdiction of the Church; passages which undertake\r\nto defend the tyranny of the State, or which give countenance to\r\ntheories adverse to the authority of ecclesiastical and Christian law.\r\n\r\n(3) In the books of Catholics written after 1515, when the necessary\r\ncorrection can be arrived at through the introduction or omission of\r\nsingle words, this course shall be taken. If this is not practicable,\r\nthe entire passage or chapter must be cancelled.\r\n\r\n(4) In the writings of the earlier Catholics, no alterations shall be\r\nmade except in the case of passages which have been inserted through\r\nthe malice of heretics or through the heedlessness of printers.\r\n\r\nWhen the pernicious material appears to be of distinctive importance,\r\nit will be well to order the production of a new and corrected edition\r\nwhich shall take the place of the erroneous text. The essential purpose\r\nto accomplish is the presentation, in clear and comprehensible form, of\r\nthe actual doctrine and original thought of the writer.\r\n\r\nMendham points out that, according to this rule, the correctors or\r\ncompilers of expurgatory indexes were apparently placed in a position\r\nto assume a _fraus haereticorum_ whenever such assumption seemed\r\ndesirable for their purpose, and to amend the text accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with which the papal authorities were here contending\r\nhad to do with the text of the earlier printed editions of the\r\nwritings of the Fathers of the Church, and of certain of the later\r\necclesiastical writers. In preparing these editions for the press,\r\nthe more scholarly and careful of the printer-publishers, such as\r\nthe Stephani in Paris, Froben in Basel, and Koberger in Nuremberg,\r\nfound it necessary to collate as many copies as could be secured of\r\nthe MSS. which had been accepted as more or less authoritative. In\r\ncertain cases, as for instance with the Stephani, the editorial work\r\nwas done by the publisher himself; while in others the service of\r\nscholarly revisers was secured. It does not appear from the history or\r\ncorrespondence of these publishers that they had any doctrinal purposes\r\nin view. It seems to have been their wish, if only as a matter of\r\nbusiness importance, to secure for the printed book the most accurate\r\nand complete text possible. There are not a few references in the\r\ncorrespondence of their editors to the unsatisfactory condition of many\r\nMS. texts, on the teachings of which had been based important matters\r\nof doctrine or large contentions for ecclesiastical control. There\r\nis at least fair ground for the belief that the so-called heretical\r\neliminations and corrections complained of by the Index authorities\r\nrepresented simply the attempts of the best scholarship of the day\r\nto correct the blunders and the wilful garblings of scribes (working\r\nunder ecclesiastical direction) who had prepared the accepted MSS.\r\npresenting the teachings of the earlier leaders of the Church.\r\n\r\n(5) When publication has been made by the bishop and inquisitor of\r\na _Codex expurgatorius_, the owners of the books concerned are\r\npermitted, under an authorisation from such bishop, etc., themselves to\r\nmake in their own copies the corrections required by the Index. Reusch\r\npoints out that permission for such individual correction was never\r\ngranted under the regulations of the Spanish Inquisition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (III) Concerning the Printing of Books]\r\n\r\nEach book must carry on its title-page specification of the full\r\nname and nationality of the author and of the printer, and of the\r\nlocation of the printing-office. In an exceptional case, the bishop\r\nand inquisitor have authority to permit the anonymous publication of\r\na work, but the name of author and of printer, with their respective\r\naddresses, must be duly recorded. Before the printer is permitted to\r\nbring his volume into type, he is required to submit to bishop and to\r\ninquisitor the complete text of the same, and, after this has been\r\nexamined, to secure the necessary permit or privilege. The application\r\nof this regulation varied materially in different districts, but\r\nthe methods adopted frequently brought upon the printer-publisher\r\nso considerable an outlay as to render unprofitable an undertaking\r\notherwise promising. In connection with the increase in certain centres\r\nof the number of books planned for publication, the examiners found an\r\nincreasing difficulty in keeping up with the labour of passing upon\r\neach portion of the text before issuing the necessary permit. They\r\nbegan to take the ground of refusing to trouble themselves with the\r\nexamination of MSS., and of insisting on having the completed texts\r\nplaced before them in the form of printed sheets. This necessitated\r\non the part of the printer the striking off of an entire edition in\r\nadvance of securing the privilege for its publication. In these earlier\r\nstages of the work of printing, the making of plates was of course\r\nunknown. The fonts of type were small and the “sheets” (comprising from\r\nfour to sixteen pages) had to be worked off, each by itself, in the\r\nfull number of impressions required, in order that the type might be\r\nfreed for the setting of the succeeding “sheets” or “signatures.” The\r\nprinter would laboriously strike off with his hand-press 250 or 350\r\nimpressions of four, eight, twelve, or sixteen pages, and only when\r\nsuch impressions had been completed, would he have type available for\r\nthe setting of the next form. In the case, therefore, in which the\r\nexaminers decided that the book could be permitted publication only\r\nafter more or less serious changes and corrections, the outlay incurred\r\nin producing this first set of sheets would be practically thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe printer-publishers and also the booksellers were required to\r\nmake oath from year to year that they would carry on their business\r\nin full accord with the principles of the holy Catholic Church,\r\nthe decrees and rules of the Index, and the regulations of the\r\nlocal bishops and inquisitors. In the case of the publication of an\r\nauthorised, expurgated edition of a work, which in its original form\r\nhad been condemned, the title-page is to carry a wording similar to\r\nthe following: _Bibliotheca ... a Conrado Gesnero Tigurino, damnato\r\nauctores olim edita ac prohibita, nunc jussu superiorum expurgata et\r\npermissa_.\r\n\r\nA document, peculiar to this Index, is entitled _Observatio_. The\r\nfirst comment is upon the fourth rule and denies that by this rule\r\nany power is given to bishops, etc., to grant licenses to buy, read,\r\nor retain Bibles, or any parts or summaries of the Scriptures, in\r\nthe vulgar language. This Observation is continued in the succeeding\r\npapal Indexes up to that of Benedict XIV in 1756. In the later edition\r\nof the Index of Benedict, which appeared in 1758, the instruction or\r\ninterpretation given by the Observation is naturally modified. The\r\nthird division of the Observation revokes the partial toleration of the\r\nTalmudic and Cabalistic books, and the fourth forbids the circulation\r\nin any other than the original language of the Hebrew ritual called\r\n_Magazor_. The sixth enjoins in the matter of the prohibition of\r\nbooks, that the names of the works condemned should be delivered to\r\nthe bishops and inquisitors and that license to read them should be\r\nobtained for the same. The correction of books is to be committed to\r\nlearned and pious men and the circulation of the work where expurgated\r\nand amended to the satisfaction of the examiners is permitted. The\r\ncorrectors are to search for all utterances anti-Catholic or adverse to\r\nthe Church or in praise of heretics, as well as for such as are immoral\r\nor as may be injurious to individuals. Catholic books issued after the\r\nyear 1515 are, if objectionable, to be corrected, but the works of the\r\nancients are to be corrected only in case errors have been introduced\r\nby the fraud of heretics, etc.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in regard to the impression of books is as follows: The\r\nwork to be printed must first be shown to the bishop or inquisitor and\r\napproved by either of them; when printed, the text must be compared\r\nwith the manuscript and verified as correct before permission can be\r\ngiven for sale. Printers must be orthodox men and must bind themselves\r\nby oath to deal faithfully and catholicly, and the more learned and\r\neminent of them must profess the creed of Pius IV. A work that has been\r\nexpurgated by the examiners must express that fact on its title-page.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Clement is distinctive in giving a much larger measure\r\nof attention to theological works by Catholic writers than to the\r\nwritings of heretics. In this respect, it serves to mark a change of\r\npolicy on the part of the Church, which was beginning to recognise the\r\nimpracticability of controlling the character of the whole literary\r\noutput of the world, and to devote its supervision to the task of\r\nkeeping free from error books by Catholic writers which would be likely\r\nto influence the faith of believers. The Clementine Index secured for\r\nitself a wider distribution than had been given to any preceding Index\r\nexcepting that of Trent. Within two years after its promulgation,\r\neditions were printed at Bologna, Perugia, Florence, Milan, Verona,\r\nVenice, and Turin, and also at Prague, Lisbon, Liège, Cologne, Paris,\r\nand Besançon. The publishers and booksellers of Venice found occasion\r\nfor complaint concerning a number of the entries and regulations in\r\nthis Index, and the Venetian Senate submitted on their behalf a strong\r\nreclamation to the Pope. After a series of negotiations, the Pope gave\r\ninstructions for concession on the more important points at issue. In\r\n1596, was published an _Interpretation of the Rules of the Index\r\nof Clement VIII, in so far as these apply in the territory of ...\r\nVenice_. The more important modifications are the following:\r\n\r\n(1) The prohibited books and those for which expurgation has been\r\nordered can still be sold to those who have secured the necessary\r\npermission from bishop or inquisitor. (2) When new editions are\r\nprepared of volumes that have been prohibited _donec corrigatur_,\r\nit is not required to send the copies to Rome. These can be passed\r\nupon with the necessary corrections under the instructions of the\r\nlocal bishop and inquisitor. (3) The printers are not required to\r\nsubmit for examination the text in the form of printed sheets. The\r\nwork of examination and of correction can be completed with the text\r\nof the MSS. as prepared for the typesetters. (4) On the back of\r\nthe title are to be printed, in connection with the record of the\r\npermit or privilege, the names of the examiners who have approved the\r\ntext. (5) The booksellers are required to submit, on demand, to the\r\ninquisitor a catalogue of the books contained in their stock in order\r\nthat the bookshops may be “cleansed” from old copies of prohibited\r\nand pernicious works. (6) The authority given to local bishops and\r\ninquisitors to prohibit books in addition to those that have been\r\nplaced on the Index must be understood to apply exclusively to works\r\nopposing the true faith, and to volumes which have been brought into\r\nprint under false or forged permits. (7) The publishers and printers in\r\nthe territory of Venice are freed from the general requirement of an\r\nannual oath. (8) The heirs to an estate are under requirement, within\r\nthree months of the turning over of an inheritance, to submit to the\r\ninquisitor a list of all the books received; and these books are not to\r\nbe used until they have been passed upon and approved.\r\n\r\nThese concessions were accepted as satisfactory by the Senate, and\r\nauthorisation was then given for the printing and promulgation of the\r\nIndex in the territory of Venice. The influence of Paolo Sarpi in\r\nmaintaining for the Venetian Republic the right of independent action\r\nin regard to censorship, and in refusing to accept as authoritative\r\na regulation from Rome until it had been made to conform to Venetian\r\nrequirements, was evidently still in force. After this _Concordat_\r\nhad been arrived at, a resolution was adopted by the Senate (and\r\nappears to have been accepted by Rome) that thereafter no book\r\nprohibition should be valid in Venetian territory until it had been\r\npromulgated by the Venetian Inquisition.\r\n\r\nSarpi makes a criticism concerning Roman censorship methods which is in\r\nsubstance as follows:\r\n\r\n   “The Roman authorities prohibit, as corrupt, the text of many\r\n   valuable works, particularly of the class that have to do with\r\n   political science and the rights of States; they prohibit many\r\n   books which have no relation to matters of theology or religion\r\n   and which they are in fact not competent to understand; they\r\n   contest the right of the Republic itself to prohibit pernicious\r\n   books.”\r\n\r\nIn another passage Sarpi contends that the Roman _Index expurgatorius_\r\nis especially faulty: “In these so-called expurgated editions, the\r\nreader can no longer ascertain the purport of the author but has before\r\nhim simply the opinions of the Curia.”\r\n\r\n_3._ _Supplements to the Clementine Index, 1597–1609._ In the decrees\r\nof the half-century following the date of the publication of the Index\r\nof 1596, a number of books are separately prohibited the authors of\r\nwhich had already been placed in Class I. In a papal decree of 1623,\r\nit is declared that all works published, after 1596, by writers who\r\nhad already been condemned under Class I were prohibited. A number of\r\nbooks which had not been transferred by the editors of Clement from\r\nthe lists of Sixtus V were prohibited later, in part during Clement’s\r\nlife and in part by his successors. In the first decade of the 17th\r\ncentury, a number of individual prohibitions were made of books\r\nbelonging to the 16th century, and some of which had been in print\r\nfor a quarter of a century, or more. An example of such a belated\r\nprohibition is presented by the case of Bruno. Bruno’s earlier writings\r\nwere published in 1582, but his name does not occur in the Index of\r\nClement VIII. Bruno’s trial and condemnation took place in Rome, in\r\n1600, and first in 1603 does the list of works prohibited include the\r\nbooks and writings, of every class, of Giordani Bruno Nolani. Bruno\r\nwas born in 1548 at Nola and associated himself with the Dominicans.\r\nProceedings were taken against him as early as 1577 by the Inquisition\r\nboth at Naples and at Rome. He succeeded, however, in getting out of\r\nItaly and remained absent until 1592. In this year he came under trial\r\nwith the Inquisition in Venice and, in 1593, was delivered by the\r\nVenetian authorities to the Inquisition of Rome. He was in prison in\r\nRome until 1599, and in 1600 was condemned and burned as an apostate\r\nand an unrepentant and stubborn heretic. During the trial, Bellarmin\r\nserved as counsel for the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nAmong the works condemned in the first of these supplements, is the\r\ntreatise written by King James I of England in defence of his oath of\r\nfidelity or coronation oath. This _Apology_ of the King did not find\r\nfavour in Rome, and it was condemned by two successive decrees of the\r\nmaster of the sacred palace in July and in September of 1609, the year\r\nof its publication. The title of the condemned work begins: _Apologia\r\npro juramento fidelitatis ... vero ab ipso auctore serenissimo et\r\npotentissimo Principe Jacobo_, etc. The book did not find place in\r\nthe Spanish Index of 1612, but secured attention, as specified, on\r\nthe part of the censors of Portugal. The title appears again among\r\nthe works prohibited in the Spanish Index of 1632, under the title of\r\n_Jacobus Rex_ in the first class, and also in the second class under\r\nthe title of _Jacobus Angliae_. In the same year, the title finds place\r\nin a Roman Index, where it is catalogued under the letter _A_. The\r\ncondemnation is repeated on the Index of 1664 and in those following.\r\nIn an examination held by the Parliamentary Committee on the State of\r\nIreland in April, 1825, one of the Catholic witnesses, the Reverend M.\r\nO’Sullivan, deduces from these condemnations the conclusion that the\r\nold-time papal doctrine of the fight of deposing Kings had not been\r\nrevoked.[172]\r\n\r\nIn 1609, was included in the lists of books prohibited an Italian\r\nedition of the _Confession_ of Theodore Beza. The book had been printed\r\nin 1559 in the original French, _Confession de la Foire Chrétienne_,\r\nand the Italian version had appeared in 1566. Nearly half a century was\r\nrequired before the pernicious character of the work had become clear\r\nto the authorities of the Roman Inquisition.\r\n\r\n_4._ _Continuations of Roman Indexes, 1624–1655._ The Index of Clement\r\nVIII was reprinted from time to time with the original decrees and with\r\nsupplementary lists. Such reprints were issued in Rome in 1624, 1630,\r\nand 1640.\r\n\r\nIn 1618, was printed in Bologna, under the title of _Syllabus seu\r\ncollectis librorum prohibitorum_, a list of the books prohibited since\r\n1596. In 1619, Franciscus Magdalenus, Secretary of the Congregation,\r\nprinted in Rome, under the title, _Edictum librorum qui post Indicem\r\nClementis VIII prohibiti sunt_, a reissue of the Bologna _Syllabus_. In\r\n1624, these lists were reissued in Milan, under the title of _Raccolta\r\nde libri prohibiti_.\r\n\r\nIn 1632, Magdalenus issued in Rome, under the title, _Elenchus librorum\r\nomnium tum in Tridentino Clementinoq. tum in aliis omnibus Sacrae\r\nIndices Congregationis particularibus decretis hactenus prohibitorum_,\r\nwhat appears to have been a freshly compiled Index. This _Elenchus_ of\r\nMagdalenus was, in the same year, reprinted in Milan, with the omission\r\nof the series of decrees; and in 1640, a second reprint, containing\r\nadditional lists, was issued in Rome. Mendham speaks of this _Elenchus_\r\nas if it were a personal and unofficial undertaking[173]; but as Reusch\r\npoints out, it was issued with the approval and the authority of the\r\nCongregation, although not printed in the official press.\r\n\r\nIn 1644, a second _Elenchus_ was printed in Rome, bearing no name\r\nof compiler or of printer, which presented in alphabetical order a list\r\nof books prohibited since 1596.\r\n\r\nIn 1655, a third _Elenchus_, bearing the name, as compiler, of Thomas\r\nde Augustinis, was printed in Rome. It contains the titles of books\r\nprohibited between 1636 and 1655, and constitutes a continuation of the\r\n_Elenchus_ of 1632. In June, 1658, this _Elenchus_ was itself condemned\r\nand prohibited by the Congregation, on the ground of its incompleteness\r\nand lack of accuracy.[174] It is evident that the Congregation Index\r\nauthorities were requiring a higher standard of bibliographical work\r\nthan had heretofore been thought necessary.\r\n\r\nIn 1629, the Inquisition issued in Cologne a reprint of the Index of\r\nClement VIII with the titles of books prohibited under the edict of\r\nFebruary, 1627, interpolated in the alphabeted lists and indicated by\r\na †. The books prohibited (by edict) between the years 1601–1627 are\r\nnot included, and the lists are therefore incomplete. The Index thus\r\ncompiled was, however, reprinted, without corrections, in 1647 and\r\nagain in 1665.\r\n\r\nIn 1634, was put into print in Trent an edition of the Clementine\r\nIndex which includes two supplements (each under separate pagination)\r\npresenting respectively the titles of prohibited books and the\r\nedicts of condemnation, for the periods 1601–1630 and 1632–1634. The\r\ntitle-page contains the imprint Rome and Trent, in order to make\r\nclear the authoritative character of the publication. Later, further\r\nsupplementary lists were put into print to be bound in with the above.\r\nThe lists or Indexes above specified represent the prohibitions of the\r\nRoman authorities.\r\n\r\nIn 1603, was published in Cracow, under the authority of Bishop\r\nMaciciowski, a volume containing a reprint of the Clementine Index,\r\ntogether with an _Index auctorum et librorum prohibitorum in Polonia\r\neditorum_. This latter contains sixty-four titles connected with the\r\nnames of authors and eighteen anonymous works.\r\n\r\nIn 1617, Bishop Szyskowski published, in Cracow, an _Index auctorum\r\nlibrorum haereticorum et prohibitorum_, containing about sixty-three\r\ntitles. These Polish Indexes represent books condemned under the\r\nauthority of the local bishops.\r\n\r\nIn 1627, Thomas James issued in Oxford an _Index Generalis_, which\r\nhe had compiled from the Indexes of Clement VIII and of von Sandoval.\r\nAt the close of the volume is given a list of authors whose works had\r\nbeen listed for expurgation by Brasichelli, Quiroga, von Sandoval, and\r\nin the Index of Antwerp. This compilation of James is of course not to\r\nbe included in the series of Indexes properly so called. Its purpose\r\nwas in fact to commend to the attention of scholarly readers in Oxford\r\nand elsewhere the books which had been emphasised by the Church of Rome\r\nas heretical and pernicious.\r\n\r\nFuller specification of this noteworthy undertaking of James is given\r\nin a later chapter.\r\n\r\n_5._ _1607._ _Brasichelli, Master of the Palace._ _Index\r\nExpurgatorius.--Indices librorum expurgandorum in studiosorum gratiam\r\nconfecti. Tomus primus. In quo quinquaginta Auctorum Libri prae\r\ncaeteris desiderati emendantur, per F. Jo. Maria Brasichellen Sacri\r\nPalatii Apostolici Magistrum in unum corpus redactus, et publicae\r\ncommoditati aeditus Romae ex typographia R. Cam. Apost. MDCVII\r\nsuperiorum permissu._\r\n\r\nThis is the second _Index expurgatorius_ in the Roman series. The\r\ncompiler was the Dominican Guanzelli, from Brisighella near Faenza.\r\nHe calls himself on the title-page. Fr. Jo. Maria Brasichelli. He\r\nhad, since 1598, been the _Magister_ of the palace. Shortly after\r\nthe publication of his Index, he was appointed by Paul V, Bishop\r\nof Polignani. He died in 1619, leaving his Index a fragment, only\r\nthe first volume having been completed. This volume was printed in\r\nthe printing-office of the Curia. A reprint appeared in Bergamo in\r\n1608, which was within a year or two suppressed. A reprint was in\r\npress at Antwerp, but was suppressed. Further reprints appeared\r\nin Regensburg in 1723, in Altdorf in 1745, and in London in 1837.\r\nEven the reprints are very scarce. A copy of the original issue is\r\ncontained in the Bodleian. The compiler says in his preface that the\r\nexpurgation of books belongs to the responsibility of his office, and\r\nthat he has, therefore, charged himself with the task of examining\r\ncertain books which have been condemned _donec corrigatur_, and has\r\ndone what was requisite, through the elimination of pernicious and\r\nheretical passages, to render these works available for the use of\r\nscholars and students. The number of such books is unfortunately very\r\nlarge, and he has, therefore, selected for his labours those which\r\nwhen properly corrected are likely to prove of the greatest service\r\nfor the scholarly public, _quosque sibi e manibus extorqueri gravius\r\nferre homines animadvertimus et quorum ut permitteretur facultas pene\r\nquotidie a nobis efflagitabatur_.... The texts which were issued with\r\nthe corrections specified in his Index have been transferred from the\r\nclass of condemned to that of approved books.... His second volume is,\r\nhe reports, already in train.\r\n\r\nThe preface is followed by a reprint of the Trent Rules bearing upon\r\nexpurgation, and by the second division of the Instruction of Clement\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the first volume of Brasichelli’s work brought out a\r\nseries of remonstrances and criticisms which caused the rulers of\r\nthe Church to decide that the publication of expurgatory Indexes was\r\nan unwise policy. Such Indexes were also, in the judgment of the\r\nadvisers of the Curia, not necessary as the instruction in the General\r\nIndex last issued had given to the agents appointed for the purpose,\r\nfull power of making quietly and with freedom from criticism such\r\ncorrections and expurgation as seemed to be required in books the main\r\ntext of which was deserving of preservation. With an expurgatory Index,\r\nthis difficult work had to be done openly and with an acceptance of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Index presents, in alphabetical arrangement, fifty-one works. The\r\nlist includes four which were not in the Index of 1596, but which had\r\nbeen condemned in two edicts of the _Magister_ of 1603 and 1605,\r\nand three books of the Benedictine Montanus (the editor of the Polyglot\r\nBible issued in Antwerp by Plantin) which had never been condemned in\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nCertain of the books selected, such as the writings of Molinaeus,\r\nVenetus, and Nevizanus, had already been expurgated. Other authors\r\nreceiving attention are Cornarius and Fuchsius. Editions of Xenophon\r\nare purged by the cancellation of the names of heretical editors, such\r\nas Gesner, Pirckheimer, and Camerarius. These particular expurgations\r\nare borrowed from the Antwerp Index of Quiroga and the same is the\r\ncase with the corrections in the text of Polydorus Vergilius and\r\nof Didaeus Stella. The list includes further: Rhenanus, Vatablus,\r\nParacelsus, Serranus (for his edition of Plato), and Scaliger (for his\r\nTheophrastus).\r\n\r\nThis Index of Brasichelli cannot be considered as a personal\r\nundertaking, as the compiler states explicitly that his work has been\r\ncarried out by him in his official capacity. It appears, however, that\r\nhe had secured no specific instruction or authorisation, either from\r\nthe pope or from the Congregation, as, if such authority had been\r\ngiven, the record of it would undoubtedly have been printed in the\r\nvolume. On the other hand, if the undertaking of Brasichelli had been\r\ndisapproved by the pope, he would hardly have secured his appointment\r\nas bishop and there would probably have been some formal cancellation\r\nof the Index. In place however of being formally withdrawn, the Index\r\nappears to have been quietly suppressed, probably on the ground that\r\nit could bring no credit to the Church. The second volume was never\r\ncompleted. The most important piece of censorship contained in the\r\nIndex, the expurgation of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_, aroused no little\r\ncritical opposition on the part of the scholars. It was apparently\r\nundertaken without adequate knowledge or scholarship.\r\n\r\nThe first name in the list of expurgated authors is that of Arias\r\nMontanus. Montanus had himself borne the chief responsibility in the\r\nproduction of the Index issued in Antwerp in 1546. He had been accepted\r\nas an authority not only for sound scholarship, but for sound doctrine.\r\nAbout six pages of the Roman Index are devoted to his writings, which\r\nhere suffer a castigation and mutilation similar to that formerly\r\ninflicted by him on other authors.\r\n\r\nSpace is given (as in all the expurgatory Indexes) to the Bibles of\r\nRobert Estienne. The longest and most important article in the volume\r\nis that devoted to the _Bibliotheca SS. Patrum_ of La Bigne printed in\r\nParis in 1589. As an example of the class of correction found necessary\r\nin the _Bibliotheca_ may be noted the correction of cancellation of\r\n_Sanctus_ or _Sanctorum_ or _S. Divus_ or _D._ whenever such term is\r\napplied to a personage not in the list of Roman saints or of Roman\r\nmartyrs. The words _Caute lege_ appear frequently in connection with\r\nthe text of La Bigne. On page 82, Clemens of Alexandria is degraded\r\nfrom the rank of _Divus_. In the critique upon S. Peter Martyr, Bishop\r\nof Alexandria, the censor denounces his commentator, Balsamon, as “a\r\nGreek and a schismatic.” S. Chromatius is censored as condemning oaths\r\naltogether. S. Ignatius is censored for his opinions respecting the\r\nLord’s Day. Leontius is censored for omitting the apocryphal books\r\nin the canon. La Bigne is censored for ascribing the work _De Duabus\r\nNaturis_ to Gelasius who became Pope. Jonas Aurelianensis is censored\r\nfor his testimony against image worship. Marcus the hermit is censored\r\nfor contending that the kingdom of heaven is not given as a reward\r\nfor our good works. For Paschasius the title of _Divus_ is ordered\r\nto be expunged. He is further censored for describing as creation\r\nthe change of the elements. Photius, Bishop of Constantinople, is\r\ncondemned (very naturally) for representing his own see as the head\r\nof all the churches. To the Spanish author, Emmanuel Sa, is given a\r\ndiscipline or censorship covering twenty-eight pages. In the next\r\nsucceeding Spanish Index, Sa is acquitted of any false or erroneous\r\ndoctrine and his writings are held up to special approbation. It was\r\nwith the Roman criticism of Sa that originated a long series of issues\r\nbetween the Index makers of Rome and those of Spain. Francis Duarenus\r\nreceived a castigation, which he might fairly have expected, for his\r\nwork _Pro libertate Ecclesiae Gallicae_, in section 77 of which are\r\ndetailed the heavy exactions of the Papal See. Cardanus is condemned\r\nfor his _Eulogy_ of Edward VI. A condemnation is also brought in upon\r\nQueen Elizabeth, the text for the same being a dedication to the Queen\r\nprefixed to a London edition of _Plato_.\r\n\r\nPolydorus Virgilius is subject to correction for his work _De Rerum\r\nInventoribus_. Among the passages cited for reprobation are those\r\nassigning (on the authority of Bishop Fisher of Rochester) a very\r\nrecent origin to the doctrine of indulgences, with the suggestion that\r\nthe discovery of purgatory was a powerful cause for the demand for\r\nindulgences. The censors also condemned the reference by Virgilius to\r\nthe second commandment as involving a criticism of the action of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nA reference to the Brasichelli Index is made by Paolo Sarpi.[175] He\r\nfinds in it evidence that in a large number of the writings in which\r\nexpurgation or alterations had been found necessary, the passages\r\nobjected to were those which defended the authority given by God to\r\nthe prince. Zobelius, in his _Notitia Indicis_, states that\r\nBrasichelli was aided in his work by Thomas Malvenda, a Dominican.\r\n\r\nIn 1611, an edition of the Brasichelli Index was printed in Antwerp. A\r\nyear later, the Nuncio writes to the printer-publisher: “By the orders\r\nof his Holiness, this Index has been suspended. As some months back\r\nI placed in your hands, for printing, a copy of the original issue,\r\nit is necessary for me now to write asking that you will not proceed\r\nwith this printing, or, in case the edition is already issued, that\r\nyou will take the necessary measures to recall and cancel the copies.”\r\nIt does not appear that the Nuncio expressed any readiness to make\r\ngood to the publisher the outlay that the latter had incurred with the\r\npermission, and in fact at the request, of the representative of the\r\npope. Mendham is of opinion that the Brasichelli Index itself found\r\nplace among the books later condemned by the pope;[176] and in this\r\nopinion he is supported by Zobel. Reusch takes the ground that this\r\nIndex had never been formally prohibited. He points out that the\r\nword _suspendere_, used by the Nuncio, is the equivalent of a\r\ncondemnation _donec corrigatur_.[177] It appears that there was\r\nlater (1643) the intention in Rome to prepare an expurgated edition of\r\nthis _Index expurgatorius_, but this plan never took shape.\r\n\r\nBrasichelli had excited the antagonism of the Carmelites, because, in\r\nhis correction of the eighth volume of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_,\r\nhe had denied the claim to saintship of Bishop John of Jerusalem\r\n(a contemporary of Jerome), and had also denied that Bishop John\r\nwas responsible for the production of the volume _De Institutione\r\nMonachi_. The anonymous author of this book describes himself as a\r\nCarmelite, and gives the record of the institution of the Carmelite\r\nOrder; but Brasichelli is of opinion that in the 5th century there were\r\nas yet no Carmelites.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits, such as Reynaud, Poza and others, and the Spanish\r\necclesiastics generally, were much dissatisfied with the expurgation of\r\nthe text of their author, Sa. In the later Spanish expurgatory Indexes,\r\nwhile certain of the works corrected by Brasichelli were retained, the\r\nexpurgations of the texts were very much modified and lessened.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the expurgation of the _Bibliotheca Patrum_, a\r\nquestion arose, concerning which there was later no little discussion,\r\nas to whether it was in order to place in the Indexes, prohibitory or\r\nexpurgatory, the writings of the Fathers of the Church. In the later\r\nRoman Indexes, including that compiled under the authority of Pius IX,\r\nthe _Bibliotheca_ (under the name of the editor, La Bigne) is\r\nstill included, without reference to the edition, under the heading\r\n_d. c._ Reusch finds instance of but one actual prohibition of\r\npatristic writings. The other references to these writings in the\r\nIndex have to do with the comments, notes, or alleged interpolations\r\nof heretical editors. The Instruction of Clement VIII takes the ground\r\nthat no alterations are to be made in the text of the works of Catholic\r\nwriters produced before 1515, unless there is evidence that corruptions\r\nhave crept into the text through the work of heretical editors, or\r\nthrough the carelessness of the printers.\r\n\r\nThe question has from time to time been raised by Protestant writers\r\nwhether the Catholic editors of the patristic writings put into print\r\nin the 16th century had not, under the instructions or with the\r\nknowledge of the authorities who had given their approval to these\r\neditions, corrupted the original text for the support of certain\r\ndoctrines or contentions.[178] It is not surprising that such a\r\nbelief should have obtained, in connection with the readiness of many\r\ntheologians of the 16th century to take the ground that passages of\r\nthe Fathers which could not be made to fit in with their own doctrinal\r\nviews must represent interpolations or corruptions on the part of\r\nthe scribes, or of the editors or printers of the earlier editions.\r\nFranciscus Junius relates that a reader for the Lyons printer,\r\nFrelonius, had shown to him a proof sheet of an edition of St. Ambrose\r\non which the censors, two Franciscans, had made material changes from\r\nthe text of the manuscript copy.[179]\r\n\r\nMendham suggests, in connection with the expurgations of Brasichelli,\r\nas the secret of pontifical logic that to say of a thing _non ipsa\r\nvera_ and _quodammodo_ enables you to turn the most obstinate\r\nsubstance and propositions into direct opposites.\r\n\r\nThe use for faithful Catholics of available editions of the Fathers had\r\nbeen seriously interfered with by the regulations of the Index of 1559,\r\nand even by the modifications of these in 1561. Hosius writes in 1565\r\nto Cardinal Amulius[180] complaining that before Pius V the writings of\r\nthe Fathers had been brought into print not in Rome or other Catholic\r\ncities, but chiefly in centres of heresy like Basel where the editors\r\ncorrupted the original text. He had tried to make purchase in Rome of\r\nthe works of Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory, but had been told\r\nby the booksellers that the only available editions were prohibited.\r\nSuch a complaint may be taken as an indication of the greater scholarly\r\nenterprise and intellectual activity of the communities which had been\r\ninfluenced by Protestantism.\r\n\r\nThe title-page of an edition of Augustine, printed in Venice in 1570,\r\ncontains a notice that the text has been carefully revised and freed\r\nfrom all the corruptions and _scholia_ introduced into the\r\nprevious editions by Erasmus and other heretical and condemned writers.\r\nThomas James[181] points out that the edition of Gregory the Great\r\nprinted in Rome in 1585 contains no less than 1085 passages in which\r\nthe text varies from that of the authoritative manuscripts. Calandrini\r\nspeaks of 13,000 such variations. Reusch is, however, of opinion that\r\nthese charges of corruptions in Roman editions are exaggerated.[182]\r\n\r\n_6._ _Expurgations in the Roman Index, 1624–1640._ The Roman Indexes,\r\nwith the exceptions of that of Brasichelli and the suppressed Index of\r\nSixtus, are classed as prohibitory only. It is the case, however, in\r\ncertain instances that in place of the term _donec corrigatur_ (usually\r\nindicated simply by the letters _d. c._) is given a paragraph in which\r\nis specified the material that is to be omitted and the omission of\r\nwhich will leave the book in the list of those permitted. Such a\r\nparagraph is, for instance, connected in several of the Roman Indexes\r\nwith the name Copernicus. Occasionally is connected with the entry of\r\nthe title and the letters _d. c._ a reference to an expurgated edition\r\npublished under the authority of the Congregation, the reading of which\r\nis permitted. Among authors whose works the value of which is in this\r\nway emphasised are Natalis, Bottero, Florentini, Garafalo, Scaramelli,\r\netc. In the case of certain other authors (nearly exclusively Italians)\r\nthe editors have taken the pains to specify in the Index itself the\r\nground for the prohibition.[183]\r\n\r\n_7._ _1624–1661._ _Rome._ _Censorship Decrees._\r\n\r\n_Index librorum post indicem Clementis VIII prohibitorum decreta\r\nomnia hactenus edita._\r\n\r\n_Romae, ex typographia Rev. Cam. Apost. MDCXXIV._\r\n\r\nEach decree, emanating from the different authorities, is here given\r\nseparately and at length, thus presenting a convenient summary of the\r\nsources from which originate the prohibitions and criticisms in the\r\nIndexes. The series comprises edicts of the Inquisition, edicts of the\r\nCongregation of the Index, edicts of the master of the sacred palace,\r\nand decrees of the pope, and extends from the year 1601 to 1629. The\r\nIndex with which the series of edicts is printed as a sequel bears\r\ndate 1632. In a second edition, issued in 1640, the series of edicts\r\nis brought down to 1637. The master of the sacred palace, whose name\r\nappears in the first decrees issued by that official, was Brasichelli,\r\nwhose abortive _Index expurgatorius_ has already been referred to.\r\nFour of the decrees issued by his successor, Lud. Ystella, in the years\r\n1609 and 1610, were the subjects of severe animadversion on the part of\r\nFra Paolo Sarpi of Venice.\r\n\r\nIn the _Discorso_ concerning the Inquisition at Venice, printed\r\nin 1638, Sarpi complains of an attempt on the part of the Papacy to\r\nundermine and to violate the Concordat instituted in 1596 between\r\nRome and the Venetian Republic. In the Concordat, it is stipulated\r\nthat no other Index than the Clementine is to have force in Venice.\r\nIn the two decrees in question it is declared that the Indexes and\r\nseparate decrees issued since 1596 are to be “in force in all cities,\r\nterritories, and places, of whatsoever kingdom, nation, and people, and\r\nare to have authority, in whatsoever way, even without publication, the\r\nedicts should be made known.” Such a claim on the part of the Papacy\r\ncertainly appears to constitute an attempt to invalidate the conditions\r\nof the Concordat and to give grounds for the criticisms of the intrepid\r\ndefender of the independence of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe 66th decree (1644) is directed against the _Lettres Provinciales_\r\nof Pascal; and makes a separate condemnation of each of the eighteen\r\nletters. This author ought certainly to have remained in favour with\r\nthe Church. In number seventeen of these _Lettres Provinciales_ he\r\nexpresses himself thus: _Grâce à Dieu, je n’ai d’attaches sur la\r\nterre qu’à la seule Église Catholique, Apostolique et Romaine, dans\r\nlaquelle je veux vivre et mourir, et dans la communion avec la Pape\r\nson souverain chef, hors de laquelle je suis très persuadé qu’il n’y a\r\npoint de salut_. It would appear, however, as if some wave of Jesuitism\r\nmust have influenced Pope Innocent X at the time this condemnation was\r\nissued. It may easily be understood that from the point of view of the\r\nJesuits, Pascal could hardly be considered a good Churchman.\r\n\r\nDecree number seventy-seven, issued by Pope Alexander VII, January\r\n12, 1661, states that some sons of perdition had arrived at such a\r\ncondition of madness as to turn the Roman missal into the vulgar tongue\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n          INDEXES AND PROHIBITIONS, SPANISH, ROMAN, BELGIAN,\r\n                   POLISH, AND PORTUGUESE 1612–1768\r\n\r\n    1612.

The inquisitor-general\r\nunder whose authority it was compiled and issued was at the time both\r\nCardinal and Archbishop of Toledo. The title-page bears, in addition to\r\nthe name of the Spanish primate, the line _de consilio Supremi Senatus\r\nStae. Generalis Inquisitionis Hispaniarum_. The volume is one of\r\nconsiderable compass; as printed in the first Madrid issue, it contains\r\n744 pages, five of which are not folioed.\r\n\r\nIn 1614, an appendix with additional lists was printed as a separate\r\nvolume. This is called _Appendix prima_, but no later appendices\r\ncame into print. In 1619, the Index was reprinted in Geneva in an\r\nedition which included, with the appendix, a polemical introduction\r\nby Benedict Turretini. In 1628, this Geneva edition was reprinted in\r\nPalermo under the instructions of the Inquisitor-General, Zapata. The\r\nIndex is prefaced by a brief of Paul V, the text of which follows the\r\nlines of that contributed in 1559 by Paul IV to the Index of Valdes.\r\nThe Pope says (in substance) that he had learned that the permissions\r\nin existence in the Spanish realm for the reading of prohibited books\r\nhad grown to be too numerous and that the results were pernicious. All\r\nsuch permissions, whether emanating from the popes, from the local\r\nbishops, or from any other authorities, were now cancelled, with\r\nthe exception of such permissions as might be given by the present\r\ninquisitor-general to the devout scholars to whom had been confided\r\nthe task of the preparation of the present work. The penalty for\r\ndisobedience of this general prohibition was the _excommunicatio\r\nlatae sententiae_. Then follows an edict of the inquisitor-general\r\nin which he states that the work has been undertaken by him under the\r\ngeneral Apostolic authority that he possesses as inquisitor-general\r\nin the Spanish realms; and under the special instructions given to\r\nhim in the papal brief. The penalties specified in the regulations\r\nare incurred by all persons who possess or who read copies of the\r\nprohibited books. The penalties are not incurred in connection with\r\nbooks entered under Class II, concerning which the censors give simply\r\na caution. Copies of such books are however to be submitted to the\r\nauthorities (in Spain usually the local inquisitors) in order that the\r\nnature of the caution or correction may be duly specified.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen rules (based upon the Ten Rules of Trent) follow pretty\r\nclosely the text of the Rules of Quiroga. Rule X presents a general\r\nprohibition of all anonymous books and of all books not bearing the\r\nname of the printer, which have been issued since 1584.\r\n\r\nSandoval’s editors follow the Roman model in placing their lists under\r\nthree classes. Works which, condemned in their original form, are to\r\nbe permitted after an expurgation, are specified in the original list\r\nwith a star, and the titles are repeated in the second division, the\r\n_Index expurgatorius_.\r\n\r\nThe second and third classes present in separate alphabets the\r\ntitles of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Flemish, and German\r\npublications. In Class I, the only Spanish names are Constantino de la\r\nFuente and Joan Auentrote. In this class is placed also Erasmus, with\r\nthe memorandum that all of his writings are prohibited as printed in\r\nthe vernacular. A similar specification is made in connection with the\r\nnames, given in the same class, of Petrus Ramus and of Macchiavelli.\r\n\r\nThe chief editor of the Index presents, after the classified lists, a\r\n“notice to the reader” in which he says:\r\n\r\n   “The writings of authors who have been condemned, in so far\r\n   as these do not have to do with matters of religion, can be\r\n   made available for the use of the faithful through a thorough\r\n   expurgation. Even in the writings of orthodox scholars, whose\r\n   zeal and service in behalf of the Catholic religion deserve the\r\n   highest praise, are to be found certain errors of statement\r\n   and expressions liable to misconstruction, which, if left\r\n   uncorrected, would be likely to work mischief. In other cases,\r\n   writings of Christian authors, whose work was well-suited for\r\n   the time and the special conditions under which they wrote,\r\n   have in these later times come into controversy. The result of\r\n   their consideration by the scholars of later date has been to\r\n   show the necessity of some revision or reshaping of the earlier\r\n   text, in order to prevent these works of repute from exerting\r\n   an evil influence on later generations.” “The compilers of this\r\n   Index have undertaken the expurgation of more than three hundred\r\n   works, among which are included certain books that have secured\r\n   a very wide circulation. Certain further important expurgations\r\n   are in train, and in collaborating in such work, devout scholars\r\n   can be of noteworthy service to the Inquisition.”\r\n\r\nThis _Index prohibitorius_ contains practically all the titles that\r\nwere given in the Index of Clement VIII, and such further titles as\r\nwere compiled by Quiroga. It includes further a number of the later\r\nprohibitions. Class I, in particular, has been very largely added to,\r\nthe new names, chiefly German, aggregating nearly three hundred. The\r\nlist includes a number of insignificant authors whose writings have\r\nbeen entirely lost sight of. In the expurgated texts, Sandoval utilised\r\nto some extent the work of Brasichelli. The appendix presents an edict\r\ndated August, 1614, certain modifications of the rules, additional\r\ntitles for the preliminary lists, and a series of expurgated texts.\r\n\r\nSchneemann[184] points out that this Index of Sandoval was utilised by\r\nthe Dominicans, under the lead of Bañez, to bring into condemnation\r\na number of the books of the Molinists, including the works of\r\nthe Jesuit Molina himself. The Benedictine Curiel writes to the\r\ninquisitor-general to point out that this use of the Index by Bañez\r\nand his associate Summel was the result of a disgraceful intrigue\r\nagainst Molina. Bañez had secured, in 1593, from the Inquisition,\r\nan instruction to the Universities of Alcala and Salamanca for the\r\nproduction of an Index, but, probably on account of the protest above\r\nreferred to, the work was never completed.\r\n\r\nSandoval’s editors evidently had before them the text of the Roman\r\ndecrees of 1603, but they appear to have made a rather arbitrary\r\nselection of the authors the condemnation of whom they were prepared\r\nto confirm. Among the better known names omitted from the Spanish\r\nlists are Bruno, James I, William Barclay, and Roger Widdington. In\r\nthe Palermo reprint of the Sandoval Index are added the titles of\r\ncertain Sicilian authors. There is also included a specification that\r\nreferences to Pope Joan must be cancelled from any volumes in which\r\nthey occur.\r\n\r\nThe following entries may be cited from the two lists:\r\n\r\n_Gregorii Capuc. Enchirid. Eccles_: this stands for the Neapolitan\r\nIndex in which the suggestion had been printed that the Spanish _Index\r\nexpurgatorius_ might be a forgery. Henricus Stephanus and Johannus\r\nScapula find place, the former as usual for his issues of Bibles, and\r\nthe latter for some treatise not clearly specified. For the works of J.\r\nA. Thuanus or de Thou, the entry states that the censure of the present\r\nIndex covers only the first eighty books of the history. It is not\r\nclear whether the last fifty-eight books contained nothing to condemn\r\nor simply had not been reached. Isaac Casaubon is reprobated at some\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nEmmanuel Sa, freely censured by the Roman Index is here very lightly\r\ncorrected and excused. As previously pointed out, the conclusions of\r\nthe Spanish and Roman Indexes often clash and the framers of the former\r\nare reprimanded by the writers of Rome for their presumption.[185]\r\nUnder Cajaten, are cited two sentences (taken from a work by an\r\northodox Catholic, printed at Antwerp) which have been, according to\r\nMendham, altered to a directly opposite meaning. Mendham gives as\r\nexample of his statement the change of the word _mali_ into _divini_\r\nand of _impia_ into _sancta_. The works of Athanasius are considered\r\nin no less than three editions and large changes and “expurgations”\r\nare made in the annotations. Examples of the “cancellations” are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_Adorari solius Dei esse._\r\n\r\n_Imagines tollendas esse testimonia._\r\n\r\n_Angeli non sunt adorandi._\r\n\r\n_Justificatio fit per fidem._\r\n\r\n_Contra meritum humanum pro gratia, abundanter disputatum._\r\n\r\n_Sancti non sunt adorandi, non sunt invocandi._\r\n\r\n_Scriptura sacra sufficit ad veritatem._\r\n\r\n_Canonici libri soli legendi, et cur?_\r\n\r\n_Canonici libri soli sunt fontes salutares._\r\n\r\n_Gratia Christi nos salvat per fidem, non per bona opera._[186]\r\n\r\nThe text of S. Augustine is also handled at length. Among the\r\npropositions condemned and cancelled is: _Quae de carne sua\r\nmanducanda Christus proposuit, spiritualiter sunt intelligenda_.\r\nErasmus receives the largest measure of attention, no less than eighty\r\npages being devoted to the condemnation of reprehensible passages.\r\nThe expurgators protest particularly at the contentions maintained by\r\nErasmus against the worship of saints, images, or creatures.\r\n\r\nIn St. Chrysostom, passages are condemned which assert that, (a) sins\r\nare to be confessed to God, not to man; (b) that faith alone justifies;\r\n(c) that grace is excluded if we are saved by works; (d) that images\r\nare not to be adored; (e) that nothing is to be asserted without the\r\nauthority of Scripture, which is to be read by all and which, to all\r\nwho are willing to learn, is intelligible; (f) that after this life\r\nnothing can assist or deliver.\r\n\r\nThe _Theatrum Vitae Humanae_, compiled by Theodore Zwinger, receives\r\nas much analysis as is permitted by the space at the command of the\r\nexpurgators. The work itself is comprised in no less than twenty-nine\r\noctavo volumes. The reference to it being with a note worded as\r\nfollows: “Since this work is in a great degree collected from the\r\nwritings of condemned authors, it is to be read with special caution.\r\nThe names of these authors are never to be cited or referred to\r\nhonourably; and, to guard against error in the case of any author of\r\nwhose condemnation the reader may have doubts, he must have recourse to\r\nthe schedule of the first class.”\r\n\r\nZwinger has found occasion in his list of popes to use for not a few,\r\ndescriptive epithets that are by no means honourable. Mendham remarks\r\nthat “no attainment of vice, and not even the taint of heresy has been\r\nconsidered by the authorities of the Church to be of force sufficient\r\nto bar the claim of the popes to doctrinal infallibility in matters of\r\nfaith and of morals.”[187]\r\n\r\nThe faithful student who might desire to utilise this expurgatory\r\nIndex as a guide for his own reading, or who might think it important\r\nto verify the accuracy of the citations condemned as heretical, would\r\nfind difficulty in tracing these citations, as the expurgators have\r\nnot thought it desirable in a single instance to specify the page or\r\neven the volume from which the alleged extract has been made. The\r\nopportunity thus given for attributing heretical opinions to one author\r\nor another is obvious. An article in the _Protestant Guardian_[188]\r\ngives, as an example of the methods of these Madrid expurgators,\r\nquotations from the corrections made in a treatise by Hernando de\r\nSantiago, _Consideraciones sobre los Evangelios de la Quaresme_: “not\r\nAbimelech, you mean Melchizedech; and where you speak of Pelagians you\r\ncertainly should say Socinians; books of chivalry should of course read\r\nbooks of the Maccabees; on page 149, Persia should read Assyria, Anna,\r\nthe sister of Moses, is evidently an error for Miriam, while Tamar\r\nshould be changed to Dinah.”\r\n\r\nA reprint was issued in Geneva, in 1619, by Turretin, professor of\r\ndivinity. The editor places on his title-page the following lines:\r\n\r\n    _Indices huic libro nomen praefigitur apte;\r\n    Nam proprio Sorices Indicis pereunt._\r\n\r\nThe allusion is to a line in Terence, _Eunuch._, Act V, scene 7,\r\n_Egomet meo indicio, miser, quasi sorex, hodie perii_.[189]\r\n\r\n_2._ _1617._ _Cracow Index Prohibitorius._--_Index Librorum\r\nProhibitorum; cum regulis et cum adjecta instructione de emendandis\r\nimprimendisque libris et de exequenda prohibitione. Nunc in hac\r\neditione congregationis cardinalium edictis aliquot, et librorum nuper\r\nscandalose evulgatorum descriptione auctus. Cracoviae. 1617._ This\r\nwas issued under the instructions of Szykowski, Bishop of Cracow.\r\nThere had, it seems, been two previous editions, one initiated by\r\nMacierowski, Bishop of Cracow, the other by Zamoyski, Bishop of\r\nChelmin. The above title is taken from Peignot.\r\n\r\n_3._ _1624._ _Lisbon._ _The Inquisition._ _Prohibitorius et\r\nExpurgatorius._\r\n\r\nThis Index, issued in July, 1624, under the authority of the\r\nInquisitor-General, Fernando Martius Mascarenhan, bears as its main\r\ntitle the wording _Index auctorum damnatae memoriae, tum etiam\r\nlibrorum, qui vel simpliciter, vel ad expurgationem usque prohibentur,\r\nvel denique jam expurgatae permittentur_. As indicated by this\r\ntitle, the Index is expurgatory as well as prohibitory. Part I presents\r\nthe lists of books prohibited in the Roman Indexes and decrees up to\r\nthe year 1610. The three classes are merged under a single alphabet.\r\nPart II presents an _Index prohibitorius Lusitaniae_, in which\r\nare summarised, under one alphabet for each language considered,\r\nthe several lists of the Portuguese prohibitions. These Portuguese\r\nprohibitions follow very closely the lists of Sandoval. The rules,\r\nbased in substance upon the Ten of Trent, are here expanded into\r\nfifteen.\r\n\r\nThe material in the expurgatory section is in larger part transcribed\r\nfrom Sandoval. The Index of Trent had been printed in Portugal in 1581,\r\nand that of Clement in 1597. The Portuguese historian Seabra takes the\r\nground that, under Philip IV, no Index could be published without the\r\nauthority of the King. Philip had, in Portugal as in Spain, maintained\r\na certain personal supervision of the censorship operations of the\r\nInquisition. Reusch is of opinion that any reprints of the Roman\r\nIndexes must have secured the approval of the King. In 1623, the King\r\nissued an order prohibiting the reprinting, without the authority of\r\nthe chamberlain of the palace, of any book which had originated outside\r\nof Portugal. In 1633, this order was renewed, with the specification of\r\nbooks bearing upon the authority of the State and the history of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nIn the edict which stands at the head of the Lisbon Index, the\r\ninquisitor-general directs that copies of all books specified in the\r\nprohibited lists shall, within thirty days, be delivered to the local\r\ninquisitors, and further, that persons possessing copies of books\r\nbelonging to the general classes prohibited, or of books the texts of\r\nwhich are ordered to be expurgated, must, within thirty days, deliver\r\nlists of the same, and hold said books subject to instructions. The\r\npenalty for disobedience is, as usual, excommunication.\r\n\r\nIn the prefatory note to the expurgatory Index, occurs the remark,\r\nthat the works of certain well-known writers which, by the editors of\r\nprevious Indexes, have been considered to require expurgation, have\r\nhere not been included because their errors have been so thoroughly\r\nrefuted in the schools and in other books that their influence need no\r\nlonger be dreaded, and there should be no present risk for thoughtful\r\nreaders. The list of later Catholic writers whose works are marked for\r\nexpurgation is larger than in any other Index. Attention has also been\r\ngiven to a number of works in the class of belles-lettres which the\r\neditors have undertaken to purge from obscenities. Finally, the Index\r\ncontains a series of works on astrology, the expurgation of which has\r\nbeen undertaken with reference to the instructions given by Sixtus V in\r\na Bull issued in 1585 (forty years earlier.)\r\n\r\nThis is the first Index in which appears the title of the essay by King\r\nJames I of England, written in defence of his requirement for an oath\r\nof fidelity. This title, which is entered under the letter A, is worded\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n_Apologia pro juramento fidelitas, primum quidem anonymos, nunc vero\r\nab ipso auctore serenissimo et potentissimo Principo Jacobo, etc. Lond.\r\n1609._\r\n\r\nThe work is again condemned in the Spanish Index of 1632, where it is\r\nentered under J. Jacobus Rex. In the same year it finds place (this\r\ntime also under A) in the Roman Index, the _Elenchus Capsiferrei_,\r\nfrom which it has been repeated into the later Indexes of Rome. The\r\ncontinued condemnation of this treatise is of importance as evidence\r\nof the papal doctrine (which appears never to have been revoked) of\r\nthe right of the pope to depose kings. The Reverend Mr. O’Sullivan, in\r\nhis testimony before the Parliamentary Committee of 1825, on the State\r\nof Ireland, deduces this doctrine from the condemnation given by the\r\nChurch (in the Index) to the _Apologia_ of King James.[190]\r\n\r\n_4._ _1628._ _Rome._ _Papal Decree._ This decree contains an article\r\nentitled _Elucidarium Deiparae Auctore Joanne Baptista Poza_.\r\n\r\nPoza replies in a caustic _Apologia_ in which he charges Brasichelli\r\nwith censuring the Fathers, and with an unwarranted condemnation of\r\nEmmanuel Sa. This rebellious conduct was punished by the Decree of\r\nSeptember 9, 1632, making condemnation of all of the works of Poza.\r\nThis decree is reversed in a supplement to the Spanish Decree of 1640.\r\nThe obedient Catholic was therefore at liberty to read the works of\r\nPoza and of Sa within the dominions of Spain, but in so doing in other\r\nterritory, he incurred excommunication.\r\n\r\n_5._ _1632._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--_Elenchus Librorum omnium\r\ntum in Tridentino, Clementinoque Indice tum in aliis omnibus Sacrae\r\nIndicis Congreg._{nis} particularibus Decretis hactenus prohibitorum:\r\nOrdine uno Alphabetico, Per Fr.

Max._\r\n\r\nThis Index is chiefly intended, as is indicated in the preface, to\r\nfacilitate reference by writing under one alphabet the divisions of the\r\noriginal Indexes, and by giving surnames as well as Christian names.\r\n\r\n_6._ _1632._ _Seville._ _Index Prohibitorius et Expurgatorius._--_Novus\r\nIndex Librorum Prohibitorum et Expurgatorum; editus auctoritate et\r\njussu Eminent.^{mi} ac Reverend.^{mi} D.D.

MDCXXXII.\r\n\r\nThe Inquisitor’s _Edict_ refers to the Apostolic Brief of Urban VIII as\r\nthe reason for the production of a new Index, and states further that\r\nthis comprises, in addition to the works of the later modern writers,\r\nno less than 2500 works of ancient authors who had been overlooked by\r\nthose responsible for the preparation of previous Indexes. The usual\r\nprohibitions follow, with the penalty of the greater excommunication.\r\nThe _Brief_ of the Pope is in line with that of Paul V. Terrified\r\nat the abuse of existing licenses, the Pope revokes them all, very\r\nemphatically:\r\n\r\n_Revocamus, cassamus, irritamus et anullamus, ac veribus penitus\r\nevacuamus et pro revocatis_, etc.\r\n\r\nAuthority is given to the cardinal presbyter to put into execution\r\nthe several decrees, and to call in, if necessary, the assistance of\r\nthe secular arm. The “Notice to the Reader” announces that in place\r\nof prohibiting altogether, it has been thought best to permit, with\r\nsome necessary expurgation, the reading of certain works by heretics.\r\nFor convenience of reference, there is included in the work a general\r\nindex covering in one alphabet the titles in both the expurgatory and\r\nprohibitory divisions. The volume is the most considerable in bulk of\r\nthe Indexes thus far put into print, comprising over a thousand pages.\r\n\r\nOne entry in the class of authors proscribed _in toto_ is rather\r\ncurious in its wording:\r\n\r\n_Martinus Lutherus. Islebii natus in Saxonia, an. 1483. Praedicat\r\ncontra indulgentias 1517. Ab ordine Religioso et a Fide Catholica\r\nApostata, et Heresiarcha, 1517. Reperitur in lecto misere exanimis,\r\n1546._\r\n\r\nThis passage did not make its appearance in any subsequent Index.\r\n\r\n_7._ _1640._ _Madrid._ _Sotomayor._ In 1640, the Inquisitor-General\r\nAntonio de Sotomayor (a Dominican) produced an Index, also printed in\r\nMadrid, which contains both prohibitory and expurgatory divisions. An\r\nedition of this Index, printed (without imprint) either at Lyons or\r\nGeneva, secured a wide circulation. Sotomayor died in 1648, in his\r\nhundredth year. His Index was reprinted in Madrid in 1662, and again\r\nin 1667, under the name of his successor. The Spanish Index of 1707\r\nrefers, however, to that of 1640 as “the next preceding.”\r\n\r\nSotomayor’s introduction begins with a long declamation against\r\nheretical writers who have ventured to issue, under the names of\r\nCatholic authors, pernicious and damnable books; who have interpolated\r\ninto the text of orthodox writings heretical passages; who have\r\ndescribed as untrustworthy the writings of the Fathers of the Church\r\n(for instance the treatise of Ambrosius on the Sacraments and the works\r\nof Dionysius Areopagita); and who have destroyed great numbers of\r\npious books presenting good Catholic doctrine. The regulations which\r\nfollow are issued under the general Apostolic authority vested in the\r\ninquisitor-general, and under the special authority given by the Brief\r\nof the Holy Curia. All copies of works which are specifically condemned\r\nby title, or which belong to the classes condemned _in toto_,\r\nare to be delivered within ten days to the local inquisitor. Whoever\r\nretains books classed as heretical, falls under the _excommunicatio\r\nlatae_. The retention of other prohibited books brings upon the\r\npossessor the penalty of the _excommunicatio ferendae_. In either\r\ncase, there is a further penalty of a fine of six hundred ducats, and\r\nsuch additional punishments as may be ordered by the Inquisition. The\r\npower rests with the inquisitor-general alone of freeing delinquents\r\nfrom these penalties.\r\n\r\nThe sixteen rules contain certain additions to the Regulations of\r\nTrent. The writings of Catholics are, for instance, not to be condemned\r\non the ground of containing extracts from the works of heresiarchs\r\ncited for the purpose of refutation. In the supervision of books for\r\nthe purpose of expurgation, care is to be taken not to cancel the names\r\nof heresiarchs who are referred to by the authors in connection with\r\nnecessary refutations.\r\n\r\nThe rules and penalties are similar to those previously in force. The\r\nsupplement contains an entry permitting, after certain expurgations,\r\nthe reading of the works of Poza, which by the Roman Congregation had\r\nbeen absolutely condemned.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the character of the expurgations which find place\r\nin the Spanish Indexes may be cited the following: Sotomayor orders\r\nthe cancellation, in bibliographies or other works of reference, of\r\nthe following terms when applied to names of writers standing in\r\nthe general Index in Class I: _vir optimus, pius, bonae memoriae,\r\ndoctissimus sapientissimus, princeps eruditorum, divinus (Scaliger),\r\nGermaniae lumen (Melanchthon), decus saeculi nostri, etc._ It\r\nis however permitted to describe Buchanan as a “poet of elegance,”\r\nHenricus Stephanus as “learned in Greek scholarship,” Tycho Brahe as “a\r\ndistinguished mathematician and astronomer”; because the attainments\r\nso indicated are the gift of God and have not been utilised, at least\r\ndirectly, against the true faith. The Spanish editor goes on to say,\r\nthat such titles as doctor and _magister_ can, strictly speaking,\r\nproperly be ascribed to no one outside of the Church; the reference\r\nis to cases in which these titles have been given by heretical\r\nuniversities whose authority is not recognised by the Church. The title\r\n_Dominus_ can however be permitted.\r\n\r\nThe expurgatory lists of Sotomayor include the title of the _Vitae\r\nGermanorum_ of Adams; the expurgations comprise thirteen folio\r\nsheets. There are certain interpolations comprising such terms as\r\n_notam auctoris damnati_ or _homo damnatae memoriae_, etc. In the\r\n_Bibliographica critica_, of Michael Josephus, published in Madrid in\r\n1740, the author says in his introduction:\r\n\r\n   “In the specification of works of heretics I have taken pains\r\n   to avoid using any terms of commendation; for it is certainly\r\n   not right that infamous persons who have fallen away from the\r\n   true Catholic faith should in any fashion be honoured. Certain\r\n   Catholic writers have on the other hand contended that heretical\r\n   authors whose work had been devoted to subjects outside of\r\n   theology or religion, such for instance as philology, geography,\r\n   profane history, jurisprudence, and the like, could very\r\n   properly be commended for their contributions to learning. To\r\n   this suggestion I should respond that I am prepared to recognise\r\n   the possibility of heretics possessing learning and talents, and\r\n   that certain heretics have written on certain subjects works\r\n   which may be of use to Catholics; but it seems to me entirely\r\n   improper to give any measure of praise to such men who have\r\n   failed to use for the support of the true faith the abilities\r\n   with which they have been endowed by the Lord. They can receive\r\n   enough praise from their heretical friends and it would tend to\r\n   make them intellectually insolent to learn that they had been\r\n   honoured also by Catholics.”\r\n\r\n_8._ _1664._ _Rome._ _Alexander VII._ The Index of Alexander, which\r\nin chronological order belongs at this point in the schedule, is\r\nconsidered separately in Chapter XIII.\r\n\r\n_9._ _1707._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius et Expurgatorius._\r\n\r\n_Novissimus Librorum Prohibitorum et Expurgandorum Index pro\r\nCatholicis Hispaniarum Regis Phillipi V Reg. Cath. Ann. 1707._\r\n\r\nOn the engraved title is printed, _Index Expurgatorius Hispanus ab\r\nEx^{mo} D^{no} Didace Sarmiento et Valladores inceptus, et ab Ill^o\r\nD^{no} D. Vitali Marin perfectus, etc. De Consilio Supremi Senatus\r\nInquisitionis Generalis._\r\n\r\nThe work is contained in two volumes, the first comprising 791 pages\r\nand the second 342 pages. It begins with the edict of the Bishop of\r\nCeuta, and Inquisitor-General, Don Vidal Marin, who explains that\r\nhe is completing the work of his predecessor Don Diego Sarmiento,\r\nwho had been interrupted in his labours by death. He writes that,\r\nconsidering the importance and necessity of continuing the Spanish\r\nIndex of 1640, this Index has been prepared in order that the books and\r\npamphlets issued during the last sixty-seven years might, as far as\r\nrequisite, be prohibited or expurgated and that the faithful might thus\r\nbe preserved from the errors which would otherwise have been caused\r\nthrough the circulation of heretical or erroneous texts. The previous\r\n_Advertencias_ and _Mandatos_ are repeated and are ordered to\r\nbe enforced with the utmost rigour of the law. Provision is made for\r\nthe publication of the Index in all churches, cathedrals, colleges, and\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nAn _avis_ of the Privy Council of Brussels, printed in 1708,\r\ncontains the following naïve remark in regard to this Index: _Et pour\r\nmontrer qu’il est très difficile d’examiner les livres et de discerner\r\ns’ils doivent être condamnés ou pas, on n’a que prendre recours a\r\nl’Index Expurgatorius d’Espagne, émané dernièrement en l’an 1707, ou\r\nse trouvent plusieurs livres approuvés que Rome a condamné, et de même\r\nplusieurs condamnés par les Inquisiteurs que la Ste. Congregation n’a\r\npas trouvé convenir de proscrire_.\r\n\r\n_10._ _1714._ _Namur and Liège._ _Hannot._--_Index ou Catalogues des\r\nprincipaux Livres condamnés, rédigé par Jean Baptiste Hannot, Recollet,\r\nLecteur en Théologie._\r\n\r\nThis Index, while issued _avec approbation_, was compiled without any\r\nspecific authority. It comprises a selection, arrived at apparently in\r\na rather haphazard fashion, of works favouring Jansenism.\r\n\r\n_11._ _1747._ _Madrid._ _Prado. 2 vols. 1200 pp. Pro. and Ex._ This\r\nIndex is noteworthy for its _Catalogo_ of Jansenist books. The list\r\noriginally included the _History of Pelagianism_ by Cardinal Noris,\r\nbut this entry was, as Mendham points out, subsequently cancelled by\r\nthe reprinting of a leaf.[191] The cancellation was the result of a\r\nprotest or remonstrance addressed by the Pope (Benedict XIV) to the\r\nInquisitor-General, Compostolla. The brief of Benedict is given in\r\na supplement to the _Bullarium_ of that Pope, and is cited from the\r\nedition printed in Mechlin, in 1827. The Pope reminds the inquisitor\r\nthat it is the policy of the Church to exercise censorship with\r\nmoderation and conservatism. He refers to the treatise of Bossuet,\r\npublished under the commands of the King of France, which was written\r\nin direct hostility to the infallibility of the Pope and to his claim\r\nfor authority over the temporal rights of princes; and he reminds the\r\ninquisitor that his predecessor had decided that the interest of the\r\nChurch would be better served by forbearing.\r\n\r\n_12._ _1790._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius et\r\nExpurgatorius._--_Indici Ultimo de los libros prohibidos y mandados\r\nexpurgar; para todos los Regnos y Señorios del Catolico Rey de las\r\nEspañas el Señor Dom. Carlos IV._ The work contains the prefatory\r\nmatter of the three preceding editions, and brings the lists of\r\ncondemned and expurgated books down to the close of December, 1789.\r\nThe Inquisitor-General, Cevallos, under whose supervision the work was\r\nprepared, declares, as the purpose of the Index, the presentation of\r\nan alphabetic compendium which should comprehend not only the contents\r\nof the Index of 1747, but likewise the titles of all works which had\r\nbeen prohibited or sentenced to expurgation in the edicts previously\r\ncited up to December 13, 1789. “This would,” he believed, “serve to\r\nclose the door to the excesses of printers and booksellers and also\r\nto wrongful action on the part of private persons, and would prevent\r\nthe evils consequent upon the introduction into the Kingdom of such\r\npernicious commodities as heretical books.”\r\n\r\nThe Index is noteworthy in expressing the change of policy in regard\r\nto the reading of the Scriptures. The inquisitor and his associates\r\nprofess themselves to be sensible of the benefits to be secured by\r\nthe faithful from the perusal of the Sacred Text, and with reference\r\nto the declaration to the same purpose in the Index of Benedict XIV\r\n(which declaration is printed in the present volume) they decide to\r\naccord permission for the reading of versions of the Bible in the\r\nvulgar tongue, with qualifications similar to those specified in the\r\nBenedictine Index. The longer expurgations of the earlier Indexes are\r\nnot reprinted, but a reference is made, connected with the name of the\r\nauthor, to the Index in which the expurgation originated. For instance:\r\n\r\n“Abailardus (Petrus) _ejus opera_ V. Ind. Exp. 1747, p. 920.”\r\n\r\nWith reference to these condensed entries, the Index of 1790 is often\r\nreferred to as an Index manual. To the twelfth rule (in the series\r\nof sixteen) is added the instruction that the possessor of a book\r\nordered to be expurgated is at liberty himself to make the necessary\r\ncorrections in the text, provided, however, that his corrected text\r\nshall, within two months’ time, be submitted to and approved by the\r\nlocal inquisitor.\r\n\r\nReusch points out that these Spanish Indexes, even the latest, contain\r\nmany more errors, both bibliographical and typographical, than those\r\nof the Roman series before Benedict. The compilers of the Index of\r\nCevallos were of course in a position to utilise in their work the\r\nlists and the information brought together in the Index of Benedict.\r\nIt would appear, however, that they made no use of the Benedictine\r\nIndex, while it is evident that the compilers were in many cases quite\r\nignorant of even the names of the authors and of the books condemned\r\n(not to speak of the contents). The following entry may be cited as an\r\nexample of some likely to cause perplexity to the devout reader:\r\n\r\n“Fulko Grevil, Theliffe Of the Renovudne, Senior Phillip Ciduaey” (Fulk\r\nGreville’s _Life of the Renowned Sir Philip Sidney_).\r\n\r\n_13._ _Supplements to the Spanish Index of 1790._ The second\r\nissue of the Index of 1790 contains two supplements which present the\r\ntitles of certain books that, during the printing of the Index, came\r\nunder the condemnation of the Inquisition. The works belong almost\r\nexclusively to a group of writings having to do with the French\r\nRevolution. In 1805, was printed a third supplement that contains books\r\nprohibited between 1789 and 1805. This list includes, in addition to\r\nwritings of the Revolution, certain Italian works that had during\r\nthe preceding decade been prohibited in Rome. Between the years 1806\r\nand 1819 (years that covered the period of the French invasion, the\r\nshort-lived kingdom of Joseph, and the reorganisation of the kingdom),\r\nthe Inquisition published seven edicts in which a number of works were\r\nprohibited. These lists were, however, not combined into any official\r\nIndex. In 1844, was printed in Madrid an Index in which were combined\r\ninto one alphabet the lists of the Index of 1790, the supplement of\r\n1805, and the lists of the Mechlin edition of the Roman Index of 1843.\r\nThis publication was, however, a private and unofficial undertaking.\r\nIn 1848, was printed in Madrid an appendix to the Index of 1844, which\r\ncontains the titles of the books prohibited by the Inquisition between\r\n1805 and 1819 together with the titles of the books prohibited in Rome\r\nbetween 1842 and 1846. In 1863, was issued in Madrid a second appendix\r\ngiving the titles of the books prohibited in Rome between 1846 and 1862.\r\n\r\nThe edict of 1782, a citation of which appears in the Index of\r\n1790, orders that: All persons having permission for the reading of\r\nprohibited books must, not less often than once a year, make statement\r\nto the confessors of the books of this class that they are utilising.\r\nThe confessors are authorised and instructed by the Inquisition to\r\nrevoke these permits in case they find that the reading in question\r\nis causing injury to the faith of those holding the permits. The\r\nconfessors are to demand of the penitents from time to time, and in any\r\ncase at the time of the annual confession, whether they have in their\r\npossession copies of prohibited books and whether in the course of the\r\nyear they have read any such books. In the former case, the penitents\r\nmust agree to deliver the books for destruction; and in the latter must\r\ntruly express their penitence for the sin committed. Until this has\r\nbeen done, they are not to receive absolution.\r\n\r\nThe permits for the reading of prohibited books given by the Roman\r\nCongregations are not valid in Spain. The permits issued directly by\r\nthe pope are to be delivered to the inquisitor-general in Spain or\r\nto the council of the Inquisition, who are, if they are willing to\r\nconfirm them, to make registration of the same. They may, however,\r\nrefuse to confirm such Roman permits on the ground that the results\r\nwould be injurious for those using them. The permission to read\r\nprohibited books or to possess copies of them, does not carry with it\r\nthe authority to import such books, to buy or to sell copies, to make\r\npresentation of copies, or to exchange them for other books.\r\n\r\nAmong the noteworthy books contained in the supplement to the\r\nSpanish Index, issued in 1805, may be mentioned the following:\r\nBonnet, _Oeuvres_, 18 volumes; the works of Alexander Pope, Laurence\r\nSterne (the reference is to the French version), Forster, _Voyage\r\nPhilosophique_; Smith, the _Wealth of Nations_ (French version); Burke,\r\n_Reflections on the French Revolution_; _Die Rechte des Menschen_, a\r\nreply to Burke’s treatise on the Revolution, etc.\r\n\r\n_14._ _Examples of Spanish Prohibitions. 1559–1768._ The first of\r\nthe Spanish Indexes, that of Valdes in 1551, contains but one or two\r\nSpanish titles, but the lists of 1559 and 1570 give evidence of fuller\r\nattention to Spanish authors. The books prohibited belonged for the\r\nmost part not to heretical literature, but were those presenting,\r\nin translations of the Scriptures or in controversies on points of\r\ndoctrine, matter that was not safe or not suitable for the knowledge\r\nof the general lay public. The Inquisition in Spain had, from the\r\nbeginning, been more sharply opposed than were the Church authorities\r\nelsewhere, to the distribution to the lay public of literature, and\r\nparticularly of literature in the vernacular, having to do with the\r\ndoctrines of the Church, even when such books were sound in their own\r\nteachings and had been prepared to expose and to repress error. The\r\ninquisitors took the ground that it was wiser to keep the faithful\r\nin ignorance of the existence of errors. An example of this policy\r\nis the prohibition in the Index of Valdes in 1559 of the writings of\r\nFrancisco de Borja, who was later enrolled with the saints, and of\r\nJuan de Avila, Luis de Granada, who have since been classed with the\r\nbest of the ascetic writers and as “shining lights in God’s Church in\r\nSpain.”[192] In 1571, permission was refused by the Inquisition for the\r\nprinting of a Spanish version of the Roman Catechism. Valdes prohibited\r\nall tracts, letters, and pamphlets, reports of sermons, etc., that had\r\nto do with the Scriptures or with the Sacraments. This prohibition\r\nincluded any reprints in the Spanish tongue of the Gospels or of\r\nextracts from the Gospels or of the Epistles of Paul.\r\n\r\nA prohibition initiated by Quiroga was continued through the following\r\ncentury, condemning “comedies, tragedies, and farces in which any\r\nreflection or ridicule was cast upon the Sacraments, the practice of\r\nchurch-going, the holy orders, or the Inquisition.” In 1581, the Index\r\nof Lisbon added to the above a prohibition of the presentation on\r\nthe stage of any ecclesiastical characters or the performance of any\r\nsacramental acts. This latter ruled out, of course, the representation\r\nof marriage. In one of the later Indexes, the second part of _Don\r\nQuixote_ comes into the list of works to be expurgated, but the\r\nmaterial condemned comprises but a single sentence: _Las obras de\r\ncharidad que se hazen flaxamente, no tienen merito ni valen nada_.\r\n\r\nIt is a characteristic of the Spanish expurgatory Indexes that they\r\ndo not give the references by chapter and by page to the texts of the\r\nauthors corrected. Mendham points out that the careful and orthodox\r\nstudent, who might wish to assure himself of the accuracy of his own\r\nliterary guides, would find it important to refer to the originals\r\nof the corrected texts if only in order to be placed in a position\r\nto defend the action of his Church and to confound or possibly even\r\nto convert heretical opposers. “Supposing for instance,” says he,\r\n“a discussion should take place between a believer and an heretical\r\ncritic, and the latter should have the hardihood to assert that the\r\nsentences condemned in the Index were not the _ipsissima verba_ or\r\nthe necessary sense of the author referred to, what reply could be made\r\nby the defender of the Index who had never been able to make personal\r\nexamination of the text in question?”[193]\r\n\r\nIn 1827, there was published in the _Protestant Guardian_ (on pages\r\n118 _et seq._) a review of the censures in the expurgatory Indexes.\r\nThe writer gives as examples of erasures that seemed to him to be\r\nfutile or at least open to criticism the following: In the _Glossarium\r\nGraeco-Barbarum_ of Mensius, out of twenty-five erasures fifteen\r\nconsist simply in expunging before the names of Junius and other\r\nlearned men the terms _V. C._, _Eruditus_, etc.\r\n\r\nSo far from its being lawful to admit that a Protestant could be\r\neither learned or illustrious, it was forbidden even to give the name\r\nof theologians to Protestants pretending to Holy Orders. The English\r\nbishops always figure in the Indexes under the term “pseudo-episcopi.”\r\nThis is doubtless, however, a logical term for the Church to use\r\nconcerning officials who must of necessity have been considered as\r\nusurping laymen. In the erasures in the ninth book of the history of De\r\nThou, we find corrections of a more exacting character. The following\r\nis an instance: _Theologis, qui ad concilium_, pro _Theologis_ scribe\r\n_iis_. _Et ibi decrevisse viros bonos mittere_, dele _bonos_.\r\n\r\nThe censor actually follows through his rambles the wandering Jew of\r\nTudela, although the translation of this narrative was issued by so\r\ngood a Catholic as Montanus (himself a censor) in order to blot out\r\nevery kind word which Benjamin had uttered respecting his nation. For\r\nexample: _Filius Jonae probandae memoriae_, dele _probandae memoriae_;\r\n_Synagoga sacra_, dele vocem _sacra_; _Filii Haziddai felicis\r\nmemoriae_, dele _felicis memoriae_; and so on through a folio page.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that such works of English writers as have been\r\nconsidered by the framers of the Index, are placed almost exclusively\r\nin the prohibitory division, and in this are included in the first\r\nclass, that is to say, under the heading of authors whose works, past,\r\npresent, and future (_opera edita et edenda_), are absolutely\r\nprohibited. One of the few English books which have been mentioned by\r\ntitle (apart from the names of the authors) in the prohibitory Index\r\nis the version of the Psalms by Sternhold and Hopkins. This is the\r\nbook understood to be referred to by the title _Psalmes of Dauid in\r\nEnglische Metre_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n            THE INDEX OF ALEXANDER VII AND THE CONDEMNATION\r\n                        OF GALILEO--ROME, 1664\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1664, was published at Rome the _Index Prohibitorius_ of Alexander\r\nVII. In the accompanying Bull, the Pope says that since the publication\r\nof the Index of Clement VIII, a number of books had been prohibited\r\nby his successors and by the Congregation of the Index, but no\r\nauthoritative schedule of the same had been issued which presented\r\nin one comprehensive list the titles of the books and the names of\r\ntheir authors. He had, therefore, caused a new Index to be compiled\r\nwhich contained all the titles from the lists of Trent and of Clement,\r\ntogether with all the further prohibitions, and in which, for\r\nconvenience of reference, the three classes of the Trent Index had\r\nbeen put together, which enabled the titles to be presented in one\r\nalphabeted list. The division into three classes of the books condemned\r\nhad in any case been open to the objection that it had “tended to give\r\nthe impression that the books of Class I were more pernicious than\r\nthose of Classes II and III and their reading more reprehensible; while\r\nas a fact there were in the third class not a few works much wickeder\r\nthan any in the other classes.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the titles of the prohibited books, this Index presents\r\nthe complete series of the decrees since that of the Trent Index,\r\nunder which the prohibitions were ordered. “The several regulations,\r\ncondemnations, and prohibitions,” continues the rescript, “presented\r\nin this Index, we do hereby, under the Apostolic authority, confirm\r\nand approve as in force at this time and as binding on all the members\r\nof the Church; and we order that all universities, their associations,\r\nand individuals shall give obedience to the same without exception or\r\nreservation.” Then follow the specifications of penalties, seventeen in\r\nall, and instructions to bishops and inquisitors for the publication of\r\nthe regulations and enforcement of the penalties.\r\n\r\nIn 1665, the Secretary of the Index Congregation, Vincentius Fanus,\r\npublished an edition of Alexander’s Index, with the omission of the\r\nClementine lists and of the series of decrees.\r\n\r\nIn 1667, was published, either at Lyons or Geneva, a reprint of the\r\ntext as revised by Fanus, but with the addition of the Clementine\r\nlists and of the series of decrees. The latter are brought down to\r\n1667. Fanus says of his edition that it is more comprehensive and more\r\ncorrect than that of 1664. It is not clear, however, from what sources\r\nhis additional titles are taken. The division into three classes is\r\nabandoned; but he points out that there is no difficulty in identifying\r\nto which class an entry belongs. The name of an author, for instance,\r\nnot followed by any book-title indicates Class I; the title of a book\r\nwithout name of author indicates Class III; while the author’s name\r\nconnected with title stands for Class II, which constitutes the bulk\r\nof the Index. Fanus has some idea of bibliographical method. He makes\r\ncross-references for authors who in previous Indexes are presented\r\nsometimes under a forename and sometimes under a surname, the latter\r\nbeing frequently of course derived from the place of residence. The\r\nIndex contains an “Address to the Reader” by Fr. Hyacinthus Libellus,\r\nFanus’s predecessor. In this address, the Secretary takes the ground\r\nthat all other Indexes are to be considered as “private” (_i. e._\r\nunofficial).\r\n\r\nThe first list in the series covers 160 pages. The second list presents\r\nexclusively books the title of which is followed by the name of the\r\nauthor. The third list is confined to books the title of which follows\r\nthe name of the author. Then follows an appendix covering titles from\r\n1661 to 1664, and this is followed by the text of the Tridentine Index,\r\nto which is prefixed an _Admonition_ by Libellus giving the origin\r\nand the history of that Index. Libellus affirms that the deputation of\r\nthe Index, originally instituted by Pius IV, was matured into a formal\r\ncongregation by Pius V.\r\n\r\nThe concluding division is entitled: _Index Decretorum_. This is\r\nsaid to present _Omnia Decreta quae vel a Magistro Sac. Palatiti, cum\r\nratione Officii siu, tum Jussu Sac. Congregationis, vel ab ipsis Sacris\r\nCongregationibus Indicis, et S. Officii emanuerunt_.\r\n\r\nThis Index of 1664 is noteworthy as containing the formal condemnation\r\nof the works of Copernicus and Galileo, and of all other writings\r\nwhich affirmed the movement of the earth and the stability of the sun.\r\nThe proceedings against Galileo and the Copernican doctrine had been\r\ninstituted in 1616 under Paul V. The final condemnation of Galileo was\r\ngiven in 1633, under Urban VIII.\r\n\r\n=The Condemnation of Galileo, and of the Copernican Theory of the\r\nSolar System.=--The fourteenth and twentyeighth of the decrees\r\nsummarised in the Index of 1664 present the record of the condemnation\r\nof Galileo. The records of the long series of the proceedings, upon\r\nwhich the final condemnation of Galileo was based, constitute a\r\nconsiderable mass of literature. It is necessary here to make reference\r\nonly to the more essential conclusions arrived at by the Church\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1616, the Congregation of the Index, under the instructions\r\nof Pope Paul V., had rendered a decree to the effect that “the doctrine\r\nof the double motion of the earth about its axis and about the sun\r\nis false and entirely contrary to Holy Scripture.” The same decree\r\ncondemned all writings of Copernicus and all writings which affirmed\r\nthe motion of the earth. These condemnations were inscribed upon the\r\nIndex and in connection with this Index was issued the usual papal Bull\r\ngiving to its monitions the most solemn papal sanction. “To teach or\r\neven to read the works denounced or the passages condemned was to risk\r\npersecution in this world and damnation in the next.”[194]\r\n\r\nThe abjuration of Galileo bears date July 22, 1633. The decree of the\r\nsame date, which sentences the philosopher to imprisonment and other\r\npenance, sets forth that the ground of the charge against him was his\r\nstatement that the sun was the centre of the system and was immovable,\r\nand that the earth, revolving around the sun and also around its own\r\naxis, was movable. The decree sets forth further that, in 1616, the\r\noffender had been admonished by Cardinal Bellarmin, and that in the\r\nsame year the Congregation of the Index issued a decree condemning\r\nthe doctrine; notwithstanding this condemnation, Galileo had again\r\noffended by repeating the same erroneous theories in a volume entitled\r\n_Dialogo_.\r\n\r\nThis volume, issued in 1632, was a treatise presented in the form of a\r\ndialogue, exhibiting the arguments for and against the Copernican and\r\nPtolemaic systems. The publication was the result of discussions which\r\nhad extended through eight years, and was finally permitted only on the\r\ncondition that the volume should contain a preface, for the wording\r\nof which Ricciardi, master of the sacred palace, was responsible, but\r\nwhich bore the signature of Galileo, and in which the Copernican theory\r\nwas described as a mere play of the imagination and as not in fact\r\nopposed to the Ptolemaic doctrine. The book secured at once a large\r\ncirculation and a widespread influence. The preface was disregarded\r\nor was laughed at, while the reasonings in the dialogue were accepted\r\nby many as practically conclusive of the Copernican doctrine. These\r\nreasonings were considered by the new Pope, Urban VIII, as bringing him\r\ninto ridicule and, under the Pope’s instructions, Galileo and his books\r\nwere placed in the hands of the Inquisition. It was later contended\r\nby certain Catholic writers that Galileo was condemned not for his\r\nopinions or theories, but for having claimed to found these theories on\r\nScripture. Sir Robert Inglis is quoted by Mendham as having maintained\r\nthis view as late as 1824.[195] This contention appears however to\r\nbe fairly met by the fact that the Roman Index of 1704 contains an\r\nexplicit condemnation of “all works maintaining the mobility of the\r\nearth and the immobility of the sun.”\r\n\r\nThe decree numbered thirty-eight and issued August 23, 1634, specifies,\r\nwith other condemned books, _Dialogo di Galileo Galilei_. Decree\r\nnumber fourteen connects with the condemned Copernican doctrine the\r\nname not of Galileo but of Foscarini. It adds, however, the general\r\nsentence: _Aliosque omnes libros pariter idem docentes_.\r\n\r\nThe names of both Foscarini and Galileo appear in the body of the\r\nIndex, the first under _Lettera_, the second under _Dialogo_. In the\r\nRoman Index of 1704 (first edition), the following entry stands in\r\nits alphabetic place: _Libri omnes docentes mobilitatem Terrae et\r\nimmobilitatem solis_. In all later editions of the Index this entry\r\nwas, however, omitted.[196]\r\n\r\nSundry theologians of the Inquisition were instructed to examine two\r\npropositions which had been extracted from Galileo’s letters on the\r\nsolar system. Their decision was rendered as follows:\r\n\r\n   “The first proposition, that the sun is the centre and does not\r\n   revolve about the earth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology,\r\n   and heretical, because expressly contrary to Holy Scripture”;\r\n   and “the second proposition, that the earth is not the centre\r\n   but revolves about the sun, is absurd, false in philosophy, and\r\n   from a theological point of view, at least, opposed to the true\r\n   faith.”[197]\r\n\r\nThe ground on which had been based the contention of the defenders\r\nof the Church that Galileo had made the Scriptures responsible for\r\nhis new theory of the solar system, was a suggestion contained in\r\nletters written by the astronomer to his friend Castelli and to the\r\nGrand Duchess Christine, to the effect that his discoveries might be\r\nreconciled with Scripture.\r\n\r\nThe result of the long contest is now, of course, fully on record.\r\nThe examinations and discussions had extended over a period of sixteen\r\nyears. Galileo had for a large portion of that time been kept in prison\r\nunder the direct control of the Roman Inquisition. It appears from the\r\nrecords, which have been summarised by Andrew White and others, that\r\nby the express order of Pope Urban he was menaced from time to time\r\nwith torture, although it is probable that physical torture was never\r\nactually administered. The old man was finally (in 1633) forced to\r\npronounce publicly and on his knees a recantation worded as follows:\r\n\r\n   “I, Galileo, being in my seventieth year, being a prisoner and\r\n   on my knees, and before your Eminences, having before my eyes\r\n   the Holy Gospel, which I touch with my hands, abjure, curse,\r\n   and detest the error and the heresy of the movement of the\r\n   earth.”[198]\r\n\r\nThe Inquisitors were ordered not to permit the publication of any\r\nfurther editions of Galileo’s works or of any writings upholding\r\nhis theories. On the other hand, “theologians were urged, now that\r\nCopernicus and Galileo and Kepler were silenced, to reply to them with\r\ntongue and pen.” Europe was flooded with these theological refutations\r\nof the Copernican system.[199]\r\n\r\nThe authority of the Index of the Congregation and of the Papacy\r\nback of the Index remained committed to the position taken by Pope\r\nUrban and his advisers until the time of Benedict XIV. In 1757, under\r\ninstructions given by Benedict, the Congregation of the Index removed\r\nthe old-time restrictions on writings advocating the Copernican system.\r\nAs late, however, as 1765, Lalande, the great French astronomer,\r\nattempted without success to secure from the authorities at Rome the\r\nremoval from the Index of the works of Galileo.\r\n\r\nArtaud, writing in the Dublin _Review_ in September, 1865, in defence\r\nof the record of the Church, states that Galileo’s _Dialogue_ was\r\npublished complete in Padua in 1714, “with the usual approbations.” In\r\nthe same article, it is stated that in 1818 the ecclesiastical decrees\r\nwere repealed by Pius VII in full Consistory.[200] The historian Cantu,\r\nhowever, who is described as an authority favourable to the Church,\r\nspeaks of the work of Copernicus as remaining on the Index as late as\r\n1835.[201] Cantu’s authority is supported by Reusch.[202]\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Canon Settele, professor of astronomy at Rome, had ready for\r\npublication an elementary textbook which was based upon the Copernican\r\nsystem. The master of the sacred palace, Anfossi, refused to allow the\r\nbook to be printed unless Settele would reshape it and would refer to\r\nthe Copernican theory as merely an hypothesis. The professor appealed\r\nto Pope Pius VII by whom the matter was referred to the Congregation of\r\nthe Inquisition. The issue aroused considerable discussion but finally,\r\non the eleventh of September, 1822, the cardinals of the Inquisition\r\nagreed upon the concession that “the printing and publication of works\r\ntreating of the motion of the earth and the stability of the sun, in\r\naccordance with the general opinion of modern astronomers, is hereafter\r\npermitted at Rome.”[203]\r\n\r\nThe decree was ratified by Pius VII and, after a delay of two years,\r\nthe professor was permitted to place his book in the hands of the\r\nprinters. It may, I judge, be inferred that until the publication of\r\nthis volume, late in 1822, the pupils in the orthodox Catholic schools\r\nhad not been permitted the use of any textbooks on astronomy, the\r\nconclusions of which were in accord with the Copernican system. It was\r\nnot until 1835, thirteen years after the decision of the cardinals,\r\nthat an edition of the Index appeared in which was omitted all\r\ncondemnation of works defending the double motion of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe divines in the Protestant Church were no more favourable than were\r\nthe Catholic theologians to the Copernican theory of the universe.\r\nLutherans, Calvinists, Anglicans, and Protestant teachers alike placed\r\nthemselves on record as in opposition to the teachings of Copernicus\r\nand of Galileo. The great preacher in London, Dr. South, denounced as\r\nirreligious the report of the Royal Society in which the Copernican\r\ndoctrine had been accepted. As late as 1724, Professor John Hutchinson\r\nof Cambridge, in a treatise entitled the _Principia of Moses_,\r\nundertook to build up from the text of the Bible a complete physical\r\nsystem of the universe. In this treatise, the Newtonian and Copernican\r\ntheories were condemned as atheistic. In 1722, Thomas Burnett, in the\r\nsixth edition of his _Sacred Theory of the Earth_, argues for\r\nthe scriptural doctrine of the earth’s stability. In Holland, the\r\nCalvinistic Church was from the outset strenuously opposed to the whole\r\nnew system. The opposition of the Lutherans was continued until a very\r\nlate date. In 1873, was issued by the Lutheran publishing house of St.\r\nLouis a work entitled _Astronomische Unterredung_, in which was\r\nagain maintained the theory that the earth is a fixed body and the\r\ncentre of the universe.\r\n\r\nThese utterances from the Protestants present sufficient evidence\r\nthat the old theologies as they were then interpreted could not\r\neasily be reconciled with the now accepted views of the constitution\r\nof the universe. It does not appear, however, that in any one of the\r\nProtestant realms the opposition of the divines to the new astronomy\r\nwas associated with any persecution either of authors or instructors.\r\nThe Church of Rome must assume the responsibility for having continued\r\nduring a series of years, which ended only with the lifetime of its\r\nvictim, the persecution of a great scientist whose only crime was his\r\nexceptional capacity for scientific investigation and his desire to\r\npresent simply and effectively what he believed to be the truth. In\r\n1852, two hundred and twenty years after the condemnation of Galileo,\r\nwhich had been brought about largely through the influence of the\r\nJesuits, the astronomer Secchi, himself a Jesuit, presented, in one of\r\nthe churches at Rome, the experiment of Foucault with the pendulum,\r\nmaking clear to the human eye the movement of the earth about its own\r\naxis.[204]\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy title in the Index of 1664 is that of the _Lettres\r\nProvinciales_ of Pascal. Mendham finds ground for surprise that an\r\nauthor who could maintain so emphatically certain of the most exacting\r\npretensions of the Church of Rome should have been thought deserving of\r\ncondemnation. In the seventeenth of the _Lettres Provinciales_,\r\nPascal writes:\r\n\r\n   “_Grâce à Dieu, je n’ai d’attache sur la terre qu’à la seule\r\n   Église Catholique, Apostolique, Romaine, dans laquelle je\r\n   veux vivre et mourir, et dans la communion avec le Pape, son\r\n   souverain chef, hors de laquelle je suis très persuadé qu’il n’y\r\n   a point de salut._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n            DECREES AND INDEXES, FRENCH, BELGIAN, BOHEMIAN,\r\n                     ROMAN, AND SPANISH, 1685–1815\r\n\r\n    1685.

Inquisitor-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1._ _1685._ _Paris._ _Decrees of Louis XIV._--In 1685, shortly\r\nbefore the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Louis XIV ordered the\r\nsuppression and destruction of the writings of the Protestants. Harlay,\r\nArchbishop of Paris, thereupon published, at the request of the\r\nParliament of Paris, a catalogue of these books which has, as compared\r\nwith the Roman indexes, a distinctive character of its own. In this\r\nlist of books condemned and ordered to be destroyed, no reference is\r\nmade to the Indexes of the Roman series, and, on their part, these\r\nIndexes give no consideration to the Paris catalogue.\r\n\r\nA convention of the clergy held in 1682, published a pastoral letter\r\n(_Un Avertissement pastoral_) addressed to those who followed the\r\nso-called reformed faith. The purpose of this _Avertissement_ was\r\nstated to be a reconciliation with the Church of these backsliders; and\r\nit included a _mémoire_ setting forth the different methods that\r\ncould to advantage be followed in order to bring about the conversion\r\nof these heretics. Included in this _mémoire_ is a statement of\r\northodox doctrine entitled “Doctrine of the Church as contained in\r\nits profession of faith and in the Decrees of the Council of Trent as\r\nopposed to the calumnies and the false charges spread to the world in\r\nthe works of the so-called reformers.”\r\n\r\nIn 1685, the convention addressed a brief to the King in which it is\r\nstated that the clergy did not demand a revocation of the Edict by\r\nmeans of which earlier kings, under unhappy conditions and on grounds\r\nthat no longer existed, had for a time permitted the practice of the\r\nso-called reformed religion. The request was, however, submitted to\r\nthe King that during the time in which the Edict should yet remain in\r\nforce, the reformers were to be forbidden in their sermons or writings\r\nto abuse or to libel the Catholic Church. In August, 1685, Louis XIV\r\npublished an edict in which reformers were forbidden to preach or\r\nto write against the faith and the doctrine of the Roman Catholic\r\nreligion. They were further to be permitted to print only such books as\r\ncontained the statement of their own creed, the text of their prayers,\r\nand their rules of discipline. All controversial books having to do\r\nwith the Catholic faith were condemned, prohibited, and ordered to\r\nbe destroyed. Any disobedience to this edict is to be punished with\r\nbanishment and confiscation of property. The printing or the selling of\r\nthe prohibited books is to be punished with a fine of 1600 livres, and\r\nwith the cancellation of the license to print. The list of the books\r\nso condemned was published in September, 1685, under the authority of\r\nArchbishop Harlay and with an _arrêt_ of Parliament. The title is,\r\n_Catalogue des livres condamnéz et deffendus par le Mandement de M.\r\nl’Archevésque de Paris_.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue is arranged alphabetically, but at the close is a\r\nsupplement containing forty-five titles without alphabetical order. The\r\ntitles are restricted to books printed either in Latin or in French but\r\ninclude a number which have been issued outside of France. This Index\r\ncondemns as “scandalous” all versions of the Scriptures prepared by the\r\nProtestant ministers. In October was published the edict revoking the\r\nEdict of Nantes.\r\n\r\n_2._ _Belgian Indexes 1695–1735._--In the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury, were printed in Namur two lists made up from the Roman Index.\r\nThe first carries no editorial name and is printed in Latin under the\r\ntitle _Elenchus propositionum et librorum prohibitorum_. It bears the\r\ndate 1709. The second carries the name, as compiler, of Jean Baptiste\r\nHannot. The text is in French. The title reads _Index ou Catalogue des\r\nprincipaux livres condamnés et défendus par l’Église_. This bears date\r\n1714. It comprises a selection of works in support of Jansenism. The\r\ncompiler is a zealous member of the society of Jesus. Both these lists\r\nare private undertakings, issued under no ecclesiastical or political\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1695, Precipiano, Archbishop of Mechlin, published a\r\ndecree which orders the condemnation of seventy-three works, chiefly\r\nthe writings of the Jansenists. Among the titles given in the\r\n_Elenchus_ of 1709 are the works of “de Chartes” (Descartes) and\r\nof Copernicus. The Index contains the following remark:\r\n\r\n   “A number of the books which were prohibited in the Tridentine\r\n   Index, such as the works of Erasmus and Molinäus, have been\r\n   corrected in the Antwerp _Index expurgatorius_. It may\r\n   therefore be assumed that the later editions of these works\r\n   have been printed with the approved text.”\r\n\r\nThe Index of Hannot, while unofficial, secured later the approval of\r\nthe Bishop of Namur. The Index of Precipiano undertook to prohibit only\r\nbooks which had not already been prohibited in Rome. The Congregation\r\nof the Index paid no attention to the lists prepared by Precipiano.\r\nOf the long list of Calvinistic books condemned by Precipiano, only\r\none, a treatise by Basnage, was prohibited in Rome (not until 1728),\r\nand of the sixty Jansenist writings only two, the _Difficultés_ of\r\nArnauld and an essay of Quesnel, found place in the Roman lists.\r\nBrussels, 1735.--_Catalogus Preliminaris donec amplior sequatur,\r\nQuorundam Librorum tum prohibitorum tum noxiorum aut Periculosorum et\r\nProscriptorum e Belgio Austriaco_, etc. The first division is devoted\r\nto an _Instructio Summaria_ comprising the general rules; then follows\r\nthe body of the Index under the title: _Instructio specifica sine\r\nCatalogus_, etc. This Index is distinctive in giving in a separate\r\nschedule, connected with the titles by numbers, the grounds on which\r\nthe books are condemned. The schedule is entitled: _Qualificationes\r\net Censurae Librorum_. The lists are largely devoted to the works of\r\nJansen, Quesnel, and van Espen. The Index is said by Mendham to have\r\nbeen the work of the Jesuit Father Wouters Hoynck van Papendrecht,\r\nArchpriest of Malines. The regulations provide for minute and vexatious\r\nvisits of printeries and bookshops, and for interference with sales\r\nof books. The Index appears never to have got beyond the status of\r\na scheme. It secured the cordial approval of the Governess, the\r\nDuchess Marie Elizabeth, but the Council of Brabant objected to the\r\npublication, and appears to have been strong enough to maintain its\r\nobjection. The regulations of the Index failed, therefore, to secure\r\nthe sanction of law, and were not put into force. The result indicates\r\nthat the authority of Philip IV in Brabant was not as final as had been\r\nthat of Philip II. The scheme comes into print in a supplemental volume\r\nof the works of van Espen.[205]\r\n\r\nThe introduction contains the following noteworthy observation:\r\n\r\n   “_Il seroit inutile de répéter que dans tout le dit Catalogue\r\n   on ne trouve pas condamné un seul livre de ceux qui ont voulu\r\n   attribuer aux Papes ce pouvoir illimité, à l’égard des Princes\r\n   seculiers, ce qui prouve encore le nécessité qu’il y a de\r\n   maintenir les auteurs qui à cet égard ont soutenu les droits des\r\n   Princes._”\r\n\r\nThis complaint occurs not infrequently on the part of the critics of\r\nthe Indexes. It was made among others by Fra Paolo in his _Discorso_ on\r\nthe Inquisition already referred to.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the members of the council speak of the author\r\nof the Index as being unknown to them. It is evident that they do not\r\naccept as real the authors whose names are given. It is a suggestion\r\nof Mendham that the chief purpose of the production of this particular\r\nIndex was the proscription by the Jesuits of the works of van Espen.\r\nIt is evident in any case from the character of the books selected for\r\ncondemnation, as well as from the wording of the documents connected\r\nwith the lists, that this Index was a part of the long fight of the\r\nJesuits against the followers of Jansenius.\r\n\r\nAmong the authors condemned in this Index was, curiously enough, the\r\nwell-known bishop and eloquent preacher, Bossuet, called by some\r\nof his contemporaries the Eagle of Meaux, and also the _Mallens\r\nHaereticorum_. The full title of the work condemned is as follows:\r\n_Defensio declarationis celeberrimae quam de Potestate ecclesiastica\r\nsanxit Clerus Gallicanus, 19 Martii, 1682, ab Illus. ac Rev. Jacobo\r\nBenigno Bossuet Meldensi Episcopo, ex speciali jussu Ludovici Magni\r\nScripta_, 2 vol. 4to, Luxemburgi, 1730.\r\n\r\n_3._ _Bohemian Indexes, 1726–1767._--In 1726, was printed in Prague\r\na reprint of the Roman Index of 1704 together with the appendix of\r\n1716. In 1729, was printed at Königgrätz, as a supplement to the\r\nRoman Index, an _Index prohibitorius_ and _expurgatorius_ in which\r\nspecial consideration is given to works in Latin, in German, and in\r\nCzech which had found circulation in Bohemia. The main title reads:\r\n_Clavis haeresim claudens et aperiens_. This is followed by a Bohemian\r\ntitle the substance of which is: “A key which has for its purpose\r\nthe making clear to the understanding the pernicious character of\r\nheretical writings, and which, in so doing, shall provide for their\r\nextermination; or a catalogue of pernicious works which are likely to\r\ncause mischief and which on this ground have been prohibited, together\r\nwith instructions for the identification of such dangerous writings for\r\nextermination of same.”\r\n\r\nIn 1749, was printed at Prague a second and enlarged edition of this\r\n_Clavis_. In 1767, the Archbishop of Prague, Przichovsky, printed,\r\nin obedience to an encyclical of Clement XIII, an Index presenting\r\nBohemian books only. The title is: _Index Bohemicorum librorum\r\nprohibitorum et corrigendorum et ordine alphabetico digestus_, etc. In\r\nthe _Clavis_ of 1729, the _Index prohibitorius_ is arranged in three\r\nalphabeted divisions, the first including the works in Czech, the\r\nsecond those in German, and the third the Latin titles, with which\r\nare certain in French. Following each division, are given certain\r\nblank pages left for the description of further books. In the second\r\nedition is given a special division entitled _Index librorum Veneria\r\nvel obscoena tractantium_, presenting a list of works the obscene\r\ncharacter of which can fairly be inferred from their titles. It is\r\nnoteworthy that this very legitimate division of censorship, which\r\nreceived very little attention either in Rome or in Spain, should have\r\nbeen cared for in Bohemia. Beneath the titles of the books in the list\r\nfor expurgation, are given as a rule brief analyses constituting what\r\nmight be called a _catalogue raisonnée_, for instance, _perstringuntur\r\nreligiosi Societatis Jesu_, etc. Against such a name as that of Huss\r\nis added the term “heretic” or “arch-heretic.” The compiler of the\r\n_Clavis_ was a Jesuit, Anton Koniasch. Koniasch left at his death\r\n(in 1760) materials for a further Index which were utilised as the\r\nbasis of the Index printed in 1767 by Przichovsky. The title proposed\r\nby Koniasch was: _Index librorum perniciosorum abolendorum vel\r\nrepurgandorum_, etc. In the Index as published by the Archbishop, is\r\nthe order that his pastoral brief, together with the encyclical of the\r\npope, shall, within three weeks’ time, be read on the Sunday in all\r\nGerman and Bohemian churches, and that, on the same day, a sermon shall\r\nbe given devoted to the danger of heretical books. He orders further\r\nthat whoever shall be convicted of reading heretical or prohibited\r\nbooks shall _ipse jure_ come under excommunication. This is followed by\r\nan edict, issued by Charles VI and confirmed in 1749 by Maria Theresa,\r\nin regard to the distribution of heretical books. This Index is both\r\nprohibitory and expurgatory, but the two sets of titles are arranged\r\nin one alphabet. It contains also an enlarged edition of the Bohemian\r\ndivision of the _Clavis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=4. Editions of the Roman Indexes, 1670–1800.=\r\n\r\n_1670._ _Rome._ _Clement X._ In 1670, under the instructions of Clement\r\nX, Fanus prints an Index which contains the lists of Alexander and of\r\nClement, with an appendix bringing the record of prohibitions down to\r\ndate. This volume is again printed in 1675, with an appendix covering\r\nthe prohibitions of five years.\r\n\r\n_1681._ _Rome._ _Clement XI._ In 1681, under the instructions of\r\nClement XI, Jacobus Riccius again reprints the same lists and decrees\r\nwith supplements. An edition of this Index of 1681 was printed in\r\nMunich in 1683. Riccius states in his preface that, in addition to\r\nthe including of the titles of the later prohibitions, he has found\r\noccasion for a number of corrections, both in the titles and in\r\nthe names of the authors. The editors of the Roman Indexes are now\r\nbeginning to show some regard for bibliographical completeness and\r\ntypographical accuracy.\r\n\r\nA second impression of the Riccius Index was printed in Rome in 1682,\r\nand a third edition appeared in 1739, printed without change, and the\r\nlater prohibitions are recorded in a series of appendices. Between the\r\nyears 1704 and 1744, were also printed various editions of this Index,\r\nin which the titles of the works prohibited from 1704 to 1739 find\r\nplace in the main alphabet. Reusch points out, however, that from 1682\r\nto 1754 no official edition of an Index was printed in Rome. A number\r\nof Indexes bearing the imprint of the Apostolic printing-office were\r\nas a matter of fact manufactured elsewhere, chiefly in Venice.[206]\r\nRiccini, or Riccius, who served from 1749 to 1759 as secretary of the\r\nIndex Congregation, states that for more than seventy years no official\r\neditions of the Index were printed in Rome; and that the editions\r\nissued from the presses of Venice, presenting the false imprints of\r\nthe Roman office, contained many blunders and were not to be accepted\r\nas authoritative. The official and approved editions must in any case\r\ninclude an introductory word from the secretary of the Congregation.\r\n\r\nThe Index of Clement XI contains, as first printed, one alphabeted\r\nlist. In later editions, this list is followed by appendices which,\r\nby the year 1734, had aggregated five. The first of these appendices\r\nhas the epithet _Unica_. It is suggested that this term indicates\r\nthat the appendix has been substituted for a previous faulty appendix.\r\nIt is Hannot’s understanding that the fault in the cancelled appendix\r\nconsisted in a condemnation which had been almost immediately revoked.\r\n\r\nIn this same Appendix _Unica_ appears for the first time in an Index\r\nthe name of Fénelon, Archbishop of Cambray. The work condemned is\r\n_Explications des Maximes des Saints_. The particular offence in the\r\nvolume is understood by Mendham to have been the acceptance by Fénelon\r\nof the views of the mystical Spanish nun, Sor d’Agreda. There were\r\nevidently, however, some other matters in Fénelon’s volume which were\r\nfound to be dangerous, as the Pope, Innocent XII, found occasion to\r\nissue in regard to it a special _Constitution_ in which were condemned\r\ntwenty-three propositions extracted from Fénelon’s _Explications_. The\r\nperusal of the work was forbidden, under pain of excommunication, to\r\nall the faithful without exception. The _Constitution_ bears date,\r\nMarch 12, 1699. In the same year, there was issued at Paris an _Arrêt\r\nde la Cour de Parlement_ enregistering the letters patent of the king\r\nfor the execution of this _Constitution_. The Archbishop appears to\r\nhave accepted without protest the condemnation of the Pope and the\r\nauthority of the High Court of Parliament.\r\n\r\n_1704._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--_Index Librorum Prohibitorum\r\nInnoc. XII. P.M. jussu. editus. Usque ad Annum 1681. Eidem accedit in\r\nfine Appendix usque ad mensem Junii._\r\n\r\n_1711._ _Rome Index: Prohibitorius._ This Index, issued under the\r\nauthority of Clement XI, has no prefatory matter and simply extends up\r\nto the date of 1710 the lists of the next preceding Roman Index.\r\n\r\n_1744._ _Rome. Index Prohibitorius._ This Index is characterised as\r\ndistinctive in the absence of all the customary prefatory articles\r\nexcepting the _Regulae_. Among the works prohibited is a treatise of\r\nthe Jesuit Benzi, which had some importance in the controversies of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n_1750._ _Rome._ _Index Prohibitorius._--This is a reprint of the above\r\nwith additions to 1750.\r\n\r\n_1785–1798._ _Rome._ _Decrees of Prohibition._ During the period above\r\nspecified, there was published at Rome a weekly journal under the title\r\nof the _Giornale Ecclesiastico_. The series for the thirteen years\r\ncovers thirteen volumes. This journal was utilised for the publication\r\nof the decrees issued against specific books by the authorities of\r\nthe Church. The first work receiving the compliment of such special\r\ncondemnation was a treatise of Eybel entitled _Was ist der Pabst?_ The\r\nauthor is characterised as one of the ancient enemies of the Apostolic\r\nSee. Excommunication is ordered against any readers, possessors, or\r\nprinters of the work and the absolution or relaxation of the penalty is\r\nreserved to the pope excepting in the moment of death. A later volume\r\ncontains a regular decree by the Congregation of the Index in which are\r\ncondemned twenty-four different works. In the fourth volume appears\r\namong other titles the _Pensées_ of Pascal, with Voltaire’s Notes.\r\nThe volume contains also a specification of the dogmatic constitution\r\nissued by the pope against the Council of Pistoria. Mendham refers\r\nto the Memoirs of De Ricci as containing an explanation of this\r\ncondemnation.\r\n\r\n_5._ _1815._ _Madrid._ _Index Prohibitorius._--The lists in this Index,\r\nwhich is issued as usual under the authority of the inquisitor-general\r\n(only recently restored to power) are devoted almost exclusively to\r\nSpanish publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                    ERASMUS AND LUTHER IN THE INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. Erasmus in the Index.=--The treatment accorded by the compilers of\r\nthe Indexes of the 16th century to the writings of Erasmus is entitled\r\nto separate reference, if only because the variety of the successive\r\nprohibitions and classifications gives evidence of the difficulties\r\nexperienced by the authorities of the Church in maintaining any\r\nconsistency of policy in regard to the supervision of critical\r\nliterature. The position of Erasmus among the leaders of thought of\r\nhis time was, of course, in many respects exceptional. His varied and\r\ncomprehensive attainments placed him among the first scholars of the\r\nworld. He united with scholarship a keen sense of humour, an incisive\r\nand forcible literary style, and a courage of opinion which were not\r\nhampered by any large measure of reverence for authority or tradition.\r\nHis writings, in their original Latin form, found their way in the\r\nfirst place to the educated circles of the upper classes and of the\r\nmore liberal-minded of the ecclesiastics, while the versions in the\r\nvernacular which speedily followed, in both authorised and unauthorised\r\neditions, were taken up with cordial appreciation by all classes of\r\nreaders throughout Europe. In fact, in popularity, as far as popularity\r\nis to be gauged by the extent of circulation, the books of Erasmus were\r\nsurpassed only by the writings of Luther, while the range of their\r\ndistribution --that is, the extent of the territory reached and the\r\nvariety of the circles of readers by whom they were welcomed--must have\r\nbeen much in advance of anything attained by the writings of Luther.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of Erasmus on the abuses which had grown up in the Church\r\nwere of course a most important factor in bringing about the conditions\r\nthat made the Reformation possible, and in fact inevitable; but\r\nErasmus fought for reform within the Church of which he always held\r\nhimself to be a dutiful son. He refused from the outset to take part\r\nwith the Protestant assault on the authority of the Church universal,\r\nand his scholarship and influence were undoubtedly a most important\r\ninfluence in helping to maintain this authority against the fierce\r\nantagonism of the Lutheranism of Germany and the Calvinism of Geneva.\r\nAnd yet at the very time when the reformers of Wittenberg, in their\r\nkeen disappointment that they were not to have in their long fight the\r\nco-operation of the great scholar who had so fully realised and so\r\ntrenchantly assailed the evils against which they were revolting, were\r\ncondemning the writings of Erasmus as unchristian and time-serving,\r\nthe censors of Rome were placing these same books on the Index as\r\nconstituting serious heresy. From Wittenberg, were hurled fierce\r\ndenunciations of the trimmer, the time-server, the man who was sinning\r\nagainst the light; while from Rome came bitter charges of heresy\r\nagainst the insidious enemy of the true Faith, against the man who,\r\ntrained in the Church, was using his scholarship to undermine its\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nErasmus stood practically alone in the world of belief and of\r\ndisbelief. He had no sympathy with the doctrines of either Luther or\r\nCalvin. He could not accept the theory of individual interpretation\r\nof religious truth. He believed in a Church universal. He looked\r\nand worked for the time when this world’s Church, shaking off the\r\ncorruption, the worldliness, and the vulgarity by which it had become\r\ndemoralised, should, under the leadership of scholars, wise, sane,\r\ntolerant, and pure-minded, resume its authority over all Christian\r\nbelievers. To this end, he continued to denounce and to hold up to\r\nridicule, as the worst enemies of the Church, the intolerant bigots and\r\nthe vulgar corruptionists whose actions were bringing it into disrepute\r\nand strengthening the hands of the reformers.\r\n\r\nAn English scholar presents as follows the position of Erasmus:\r\n\r\n   “It is the conclusion of Erasmus that the Bible, learning,\r\n   criticism, humanism, are each and all incomplete as guides to\r\n   man without the permanent interpretative power and historic\r\n   witness of the visible institution ordained by Christ Himself.\r\n   His appeal is always to Christ; but it is inconceivable to him\r\n   that Christ should be apart from His Church or the Church from\r\n   Him.... As critic and as historian, Erasmus found it impossible\r\n   to say that Christ was right and that the fundamental principles\r\n   of the continuous Church were wrong. Thus, what the Church\r\n   had regarded as essential doctrines were and must remain the\r\n   permanent, unalterable bases of loyalty to the Lord.... Erasmus\r\n   believed in the Church not as a congeries of disintegrating\r\n   elements, not as a rigid and inflexible machine, but as a\r\n   sacred institution divinely instituted and divinely inspired,\r\n   and because it was ever in touch with divine life continually\r\n   growing and developing into the knowledge of the truth.... The\r\n   Church was to him the body of Jesus Christ, and in Christ he\r\n   profoundly believed; and, so believing, he was not impatient,\r\n   not afraid to wait for light.”[207]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the Congregation of the Index found\r\ndifficulty in classifying the writings of Erasmus. The predecessors\r\nof Paul IV had held these writings in favourable consideration, and\r\nto certain works had given distinct approval; and they had in various\r\ninstances extended to the author protection against attacks.[208] In\r\n1516, Leo X praised his “sound morality, his rare scholarship, and\r\nhis distinguished services,”[209] and had accepted the dedication of\r\nhis New Testament. The second edition of the New Testament contains\r\nan appreciative letter from Leo, dated September 10, 1518. Adrian VI,\r\nwriting in December, 1522, assures Erasmus that he gave no credence to\r\nthose who described him as a follower of Luther, and exhorts him to\r\ncontinue the work of writing against the heretics. In January, 1523,\r\nthe Pope thanks him for the gift of the _Arnobius_.[210] Paul\r\nIII, in a brief of May, 1535, speaks of “having always held in esteem\r\nthe honoured name of Erasmus,” and refers to his great learning and\r\neloquence, and to his contests against the pernicious new errors.[211]\r\n\r\nIn August, 1535 (a year before the death of Erasmus), Paul appointed\r\nhim Provost of Deventer, by reason of his learning, his piety, and\r\nthe great services he had rendered to the Curia in his sturdy fight\r\nwith the apostates from the Faith.[212] Later, the Pope spoke of\r\nwishing to make him cardinal.[213] The chief opponent of Erasmus\r\namong the prelates of Rome was Aleander. Aleander prides himself on\r\nhaving, as he believes, disposed Erasmus favourably towards himself,\r\nbecause he hopes thus to be able to check Erasmus’s opportunities\r\nfor working further mischief.[214] Another antagonist of Erasmus was\r\nEdward Lee, who, in 1532, became Archbishop of York. He wrote three\r\ntreatises in criticism of the Erasmus edition of the New Testament.\r\nOn the other hand, Erasmus found bitter assailants among such German\r\nReformation leaders as Luther, v. Hutten, Bucer, Corvinus, and others.\r\nSome of the anti-Erasmus treatises of these writers find place in\r\nthe Index. The ninth volume of the works of Erasmus is made up of\r\nthe replies to his Protestant critics. From France, also, came sharp\r\ncriticisms against the writings of Erasmus, but these were the work\r\nof orthodox authorities such as the theologians of the Sorbonne, and\r\nthe inquisitor-general. The Sorbonne sent out, between 1525 and 1530,\r\na number of condemnations of different books of Erasmus, but these\r\ncontinued to come into print in Paris, with or without “privilege.” In\r\n1531, appeared, under the permission of King Francis, editions of the\r\n_Paraphrases_ and of the _Colloquia_.[215] In 1542, after the\r\ndeath of Erasmus, the Sorbonne issued a general condemnation of his\r\nwritings, the list comprising fifteen titles.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, Erasmus had the protection of the Emperor Charles\r\nV. No one of his books finds place in the Louvain Indexes of 1546 and\r\n1550. In that of 1558, is printed only the title of the French version\r\nof the treatise _De Sarcienda Eccl. Concordia_. In the Indexes of\r\nItaly, the name of Erasmus appears first in 1559, in the Index of Paul\r\nIV. In Spain, Quiroga repeats, in the Index of 1583, the titles given\r\nin the Index of Trent. In 1576, Paul Manutius printed in Florence,\r\nunder a “privilege” of Gregory XIII, an expurgated edition of the\r\n_Adagia_. The privilege carried with it a prohibition of all other\r\neditions. The Index of Sixtus V specifies this edition as permitted,\r\nall others as condemned. The Index of Benedict XIV repeats the\r\nauthorisation for the Manutius edition, and confirms the prohibition of\r\nthe others unless expurgated.\r\n\r\nThe editors of the Index of Paul IV (1559) took a very serious view of\r\nthe evils of the writings of Erasmus. His name is placed in Class I,\r\nand is connected with a condemnation more sweeping than that given to\r\nLuther or to Calvin; “with all of his Commentaries, Remarks, Notes,\r\nDialogues, Letters, Criticisms, Translations, Books, and Writings,\r\nincluding even those which contain nothing concerning Religion.” This\r\njudgment was, however, materially modified five years later by the\r\nTridentine compilers, by whom, after some heated discussions, the\r\nname of Erasmus was transferred to Class II. _The Colloquies, Praise\r\nof Folly, Institution of Christian Matrimony_, and the _Paraphrases_\r\n(of the Gospel of Matthew) were condemned, as also certain of the\r\n_Letters_. Others of the _Letters_ were restored to the class of\r\npermitted literature, but only after such eliminations and alterations\r\nthat (as the chronicler remarks) they would not have been recognised\r\nby their author[216] (Erasmus had died in 1536). The record of the\r\ndiscussions in the commission is given in a letter written from Trent,\r\nin 1563, by the Archbishop of Prague to the Emperor (Ferdinand I).\r\nThe Archbishop states that he had himself contended for the freeing\r\nof the works of Erasmus from condemnation on the ground that he had\r\nalways submitted himself to the judgment of the Church; that his\r\nliterary undertakings had received the approval of Leo X; that he had\r\nbeen engaged in many sharp contests with the heretical assailants of\r\nthe Church; that he had devoted to the editing of the writings of the\r\nFathers a scholarship of which the heretics might well envy the Church\r\nthe possession, and that he had died in the Faith. The Archbishop goes\r\non to say that the majority of his associates were of another way of\r\nthinking, and had overborne the views of the few who wanted to secure\r\nthe preservation of the works of an author who had done such signal\r\nservice for the Church. He closes by asking the Emperor to relieve\r\nhim from service on the commission. He finds it difficult to work in\r\nharmony with the churchmen from Spain and Italy who have no personal\r\nknowledge of the heretics who are trying to destroy the Church.\r\nThe Emperor replied that the Archbishop, as the only German on the\r\ncommission, had been continued at his post to do what he might find\r\npossible to prevent the condemnation of any further works and authors\r\nof excellence.[217]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Tridentine Index orders placed in Class I all\r\nauthors who may have come under suspicion of heresy (_nota haeresis\r\nsuspecti_), a description which may be called elastic, and which\r\nwould naturally be subject to varying interpretation on the part of\r\ndifferent persons in authority. Among the associates or correspondents\r\nof Erasmus who were placed by the Tridentine editors in the first\r\nclass and who have since remained under this general condemnation,\r\nare Staupitz, Pirckheimer, Hauer, and Bellicanus. Rhenanus and Zasius\r\nwere transferred in the Trent lists from Class I, where they had been\r\nplaced by Paul, to Class II, where they have since remained.\r\n\r\nThe chief associate of Erasmus in the contest in Germany against the\r\nopposition of a large group at least among the ecclesiastics, in behalf\r\nof what may be called higher scholarship, was Reuchlin, who gave\r\nyears of his life to the work of securing for the German universities\r\nthe privilege of instruction in Greek and in Hebrew. After 1518,\r\nwhen a number of the works of Erasmus had already found place in the\r\nIndex, the printers issuing editions of these within the territories\r\ncontrolled by Church censorship found it convenient to omit from the\r\ntitle-pages the name of their author. Such editions were issued, for\r\ninstance, in 1520 by Paul Manutius, the son of Aldus, bearing on the\r\ntitle-page and in the catalogue, in place of the name of Erasmus, the\r\nwords, _Batavus quidam homo_.\r\n\r\nIn the Index of 1559, the name of Erasmus is placed under the class of\r\n_Auctores quorum libri et scripta omnia prohibentur_. After the\r\nentry of the name, however, comes the following specification: _cum\r\nuniversis Commentariis, Annotationibus, Scholiis, Dialogis, Epistolis,\r\nCensuris, Versionibus, Libris et Scriptis suis, etiam si nil penitus\r\ncontra Religionem, vel de Religione contineant_. Mendham refers to\r\nthis as an illustration of the term _De omnibus Rebus et quibusdam\r\naliis_. It may be recalled, in this connection, that as a result of\r\nthe dedication to Leo X printed by this condemned writer in the first\r\nedition of his annotated Greek Testament, issued in 1516, the Pope\r\naddressed to Erasmus a letter published in the second, and in every\r\nsubsequent, edition of the work, highly commending this production\r\nof his dear son. The letter contains the following expressions:\r\n_Quas nuper a te recognitas, et pluribus editis annotationibus,\r\nlocupletatas, illustratasque fuisse certiores facti, non mediocriter\r\ngavisi fuimus, ex prima illa editione quae absolutissima videbatur,\r\nconjecturam facientes, qualis haes futura, quantumve boni, sacrae\r\nTheologiae studiosis, ac orthodoxae fidei nostrae sit allatura_.[218]\r\n\r\nIf, at this stage in the history of the Church, the utterance of the\r\nreigning pope was already to be accepted as infallible, it is somewhat\r\ndifficult to understand how to bring into accord with these conclusions\r\nthe condemnation of half a century later, issued under the authority of\r\nthe no less infallible Pius IV. A similar instance had occurred earlier\r\nin the reign of Pius II, who found occasion to include in the list of\r\nwritings by Catholic ecclesiastics to be condemned a treatise written\r\nby himself eighteen years earlier under the title _Aeneae Sylviae\r\ncommentaria de actis et gestis Concilii Basileen_. This condemnation\r\nis confirmed in the Tridentine Index in the following words: _In\r\nactis Aeneae Sylviae prohibentur ea quae ipse in Bulla retractationis\r\ndamnavit_. Mendham speaks of this Bull as an example of a change of\r\nopinion similar to that described by another pope confronted with a\r\nsimilar difficulty, who explained that “when he was raised higher he\r\nsaw things more clearly.”[219]\r\n\r\nIn 1522, the sale and the perusal of the _Colloquies_ of Erasmus,\r\nan authorised edition of which had been printed by Colines, were\r\ninterdicted by the censors of the Sorbonne. Erasmus reports that before\r\nthe date of the prohibition, no less than twenty-four thousand copies\r\nof this Paris edition had been sold.\r\n\r\nIn 1528, Erasmus made application for a privilege for the publication\r\nin France of his edition of the works of St. Augustine, but the\r\ninfluence of the Sorbonne was sufficient to prevent the permit being\r\ngiven. The reason why Erasmus considered it important to have this work\r\nissued from Paris was that the Paris University was at the time the\r\ncentre for theological undertakings, as the University of Bologna was\r\nfor instruction in jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nErasmus was able to write in regard to the _Praise of Folly_ that\r\nthe pope “had read it through from beginning to end and that kings,\r\nbishops, archbishops, and cardinals were delighted with it.”[220]\r\nThe favour given to the book by the pope and by not a few of the\r\nscholarly ecclesiastics did not prevent its prohibition in many of the\r\nuniversities, including Paris, Louvain, Oxford, and Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of the _Praise of Folly_ carried with it the\r\ncondemnation of the previous writings of the author. This is the\r\nliterature, cried the clergy, that comes from a knowledge of Greek.\r\n\r\nIn 1515, Erasmus took time from his literary work to interest himself\r\nin behalf of his friend, the learned and high-minded Reuchlin, the\r\ngreatest Hebrew scholar of the day. Reuchlin had fallen under the\r\npersecution of the Dominicans, led by the ignorant and bigoted\r\nHoogstraaten, for his opposition to the diabolical proposal to destroy\r\nall existing Hebrew literature, the Scriptures alone excepted. He had\r\ndefended himself in a book entitled the _Speculum Oculare_ (the\r\nEyeglass), and on a mandate being issued by Hoogstraaten to burn this,\r\nReuchlin had appealed from the Inquisition to the pope. The Bishop of\r\nSpeyer, to whom Leo committed the case, gave judgment in favour of\r\nReuchlin and imposed on his enemies perpetual silence, a sentence\r\nwhich proved difficult of execution. Reuchlin was condemned by the\r\nuniversities of Mayence, Erfurt, Louvain, and Paris, although there\r\nwere at the time professorships of Hebrew both in Louvain and in Paris.\r\nThe matter was in some fashion again brought before the pope, to whom\r\nan earnest and eloquent appeal was made by Erasmus on behalf of his\r\nfriend. The support of the Emperor Maximilian was also secured for\r\nthe aged scholar who had done so much to bring honour to the cause\r\nof learning in Germany and in Europe. The pope finally confirmed the\r\nprevious decision in favour of Reuchlin, a decision which rescued from\r\nthe status of heresy, in which it had been placed by the Dominicans and\r\nthe learned faculties of the universities, the language of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures and the literature of the chosen people of God. Reuchlin’s\r\nbooks were rescued from the ban and their learned author was saved from\r\nthe risk of the stake.[221]\r\n\r\nThe _Colloquies_ of Erasmus were published in 1518, and were reprinted\r\nin a long series of editions authorised and unauthorised. One printer\r\nin Paris, learning that the university was about to condemn the work,\r\nbrought into circulation no less than twenty thousand copies.[222] This\r\nconstitutes a curious example of the influence that could be exerted by\r\nan official condemnation in bringing about for the work an immediate\r\nand extended demand for a book. The writings of Erasmus were condemned\r\n_in toto_, in 1550, in the Spanish Index of that date.\r\n\r\nIn 1539, the interest of Francis in scholarship, and the influence\r\nof Budaeus caused him to invite Erasmus to Paris to take part in the\r\norganisation of a royal college. The Emperor (Charles V) put an end\r\nto the negotiation by forbidding Erasmus (under the penalty of the\r\nstoppage of his pension) to leave the territory of the empire. It is\r\ninteresting to think of the most Catholic Emperor on the one hand,\r\nand the “eldest son of the Church” on the other, contending for the\r\nservices of the scholar whose writings had been condemned in Rome as\r\nheretical and were prohibited in Spain, and who could not at this time\r\nobtain from the Paris University a printing-privilege.\r\n\r\nAmong the cultivated Spaniards assembled at the court of Charles V,\r\nErasmus became for the time the fashion. His writings secured the\r\napproval even of some of the highest dignitaries of the Spanish Church.\r\nThe Inquisitor-General, Manrique, declared Erasmus to be another\r\nJerome and Augustine. The Archbishop of Toledo wrote, when Erasmus was\r\nunder criticism, assuring him of the protection and good-will of the\r\nemperor. The _Colloquies_ were used as a schoolbook and the _Praise\r\nof Folly_ was in the hands of all Humanists. In March, 1527, Valdes\r\nwrote to Erasmus that his books were everywhere in Spain and that no\r\nmerchandise was more salable.[223] In 1527 was published a Castilian\r\nversion of the _Manual of the Christian Soldier_, and in the same\r\nyear, under the leadership of Dr. Edward Lee, English ambassador in\r\nSpain, a session of the supreme council of the Inquisition was called\r\nto make thorough examination of the alleged heresies in the writings\r\nof Erasmus. A list of twenty-one such heresies was framed by the\r\nexaminers. The charges were finally referred to an assembly of twenty\r\ntheologians and nine friars who gave to the investigation months of\r\ndebate, but who arrived at no conclusion. Charles V was persuaded to\r\nwrite an imperial missive in favour of Erasmus, and Clement VII issued,\r\nin 1527, a brief imposing silence on all who should attack the writings\r\nin so far as these concerned Luther. Manrique issued, on behalf of the\r\nSpanish Inquisition, an absolute prohibition of any writings against\r\nErasmus. The influence of the antagonists of Erasmus finally, however,\r\nprevailed. In 1535, a year before the death of the author, Charles V\r\nmade it a capital offence to use the _Colloquies_ in schools, and in\r\n1538 he issued a prohibition covering the _Praise of Folly_ and most\r\nof the other works, excepting, however, the _Christian Soldier_. In\r\nthe Spanish expurgatory Index of 1584, Erasmus occupies no less than\r\nfifty-five quarto pages. By 1640, the list of the errors of Erasmus\r\ncalls for no less than fifty-nine folio pages in double columns. By\r\nthis time he had come to be classed with the incorrigible heretics, and\r\nthe words “_auctoris damnati_” are ordered to be inserted after his\r\nname on all title-pages. This was the final judgment of the Spanish\r\nInquisition on Erasmus. A different view of the nature and value of the\r\nwork done by Erasmus is taken by Catholic scholars of the twentieth\r\ncentury, although I do not venture to say that this view is general,\r\neven among the scholars of the Church. Father Shahan, of the Catholic\r\nUniversity of America, for instance, says (in 1899) (speaking to be\r\nsure informally):\r\n\r\n   “Erasmus rendered noteworthy service to the Church, to religion,\r\n   and to scholarship. He was the counsellor of moderation, the\r\n   upholder of scholarly standards, the pitiless critic and the\r\n   courageous antagonist of fraud and of folly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=2. Luther.=--It is with the work of Luther that there begins to be a\r\nlarge production and a wide distribution of books in German. Up to this\r\ntime the undertakings of the German printers had been restricted almost\r\nexclusively to books in Latin. The immediate distribution, however, of\r\nthe writings of Luther and his associates, not only among the trade\r\nfolk and working people of the towns, but through the rural districts,\r\nconstitutes an evidence that the general intelligence and the education\r\nof the mass of the people had reached a much higher development than\r\nthe Protestant historians of the time have been willing to admit. It is\r\nto be remembered that the readers whom Luther was reaching belonged to\r\nthe generation which had depended for its education exclusively upon\r\nthe monastery schools, or upon schools which were entirely under the\r\ndirection of the priests. The work of the reformers was essentially a\r\nwork of argument, and it could have been carried on successfully only\r\nwith people who were intelligent enough to understand arguments whether\r\npresented orally or in print. That the community was as intelligent\r\nand as receptive as proved to be the case, shows how exaggerated and\r\nill-considered are the conclusions presented by Protestant historians\r\nrepresented by D’Aubigné, Robertson, and others in regard to the\r\nabsolute ignorance in which the Catholic teachers had left their\r\nfollowers. Kapp reports that of Luther’s treatise on German theology\r\nno less than seventy editions were printed between the years 1518 and\r\n1854. Of the _Address to the German Nobility_, four thousand copies\r\nwere sold in five days. Of the first edition of the New Testament,\r\nprinted in Wittenberg in 1522, five thousand copies were sold within\r\nthree months. There seems to have been no question that the emphasis\r\ngiven by the imperial and ecclesiastical censorship to the importance\r\nof Luther’s writings constituted an important factor in bringing these\r\nto the attention of the public, and in securing for them the largest\r\npossible circulation.\r\n\r\nLuther realised that, with hardly an exception, the scholarly divines\r\nof the university were antagonistic to him and to his work. He writes\r\nFebruary 8, 1516: _Nec cessant universitates bonos libros cremare et\r\ndamnare, rursum malos dictare, imo somniare_.[224]\r\n\r\nIn 1519, the doctors of Louvain published an edict ordering the\r\nburning of all copies that could be secured of the writings of Luther.\r\nA similar order was issued in 1520 by the divines of Cologne. Both\r\norders were printed in Wittenberg, in 1520, by Melchior Lottherus.\r\nIn 1521, the theological faculty of Paris issued an edict entitled\r\n_Determinationes Theologicae Facultatis Parisien. super Doctrina\r\nLutheriana_. The edict, which was printed in Wittenberg in the\r\nsame year, condemns a number of propositions from the treatise _De\r\nCaptivitate Babylonica_. The theological facility of Cologne issued,\r\nin 1532, a censure against the _Epitome of Abuses by a Reformed\r\nMonk_.[225]\r\n\r\nIn 1520, Cardinal Wolsey (in consequence of the Bull of Leo X\r\nagainst Luther, issued July 17th of that year) directed the English\r\nbishops to require that all the books and writings of one Martin\r\nLuther (_cujusdam M. L._) should be delivered up by all persons\r\npossessing them, under pain of the greater excommunication.[226]\r\n\r\nIn 1522, Luther brought into print his famous German version of the\r\nNew Testament; he printed of this a first impression of five thousand\r\ncopies and three months later a second impression of the same number.\r\nThe Bull of Leo X excommunicating Luther, issued in 1520, condemned his\r\nworks individually and collectively. The existing copies are ordered\r\nto be burned and all persons are prohibited, under severe penalties,\r\nfrom printing, selling, distributing, or possessing any of Luther’s\r\nwritings. The immediate effect of this Bull was to bring about a\r\nlargely increased sale throughout Germany for everything that Luther\r\nhad written, and to cause also a considerable demand for these writings\r\nin other countries. Köstlin estimates that by 1521 more than one\r\nhundred impressions had been printed of the German versions of Luther’s\r\nsermons and tracts. In 1564, the restrictions upon the publishers\r\nin regard to the printing of the Lutheran version of the Bible were\r\nremoved and, at the instance of the Duke of Weimer, this version became\r\ncommon property (_literärisches Gemeingut_) for all Germany and was\r\nformally declared free of privilege.\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the Lutheran tracts was taken charge of not only by\r\nthe book-pedlars and colporteurs but by a large number of travelling\r\npreachers, _Prädikanten_. These “preachers” were in part old-time\r\npriests, but in many cases laymen of varying degrees of education or\r\nof ignorance. During the troublous times of the war of the peasants,\r\nthe progress of the Reformation was checked and the circulation of the\r\nLutheran publications in the districts affected by the uprising was for\r\nthe time brought to a close.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of imperial Rome which (irrespective of the internal\r\ncauses) was brought about by persistent Teutonic onslaughts, terminated\r\nthe period of the world’s history which is, for convenience, called\r\nclassic or ancient. In like manner, the overthrow of the world-wide\r\ndomination of ecclesiastical Rome was brought about by the Teuton\r\nLuther, an attack which, supported by the Teutonic forces of North\r\nEurope, developed into a revolution against Italian rule, and\r\nterminated the epoch of mediaevalism. For long periods to come, the\r\nquestions raised by Luther and his fellow-Protestants were to bring\r\nanxieties and conflicts upon popes, emperors, princes, and people.\r\nThese questions were also to provide issues and themes for innumerable\r\nwriters, and to secure an apparently inexhaustible supply of material\r\nfor the printing-presses and the booksellers. It is not surprising that\r\nat an early period in the development of printing, ecclesiastics who\r\nwere fighting for the continued domination of the Church recognised\r\nthe press as a most seriously antagonistic influence, and that, during\r\na term of two centuries, they continued to attempt to put into force\r\nmachinery for the supervision and restriction of its undertakings. A\r\nscholarly American Catholic (speaking in 1905) makes reference to “the\r\ndistinctive service rendered by Luther in making clear to the Church\r\nthe necessity for reform, for recurrences to the earlier Christian\r\nideals, to the standards of Gregory the Great and of Benedict.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                THE JANSENIST CONTROVERSY AND THE BULL\r\n                              UNIGENITUS\r\n\r\n    1.

Controversial Writings on Theological Morality   1667–1730.\r\n\r\n\r\n=1. The Jansenist Controversy, 1641–1649.=--In 1641, was condemned\r\nby the Inquisition the _Augustinus_ of Cornelius Jansen, Bishop\r\nof Yprés, which had been published in the same year, three years after\r\nthe death of its author. The treatise was, it seems, classed among the\r\nwritings having to do with the prohibited subject _de auxiliis_.\r\n\r\nThe _Augustinus seu doctrina S. Augustini de humanae naturae sanitate,\r\naegritudine et medicina, adversus Pelagianas et Massilienses_, was\r\npublished in 1640, in three volumes folio. The first is devoted to a\r\nhistorical exposition of the Pelagian and Massilian (semi-Pelagian)\r\nheresies; the second sets forth the Augustinian doctrine as to the\r\nstate of innocence and the fallen state; while the third treats, in ten\r\nbooks, of the grace of Christ. The sting of the work is to be found in\r\nthe epilogue, which draws a parallel in various particulars between\r\nthe errors of the Massilians and those _recentiorum quorumdam_, the\r\nreference being to the Jesuits. In 1641, the book was prohibited by the\r\nInquisition, but no opinion was pronounced as to its doctrine, and the\r\nanswering treatises of the Jesuits were also condemned.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1642, a Bull of Urban VIII confirms this decree of the\r\nInquisition in spite of the continued pressure on the part of the\r\ndivines of Louvain to secure a modification of the original judgment.\r\n\r\nIn 1643, Urban VIII published the Bull _In eminenti_, renewing and\r\nconfirming the constitutions of Pius V and Gregory XIII and the\r\ndecree of Paul V, and forbidding the reading of the _Augustinus_. The\r\npublication of this Bull resulted in the production by Arnauld, in 1644\r\nand in 1645, of _Apologies for Jansen_, and was also the text for the\r\nfamous _Provincial Letters_ of Pascal, which appeared in 1656.\r\n\r\nIn 1651, eighty-five French bishops made representations in Rome\r\ncalling for the specific condemnation of five propositions contained\r\nin the treatise of Jansen. A statement was made a little later by\r\ncertain other bishops pointing out that the propositions in question\r\nwere open to a different interpretation from that named in the original\r\ncomplaint. The matter was referred to a special congregation of four\r\ncardinals, by whom it was again referred to a commission of thirteen\r\ntheologians selected by the Inquisition. This second commission gave\r\npermission to the two parties to submit, in writing or in person,\r\nfurther arguments in regard to the matter at issue. In May, 1653,\r\nInnocent X condemned, in a Bull, the five propositions.\r\n\r\nThe text of the five propositions is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. There are some commandments of God which just men, although willing\r\nand anxious to obey them, are unable with the strength they have to\r\nfulfil, and the grace by which they might fulfil them is also wanting.\r\n\r\n2. In the state of fallen nature, inward grace is never resisted.\r\n\r\n3. In the fallen state, merit and demerit do not depend on a liberty\r\nwhich excludes necessity, but on a liberty which excludes constraint.\r\n\r\n4. The semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity of an inward prevenient\r\ngrace for the performance of each particular act, and also for the\r\nfirst act of faith, and yet were heretical inasmuch as they maintained\r\nthat this grace was of such a nature that the will of man was able\r\neither to resist or to obey it.\r\n\r\n5. It is semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died or shed his blood for\r\nall men without exception.\r\n\r\nIn the Bull of May, 1653, _Cum occasione impressionis libri_, Innocent\r\nX pronounced the first four propositions to be heretical, while the\r\nfifth was declared to be false, with the addition that if it was\r\nintended to convey the meaning that Christ died only for the elect, it\r\nwas impious and blasphemous as well as heretical.\r\n\r\nThe Jansenists expressed themselves as willing to accept the authority\r\nof the Pope in condemning the five propositions in their heretical\r\nsense, but contended that these propositions had not been identified\r\nwith the teachings of Jansen. In September, 1654, the Pope declared\r\nthat the propositions were found in the _Augustinus_ of Jansen, and\r\nthat their condemnation as doctrines of Jansen was imperative. Arnauld\r\nand his associates in Port Royal contended that, while the Holy See had\r\nauthority to decide with respect to doctrine, and every good Catholic\r\nowed submission to such papal decisions, yet the See might be mistaken\r\non a question of fact, such for instance as to whether a given book\r\ncontained certain statements. The fullest account of the condemnation\r\nof the Jansenist doctrines is given by De Placette.[227]\r\n\r\nIn a decree of the Inquisition, issued in April, 1654, and cited in\r\na brief of Innocent of the same year, all writings are specifically\r\ncondemned which present and defend the doctrine contained in the\r\n_Augustinus_ of Jansen.\r\n\r\nIn 1657, this general prohibition was renewed and it stands in the\r\nlater Indexes under the term _libri_, and, since Benedict XIV, in the\r\n_Decreta Gen._, ii, 5. During the rule of Alexander VII (1655–1667)\r\nthe question again arose whether on the ground of the Bull of 1653\r\nit was necessary to conclude that Jansen really had taught the five\r\npropositions in the sense in which they had been condemned. Arnauld,\r\nwriting in 1655, took the ground that the Bull in no way decided this\r\nmatter of the actual interpretation of the propositions, but decided\r\nsimply that certain doctrine said to be contained in these propositions\r\nwas itself to be condemned. It was Arnauld’s contention, therefore,\r\nthat for devout believers a respectful silence (_silence respectueux_)\r\nconcerning the issue ought to be observed. One result of Arnauld’s\r\nstatement was his expulsion from the Sorbonne, which was followed by\r\nthe publication of the famous _Letters_ of Pascal. In October, 1656,\r\nAlexander VII issued a Bull declaring that the five propositions had\r\nbeen correctly cited from the book of Jansen, and that the sense in\r\nwhich they had been condemned was the sense that the author had in\r\nhis mind at the time of their writing. In this Bull, the Pope appears\r\nto make the claim, in regard to matters of dogma, of being able to\r\ndetermine the motives and the absolute purpose by which an author has\r\nbeen actuated in putting a statement into words.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, the main question turns upon the range or extent of\r\nthe authority of the Church and particularly of the infallibility (in\r\nthis matter of interpretation) of the pope. In a Bull of 1656, issued\r\nby Alexander VII as a result of an understanding with Louis XIV, it is\r\nordered that all bishops, priests, monks, and nuns shall subscribe to a\r\nformula of which the following is the substance:\r\n\r\n   “I accept in full the authority of the Bull of Innocent X of May\r\n   31, 1653, and the Bull of Alexander VII of October, 1656, and\r\n   I reject and condemn without reservation the five propositions\r\n   referred to in these Bulls cited from the _Augustinus_ of\r\n   Jansen, in the sense which the author intended should be given\r\n   to said propositions, in which sense said propositions have been\r\n   condemned by the Holy See. I solemnly swear to abide by this\r\n   statement, so help me God and the holy Apostles.”\r\n\r\nFour French bishops gave out in June, 1665, statements in which they\r\ndeclared that this formula was to be subscribed to with reservation\r\nin regard to the actual facts of doctrine contained in the series\r\nof papal bulls. These diocesan letters were themselves, in January,\r\n1667, prohibited by the Congregation of the Index. The negotiations\r\nof the pope with the French Government in regard to further action\r\nagainst the four bishops was interrupted by the death in May, 1667, of\r\nAlexander VII. Under Alexander’s successor, Clement IX, an agreement\r\nwas arrived at, the so-called “Peace of Clement,” by which the four\r\nbishops gave their signatures to the formula and addressed a memorial\r\nto the pope, stating that they were now prepared to condemn the five\r\npropositions without reservation of any kind in the sense in which\r\nthese propositions had already been condemned by the Holy See. During\r\nthe next ten years, the subscription to the formula was very generally\r\nmade throughout France, with the same specific statement as that given\r\nby the four bishops to the pope. In this manner was finally brought to\r\na close the Jansenist issue. In connection with this controversy, were\r\nplaced upon the Index the titles of some hundred books, monographs,\r\nand pamphlets, chiefly by French authors. The list includes no less\r\nthan twenty writings of Arnauld. The Spanish Index of 1707 contains\r\nthe condemnation of the original work of Jansen, and of the five\r\npropositions, together with a general prohibition of all writings\r\nsupporting these propositions. These hundred titles constituted but\r\na very small fragment of the enormous mass of literature that was\r\nbrought into print in France, in Holland, and in North Germany as a\r\nresult of the controversy. One work, especially characteristic of the\r\nspirit of the time, may deserve more specific mention; the calendar for\r\n1654, issued by certain Jesuits under the title of _La Déroute et\r\nla confusion des Jansénistes_, contains a frontispiece on copper;\r\ngiving on the one side a view of the pope surrounded by cardinals\r\nand prelates and a flash of lightning striking in front of the group\r\nat a hydra with five heads (the five propositions); on the other\r\nside of the plate is seated on a throne Louis XIV, to whom Justice\r\ntenders the sword. Below is a representation of Jansen with the wings\r\nof a bat, flying into the arms of Calvin and other heresiarchs who\r\nstand surrounded by monstrosities representing error, ignorance, and\r\ndissipation. This group has, like the hydra, been struck by the flash\r\nof lightning emanating from the pope. The calendar was placed upon\r\nthe Index, which did not prevent it from securing a wide circulation.\r\nReusch speaks of a distribution during the first year of fourteen\r\nthousand copies.\r\n\r\n_Writings of the Jansenists. 1571–1711._ In 1571, Pius V condemned\r\nin a separate prohibition a French version of the _Officium pavum\r\nB. M. V._ that had been prepared by one of the theologians of\r\nPort-Royal. In 1661, Alexander VII issued a brief condemning in very\r\nsharp terms a French version of the Book of the Mass, prohibiting also\r\nin general terms all editions in the vernacular of the Book of the\r\nMass. In 1695, was prohibited a volume by Le Tourneaux, _L’Année\r\nChrétienne_, because its text included a French version of the\r\nprayers of the Mass. A later prohibition of translations of the prayers\r\nof the Mass which had been accepted by the Jansenists, although evoking\r\nprotests from the French bishops, was recalled. Benedict XIV recalled\r\nalso the prohibition of Alexander VII which had been issued in 1661,\r\nwith the general wording _Missale Romanum e Latino idiomate ad\r\nGallicam vulgarem linguam conversum et typis evulgatum_. In 1668,\r\na brief of Clement IX prohibits a translation of the New Testament\r\nwhich had been prepared by one of the divines of Port-Royal and\r\nwhich was known as the New Testament of Mons. This prohibition was,\r\nhowever, expressly limited to the edition in question, probably on\r\nthe ground of certain of the notes contained in it. Clement does not\r\nundertake any general prohibition of editions in the vernacular of\r\nthe Bible. In 1674, was prohibited a treatise issued under the title\r\nof _Monita Salutaria D. M. V._ This contains an argument against\r\ncertain abuses that had arisen in the worship of Mary. It was sharply\r\nassailed by the Jesuits and was defended by most of the opponents\r\nof Jesuitism. There also found their way into the Index a series of\r\nlater publications written to maintain the views of the _Monita_,\r\nincluding a treatise by Bailliet. A volume by Bailliet, presenting\r\na study of the Saints, was prohibited on the express ground that\r\nit was hypocritical in character. Bailliet had undertaken in his\r\nbiographies of the Saints to distinguish between the miracles and\r\nstories which were to be accepted, and others of which in his judgment\r\nthe records were untrustworthy. Benedict XIV presents the conclusion\r\nthat Bailliet had gone too far with his criticisms. He says[228]:\r\n_Homo vel certissimarum rerum veritatum, ut intemporenti ingenio\r\nest, sollicitans_. The Bishop Gapi, in 1711, prohibits the entire\r\nwork on the ground that a number of dogmas and disciplinary articles\r\nwere considered in it in a Jansenist or even a Protestant sense. The\r\nprohibitions had the effect, as was usually the case, of increasing the\r\nrepute and the circulation of the work, which was repeatedly reprinted.\r\n\r\nA treatise by Antoine Arnauld on frequent communion, published in 1643,\r\nwas promptly denounced by the Inquisition although it had secured the\r\napproval of the French bishops. In 1645, the Abbé Bourgois succeeded\r\nin securing a cancellation of the judgment of the Inquisition. A\r\ncentury later, a Jesuit reply to Arnauld’s treatise, written by Pichon,\r\ncame into the Index. In 1647, the Inquisition prohibited a volume by\r\nMartin de Bircos written in support of the doctrines presented by\r\nArnauld. Martin speaks of the Apostles Peter and Paul as the “two\r\nleaders” of the early Church, which constituted the chief ground for\r\nthe condemnation of the book, the authorities maintaining that the\r\nsubordination of Paul to Peter was the only sound doctrine. Since the\r\ntime of Benedict XIV, a general prohibition stands in the _Decreta\r\nGen._ under the term _libri_, of all writings maintaining any\r\nopinion adverse to the supremacy of Peter.\r\n\r\n_Controversies Connected with the Jansenist Contests._ During the\r\n17th century, were prohibited a number of writings appearing outside\r\nof France and the Netherlands, which, while not classed directly as\r\nJansenist, were concerned with the doctrine of Grace. In 1673, a\r\ntreatise by the Augustine Noris (who was made a cardinal in 1695,\r\nand who died in 1704) on Pelagianism and the doctrine of Grace, was\r\nrepeatedly condemned by the Jesuits and the Franciscans as containing\r\nJansenist heresies. The volume was brought to Rome for investigation\r\nthree times, and each time was declared to be sound in its orthodoxy. A\r\nnumber of other works which were denounced before the Roman authorities\r\nby the Jesuit leaders, on the ground of containing Jansenist heresies,\r\nthe Congregation refused to condemn. The authors were in large part\r\nDominicans and Augustinians who had brought into print the traditionary\r\ndoctrine of Grace as taught in their own schools. Cardinal Bona\r\ncomplained that during these years every one who was not a Molinist\r\nwas denounced by the Jesuits as a Jansenist. The Spanish Dominican,\r\nGonzalez de Rosende, and the French Oratorian Jeunin, are the only\r\ntheologians of note who come into the Roman Index during this period.\r\nThe Congregation condemned, in 1722, a censure of the faculty of Douay\r\nin which the Dominicans, Contenso and Massoulié, had been accused of\r\nbeing Jansenists. The edition of the work of St. Augustine, edited\r\nby the Benedictines of St. Maur, was accused of being tainted with\r\nJansenism, but the work succeeded in securing the approval of the\r\nRoman authorities. In 1704, a brief of Clement XI condemned a volume\r\nby Launoy, printed after the author’s death, in which the Augustinian\r\ndoctrine of Grace was sharply opposed. A brief of Clement IX, in 1668,\r\ncondemned the edition of the New Testament printed in Mons, the editors\r\nof which were charged with Jansenism.\r\n\r\n_La Bibliothèque Janséniste._ In 1722, the Jesuit Dominique de\r\nColonia, published under the title _Bibliothèque Janséniste_\r\na schedule of writings which the Jesuits classed as Jansenist in\r\ndoctrine. The list includes the titles of a number of works which had\r\nnot been prohibited in the Roman Indexes. In the Spanish Index of 1747,\r\nis included as an appendix this schedule of De Colonia reprinted from\r\nthe second edition of his work. In both lists is included the title of\r\na treatise by Cardinal Noris which, while more than once denounced in\r\nRome, had, after repeated examinations, secured from the authorities\r\na final approval. Application was made in 1748 by Benedict XIV to the\r\ninquisitor-general of Spain to cancel the condemnation of the treatise\r\nby Noris. This request received at the outset no consideration, but in\r\nconnection with a later personal appeal from the Pope to the King of\r\nSpain, the condemnation was rescinded in 1758.\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliothèque Janséniste_ was, in 1749, prohibited by the\r\nCongregation of the Index. In 1750, were prohibited the _Pasquille_\r\nwritten by the Jesuit, Ricchini, secretary of the Congregation.\r\nIn 1752, Patouillet published a largely extended edition of the\r\nBibliothèque under the title _Dictionnaire des Livres Jansénistes_. In\r\nthis edition, the name of Noris was omitted, but there were included a\r\nnumber of works which, after examination had been approved in Rome,\r\nsuch as for instance the treatises by the Augustinians, Bellelli and\r\nBerti. This _Dictionnaire_ was prohibited in 1754.\r\n\r\n_Pascal and Arnauld concerning the Morality of the Jesuits._ The famous\r\n_Letters_ of Pascal, which were issued in 1656 without the name of\r\nthe author, were promptly prohibited by the Inquisition in 1657. The\r\ntitle of the book has been continued in later Indexes in the class\r\nof anonymous writings. Certain defences of their doctrines against\r\nthe assaults of Pascal published by the Jesuits, were themselves\r\nprohibited. The most noteworthy of this group of Jesuit replies were\r\nthe treatises by Pirot and Daniel. A Latin edition of the Pascal\r\n_Letters_, published a year or two later under the name of Wendrockius,\r\nwas not prohibited, while a reply to the same, published under the\r\nname of Stubockius, was placed on the Index. The essay by Arnauld,\r\nprinted in 1643 under the title of _Théologie Morale du Jesuit_,\r\ncan be considered as a precursor of the Pascal _Letters_. In 1669\r\nand 1683, were printed the first two volumes of a work entitled _Le\r\nMorale pratique des Jesuits_, which was written by the Abbé de Pont\r\nChâteau. During the years 1689–1695, five additional volumes were\r\nissued under the same title, which were the work of Arnauld. The first\r\ntwo were prohibited but the last five escaped condemnation. In 1700,\r\nwas prohibited the _Teatro Jesuitico_, a monograph written against\r\nthe Jesuits by Le Tellier, which had been published forty-six years\r\nearlier. One matter which receives in these volumes of Arnauld a large\r\nmeasure of attention, the contest between the Jesuits and Bishop\r\nPalafox, was the subject during both the 17th and 18th centuries of a\r\nlarge amount of controversial writing, and plays an important part\r\nin the Spanish Index. A decree in the Roman Index of 1656 orders\r\neliminated from one volume of the Lyons edition of the Bellarmin six\r\npages which give the Jesuitical view of the decision presented in the\r\nbrief of Innocent X concerning this matter of Palafox. Palafox, who was\r\na Dominican, had been a bishop in Mexico, but in 1653, became Bishop\r\nof Osma where he died in 1659. It was in Osma that he came into issue\r\nwith the Spanish Jesuits and, in 1649, he presented to Innocent X a\r\nformidable brief or complaint against Jesuit theory and practice. In\r\n1648, the Pope gave a decision in favour of the Bishop.\r\n\r\n_Contests in the Netherlands, 1690–1712._ The contest in the\r\nNetherlands between the Jansenist and the Jesuit parties in the\r\nChurch became active after Precipiano, heretofore Bishop of Bruges,\r\nhad, in 1690, become Archbishop of Mechlin. In 1690, he attempted\r\nin union with the other bishops, to put into shape a formula or\r\ndeclaration which went far in advance of that issued by Alexander\r\nVII. Innocent XII, in a brief issued in February, 1695, ordered that\r\nsubscriptions should be required only for the formula of Alexander\r\nVII and that demand should be made, on the part of those giving this\r\nsubscription, for the condemnation of the famous propositions taken\r\nfrom the book of Jansen in their obvious or essential meaning (_in\r\nsensu obvio_) without reference to the sense that may have been\r\nintended by the author (_in sensu ab auctore intento_). At the\r\nsame time, the Pope ordered that no further references should be made\r\nin regard to the interpretation of the formula or the matter of the\r\nfive propositions, and the bishops were prohibited from making such\r\nquestion or requirement of interpretation a ground for the exclusion\r\nfrom office or from functions of any ecclesiastics, or that on the same\r\nground any ecclesiastic should be classed as a Jansenist. This decision\r\nmay be considered as a confirmation of the “Peace of Clement IX.” At\r\nthis time were prohibited a number of writings containing denunciations\r\nof Belgian Jansenists, and a number of other controversial writings,\r\nincluding a treatise by the Jesuit, Jacques de la Fontaine, who was\r\nthe confessor of Archbishop Precipiano. Precipiano on his part, in a\r\ndecree of January, 1695, undertook to prohibit Jansenist writings,\r\nand he secured in this year orders from the King of Spain (Charles\r\nII) under which all those suspected of Jansenist doctrines were to be\r\nruled out of office whether ecclesiastical or civil. As a result of\r\nfresh complaints presented in Rome, Innocent XII issues in July, 1696,\r\na second brief confirming the earlier one and declaring specifically\r\nthat no modifications should be made in the terms of the Bull or of\r\nthe formula of Alexander VII. In the years succeeding, there continued\r\nto be placed in the Index, apparently for the purpose of checking\r\nthe controversy, a number of writings against the Jansenists. The\r\nlist of writers includes Palazol and Desirant. In 1703, Precipiano\r\ntook fresh action against the Jansenists--Gerberon and Quesnel who,\r\nsince the death of Arnauld (in August, 1694) were held as the leaders\r\namong the French Jansenists in Belgium, were arrested under the\r\nauthority of the Roman Inquisition and of the Spanish Government, were\r\ntried and were declared to have fallen under excommunication. There\r\ncame into the Index lists, in connection with this later outbreak,\r\ncontroversial writings by Opstraet, Henricus a. S., Ignatio, and Fr.\r\nMartin. In January, 1695, Bishop Precipiano published, in the form\r\nof a diocesan decree, a small Index of his own which was devoted\r\nentirely to Jansenist writings. The sixty titles in the lists include\r\nvarious treatises of Arnauld, Huygens, Quesnel, Gilles de Witte, and\r\na number of anonymous controversial monographs. In Rome, no attention\r\nwas paid to this Index, and a remonstrance printed by Quesnel was\r\nnot even prohibited. Precipiano prohibits the reading, copying, or\r\ndistribution of a letter addressed to him in February, 1694, by\r\nHennevel, which letter concerned itself with the matter of the formula.\r\nThe Inquisition condemned this letter on the ground of the disobedience\r\nof the instructions of the pope for silence in regard to the subject\r\nand also because of certain ill-advised expressions, and Hennevel was\r\na few months later compelled to retract his utterance. A letter of\r\nPrecipiano, addressed to the court at Madrid, and written in 1695, says:\r\n\r\n   “It is impossible to rout out Jansenists from the Netherlands\r\n   unless the King accomplishes this through his own authority.\r\n   From Rome under the present Pope nothing is to be hoped. He\r\n   himself will do nothing and he leaves the responsibility to\r\n   the Congregations which were demanded by Cardinal Casanoti and\r\n   Bernini who are protectors of the Jansenist heresies.”[229]\r\n\r\nArnauld, who may be classed as among the most important of the\r\ndefenders of Jansenism, died in 1694. Very few of his writings had\r\nescaped the prohibition of the Index but the Memoirs of him written by\r\nQuesnel, _Histoire de la vie et des ouvrages de Monsieur Arnauld_,\r\nprinted in 1695, escaped condemnation. As late as 1704, however, was\r\nprohibited the treatise by Arnauld entitled _Instructions sur la\r\nGrâce selon l’écriture et les pères, avec l’exposition de la foire de\r\nl’Eglise Romaine touchant la Grâce et la predestination_.\r\n\r\n_The Church of Utrecht._ The issues between the two great divisions\r\nof Church opinion which were classed, speaking briefly, as Jansenist\r\nand Jesuit, were active also in Holland, although in that country\r\nthe Catholic Church had a comparatively small group of followers and\r\nthe direct Jesuit influence was itself inconsiderable. In Holland as\r\nin England, the question arose as to whether Catholics residing in\r\nProtestant lands were properly subject to local bishops or to Apostolic\r\nvicars. In England, during a series of centuries, Apostolic vicars\r\nhad exercised the control over the faithful and the larger number\r\nof the English Catholics did not come into relations with any local\r\nbishops. In Holland, however, the hierarchy of the Church had never\r\nbeen entirely destroyed. There remained, for instance, in active\r\nexistence chapters by which were elected archbishops of Utrecht who\r\nexercised control over the Catholics in the five suffragan bishoprics\r\nfor which, since the Reformation, no suffragan had been appointed. It\r\nwas contended on the one hand that these archbishops retained the full\r\nauthority of the office, even in the cases in which the office was\r\nheld not by the Archbishop of Utrecht but by an official taking his\r\ntitle from a foreign bishopric or archbishopric; on the other hand,\r\nthe view was maintained that since the Reformation, Holland possessed\r\nthe character of a mission land and that the archbishop possessed the\r\nfunctions only of an Apostolic vicar. These issues brought about a\r\nformal breach between those holding the two sets of opinions, when,\r\nin 1702, Clement XI deposed the Archbishop, Peter Codde, and named\r\nas Apostolic-vicar Theodor Cock. The latter was not permitted by\r\nthe Government of Holland to make his residence in the country and\r\nthe supervision of the “Dutch Mission” was therefore transferred to\r\nthe nuncius in Cologne. The chapters in Holland protested against\r\nthis measure and, after 1724, they elected in unbroken succession\r\narchbishops of Utrecht who, between 1742 and 1758, made appointments of\r\nbishops for the dioceses of Haarlem and Deventer. The breach was still\r\nfurther widened because the Chapters of Utrecht and Haarlem and the\r\necclesiastics belonging to these dioceses appealed for a decision of\r\na general council of the Church, not only in regard to the particular\r\npapal measures above specified, but also on the ground of the Bull\r\n_Unigenitus_. In 1707, were prohibited in a brief of Clement XI a long\r\nseries of works by Dutch writers having to do with the deposition of\r\nArchbishop Codde and, later in the year, came also into the Index a\r\nnumber of further treatises written in defence of the claim of the\r\nChurch of Utrecht. The most important works of this group were those\r\nof the Louvain jurist, van Espen, whose _Jus ecclesiasticum_ was\r\nprohibited in 1704 and whose name came into the Index in 1734 connected\r\nwith his entire series of writings.\r\n\r\n=2. The Bull Unigenitus.=--Pasquier Quesnel (1634–1719) published in\r\n1671, the first part of his _Commentary on the New Testament_. The\r\ncompleted work was prohibited in 1708, in a brief of Clement XI. In\r\n1675, Quesnel published an edition of the works of Leo the Great, the\r\nnotes to which he utilised for a defence of Gallican liberties. This\r\nwork was placed on the Index in 1676. In 1685, finding himself unable\r\nto subscribe to a document in condemnation of Jansenism, Quesnel\r\nretired from Orleans to Brussels. There, as a result in part of his\r\nassociation with Arnauld, he completed, in 1695, under the title of\r\n_Reflexions Morales sur le Nouveau Testament_, the _Commentary_, the\r\nfirst part of which had been issued in 1671.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of Louis XIV, Clement issued in September, 1713, the\r\nBull _Unigenitus_ in which the condemnation of the Commentary of\r\nQuesnel is confirmed and a hundred and one propositions selected from\r\nthe Commentary are specifically condemned. In the case of a number\r\nof these propositions, no specification is given in the Bull for the\r\nground of their disapproval, and it was contended by the supporters of\r\nQuesnel that it was not possible to point out in these any utterance of\r\nheresy or of unsound doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe following propositions may be cited as representing the character\r\nof the series:\r\n\r\n_79. Utile, et necessarium est omni tempore, omni loco, et omni\r\npersonarum generi studere, et cognoscere spiritum, pietatem, et\r\nmysteria Sacrae Scripturae_ (It is useful and necessary at all\r\ntimes, in every place, and for every sort of person, to study and know\r\nthe spirit, the piety, and the mysteries of Holy Scripture).\r\n\r\n_80. Lectis Sacrae Scripturae est pro omnibus_ (The reading of Holy\r\nScripture is for all).\r\n\r\n_81. Obscuritas sancta Verbi Dei non est laicis ratio dispensandi se\r\nipsos ab ejus lectione_ (The sacred obscurity of the Word of God is\r\nno reason for the laity to absolve themselves from the reading of it).\r\n\r\n_82. Dies Dominicus a Christianis debet sanctificari lectionibus\r\npietatis, et super omnia Sanctarum Scripturarum. Damnosum est velle\r\nChristianum ab hac lectione retrahere._ (The Lord’s day should be\r\nkept holy by Christians by pious reading, and above all by the reading\r\nof Holy Scripture. It is hurtful for a Christian to wish to withdraw\r\nfrom such readings).\r\n\r\n_83. Est illusio, sibi persuadere, quod notitia Mysteriorum Religionis\r\nnon debeat communicari foeminis, lectione sacrorum librorum. Non ex\r\nfoeminarum simplicitate, sed ex superba Virorum scientia, ortus est\r\nScripturarum abusus, et natae sunt haereses._ (It is a mistake to\r\nbelieve that knowledge of the mysteries of religion ought not to be\r\ncommunicated to women by the reading of the holy books. Not from the\r\nsimplicity of women, but from the haughty science of men has the abuse\r\nof the Scriptures arisen and have heresies been born.)\r\n\r\n_84. Abripere e Christianorum manibus Novum Testamentum, seu eis illud\r\nclausum tenere, auferendo eis modum illud intelligendi, est illis\r\nChristi os obturare_ (To tear the New Testament from the hands of\r\nChristians or to keep it closed to them by depriving them of this mode\r\nof understanding, is to stop for them the mouth of Christ).\r\n\r\n_85. Interdicere Christianis lectionem Sacrae Scripturae, praesertim\r\nEvangelii, est interdicere usum luminis filiis lucis, et facere ut\r\npatiantur speciem quondam excommunicationis_ (To forbid Christians\r\nthe reading of Holy Scripture, especially of the Gospel, is to forbid\r\nthe use of light to the children of light, and to make them suffer a\r\ncertain form of excommunication).[230]\r\n\r\nThe Bull was accepted and published by the Parliament of Paris and by\r\na majority of the faculty of the Sorbonne, and it was also published\r\nin the dioceses in the greater number of the bishoprics. The Cardinal\r\nNoailles, Archbishop of Paris, in making publication of the Bull, gives\r\nhis general approval with certain reservations which were held by the\r\nHoly See to be invidious and as tending to schism. The Cardinal’s brief\r\nwas itself condemned by the Inquisition. After the death of Louis XIV\r\n(September, 1715), the theological faculties of the Sorbonne and of the\r\nFrench universities made open declaration against the Bull, and no less\r\nthan thirty bishops declared that they had accepted the Bull only on\r\ncondition of certain reservations and explanations. The bishops made\r\napplications to the Regent to secure from the pope an interpretation of\r\nthe full purport of the hundred and one propositions and an explanation\r\nof the precise grounds for the condemnation of these. In 1717, four of\r\nthe French bishops made appeal to the general council for a decision\r\nin the matter. Later, other bishops, including Cardinal Noailles and a\r\nnumber of ecclesiastics and laymen, united in this appeal. This group\r\nwere given the name of Appellants and their opponents were called\r\nAcceptants or constitutionals. The question as to whether the hundred\r\nand one propositions were or were not heretical or erroneous, fell more\r\nand more into the background and the issue finally took the shape as\r\nto whether a dogmatic Bull was to be accepted as a final decision of\r\nquestions of doctrine, and whether such Bull was to be obeyed as an\r\ninfallible and final judgment. The pope, however, so far from modifying\r\nin any way the decision presented in the original Bull, re-emphasised\r\nhis position in a second Bull issued in 1719. In this, he presents the\r\nconclusion that the condemnation of the propositions was in itself\r\nfinal and authoritative and demanded from the Church unquestioning\r\nobedience. In 1720, an understanding was arrived at under which\r\ncertain of the Appellants recalled their signatures to the original\r\napplication while others repeated the first contention. These latter\r\ncame to be known as Re-appellants.\r\n\r\nIn 1722, seven French bishops appealed to Innocent XIII to revoke\r\nthe Bull and to summon a general council. Their letter was formally\r\ncondemned by the Inquisition. Benedict XIII, in a Bull issued in\r\n1724, declares that the doctrines of St. Augustine and St. Thomas\r\nAquinas are not affected by the Bull _Unigenitus_. The Pope was\r\npersonally inclined to enter into further explanations or definitions\r\nof the purport of the Bull, but a provincial council, held in Rome\r\nin 1725, had taken the ground that the Bull was to be accepted as a\r\nrule of faith, and, in 1727, the Pope confirmed the proceedings of a\r\nprovincial council held at Embrunn, at which council Bishop Soanen of\r\nSénez, one of the most active of the Appellants, had been suspended.\r\nAs a result of this action of the council and of the approval given to\r\nthe same by the Pope, the open opposition to the Bull on the part of\r\nthe French bishops was for the time brought to a close, and in 1730,\r\nthe faculty of the Sorbonne also gave in its submission. In 1734, the\r\nDominican, Serry, published anonymously, under the title _Theologia\r\nSupplex_, an analysis of the purport of the Bull, with reference\r\nmore particularly to the condemnation of certain of the one hundred and\r\none propositions in which it had not proved practicable to indicate any\r\nheretical teaching. This treatise was promptly prohibited, as had been\r\ndone with Serry’s previous volume on papal infallibility.\r\n\r\nA letter of the Duchess of Orleans (Elizabeth Charlotte of the\r\nPalatinate) written during the last years of Louis XIV, contains the\r\nfollowing reference to the Bull:\r\n\r\n   “_On avait fait au Roi une telle peur de l’enfer, qu’il\r\n   croyait que tout ceux qui n’avaient pas été instruits par les\r\n   Jesuites étaient damnés, et qu’il cragnait d’être damné aussi\r\n   s’il les fréquentait. Quand on voulait perdre quel qu’un,\r\n   on n’avait qu’à dire: il est Huguenot ou Janséniste; alors\r\n   l’affaire était faite._ The Maréchal d’Harcourt says that a\r\n   Jansenist is nothing else than a man that one desires to hang as\r\n   quickly as possible.”[231]\r\n\r\nAfter 1731, the Parliament of Paris took action antagonistic to the\r\nposition of the so-called Curialist bishops (the bishops who had\r\ngiven their adhesion to the full contentions of the Holy See) more\r\nparticularly with reference to the policy pursued by these bishops\r\nin refusing to the Appellants the privilege of the sacraments and of\r\nburial in consecrated ground. The bishops had question among themselves\r\nin regard to the recognition of the authority of the Parliament to take\r\naction in a matter so purely ecclesiastical, and they made application\r\nto Rome for instructions. In a brief issued in October, 1756, Benedict\r\nXIV decided that the sacraments should be denied only to the more\r\nstrenuous and noteworthy of the opponents of the Bull. This decision\r\ncaused no little dissatisfaction to the more bitter of the antagonists\r\nof the Appellants, particularly because the Pope had referred to the\r\nBull not as expressing a final and immutable conclusion of the Church,\r\nbut simply as a papal utterance which was entitled to respectful\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nThe Indexes of Innocent XIII and Clement XII contain the titles of\r\nabout one hundred works which had come into print as a result of\r\nthe controversies concerning the Bull. The list includes twenty-two\r\nofficial publications (decrees, pastoral letters, appeals to Rome,\r\netc.) of the French bishops, and four edicts of the Parliament of\r\nParis. These official documents were for the greater part condemned\r\nunder the authority of the Inquisition, but in a few instances, the\r\ncondemnation was arrived at by a papal brief. In the case of Colbert,\r\nBishop of Montpellier, and of Caylus, Bishop of Auxerre, the entire\r\nworks were prohibited, on the ground, apparently, of certain utterances\r\nin sympathy with the Appellants. The hundred prohibited works comprised\r\nbut a small proportion of the mass of literature in regard to the\r\ncontroversy that came into print. For the purpose of meeting the\r\nrisk of the omission of controversial writings of importance, the\r\nInquisition had, as early as February, 1717, prohibited all writings in\r\nwhich the Bull might be in any manner opposed or criticised, directly\r\nor indirectly. This prohibition, as worded, appears to cover not only\r\nworks at that time in existence, but all others of the character\r\nspecified which might later be printed or written.\r\n\r\nThis general prohibition was incorporated by Benedict XIV in the\r\n_Decreta Generalia_, ii., 61, with the addition of the following\r\nclasses: all books written in support of the conclusions presented in\r\nthe writings of Quesnel; all appeals from the authority of the Bull\r\nto a general council; all resolutions and decisions coming from the\r\ntheological faculties or individual theologians or academies, in which\r\nwere presented any criticisms of the papal authority or of the policy\r\nindicated in the Bull; all acts, decrees, letters, declarations and\r\nstatements of any kind in which, under the pretence of the explanation\r\nof doctrines or of the analysis of the relations between the authority\r\nof the pope and that of civil government, or under any pretence\r\nwhatsoever, the validity and conclusive authority of the Bull were in\r\nany way brought into question. This prohibition, as worded, was made to\r\napply not only to writings at that time in existence but to any future\r\nwritings of the character specified.\r\n\r\nIn the Spanish Index of 1747, the Bull _Unigenitus_ is printed in full,\r\nand all the writings of Quesnel are prohibited. The Spanish Index\r\ncontains, however, but a small portion of the long series of works\r\nproduced by the controversy which had been condemned in Rome. The\r\nSpanish compilers added the titles of some few works which had escaped\r\nthe attention of the Roman Inquisition.\r\n\r\nThe Bull bearing the title _Unigenitus Dei Filius_ was signed by the\r\nPope (Innocent XII) on the 8th of September, 1713. It begins with the\r\nstatement that a work had been brought into print in Paris in 1699,\r\nwhich it had been found necessary to condemn.\r\n\r\nThis work is entered in the Index under the title _Abrégé et\r\nTestament_ (no reference is made by name to Quesnel). “On a first\r\nexamination, the earnest reader may easily be attracted by the\r\nappearance of piety and of scholarship, but the volumes present in\r\nfact, intermingled with accepted Catholic doctrines, a series of lies\r\nand of pernicious errors.” The insidious teachings in these volumes\r\nhad misled not a few of the faithful and had even secured the approval\r\nof certain of the French bishops. “It had therefore seemed to the\r\nHoly See to be essential to make clear to the Church the serious and\r\npernicious nature of the doctrines that the writer of these volumes was\r\nattempting to maintain; and to this end would be presented, with the\r\nnecessary interpretations, a series of propositions selected from the\r\ntext.” The Pope felt assured “that a thorough exposition of the errors\r\ncontained in these propositions should prove of service to the faithful\r\nthroughout the world and ought to be of particular service in bringing\r\nto a close the unprofitable contests that had arisen in France. Such\r\nan authoritative exposition had in fact been applied for by the French\r\nbishops and by King Louis.” This statement is followed by the citation\r\n(given in both French and Latin) of one hundred and one propositions,\r\nwith references in the margin to the pages of the original text from\r\nwhich they had been cited. These propositions are there described\r\nas “false, deceitful, injurious for pious ears, as tending to\r\nundermine the beliefs of the faithful, the creed of the Church, and\r\nthe foundations of the civil power, as godless, blasphemous, and\r\nschismatic. They have for their purpose the strengthening of the\r\ninfluence of damnable heresies, and especially of those which have\r\nemanated from the Jansenists.”\r\n\r\nThe specific condemnation of these particular propositions is not to\r\nbe understood as an approval by implication of the remaining text\r\nof the book. The whole work is pernicious and the reading of it is\r\nprohibited. The text itself of the New Testament that has been printed\r\nin connection with the commentary has been corrupted in the most\r\nabominable fashion. The reading, printing, or distribution of the book\r\nbrings upon the delinquent the penalty of the _excommunicatio latae\r\nsententiae_ and the same penalty is made to apply, without further\r\nspecification, to all works in existence or hereafter produced which\r\nmay undertake the defence of the Quesnel volumes.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Daubenton, writing from Rome to Fénelon, says:\r\n\r\n   “No work has ever received a more thorough, comprehensive,\r\n   and conscientious examination. During a term of three years, a\r\n   group of the most able theologians in Rome, representatives of\r\n   the several schools of doctrine and of ecclesiastical thought,\r\n   gave their labour to this examination. The examiners included\r\n   Le Drou from the Augustinians, the master of the palace and the\r\n   secretary of the Index Congregation from the Thomists, Palermo\r\n   Santelia from the Scotists, Alfaro, for the Jesuits, the Bishop\r\n   of Lipari, a Benedictine, for the school of Anselm, Castelli for\r\n   the mission orders, etc.”\r\n\r\nWriting to Fénelon after the publication of the Bull, Daubenton says:\r\n\r\n   “Everybody appears to have taken action to prevent this Bull\r\n   from being given out. A number of the cardinals have represented\r\n   that there was risk of serious dissension in the Church.\r\n   The Pope remained firm in his decision to meet the wishes\r\n   of the King. The Bull is finally accepted by the cardinals\r\n   only after a bitter contest. The Dominican cardinal, Ferrari,\r\n   felt at one time assured that he would be able to prevent the\r\n   publication.”[232]\r\n\r\nGieseler points out[233] that the one hundred and one propositions\r\ninclude a number for which conclusive authority can be found in the\r\nScriptures themselves, while others are taken directly from the\r\nwritings of St. Augustine and of others of the Fathers. The Bull fails\r\nto make clear, he says, the sense in which these are erroneous or\r\nthe grounds on which they are to be condemned. Fénelon, who was much\r\npleased at the publication of the Bull, writes that “the fear of a\r\npossibly unjust excommunication ought not to be permitted to deter us\r\nfrom doing our direct duty; but if the excommunication constitutes an\r\ninjustice only in the conception of the person concerned and the duty\r\nis but putative or imaginary, or there is at least good ground for\r\ndoubt in regard to it, then is the proposition false, and all the more\r\ndangerous because it bears the appearance of truth.”\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit Yves André (†1764) writes[234]:\r\n\r\n   “I perceive here propositions which are bad in purpose and\r\n   in conclusion, grouped together with others which represent\r\n   manifest truths. These two classes are condemned together with\r\n   a long string of invectives and no explanation is vouchsafed to\r\n   us as to the varying grounds for the condemnation of statements\r\n   which differ materially from each other.”\r\n\r\nThe Bull was referred by Louis XIV to a commission of bishops which\r\ndecided that it should be published accompanied by a pastoral letter\r\npresenting explanations of the essential matters in question.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1714, the Sorbonne, after some stirring discussions,\r\naccepted the Bull by a bare majority. In 1714, at the special instance\r\nof the pope, the Congregation condemned the _Lettre Pastorale et\r\nMandement_ of Cardinal Noailles, Archbishop of Paris, as heretical\r\nand tending to schism. Louis XIV had previously, in indignation at the\r\n“Jansenist views” of the Cardinal, indicated by his opposition to the\r\nBull, forbidden him approach to the court.\r\n\r\nIn 1714, the King suggested to the pope the desirability of calling\r\na national council of the French Church, for the general object of\r\nbringing to a close the remnants of the Jansenist dissensions, and\r\nwith the special purpose of bringing discipline to bear on Cardinal\r\nNoailles. The pope gave favourable consideration to the plan, but the\r\ndeath of the King, in September, 1715, prevented its being carried\r\nout. The Duke of Orleans, who became Regent, was less sharply opposed\r\nto the Jansenist group. He prohibited, in 1716, the printing of\r\ncertain censures that had been ordered by the Assembly of the Clergy\r\nfor treatises by du Fouillon on the Bull _Unigenitus_, and on\r\nthe Evidence of the True Faith. The Sorbonne, in modification of\r\nits previous conclusions, made in December, 1715, a renewed protest\r\nagainst the Bull, which protest was supported by the other theological\r\nfaculties of the kingdom. Thirty bishops declared to the Regent that\r\nthey had given their acceptance of the Bull only on condition that it\r\nshould be published with explanations and specifications.\r\n\r\nClement XI demanded the immediate submission, under penalty of\r\ndeposition, of Noailles and the protesting bishops. He declared that\r\nthe bishops named by the Regent would be confirmed only after they had\r\ngiven in their assent to the publication and execution of the Bull;\r\nand he suspended, in November, 1716, by a brief, the privileges that\r\nhad been conveyed by the Holy See to the Sorbonne. These briefs were,\r\nhowever, refused confirmation and publication by the Regent and the\r\nParliament. During 1717, the Inquisition condemned, at the instance\r\nof the pope, a series of statements and letters from the French\r\necclesiastics, and of acts of the Parliament, and also certain decrees\r\nof the Sorbonne. In October, 1717, the Regent commanded that there\r\nshould thereafter be absolute silence concerning these ecclesiastical\r\nissues, and the Parliament condemned and prohibited certain writings,\r\nincluding an appeal from Noailles and the decree of the Inquisition.\r\nUnder Innocent XIII, who, in 1721, succeeded Clement XI, the contest\r\nand the controversies continued, and the lists of the Index were\r\nswelled with the titles of the controversial monographs, letters, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands, the opposition to the Bull _Unigenitus_ was\r\neven stronger than in France, representing in fact a substantial\r\nunanimity on the part of the clergy. Under the direction of De Bossu,\r\nthe successor of Precipiano as Archbishop of Mechlin, the Church of\r\nUtrecht took the lead in the contest. A series of the writings of the\r\nNetherland divines, which were important only in connection with the\r\npending question, were placed on the Index promptly after publication.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the Bishop of Orvieto was, in 1719, denounced as an opponent\r\nof the Bull, and was imprisoned. After he had formally recanted his\r\ndeclaration, he was confined for the remainder of his life in a\r\nmonastery. In 1724, Innocent XIII was succeeded by Benedict XIII, a\r\nDominican and a Thomist. The new Pope took steps to allay, through\r\na more liberal interpretation of the Bull, the antagonisms that had\r\narisen. A Roman provincial council, called in 1725, arrived, however,\r\nat the conclusion that the Bull must be respected by all the faithful.\r\n\r\nIn 1728, Noailles, at that time seventy-seven years old, apparently\r\nwearied of the long struggle, recalled his previous protests and\r\naccepted the Bull. He received from the Pope a jubilee Bull and letter\r\nof congratulation. He died the year following. In 1730, the Government\r\nsecured the acceptance of the Bull on the part of the Sorbonne by means\r\nof the deprivation, for forty-eight of its antagonists, of the right\r\nto vote. This appears to have brought the matter to a close as far as\r\nFrance was concerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1727, died François Paris, a deacon of Paris, who was credited\r\nwith having worked a series of miracles. Paris had been known in Rome\r\nas an active opponent of the Bull _Unigenitus_. The Inquisition\r\ntook prompt action therefore in condemning, in 1731, the _Memoirs\r\nof Paris_, and various records of his miracles. He was described\r\nas a stubborn Jansenist, a schismatic, and a heretic, and his “false\r\nmiracles” as calculated to injure the faith of believers, and to render\r\nthem disobedient to the See.\r\n\r\nUnder Clement XII, were prohibited later a long series of writings\r\non the miracles. Under Benedict XIV, were placed upon the Index,\r\namong other works on the same subject, a record of the life of Jean\r\nSoanen and his _Testament Spirituel_; a narrative of the miracles\r\nproduced in the person of Marianne Pollet; the posthumous works of the\r\nBishop of Babylon, on the ground of the consideration given in these\r\nto certain miracles that had been worked against the Archbishop of\r\nSens. In 1755, a convention of the French clergy gave consideration\r\nto the question of the treatment to be given to the opponents of the\r\nBull, more particularly with reference to the administration of the\r\nsacraments. The majority opinion was in favour of mild measures. The\r\nconclusions were submitted to Rome, and the decision given by Benedict\r\nXIV confirmed the policy of the mildest possible treatment of the\r\nminority party.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the controversies concerning the Bull _Unigenitus_,\r\nthere arose in France further issues in regard to the relations\r\nbetween the several orders of the clergy. Writers like Nicholas le\r\nGros (1675–1751) took the ground that the bishops had authority to\r\ngive binding decisions in regard to such matters as the acceptance of\r\na Bull, etc., only in connection with conclusions arrived at by the\r\nwhole body of the clergy. Another writer took the ground that between\r\nbishops and priests there was no essential difference. A number of\r\nthese writings were formally censured by the Sorbonne and by diocesan\r\nconventions, but no one of them found its way into the Index.\r\n\r\n=3. Controversial Writings between 1665 and 1730 in Regard to\r\nTheological Morality.=--In September of 1665 and May of 1666,\r\nunder edicts of Alexander VII, a long series (forty-five in all) of\r\npropositions of the Casuists were condemned without specification of\r\nthe books in which these propositions had appeared. Similar edicts were\r\npublished later under Innocent XI and Alexander VIII. Matthaeus de\r\nMoya, writing first under the name of Giumenus, undertook the defence\r\nof the Jesuit Casuists against the doctrines of Spanish theologians,\r\nchiefly Dominicans. This _Apologia_ of de Moya was, in 1665,\r\nsharply censured by the Sorbonne and was prohibited in 1666 by the\r\nIndex Congregation, in 1675 by the Inquisition, and in 1680 by a\r\nspecial brief of Innocent XI. In Spain, the work of De Moya, so far\r\nfrom being prohibited, was held in general favour. In 1670 and 1672,\r\nunder Clement X, were prohibited writings by Fabri and Baron. Fabri was\r\none of the most noteworthy of the Dominican critics of the Jesuits,\r\nand Baron was one of the most learned of the Jesuit Casuists of his\r\nday. Neither of these volumes appears in the Spanish Index. One of the\r\nmore important of the works on theological morality by a Jesuit, was\r\nprinted in 1694 by Thyrsus Gonzalez, General of the Order, under the\r\ntitle of _Probabilissimus_. This treatise is described as taking\r\nstrong ground against a number of the Jesuit contentions and theories.\r\nGonzalez had apparently undertaken to correct certain moral principles\r\nmaintained by his Order, principles which were in his judgment\r\nerroneous. In 1705, a treatise of the Jesuit Balthazar Francolinus,\r\nunder the title of _Rigorismus_, was printed in Rome with the\r\napproval of Clement XI; a number of replies to this were prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Büchernachdruck_, 14.\r\n\r\n[2] _Remains of Bishop Barlow_, London, 1693, 70–71.\r\n\r\n[3] Mendham, 4.\r\n\r\n[4] _De Jure_, etc., 328.
