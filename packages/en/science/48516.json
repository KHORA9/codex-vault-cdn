These,\r\n  together with the minor modes of Painting, we propose arranging\r\n  in something like chronological sequence; but our design being\r\n  to offer an explanation of the Art derived from practical\r\n  acquaintance, rather than attempt to give its history, we shall\r\n  confine ourselves for the most part to so much only of the History\r\n  of Painting as is necessary to elucidate the origin of the\r\n  different practices which have obtained at different periods.”\r\n\r\n  By this means, the Authors hope to produce a work which may be\r\n  valuable to the Amateur, and interesting to the Connoisseur, the\r\n  Artist, and the General Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: KENT & CO.

Nevertheless, during these three decades I\r\nhave found my account in the increasing approbation of the reading\r\npublic, which has been so largely extended to the series of “THINGS\r\nNOT GENERALLY KNOWN,” of which the present volume of “CURIOSITIES OF\r\nSCIENCE” is an instalment. I need scarcely add, that in its progressive\r\npreparation I have endeavoured to compare, weigh, and consider,\r\nthe contents, so as to combine the experience of the Past with the\r\nadvantages of the Present.\r\n\r\nIn these days of universal attainments, when Science becomes not\r\nmerely a luxury to the rich, but bread to the poor, and when the\r\nvery amusements as well as the conveniences of life have taken a\r\nscientific colour, it is reasonable to hope that the present volume\r\nmay be acceptable to a large class of seekers after “things not\r\ngenerally known.” For this purpose, I have aimed at soundness as well\r\nas popularity; although, for myself, I can claim little beyond being\r\none of those industrious “ants of science” who garner facts, and by\r\nselection and comparison adapt them for a wider circle of readers\r\nthan they were originally expected to reach. In each case, as far as\r\npossible, these “CURIOSITIES” bear the mint-mark of authority; and in\r\nthe living list are prominent the names of Humboldt and Herschel, Airy\r\nand Whewell, Faraday, Brewster, Owen, and Agassiz, Maury, Wheatstone,\r\nand Hunt, from whose writings and researches the following pages are\r\nfrequently enriched.\r\n\r\nThe sciences here illustrated are, in the main, Astronomy and\r\nMeteorology; Geology and Paleontology; Physical Geography; Sound,\r\nLight, and Heat; Magnetism and Electricity,--the latter with special\r\nattention to the great marvel of our times, the Electro-magnetic\r\nTelegraph. I hope, at no very distant period, to extend the\r\n“CURIOSITIES” to another volume, to include branches of Natural and\r\nExperimental Science which are not here presented.\r\n\r\n            I.

Dr. Scoresby),--the\r\nsix-feet speculum has had its grandest triumphs, and the noble\r\nartificer and observer the highest rewards of his talents and\r\nenterprise. Altogether, the quantity of work done during a period of\r\nabout seven years--including a winter when a noble philanthropy for\r\na starving population absorbed the keenest interests of science--has\r\nbeen decidedly great; and the new knowledge acquired concerning the\r\nhandiwork of the great Creator amply satisfying of even sanguine\r\nexpectation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vignette.\r\n\r\nSIR HUMPHRY DAVY’S OWN MODEL OF HIS SAFETY-LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the several contrivances which have been proposed for safely\r\nlighting coal-mines subject to the visitation of fire-damp, or\r\ncarburetted hydrogen, the Safety-Lamp of Sir Humphry Davy is the only\r\none which has ever been judged safe, and been extensively employed. The\r\ninventor first turned his attention to the subject in 1815, when Davy\r\nbegan a minute chemical examination of fire-damp, and found that it\r\nrequired an admixture of a large quantity of atmospheric air to render\r\nit explosive. He then ascertained that explosions of inflammable gases\r\nwere incapable of being passed through long narrow metallic tubes, and\r\nthat this principle of security was still obtained by diminishing their\r\nlength and increasing their number. This fact led to trials upon sieves\r\nmade of wire-gauze; when Davy found that if a piece of wire-gauze was\r\nheld over the flame of a lamp, or of coal-gas, it prevented the flame\r\nfrom passing; and he ascertained that a flame confined in a cylinder of\r\nvery fine wire-gauze did not explode even in a mixture of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, but that the gases burnt in it with great vivacity.\r\n\r\nThese experiments served as the basis of the Safety-Lamp. The apertures\r\nin the gauze, Davy tells us in his work on the subject, should not\r\nbe more than 1/22d of an inch square. The lamp is screwed on to the\r\nbottom of the wire-gauze cylinder. When it is lighted, and gradually\r\nintroduced into an atmosphere mixed with fire-damp, the size and length\r\nof the flame are first increased. When the inflammable gas forms as\r\nmuch as 1/12th of the volume of air, the cylinder becomes filled with a\r\nfeeble blue flame, within which the flame of the wick burns brightly,\r\nand the light of the wick continues till the fire-damp increases to\r\n1/6th or 1/5th; it is then lost in the flame of the fire-damp, which\r\nnow fills the cylinder with a pretty strong light; and when the foul\r\nair constitutes one-third of the atmosphere it is no longer fit for\r\nrespiration,--and this ought to be a signal to the miner to leave that\r\npart of the workings.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy presented his first communication respecting his\r\ndiscovery of the Safety-Lamp to the Royal Society in 1815. This was\r\nfollowed by a series of papers remarkable for their simplicity and\r\nclearness, crowned by that read on the 11th of January 1816, when the\r\nprinciple of the Safety-Lamp was announced, and Sir Humphry presented\r\nto the Society a model made by his own hands, which is to this day\r\npreserved in the collection of the Royal Society at Burlington House.\r\nFrom this interesting memorial the Vignette has been sketched.\r\n\r\nThere have been several modifications of the Safety-Lamp, and the merit\r\nof the discovery has been claimed by others, among whom was Mr. George\r\nStephenson; but the question was set at rest forty-one years since by\r\nan examination,--attested by Sir Joseph Banks, P.R.S., Mr. Brande, Mr.\r\nHatchett, and Dr. Wollaston,--and awarding the independent merit to\r\nDavy.\r\n\r\nA more substantial, though not a more honourable, testimony of approval\r\nwas given by the coal-owners, who subscribed 2500_l._ to purchase a\r\nsuperb service of plate, which was suitably inscribed and presented to\r\nDavy.[2]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Report by the Parliamentary Committee “cannot admit that\r\nthe experiments (made with the Lamp) have any tendency to detract from\r\nthe character of Sir Humphry Davy, or to disparage the fair value\r\nplaced by himself upon his invention. The improvements are probably\r\nthose which longer life and additional facts would have induced him to\r\ncontemplate as desirable, and of which, had he not been the inventor,\r\nhe might have become the patron.”\r\n\r\nThe principle of the invention may be thus summed up. In the\r\nSafety-Lamp, the mixture of the fire-damp and atmospheric air within\r\nthe cage of wire-gauze explodes upon coming in contact with the flame;\r\nbut the combustion cannot pass through the wire-gauze, and being there\r\nimprisoned, cannot impart to the explosive atmosphere of the mine any\r\nof its force. This effect has been erroneously attributed to a cooling\r\ninfluence of the metal.\r\n\r\nProfessor Playfair has eloquently described the Safety-Lamp of Davy as\r\na present from philosophy to the arts; a discovery in no degree the\r\neffect of accident or chance, but the result of patient and enlightened\r\nresearch, and strongly exemplifying the great use of an immediate and\r\nconstant appeal to experiment. After characterising the invention as\r\nthe _shutting-up in a net of the most slender texture_ a most violent\r\nand irresistible force, and a power that in its tremendous effects\r\nseems to emulate the lightning and the earthquake, Professor Playfair\r\nthus concludes: “When to this we add the beneficial consequences, and\r\nthe saving of the lives of men, and consider that the effects are to\r\nremain as long as coal continues to be dug from the bowels of the\r\nearth, it may be fairly said that there is hardly in the whole compass\r\nof art or science a single invention of which one would rather wish\r\nto be the author.... This,” says Professor Playfair, “is exactly such\r\na case as we should choose to place before Bacon, were he to revisit\r\nthe earth; in order to give him, in a small compass, an idea of the\r\nadvancement which philosophy has made since the time when he had\r\npointed out to her the route which she ought to pursue.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroductory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.\r\n\r\nIn every province of human knowledge where we now possess a careful\r\nand coherent interpretation of nature, men began by attempting in\r\nbold flights to leap from obvious facts to the highest point of\r\ngenerality--to some wide and simple principle which after-ages had to\r\nreject. Thus, from the facts that all bodies are hot or cold, moist or\r\ndry, they leapt at once to the doctrine that the world is constituted\r\nof four elements--earth, air, fire, water; from the fact that the\r\nheavenly bodies circle the sky in courses which occur again and again,\r\nthey at once asserted that they move in exact circles, with an exactly\r\nuniform motion; from the fact that heavy bodies fall through the air\r\nsomewhat faster than light ones, it was assumed that all bodies fall\r\nquickly or slowly exactly in proportion to their weight; from the fact\r\nthat the magnet attracts iron, and that this force of attraction is\r\ncapable of increase, it was inferred that a perfect magnet would have\r\nan irresistible force of attraction, and that the magnetic pole of\r\nthe earth would draw the nails out of a ship’s bottom which came near\r\nit; from the fact that some of the finest quartz crystals are found\r\namong the snows of the Alps, it was inferred that the crystallisation\r\nof gems is the result of intense and long-continued cold: and so on\r\nin innumerable instances. Such anticipations as these constituted\r\nthe basis of almost all the science of the ancient world; for such\r\nprinciples being so assumed, consequences were drawn from them with\r\ngreat ingenuity, and systems of such deductions stood in the place of\r\nscience.--_Edinburgh Review_, No. 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe earliest science of a decidedly English school is due, for the most\r\npart, to the University of Oxford, and specially to Merton College,--a\r\nfoundation of which Wood remarks, that there was no other for two\r\ncenturies, either in Oxford or Paris, which could at all come near it\r\nin the cultivation of the sciences. But he goes on to say that large\r\nchests full of the writers of this college were allowed to remain\r\nuntouched by their successors for fear of the magic which was supposed\r\nto be contained in them. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to trace\r\nthe liberalising effect of scientific study upon the University in\r\ngeneral, and Merton College in particular; and it must be remembered\r\nthat to the cultivation of the mind at Oxford we owe almost all the\r\nliterary celebrity of the middle ages. In this period the University of\r\nCambridge appears to have acquired no scientific distinction. Taking\r\nas a test the acquisition of celebrity on the continent, we find that\r\nBacon, Sacrobosco, Greathead, Estwood, &c. were all of Oxford. The\r\nlatter University had its morning of splendour while Cambridge was\r\ncomparatively unknown; it had also its noonday, illustrated by such men\r\nas Briggs, Wren, Wallis, Halley, and Bradley.\r\n\r\nThe age of science at Cambridge may be said to have begun with Francis\r\nBacon; and but that we think much of the difference between him and\r\nhis celebrated namesake lies more in time and circumstances than in\r\ntalents or feelings, we would rather date from 1600 with the former\r\nthan from 1250 with the latter. Praise or blame on either side is out\r\nof the question, seeing that the earlier foundation of Oxford, and its\r\nsuperiority in pecuniary means, rendered all that took place highly\r\nprobable; and we are in a great measure indebted for the liberty of\r\nwriting our thoughts, to the cultivation of the liberalising sciences\r\nat Oxford in the dark ages.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the University of Cambridge, for a long time there\r\nhardly existed the materials of any proper instruction, even to the\r\nextent of pointing out what books should be read by a student desirous\r\nof cultivating astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATO’S SURVEY OF THE SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n  Plato, like Francis Bacon, took a review of the sciences of his\r\n  time: he enumerates arithmetic and plane geometry, treated as\r\n  collections of abstract and permanent truths; solid geometry, which\r\n  he “notes as deficient” in his time, although in fact he and his\r\n  school were in possession of the doctrine of the “five regular\r\n  solids;” astronomy, in which he demands a science which should\r\n  be elevated above the mere knowledge of phenomena. The visible\r\n  appearances of the heavens only suggest the problems with which\r\n  true astronomy deals; as beautiful geometrical diagrams do not\r\n  prove, but only suggest geometrical propositions. Finally, Plato\r\n  notices the subject of harmonics, in which he requires a science\r\n  which shall deal with truths more exact than the ear can establish,\r\n  as in astronomy he requires truths more exact than the eye can\r\n  assure us of.\r\n\r\n  In a subsequent paper Plato speaks of _Dialectic_ as a still\r\n  higher element of a philosophical education, fitted to lead men\r\n  to the knowledge of real existences and of the supreme good. Here\r\n  he describes dialectic by its objects and purpose. In other places\r\n  dialectic is spoken of as a method or process of analysis; as in\r\n  the _Phædrus_, where Socrates describes a good dialectician as one\r\n  who can divide a subject according to its natural members, and not\r\n  miss the joint, like a bad carver. Xenophon says that Socrates\r\n  derived _dialectic_ from a term implying to _divide a subject into\r\n  parts_, which Mr. Grote thinks unsatisfactory as an etymology, but\r\n  which has indicated a practical connection in the Socratic school.\r\n  The result seems to be that Plato did not establish any method of\r\n  analysis of a subject as his dialectic; but he conceived that the\r\n  analytical habits formed by the comprehensive study of the exact\r\n  sciences, and sharpened by the practice of dialogue, would lead his\r\n  students to the knowledge of first principles.--_Dr. Whewell._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLY OF ATHEISM.\r\n\r\nMorphology, in natural science, teaches us that the whole animal\r\nand vegetable creation is formed upon certain fundamental types\r\nand patterns, which can be traced under various modifications and\r\ntransformations through all the rich variety of things apparently of\r\nmost dissimilar build. But here and there a scientific person takes\r\nit into his foolish head that there may be a set of moulds without\r\na moulder, a calculated gradation of forms without a calculator, an\r\nordered world without an ordering God. Now, this atheistical science\r\nconveys about as much meaning as suicidal life: for science is possible\r\nonly where there are ideas, and ideas are only possible where there is\r\nmind, and minds are the offspring of God; and atheism itself is not\r\nmerely ignorance and stupidity,--it is the purely nonsensical and the\r\nunintelligible.--_Professor Blackie_; _Edinburgh Essays_, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nTo observe properly in the very simplest of the physical sciences\r\nrequires a long and severe training. No one knows this so feelingly\r\nas the great discoverer. Faraday once said, that he always doubts his\r\nown observations. Mitscherlich on one occasion remarked to a man of\r\nscience that it takes fourteen years to discover and establish a single\r\nnew fact in chemistry. An enthusiastic student one day betook himself\r\nto Baron Cuvier with the exhibition of a new organ--a muscle which he\r\nsupposed himself to have discovered in the body of some living creature\r\nor other; but the experienced and sagacious naturalist kindly bade the\r\nyoung man return to him with the same discovery in six months. The\r\nBaron would not even listen to the student’s demonstration, nor examine\r\nhis dissection, till the eager and youthful discoverer had hung over\r\nthe object of inquiry for half a year; and yet that object was a mere\r\nthing of the senses.--_North-British Review_, No. 18.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUTUAL RELATIONS OF PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\nIn the observation of a phenomenon which at first sight appears to\r\nbe wholly isolated, how often may be concealed the germ of a great\r\ndiscovery! Thus, when Galvani first stimulated the nervous fibre of\r\nthe frog by the accidental contact of two heterogeneous metals, his\r\ncontemporaries could never have anticipated that the action of the\r\nvoltaic pile would discover to us in the alkalies metals of a silver\r\nlustre, so light as to swim on water, and eminently inflammable; or\r\nthat it would become a powerful instrument of chemical analysis, and at\r\nthe same time a thermoscope and a magnet. When Huyghens first observed,\r\nin 1678, the phenomenon of the polarisation of light, exhibited in the\r\ndifference between two rays into which a pencil of light divides itself\r\nin passing through a doubly refracting crystal, it could not have been\r\nforeseen that a century and a half later the great philosopher Arago\r\nwould, by his discovery of _chromatic polarisation_, be led to discern,\r\nby means of a small fragment of Iceland spar, whether solar light\r\nemanates from a solid body or a gaseous covering; or whether comets\r\ntransmit light directly, or merely by reflection.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_,\r\nvol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL RESULTS OF THEORETICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nWhat are the great wonders, the great sources of man’s material\r\nstrength, wealth, and comfort in modern times? The Railway, with its\r\nmile-long trains of men and merchandise, moving with the velocity of\r\nthe wind, and darting over chasms a thousand feet wide; the Electric\r\nTelegraph, along which man’s thoughts travel with the velocity of\r\nlight, and girdle the earth more quickly than Puck’s promise to his\r\nmaster; the contrivance by which the Magnet, in the very middle of\r\na strip of iron, is still true to the distant pole, and remains a\r\nfaithful guide to the mariner; the Electrotype process, by which a\r\nmetallic model of any given object, unerringly exact, grows into\r\nbeing like a flower. Now, all these wonders are the result of recent\r\nand profound discoveries in theoretical science. The Locomotive\r\nSteam-engine, and the Steam-engine in all its other wonderful and\r\ninvaluable applications, derives its efficacy from the discoveries, by\r\nWatt and others, of the laws of steam. The Railway Bridge is not made\r\nstrong by mere accumulation of materials, but by the most exact and\r\ncareful scientific examination of the means of giving the requisite\r\nstrength to every part, as in the great example of Mr. Stephenson’s\r\nBritannia Bridge over the Menai Strait. The Correction of the Magnetic\r\nNeedle in iron ships it would have been impossible for Mr. Airy to\r\nsecure without a complete theoretical knowledge of the laws of\r\nMagnetism. The Electric Telegraph and the Electrotype process include\r\nin their principles and mechanism the most complete and subtle results\r\nof electrical and magnetical theory.--_Edinburgh Review_, No. 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERPETUITY OF IMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of society all great and real improvements are\r\nperpetuated: the same corn which, four thousand years ago, was raised\r\nfrom an improved grass by an inventor worshiped for two thousand years\r\nin the ancient world under the name of Ceres, still forms the principal\r\nfood of mankind; and the potato, perhaps the greatest benefit that the\r\nold has derived from the new world, is spreading over Europe, and will\r\ncontinue to nourish an extensive population when the name of the race\r\nby whom it was first cultivated in South America is forgotten.--_Sir H.\r\nDavy._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIEST ENGLISH SCIENTIFIC TREATISE.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Chaucer, the poet, wrote a treatise on the Astrolabe for his\r\nson, which is the earliest English treatise we have met with on any\r\nscientific subject. It was not completed; and the apologies which\r\nChaucer makes to his own child for writing in English are curious;\r\nwhile his inference that his son should therefore “pray God save the\r\nking that is lord of this language,” is at least as loyal as logical.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHERS’ FALSE ESTIMATES OF THEIR OWN LABOURS.\r\n\r\nGalileo was confident that the most important part of his contributions\r\nto the knowledge of the solar system was his Theory of the Tides--a\r\ntheory which all succeeding astronomers have rejected as utterly\r\nbaseless and untenable. Descartes probably placed far above his\r\nbeautiful explanation of the rainbow, his _à priori_ theory of the\r\nexistence of the vortices which caused the motion of the planets and\r\nsatellites. Newton perhaps considered as one of the best parts of his\r\noptical researches his explanation of the natural colour of bodies,\r\nwhich succeeding optical philosophers have had to reject; and he\r\ncertainly held very strongly the necessity of a material cause for\r\ngravity, which his disciples have disregarded. Davy looked for his\r\ngreatest triumph in the application of his discoveries to prevent\r\nthe copper bottoms of ships from being corroded. And so in other\r\nmatters.--_Edinburgh Review_, No. 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELICS OF GENIUS.\r\n\r\nProfessor George Wilson, in a lecture to the Scottish Society of\r\nArts, says: “The spectacle of these things ministers only to the\r\ngood impulses of humanity. Isaac Newton’s telescope at the Royal\r\nSociety of London; Otto Guericke’s air-pump in the Library at Berlin;\r\nJames Watt’s repaired Newcomen steam-engine in the Natural-Philosophy\r\nclass-room of the College at Glasgow; Fahrenheit’s thermometer in\r\nthe corresponding class-room of the University of Edinburgh; Sir H.\r\nDavy’s great voltaic battery at the Royal Institution, London, and\r\nhis safety-lamp at the Royal Society; Joseph Black’s pneumatic trough\r\nin Dr. Gregory’s possession; the first wire which Faraday made rotate\r\nelectro-magnetically, at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital; Dalton’s atomic\r\nmodels at Manchester; and Kemp’s liquefied gases in the Industrial\r\nMuseum of Scotland,--are alike personal relics, historical monuments,\r\nand objects of instruction, which grow more and more precious every\r\nyear, and of which we never can have too many.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROYAL SOCIETY: THE NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society was formed with the avowed object of increasing\r\nknowledge by direct experiment; and it is worthy of remark, that the\r\ncharter granted by Charles II. to this celebrated institution declares\r\nthat its object is the extension of natural knowledge, as opposed to\r\nthat which is supernatural.\r\n\r\nDr. Paris (_Life of Sir H. Davy_, vol. ii. p. 178) says: “The charter\r\nof the Royal Society states that it was established for the improvement\r\nof _natural_ science. This epithet _natural_ was originally intended to\r\nimply a meaning, of which very few persons, I believe, are aware. At\r\nthe period of the establishment of the society, the arts of witchcraft\r\nand divination were very extensively encouraged; and the word _natural_\r\nwas therefore introduced in contradistinction to _supernatural_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHER BOYLE.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Bacon, one of the most distinguished Englishmen\r\nwas certainly Robert Boyle, who, if compared with his contemporaries,\r\nmay be said to rank immediately below Newton, though of course very\r\ninferior to him as an original thinker. Boyle was the first who\r\ninstituted exact experiments into the relation between colour and heat;\r\nand by this means not only ascertained some very important facts, but\r\nlaid a foundation for that union between optics and thermotics, which,\r\nthough not yet completed, now merely waits for some great philosopher\r\nto strike out a generalisation large enough to cover both, and thus\r\nfuse the two sciences into a single study. It is also to Boyle, more\r\nthan to any other Englishman, that we owe the science of hydrostatics\r\nin the state in which we now possess it.[3] He is also the original\r\ndiscoverer of that beautiful law, so fertile in valuable results,\r\naccording to which the elasticity of air varies as its density. And,\r\nin the opinion of one of the most eminent modern naturalists, it was\r\nBoyle who opened up those chemical inquiries which went on accumulating\r\nuntil, a century later, they supplied the means by which Lavoisier and\r\nhis contemporaries fixed the real basis of chemistry, and enabled it\r\nfor the first time to take its proper stand among those sciences that\r\ndeal with the external world.--_Buckle’s History of Civilization_, vol.\r\ni.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON’S ROOMS AND LABORATORY IN TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nOf the rooms occupied by Newton during his early residence at\r\nCambridge, it is now difficult to settle the locality. The chamber\r\nallotted to him as Fellow, in 1667, was “the Spiritual Chamber,”\r\nconjectured to have been the ground-room, next the chapel, but it is\r\nnot certain that he resided there. The rooms in which he lived from\r\n1682 till he left Cambridge, are in the north-east corner of the great\r\ncourt, on the first floor, on the right or north of the gateway or\r\nprincipal entrance to the college. His laboratory, as Dr. Humphrey\r\nNewton tell us, was “on the left end of the garden, near the east end\r\nof the chapel; and his telescope (refracting) was five feet long, and\r\nplaced at the head of the stairs, going down into the garden.”[4] The\r\neast side of Newton’s rooms has been altered within the last fifty\r\nyears: Professor Sedgwick, who came up to college in 1804, recollects a\r\nwooden room, supported on an arcade, shown in Loggan’s view, in place\r\nof which arcade is now a wooden wall and brick chimney.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Humphrey Newton relates that in college Sir Isaac very rarely\r\n  went to bed till two or three o’clock in the morning, sometimes\r\n  not till five or six, especially at spring and fall of the leaf,\r\n  when he used to employ about six weeks in his laboratory, the\r\n  fire scarcely going out either night or day; he sitting up one\r\n  night, and Humphrey another, till he had finished his chemical\r\n  experiments. Dr. Newton describes the laboratory as “well furnished\r\n  with chymical materials, as bodyes, receivers, heads, crucibles,\r\n  &c., which was made very little use of, ye crucibles excepted,\r\n  in which he fused his metals: he would sometimes, though very\r\n  seldom, look into an old mouldy book, which lay in his laboratory;\r\n  I think it was titled _Agricola de Metallis_, the transmuting of\r\n  metals being his chief design, for which purpose antimony was a\r\n  great ingredient.” “His brick furnaces, _pro re nata_, he made and\r\n  altered himself without troubling a bricklayer.” “What observations\r\n  he might make with his telescope, I know not, but several of his\r\n  observations about comets and the planets may be found scattered\r\n  here and there in a book intitled _The Elements of Astronomy_, by\r\n  Dr. David Gregory.”[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON’S “APPLE-TREE.”\r\n\r\nCurious and manifold as are the trees associated with the great names\r\nof their planters, or those who have sojourned in their shade, the\r\nTree which, by the falling of its fruit, suggested to Newton the idea\r\nof Gravity, is of paramount interest. It appears that, in the autumn\r\nof 1665, Newton left his college at Cambridge for his paternal home\r\nat Woolsthorpe. “When sitting alone in the garden,” says Sir David\r\nBrewster, “and speculating on the power of gravity, it occurred to him,\r\nthat as the same power by which the apple fell to the ground was not\r\nsensibly diminished at the greatest distance from the centre of the\r\nearth to which we can reach, neither at the summits of the loftiest\r\nspires, nor on the tops of the highest mountains, it might extend to\r\nthe moon and retain her in her orbit, in the same manner as it bends\r\ninto a curve a stone or a cannon-ball when projected in a straight line\r\nfrom the surface of the earth.”--_Life of Newton_, vol. i. p. 26. Sir\r\nDavid Brewster notes, that neither Pemberton nor Whiston, who received\r\nfrom Newton himself his first ideas of gravity, records this story of\r\nthe falling apple. It was mentioned, however, to Voltaire by Catherine\r\nBarton, Newton’s niece; and to Mr. Green by Martin Folkes, President\r\nof the Royal Society. Sir David Brewster saw the reputed apple-tree in\r\n1814, and brought away a portion of one of its roots. The tree was so\r\nmuch decayed that it was cut down in 1820, and the wood of it carefully\r\npreserved by Mr. Turnor, of Stoke Rocheford.\r\n\r\n  De Morgan (in _Notes and Queries_, 2d series, No. 139, p. 169)\r\n  questions whether the fruit was an apple, and maintains that the\r\n  anecdote rests upon very slight authority; more especially as\r\n  the idea had for many years been floating before the minds of\r\n  physical inquirers; although Newton cleared away the confusions and\r\n  difficulties which prevented very able men from proceeding beyond\r\n  conjecture, and by this means established _universal_ gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON’S “PRINCIPIA.”\r\n\r\n“It may be justly said,” observes Halley, “that so many and so valuable\r\nphilosophical truths as are herein discovered and put past dispute\r\nwere never yet owing to the capacity and industry of any one man.”\r\n“The importance and generality of the discoveries,” says Laplace, “and\r\nthe immense number of original and profound views, which have been the\r\ngerm of the most brilliant theories of the philosophers of this (18th)\r\ncentury, and all presented with much elegance, will ensure to the work\r\non the _Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy_ a preëminence\r\nabove all the other productions of human genius.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCARTES’ LABOURS IN PHYSICS.\r\n\r\nThe most profound among the many eminent thinkers France has produced,\r\nis Réné Descartes, of whom the least that can be said is, that he\r\neffected a revolution more decisive than has ever been brought about\r\nby any other single mind; that he was the first who successfully\r\napplied algebra to geometry; that he pointed out the important law of\r\nthe sines; that in an age in which optical instruments were extremely\r\nimperfect, he discovered the changes to which light is subjected in\r\nthe eye by the crystalline lens; that he directed attention to the\r\nconsequences resulting from the weight of the atmosphere; and that he\r\nmoreover detected the causes of the rainbow. At the same time, and\r\nas if to combine the most varied forms of excellence, he is not only\r\nallowed to be the first geometrician of the age, but by the clearness\r\nand admirable precision of his style, he became one of the founders\r\nof French prose. And, although he was constantly engaged in those\r\nlofty inquiries into the nature of the human mind, which can never\r\nbe studied without wonder, he combined with them a long course of\r\nlaborious experiment upon the animal frame, which raised him to the\r\nhighest rank among the anatomists of his time. The great discovery\r\nmade by Harvey of the Circulation of the Blood was neglected by most\r\nof his contemporaries; but it was at once recognised by Descartes, who\r\nmade it the basis of the physiological part of his work on man. He was\r\nlikewise the discoverer of the lacteals by Aselli, which, like every\r\ngreat truth yet laid before the world, was at its first appearance,\r\nnot only disbelieved, but covered with ridicule.--_Buckle’s History of\r\nCivilization_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIC SECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIf a cone or sugar-loaf be cut through in certain directions, we shall\r\nobtain figures which are termed conic sections: thus, if we cut through\r\na sugar-loaf parallel to its base or bottom, the outline or edge of the\r\nloaf where it is cut will be _a circle_. If the cut is made so as to\r\nslant, and not be parallel to the base of the loaf, the outline is an\r\n_ellipse_, provided the cut goes quite through the sides of the loaf\r\nall round; but if it goes slanting, and parallel to the line of the\r\nloaf’s side, the outline is a _parabola_, a conic section or curve,\r\nwhich is distinguished by characteristic properties, every point of it\r\nbearing a certain fixed relation to a certain point within it, as the\r\ncircle does to its centre.--_Dr. Paris’s Notes to Philosophy in Sport,\r\n&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF COMPUTATION.\r\n\r\nThe higher class of mathematicians, at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, had become excellent computers, particularly in England,\r\nof which Wallis, Newton, Halley, the Gregorys, and De Moivre, are\r\nsplendid examples. Before results of extreme exactness had become\r\nquite familiar, there was a gratifying sense of power in bringing out\r\nthe new methods. Newton, in one of his letters to Oldenburg, says\r\nthat he was at one time too much attached to such things, and that\r\nhe should be ashamed to say to what number of figures he was in the\r\nhabit of carrying his results. The growth of power of computation on\r\nthe Continent did not, however, keep pace with that of the same in\r\nEngland. In 1696, De Laguy, a well-known writer on algebra, and a\r\nmember of the Academy of Sciences, said that the most skilful computer\r\ncould not, in less than a month, find within a unit the cube root of\r\n696536483318640035073641037.--_De Morgan._\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SCIENCE OF THE COSMOS.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt, characterises this “uncommon but definite expression” as the\r\ntreating of “the assemblage of all things with which space is filled,\r\nfrom the remotest nebulæ to the climatic distribution of those delicate\r\ntissues of vegetable matter which spread a variegated covering over the\r\nsurface of our rocks.” The word _cosmos_, which primitively, in the\r\nHomeric ages, indicated an idea of order and harmony, was subsequently\r\nadopted in scientific language, where it was gradually applied to the\r\norder observed in the movements of the heavenly bodies; to the whole\r\nuniverse; and then finally to the world in which this harmony was\r\nreflected to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THE WORLD IN MOTION.\r\n\r\nHumboldt, in his _Cosmos_,[6] gives the following beautiful\r\nillustrative proofs of this phenomenon:\r\n\r\n  If, for a moment, we imagine the acuteness of our senses\r\n  preternaturally heightened to the extreme limits of telescopic\r\n  vision, and bring together events separated by wide intervals of\r\n  time, the apparent repose which reigns in space will suddenly\r\n  vanish; countless stars will be seen moving in groups in various\r\n  directions; nebulæ wandering, condensing, and dissolving like\r\n  cosmical clouds; the milky way breaking up in parts, and its\r\n  veil rent asunder. In every point of the celestial vault we\r\n  shall recognise the dominion of progressive movement, as on the\r\n  surface of the earth where vegetation is constantly putting forth\r\n  its leaves and buds, and unfolding its blossoms. The celebrated\r\n  Spanish botanist, Cavanilles, first conceived the possibility of\r\n  “seeing grass grow,” by placing the horizontal micrometer wire\r\n  of a telescope, with a high magnifying power, at one time on the\r\n  point of a bamboo shoot, and at another on the rapidly unfolding\r\n  flowering stem of an American aloe; precisely as the astronomer\r\n  places the cross of wires on a culminating star. Throughout the\r\n  whole life of physical nature--in the organic as in the sidereal\r\n  world--existence, preservation, production, and development, are\r\n  alike associated with motion as their essential condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AXIS OF ROTATION.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable as a mechanical fact, that nothing is so permanent in\r\nnature as the Axis of Rotation of any thing which is rapidly whirled.\r\nWe have examples of this in every-day practice. The first is the\r\nmotion of _a boy’s hoop_. What keeps the hoop from falling?--It is its\r\nrotation, which is one of the most complicated subjects in mechanics.\r\n\r\nAnother thing pertinent to this question is, _the motion of a quoit_.\r\nEvery body who ever threw a quoit knows that to make it preserve its\r\nposition as it goes through the air, it is necessary to give it a\r\nwhirling motion. It will be seen that while whirling, it preserves its\r\nplane, whatever the position of the plane may be, and however it may\r\nbe inclined to the direction in which the quoit travels. Now, this has\r\ngreater analogy with the motion of the earth than any thing else.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration is _the motion of a spinning top_. The greatest\r\nmathematician of the last century, the celebrated Euler, has written\r\na whole book on the motion of a top, and his Latin treatise _De motu\r\nTurbinis_ is one of the most remarkable books on mechanics. The motion\r\nof a top is a matter of the greatest importance; it is applicable\r\nto the elucidation of some of the greatest phenomena of nature. In\r\nall these instances there is this wonderful tendency in rotation to\r\npreserve the axis of rotation unaltered.--_Prof. Airy’s Lect. on\r\nAstronomy._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH’S ANNUAL MOTION.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the Copernican view of our system, we must learn to\r\nlook upon the sun as the comparatively motionless centre about which\r\nthe earth performs an annual elliptic orbit of the dimensions and\r\nexcentricity, and with a velocity, regulated according to a certain\r\nassigned law; the sun occupying one of the foci of the ellipse, and\r\nfrom that station quietly disseminating on all sides its light and\r\nheat; while the earth travelling round it, and presenting itself\r\ndifferently to it at different times of the year and day, passes\r\nthrough the varieties of day and night, summer and winter, which we\r\nenjoy.--_Sir John Herschel’s Outlines of Astronomy._\r\n\r\nLaplace has shown that the length of the day has not varied the\r\nhundredth part of a second since the observations of Hipparchus, 2000\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTABILITY OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this question to analysis, Laplace found that the\r\n_equilibrium of the ocean is stable if its density is less than\r\nthe mean density of the earth_, and that its equilibrium cannot be\r\nsubverted unless these two densities are equal, or that of the earth\r\nless than that of its waters. The experiments on the attraction of\r\nSchehallien and Mont Cenis, and those made by Cavendish, Reich, and\r\nBaily, with balls of lead, demonstrate that the mean density of the\r\nearth is at least _five_ times that of water, and hence the stability\r\nof the ocean is placed beyond a doubt. As the seas, therefore, have at\r\none time covered continents which are now raised above their level,\r\nwe must seek for some other cause of it than any want of stability in\r\nthe equilibrium of the ocean. How beautifully does this conclusion\r\nillustrate the language of Scripture, “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no\r\nfurther”! (_Job_ xxxviii. 11.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPRESSION OF BODIES.\r\n\r\nSir John Leslie observes, that _air compressed_ into the fiftieth\r\npart of its volume has its elasticity fifty times augmented: if it\r\ncontinued to contract at that rate, it would, from its own incumbent\r\nweight, acquire the density of water at the depth of thirty-four\r\nmiles. But water itself would have its density doubled at the depth\r\nof ninety-three miles, and would attain the density of quicksilver at\r\nthe depth of 362 miles. In descending, therefore, towards the centre,\r\nthrough nearly 4000 miles, the condensation of ordinary substances\r\nwould surpass the utmost powers of conception. Dr. Young says, that\r\nsteel would be compressed into one-fourth, and stone into one-eighth,\r\nof its bulk at the earth’s centre.--_Mrs. Somerville._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD IN A NUTSHELL.\r\n\r\nFrom the many proofs of the non-contact of the atoms, even in the\r\nmost solid parts of bodies; from the very great space obviously\r\noccupied by pores--the mass having often no more solidity than a heap\r\nof empty boxes, of which the apparently solid parts may still be as\r\nporous in a second degree and so on; and from the great readiness\r\nwith which light passes in all directions through dense bodies, like\r\nglass, rock-crystal, diamond, &c., it has been argued that there is so\r\nexceedingly little of really solid matter even in the densest mass,\r\nthat _the whole world_, if the atoms could be brought into absolute\r\ncontact, _might be compressed into a nutshell_. We have as yet no means\r\nof determining exactly what relation this idea has to truth.--_Arnott._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF ATOMS.\r\n\r\nThe infinite groups of atoms flying through all time and space, in\r\ndifferent directions and under different laws, have interchangeably\r\ntried and exhibited every possible mode of rencounter: sometimes\r\nrepelled from each other by concussion; and sometimes adhering to each\r\nother from their own jagged or pointed construction, or from the casual\r\ninterstices which two or more connected atoms must produce, and which\r\nmay be just adapted to those of other figures,--as globular, oval, or\r\nsquare. Hence the origin of compound and visible bodies; hence the\r\norigin of large masses of matter; hence, eventually, the origin of the\r\nworld.--_Dr. Good’s Book of Nature._\r\n\r\nThe great Epicurus speculated on “the plastic nature” of atoms, and\r\nattributed to this _nature_ the power they possess of arranging\r\nthemselves into symmetric forms. Modern philosophers satisfy themselves\r\nwith attraction; and reasoning from analogy, imagine that each atom has\r\na polar system.--_Hunt’s Poetry of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE ATOMS OF THE ELEMENTS: DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER.\r\n\r\nSo minute are the parts of the elementary bodies in their ultimate\r\nstate of division, in which condition they are usually termed _atoms_,\r\nas to elude all our powers of inspection, even when aided by the most\r\npowerful microscopes. Who can see the particles of gold in a solution\r\nof that metal in _aqua regia_, or those of common salt when dissolved\r\nin water? Dr. Thomas Thomson has estimated the bulk of an ultimate\r\nparticle or atom of lead as less than 1/888492000000000th of a cubic\r\ninch, and concludes that its weight cannot exceed the 1/310000000000th\r\nof a grain.\r\n\r\nThis curious calculation was made by Dr. Thomson, in order to show to\r\nwhat degree Matter could be divided, and still be sensible to the eye.\r\nHe dissolved a grain of nitrate of lead in 500,000 grains of water,\r\nand passed through the solution a current of sulphuretted hydrogen;\r\nwhen the whole liquid became sensibly discoloured. Now, a grain of\r\nwater may be regarded as being almost equal to a drop of that liquid,\r\nand a drop may be easily spread out so as to cover a square inch of\r\nsurface. But under an ordinary microscope the millionth of a square\r\ninch may be distinguished by the eye. The water, therefore, could be\r\ndivided into 500,000,000,000 parts. But the lead in a grain of nitrate\r\nof lead weighs 0·62 of a grain; an atom of lead, accordingly, cannot\r\nweigh more than 1/810000000000th of a grain; while the atom of sulphur,\r\nwhich in combination with the lead rendered it visible, could not\r\nweigh more than 1/2015000000000, that is, the two-billionth part of a\r\ngrain.--_Professor Low_; _Jameson’s Journal_, No. 106.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF AIR.\r\n\r\nAir can be so rarefied that the contents of a cubic foot shall not\r\nweigh the tenth part of a grain: if a quantity that would fill a space\r\nthe hundredth part of an inch in diameter be separated from the rest,\r\nthe air will still be found there, and we may reasonably conceive that\r\nthere may be several particles present, though the weight is less than\r\nthe seventeen-hundred-millionth of a grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF THE PYRAMID.\r\n\r\nThe great reason of the duration of the pyramid above all other forms\r\nis, that it is most fitted to resist the force of gravitation. Thus the\r\nPyramids of Egypt are the oldest monuments in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nINERTIA ILLUSTRATED.\r\n\r\nMany things of common occurrence (says Professor Tyndall) are to be\r\nexplained by reference to the quality of inactivity. We will here state\r\na few of them.\r\n\r\nWhen a railway train is moving, if it strike against any obstacle which\r\narrests its motion, the passengers are thrown forward in the direction\r\nin which the train was proceeding. Such accidents often occur on a\r\nsmall scale, in attaching carriages at railway stations. The reason is,\r\nthat the passengers share the motion of the train, and, as matter, they\r\ntend to persist in motion. When the train is suddenly checked, this\r\ntendency exhibits itself by the falling forward referred to. In like\r\nmanner, when a train previously at rest is suddenly set in motion, the\r\ntendency of the passengers to remain at rest evinces itself by their\r\nfalling in a direction opposed to that in which the train moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEANING TOWER OF PISA.[7]\r\n\r\nSir John Leslie used to attribute the stability of this tower to\r\nthe cohesion of the mortar it is built with being sufficient to\r\nmaintain it erect, in spite of its being out of the condition required\r\nby physics--to wit, that “in order that a column shall stand, a\r\nperpendicular let fall from the centre of gravity must fall within the\r\nbase.” Sir John describes the Tower of Pisa to be in violation of this\r\nprinciple; but, according to later authorities, the perpendicular falls\r\nwithin the base.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PRESENTIMENTS OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCES.\r\n\r\nJacobi, in his researches on the mathematical knowledge of the\r\nGreeks, comments on “the profound consideration of nature evinced by\r\nAnaxagoras, in whom we read with astonishment a passage asserting that\r\nthe moon, if the centrifugal force were intermitted, would fall to the\r\nearth like a stone from a sling.” Anaxagoras likewise applied the same\r\ntheory of “falling where the force of rotation had been intermitted”\r\nto all the material celestial bodies. In Aristotle and Simplicius may\r\nalso be traced the idea of “the non-falling of heavenly bodies when the\r\nrotatory force predominates over the actual falling force, or downward\r\nattraction;” and Simplicius mentions that “water in a phial is not\r\nspilt when the movement of rotation is more rapid than the downward\r\nmovement of the water.” This is illustrated at the present day by\r\nrapidly whirling a pail half-filled with water without spilling a drop.\r\n\r\nPlato had a clearer idea than Aristotle of the _attractive force_\r\nexercised by the earth’s centre on all heavy bodies removed from\r\nit; for he was acquainted with the acceleration of falling bodies,\r\nalthough he did not correctly understand the cause. John Philoponus,\r\nthe Alexandrian, probably in the sixth century, was the first who\r\nascribed the movement of the heavenly bodies to a primitive impulse,\r\nconnecting with this idea that of the fall of bodies, or the tendency\r\nof all substances, whether heavy or light, to reach the ground. The\r\nidea conceived by Copernicus, and more clearly expressed by Kepler,\r\nwho even applied it to the ebb and flow of the ocean, received in 1666\r\nand 1674 a new impulse from Robert Hooke; and next Newton’s theory\r\nof gravitation presented the grand means of converting the whole of\r\nphysical astronomy into a true _mechanism of the heavens_.\r\n\r\nThe law of gravitation knows no exception; it accounts accurately for\r\nthe most complex motions of the members of our own system; nay more,\r\nthe paths of double stars, far removed from all appreciable effects\r\nof our portion of the universe, are in perfect accordance with its\r\ntheory.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIGHT OF FALLS.\r\n\r\nThe fancy of the Greeks delighted itself in wild visions of the height\r\nof falls. In Hesiod’s _Theogony_ it is said, speaking of the fall\r\nof the Titans into Tartarus, “if a brazen anvil were to fall from\r\nheaven nine days and nine nights long, it would reach the earth on the\r\ntenth.” This descent of the anvil in 777,600 seconds of time gives an\r\nequivalent in distance of 309,424 geographical miles (allowance being\r\nmade, according to Galle’s calculation, for the considerable diminution\r\nin force of attraction at planetary distances); therefore 1½ times the\r\ndistance of the moon from the earth. But, according to the _Iliad_,\r\nHephæstus fell down to Lemnos in one day; “when but a little breath was\r\nstill in him.”--_Note to Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE OF THE FALL OF BODIES.\r\n\r\nA body falls in gravity precisely 16-1/16 feet in a second, and the\r\nvelocity increases according to the squares of the time, viz.:\r\n\r\n    In ¼ (quarter of a second) a body falls           1 foot.\r\n       ½ (half a second)                              4 feet.\r\n       1 second                                      16  ”\r\n       2 ditto                                       64  ”\r\n       3 ditto                                      144  ”\r\n\r\nThe power of gravity at two miles distance from the earth is four times\r\nless than at one mile; at three miles nine times less, and so on. It\r\ngoes on lessening, but is never destroyed.--_Notes in various Sciences._\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF SPEED.\r\n\r\nA French scientific work states the ordinary rate to be:\r\n\r\n                                                    per second.\r\n    Of a man walking                                   4 feet.\r\n    Of a good horse in harness                        12  ”\r\n    Of a rein-deer in a sledge on the ice             26  ”\r\n    Of an English race-horse                          43  ”\r\n    Of a hare                                         88  ”\r\n    Of a good sailing ship                            19  ”\r\n    Of the wind                                       82  ”\r\n    Of sound                                        1038  ”\r\n    Of a 24-pounder cannon-ball                     1300  ”\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFTING HEAVY PERSONS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary pages in Sir David Brewster’s _Letters\r\non Natural Magic_ is the experiment in which a heavy man is raised\r\nwith the greatest facility when he is lifted up the instant that his\r\nown lungs, and those of the persons who raise him, are inflated with\r\nair. Thus the heaviest person in the party lies down upon two chairs,\r\nhis legs being supported by the one and his back by the other. Four\r\npersons, one at each leg, and one at each shoulder, then try to raise\r\nhim--the person to be raised giving two signals, by clapping his hands.\r\nAt the first signal, he himself and the four lifters begin to draw a\r\nlong and full breath; and when the inhalation is completed, or the\r\nlungs filled, the second signal is given for raising the person from\r\nthe chair. To his own surprise, and that of his bearers, he rises with\r\nthe greatest facility, as if he were no heavier than a feather. Sir\r\nDavid Brewster states that he has seen this inexplicable experiment\r\nperformed more than once; and he appealed for testimony to Sir Walter\r\nScott, who had repeatedly seen the experiment, and performed the part\r\nboth of the load and of the bearer. It was first shown in England by\r\nMajor H., who saw it performed in a large party at Venice, under the\r\ndirection of an officer of the American navy.[9]\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster (in a letter to _Notes and Queries_, No. 143)\r\nfurther remarks, that “the inhalation of the lifters the moment the\r\neffort is made is doubtless essential, and for this reason: when we\r\nmake a great effort, either in pulling or lifting, we always fill the\r\nchest with air previous to the effort; and when the inhalation is\r\ncompleted, we close the _rima glottidis_ to keep the air in the lungs.\r\nThe chest being thus kept expanded, the pulling or lifting muscles have\r\nreceived as it were a fulcrum round which their power is exerted; and\r\nwe can thus lift the greatest weight which the muscles are capable of\r\ndoing. When the chest collapses by the escape of the air, the lifters\r\nlose their muscular power; reinhalation of air by the liftee can\r\ncertainly add nothing to the power of the lifters, or diminish his\r\nown weight, which is only increased by the weight of the air which he\r\ninhales.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“FORCE CAN NEITHER BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Faraday, in his able inquiry upon “the Conservation of\r\nForce,” maintains that to admit that force may be destructible, or can\r\naltogether disappear, would be to admit that matter could be uncreated;\r\nfor we know matter only by its forces. From his many illustrations we\r\nselect the following:\r\n\r\n  The indestructibility of individual matter is a most important case\r\n  of the Conservation of Chemical Force. A molecule has been endowed\r\n  with powers which give rise in it to various qualities; and those\r\n  never change, either in their nature or amount. A particle of\r\n  oxygen is ever a particle of oxygen; nothing can in the least wear\r\n  it. If it enters into combination, and disappears as oxygen; if it\r\n  pass through a thousand combinations--animal, vegetable, mineral;\r\n  if it lie hid for a thousand years, and then be evolved,--it is\r\n  oxygen with the first qualities, neither more nor less. It has\r\n  all its original force, and only that; the amount of force which\r\n  it disengaged when hiding itself, has again to be employed in a\r\n  reverse direction when it is set at liberty: and if, hereafter,\r\n  we should decompose oxygen, and find it compounded of other\r\n  particles, we should only increase the strength of the proof of the\r\n  conservation of force; for we should have a right to say of these\r\n  particles, long as they have been hidden, all that we could say of\r\n  the oxygen itself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he adds:\r\n\r\n  Let us not admit the destruction or creation of force without clear\r\n  and constant proof. Just as the chemist owes all the perfection\r\n  of his science to his dependence on the certainty of gravitation\r\n  applied by the balance, so may the physical philosopher expect to\r\n  find the greatest security and the utmost aid in the principle\r\n  of the conservation of force. All that we have that is good and\r\n  safe--as the steam-engine, the electric telegraph, &c.--witness to\r\n  that principle; it would require a perpetual motion, a fire without\r\n  heat, heat without a source, action without reaction, cause without\r\n  effect, or effect without cause, to displace it from its rank as a\r\n  law of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING LOST IN THE MATERIAL WORLD.\r\n\r\n“It is remarkable,” says Kobell in his _Mineral Kingdom_, “how a change\r\nof place, a circulation as it were, is appointed for the inanimate or\r\nnaturally immovable things upon the earth; and how new conditions,\r\nnew creations, are continually developing themselves in this way. I\r\nwill not enter here into the evaporation of water, for instance from\r\nthe widely-spreading ocean; how the clouds produced by this pass over\r\ninto foreign lands and then fall again to the earth as rain, and how\r\nthis wandering water is, partly at least, carried along new journeys,\r\nreturning after various voyages to its original home: the mere\r\nmechanical phenomena, such as the transfer of seeds by the winds or by\r\nbirds, or the decomposition of the surface of the earth by the friction\r\nof the elements, suffice to illustrate this.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME AN ELEMENT OF FORCE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Faraday observes that Time is growing up daily into\r\nimportance as an element in the exercise of Force, which he thus\r\nstrikingly illustrates:\r\n\r\n  The earth moves in its orbit of time; the crust of the earth moves\r\n  in time; light moves in time; an electro-magnet requires time for\r\n  its charge by an electric current: to inquire, therefore, whether\r\n  power, acting either at sensible or insensible distances, always\r\n  acts in _time_, is not to be metaphysical; if it acts in time and\r\n  across space, it must act by physical lines of force; and our view\r\n  of the nature of force may be affected to the extremest degree\r\n  by the conclusions which experiment and observation on time may\r\n  supply, being perhaps finally determinable only by them. To inquire\r\n  after the possible time in which gravitating, magnetic, or electric\r\n  force is exerted, is no more metaphysical than to mark the times\r\n  of the hands of a clock in their progress; or that of the temple\r\n  of Serapis, and its ascents and descents; or the periods of the\r\n  occultation of Jupiter’s satellites; or that in which the light\r\n  comes from them to the earth. Again, in some of the known cases of\r\n  the action of time something happens while _the time_ is passing\r\n  which did not happen before, and does not continue after; it is\r\n  therefore not metaphysical to expect an effect in _every_ case, or\r\n  to endeavour to discover its existence and determine its nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULATION OF HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES.\r\n\r\nBy the assistance of a seconds watch the following interesting\r\ncalculations may be made:\r\n\r\n  If a traveller, when on a precipice or on the top of a building,\r\n  wish to ascertain the height, he should drop a stone, or any other\r\n  substance sufficiently heavy not to be impeded by the resistance of\r\n  the atmosphere; and the number of seconds which elapse before it\r\n  reaches the bottom, carefully noted on a seconds watch, will give\r\n  the height. For the stone will fall through the space of 16-1/8\r\n  feet during the first second, and will increase in rapidity as the\r\n  square of the time employed in the fall: if, therefore, 16-1/8 be\r\n  multiplied by the number of seconds the stone has taken to fall,\r\n  this product also multiplied by the same number of seconds will\r\n  give the height. Suppose the stone takes five seconds to reach the\r\n  bottom:\r\n\r\n    16-1/8 × 5 = 80-5/8 × 5 = 403-1/8, height of the precipice.\r\n\r\n  The Count Xavier de Maistre, in his _Expédition nocturne autour\r\n  de ma Chambre_, anxious to ascertain the exact height of his room\r\n  from the ground on which Turin is built, tells us he proceeded\r\n  as follows: “My heart beat quickly, and I just counted three\r\n  pulsations from the instant I dropped my slipper until I heard\r\n  the sound as it fell in the street, which, according to the\r\n  calculations made of the time taken by bodies in their accelerated\r\n  fall, and of that employed by the sonorous undulations of the\r\n  air to arrive from the street to my ear, gave the height of my\r\n  apartment as 94 feet 3 inches 1 tenth (French measure), supposing\r\n  that my heart, agitated as it was, beat 120 times in a minute.”\r\n\r\n  A person travelling may ascertain his rate of walking by the aid\r\n  of a slight string with a piece of lead at one end, and the use of\r\n  a seconds watch; the string being knotted at distances of 44 feet,\r\n  the 120th part of an English mile, and bearing the same proportion\r\n  to a mile that half a minute bears to an hour. If the traveller,\r\n  when going at his usual rate, drops the lead, and suffers the\r\n  string to slip through his hand, the number of knots which pass in\r\n  half a minute indicate the number of miles he walks in an hour.\r\n  This contrivance is similar to a _log-line_ for ascertaining a\r\n  ship’s rate at sea: the lead is enclosed in wood (whence the name\r\n  _log_), that it may float, and the divisions, which are called\r\n  _knots_, are measured for nautical miles. Thus, if ten knots are\r\n  passed in half a minute, they show that the vessel is sailing at\r\n  the rate of ten knots, or miles, an hour: a seconds watch would\r\n  here be of great service, but the half-minute sand-glass is in\r\n  general use.\r\n\r\n  The rapidity of a river may be ascertained by throwing in a light\r\n  floating substance, which, if not agitated by the wind, will move\r\n  with the same celerity as the water: the distance it floats in a\r\n  certain number of seconds will give the rapidity of the stream; and\r\n  this indicates the height of its source, the nature of its bottom,\r\n  &c.--See _Sir Howard Douglas on Bridges_. _Thomson’s Time and\r\n  Time-keepers._\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND IN THE HOUR-GLASS.\r\n\r\nIt is a noteworthy fact, that the flow of Sand in the Hour-glass is\r\nperfectly equable, whatever may be the quantity in the glass; that is,\r\nthe sand runs no faster when the upper half of the glass is quite full\r\nthan when it is nearly empty. It would, however, be natural enough to\r\nconclude, that when full of sand it would be more swiftly urged through\r\nthe aperture than when the glass was only a quarter full, and near the\r\nclose of the hour.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the even flow of sand may be proved by a very simple\r\nexperiment. Provide some silver sand, dry it over or before the fire,\r\nand pass it through a tolerably fine sieve. Then take a tube, of any\r\nlength or diameter, closed at one end, in which make a small hole, say\r\nthe eighth of an inch; stop this with a peg, and fill up the tube with\r\nthe sifted sand. Hold the tube steadily, or fix it to a wall or frame\r\nat any height from a table; remove the peg, and permit the sand to flow\r\nin any measure for any given time, and note the quantity. Then let the\r\ntube be emptied, and only half or a quarter filled with sand; measure\r\nagain for a like time, and the same quantity of sand will flow: even if\r\nyou press the sand in the tube with a ruler or stick, the flow of the\r\nsand through the hole will not be increased.\r\n\r\nThe above is explained by the fact, that when the sand is poured into\r\nthe tube, it fills it with a succession of conical heaps; and that all\r\nthe weight which the bottom of the tube sustains is only that of the\r\nheap which _first_ falls upon it, as the succeeding heaps do not press\r\ndownward, but only against the sides or walls of the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURE OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nBy means of a purely astronomical determination, based upon the action\r\nwhich the earth exerts on the motion of the moon, or, in other words,\r\non the inequalities in lunar longitudes and latitudes, Laplace has\r\nshown in one single result the mean Figure of the Earth.\r\n\r\n  It is very remarkable that an astronomer, without leaving his\r\n  observatory, may, merely by comparing his observations with\r\n  mean analytical results, not only be enabled to determine with\r\n  exactness the size and degree of ellipticity of the earth, but\r\n  also its distance from the sun and moon; results that otherwise\r\n  could only be arrived at by long and arduous expeditions to the\r\n  most remote parts of both hemispheres. The moon may therefore, by\r\n  the observation of its movements, render appreciable to the higher\r\n  departments of astronomy the ellipticity of the earth, as it taught\r\n  the early astronomers the rotundity of our earth by means of its\r\n  eclipses.--_Laplace’s Expos. du Syst. du Monde._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ASCERTAIN THE EARTH’S MAGNITUDE.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel gives the following means of approximation. It\r\nappears by observation that two points, each ten feet above the\r\nsurface, cease to be visible from each other over still water, and, in\r\naverage atmospheric circumstances, at a distance of about eight miles.\r\nBut 10 feet is the 528th part of a mile; so that half their distance,\r\nor four miles, is to the height of each as 4 × 528, or 2112:1, and\r\ntherefore in the same proportion to four miles is the length of the\r\nearth’s diameter. It must, therefore, be equal to 4 × 2112 = 8448, or\r\nin round numbers, about 8000 miles, which is not very far from the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n  The excess is, however, about 100 miles, or 1/80th part. As\r\n  convenient numbers to remember, the reader may bear in mind, that\r\n  in our latitude there are just as many thousands of feet in a\r\n  degree of the meridian as there are days in the year (365); that,\r\n  speaking loosely, a degree is about seventy British statute miles,\r\n  and a second about 100 feet; that the equatorial circumference of\r\n  the earth is a little less than 25,000 miles (24,899), and the\r\n  ellipticity or polar flattening amounts to 1/300th part of the\r\n  diameter.--_Outlines of Astronomy._\r\n\r\n\r\nMASS AND DENSITY OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the determination of the Mass and Density of the Earth\r\nby direct experiment, we have, in addition to the deviations of the\r\npendulum produced by mountain masses, the variation of the same\r\ninstruments when placed in a mine 1200 feet in depth. The most recent\r\nexperiments were conducted by Professor Airy, in the Harton coal-pit,\r\nnear South Shields:[10] the oscillations of the pendulum at the bottom\r\nof the pit were compared with those of a clock above; the beats of the\r\nclock were transferred below for comparison by an electrio wire; and it\r\nwas thus determined that a pendulum vibrating seconds at the mouth of\r\nthe pit would gain 2¼ seconds per day at its bottom. The final result\r\nof the calculations depending on this experiment, which were published\r\nin the _Philosophical Transactions_ of 1856, gives 6·565 for the mean\r\ndensity of the earth. The celebrated Cavendish experiment, by means\r\nof which the density of the earth was determined by observing the\r\nattraction of leaden balls on each other, has been repeated in a manner\r\nexhibiting an astonishing amount of skill and patience by the late Mr.\r\nF. Baily.[11] The result of these experiments, combined with those\r\npreviously made, gives as a mean result 5·441 as the earth’s density,\r\nwhen compared with water; thus confirming one of Newton’s astonishing\r\ndivinations, that the mean density of the earth would be found to be\r\nbetween five and six times that of water.\r\n\r\n  Humboldt is, however, of opinion that “we know only the mass of\r\n  the whole earth and its mean density by comparing it with the\r\n  open strata, which alone are accessible to us. In the interior of\r\n  the earth, where all knowledge of its chemical and mineralogical\r\n  character fails, we are limited to as pure conjecture as in the\r\n  remotest bodies that revolve round the sun. We can determine\r\n  nothing with certainty regarding the depth at which the geological\r\n  strata must be supposed to be in a state of softening or of liquid\r\n  fusion, of the condition of fluids when heated under an enormous\r\n  pressure, or of the law of the increase of density from the upper\r\n  surface to the centre of the earth.”--_Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nIn M. Foucault’s beautiful experiment, by means of the vibration of\r\na long pendulum, consisting of a heavy mass of metal suspended by a\r\nlong wire from a strong fixed support, is demonstrated to the eye\r\nthe rotation of the earth. The Gyroscope of the same philosopher\r\nis regarded not as a mere philosophical toy; but the principles of\r\ndynamics, by means of which it is made to demonstrate the earth’s\r\nrotation on its own axis, are explained with the greatest clearness.\r\nThus the ingenuity of M. Foucault, combined with a profound knowledge\r\nof mechanics, has obtained proofs of one of the most interesting\r\nproblems of astronomy from an unsuspected source.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AND MAN COMPARED.\r\n\r\nThe Earth--speaking roundly--is 8000 miles in diameter; the atmosphere\r\nis calculated to be fifty miles in altitude; the loftiest mountain peak\r\nis estimated at five miles above the level of the sea, for this height\r\nhas never been visited by man; the deepest mine that he has formed is\r\n1650 feet; and his own stature does not average six feet. Therefore, if\r\nit were possible for him to construct a globe 800 feet--or twice the\r\nheight of St. Paul’s Cathedral--in diameter, and to place upon any one\r\npoint of its surface an atom of 1/4380th of an inch in diameter, and\r\n1/720th of an inch in height, it would correctly denote the proportion\r\nthat man bears to the earth upon which he moves.\r\n\r\n  When by measurements, in which the evidence of the method advances\r\n  equally with the precision of the results, the volume of the earth\r\n  is reduced to the millionth part of the volume of the sun; when\r\n  the sun himself, transported to the region of the stars, takes\r\n  up a very modest place among the thousands of millions of those\r\n  bodies that the telescope has revealed to us; when the 38,000,000\r\n  of leagues which separate the earth from the sun have become, by\r\n  reason of their comparative smallness, a base totally insufficient\r\n  for ascertaining the dimensions of the visible universe; when even\r\n  the swiftness of the luminous rays (77,000 leagues per second)\r\n  barely suffices for the common valuations of science; when, in\r\n  short, by a chain of irresistible proofs, certain stars have\r\n  retired to distances that light could not traverse in less than a\r\n  million of years;--we feel as if annihilated by such immensities.\r\n  In assigning to man and to the planet that he inhabits so small a\r\n  position in the material world, astronomy seems really to have made\r\n  progress only to humble us.--_Arago._\r\n\r\n\r\nMEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH’S SURFACE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dove has shown, by taking at all seasons the mean of the\r\ntemperature of points diametrically opposite to each other, that the\r\nmean temperature _of the whole earth’s surface_ in June considerably\r\nexceeds that in December. This result, which is at variance with the\r\ngreater proximity of the sun in December, is, however, due to a totally\r\ndifferent and very powerful cause,--the greater amount of land in\r\nthat hemisphere which has its summer solstice in June (_i. e._ the\r\nnorthern); and the fact is so explained by him. The effect of land\r\nunder sunshine is to throw heat into the general atmosphere, and to\r\ndistribute it by the carrying power of the latter over the whole earth.\r\nWater is much less effective in this respect, the heat penetrating its\r\ndepths and being there absorbed; so that the surface never acquires\r\na very elevated temperature, even under the equator.--_Sir John\r\nHerschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH STATIONARY.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to Bessel, 25,000 cubic miles of water flow in\r\nevery six hours from one quarter of the earth to another, and the\r\ntemperature is augmented by the ebb and flow of every tide, all\r\nthat we know with certainty is, that the _resultant effect_ of all\r\nthe thermal agencies to which the earth is exposed has undergone\r\nno perceptible change within the historic period. We owe this fine\r\ndeduction to Arago. In order that the _date palm_ should ripen its\r\nfruit, the mean temperature of the place must exceed 70 deg. Fahr.;\r\nand, on the other hand, the _vine_ cannot be cultivated successfully\r\nwhen the temperature is 72 deg. or upwards. Hence the mean temperature\r\nof any place at which these two plants flourished and bore fruit must\r\nlie between these narrow limits, _i. e._ could not differ from 71 deg.\r\nFahr. by more than a single degree. Now from the Bible we learn that\r\nboth plants were _simultaneously_ cultivated in the central valleys\r\nof Palestine in the time of Moses; and its then temperature is thus\r\ndefinitively determined. It is the same at the present time; so that\r\nthe mean temperature of this portion of the globe has not sensibly\r\naltered in the course of thirty-three centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF CRYSTALLISATION.\r\n\r\nProfessor Plücker has ascertained that certain crystals, in particular\r\nthe cyanite, “point very well to the north by the magnetic power of the\r\nearth only. It is a true compass-needle; and more than that, you may\r\nobtain its declination.” Upon this Mr. Hunt remarks: “We must remember\r\nthat this crystal, the cyanite, is a compound of silica and alumina\r\nonly. This is the amount of experimental evidence which science has\r\nafforded in explanation of the conditions under which nature pursues\r\nher wondrous work of crystal formation. We see just sufficient of\r\nthe operation to be convinced that the luminous star which shines in\r\nthe brightness of heaven, and the cavern-secreted gem, are equally\r\nthe result of forces which are known to us in only a few of their\r\nmodifications.”--_Poetry of Science._\r\n\r\nGay Lussac first made the remark, that a crystal of potash-alum,\r\ntransferred to a solution of ammonia-alum, continued to increase\r\nwithout its form being modified, and might thus be covered with\r\nalternate layers of the two alums, preserving its regularity and proper\r\ncrystalline figure. M. Beudant afterwards observed that other bodies,\r\nsuch as the sulphates of iron and copper, might present themselves\r\nin crystals of the same form and angles, although the form was not a\r\nsimple one, like that of alum. But M. Mitscherlich first recognised\r\nthis correspondence in a sufficient number of cases to prove that it\r\nwas a general consequence of similarity of composition in different\r\nbodies.--_Graham’s Elements of Chemistry._\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMENSE CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\nCrystals are found in the most microscopic character, and of an\r\nexceedingly large size. A crystal of quartz at Milan is three feet and\r\na quarter long, and five feet and a half in circumference: its weight\r\nis 870 pounds. Beryls have been found in New Hampshire measuring four\r\nfeet in length.--_Dana._\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIBLE CRYSTALLISATION.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, in a lecture delivered by him at the Royal\r\nInstitution, London, on the properties of Ice, gave the following\r\ninteresting illustration of crystalline force. By perfectly cleaning a\r\npiece of glass, and placing on it a film of a solution of chloride of\r\nammonium or sal ammoniac, the action of crystallisation was shown to\r\nthe whole audience. The glass slide was placed in a microscope, and the\r\nelectric light passing through it was concentrated on a white disc. The\r\nimage of the crystals, as they started into existence, and shot across\r\nthe disc in exquisite arborescent and symmetrical forms, excited the\r\nadmiration of every one. The lecturer explained that the heat, causing\r\nthe film of moisture to evaporate, brought the particles of salt\r\nsufficiently near to exercise the crystalline force, the result being\r\nthe beautiful structure built up with such marvellous rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION OF MINERALOGY AND GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar characteristic of minerals, that while plants and\r\nanimals differ in various regions of the earth, mineral matter of the\r\nsame character may be discovered in any part of the world,--at the\r\nEquator or towards the Poles; at the summit of the loftiest mountains,\r\nand in works far beneath the level of the sea. The granite of Australia\r\ndoes not necessarily differ from that of the British islands; and ores\r\nof the same metals (the proper geological conditions prevailing) may\r\nbe found of the same general character in all regions. Climate and\r\ngeographical position have no influence on the composition of mineral\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThis uniformity may, in some measure, have induced philosophers to\r\nseek its extension to the forms of crystallography. About 1760 (says\r\nMr. Buckle, in his _History of Civilization_), Romé de Lisle set the\r\nfirst example of studying crystals, according to a scheme so large as\r\nto include all the varieties of their primary forms, and to account\r\nfor their irregularities and the apparent caprice with which they\r\nwere arranged. In this investigation he was guided by the fundamental\r\nassumption, that what is called an irregularity is in truth perfectly\r\nregular, and that the operations of nature are invariable. Haüy applied\r\nthis great idea to the almost innumerable forms in which minerals\r\ncrystallise. He thus achieved a complete union between mineralogy and\r\ngeometry; and, bringing the laws of space to bear on the molecular\r\narrangements of matter, he was able to penetrate into the intimate\r\nstructure of crystals. By this means he proved that the secondary\r\nforms of all crystals are derived from their primary forms by a\r\nregular process of decrement; and that when a substance is passing\r\nfrom a liquid to a solid state, its particles cohere, according to a\r\nscheme which provides for every possible change, since it includes\r\neven those subsequent layers which alter the ordinary type of the\r\ncrystal, by disturbing its natural symmetry. To ascertain that such\r\nviolations of symmetry are susceptible of mathematical calculation,\r\nwas to make a vast addition to our knowledge; and, by proving that\r\neven the most uncouth and singular forms are the natural results of\r\ntheir antecedents, Haüy laid the foundation of what may be called the\r\npathology of the inorganic world. However paradoxical such a notion may\r\nappear, it is certain that symmetry is to crystals what health is to\r\nanimals; so that an irregularity of shape in the first corresponds with\r\nan appearance of disease in the second.--See _Hist. Civilization_, vol.\r\ni.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRODUCTIVE CRYSTALLISATION.\r\n\r\nThe general belief that only organic beings have the power of\r\nreproducing lost parts has been disproved by the experiments of Jordan\r\non crystals. An octohedral crystal of alum was fractured; it was then\r\nreplaced in a solution, and after a few days its injury was seen to be\r\nrepaired. The whole crystal had of course increased in size; but the\r\nincrease on the broken surface had been so much greater that a perfect\r\noctohedral form was regained.--_G. H. Lewes._\r\n\r\nThis remarkable power possessed by crystals, in common with animals,\r\nof repairing their own injuries had, however, been thus previously\r\nreferred to by Paget, in his _Pathology_, confirming the experiments\r\nof Jordan on this curious subject: “The ability to repair the damages\r\nsustained by injury ... is not an exclusive property of living beings;\r\nfor even crystals will repair themselves when, after pieces have been\r\nbroken from them, they are placed in the same conditions in which they\r\nwere first formed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS BROKEN BY SAND.\r\n\r\nIn some glass-houses the workmen show glass which has been cooled in\r\nthe open air; on this they let fall leaden bullets without breaking the\r\nglass. They afterwards desire you to let a few grains of sand fall upon\r\nthe glass, by which it is broken into a thousand pieces. The reason\r\nof this is, that the lead does not scratch the surface of the glass;\r\nwhereas the sand, being sharp and angular, scratches it sufficiently to\r\nproduce the above effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSound and Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUNDING SAND.\r\n\r\nMr. Hugh Miller, the geologist, when in the island of Eigg, in the\r\nHebrides, observed that a musical sound was produced when he walked\r\nover the white dry sand of the beach. At each step the sand was driven\r\nfrom his footprint, and the noise was simultaneous with the scattering\r\nof the sand; the cause being either the accumulated vibrations of\r\nthe air when struck by the driven sand, or the accumulated sounds\r\noccasioned by the mutual impact of the particles of sand against each\r\nother. If a musket-ball passing through the air emits a whistling note,\r\neach individual particle of sand must do the same, however faint be\r\nthe note which it yields; and the accumulation of these infinitesimal\r\nvibrations must constitute an audible sound, varying with the number\r\nand velocity of the moving particles. In like manner, if two plates of\r\nsilex or quartz, which are but crystals of sand, give out a musical\r\nsound when mutually struck, the impact or collision of two minute\r\ncrystals or particles of sand must do the same, in however inferior a\r\ndegree; and the union of all these sounds, though singly imperceptible,\r\nmay constitute the musical notes of “the Mountain of the Bell” in\r\nArabia Petræa, or the lesser sounds of the trodden sea-beach of\r\nEigg.--_North-British Review_, No. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSITY OF SOUND IN RAREFIED AIR.\r\n\r\nThe experiences during ascents of the highest mountains are\r\ncontradictory. Saussure describes the sounds on the top of Mont Blanc\r\nas remarkably weak: a pistol-shot made no more noise than an ordinary\r\nChinese cracker, and the popping of a bottle of champagne was scarcely\r\naudible. Yet Martius, in the same situation, was able to distinguish\r\nthe voices of the guides at a distance of 1340 feet, and to hear the\r\ntapping of a lead pencil upon a metallic surface at a distance of from\r\n75 to 100 feet.\r\n\r\nMM Wertheim and Breguet have propagated sound over the wire of an\r\nelectric telegraph at the rate of 11,454 feet per second.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCE AT WHICH THE HUMAN VOICE MAY BE HEARD.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that the human voice, under favourable circumstances,\r\nis capable of filling a larger space than was ever probably enclosed\r\nwithin the walls of a single room. Lieutenant Foster, on Parry’s third\r\nArctic expedition, found that he could converse with a man across the\r\nharbour of Port Bowen, a distance of 6696 feet, or about one mile and a\r\nquarter. Dr. Young records that at Gibraltar the human voice has been\r\nheard at a distance of ten miles. If sound be prevented from spreading\r\nand losing itself in the air, either by a pipe or an extensive flat\r\nsurface, as a wall or still water, it may be conveyed to a great\r\ndistance. Biot heard a flute clearly through a tube of cast-iron (the\r\nwater-pipes of Paris) 3120 feet long: the lowest whisper was distinctly\r\nheard; indeed, the only way not to be heard was not to speak at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROAR OF NIAGARA.\r\n\r\nThe very nature of the sound of running water pronounces its origin\r\nto be the bursting of bubbles: the impact of water against water is a\r\ncomparatively subordinate cause, and could never of itself occasion the\r\nmurmur of a brook; whereas, in streams which Dr. Tyndall has examined,\r\nhe, in all cases where a ripple was heard, discovered bubbles caused by\r\nthe broken column of water. Now, were Niagara continuous, and without\r\nlateral vibration, it would be as silent as a cataract of ice. In all\r\nprobability, it has its “contracted sections,” after passing which\r\nit is broken into detached masses, which, plunging successively upon\r\nthe air-bladders formed by their precursors, suddenly liberate their\r\ncontents, and thus create _the thunder of the waterfall_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIGURES PRODUCED BY SOUND.\r\n\r\nStretch a sheet of wet paper over the mouth of a glass tumbler which\r\nhas a footstalk, and glue or paste the paper at the edges. When the\r\npaper is dry, strew dry sand thinly upon its surface. Place the tumbler\r\non a table, and hold immediately above it, and parallel to the paper,\r\na plate of glass, which you also strew with sand, having previously\r\nrubbed the edges smooth with emery powder. Draw a violin-bow along any\r\npart of the edges; and as the sand upon the glass is made to vibrate,\r\nit will form various figures, which will be accurately imitated by the\r\nsand upon the paper; or if a violin or flute be played within a few\r\ninches of the paper, they will cause the sand upon its surface to form\r\nregular lines and figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUNING-FORK A FLUTE-PLAYER.\r\n\r\nTake a common tuning-fork, and on one of its branches fasten with\r\nsealing-wax a circular piece of card of the size of a small wafer, or\r\nsufficient nearly to cover the aperture of a pipe, as the sliding of\r\nthe upper end of a flute with the mouth stopped: it may be tuned in\r\nunison with the loaded tuning-fork by means of the movable stopper or\r\ncard, or the fork may be loaded till the unison is perfect. Then set\r\nthe fork in vibration by a blow on the unloaded branch, and hold the\r\ncard closely over the mouth of the pipe, as in the engraving, when a\r\nnote of surprising clearness and strength will be heard. Indeed a flute\r\nmay be made to “speak” perfectly well, by holding close to the opening\r\na vibrating tuning-fork, while the fingering proper to the note of the\r\nfork is at the same time performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE JEW’S HARP.\r\n\r\nIf you cause the tongue of this little instrument to vibrate, it will\r\nproduce a very low sound; but if you place it before a cavity (as the\r\nmouth) containing a column of air, which vibrates much faster, but\r\nin the proportion of any simple multiple, it will then produce other\r\nhigher sounds, dependent upon the reciprocation of that portion of\r\nthe air. Now the bulk of air in the mouth can be altered in its form,\r\nsize, and other circumstances, so as to produce by reciprocation many\r\ndifferent sounds; and these are the sounds belonging to the Jew’s Harp.\r\n\r\nA proof of this fact has been given by Mr. Eulenstein, who fitted into\r\na long metallic tube a piston, which being moved, could be made to\r\nlengthen or shorten the efficient column of air within at pleasure. A\r\nJew’s Harp was then so fixed that it could be made to vibrate before\r\nthe mouth of the tube, and it was found that the column of air produced\r\na series of sounds, according as it was lengthened or shortened; a\r\nsound being produced whenever the length of the column was such that\r\nits vibrations were a multiple of those of the Jew’s Harp.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLAR AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT COMPARED.\r\n\r\nThe most intensely ignited solid (produced by the flame of Lieutenant\r\nDrummond’s oxy-hydrogen lamp directed against a surface of chalk)\r\nappears only as black spots on the disc of the sun, when held between\r\nit and the eye; or in other words, Drummond’s light is to the light of\r\nthe sun’s disc as 1 to 146. Hence we are doubly struck by the felicity\r\nwith which Galileo, as early as 1612, by a series of conclusions on\r\nthe smallness of the distance from the sun at which the disc of Venus\r\nwas no longer visible to the naked eye, arrived at the result that\r\nthe blackest nucleus of the sun’s spots was more luminous than the\r\nbrightest portions of the full moon. (See “The Sun’s Light compared\r\nwith Terrestrial Lights,” in _Things not generally Known_, pp. 4, 5.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCE OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Hunt, in a lecture delivered by him at the Russell\r\nInstitution, “On the Physics of a Sunbeam,” mentions some experiments\r\nby Lord Brougham on the sunbeam, in which, by placing the edge of a\r\nsharp knife just within the limit of the light, the ray was inflected\r\nfrom its previous direction, and coloured red; and when another knife\r\nwas placed on the opposite side, it was deflected, and the colour was\r\nblue. These experiments (says Mr. Hunt) seem to confirm Sir Isaac\r\nNewton’s theory, that light is a fluid emitted from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDULATORY SCALE OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe white light of the sun is well known to be composed of several\r\ncoloured rays; or rather, according to the theory of undulations, when\r\nthe rate at which a ray vibrates is altered, a different sensation\r\nis produced upon the optic nerve. The analytical examination of\r\nthis question shows that to produce a red colour the ray of light\r\nmust give 37,640 undulations in an inch, and 458,000,000,000,000 in\r\na second. Yellow light requires 44,000 undulations in an inch, and\r\n535,000,000,000,000 in a second; whilst the effect of blue results from\r\n51,110 undulations within an inch, and 622,000,000,000,000 of waves in\r\na second of time.--_Hunt’s Poetry of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIBILITY OF OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nIn terrestrial objects, the form, no less than the modes of\r\nillumination, determines the magnitude of the smallest angle of vision\r\nfor the naked eye. Adams very correctly observed that a long and\r\nslender staff can be seen at a much greater distance than a square\r\nwhose sides are equal to the diameter of the staff. A stripe may be\r\ndistinguished at a greater distance than a spot, even when both are of\r\nthe same diameter.\r\n\r\nThe _minimum_ optical visual angle at which terrestrial objects can\r\nbe recognised by the naked eye has been gradually estimated lower and\r\nlower, from the time when Robert Hooke fixed it exactly at a full\r\nminute, and Tobias Meyer required 34″ to perceive a black speck on\r\nwhite paper, to the period of Leuwenhoeck’s experiments with spiders’\r\nthreads, which are visible to ordinary sight at an angle of 4″·7. In\r\nHueck’s most accurate experiments on the problem of the movement of\r\nthe crystalline lens, white lines on a black ground were seen at an\r\nangle of 1″·2; a spider’s thread at 0″·6; and a fine glistening wire at\r\nscarcely 0″·2.\r\n\r\n  Humboldt, when at Chillo, near Quito, where the crests of the\r\n  volcano of Pichincha lay at a horizontal distance of 90,000 feet,\r\n  was much struck by the circumstance that the Indians standing near\r\n  distinguished the figure of Bonpland (then on an expedition to the\r\n  volcano), as a white point moving on the black basaltic sides of\r\n  the rock, sooner than Humboldt could discover him with a telescope.\r\n  Bonpland was enveloped in a white cotton poncho: assuming the\r\n  breadth across the shoulders to vary from three to five feet,\r\n  according as the mantle clung to the figure or fluttered in the\r\n  breeze, and judging from the known distance, the angle at which the\r\n  moving object could be distinctly seen varied from 7″ to 12″. White\r\n  objects on a black ground are, according to Hueck, distinguished at\r\n  a greater distance than black objects on a white ground.\r\n\r\n  Gauss’s heliotrope light has been seen with the naked eye reflected\r\n  from the Brocken on Hobenhagen at a distance of about 227,000 feet,\r\n  or more than 42 miles; being frequently visible at points in which\r\n  the apparent breadth of a three-inch mirror was only 0″·43.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLEST BRIGHT BODIES.\r\n\r\nEhrenberg has found from experiments on the dust of diamonds, that\r\na diamond superficies of 1/100th of a line in diameter presents a\r\nmuch more vivid light to the naked eye than one of quicksilver of the\r\nsame diameter. On pressing small globules of quicksilver on a glass\r\nmicrometer, he easily obtained smaller globules of the 1/100th to the\r\n1/2000th of a line in diameter. In the sunshine he could only discern\r\nthe reflection of light, and the existence of such globules as were\r\n1/300th of a line in diameter, with the naked eye. Smaller ones did\r\nnot affect his eye; but he remarked that the actual bright part of the\r\nglobule did not amount to more than 1/900th of a line in diameter.\r\nSpider threads of 1/2000th in diameter were still discernible from\r\ntheir lustre. Ehrenberg concludes that there are in organic bodies\r\nmagnitudes capable of direct proof which are in diameter 1/100000 of a\r\nline; and others, that can be indirectly proved, which may be less than\r\na six-millionth part of a Parisian line in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible so to strain the imagination as to conceive\r\nthe Velocity with which Light travels. “What mere assertion will make\r\nany man believe,” asks Sir John Herschel, “that in one second of time,\r\nin one beat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of light travels over\r\n192,000 miles; and would therefore perform the tour of the world in\r\nabout the same time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in\r\nmuch less time than a swift runner occupies in taking a single stride?”\r\nWere a cannon-ball shot directly towards the sun, and were it to\r\nmaintain its full speed, it would be twenty years in reaching it; and\r\nyet light travels through this space in seven or eight minutes.\r\n\r\nThe result given in the _Annuaire_ for 1842 for the velocity of light\r\nin a second is 77,000 leagues, which corresponds to 215,834 miles;\r\nwhile that obtained at the Pulkowa Observatory is 189,746 miles.\r\nWilliam Richardson gives as the result of the passage of light from the\r\nsun to the earth 8´ 19″·28, from which we obtain a velocity of 215,392\r\nmiles in a second.--_Memoirs of the Astronomical Society_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\nIn other words, light travels a distance equal to eight times the\r\ncircumference of the earth between two beats of a clock. This is a\r\nprodigious velocity; but the measure of it is very certain.--_Professor\r\nAiry._\r\n\r\nThe navigator who has measured the earth’s circuit by his hourly\r\nprogress, or the astronomer who has paced a degree of the meridian, can\r\nalone form a clear idea of velocity, when we tell him that light moves\r\nthrough a space equal to the circumference of the earth in _the eighth\r\npart of a second_--in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\n  Could an observer, placed in the centre of the earth, see this\r\n  moving light, as it describes the earth’s circumference, it would\r\n  appear a luminous ring; that is, the impression of the light at the\r\n  commencement of its journey would continue on the retina till the\r\n  light had completed its circuit. Nay, since the impression of light\r\n  continues longer than the _fourth_ part of a second, _two_ luminous\r\n  rings would be seen, provided the light made _two_ rounds of the\r\n  earth, and in paths not coincident.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nHumboldt enumerates the following different methods adopted for the\r\nMeasurement of Light: a comparison of the shadows of artificial lights,\r\ndiffering in numbers and distance; diaphragms; plane-glasses of\r\ndifferent thickness and colour; artificial stars formed by reflection\r\non glass spheres; the juxtaposition of two seven-feet telescopes,\r\nseparated by a distance which the observer could pass in about a\r\nsecond; reflecting instruments in which two stars can be simultaneously\r\nseen and compared, when the telescope has been so adjusted that the\r\nstar gives two images of like intensity; an apparatus having (in\r\nfront of the object-glass) a mirror and diaphragms, whose rotation\r\nis measured on a ring; telescopes with divided object-glasses, on\r\neither half of which the stellar light is received through a prism;\r\nastrometers, in which a prism reflects the image of the moon or\r\nJupiter, and concentrates it through a lens at different distances into\r\na star more or less bright.--_Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FIZEAU MEASURED THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished physicist has submitted the Velocity of Light\r\nto terrestrial measurement by means of an ingeniously constructed\r\napparatus, in which artificial light (resembling stellar light),\r\ngenerated from oxygen and hydrogen, is made to pass back, by means of\r\na mirror, over a distance of 28,321 feet to the same point from which\r\nit emanated. A disc, having 720 teeth, which made 12·6 rotations in a\r\nsecond, alternately obscured the ray of light and allowed it to be seen\r\nbetween the teeth on the margin. It was supposed, from the marking of\r\na counter, that the artificial light traversed 56,642 feet, or the\r\ndistance to and from the stations, in 1/1800th part of a second, whence\r\nwe obtain a velocity of 191,460 miles in a second.[12] This result\r\napproximates most closely to Delambre’s (which was 189,173 miles), as\r\nobtained from Jupiter’s satellites.\r\n\r\n  The invention of the rotating mirror is due to Wheatstone, who made\r\n  an experiment with it to determine the velocity of the propagation\r\n  of the discharge of a Leyden battery. The most striking application\r\n  of the idea was made by Fizeau and Foucault, in 1853, in carrying\r\n  out a proposition made by Arago, soon after the invention of the\r\n  mirror: we have here determined in a distance of twelve feet no\r\n  less than the velocity with which light is propagated, which is\r\n  known to be nearly 200,000 miles a second; the distance mentioned\r\n  corresponds therefore to the 77-millionth part of a second. The\r\n  object of these measurements was to compare the velocity of light\r\n  in air with its velocity in water; which, when the length is\r\n  greater, is not sufficiently transparent. The most complete optical\r\n  and mechanical aids are here necessary: the mirror of Foucault\r\n  made from 600 to 800 revolutions in a second, while that of Fizeau\r\n  performed 1200 to 1500 in the same time.--_Prof. Helmholtz on the\r\n  Methods of Measuring very small Portions of Time._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS DONE BY POLARISATION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nMalus, in 1808, was led by a casual observation of the light of the\r\nsetting sun, reflected from the windows of the Palais de Luxembourg,\r\nat Paris, to investigate more thoroughly the phenomena of double\r\nrefraction, of ordinary and of chromatic polarisation, of interference\r\nand of diffraction of light. Among his results may be reckoned the\r\nmeans of distinguishing between direct and reflected light; the power\r\nof penetrating, as it were, into the constitution of the body of\r\nthe sun and of its luminous envelopes; of measuring the pressure of\r\natmospheric strata, and even the smallest amount of water they contain;\r\nof ascertaining the depths of the ocean and its rocks by means of\r\na tourmaline plate; and in accordance with Newton’s prediction, of\r\ncomparing the chemical composition of several substances with their\r\noptical effects.\r\n\r\n  Arago, in a letter to Humboldt, states that by the aid of his\r\n  polariscope, he discovered, before 1820, that the light of all\r\n  terrestrial objects in a state of incandescence, whether they be\r\n  solid or liquid, is natural, so long as it emanates from the object\r\n  in perpendicular rays. On the other hand, if such light emanate\r\n  at an acute angle, it presents manifest proofs of polarisation.\r\n  This led M. Arago to the remarkable conclusion, that light is not\r\n  generated on the surface of bodies only, but that some portion is\r\n  actually engendered within the substance itself, even in the case\r\n  of platinum.\r\n\r\nA ray of light which reaches our eyes after traversing many millions\r\nof miles, from, the remotest regions of heaven, announces, as it were\r\nof itself, in the polariscope, whether it is reflected or refracted,\r\nwhether it emanates from a solid or fluid or gaseous body; it announces\r\neven the degree of its intensity.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vols. i. and ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTENESS OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThere is something wonderful, says Arago, in the experiments which have\r\nled natural philosophers legitimately to talk of the different sides of\r\na ray of light; and to show that millions and millions of these rays\r\ncan simultaneously pass through the eye of a needle without interfering\r\nwith each other!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nLight affects the respiration of animals just as it affects the\r\nrespiration of plants. This is novel doctrine, but it is demonstrable.\r\nIn the day-time we expire more carbonic acid than during the night; a\r\nfact known to physiologists, who explain it as the effect of sleep: but\r\nthe difference is mainly owing to the presence or absence of sunlight;\r\nfor sleep, as sleep, _increases_, instead of diminishing, the amount\r\nof carbonic acid expired, and a man sleeping will expire more carbonic\r\nacid than if he lies quietly awake under the same conditions of light\r\nand temperature; so that if less is expired during the night than\r\nduring the day, the reason cannot be sleep, but the absence of light.\r\nNow we understand why men are sickly and stunted who live in narrow\r\nstreets, alleys, and cellars, compared with those who, under similar\r\nconditions of poverty and dirt, live in the sunlight.--_Blackwood’s\r\nEdinburgh Magazine_, 1858.\r\n\r\n  The influence of light on the colours of organised creation is well\r\n  shown in the sea. Near the shores we find seaweeds of the most\r\n  beautiful hues, particularly on the rocks which are left dry by\r\n  the tides; and the rich tints of the actiniæ which inhabit shallow\r\n  water must often have been observed. The fishes which swim near the\r\n  surface are also distinguished by the variety of their colours,\r\n  whereas those which live at greater depths are gray, brown, or\r\n  black. It has been found that after a certain depth, where the\r\n  quantity of light is so reduced that a mere twilight prevails, the\r\n  inhabitants of the ocean become nearly colourless.--_Hunt’s Poetry\r\n  of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF LIGHT ON MUSCULAR FIBRES.\r\n\r\nThat light is capable of acting on muscular fibres, independently\r\nof the influence of the nerves, was mentioned by several of the old\r\nanatomists, but repudiated by later authorities. M. Brown Séquard has,\r\nhowever, proved to the Royal Society that some portions of muscular\r\nfibre--the iris of the eye, for example--are affected by light\r\nindependently of any reflex action of the nerves, thereby confirming\r\nformer experiences. The effect is produced by the illuminating rays\r\nonly, the chemical and heat rays remaining neutral. And not least\r\nremarkable is the fact, that the iris of an eel showed itself\r\nsusceptible of the excitement _sixteen days after the eyes were removed\r\nfrom the creature’s head_. So far as is yet known, this muscle is the\r\nonly one on which light thus takes effect.--_Phil. Trans. 1857._\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT NIGHTS.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, as well-attested facts prove, perfectly to explain\r\nthe operations at work in the much-contested upper boundaries of\r\nour atmosphere. The extraordinary lightness of whole nights in the\r\nyear 1831, during which small print might be read at midnight in\r\nthe latitudes of Italy and the north of Germany, is a fact directly\r\nat variance with all that we know, according to the most recent and\r\nacute researches on the crepuscular theory and the height of the\r\natmosphere.--_Biot._\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE OF PLANTS.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt recounts these striking instances. The leaves of the _œnothera\r\nmacrocarpa_ are said to exhibit phosphoric light when the air is\r\nhighly charged with electricity. The agarics of the olive-grounds of\r\nMontpelier too have been observed to be luminous at night; but they\r\nare said to exhibit no light, even in darkness, _during the day_. The\r\nsubterranean passages of the coal-mines near Dresden are illuminated by\r\nthe phosphorescent light of the _rhizomorpha phosphoreus_, a peculiar\r\nfungus. On the leaves of the Pindoba palm grows a species of agaric\r\nwhich is exceedingly luminous at night; and many varieties of the\r\nlichens, creeping along the roofs of caverns, lend to them an air of\r\nenchantment by the soft and clear light which they diffuse. In a small\r\ncave near Penryn, a luminous moss is abundant; it is also found in the\r\nmines of Hesse. According to Heinzmann, the _rhizomorpha subterranea_\r\nand _aidulæ_ are also phosphorescent.--See _Poetry of Science_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nBy microscopic examination of the myriads of minute insects which cause\r\nthis phenomenon, no other fact has been elicited than that they contain\r\na fluid which, when squeezed out, leaves a train of light upon the\r\nsurface of the water. The creatures appear almost invariably on the eve\r\nof some change of weather, which would lead us to suppose that their\r\nluminous phenomena must be connected with electrical excitation; and of\r\nthis Mr. C. Peach of Fowey has furnished the most satisfactory proofs\r\nyet obtained.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT FROM THE JUICE OF A PLANT.\r\n\r\nIn Brazil has been observed a plant, conjectured to be an Euphorbium,\r\nvery remarkable for the light which it yields when cut. It contains a\r\nmilky juice, which exudes as soon as the plant is wounded, and appears\r\nluminous for several seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT FROM FUNGUS.\r\n\r\nPhosphorescent funguses have been found in Brazil by Mr. Gardner,\r\ngrowing on the decaying leaves of a dwarf palm. They vary from one to\r\ntwo inches across, and the whole plant gives out at night a bright\r\nphosphorescent light, of a pale greenish hue, similar to that emitted\r\nby fire-flies and phosphorescent marine animals. The light given out by\r\na few of these fungi in a dark room is sufficient to read by. A very\r\nlarge phosphorescent species is occasionally found in the Swan River\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT FROM BUTTONS.\r\n\r\nUpon highly polished gilt buttons no figure whatever can be seen by the\r\nmost careful examination; yet, when they are made to reflect the light\r\nof the sun or of a candle upon a piece of paper held close to them,\r\nthey give a beautiful geometrical figure, with ten rays issuing from\r\nthe centre, and terminating in a luminous rim.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS OF SCRATCHES.\r\n\r\nAn extremely fine scratch on a well-polished surface may be regarded as\r\nhaving a concave, cylindrical, or at least a curved surface, capable of\r\nreflecting light in all directions; this is evident, for it is visible\r\nin all directions. Hence a single scratch or furrow in a surface may\r\nproduce colours by the interference of the rays reflected from its\r\nopposite edges. Examine a spider’s thread in the sunshine, and it will\r\ngleam with vivid colours. These may arise from a similar cause; or from\r\nthe thread itself, as spun by the animal, consisting of several threads\r\nagglutinated together, and thus presenting, not a cylindrical, but a\r\nfurrowed surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC BUST.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster has shown how the rigid features of a white bust\r\nmay be made to move and vary their expression, sometimes smiling and\r\nsometimes frowning, by moving rapidly in front of the bust a bright\r\nlight, so as to make the lights and shadows take every possible\r\ndirection and various degrees of intensity; and if the bust be placed\r\nbefore a concave mirror, its image may be made to do still more when it\r\nis cast upon wreaths of smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS HIT MOST FREQUENTLY DURING BATTLE.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from numerous observations that soldiers are hit\r\nduring battle according to the colour of their dress in the following\r\norder: red is the most fatal colour; the least fatal, Austrian gray.\r\nThe proportions are, red, 12; rifle-green, 7; brown, 6; Austrian\r\nbluish-gray, 5.--_Jameson’s Journal_, 1853.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSMUTATION OF TOPAZ.\r\n\r\nYellow topazes may be converted into pink by heat; but it is a mistake\r\nto suppose that in the process the yellow colour is changed into pink:\r\nthe fact is, that one of the pencils being yellow and the other pink,\r\nthe yellow is discharged by heat, thus leaving the pink unimpaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS AND TINTS.\r\n\r\nM. Chevreul, the _Directeur des Gobelins_, has presented to the French\r\nAcademy a plan for a universal chromatic scale, and a methodical\r\nclassification of all imaginable colours. Mayer, a professor at\r\nGöttingen, calculated that the different combinations of primitive\r\ncolours produced 819 different tints; but M. Chevreul established not\r\nless than 14,424, all very distinct and easily recognised,--all of\r\ncourse proceeding from the three primitive simple colours of the solar\r\nspectrum, red, yellow, and blue. For example, he states that in the\r\nviolet there are twenty-eight colours, and in the dahlia forty-two.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTS REALLY OF NO COLOUR.\r\n\r\nA body appears to be of the colour which it reflects; as we see it only\r\nby reflected rays, it can but appear of the colour of those rays. Thus\r\ngrass is green because it absorbs all except the green rays. Flowers,\r\nin the same manner, reflect the various colours of which they appear\r\nto us: the rose, the red rays; the violet, the blue; the daffodil,\r\nthe yellow, &c. But these are not the permanent colours of the grass\r\nand flowers; for wherever you see these colours, the objects must be\r\nilluminated; and light, from whatever source it proceeds, is of the\r\nsame nature, composed of the various coloured rays which paint the\r\ngrass, the flowers, and every coloured object in nature. Objects in\r\nthe dark have no colour, or are black, which is the same thing. You\r\ncan never see objects without light. Light is composed of colours,\r\ntherefore there can be no light without colours; and though every\r\nobject is black or without colour in the dark, it becomes coloured as\r\nsoon as it becomes visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIORAMA--WHY SO PERFECT AN ILLUSION.\r\n\r\nBecause when an object is viewed at so great a distance that the\r\noptic axes of both eyes are sensibly parallel when directed towards\r\nit, the perspective projections of it, seen by each eye separately,\r\nare similar; and the appearance to the two eyes is precisely the same\r\nas when the object is seen by one eye only. There is, in such case,\r\nno difference between the visual appearance of an object in relief\r\nand its perspective projection on a plane surface; hence pictorial\r\nrepresentations of distant objects, when those circumstances which\r\nwould prevent or disturb the illusion are carefully excluded, may be\r\nrendered such perfect resemblances of the objects they are intended to\r\nrepresent as to be mistaken for them. The Diorama is an instance of\r\nthis.--_Professor Wheatstone_; _Philosophical Transactions_, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS OPTICAL EFFECTS AT THE CAPE.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in his observatory at Feldhausen, at the base of\r\nthe Table Mountain, witnessed several curious optical effects, arising\r\nfrom peculiar conditions of the atmosphere incident to the climate of\r\nthe Cape. In the hot season “the nights are for the most part superb;”\r\nbut occasionally, during the excessive heat and dryness of the sandy\r\nplains, “the optical tranquillity of the air” is greatly disturbed.\r\nIn some cases, the images of the stars are violently dilated into\r\nnebular balls or puffs of 15′ in diameter; on other occasions they\r\nform “soft, round, quiet pellets of 3′ or 4′ diameter,” resembling\r\nplanetary nebulæ. In the cooler months the tranquillity of the image\r\nand the sharpness of vision are such, that hardly any limit is set\r\nto magnifying power but that which arises from the aberration of the\r\nspecula. On occasions like these, optical phenomena of extraordinary\r\nsplendour are produced by viewing a bright star through a diaphragm\r\nof cardboard or zinc pierced in regular patterns of circular holes by\r\nmachinery: these phenomena surprise and delight every person that sees\r\nthem. When close double stars are viewed with the telescope, with a\r\ndiaphragm in the form of an equilateral triangle, the discs of the two\r\nstars, which are exact circles, have a clearness and perfection almost\r\nincredible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TELESCOPE AND THE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nSo singular is the position of the Telescope and the Microscope among\r\nthe great inventions of the age, that no other process but that which\r\nthey embody could make the slightest approximation to the secrets which\r\nthey disclose. The steam-engine might have been imperfectly replaced\r\nby an air or an ether-engine; and a highly elastic fluid might have\r\nbeen, and may yet be, found, which shall impel the “rapid car,” or\r\ndrag the merchant-ship over the globe. The electric telegraph, now so\r\nperfect and unerring, might have spoken to us in the rude “language\r\nof chimes;” or sound, in place of electricity, might have passed along\r\nthe metallic path, and appealed to the ear in place of the eye. For\r\nthe printing-press and the typographic art might have been found a\r\nsubstitute, however poor, in the lithographic process; and knowledge\r\nmight have been widely diffused by the photographic printing powers\r\nof the sun, or even artificial light. But without the telescope and\r\nthe microscope, the human eye would have struggled in vain to study\r\nthe worlds beyond our own, and the elaborate structures of the organic\r\nand inorganic creation could never have been revealed.--_North-British\r\nReview_, No. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF THE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe earliest magnifying lens of which we have any knowledge was one\r\nrudely made of rock-crystal, which Mr. Layard found, among a number\r\nof glass bowls, in the north-west palace of Nimroud; but no similar\r\nlens has been found or described to induce us to believe that the\r\nmicroscope, either single or compound, was invented and used as an\r\ninstrument previous to the commencement of the seventeenth century.\r\nIn the beginning of the first century, however, Seneca alludes to the\r\nmagnifying power of a glass globe filled with water; but as he only\r\nstates that it made small and indistinct letters appear larger and more\r\ndistinct, we cannot consider such a casual remark as the invention of\r\nthe single microscope, though it might have led the observer to try the\r\neffect of smaller globes, and thus obtain magnifying powers sufficient\r\nto discover phenomena otherwise invisible.\r\n\r\nLenses of glass were undoubtedly in existence at the time of Pliny;\r\nbut at that period, and for many centuries afterwards, they appear\r\nto have been used only as burning or as reading glasses; and no\r\nattempt seems to have been made to form them of so small a size as\r\nto entitle them to be regarded even as the precursors of the single\r\nmicroscope.--_North-British Review_, No. 50.\r\n\r\n  The _rock-crystal lens_ found at Nineveh was examined by Sir\r\n  David Brewster. It was not entirely circular in its aperture. Its\r\n  general form was that of a plano-convex lens, the plane side having\r\n  been formed of one of the original faces of the six-sided crystal\r\n  quartz, as Sir David ascertained by its action on polarised light:\r\n  this was badly polished and scratched. The convex face of the lens\r\n  had not been ground in a dish-shaped tool, in the manner in which\r\n  lenses are now formed, but was shaped on a lapidary’s wheel, or in\r\n  some such manner. Hence it was unequally thick; but its extreme\r\n  thickness was 2/10ths of an inch, its focal length being 4½ inches.\r\n  It had twelve remains of cavities, which had originally contained\r\n  liquids or condensed gases. Sir David has assigned reasons why this\r\n  could not be looked upon as an ornament, but a true optical lens.\r\n  In the same ruins were found some decomposed glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE THE FISH-EYE MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nVery good microscopes may be made with the crystalline lenses of\r\nfish, birds, and quadrupeds. As the lens of fishes is spherical or\r\nspheroidal, it is absolutely necessary, previous to its use, to\r\ndetermine its optical axis and the axis of vision of the eye from which\r\nit is taken, and place the lens in such a manner that its axis is a\r\ncontinuation of the axis of our own eye. In no other direction but this\r\nis the albumen of which the lens consists symmetrically disposed in\r\nlaminæ of equal density round a given line, which is the axis of the\r\nlens; and in no other direction does the gradation of density, by which\r\nthe spherical aberration is corrected, preserve a proper relation to\r\nthe axis of vision.\r\n\r\n  When the lens of any small fish, such as a minnow, a par, or trout,\r\n  has been taken out, along with the adhering vitreous humour, from\r\n  the eye-ball by cutting the sclerotic coat with a pair of scissors,\r\n  it should be placed upon a piece of fine silver-paper previously\r\n  freed from its minute adhering fibres. The absorbent nature of\r\n  the paper will assist in removing all the vitreous humour from\r\n  the lens; and when this is carefully done, by rolling it about\r\n  with another piece of silver-paper, there will still remain,\r\n  round or near the equator of the lens, a black ridge, consisting\r\n  of the processes by which it was suspended in the eye-ball. The\r\n  black circle points out to us the true axis of the lens, which\r\n  is perpendicular to a plane passing through it. When the small\r\n  crystalline has been freed from all the adhering vitreous humour,\r\n  the capsule which contains it will have a surface as fine as a\r\n  pellicle of fluid. It is then to be dropped from the paper into a\r\n  cavity formed by a brass rim, and its position changed till the\r\n  black circle is parallel to the circular rim, in which case only\r\n  the axis of the lens will be a continuation of the axis of the\r\n  observer’s eye.--_Edin. Jour. Science_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUWENHOECK’S MICROSCOPES.\r\n\r\nLeuwenhoeck, the father of microscopical discovery, communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society, in 1673, a description of the structure of a bee and a\r\nlouse, seen by aid of his improved microscopes; and from this period\r\nuntil his decease in 1723, he regularly transmitted to the society his\r\nmicroscopical observations and discoveries, so that 375 of his papers\r\nand letters are preserved in the society’s archives, extending over\r\nfifty years. He further bequeathed to the Royal Society a cabinet of\r\ntwenty-six microscopes, which he had ground himself and set in silver,\r\nmostly extracted by him from minerals; these microscopes were exhibited\r\nto Peter the Great when he was at Delft in 1698. In acknowledging\r\nthe bequest, the council of the Royal Society, in 1724, presented\r\nLeuwenhoeck’s daughter with a handsome silver bowl, bearing the arms of\r\nthe society.--_Weld’s History of the Royal Society_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAMOND LENSES FOR MICROSCOPES.\r\n\r\nIn recommending the employment of Diamond and other gems in the\r\nconstruction of Microscopes, Sir David Brewster has been met with\r\nthe objection that they are too expensive for such a purpose; and,\r\nsays Sir David, “they certainly are for instruments intended merely\r\nto instruct and amuse. But if we desire to make great discoveries,\r\nto unfold secrets yet hid in the cells of plants and animals, we\r\nmust not grudge even a diamond to reveal them. If Mr. Cooper and Sir\r\nJames South have given a couple of thousand pounds a piece for a\r\nrefracting telescope, in order to study what have been miscalled ‘dots’\r\nand ‘lumps’ of light on the sky; and if Lord Rosse has expended far\r\ngreater sums on a reflecting telescope for analysing what has been\r\ncalled ‘sparks of mud and vapour’ encumbering the azure purity of the\r\nheavens,--why should not other philosophers open their purse, if they\r\nhave one, and other noblemen sacrifice some of their household jewels,\r\nto resolve the microscopic structures of our own real world, and\r\ndisclose secrets which the Almighty must have intended that we should\r\nknow?”--_Proceedings of the British Association_, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYE AND THE BRAIN SEEN THROUGH A MICROSCOPE.\r\n\r\nBy a microscopic examination of the retina and optic nerve and\r\nthe brain, M. Bauer found them to consist of globules of 1/2800th\r\nto 1/4000th an inch diameter, united by a transparent viscid and\r\ncoagulable gelatinous fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\nIf a hair be drawn between the finger and thumb, from the end to\r\nthe root, it will be distinctly felt to give a greater resistance\r\nand a different sensation to that which is experienced when drawn\r\nthe opposite way: in consequence, if the hair be rubbed between the\r\nfingers, it will only move one way (travelling in the direction of a\r\nline drawn from its termination to its origin from the head or body),\r\nso that each extremity may thus be easily distinguished, even in the\r\ndark, by the touch alone.\r\n\r\nThe mystery is resolved by the achromatic microscope. A hair viewed on\r\na dark ground as an _opaque_ object with a high power, not less than\r\nthat of a lens of one-thirtieth of an inch focus, and dully illuminated\r\nby a _cup_, the hair is seen to be indented with teeth somewhat\r\nresembling those of a coarse round rasp, but extremely irregular and\r\nrugged: as these incline all in one direction, like those of a common\r\nfile, viz. from the origin of the hair towards its extremity, it\r\nsufficiently explains the above singular property.\r\n\r\nThis is a singular proof of the acuteness of the sense of feeling, for\r\nthe said teeth may be felt much more easily than they can be seen. We\r\nmay thus understand why a razor will cut a hair in two much more easily\r\nwhen drawn against its teeth than in the opposite direction.--_Dr.\r\nGoring._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND THE SEA.\r\n\r\nWhat myriads has the microscope revealed to us of the rich luxuriance\r\nof animal life in the ocean, and conveyed to our astonished senses\r\na consciousness of the universality of life! In the oceanic depths\r\nevery stratum of water is animated, and swarms with countless hosts of\r\nsmall luminiferous animalcules, mammaria, crustacea, peridinea, and\r\ncircling nereides, which, when attracted to the surface by peculiar\r\nmeteorological conditions, convert every wave into a foaming band of\r\nflashing light.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE MICROSCOPE TO MINERALOGISTS.\r\n\r\nM. Dufour has shown that an imponderable quantity of a substance\r\ncan be crystallised; and that the crystals so obtained are quite\r\ncharacteristic of the substances, as of sugar, chloride of sodium,\r\narsenic, and mercury. This process may be extremely valuable to the\r\nmineralogist and toxicologist when the substance for examination is too\r\nsmall to be submitted to tests. By aid of the microscope, also, shells\r\nare measured to the thousandth part of an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINE DOWN OF QUARTZ.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster having broken in two a crystal of quartz of a smoky\r\ncolour, found both surfaces of the fracture absolutely black; and the\r\nblackness appeared at first sight to be owing to a thin film of opaque\r\nmatter which had insinuated itself into the crevice. This opinion,\r\nhowever, was untenable, as every part of the surface was black, and\r\nthe two halves of the crystals could not have stuck together had the\r\ncrevice extended across the whole section. Upon further examination Sir\r\nDavid found that the surface was perfectly transparent by transmitted\r\nlight, and that the blackness of the surfaces arose from their being\r\nentirely composed of _a fine down of quartz_, or of short and slender\r\nfilaments, whose diameter was so exceedingly small that they were\r\nincapable of reflecting a single ray of the strongest light; and they\r\ncould not exceed the _one third of the millionth part of an inch_. This\r\ncurious specimen is in the cabinet of her grace the Duchess of Gordon.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICROSCOPIC WRITING.\r\n\r\nProfessor Kelland has shown, in Paris, on a spot no larger than\r\nthe head of a small pin, by means of powerful microscopes, several\r\nspecimens of distinct and beautiful writing, one of them containing\r\nthe whole of the Lord’s Prayer written within this minute compass.\r\nIn reference to this, two remarkable facts in Layard’s latest work\r\non Nineveh show that the national records of Assyria were written on\r\nsquare bricks, in characters so small as scarcely to be legible without\r\na microscope; in fact, a microscope, as we have just shown, was found\r\nin the ruins of Nimroud.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A MAGIC MIRROR.\r\n\r\nDraw a figure with weak gum-water upon the surface of a convex mirror.\r\nThe thin film of gum thus deposited on the outline or details of the\r\nfigure will not be visible in dispersed daylight; but when made to\r\nreflect the rays of the sun, or those of a divergent pencil, will\r\nbe beautifully displayed by the lines and tints occasioned by the\r\ndiffraction of light, or the interference of the rays passing through\r\nthe film with those which pass by it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR DAVID BREWSTER’S KALEIDOSCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this instrument, constructed for the purpose of creating\r\nand exhibiting a variety of beautiful and perfectly symmetrical forms,\r\nfirst occurred to Sir David Brewster in 1814, when he was engaged in\r\nexperiments on the polarisation of light by successive reflections\r\nbetween plates of glass. The reflectors were in some instances inclined\r\nto each other; and he had occasion to remark the circular arrangement\r\nof the images of a candle round a centre, or the multiplication of the\r\nsectors formed by the extremities of the glass plates. In repeating\r\nat a subsequent period the experiments of M. Biot on the action of\r\nfluids upon light, Sir David Brewster placed the fluids in a trough,\r\nformed by two plates of glass cemented together at an angle; and the\r\neye being necessarily placed at one end, some of the cement, which had\r\nbeen pressed through between the plates, appeared to be arranged into a\r\nregular figure. The remarkable symmetry which it presented led to Dr.\r\nBrewster’s investigation of the cause of this phenomenon; and in so\r\ndoing he discovered the leading principles of the Kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of his friends, Dr. Brewster took out a patent for his\r\ninvention; in the specification of which he describes the kaleidoscope\r\nin two different forms. The instrument, however, having been shown\r\nto several opticians in London, became known before he could avail\r\nhimself of his patent; and being simple in principle, it was at once\r\nlargely manufactured. It is calculated that not less than 200,000\r\nkaleidoscopes were sold in three months in London and Paris; though out\r\nof this number, Dr. Brewster says, not perhaps 1000 were constructed\r\nupon scientific principles, or were capable of giving any thing like a\r\ncorrect idea of the power of his kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KALEIDOSCOPE THOUGHT TO BE ANTICIPATED.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh edition of a work on gardening and planting, published\r\nin 1739, by Richard Bradley, F.R.S., late Professor of Botany in the\r\nUniversity of Cambridge, we find the following details of an invention,\r\n“by which the best designers and draughtsmen may improve and help\r\ntheir fancies. They must choose two pieces of looking-glass of equal\r\nbigness, of the figure of a long square. These must be covered on\r\nthe back with paper or silk, to prevent rubbing off the silver. This\r\ncovering must be so put on that nothing of it appears about the edges\r\nof the bright side. The glasses being thus prepared, must be laid face\r\nto face, and hinged together so that they may be made to open and shut\r\nat pleasure like the leaves of a book.” After showing how various\r\nfigures are to be looked at in these glasses under the same opening,\r\nand how the same figure may be varied under the different openings, the\r\ningenious artist thus concludes: “If it should happen that the reader\r\nhas any number of plans for parterres or wildernesses by him, he may by\r\nthis method alter them at his pleasure, and produce such innumerable\r\nvarieties as it is not possible the most able designer could ever have\r\ncontrived.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGIC OF PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nProfessor Moser of Königsberg has discovered that all bodies, even\r\nin the dark, throw out invisible rays; and that these bodies, when\r\nplaced at a small distance from polished surfaces of all kinds, depict\r\nthemselves upon such surfaces in forms which remain invisible till\r\nthey are developed by the human breath or by the vapours of mercury or\r\niodine. Even if the sun’s image is made to pass over a plate of glass,\r\nthe light tread of its rays will leave behind it an invisible track,\r\nwhich the human breath will instantly reveal.\r\n\r\n  Among the early attempts to take pictures by the rays of the sun\r\n  was a very interesting and successful experiment made by Dr. Thomas\r\n  Young. In 1802, when Mr. Wedgewood was “making profiles by the\r\n  agency of light,” and Sir Humphry Davy was “copying on prepared\r\n  paper the images of small objects produced by means of the solar\r\n  microscope,” Dr. Young was taking photographs upon paper dipped in\r\n  a solution of nitrate of silver, of the coloured rings observed\r\n  by Newton; and his experiments clearly proved that the agent was\r\n  not the luminous rays in the sun’s light, but the invisible or\r\n  chemical rays beyond the violet. This experiment is described in\r\n  the Bakerian Lecture, 1803.\r\n\r\n  Niepce (says Mr. Hunt) pursued a physical investigation of the\r\n  curious change, and found that all bodies were influenced by this\r\n  principle radiated from the sun. Daguerre[14] produced effects from\r\n  the solar pencil which no artist could approach; and Talbot and\r\n  others extended the application. Herschel took up the inquiry; and\r\n  he, with his usual power of inductive search and of philosophical\r\n  deduction, presented the world with a class of discoveries which\r\n  showed how vast a field of investigation was opening for the\r\n  younger races of mankind.\r\n\r\n  The first attempts in photography, which were made at the\r\n  instigation of M. Arago, by order of the French Government, to\r\n  copy the Egyptian tombs and temples and the remains of the Aztecs\r\n  in Central America, were failures. Although the photographers\r\n  employed succeeded to admiration, in Paris, in producing pictures\r\n  in a few minutes, they found often that an exposure of an hour\r\n  was insufficient under the bright and glowing illumination of a\r\n  southern sky.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEST SKY FOR PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nContrary to all preconceived ideas, experience proves that the brighter\r\nthe sky that shines above the camera the more tardy the action within\r\nit. Italy and Malta do their work slower than Paris. Under the\r\nbrilliant light of a Mexican sun, half an hour is required to produce\r\neffects which in England would occupy but a minute. In the burning\r\natmosphere of India, though photographical the year round, the process\r\nis comparatively slow and difficult to manage; while in the clear,\r\nbeautiful, and moreover cool, light of the higher Alps of Europe, it\r\nhas been proved that the production of a picture requires many more\r\nminutes, even with the most sensitive preparations, than in the murky\r\natmosphere of London. Upon the whole, the temperate skies of this\r\ncountry may be pronounced favourable to photographic action; a fact\r\nfor which the prevailing characteristic of our climate may partially\r\naccount, humidity being an indispensable condition for the working\r\nstate both of paper and chemicals.--_Quarterly Review_, No. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nThe following authenticated instances of this singular phenomenon have\r\nbeen communicated to the Royal Society by Andrés Poey, Director of the\r\nObservatory at Havana:\r\n\r\n  Benjamin Franklin, in 1786, stated that about twenty years\r\n  previous, a man who was standing opposite a tree that had just been\r\n  struck by “a thunderbolt” had on his breast an exact representation\r\n  of that tree.\r\n\r\n  In the New-York _Journal of Commerce_, August 26th, 1853, it is\r\n  related that “a little girl was standing at a window, before which\r\n  was a young maple-tree; after a brilliant flash of lightning, a\r\n  complete image of the tree was found imprinted on her body.”\r\n\r\n  M. Raspail relates that, in 1855, a boy having climbed a tree for\r\n  the purpose of robbing a bird’s nest, the tree was struck, and\r\n  the boy thrown upon the ground; on his breast the image of the\r\n  tree, with the bird and nest on one of its branches, appeared very\r\n  plainly.\r\n\r\n  M. Olioli, a learned Italian, brought before the Scientific\r\n  Congress at Naples the following four instances: 1. In September\r\n  1825, the foremast of a brigantine in the Bay of St. Arniro\r\n  was struck by lightning, when a sailor sitting under the mast\r\n  was struck dead, and on his back was found an impression of a\r\n  horse-shoe, similar even in size to that fixed on the mast-head. 2.\r\n  A sailor, standing in a similar position, was struck by lightning,\r\n  and had on his left breast the impression of the number 4 4, with a\r\n  dot between the two figures, just as they appeared at the extremity\r\n  of one of the masts. 3. On the 9th October 1836, a young man was\r\n  found struck by lightning; he had on a girdle, with some gold\r\n  coins in it, which were imprinted on his skin in the order they\r\n  were placed in the girdle,--a series of circles, with one point of\r\n  contact, being plainly visible. 4. In 1847, Mme. Morosa, an Italian\r\n  lady of Lugano, was sitting near a window during a thunderstorm,\r\n  and perceived the commotion, but felt no injury; but a flower which\r\n  happened to be in the path of the electric current was perfectly\r\n  reproduced on one of her legs, and there remained permanently.\r\n\r\n  M. Poey himself witnessed the following instance in Cuba. On July\r\n  24th, 1852, a poplar-tree in a coffee-plantation was struck by\r\n  lightning, and on one of the large dry leaves was found an exact\r\n  representation of some pine-trees that lay 367 yards distant.\r\n\r\nM. Poey considers these lightning impressions to have been produced\r\nin the same manner as the electric images obtained by Moser, Riess,\r\nKarster, Grove, Fox Talbot, and others, either by statical or dynamical\r\nelectricity of different intensities. The fact that impressions are\r\nmade through the garments is easily accounted for by their rough\r\ntexture not preventing the lightning passing through them with the\r\nimpression. To corroborate this view, M. Poey mentions an instance of\r\nlightning passing down a chimney into a trunk, in which was found an\r\ninch depth of soot, which must have passed through the wood itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHIC SURVEYING.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1854, in the Baltic, the British steamers employed\r\nin examining the enemy’s coasts and fortifications took photographic\r\nviews for reference and minute examination. With the steamer moving\r\nat the rate of fifteen knots an hour, the most perfect definitions of\r\ncoasts and batteries were obtained. Outlines of the coasts, correct in\r\nheight and distance, have been faithfully transcribed; and all details\r\nof the fortresses passed under this photographic review are accurately\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n  It is curious to reflect that the aids to photographic development\r\n  all date within the last half-century, and are but little older\r\n  than photography itself. It was not until 1811 that the chemical\r\n  substance called iodine, on which the foundations of all popular\r\n  photography rest, was discovered at all; bromine, the only other\r\n  substance equally sensitive, not till 1826. The invention of the\r\n  electro process was about simultaneous with that of photography\r\n  itself. Gutta-percha only just preceded the substance of which\r\n  collodion is made; the ether and chloroform, which are used in\r\n  some methods, that of collodion. We say nothing of the optical\r\n  improvements previously contrived or adapted for the purpose of the\r\n  photograph: the achromatic lenses, which correct the discrepancy\r\n  between the visual and chemical foci; the double lenses, which\r\n  increase the force of the action; the binocular lenses, which\r\n  do the work of the stereoscope; nor of the innumerable other\r\n  mechanical aids which have sprung up for its use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEREOSCOPE AND THE PHOTOGRAPH.\r\n\r\nWhen once the availability of one great primitive agent is worked out,\r\nit is easy to foresee how extensively it will assist in unravelling\r\nother secrets in natural science. The simple principle of the\r\nStereoscope, for instance, might have been discovered a century ago,\r\nfor the reasoning which led to it was independent of all the properties\r\nof light; but it could never have been illustrated, far less multiplied\r\nas it now is, without Photography. A few diagrams, of sufficient\r\nidentity and difference to prove the truth of the principle, might\r\nhave been constructed by hand, for the gratification of a few sages;\r\nbut no artist, it is to be hoped, could have been found possessing\r\nthe requisite ability and stupidity to execute the two portraits, or\r\ntwo groups, or two interiors, or two landscapes, identical in every\r\nminutia of the most elaborate detail, and yet differing in point of\r\nview by the inch between the two human eyes, by which the principle is\r\nbrought to the level of any capacity. Here, therefore, the accuracy and\r\ninsensibility of a machine could alone avail; and if in the order of\r\nthings the cheap popular toy which the stereoscope now represents was\r\nnecessary for the use of man, the photograph was first necessary for\r\nthe service of the stereoscope.--_Quarterly Review_, No. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEREOSCOPE SIMPLIFIED.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at any round object, first with one eye, and then with\r\nthe other, we discover that with the right eye we see most of the\r\nright-hand side of the object, and with the left eye most of the\r\nleft-hand side. These two images are combined, and we see an object\r\nwhich we know to be round.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated by the _Stereoscope_, which consists of two mirrors\r\nplaced each at an angle of 45 deg., or of two semi-lenses turned with\r\ntheir curved sides towards each other. To view its phenomena two\r\npictures are obtained by the camera on photographic paper of any object\r\nin two positions, corresponding with the conditions of viewing it with\r\nthe two eyes. By the mirrors on the lenses these dissimilar pictures\r\nare combined within the eye, and the vision of an actually solid object\r\nis produced from the pictures represented on a plane surface. Hence the\r\nname of the instrument, which signifies _Solid I see_.--_Hunt’s Poetry\r\nof Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTO-GALVANIC ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\nThat which was the chief aid of Niepce in the humblest dawn of the\r\nart, viz. to transform the photographic plate into a surface capable\r\nof being printed, is in the above process done by the coöperation of\r\nElectricity with Photography. This invention of M. Pretsch, of Vienna,\r\ndiffers from all other attempts for the same purpose in not operating\r\nupon the photographic tablet itself, and by discarding the usual means\r\nof varnishes and bitings-in. The process is simply this: A glass tablet\r\nis coated with gelatine diluted till it forms a jelly, and containing\r\nbi-chromate of potash, nitrate of silver, and iodide of potassium. Upon\r\nthis, when dry, is placed face downwards a paper positive, through\r\nwhich the light, being allowed to fall, leaves upon the gelatine a\r\nrepresentation of the print. It is then soaked in water; and while\r\nthe parts acted upon by the light are comparatively unaffected by the\r\nfluid, the remainder of the jelly swells, and rising above the general\r\nsurface, gives a picture in relief, resembling an ordinary engraving\r\nupon wood. Of this intaglio a cast is now taken in gutta-percha, to\r\nwhich the electro process in copper being applied, a plate or matrix is\r\nproduced, bearing on it an exact repetition of the original positive\r\npicture. All that now remains to be done is to repeat the electro\r\nprocess; and the result is a copper-plate in the necessary relievo, of\r\nwhich it has been said nature furnished the materials and science the\r\nartist, the inferior workman being only needed to roll it through the\r\npress.--_Quarterly Review_, No. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE OF THE SOAP-BUBBLE.\r\n\r\nFew of the minor ingenuities of mankind have amused so many individuals\r\nas the blowing of bubbles with soap-lather from the bowl of a\r\ntobacco-pipe; yet how few who in childhood’s careless hours have thus\r\namused themselves, have in after-life become acquainted with the\r\nbeautiful phenomena of light which the soap-bubble will enable us to\r\nillustrate!\r\n\r\nUsually the bubble is formed within the bowl of a tobacco-pipe, and\r\nso inflated by blowing through the stem. It is also produced by\r\nintroducing a capillary tube under the surface of soapy water, and so\r\nraising a bubble, which may be inflated to any convenient size. It is\r\nthen guarded with a glass cover, to prevent its bursting by currents of\r\nair, evaporation, and other causes.\r\n\r\nWhen the bubble is first blown, its form is elliptical, into which it\r\nis drawn by its gravity being resisted; but the instant it is detached\r\nfrom the pipe, and allowed to float in air, it becomes a perfect\r\nsphere, since the air within presses equally in all directions. There\r\nis also a strong cohesive attraction in the particles of soap and\r\nwater, after having been forcibly distended; and as a sphere or globe\r\npossesses less surface than any other figure of equal capacity, it is\r\nof all forms the best adapted to the closest approximation of the\r\nparticles of soap and water, which is another reason why the bubble\r\nis globular. The film of which the bubble consists is inconceivably\r\nthin (not exceeding the two-millionth part of an inch); and by the\r\nevaporation from its surface, the contraction and expansion of the air\r\nwithin, and the tendency of the soap-lather to gravitate towards the\r\nlower part of the bubble, and consequently to render the upper part\r\nstill thinner, it follows that the bubble lasts but a few seconds. If,\r\nhowever, it were blown in a glass vessel, and the latter immediately\r\nclosed, it might remain for some time; Dr. Paris thus preserved a\r\nbubble for a considerable period.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooke, by means of the coloured rings upon the soap-bubble, studied\r\nthe curious subject of the colours of thin plates, and its application\r\nto explain the colours of natural bodies. Various phenomena were also\r\ndiscovered by Newton, who thus did not disdain to make a soap-bubble\r\nthe object of his study. The colours which are reflected from the upper\r\nsurface of the bubble are caused by the decomposition of the light\r\nwhich falls upon it; and the range of the phenomena is alike extensive\r\nand beautiful.[15]\r\n\r\nNewton (says Sir D. Brewster), having covered the soap-bubble with a\r\nglass shade, saw its colours emerge in regular order, like so many\r\nconcentric rings encompassing the top of it. As the bubble grew thinner\r\nby the continual subsidence of the water, the rings dilated slowly,\r\nand overspread the whole of it, descending to the bottom, where they\r\nvanished successively. When the colours had all emerged from the top,\r\nthere arose in the centre of the rings a small round black spot,\r\ndilating it to more than half an inch in breadth till the bubble\r\nburst. Upon examining the rings between the object-glasses, Newton\r\nfound that when they were only _eight_ or _nine_ in number, more than\r\n_forty_ could be seen by viewing them through a prism; and even when\r\nthe plate of air seemed all over uniformly white, multitudes of rings\r\nwere disclosed by the prism. By means of these observations Newton was\r\nenabled to form his _Scale of Colours_, of great value in all optical\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\nDr. Reade has thus produced a permanent soap-bubble:\r\n\r\n  Put into a six-ounce phial two ounces of distilled water, and set\r\n  the phial in a vessel of water boiling on the fire. The water in\r\n  the phial will soon boil, and steam will issue from its mouth,\r\n  expelling the whole of the atmospheric air from within. Then throw\r\n  in a piece of soap about the size of a small pea, cork the phial,\r\n  and at the same instant remove it and the vessel from the fire.\r\n  Then press the cork farther into the neck of the phial, and cover\r\n  it thickly with sealing-wax; and when the contents are cold, a\r\n  perfect vacuum will be formed within the bottle,--much better,\r\n  indeed, than can be produced by the best-constructed air-pump.\r\n\r\n  To form a bubble, hold the bottle horizontally in both hands, and\r\n  give it a sudden upward motion, which will throw the liquid into a\r\n  wave, whose crest touching the upper interior surface of the phial,\r\n  the tenacity of the liquid will cause a film to be retained all\r\n  round the phial. Next place the phial on its bottom; when the film\r\n  will form a section of the cylinder, being nearly but never quite\r\n  horizontal. The film will be now colourless, since it reflects all\r\n  the light which falls upon it. By remaining at rest for a minute or\r\n  two, minute currents of lather will descend by their gravitating\r\n  force down the inclined plane formed by the film, the upper part of\r\n  which thus becomes drained to the necessary thinness; and this is\r\n  the part to be observed.\r\n\r\nSeveral concentric segments of coloured rings are produced; the\r\ncolours, beginning from the top, being as follows:\r\n\r\n    _1st order_: Black, white, yellow, orange, red.\r\n    _2d order_: Purple, blue, white, yellow, red.\r\n    _3d order_: Purple, blue, green, yellowish-green, white, red.\r\n    _4th order_: Purple, blue, green, white, red.\r\n    _5th order_: Greenish-blue, very pale red.\r\n    _6th order_: Greenish-blue, pink.\r\n    _7th order_: Greenish-blue, pink.\r\n\r\nAs the segments advance they get broader, while the film becomes\r\nthinner and thinner. The several orders disappear upwards as the film\r\nbecomes too thin to reflect their colours, until the first order alone\r\nremains, occupying the whole surface of the film. Of this order the\r\nred disappears first, then the orange, and lastly the yellow. The film\r\nis now divided by a line into two nearly equal portions, one black and\r\nthe other white. This remains for some time; at length the film becomes\r\ntoo thin to hold together, and then vanishes. The colours are not faint\r\nand imperfect, but well defined, glowing with gorgeous hues, or melting\r\ninto tints so exquisite as to have no rival through the whole circle\r\nof the arts. We quote these details from Mr. Tomlinson’s excellent\r\n_Student’s Manual of Natural Philosophy_.\r\n\r\n  We find the following anecdote related of Newton at the above\r\n  period. When Sir Isaac changed his residence, and went to live in\r\n  St. Martin’s Street, Leicester Square, his next-door neighbour was\r\n  a widow lady, who was much puzzled by the little she observed of\r\n  the habits of the philosopher. A Fellow of the Royal Society called\r\n  upon her one day, when, among her domestic news, she mentioned that\r\n  some one had come to reside in the adjoining house who, she felt\r\n  certain, was a poor crazy gentleman, “because,” she continued,\r\n  “he diverts himself in the oddest way imaginable. Every morning,\r\n  when the sun shines so brightly that we are obliged to draw the\r\n  window-blinds, he takes his seat on a little stool before a tub\r\n  of soapsuds, and occupies himself for hours blowing soap-bubbles\r\n  through a common clay-pipe, which bubbles he intently watches\r\n  floating about till they burst. He is doubtless,” she added, “now\r\n  at his favourite amusement, for it is a fine day; do come and look\r\n  at him.” The gentleman smiled, and they went upstairs; when, after\r\n  looking through the staircase-window into the adjoining court-yard,\r\n  he turned and said: “My dear madam, the person whom you suppose\r\n  to be a poor lunatic is no other than the great Sir Isaac Newton\r\n  studying the refraction of light upon thin plates; a phenomenon\r\n  which is beautifully exhibited on the surface of a common\r\n  soap-bubble.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT FROM QUARTZ.\r\n\r\nAmong natural phenomena (says Sir David Brewster) illustrative of the\r\ncolours of thin plates, we find none more remarkable than one exhibited\r\nby the fracture of a large crystal of quartz of a smoky colour, and\r\nabout two and a quarter inches in diameter. The surface of fracture,\r\nin place of being a face or cleavage, or irregularly conchoidal, as we\r\nhave sometimes seen it, was filamentous, like a surface of velvet, and\r\nconsisted of short fibres, so small as to be incapable of reflecting\r\nlight. Their size could not have been greater than the third of the\r\nmillionth part of an inch, or one-fourth of the thinnest part of the\r\nsoap-bubble when it exhibits the black spot where it bursts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN THE CAT SEE IN THE DARK?\r\n\r\nNo, in all probability, says the reader; but the opposite popular\r\nbelief is supported by eminent naturalists.\r\n\r\n  Buffon says: “The eyes of the cat shine in the dark somewhat like\r\n  diamonds, which throw out during the night the light with which\r\n  they were in a manner impregnated during the day.”\r\n\r\n  Valmont de Bamare says: “The pupil of the cat is during the night\r\n  still deeply imbued with the light of the day;” and again, “the\r\n  eyes of the cat are during the night so imbued with light that they\r\n  then appear very shining and luminous.”\r\n\r\n  Spallanzani says: “The eyes of cats, polecats, and several other\r\n  animals, shine in the dark like two small tapers;” and he adds that\r\n  this light is phosphoric.\r\n\r\n  Treviranus says: “The eyes of the cat _shine where no rays of\r\n  light penetrate_; and the light must in many, if not in all, cases\r\n  proceed from the eye itself.”\r\n\r\nNow, that the eyes of the cat do shine in the dark is to a certain\r\nextent true: but we have to inquire whether by _dark_ is meant the\r\nentire absence of light; and it will be found that the solution of this\r\nquestion will dispose of several assertions and theories which have for\r\ncenturies perplexed the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Karl Ludwig Esser has published in Karsten’s Archives the results\r\nof an experimental inquiry on the luminous appearance of the eyes of\r\nthe cat and other animals, carefully distinguishing such as evolve\r\nlight from those which only reflect it. Having brought a cat into a\r\nhalf-darkened room, he observed from a certain direction that the cat’s\r\neyes, when _opposite the window_, sparkled brilliantly; but in other\r\npositions the light suddenly vanished. On causing the cat to be held\r\nso as to exhibit the light, and then gradually darkening the room, the\r\nlight disappeared by the time the room was made quite dark.\r\n\r\nIn another experiment, a cat was placed opposite the window in a\r\ndarkened room. A few rays were permitted to enter, and by adjusting the\r\nlight, one or both of the cat’s eyes were made to shine. In proportion\r\nas the pupil was dilated, the eyes were brilliant. By suddenly\r\nadmitting a strong glare of light into the room, the pupil contracted;\r\nand then suddenly darkening the room, the eye exhibited a small round\r\nluminous point, which enlarged as the pupil dilated.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the cat sparkle most when the animal is in a lurking\r\nposition, or in a state of irritation. Indeed, the eyes of all animals,\r\nas well as of man, appear brighter when in rage than in a quiescent\r\nstate, which Collins has commemorated in his Ode on the Passions:\r\n\r\n    “Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire.”\r\n\r\nThis brilliancy is said to arise from an increased secretion of the\r\nlachrymal fluid on the surface of the eye, by which the reflection of\r\nthe light is increased. Dr. Esser, in places absolutely dark, never\r\ndiscovered the slightest trace of light in the eye of the cat; and he\r\nhas no doubt that in all cases where cats’ eyes have been seen to shine\r\nin dark places, such as a cellar, light penetrated through some window\r\nor aperture, and fell upon the eyes of the animal as it turned towards\r\nthe opening, while the observer was favourably situated to obtain a\r\nview of the reflection.\r\n\r\nTo prove more clearly that this light does not depend upon the will of\r\nthe animal, nor upon its angry passions, experiments were made upon\r\nthe head of a dead cat. The sun’s rays were admitted through a small\r\naperture; and falling immediately upon the eyes, caused them to glow\r\nwith a beautiful green light more vivid even than in the case of a\r\nliving animal, on account of the increased dilatation of the pupil.\r\nIt was also remarked that black and fox-coloured cats gave a brighter\r\nlight than gray and white cats.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the cause of this luminous appearance Dr. Esser dissected\r\nthe eyes of cats, and exposed them to a small regulated amount of light\r\nafter having removed different portions. The light was not diminished\r\nby the removal of the cornea, but only changed in colour. The light\r\nstill continued after the iris was displaced; but on taking away the\r\ncrystalline lens it greatly diminished both in intensity and colour.\r\nDr. Esser then conjectured that the tapetum in the hinder part of the\r\neye must form a spot which caused the reflection of the incident\r\nrays of light, and thus produce the shining; and this appeared more\r\nprobable as the light of the eye now seemed to emanate from a single\r\nspot. Having taken away the vitreous humour, Dr. Esser observed that\r\nthe entire want of the pigment in the hinder part of the choroid coat,\r\nwhere the optic nerve enters, formed a greenish, silver-coloured,\r\nchangeable oblong spot, which was not symmetrical, but surrounded the\r\noptic nerve so that the greater part was above and only the smaller\r\npart below it; wherefore the greater part lay beyond the axis of\r\nvision. It is this spot, therefore, that produces the reflection of the\r\nincident rays of light, and beyond all doubt, according to its tint,\r\ncontributes to the different colouring of the light.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to explain that the interior of the eye is coated\r\nwith a black pigment, which has the same effect as the black colour\r\ngiven to the inner surface of optical instruments: it absorbs any\r\nrays of light that may be reflected within the eye, and prevents\r\nthem from being thrown again upon the retina so as to interfere with\r\nthe distinctness of the images formed upon it. The retina is very\r\ntransparent; and if the surface behind it, instead of being of a dark\r\ncolour, were capable of reflecting light, the luminous rays which had\r\nalready acted on the retina would be reflected back again through it,\r\nand not only dazzle from excess of light, but also confuse and render\r\nindistinct the images formed on the retina. Now in the case of the cat\r\nthis black pigment, or a portion of it, is wanting; and those parts of\r\nthe eye from which it is absent, having either a white or a metallic\r\nlustre, are called the tapetum. The smallest portion of light entering\r\nfrom it is reflected as by a concave mirror; and hence it is that the\r\neyes of animals provided with this structure are luminous in a very\r\nfaint light.\r\n\r\nThese experiments and observations show that the shining of the eyes\r\nof the cat does not arise from a phosphoric light, but only from a\r\nreflected light; that consequently it is not an effect of the will of\r\nthe animal, or of violent passions; that their shining does not appear\r\nin absolute darkness; and that it cannot enable the animal to move\r\nsecurely in the dark.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by experiment that there exists a set of rays of\r\nlight of far higher refrangibility than those seen in the ordinary\r\nNewtonian spectrum. Mr. Hunt considers it probable that these highly\r\nrefrangible rays, although under ordinary circumstances invisible\r\nto the human eye, may be adapted to produce the necessary degree\r\nof excitement upon which vision depends in the optic nerves of the\r\nnight-roaming animals. The bat, the owl, and the cat may see in the\r\ngloom of the night by the aid of rays which are invisible to, or\r\ninactive on, the eyes of man or those animals which require the light\r\nof day for perfect vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAstronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT TRUTHS OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of understanding these marvellous truths has been\r\nglanced at by an old divine (see _Things not generally Known_, p.\r\n1); but the rarity of their full comprehension by those unskilled in\r\nmathematical science is more powerfully urged by Lord Brougham in these\r\ncogent terms:\r\n\r\n  Satisfying himself of the laws which regulate the mutual actions\r\n  of the planetary bodies, the mathematician can convince himself of\r\n  a truth yet more sublime than Newton’s discovery of gravitation,\r\n  though flowing from it; and must yield his assent to the marvellous\r\n  position, that all the irregularities occasioned in the system\r\n  of the universe by the mutual attraction of its members are\r\n  periodical, and subject to an eternal law, which prevents them from\r\n  ever exceeding a stated amount, and secures through all time the\r\n  balanced structure of a universe composed of bodies whose mighty\r\n  bulk and prodigious swiftness of motion mock the utmost efforts\r\n  of the human imagination. All these truths are to the skilful\r\n  mathematician as thoroughly known, and their evidence is as clear,\r\n  as the simplest proposition of arithmetic to common understandings.\r\n  But how few are those who thus know and comprehend them! Of all\r\n  the millions that thoroughly believe these truths, certainly not a\r\n  thousand individuals are capable of following even any considerable\r\n  portion of the demonstrations upon which they rest; and probably\r\n  not a hundred now living have ever gone through the whole steps\r\n  of these demonstrations.--_Dissertations on Subjects of Science\r\n  connected with Natural Theology_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster thus impressively illustrates the same subject:\r\n\r\n  Minds fitted and prepared for this species of inquiry are\r\n  capable of appreciating the great variety of evidence by\r\n  which the truths of the planetary system are established; but\r\n  thousands of individuals, and many who are highly distinguished\r\n  in other branches of knowledge, are incapable of understanding\r\n  such researches, and view with a sceptical eye the great and\r\n  irrefragable truths of astronomy.\r\n\r\n  That the sun is stationary in the centre of our system; that\r\n  the earth moves round the sun, and round its own axis; that\r\n  the diameter of the earth is 8000 miles, and that of the sun\r\n  _one hundred and ten times as great_; that the earth’s orbit is\r\n  190,000,000 of miles in breadth; and that if this immense space\r\n  were filled with light, it would appear only like a luminous point\r\n  at the nearest fixed star,--are positions absolutely unintelligible\r\n  and incredible to all who have not carefully studied the subject.\r\n  To millions of our species, then, the great Book of Nature is\r\n  absolutely sealed; though it is in the power of all to unfold its\r\n  pages, and to peruse those glowing passages which proclaim the\r\n  power and wisdom of its Author.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY AND DATES ON MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\nAstronomy is a useful aid in discovering the Dates of ancient\r\nMonuments. Thus, on the ceiling of a portico among the ruins of\r\nTentyris are the twelve signs of the Zodiac, placed according to the\r\napparent motion of the sun. According to this Zodiac, the summer\r\nsolstice is in Leo; from which it is easy to compute, by the precession\r\nof the equinoxes of 50″·1 annually, that the Zodiac of Tentyris must\r\nhave been made 4000 years ago.\r\n\r\nMrs. Somerville relates that she once witnessed the ascertainment of\r\nthe date of a Papyrus by means of astronomy. The manuscript was found\r\nin Egypt, in a mummy-case; and its antiquity was determined by the\r\nconfiguration of the heavens at the time of its construction. It proved\r\nto be a horoscope of the time of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE CRYSTAL VAULT OF HEAVEN.”\r\n\r\nThis poetic designation dates back as far as the early period of\r\nAnaximenes; but the first clearly defined signification of the idea on\r\nwhich the term is based occurs in Empedocles. This philosopher regarded\r\nthe heaven of the fixed stars as a solid mass, formed from the ether\r\nwhich had been rendered crystalline by the action of fire.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the fathers of the Church believed the firmament to\r\nconsist of from seven to ten glassy strata, incasing each other like\r\nthe different coatings of an onion. This supposition still keeps its\r\nground in some of the monasteries of southern Europe, where Humboldt\r\nwas greatly surprised to hear a venerable prelate express an opinion in\r\nreference to the fall of aerolites at Aigle, that the bodies we called\r\nmeteoric stones with vitrified crusts were not portions of the fallen\r\nstone itself, but simply fragments of the crystal vault shattered by it\r\nin its fall.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles maintained that the fixed stars were riveted to the\r\ncrystal heavens; but that the planets were free and unconstrained.\r\nIt is difficult to conceive how, according to Plato in the _Timæus_,\r\nthe fixed stars, riveted as they are to solid spheres, could rotate\r\nindependently.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient views, it may be mentioned that the equal distance\r\nat which the stars remained, while the whole vault of heaven seemed to\r\nmove from east to west, had led to the idea of a firmament and a solid\r\ncrystal sphere, in which Anaximenes (who was probably not much later\r\nthan Pythagoras) had conjectured that the stars were riveted like nails.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC OF THE SPHERES.\r\n\r\nThe Pythagoreans, in applying their theory of numbers to the\r\ngeometrical consideration of the five regular bodies, to the musical\r\nintervals of tone which determine a word and form different kinds\r\nof sounds, extended it even to the system of the universe itself;\r\nsupposing that the moving, and, as it were, vibrating planets, exciting\r\nsound-waves, must produce a _spheral music_, according to the harmonic\r\nrelations of their intervals of space. “This music,” they add, “would\r\nbe perceived by the human ear, if it was not rendered insensible by\r\nextreme familiarity, as it is perpetual, and men are accustomed to it\r\nfrom childhood.”\r\n\r\n  The Pythagoreans affirm, in order to justify the reality of the\r\n  tones produced by the revolution of the spheres, that hearing takes\r\n  place only where there is an alternation of sound and silence. The\r\n  inaudibility of the spheral music is also accounted for by its\r\n  overpowering the senses. Aristotle himself calls the Pythagorean\r\n  tone-myth pleasing and ingenious, but untrue.\r\n\r\nPlato attempted to illustrate the tones of the universe in an\r\nagreeable picture, by attributing to each of the planetary spheres a\r\nsyren, who, supported by the stern daughters of Necessity, the three\r\nFates, maintain the eternal revolution of the world’s axis. Mention\r\nis constantly made of the harmony of the spheres, though generally\r\nreproachfully, throughout the writings of Christian antiquity and the\r\nMiddle Ages, from Basil the Great to Thomas Aquinas and Petrus Alliacus.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixteenth century, Kepler revived these musical\r\nideas, and sought to trace out the analogies between the relations of\r\ntone and the distances of the planets; and Tycho Brahe was of opinion\r\nthat the revolving conical bodies were capable of vibrating the\r\ncelestial air (what we now call “resisting medium”) so as to produce\r\ntones. Yet Kepler, although he had talked of Venus and the Earth\r\nsounding sharp in aphelion and flat in perihelion, and the highest tone\r\nof Jupiter and that of Venus coinciding in flat accord, positively\r\ndeclared there to be “no such things as sounds among the heavenly\r\nbodies, nor is their motion so turbulent as to elicit noise from the\r\nattrition of the celestial air.” (See _Things not generally Known_, p.\r\n44.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“MORE WORLDS THAN ONE.”\r\n\r\nAlthough this opinion was maintained incidentally by various writers\r\nboth on astronomy[16] and natural religion, yet M. Fontenelle was the\r\nfirst individual who wrote a treatise on the _Plurality of Worlds_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1685, the year before the publication of Newton’s\r\n_Principia_. Fontenelle’s work consists of five chapters: 1. The earth\r\nis a planet which turns round its axis, and also round the sun. 2. The\r\nmoon is a habitable world. 3. Particulars concerning the world in the\r\nmoon, and that the other planets are also inhabited. 4. Particulars of\r\nthe worlds of Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. 5. The fixed\r\nstars are as many suns, each of which illuminates a world. In a future\r\nedition, 1719, Fontenelle added, 6. New thoughts which confirm those in\r\nthe preceding conversations, and the latest discoveries which have been\r\nmade in the heavens. The next work on the subject was the _Theory of\r\nthe Universe, or Conjectures concerning the Celestial Bodies and their\r\nInhabitants_, 1698, by Christian Huygens, the contemporary of Newton.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine is maintained by almost all the distinguished astronomers\r\nand writers who have flourished since the true figure of the earth was\r\ndetermined. Giordano Bruna of Nola, Kepler, and Tycho Brahe, believed\r\nin it; and Cardinal Cusa and Bruno, before the discovery of binary\r\nsystems among the stars, believed also that the stars were inhabited.\r\nSir Isaac Newton likewise adopted the belief; and Dr. Bentley, Master\r\nof Trinity College, Cambridge, in his eighth sermon on the Confutation\r\nof Atheism from the origin and frame of the world, has ably maintained\r\nthe same doctrine. In our own day we may number among its supporters\r\nthe distinguished names of the Marquis de la Place, Sir William and\r\nSir John Herschel, Dr. Chalmers, Isaac Taylor, and M. Arago. Dr.\r\nChalmers maintains the doctrine in his _Astronomical Discourses_, which\r\none Alexander Maxwell (who did not believe in the grand truths of\r\nastronomy) attempted to controvert, in 1820, in a chapter of a volume\r\nentitled _Plurality of Worlds_.\r\n\r\nNext appeared _Of a Plurality of Worlds_, attributed to the Rev. Dr.\r\nWhewell, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge; urging the theological\r\nnot less than the scientific reasons for believing in the old tradition\r\nof a single world, and maintaining that “the earth is really the\r\nlargest planetary body in the solar system,--its domestic hearth,\r\nand the only world in the universe.” “I do not pretend,” says Dr.\r\nWhewell, “to disprove the plurality of worlds; but I ask in vain for\r\nany argument which makes the doctrine probable.” “It is too remote\r\nfrom knowledge to be either proved or disproved.” Sir David Brewster\r\nhas replied to Dr. Whewell’s Essay, in _More Worlds than One, the\r\nCreed of the Philosopher and the Hope of the Christian_, emphatically\r\nmaintaining that analogy strongly countenances the idea of all the\r\nsolar planets, if not all worlds in the universe, being peopled with\r\ncreatures not dissimilar in being and nature to the inhabitants\r\nof the earth. This view is supported in _Scientific Certainties of\r\nPlanetary Life_, by T. C. Simon, who well treats one point of the\r\nargument--that mere distance of the planets from the central sun\r\ndoes not determine the condition as to light and heat, but that the\r\ndensity of the ethereal medium enters largely into the calculation. Mr.\r\nSimon’s general conclusion is, that “neither on account of deficient\r\nor excessive heat, nor with regard to the density of the materials,\r\nnor with regard to the force of gravity on the surface, is there the\r\nslightest pretext for supposing that all the planets of our system\r\nare not inhabited by intellectual creatures with animal bodies like\r\nourselves,--moral beings, who know and love their great Maker, and\r\nwho wait, like the rest of His creation, upon His providence and upon\r\nHis care.” One of the leading points of Dr. Whewell’s Essay is, that\r\nwe should not elevate the conjectures of analogy into the rank of\r\nscientific certainties; and that “the force of all the presumptions\r\ndrawn from physical reasoning for the opinion of planets and stars\r\nbeing either inhabited or uninhabited is so small, that the belief of\r\nall thoughtful persons on this subject will be determined by moral,\r\nmetaphysical, and theological considerations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLDS TO COME--ABODES OF THE BLEST.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster, in his eloquent advocacy of the doctrine of “more\r\nworlds than one,” thus argues for their peopling:\r\n\r\n  Man, in his future state of existence, is to consist, as at\r\n  present, of a spiritual nature residing in a corporeal frame. He\r\n  must live, therefore, upon a material planet, subject to all the\r\n  laws of matter, and performing functions for which a material body\r\n  is indispensable. We must consequently find for the race of Adam,\r\n  if not races that may have preceded him, a material home upon which\r\n  they may reside, or by which they may travel, by means unknown to\r\n  us, to other localities in the universe. At the present hour, the\r\n  inhabitants of the earth are nearly _a thousand millions_; and\r\n  by whatever process we may compute the numbers that have existed\r\n  before the present generation, and estimate those that are yet to\r\n  inherit the earth, we shall obtain a population which the habitable\r\n  parts of our globe could not possibly accommodate. If there is not\r\n  room, then, on our earth for the millions of millions of beings who\r\n  have lived and died upon its surface, and who may yet live and die\r\n  during the period fixed for its occupation by man, we can scarcely\r\n  doubt that their future abode must be on some of the primary or\r\n  secondary planets of the solar system, whose inhabitants have\r\n  ceased to exist like those on the earth, or upon planets in our own\r\n  or in other systems which have been in a state of preparation, as\r\n  our earth was, for the advent of intellectual life.\r\n\r\n\r\n“GAUGING THE HEAVENS.”\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel, in 1785, conceived the happy idea of counting\r\nthe number of stars which passed at different heights and in various\r\ndirections over the field of view, of fifteen minutes in diameter,\r\nof his twenty-feet reflecting telescope. The field of view each time\r\nembraced only 1/833000th of the whole heavens; and it would therefore\r\nrequire, according to Struve, eighty-three years to gauge the whole\r\nsphere by a similar process.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nM. F. W. G. Struve gives as the splendid result of the united studies\r\nof MM. Argelander, O. Struve, and Peters, grounded on observations\r\nmade at the three Russian observatories of Dorpat, Abo, and Pulkowa,\r\n“that the velocity of the motion of the solar system in space is such\r\nthat the sun, with all the bodies which depend upon it, advances\r\nannually towards the constellation Hercules[17] 1·623 times the radius\r\nof the earth’s orbit, or 33,550,000 geographical miles. The possible\r\nerror of this last number amounts to 1,733,000 geographical miles, or\r\nto a _seventh_ of the whole value. We may, then, wager 400,000 to 1\r\nthat the sun has a proper progressive motion, and 1 to 1 that it is\r\ncomprised between the limits of thirty-eight and twenty-nine millions\r\nof geographical miles.”\r\n\r\n  That is, taking 95,000,000 of English miles as the mean radius of\r\n  the Earth’s orbit, we have 95 × 1·623 = 154·185 millions of miles;\r\n  and consequently,\r\n\r\n                                          English Miles.\r\n    The velocity of the Solar System      154,185,000 in the year.\r\n           ”         ”                        422,424 in a day.\r\n           ”         ”                         17,601 in an hour.\r\n           ”         ”                            293 in a minute.\r\n           ”         ”                             57 in a second.\r\n\r\n  The Sun and all his planets, primary and secondary, are therefore\r\n  now in rapid motion round an invisible focus. To that now dark and\r\n  mysterious centre, from which no ray, however feeble, shines, we\r\n  may in another age point our telescopes, detecting perchance the\r\n  great luminary which controls our system and bounds its path: into\r\n  that vast orbit man, during the whole cycle of his race, may never\r\n  be allowed to round.--_North-British Review_, No. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nM. Arago has found, by experiments with the polariscope, that the light\r\nof gaseous bodies is natural light when it issues from the burning\r\nsurface; although this circumstance does not prevent its subsequent\r\ncomplete polarisation, if subjected to suitable reflections or\r\nrefractions. Hence we obtain _a most simple method of discovering\r\nthe nature of the sun_ at a distance of forty millions of leagues.\r\nFor if the light emanating from the margin of the sun, and radiating\r\nfrom the solar substance _at an acute angle_, reach us without having\r\nexperienced any sensible reflections or refractions in its passage\r\nto the earth, and if it offer traces of polarisation, the sun must\r\nbe _a solid or a liquid body_. But if, on the contrary, the light\r\nemanating from the sun’s margin give no indications of polarisation,\r\nthe _incandescent_ portion of the sun must be _gaseous_. It is by means\r\nof such a methodical sequence of observations that we may acquire\r\nexact ideas regarding the physical constitution of the sun.--_Note to\r\nHumboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE LUMINOUS DISC OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary structure of the _fully luminous_ Disc of the Sun, as\r\nseen through Sir James South’s great achromatic, in a drawing made by\r\nMr. Gwilt, resembles compressed curd, or white almond-soap, or a mass\r\nof asbestos fibres, lying in a _quaquaversus_ direction, and compressed\r\ninto a solid mass. There can be no illusion in this phenomenon; it\r\nis seen by every person with good vision, and on every part of the\r\nsun’s luminous surface or envelope, which is thus shown to be not a\r\n_flame_, but a soft solid or thick fluid, maintained in an incandescent\r\nstate by subjacent heat, capable of being disturbed by differences of\r\ntemperature, and broken up as we see it when the sun is covered with\r\nspots or openings in the luminous matter.--_North-British Review_, No.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n  Copernicus named the sun the lantern of the world (_lucerna\r\n  mundi_); and Theon of Smyrna called it the heart of the universe.\r\n  The mass of the sun is, according to Encke’s calculation of\r\n  Sabine’s pendulum formula, 359,551 times that of the earth, or\r\n  355,499 times that of the earth and moon together; whence the\r\n  density of the sun is only about ¼ (or more accurately 0·252) that\r\n  of the earth. The volume of the sun is 600 times greater, and its\r\n  mass, according to Galle, 738 times greater, than that of all the\r\n  planets combined. It may assist the mind in conceiving a sensuous\r\n  image of the magnitude of the sun, if we remember that if the solar\r\n  sphere were entirely hollowed out, and the earth placed in its\r\n  centre, there would still be room enough for the moon to describe\r\n  its orbit, even if the radius of the latter were increased 160,000\r\n  geographical miles. A railway-engine, moving at the rate of thirty\r\n  miles an hour, would require 360 years to travel from the earth to\r\n  the sun. The diameter of the sun is rather more than one hundred\r\n  and eleven times the diameter of the earth. Therefore the volume or\r\n  bulk of the sun must be nearly _one million four hundred thousand_\r\n  times that of the earth. Lastly, if all the bodies composing the\r\n  solar system were formed into one globe, it would be only about the\r\n  five-hundredth part of the size of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT SIZE OF THE SUN ON THE HORIZON EXPLAINED.\r\n\r\nThe dilated size (generally) of the Sun or Moon, when seen near the\r\nhorizon, beyond what they appear to have when high up in the sky, has\r\nnothing to do with refraction. It is an illusion of the judgment,\r\narising from the terrestrial objects interposed, or placed in close\r\ncomparison with them. In that situation we view and judge of them\r\nas we do of terrestrial objects--in detail, and with an acquired\r\nattention to parts. Aloft we have no association to guide us, and their\r\ninsulation in the expanse of the sky leads us rather to undervalue\r\nthan to over-rate their apparent magnitudes. Actual measurement with\r\na proper instrument corrects our error, without, however, dispelling\r\nour illusion. By this we learn that the sun, when just on the horizon,\r\nsubtends at our eyes almost exactly the same, and the moon a materially\r\n_less_, angle than when seen at a greater altitude in the sky, owing to\r\nits greater distance from us in the former situation as compared with\r\nthe latter.--_Sir John Herschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATORY MOTION OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is the progressive motion of the centre of gravity of\r\nthe whole solar system in universal space. Its velocity, according\r\nto Bessel, is probably four millions of miles daily, in a _relative_\r\nvelocity to that of 61 Cygni of at least 3,336,000 miles, or more than\r\ndouble the velocity of the revolution of the earth in her orbit round\r\nthe sun. This change of the entire solar system would remain unknown\r\nto us, if the admirable exactness of our astronomical instruments of\r\nmeasurement, and the advancement recently made in the art of observing,\r\ndid not cause our progress towards remote stars to be perceptible,\r\nlike an approximation to the objects of a distant shore in apparent\r\nmotion. The proper motion of the star 61 Cygni, for instance, is so\r\nconsiderable, that it has amounted to a whole degree in the course of\r\n700 years.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN’S LIGHT COMPARED WITH TERRESTRIAL LIGHTS.\r\n\r\nMr. Ponton has by means of a simple monochromatic photometer\r\nascertained that a small surface, illuminated by mean solar light, is\r\n444 times brighter than when it is illuminated by a moderator lamp, and\r\n1560 times brighter than when it is illuminated by a wax-candle (short\r\nsix in the lb.)--the artificial light being in both instances placed at\r\ntwo inches’ distance from the illuminated surface. And three electric\r\nlights, each equal to 520 wax-candles, will render a small surface as\r\nbright as when it is illuminated by mean sunshine.\r\n\r\nIt is thence inferred, that a stratum occupying the entire surface of\r\nthe sphere of which the earth’s distance from the sun is the radius,\r\nand consisting of three layers of flame, each 1/1000th of an inch\r\nin thickness, each possessing a brightness equal to that of such an\r\nelectric light, and all three embraced within a thickness of 1/40th of\r\nan inch, would give an amount of illumination equal in quantity and\r\nintensity to that of the sun at the distance of 95 millions of miles\r\nfrom his centre.\r\n\r\nAnd were such a stratum transferred to the surface of the sun, where it\r\nwould occupy 46,275 times less area, its thickness would be increased\r\nto 94 feet, and it would embrace 138,825 layers of flame, equal in\r\nbrightness to the electric light; but the same effect might be produced\r\nby a stratum about nine miles in thickness, embracing 72 millions of\r\nlayers, each having only a brightness equal to that of a wax-candle.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nACTINIC POWER OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nMr. J. J. Waterston, in 1857, made at Bombay some experiments on the\r\nphotographic power of the sun’s direct light, to obtain data in an\r\ninquiry as to the possibility of measuring the diameter of the sun to\r\na very minute fraction of a second, by combining photography with the\r\nprinciple of the electric telegraph; the first to measure the element\r\nspace, the latter the element time. The result is that about 1/20000th\r\nof a second is sufficient exposure to the direct light of the sun to\r\nobtain a distinct mark on a sensitive collodion plate, when developed\r\nby the usual processes; and the duration of the sun’s full action on\r\nany one point is about 1/9000th of a second.\r\n\r\nM. Schatt, a young painter of Berlin, after 1500 experiments, succeeded\r\nin establishing a scale of all the shades of black which the action of\r\nthe sun produces on photographic paper; so that by comparing the shade\r\nobtained at any given moment on a certain paper with that indicated on\r\nthe scale, the exact force of the sun’s light may be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATING POWER OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nAll moving power has its origin in the rays of the sun. While\r\nStephenson’s iron tubular railway-bridge over the Menai Straits, 400\r\nfeet long, bends but half an inch under the heaviest pressure of a\r\ntrain, it will bend up an inch and a half from its usual horizontal\r\nline when the sun shines on it for some hours. The Bunker-Hill\r\nmonument, near Boston, U.S., is higher in the evening than in the\r\nmorning of a sunny day; the little sunbeams enter the pores of the\r\nstone like so many wedges, lifting it up.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the Earth is nearer the Sun by about 1/30 than in summer;\r\nbut the rays strike the northern hemisphere more obliquely in winter\r\nthan the other half year.\r\n\r\nM. Pouillet has estimated, with singular ingenuity, from a series of\r\nobservations made by himself, that the whole quantity of heat which the\r\nEarth receives annually from the Sun is such as would be sufficient to\r\nmelt a stratum of ice covering the entire globe forty-six feet deep.\r\n\r\nBy the action of the sun’s rays upon the earth, vegetables, animals,\r\nand man, are in their turn supported; the rays become likewise, as\r\nit were, a store of heat, and “the sources of those great deposits\r\nof dynamical efficiency which are laid up for human use in our coal\r\nstrata” (_Herschel_).\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the power of the sun’s rays is recorded at\r\nStonehouse Point, Devon, in the year 1828. To lay the foundation of a\r\nsea-wall the workmen had to descend in a diving-bell, which was fitted\r\nwith convex glasses in the upper part, by which, on several occasions\r\nin clear weather, the sun’s rays were so concentrated as to burn the\r\nlabourers’ clothes when opposed to the focal point, and this when the\r\nbell was twenty-five feet under the surface of the water!\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF DARK COLOUR OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nDarkness of complexion has been attributed to the sun’s power from the\r\nage of Solomon to this day,--“Look not upon me, because I am black,\r\nbecause the sun hath looked upon me:” and there cannot be a doubt\r\nthat, to a certain degree, the opinion is well founded. The invisible\r\nrays in the solar beams, which change vegetable colour, and have been\r\nemployed with such remarkable effect in the daguerreotype, act upon\r\nevery substance on which they fall, producing mysterious and wonderful\r\nchanges in their molecular state, man not excepted.--_Mrs. Somerville._\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTREME SOLAR HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuation in the sun’s direct heating power amounts to 1/15th,\r\nwhich is too considerable a fraction of the whole intensity not\r\nto aggravate in a serious degree the sufferings of those who are\r\nexposed to it in thirsty deserts without shelter. The amount of these\r\nsufferings, in the interior of Australia for instance, are of the\r\nmost frightful kind, and would seem far to exceed what have ever been\r\nundergone by travellers in the northern deserts of Africa. Thus\r\nCaptain Sturt, in his account of his Australian exploration, says:\r\n“The ground was almost a molten surface; and if a match accidentally\r\nfell upon it, it immediately ignited.” Sir John Herschel has observed\r\nthe temperature of the surface soil in South Africa as high as 159°\r\nFahrenheit. An ordinary lucifer-match does not ignite when simply\r\npressed upon a smooth surface at 212°; but _in the act of withdrawing\r\nit_ it takes fire, and the slightest friction upon such a surface of\r\ncourse ignites it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DR. WOLLASTON COMPARED THE LIGHT OF THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS.\r\n\r\nIn order to compare the Light of the Sun with that of a Star, Dr.\r\nWollaston took as an intermediate object of comparison the light of a\r\ncandle reflected from a bulb about a quarter of an inch in diameter,\r\nfilled with quicksilver; and seen by one eye through a lens of two\r\ninches focus, at the same time that the star on the sun’s image,\r\n_placed at a proper distance_, was viewed by the other eye through a\r\ntelescope. The mean of various trials seemed to show that the light\r\nof Sirius is equal to that of the sun seen in a glass bulb 1/10th of\r\nan inch in diameter, at the distance of 210 feet; or that they are in\r\nthe proportion of one to ten thousand millions: but as nearly one half\r\nof this light is lost by reflection, the real proportion between the\r\nlight from Sirius and the sun is not greater than that of one to twenty\r\nthousand millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE SUN DARKENED.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt selects the following example from historical records as to\r\nthe occurrence of a sudden decrease in the light of the Sun:\r\n\r\n  A.D. 33, the year of the Crucifixion. “Now from the sixth hour\r\n  there was darkness over all the land till the ninth hour” (_St.\r\n  Matthew_ xxvii. 45). According to _St. Luke_ (xxiii. 45), “the\r\n  sun was darkened.” In order to explain and corroborate these\r\n  narrations, Eusebius brings forward an eclipse of the sun in the\r\n  202d Olympiad, which had been noticed by the chronicler Phlegon\r\n  of Tralles (_Ideler_, _Handbuch der Mathem. Chronologie_, Bd. ii.\r\n  p. 417). Wurn, however, has shown that the eclipse which occurred\r\n  during this Olympiad, and was visible over the whole of Asia\r\n  Minor, must have happened as early as the 24th of November 29 A.D.\r\n  The day of the Crucifixion corresponded with the Jewish Passover\r\n  (_Ideler_, Bd. i. pp. 515-520), on the 14th of the month Nisan, and\r\n  the Passover was always celebrated at the time of the _full moon_.\r\n  The sun cannot therefore have been darkened for three hours by the\r\n  moon. The Jesuit Scheiner thinks the decrease in the light might be\r\n  ascribed to the occurrence of large sun-spots.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN AND TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nThe important influence exerted by the Sun’s body, as a mass, upon\r\nTerrestrial Magnetism, is confirmed by Sabine in the ingenious\r\nobservation, that the period at which the intensity of the magnetic\r\nforce is greatest, and the direction of the needle most near to the\r\nvertical line, falls in both hemispheres between the months of October\r\nand February; that is to say, precisely at the time when the earth is\r\nnearest to the sun, and moves in its orbit with the greatest velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE HEAT OF THE SUN DECREASING?\r\n\r\nThe Heat of the Sun is dissipated and lost by radiation, and must\r\nbe progressively diminished unless its thermal energy be supplied.\r\nAccording to the measurements of M. Pouillet, the quantity of heat\r\ngiven out by the sun in a year is equal to that which would be produced\r\nby the combustion of a stratum of coal seventeen miles in thickness;\r\nand if the sun’s capacity for heat be assumed equal to that of water,\r\nand the heat be supposed drawn uniformly from its entire mass, its\r\ntemperature would thereby undergo a diminution of 20·4° Fahr. annually.\r\nOn the other hand, there is a vast store of force in our system capable\r\nof conversion into heat. If, as is indicated by the small density of\r\nthe sun, and by other circumstances, that body has not yet reached the\r\ncondition of incompressibility, we have in the future approximation of\r\nits parts a fund of heat, probably quite large enough to supply the\r\nwants of the human family to the end of its sojourn here. It has been\r\ncalculated that an amount of condensation which would diminish the\r\ndiameter of the sun by only the ten-thousandth part, would suffice to\r\nrestore the heat emitted in 2000 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVERSAL SUN-DIAL.\r\n\r\nMr. Sharp, of Dublin, exhibited to the British Association in 1849 a\r\nDial, consisting of a cylinder set to the day of the month, and then\r\nelevated to the latitude. A thin plane of metal, in the direction of\r\nits axis, is then turned by a milled head below it till the shadow is\r\na minimum, when a dial on the top shows the hours by one hand, and the\r\nminutes by another, to the precision of about three minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLENGTH OF DAYS AT THE POLES.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, in the northern hemisphere, places near the North\r\nPole are in _continual sunlight_--the sun never sets to them; while\r\nduring that time places near the South Pole never see the sun. When it\r\nis summer in the southern hemisphere, and the sun shines on the South\r\nPole without setting, the North Pole is entirely deprived of his light.\r\nIndeed, at the Poles there is but _one day and one night_; for the sun\r\nshines for six months together on one Pole, and the other six months on\r\nthe other Pole.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN IS ASCERTAINED BY THE YARD-MEASURE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Airy, in his _Six Lectures on Astronomy_, gives a masterly\r\nanalysis of a problem of considerable intricacy, viz. the determination\r\nof the parallax of the sun, and consequently of his distance, by\r\nobservations of the transit of Venus, the connecting link between\r\nmeasures upon the earth’s surface and the dimensions of our system.\r\nThe further step of investigating the parallax, and consequently the\r\ndistance of the fixed stars (where that is practicable), is also\r\nelucidated; and the author, with evident satisfaction, thus sums up the\r\nseveral steps:\r\n\r\n  By means of a yard-measure, a base-line in a survey was measured;\r\n  from this, by the triangulations and computations of a survey,\r\n  an arc of meridian on the earth was measured; from this, with\r\n  proper observations with the zenith sector, the surveys being also\r\n  repeated on different parts of the earth, the earth’s form and\r\n  dimensions were ascertained; from these, and a previous independent\r\n  knowledge of the proportions of the distances of the earth and\r\n  other planets from the sun, with observations of the transit of\r\n  Venus, the sun’s distance is determined; and from this, with\r\n  observations leading to the parallax of the stars, the distance\r\n  of the stars is determined. And _every step in the process can be\r\n  distinctly referred to its basis, that is, the yard-measure_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE TIDES ARE PRODUCED BY THE SUN AND MOON.\r\n\r\nEach of these bodies excites, by its attraction upon the waters of the\r\nsea, two gigantic waves, which flow in the same direction round the\r\nworld as the attracting bodies themselves apparently do. The two waves\r\nof the moon, on account of her greater nearness, are about 3½ times as\r\nlarge as those excited by the sun. One of these waves has its crest on\r\nthe quarter of the earth’s surface which is turned towards the moon;\r\nthe other is at the opposite side. Both these quarters possess the flow\r\nof the tide, while the regions which lie between have the ebb. Although\r\nin the open sea the height of the tide amounts to only about three\r\nfeet, and only in certain narrow channels, where the moving water is\r\nsqueezed together, rises to thirty feet, the might of the phenomenon\r\nis nevertheless manifest from the calculation of Bessel, according to\r\nwhich a quarter of the earth covered by the sea possesses during the\r\nflow of the tide about 25,000 cubic miles of water more than during the\r\nebb; and that, therefore, such a mass of water must in 6¼ hours flow\r\nfrom one quarter of the earth to the other.--_Professor Helmholtz._\r\n\r\n\r\nSPOTS ON THE SUN.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel describes these phenomena, when watched from day to\r\nday, or even from hour to hour, as appearing to enlarge or contract,\r\nto change their forms, and at length disappear altogether, or to break\r\nout anew in parts of the surface where none were before. Occasionally\r\nthey break up or divide into two or more. The scale on which their\r\nmovements takes place is immense. A single second of angular measure,\r\nas seen from the earth, corresponds on the sun’s disc to 461 miles; and\r\na circle of this diameter (containing therefore nearly 167,000 square\r\nmiles) is the least space which can be distinctly discerned on the sun\r\nas a _visible area_. Spots have been observed, however, whose linear\r\ndiameter has been upwards of 45,000 miles; and even, if some records\r\nare to be trusted, of very much greater extent. That such a spot should\r\nclose up in six weeks time (for they seldom last much longer), its\r\nborders must approach at the rate of more than 1000 miles a-day.\r\n\r\nThe same astronomer saw at the Cape of Good Hope, on the 29th March\r\n1837, a solar spot occupying an area of near _five square minutes_,\r\nequal to 3,780,000,000 square miles. “The black centre of the spot of\r\nMay 25th, 1837 (not the tenth part of the preceding one), would have\r\nallowed the globe of our earth to drop through it, leaving a thousand\r\nmiles clear of contact on all sides of that tremendous gulf.” For such\r\nan amount of disturbance on the sun’s atmosphere, what reason can be\r\nassigned?\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Dawes has invented a peculiar contrivance, by means of\r\nwhich he has been enabled to scrutinise, under high magnifying power,\r\nminute portions of the solar disc. He places a metallic screen, pierced\r\nwith a very small hole, in the focus of the telescope, where the image\r\nof the sun is formed. A small portion only of the image is thus allowed\r\nto pass through, so that it may be examined by the eye-piece without\r\ninconveniencing the observer by heat or glare. By this arrangement,\r\nMr. Dawes has observed peculiarities in the constitution of the sun’s\r\nsurface which are discernible in no other way.\r\n\r\nBefore these observations, the dark spots seen on the sun’s surface\r\nwere supposed to be portions of the solid body of the sun, laid bare to\r\nour view by those immense fluctuations in the luminous regions of its\r\natmosphere to which it appears to be subject. It now appears that these\r\ndark portions are only an additional and inferior stratum of a very\r\nfeebly luminous or illuminated portion of the sun’s atmosphere. This\r\nagain in its turn Mr. Dawes has frequently seen pierced with a smaller\r\nand usually much more rounded aperture, which would seem at last to\r\nafford a view of the real solar surface of most intense blackness.\r\n\r\nM. Schwabe, of Dessau, has discovered that the abundance or paucity\r\nof spots displayed by the sun’s surface is subject to a law of\r\nperiodicity. This has been confirmed by M. Wolf, of Berne, who shows\r\nthat the period of these changes, from minimum to minimum, is 11 years\r\nand 11-hundredths of a year, being exactly at the rate of nine periods\r\nper century, the last year of each century being a year of minimum. It\r\nis strongly corroborative of the correctness both of M. Wolf’s period\r\nand also of the periodicity itself, that of all the instances of the\r\nappearance of spots on the sun recorded in history, even before the\r\ninvention of the telescope, or of remarkable deficiencies in the sun’s\r\nlight, of which there are great numbers, only two are found to deviate\r\nas much as two years from M. Wolf’s epochs. Sir William Herschel\r\nobserved that the presence or absence of spots had an influence on the\r\ntemperature of the seasons; his observations have been fully confirmed\r\nby M. Wolf. And, from an examination of the chronicles of Zurich from\r\nA.D. 1000 to A.D. 1800, he has come to the conclusion “that years rich\r\nin solar spots are in general drier and more fruitful than those of an\r\nopposite character; while the latter are wetter and more stormy than\r\nthe former.”\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary fact, however, in connection with the spots on\r\nthe sun’s surface, is the singular coincidence of their periods with\r\nthose great disturbances in the magnetic system of the earth to which\r\nthe epithet of “magnetic storms” has been affixed.\r\n\r\n  These disturbances, during which the magnetic needle is greatly\r\n  and universally agitated (not in a particular limited locality,\r\n  but at one and the same instant of time over whole continents, or\r\n  even over the whole earth), are found, so far as observation has\r\n  hitherto extended, to maintain a parallel, both in respect of their\r\n  frequency of occurrence and intensity in successive years, with the\r\n  abundance and magnitude of the spots in the same years, too close\r\n  to be regarded as fortuitous. The coincidence of the epochs of\r\n  maxima and minima in the two series of phenomena amounts, indeed,\r\n  to identity; a fact evidently of most important significance, but\r\n  which neither astronomical nor magnetic science is yet sufficiently\r\n  advanced to interpret.--_Herschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\nThe signification and connection of the above varying phenomena\r\n(Humboldt maintains) can never be manifested in their entire importance\r\nuntil an uninterrupted series of representations of the sun’s spots\r\ncan be obtained by the aid of mechanical clock-work and photographic\r\napparatus, as the result of prolonged observations during the many\r\nmonths of serene weather enjoyed in a tropical climate.\r\n\r\n  M. Schwabe has thus distinguished himself as an indefatigable\r\n  observer of the sun’s spots, for his researches received the Royal\r\n  Astronomical Society’s Medal in 1857. “For thirty years,” said\r\n  the President at the presentation, “never has the sun exhibited\r\n  his disc above the horizon of Dessau without being confronted\r\n  by Schwabe’s imperturbable telescope; and that appears to have\r\n  happened on an average about 300 days a-year. So, supposing that\r\n  he had observed but once a-day, he has made 9000 observations,\r\n  in the course of which he discovered about 4700 groups. This is,\r\n  I believe, an instance of devoted persistence unsurpassed in\r\n  the annals of astronomy. The energy of one man has revealed a\r\n  phenomenon that had eluded the suspicion of astronomers for 200\r\n  years.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHAS THE MOON AN ATMOSPHERE?\r\n\r\nThe Moon possesses neither Sea nor Atmosphere of appreciable\r\nextent. Still, as a negative, in such case, is relative only to\r\nthe capabilities of the instruments employed, the search for the\r\nindications of a lunar atmosphere has been renewed with fresh\r\naugmentation of telescopic power. Of such indications, the most\r\ndelicate, perhaps, are those afforded by the occultation of a planet\r\nby the moon. The occultation of Jupiter, which took place on January\r\n2, 1857, was observed with this reference, and is said to have\r\nexhibited no _hesitation_, or change of form or brightness, such as\r\nwould be produced by the refraction or absorption of an atmosphere. As\r\nrespects the sea, if water existed on the moon’s surface, the sun’s\r\nlight reflected from it should be completely polarised at a certain\r\nelongation of the moon from the sun; and no traces of such light have\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\nMM. Baer and Maedler conclude that the moon is not entirely without\r\nan atmosphere, but, owing to the smallness of her mass, she is\r\nincapacitated from holding an extensive covering of gas; and they add,\r\n“it is possible that this weak envelope may sometimes, through local\r\ncauses, in some measure dim or condense itself.” But if any atmosphere\r\nexists on our satellite, it must be, as Laplace says, more attenuated\r\nthan what is termed a vacuum in an air-pump.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins thinks that if there be any lunar atmosphere, it must\r\nbe very rare in comparison with the terrestrial atmosphere, and\r\ninappreciable to the kind of observation by which it has been tested;\r\nyet the absence of any refraction of the light of the stars during\r\noccultation is a very refined test. Mr. Nasmyth observes that “the\r\nsudden disappearance of the stars behind the moon, without any change\r\nor diminution of her brilliancy, is one of the most beautiful phenomena\r\nthat can be witnessed.”\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel observes: The fact of the moon turning always the\r\nsame face towards the earth is, in all probability, the result of an\r\nelongation of its figure in the direction of a line joining the centres\r\nof both the bodies, acting conjointly with a non-coincidence of its\r\ncentre of gravity with its centre of symmetry.\r\n\r\nIf to this we add the supposition that the substance of the moon is\r\nnot homogeneous, and that some considerable preponderance of weight\r\nis placed excentrically in it, it will be easily apprehended that the\r\nportion of its surface nearer to that heavier portion of its solid\r\ncontent, under all the circumstances of the moon’s rotation, will\r\npermanently occupy the situation most remote from the earth.\r\n\r\n  In what regards its assumption of a definite level, air obeys\r\n  precisely the same hydrostatical laws as water. The lunar\r\n  atmosphere would rest upon the lunar ocean, and form in its basin a\r\n  lake of air, whose upper portions at an altitude such as we are now\r\n  contemplating would be of excessive tenuity, especially should the\r\n  provision of air be less abundant in proportion than our own. It by\r\n  no means follows, then, from the absence of visible indications of\r\n  water or air on this side of the moon, that the other is equally\r\n  destitute of them, and equally unfitted for maintaining animal or\r\n  vegetable life. Some slight approach to such a state of things\r\n  actually obtains on the earth itself. Nearly all the land is\r\n  collected in one of its hemispheres, and much the larger portion\r\n  of the sea in the opposite. There is evidently an excess of heavy\r\n  material vertically beneath the middle of the Pacific; while not\r\n  very remote from the point of the globe diametrically opposite\r\n  rises the great table-land of India and the Himalaya chain, on the\r\n  summits of which the air has not more than a third of the density\r\n  it has on the sea-level, and from which animated existence is for\r\n  ever excluded.--_Herschel’s Outlines_, 5th edit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nThe actual illumination of the lunar surface is not much superior to\r\nthat of weathered sandstone-rock in full sunshine. Sir John Herschel\r\nhas frequently compared the moon setting behind the gray perpendicular\r\nfaçade of the Table Mountain at the Cape of Good Hope, illuminated\r\nby the sun just risen from the opposite quarter of the horizon, when\r\nit has been scarcely distinguishable in brightness from the rock in\r\ncontact with it. The sun and moon being nearly at equal altitudes, and\r\nthe atmosphere perfectly free from cloud or vapour, its effect is alike\r\non both luminaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT OF MOONLIGHT.\r\n\r\nM. Zantedeschi has proved, by a long series of experiments in the\r\nBotanic Gardens at Venice, Florence, and Padua, that, contrary to the\r\ngeneral opinion, the diffused rays of moonlight have an influence\r\nupon the organs of plants, as the Sensitive Plant and the _Desmodium\r\ngyrans_. The influence was feeble compared with that of the sun; but\r\nthe action is left beyond further question.\r\n\r\nMelloni has proved that the rays of the Moon give out a slight degree\r\nof Heat (see _Things not generally Known_, p. 7); and Professor Piazzi\r\nSmyth, from a point of the Peak of Teneriffe 8840 feet above the\r\nsea-level, has found distinctly perceptible the heat radiated from the\r\nmoon, which has been so often sought for in vain in a lower region.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENERY OF THE MOON.\r\n\r\nBy means of the telescope, mountain-peaks are distinguished in the\r\nash-gray light of the larger spots and isolated brightly-shining points\r\nof the moon, even when the disc is already more than half illuminated.\r\nLambert and Schroter have shown that the extremely variable intensity\r\nof the ash-gray light of the moon depends upon the greater or less\r\ndegree of reflection of the sunlight which falls upon the earth,\r\naccording as it is reflected from continuous continental masses, full\r\nof sandy deserts, grassy steppes, tropical forests, and barren rocky\r\nground, or from large ocean surfaces. Lambert made the remarkable\r\nobservation (14th of February 1774) of a change of the ash-coloured\r\nmoonlight into an olive-green colour bordering upon yellow. “The moon,\r\nwhich then stood vertically over the Atlantic Ocean, received upon its\r\nright side the green terrestrial light which is reflected towards her\r\nwhen the sky is clear by the forest districts of South America.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch says distinctly, in his remarkable work _On the Face in the\r\nMoon_, that we may suppose the _spots_ to be partly deep chasms and\r\nvalleys, partly mountain-peaks, which cast long shadows, like Mount\r\nAthos, whose shadow reaches Lemnos. The spots cover about two-fifths\r\nof the whole disc. In a clear atmosphere, and under favourable\r\ncircumstances in the position of the moon, some of the spots are\r\nvisible to the naked eye; as the edge of the Apennines, the dark\r\nelevated plain Grimaldus, the enclosed _Mare Crisium_, and Tycho,\r\ncrowded round with numerous mountain ridges and craters.\r\n\r\nProfessor Alexander remarks, that a map of the eastern hemisphere,\r\ntaken with the Bay of Bengal in the centre, would bear a striking\r\nresemblance to the face of the moon presented to us. The dark portions\r\nof the moon he considers to be continental elevations, as shown by\r\nmeasuring the average height of mountains above the dark and the light\r\nportions of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the moon can be as distinctly seen by a good telescope\r\nmagnifying 1000 times, as it would be if not more than 250 miles\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\nA circle of one second in diameter, as seen from the earth, on the\r\nsurface of the moon contains about a square mile. Telescopes,\r\ntherefore, must be greatly improved before we could expect to see signs\r\nof inhabitants, as manifested by edifices or changes on the surface\r\nof the soil. It should, however, be observed, that owing to the small\r\ndensity of the materials of the moon, and the comparatively feeble\r\ngravitation of bodies on her surface, muscular force would there go six\r\ntimes as far in overcoming the weight of materials as on the earth.\r\nOwing to the want of air, however, it seems impossible that any form\r\nof life analogous to those on earth can subsist there. No appearance\r\nindicating vegetation, or the slightest variation of surface which can\r\nin our opinion fairly be ascribed to change of season, can any where be\r\ndiscerned.--_Sir John Herschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON SEEN THROUGH LORD ROSSE’S TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the Rev. Dr. Scoresby had the gratification of observing\r\nthe Moon through the stupendous telescope constructed by Lord Rosse\r\nat Parsonstown. It appeared like a globe of molten silver, and every\r\nobject to the extent of 100 yards was quite visible. Edifices,\r\ntherefore, of the size of York Minster, or even of the ruins of Whitby\r\nAbbey, might be easily perceived, if they had existed. But there was\r\nno appearance of any thing of that nature; neither was there any\r\nindication of the existence of water, or of an atmosphere. There\r\nwere a great number of extinct volcanoes, several miles in breadth;\r\nthrough one of them there was a line of continuance about 150 miles in\r\nlength, which ran in a straight direction, like a railway. The general\r\nappearance, however, was like one vast ruin of nature; and many of the\r\npieces of rock driven out of the volcanoes appeared to lie at various\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNTAINS IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of telescopes, we discern irregularities in the surface of\r\nthe moon which can be no other than mountains and valleys,--for this\r\nplain reason, that we see the shadows cast by the former in the exact\r\nproportion as to length which they ought to have when we take into\r\naccount the inclinations of the sun’s rays to that part of the moon’s\r\nsurface on which they stand. From micrometrical measurements of the\r\nlengths of the shadows of the more conspicuous mountains, Messrs. Baer\r\nand Maedler have given a list of heights for no less than 1095 lunar\r\nmountains, among which occur all degrees of elevation up to 22,823\r\nBritish feet, or about 1400 feet higher than Chimborazo in the Andes.\r\n\r\nIf Chimborazo were as high in proportion to the earth’s diameter as\r\na mountain in the moon known by the name of Newton is to the moon’s\r\ndiameter, its peak would be more than sixteen miles high.\r\n\r\nArago calls to mind, that with a 6000-fold magnifying power, which\r\nnevertheless could not be applied to the moon with proportionate\r\nresults, the mountains upon the moon would appear to us just as Mont\r\nBlanc does to the naked eye when seen from the Lake of Geneva.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes observe more than half the surface of the moon, the\r\neastern and northern edges being more visible at one time, and the\r\nwestern or southern at another. By means of this libration we are\r\nenabled to see the annular mountain Malapert (which occasionally\r\nconceals the moon’s south pole), the arctic landscape round the crater\r\nof Gioja, and the large gray plane near Endymion, which conceals in\r\nsuperficial extent the _mare vaporum_.\r\n\r\nThree-sevenths of the moon are entirely concealed from our observation;\r\nand must always remain so, unless some new and unexpected disturbing\r\ncauses come into play.--_Humboldt._\r\n\r\n  The first object to which Galileo directed his telescope was the\r\n  mountainous parts of the moon, when he showed how their summits\r\n  might be measured: he found in the moon some circular districts\r\n  surrounded on all sides by mountains similar to the form of\r\n  Bohemia. The measurements of the mountains were made by the method\r\n  of the tangents of the solar ray. Galileo, as Helvetius did still\r\n  later, measured the distance of the summit of the mountains from\r\n  the boundary of the illuminated portion at the moment when the\r\n  mountain summit was first struck by the solar ray. Humboldt found\r\n  no observations of the lengths of the shadows of the mountains:\r\n  the summits were “much higher than the mountains on our earth.”\r\n  The comparison is remarkable, since, according to Riccioli,\r\n  very exaggerated ideas of the height of our mountains were then\r\n  entertained. Galileo like all other observers up to the close of\r\n  the eighteenth century, believed in the existence of many seas and\r\n  of a lunar atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON AND THE WEATHER.\r\n\r\nThe only influence of the Moon on the Weather of which we have any\r\ndecisive evidence is the tendency to disappearance of clouds under the\r\nfull moon, which Sir John Herschel refers to its heat being much more\r\nreadily absorbed in traversing transparent media than direct solar\r\nheat, and being extinguished in the upper regions of our atmosphere,\r\nnever reaches the surface of the atmosphere at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON’S ATTRACTION.\r\n\r\nMr. G. P. Bond of Cambridge, by some investigations to ascertain\r\nwhether the Attraction of the Moon has any effect upon the motion of\r\na pendulum, and consequently upon the rate of a clock, has found the\r\nlast to be changed to the amount of 9/1000 of a second daily. At\r\nthe equator the moon’s attraction changes the weight of a body only\r\n1/7000000 of the whole; yet this force is sufficient to produce the\r\nvast phenomena of the tides!\r\n\r\nIt is no slight evidence of the importance of analysis, that Laplace’s\r\nperfect theory of tides has enabled us in our astronomical ephemerides\r\nto predict the height of spring-tides at the periods of new and full\r\nmoon, and thus put the inhabitants of the sea on their guard against\r\nthe increased danger attending the lunar revolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING THE EARTH BY THE MOON.\r\n\r\nAs the form of the Earth exerts a powerful influence on the motion\r\nof other cosmical bodies, and especially on that of its neighbouring\r\nsatellite, a more perfect knowledge of the motion of the latter will\r\nenable us reciprocally to draw an inference regarding the figure of\r\nthe earth. Thus, as Laplace ably remarks: “an astronomer, without\r\nleaving his observatory, may, by a comparison of lunar theory with true\r\nobservations, not only be enabled to determine the form and size of\r\nthe earth, but also its distance from the sun and moon; results that\r\notherwise could only be arrived at by long and arduous expeditions\r\nto the most remote parts of both hemispheres.” The compression which\r\nmay be inferred from lunar inequalities affords an advantage not\r\nyielded by individual measurements of degrees or experiments with the\r\npendulum, since it gives a mean amount which is referable to the whole\r\nplanet.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the moon from the earth is about 240,000 miles; and\r\nif a railway-carriage were to travel at the rate of 1000 miles a-day,\r\nit would be eight months in reaching the moon. But that is nothing\r\ncompared with the length of time it would occupy a locomotive to reach\r\nthe sun from the earth: if travelling at the rate of 1000 miles a-day,\r\nit would require 260 years to reach it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF ECLIPSES.\r\n\r\nAs the Moon is at a very moderate distance from us (astronomically\r\nspeaking), and is in fact our nearest neighbour, while the sun and\r\nstars are in comparison immensely beyond it, it must of necessity\r\nhappen that at one time or other it must _pass over_, and _occult_ or\r\n_eclipse_, every star or planet within its zone, and, as seen from\r\nthe _surface_ of the earth, even somewhat beyond it. Nor is the sun\r\nitself exempt from being thus hidden whenever any part of the moon’s\r\ndisc, in this her tortuous course, comes to _overlap_ any part of the\r\nspace occupied in the heavens by that luminary. On these occasions\r\nis exhibited the most striking and impressive of all the occasional\r\nphenomena of astronomy, an _Eclipse of the Sun_, in which a greater or\r\nless portion, or even in some conjunctures the whole of its disc, is\r\nobscured, and, as it were, obliterated, by the superposition of that\r\nof the moon, which appears upon it as a circularly-terminated black\r\nspot, producing a temporary diminution of daylight, or even nocturnal\r\ndarkness, so that the stars appear as if at midnight.--_Sir John\r\nHerschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\n\r\nVAST NUMBERS IN THE UNIVERSE.\r\n\r\nThe number of telescopic stars in the Milky Way uninterrupted by\r\nany nebulæ is estimated at 18,000,000. To compare this number with\r\nsomething analogous, Humboldt calls attention to the fact, that there\r\nare not in the whole heavens more than about 8000 stars, between\r\nthe first and the sixth magnitudes, visible to the naked eye. The\r\nbarren astonishment excited by numbers and dimensions in space when\r\nnot considered with reference to applications engaging the mental\r\nand perceptive powers of man, is awakened in both extremes of the\r\nuniverse--in the celestial bodies as in the minutest animalcules. A\r\ncubic inch of the polishing slate of Bilin contains, according to\r\nEhrenberg, 40,000 millions of the siliceous shells of Galionellæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR WHAT PURPOSE WERE THE STARS CREATED?\r\n\r\nSurely not (says Sir John Herschel) to illuminate _our_ nights, which\r\nan additional moon of the thousandth part of the size of our own\r\nwould do much better; nor to sparkle as a pageant void of meaning and\r\nreality, and bewilder us among vain conjectures. Useful, it is true,\r\nthey are to man as points of exact and permanent reference; but he must\r\nhave studied astronomy to little purpose, who can suppose man to be the\r\nonly object of his Creator’s care, or who does not see in the vast and\r\nwonderful apparatus around us provision for other races of animated\r\nbeings. The planets derive their light from the sun; but that cannot be\r\nthe case with the stars. These doubtless, then, are themselves suns;\r\nand may perhaps, each in its sphere, be the presiding centre round\r\nwhich other planets, or bodies of which we can form no conception from\r\nany analogy offered by our own system, are circulating.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF STARS.\r\n\r\nVarious estimates have been hazarded on the Number of Stars throughout\r\nthe whole heavens visible to us by the aid of our colossal telescopes.\r\nStruve assumes for Herschel’s 20-feet reflector, that a magnifying\r\npower of 180 would give 5,800,000 for the number of stars lying within\r\nthe zones extending 30° on either side of the equator, and 20,374,000\r\nfor the whole heavens. Sir William Herschel conjectured that 18,000,000\r\nof stars in the Milky Way might be seen by his still more powerful\r\n40-feet reflecting telescope.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that the extent of the starry firmament is literally\r\ninfinite has been made by Dr. Olbers the basis of a conclusion that the\r\ncelestial spaces are in some slight degree deficient in _transparency_;\r\nso that all beyond a certain distance is and must remain for ever\r\nunseen, the geometrical progression of the extinction of light far\r\noutrunning the effect of any conceivable increase in the power of\r\nour telescopes. Were it not so, it is argued that every part of the\r\ncelestial concave ought to shine with the brightness of the solar disc,\r\nsince no visual ray could be so directed as not, in some point or other\r\nof its infinite length, to encounter such a disc.--_Edinburgh Review_,\r\nJan. 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great accuracy of the catalogued positions of\r\ntelescopic fixed stars and of modern star-maps, the certainty of\r\nconviction that a star in the heavens has actually disappeared since\r\na certain epoch can only be arrived at with great caution. Errors of\r\nactual observation, of reduction, and of the press, often disfigure the\r\nvery best catalogues. The disappearance of a heavenly body from the\r\nplace in which it had been before distinctly seen, may be the result\r\nof its own motion as much as of any such diminution of its photometric\r\nprocess as would render the waves of light too weak to excite our\r\norgans of sight. What we no longer see, is not necessarily annihilated.\r\nThe idea of destruction or combustion, as applied to disappearing\r\nstars, belongs to the age of Tycho Brahe. Even Pliny makes it a\r\nquestion. The apparent eternal cosmical alternation of existence and\r\ndestruction is not annihilation; it is merely the transition of matter\r\ninto new forms, into combinations which are subject to new processes.\r\nDark cosmical bodies may by a renewed process of light again become\r\nluminous.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLE-STAR FOUR THOUSAND YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, in his _Outlines of Astronomy_, thus shows the\r\nchanges in the celestial pole in 4000 years:\r\n\r\n  At the date of the erection of the Pyramid of Gizeh, which precedes\r\n  the present epoch by nearly 4000 years, the longitudes of all the\r\n  stars were less by 55° 45′ than at present. Calculating from\r\n  this datum the place of the pole of the heavens among the stars,\r\n  it will be found to fall near α Draconis; its distance from that\r\n  star being 3° 44′ 25″. This being the most conspicuous star in\r\n  the immediate neighbourhood, was therefore the Pole Star of that\r\n  epoch. The latitude of Gizeh being just 30° north, and consequently\r\n  the altitude of the North Pole there also 30°, it follows that\r\n  the star in question must have had at its lowest culmination at\r\n  Gizeh an altitude of 25° 15′ 35″. Now it is a remarkable fact,\r\n  that of the nine pyramids still existing at Gizeh, six (including\r\n  all the largest) have the narrow passages by which alone they can\r\n  be entered (all which open out on the northern faces of their\r\n  respective pyramids) inclined to the horizon downwards at angles\r\n  the mean of which is 26° 47′. At the bottom of every one of these\r\n  passages, therefore, the Pole Star must have been visible at its\r\n  lower culmination; a circumstance which can hardly be supposed\r\n  to have been unintentional, and was doubtless connected (perhaps\r\n  superstitiously) with the astronomical observations of that star,\r\n  of whose proximity to the pole at the epoch of the erection of\r\n  these wonderful structures we are thus furnished with a monumental\r\n  record of the most imperishable nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEIADES.\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades prove that, several thousand years ago even as now,\r\nstars of the seventh magnitude were invisible to the naked eye of\r\naverage visual power. The group consists of seven stars, of which six\r\nonly, of the third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, could be readily\r\ndistinguished. Of these Ovid says (_Fast._ iv. 170):\r\n\r\n    “Quæ septem dici, sex tamen esse solent.”\r\n\r\nAratus states there were only six stars visible in the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nOne of the daughters of Atlas, Merope, the only one who was wedded to\r\na mortal, was said to have veiled herself for very shame and to have\r\ndisappeared. This is probably the star of the seventh magnitude, which\r\nwe call Celæne; for Hipparchus, in his commentary on Aratus, observes\r\nthat on clear moonless nights _seven stars_ may actually be seen.\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades were doubtless known to the rudest nations from the\r\nearliest times; they are also called the _mariner’s stars_. The name is\r\nfrom πλεῖν (_plein_), ‘to sail.’ The navigation of the Mediterranean\r\nlasted from May to the beginning of November, from the early rising\r\nto the early setting of the Pleiades. In how many beautiful effusions\r\nof poetry and sentiment has “the Lost Pleiad” been deplored!--and, to\r\ndescend to more familiar illustration of this group, the “Seven Stars,”\r\nthe sailors’ favourites, and a frequent river-side public-house sign,\r\nmay be traced to the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF COLOUR IN THE STARS.\r\n\r\nThe scintillation or twinkling of the stars is accompanied by\r\nvariations of colour, which have been remarked from a very early age.\r\nM. Arago states, upon the authority of M. Babinet, that the name of\r\nBarakesch, given by the Arabians to Sirius, signifies _the star of\r\na thousand colours_; and Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and others, attest to\r\nsimilar change of colour in twinkling. Even soon after the invention\r\nof the telescope, Simon Marius remarked that by removing the eye-piece\r\nof the telescope the images of the stars exhibited rapid fluctuations\r\nof brightness and colour. In 1814 Nicholson applied to the telescope a\r\nsmart vibration, which caused the image of the star to be transformed\r\ninto a curved line of light returning into itself, and diversified by\r\nseveral colours; each colour occupied about a third of the whole length\r\nof the curve, and by applying ten vibrations in a second, the light of\r\nSirius in that time passed through thirty changes of colour. Hence the\r\nstars in general shine only by a portion of their light, the effect of\r\ntwinkling being to diminish their brightness. This phenomenon M. Arago\r\nexplains by the principle of the interference of light.\r\n\r\nPtolemy is said to have noted Sirius as a _red_ star, though it is now\r\nwhite. Sirius twinkles with red and blue light, and Ptolemy’s eyes,\r\nlike those of several other persons, may have been more sensitive to\r\nthe _red_ than to the _blue_ rays.--_Sir David Brewster’s More Worlds\r\nthan One_, p. 235.\r\n\r\nSome of the double stars are of very different and dissimilar colours;\r\nand to the revolving planetary bodies which apparently circulate around\r\nthem, a day lightened by a red light is succeeded by, not a night, but\r\na day equally brilliant, though illuminated only by a green light.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCE OF THE NEAREST FIXED STAR FROM THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel wrote in 1833: “What is the distance of the nearest\r\nfixed star? What is the scale on which our visible firmament is\r\nconstructed? And what proportion do its dimensions bear to those of our\r\nown immediate system? To this, however, astronomy has hitherto proved\r\nunable to supply an answer. All we know on this subject is negative.”\r\nTo these questions, however, an answer can now be given. Slight\r\nchanges of position of some of the stars, called parallax, have been\r\ndistinctly observed and measured; and among these stars No. 61 Cygni of\r\nFlamstead’s catalogue has a parallax of 5″, and that of α Centauri has\r\na proper motion of 4″ per annum.\r\n\r\nThe same astronomer states that each second of parallax indicates a\r\ndistance of 20 billions of miles, or 3¼ years’ journey of light. Now\r\nthe light sent to us by the sun, as compared with that sent by Sirius\r\nand α Centauri, is about 22 thousand millions to 1. “Hence, from the\r\nparallax assigned above to that star, it is easy to conclude that\r\nits intrinsic splendour, as compared with that of our sun at equal\r\ndistances, is 2·3247, that of the sun being unity. The light of Sirius\r\nis four times that of α Centauri, and its parallax only 0·15″. This,\r\nin effect, ascribes to it an intrinsic splendour equal to 96·63 times\r\nthat of α Centauri, and therefore 224·7 times that of our sun.”\r\n\r\nThis is justly regarded as one of the most brilliant triumphs of\r\nastronomical science, for the delicacy of the investigation is\r\nalmost inconceivable; yet the reasoning is as unimpeachable as the\r\ndemonstration of a theorem of Euclid.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT OF A STAR SIXTEENFOLD THAT OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nThe bright star in the constellation of the Lyre, termed Vega, is the\r\nbrightest in the northern hemisphere; and the combined researches of\r\nStruve, father and son, have found that the distance of this star from\r\nthe earth is no less than 130 billions of miles! Light travelling\r\nat the rate of 192 thousand miles in a second consequently occupies\r\ntwenty-one years in passing from this star to the earth. Now it has\r\nbeen found, by comparing the light of Vega with the light of the\r\nsun, that if the latter were removed to the distance of 130 billions\r\nof miles, his apparent brightness would not amount to more than the\r\nsixteenth part of the apparent brightness of Vega. We are therefore\r\nwarranted in concluding that the light of Vega is equal to that of\r\nsixteen suns.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVERSITIES OF THE PLANETS.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the great diversity of the physical peculiarities\r\nand probable condition of the planets, Sir John Herschel describes\r\nthe intensity of solar radiation as nearly seven times greater on\r\nMercury than on the earth, and on Uranus 330 times less; the proportion\r\nbetween the two extremes being that of upwards of 2000 to 1. Let any\r\none figure to himself, (adds Sir John,) the condition of our globe\r\nwere the sun to be septupled, to say nothing of the greater ratio; or\r\nwere it diminished to a seventh, or to a 300th of its actual power!\r\nAgain, the intensity of gravity, or its efficacy in counteracting\r\nmuscular power and repressing animal activity, on Jupiter is nearly\r\ntwo-and-a-half times that on the earth; on Mars not more than one-half;\r\non the moon one-sixth; and on the smaller planets probably not more\r\nthan one-twentieth; giving a scale of which the extremes are in the\r\nproportion of sixty to one. Lastly, the density of Saturn hardly\r\nexceeds one-eighth of the mean density of the earth, so that it must\r\nconsist of materials not much heavier than cork.\r\n\r\n  Jupiter is eleven times, Saturn ten times, Uranus five times, and\r\n  Neptune nearly six times, the diameter of our earth.\r\n\r\n  These four bodies revolve in space at such distances from the sun,\r\n  that if it were possible to start thence for each in succession,\r\n  and to travel at the railway speed of 33 miles per hour, the\r\n  traveller would reach\r\n\r\n    Jupiter in  1712 years\r\n    Saturn      3113   ”\r\n    Uranus      6226   ”\r\n    Neptune     9685   ”\r\n\r\n  If, therefore, a person had commenced his journey at the period of\r\n  the Christian era, he would now have to travel nearly 1300 years\r\n  before he would arrive at the planet Saturn; more than 4300 years\r\n  before he would reach Uranus; and no less than 7800 years before he\r\n  could reach the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\n  Yet the light which comes to us from these remote confines of the\r\n  solar system first issued from the sun, and is then reflected\r\n  from the surface of the planet. When the telescope is turned\r\n  towards Neptune, the observer’s eye sees the object by means of\r\n  light that issued from the sun eight hours before, and which\r\n  since then has passed nearly twice through that vast space which\r\n  railway speed would require almost a century of centuries to\r\n  accomplish.--_Bouvier’s Familiar Astronomy._\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND RESULTS OF THE DISCOVERY OF JUPITER’S SATELLITES.\r\n\r\nThis discovery, one of the first fruits of the invention of the\r\ntelescope, and of Galileo’s early and happy idea of directing its\r\nnewly-found powers to the examination of the heavens, forms one of\r\nthe most memorable epochs in the history of astronomy. The first\r\nastronomical solution of the great problem of _the longitude_,\r\npractically the most important for the interests of mankind which has\r\never been brought under the dominion of strict scientific principles,\r\ndates immediately from this discovery. The final and conclusive\r\nestablishment of the Copernican system of astronomy may also be\r\nconsidered as referable to the discovery and study of this exquisite\r\nminiature system, in which the laws of the planetary motions, as\r\nascertained by Kepler, and specially that which connects their periods\r\nand distances, were specially traced, and found to be satisfactorily\r\nmaintained. And (as if to accumulate historical interest on this point)\r\nit is to the observation of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites\r\nthat we owe the grand discovery of the aberration of light, and the\r\nconsequent determination of the enormous velocity of that wonderful\r\nelement--192,000 miles per second. Mr. Dawes, in 1849, first noticed\r\nthe existence of round, well-defined, bright spots on the belts of\r\nJupiter. They vary in situation and number, as many as ten having been\r\nseen on one occasion. As the belts of Jupiter have been ascribed to the\r\nexistence of currents analogous to our trade-winds, causing the body of\r\nJupiter to be visible through his cloudy atmosphere, Sir John Herschel\r\nconjectures that those bright spots may possibly be insulated masses\r\nof clouds of local origin, similar to the cumuli which sometimes cap\r\nascending columns of vapour in our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt would require nearly 1300 globes of the size of our earth to make\r\none of the bulk of Jupiter. A railway-engine travelling at the rate of\r\nthirty-three miles an hour would travel round the earth in a month,\r\nbut would require more than eleven months to perform a journey round\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS SATURN’S RING KNOWN TO THE ANCIENTS?\r\n\r\nIn Maurice’s _Indian Antiquities_ is an engraving of Sani, the Saturn\r\nof the Hindoos, taken from an image in a very ancient pagoda, which\r\nrepresents the deity encompassed by a _ring_ formed of two serpents.\r\nHence it is inferred that the ancients were acquainted with the\r\nexistence of the ring of Saturn.\r\n\r\nArago mentions the remarkable fact of the ring and fourth satellite of\r\nSaturn having been seen by Sir W. Herschel with his smaller telescope\r\nby the naked eye, without any eye-piece.\r\n\r\nThe first or innermost of Saturn’s satellites is nearer to the central\r\nbody than any other of the secondary planets. Its distance from the\r\ncentre of Saturn is 80,088 miles; from the surface of the planet\r\n47,480 miles; and from the outmost edge of the ring only 4916 miles.\r\nThe traveller may form to himself an estimate of the smallness of\r\nthis amount by remembering the statement of the well-known navigator,\r\nCaptain Beechey, that he had in three years passed over 72,800 miles.\r\n\r\nAccording to very recent observations, Saturn’s ring is divided into\r\n_three_ separate rings, which, from the calculations of Mr. Bond, an\r\nAmerican astronomer, must be fluid. He is of opinion that the number\r\nof rings is continually changing, and that their maximum number, in\r\nthe normal condition of the mass, does not exceed _twenty_. Mr. Bond\r\nlikewise maintains that the power which sustains the centre of gravity\r\nof the _ring_ is not in the planet itself, but in its satellites; and\r\nthe satellites, though constantly disturbing the ring, actually sustain\r\nit in the very act of perturbation. M. Otto Struve and Mr. Bond have\r\nlately studied with the great Munich telescope, at the observatory of\r\nPulkowa, the _third_ ring of Saturn, which Mr. Lassell and Mr. Bond\r\ndiscovered to be _fluid_. They saw distinctly the dark interval between\r\nthis fluid ring and the two old ones, and even measured its dimensions;\r\nand they perceived at its inner margin an edge feebly illuminated,\r\nwhich they thought might be the commencement of a fourth ring. These\r\nastronomers are of opinion, that the fluid ring is not of very recent\r\nformation, and that it is not subject to rapid change; and they have\r\ncome to the extraordinary conclusion, that the inner border of the ring\r\nhas, since the time of Huygens, been gradually approaching to the body\r\nof Saturn, and that _we may expect, sooner or later, perhaps in some\r\ndozen of years, to see the rings united with the body of the planet_.\r\nBut this theory is by other observers pronounced untenable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE PLANET MERCURY.\r\n\r\nMercury being so much nearer to the Sun than the Earth, he receives,\r\nit is supposed, seven times more heat than the earth. Mrs. Somerville\r\nsays: “On Mercury, the mean heat arising from the intensity of the\r\nsun’s rays must be above that of boiling quicksilver, and water would\r\nboil even at the poles.” But he may be provided with an atmosphere\r\nso constituted as to absorb or reflect a great portion of the\r\nsuperabundant heat; so that his inhabitants (if he have any) may enjoy\r\na climate as temperate as any on our globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATIONS ON VESTA AND PALLAS.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable peculiarities of these ultra-zodiacal planets,\r\naccording to Sir John Herschel, must lie in this condition of their\r\nstate: a man placed on one of them would spring with ease sixty feet\r\nhigh, and sustain no greater shock in his descent than he does on the\r\nearth from leaping a yard. On such planets, giants might exist; and\r\nthose enormous animals which on the earth require the buoyant power of\r\nwater to counteract their weight, might there be denizens of the land.\r\nBut of such speculations there is no end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE PLANET MARS INHABITED?\r\n\r\nThe opponents of the doctrine of the Plurality of Worlds allow that a\r\ngreater probability exists of Mars being inhabited than in the case of\r\nany other planet. His diameter is 4100 miles; and his surface exhibits\r\nspots of different hues,--the _seas_, according to Sir John Herschel,\r\nbeing _green_, and the land _red_. “The variety in the spots,” says\r\nthis astronomer, “may arise from the planet not being destitute of\r\natmosphere and cloud; and what adds greatly to the probability of this,\r\nis the appearance of brilliant white spots at its poles, which have\r\nbeen conjectured, with some probability, to be snow, as they disappear\r\nwhen they have been long exposed to the sun, and are greatest when\r\nemerging from the long night of their polar winter, the snow-line then\r\nextending to about six degrees from the pole.” “The length of the day,”\r\nsays Sir David Brewster, “is almost exactly twenty-four hours,--the\r\nsame as that of the earth. Continents and oceans and green savannahs\r\nhave been observed upon Mars, and the snow of his polar regions has\r\nbeen seen to disappear with the heat of summer.” We actually see the\r\nclouds floating in the atmosphere of Mars, and there is the appearance\r\nof land and water on his disc. In a sketch of this planet, as seen in\r\nthe pure atmosphere of Calcutta by Mr. Grant, it appears, to use his\r\nwords, “actually as a little world,” and as the earth would appear at\r\na distance, with its seas and continents of different shades. As the\r\ndiameter of Mars is only about one half that of our earth, the weight\r\nof bodies will be about one half what it would be if they were placed\r\nupon our globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE PLANET NEPTUNE.\r\n\r\nThis noble discovery marked in a signal manner the maturity of\r\nastronomical science. The proof, or at least the urgent presumption,\r\nof the existence of such a planet, as a means of accounting (by its\r\nattraction) for certain small irregularities observed in the motions\r\nof Uranus, was afforded almost simultaneously by the independent\r\nresearches of two geometers, Mr. Adams of Cambridge, and M. Leverrier\r\nof Paris, who were enabled _from theory alone_ to calculate whereabouts\r\nit ought to appear in the heavens, _if visible_, the places thus\r\nindependently calculated agreeing surprisingly. _Within a single\r\ndegree_ of the place assigned by M. Leverrier’s calculations, and by\r\nhim communicated to Dr. Galle of the Royal Observatory at Berlin, it\r\nwas actually found by that astronomer on the very first night after\r\nthe receipt of that communication, on turning a telescope on the spot,\r\nand comparing the stars in its immediate neighbourhood with those\r\npreviously laid down in one of the zodiacal charts. This remarkable\r\nverification of an indication so extraordinary took place on the 23d of\r\nSeptember 1846.[20]--_Sir John Herschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\nNeptune revolves round the sun in about 172 years, at a mean distance\r\nof thirty,--that of Uranus being nineteen, and that of the earth one:\r\nand by its discovery the solar system has been extended _one thousand\r\nmillions of miles_ beyond its former limit.\r\n\r\nNeptune is suspected to have a ring, but the suspicion has not been\r\nconfirmed. It has been demonstrated by the observations of Mr. Lassell,\r\nM. Otto Struve, and Mr. Bond, to be attended by at least one satellite.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious facts brought to light by the discovery of\r\nNeptune, is the failure of Bode’s law to give an approximation to its\r\ndistance from the sun; a striking exemplification of the danger of\r\ntrusting to the universal applicability of an empirical law. After\r\nstanding the severe test which led to the discovery of the asteroids,\r\nit seemed almost contrary to the laws of probability that the discovery\r\nof another member of the planetary system should prove its failure as\r\nan universal rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNITUDE OF COMETS.\r\n\r\nAlthough Comets have a smaller mass than any other cosmical\r\nbodies--being, according to our present knowledge, probably not equal\r\nto 1/5000th part of the earth’s mass--yet they occupy the largest\r\nspace, as their tails in several instances extend over many millions of\r\nmiles. The cone of luminous vapour which radiates from them has been\r\nfound in some cases (as in 1680 and 1811) equal to the length of the\r\nearth’s distance from the sun, forming a line that intersects both the\r\norbits of Venus and Mercury. It is even probable that the vapour of\r\nthe tails of comets mingled with our atmosphere in the years 1819 and\r\n1823.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMETS VISIBLE IN SUNSHINE--THE GREAT COMET OF 1843.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the tail of a Comet being visible in bright Sunshine,\r\nwhich is recorded of the comet of 1402, occurred again in the case of\r\nthe large comet of 1843, whose nucleus and tail were seen in North\r\nAmerica on February 28th (according to the testimony of J. G. Clarke,\r\nof Portland, State of Maine), between one and three o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. The distance of the very dense nucleus from the sun’s\r\nlight admitted of being measured with much exactness. The nucleus and\r\ntail (a darker space intervening) appeared like a very pure white\r\ncloud.--_American Journal of Science_, vol. xiv.\r\n\r\nE. C. Otté, the translator of Bohn’s edition of Humboldt’s _Cosmos_,\r\nat New Bedford, Massachusetts, U.S., Feb. 28th, 1843, distinctly saw\r\nthe above comet between one and two in the afternoon. The sky at the\r\ntime was intensely blue, and the sun shining with a dazzling brightness\r\nunknown in European climates.\r\n\r\nThis very remarkable Comet, seen in England on the 17th of March\r\n1843, had a nucleus with the appearance of a planetary disc, and the\r\nbrightness of a star of the first or second magnitude. It had a double\r\ntail divided by a dark line. At the Cape of Good Hope it was seen in\r\nfull daylight, and in the immediate vicinity of the sea; but the most\r\nremarkable fact in its history was its near approach to the sun, its\r\ndistance from his surface being only _one-fourteenth_ of his diameter.\r\nThe heat to which it was exposed, therefore, was much greater than that\r\nwhich Sir Isaac Newton ascribed to the comet of 1680, namely 200 times\r\nthat of red-hot iron. Sir John Herschel has computed that it must have\r\nbeen 24 times greater than that which was produced in the focus of\r\nParker’s burning lens, 32 inches in diameter, which melts crystals of\r\nquartz and agate.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY UNFATHOMABLE.\r\n\r\nM. Struve of Pulkowa has compared Sir William Herschel’s opinion\r\non this subject, as maintained in 1785, with that to which he was\r\nsubsequently led; and arrives at the conclusion that, according to Sir\r\nW. Herschel himself, the visible extent of the Milky Way increases with\r\nthe penetrating power of the telescopes employed; that it is impossible\r\nto discover by his instruments the termination of the Milky Way (as an\r\nindependent cluster of stars); and that even his gigantic telescope of\r\nforty feet focal length does not enable him to extend our knowledge\r\nof the Milky Way, which is incapable of being sounded. Sir William\r\nHerschel’s _Theory of the Milky Way_ was as follows: He considered\r\nour solar system, and all the stars which we can see with the eye, as\r\nplaced within, and constituting a part of, the nebula of the Milky Way,\r\na congeries of many millions of stars, so that the projection of these\r\nstars must form a luminous track on the concavity of the sky; and by\r\nestimating or counting the number of stars in different directions, he\r\nwas able to form a rude judgment of the probable form of the nebula,\r\nand of the probable position of the solar system within it.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable belt has maintained from the earliest ages the same\r\nrelative situation among the stars; and, when examined through powerful\r\ntelescopes, is found (wonderful to relate!) _to consist entirely of\r\nstars scattered by millions_, like glittering dust, on the black ground\r\nof the general heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANCES OF NEBULÆ.\r\n\r\nThese are truly astounding. Sir William Herschel estimated the distance\r\nof the annular nebula between Beta and Gamma Lyræ to be from our system\r\n950 times that of Sirius; and a globular cluster about 5½° south-east\r\nof Beta Sir William computed to be one thousand three hundred billions\r\nof miles from our system. Again, in Scutum Sobieski is one nebula in\r\nthe shape of a horseshoe; but which, when viewed with high magnifying\r\npower, presents a different appearance. Sir William Herschel estimated\r\nthis nebula to be 900 times farther from us than Sirius. In some parts\r\nof its vicinity he observed 588 stars in his telescope at one time;\r\nand he counted 258,000 in a space 10° long and 2½° wide. There is a\r\nglobular cluster between the mouths of Pegasus and Equuleus, which\r\nSir William Herschel estimated to be 243 times farther from us than\r\nSirius. Caroline Herschel discovered in the right foot of Andromeda\r\na nebula of enormous dimensions, placed at an inconceivable distance\r\nfrom us: it consists probably of myriads of solar systems, which, taken\r\ntogether, are but a point in the universe. The nebula about 10° west of\r\nthe principal star in Triangulum is supposed by Sir William Herschel\r\nto be 344 times the distance of Sirius from the earth, which would be\r\nthe immense sum of nearly seventeen thousand billions of miles from our\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFINITE SPACE.\r\n\r\nAfter the straining mind has exhausted all its resources in attempting\r\nto fathom the distance of the smallest telescopic star, or the faintest\r\nnebula, it has reached only the visible confines of the sidereal\r\ncreation. The universe of stars is but an atom in the universe of\r\nspace; above it, and beneath it, and around it, there is still infinity.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF OUR PLANETARY SYSTEM. THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS.[22]\r\n\r\nThe commencement of our Planetary System, including the sun, must,\r\naccording to Kant and Laplace, be regarded as an immense nebulous mass\r\nfilling the portion of space which is now occupied by our system far\r\nbeyond the limits of Neptune, our most distant planet. Even now we\r\nperhaps see similar masses in the distant regions of the firmament, as\r\npatches of nebulæ, and nebulous stars; within our system also, comets,\r\nthe zodiacal light, the corona of the sun during a total eclipse,\r\nexhibit resemblances of a nebulous substance, which is so thin that the\r\nlight of the stars passes through it unenfeebled and unrefracted. If we\r\ncalculate the density of the mass of our planetary system, according\r\nto the above assumption, for the time when it was a nebulous sphere\r\nwhich reached to the path of the outmost planet, we should find that\r\nit would require several cubic miles of such matter to weigh a single\r\ngrain.--_Professor Helmholtz._\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century ago, Sir John Herschel expressed his opinion\r\nthat those nebulæ which were not resolved into individual stars by the\r\nhighest powers then used, might be hereafter completely resolved by a\r\nfurther increase of optical power:\r\n\r\n  In fact, this probability has almost been converted into a\r\n  certainty by the magnificent reflecting telescope constructed by\r\n  Lord Rosse, of 6 feet in aperture, which has resolved, or rendered\r\n  resolvable, multitudes of nebulæ which had resisted all inferior\r\n  powers. The sublimity of the spectacle afforded by that instrument\r\n  of some of the larger globular and other clusters is declared by\r\n  all who have witnessed it to be such as no words can express.[23]\r\n\r\n  Although, therefore, nebulæ do exist, which even in this powerful\r\n  telescope appear as nebulæ, without any sign of resolution, it may\r\n  very reasonably be doubted whether there be really any essential\r\n  physical distinction between nebulæ and clusters of stars, at least\r\n  in the nature of the matter of which they consist; and whether the\r\n  distinction between such nebulæ as are easily resolved, barely\r\n  resolvable with excellent telescopes, and altogether irresolvable\r\n  with the best, be any thing else than one of degree, arising merely\r\n  from the excessive minuteness and multitude of the stars of which\r\n  the latter, as compared with the former, consist.--_Outlines of\r\n  Astronomy_, 5th edit. 1858.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, that Sir John Herschel considers the “nebular\r\nhypothesis” and the above theory of sidereal aggregation to stand quite\r\nindependent of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF HEAT IN OUR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nProfessor Helmholtz, assuming that at the commencement the density of\r\nthe nebulous matter was a vanishing quantity, as compared with the\r\npresent density of the sun and planets, calculates how much work has\r\nbeen performed by the condensation; how much of this work still exists\r\nin the form of mechanical force, as attraction of the planets towards\r\nthe sun, and as _vis viva_ of their motion; and finds by this how much\r\nof the force has been converted into heat.\r\n\r\n  The result of this calculation is, that only about the 45th part\r\n  of the original mechanical force remains as such, and that the\r\n  remainder, converted into heat, would be sufficient to raise a\r\n  mass of water equal to the sun and planets taken together, not\r\n  less than 28,000,000 of degrees of the centigrade scale. For the\r\n  sake of comparison, Professor Helmholtz mentions that the highest\r\n  temperature which we can produce by the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe,\r\n  which is sufficient to vaporise even platina, and which but few\r\n  bodies can endure, is estimated at about 2000 degrees. Of the\r\n  action of a temperature of 28,000,000 of such degrees we can form\r\n  no notion. If the mass of our entire system were of pure coal, by\r\n  the combustion of the whole of it only the 350th part of the above\r\n  quantity would be generated.\r\n\r\n  The store of force at present possessed by our system is equivalent\r\n  to immense quantities of heat. If our earth were by a sudden shock\r\n  brought to rest in her orbit--which is not to be feared in the\r\n  existing arrangement of our system--by such a shock a quantity of\r\n  heat would be generated equal to that produced by the combustion of\r\n  fourteen such earths of solid coal. Making the most unfavourable\r\n  assumption as to its capacity for heat, that is, placing it equal\r\n  to that of water, the mass of the earth would thereby be heated\r\n  11,200°; it would therefore be quite fused, and for the most part\r\n  reduced to vapour. If, then, the earth, after having been thus\r\n  brought to rest, should fall into the sun, which of course would be\r\n  the case, the quantity of heat developed by the shock would be 400\r\n  times greater.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ASTRONOMER’S DREAM VERIFIED.\r\n\r\nThe most fertile region in astronomical discovery during the last\r\nquarter of a century has been the planetary members of the solar\r\nsystem. In 1833, Sir John Herschel enumerated ten planets as visible\r\nfrom the earth, either by the unaided eye or by the telescope; the\r\nnumber is now increased more than fivefold. With the exception of\r\nNeptune, the discovery of new planets is confined to the class called\r\nAsteroids. These all revolve in elliptic orbits between those of\r\nJupiter and Mars. Zitius of Wittemberg discovered an empirical law,\r\nwhich seemed to govern the distances of the planets from the sun; but\r\nthere was a remarkable interruption in the law, according to which a\r\nplanet ought to have been placed between Mars and Jupiter. Professor\r\nBode of Berlin directed the attention of astronomers to the possibility\r\nof such a planet existing; and in seven years’ observations from the\r\ncommencement of the present century, not one but four planets were\r\nfound, differing widely from one another in the elements of their\r\norbits, but agreeing very nearly at their mean distances from the sun\r\nwith that of the supposed planet. This curious coincidence of the mean\r\ndistances of these four asteroids with the planet according to Bode’s\r\nlaw, as it is generally called, led to the conjecture that these four\r\nplanets were but fragments of the missing planet, blown to atoms by\r\nsome internal explosion, and that many more fragments might exist, and\r\nbe possibly discovered by diligent search.\r\n\r\nConcerning this apparently wild hypothesis, Sir John Herschel offered\r\nthe following remarkable apology: “This may serve as a specimen of the\r\ndreams in which astronomers, like other speculators, occasionally and\r\nharmlessly indulge.”\r\n\r\nThe dream, wild as it appeared, has been realised now. Sir John, in the\r\nfifth edition of his _Outlines of Astronomy_, published in 1858, tells\r\nus:\r\n\r\n  Whatever may be thought of such a speculation as a physical\r\n  hypothesis, this conclusion has been verified to a considerable\r\n  extent as a matter of fact by subsequent discovery, the result\r\n  of a careful and minute examination and mapping down of the\r\n  smaller stars in and near the zodiac, undertaken with that express\r\n  object. Zodiacal charts of this kind, the product of the zeal and\r\n  industry of many astronomers, have been constructed, in which\r\n  every star down to the ninth, tenth, or even lower magnitudes, is\r\n  inserted; and these stars being compared with the actual stars of\r\n  the heavens, the intrusion of any stranger within their limits\r\n  cannot fail to be noticed when the comparison is systematically\r\n  conducted. The discovery of Astræa and Hebe by Professor Hencke,\r\n  in 1845 and 1847, revived the flagging spirit of inquiry in this\r\n  direction; with what success, the list of fifty-two asteroids,\r\n  with their names and the dates of their discovery, will best show.\r\n  The labours of our indefatigable countryman, Mr. Hind, have been\r\n  rewarded by the discovery of no less than eight of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE-BALLS AND SHOOTING STARS.\r\n\r\nHumboldt relates, that a friend at Popayan, at an elevation of 5583\r\nfeet above the sea-level, at noon, when the sun was shining brightly\r\nin a cloudless sky, saw his room lighted up by a fire-ball: he had his\r\nback towards the window at the time, and on turning round, perceived\r\nthat great part of the path traversed by the fire-ball was still\r\nilluminated by the brightest radiance. The Germans call these phenomena\r\n_star-snuff_, from the vulgar notion that the lights in the firmament\r\nundergo a process of snuffing, or cleaning. Other nations call it _a\r\nshot or fall of stars_, and the English _star-shoot_. Certain tribes\r\nof the Orinoco term the pearly drops of dew which cover the beautiful\r\nleaves of the heliconia _star-spit_. In the Lithuanian mythology, the\r\nnature and signification of falling stars are embodied under nobler and\r\nmore graceful symbols. The Parcæ, _Werpeja_, weave in heaven for the\r\nnew-born child its thread of fate, attaching each separate thread to\r\na star. When death approaches the person, the thread is rent, and the\r\nstar wanes and sinks to the earth.--_Jacob Grimm._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY AND EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nIn the perpetual vicissitude of theoretical views, says the author of\r\n_Giordano Bruno_, “most men see nothing in philosophy but a succession\r\nof passing meteors; whilst even the grander forms in which she has\r\nrevealed herself share the fate of comets,--bodies that do not rank in\r\npopular opinion amongst the external and permanent works of nature, but\r\nare regarded as mere fugitive apparitions of igneous vapour.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORITES FROM THE MOON.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of the selenic origin of meteoric stones depends upon\r\na number of conditions, the accidental coincidence of which could\r\nalone convert a possible to an actual fact. The view of the original\r\nexistence of small planetary masses in space is simpler, and at\r\nthe same time more analogous with those entertained concerning the\r\nformation of other portions of the solar system.\r\n\r\n  Diogenes Laertius thought aerolites came from the sun; but Pliny\r\n  derides this theory. The fall of aerolites in bright sunshine, and\r\n  when the moon’s disc was invisible, probably led to the idea of\r\n  sun-stones. Moreover Anaxagoras regarded the sun as “a molten fiery\r\n  mass;” and Euripides, in Phaëton, terms the sun “a golden mass,”\r\n  that is to say, a fire-coloured, brightly-shining matter, but not\r\n  leading to the inference that aerolites are golden sun-stones.\r\n  The Greek philosophers had four hypotheses as to their origin:\r\n  telluric, from ascending exhalations; masses of stone raised by\r\n  hurricanes; a solar origin; and lastly, an origin in the regions of\r\n  space, as heavenly bodies which had long remained invisible: the\r\n  last opinion entirely according with that of the present day.\r\n\r\n  Chladni states that an Italian physicist, Paolo Maria Terzago,\r\n  on the occasion of the fall of an aerolite at Milan, in 1660, by\r\n  which a Franciscan monk was killed, was the first who surmised that\r\n  aerolites were of selenic origin. Without any previous knowledge\r\n  of this conjecture, Olbers was led, in 1795 (after the celebrated\r\n  fall at Siena, June 16th, 1794), to investigate the amount of the\r\n  initial tangential force that would be required to bring to the\r\n  earth masses projected from the moon. Olbers, Brandes, and Chaldni\r\n  thought that “the velocity of 16 to 32 miles, with which fire-balls\r\n  and shooting-stars entered our atmosphere,” furnished a refutation\r\n  to the view of their selenic origin. According to Olbers, it would\r\n  require to reach the earth, setting aside the resistance of the\r\n  air, an initial velocity of 8292 feet in the second; according to\r\n  Laplace, 7862; to Biot, 8282; and to Poisson, 7595. Laplace states\r\n  that this velocity is only five or six times as great as that of\r\n  a cannon-ball; but Olbers has shown that “with such an initial\r\n  velocity as 7500 or 8000 feet in a second, meteoric stones would\r\n  arrive at the surface of our earth with a velocity of only 35,000\r\n  feet.” But the measured velocity of meteoric stones averages\r\n  upwards of 114,000 feet to a second; consequently the original\r\n  velocity of projection from the moon must be almost 110,000 feet,\r\n  and therefore 14 times greater than Laplace asserted. It must,\r\n  however, be recollected, that the opinion then so prevalent, of the\r\n  existence of active volcanoes in the moon, where air and water are\r\n  absent, has since been abandoned.\r\n\r\n  Laplace elsewhere states, that in all probability aerolites “come\r\n  from the depths of space;” yet he in another passage inclines to\r\n  the hypothesis of their lunar origin, always, however, assuming\r\n  that the stones projected from the moon “become satellites of our\r\n  earth, describing around it more or less eccentric orbits, and thus\r\n  not reaching its atmosphere until several or even many revolutions\r\n  have been accomplished.”\r\n\r\n  In Syria there is a popular belief that aerolites chiefly fall\r\n  on clear moonlight nights. The ancients (Pliny tells us) looked\r\n  for their fall during lunar eclipses.--_Abridged from Humboldt’s\r\n  Cosmos_, vol. i. (Bohn’s edition).\r\n\r\nDr. Laurence Smith, U.S., accepts the “lunar theory,” and considers\r\nmeteorites to be masses thrown off from the moon, the attractive power\r\nof which is but one-sixth that of the earth; so that bodies thrown from\r\nthe surface of the moon experience but one sixth the retarding force\r\nthey would have when thrown from the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\n  Look again (says Dr. Smith) at the constitution of the meteorite,\r\n  made up principally of _pure_ iron. It came evidently from some\r\n  place where there is little or no oxygen. Now the moon has no\r\n  atmosphere, and no water on its surface. There is no oxygen there.\r\n  Hurled from the moon, these bodies,--these masses of almost pure\r\n  iron,--would flame in the sun like polished steel, and on reaching\r\n  our atmosphere would burn in its oxygen until a black oxide cooled\r\n  it; and this we find to be the case with all meteorites,--the\r\n  black colour is only an external covering.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy, from facts contained in his researches on flame,\r\nin 1817, conceives that the light of meteors depends, not upon the\r\nignition of inflammable gases, but upon that of solid bodies; that such\r\nis their velocity of motion, as to excite sufficient heat for their\r\nignition by the compression even of rare air; and that the phenomena of\r\nfalling stars may be explained by regarding them as small incombustible\r\nbodies moving round the earth in very eccentric orbits, and becoming\r\nignited only when they pass with immense rapidity through the upper\r\nregions of the atmosphere; whilst those meteors which throw down stony\r\nbodies are, similarly circumstanced, combustible masses.\r\n\r\nMasses of iron and nickel, having all the appearance of aerolites or\r\nmeteoric stones, have been discovered in Siberia, at a depth of ten\r\nmetres below the surface of the earth. From the fact, however, that no\r\nmeteoric stones are found in the secondary and tertiary formations, it\r\nwould seem to follow that the phenomena of falling stones did not take\r\nplace till the earth assumed its present conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAST SHOWER OF METEORS.\r\n\r\nThe most magnificent Shower of Meteors that has ever been known was\r\nthat which fell during the night of November 12th, 1833, commencing\r\nat nine o’clock in the evening, and continuing till the morning sun\r\nconcealed the meteors from view. This shower extended from Canada to\r\nthe northern boundary of South America, and over a tract of nearly 3000\r\nmiles in width.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMENSE METEORITE.\r\n\r\nMrs. Somerville mentions a Meteorite which passed within twenty-five\r\nmiles of our planet, and was estimated to weigh 600,000 tons, and to\r\nmove with a velocity of twenty miles in a second. Only a small fragment\r\nof this immense mass reached the earth. Four instances are recorded\r\nof persons being killed by their fall. A block of stone fell at Ægos\r\nPotamos, B.C. 465, as large as two millstones; another at Narni, in\r\n921, projected like a rock four feet above the surface of the river,\r\nin which it was seen to fall. The Emperor Jehangire had a sword forged\r\nfrom a mass of meteoric iron, which fell in 1620 at Jahlinder in the\r\nPunjab. Sixteen instances of the fall of stones in the British Isles\r\nare well authenticated to have occurred since 1620, one of them in\r\nLondon. It is very remarkable that no new chemical element has been\r\ndetected in any of the numerous meteorites which have been analysed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO FOSSIL METEORIC STONES.\r\n\r\nIt is (says Olbers) a remarkable but hitherto unregarded fact, that\r\nwhile shells are found in secondary and tertiary formations, no Fossil\r\nMeteoric Stones have as yet been discovered. May we conclude from this\r\ncircumstance, that previous to the present and last modification of the\r\nearth’s surface no meteoric stones fell on it, though at the present\r\ntime it appears probable, from the researches of Schreibers, that 700\r\nfall annually?[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF OUR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nWhile all the phenomena in the heavens indicate a law of progressive\r\ncreation, in which revolving matter is distributed into suns and\r\nplanets, there are indications in our own system that a period has been\r\nassigned for its duration, which, sooner or later, it must reach. The\r\nmedium which fills universal space, whether it be a luminiferous ether,\r\nor arise from the indefinite expansion of planetary atmospheres, must\r\nretard the bodies which move in it, even were it 360,000 millions of\r\ntimes more rare than atmospheric air; and, with its time of revolution\r\ngradually shortening, the satellite must return to its planet, the\r\nplanet to its sun, and the sun to its primeval nebula. The fate of our\r\nsystem, thus deduced from mechanical laws, must be the fate of all\r\nothers. Motion cannot be perpetuated in a resisting medium; and where\r\nthere exist disturbing forces, there must be primarily derangement,\r\nand ultimately ruin. From the great central mass, heat may again be\r\nsummoned to exhale nebulous matter; chemical forces may again produce\r\nmotion, and motion may again generate systems; but, as in the recurring\r\ncatastrophes which have desolated our earth, the great First Cause must\r\npreside at the dawn of each cosmical cycle; and, as in the animal races\r\nwhich were successively reproduced, new celestial creations of a nobler\r\nform of beauty and of a higher form of permanence may yet appear in\r\nthe sidereal universe. “Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth,\r\nand the former shall not be remembered.” “The new heavens and the\r\nnew earth shall remain before me.” “Let us look, then, according to\r\nthis promise, for the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth\r\nrighteousness.”--_North-British Review_, No. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENEFITS OF GLASS TO MAN.\r\n\r\nCuvier eloquently says: “It could not be expected that those Phœnician\r\nsailors who saw the sand of the shores of Bætica transformed by fire\r\ninto a transparent Glass, should have at once foreseen that this new\r\nsubstance would prolong the pleasures of sight to the old; that it\r\nwould one day assist the astronomer in penetrating the depths of the\r\nheavens, and in numbering the stars of the Milky Way; that it would\r\nlay open to the naturalist a miniature world, as populous, as rich in\r\nwonders as that which alone seemed to have been granted to his senses\r\nand his contemplation: in fine, that the most simple and direct use\r\nof it would enable the inhabitants of the coast of the Baltic Sea to\r\nbuild palaces more magnificent than those of Tyre and Memphis, and to\r\ncultivate, almost under the polar circle, the most delicious fruit of\r\nthe torrid zone.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALILEAN TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nGalileo appears to be justly entitled to the honour of having invented\r\nthat form of Telescope which still bears his name; while we must accord\r\nto John Lippershey, the spectacle-maker of Middleburg, the honour of\r\nhaving previously invented the astronomical telescope. The interest\r\nexcited at Venice by Galileo’s invention amounted almost to frenzy.\r\nOn ascending the tower of St. Mark, that he might use one of his\r\ntelescopes without molestation, Galileo was recognised by a crowd in\r\nthe street, who took possession of the wondrous tube, and detained the\r\nimpatient philosopher for several hours, till they had successively\r\nwitnessed its effects. These instruments were soon manufactured in\r\ngreat numbers; but were purchased merely as philosophical toys, and\r\nwere carried by travellers into every corner of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT GALILEO FIRST SAW WITH HIS TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe moon displayed to him her mountain-ranges and her glens, her\r\ncontinents and her highlands, now lying in darkness, now brilliant with\r\nsunshine, and undergoing all those variations of light and shadow which\r\nthe surface of our own globe presents to the alpine traveller or to the\r\naeronaut. The four satellites of Jupiter illuminating their planet, and\r\nsuffering eclipses in his shadow, like our own moon; the spots on the\r\nsun’s disc, proving his rotation round his axis in twenty-five days;\r\nthe crescent phases of Venus, and the triple form or the imperfectly\r\ndeveloped ring of Saturn,--were the other discoveries in the solar\r\nsystem which rewarded the diligence of Galileo. In the starry heavens,\r\ntoo, thousands of new worlds were discovered by his telescope; and the\r\nPleiades alone, which to the unassisted eye exhibit only _seven_ stars,\r\ndisplayed to Galileo no fewer than _forty_.--_North-British Review_,\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\n  The first telescope “the starry Galileo” constructed with a leaden\r\n  tube a few inches long, with a spectacle-glass, one convex and one\r\n  concave, at each of its extremities. It magnified three times.\r\n  Telescopes were made in London in February 1610, a year after\r\n  Galileo had completed his own (Rigaud, _On Harriot’s Papers_,\r\n  1833). They were at first called _cylinders_. The telescopes which\r\n  Galileo constructed, and others of which he made use for observing\r\n  Jupiter’s satellites, the phases of Venus, and the solar spots,\r\n  possessed the gradually-increasing powers of magnifying four,\r\n  seven, and thirty-two linear diameters; but they never had a higher\r\n  power.--Arago, in the _Annuaire_ for 1842.\r\n\r\n  Clock-work is now applied to the equatorial telescope, so as to\r\n  allow the observer to follow the course of any star, comet, or\r\n  planet he may wish to observe continuously, without using his hands\r\n  for the mechanical motion of the instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nLong tubes were certainly employed by Arabian astronomers, and very\r\nprobably also by the Greeks and Romans; the exactness of their\r\nobservations being in some degree attributable to their causing the\r\nobject to be seen through diopters or slits. Abul Hassan speaks very\r\ndistinctly of tubes, to the extremities of which ocular and object\r\ndiopters were attached; and instruments so constructed were used in\r\nthe observatory founded by Hulagu at Meragha. If stars be more easily\r\ndiscovered during twilight by means of tubes, and if a star be sooner\r\nrevealed to the naked eye through a tube than without it, the reason\r\nlies, as Arago has truly observed, in the circumstance that the tube\r\nconceals a great portion of the disturbing light diffused in the\r\natmospheric strata between the star and the eye applied to the tube.\r\nIn like manner, the tube prevents the lateral impression of the faint\r\nlight which the particles of air receive at night from all the other\r\nstars in the firmament. The intensity of the image and the size of the\r\nstar are apparently augmented.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. iii. p. 53.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON’S FIRST REFLECTING TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe year 1668 may be regarded as the date of the invention of\r\nNewton’s Reflecting Telescope. Five years previously, James Gregory\r\nhad described the manner of constructing a reflecting telescope with\r\ntwo concave specula; but Newton perceived the disadvantages to be so\r\ngreat, that, according to his statement, he “found it necessary, before\r\nattempting any thing in the practice, to alter the design, and place\r\nthe eye-glass at the side of the tube rather than at the middle.” On\r\nthis improved principle Newton constructed his telescope, which was\r\nexamined by Charles II.; it was presented to the Royal Society near the\r\nend of 1671, and is carefully preserved by that distinguished body,\r\nwith the inscription:\r\n\r\n  “THE FIRST REFLECTING TELESCOPE; INVENTED BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON, AND\r\n  MADE WITH HIS OWN HANDS.”\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster describes this telescope as consisting of a concave\r\nmetallic speculum, the radius of curvature of which was 12-2/3 or\r\n13 inches, so that “it collected the sun’s rays at the distance of\r\n6-1/3 inches.” The rays reflected by the speculum were received upon\r\na plane metallic speculum inclined 45° to the axis of the tube, so as\r\nto reflect them to the side of the tube in which there was an aperture\r\nto receive a small tube with a plano-convex eye-glass whose radius\r\nwas one-twelfth of an inch, by means of which the image formed by\r\nthe speculum was magnified 38 times. Such was the first reflecting\r\ntelescope applied to the heavens; but Sir David Brewster describes\r\nthis instrument as small and ill-made; and fifty years elapsed before\r\ntelescopes of the Newtonian form became useful in astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM HERSCHEL’S GREAT TELESCOPE AT SLOUGH.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this Telescope was intimated by Herschel, through Sir\r\nJoseph Banks, to George III., who offered to defray the whole expense\r\nof it; a noble act of liberality, which has never been imitated by\r\nany other British sovereign. Towards the close of 1785, accordingly,\r\nHerschel began to construct his reflecting telescope, _forty feet in\r\nlength_, and having a speculum _fully four feet in diameter_. The\r\nthickness of the speculum, which was uniform in every part, was 3½\r\ninches, and its weight nearly 2118 pounds; the metal being composed of\r\n32 copper, and 10·7 of tin: it was the third speculum cast, the two\r\nprevious attempts having failed. The speculum, when not in use, was\r\npreserved from damp by a tin cover, fitted upon a rim of close-grained\r\ncloth. The tube of the telescope was 39 ft. 4 in. long, and its width 4\r\nft. 10 in.; it was made of iron, and was 3000 lbs. lighter than if it\r\nhad been made of wood. The observer was seated in a suspended movable\r\nseat at the mouth of the tube, and viewed the image of the object with\r\na magnifying lens or eye-piece. The focus of the speculum, or place of\r\nthe image, was within four inches of the lower side of the mouth of the\r\ntube, and came forward into the air, so that there was space for part\r\nof the head above the eye, to prevent it from intercepting many of the\r\nrays going from the object to the mirror. The eye-piece moved in a tube\r\ncarried by a slider directed to the centre of the speculum, and fixed\r\non an adjustible foundation at the mouth of the tube. It was completed\r\non the 27th August 1789; and _the very first moment_ it was directed to\r\nthe heavens, a new body was added to the solar system, namely, Saturn\r\nand six of its satellites; and in less than a month after, the seventh\r\nsatellite of Saturn, “an object,” says Sir John Herschel, “of a far\r\nhigher order of difficulty.”--_Abridged from the North-British Review_,\r\nNo. 3.\r\n\r\n  This magnificent instrument stood on the lawn in the rear of Sir\r\n  William Herschel’s house at Slough; and some of our readers, like\r\n  ourselves, may remember its extraordinary aspect when seen from\r\n  the Bath coach-road, and the road to Windsor. The difficulty of\r\n  managing so large an instrument--requiring as it did two assistants\r\n  in addition to the observer himself and the person employed to note\r\n  the time--prevented its being much used. Sir John Herschel, in a\r\n  letter to Mr. Weld, states the entire cost of its construction,\r\n  4000_l._, was defrayed by George III. In 1839, the woodwork of\r\n  the telescope being decayed, Sir John Herschel had it cleared\r\n  away; and piers were erected, on which the tube was placed, _that_\r\n  being of iron, and so well preserved that, although not more than\r\n  one-twentieth of an inch thick, when in the horizontal position\r\n  it contained within all Sir John’s family; and next the two\r\n  reflectors, the polishing apparatus, and portions of the machinery,\r\n  to the amount of a great many tons. Sir John attributes this great\r\n  strength and resistance to the internal structure of the tube, very\r\n  similar to that patented under the name of corrugated iron-roping.\r\n  Sir John Herschel also thinks that system of triangular arrangement\r\n  of the woodwork was upon the principle to which “diagonal bracing”\r\n  owes its strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF ROSSE’S GREAT REFLECTING TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster has remarked, that “the long interval of half\r\na century seems to be the period of hybernation during which the\r\ntelescopic mind rests from its labours in order to acquire strength for\r\nsome great achievement. Fifty years elapsed between the dwarf telescope\r\nof Newton and the large instruments of Hadley; other fifty years rolled\r\non before Sir William Herschel constructed his magnificent telescope;\r\nand fifty years more passed away before the Earl of Rosse produced\r\nthat colossal instrument which has already achieved such brilliant\r\ndiscoveries.”[25]\r\n\r\nIn the improvement of the Reflecting Telescope, the first object\r\nhas always been to increase the magnifying power and light by the\r\nconstruction of as large a mirror as possible; and to this point Lord\r\nRosse’s attention was directed as early as 1828, the field of operation\r\nbeing at his lordship’s seat, Birr Castle at Parsonstown, about fifty\r\nmiles west of Dublin. For this high branch of scientific inquiry Lord\r\nRosse was well fitted by a rare combination of “talent to devise,\r\npatience to bear disappointment, perseverance, profound mathematical\r\nknowledge, mechanical skill, and uninterrupted leisure from other\r\npursuits;”[26] all these, however, would not have been sufficient, had\r\nnot a great command of money been added; the gigantic telescope we are\r\nabout to describe having cost certainly not less than twelve thousand\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n  Lord Rosse ground and polished specula fifteen inches, two feet,\r\n  and three feet in diameter before he commenced the colossal\r\n  instrument. It is impossible here to detail the admirable\r\n  contrivances and processes by which he prepared himself for this\r\n  great work. He first ascertained the most useful combination of\r\n  metals for specula, both in whiteness, porosity, and hardness,\r\n  to be copper and tin. Of this compound the reflector was cast in\r\n  pieces, which were fixed on a bed of zinc and copper,--a species\r\n  of brass which expanded in the same degree by heat as the pieces\r\n  of the speculum themselves. They were ground as one body to a true\r\n  surface, and then polished by machinery moved by a steam-engine.\r\n  The peculiarities of this mechanism were entirely Lord Rosse’s\r\n  invention, and the result of close calculation and observation:\r\n  they were chiefly, placing the speculum with the face upward,\r\n  regulating the temperature by having it immersed in water, usually\r\n  at 55° Fahr., and regulating the pressure and velocity. This was\r\n  found to work a perfect spherical figure in large surfaces with\r\n  a degree of precision unattainable by the hand; the polisher, by\r\n  working above and upon the face of the speculum, being enabled\r\n  to examine the operation as it proceeded without removing the\r\n  speculum, which, when a ton weight, is no easy matter.\r\n\r\n  The contrivance for doing this is very beautiful. The machine is\r\n  placed in a room at the bottom of a high tower, in the successive\r\n  floors of which trap-doors can be opened. A mast is elevated on the\r\n  top of the tower, so that its summit is about ninety feet _above_\r\n  the speculum. A dial-plate is attached to the top of the mast, and\r\n  a small plane speculum and eye-piece, with proper adjustments,\r\n  are so placed that the combination becomes a Newtonian telescope,\r\n  and the dial-plate the object. The last and most important part\r\n  of the process of working the speculum, is to give it a _true\r\n  parabolic figure_, that is, such a figure that each portion of it\r\n  should reflect the incident ray to the same focus. Lord Rosse’s\r\n  operations for this purpose consist--1st, of a stroke of the first\r\n  eccentric, which carries the polisher along _one-third_ of the\r\n  diameter of the speculum; 2d, a transverse stroke twenty-one times\r\n  slower, and equal to 0·27 of the same diameter, measured on the\r\n  edge of the tank, or 1·7 beyond the centre of the polisher; 3d, a\r\n  rotation of the speculum performed in the same time as thirty-seven\r\n  of the first strokes; and 4th, a rotation of the polisher in the\r\n  same direction about sixteen times slower. If these rules are\r\n  attended to, the machine will give the true parabolic figure to the\r\n  speculum, whether it be _six inches_ or _three feet in diameter_.\r\n  In the three-feet speculum, the figure is so true with the whole\r\n  aperture, that it is thrown out of focus by a motion of less\r\n  than the _thirtieth of an inch_, “and even with a single lens of\r\n  one-eighth of an inch focus, giving a power of 2592, the dots on a\r\n  watch-dial are still in some degree defined.”\r\n\r\nThus was executed the three-feet speculum for the twenty-six-feet\r\ntelescope placed upon the lawn at Parsonstown, which, in 1840, showed\r\nwith powers up to 1000 and even 1600; and which resolved nebulæ into\r\nstars, and destroyed that symmetry of form in globular nebulæ upon\r\nwhich was founded the hypothesis of the gradual condensation of\r\nnebulous matter into suns and planets.[27]\r\n\r\nScarcely was this instrument out of Lord Rosse’s hands, when he\r\nresolved to attempt by the same processes to construct another\r\nreflector, with a speculum _six feet_ in diameter and _fifty feet\r\nlong_! and this magnificent instrument was completed early in 1845.\r\nThe focal length of the speculum is fifty-four feet. It weighs four\r\ntons, and, with its supports, is seven times as heavy as the four-feet\r\nspeculum of Sir William Herschel. The speculum is placed in one of\r\nthe sides of a cubical wooden box, about eight feet wide, and to the\r\nopposite end of this box is fastened the tube, which is made of deal\r\nstaves an inch thick, hooped with iron clamp-rings, like a huge cask.\r\nIt carries at its upper end, and in the axis of the tube, a small oval\r\nspeculum, six inches in its lesser diameter.\r\n\r\nThe tube is about 50 feet long and 8 feet in diameter in the middle,\r\nand furnished with diaphragms 6½ feet in aperture. The late Dean of Ely\r\nwalked through the tube with an umbrella up.\r\n\r\nThe telescope is established between two lofty castellated piers 60\r\nfeet high, and is raised to different altitudes by a strong chain-cable\r\nattached to the top of the tube. This cable passes over a pulley on\r\na frame down to a windlass on the ground, which is wrought by two\r\nassistants. To the frame are attached chain-guys fastened to the\r\ncounterweights; and the telescope is balanced by these counterweights\r\nsuspended by chains, which are fixed to the sides of the tube and pass\r\nover large iron pulleys. The immense mass of matter weighs about twelve\r\ntons.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern pier is a strong semicircle of cast-iron, with which the\r\ntelescope is connected by a racked bar, with friction-rollers attached\r\nto the tube by wheelwork, so that by means of a handle near the\r\neye-piece, the observer can move the telescope along the bar on either\r\nside of the meridian, to the distance of an hour for an equatorial star.\r\n\r\nOn the western pier are stairs and galleries. The observing gallery is\r\nmoved along a railway by means of wheels and a winch; and the mechanism\r\nfor raising the galleries to various altitudes is very ingenious.\r\nSometimes the galleries, filled with observers, are suspended midway\r\nbetween the two piers, over a chasm sixty feet deep.\r\n\r\nAn excellent description of this immense Telescope at Birr Castle will\r\nbe found in Mr. Weld’s volume of _Vacation Rambles_.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster thus eloquently sketches the powers of the telescope\r\nat the close of his able description of the instrument, which we have\r\nin part quoted from his _Life of Sir Isaac Newton_.\r\n\r\n  We have, in the mornings, walked again and again, and ever with\r\n  new delight, along its mystic tube, and at midnight, with its\r\n  distinguished architect, pondered over the marvellous sights which\r\n  it dis-closes,--the satellites and belts and rings of Saturn,--the\r\n  old and new ring, which is advancing with its crest of waters to\r\n  the body of the planet,--the rocks, and mountains, and valleys, and\r\n  extinct volcanoes of the moon,--the crescent of Venus, with its\r\n  mountainous outline,--the systems of double and triple stars,--the\r\n  nebulæ and starry clusters of every variety of shape,--and those\r\n  spiral nebular formations which baffle human comprehension, and\r\n  constitute the greatest achievement in modern discovery.\r\n\r\nThe Astronomer Royal, Mr. Airy, alludes to the impression made by\r\nthe enormous light of the telescope,--partly by the modifications\r\nproduced in the appearance of nebulæ already figured, partly by the\r\ngreat number of stars seen at a distance from the Milky Way, and\r\npartly from the prodigious brilliancy of Saturn. The account given by\r\nanother astronomer of the appearance of Jupiter was that it resembled a\r\ncoach-lamp in the telescope; and this well expresses the blaze of light\r\nwhich is seen in the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Scoresby thus records the results of his visits:\r\n\r\n  The range opened to us by the great telescope at Birr Castle is\r\n  best, perhaps, apprehended by the now usual measurement--not of\r\n  distances in miles, or millions of miles, or diameters of the\r\n  earth’s orbit, but--of the progress of light in free space. The\r\n  determination within, no doubt, a small proportion of error of\r\n  the parallax of a considerable number of the fixed stars yields,\r\n  according to Mr. Peters, a space betwixt us and the fixed stars of\r\n  the smallest magnitude, the sixth, ordinarily visible to the naked\r\n  eye, of 130 years in the flight of light. This information enables\r\n  us, on the principles of _sounding the heavens_, suggested by Sir\r\n  W. Herschel, with the photometrical researches on the stars of Dr.\r\n  Wollaston and others, to carry the estimation of distances, and\r\n  that by no means on vague assumption, to the limits of space opened\r\n  out by the most effective telescopes. And from the guidance thus\r\n  afforded us as to the comparative power of the six feet speculum\r\n  in the penetration of space as already elucidated, we might fairly\r\n  assume the fact, that if any other telescope now in use could\r\n  follow the sun if removed to the remotest visible position, or\r\n  till its light would require 10,000 years to reach us, the grand\r\n  instrument at Parsonstown would follow it so far that from 20,000\r\n  to 25,000 years would be spent in the transmission of its light to\r\n  the earth. But in the cases of clusters of stars, and of nebulæ\r\n  exhibiting a mere speck of misty luminosity, from the combined\r\n  light of perhaps hundreds of thousands of suns, the _penetration_\r\n  into space, compared with the results of ordinary vision, must\r\n  be enormous; so that it would not be difficult to show the\r\n  _probability_ that a million of years, in flight of light, would\r\n  be requisite, in regard to the most distant, to trace the enormous\r\n  interval.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIGANTIC TELESCOPES PROPOSED.\r\n\r\nHooke is said to have proposed the use of Telescopes having a length of\r\nupwards of 10,000 feet (or nearly two miles), in order to see animals\r\nin the moon! an extravagant expectation which Auzout considered it\r\nnecessary to refute. The Capuchin monk Schyrle von Rheita, who was well\r\nversed in optics, had already spoken of the speedy practicability of\r\nconstructing telescopes that should magnify 4000 times, by means of\r\nwhich the lunar mountains might be accurately laid down.\r\n\r\nOptical instruments of such enormous focal lengths remind us of the\r\nArabian contrivances of measurement: quadrants with a radius of about\r\n190 feet, upon whose graduated limb the image of the sun was received\r\nas in the gnomon, through a small round aperture. Such a quadrant was\r\nerected at Samarcand, probably constructed after the model of the older\r\nsextants of Alchokandi, which were about sixty feet in height.\r\n\r\n\r\nLATE INVENTION OF OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nA writer in the _North-British Review_, No. 50, considers it strange\r\nthat a variety of facts which must have presented themselves to the\r\nmost careless observer should not have led to the earlier construction\r\nof Optical Instruments. The ancients, doubtless, must have formed\r\nmetallic articles with concave surfaces, in which the observer could\r\nnot fail to see himself magnified; and if the radius of the concavity\r\nexceeded twelve inches, twice the focal distance of his eye, he had in\r\nhis hands an extempore reflecting telescope of the Newtonian form, in\r\nwhich the concave metal was the speculum, and his eye the eye-glass,\r\nand which would magnify and bring near him the image of objects nearly\r\nbehind him. Through the spherical drops of water suspended before his\r\neye, an attentive observer might have seen magnified some minute body\r\nplaced accidentally in its anterior focus; and in the eyes of fishes\r\nand quadrupeds which he used for his food, he might have seen, and\r\nmight have extracted, the beautiful lenses which they contain, and\r\nwhich he could not fail to regard as the principal agents in the vision\r\nof the animals to which they belonged. Curiosity might have prompted\r\nhim to look through these remarkable lenses or spheres; and had he\r\nplaced the lens of the smallest minnow, or that of the bird, the sheep,\r\nor the ox, in or before a circular aperture, he would have produced a\r\nmicroscope or microscopes of excellent quality and different magnifying\r\npowers. No such observations seem, however, to have been made; and even\r\nafter the invention of glass, and its conversion into globular vessels,\r\nthrough which, when filled with any fluid, objects are magnified, the\r\nmicroscope remained undiscovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIAD OF CONTEMPORARY ASTRONOMERS.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact in the history of astronomy (says Sir\r\nDavid Brewster), that three of its most distinguished professors\r\nwere contemporaries. Galileo was the contemporary of Tycho during\r\nthirty-seven years, and of Kepler during the fifty-nine years\r\nof his life. Galileo was born seven years before Kepler, and\r\nsurvived him nearly the same time. We have not learned that the\r\nintellectual triumvirate of the age enjoyed any opportunity for mutual\r\ncongratulation. What a privilege would it have been to have contrasted\r\nthe aristocratic dignity of Tycho with the reckless ease of Kepler, and\r\nthe manly and impetuous mien of the Italian sage!--_Brewster’s Life of\r\nNewton._\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEASANT ASTRONOMER.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time that Goodricke discovered the variation of\r\nthe remarkable periodical star Algol, or β Persei, one Palitzch, a\r\nfarmer of Prolitz, near Dresden,--a peasant by station, an astronomer\r\nby nature,--from his familiar acquaintance with the aspect of the\r\nheavens, was led to notice, among so many thousand stars, Algol,\r\nas distinguished from the rest by its variation, and ascertained\r\nits period. The same Palitzch was also the first to re-discover\r\nthe predicted comet of Halley in 1759, which he saw nearly a month\r\nbefore any of the astronomers, who, armed with their telescopes, were\r\nanxiously watching its return. These anecdotes carry us back to the era\r\nof the Chaldean shepherds.--_Sir John Herschel’s Outlines._\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIRBURN-CASTLE OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nLord Macclesfield, the eminent mathematician, who was twelve years\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, built at his seat, Shirburn Castle\r\nin Oxfordshire, an Observatory, about 1739. It stood 100 yards south\r\nfrom the castle-gate, and consisted of a bed-chamber, a room for the\r\ntransit, and the third for a mural quadrant. In the possession of\r\nthe Royal Astronomical Society is a curious print representing two\r\nof Lord Macclesfield’s servants taking observations in the Shirburn\r\nobservatory; they are Thomas Phelps, aged 82, who, from being a\r\nstable-boy to Lord-Chancellor Macclesfield, rose by his merit and\r\ngenius to be appointed observer. His companion is John Bartlett,\r\noriginally a shepherd, in which station he, by books and observation,\r\nacquired such a knowledge in computation, and of the heavenly bodies,\r\nas to induce Lord Macclesfield to appoint him assistant-observer in\r\nhis observatory. Phelps was the person who, on December 23d, 1743,\r\ndiscovered the great comet, and made the first observation of it; an\r\naccount of which is entered in the _Philosophical Transactions_, but\r\nnot the name of the observer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACAILLE’S OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nLacaille, who made more observations than all his contemporaries put\r\ntogether, and whose researches will have the highest value as long as\r\nastronomy is cultivated, had an observatory at the Collège Mazarin,\r\npart of which is now the Palace of the Institute, at Paris.\r\n\r\n  For a long time it had been without observer or instruments;\r\n  under Napoleon’s reign it was demolished. Lacaille never used\r\n  to illuminate the wires of his instruments. The inner part of\r\n  his observatory was painted black; he admitted only the faintest\r\n  light, to enable him to see his pendulum and his paper: his left\r\n  eye was devoted to the service of looking to the pendulum, whilst\r\n  his right eye was kept shut. The latter was only employed to look\r\n  to the telescope, and during the time of observation never opened\r\n  but for this purpose. Thus the faintest light made him distinguish\r\n  the wires, and he very seldom felt the necessity of illuminating\r\n  them. Part of these blackened walls were visible long after the\r\n  demolition of the observatory, which took place somewhat about\r\n  1811.--_Professor Mohl._\r\n\r\n\r\nNICETY REQUIRED IN ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the _Edinburgh Review_, 1850, we find the following illustrations of\r\nthe enormous propagation of minute errors:\r\n\r\n  The rod used in measuring a base-line is commonly about ten\r\n  feet long; and the astronomer may be said truly to apply that\r\n  very rod to mete the distance of the stars. An error in placing\r\n  a fine dot which fixes the length of the rod, amounting to\r\n  one-five-thousandth of an inch (the thickness of a single silken\r\n  fibre), will amount to an error of 70 feet in the earth’s diameter,\r\n  of 316 miles in the sun’s distance, and to 65,200,000 miles in\r\n  that of the nearest fixed star. Secondly, as the astronomer in his\r\n  observatory has nothing further to do with ascertaining lengths or\r\n  distances, except by calculation, his whole skill and artifice are\r\n  exhausted in the measurement of angles; for by these alone spaces\r\n  inaccessible can be compared. Happily, a ray of light is straight:\r\n  were it not so (in celestial spaces at least), there would be an\r\n  end of our astronomy. Now an angle of a second (3600 to a degree)\r\n  is a subtle thing. It has an apparent breadth utterly invisible to\r\n  the unassisted eye, unless accompanied with so intense a splendour\r\n  (_e. g._ in the case of a fixed star) as actually to raise by its\r\n  effect on the nerve of sight a spurious image having a sensible\r\n  breadth. A silkworm’s fibre, such as we have mentioned above,\r\n  subtends an angle of a second at 3½ feet distance; a cricket-ball,\r\n  2½ inches diameter, must be removed, in order to subtend a second,\r\n  to 43,000 feet, or about 8 miles, where it would be utterly\r\n  invisible to the sharpest sight aided even by a telescope of some\r\n  power. Yet it is on the measure of one single second that the\r\n  ascertainment of a sensible parallax in any fixed star depends;\r\n  and an error of one-thousandth of that amount (a quantity still\r\n  unmeasurable by the most perfect of our instruments) would place\r\n  the star too far or too near by 200,000,000,000 miles; a space\r\n  which light requires 118 days to travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN STARS BE SEEN BY DAYLIGHT?\r\n\r\nAristotle maintains that Stars may occasionally be seen in the\r\nDaylight, from caverns and cisterns, as through tubes. Pliny alludes\r\nto the same circumstance, and mentions that stars have been most\r\ndistinctly recognised during solar eclipses. Sir John Herschel has\r\nheard it stated by a celebrated optician, that his attention was first\r\ndrawn to astronomy by the regular appearance, at a certain hour, for\r\nseveral successive days, of a considerable star through the shaft of\r\na chimney. The chimney-sweepers who have been questioned upon this\r\nsubject agree tolerably well in stating that “they have never seen\r\nstars by day, but that when observed at night through deep shafts,\r\nthe sky appeared quite near, and the stars larger.” Saussure states\r\nthat stars have been seen with the naked eye in broad daylight, on\r\nthe declivity of Mont Blanc, at an elevation of 12,757 feet, as he\r\nwas assured by several of the alpine guides. The observer must be\r\nplaced entirely in the shade, and have a thick and massive shade above\r\nhis head, else the stronger light of the air will disperse the faint\r\nimage of the stars; these conditions resembling those presented by the\r\ncisterns of the ancients, and the chimneys above referred to. Humboldt,\r\nhowever, questions the accuracy of these evidences, adding that in the\r\nCordilleras of Mexico, Quito, and Peru, at elevations of 15,000 or\r\n16,000 feet above the sea-level, he never could distinguish stars by\r\ndaylight. Yet, under the ethereally pure sky of Cumana, in the plains\r\nnear the sea-shore, Humboldt has frequently been able, after observing\r\nan eclipse of Jupiter’s satellites, to find the planet again with the\r\nnaked eye, and has most distinctly seen it when the sun’s disc was from\r\n18° to 20° above the horizon.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOST HEAT OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nBy the nature of our atmosphere, we are protected from the influence\r\nof the full flood of solar heat. The absorption of caloric by the air\r\nhas been calculated at about one-fifth of the whole in passing through\r\na column of 6000 feet, estimated near the earth’s surface. And we are\r\nenabled, knowing the increasing rarity of the upper regions of our\r\ngaseous envelope, in which the absorption is constantly diminishing,\r\nto prove that _about one-third of the solar heat is lost_ by vertical\r\ntransmission through the whole extent of our atmosphere.--_J. D.\r\nForbes, F.R.S._; _Bakerian Lecture_, 1842.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON MONUMENT USED AS AN OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nSoon after the completion of the Monument on Fish Street Hill, by Wren,\r\nin 1677, it was used by Hooke and other members of the Royal Society\r\nfor astronomical purposes, but abandoned on account of the vibrations\r\nbeing too great for the nicety required in their observations. Hence\r\narose _the report that the Monument was unsafe_, which has been revived\r\nin our time; “but,” says Elmes, “its scientific construction may bid\r\ndefiance to the attacks of all but earthquakes for centuries to come.”\r\nThis vibration in lofty columns is not uncommon. Captain Smythe, in his\r\n_Cycle of Celestial Objects_, tells us, that when taking observations\r\non the summit of Pompey’s Pillar, near Alexandria, the mercury was\r\nsensibly affected by tremor, although the pillar is a solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology and Paleontology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTITY OF ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nWhile the Astronomer is studying the form and condition and structure\r\nof the planets, in so far as the eye and the telescope can aid him, the\r\nGeologist is investigating the form and condition and structure of the\r\nplanet to which he belongs; and it is from the analogy of the earth’s\r\nstructure, as thus ascertained, that the astronomer is enabled to form\r\nany rational conjecture respecting the nature and constitution of the\r\nother planetary bodies. Astronomy and Geology, therefore, constitute\r\nthe same science--the science of material or inorganic nature.\r\n\r\nWhen the astronomer first surveys the _concavity_ of the celestial\r\nvault, he finds it studded with luminous bodies differing in magnitude\r\nand lustre, some moving to the east and others to the west; while by\r\nfar the greater number seem fixed in space; and it is the business of\r\nastronomers to assign to each of them its proper place and sphere, to\r\ndetermine their true distance from the earth, and to arrange them in\r\nsystems throughout the regions of sidereal space.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, when the geologist surveys the _convexity_ of his\r\nown globe, he finds its solid covering composed of rocks and beds of\r\nall shapes and kinds, lying at every possible angle, occupying every\r\npossible position, and all of them, generally speaking, at the same\r\ndistance from the earth’s centre. Every where we see what was deep\r\nbrought into visible relation with what was superficial--what is old\r\nwith what is new--what preceded life with what followed it.\r\n\r\nThus displayed on the surface of his globe, it becomes the business\r\nof the geologist to ascertain how these rocks came into their present\r\nplaces, to determine their different ages, and to fix the positions\r\nwhich they originally occupied, and consequently their different\r\ndistances from the centre or the circumference of the earth. Raised\r\nfrom their original bed, the geologist must study the internal forces\r\nby which they were upheaved, and the agencies by which they were\r\nindurated; and when he finds that strata of every kind, from the\r\nprimitive granite to the recent tertiary marine mud, have been thus\r\nbrought within his reach, and prepared for his analysis, he reads their\r\nrespective ages in the organic remains which they entomb; he studies\r\nthe manner in which they have perished, and he counts the cycles of\r\ntime and of life which they disclose.--_Abridged from the North-British\r\nReview_, No. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGY OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\nis more interesting than that of other countries, because our island\r\nis in a great measure an epitome of the globe; and the observer who is\r\nfamiliar with our strata, and the fossil remains which they include,\r\nhas not only prepared himself for similar inquiries in other countries,\r\nbut is already, as it were, by anticipation, acquainted with what he is\r\nto find there.--_Transactions of the Geological Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABLE ORIGIN OF THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.\r\n\r\nThe proposed construction of a submarine tunnel across the Straits\r\nof Dover has led M. Boué, For. Mem. Geol. Soc., to point out the\r\nprobability that the English Channel has not been excavated by\r\nwater-action only; but owes its origin to one of the lines of\r\ndisturbance which have fissured this portion of the earth’s crust:\r\nand taking this view of the case, the fissure probably still exists,\r\nbeing merely filled with comparatively loose material, so as to prove\r\na serious obstacle to any attempt made to drive through it a submarine\r\ntunnel.--_Proceedings of the Geological Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW BOULDERS ARE TRANSPORTED TO GREAT HEIGHTS.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Murchison has shown that in Russia, when the Dwina is at\r\nits maximum height, and penetrates into the chinks of its limestone\r\nbanks, when frozen and expanded it causes disruptions of the rock,\r\nthe entanglement of stony fragments in the ice. In remarkable spring\r\nfloods, the stream so expands that in bursting it throws up its icy\r\nfragments to 15 or 20 feet above the stream; and the waters subsiding,\r\nthese lateral ice-heaps melt away, and leave upon the bank the\r\nrifled and angular blocks as evidence of the highest ice-mark. In\r\nLapland, M. Böhtlingk assures us that he has found _large granitic\r\nboulders weighing several tons actually entangled and suspended, like\r\nbirds’-nests, in the branches of pine-trees, at heights of 30 or 40\r\nfeet above the summer level of the stream_![28]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SEA-SHELLS ARE FOUND AT GREAT HEIGHTS.\r\n\r\nThe action of subterranean forces in breaking through and elevating\r\nstrata of sedimentary rocks,--of which the coast of Chili, in\r\nconsequence of a great earthquake, furnishes an example,--leads to the\r\nassumption that the pelagic shells found by MM. Bonpland and Humboldt\r\non the ridge of the Andes, at an elevation of more than 15,000 English\r\nfeet, may have been conveyed to so extraordinary a position, not by a\r\nrising of the ocean, but by the agency of volcanic forces capable of\r\nelevating into ridges the softened crust of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAND OF THE SEA AND DESERT.\r\n\r\nThat sand is an assemblage of small stones may be seen with the eye\r\nunarmed with art; yet how few are equally aware of the synonymous\r\nnature of the sand of the sea and of the land! Quartz, in the form of\r\nsand, covers almost entirely the bottom of the sea. It is spread over\r\nthe banks of rivers, and forms vast plains, even at a very considerable\r\nelevation above the level of the sea, as the desert of Sahara in\r\nAfrica, of Kobi in Asia, and many others. This quartz is produced, at\r\nleast in part, from the disintegration of the primitive granite rocks.\r\nThe currents of water carry it along, and when it is in very small,\r\nlight, and rounded grains, even the wind transports it from one place\r\nto another. The hills are thus made to move like waves, and a deluge of\r\nsand frequently inundates the neighbouring countries:\r\n\r\n    “So where o’er wide Numidian wastes extend,\r\n    Sudden the impetuous hurricanes descend.”--_Addison’s Cato._\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the trite axiom, that nothing is lost, let us glance at\r\nthe most important use of sand:\r\n\r\n  “Quartz in the form of sand,” observes Maltebrun, “furnishes, by\r\n  fusion, one of the most useful substances we have, namely glass,\r\n  which, being less hard than the crystals of quartz, can be made\r\n  equally transparent, and is equally serviceable to our wants and\r\n  to our pleasures. There it shines in walls of crystal in the\r\n  palaces of the great, reflecting the charms of a hundred assembled\r\n  beauties; there, in the hand of the philosopher, it discovers to us\r\n  the worlds that revolve above us in the immensity of space, and the\r\n  no less astonishing wonders that we tread beneath our feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPEBBLES.\r\n\r\nThe various heights and situations at which Pebbles are found have\r\nled to many erroneous conclusions as to the period of changes of the\r\nearth’s surface. All the banks of rivers and lakes, and the shores of\r\nthe sea, are covered with pebbles, rounded by the waves which have\r\nrolled them against each other, and which frequently seem to have\r\nbrought them from a distance. There are also similar masses of pebbles\r\nfound at very great elevations, to which the sea appears never to\r\nhave been able to reach. We find them in the Alps at Valorsina, more\r\nthan 6000 feet above the level of the sea; and on the mountain of Bon\r\nHomme, which is more than 1000 feet higher. There are some places\r\nlittle elevated above the level of the sea, which, like the famous\r\nplain of Crau, in Provence, are entirely paved with pebbles; while in\r\nNorway, near Quedlia, some mountains of considerable magnitude seem to\r\nbe completely formed of them, and in such a manner that the largest\r\npebbles occupy the summit, and their thickness and size diminish as you\r\napproach the base. We may include in the number of these confused and\r\nirregular heaps most of the depositions of matter brought by the river\r\nor sea, and left on the banks, and perhaps even those immense beds of\r\nsand which cover the centre of Asia and Africa. It is this circumstance\r\nwhich renders so uncertain the distinction, which it is nevertheless\r\nnecessary to establish, between alluvial masses created before the\r\ncommencement of history, and those which we see still forming under our\r\nown eyes.\r\n\r\nA charming monograph, entitled “Thoughts on a Pebble,” full of playful\r\nsentiment and graceful fancy, has been written by the amiable Dr.\r\nMantell, the geologist.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF MOUNTAIN-CHAINS.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ansted, in his _Ancient World_, thus characterises this\r\nphenomenon:\r\n\r\n  These movements, described in a few words, were doubtless going\r\n  on for many thousands and tens of thousands of revolutions of our\r\n  planet. They were accompanied also by vast but slow changes of\r\n  other kinds. The expansive force employed in lifting up, by mighty\r\n  movements, the northern portion of the continent of Asia, found\r\n  partial vent; and from partial subaqueous fissures there were\r\n  poured out the tabular masses of basalt occurring in Central India;\r\n  while an extensive area of depression in the Indian Ocean, marked\r\n  by the coral islands of the Laccadives, the Maldives, the great\r\n  Chagos bank, and some others, were in the course of depression by a\r\n  counteracting movement.\r\n\r\nHitherto the processes of denudation and of elevation have been so\r\nfar balanced as to preserve a pretty steady proportion of sea and dry\r\nland during geological ages; but if the internal temperature should\r\nbe so far reduced as to be no longer capable of generating forces of\r\nexpansion sufficient for this elevatory action, while the denuding\r\nforces should continue to act with unabated energy, the inevitable\r\nresult would be, that every mountain-top would be in time brought low.\r\nNo earthly barrier could declare to the ocean that there its proud\r\nwaves should be stayed. Nothing would stop its ravages till all dry\r\nland should be laid prostrate, to form the bed over which it would\r\ncontinue to roll an uninterrupted sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHALK FORMATION.\r\n\r\nMr. Horner, F.R.S., among other things in his researches in the Delta,\r\nconsiders it extremely probable that every particle of Chalk in the\r\nworld has at some period been circulating in the system of a living\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAR OF BUILDING-STONES.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry, in an account of testing the marbles used in building\r\nthe Capitol at Washington, states that every flash of lightning\r\nproduces an appreciable amount of nitric acid, which, diffused in\r\nrain-water, acts on the carbonate of lime; and from specimens subjected\r\nto actual freezing, it was found that in ten thousand years one inch\r\nwould be worn from the blocks by the action of frost.\r\n\r\n  In 1839, a report of the examination of Sandstones, Limestones,\r\n  and Oolites of Britain was made to the Government, with a view to\r\n  the selection of the best material for building the new Houses\r\n  of Parliament. For this purpose, 103 quarries were described, 96\r\n  buildings in England referred to, many chemical analyses of the\r\n  stones were given, and a great number of experiments related,\r\n  showing, among other points, the cohesive power of each stone,\r\n  and the amount of disintegration apparent, when subjected to\r\n  Brard’s process. The magnesian limestone, or dolomite of Bolsover\r\n  Moor, was recommended, and finally adopted for the Houses; but\r\n  the selection does not appear to have been so successful as might\r\n  have been expected from the skill and labour of the investigation.\r\n  It may be interesting to add, that the publication of the above\r\n  Report (for which see _Year-Book of Facts_, 1840, pp. 78-80)\r\n  occasioned Mr. John Mallcott to remark in the _Times_ journal,\r\n  “that all stone made use of in the immediate neighbourhood of its\r\n  own quarries is more likely to endure that atmosphere than if it\r\n  be removed therefrom, though only thirty or forty miles:” and the\r\n  lapse of comparatively few years has proved the soundness of this\r\n  observation.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF GLACIERS ILLUSTRATED.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall, being desirous of investigating some of the\r\nphenomena presented by the large masses of mountain-ice,--those frozen\r\nrivers called Glaciers,--devised the plan of sending a destructive\r\nagent into the midst of a mass of ice, so as to break down its\r\nstructure in the interior, in order to see if this method would reveal\r\nany thing of its internal constitution. Taking advantage of the bright\r\nweather of 1857, he concentrated a beam of sunlight by a condensing\r\nlens, so as to form the focus of the sun’s rays in the midst of a mass\r\nof ice. A portion of the ice was melted, but the surrounding parts\r\nshone out as brilliant stars, produced by the reflection of the faces\r\nof the crystalline structure. On examining these brilliant portions\r\nwith a lens, Professor Tyndall discovered that the structure of the ice\r\nhad been broken down in symmetrical forms of great beauty, presenting\r\nminute stars, surrounded by six petals, forming a beautiful flower, the\r\nplane being always parallel to the plane of congelation of the ice.\r\nHe then prepared a piece of ice, by making both its surfaces smooth\r\nand parallel to each other. He concentrated in the centre of the ice\r\nthe rays of heat from the electric light; and then, placing the piece\r\nof ice in the electric microscope, the disc revealed these beautiful\r\nice-flowers.\r\n\r\nA mass of ice was crushed into fragments; the small fragments were then\r\nplaced in a cup of wood; a hollow wooden die, somewhat smaller than the\r\ncup, was then pressed into the cup of ice-fragments by the pressure of\r\na hydraulic press, and the ice-fragments were immediately united into\r\na compact cup of nearly transparent ice. This pressure of fragments\r\nof ice into a solid mass explains the formation of the glaciers and\r\ntheir origin. They are composed of particles of ice or snow; as they\r\ndescend the sides of the mountain, the pressure of the snow becomes\r\nsufficiently great to compress the mass into solid ice, until it\r\nbecomes so great as to form the beautiful blue ice of the glaciers.\r\nThis compression, however, will not form the solid mass unless the\r\ntemperature of the ice be near that of freezing water. To prove this,\r\nthe lecturer cooled a mass of ice, by wrapping it in a piece of tinfoil\r\nand exposing it for some time to a bath of the ethereal solution of\r\nsolidified carbonic-acid gas, the coldest freezing mixture known. This\r\ncooled mass of ice was crushed to fragments, and submitted to the same\r\npressure which the other fragments had been exposed to without cohering\r\nin the slightest degree.--_Lecture at the Royal Institution_, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIQUITY OF GLACIERS.\r\n\r\nThe importance of glacier agency in the past as well as the present\r\ncondition of the earth, is undoubtedly very great. One of our most\r\naccomplished and ingenious geologists has, indeed, carried back the\r\nexistence of Glaciers to an epoch of dim antiquity, even in the\r\nreckoning of that science whose chronology is counted in millions of\r\nyears. Professor Ramsay has shown ground for believing that in the\r\nfragments of rock that go to make up the conglomerates of the Permian\r\nstrata, intermediate between the Old and the New Red Sandstone, there\r\nis still preserved a record of the action of ice, either in glaciers\r\nor floating icebergs, before those strata were consolidated.--_Saturday\r\nReview_, No. 142.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOW OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\nMichel Devouasson of Chamouni fell into a crevasse on the Glacier\r\nof Talefre, a feeder of the Mer de Glace, on the 29th of July 1836,\r\nand after a severe struggle extricated himself, leaving his knapsack\r\nbelow. The identical knapsack reappeared in July 1846, at a spot on\r\nthe surface of the glacier _four thousand three hundred_ feet from\r\nthe place where it was lost, as ascertained by Professor Forbes, who\r\nhimself collected the fragments; thus indicating the rate of flow of\r\nthe icy river in the intervening ten years.--_Quarterly Review_, No.\r\n202.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALLUVIAL LAND OF EGYPT: ANCIENT POTTERY.\r\n\r\nMr. L. Horner, in his recent researches near Cairo, with the view of\r\nthrowing light upon the geological history of the alluvial land of\r\nEgypt, obtained from the lowest part of the boring of the sediment at\r\nthe colossal statue of Rameses, at a depth of thirty-nine feet, this\r\ncurious relic of the ancient world; the boring instrument bringing up\r\na fragment of pottery about an inch square and a quarter of an inch in\r\nthickness--the two surfaces being of a brick-red colour, the interior\r\ndark gray. According to Mr. Horner’s deductions, this fragment, having\r\nbeen found at a depth of 39 feet (if there be no fallacy in his\r\nreasoning), must be held to be a record of the existence of man 13,375\r\nyears before A.D. 1858, reckoning by the calculated rate of increase of\r\nthree inches and a half of alluvium in a century--11,517 years before\r\nthe Christian era, and 7625 before the beginning assigned by Lepsius\r\nto the reign of Menos, the founder of Memphis. Moreover it proves in\r\nhis opinion, that man had already reached a state of civilisation, so\r\nfar at least as to be able to fashion clay into vessels, and to know\r\nhow to harden it by the action of strong heat. This calculation is\r\nsupported by the Chevalier Bunsen, who is of opinion that the first\r\nepochs of the history of the human race demand at the least a period\r\nof 20,000 years before our era as a fair starting-point in the earth’s\r\nhistory.--_Proceedings of Royal Soc._, 1858.\r\n\r\n  Upon this theory, a Correspondent, “An Old Indigo-Planter,” writes\r\n  to the _Athenæum_, No. 1509, the following suggestive note: “Having\r\n  lived many years on the banks of the Ganges, I have seen the stream\r\n  encroach on a village, undermining the bank where it stood, and\r\n  deposit, as a natural result, bricks, pottery, &c. in the bottom\r\n  of the stream. On one occasion, I am certain that the depth of\r\n  the stream where the bank was breaking was above 40 feet; yet in\r\n  three years the current of the river drifted so much, that a fresh\r\n  deposit of soil took place over the _débris_ of the village, and\r\n  the earth was raised to a level with the old bank. Now had our\r\n  traveller then obtained a bit of pottery from where it had lain for\r\n  only three years, could he reasonably draw the inference that it\r\n  had been made 13,000 years before?”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSIVE CHANGES OF THE TEMPLE OF SERAPIS.\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Serapis at Puzzuoli, near Naples, is perhaps, of all\r\nthe structures raised by the hands of man, the one which affords most\r\ninstruction to a geologist. It has not only undergone a wonderful\r\nsuccession of changes in past time, but is still undergoing changes\r\nof condition. This edifice was exhumed in 1750 from the eastern shore\r\nof the Bay of Baiæ, consisting partly of strata containing marine\r\nshells with fragments of pottery and sculpture, and partly of volcanic\r\nmatter of sub-aerial origin. Various theories were proposed in the\r\nlast century to explain the perforations and attached animals observed\r\non the middle zone of the three erect marble columns until recently\r\nstanding; Goethe, among the rest, suggesting that a lagoon had once\r\nexisted in the vestibule of the temple, filled during a temporary\r\nincursion of the sea with salt water, and that marine mollusca and\r\nannelids flourished for years in this lagoon at twelve feet or more\r\nabove the sea-level.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis was advanced at a time when almost any amount of\r\nfluctuation in the level of the sea was thought more probable than\r\nthe slightest alteration in the level of the solid land. In 1807 the\r\narchitect Niccolini observed that the pavement of the temple was dry,\r\nexcept when a violent south wind was blowing; whereas, on revisiting\r\nthe temple fifteen years later, he found the pavement covered by salt\r\nwater twice every day at high tide. From measurements made from 1822\r\nto 1838, and thence to 1845, he inferred that the sea was gaining\r\nannually upon the floor of the temple at the rate of about one-third\r\nof an inch during the first period, and about three-fourths of an inch\r\nduring the second. Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, from his visits in 1819\r\nand 1845, found an average rise of about an inch annually, which was\r\nin accordance with visits made by Mr. Babbage in 1828, and Professor\r\nJames Forbes in 1826 and 1843. In 1852 Signor Scaecchi, at the request\r\nof Sir Charles Lyell, compared the depth of water on the pavement with\r\nits level taken by him in 1839, and found that it had gained only 4½\r\ninches in thirteen years, and was not so deep as when MM. Niccolini\r\nand Smith measured it in 1845; from which he inferred that after 1845\r\nthe downward movement of the land had ceased, and before 1852 had been\r\nconverted into an upward movement.\r\n\r\nArago and others maintained that the surface on which the temple\r\nstands has been depressed, has _remained under the sea, and has again\r\nbeen elevated_. Russager, however, contends that there is nothing in\r\nthe vicinity of the temple, or in the temple itself, to justify this\r\nbold hypothesis. Every thing leads to the belief that the temple has\r\nremained unchanged in the position in which it was originally built;\r\nbut that the sea rose, surrounded it to a height of at least twelve\r\nfeet, and again retired; but the elevated position of the sea continued\r\nsufficiently long to admit of the animals boring the pillars. This view\r\ncan even be proved historically; for Niccolini, in a memoir published\r\nin 1840, gives the heights of the level of the sea in the Bay of\r\nNaples for a period of 1900 years, and has with much acuteness proved\r\nhis assertions historically. The correctness of Russager’s opinion,\r\nhe states, can be demonstrated and reduced to figures by means of the\r\ndates collected by Niccolini.--See _Jameson’s Journal_, No. 58.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the floor is always covered with sea-water. On the\r\nwhole, there is little doubt that the ground has sunk upwards of two\r\nfeet during the last half-century. This gradual subsidence confirms\r\nin a remarkable manner Mr. Babbage’s conclusions--drawn from the\r\ncalcareous incrustations formed by the hot springs on the walls of the\r\nbuilding and from the ancient lines of the water-level at the base of\r\nthe three columns--that the original subsidence was not sudden, but\r\nslow and by successive movements.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell (who, in his _Principles of Geology_, has given a\r\ndetailed account of the several upfillings of the temple) considers\r\nthat when the mosaic pavement was re-constructed, the floor of the\r\nbuilding must have stood about twelve feet above the level of 1838 (or\r\nabout 11½ feet above the level of the sea), and that it had sunk about\r\nnineteen feet below that level before it was elevated by the eruption\r\nof Monte Nuovo.\r\n\r\nWe regret to add, that the columns of the temple are no longer in\r\nthe position in which they served so many years as a species of\r\nself-registering hydrometer: the materials have been newly arranged,\r\nand thus has been torn as it were from history a page which can never\r\nbe replaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROTTO DEL CANE.\r\n\r\nThis “Dog Grotto” has been so much cited for its stratum of\r\ncarbonic-acid gas covering the floor, that all geological travellers\r\nwho visit Naples feel an interest in seeing the wonder.\r\n\r\nThis cavern was known to Pliny. It is continually exhaling from its\r\nsides and floor volumes of steam mixed with carbonic-acid gas; but the\r\nlatter, from its greater specific gravity, accumulates at the bottom,\r\nand flows over the step of the door. The upper part of the cave,\r\ntherefore, is free from the gas, while the floor is completely covered\r\nby it. Addison, on his visit, made some interesting experiments. He\r\nfound that a pistol could not be fired at the bottom; and that on\r\nlaying a train of gunpowder and igniting it on the outside of the\r\ncavern, the carbonic-acid gas “could not intercept the train of fire\r\nwhen it once began flashing, nor hinder it from running to the very\r\nend.” He found that a viper was nine minutes in dying on the first\r\ntrial, and ten minutes on the second; this increased vitality being,\r\nin his opinion, attributable to the stock of air which it had inhaled\r\nafter the first trial. Dr. Daubeny found that phosphorus would continue\r\nlighted at about two feet above the bottom; that a sulphur-match went\r\nout in a few minutes above it, and a wax-taper at a still higher level.\r\nThe keeper of the cavern has a dog, upon which he shows the effects of\r\nthe gas, which, however, are quite as well, if not better, seen in a\r\ntorch, a lighted candle, or a pistol.\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately,” says Professor Silliman, “like some other grottoes,\r\nthe enchantment of the ‘Dog Grotto’ disappears on a near view.” It is a\r\nlittle hole dug artificially in the side of a hill facing Lake Agnano:\r\nit is scarcely high enough for a person to stand upright in, and the\r\naperture is closed by a door. Into this narrow cell a poor little dog\r\nis very unwillingly dragged and placed in a depression of the floor,\r\nwhere he is soon narcotised by the carbonic acid. The earth is warm to\r\nthe hand, and the gas given out is very constant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATERS OF THE GLOBE GRADUALLY DECREASING.\r\n\r\nThis was maintained by M. Bory Saint Vincent, because the vast deserts\r\nof sand, mixed up with the salt and remains of marine animals, of which\r\nthe surface of the globe is partly composed, were formerly inland seas,\r\nwhich have insensibly become dry. The Caspian, the Dead Sea, the Lake\r\nBaikal, &c. will become dry in their turn also, when their beds will\r\nbe sandy deserts. The inland seas, whether they have only one outlet,\r\nas the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Baltic, &c., or whether they\r\nhave several, as the Gulf of Mexico, the seas of O’Kotsk, of Japan,\r\nChina, &c., will at some future time cease to communicate with the\r\ngreat basins of the ocean; they will become inland seas, true Caspians,\r\nand in due time will become likewise dry. On all sides the waters\r\nof rivers are seen to carry forward in their course the soil of the\r\ncontinent. Alluvial lands, deltas, banks of sand, form themselves near\r\nthe coasts, and in the directions of the currents; madreporic animals\r\nlay the foundations of new lands; and while the straits become closed,\r\nwhile the depths of the sea fill up, the level of the sea, which it\r\nwould seem natural should become higher, is sensibly lower. There is,\r\ntherefore, an actual diminution of liquid matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALT LAKE OF UTAH.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gunnison, who has surveyed the great basin of the Salt\r\nLake, states the water to be about one-third salt, which it yields\r\non boiling. Its density is considerably greater than that of the Red\r\nSea. One can hardly get the whole body below the surface: in a sitting\r\nposition the head and shoulders will remain above the water, such is\r\nthe strength of the brine; and on coming to the shore the body is\r\ncovered with an incrustation of salt in fine crystals. During summer\r\nthe lake throws on shore abundance of salt, while in winter it throws\r\nup Glauber salt plentifully. “The reason of this,” says Lieutenant\r\nGunnison, “is left for the scientific to judge, and also what becomes\r\nof the enormous amount of fresh water poured into it by three or four\r\nlarge rivers,--Jordan, Bear, and Weber,--as there is no visible effect.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCE OF RUNNING WATER.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by experiment that the rapidity at the bottom\r\nof a stream is every where less than in any other part of it, and\r\nis greatest at the surface. Also, that in the middle of the stream\r\nthe particles at the top move swifter than those at the sides. This\r\nslowness of the lowest and side currents is produced by friction; and\r\nwhen the rapidity is sufficiently great, the soil composing the sides\r\nand bottom gives way. If the water flows at the rate of three inches\r\nper second, it will tear up fine clay; six inches per second, fine\r\nsand; twelve inches per second, fine gravel; and three feet per second,\r\nstones the size of an egg.--_Sir Charles Lyell._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTESIAN WELL OF GRENELLE AT PARIS.\r\n\r\nM. Peligot has ascertained that the Water of the Artesian Well of\r\nGrenelle contains not the least trace of air. Subterranean waters ought\r\ntherefore to be _aerated_ before being used as aliment. Accordingly, at\r\nGrenelle, has been constructed a tower, from the top of which the water\r\ndescends in innumerable threads, so as to present as much surface as\r\npossible to the air.\r\n\r\nThe boring of this Well by the Messrs. Mulot occupied seven years, one\r\nmonth, twenty-six days, to the depth of 1794½ English feet, or 194½\r\nfeet below the depth at which M. Elie de Beaumont foretold that water\r\nwould be found. The sound, or borer, weighed 20,000 lb., and was treble\r\nthe height of that of the dome of the Hôpital des Invalides at Paris.\r\nIn May 1837, when the bore had reached 1246 feet 8 inches, the great\r\nchisel and 262 feet of rods fell to the bottom; and although these\r\nweighed five tons, M. Mulot tapped a screw on the head of the rods, and\r\nthus, connecting another length to them, after fifteen months’ labour,\r\ndrew up the chisel. On another occasion, this chisel having been raised\r\nwith great force, sank at one stroke 85 feet 3 inches into the chalk!\r\n\r\n  The depth of the Grenelle Well is nearly four times the height of\r\n  Strasburg Cathedral; more than six times the height of the Hôpital\r\n  des Invalides at Paris; more than four times the height of St.\r\n  Peter’s at Rome; nearly four times and a half the height of St.\r\n  Paul’s, and nine times the height of the Monument, London. Lastly,\r\n  suppose all the above edifices to be piled one upon each other,\r\n  from the base-line of the Well of Grenelle, and they would but\r\n  reach within 11½ feet of its surface.\r\n\r\n  MM. Elie de Beaumont and Arago never for a moment doubted the final\r\n  success of the work; their confidence being based on analogy, and\r\n  on a complete acquaintance with the geological structure of the\r\n  Paris basin, which is identical with that of the London basin\r\n  beneath the London clay.\r\n\r\n  In the duchy of Luxembourg is a well the depth of which surpasses\r\n  all others of the kind. It is upwards of 1000 feet more than that\r\n  of Grenelle near Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE GULF-STREAM REGULATES THE TEMPERATURE OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is almost exactly under the same latitude as Labrador, a\r\nregion of ice and snow. Apparently, the chief cause of the remarkable\r\ndifference between the two climates arises from the action of the great\r\noceanic Gulf-Stream, whereby this country is kept constantly encircled\r\nwith waters warmed by a West-Indian sun.\r\n\r\n  Were it not for this unceasing current from tropical seas, London,\r\n  instead of its present moderate average winter temperature of\r\n  6° above the freezing-point, might for many months annually be\r\n  ice-bound by a settled cold of 10° to 30° below that point, and\r\n  have its pleasant summer months replaced by a season so short\r\n  as not to allow corn to ripen, or only an alpine vegetation to\r\n  flourish.\r\n\r\n  Nor are we without evidence afforded by animal life of a greater\r\n  cold having prevailed in this country at a late geological period.\r\n  One case in particular occurs within eighty miles of London, at the\r\n  village of Chillesford, near Woodbridge, where, in a bed of clayey\r\n  sand of an age but little (geologically speaking) anterior to the\r\n  London gravel, Mr. Prestwich has found a group of fossil shells\r\n  in greater part identical with species now living in the seas of\r\n  Greenland and of similar latitudes, and which must evidently, from\r\n  their perfect condition and natural position, have existed in the\r\n  place where they are now met with.--_Lectures on the Geology of\r\n  Clapham, &c. by Joseph Prestwich, A.R.S., F.G.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLVENT ACTION OF COMMON SALT AT HIGH TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\nForchhammer, after a long series of experiments, has come to the\r\nconclusion that Common Salt at high temperatures, such as prevailed at\r\nearlier periods of the earth’s history, acted as a general solvent,\r\nsimilarly to water at common temperatures. The amount of common salt\r\nin the earth would suffice to cover its whole surface with a crust ten\r\nfeet in thickness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING CAVERN IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nThis famous Cavern, at Ithetz Kaya-Zastchita, in the Steppes of the\r\nKirghis, is employed by the inhabitants as a cellar. It has the very\r\nremarkable property of being so intensely cold during the hottest\r\nsummers as to be then filled with ice, which disappearing with cold\r\nweather, is entirely gone in winter, when all the country is clad\r\nin snow. The roof is hung with ever-dripping solid icicles, and the\r\nfloor may be called a stalagmite of ice and frozen earth. “If,” says\r\nSir R. Murchison, “as we were assured, _the cold is greatest when the\r\nexternal air is hottest and driest_, that the fall of rain and a moist\r\natmosphere produce some diminution of the cold in the cave, and that\r\nupon the setting-in of winter the ice disappears entirely,--then indeed\r\nthe problem is very curious.” The peasants assert that in winter they\r\ncould sleep in the cave without their sheepskins.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERIOR TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH: CENTRAL HEAT.\r\n\r\nBy the observed temperature of mines, and that at the bottom of\r\nartesian wells, it has been established that the rate at which such\r\ntemperature increases as we descend varies considerably in different\r\nlocalities, where the depths are comparatively small; but where the\r\ndepths are great, we find a much nearer approximation to a common\r\nrate of increase, which, as determined by the best observation in the\r\ndeepest mines, shafts, and artesian wells in Western Europe, is very\r\nnearly 1° F. _for an increase in depth of fifty feet_.--_W. Hopkins,\r\nM.A., F.R.S._\r\n\r\nHumboldt states that, according to tolerably coincident experiments in\r\nartesian wells, it has been shown that the heat increases on an average\r\nabout 1° for every 54·5 feet. If this increase can be reduced to\r\narithmetical relations, it will follow that a stratum of granite would\r\nbe in a state of fusion at a depth of nearly twenty-one geographical\r\nmiles, or between four and five times the elevation of the highest\r\nsummit of the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nThe following is the opinion of Professor Silliman:\r\n\r\n  That the whole interior portion of the earth, or at least a great\r\n  part of it, is an ocean of melted rock, agitated by violent winds,\r\n  though I dare not affirm it, is still rendered highly probable by\r\n  the phenomena of volcanoes. The facts connected with their eruption\r\n  have been ascertained and placed beyond a doubt. How, then, are\r\n  they to be accounted for? The theory prevalent some years since,\r\n  that they are caused by the combustion of immense coal-beds, is\r\n  puerile and now entirely abandoned. All the coal in the world could\r\n  not afford fuel enough for one of the tremendous eruptions of\r\n  Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nThis observed increase of temperature in descending beneath the earth’s\r\nsurface suggested the notion of a central incandescent nucleus still\r\nremaining in a state of fluidity from its elevated temperature. Hence\r\nthe theory that the whole mass of the earth was formerly a molten\r\nfluid mass, the exterior portion of which, to some unknown depth, has\r\nassumed its present solidity by the radiation of heat into surrounding\r\nspace, and its consequent refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical solution of this problem of Central Heat, assuming\r\nsuch heat to exist, tells us that though the central portion of the\r\nearth may consist of a mass of molten matter, the temperature of its\r\nsurface is not thereby increased by more than the small fraction of\r\na degree. Poisson has calculated that it would require _a thousand\r\nmillions of centuries_ to reduce this fraction to a degree by half its\r\npresent amount, supposing always the external conditions to remain\r\nunaltered. In such cases, the superficial temperature of the earth may,\r\nin fact, be considered to have approximated so near to its ultimate\r\nlimit that it can be subject to no further sensible change.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISAPPEARANCE OF VOLCANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nMany of the Volcanic Islands thrown up above the sea-level soon\r\ndisappear, because the lavas and conglomerates of which they are formed\r\nspread over flatter surfaces, through the weight of the incumbent\r\nfluid; and the constant levelling process goes on below the sea by the\r\naction of tides and currents. Such islands as have effectually resisted\r\nthis action are found to possess a solid framework of lava, supporting\r\nor defending the loose fragmentary materials.\r\n\r\n  Among the most celebrated of these phenomena in our times may be\r\n  mentioned the Isle of Sabrina, which rose off the coast of St.\r\n  Michael’s in 1811, attained a circumference of one mile and a\r\n  height of 300 feet, and disappeared in less than eight months; in\r\n  the following year there were eighty fathoms of water in its place.\r\n  In July 1831 appeared Graham’s Island off the coast of Sicily,\r\n  which attained a mile in circumference and 150 or 160 feet in\r\n  height; its formation much resembled that of Sabrina.\r\n\r\nThe line of ancient subterranean fire which we trace on the\r\nMediterranean coasts has had a strange attestation in Graham’s Island,\r\nwhich is also described as a volcano suddenly bursting forth in the mid\r\nsea between Sicily and Africa; burning for several weeks, and throwing\r\nup an isle, or crater-cone of scoriæ and ashes, which had scarcely been\r\nnamed before it was again lost by subsidence beneath the sea, leaving\r\nonly a shoal-bank to attest this strange submarine breach in the\r\nearth’s crust, which thus mingled fire and water in one common action.\r\n\r\nFloating islands are not very rare: in 1827, one was seen twenty\r\nleagues to the east of the Azores; it was three leagues in width, and\r\ncovered with volcanic products, sugar-canes, straw, and pieces of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERPETUAL FIRE.\r\n\r\nNot far from the Deliktash, on the side of a mountain in Lycia, is the\r\nPerpetual Fire described some forty years since by Captain Beaufort.\r\nIt was found by Lieutenant Spratt and Professor Forbes, thirty years\r\nlater, as brilliant as ever, and somewhat increased; for besides the\r\nlarge flame in the corner of the ruins described by Beaufort, there\r\nwere small jets issuing from crevices in the side of the crater-like\r\ncavity five or six feet deep. At the bottom was a shallow pool of\r\nsulphureous and turbid water, regarded by the Turks as a sovereign\r\nremedy for all skin complaints. The soot deposited from the flames was\r\nheld to be efficacious for sore eyelids, and valued as a dye for the\r\neyebrows. This phenomenon is described by Pliny as the flame of the\r\nLycian Chimera.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTESIAN FIRE-SPRINGS IN CHINA.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statement of the missionary Imbert, the\r\nFire-Springs, “Ho-tsing” of the Chinese, which are sunk to obtain a\r\ncarburetted-hydrogen gas for salt-boiling, far exceed our artesian\r\nsprings in depth. These springs are very commonly more than 2000 feet\r\ndeep; and a spring of continued flow was found to be 3197 feet deep.\r\nThis natural gas has been used in the Chinese province Tse-tschuan for\r\nseveral thousand years; and “portable gas” (in bamboo-canes) has for\r\nages been used in the city of Khiung-tscheu. More recently, in the\r\nvillage of Fredonia, in the United States, such gas has been used both\r\nfor cooking and for illumination.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ACTION THE GREAT AGENT OF GEOLOGICAL CHANGE.\r\n\r\n  Mr. James Nasmyth observes, that “the floods of molten lava which\r\n  volcanoes eject are nothing less than remaining portions of what\r\n  was once the condition of the entire globe when in the igneous\r\n  state of its early physical history,--no one knows how many years\r\n  ago!\r\n\r\n  “When we behold the glow and feel the heat of molten lava, how\r\n  vastly does it add to the interest of the sight when we consider\r\n  that the heat we feel and the light we see are the residue of the\r\n  once universal condition of our entire globe, on whose _cooled\r\n  surface_ we _now_ live and have our being! But so it is; for if\r\n  there be one great fact which geological research has established\r\n  beyond all doubt, it is that we reside on the cooled surface of\r\n  what was once a molten globe, and that all the phenomena which\r\n  geology has brought to light can be most satisfactorily traced\r\n  to the successive changes incidental to its gradual cooling and\r\n  contraction.\r\n\r\n  “That the influx of the sea into the yet hot and molten interior of\r\n  the globe may occasionally occur, and enhance and vary the violence\r\n  of the phenomenon of volcanic action, there can be little doubt;\r\n  but the action of water in such cases is only _secondary_. But for\r\n  the pre-existing high temperature of the interior of the earth, the\r\n  influx of water would produce no such discharges of molten lava as\r\n  generally characterise volcanic eruptions. Molten lava is therefore\r\n  a true vestige of the Natural History of the Creation.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW-CAPPED VOLCANO.\r\n\r\nIt is but rarely that the elastic forces at work within the interior of\r\nour globe have succeeded in breaking through the spiral domes which,\r\nresplendent in the brightness of eternal snow, crown the summits of the\r\nCordilleras; and even where these subterranean forces have opened a\r\npermanent communication with the atmosphere, through circular craters\r\nor long fissures, they rarely send forth currents of lava, but merely\r\neject ignited scoriæ, steam, sulphuretted hydrogen gas, and jets of\r\ncarbonic acid.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS OF VOLCANIC DUST.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of September 1845, a quantity of Volcanic Dust fell in the\r\nOrkney Islands, which was supposed to have originated in an eruption of\r\nHecla, in Iceland. It was subsequently ascertained that an eruption of\r\nthat volcano took place on the morning of the above day (September 2),\r\nso as to leave no doubt of the accuracy of the conclusion. The dust had\r\nthus travelled about 600 miles!\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT ERUPTIONS OF VESUVIUS.\r\n\r\nIn the great eruption of Vesuvius, in August 1779, which Sir William\r\nHamilton witnessed from his villa at Pausilippo in the bay of Naples,\r\nthe volcano sent up white sulphureous smoke resembling bales of cotton,\r\nexceeding the height and size of the mountain itself at least four\r\ntimes; and in the midst of this vast pile of smoke, stones, scoriæ,\r\nand ashes were thrown up not less than 2000 feet. Next day a fountain\r\nof fire shot up with such height and brilliancy that the smallest\r\nobjects could be clearly distinguished at any place within six miles\r\nor more of Vesuvius. But on the following day a more stupendous column\r\nof fire rose three times the height of Vesuvius (3700 feet), or more\r\nthan two miles high. Among the huge fragments of lava thrown out during\r\nthis eruption was a block 108 feet in circumference and 17 feet high,\r\nanother block 66 feet in circumference and 19 feet high, and another 16\r\nfeet high and 92 feet in circumference, besides thousands of smaller\r\nfragments. Sir William Hamilton suggests that from a scene of the above\r\nkind the ancient poets took their ideas of the giants waging war with\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of June 1794, which destroyed the greater part of the\r\ntown of Torre del Greco, was, however, the most violent that has been\r\nrecorded after the two great eruptions of 79 and 1631.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH-WAVES.\r\n\r\nThe waves of an earthquake have been represented in their progress,\r\nand their propagation, through rocks of different density and\r\nelasticity; and the causes of the rapidity of propagation, and its\r\ndiminution by the refraction, reflection, and interference of the\r\noscillations have been mathematically investigated. Air, water, and\r\nearth waves follow the same laws which are recognised by the theory of\r\nmotion, at all events in space; but the earth-waves are accompanied\r\nin their destructive action by discharges of elastic vapours, and\r\nof gases, and mixtures of pyroxene crystals, carbon, and infusorial\r\nanimalcules with silicious shields. The more terrific effects are,\r\nhowever, when the earth-waves are accompanied by cleavage; and, as in\r\nthe earthquake of Riobamba, when fissures alternately opened and closed\r\nagain, so that men saved themselves by extending both arms, in order to\r\nprevent their sinking.\r\n\r\nAs a remarkable example of the closing of a fissure, Humboldt mentions\r\nthat, during the celebrated earthquake in 1851, in the Neapolitan\r\nprovince of Basilicata, a hen was found caught by both feet in the\r\nstreet-pavement of Barile, near Melfi.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins has very correctly shown theoretically that the fissures\r\nproduced by earthquakes are very instructive as regards the formation\r\nof veins and the phenomenon of dislocation, the more recent vein\r\ndisplacing the older formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMBLINGS OF EARTHQUAKES.\r\n\r\nWhen the great earthquake of Coseguina, in Nicaragua, took place,\r\nJanuary 23, 1835, the subterranean noise--the sonorous waves in the\r\nearth--was heard at the same time on the island of Jamaica and on the\r\nplateau of Bogota, 8740 feet above the sea, at a greater distance than\r\nfrom Algiers to London. In the eruptions of the volcano on the island\r\nof St. Vincent, April 30, 1812, at 2 A.M., a noise like the report of\r\ncannons was heard, without any sensible concussion of the earth, over a\r\nspace of 160,000 geographical square miles. There have also been heard\r\nsubterranean thunderings for two years without earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MEASURE AN EARTHQUAKE-SHOCK.\r\n\r\nA new instrument (the Seismometer) invented for this purpose by\r\nM. Kreil, of Vienna, consists of a pendulum oscillating in every\r\ndirection, but unable to turn round on its point of suspension; and\r\nbearing at its extremity a cylinder, which, by means of mechanism\r\nwithin it, turns on its vertical axis once in twenty-four hours. Next\r\nto the pendulum stands a rod bearing a narrow elastic arm, which\r\nslightly presses the extremity of a lead-pencil against the surface\r\nof the cylinder. As long as the pendulum is quiet, the pencil traces\r\nan uninterrupted line on the surface of the cylinder; but as soon as\r\nit oscillates, this line becomes interrupted and irregular, and these\r\nirregularities indicate the time of the commencement of an earthquake,\r\ntogether with its duration and intensity.[30]\r\n\r\nElastic fluids are doubtless the cause of the slight and perfectly\r\nharmless trembling of the earth’s surface, which has often continued\r\nfor several days. The focus of this destructive agent, the seat of\r\nthe moving force, lies far below the earth’s surface; but we know as\r\nlittle of the extent of this depth as we know of the chemical nature\r\nof these vapours that are so highly compressed. At the edges of two\r\ncraters,--Vesuvius and the towering rock which projects beyond the\r\ngreat abyss of Pichincha, near Quito,--Humboldt has felt periodic\r\nand very regular shocks of earthquakes, on each occasion from twenty\r\nto thirty seconds before the burning scoriæ or gases were erupted.\r\nThe intensity of the shocks was increased in proportion to the time\r\nintervening between them, and consequently to the length of time in\r\nwhich the vapours were accumulating. This simple fact, which has\r\nbeen attested by the evidence of so many travellers, furnishes us\r\nwith a general solution of the phenomenon, in showing that active\r\nvolcanoes are to be considered as safety-valves for the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. There are instances in which the earth has been shaken\r\nfor many successive days in the chain of the Andes, in South America.\r\nIn certain districts, the inhabitants take no more notice of the number\r\nof earthquakes than we in Europe take of showers of rain; yet in such\r\na district Bonpland and Humboldt were compelled to dismount, from the\r\nrestiveness of their mules, because the earth shook in a forest for\r\nfifteen to eighteen minutes _without intermission_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTHQUAKES AND THE MOON.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful discussion of several thousand earthquakes which have\r\nbeen recorded between 1801 and 1850, and a comparison of the periods at\r\nwhich they occurred with the position of the moon in relation to the\r\nearth, M. Perry, of Dijon, infers that earthquakes may possibly be the\r\nresult of attraction exerted by that body on the supposed fluid centre\r\nof our globe, somewhat similar to that which she exercises on the\r\nwaters of the ocean; and the Committee of the Institute of France have\r\nreported favourably upon this theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT EARTHQUAKE OF LISBON.\r\n\r\nThe eloquent Humboldt remarks, that the activity of an igneous\r\nmountain, however terrific and picturesque the spectacle may be which\r\nit presents to our contemplation, is always limited to a very small\r\nspace. It is far otherwise with earthquakes, which, although scarcely\r\nperceptible to the eye, nevertheless simultaneously propagate their\r\nwaves to a distance of many thousand miles. The great earthquake which\r\ndestroyed the city of Lisbon, November 1st, 1755, was felt in the\r\nAlps, on the coast of Sweden, into the Antilles, Antigua, Barbadoes,\r\nand Martinique; in the great Canadian lakes, in Thuringia, in the\r\nflat country of northern Germany, and in the small inland lakes on\r\nthe shores of the Baltic. Remote springs were interrupted in their\r\nflow,--a phenomenon attending earthquakes which had been noticed among\r\nthe ancients by Demetrius the Callatian. The hot springs of Töplitz\r\ndried up and returned, inundating every thing around, and having their\r\nwaters coloured with iron ochre. At Cadiz, the sea rose to an elevation\r\nof sixty-four feet; while in the Antilles, where the tide usually\r\nrises only from twenty-six to twenty-eight inches, it suddenly rose\r\nabout twenty feet, the water being of an inky blackness. It has been\r\ncomputed that, on November 1st, 1755, a portion of the earth’s surface\r\nfour times greater than that of Europe was simultaneously shaken.[31]\r\nAs yet there is no manifestation of force known to us (says the\r\nvivid denunciation of the philosopher), including even the murderous\r\ninvention of our own race, by which a greater number of people have\r\nbeen killed in the short space of a few minutes: 60,000 were destroyed\r\nin Sicily in 1693, from 30,000 to 40,000 in the earthquake of Riobamba\r\nin 1797, and probably five times as many in Asia Minor and Syria under\r\nTiberius and Justinian the elder, about the years 19 and 526.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL AGE OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Diamonds in Russia, far from the tropical zone, has\r\nexcited much interest among geologists. In the detritus on the banks\r\nof the Adolfskoi, no fewer than forty diamonds have been found in the\r\ngold alluvium, only twenty feet above the stratum in which the remains\r\nof mammoths and rhinoceroses are found. Hence Humboldt has concluded\r\nthat the formation of gold-veins, and consequently of diamonds, is\r\ncomparatively of recent date, and scarcely anterior to the destruction\r\nof the mammoths. Sir Roderick Murchison and M. Verneuil have been led\r\nto the same result by different arguments.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT WAS ADAMANT?\r\n\r\nProfessor Tennant replies, that the Adamant described by Pliny was a\r\nsapphire, as proved by its form, and by the fact that when struck on\r\nan anvil by a hammer it would make an indentation in the metal. A true\r\ndiamond, under such circumstances, would fly into a thousand pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS COAL?\r\n\r\nThe whole evidence we possess as to the nature of Coal proves it to\r\nhave been originally a mass of vegetable matter. Its microscopical\r\ncharacters point to its having been formed on the spot in which we\r\nfind it, to its being composed of vegetable tissues of various kinds,\r\nseparated and changed by maceration, pressure, and chemical action,\r\nand to the introduction of its earthy matter, in a large number of\r\ninstances, in a state of solution or fine molecular subdivision. Dr.\r\nRedfern, from whose communication to the British Association we quote,\r\nknows nothing to countenance the supposition that our coal-beds are\r\nmainly formed of coniferous wood, because the structures found in\r\nmother-coal, or the charcoal layer, have not the character of the\r\nglandular tissue of such wood, as has been asserted.\r\n\r\nGeological research has shown that the immense forests from which our\r\ncoal is formed teemed with life. A frog as large as an ox existed in\r\nthe swamps, and the existence of insects proves that the higher order\r\nof organic creation flourished at this epoch.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the available coal-beds in Lancashire\r\namount in weight to the enormous sum of 8,400,000,000 tons. The total\r\nannual consumption of this coal, it has been estimated, amounts to\r\n3,400,120 tons; hence it is inferred that the coal-beds of Lancashire,\r\nat the present rate of consumption, will last 2470 years. Making\r\nsimilar calculations for the coal-fields of South Wales, the north of\r\nEngland, and Scotland, it will readily be perceived how ridiculous were\r\nthe forebodings which lecturing geologists delighted to indulge in a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTORBANE-HILL COAL.\r\n\r\nThe coal of Torbane Hill, Scotland, is so highly inflammable, that it\r\nhas been disputed at law whether it be true coal, or only asphaltum,\r\nor bitumen. Dr. Redfern describes it as laminated, splitting with\r\ngreat ease horizontally, like many cannel coals, and like them it may\r\nbe lighted at a candle. In all parts of the bed stigmaria and other\r\nfossil plants occur in greater numbers than in most other coals; their\r\ndistinct vascular tissue may be easily recognised by a common pocket\r\nlens, and 65½ of the mass consists of carbon.\r\n\r\nDr. Redfern considers that all our coals may be arranged in a scale\r\nhaving the Torbane-Hill coal at the top and anthracite at the bottom.\r\nAnthracite is almost pure carbon; Torbane Hill contains less fixed\r\ncarbon than most other cannels: anthracite is very difficult to ignite,\r\nand gives out scarcely any gas; Torbane-Hill burns like a candle, and\r\nyields 3000 cubic feet of gas per ton, more than any other known coal,\r\nits gas being also of greatly superior illuminating power to any other.\r\nThe only differences which the Torbane-Hill coal presents from others\r\nare differences of degree, not of kind. It differs from other coals\r\nin being the best gas-coal, and from other cannels in being the best\r\ncannel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MALACHITE IS FORMED.\r\n\r\nThe rich copper-ore of the Ural, which occurs in veins or masses,\r\namid metamorphic strata associated with igneous rocks, and even in\r\nthe hollows between the eruptive rocks, is worked in shafts. At the\r\nbottom of one of these, 280 feet deep, has been found an enormous\r\nirregularly-shaped botryoidal mass of _Malachite_ (Greek _malache_,\r\nmountain-green), sending off strings of green copper-ore. The upper\r\nsurface of it is about 18 feet long and 9 wide; and it was estimated\r\nto contain 15,000 poods, or half a million pounds, of pure and compact\r\nmalachite. Sir Roderick Murchison is of opinion that this wonderful\r\nsubterraneous incrustation has been produced in the stalagmitic form,\r\nduring a series of ages, by copper solutions emanating from the\r\nsurrounding loose and sporous mass, and trickling through it to the\r\nlowest cavity upon the subjacent solid rock. Malachite is brought\r\nchiefly from one mine in Siberia; its value as raw material is nearly\r\none-fourth that of the same weight of pure silver, or in a manufactured\r\nstate three guineas per pound avoirdupois.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMPS OF GOLD IN SIBERIA.\r\n\r\nThe gold mines south of Miask are chiefly remarkable for the large\r\nlumps or _pepites_ of gold which are found around the Zavod of\r\nZarevo-Alexandroisk. Previous to 1841 were discovered here lumps of\r\nnative gold; in that year a lump of twenty-four pounds was met with;\r\nand in 1843 a lump weighing about seventy-eight pounds English was\r\nfound, and is now deposited with others in the Museum of the Imperial\r\nSchool of Mines at St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ISAAC NEWTON UPON BURNET’S THEORY OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nIn 1668, Dr. Thomas Burnet printed his _Theoria Telluris Sacra_,\r\n“an eloquent physico-theological romance,” says Sir David Brewster,\r\n“which was to a certain extent adopted even by Newton, Burnet’s\r\nfriend. Abandoning, as some of the fathers had done, the hexaëmeron,\r\nor six days of Moses, as a physical reality, and having no knowledge\r\nof geological phenomena, he gives loose reins to his imagination,\r\ncombining passages of Scripture with those of ancient authors, and\r\npresumptuously describing the future catastrophes to which the earth is\r\nto be exposed.” Previous to its publication, Burnet presented a copy\r\nof his book to Newton, and requested his opinion of the theory which\r\nit propounded. Newton took “exceptions to particular passages,” and\r\na correspondence ensued. In one of Newton’s letters he treats of the\r\nformation of the earth, and the other planets, out of a general chaos\r\nof the figure assumed by the earth,--of the length of the primitive\r\ndays,--of the formation of hills and seas, and of the creation of the\r\ntwo ruling lights as the result of the clearing up of the atmosphere.\r\nHe considers the account of the creation in Genesis as adapted to the\r\njudgment of the vulgar. “Had Moses,” he says, “described the processes\r\nof creation as distinctly as they were in themselves, he would have\r\nmade the narrative tedious and confused amongst the vulgar, and become\r\na philosopher more than a prophet.” After referring to several “causes\r\nof meteors, such as the breaking out of vapours from below, before\r\nthe earth was well hardened, the settling and shrinking of the whole\r\nglobe after the upper regions or surface began to be hard,” Newton\r\ncloses his letter with an apology for being tedious, which, he says,\r\n“he has the more reason to do, as he has not set down any thing he has\r\nwell considered, or will undertake to defend.”--See the Letter in the\r\nAppendix to _Sir D. Brewster’s Life of Newton_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n  The primitive condition of the earth, and its preparation for\r\n  man, was a subject of general speculation at the close of the\r\n  seventeenth century. Leibnitz, like his great rival (Newton),\r\n  attempted to explain the formation of the earth, and of the\r\n  different substances which composed it; and he had the advantage\r\n  of possessing some knowledge of geological phenomena: the earth\r\n  he regarded as having been originally a burning mass, whose\r\n  temperature gradually diminished till the vapours were condensed\r\n  into a universal ocean, which covered the highest mountains, and\r\n  gradually flowed into vacuities and subterranean cavities produced\r\n  by the consolidation of the earth’s crust. He regarded fossils\r\n  as the real remains of plants and animals which had been buried\r\n  in the strata; and, in speculating on the formation of mineral\r\n  substances, he speaks of crystals as the geometry of inanimate\r\n  nature.--_Brewster’s Life of Newton_, vol. ii. p. 100, note. (See\r\n  also “The Age of the Globe,” in _Things not generally Known_, p.\r\n  13.)\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE FATHER OF ENGLISH GEOLOGY.”\r\n\r\nIn 1769 was born, the son of a yeoman of Oxfordshire, William\r\nSmith. When a boy he delighted to wander in the fields, collecting\r\n“pound-stones” (_Echinites_), “pundibs” (_Terebratulæ_), and other\r\nstony curiosities; and receiving little education beyond what he taught\r\nhimself, he learned nothing of classics but the name. Grown to be a\r\nman, he became a land-surveyor and civil engineer, and was much engaged\r\nin constructing canals. While thus occupied, he observed that all the\r\nrocky masses forming the substrata of the country were gently inclined\r\nto the east and south-east,--that the red sandstones and marls above\r\nthe _coal-measures_ passed below the beds provincially termed lias-clay\r\nand limestone--that these again passed underneath the sands, yellow\r\nlimestone, and clays that form the table-land of the Coteswold Hills;\r\nwhile they in turn plunged beneath the great escarpment of chalk that\r\nruns from the coast of Dorsetshire northward to the Yorkshire shores\r\nof the German Ocean. He further observed that each formation of clay,\r\nsand, or limestone, held to a very great extent its own peculiar suite\r\nof fossils. The “snake-stones” (_Ammonites_) of the lias were different\r\nin form and ornament from those of the inferior oolite; and the\r\nshells of the latter, again, differed from those of the Oxford clay,\r\nCornbrash, and Kimmeridge clay. Pondering much on these things, he\r\ncame to the then unheard-of conclusion that each formation had been in\r\nits turn a sea-bottom, in the sediments of which lived and died marine\r\nanimals now extinct, many specially distinctive of their own epochs in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHere indeed was a discovery,--made, too, by a man utterly unknown to\r\nthe scientific world, and having no pretension to scientific lore.\r\n“Strata Smith’s” find was unheeded for many a long year; but at length\r\nthe first geologists of the day learned from the land-surveyor that\r\nsuperposition of strata is inseparably connected with the succession\r\nof life in time. Hooke’s grand vision was at length realised, and it\r\nwas indeed possible “to build up a terrestrial chronology from rotten\r\nshells” imbedded in the rocks. Meanwhile he had constructed the first\r\ngeological map of England, which has served as a basis for geological\r\nmaps of all other parts of the world. William Smith was now presented\r\nby the Geological Society with the Wollaston Medal, and hailed as “the\r\nFather of English Geology.” He died in 1840. Till the manner as well\r\nas the fact of the first appearance of successive forms of life shall\r\nbe solved, it is not easy to surmise how any discovery can be made in\r\ngeology equal in value to that which we owe to the genius of William\r\nSmith.--_Saturday Review_, No. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. BUCKLAND’s GEOLOGICAL LABOURS.\r\n\r\nSir Henry De la Beche, in his Anniversary Address to the Geological\r\nSociety in 1848, on presenting the Wollaston Medal to Dr. Buckland,\r\nfelicitously observed:\r\n\r\n  It may not be generally known that, while yet a child, at your\r\n  native town, Axminster in Devonshire, ammonites, obtained by your\r\n  father from the lime quarries in the neighbourhood, were presented\r\n  to your attention. As a scholar at Winchester, the chalk, with its\r\n  flints, was brought under your observation, and there it was that\r\n  your collections in natural history first began. Removed to Oxford,\r\n  as a scholar of Corpus Christi College, the future teacher of\r\n  geology in that University was fortunate in meeting with congenial\r\n  tastes in our colleague Mr. W. J. Broderip, then a student at Oriel\r\n  College. It was during your walks together to Shotover Hill, when\r\n  his knowledge of conchology was so valuable to you, enabling you\r\n  to distinguish the shells of the Oxford oolite, that you laid the\r\n  foundation for those field-lectures, forming part of your course\r\n  of geology at Oxford, which no one is likely to forget who has\r\n  been so fortunate at any time as to have attended them. The fruits\r\n  of your walks with Mr. Broderip formed the nucleus of that great\r\n  collection, more especially remarkable for the organic remains\r\n  it contains, which, after the labours of forty years, you have\r\n  presented to the Geological Museum at Oxford, in grave recollection\r\n  of the aid which the endowments of that University, and the leisure\r\n  of its vacations, had afforded you for extensive travelling during\r\n  a residence at Oxford of nearly forty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERIES OF M. AGASSIZ.[34]\r\n\r\nThis great paleontologist, in the course of his ichthyological\r\nresearches, was led to perceive that the arrangement by Cuvier\r\naccording to organs did not fulfil its purpose with regard to fossil\r\nfishes, because in the lapse of ages the characteristics of their\r\nstructures were destroyed. He therefore adopted the only other\r\nremaining plan, and studied the tissues, which, being less complex\r\nthan the organs, are oftener found intact. The result was the very\r\nremarkable discovery, that the tegumentary membrane of fishes is so\r\nintimately connected with their organisation, that if the whole of the\r\nfish has perished except this membrane, it is practicable, by noting\r\nits characteristics, to reconstruct the animal in its most essential\r\nparts. Of the value of this principle of harmony, some idea may be\r\nformed from the circumstance, that on it Agassiz has based the whole\r\nof that celebrated classification of which he is the sole author, and\r\nby which fossil ichthyology has for the first time assumed a precise\r\nand definite shape. How essential its study is to the geologist appears\r\nfrom the remark of Sir Roderick Murchison, that “fossil fishes have\r\nevery where proved the most exact chronometer of the age of rocks.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSION OF LIFE IN TIME.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of Economic Geology, in Jermyn Street, may be seen ores,\r\nmetals, rocks, and whole suites of fossils stratigraphically arranged\r\nin such a manner that, with an observant eye for form, all may easily\r\nunderstand the more obvious scientific meanings of the Succession\r\nof Life in Time, and its bearing on geological economies. It is\r\nperhaps scarcely an exaggeration to say, that the greater number of\r\nso-called educated persons are still ignorant of the meaning of this\r\ngreat doctrine. They would be ashamed not to know that there are many\r\nsuns and material worlds besides our own; but the science, equally\r\ngrand and comprehensible, that aims at the discovery of the laws that\r\nregulated the creation, extension, decadence, and utter extinction of\r\nmany successive species, genera, and whole orders of life, is ignored,\r\nor, if intruded on the attention, is looked on as an uncertain and\r\ndangerous dream,--and this in a country which was almost the nursery of\r\ngeology, and which for half a century has boasted the first Geological\r\nSociety in the world.--_Saturday Review_, No. 140.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE DIVERSITY AND NUMBERS OF ANIMALS IN GEOLOGICAL TIMES.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz considers that the very fact of certain stratified\r\nrocks, even among the oldest formations, being almost entirely made\r\nup of fragments of organised beings, should long ago have satisfied\r\nthe most sceptical that both _animal and vegetable life were as active\r\nand profusely scattered upon the whole globe at all times, and during\r\nall geological periods, as they are now_. No coral reef in the Pacific\r\ncontains a larger amount of organic _débris_ than some of the limestone\r\ndeposits of the tertiary, of the cretaceous, or of the oolitic, nay\r\neven of the paleozoic period; and the whole vegetable carpet covering\r\nthe present surface of the globe, even if we were to consider only\r\nthe luxuriant vegetation of the tropics, leaving entirely out of\r\nconsideration the entire expanse of the ocean, as well as those tracts\r\nof land where, under less favourable circumstances, the growth of\r\nplants is more reduced,--would not form one single seam of workable\r\ncoal to be compared to the many thick beds contained in the rocks of\r\nthe carboniferous period alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND IN THE EOCENE PERIOD.\r\n\r\nEocene is Sir Charles Lyell’s term for the lowest group of the Tertiary\r\nsystem in which the dawn of recent life appears; and any one who wishes\r\nto realise what was the aspect presented by this country during the\r\nEocene period, need only go to Sheerness. If, leaving that place behind\r\nhim, he walks down the Thames, keeping close to the edge of the water,\r\nhe will find whole bushels of pyritised pieces of twigs and fruits.\r\nThese fruits and twigs belong to plants nearly allied to the screw-pine\r\nand custard-apple, and to various species of palms and spice-trees\r\nwhich now flourish in the Eastern Archipelago. At the time they were\r\nwashed down from some neighbouring land, not only crocodilian reptiles,\r\nbut sharks and innumerable turtles, inhabited a sea or estuary which\r\nnow forms part of the London district; and huge boa-constrictors glided\r\namongst the trees which fringed the adjoining shores.\r\n\r\nCountless as are the ages which intervened between the Eocene period\r\nand the time when the little jawbones of Stonesfield were washed down\r\nto the place where they were to await the day when science should bring\r\nthem again to light, not one mammalian genus which now lives upon our\r\nplane has been discovered amongst Eocene strata. We have existing\r\nfamilies, but nothing more.--_Professor Owen._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD OF THE IGUANODON.\r\n\r\nDr. Mantell, from the examination of the anterior part of the right\r\nside of the lower jaw of an Iguanodon discovered in a quarry in Tilgate\r\nForest, Sussex, has detected an extraordinary deviation from all\r\nknown types of reptilian organisation, and which could not have been\r\npredicated; namely, that this colossal reptile, which equalled in bulk\r\nthe gigantic Edentata of South America, and like them was destined to\r\nobtain support from comminuted vegetable substances, was also furnished\r\nwith a large prehensile tongue and fleshy lips, to serve as instruments\r\nfor seizing and cropping the foliage and branches of trees; while\r\nthe arrangement of the teeth as in the ruminants, and their internal\r\nstructure, which resembles that of the molars of the sloth tribe in the\r\nvascularity of the dentine, indicate adaptations for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nAmong the physiological phenomena revealed by paleontology, there\r\nis not a more remarkable one than this modification of the type of\r\norganisation peculiar to the class of reptiles to meet the conditions\r\nrequired by the economy of a lizard placed under similar physical\r\nrelations; and destined to effect the same general purpose in the\r\nscheme of nature as the colossal Edentata of former ages and the large\r\nherbivorous mammalia of our own times.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PTERODACTYL--THE FLYING DRAGON.\r\n\r\nThe Tilgate beds of the Wealden series, just mentioned, have yielded\r\nnumerous fragments of the most remarkable reptilian fossils yet\r\ndiscovered, and whose wonderful forms denote them to have thronged\r\nthe shallow seas and bays and lagoons of the period. In the grounds\r\nof the Crystal Palace at Sydenham the reader will find restorations\r\nof these animals sufficiently perfect to illustrate this reptilian\r\nepoch. They include the _iguanodon_, an herbivorous lizard exceeding\r\nin size the largest elephant, and accompanied by the equally gigantic\r\nand carnivorous _megalosaurus_ (great saurian), and by the two yet more\r\ncurious reptiles, the _pylæosaurus_ (forest, or weald, saurian) and the\r\npterodactyl (from _pteron_, ‘wing,’ and _dactylus_, ‘a finger’), an\r\nenormous bat-like creature, now running upon the ground like a bird;\r\nits elevated body and long neck not covered with feathers, but with\r\nskin, naked, or resplendent with glittering scales; its head like that\r\nof a lizard or crocodile, and of a size almost preposterous compared\r\nwith that of the body, with its long fore extremities stretched out,\r\nand connected by a membrane with the body and hind legs.\r\n\r\nSuddenly this mailed creature rose in the air, and realised or even\r\nsurpassed in strangeness _the flying dragon of fable_: its fore-arms\r\nand its elongated wing-finger furnished with claws; hand and fingers\r\nextended, and the interspace filled up by a tough membrane; and its\r\nhead and neck stretched out like that of the heron in its flight. When\r\nstationary, its wings were probably folded back like those of a bird;\r\nthough perhaps, by the claws attached to its fingers, it might suspend\r\nitself from the branches of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMALIA IN SECONDARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed till very lately that few if any Mammalia were to be\r\nfound below the Tertiary rocks, _i. e._ those above the chalk; and this\r\nsupposed fact was very comfortable to those who support the doctrine\r\nof “progressive development,” and hold, with the notorious _Vestiges\r\nof Creation_, that a fish by mere length of time became a reptile,\r\na lemur an ape, and finally an ape a man. But here, as in a hundred\r\nother cases, facts, when duly investigated, are against their theory.\r\nA mammal jaw had been already discovered by Mr. Brodie on the shore at\r\nthe back of Swanage Point, in Dorsetshire, when Mr. Beckles, F.G.S.,\r\ntraced the vein from which this jaw had been procured, and found it\r\nto be a stratum about five inches thick, at the base of the Middle\r\nPurbeck beds; and after removing many thousand tons of rock, and laying\r\nbare an area of nearly 7000 square feet (the largest cutting ever made\r\nfor purely scientific purposes), he found reptiles (tortoises and\r\nlizards) in hundreds; but the most important discovery was that of\r\nthe jaws of at least fourteen different species of mammalia. Some of\r\nthese were herbivorous, some carnivorous, connected with our modern\r\nshrews, moles, hedgehogs, &c.; but all of them perfectly developed and\r\nhighly-organised quadrupeds. Ten years ago, no remains of quadrupeds\r\nwere believed to exist in the Secondary strata. “Even in 1854,” says\r\nSir Charles Lyell (in a supplement to the fifth edition of his _Manual\r\nof Elementary Geology_), “only six species of mammals from rocks older\r\nthan the Tertiary were known in the whole world.” We now possess\r\nevidence of the existence of fourteen species, belonging to eight or\r\nnine genera, from the fresh-water strata of the Middle Purbeck Oolite.\r\nIt would be rash now to fix a limit in past time to the existence of\r\nquadrupeds.--_The Rev. C. Kingsley._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL HUMAN BONES.\r\n\r\nIn the paleontological collection in the British Museum is preserved\r\na considerable portion of a human skeleton imbedded in a slab of\r\nrock, brought from Guadaloupe, and often referred to in opposition to\r\nthe statement that hitherto _no fossil human hones have been found_.\r\nThe presence of these bones, however, has been explained by the\r\ncircumstance of a battle and the massacre of a tribe of Galtibis by the\r\nCaribs, which took place near the spot in which the bones were found\r\nabout 130 years ago; for as the bodies of the slain were interred on\r\nthe seashore, their skeletons may have been subsequently covered by\r\nsand-drift, which has since consolidated into limestone.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by reference to the _Philosophical Transactions_,\r\nthat on the reading of the paper upon this discovery to the Royal\r\nSociety, in 1814, Sir Joseph Banks, the president, considered the\r\n“fossil” to be of very modern formation, and that probably, from the\r\ncontiguity of a volcano, the temperature of the water may have been\r\nraised at some time, and dissolving carbonate of lime readily, may\r\nhave deposited about the skeleton in a comparatively short period hard\r\nand solid stone. Every person may be convinced of the rapidity of the\r\nformation and of the hardness of such stone by inspecting the inside of\r\ntea-kettles in which hard water is boiled.\r\n\r\n  Descriptions of petrifactions of human bodies appear to refer to\r\n  the conversion of bodies into adipocere, and not into stone. All\r\n  the supposed cases of petrifaction are probably of this nature.\r\n  The change occurs only when the coffin becomes filled with water.\r\n  The body, converted into adipocere, floats on the water. The\r\n  supposed cases of changes of position in the grave, bursting open\r\n  the coffin-lids, turning over, crossing of limbs, &c., formerly\r\n  attributed to the coming to life of persons buried who were not\r\n  dead, is now ascertained to be due to the same cause. The chemical\r\n  change into adipocere, and the evolution of gases, produce these\r\n  movements of dead bodies.--_Mr. Trail Green._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST ANCIENT FISHES.\r\n\r\nAmong the important results of Sir Roderick Murchison’s establishment\r\nof the Silurian system is the following:\r\n\r\n  That as the Lower Silurian group, often of vast dimensions, has\r\n  never afforded the smallest vestige of a Fish, though it abounds\r\n  in numerous species of the _marine_ classes,--corals, _crinoidea_,\r\n  _mollusca_, and _crustacea_; and as in Scandinavia and Russia,\r\n  where it is based on rocks void of fossils, its lowest stratum\r\n  contains _fucoids_ only,--Sir R. Murchison has, after fifteen years\r\n  of laborious research steadily directed to this point, arrived at\r\n  the conclusion, that a very long period elapsed after life was\r\n  breathed into the waters before the lowest order of vertebrata was\r\n  created; the earliest fishes being those of the Upper Silurian\r\n  rocks, which he was the first to discover, and which he described\r\n  “as the most ancient beings of their class which have yet been\r\n  brought to light.” Though the Lower Silurian rocks of various parts\r\n  of the world have since been ransacked by multitudes of prying\r\n  geologists, who have exhumed from them myriads of marine fossils,\r\n  not a single ichthyolite has been found in any stratum of higher\r\n  antiquity than the Upper Silurian group of Murchison.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of all fossil fishes yet discovered have been found\r\nin the Old Red Sandstone cliffs at Dorpat, where the remains are so\r\ngigantic (one bone measuring _two feet nine inches_ in length) that\r\nthey were at first supposed to belong to saurians.\r\n\r\nSir Roderick’s examination of Russia has, in short, proved that _the\r\nichthyolites and mollusks which, in Western Europe, are separately\r\npeculiar to smaller detached basins, were here (in the British Isles)\r\ncohabitants of many parts of the same great sea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS OF BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen has thus forcibly illustrated the Carnivorous Animals\r\nwhich preyed upon and restrained the undue multiplication of the\r\nvegetable feeders. First we have the bear family, which is now\r\nrepresented in this country only by the badger. We were once blest,\r\nhowever, with many bears. One species seems to have been identical\r\nwith the existing brown bear of the European continent. Far larger\r\nand more formidable was the gigantic cave-bear (_Ursus spelæus_),\r\nwhich surpassed in size his grisly brother of North America. The\r\nskull of the cave-bear differs very much in shape from that of its\r\nsmall brown relative just alluded to; the forehead, in particular,\r\nis much higher,--to be accounted for by an arrangement of air-cells\r\nsimilar to those which we have already remarked in the elephant. The\r\ncave-bear has left its remains in vast abundance in Germany. In our own\r\ncaves, the bones of hyænas are found in greater quantities. The marks\r\nwhich the teeth of the hyæna make upon the bones which it gnaws are\r\nquite unmistakable. Our English hyænas had the most undiscriminating\r\nappetite, preying upon every creature, their own species amongst\r\nothers. Wolves, not distinguishable from those which now exist in\r\nFrance and Germany, seem to have kept company with the hyænas; and the\r\n_Felis spelæa_, a sort of lion, but larger than any which now exists,\r\nruled over all weaker brutes. Here, says Professor Owen, we have the\r\noriginal British Lion. A species of _Machairodus_ has left its remains\r\nat Kent’s Hole, near Torquay. In England we had also the beaver, which\r\nstill lingers on the Danube and the Rhone, and a larger species, which\r\nhas been called Trogontherium (gnawing beast), and a gigantic mole.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT CAVE TIGER OR LION OF BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nRemains of this remarkable animal of the drift or gravel period\r\nof this country have been found at Brentford and elsewhere near\r\nLondon. Speaking of this animal, Professor Owen observes, that “it\r\nis commonly supposed that the Lion, the Tiger, and the Jaguar are\r\nanimals peculiarly adapted to a tropical climate. The genus Felis (to\r\nwhich these animals belong) is, however, represented by specimens\r\nin high northern latitudes, and in all the intermediate countries\r\nto the equator.” The chief condition necessary for the presence of\r\nsuch animals is an abundance of the vegetable-feeding animals. It\r\nis thus that the Indian tiger has been known to follow the herds of\r\nantelope and deer in the lofty mountains of the Himalaya to the verge\r\nof perpetual snow, and far into Siberia. “It need not, therefore,”\r\ncontinues Professor Owen, “excite surprise that indications should\r\nhave been discovered in the fossil relics of the ancient mammalian\r\npopulation of Europe of a large feline animal, the contemporary of the\r\nmammoth, of the tichorrhine rhinoceros, of the great gigantic cave-bear\r\nand hyæna, and the slayer of the oxen, deer, and equine quadrupeds that\r\nso abounded during the same epoch.” The dimensions of this extinct\r\nanimal equal those of the largest African lion or Bengal tiger; and\r\nsome bones have been found which seem to imply that it had even more\r\npowerful limbs and larger paws.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAMMOTHS OF THE BRITISH ISLES.\r\n\r\nDr. Buckland has shown that for long ages many species of carnivorous\r\nanimals now extinct inhabited the caves of the British islands. In low\r\ntracts of Yorkshire, where tranquil lacustrine (lake-like) deposits\r\nhave occurred, bones (even those of the lion) have been found so\r\nperfectly unbroken and unworn, in fine gravel (as at Market Weighton),\r\nthat few persons would be disposed to deny that such feline and other\r\nanimals once roamed over the British isles, as well as other European\r\ncountries. Why, then, is it improbable that large elephants, with a\r\npeculiarly thick integument, a close coating of wool, and much long\r\nshaggy hair, should have been the occupants of wide tracts of Northern\r\nEurope and Asia? This coating, Dr. Fleming has well remarked, was\r\nprobably as impenetrable to rain and cold as that of the monster ox of\r\nthe polar circle. Such is the opinion of Sir Roderick Murchison, who\r\nthus accounts for the disappearance of the mammoths from Britain:\r\n\r\n  When we turn from the great Siberian continent, which, anterior\r\n  to its elevation, was the chief abode of the mammoths, and look\r\n  to the other parts of Europe, where their remains also occur, how\r\n  remarkable is it that we find the number of these creatures to be\r\n  justly proportionate to the magnitude of the ancient masses of land\r\n  which the labours of geologists have defined! Take the British\r\n  isles, for example, and let all their low, recently elevated\r\n  districts be submerged; let, in short, England be viewed as the\r\n  comparatively small island she was when the ancient estuary of the\r\n  Thames, including the plains of Hyde Park, Chelsea, Hounslow, and\r\n  Uxbridge, were under the water; when the Severn extended far into\r\n  the heart of the kingdom, and large eastern tracts of the island\r\n  were submerged,--and there will then remain but moderately-sized\r\n  feeding-grounds for the great quadrupeds whose bones are found in\r\n  the gravel of the adjacent rivers and estuaries.\r\n\r\nThis limited area of subsistence could necessarily only keep up a small\r\nstock of such animals; and, just as we might expect, the remains of\r\nBritish mammoths occur in very small numbers indeed, when compared with\r\nthose of the great charnel-houses of Siberia, into which their bones\r\nhad been carried down through countless ages from the largest mass of\r\nsurface which geological inquiries have yet shown to have been _dry\r\nland_ during that epoch.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the mammoth, says Professor Owen, have been found in\r\nall, or almost all, the counties of England. Off the coast of Norfolk\r\nthey are met with in vast abundance. The fishermen who go to catch\r\nturbot between the mouth of the Thames and the Dutch coast constantly\r\nget their nets entangled in the tusks of the mammoth. A collection\r\nof tusks and other remains, obtained in this way, is to be seen at\r\nRamsgate. In North America, this gigantic extinct elephant must have\r\nbeen very common; and a large portion of the ivory which supplies\r\nthe markets of Europe is derived from the vast mammoth graveyards of\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nThe mammoth ranged at least as far north as 60°. There is no doubt\r\nthat, at the present day, many specimens of the musk-ox are annually\r\nbecoming imbedded in the mud and ice of the North-American rivers.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, that the mammoth teeth which are met with\r\nin caves generally belonged to young mammoths, who probably resorted\r\nthither for shelter before increasing age and strength emboldened them\r\nto wander far afield.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RHINOCEROS AND HIPPOPOTAMUS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nThe mammoth was not the only giant that inhabited England in the\r\nPliocene or Upper Tertiary period. We had also here the _Rhinoceros\r\ntichorrhinus_, or “strongly walled about the nose,” remains of which\r\nhave been discovered in enormous quantities in the brickfields about\r\nLondon. Pallas describes an entire specimen of this creature, which was\r\nfound near Yakutsk, the coldest town on the globe. Another rhinoceros,\r\n_leptorrhinus_ (fine nose), dwelt with the elephant of Southern Europe.\r\nIn Siberia has been discovered the Elaimotherium, forming a link\r\nbetween the rhinoceros and the horse.\r\n\r\nIn the days of the mammoth, we had also in England a Hippopotamus,\r\nrather larger than the species which now inhabits the Nile. Of our\r\nBritish hippopotamus some remains were dug up by the workmen in\r\npreparing the foundations of the New Junior United Service Club-house,\r\nin Regent-street.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT AND TORTOISE.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an Elephant standing on the back of a Tortoise was often\r\nlaughed at as an absurdity, until Captain Cautley and Dr. Falconer\r\nat length discovered in the hills of Asia the remains of a tortoise\r\nin a fossil state of such a size that an elephant could easily have\r\nperformed the above feat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOEXISTENCE OF MAN AND THE MASTODON.\r\n\r\nDr. C. F. Winslow has communicated to the Boston Society of Natural\r\nHistory the discovery of the fragment of a human cranium 180 feet below\r\nthe surface of the Table Mountain, California. Now the mastodon’s\r\nbones being found in the same deposits, points very clearly to the\r\nprobability of the appearance of the human race on the western\r\nportions of North America at least before the extinction of those huge\r\ncreatures. Fragments of mastodon and _Elephas primigenius_ have been\r\ntaken ten and twenty feet below the surface in the above locality;\r\nwhere this discovery of human and mastodon remains gives strength\r\nto the possible truth of an old Indian tradition,--the contemporary\r\nexistence of the mammoth and aboriginals in this region of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS OF THE MEGATHERIUM.\r\n\r\nMuch uncertainty has been felt about the habits of the Megatherium,\r\nor Great Beast. It has been asked whether it burrowed or climbed, or\r\nwhat it did; and difficulties have presented themselves on all sides of\r\nthe question. Some have thought that it lived in trees as much larger\r\nthan those which now exist as the Megatherium itself is larger than\r\nthe common sloth.[35] This, however, is now known to be a mistake.\r\nIt did not climb trees--it pulled them down; and in order to do this\r\nthe hinder parts of its skeleton were made enormously strong, and\r\nits prehensile fore-legs formed so as to give it a tremendous power\r\nover any thing which it grasped. Dr. Buckland suggested that animals\r\nwhich got their living in this way had a very fair chance of having\r\ntheir heads broken. While Professor Owen was still pondering over this\r\ndifficulty, the skull of a cognate animal, the Mylodon, came into\r\nhis hands. Great was his delight when he found that the mylodon not\r\nonly had his head broken, but broken in two different places, at two\r\ndifferent times; and moreover so broken that the injury could only have\r\nbeen inflicted by some such agent as a fallen tree. The creature had\r\nrecovered from the first blow, but had evidently died of the second.\r\nThis tribe had, as it turns out, two skulls, an outer and an inner\r\none--given them, as it would appear, expressly with a view to the very\r\ndangerous method in which they were intended to obtain their necessary\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nThe dentition of the megatherium is curious. The elephant gets teeth\r\nas he wants them. Nature provided for the comfort of the megatherium\r\nin another way. It did not get new teeth, but the old ones went on\r\nfor ever growing as long as the animal lived; so that as fast as one\r\ngrinding surface became useless, another supplied its place.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DINOTHERIUM, OR TERRIBLE BEAST.\r\n\r\nThe family of herbivorous Cetaceans are connected with the\r\nPachydermata of the land by one of the most wonderful of all the\r\nextinct creatures with which geologists have made us acquainted.\r\nThis is the _Dinotherium_, or Terrible Beast. The remains of this\r\nanimal were found in Miocene sands at Eppelsheim, about forty miles\r\nfrom Darmstadt. It must have been larger than the largest extinct or\r\nliving elephant. The most remarkable peculiarity of its structure is\r\nthe enormous tusks, curving downwards and terminating its lower jaw.\r\nIt appears to have lived in the water, where the immense weight of\r\nthese formidable appendages would not be so inconvenient as on land.\r\nWhat these tusks were used for is a mystery; but perhaps they acted\r\nas pickaxes in digging up trees and shrubs, or as harrows in raking\r\nthe bottom of the water. Dr. Buckland used to suggest that they were\r\nperhaps employed as anchors, by means of which the monster might\r\nfasten itself to the bank of a stream and enjoy a comfortable nap. The\r\nextreme length of the _Dinotherium_ was about eighteen feet. Professor\r\nKemp, in his restoration of the animal, has given it a trunk like\r\nthat of the elephant, but not so long, and the general form of the\r\ntapir.--_Professor Owen._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLYPTODON.\r\n\r\nThere are few creatures which we should less have expected to find\r\nrepresented in fossil history by a race of gigantic brethren than the\r\narmadillo. The creature is so small, not only in size but in all its\r\nworks and ways, that we with difficulty associate it with the idea of\r\nmagnitude. Yet Sir Woodbine Parish has discovered evidences of enormous\r\nanimals of this family having once dwelt in South America. The huge\r\nloricated (plated over) creature whose relics were first sent has\r\nreceived the name of Glyptodon, from its sculptured teeth. Unlike the\r\nsmall armadillos, it was unable to roll itself up into a ball; though\r\nan enormous carnivore which lived in those days must have made it\r\nsometimes wish it had the power to do so. When attacked, it must have\r\ncrouched down, and endeavoured to make its huge shell as good a defence\r\nas possible.--_Professor Owen._\r\n\r\n\r\nINMATES OF AN AUSTRALIAN CAVERN.\r\n\r\nFrom the fossil-bone caverns in Wellington Valley, in 1830, were sent\r\nto Professor Owen several bones which belonged, as it turned out, to\r\ngigantic kangaroos, immensely larger than any existing species; to\r\na kind of wombat, to formidable dasyures, and several other genera.\r\nIt also appeared that the bones, which were those of herbivores, had\r\nevidently belonged to young animals, while those of the carnivores\r\nwere full-sized; a fact which points to the relations between the two\r\nfamilies having been any thing but agreeable to the herbivores.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POUCH-LION OF AUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nThe _Thylacoleo_ (Pouch-Lion) was a gigantic marsupial carnivore, whose\r\ncharacter and affinities Professor Owen has, with exquisite scientific\r\ntact, made out from very small indications. This monster, which had\r\nkangaroos with heads three feet long to feed on, must have been one of\r\nthe most extraordinary animals of the antique world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONEY OF SCRIPTURE.\r\n\r\nPaleontologists have pointed out the curious fact that the Hyrax,\r\ncalled ‘coney’ in our authorised version of the Bible, is really only\r\na diminutive and hornless rhinoceros. Remains have been found at\r\nEppelsheim which indicate an animal more like a gigantic Hyrax than\r\nany of the existing rhinoceroses. To this the name of _Acerotherium_\r\n(Hornless Beast) has been given.\r\n\r\n\r\nA THREE-HOOFED HORSE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen describes the _Hipparion_, or Three-hoofed Horse, as the\r\nfirst representative of a family so useful to mankind. This animal,\r\nin addition to its true hoof, appears to have had two additional\r\nelementary hoofs, analogous to those which we see in the ox. The object\r\nof these no doubt was to enable the Hipparion to extricate his foot\r\nwith greater ease than he otherwise could when it sank through the\r\nswampy ground on which he lived.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO MONSTER CARNIVORES OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\nA huge carnivorous creature has been found in Miocene strata in\r\nFrance, in which country it preyed upon the gazelle and antelope. It\r\nmust have been as large as a grisly bear, but in general appearance\r\nand teeth more like a gigantic dog. Hence the name of _Amphicyon_\r\n(Doubtful Dog) has been assigned to it. This animal must have derived\r\npart of its support from vegetables. Not so the coeval monster which\r\nhas been called _Machairodus_ (Sabre-tooth). It must have been\r\nsomewhat akin to the tiger, and is by far the most formidable animal\r\nwhich we have met with in our ascending progress through the extinct\r\nmammalia.--_Professor Owen._\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY OF THE SHEEP.\r\n\r\nNo unequivocal fossil remains of the sheep have yet been found in\r\nthe bone-caves, the drift, or the more tranquil stratified newer\r\nPliocene deposits, so associated with the fossil bones of oxen,\r\nwild-boars, wolves, foxes, otters, &c., as to indicate the coevality\r\nof the sheep with those species, or in such an altered state as to\r\nindicate them to have been of equal antiquity. Professor Owen had his\r\nattention particularly directed to this point in collecting evidence\r\nfor a history of British Fossil Mammalia. No fossil core-horns of the\r\nsheep have yet been any where discovered; and so far as this negative\r\nevidence goes, we may infer that the sheep is not geologically more\r\nancient than man; that it is not a native of Europe, but has been\r\nintroduced by the tribes who carried hither the germs of civilisation\r\nin their migrations westward from Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRILOBITE.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest races we have those remarkable forms, the\r\nTrilobites, inhabiting the ancient ocean. These crustacea remotely\r\nresemble the common wood-louse, and like that animal they had the power\r\nof rolling themselves into a ball when attacked by an enemy. The eye of\r\nthe trilobite is a most remarkable organ; and in that of one species,\r\n_Phacops caudatus_, not less than 250 lenses have been discovered. This\r\nremarkable optical instrument indicates that these creatures lived\r\nunder similar conditions to those which surround the crustacea of the\r\npresent day.--_Hunt’s Poetry of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFITABLE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nIn that strip of reddish colour which runs along the cliffs of Suffolk,\r\nand is called the Redcrag, immense quantities of cetacean remains have\r\nbeen found. Four different kinds of whales, little inferior in size to\r\nthe whalebone whale, have left their bones in this vast charnel-house.\r\nIn 1840, a singularly perplexing fossil was brought to Professor Owen\r\nfrom this Redcrag. No one could say what it was. He determined it to\r\nbe the tooth of a cetacean, a unique specimen. Now the remains of\r\ncetaceans in the Suffolk crag have been discovered in such enormous\r\nquantities, that many thousands a-year are made by converting them into\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTINCT GIGANTIC BIRDS OF NEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nIn the islands of New Zealand have been found the bones of large\r\nextinct wingless Birds, belonging to the Post Tertiary or Recent\r\nsystem, which have been deposited by the action of rivers. The bird\r\nis named _Moa_ by the natives, and _Dinornis_ by naturalists: some\r\nof the bones have been found in two caves in the North Island, and\r\nhave been sold by the natives at an extraordinary price. The caves\r\noccur in limestone rocks, and the bones are found beneath earth and\r\na soft deposit of carbonate of lime. The largest of the birds is\r\nstated to have stood thirteen or fourteen feet, or twice the height\r\nof the ostrich; and its egg large enough to fill the hat of a man as\r\na cup. Several statements have appeared of these birds being still\r\nin existence, but there is every reason to believe the Moa to be\r\naltogether extinct.\r\n\r\nAn extensive collection of remains of these great wingless birds has\r\nbeen collected in New Zealand by Mr. Walter Mantell, and deposited in\r\nthe British Museum. Among these bones Professor Owen has discovered a\r\nspecies which he regards as the most remarkable of the feathered class\r\nfor its prodigious strength and massive proportions, and which he names\r\n_Dinornis elephantopus_, or elephant-footed, of which the Professor\r\nhas been able to construct an entire lower limb: the length of the\r\nmetatarsal bone is 9¼ inches, the breadth of the lower end being\r\n5-1/3 inches. The extraordinary proportions of the metatarsus of this\r\nwingless bird will, however, be still better understood by comparison\r\nwith the same bone in the ostrich, in which the metatarsus is 19 inches\r\nin length, the breadth of its lower end being only 2½ inches. From\r\nthe materials accumulated by Mr. Mantell, the entire skeleton of the\r\n_Dinornis elephantopus_ has been reconstructed; and now forms a worthy\r\ncompanion of the Megatherium and Mastodon in the gallery of fossil\r\nremains in the British Museum. This species of _Dinornis_ appears to\r\nhave been restricted to the Middle Island of New Zealand.[36]\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of the remains of the _Dinornis_ is preserved in the\r\nMuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons, in Lincoln’s-Inn Fields; and\r\nthe means by which the college obtained this valuable acquisition is\r\nthus graphically narrated by Mr. Samuel Warren, F.R.S.:\r\n\r\n  In the year 1839, Professor Owen was sitting alone in his study,\r\n  when a shabbily-dressed man made his appearance, announcing that he\r\n  had got a great curiosity, which he had brought from New Zealand,\r\n  and wished to dispose of to him. It had the appearance of an old\r\n  marrow-bone, about six inches in length, and rather more than\r\n  two inches in thickness, _with both extremities broken off_; and\r\n  Professor Owen considered that, to whatever animal it might have\r\n  belonged, the fragment must have lain in the earth for centuries.\r\n  At first he considered this same marrow-bone to have belonged to\r\n  an ox, at all events to a quadruped; for the wall or rim of the\r\n  bone was six times as thick as the bone of any bird, even of the\r\n  ostrich. He compared it with the bones in the skeleton of an ox, a\r\n  horse, a camel, a tapir, and every quadruped apparently possessing\r\n  a bone of that size and configuration; but it corresponded with\r\n  none. On this he very narrowly examined the surface of the bony\r\n  rim, and at length became satisfied that this fragment must have\r\n  belonged to _a bird_!--to one at least as large as an ostrich, but\r\n  of a totally different species; and consequently one never before\r\n  heard of, as an ostrich was by far the biggest bird known.\r\n\r\n  From the difference in the _strength_ of the bone, the ostrich\r\n  being unable to fly, so must have been unable this unknown bird;\r\n  and so our anatomist came to the conclusion that this old shapeless\r\n  bone indicated the former existence in New Zealand of some huge\r\n  bird, at least as great as an ostrich, but of a far heavier and\r\n  more sluggish kind. Professor Owen was confident of the validity\r\n  of his conclusions, but would communicate that confidence to\r\n  no one else; and notwithstanding attempts to dissuade him from\r\n  committing his views to the public, he printed his deductions\r\n  in the _Transactions of the Zoological Society for 1839_, where\r\n  fortunately they remain on record as conclusive evidence of the\r\n  fact of his having then made this guess, so to speak, in the dark.\r\n  He caused the bone, however, to be engraved; and having sent a\r\n  hundred copies of the engraving to New Zealand, in the hope of\r\n  their being distributed and leading to interesting results, he\r\n  patiently waited for three years,--viz. till the year 1842,--when\r\n  he received intelligence from Dr. Buckland, at Oxford, that a\r\n  great box, just arrived from New Zealand, consigned to himself,\r\n  was on its way, unopened, to Professor Owen, who found it filled\r\n  with bones, palpably of a bird, one of which bones was three feet\r\n  in length, and much more than double the size of any bone in the\r\n  ostrich!\r\n\r\n  And out of the contents of this box the Professor was positively\r\n  enabled to articulate almost the entire skeleton of a huge wingless\r\n  bird between TEN and ELEVEN feet in height, its bony structure in\r\n  strict conformity with the fragment in question; and that skeleton\r\n  may at any time be seen at the Museum of the College of Surgeons,\r\n  towering over, and nearly twice the height of, the skeleton of\r\n  an ostrich; and at its feet lying the old bone from which alone\r\n  consummate anatomical science had deduced such an astounding\r\n  reality,--the existence of an enormous extinct creature of the bird\r\n  kind, in an island where previously no bird had been known to exist\r\n  larger than a pheasant or a common fowl!--_Lecture on the Moral and\r\n  Intellectual Development of the present Age._[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE MAESTRICHT SAURIAN FOSSIL” A FRAUD.\r\n\r\nIn 1795, there was stated to have been discovered in the stone quarries\r\nadjoining Maestricht the remains of the gigantic _Mosœsaurus_ (Saurian\r\nof the Meuse), an aquatic reptile about twenty-five feet long, holding\r\nan intermediate place between the Monitors and Iguanas. It appears\r\nto have had webbed feet, and a tail of such construction as to have\r\nserved for a powerful oar, and enabled the animal to stem the waves of\r\nthe ocean, of which Cuvier supposed it to have been an inhabitant. It\r\nis thus referred to by Dr. Mantell, in his _Medals of Creation_: “A\r\nspecimen, with the jaws and bones of the palate, now in the Museum at\r\nParis, has long been celebrated; and is still the most precious relic\r\nof this extinct reptile hitherto discovered.” An admirable cast of this\r\nspecimen is preserved in the British Museum, in a case near the bones\r\nof the Iguanodon. This is, however, useless, as Cuvier is proved to\r\nhave been imposed upon in the matter.\r\n\r\n  M. Schlegel has reported to the French Academy of Sciences, that\r\n  he has ascertained beyond all doubt that the famous fossil saurian\r\n  of the quarries of Maestricht, described as a wonderful curiosity\r\n  by Cuvier, is nothing more than an impudent fraud. Some bold\r\n  impostor, it seems, in order to make money, placed a quantity of\r\n  bones in the quarries in such a way as to give them the appearance\r\n  of having been recently dug up, and then passed them off as\r\n  specimens of antediluvian creation. Being successful in this, he\r\n  went the length of arranging a number of bones so as to represent\r\n  an entire skeleton; and had thus deceived the learned Cuvier. In\r\n  extenuation of Cuvier’s credulity, it is stated that the bones were\r\n  so skilfully coloured as to make them look of immense antiquity,\r\n  and he was not allowed to touch them lest they should crumble to\r\n  pieces. But when M. Schlegel subjected them to rude handling, he\r\n  found that they were comparatively modern, and that they were\r\n  placed one by the other without that profound knowledge of anatomy\r\n  which was to have been expected from the man bold enough to execute\r\n  such an audacious fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE OLDEST PIECE OF WOOD UPON EARTH.”\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable vegetable relic which the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\nhas given us is a small fragment of a coniferous tree of the Araucarian\r\nfamily, which formed one of the chief ornaments of the late Hugh\r\nMiller’s museum, and to which he used to point as the oldest piece\r\nof wood upon earth. He found it in one of the ichthyolite beds of\r\nCromarty, and thus refers to it in his _Testimony of the Rocks_:\r\n\r\n  On what perished land of the early paleozoic ages did this\r\n  venerably antique tree cast root and flourish, when the extinct\r\n  genera Pterichthys and Coccoeteus were enjoying life by millions\r\n  in the surrounding seas, long ere the flora or fauna of the coal\r\n  measures had begun to be?\r\n\r\n  The same nodule which enclosed this lignite contained part of\r\n  another fossil, the well-marked scales of _Diplacanthus striatus_,\r\n  an ichthyolite restricted to the Lower Old Red Sandstone\r\n  exclusively. If there be any value in paleontological evidence,\r\n  this Cromarty lignite must have been deposited in a sea inhabited\r\n  by the Coccoeteus and Diplacanthus. It is demonstrable that, while\r\n  yet in a recent state, a Diplacanthus lay down and died beside it;\r\n  and the evidence in the case is unequivocally this, that in the\r\n  oldest portion of the oldest terrestrial flora yet known there\r\n  occurs the fragment of a tree quite as high in the scale as the\r\n  stately Norfolk-Island pine or the noble cedar of Lebanon.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO FOSSIL ROSE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Agassiz, in a lecture upon the trees of America, states a\r\nremarkable fact in regard to the family of the rose,--which includes\r\namong its varieties not only many of the most beautiful flowers, but\r\nalso the richest fruits, as the apple, pear, peach, plum, apricot,\r\ncherry, strawberry, raspberry, &c.,--namely, that _no fossil plants\r\nbelonging to this family have ever been discovered by geologists_! This\r\nM. Agassiz regards as conclusive evidence that the introduction of this\r\nfamily of plants upon the earth was coeval with, or subsequent to, the\r\ncreation of man, to whose comfort and happiness they seem especially\r\ndesigned by a wise Providence to contribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES ON THE EARTH’S SURFACE.\r\n\r\nIn the Imperial Library at Paris is preserved a manuscript work by\r\nan Arabian writer, Mohammed Karurini, who flourished in the seventh\r\ncentury of the Hegira, or at the close of the thirteenth century of\r\nour era. Herein we find several curious remarks on aerolites and\r\nearthquakes, and the successive changes of position which the land and\r\nsea have undergone. Of the latter class is the following beautiful\r\npassage from the narrative of Khidz, an allegorical personage:\r\n\r\n  I passed one day by a very ancient and wonderfully populous city,\r\n  and asked one of its inhabitants how long it had been founded. “It\r\n  is indeed a mighty city,” replied he; “we know not how long it\r\n  has existed, and our ancestors were on this subject as ignorant\r\n  as ourselves.” Five centuries afterwards, as I passed by the same\r\n  place, I could not perceive the slightest vestige of the city. I\r\n  demanded of a peasant who was gathering herbs upon its former site\r\n  how long it had been destroyed. “In sooth, a strange question,”\r\n  replied he; “the ground here has never been different from what you\r\n  now behold it.” “Was there not of old,” said I, “a splendid city\r\n  here?” “Never,” answered he, “so far as we have seen; and never\r\n  did our fathers speak to us of any such.” On my return there five\r\n  hundred years afterwards, _I found the sea in the same place_; and\r\n  on its shores were a party of fishermen, of whom I inquired how\r\n  long the land had been covered by the waters. “Is this a question,”\r\n  say they, “for a man like you? This spot has always been what it is\r\n  now.” I again returned five hundred years afterwards; the sea had\r\n  disappeared: I inquired of a man who stood alone upon the spot how\r\n  long this change had taken place, and he gave me the same answer as\r\n  I had received before. Lastly, on coming back again after an equal\r\n  lapse of time, I found there a flourishing city, more populous and\r\n  more rich in beautiful buildings than the city I had seen the first\r\n  time; and when I would fain have informed myself concerning its\r\n  origin, the inhabitants answered me, “Its rise is lost in remote\r\n  antiquity: we are ignorant how long it has existed, and our fathers\r\n  were on this subject as ignorant as ourselves.”\r\n\r\nThis striking passage was quoted in the _Examiner_, in 1834. Surely in\r\nthis fragment of antiquity we trace the “geological changes” of modern\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL TIME.\r\n\r\nMany ingenious calculations have been made to approximate the dates\r\nof certain geological events; but these, it must be confessed, are\r\nmore amusing than instructive. For example, so many inches of silt are\r\nyearly laid down in the delta of the Mississippi--how many centuries\r\nwill it have taken to accumulate a thickness of 30, 60, or 100 feet?\r\nAgain, the ledges of Niagara are wasting at the rate of so many feet\r\nper century--how many years must the river have taken to cut its way\r\nback from Queenstown to the present Falls? Again, lavas and melted\r\nbasalts cool, according to the size of the mass, at the rate of so many\r\ndegrees in a given time--how many millions of years must have elapsed,\r\nsupposing an original igneous condition of the earth, before its crust\r\nhad attained a state of solidity? or further, before its surface had\r\ncooled down to the present mean temperature? For these and similar\r\ncomputations, the student will at once perceive we want the necessary\r\nuniformity of factor; and until we can bring elements of calculation as\r\nexact as those of astronomy to bear on geological chronology, it will\r\nbe better to regard our “eras” and “epochs” and “systems” as so many\r\nterms, indefinite in their duration, but sufficient for the magnitude\r\nof the operations embraced within their limits.--_Advanced Textbook of\r\nGeology, by David Page, F.G.S._\r\n\r\nM. Rozet, in 1841, called attention to the fact, that the causes which\r\nhave produced irregularities in the structure of the globe have not yet\r\nceased to act, as is proved by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, slow\r\nand continuous movements of the crust of the earth in certain regions,\r\n&c. We may, therefore, yet see repeated the great catastrophes which\r\nthe surface of the earth has undergone anteriorly to the historical\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the British Association in 1855, Mr. Hopkins excited\r\nmuch controversy by his startling speculation--that 9000 years ago\r\nthe site on which London now stands was in the torrid zone; and that,\r\naccording to perpetual changes in progress, the whole of England would\r\nin time arrive within the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCURIOUS CAUSE OF CHANGE OF LEVEL.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hennessey, in 1857, _found the entire mass of rock and\r\nhill on which the Armagh Observatory is erected to be slightly, but\r\nto an astronomer quite perceptibly, tilted or canted, at one season\r\nto the east, at another to the west_. This he at first attributed to\r\nthe varying power of the sun’s radiation to heat and expand the rock\r\nthroughout the year; but he subsequently had reason to attribute it\r\nrather to the infiltration of water to the parts where the clay-slate\r\nand limestone rocks met, the varying quantity of the water exerting\r\na powerful hydrostatic energy by which the position of the rock is\r\nslightly varied.\r\n\r\nNow Armagh and its observatory stand at the junction of the mountain\r\nlimestone with the clay-slate, having, as it were, one leg on the\r\nformer and the other on the latter; and both rocks probably reach\r\ndownwards 1000 or 2000 feet. When rain falls, the one will absorb\r\nmore water than the other; both will gain an increase of conductive\r\npower; but the one which has absorbed most water will have the greatest\r\nincrease, and being thus the better conductor, will _draw a greater\r\nportion of heat from the hot nucleus below to the surface_--will\r\nbecome, in fact, temporarily hotter, and, as a consequence, _expand\r\nmore than the other_. In a word, _both rocks will expand at the wet\r\nseason; but the best conductor, or most absorbent rock, will expand\r\nmost, and seem to tilt the hill to one side; at the dry season it will\r\nsubside most, and the hill will seem to be tilted in the opposite\r\ndirection_.\r\n\r\nThe fact is curious, and not less so are the results deducible from\r\nit. First, hills are higher at one season than another; a fact we\r\nmight have supposed, but never could have ascertained by measurement.\r\nSecondly, they are highest, not, as we should have supposed, at the\r\nhottest season, but at the wettest. Thirdly, it is from the _different\r\nrates_ of expansion of different rocks that this has been discovered.\r\nFourthly, it is by converse with the _heavens_ that it has been made\r\nknown to us. A variation of probably half a second, or less, in the\r\nright ascension of three or four stars, observed at different seasons,\r\nno doubt revealed the fact to the sagacious astronomer of Armagh, and\r\neven enabled him to divine its cause.\r\n\r\n  Professor Hennessey observes in connection with this phenomenon,\r\n  that a very small change of ellipticity would suffice to lay\r\n  bare or submerge extensive tracts of the globe. If, for example,\r\n  the mean ellipticity of the ocean increased from 1/300 to 1/299,\r\n  the level of the sea would be raised at the equator by about 228\r\n  feet, while under the parallel of 52° it would be depressed by\r\n  196 feet. Shallow seas and banks in the latitudes of the British\r\n  isles, and between them and the pole, would thus be converted into\r\n  dry land, while low-lying plains and islands near the equator\r\n  would be submerged. If similar phenomena occurred during early\r\n  periods of geological history, they would manifestly influence the\r\n  distribution of land and water during these periods; and with such\r\n  a direction of the forces as that referred to, they would tend to\r\n  increase the proportion of land in the polar and temperate regions\r\n  of the earth, as compared with the equatorial regions during\r\n  successive geological epochs. Such maps as those published by Sir\r\n  Charles Lyell on the distribution of land and water in Europe\r\n  during the Tertiary period, and those of M. Elie de Beaumont,\r\n  contained in Beaudant’s _Geology_, would, if sufficiently extended,\r\n  assist in verifying or disproving these views.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLINES OF CONTINENTS NOT FIXED.\r\n\r\nContinents (says M. Agassiz) are only a patchwork formed by the\r\nemergence and subsidence of land. These processes are still going on\r\nin various parts of the globe. Where the shores of the continent are\r\nabrupt and high, the effect produced may be slight, as in Norway and\r\nSweden, where a gradual elevation is going on without much alteration\r\nin their outlines. But if the continent of North America were to be\r\ndepressed 1000 feet, nothing would remain of it except a few islands,\r\nand any elevation would add vast tracts to its shores.\r\n\r\nThe west of Asia, comprising Palestine and the country about Ararat and\r\nthe Caspian Sea, is below the level of the ocean, and a rent in the\r\nmountain-chains by which it is surrounded would transform it into a\r\nvast gulf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorological Phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nA philosopher of the East, with a richness of imagery truly oriental,\r\ndescribes the Atmosphere as “a spherical shell which surrounds our\r\nplanet to a depth which is unknown to us, by reason of its growing\r\ntenuity, as it is released from the pressure of its own superincumbent\r\nmass. Its upper surface cannot be nearer to us than 50, and can\r\nscarcely be more remote than 500, miles. It surrounds us on all sides,\r\nyet we see it not; it presses on us with a load of fifteen pounds on\r\nevery square inch of surface of our bodies, or from seventy to one\r\nhundred tons on us in all, yet we do not so much as feel its weight.\r\nSofter than the softest down, more impalpable than the finest gossamer,\r\nit leaves the cobweb undisturbed, and scarcely stirs the lightest\r\nflower that feeds on the dew it supplies; yet it bears the fleets of\r\nnations on its wings around the world, and crushes the most refractory\r\nsubstances with its weight. When in motion, its force is sufficient to\r\nlevel the most stately forests and stable buildings with the earth--to\r\nraise the waters of the ocean into ridges like mountains, and dash the\r\nstrongest ships to pieces like toys. It warms and cools by turns the\r\nearth and the living creatures that inhabit it. It draws up vapours\r\nfrom the sea and land, retains them dissolved in itself or suspended\r\nin cisterns of clouds, and throws them down again as rain or dew when\r\nthey are required. It bends the rays of the sun from their path to\r\ngive us the twilight of evening and of dawn; it disperses and refracts\r\ntheir various tints to beautify the approach and the retreat of the orb\r\nof day. But for the atmosphere sunshine would burst on us and fail us\r\nat once, and at once remove us from midnight darkness to the blaze of\r\nnoon. We should have no twilight to soften and beautify the landscape;\r\nno clouds to shade us from the searching heat; but the bald earth, as\r\nit revolved on its axis, would turn its tanned and weakened front to\r\nthe full and unmitigated rays of the lord of day. It affords the gas\r\nwhich vivifies and warms our frames, and receives into itself that\r\nwhich has been polluted by use and is thrown off as noxious. It feeds\r\nthe flames of life exactly as it does that of the fire--it is in both\r\ncases consumed and affords the food of consumption--in both cases it\r\nbecomes combined with charcoal, which requires it for combustion and is\r\nremoved by it when this is over.”\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIVERSALITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nIt is only the girdling, encircling air that flows above and around all\r\nthat makes the whole world kin. The carbonic acid with which to-day\r\nour breathing fills the air, to-morrow makes its way round the world.\r\nThe date-trees that grow round the falls of the Nile will drink it in\r\nby their leaves; the cedars of Lebanon will take of it to add to their\r\nstature; the cocoa-nuts of Tahiti will grow rapidly upon it; and the\r\npalms and bananas of Japan will change it into flowers. The oxygen we\r\nare breathing was distilled for us some short time ago by the magnolias\r\nof the Susquehanna; the great trees that skirt the Orinoco and the\r\nAmazon, the giant rhododendrons of the Himalayas, contributed to it,\r\nand the roses and myrtles of Cashmere, the cinnamon-tree of Ceylon, and\r\nthe forest, older than the Flood, buried deep in the heart of Africa,\r\nfar behind the Mountains of the Moon. The rain we see descending was\r\nthawed for us out of the icebergs which have watched the polar star for\r\nages; and the lotus-lilies have soaked up from the Nile, and exhaled as\r\nvapour, snows that rested on the summits of the Alps.--_North-British\r\nReview._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nThe differences existing between that which appertains to the air\r\nof heaven (the realms of universal space) and that which belongs to\r\nthe strata of our terrestrial atmosphere are very striking. It is\r\nnot possible, as well-attested facts prove, perfectly to explain\r\nthe operations at work in the much-contested upper boundaries of\r\nour atmosphere. The extraordinary lightness of whole nights in the\r\nyear 1831, during which small print might be read at midnight in\r\nthe latitudes of Italy and the north of Germany, is a fact directly\r\nat variance with all we know according to the researches on the\r\ncrepuscular theory and the height of the atmosphere. The phenomena\r\nof light depend upon conditions still less understood; and their\r\nvariability at twilight, as well as in the zodiacal light, excite our\r\nastonishment. Yet the atmosphere which surrounds the earth is not\r\nthicker in proportion to the bulk of our globe than the line of a\r\ncircle two inches in diameter when compared with the space which it\r\nencloses, or the down on the skin of a peach in comparison with the\r\nfruit inside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOURS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nPure air is blue, because, according to Newton, the molecules of the\r\nair have the thickness necessary to reflect blue rays. When the sky\r\nis not perfectly pure, and the atmosphere is blended with perceptible\r\nvapours, the diffused light is mixed with a large proportion of\r\nwhite. As the moon is yellow, the blue of the air assumes somewhat\r\nof a greenish tinge, or, in other words, becomes blended with\r\nyellow.--_Letter from Arago to Humboldt_; _Cosmos_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTY OF TWILIGHT.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is caused by the refraction of solar light enabling\r\nit to diffuse itself gradually over our hemisphere, obscured by the\r\nshades of night, long before the sun appears, even when that luminary\r\nis eighteen degrees below our horizon. It is towards the poles that\r\nthis reflected splendour of the great luminary is longest visible,\r\noften changing the whole of the night into a magic day, of which the\r\ninhabitants of southern Europe can form no adequate conception.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW PASCAL WEIGHED THE ATMOSPHERE.\r\n\r\nPascal’s treatise on the weight of the whole mass of air forms the\r\nbasis of the modern science of Pneumatics. In order to prove that the\r\nmass of air presses by its weight on all the bodies which it surrounds,\r\nand also that it is elastic and compressible, he carried a balloon,\r\nhalf-filled with air, to the top of the Puy de Dome, a mountain about\r\n500 toises above Clermont, in Auvergne. It gradually inflated itself\r\nas it ascended, and when it reached the summit it was quite full,\r\nand swollen as if fresh air had been blown into it; or, what is the\r\nsame thing, it swelled in proportion as the weight of the column of\r\nair which pressed upon it was diminished. When again brought down it\r\nbecame more and more flaccid, and when it reached the bottom it resumed\r\nits original condition. In the nine chapters of which the treatise\r\nconsists, Pascal shows that all the phenomena and effects hitherto\r\nascribed to the horror of a vacuum arise from the weight of the mass\r\nof air; and after explaining the variable pressure of the atmosphere\r\nin different localities and in its different states, and the rise of\r\nwater in pumps, he calculates that the whole mass of air round our\r\nglobe weighs 8,983,889,440,000,000,000 French pounds.--_North-British\r\nReview_, No. 2.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, from many indications, that the greatest height at\r\nwhich visible clouds _ever exist_ does not exceed ten miles; at which\r\nheight the density of the air is about an eighth part of what it is at\r\nthe level of the sea.--_Sir John Herschel._\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS OF CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nHistory informs us that many of the countries of Europe which now\r\npossess very mild winters, at one time experienced severe cold during\r\nthis season of the year. The Tiber, at Rome, was often frozen over, and\r\nsnow at one time lay for forty days in that city. The Euxine Sea was\r\nfrozen over every winter during the time of Ovid, and the rivers Rhine\r\nand Rhone used to be frozen over so deep that the ice sustained loaded\r\nwagons. The waters of the Tiber, Rhine, and Rhone, now flow freely\r\nevery winter; ice is unknown in Rome, and the waves of the Euxine dash\r\ntheir wintry foam uncrystallised upon the rocks. Some have ascribed\r\nthese climate changes to agriculture--the cutting down of dense\r\nforests, the exposing of the unturned soil to the summer’s sun, and the\r\ndraining of great marshes. We do not believe that such great changes\r\ncould be produced on the climate of any country by agriculture; and we\r\nare certain that no such theory can account for the contrary change of\r\nclimate--from warm to cold winters--which history tells us has taken\r\nplace in other countries than those named. Greenland received its name\r\nfrom the emerald herbage which once clothed its valleys and mountains;\r\nand its east coast, which is now inaccessible on account of perpetual\r\nice heaped upon its shores, was in the eleventh century the seat of\r\nflourishing Scandinavian colonies, all trace of which is now lost. Cold\r\nLabrador was named Vinland by the Northmen, who visited it A.D. 1000,\r\nand were charmed with its then mild climate. The cause of these changes\r\nis an important inquiry.--_Scientific American._\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE CLIMATES.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the numerous and rapid changes which take place in\r\nour climate, it is a remarkable fact, that _the mean temperature of\r\na place remains nearly the same_. The winter may be unusually cold,\r\nor the summer unusually hot, while the mean temperature has varied\r\neven less than a degree. A very warm summer is therefore likely to\r\nbe accompanied with a cold winter; and in general, if we have any\r\nlong period of cold weather, we may expect a similar period at a\r\nhigher temperature. In general, however, in the same locality the\r\nrelative distribution over summer and winter undergoes comparatively\r\nsmall variations; therefore every point of the globe has an average\r\nclimate, though it is occasionally disturbed by different atmospheric\r\nchanges.--_North-British Review_, No. 49.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINEST CLIMATE IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nHumboldt regards the climate of the Caspian Sea as the most salubrious\r\nin the world: here he found the most delicious fruits that he saw\r\nduring his travels; and such was the purity of the air, that polished\r\nsteel would not tarnish even by night exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUREST ATMOSPHERES.\r\n\r\nThe cloudless purity and transparency of the atmosphere, which last\r\nfor eight months at Santiago, in Chili, are so great, that Lieutenant\r\nGilliss, with the first telescope ever constructed in America, having\r\na diameter of seven inches, was clearly able to recognise the sixth\r\nstar in the trapezium of Orion. If we are to rely upon the statements\r\nof the Rev. Mr. Stoddart, an American missionary, Oroomiah, in Persia,\r\nseems to be, in so far as regards the transparency of the atmosphere,\r\nthe most suitable place in the world for an astronomical observatory.\r\nWriting to Sir John Herschel from that country, he mentions that he\r\nhas been enabled to distinguish with the naked eye the satellites\r\nof Jupiter, the crescent of Venus, the rings of Saturn, and the\r\nconstituent members of several double stars.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-BREEZES AND LAND-BREEZES ILLUSTRATED.\r\n\r\nWhen a fire is kindled on the hearth, we may, if we will observe the\r\nmotes floating in the room, see that those nearest the chimney are the\r\nfirst to feel the draught and to obey it,--they are drawn into the\r\nblaze. The circle of inflowing air is gradually enlarged, until it is\r\nscarcely perceived in the remote parts of the room. Now the land is the\r\nhearth, the rays of the sun the fire, and the sea, with its cool and\r\ncalm air, the room; and thus we have at our firesides the sea-breeze in\r\nminiature.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun goes down, the fire ceases; then the dry land commences\r\nto give off its surplus heat by radiation, so that by nine or ten\r\no’clock it and the air above it are cooled below the sea temperature.\r\nThe atmosphere on the land thus becomes heavier than that on the\r\nsea, and consequently there is a wind seaward, which we call the\r\nland-breeze.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERIOR SALUBRITY OF THE WEST.\r\n\r\nAll large cities and towns have their best districts in the West;[38]\r\nwhich choice the French _savans_, Pelouze, Pouillet, Boussingault, and\r\nElie de Beaumont, attribute to the law of atmospheric pressure. “When,”\r\nsay they, “the barometric column rises, smoke and pernicious emanations\r\nrapidly evaporate in space.” On the contrary, smoke and noxious vapours\r\nremain in apartments, and on the surface of the soil. Now, of all\r\nwinds, that which causes the greatest ascension of the barometric\r\ncolumn is the east; and that which lowers it most is the west. When the\r\nlatter blows, it carries with it to the eastern parts of the town all\r\nthe deleterious gases from the west; and thus the inhabitants of the\r\neast have to support their own smoke and miasma, and those brought by\r\nwestern winds. When, on the contrary, the east wind blows, it purifies\r\nthe air by causing to ascend the pernicious emanations which it cannot\r\ndrive to the west. Consequently, the inhabitants of the west receive\r\npure air, from whatever part of the horizon it may arrive; and as the\r\nwest winds are most prevalent, they are the first to receive the air\r\npure, and as it arrives from the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILISATION OF CLOUDS.\r\n\r\nAs the navigator cruises in the Pacific Ocean among the islands of\r\nthe trade-wind region, he sees gorgeous piles of cumuli, heaped up in\r\nfleecy masses, not only capping the island hills, but often overhanging\r\nthe lowest islet of the tropics, and even standing above coral patches\r\nand hidden reefs; “a cloud by day.” to serve as a beacon to the lonely\r\nmariner out there at sea, and to warn him of shoals and dangers which\r\nno lead nor seaman’s eye has ever seen or sounded. These clouds, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, may be seen gathering above the low coral\r\nisland, preparing it for vegetation and fruitfulness in a very striking\r\nmanner. As they are condensed into showers, one fancies that they are\r\na sponge of the most exquisite and delicately elaborated material, and\r\nthat he can see, as they “drop down their fatness,” the invisible but\r\nbountiful hand aloft that is pressing and squeezing it out.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nBAROMETRIC MEASUREMENT.\r\n\r\nWe must not place too implicit a dependence on Barometrical\r\nMeasurements. Ermann in Siberia, and Ross in the Antarctic Seas, have\r\ndemonstrated the existence of localities on the earth’s surface where\r\na permanent depression of the barometer prevails to the astonishing\r\nextent of nearly an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIGANTIC BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Exhibition Building of 1851 was a colossal Barometer, the\r\ntube and scale reaching from the floor of the gallery nearly to the top\r\nof the building, and the rise and fall of the indicating fluid being\r\nmarked by feet instead of by tenths of inches. The column of mercury,\r\nsupported by the pressure of the atmosphere, communicated with a\r\nperpendicular tube of smaller bore, which contained a coloured fluid\r\nmuch lighter than mercury. When a diminution of atmospheric pressure\r\noccurred, the mercury in the large tube descended, and by its fall\r\nforced up the coloured fluid in the smaller tube; the fall of the one\r\nbeing indicated in a magnified ratio by the rise in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATMOSPHERE COMPARED TO A STEAM-ENGINE.\r\n\r\nIn this comparison, by Lieut. Maury, the South Seas themselves, in all\r\ntheir vast intertropical extent, are the boiler for the engine, and the\r\nnorthern hemisphere is its condenser. The mechanical power exerted by\r\nthe air and the sun in lifting water from the earth, in transporting\r\nit from one place to another, and in letting it down again, is\r\ninconceivably great. The utilitarian who compares the water-power that\r\nthe Falls of Niagara would afford if applied to machinery is astonished\r\nat the number of figures which are required to express its equivalent\r\nin horse-power. Yet what is the horse-power of the Niagara, falling\r\na few steps, in comparison with the horse-power that is required to\r\nlift up as high as the clouds and let down again all the water that is\r\ndischarged into the sea, not only by this river, but by all the other\r\nrivers in the world? The calculation has been made by engineers; and\r\naccording to it, the force of making and lifting vapour from each area\r\nof one acre that is included on the surface of the earth, is equal to\r\nthe power of thirty horses; and for the whole of the earth, it is 800\r\ntimes greater than all the water-power in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THE RAIN-MAKING VAPOUR GET FROM THE SOUTHERN INTO THE NORTHERN\r\nHEMISPHERE?\r\n\r\nThis comes with such regularity, that our rivers never go dry, and\r\nour springs fail not, because of the exact _compensation_ of the\r\ngrand machine of _the atmosphere_. It is exquisitely and wonderfully\r\ncounterpoised. Late in the autumn of the north, throughout its\r\nwinter, and in early spring, the sun is pouring his rays with the\r\ngreatest intensity down upon the seas of the southern hemisphere; and\r\nthis powerful engine, which we are contemplating, is pumping up the\r\nwater there with the greatest activity; at the same time, the mean\r\ntemperature of the entire southern hemisphere is about 10° higher than\r\nthe northern. The heat which this heavy evaporation absorbs becomes\r\nlatent, and with the moisture is carried through the upper regions\r\nof the atmosphere until it reaches our climates. Here the vapour is\r\nformed into clouds, condensed and precipitated; the heat which held\r\ntheir water in the state of vapour is set free, and becomes sensible\r\nheat; and it is that which contributes so much to temper our winter\r\nclimate. It clouds up in winter, turns warm, and we say we are going\r\nto have falling weather: that is because the process of condensation\r\nhas already commenced, though no rain or snow may have fallen. Thus we\r\nfeel this southern heat, that has been collected by the rays of the sun\r\nby the sea, been bottled away by the winds in the clouds of a southern\r\nsummer, and set free in the process of condensation in our northern\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThus the South Seas should supply mainly the water for the engine just\r\ndescribed, while the northern hemisphere condenses it; we should,\r\ntherefore, have more rain in the northern hemisphere. The rivers tell\r\nus that we have, at least on the land; for the great water-courses of\r\nthe globe, and half the fresh water in the world, are found on the\r\nnorth side of the equator. This fact is strongly corroborative of this\r\nhypothesis. To evaporate water enough annually from the ocean to cover\r\nthe earth, on the average, five feet deep with rain; to transport it\r\nfrom one zone to another; and to precipitate it in the right places at\r\nsuitable times and in the proportions due,--is one of the offices of\r\nthe grand atmospherical machine. This water is evaporated principally\r\nfrom the torrid zone. Supposing it all to come thence, we shall have\r\nencircling the earth a belt of ocean 3000 miles in breadth, from which\r\nthis atmosphere evaporates a layer of water annually sixteen feet in\r\ndepth. And to hoist up as high as the clouds, and lower down again,\r\nall the water, in a lake sixteen feet deep and 3000 miles broad and\r\n24,000 long, is the yearly business of this invisible machinery. What a\r\npowerful engine is the atmosphere! and how nicely adjusted must be all\r\nthe cogs and wheels and springs and _compensations_ of this exquisite\r\npiece of machinery, that it never wears out nor breaks down, nor fails\r\nto do its work at the right time and in the right way!--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF RAIN.\r\n\r\nTo understand the philosophy of this beautiful and often sublime\r\nphenomenon, a few facts derived from observation and a long train of\r\nexperiments must be remembered.\r\n\r\n  1. Were the atmosphere every where at all times at a uniform\r\n  temperature, we should never have rain, or hail, or snow. The water\r\n  absorbed by it in evaporation from the sea and the earth’s surface\r\n  would descend in an imperceptible vapour, or cease to be absorbed\r\n  by the air when it was once fully saturated.\r\n\r\n  2. The absorbing power of the atmosphere, and consequently its\r\n  capability to retain humidity, is proportionally greater in warm\r\n  than in cold air.\r\n\r\n  3. The air near the surface of the earth is warmer than it is in\r\n  the region of the clouds. The higher we ascend from the earth, the\r\n  colder do we find the atmosphere. Hence the perpetual snow on very\r\n  high mountains in the hottest climate.\r\n\r\nNow when, from continued evaporation, the air is highly saturated\r\nwith vapour, though it be invisible and the sky cloudless, if its\r\ntemperature is suddenly reduced by cold currents descending from\r\nabove or rushing from a higher to a lower latitude, its capacity to\r\nretain moisture is diminished, clouds are formed, and the result is\r\nrain. Air condenses as it cools, and, like a sponge filled with water\r\nand compressed, pours out the water which its diminished capacity\r\ncannot hold. What but Omniscience could have devised such an admirable\r\narrangement for watering the earth?\r\n\r\n\r\nINORDINATE RAINY CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the Khasia mountains, which lie north-east from\r\nCalcutta, and are separated by the valley of the Burrampooter River\r\nfrom the Himalaya range, is remarkable for the inordinate fall of\r\nrain--the greatest, it is said, which has ever been recorded. Mr. Yule,\r\nan English gentleman, established that in the single month of August\r\n1841 there fell 264 inches of rain, or 22 feet, of which 12½ feet\r\nfell in the space of five consecutive days. This astonishing fact is\r\nconfirmed by two other English travellers, who measured 30 inches of\r\nrain in twenty-four hours, and during seven months above 500 inches.\r\nThis great rain-fall is attributed to the abruptness of the mountains\r\nwhich face the Bay of Bengal, and the intervening flat swamps 200 miles\r\nin extent. The district of the excessive rain is extremely limited; and\r\nbut a few degrees farther west, rain is said to be almost unknown, and\r\nthe winter falls of snow to seldom exceed two inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THE NORTH WIND DRIVE AWAY RAIN?\r\n\r\nWe may liken it to a wet sponge, and the decrease of temperature\r\nto the hand that squeezes that sponge. Finally, reaching the cold\r\nlatitudes, all the moisture that a dew-point of zero, and even far\r\nbelow, can extract, is wrung from it; and this air then commences “to\r\nreturn according to his circuits” as dry atmosphere. And here we can\r\nquote Scripture again: “The north wind driveth away rain.” This is a\r\nmeteorological fact of high authority and great importance in the study\r\nof the circulation of the atmosphere.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF RAIN-DROPS.\r\n\r\nThe Drops of Rain vary in their size, perhaps from the 25th to the ¼ of\r\nan inch in diameter. In parting from the clouds, they precipitate their\r\ndescent till the increasing resistance opposed by the air becomes equal\r\nto their weight, when they continue to fall with uniform velocity. This\r\nvelocity is, therefore, in a certain ratio to the diameter of the\r\ndrops; hence thunder and other showers in which the drops are large\r\npour down faster than a drizzling rain. A drop of the 25th part of an\r\ninch, in falling through the air, would, when it had arrived at its\r\nuniform velocity, only acquire a celerity of 11½ feet per second; while\r\none of ¼ of an inch would equal a velocity of 33½ feet.--_Leslie._\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINLESS DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the world there is no rain at all. In the Old World\r\nthere are two districts of this kind: the desert of Sahara in Africa,\r\nand in Asia part of Arabia, Syria, and Persia; the other district lies\r\nbetween north latitude 30° and 50°, and between 75° and 118° of east\r\nlongitude, including Thibet, Gobiar Shama, and Mongolia. In the New\r\nWorld the rainless districts are of much less magnitude, occupying two\r\nnarrow strips on the shores of Peru and Bolivia, and on the coast of\r\nMexico and Guatemala, with a small district between Trinidad and Panama\r\non the coast of Venezuela.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THE RAIN IN THE WORLD.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean may be considered as one sheet\r\nof water covering an area quite equal in extent to one half of that\r\nembraced by the whole surface of the earth; and the total annual fall\r\nof rain on the earth’s surface is 186,240 cubic imperial miles. Not\r\nless than three-fourths of the vapour which makes this rain comes from\r\nthis waste of waters; but, supposing that only half of this quantity,\r\nthat is 93,120 cubic miles of rain, falls upon this sea, and that that\r\nmuch at least is taken up from it again as vapour, this would give\r\n255 cubic miles as the quantity of water which is daily lifted up and\r\npoured back again into this expanse. It is taken up at one place,\r\nand rained down at another; and in this process, therefore, we have\r\nagencies for multitudes of partial and conflicting currents, all, in\r\ntheir set strength, apparently as uncertain as the winds.\r\n\r\nThe better to appreciate the operation of such agencies in producing\r\ncurrents in the sea, imagine a district of 255 square miles to be set\r\napart in the midst of the Pacific Ocean as the scene of operations\r\nfor one day; then conceive a machine capable of pumping up in the\r\ntwenty-four hours all the water to the depth of one mile in this\r\ndistrict. The machine must not only pump up and bear off this immense\r\nquantity of water, but it must discharge it again into the sea on the\r\nsame day, but at some other place.\r\n\r\nAll the great rivers of America, Europe, and Asia are lifted up by the\r\natmosphere, and flow in invisible streams back through the air to their\r\nsources among the hills; and through channels so regular, certain, and\r\nwell defined, that the quantity thus conveyed one year with the other\r\nis nearly the same: for that is the quantity which we see running down\r\nto the ocean through these rivers; and the quantity discharged annually\r\nby each river is, as far as we can judge, nearly a constant.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INCH OF RAIN ON THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury thus computes the effect of a single Inch of Rain\r\nfalling upon the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic includes an area of\r\ntwenty-five millions of square miles. Suppose an inch of rain to fall\r\nupon only one-fifth of this vast expanse. It would weigh, says our\r\nauthor, three hundred and sixty thousand millions of tons: and the salt\r\nwhich, as water, it held in solution in the sea, and which, when that\r\nwater was taken up as vapour, was left behind to disturb equilibrium,\r\nweighed sixteen millions more of tons, or nearly twice as much as all\r\nthe ships in the world could carry at a cargo each. It might fall in\r\nan hour, or it might fall in a day; but, occupy what time it might\r\nin falling, this rain is calculated to exert so much force--which is\r\ninconceivably great--in disturbing the equilibrium of the ocean. If\r\nall the water discharged by the Mississippi river during the year were\r\ntaken up in one mighty measure, and cast into the ocean at one effort,\r\nit would not make a greater disturbance in the equilibrium of the\r\nsea than would the fall of rain supposed. And yet so gentle are the\r\noperations of nature, that movements so vast are unperceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EQUATORIAL CLOUD-RING.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the Equatorial Doldrums, the voyager passes a ring of\r\nclouds that encircles the earth, and is stretched around our planet\r\nto regulate the quantity of precipitation in the rain-belt beneath\r\nit; to preserve the due quantum of heat on the face of the earth; to\r\nadjust the winds; and send out for distribution to the four corners\r\nvapours in proper quantities, to make up to each river-basin, climate,\r\nand season, its quota of sunshine, cloud, and moisture. Like the\r\nbalance-wheel of a well-constructed chronometer, this cloud-ring\r\naffords the grand atmospherical machine the most exquisitely arranged\r\n_self-compensation_. Nature herself has hung a thermometer under this\r\ncloud-belt that is more perfect than any that man can construct, and\r\nits indications are not to be mistaken.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE EQUATORIAL DOLDRUMS”\r\n\r\nis another of these calm places. Besides being a region of calms and\r\nbaffling winds, it is a region noted for its rains and clouds, which\r\nmake it one of the most oppressive and disagreeable places at sea. The\r\nemigrant ships from Europe for Australia have to cross it. They are\r\noften baffled in it for two or three weeks; then the children and the\r\npassengers who are of delicate health suffer most. It is a frightful\r\ngraveyard on the wayside to that golden land.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTY OF THE DEW-DROP.\r\n\r\nThe Dew-drop is familiar to every one from earliest infancy. Resting\r\nin luminous beads on the down of leaves, or pendent from the finest\r\nblades of grass, or threaded upon the floating lines of the gossamer,\r\nits “orient pearl” varies in size from the diameter of a small pea to\r\nthe most minute atom that can be imagined to exist. Each of these, like\r\nthe rain-drops, has the properties of reflecting and refracting light;\r\nhence, from so many minute prisms, the unfolded rays of the sun are\r\nsent up to the eye in colours of brilliancy similar to those of the\r\nrainbow. When the sunbeams traverse horizontally a very thickly-bedewed\r\ngrass-plot, these colours arrange themselves so as to form an iris,\r\nor dew-bow; and if we select any one of these drops for observation,\r\nand steadily regard it while we gradually change our position, we\r\nshall find the prismatic colours follow each other in their regular\r\norder.--_Wells._\r\n\r\n\r\nFALL OF DEW IN ONE YEAR.\r\n\r\nThe annual average quantity of Dew deposited in this country is\r\nestimated at a depth of about five inches, being about one-seventh\r\nof the mean quantity of moisture supposed to be received from the\r\natmosphere all over Great Britain in the year; or about 22,161,337,355\r\ntons, taking the ton at 252 imperial gallons.--_Wells._\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADUATED SUPPLY OF DEW TO VEGETATION.\r\n\r\nEach of the different grasses draws from the atmosphere during the\r\nnight a supply of dew to recruit its energies dependent upon its form\r\nand peculiar radiating power. Every flower has a power of radiation\r\nof its own, subject to changes during the day and night, and the\r\ndeposition of moisture on it is regulated by the peculiar law which\r\nthis radiating power obeys; and this power will be influenced by\r\nthe aspect which the flower presents to the sky, unfolding to the\r\ncontemplative mind the most beautiful example of creative wisdom.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nWARMTH OF SNOW IN ARCTIC LATITUDES.\r\n\r\nThe first warm Snows of August and September (says Dr. Kane), falling\r\non a thickly-bleached carpet of grasses, heaths, and willows, enshrine\r\nthe flowery growths which nestle round them in a non-conducting air\r\nchamber; and as each successive snow increases the thickness of the\r\ncover, we have, before the intense cold of winter sets in, a light\r\ncellular bed covered by drift, seven, eight, or ten feet deep, in which\r\nthe plant retains its vitality. Dr. Kane has proved by experiments that\r\nthe conducting power of the snow is proportioned to its compression\r\nby winds, rains, drifts, and congelation. The drifts that accumulate\r\nduring nine months of the year are dispersed in well-defined layers\r\nof different density. We have first the warm cellular snows of fall,\r\nwhich surround the plant; next the finely-impacted snow-dust of winter;\r\nand above these the later humid deposits of spring. In the earlier\r\nsummer, in the inclined slopes that face the sun, as the upper snow is\r\nmelted and sinks upon the more compact layer below it is to a great\r\nextent arrested, and runs off like rain from a slope of clay. The plant\r\nreposes thus in its cellular bed, safe from the rush of waters, and\r\nprotected from the nightly frosts by the icy roof above it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPURITY OF SNOW.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that in ascending mountains difficult breathing is\r\nsooner felt upon snow than upon rock; and M. Boussingault, in his\r\naccount of the ascent of Chimborazo, attributes this to the sensible\r\ndeficiency of oxygen contained in the pores of the snow, which is\r\nexhaled when it melts. The fact that the air absorbed by snow is\r\nimpure, was ascertained by De Saussure, and has been confirmed by\r\nBoussingault’s experiments.--_Quarterly Review_, No. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW PHENOMENON.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dove of Berlin relates, in illustration of the formation of\r\nclouds of Snow over plains situated at a distance from the cooling\r\nsummits of mountains, that on one occasion a large company had gathered\r\nin a ballroom in Sweden. It was one of those icy starlight nights\r\nwhich in that country are so aptly called “iron nights.” The weather\r\nwas clear and cold, and the ballroom was clear and warm; and the heat\r\nwas so great, that several ladies fainted. An officer present tried to\r\nopen a window; but it was frozen fast to the sill. As a last resort, he\r\nbroke a pane of glass; the cold air rushed in, and it _snowed in the\r\nroom_. A minute before all was clear; but the warm air of the room had\r\nsustained an amount of moisture in a transparent condition which it was\r\nnot able to maintain when mixed with the colder air from without. The\r\nvapour was first condensed, and then frozen.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF SNOW IN SIBERIA.\r\n\r\nThere is in Siberia, M. Ermann informs us, an _entire district_ in\r\nwhich during the winter the sky is constantly clear, and where a single\r\nparticle of snow never falls.--_Arago._\r\n\r\n\r\nACCURACY OF THE CHINESE AS OBSERVERS.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful forms of snow-crystals have long since attracted Chinese\r\nobservers; for from a remote period there has been met with in their\r\nconversation and books an axiomatic expression, to the effect that\r\n“snow-flakes are hexagonal,” showing the Chinese to be accurate\r\nobservers of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST HAIL AND STORMS.\r\n\r\nArago relates, that when, in 1847, two small agricultural districts\r\nof Bourgoyne had lost by Hail crops to the value of a million and a\r\nhalf of francs, certain of the proprietors went to consult him on the\r\nmeans of protecting them from like disasters. Resting on the hypothesis\r\nof the electric origin of hail, Arago suggested the discharge of\r\nthe electricity of the clouds by means of balloons communicating by\r\na metallic wire with the soil. This project was not carried out;\r\nbut Arago persisted in believing in the effectiveness of the method\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n  Arago, in his _Meteorological Essays_, inquires whether the firing\r\n  of cannon can dissipate storms. He cites several cases in its\r\n  favour, and others which seem to oppose it; but he concludes by\r\n  recommending it to his successors. Whilst Arago was propounding\r\n  these questions, a person not conversant with science, the poet\r\n  Méry, was collecting facts supporting the view, which he has\r\n  published in his _Paris Futur_. His attention was attracted to the\r\n  firing of cannon to dissipate storms in 1828, whilst an assistant\r\n  in the “Ecole de Tir” at Vincennes. Having observed that there was\r\n  never any rain in the morning of the exercise of firing, he waited\r\n  to examine military records, and found there, as he says, facts\r\n  which justified the expressions of “Le soleil d’Austerlitz,” “Le\r\n  soleil de juillet,” upon the morning of the Revolution of July;\r\n  and he concluded by proposing to construct around Paris twelve\r\n  towers of great height, which he calls “tours imbrifuges,” each\r\n  carrying 100 cannons, which should be discharged into the air on\r\n  the approach of a storm. About this time an incident occurred which\r\n  in nowise confirmed the truth of M. Méry’s theory. The 14th of\r\n  August was a fine day. On the 15th, the fête of the Empire, the\r\n  sun shone out, the cannon thundered all day long, fireworks and\r\n  illuminations were blazing from nine o’clock in the evening. Every\r\n  thing conspired to verify the hypothesis of M. Méry, and chase\r\n  away storms for a long time. But towards eleven in the evening\r\n  a torrent of rain burst upon Paris, in spite of the pretended\r\n  influence of the discharge of cannon, and gave an occasion for the\r\n  mobile Gallic mind to turn its attention in other directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRIFIC HAILSTORM.\r\n\r\nJansen describes, from the log-book of the _Rhijin_, Captain Brandligt,\r\nin the South-Indian Ocean (25° south latitude) a Hurricane, accompanied\r\nby Hail, by which several of the crew were made blind, others had their\r\nfaces cut open, and those who were in the rigging had their clothes\r\ntorn off them. The master of the ship compared the sea “to a hilly\r\nlandscape in winter covered with snow.” Does it not appear as if the\r\n“treasures of the hail” were opened, which were “reserved against the\r\ntime of trouble, against the day of battle and war”?\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WATERSPOUTS ARE FORMED IN THE JAVA SEA.\r\n\r\nAmong the small groups of islands in this sea, in the day and night\r\nthunderstorms, the combat of the clouds appears to make them more\r\nthirsty than ever. In tunnel form, when they can no longer quench their\r\nthirst from the surrounding atmosphere, they descend near the surface\r\nof the sea, and appear to lap the water directly up with their black\r\nmouths. They are not always accompanied by strong winds; frequently\r\nmore than one is seen at a time, whereupon the clouds whence they\r\nproceed disperse, and the ends of the Waterspouts bending over finally\r\ncauses them to break in the middle. They seldom last longer than five\r\nminutes. As they are going away, the bulbous tube, which is as palpable\r\nas that of a thermometer, becomes broader at the base; and little\r\nclouds, like steam from the pipe of a locomotive, are continually\r\nthrown off from the circumference of the spout, and gradually the water\r\nis released, and the cloud whence the spout came again closes its mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD IN HUDSON’S BAY.\r\n\r\nMr. R. M. Ballantyne, in his journal of six years’ residence in the\r\nterritories of the Hudson’s Bay Company, tells us, that for part of\r\nOctober there is sometimes a little warm, or rather thawy, weather; but\r\nafter that, until the following April, the thermometer seldom rises\r\nto the freezing point. In the depth of winter, the thermometer falls\r\nfrom 30° to 40°, 45°, and even 49° _below zero_ of Fahrenheit. This\r\nintense cold is not, however, so much felt as one might suppose; for\r\nduring its continuance the air is perfectly calm. Were the slightest\r\nbreath of wind to rise when the thermometer stands so low, no man could\r\nshow his face to it for a moment. Forty degrees below zero, and quite\r\ncalm, is infinitely preferable to fifteen below, or thereabout, with\r\na strong breeze of wind. Spirit of wine is, of course, the only thing\r\nthat can be used in the thermometer; as mercury, were it exposed to\r\nsuch cold, would remain frozen nearly half the winter. Spirit never\r\nfroze in any cold ever experienced at York Factory, unless when very\r\nmuch adulterated with water; and even then the spirit would remain\r\nliquid in the centre of the mass. Quicksilver easily freezes in this\r\nclimate, and it has frequently been run into a bullet-mould, exposed to\r\nthe cold air till frozen, and in this state rammed down a gun-barrel,\r\nand fired through a thick plank. The average cold may be set down at\r\nabout 15° or 16° below zero, or 48° of frost. The houses at the Bay are\r\nbuilt of wood, with double windows and doors. They are heated by large\r\niron stoves, fed with wood; yet so intense is the cold, that when a\r\nstove has been in places red-hot, a basin of water in the room has been\r\nfrozen solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURITY OF WENHAM-LAKE ICE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Faraday attributes the purity of Wenham-Lake Ice to its being\r\nfree from air-bubbles and from salts. The presence of the first makes\r\nit extremely difficult to succeed in making a lens of English ice which\r\nwill concentrate the solar rays, and readily fire gunpowder; whereas\r\nnothing is easier than to perform this singular feat of igniting\r\na combustible body by aid of a frozen mass if Wenham-Lake ice be\r\nemployed. The absence of salts conduces greatly to the permanence of\r\nthe ice; for where water is so frozen that the salts expelled are still\r\ncontained in air-cavities and cracks, or form thin films between the\r\nlayers of ice, these entangled salts cause the ice to melt at a lower\r\ntemperature than 32°, and the liquefied portions give rise to streams\r\nand currents within the body of the ice which rapidly carry heat to the\r\ninterior. The mass then goes on thawing within as well as without, and\r\nat temperatures below 32°; whereas pure, compact, Wenham-Lake ice can\r\nonly thaw at 32°, and only on the outside of the mass.--_Sir Charles\r\nLyell’s Second Visit to the United States._\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTIC TEMPERATURES.\r\n\r\nDr. Kane, in his Second Arctic Expedition, found the thermometers\r\nbeginning to show unexampled temperature: they ranged from 60° to 70°\r\nbelow zero, and upon the taffrail of the brig 65°. The reduced mean of\r\nthe best spirit-standards gave 67° or 99° below the freezing point of\r\nwater. At these temperatures chloric ether became solid, and chloroform\r\nexhibited a granular pellicle on its surface. Spirit of naphtha froze\r\nat 54°, and the oil of turpentine was solid at 63° and 65°.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. RAE’S ARCTIC EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society was in 1852 most\r\nrightfully awarded to this indefatigable Arctic explorer. His survey of\r\nthe inlet of Boothia, in 1848, was unique in its kind. In Repulse Bay\r\nhe maintained his party on deer, principally shot by himself; and spent\r\nten months of an Arctic winter in a hut of stones, with no other fuel\r\nthan a kind of hay of the _Andromeda tetragona_. Thus he preserved his\r\nmen to execute surveying journeys of 1000 miles in the spring. Later he\r\ntravelled 300 miles on snow-shoes. In a spring journey over the ice,\r\nwith a pound of fat daily for fuel, accompanied by two men only, and\r\ntrusting solely for shelter to snow-houses, which he taught his men to\r\nbuild, he accomplished 1060 miles in thirty-nine days, or twenty-seven\r\nmiles per day, including stoppages,--a feat never equalled in Arctic\r\ntravelling. In the spring journey, and that which followed in the\r\nsummer in boats, 1700 miles were traversed in eighty days. Dr. Rae’s\r\ngreatest sufferings, he once remarked to Sir George Back, arose from\r\nhis being obliged to sleep upon his frozen mocassins in order to thaw\r\nthem for the morning’s use.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF THE ARCTIC CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson, in his history of his Expedition to these regions,\r\ndescribes the power of the sun in a cloudless sky to have been so\r\ngreat, that he was glad to take shelter in the water while the crews\r\nwere engaged on the portages; and he has never felt the direct rays of\r\nthe sun so oppressive as on some occasions in the high latitudes. Sir\r\nJohn observes:\r\n\r\n  The rapid evaporation of both snow and ice in the winter and\r\n  spring, long before the action of the sun has produced the\r\n  slightest thaw or appearance of moisture, is evident by many\r\n  facts of daily occurrence. Thus when a shirt, after being washed,\r\n  is exposed in the open air to a temperature of from 40° to 50°\r\n  below zero, it is instantly rigidly frozen, and may be broken if\r\n  violently bent. If agitated when in this condition by a strong\r\n  wind, it makes a rustling noise like theatrical thunder.\r\n\r\n  In consequence of the extreme dryness of the atmosphere in winter,\r\n  most articles of English manufacture brought to Rupert’s Land are\r\n  shrivelled, bent, and broken. The handles of razors and knives,\r\n  combs, ivory scales, &c., kept in the warm room, are changed in\r\n  this way. The human body also becomes vividly electric from the\r\n  dryness of the skin. One cold night I rose from my bed, and was\r\n  going out to observe the thermometer, with no other clothing than\r\n  my flannel night-dress, when on my hand approaching the iron latch\r\n  of the door, a distinct spark was elicited. Friction of the skin at\r\n  almost all times in winter produced the electric odour.\r\n\r\n  Even at midwinter we had but three hours and a half of daylight.\r\n  On December 20th I required a candle to write at the window at ten\r\n  in the morning. The sun was absent ten days, and its place in the\r\n  heavens at noon was denoted by rays of light shooting into the sky\r\n  above the woods.\r\n\r\n  The moon in the long nights was a most beautiful object, that\r\n  satellite being constantly above the horizon for nearly a fortnight\r\n  together. Venus also shone with a brilliancy which is never\r\n  witnessed in a sky loaded with vapours; and, unless in snowy\r\n  weather, our nights were always enlivened by the beams of the\r\n  aurora.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTENSE HEAT AND COLD OF THE DESERT.\r\n\r\nAmong crystalline bodies, rock-crystal, or silica, is the best\r\nconductor of heat. This fact accounts for the steadiness of temperature\r\nin one set district, and the extremes of Heat and Cold presented by\r\nday and night on such sandy wastes as the Sahara. The sand, which is\r\nfor the most part silica, drinks-in the noon-day heat, and loses it by\r\nnight just as speedily.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the hot winds from the Sahara has been observed\r\nin vessels traversing the Atlantic at a distance of upwards of\r\n1100 geographical miles from the African shores, by the coating of\r\nimpalpable dust upon the sails.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTING POWER OF WINDS.\r\n\r\nThe greatest example of their power is the _sand-flood_ of Africa,\r\nwhich, moving gradually eastward, has overwhelmed all the land capable\r\nof tillage west of the Nile, unless sheltered by high mountains, and\r\nthreatens ultimately to obliterate the rich plain of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHILARATION IN ASCENDING MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\nAt all elevations of from 6000 to 11,000 feet, and not unfrequently\r\nfor even 2000 feet more, the pedestrian enjoys a pleasurable feeling,\r\nimparted by the consciousness of existence, similar to that which is\r\ndescribed as so fascinating by those who have become familiar with the\r\ndesert-life of the East. The body seems lighter, the nervous power\r\ngreater, the appetite is increased; and fatigue, though felt for a\r\ntime, is removed by the shortest repose. Some travellers have described\r\nthe sensation by the impression that they do not actually press the\r\nground, but that the blade of a knife could be inserted between the\r\nsole of the foot and the mountain top.--_Quarterly Review_, No. 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TELL THE APPROACH OF STORMS.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of Storms has been ascertained with accuracy by\r\nvarious indications of the electrical state of the atmosphere. Thus\r\nProfessor Scott, of Sandhurst College, observed in Shetland that\r\ndrinking-glasses, placed in an inverted position upon a shelf in a\r\ncupboard on the ground-floor of Belmont House, occasionally emitted\r\nsounds as if they were tapped with a knife, or raised a little and\r\nthen let fall on the shelf. These sounds preceded wind; and when they\r\noccurred, boats and vessels were immediately secured. The strength of\r\nthe sound is said to be proportioned to the tempest that follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVOLVING STORMS.\r\n\r\nBy the conjoint labours of Mr. Redfield, Colonel Reid, and Mr.\r\nPiddington, on the origin and nature of hurricanes, typhoons, or\r\nrevolving storms, the following important results have been obtained.\r\nTheir existence in moderate latitudes on both sides the equator; their\r\nabsence in the immediate neighbourhood of the equatorial regions; and\r\nthe fact, that while in the northern latitudes these storms revolve\r\nin a direction contrary to the hands of a watch the face of which is\r\nplaced upwards, in the southern latitudes they rotate in the opposite\r\ndirection,--are shown to be so many additions to the long chain of\r\nevidence by which the rotation of the earth as a physical fact is\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPETUS OF A STORM.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sir S. Brown estimates, from experiments made by him at the\r\nextremity of the Brighton-Chain Pier in a heavy south-west gale, that\r\nthe waves impinge on a cylindrical surface one foot high and one foot\r\nin diameter with a force equal to eighty pounds, to which must be added\r\nthat of the wind, which in a violent storm exerts a pressure of forty\r\npounds. He computed the collective impetus of the waves on the lower\r\npart of a lighthouse proposed to be built on the Wolf Rock (exposed\r\nto the most violent storms of the Atlantic), of the surf on the upper\r\npart, and of the wind on the whole, to be equal to 100 tons.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A STORM-GLASS.\r\n\r\nThis instrument consists of a glass tube, sealed at one end, and\r\nfurnished with a brass cap at the other end, through which the air\r\nis admitted by a very small aperture. Nearly fill the tube with the\r\nfollowing solution: camphor, 2½ drams; nitrate of potash, 38 grains;\r\nmuriate of ammonia, 38 grains; water, 9 drams; rectified spirit,\r\n9 drams. Dissolve with heat. At the ordinary temperature of the\r\natmosphere, plumose crystals are formed. On the approach of stormy\r\nweather, these crystals appear compressed into a compact mass at the\r\nbottom of the tube; while during fine weather they assume their plumose\r\ncharacter, and extend a considerable way up the glass. These results\r\ndepend upon the condition of the air, but they are not considered to\r\nafford any reliable indication of approaching weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLENDOUR OF THE AURORA BOREALIS.\r\n\r\nHumboldt thus beautifully describes this phenomenon:\r\n\r\n  The intensity of this light is at times so great, that Lowenörn\r\n  (on June 29, 1786) recognised its coruscation in bright sunshine.\r\n  Motion renders the phenomenon more visible. Round the point in\r\n  the vault of heaven which corresponds to the direction of the\r\n  inclination of the needle the beams unite together to form the\r\n  so-called corona, the crown of the Northern Light, which encircles\r\n  the summit of the heavenly canopy with a milder radiance and\r\n  unflickering emanations of light. It is only in rare instances that\r\n  a perfect crown or circle is formed; but on its completion, the\r\n  phenomenon has invariably reached its maximum, and the radiations\r\n  become less frequent, shorter, and more colourless. The crown, and\r\n  the luminous arches break up; and the whole vault of heaven becomes\r\n  covered with irregularly scattered, broad, faint, almost ashy-gray,\r\n  luminous, immovable patches, which in their turn disappear, leaving\r\n  nothing but a trace of a dark smoke-like segment on the horizon.\r\n  There often remains nothing of the whole spectacle but a white\r\n  delicate cloud with feathery edges, or divided at equal distances\r\n  into small roundish groups like cirro-cumuli.--_Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nAmong many theories of this phenomenon is that of Lieutenant Hooper,\r\nR.N., who has stated to the British Association that he believes “the\r\nAurora Borealis to be no more nor less than the moisture in some\r\nshape (whether dew or vapour, liquid or frozen), illuminated by the\r\nheavenly bodies, either directly, or reflecting their rays from the\r\nfrozen masses around the Pole, or even from the immediately proximate\r\nsnow-clad earth.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nAccording to Arago’s investigations, the evolution of Lightning is of\r\nthree kinds: zigzag, and sharply defined at the edges; in sheets of\r\nlight, illuminating a whole cloud, which seems to open and reveal the\r\nlight within it; and in the form of fire-balls. The duration of the\r\nfirst two kinds scarcely continues the thousandth part of a second; but\r\nthe globular lightning moves much more slowly, remaining visible for\r\nseveral seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS SHEET-LIGHTNING?\r\n\r\nThis electric phenomenon is unaccompanied by thunder, or too distant to\r\nbe heard: when it appears, the whole sky, but particularly the horizon,\r\nis suddenly illuminated with a flickering flash. Philosophers differ\r\nmuch as to its cause. Matteucci supposes it to be produced either\r\nduring evaporation, or evolved (according to Pouillet’s theory) in the\r\nprocess of vegetation; or generated by chemical action in the great\r\nlaboratory of nature, the earth, and accumulated in the lower strata of\r\nthe air in consequence of the ground being an imperfect conductor.\r\n\r\n  Arago and Kamtz, however, consider sheet-lightning as _reflections\r\n  of distant thunderstorms_. Saussure observed sheet-lightning in the\r\n  direction of Geneva, from the Hospice du Grimsel, on the 10th and\r\n  11th of July 1783; while at the same time a terrific thunderstorm\r\n  raged at Geneva. Howard, from Tottenham, near London, on July 31,\r\n  1813, saw sheet-lightning towards the south-east, while the sky was\r\n  bespangled with stars, not a cloud floating in the air; at the same\r\n  time a thunderstorm raged at Hastings, and in France from Calais\r\n  to Dunkirk. Arago supports his opinion, that the phenomenon is\r\n  _reflected lightning_, by the following illustration: In 1803, when\r\n  observations were being made for determining the longitude, M. de\r\n  Zach, on the Brocken, used a few ounces of gunpowder as a signal,\r\n  the flash of which was visible from the Klenlenberg, sixty leagues\r\n  off, although these mountains are invisible from each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF LIGHTNING BY RAIN.\r\n\r\nA sudden gust of rain is almost sure to succeed a violent detonation\r\nimmediately overhead. Mr. Birt, the meteorologist, asks: Is this rain a\r\n_cause_ or _consequence_ of the electric discharge? To this he replies:\r\n\r\n  In the sudden agglomeration of many minute and feebly electrified\r\n  globules into one rain-drop, the quantity of electricity is\r\n  increased in a greater proportion than the surface over which\r\n  (according to the laws of electric distribution) it is spread. By\r\n  tension, therefore, it is increased, and may attain the point when\r\n  it is capable of separating from the _drop_ to seek the surface of\r\n  the _cloud_, or of the newly-formed descending body of rain, which,\r\n  under such circumstances, may be regarded as a conducting medium.\r\n  Arrived at this surface, the tension, for the same reason, becomes\r\n  enormous, and a flash escapes. This theory Mr. Birt has confirmed\r\n  by observation of rain in thunderstorms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVICE OF LIGHTNING-CONDUCTORS.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster relates a remarkable instance of a tree in\r\nClandeboye Park, in a thick mass of wood, and _not the tallest of the\r\ngroup_, being struck by lightning, which passed down the trunk into\r\nthe ground, rending the tree asunder. This shows that an object may be\r\nstruck by lightning in a locality where there are numerous conducting\r\npoints more elevated than itself; and at the same time proves that\r\nlightning cannot be diverted from its course by lofty isolated\r\nconductors, but that the protection of buildings from this species\r\nof meteor can only be effected by conductors stretching out in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman states, that lightning-rods cannot be relied upon\r\nunless they reach the earth where it is permanently wet; and that the\r\nbest security is afforded by carrying the rod, or some good metallic\r\nconductor duly connected with it, to the water in the well, or to some\r\nother water that never fails. The professor’s house, it seems, was\r\nstruck; but his lightning-rods were not more than two or three inches\r\nin the ground, and were therefore virtually of no avail in protecting\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT LIGHTNING-CONDUCTOR.\r\n\r\nHumboldt informs us, that “the most important ancient notice of the\r\nrelations between lightning and conducting metals is that of Ctesias,\r\nin his _Indica_, cap. iv. p. 190. He possessed two iron swords,\r\npresents from the king Artaxerxes Mnemon and from his mother Parasytis,\r\nwhich, when planted in the earth, averted clouds, hail, and _strokes of\r\nlightning_. He had himself seen the operation, for the king had twice\r\nmade the experiment before his eyes.”--_Cosmos_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM PROTECTED FROM LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nWe do not learn, either from the Bible or Josephus, that the Temple\r\nat Jerusalem was ever struck by Lightning during an interval of more\r\nthan a thousand years, from the time of Solomon to the year 70;\r\nalthough, from its situation, it was completely exposed to the violent\r\nthunderstorms of Palestine.\r\n\r\nBy a fortuitous circumstance, the Temple was crowned with\r\nlightning-conductors similar to those which we now employ, and which\r\nwe owe to Franklin’s discovery. The roof, constructed in what we call\r\nthe Italian manner, and covered with boards of cedar, having a thick\r\ncoating of gold, was garnished from end to end with long pointed and\r\ngilt iron or steel lances, which, Josephus says, were intended to\r\nprevent birds from roosting on the roof and soiling it. The walls\r\nwere overlaid throughout with wood, thickly gilt. Lastly, there\r\nwere in the courts of the Temple cisterns, into which the rain from\r\nthe roof was conducted by _metallic pipes_. We have here both the\r\nlightning-rods and a means of conduction so abundant, that Lichtenberg\r\nis quite right in saying that many of the present apparatuses are far\r\nfrom offering in their construction so satisfactory a combination of\r\ncircumstances.--_Abridged from Arago’s Meteorological Essays._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ST. PAUL’S CATHEDRAL IS PROTECTED FROM LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nIn March 1769, the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul’s addressed a letter\r\nto the Royal Society, requesting their opinion as to the best and most\r\neffectual method of fixing electrical conductors on the cathedral. A\r\ncommittee was formed for the purpose, and Benjamin Franklin was one of\r\nthe members; their report was made, and the conductors were fixed as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The seven iron scrolls supporting the ball and cross are connected\r\n  with other rods (used merely as conductors), which unite them\r\n  with several large bars, descending obliquely to the stone-work\r\n  of the lantern, and connected by an iron ring with four other\r\n  iron bars to the lead covering of the great cupola, a distance\r\n  of forty-eight feet; thence the communication is continued by\r\n  the rain-water pipes to the lead-covered roof, and thence by lead\r\n  water-pipes which pass into the earth; thus completing the entire\r\n  communication from the cross to the ground, partly through iron,\r\n  and partly through lead. On the clock-tower a bar of iron connects\r\n  the pine-apple at the top with the iron staircase, and thence with\r\n  the lead on the roof of the church. The bell-tower is similarly\r\n  protected. By these means the metal used in the building is made\r\n  available as conductors; the metal employed merely for that purpose\r\n  being exceedingly small in quantity.--_Curiosities of London._\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIOUS EFFECTS OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nDr. Hibbert tells us that upon the western coast of Scotland and\r\nIreland, Lightning coöperates with the violence of the storm in\r\nshattering solid rocks, and heaping them in piles of enormous\r\nfragments, both on dry land and beneath the water.\r\n\r\nEuler informs us, in his _Letters to a German Princess_, that he\r\ncorresponded with a Moravian priest named Divisch, who assured him\r\nthat he had averted during a whole summer every thunderstorm which\r\nthreatened his own habitation and the neighbourhood, by means of a\r\nmachine constructed upon the principles of electricity; that the\r\nmachinery sensibly attracted the clouds, and constrained them to\r\ndescend quietly in a distillation, without any but a very distant\r\nthunderclap. Euler assures us that “the fact is undoubted, and\r\nconfirmed by irresistible proof.”\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1811, in the village of Phillipsthal, in Eastern\r\nPrussia, an attempt was made to split an immense stone into a multitude\r\nof pieces by means of lightning. A bar of iron, in the form of a\r\nconductor, was previously fixed to the stone; and the experiment was\r\nattended with complete success; for during the very first thunderstorm\r\nthe lightning burst the stone without displacing it.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Duhamel du Monceau says, that lightning, unaccompanied\r\nby thunder, wind, or rain, has the property of breaking oat-stalks. The\r\nfarmers are acquainted with this effect, and say that the lightning\r\nbreaks down the oats. This is a well-received opinion with the farmers\r\nin Devonshire.\r\n\r\nLightning has in some cases the property of reducing solid bodies to\r\nashes, or to pulverisation,--even the human body,--without there being\r\nany signs of heat. The effects of lightning on paralysis are very\r\nremarkable, in some cases curing, in others causing, that disease.\r\n\r\nThe returning stroke of lightning is well known to be due to the\r\nrestoration of the natural electric state, after it has been disturbed\r\nby induction.\r\n\r\n\r\nA THUNDERSTORM SEEN FROM A BALLOON.\r\n\r\nMr. John West, the American aeronaut, in his observations made during\r\nhis numerous ascents, describes a storm viewed from above the clouds\r\nto have the appearance of ebullition. The bulging upper surface of the\r\ncloud resembles a vast sea of boiling and upheaving snow; the noise\r\nof the falling rain is like that of a waterfall over a precipice; the\r\nthunder above the cloud is not loud, and the flashes of lightning\r\nappear like streaks of intensely white fire on a surface of white\r\nvapour. He thus describes a side view of a storm which he witnessed\r\nJune 3, 1852, in his balloon excursion from Portsmouth, Ohio:\r\n\r\n  Although the sun was shining on me, the rain and small hail were\r\n  rattling on the balloon. A rainbow, or prismatically-coloured arch\r\n  or horse-shoe, was reflected against the sun; and as the point of\r\n  observation changed laterally and perpendicularly, the perspective\r\n  of this golden grotto changed its hues and forms. Above and behind\r\n  this arch was going on the most terrific thunder; but no zigzag\r\n  lightning was perceptible, only bright flashes, like explosions\r\n  of “Roman candles” in fireworks. Occasionally there was a zigzag\r\n  explosion in the cloud immediately below, the thunder sounding like\r\n  a _feu-de-joie_ of a rifle-corps. Then an orange-coloured wave of\r\n  light seemed to fall from the upper to the lower cloud; this was\r\n  “still-lightning.” Meanwhile intense electrical action was going\r\n  on _in the balloon_, such as expansion, tremulous tension, lifting\r\n  papers ten feet out of the car below the balloon and then dropping\r\n  them, &c. The close view of this Ohio storm was truly sublime; its\r\n  rushing noise almost appalling.\r\n\r\nAscending from the earth with a balloon, in the rear of a storm, and\r\nmounted up a thousand feet above it, the balloon will soon override the\r\nstorm, and may descend in advance of it. Mr. West has experienced this\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE AERONAUTIC VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nMr. Sadler, the celebrated aeronaut, ascended on one occasion in a\r\nballoon from Dublin, and was wafted across the Irish Channel; when,\r\non his approach to the Welsh coast, the balloon descended nearly to\r\nthe surface of the sea. By this time the sun was set, and the shades\r\nof evening began to close in. He threw out nearly all his ballast,\r\nand suddenly sprang upward to a great height; and by so doing brought\r\nhis horizon to _dip_ below the sun, producing the whole phenomenon\r\nof a western sunrise. Subsequently descending in Wales, he of course\r\nwitnessed a second sunset on the same evening.--_Sir John Herschel’s\r\nOutlines of Astronomy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Geography of the Sea.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATES OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nThe fauna and flora of the Sea are as much the creatures of Climate,\r\nand are as dependent for their well-being upon temperature, as are the\r\nfauna and flora of the dry land. Were it not so, we should find the\r\nfish and the algæ, the marine insect and the coral, distributed equally\r\nand alike in all parts of the ocean; the polar whale would delight in\r\nthe torrid zone; and the habitat of the pearl oyster would be also\r\nunder the iceberg, or in frigid waters colder than the melting ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATION OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nThe coral islands, reefs, and beds with which the Pacific Ocean is\r\nstudded and garnished, were built up of materials which a certain\r\nkind of insect quarried from the sea-water. The currents of the sea\r\nministered to this little insect; they were its _hod-carriers_. When\r\nfresh supplies of solid matter were wanted for the coral rock upon\r\nwhich the foundations of the Polynesian Islands were laid, these\r\nhod-carriers brought them in unfailing streams of sea-water, loaded\r\nwith food and building-materials for the coralline: the obedient\r\ncurrents thread the widest and the deepest sea. Now we know that\r\nits adaptations are suited to all the wants of every one of its\r\ninhabitants,--to the wants of the coral insect as well as those of the\r\nwhale. Hence _we know_ that the sea has its system of circulation: for\r\nit transports materials for the coral rock from one part of the world\r\nto another; its currents receive them from rivers, and hand them over\r\nto the little mason for the structure of the most stupendous works of\r\nsolid masonry that man has ever seen--the coral islands of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nBetween the hottest hour of the day and the coldest hour of the night\r\nthere is frequently a change of four degrees in the Temperature of the\r\nSea. Taking one-fifth of the Atlantic Ocean for the scene of operation,\r\nand the difference of four degrees to extend only ten feet below\r\nthe surface, the total and absolute change made in such a mass of\r\nsea-water, by altering its temperature two degrees, is equivalent to a\r\nchange in its volume of 390,000,000 cubic feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENCY OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glynn, U.S.N., has made some interesting observations, ranging\r\nover 200° of latitude, in different oceans, in very high latitudes,\r\nand near the equator. His apparatus was simple: a common white\r\ndinner-plate, slung so as to lie in the water horizontally, and sunk\r\nby an iron pot with a line. Numbering the fathoms at which the plate\r\nwas visible below the surface, Captain Glynn saw it on two occasions,\r\nat the maximum, twenty-five fathoms (150 feet) deep; the water was\r\nextraordinarily clear, and to lie in the boat and look down was like\r\nlooking down from the mast-head; and the objects were clearly defined\r\nto a great depth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASIN OF THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nIn its entire length, the basin of this sea is a long trough,\r\nseparating the Old World from the New, and extending probably from pole\r\nto pole.\r\n\r\nThis ocean-furrow was scored into the solid crust of our planet by the\r\nAlmighty hand, that there the waters which “he called seas” might be\r\ngathered together so as to “let the dry land appear,” and fit the earth\r\nfor the habitation of man.\r\n\r\nFrom the top of Chimborazo to the bottom of the Atlantic, at the\r\ndeepest place yet recognised by the plummet in the North Atlantic, the\r\ndistance in a vertical line is nine miles.\r\n\r\nCould the waters of the Atlantic be drawn off, so as to expose to\r\nview this great sea-gash, which separates continents, and extends\r\nfrom the Arctic to the Antarctic, it would present a scene the most\r\ngrand, rugged, and imposing. The very ribs of the solid earth, with\r\nthe foundations of the sea, would be brought to light; and we should\r\nhave presented to us at one view, in the empty cradle of the ocean,\r\n“a thousand fearful wrecks,” with that dreadful array of dead men’s\r\nskulls, great anchors, heaps of pearls and inestimable stones, which,\r\nin the dreamer’s eye, lie scattered on the bottom of the sea, making it\r\nhideous with sights of ugly death.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALES OF THE ATLANTIC.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Maury has, in a series of charts of the North and South\r\nAtlantic, exhibited, by means of colours, the prevalence of Gales\r\nover the more stormy parts of the oceans for each month in the year.\r\nOne colour shows the region in which there is a gale every six days;\r\nanother colour every six to ten days; another every ten to fourteen\r\ndays: and there is a separate chart for each month and each ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLITUDE AT SEA.\r\n\r\nBetween Humboldt’s Current of Peru and the great equatorial flow, there\r\nis “a desolate region,” rarely visited by the whale, either sperm or\r\nright. Formerly this part of the ocean was seldom whitened by the sails\r\nof a ship, or enlivened by the presence of man. Neither the industrial\r\npursuits of the sea nor the highways of commerce called him into it.\r\nNow and then a roving cruiser or an enterprising whalesman passed that\r\nway; but to all else it was an unfrequented part of the ocean, and so\r\nremained until the gold-fields of Australia and the guano islands of\r\nPeru made it a thoroughfare. All vessels bound from Australia to South\r\nAmerica now pass through it; and in the journals of some of them it\r\nis described as a region almost void of the signs of life in both sea\r\nand air. In the South-Pacific Ocean especially, where there is such a\r\nwide expanse of water, sea-birds often exhibit a companionship with a\r\nvessel, and will follow and keep company with it through storm and calm\r\nfor weeks together. Even the albatross and Cape pigeon, that delight\r\nin the stormy regions of Cape Horn and the inhospitable climates of\r\nthe Antarctic regions, not unfrequently accompany vessels into the\r\nperpetual summer of the tropics. The sea-birds that join the ship as\r\nshe clears Australia will, it is said, follow her to this region, and\r\nthen disappear. Even the chirp of the stormy petrel ceases to be heard\r\nhere, and the sea itself is said to be singularly barren of “moving\r\ncreatures that have life.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTTLES AND CURRENTS AT SEA.\r\n\r\nSeafaring people often throw a bottle overboard, with a paper\r\nstating the time and place at which it is done. In the absence of\r\nother information as to Currents, that afforded by these mute little\r\nnavigators is of great value. They leave no track behind them, it is\r\ntrue, and their routes cannot be ascertained; but knowing where they\r\nare cast, and seeing where they are found, some idea may be formed as\r\nto their course. Straight lines may at least be drawn, showing the\r\nshortest distance from the beginning to the end of their voyage, with\r\nthe time elapsed. Admiral Beechey has prepared a chart, representing,\r\nin this way, the tracks of more than 100 bottles. From this it appears\r\nthat the waters from every quarter of the Atlantic tend towards the\r\nGulf of Mexico and its stream. Bottles cast into the sea midway between\r\nthe Old and the New Worlds, near the coasts of Europe, Africa, and\r\nAmerica at the extreme north or farthest south, have been found either\r\nin the West Indies, or the British Isles, or within the well-known\r\nrange of Gulf-Stream waters.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE HORSE LATITUDES”\r\n\r\nare the belts of calms and light airs which border the polar edge of\r\nthe north-east trade-winds. They are so called from the circumstance\r\nthat vessels formerly bound from New England to the West Indies, with a\r\ndeck-load of horses, were often so delayed in this calm belt of Cancer,\r\nthat, from the want of water for their animals, they were compelled to\r\nthrow a portion of them overboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHITE WATER” AND LUMINOUS ANIMALS AT SEA.\r\n\r\nCaptain Kingman, of the American clipper-ship _Shooting Star_, in lat.\r\n8° 46′ S., long. 105° 30′ E., describes a patch of _white water_,\r\nabout twenty-three miles in length, making the whole ocean appear like\r\na plain covered with snow. He filled a 60-gallon tub with the water,\r\nand found it to contain small luminous particles seeming to be alive\r\nwith worms and insects, resembling a grand display of rockets and\r\nserpents seen at a great distance in a dark night; some of the serpents\r\nappearing to be six inches in length, and very luminous. On being taken\r\nup, they emitted light until brought within a few feet of a lamp, when\r\nnothing was visible; but by aid of a sextant’s magnifier they could\r\nbe plainly seen--a jelly-like substance, without colour. A specimen\r\ntwo inches long was visible to the naked eye; it was about the size\r\nof a large hair, and tapered at the ends. By bringing one end within\r\nabout one-fourth of an inch of a lighted lamp, the flame was attracted\r\ntowards it, and burned with a red light; the substance crisped in\r\nburning, something like hair, or appeared of a red heat before being\r\nconsumed. In a glass of the water there were several small round\r\nsubstances (say 1/16th of an inch in diameter) which had the power of\r\nexpanding and contracting; when expanded, the outer rim appeared like a\r\ncircular saw, the teeth turned inward.\r\n\r\nThe scene from the clipper’s deck was one of awful grandeur: the sea\r\nhaving turned to phosphorus, and the heavens being hung in blackness,\r\nand the stars going out, seemed to indicate that all nature was\r\npreparing for that last grand conflagration which we are taught to\r\nbelieve will annihilate this material world.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF THE LOG.\r\n\r\nLong before the introduction of the Log, hour-glasses were used to\r\ntell the distance in sailing. Columbus, Juan de la Cosa, Sebastian\r\nCabot, and Vasco de Gama, were not acquainted with the Log and its mode\r\nof application; and they estimated the ship’s speed merely by the eye,\r\nwhile they found the distance they had made by the running-down of the\r\nsand in the _ampotellas_, or hour-glasses. The Log for the measurement\r\nof the distance traversed is stated by writers on navigation not to\r\nhave been invented until the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of\r\nthe seventeenth century (see _Encyclopædia Britannica_, 7th edition,\r\n1842). The precise date is not known; but it is certain that Pigafetta,\r\nthe companion of Magellan, speaks, in 1521, of the Log as a well-known\r\nmeans of finding the course passed over. Navarete places the use of the\r\nlog-line in English ships in 1577.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE OF THE SEA-DEEPS.\r\n\r\nThe ocean teems with life, we know. Of the four elements of the old\r\nphilosophers,--fire, earth, air, and water,--perhaps the sea most of\r\nall abounds with living creatures. The space occupied on the surface\r\nof our planet by the different families of animals and their remains\r\nis inversely as the size of the individual; the smaller the animal,\r\ngenerally speaking, the greater the space occupied by his remains.\r\nTake the elephant and his remains, and a microscopic animal and his,\r\nand compare them; the contrast as to space occupied is as striking as\r\nthat of the coral reef or island with the dimensions of the whale. The\r\ngraveyard that would hold the corallines, is larger than the graveyard\r\nthat would hold the elephants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTHS OF OCEAN AND AIR UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\nAt some few places under the tropics, no bottom has been found with\r\nsoundings of 26,000 feet, or more than four miles; whilst in the air,\r\nif, according to Wollaston, we may assume that it has a limit from\r\nwhich waves of sound may be reverberated, the phenomenon of twilight\r\nwould incline us to assume a height at least nine times as great. The\r\naerial ocean rests partly on the solid earth, whose mountain-chains and\r\nelevated plateaus rise like green wooded shoals, and partly on the sea,\r\nwhose surface forms a moving base, on which rest the lower, denser, and\r\nmore saturated strata of air.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe old Alexandrian mathematicians, on the testimony of Plutarch,\r\nbelieved the depth of the sea to depend on the height of the mountains.\r\nMr. W. Darling has propounded to the British Association the theory,\r\nthat as the sea covers three times the area of the land, so it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that the depth of the ocean, and that for a\r\nlarge portion, is three times as great as the height of the highest\r\nmountain. Recent soundings show depths in the sea much greater than any\r\nelevations on the surface of the earth; for a line has been veered to\r\nthe extent of seven miles.--_Dr. Scoresby._\r\n\r\n\r\nGREATEST ASCERTAINED DEPTH OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nIn the dynamical theory of the tides, the ratio of the effects of the\r\nsun and moon depends, not only on the masses, distances, and periodic\r\ntimes of the two luminaries, but also on the Depth of the Sea; and\r\nthis, accordingly, may be computed when the other quantities are known.\r\nIn this manner Professor Haughton has deduced, from the solar and lunar\r\ncoefficients of the diurnal tide, a mean depth of 5·12 miles; a result\r\nwhich accords in a remarkable manner with that inferred from the ratio\r\nof the semi-diurnal co-efficients as obtained by Laplace from the\r\nBrest observations. Professor Hennessey states, that from what is now\r\nknown regarding the depth of the ocean, the continents would appear as\r\nplateaus elevated above the oceanic depressions to an amount which,\r\nalthough small compared to the earth’s radius, would be considerable\r\nwhen compared to its outswelling at the equator and its flattening\r\ntowards the poles; and the surface thus presented would be the true\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depths at which the bottom of the sea has been reached\r\nwith the plummet are in the North-Atlantic Ocean; and the places where\r\nit has been fathomed (by the United-States deep-sea sounding apparatus)\r\ndo not show it to be deeper than 25,000 feet = 4 miles, 1293 yards, 1\r\nfoot. The deepest place in this ocean is probably between the parallels\r\nof 35° and 40° north latitude, and immediately to the southward of the\r\nGrand Banks of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n  It appears that, with one exception, the bottom of the\r\n  North-Atlantic Ocean, as far as examined, from the depth of about\r\n  sixty fathoms to that of more than two miles (2000 fathoms), is\r\n  literally nothing but a mass of microscopic shells. Not one of\r\n  the animalcules from these shells has been found living in the\r\n  surface-waters, nor in shallow water along the shore. Hence arises\r\n  the question, Do they live on the bottom, at the immense depths\r\n  where the shells are found; or are they borne by submarine currents\r\n  from their real habitat?\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE LEVELS OF THE RED SEA AND MEDITERRANEAN.\r\n\r\nThe French engineers, at the beginning of the present century, came\r\nto the conclusion that the Red Sea was about thirty feet above the\r\nMediterranean: but the observations of Mr. Robert Stephenson, the\r\nEnglish engineer, at Suez; of M. Negretti, the Austrian, at Tineh,\r\nnear the ancient Pelusium; and the levellings of Messrs. Talabat,\r\nBourdaloue, and their assistants between the two seas;--have proved\r\nthat the low-water mark of ordinary tides at Suez and Tineh is very\r\nnearly on the same levels, the difference being that at Suez it is\r\nrather more than one inch lower.--_Leonard Horner_; _Proceedings of the\r\nRoyal Society_, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPTH OF THE MEDITERRANEAN.\r\n\r\nSoundings made in the Mediterranean suffice to indicate depths equal\r\nto the average height of the mountains girding round this great basin;\r\nand, if one particular experiment may be credited, reaching even to\r\n15,000 feet--an equivalent to the elevation of the highest Alps. This\r\nsounding was made about ninety miles east of Malta. Between Cyprus and\r\nEgypt, 6000 feet of line had been let down without reaching the bottom.\r\nOther deep soundings have been made in other places with similar\r\nresults. In the lines of sea between Egypt and the Archipelago, it is\r\nstated that one sounding made by the _Tartarus_ between Alexandria\r\nand Rhodes reached bottom at the depth of 9900 feet; another, between\r\nAlexandria and Candia, gave a depth of 300 feet beyond this. These\r\nsingle soundings, indeed, whether of ocean or sea, are always open to\r\nthe certainty that greater as well as lesser depths must exist, to\r\nwhich no line has ever been sunk; a case coming under that general law\r\nof probabilities so largely applicable in every part of physics. In the\r\nMediterranean especially, which has so many aspects of a sunken basin,\r\nthere may be abysses of depth here and there which no plummet is ever\r\ndestined to reach.--_Edinburgh Review._\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF THE RED SEA.\r\n\r\nM. Ehrenberg, while navigating the Red Sea, observed that the red\r\ncolour of its waters was owing to enormous quantities of a new animal,\r\nwhich has received the name of _oscillatoria rubescens_, and which\r\nseems to be the same with what Haller has described as a _purple\r\nconferva_ swimming in water; yet Dr. Bonar, in his work entitled _The\r\nDesert of Sinai_, records:\r\n\r\n  Blue I have called the sea; yet not strictly so, save in the far\r\n  distance. It is neither a _red_ nor a _blue_ sea, but emphatically\r\n  green,--yes, green, of the most brilliant kind I ever saw. This is\r\n  produced by the immense tracts of shallow water, with yellow sand\r\n  beneath, which always gives this green to the sea, even in the\r\n  absence of verdure on the shore or sea-weeds beneath. The _blue_ of\r\n  the sky and the _yellow_ of the sands meeting and intermingling in\r\n  the water, form the _green_ of the sea; the water being the medium\r\n  in which the mixing or fusing of the colours takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS SEA-MILK?\r\n\r\nThe phenomena with this name and that of “Squid” are occasioned by the\r\npresence of phosphorescent animalcules. They are especially produced\r\nin the intertropical seas, and they appear to be chiefly abundant\r\nin the Gulf of Guinea and in the Arabian Gulf. In the latter, the\r\nphenomenon was known to the ancients more than a century before the\r\nChristian era, as may be seen from a curious passage from the geography\r\nof Agatharcides: “Along this country (the coast of Arabia) the sea\r\nhas a white aspect like a river: the cause of this phenomenon is a\r\nsubject of astonishment to us.” M. Quatrefages has discovered that the\r\n_Noctilucæ_ which produce this phenomenon do not always give out clear\r\nand brilliant sparks, but that under certain circumstances this light\r\nis replaced by a steady clearness, which gives in these animalcules a\r\nwhite colour. The waters in which they have been observed do not change\r\ntheir place to any sensible degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOTTOM OF THE SEA A BURIAL-PLACE.\r\n\r\nAmong the minute shells which have been fished up from the great\r\ntelegraphic plateau at the bottom of the sea between Newfoundland and\r\nIreland, the microscope has failed to detect a single particle of sand\r\nor gravel; and the inference is, that there, if any where, the waters\r\nof the sea are at rest. There is not motion enough there to abrade\r\nthese very delicate organisms, nor current enough to sweep them about\r\nand mix them up with a grain of the finest sand, nor the smallest\r\nparticle of gravel from the loose beds of _débris_ that here and there\r\nstrew the bottom of the sea. The animalculæ probably do not live or die\r\nthere. They would have had no light there; and, if they lived there,\r\ntheir frail textures would be subjected in their growth to a pressure\r\nupon them of a column of water 12,000 feet high, equal to the weight of\r\n400 atmospheres. They probably live and sport near the surface, where\r\nthey can feel the genial influence of both light and heat, and are\r\nburied in the lichen caves below after death.\r\n\r\nIt is now suggested, that henceforward we should view the surface of\r\nthe sea as a nursery teeming with nascent organisms, and its depths as\r\nthe cemetery for families of living creatures that outnumber the sands\r\non the sea-shore for multitude.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a nursery, hard by there will be found also a\r\ngraveyard,--such is the condition of the animal world. But it never\r\noccurred to us before to consider the surface of the sea as one\r\nwide nursery, its every ripple as a cradle, and its bottom one vast\r\nburial-place.--_Lieut. Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY IS THE SEA SALT?\r\n\r\nIt has been replied, In order to preserve it in a state of purity;\r\nwhich is, however, untenable, mainly from the fact that organic\r\nimpurities in a vast body of moving water, whether fresh or salt,\r\nbecome rapidly lost, so as apparently to have called forth a special\r\nagency to arrest the total organised matter in its final oscillation\r\nbetween the organic and inorganic worlds. Thus countless hosts of\r\nmicroscopic creatures swarm in most waters, their principal function\r\nbeing, as Professor Owen surmises, to feed upon and thus restore to\r\nthe living chain the almost unorganised matter of various zones. These\r\ncreatures preying upon one another, and being preyed upon by others\r\nin their turn, the circulation of organic matter is kept up. If we\r\ndo not adopt this view, we must at least look upon the Infusoria and\r\nForaminifera as scavenger agents to prevent an undue accumulation\r\nof decaying matter; and thus the salt condition of the sea is not a\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\nNor is the amount of saline matter in the sea sufficient to arrest\r\ndecomposition. That the sea is salt to render it of greater density,\r\nand by lowering its freezing point to preserve it from congelation to\r\nwithin a shorter distance of the poles, though admissible, scarcely\r\nmeets the entire solution of the question. The freezing point of\r\nsea-water, for instance, is only 3½° F. lower than that of fresh water;\r\nhence, with the present distribution of land and sea--and still less,\r\nprobably, with that which obtained in former geological epochs--no very\r\nimportant effects would have resulted had the ocean been fresh instead\r\nof salt.\r\n\r\nNow Professor Chapman, of Toronto, suggests that the salt condition of\r\nthe sea is mainly intended to regulate evaporation, and to prevent an\r\nundue excess of that phenomenon; saturated solutions evaporating more\r\nslowly than weak ones, and these latter more slowly again than pure\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a self-adjusting phenomenon and admirable\r\ncontrivance in the balance of forces. If from any temporary cause there\r\nbe an unusual amount of saline matter in the sea, evaporation goes on\r\nthe more and more slowly; and, on the other hand, if this proportion\r\nbe reduced by the addition of fresh water in undue excess, the\r\nevaporating power is the more and more increased--thus aiding time, in\r\neither instance, to restore the balance. The perfect system of oceanic\r\ncirculation may be ascribed, in a great degree at least, if not wholly,\r\nto the effect produced by the salts of the sea upon the mobility and\r\ncirculation of its waters.\r\n\r\nNow this is an office which the sea performs in the economy of the\r\nuniverse by virtue of its saltness, and which it could not perform were\r\nits waters altogether fresh. And thus philosophers have a clue placed\r\nin their hands which will probably guide to one of the many hidden\r\nreasons that are embraced in the true answer to the question, “_Why is\r\nthe sea salt?_”\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO ASCERTAIN THE SALTNESS OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nDry a towel in the sun, weigh it carefully, and note its weight. Then\r\ndip it into sea-water, wring it sufficiently to prevent its dripping,\r\nand weigh it again; the increase of the weight being that of the water\r\nimbibed by the cloth. It should then be thoroughly dried, and once more\r\nweighed; and the excess of this weight above the original weight of the\r\ncloth shows the quantity of the salt retained by it; then, by comparing\r\nthe weight of this salt with that of the sea-water imbibed by the\r\ncloth, we shall find what proportion of salt was contained in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THE SALT IN THE SEA.\r\n\r\nThe amount of common Salt in all the oceans is estimated by Schafhäutl\r\nat 3,051,342 cubic geographical miles. This would be about five times\r\nmore than the mass of the Alps, and only one-third less than that of\r\nthe Himalaya. The sulphate of soda equals 633,644·36 cubic miles, or is\r\nequal to the mass of the Alps; the chloride of magnesium, 441,811·80\r\ncubic miles; the lime salts, 109,339·44 cubic miles. The above supposes\r\nthe mean depth to be but 300 metres, as estimated by Humboldt.\r\nAdmitting, with Laplace, that the mean depth is 1000 metres, which is\r\nmore probable, the mass of marine salt will be more than double the\r\nmass of the Himalaya.--_Silliman’s Journal_, No. 16.\r\n\r\nTaking the average depth of the ocean at two miles, and its average\r\nsaltness at 3½ per cent, it appears that there is salt enough in the\r\nsea to cover to the thickness of one mile an area of 7,000,000 of\r\nsquare miles. Admit a transfer of such a quantity of matter from an\r\naverage of half a mile above to one mile below the sea-level, and\r\nastronomers will show by calculation that it would alter the length of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nThese 7,000,000 of cubic miles of crystal salt have not made the sea\r\nany fuller.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF SEA-WATER.\r\n\r\nThe solid constituents of sea-water amount to about 3½ per cent of\r\nits weight, or nearly half an ounce to the pound. Its saltness is\r\ncaused as follows: Rivers which are constantly flowing into the\r\nocean contain salts varying from 10 to 50, and even 100, grains per\r\ngallon. They are chiefly common salt, sulphate and carbonate of lime,\r\nmagnesia,[41] soda, potash, and iron; and these are found to constitute\r\nthe distinguishing characteristics of sea-water. The water which\r\nevaporates from the sea is nearly pure, containing but very minute\r\ntraces of salts. Falling as rain upon the land, it washes the soil,\r\npercolates through the rocky layers, and becomes charged with saline\r\nsubstances, which are borne seaward by the returning currents. The\r\nocean, therefore, is the great depository of every thing that water\r\ncan dissolve and carry down from the surface of the continents; and\r\nas there is no channel for their escape, they consequently accumulate\r\n(_Youmans’ Chemistry_). They would constantly accumulate, as this very\r\nshrewd author remarks, were it not for the shells and insects of the\r\nsea and other agents.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENERY AND LIFE OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Scoresby, from personal observations made in the course of\r\ntwenty-one voyages to the Arctic Regions, thus describes these striking\r\ncharacteristics:\r\n\r\n  The coast scenes of Greenland are generally of an abrupt character,\r\n  the mountains frequently rising in triangular profile; so much\r\n  so, that it is sometimes not possible to effect their ascent. One\r\n  of the most notable characteristics of the Arctic lands is the\r\n  deception to which travellers are liable in regard to distances.\r\n  The occasion of this is the quantity of light reflected from\r\n  the snow, contrasted with the dark colour of the rocks. Several\r\n  persons of considerable experience have been deceived in this way,\r\n  imagining, for example, that they were close to the shore when in\r\n  fact they were more than twenty miles off. The trees of these lands\r\n  are not more than three inches above ground.\r\n\r\n  Many of the icebergs are five miles in extent, and some are to be\r\n  seen running along the shore measuring as much as thirteen miles.\r\n  Dr. Scoresby has seen a cliff of ice supported on those floating\r\n  masses 402 feet in height. There is no place in the world where\r\n  animal life is to be found in greater profusion than in Greenland,\r\n  Spitzbergen, Baffin’s Bay, and other portions of the Arctic\r\n  regions. This is to be accounted for by the abundance and richness\r\n  of the food supplied by the sea. The number of birds is especially\r\n  remarkable. On one occasion, no less than a million of little hawks\r\n  came in sight of Dr. Scoresby’s ship within a single hour.\r\n\r\n  The various phenomena of the Greenland sea are very interesting.\r\n  The different colours of the sea-water--olive or bottle-green,\r\n  reddish-brown, and mustard--have, by the aid of the microscope,\r\n  been found to be owing to animalculæ of these various colours:\r\n  in a single drop of mustard-coloured water have been counted\r\n  26,450 animals. Another remarkable characteristic of the Greenland\r\n  sea-water is its warm temperature--one, two, and three degrees\r\n  above the freezing-point even in the cold season. This Dr.\r\n  Scoresby accounts for by supposing the flow in that direction of\r\n  warm currents from the south. The polar fields of ice are to be\r\n  found from eight or nine to thirty or forty feet in thickness. By\r\n  fastening a hook twelve or twenty inches in these masses of ice, a\r\n  ship could ride out in safety the heaviest gales.\r\n\r\n\r\nICEBERG OF THE POLAR SEAS.\r\n\r\nThe ice of this berg, although opaque and vascular, is true glacier\r\nice, having the fracture, lustre, and other external characters of\r\na nearly homogeneous growth. The iceberg is true ice, and is always\r\ndreaded by ships. Indeed, though modified by climate, and especially by\r\nthe alternation of day and night, the polar glacier must be regarded as\r\nstrictly atmospheric in its increments, and not essentially differing\r\nfrom the glacier of the Alps. The general appearance of a berg may be\r\ncompared to frosted silver; but when its fractures are very extensive,\r\nthe exposed faces have a very brilliant lustre. Nothing can be more\r\nexquisite than a fresh, cleanly fractured berg surface: it reminds one\r\nof the recent cleavage of sulphate of strontian--a resemblance more\r\nstriking from the slightly lazulitic tinge of each.--_U. S. Grinnel\r\nExpedition in Search of Sir J. Franklin._\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMENSITY OF POLAR ICE.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of solid matter that is drifted out of the Polar Seas\r\nthrough one opening--Davis’s Straits--alone, and during a part of the\r\nyear only, covers to the depth of seven feet an area of 300,000 square\r\nmiles, and weighs not less than 18,000,000,000 tons. The quantity of\r\nwater required to float and drive out this solid matter is probably\r\nmany times greater than this. A quantity of water equal in weight to\r\nthese two masses has to go in. The basin to receive these inflowing\r\nwaters, _i. e._ the unexplored basin about the North Pole, includes an\r\narea of 1,500,000 square miles; and as the outflowing ice and water are\r\nat the surface, the return current must be submarine.\r\n\r\nThese two currents, therefore, it may be perceived, keep in motion\r\nbetween the temperate and polar regions of the earth a volume of water,\r\nin comparison with which the mighty Mississippi in its greatest floods\r\nsinks down to a mere rill.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN SEA AT THE POLE.\r\n\r\nThe following fact is striking: In 1662-3, Mr. Oldenburg, Secretary to\r\nthe Royal Society, was ordered to register a paper entitled “Several\r\nInquiries concerning Greenland, answered by Mr. Gray, who had visited\r\nthose parts.” The nineteenth query was, “How near any one hath been\r\nknown to approach the Pole. _Answer._ I once met upon the coast of\r\nGreenland a Hollander, that swore he had been but half a degree from\r\nthe Pole, showing me his journal, which was also attested by his mate;\r\nwhere _they had seen no ice or land, but all water_.” Boyle mentions\r\na similar account, which he received from an old Greenland master, on\r\nApril 5, 1765.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIVER-WATER ON THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\nCaptain Sabine found discoloured water, supposed to be that of the\r\nAmazon, 300 miles distant in the ocean from the embouchure of that\r\nriver. It was about 126 feet deep. Its specific gravity was = 1·0204,\r\nand the specific gravity of the sea-water = 1·0262. This appears to\r\nbe the greatest distance from land at which river-water has been\r\ndetected on the surface of the ocean. It was estimated to be moving\r\nat the rate of three miles an hour, and had been turned aside by an\r\nocean-current. “It is not a little curious to reflect,” says Sir Henry\r\nde la Beche, “that the agitation and resistance of its particles should\r\nbe sufficient to keep finely comminuted solid matter mechanically\r\nsuspended, so that it would not be disposed freely to part with it\r\nexcept at its junction with the sea-water over which it flows, and\r\nwhere, from friction, it is sufficiently retarded.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THAMES AND ITS SALT-WATER BED.\r\n\r\nThe Thames below Woolwich, in place of flowing upon a solid bottom,\r\nreally flows upon the liquid bottom formed by the water of the sea.\r\nAt the flow of the tide, the fresh water is raised, as it were, in a\r\nsingle mass by the salt water which flows in, and which ascends the\r\nbed of the river, while the fresh water continues to flow towards the\r\nsea.--_Mr. Stevenson, in Jameson’s Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH SPRINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN.\r\n\r\nOn the southern coast of the island of Cuba, at a few miles from land,\r\nSprings of Fresh Water gush from the bed of the Ocean, probably under\r\nthe influence of hydrostatic pressure, and rise through the midst\r\nof the salt water. They issue forth with such force that boats are\r\ncautious in approaching this locality, which has an ill repute on\r\naccount of the high cross sea thus caused. Trading vessels sometimes\r\nvisit these springs to take in a supply of fresh water, which is thus\r\nobtained in the open sea. The greater the depth from which the water is\r\ntaken, the fresher it is found to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n“THE BLACK WATERS.”\r\n\r\nIn the upper portion of the basin of the Orinoco and its tributaries,\r\nNature has several times repeated the enigmatical phenomenon of the\r\nso-called “Black Waters.” The Atabapo, whose banks are adorned with\r\nCarolinias and arborescent Melastomas, is a river of a coffee-brown\r\ncolour. In the shade of the palm-groves this colour seems about to\r\npass into ink-black. When placed in transparent vessels, the water\r\nappears of a golden yellow. The image of the Southern Constellation\r\nis reflected with wonderful clearness in these black streams. When\r\ntheir waters flow gently, they afford to the observer, when taking\r\nastronomical observations with reflecting instruments, a most excellent\r\nartificial horizon. These waters probably owe their peculiar colour to\r\na solution of carburetted hydrogen, to the luxuriance of the tropical\r\nvegetation, and to the quantity of plants and herbs on the ground over\r\nwhich they flow.--_Humboldt’s Aspects of Nature_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT CATARACT IN INDIA.\r\n\r\nWhere the river Shirhawti, between Bombay and Cape Comorin, falls into\r\nthe Gulf of Arabia, it is about one-fourth of a mile in width, and in\r\nthe rainy season some thirty feet in depth. This immense body of water\r\nrushes down a rocky slope 300 feet, at an angle of 45°, at the bottom\r\nof which it makes a perpendicular plunge of 850 feet into a black and\r\ndismal abyss, with a noise like the loudest thunder. The whole descent\r\nis therefore 1150 feet, or several times that of Niagara; but the\r\nvolume of water in the latter is somewhat larger than in the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF WAVES.\r\n\r\nThe friction of the wind combines with the tide in agitating the\r\nsurface of the ocean, and, according to the theory of undulations,\r\neach produces its effect independently of the other. Wind, however,\r\nnot only raises waves, but causes a transfer of superficial water\r\nalso. Attraction between the particles of air and water, as well\r\nas the pressure of the atmosphere, brings its lower stratum into\r\nadhesive contact with the surface of the sea. If the motion of the\r\nwind be parallel to the surface, there will still be friction, but the\r\nwater will be smooth as a mirror; but if it be inclined, in however\r\nsmall a degree, a ripple will appear. The friction raises a minute\r\nwave, whose elevation protects the water beyond it from the wind,\r\nwhich consequently impinges on the surface at a small angle: thus\r\neach impulse, combining with the other, produces an undulation which\r\ncontinually advances.--_Mrs. Somerville’s Physical Geography._\r\n\r\n\r\nRATE AT WHICH WAVES TRAVEL.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bache states, as one of the effects of an earthquake at\r\nSimoda, on the island of Niphon, in Japan, that the harbour was first\r\nemptied of water, and then came in an enormous wave, which again\r\nreceded and left the harbour dry. This occurred several times. The\r\nUnited-States self-acting tide-gauge at San Francisco, which records\r\nthe rise of the tide upon cylinders turned by clocks, showed that at\r\nSan Francisco, 4800 miles from the scene of the earthquake, the first\r\nwave arrived twelve hours and sixteen minutes after it had receded from\r\nthe harbour of Simoda. It had travelled across the broad bosom of the\r\nPacific Ocean at the rate of six miles and a half a minute, and arrived\r\non the shores of California: the first wave being seven-tenths of a\r\nfoot in height, and lasting for about half an hour, followed by seven\r\nlesser waves, at intervals of half an hour each.\r\n\r\nThe velocity with which a wave travels depends on the depth of the\r\nocean. The latest calculations for the Pacific Ocean give a depth of\r\nfrom 14,000 to 18,000 fathoms. It is remarkable how the estimates of\r\nthe ocean’s depth have grown less. Laplace assumed it at ten miles,\r\nWhewell at 3·5, while the above estimate brings it down to two miles.\r\n\r\nMr. Findlay states, that the dynamic force exerted by Sea-Waves is\r\ngreatest at the crest of the wave before it breaks; and its power in\r\nraising itself is measured by various facts. At Wasburg, in Norway,\r\nin 1820, it rose 400 feet; and on the coast of Cornwall, in 1843,\r\n300 feet. The author shows that waves have sometimes raised a column\r\nof water equivalent to a pressure of from three to five tons the\r\nsquare foot. He also proves that the velocity of the waves depends\r\non their length, and that waves of from 300 to 400 feet in length\r\nfrom crest to crest travel from twenty to twenty-seven and a half\r\nmiles an hour. Waves travel great distances, and are often raised by\r\ndistant hurricanes, having been felt simultaneously at St. Helena\r\nand Ascension, though 600 miles apart; and it is probable that\r\nground-swells often originate at the Cape of Good Hope, 3000 miles\r\ndistant. Dr. Scoresby found the travelling rate of the Atlantic waves\r\nto be 32·67 English statute miles per hour.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1856, a heavy ground-swell, brought on by five hours’\r\ngale, scoured away in fourteen hours 3,900,000 tons of pebbles from\r\nthe coast near Dover; but in three days, without any shift of wind,\r\nupwards of 3,000,000 tons were thrown back again. These figures are to\r\na certain extent conjectural; but the quantities have been derived from\r\ncareful measurement of the profile of the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN-HIGHWAYS: HOW SEA-ROUTES HAVE BEEN SHORTENED.\r\n\r\nWhen one looks seaward from the shore, and sees a ship disappear\r\nin the horizon as she gains an offing on a voyage to India, or the\r\nAntipodes perhaps, the common idea is that she is bound over a\r\ntrackless waste; and the chances of another ship sailing with the same\r\ndestination the next day, or the next week, coming up and speaking\r\nwith her on the “pathless ocean,” would to most minds seem slender\r\nindeed. Yet the truth is, the winds and the currents are now becoming\r\nso well understood, that the navigator, like the backwoodsman in the\r\nwilderness, is enabled literally to “blaze his way” across the ocean;\r\nnot, indeed, upon trees, as in the wilderness, but upon the wings of\r\nthe wind. The results of scientific inquiry have so taught him how to\r\nuse these invisible couriers, that they, with the calm belts of the\r\nair, serve as sign-boards to indicate to him the turnings and forks and\r\ncrossings by the way.\r\n\r\n  Let a ship sail from New York to California, and the next week let\r\n  a faster one follow; they will cross each other’s path many times,\r\n  and are almost sure to see each other by the way, as in the voyage\r\n  of two fine clipper-ships from New York to California. On the ninth\r\n  day after the _Archer_ had sailed, the _Flying Cloud_ put to sea.\r\n  Both ships were running against time, but without reference to\r\n  each other. The _Archer_, with wind and current charts in hand,\r\n  went blazing her way across the calms of Cancer, and along the\r\n  new route down through the north-east trades to the equator; the\r\n  _Cloud_ followed, crossing the equator upon the trail of Thomas of\r\n  the _Archer_. Off Cape Horn she came up with him, spoke him, and\r\n  handed him the latest New York dates. The _Flying Cloud_ finally\r\n  ranged ahead, made her adieus, and disappeared among the clouds\r\n  that lowered upon the western horizon, being destined to reach her\r\n  port a week or more in advance of her Cape Horn consort. Though\r\n  sighting no land from the time of their separation until they\r\n  gained the offing of San Francisco,--some six or eight thousand\r\n  miles off,--the tracks of the two vessels were so nearly the same,\r\n  that being projected upon the chart, they appear almost as one.\r\n\r\n  This is the great course of the ocean: it is 15,000 miles in\r\n  length. Some of the most glorious trials of speed and of prowess\r\n  that the world ever witnessed among ships that “walk the waters”\r\n  have taken place over it. Here the modern clipper-ship--the noblest\r\n  work that has ever come from the hands of man--has been sent,\r\n  guided by the lights of science, to contend with the elements, to\r\n  outstrip steam, and astonish the world.--_Maury._\r\n\r\n\r\nERROR UPON ERROR.\r\n\r\nThe great inducement to Mr. Babbage, some years since, to attempt\r\nthe construction of a machine by which astronomical tables could be\r\ncalculated and even printed by mechanical means, and with entire\r\naccuracy, was the errors in the requisite tables. Nineteen such\r\nerrors, in point of fact, were discovered in an edition of Taylor’s\r\n_Logarithms_ printed in 1796; some of which might have led to the\r\nmost dangerous results in calculating a ship’s place. These nineteen\r\nerrors (of which one only was an error of the press) were pointed out\r\nin the _Nautical Almanac_ for 1832. In one of these _errata_, the seat\r\nof the error was stated to be in cosine of 14° 18′ 3″. Subsequent\r\nexamination showed that there was an error of one second in this\r\ncorrection, and accordingly, in the _Nautical Almanac_ of the next\r\nyear a new correction was necessary. But in making the new correction\r\nof one second, a new error was committed of ten degrees, making it\r\nstill necessary, in some future edition of the _Nautical Almanac_,\r\nto insert an _erratum_ in an _erratum_ of the _errata_ in Taylor’s\r\n_Logarithms_.--_Edinburgh Review_, vol. 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhenomena of Heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LENGTH OF THE DAY AND THE HEAT OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nAs we may judge of the uniformity of temperature from the unaltered\r\ntime of vibration of a pendulum, so we may also learn from the\r\nunaltered rotatory velocity of the earth the amount of stability in the\r\nmean temperature of our globe. This is the result of one of the most\r\nbrilliant applications of the knowledge we had long possessed of the\r\nmovement of the heavens to the thermic condition of our planet. The\r\nrotatory velocity of the earth depends on its volume; and since, by the\r\ngradual cooling of the mass by radiation, the axis of rotation would\r\nbecome shorter, the rotatory velocity would necessarily increase, and\r\nthe length of the day diminish with a decrease of the temperature. From\r\nthe comparison of the secular inequalities in the motions of the moon\r\nwith the eclipses observed in former ages, it follows that, since the\r\ntime of Hipparchus,--that is, for full 2000 years,--the length of the\r\nday has certainly not diminished by the hundredth part of a second. The\r\ndecrease of the mean heat of the globe during a period of 2000 years\r\nhas not therefore, taking the extremest limits, diminished as much as\r\n1/306th of a degree of Fahrenheit.[42]--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICE MEASUREMENT OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nA delicate thermometer, placed on the ground, will be affected by the\r\npassage of a single cloud across a clear sky; and if a succession of\r\nclouds pass over, with intervals of clear sky between them, such an\r\ninstrument has been observed to fluctuate accordingly, rising with each\r\npassing mass of vapour, and falling again when the radiation becomes\r\nunrestrained.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURE OF HEAT BY THE SUN.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel estimates the total Expenditure of Heat by the Sun in\r\na given time, by supposing a cylinder of ice 45 miles in diameter to be\r\ncontinually darted into the sun _with the velocity of light_, and that\r\nthe water produced by its fusion were continually carried off: the heat\r\nnow given off constantly by radiation would then be wholly expended in\r\nits liquefaction, on the one hand, so as to leave no radiant surplus;\r\nwhile, on the other, the actual temperature at its surface would\r\nundergo no diminution.\r\n\r\nThe great mystery, however, is to conceive how so enormous a\r\nconflagration (if such it be) can be kept up. Every discovery in\r\nchemical science here leaves us completely at a loss, or rather\r\nseems to remove further the prospect of probable explanation. If\r\nconjecture might be hazarded, we should look rather to the known\r\npossibility of an indefinite generation of heat by friction, or to\r\nits excitement by the electric discharge, than to any combustion of\r\nponderable fuel, whether solid or gaseous, for the origin of the solar\r\nradiation.--_Outlines._[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTINCTIONS OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious laws of modern science are those which regulate the\r\ntransmission of radiant heat through transparent bodies. The heat of\r\nour fires is intercepted and detained by screens of glass, and, being\r\nso detained, warms them; while solar heat passes freely through and\r\nproduces no such effect. “The more recent researches of Delaroche,”\r\nsays Sir John Herschel, “however, have shown that this detention is\r\ncomplete only when the temperature of the source of heat is low; but\r\nthat as the temperature gets higher a portion of the heat radiated\r\nacquires a power of penetrating glass, and that the quantity which does\r\nso bears continually a larger and larger proportion to the whole, as\r\nthe heat of the radiant body is more intense. This discovery is very\r\nimportant, as it establishes a community of nature between solar and\r\nterrestrial heat; while at the same time it leads us to regard the\r\nactual temperature of the sun as far exceeding that of any earthly\r\nflame.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLATENT HEAT.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary principle exists in all bodies, and may be pressed\r\nout of them. The blacksmith hammers a nail until it becomes red hot,\r\nand from it he lights the match with which he kindles the fire of his\r\nforge. The iron has by this process become more dense, and percussion\r\nwill not again produce incandescence until the bar has been exposed in\r\nfire to a red heat, when it absorbs heat, the particles are restored to\r\ntheir former state, and we can again by hammering develop both heat and\r\nlight.--_R. Hunt, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT AND EVAPORATION.\r\n\r\nIn a communication made to the French Academy, M. Daubrée calculates\r\nthat the Evaporation of the Water on the surface of the globe employs a\r\nquantity of heat about equal to one-third of what is received from the\r\nsun; or, in other words, equal to the melting of a bed of ice nearly\r\nthirty-five feet in thickness if spread over the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT AND MECHANICAL POWER.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that Heat and Mechanical Power are mutually\r\nconvertible; and that the relation between them is definite, 772\r\nfoot-pounds of motive power being equivalent to a unit of heat, that\r\nis, to the amount of heat requisite to raise a pound of water through\r\none degree of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT OF MINES.\r\n\r\nOne cause of the great Heat of many of our deep Mines, which appears to\r\nhave been entirely lost sight of, is the chemical action going on upon\r\nlarge masses of pyritic matter in their vicinity. The heat, which is so\r\noppressive in the United Mines in Cornwall that the miners work nearly\r\nnaked, and bathe in water at 80° to cool themselves, is without doubt\r\ndue to the decomposition of immense quantities of the sulphurets of\r\niron and copper known to be in this condition at a short distance from\r\nthese mineral works.--_R. Hunt, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nVIBRATION OF HEATED METALS.\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Trevelyan discovered accidentally that a bar of iron, when\r\nheated and placed with one end on a solid block of lead, in cooling\r\nvibrates considerably, and produces sounds similar to those of an\r\nÆolian harp. The same effect is produced by bars of copper, zinc,\r\nbrass, and bell-metal, when heated and placed on blocks of lead, tin,\r\nor pewter. The bars were four inches long, one inch and a half wide,\r\nand three-eighths of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nThe conditions essential to these experiments are, That two different\r\nmetals must be employed--the one soft and possessed of moderate\r\nconducting powers, viz. lead or tin, the other hard; and it matters not\r\nwhether soft metal be employed for the bar or block, provided the soft\r\nmetal be cold and the hard metal heated.\r\n\r\nThat the surface of the block shall be uneven, for when rendered quite\r\nsmooth the vibration does not take place; but the bar cannot be too\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThat no matter be interposed, else it will prevent vibration, with\r\nthe exception of a burnish of gold leaf, the thickness of which cannot\r\namount to the two-hundred-thousandth part of an inch.--_Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Society of Edinburgh._\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPANSION OF SPIRITS.\r\n\r\nSpirits expand and become lighter by means of heat in a greater\r\nproportion than water, wherefore they are heaviest in winter. A cubic\r\ninch of brandy has been found by many experiments to weigh ten grains\r\nmore in winter than in summer, the difference being between four drams\r\nthirty-two grains and four drams forty-two grains. Liquor-merchants\r\ntake advantage of this circumstance, and make their purchases in winter\r\nrather than in summer, because they get in reality rather a larger\r\nquantity in the same bulk, buying by measure.--_Notes in Various\r\nSciences._\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT PASSING THROUGH GLASS.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment is by Mr. Fox Talbot: Heat a poker bright-red\r\nhot, and having opened a window, apply the poker quickly very near\r\nto the outside of a pane, and the hand to the inside; a strong heat\r\nwill be felt at the instant, which will cease as soon as the poker\r\nis withdrawn, and may be again renewed and made to cease as quickly\r\nas before. Now it is well known, that if a piece of glass is so much\r\nwarmed as to convey the impression of heat to the hand, it will retain\r\nsome part of that heat for a minute or more; but in this experiment the\r\nheat will vanish in a moment: it will not, therefore, be the heated\r\npane of glass that we shall feel, but heat which has come through the\r\nglass in a free or radiant state.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT FROM GAS-LIGHTING.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1835, Mr. W. H. White ascertained the temperature in\r\nthe City to be 3° higher than three miles south of London Bridge; and\r\n_after the gas had been lighted in the City_ four or five hours the\r\ntemperature increased full 3°, thus making 6° difference in the three\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT BY FRICTION.\r\n\r\nFriction as a source of Heat is well known: we rub our hands to\r\nwarm them, and we grease the axles of carriage-wheels to prevent\r\ntheir setting fire to the wood. Count Rumford has established the\r\nextraordinary fact, that an unlimited supply of heat may be derived\r\nfrom friction by the same materials: he made great quantities of water\r\nboil by causing a blunt borer to rub against a mass of metal immersed\r\nin the water. Savages light their fires by rubbing two pieces of wood:\r\nthe _modus operandi_, as practised by the Kaffirs of South Africa, is\r\nthus described by Captain Drayton:\r\n\r\n  Two dry sticks, one being of hard and the other of soft wood, were\r\n  the materials used. The soft stick was laid on the ground, and\r\n  held firmly down by one Kaffir, whilst another employed himself\r\n  in scooping out a little hole in the centre of it with the point\r\n  of his assagy: into this little hollow the end of the hard wood\r\n  was placed, and held vertically. These two men sat face to face,\r\n  one taking the vertical stick between the palms of his hands, and\r\n  making it twist about very quickly, while the other Kaffir held the\r\n  lower stick firmly in its place; the friction caused by the end of\r\n  one piece of wood revolving upon the other soon made the two pieces\r\n  smoke. When the Kaffir who twisted became tired, the respective\r\n  duties were exchanged. These operations having continued about a\r\n  couple of minutes, sparks began to appear, and when they became\r\n  numerous, were gathered into some dry grass, which was then swung\r\n  round at arm’s length until a blaze was established; and a roaring\r\n  fire was gladdening the hearts of the Kaffirs with the anticipation\r\n  of a glorious feast in about ten minutes from the time that the\r\n  operation was first commenced.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT BY FRICTION FROM ICE.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Humphry Davy was studying medicine at Penzance, one of his\r\nconstant associates was Mr. Tom Harvey, a druggist in the above town.\r\nThey constantly experimented together; and one severe winter’s day,\r\nafter a discussion on the nature of heat, the young philosophers were\r\ninduced to go to Larigan river, where Davy succeeded in developing heat\r\nby _rubbing two pieces of ice together_ so as to melt each other;[44]\r\nan experiment which he repeated with much _éclat_ many years after,\r\nin the zenith of his celebrity, at the Royal Institution. The pieces\r\nof ice for this experiment are fastened to the ends of two sticks,\r\nand rubbed together in air below the temperature of 32°: this Davy\r\nreadily accomplished on the day of severe cold at the Larigan river;\r\nbut when the experiment was repeated at the Royal Institution, it was\r\nin the vacuum of an air-pump, when the temperature of the apparatus and\r\nof the surrounding air was below 32°. It was remarked, that when the\r\nsurface of the rubbing pieces was rough, only half as much heat was\r\nevolved as when it was smooth. When the pressure of the rubbing piece\r\nwas increased four times, the proportion of heat evolved was increased\r\nsevenfold.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARMING WITH ICE.\r\n\r\nIn common language, any thing is understood to be cooled or warmed when\r\nthe temperature thereof is made higher or lower, whatever may have been\r\nthe temperature when the change was commenced. Thus it is said that\r\nmelted iron is _cooled_ down to a sub-red heat, or mercury is cooled\r\nfrom the freezing point to zero, or far below. By the same rule, solid\r\nmercury, say 50° below zero, may, in any climate or temperature of the\r\natmosphere, be immediately warmed and melted by being imbedded in a\r\ncake of ice.--_Scientific American._\r\n\r\n\r\nREPULSION BY HEAT.\r\n\r\nIf water is poured upon an iron sieve, the wires of which are made\r\nred-hot, it will not run through; but on cooling, it will pass through\r\nrapidly. M. Boutigny, pursuing this curious inquiry, has proved\r\nthat the moisture upon the skin is sufficient to protect it from\r\ndisorganisation if the arm is plunged into baths of melted metal.\r\nThe resistance of the surfaces is so great that little elevation of\r\ntemperature is experienced. Professor Plücker has stated, that by\r\nwashing the arm with ether previously to plunging it into melted metal,\r\nthe sensation produced while in the molten mass is that of freezing\r\ncoldness.--_R. Hunt, F.R.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FROM INTENSE HEAT.\r\n\r\nThe singular power which the body possesses of resisting great heats,\r\nand of breathing air of high temperatures, has at various times excited\r\npopular wonder. In the last century some curious experiments were\r\nmade on this subject. Sir Joseph Banks, Dr. Solander, and Sir Charles\r\nBlagden, entered a room in which the air had a temperature of 198°\r\nFahr., and remained ten minutes. Subsequently they entered the room\r\nseparately, when Dr. Solander found the heat 210°, and Sir Joseph\r\n211°, whilst their bodies preserved their natural degree of heat.\r\nWhenever they breathed upon a thermometer, it sank several degrees;\r\nevery inspiration gave coolness to their nostrils, and their breath\r\ncooled their fingers when it reached them. Sir Charles Blagden entered\r\nan apartment when the heat was 1° or 2° above 260°, and remained eight\r\nminutes, mostly on the coolest spot, where the heat was above 240°.\r\nThough very hot, Sir Charles felt no pain: during seven minutes his\r\nbreathing was good; but he then felt an oppression in his lungs, and\r\nhis pulse was 144, double its ordinary quickness. To prove the heat of\r\nthe room, eggs and a beefsteak were placed upon a tin frame near the\r\nthermometer, when in twenty minutes the eggs were roasted hard, and in\r\nforty-seven minutes the steak was dressed dry; and when the air was put\r\nin motion by a pair of bellows upon another steak, part of it was well\r\ndone in thirteen minutes. It is remarkable, that in these experiments\r\nthe same person who experienced no inconvenience from air heated to\r\n211°, could just bear rectified spirits of wine at 130°, cooling oil at\r\n129°, cooling water at 123°, and cooling quicksilver at 117°.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Chantrey, the sculptor, however, exposed himself to a\r\ntemperature still higher than any yet mentioned, as described by Sir\r\nDavid Brewster:\r\n\r\n  The furnace which he employs for drying his moulds is about\r\n  fourteen feet long, twelve feet high, and twelve feet broad. When\r\n  it is raised to its highest temperature, with the doors closed,\r\n  the thermometer stands at 350°, and the iron floor is red-hot. The\r\n  workmen often enter it at a temperature of 340°, walking over the\r\n  iron floor with wooden clogs, which are of course charred on the\r\n  surface. On one occasion, Mr. Chantrey, accompanied by five or\r\n  six of his friends, entered the furnace; and after remaining two\r\n  minutes they brought out a thermometer which stood at 320°. Some\r\n  of the party experienced sharp pains in the tips of their ears\r\n  and in the septum of the nose, while others felt a pain in their\r\n  eyes.--_Natural Magic_, 1833.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the clothing worn by the experimenters conducts away\r\nthe heat. Thus, in 1828, a Spaniard entered a heated oven, at the New\r\nTivoli, near Paris; he sang a song while a fowl was roasted by his\r\nside, he then ate the fowl and drank a bottle of wine, and on coming\r\nout his pulse beat 176°, and the thermometer was at 110° Reaumur. He\r\nthen stretched himself upon a plank in the oven surrounded by lighted\r\ncandles, when the mouth of the oven was closed; he remained there five\r\nminutes, and on being taken out, all the candles were extinguished and\r\nmelted, and the Spaniard’s pulse beat 200°. Now much of the surprise\r\nceases when it is added that he wore wide woollen pantaloons, a loose\r\nmantle of wool, and a great quilted cap; the several materials of this\r\nclothing being bad conductors of heat.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 M. Chabert, the “Fire-King,” exhibited similar feats at the\r\nArgyll Rooms in Regent Street. He first swallowed forty grains of\r\nphosphorus, then two spoonfuls of oil at 330°, and next held his head\r\nover the fumes of sulphuric acid. He had previously provided himself\r\nwith an antidote for the poison of the phosphorus. Dressed in a loose\r\nwoollen coat, he then entered a heated oven, and in five minutes cooked\r\ntwo steaks; he then came out of the oven, when the thermometer stood at\r\n380°. Upon another occasion, at White Conduit House, some of his feats\r\nwere detected.\r\n\r\nThe scientific secret is as follows: Muscular tissue is an extremely\r\nbad conductor; and to this in a great measure the constancy of the\r\ntemperature of the human body in various zones is to be attributed. To\r\nthis fact also Sir Charles Blagden and Chantrey owed their safety in\r\nexposing their bodies to a high temperature; from the almost impervious\r\ncharacter of the tissues of the body, the irritation produced was\r\nconfined to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnetism and Electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC HYPOTHESES.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the obstacles which erroneous hypotheses throw\r\nin the way of scientific discovery, Professor Faraday adduces the\r\nunsuccessful attempts that had been made in England to educe Magnetism\r\nfrom Electricity until Oersted showed the simple way. Faraday relates,\r\nthat when he came to the Royal Institution as an assistant in the\r\nlaboratory, he saw Davy, Wollaston, and Young trying, by every way that\r\nsuggested itself to them, to produce magnetic effects from an electric\r\ncurrent; but having their minds diverted from the true course by their\r\nexisting hypotheses, it did not occur to them to try the effect of\r\nholding a wire through which an electric current was passing over a\r\nsuspended magnetic needle. Had they done so, as Oersted afterwards did,\r\nthe immediate deflection of the needle would have proved the magnetic\r\nproperty of an electric current. Faraday has shown that the magnetism\r\nof a steel bar is caused by the accumulated action of all the particles\r\nof which it is composed: this he proves by first magnetising a small\r\nsteel bar, and then breaking it successively into smaller and smaller\r\npieces, each one of which possesses a separate pole; and the same\r\noperation may be continued until the particles become so small as not\r\nto be distinguishable without a microscope.\r\n\r\nWe quote the above from a late Number of the _Philosophical Magazine_,\r\nwherein also we find the following noble tribute to the genius and\r\npublic and private worth of Faraday:\r\n\r\n  The public never can know and appreciate the national value of such\r\n  a man as Faraday. He does not work to please the public, nor to win\r\n  its guineas; and the said public, if asked its opinion as to the\r\n  practical value of his researches, can see no possible practical\r\n  issue there. The public does not know that we need prophets\r\n  more than mechanics in science,--inspired men, who, by patient\r\n  self-denial and the exercise of the high intellectual gifts of the\r\n  Creator, bring us intelligence of His doings in Nature. To them\r\n  their pursuits are good in themselves. Their chief reward is the\r\n  delight of being admitted into communion with Nature, the pleasure\r\n  of tracing out and proclaiming her laws, wholly forgetful whether\r\n  those laws will ever augment our banker’s account or improve our\r\n  knowledge of cookery. _Such men, though not honoured by the title\r\n  of “practical,” are they which make practical men possible._\r\n  They bring us the tamed forces of Nature, and leave it to others\r\n  to contrive the machinery to which they may be yoked. If we are\r\n  rightly informed, it was Faradaic electricity which shot the glad\r\n  tidings of the fall of Sebastopol from Balaklava to Varna. Had\r\n  this man converted his talent to commercial purposes, as so many\r\n  do, we should not like to set a limit to his professional income.\r\n  The quality of his services cannot be expressed by pounds; but\r\n  that brave body, which for forty years has been the instrument\r\n  of that great soul, is a fit object for a nation’s care, as the\r\n  achievements of the man are, or will one day be, the object of a\r\n  nation’s pride and gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE AND THE MAGNETIC NEEDLE.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand years before our era, a people living in the\r\nextremest eastern portions of Asia had magnetic carriages, on which the\r\nmovable arm of the figure of a man continually pointed to the south,\r\nas a guide by which to find the way across the boundless grass-plains\r\nof Tartary; nay, even in the third century of our era, therefore at\r\nleast 700 years before the use of the mariner’s compass in European\r\nseas, Chinese vessels navigated the Indian Ocean under the direction of\r\nMagnetic Needles pointing to the south.\r\n\r\n  Now the Western nations, the Greeks and the Romans, knew that\r\n  magnetism could be communicated to iron, and _that that metal_\r\n  would retain it for a length of time. The great discovery of\r\n  the terrestrial directive force depended, therefore, alone\r\n  on this--that no one in the West had happened to observe an\r\n  elongated fragment of magnetic iron-stone, or a magnetic iron rod,\r\n  floating by the aid of a piece of wood in water, or suspended\r\n  in the air by a thread, in such a position as to admit of free\r\n  motion.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRCHER’S “MAGNETISM.”\r\n\r\nMore than two centuries since, Athanasius Kircher published his strange\r\nbook on Magnetism, in which he anticipated the supposed virtue of\r\nmagnetic traction in the curative art, and advocated the magnetism\r\nof the sun and moon, of the divining-rod, and showed his firm belief\r\nin animal magnetism. “In speaking of the vegetable world,” says Mr.\r\nHunt, “and the remarkable processes by which the leaf, the flower,\r\nand the fruit are produced, this sage brings forward the fact of the\r\ndiamagnetic (repelled by the magnet) character of the plant which was\r\nin 1852 rediscovered; and he refers the motions of the sunflower, the\r\nclosing of the convolvulus, and the directions of the spiral formed\r\nby the twining plants, to this particular influence.”[45] Nor were\r\nKircher’s anticipations random guesses, but the result of deductions\r\nfrom experiment and observation; and the universality of magnetism is\r\nnow almost recognised by philosophers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE MEASUREMENT OF TIME.\r\n\r\nBy observing the magnet in the highly-convenient and delicate manner\r\nintroduced by Gauss and Weber, which consists in attaching a mirror\r\nto the magnet and determining the constant factor necessary to convert\r\nthe differences of oscillation into differences of time, Professor\r\nHelmholtz has been able, with comparatively simple apparatus, to make\r\naccurate determinations up to the 1/10000th part of a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF A MAGNET.\r\n\r\nThe Power of a Magnet is estimated by the weight its poles are able\r\nto carry. Each pole singly is able to support a smaller weight than\r\nwhen they both act together by means of a keeper, for which reason\r\nhorse-shoe magnets are superior to bar magnets of similar dimensions\r\nand character. It has further been ascertained that small magnets have\r\na much greater relative force than large ones.\r\n\r\nWhen magnetism is excited in a piece of steel in the ordinary mode, by\r\nfriction with a magnet, it would seem that its inductive power is able\r\nto overcome the coercive power of the steel only to a certain depth\r\nbelow the surface; hence we see why small pieces of steel, especially\r\nif not very hard, are able to carry greater relative weights than large\r\nmagnets. Sir Isaac Newton wore in a ring a magnet weighing only 3\r\ngrains, which would lift 760 grains, _i. e._ 250 times its own weight.\r\n\r\nBar-magnets are seldom found capable of carrying more than their own\r\nweight; but horse-shoe magnets of similar steel will bear considerably\r\nmore. Small ones of from half an ounce to 1 ounce in weight will carry\r\nfrom 30 to 40 times their own weight; while such as weigh from 1 to 2\r\nlbs. will rarely carry more than from 10 to 15 times their weight. The\r\nwriter found a 1 lb. horse-shoe magnet that he impregnated by means of\r\nthe feeder able to bear 26½ times its own weight; and Fischer, having\r\nadopted the like mode of magnetising the steel, which he also carefully\r\nheated, has made magnets of from 1 to 3 lbs. weight that would carry 30\r\ntimes, and others of from 4 to 6 lbs. weight that would carry 20 times,\r\ntheir own weight.--_Professor Peschel._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\nIn 1750, Mr. Canton, F.R.S., “one of the most successful experimenters\r\nin the golden age of electricity,”[46] communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety his “Method of making Artificial Magnets without the use\r\nof natural ones.” This he effected by using a poker and tongs to\r\ncommunicate magnetism to steel bars. He derived his first hint from\r\nobserving them one evening, as he was sitting by the fire, to be nearly\r\nin the same direction with the earth as the dipping needle. He thence\r\nconcluded that they must, from their position and the frequent blows\r\nthey receive, have acquired some magnetic virtue, which on trial he\r\nfound to be the case; and therefore he employed them to impregnate his\r\nbars, instead of having recourse to the natural loadstone. Upon the\r\nreading of the above paper, Canton exhibited to the Royal Society his\r\nexperiments, for which the Copley Medal was awarded to him in 1751.\r\n\r\nCanton had, as early as 1747, turned his attention, with complete\r\nsuccess, to the production of powerful artificial magnets, principally\r\nin consequence of the expense of procuring those made by Dr. Gowan\r\nKnight, who kept his process secret. Canton for several years abstained\r\nfrom communicating his method even to his most intimate friends,\r\nlest it might be injurious to Dr. Knight, who procured considerable\r\npecuniary advantages by touching needles for the mariner’s compass.\r\n\r\nAt length Dr. Knight’s method of making artificial magnets was\r\ncommunicated to the world by Mr. Wilson, in a paper published in the\r\n69th volume of the _Philosophical Transactions_. He provided himself\r\nwith a large quantity of clean iron-filings, which he put into a\r\ncapacious tub about half full of clear water; he then agitated the\r\ntub to and fro for several hours, until the filings were reduced by\r\nattrition to an almost impalpable powder. This powder was then dried,\r\nand formed into paste by admixture with linseed-oil. The paste was then\r\nmoulded into convenient shapes, which were exposed to a moderate heat\r\nuntil they had attained a sufficient degree of hardness.\r\n\r\n  After allowing them to remain for some time in this state, Dr.\r\n  Knight gave them their magnetic virtue in any direction he pleased,\r\n  by placing them between the extreme ends of his large magazine of\r\n  artificial magnets for a second or more, as he saw occasion. By\r\n  this method the virtue they acquired was such, that when any one of\r\n  these pieces was held between two of his best ten-guinea bars, with\r\n  its poles purposely inverted, it immediately of itself turned about\r\n  to recover its natural direction, which the force of those very\r\n  powerful bars was not sufficient to counteract.\r\n\r\nDr. Knight’s powerful battery of magnets above mentioned is in the\r\npossession of the Royal Society, having been presented by Dr. John\r\nFothergill in 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF THE SUN’S RAYS IN INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF MAGNETS.\r\n\r\nProfessor Barlocci found that an armed natural loadstone, which would\r\ncarry 1½ Roman pounds, had its power nearly _doubled_ by twenty-four\r\nhours’ exposure to the strong light of the sun. M. Zantedeschi found\r\nthat an artificial horse-shoe loadstone, which carried 13½ oz., carried\r\n3½ more by three days’ exposure, and at last arrived to 31 oz. by\r\ncontinuing it in the sun’s light. He found that while the strength\r\nincreased in oxidated magnets, it diminished in those which were not\r\noxidated, the diminution becoming insensible when the loadstone was\r\nhighly polished. He now concentrated the solar rays upon the loadstone\r\nby means of a lens; and he found that, both in oxidated and polished\r\nmagnets, they _acquire_ strength when their _north_ pole is exposed\r\nto the sun’s rays, and _lose_ strength when the _south_ pole is\r\nexposed.--_Sir David Brewster._\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR OF A BODY AND ITS MAGNETIC PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\nSolar rays bleach dead vegetable matter with rapidity, while in living\r\nparts of plants their action is frequently to strengthen the colour.\r\nTheir power is perhaps best seen on the sides of peaches, apples, &c.,\r\nwhich, exposed to a midsummer’s sun, become highly coloured. In the\r\nopen winter of 1850, Mr. Adie, of Liverpool, found in a wallflower\r\nplant proof of a like effect: in the dark months there was a slow\r\nsuccession of one or two flowers, of uniform pale yellow hue; in March\r\nstreaks of a darker colour appeared on the flowers, and continued to\r\nslowly increase till in April they were variegated brown and yellow,\r\nof rich strong colours. On the supposition that these changes are\r\nreferable to magnetic properties, may hereafter be explained Mrs.\r\nSomerville’s experiments on steel needles exposed to the sun’s rays\r\nunder envelopes of silk of various colours; the magnetisation of steel\r\nneedles has failed in the coloured rays of the spectrum, but Mr. Adie\r\nconsiders that under dyed silk the effect will hinge on the chemical\r\nchange wrought in the silk and its dye by the solar rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONION AND MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nA popular notion has long been current, more especially on the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, that if a magnetic rod be rubbed with an onion,\r\nor brought in contact with the emanations of the plant, the directive\r\nforce will be diminished, while a compass thus treated will mislead the\r\nsteersman. It is difficult to conceive what could have given rise to so\r\nsingular a popular error.[47]--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. v.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLINATION OF THE NEEDLE--THE EARTH A MAGNET.\r\n\r\nThe Inclination or Dip of the Needle was first recorded by Robert\r\nNorman, in a scarce book published in 1576 entitled _The New\r\nAttractive; containing a short Discourse of the Magnet or Loadstone,\r\n&c._\r\n\r\nColumbus has not only the merit of being the first to discover _a\r\nline without magnetic variation_, but also of having first excited a\r\ntaste for the study of terrestrial magnetism in Europe, by means of\r\nhis observations on the progressive increase of western declination in\r\nreceding from that line.\r\n\r\nThe first chart showing the variation of the compass,[48] or the\r\ndeclination of the needle, based on the idea of employing curves drawn\r\nthrough points of equal declination, is due to Halley, who is justly\r\nentitled the father and founder of terrestrial magnetism. And it is\r\ncurious to find that in No. 195 of the _Philosophical Transactions_,\r\nin 1683, Halley had previously expressed his belief that he has put it\r\npast doubt that the globe of the earth is one great magnet, having four\r\nmagnetical poles or points of attraction, near each pole of the equator\r\ntwo; and that in those parts of the world which lie near adjacent to\r\nany one of those magnetical poles, the needle is chiefly governed\r\nthereby, the nearest pole being always predominant over the more remote.\r\n\r\n“To Halley” (says Sir John Herschel) “we owe the first appreciation\r\nof the real complexity of the subject of magnetism. It is wonderful\r\nindeed, and a striking proof of the penetration and sagacity of this\r\nextraordinary man, that with his means of information he should\r\nhave been able to draw such conclusions, and to take so large and\r\ncomprehensive a view of the subject as he appears to have done.”\r\n\r\nAnd, in our time, “the earth is a great magnet,” says Faraday: “its\r\npower, according to Gauss, being equal to that which would be conferred\r\nif every cubic yard of it contained six one-pound magnets; the sum of\r\nthe force is therefore equal to 8,464,000,000,000,000,000,000 such\r\nmagnets.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS.\r\n\r\nHalley, upon his return from his voyage to verify his theory of the\r\nvariation of the compass, in 1700, hazarded the conjecture that the\r\nAurora Borealis is a magnetic phenomenon. And Faraday’s brilliant\r\ndiscovery of the evolution of light by magnetism has raised Halley’s\r\nhypothesis, enounced in 1714, to the rank of an experimental certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF LIGHT ON THE MAGNET.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, Sir John Ross stated to the British Association, in proof of\r\nthe effect of every description of light on the magnet, that during\r\nhis last voyage in the _Felix_, when frozen in about one hundred miles\r\nnorth of the magnetic pole, he concentrated the rays of the full moon\r\non the magnetic needle, when he found it was five degrees attracted by\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETO-ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, the Copley Medal was adjudicated to M. Oersted of Copenhagen,\r\n“when,” says Dr. Whewell, “the philosopher announced that the\r\nconducting-wire of a voltaic circuit acts upon a magnetic needle; and\r\nthus recalled into activity that endeavour to connect magnetism with\r\nelectricity which, though apparently on many accounts so hopeful, had\r\nhitherto been attended with no success. Oersted found that the needle\r\nhas a tendency to place itself at _right angles_ to the wire; a kind of\r\naction altogether different from any which had been suspected.”\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETS OF THE HORSE-SHOE FORM\r\n\r\nwere discovered by Sturgeon in 1825. Of two Magnets made by a process\r\ndevised by M. Elias, and manufactured by M. Logemeur at Haerlem, one,\r\na single horse-shoe magnet weighing about 1 lb., lifts 28½ lbs.; the\r\nother, a triple horse-shoe magnet of about 10 lbs. weight, is capable\r\nof lifting about 150 lbs. Similar magnets are made by the same person\r\ncapable of supporting 5 cwt. In the process of making them, a helix of\r\ncopper and a galvanic battery are used. The smaller magnet has twice\r\nthe power expressed by Haecker’s formula for the best artificial steel\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Henry and Ten Eyk, in America, constructed some\r\nelectro-magnets on a large scale. One horse-shoe magnet made by them,\r\nweighing 60 lbs., would support more than 2000 lbs.\r\n\r\nIn September 1858, there were constructed for the Atlantic-telegraph\r\ncable at Valentia two permanent magnets, from which the electric\r\ninduction is obtained: each is composed of 30 horse-shoe magnets, 2½\r\nfeet long and from 4 to 5 inches broad; the induction coils attached to\r\nthese each contain six miles of wire, and a shock from them, if passed\r\nthrough the human body, would be sufficient to destroy life.\r\n\r\n\r\nROTATION-MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected discovery of Rotation-Magnetism by Arago, in 1825,\r\nhas shown practically that every kind of matter is susceptible of\r\nmagnetism; and the recent investigations of Faraday on diamagnetic\r\nsubstances have, under special conditions of meridian or equatorial\r\ndirection, and of solid, fluid, or gaseous inactive conditions of the\r\nbodies, confirmed this important result.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF PENDULUMS ON EACH OTHER.\r\n\r\nAbout a century since it became known, that when two clocks are in\r\naction upon the same shelf, they will disturb each other: that the\r\npendulum of the one will stop that of the other; and that the pendulum\r\nthat was stopped will after a while resume its vibrations, and in its\r\nturn stop that of the other clock. When two clocks are placed near\r\none another in cases very slightly fixed, or when they stand on the\r\nboards of a floor, they will affect a little each other’s pendulum.\r\nMr. Ellicote observed that two clocks resting against the same rail,\r\nwhich agreed to a second for several days, varied one minute thirty-six\r\nseconds in twenty-four hours when separated. The slower, having a\r\nlonger pendulum, set the other in motion in 16-1/3 minutes, and stopped\r\nitself in 36-2/3 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF THE EARTH ASCERTAINED BY THE PENDULUM.\r\n\r\nBy a series of comparisons with Pendulums placed at the surface and\r\nthe interior of the Earth, the Astronomer-Royal has ascertained the\r\nvariation of gravity in descending to the bottom of a deep mine, as\r\nthe Harton coal-pit, near South Shields. By calculations from these\r\nexperiments, he has found the mean density of the earth to be 6·566,\r\nthe specific gravity of water being represented by unity. In other\r\nwords, it has been ascertained by these experiments that if the earth’s\r\nmass possessed every where its average density, it would weigh, bulk\r\nfor bulk, 6·566 times as much as water. It is curious to note the\r\ndifferent values of the earth’s mean density which have been obtained\r\nby different methods. The Schehallien experiment indicated a mean\r\ndensity equal to about 4½; the Cavendish apparatus, repeated by Baily\r\nand Reich, about 5½; and Professor Airy’s pendulum experiment furnishes\r\na value amounting to about 6½.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of the computations of the Astronomer-Royal is:\r\nsupposing a clock adjusted to go true time at the top of the mine, it\r\nwould gain 2¼ seconds per day at the bottom. Or it may be stated thus:\r\nthat gravity is greater at the bottom of a mine than at the top by\r\n1/19190th part.--_Letter to James Mather, Esq., South Shields._ See\r\nalso _Professor Airy’s Lecture_, 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nThe earliest view of Terrestrial Magnetism supposed the existence\r\nof a magnet at the earth’s centre. As this does not accord with the\r\nobservations on declination, inclination, and intensity, Tobias\r\nMeyer gave this fictitious magnet an eccentric position, placing it\r\none-seventh part of the earth’s radius from the centre. Hansteen\r\nimagined that there were two such magnets, different in position\r\nand intensity. Ampère set aside these unsatisfactory hypotheses by\r\nthe view, derived from his discovery, that the earth itself is an\r\nelectro-magnet, magnetised by an electric current circulating about\r\nit from east to west perpendicularly to the plane of the magnetic\r\nmeridian, to which the same currents give direction as well as\r\nmagnetise the ores of iron: the currents being thermo-electric\r\ncurrents, excited by the action of the sun’s heat successively on the\r\ndifferent parts of the earth’s surface as it revolves towards the east.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilbert,[49] who wrote an able work on magnetic and electric\r\nforces in the year 1600, regarded terrestrial magnetism and electricity\r\nas two emanations of a single fundamental source pervading all matter,\r\nand he therefore treated of both at once. According to Gilbert’s idea,\r\nthe earth itself is a magnet; whilst he considered that the inflections\r\nof the lines of equal declination and inclination depend upon the\r\ndistribution of mass, the configuration of continents, or the form and\r\nextent of the deep intervening oceanic basins.\r\n\r\nTill within the last eighty years, it appears to have been the received\r\nopinion that the intensity of terrestrial magnetism was the same at\r\nall parts of the earth’s surface. In the instructions drawn up by\r\nthe French Academy for the expedition under La Pérouse, the first\r\nintimation is given of a contrary opinion. It is recommended that the\r\ntime of vibration of a dipping-needle should be observed at stations\r\nwidely remote, as a test of the equality or difference of the magnetic\r\nintensity; suggesting also that such observations should particularly\r\nbe made at those parts of the earth where the dip was greatest and\r\nwhere it was least. The experiments, whatever their results may have\r\nbeen, which, in compliance with this recommendation, were made in the\r\nexpedition of La Pérouse, perished in its general catastrophe; but the\r\ninstructions survived.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, Hansteen took up the subject, and in 1819 published his\r\ncelebrated work, clearly demonstrating the fluctuations which this\r\nelement has undergone during the last two centuries; confirming in\r\ngreat detail the position of Halley, that “the whole magnetic system is\r\nin motion, that the moving force is very great as extending its effects\r\nfrom pole to pole, and that its motion is not _per saltum_, but a\r\ngradual and regular motion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH AND SOUTH MAGNETIC POLES.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the geographical position of both Magnetic Poles is\r\ndue to the scientific energy of the same navigator, Sir James Ross.\r\nHis observations of the Northern Magnetic Pole were made during the\r\nsecond expedition of his uncle, Sir John Ross (1829-1833); and of\r\nthe Southern during the Antarctic expedition under his own command\r\n(1839-1843). The Northern Magnetic Pole, in 70° 5′ lat., 96° 43′ W.\r\nlong., is 5° of latitude farther from the ordinary pole of the earth\r\nthan the Southern Magnetic Pole, 75° 35′ lat., 154° 10′ E. long.;\r\nwhilst it is also situated farther west from Greenwich than the\r\nNorthern Magnetic Pole. The latter belongs to the great island of\r\nBoothia Felix, which is situated very near the American continent,\r\nand is a portion of the district which Captain Parry had previously\r\nnamed North Somerset. It is not far distant from the western coast of\r\nBoothia Felix, near the promontory of Adelaide, which extends into King\r\nWilliam’s Sound and Victoria Strait.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Magnetic Pole has been directly reached in the same manner\r\nas the Northern Pole. On 17th February 1841, the _Erebus_ penetrated\r\nas far as 76° 12′ S. lat., and 164° E. long. As the inclination was\r\nhere only 88° 40′, it was assumed that the Southern Magnetic Pole\r\nwas about 160 nautical miles distant. Many accurate observations of\r\ndeclination, determining the intersection of the magnetic meridian,\r\nrender it very probable that the South Magnetic Pole is situated in the\r\ninterior of the great Antarctic region of South Victoria Land, west\r\nof the Prince Albert mountains, which approach the South Pole and are\r\nconnected with the active volcano of Erebus, which is 12,400 feet in\r\nheight.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. v.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC STORMS.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious course of the magnetic needle is equally affected by\r\ntime and space, by the sun’s course, and by changes of place on the\r\nearth’s surface. Between the tropics the hour of the day may be known\r\nby the direction of the needle as well as by the oscillations of the\r\nbarometer. It is affected instantly, but transiently, by the northern\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWhen the uniform horary motion of the needle is disturbed by a magnetic\r\nstorm, the perturbation manifests itself _simultaneously_, in the\r\nstrictest sense of the word, over hundreds and thousands of miles of\r\nsea and land, or propagates itself by degrees in short intervals every\r\nwhere over the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nAmong numerous examples of perturbations occurring simultaneously and\r\nextending over wide portions of the earth’s surface, one of the most\r\nremarkable is that of September 25th, 1841, which was observed at\r\nToronto in Canada, at the Cape of Good Hope, at Prague, and partially\r\nin Van Diemen’s Land. Sabine adds, “The English Sunday, on which it is\r\ndeemed sinful, after midnight on Saturday, to register an observation,\r\nand to follow out the great phenomena of creation in their perfect\r\ndevelopment, interrupted the observation in Van Diemen’s Land, where,\r\nin consequence of the difference of the longitude, the magnetic storm\r\nfell on Sunday.”\r\n\r\n  It is but justice to add, that to the direct instrumentality of the\r\n  British Association we are indebted for this system of observation,\r\n  which would not have been possible without some such machinery\r\n  for concerted action. It being known that the magnetic needle is\r\n  subject to oscillations, the nature, the periods, and the laws\r\n  of which were unascertained, under the direction of a committee\r\n  of the Association _magnetic observatories_ were established in\r\n  various places for investigating these strange disturbances. As\r\n  might have been anticipated, regularly recurring perturbations were\r\n  noted, depending on the hour of the day and the season of the year.\r\n  Magnetic storms were observed to sweep simultaneously over the\r\n  whole face of the earth, and these too have now been ascertained to\r\n  follow certain periodic laws.\r\n\r\n  But the most startling result of the combined magnetic observations\r\n  is the discovery of marked perturbations recurring at intervals of\r\n  ten years; a period which seemed to have no analogy to any thing\r\n  in the universe, but which M. Schwabe has found to correspond\r\n  with the variation of the spots on the sun, both attaining their\r\n  maximum and minimum developments at the same time. Here, for the\r\n  present, the discovery stops; but that which is now an unexplained\r\n  coincidence may hereafter supply the key to the nature and source\r\n  of Terrestrial Magnetism: or, as Dr. Lloyd observes, this system of\r\n  magnetic observation has gone beyond our globe, and opened a new\r\n  range for inquiry, by showing us that this wondrous agent has power\r\n  in other parts of the solar system.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILIAR GALVANIC EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nBy means of the galvanic agency a variety of surprising effects have\r\nbeen produced. Gunpowder, cotton, and other inflammable substances have\r\nbeen set on fire; charcoal has been made to burn with a brilliant white\r\nflame; water has been decomposed into its elementary parts; metals\r\nhave been melted and set on fire; fragments of diamond, charcoal, and\r\nplumbago have been dispersed as if evaporated; platina, the hardest\r\nand the heaviest of the metals, has been melted as readily as wax in\r\nthe flame of a candle; the sapphire, quartz, magnesia, lime, and the\r\nfirmest compounds in nature, have been fused. Its effects on the animal\r\nsystem are no less surprising.\r\n\r\nThe agency of galvanism explains why porter has a different and more\r\npleasant taste when drunk out of a pewter-pot than out of glass or\r\nearthenware; why works of metal which are soldered together soon\r\ntarnish in the place where the metals are joined; and why the copper\r\nsheathing of ships, when fastened with iron nails, is soon corroded\r\nabout the place of contact. In all these cases a galvanic circle is\r\nformed which produces the effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIAMESE TWINS GALVANISED.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the Siamese twins, brought to England in\r\nthe year 1829, were united by a jointed cartilaginous band. A silver\r\ntea spoon being placed on the tongue of one of the twins and a disc of\r\nzinc on the tongue of the other, the moment the two metals were brought\r\ninto contact both the boys exclaimed, “Sour, sour;” thus proving that\r\nthe galvanic influence passed from the one to the other through the\r\nconnecting band.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINUTE AND VAST BATTERIES.\r\n\r\nDr. Wollaston made a simple apparatus out of a silver thimble, with its\r\ntop cut off. It was then partially flattened, and a small plate of zinc\r\nbeing introduced into it, the apparatus was immersed in a weak solution\r\nof sulphuric acid. With this minute battery, Dr. Wollaston was able to\r\nfuse a wire of platinum 1/3000th of an inch in diameter--a degree of\r\ntenuity to which no one had ever succeeded in drawing it.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle (that of introducing a plate of zinc between\r\ntwo plates of other metals) Mr. Children constructed his immense\r\nbattery, the zinc plates of which measured six feet by two feet eight\r\ninches; each plate of zinc being placed between two of copper, and each\r\ntriad of plates being enclosed in a separate cell. With this powerful\r\napparatus a wire of platinum, 1/10th of an inch in diameter and upwards\r\nof five feet long, was raised to a red heat, visible even in the broad\r\nglare of daylight.\r\n\r\nThe great battery at the Royal Institution, with which Sir Humphry Davy\r\ndiscovered the composition of the fixed alkalies, was of immense power.\r\nIt consisted of 200 separate parts, each composed of ten double plates,\r\nand each plate containing thirty-two square inches; the number of\r\ndouble plates being 2000, and the whole surface 128,000 square inches.\r\n\r\nMr. Highton, C.E., has made a battery which exposes a surface of only\r\n1/100th part of an inch: it consists of but one cell; it is less than\r\n1/10000th part of a cubic inch, and yet it produces electricity more\r\nthan enough to overcome all the resistance in the inventor’s brother’s\r\npatent Gold-leaf Telegraph, and works the same powerfully. It is, in\r\nshort, a battery which, although _it will go through the eye of a\r\nneedle_, will yet work a telegraph well. Mr. Highton had previously\r\nconstructed a battery in size less than 1/40th of a cubic inch: this\r\nbattery, he found, would for a month together ring a telegraph-bell ten\r\nmiles off.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC INCANDESCENCE OF CHARCOAL POINTS.\r\n\r\nThe most splendid phenomenon of this kind is the combustion of charcoal\r\npoints. Pointed pieces of the residuum obtained from gas retorts will\r\nanswer best, or Bunsen’s composition may be used for this purpose. Put\r\ntwo such charcoal points in immediate contact with the wires of your\r\nbattery; bring the points together, and they will begin to burn with\r\na dazzling white light. The charcoal points of the large apparatus\r\nbelonging to the Royal Institution became incandescent at a distance of\r\n1/30th of an inch; when the distance was gradually increased till they\r\nwere four inches asunder, they continued to burn with great intensity,\r\nand a permanent stream of light played between them. Professor Bunsen\r\nobtained a similar flame from a battery of four pairs of plates,\r\nits carbon surface containing 29 feet. The heat of this flame is so\r\nintense, that stout platinum wire, sapphire, quartz, talc, and lime\r\nare reduced by it to the liquid form. It is worthy of remark, that no\r\ncombustion, properly so called, takes place in the charcoal itself,\r\nwhich sustains only an extremely minute loss in its weight and becomes\r\nrather denser at the points. The phenomenon is attended with a still\r\nmore vivid brightness if the charcoal points are placed in a vacuum,\r\nor in any of those gases which are not supporters of combustion.\r\nInstead of two charcoal points, one only need be used if the following\r\narrangement is adopted: lay the piece of charcoal on some quicksilver\r\nthat is connected with one pole of the battery, and complete the\r\ncircuit from the other pole by means of a strip of platinum. When\r\nProfessor Peschel used a piece of well-burnt coke in the manner just\r\ndescribed, he obtained a light which was almost intolerable to the eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1793, Volta announced to the Royal Society his discovery\r\nof the development of electricity in metallic bodies. Galvani had given\r\nthe name of Animal Electricity to the power which caused spontaneous\r\nconvulsions in the limbs of frogs when the divided nerves were\r\nconnected by a metallic wire. Volta, however, saw the true cause of the\r\nphenomena described by Galvani. Observing that the effects were far\r\ngreater when the connecting medium consisted of two different kinds\r\nof metal, he inferred that the principle of excitation existed in the\r\nmetals, and not in the nerves of the animal; and he assumed that the\r\nexciting fluid was ordinary electricity, produced by the contact of the\r\ntwo metals; the convulsions of the frog consequently arose from the\r\nelectricity thus developed passing along its nerves and muscles.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 Volta invented what is now called the Voltaic Pile, or compound\r\nGalvanic circle.\r\n\r\n  The term Animal Electricity (says Dr. Whewell) has been superseded\r\n  by others, of which _Galvanism_ is the most familiar; but I think\r\n  that Volta’s office in this discovery is of a much higher and more\r\n  philosophical kind than that of Galvani; and it would on this\r\n  account be more fitting to employ the term _Voltaic Electricity_,\r\n  which, indeed, is very commonly used, especially by our most\r\n  recent and comprehensive writers. The _Voltaic pile_ was a more\r\n  important step in the history of electricity than the Leyden jar\r\n  had been--_Hist. Ind. Sciences_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n  No one who wishes to judge impartially of the scientific history\r\n  of these times and of its leaders, will consider Galvani and\r\n  Volta as equals, or deny the vast superiority of the latter over\r\n  all his opponents or fellow-workers, more especially over those\r\n  of the Bologna school. We shall scarcely again find in one man\r\n  gifts so rich and so calculated for research as were combined\r\n  in Volta. He possessed that “incomprehensible talent,” as Dove\r\n  has called it, for separating the essential from the immaterial\r\n  in complicated phenomena; that boldness of invention which must\r\n  precede experiment, controlled by the most strict and cautious\r\n  mode of manipulation; that unremitting attention which allows no\r\n  circumstance to pass unnoticed; lastly, with so much acuteness,\r\n  so much simplicity, so much grandeur of conception, combined with\r\n  such depth of thought, he had a hand which was the hand of a\r\n  workman.--_Jameson’s Journal_, No. 106.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLTAIC BATTERY AND THE GYMNOTUS.\r\n\r\n“We boast of our Voltaic Batteries,” says Mr. Smee. “I should hardly\r\nbe believed if I were to say that I did not feel pride in having\r\nconstructed my own, especially when I consider the extensive operations\r\nwhich it has conducted. But when I compare my battery with the battery\r\nwhich nature has given to the electrical eel and the torpedo, how\r\ninsignificant are human operations compared with those of the Architect\r\nof living beings! The stupendous electric eel in the Polytechnic\r\nInstitution, when he seeks to kill his prey, encloses him in a circle;\r\nthen, by volition, causes the voltaic force to be produced, and the\r\nhapless creature is instantly killed. It would probably require ten\r\nthousand of my artificial batteries to effect the same object, as\r\nthe creature is killed _instanter_ on receiving the shock. As much,\r\nhowever, as my battery is inferior to that of the electric fish, so\r\nis man superior to the same animal. Man is endowed with a power of\r\nmind competent to appreciate the force of matter, and is thus enabled\r\nto make the battery. The eel can but use the specific apparatus which\r\nnature has bestowed upon it.”\r\n\r\nSome observations upon the electric current around the gymnotus, and\r\nnotes of experiments with this and other electric fish, will be found\r\nin _Things not generally Known_, p. 199.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC CURRENTS IN MINES.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Mr. R. W. Fox, from theory entertaining a belief\r\nthat a connection existed between voltaic action in the interior of\r\nthe earth and the arrangement of metalliferous veins, and also the\r\nprogressive increase of temperature in the strata as we descend from\r\nthe surface, endeavoured to verify the same from experiment in the mine\r\nof Huel Jewel, in Cornwall. His apparatus consisted of small plates\r\nof sheet-copper, which were fixed in contact with a plate in the veins\r\nwith copper nails, or else wedged closely against them with wooden\r\nprops stretched across the galleries. Between two of these plates,\r\nat different stations, a communication was made by means of a copper\r\nwire 1/20th of an inch in diameter, which included a galvanometer\r\nin its circuit. In some instances 300 fathoms of copper wire were\r\nemployed. It was then found that the intensity of the voltaic current\r\nwas generally greater in proportion to the greater abundance of copper\r\nore in the veins, and in some degree to the depth of the stations.\r\nHence Mr. Fox’s discovery promised to be of practical utility to the\r\nminer in discovering the relative quantity of ore in the veins, and the\r\ndirections in which it most abounds.\r\n\r\nThe result of extended experiments, mostly made by Mr. Robert Hunt,\r\nhas not, however, confirmed Mr. Fox’s views. It has been found that\r\nthe voltaic currents detected in the lodes are due to the chemical\r\ndecomposition going on there; and the more completely this process\r\nof decomposition is established, the more powerful are the voltaic\r\ncurrents. Meanwhile these have nothing whatever to do with the increase\r\nof temperature with depth. Recent observations, made in the deep mines\r\nof Cornwall under the direction of Mr. Fox, do not appear consistent\r\nwith the law of thermic increase as formerly established, the shallow\r\nmines giving a higher ratio of increase than the deeper ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMS OF ELECTRIC KNOWLEDGE.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries and a half ago, Gilbert recognised that the property of\r\nattracting light substances when rubbed, be their nature what it may,\r\nis not peculiar to amber, which is a condensed earthy juice cast up by\r\nthe waves of the sea, and in which flying insects, ants, and worms lie\r\nentombed as in eternal sepulchres. The force of attraction (Gilbert\r\ncontinues) belongs to a whole class of very different substances, as\r\nglass, sulphur, sealing-wax, and all resinous substances--rock crystal\r\nand all precious stones, alum and rock-salt. Gilbert measured the\r\nstrength of the excited electricity by means of a small needle--not\r\nmade of iron--which moved freely on a pivot, and perfectly similar to\r\nthe apparatus used by Haüy and Brewster in testing the electricity\r\nexcited in minerals by heat and friction. “Friction,” says Gilbert\r\nfurther, “is productive of a stronger effect in dry than in humid air;\r\nand rubbing with silk cloths is most advantageous.”\r\n\r\nOtto von Guerike, the inventor of the air-pump, was the first who\r\nobserved any thing more than mere phenomena of attraction. In his\r\nexperiments with a rubbed piece of sulphur he recognised the\r\nphenomena of repulsion, which subsequently led to the establishment\r\nof the laws of the sphere of action and of the distribution of\r\nelectricity. _He heard the first sound, and saw the first light, in\r\nartificially-produced electricity._ In an experiment instituted by\r\nNewton in 1675, the first traces of an electric charge in a rubbed\r\nplate of glass were seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE AND ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nProfessor Tyndall has shown that all variations of temperature, in\r\nmetals at least, excite electricity. When the wires of a galvanometer\r\nare brought in contact with the two ends of a heated poker, the prompt\r\ndeflection of the galvanometer-needle indicates that a current of\r\nelectricity has been sent through the instrument. Even the two ends of\r\na spoon, one of which has been dipped in hot water, serve to develop an\r\nelectric current; and in cutting a hot beefsteak with a steel knife and\r\na silver fork there is an excitement of electricity. The mere heat of\r\nthe finger is sufficient to cause the deflection of the galvanometer;\r\nand when ice is applied to the part that has been previously warmed,\r\nthe galvanometer-needle is deflected in the contrary direction. A small\r\ninstrument invented by Melloni is so extremely sensitive of the action\r\nof heat, that electricity is excited when the hand is held six inches\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAST ARRANGEMENT OF ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nProfessor Faraday has shown that the Electricity which decomposes,\r\nand that which is evolved in the decomposition of, a certain quantity\r\nof matter, are alike. What an enormous quantity of electricity,\r\ntherefore, is required for the decomposition of a single grain of\r\nwater! It must be in quantity sufficient to sustain a platinum wire\r\n1/104th of an inch in thickness red-hot in contact with the air\r\nfor three minutes and three-quarters. It would appear that 800,000\r\ncharges of a Leyden battery, charged by thirty turns of a very large\r\nand powerful plate-machine in full action, are necessary to supply\r\nelectricity sufficient to decompose a single grain of water, or to\r\nequal the quantity of electricity which is naturally associated with\r\nthe elements of that grain of water, endowing them with their mutual\r\nchemical affinity. Now the above quantity of electricity, if passed at\r\nonce through the head of a rat or a cat, would kill it as by a flash of\r\nlightning. The quantity is, indeed, equal to that which is developed\r\nfrom a charged thunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY ELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nProfessor Andrews, by an ingenious arrangement, is enabled to show that\r\nwater is decomposed by the common machine; and by using an electrical\r\nkite, he was able, in fine weather, to produce decomposition, although\r\nso slowly that only 1/700000th of a grain of water was decomposed per\r\nhour. Faraday has proved that the decomposition of one single grain of\r\nwater produces more electricity than is contained in the most powerful\r\nflash of lightning.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY IN BREWING.\r\n\r\nMr. Black, a practical writer upon Brewing, has found that by the\r\npractice of imbedding the fermentation-vats in the earth, and\r\nconnecting them by means of metallic pipes, an electrical current\r\npasses through the beer and causes it to turn sour. As a preventive,\r\nhe proposed to place the vats upon wooden blocks, or on any other\r\nnon-conductors, so that they may be insulated. It has likewise been\r\nascertained that several brewers who had brewed excellent ale on the\r\nsouth side of the street, on removing to the north have failed to\r\nproduce good ale.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC PAPER.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schonbein has prepared paper, as transparent as glass and\r\nimpermeable to water, which develops a very energetic electric force.\r\nBy placing some sheets on each other, and simply rubbing them once or\r\ntwice with the hand, it becomes difficult to separate them. If this\r\nexperiment is performed in the dark, a great number of distinct flashes\r\nmay be perceived between the separated surfaces. The disc of the\r\nelectrophorus, placed on a sheet that has been rubbed, produces sparks\r\nof some inches in length. A thin and very dry sheet of paper, placed\r\nagainst the wall, will adhere strongly to it for several hours if the\r\nhand be passed only once over it. If the same sheet be passed between\r\nthe thumb and fore-finger in the dark, a luminous band will be visible.\r\nHence with this paper may be made powerful and cheap electrical\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF THE ELECTRIC SPARK.\r\n\r\nBy means of Professor Wheatstone’s apparatus, the Duration\r\nof the Electric Spark has been ascertained not to exceed the\r\ntwenty-five-thousandth part of a second. A cannon-ball, if illumined\r\nin its flight by a flash of lightning, would, in consequence of the\r\nmomentary duration of the light, appear to be stationary, and even the\r\nwings of an insect, that move ten thousand times in a second, would\r\nseem at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF ELECTRIC LIGHT.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the velocities of solar, stellar, and terrestrial light,\r\nwhich are all equally refracted in the prism, with the velocity of the\r\nlight of frictional electricity, we are disposed, in accordance with\r\nWheatstone’s ingeniously-conducted experiments, to regard the lowest\r\nratio in which the latter excels the former as 3:2. According to the\r\nlowest results of Wheatstone’s apparatus, electric light traverses\r\n288,000 miles in a second. If we reckon 189,938 miles for stellar\r\nlight, according to Struve, we obtain the difference of 95,776 miles as\r\nthe greater velocity of electricity in one second.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiment described in Wheatstone’s paper (_Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1834), it would appear that the human eye is capable\r\nof perceiving phenomena of light whose duration is limited to the\r\nmillionth part of a second.\r\n\r\nIn Professor Airy’s experiments with the electric telegraph to\r\ndetermine the difference of longitude between Greenwich and Brussels,\r\nthe time spent by the electric current in passing from one observatory\r\nto the other (270 miles) was found to be 0·109″ or rather more than\r\n_the ninth part of a second_; and this determination rests on 2616\r\nobservations: a speed which would “girdle the globe” in ten seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDENTITY OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC ATTRACTION.\r\n\r\nThis vague presentiment of the ancients has been verified in our own\r\ntimes. “When electrum (amber),” says Pliny, “is animated by friction\r\nand heat, it will attract bark and dry leaves precisely as the\r\nloadstone attracts iron.” The same words may be found in the literature\r\nof an Asiatic nation, and occur in a eulogium on the loadstone by the\r\nChinese physicist Knopho, in the fourth century: “The magnet attracts\r\niron as amber does the smallest grain of mustard-seed. It is like\r\na breath of wind, which mysteriously penetrates through both, and\r\ncommunicates itself with the rapidity of an arrow.”\r\n\r\n  Humboldt observed with astonishment on the woody banks of the\r\n  Orinoco, in the sports of the natives, that the excitement of\r\n  electricity by friction was known to these savage races. Children\r\n  may be seen to rub the dry, flat, and shining seeds or husks of a\r\n  trailing plant until they are able to attract threads of cotton\r\n  and pieces of bamboo-cane. What a chasm divides the electric\r\n  pastime of these naked copper-coloured Indians from the discovery\r\n  of a metallic conductor discharging its electric shocks, or a\r\n  pile formed of many chemically-decomposing substances, or a\r\n  light-engendering magnetic apparatus! In such a chasm lie buried\r\n  thousands of years, that compose the history of the intellectual\r\n  development of mankind.--_Humboldt’s Cosmos_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ENGINE.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago a speculative American set the industrial world of\r\nEurope in excitement by this proposition. The Magneto-Electric Machines\r\noften made use of in the case of rheumatic disorders are well known. By\r\nimparting a swift rotation to the magnet of such a machine, we obtain\r\npowerful currents of electricity. If these be conducted through water,\r\nthe latter will be reduced to its two components, oxygen and hydrogen.\r\nBy the combustion of hydrogen water is again generated. If this\r\ncombustion takes place, not in atmospheric air, in which oxygen only\r\nconstitutes a fifth part, but in pure oxygen, and if a bit of chalk be\r\nplaced in the flame, the chalk will be raised to a white heat, and give\r\nus the sun-like Drummond light: at the same time the flame develops a\r\nconsiderable quantity of heat. Now the American inventor proposed to\r\nutilise in this way the gases obtained from electrolytic decomposition;\r\nand asserted that by the combustion a sufficient amount of heat was\r\ngenerated to keep a small steam-engine in action, which again drove his\r\nmagneto-electric machine, decomposed the water, and thus continually\r\nprepared its own fuel. This would certainly have been the most splendid\r\nof all discoveries,--a perpetual motion which, besides the force that\r\nkept it going, generated light like the sun, and warmed all around it.\r\nThe affair, however, failed, as was predicted by those acquainted with\r\nthe physical investigations which bear upon the subject.--_Professor\r\nHelmholtz._\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC CLOCK AND WATCH.\r\n\r\nIn the Museum of the Royal Society are two curiosities of the\r\nseventeenth century which are objects of much interest in association\r\nwith the electric discoveries of our day. These are a Clock, described\r\nby the Count Malagatti (who accompanied Cosmo III., Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, to inspect the Museum in 1669) as more worthy of observation\r\nthan all the other objects in the cabinet. Its “movements are derived\r\nfrom the vicinity of a loadstone, and it is so adjusted as to discover\r\nthe distance of countries at sea by the longitude.” The analogy\r\nbetween this clock and the electric clock of the present day is very\r\nremarkable. Of kindred interest is “Hook’s Magnetic Watch,” often\r\nalluded to in the Royal Society’s Journal-book of 1669 as “going slower\r\nor faster according to the greater or less distance of the loadstone,\r\nand so moving regularly in any posture.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEATSTONE’S ELECTRO-MAGNETIC CLOCK.\r\n\r\nIn this ingenious invention, the object of Professor Wheatstone was\r\nto enable a simple clock to indicate exactly the same time in as many\r\ndifferent places, distant from each other, as may be required. A\r\nstandard clock in an observatory, for example, would thus keep in order\r\nanother clock in each apartment, and that too with such accuracy, that\r\n_all of them, however numerous, will beat dead seconds audibly with as\r\ngreat precision as the standard astronomical time-piece with which\r\nthey are connected_. But, besides this, the subordinate time-pieces\r\nthus regulated require none of the mechanism for maintaining or\r\nregulating the power. They consist simply of a face, with its second,\r\nminute, and hour hands, and a train of wheels which communicate motion\r\nfrom the action of the second-hand to that of the hour-hand, in the\r\nsame manner as an ordinary clock-train. Nor is this invention confined\r\nto observatories and large establishments. The great horologe of St.\r\nPaul’s might, by a suitable network of wires, or even by the existing\r\nmetallic pipes of the metropolis, be made to command and regulate all\r\nthe other steeple-clocks in the city, and even every clock within the\r\nprecincts of its metallic bounds. As railways and telegraphs extend\r\nfrom London nearly to the remotest cities and villages, the sensation\r\nof time may be transmitted along with the elements of language; and\r\nthe great cerebellum of the metropolis may thus constrain by its\r\nsympathies, and regulate by its power, the whole nervous system of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A COMMON CLOCK ELECTRIC.\r\n\r\nM. Kammerer of Belgium effects this by an addition to any clock\r\nwhereby it is brought into contact with the two poles of a galvanic\r\nbattery, the wires from which communicate with a drum moved by the\r\nclockwork; and every fifteen seconds the current is changed, the\r\npositive and the negative being transmitted alternately. A wire\r\nis continued from the drum to the electric clock, the movement of\r\nwhich, through the plate-glass dial, is seen to be two pairs of small\r\nstraight electro-magnets, each pair having their ends opposite to the\r\nother pair, with about half an inch space between. Within this space\r\nthere hangs a vertical steel bar, suspended from a spindle at the\r\ntop. The rod has two slight projections on each side parallel to the\r\nends of the wire-coiled magnets. When the electric current comes on\r\nthe wire from the positive end of the battery (through the drum of\r\nthe regulator-clock) the positive magnets attract the bar to it, the\r\ndistance being perhaps the sixteenth of an inch. When, at the end of\r\nfifteen seconds, the negative pole operates, repulsion takes effect,\r\nand the bar moves to the opposite side. This oscillating bar gives\r\nmotion to a wheel which turns the minute and hour hands.\r\n\r\nM. Kammerer states, that if the galvanic battery be attached to any\r\nparticular standard clock, any number of clocks, wherever placed, in a\r\ncity or kingdom, and communicating with this by a wire, will indicate\r\nprecisely the same time. Such is the precision, that the sounds\r\nof three clocks thus beating simultaneously have been mistaken as\r\nproceeding from one clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. FRANKLIN’S ELECTRICAL KITE.\r\n\r\nSeveral philosophers had observed that lightning and electricity\r\npossessed many common properties; and the light which accompanied\r\nthe explosion, the crackling noise made by the flame, and other\r\nphenomena, made them suspect that lightning might be electricity in\r\na highly powerful state. But this connection was merely the subject\r\nof conjecture until, in the year 1750, Dr. Franklin suggested an\r\nexperiment to determine the question. While he was waiting for the\r\nbuilding of a spire at Philadelphia, to which he intended to attach\r\nhis wire, the experiment was successfully made at Marly-la-Ville, in\r\nFrance, in the year 1752; when lightning was actually drawn from the\r\nclouds by means of a pointed wire, and it was proved to be really the\r\nelectric fluid.\r\n\r\n  Almost every early electrical discovery of importance was made by\r\n  Fellows of the Royal Society, and is to be found recorded in the\r\n  _Philosophical Transactions_. In the forty-fifth volume occurs the\r\n  first mention of Dr. Franklin’s name, and his theory of positive\r\n  and negative electricity. In 1756 he was elected into the Society,\r\n  “without any fee or other payment.” His previous communications\r\n  to the _Transactions_, particularly the account of his electrical\r\n  kite, had excited great interest. (_Weld’s History of the\r\n  Royal Society._) It is thus described by him in a letter dated\r\n  Philadelphia, October 1, 1752:\r\n\r\n  “As frequent mention is made in the public papers from Europe\r\n  of the success of the Marly-la-Ville experiment for drawing the\r\n  electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected\r\n  on high buildings, &c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be\r\n  informed that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia,\r\n  though made in a different and more easy manner, which any one may\r\n  try, as follows:\r\n\r\n  Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so\r\n  long as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk\r\n  handkerchief when extended. Tie the comers of the handkerchief\r\n  to the extremities of the cross; so you have the body of a kite,\r\n  which, being properly accommodated with a tail, loop, and string,\r\n  will rise in the air like a kite made of paper; but this, being of\r\n  silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without\r\n  tearing. To the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be\r\n  fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more above the\r\n  wood. To the end of the twine, next the band, is to be tied a silk\r\n  ribbon; and where the twine and silk join a key may be fastened.\r\n\r\n  The kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming\r\n  on, and the person who holds the string must stand within a door\r\n  or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be\r\n  wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame\r\n  of the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder-clouds come\r\n  over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from\r\n  them; and the kite, with all the twine, will be electrified; and\r\n  the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way, and be\r\n  attracted by an approaching finger.\r\n\r\n  When the rain has wet the kite and twine, so that it can conduct\r\n  the electric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully\r\n  from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this key the phial\r\n  may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may\r\n  be kindled, and all the other electrical experiments be performed\r\n  which are usually done by the help of a rubbed-glass globe or tube;\r\n  and thus the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning\r\n  is completely demonstrated.”--_Philosophical Transactions._\r\n\r\nOf all this great man’s (Franklin’s) scientific excellencies, the most\r\nremarkable is the smallness, the simplicity, the apparent inadequacy\r\nof the means which he employed in his experimental researches. His\r\ndiscoveries were all made with hardly any apparatus at all; and if\r\nat any time he had been led to employ instruments of a somewhat less\r\nordinary description, he never rested satisfied until he had, as it\r\nwere, afterwards translated the process by resolving the problem with\r\nsuch simple machinery that you might say he had done it wholly unaided\r\nby apparatus. The experiments by which the identity of lightning and\r\nelectricity was demonstrated were made with a sheet of brown paper, a\r\nbit of twine or silk thread, and an iron key!--_Lord Brougham._[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nFATAL EXPERIMENT WITH LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nThese experiments are not without danger; and a flash of lightning has\r\nbeen found to be a very unmanageable instrument. In 1753, M. Richman,\r\nat St. Petersburg, was making an experiment of this kind by drawing\r\nlightning into his room, when, incautiously bringing his head too near\r\nthe wire, he was struck dead by the flash, which issued from it like a\r\nglobe of blue fire, accompanied by a dreadful explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARADAY’S ELECTRICAL ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe following are selected from the very able series of lectures\r\ndelivered by Professor Faraday at the Royal Institution:\r\n\r\n  _The Two Electricities._--After having shown by various experiments\r\n  the attractions and repulsions of light substances from excited\r\n  glass and from an excited tube of gutta-percha, Professor Faraday\r\n  proceeds to point out the difference in the character of the\r\n  electricity produced by the friction of the two substances. The\r\n  opposite characters of the electricity evolved by the friction\r\n  of glass and of that excited by the friction of gutta-percha\r\n  and shellac are exhibited by several experiments, in which the\r\n  attraction of the positive and negative electricities to each other\r\n  and the neutralisation of electrical action on the combination\r\n  of the two forces are distinctly observable. Though adopting the\r\n  terms “positive” and “negative” in distinguishing the electricity\r\n  excited by glass from that excited by gutta-percha and resinous\r\n  bodies, Professor Faraday is strongly opposed to the Franklinian\r\n  theory from which these terms are derived. According to Franklin’s\r\n  view of the nature of electrical excitement, it arises from the\r\n  disturbance, by friction or other means, of the natural quantity\r\n  of one electric fluid which is possessed by all bodies; an excited\r\n  piece of glass having more than its natural share, which has\r\n  been taken from the rubber, the latter being consequently in a\r\n  minus or negative state. This theory Professor Faraday considers\r\n  to be opposed to the distinct characteristic actions of the two\r\n  forces; and, in his opinion, it is impossible to deprive any body\r\n  of electricity, and reduce it to the minus state of Franklin’s\r\n  hypothesis. Taking a Zamboni’s pile, he applies its two ends\r\n  separately to an electrometer, to show that each end produces\r\n  opposite kinds of electricity, and that the zero, or absence of\r\n  electrical excitement, only exists in the centre of the pile. To\r\n  prove how completely the two electricities neutralise each other,\r\n  an excited rod of gutta-percha and the piece of flannel with which\r\n  it has been rubbed are laid on the top of the electrometer without\r\n  any sign of electricity whilst they are together; but when either\r\n  is removed, the gold leaves diverge with positive and negative\r\n  electricity alternately. The Professor dwells strongly on the\r\n  peculiarity of the dual force of electricity, which, in respect\r\n  of its duality, is unlike any other force in nature. He then\r\n  contrasts its phenomena of instantaneous conduction with those of\r\n  the somewhat analogous force of heat; and he illustrates by several\r\n  striking experiments the peculiar property which static electricity\r\n  possesses of being spread only over the surfaces of bodies. A metal\r\n  ice-pail is placed on an insulated stand and electrified, and a\r\n  metal ball suspended by a string is introduced, and touches the\r\n  bottom and sides without having any electricity imparted to it,\r\n  but on touching the outside it becomes strongly electrical. The\r\n  experiment is repeated with a wooden tub with the same result;\r\n  and Professor Faraday mentions the still more remarkable manner\r\n  in which he has proved the surface distribution of electricity\r\n  by having a small chamber constructed and covered with tinfoil,\r\n  which can be insulated; and whilst torrents of electricity are\r\n  being evolved from the external surface, he enters it with a\r\n  galvanometer, and cannot perceive the slightest manifestation of\r\n  electricity within.\r\n\r\n  _The Two Threads._--A curious experiment is made with two kinds\r\n  of thread used as the conducting force. From the electric machine\r\n  on the table a silk thread is first carried to the indicator a\r\n  yard or two off, and is shown to be a non-conductor when the glass\r\n  tube is rubbed and applied to the machine (although the silk, when\r\n  wetted, conducted); while a metallic thread of the same thickness,\r\n  when treated in the same way, conducts the force so much as to\r\n  vehemently agitate the gold leaves within the indicator.\r\n\r\n  _Non-conducting Bodies._--The action that occurs in bodies which\r\n  cannot conduct is the most important part of electrical science.\r\n  The principle is illustrated by the attraction and repulsion of\r\n  an electrified ball of gilt paper by a glass tube, between which\r\n  and the ball a sheet of shellac is suspended. The nearer a ball of\r\n  another description--an unelectrical insulated body--is brought\r\n  to the Leyden jar when charged, the greater influence it is seen\r\n  to possess over the gold leaf within the indicator, by induction,\r\n  not by conduction. The questions, how electricities attract each\r\n  other, what kind of electricity is drawn from the machine to the\r\n  hand, how the hand was electric, are thus illustrated. To show the\r\n  divers operations of this wonderful force, a tub (a bad conductor)\r\n  is placed by the electric machine. When the latter is charged, a\r\n  ball, having been electrified from it, is held in the tub, and\r\n  rattles against its sides and bottom. On the application of the\r\n  ball to the indicator, the gold leaf is shown not to move, whereas\r\n  it is agitated manifestly when the same process is gone through\r\n  with the exception that the ball is made to touch the outside only\r\n  of the tub. Similar experiments with a ball in an ice-pail and\r\n  a vessel of wire-gauze, into the latter of which is introduced a\r\n  mouse, which is shown to receive no shock, and not to be frightened\r\n  at all; while from the outside of the vessel electric sparks are\r\n  rapidly produced. This latter demonstration proves that, as the\r\n  mouse, so men and women, might be safe inside a building with\r\n  proper conductors while lightning played about the exterior. The\r\n  wire-gauze being turned inside out, the principle is shown to be\r\n  irreversible in spite of the change--what has been the unelectrical\r\n  inside of the vessel being now, when made the outside portion,\r\n  capable of receiving and transmitting the power, while the original\r\n  outside is now unelectrical.\r\n\r\n  _Repulsion of Bodies._--A remarkable and playful experiment, by\r\n  which the repulsion of bodies similarly electrified is illustrated,\r\n  consists in placing a basket containing a heap of small pieces\r\n  of paper on an insulated stand, and connecting it with the prime\r\n  conductor of the electrical machine; when the pieces of paper\r\n  rise rapidly after each other into the air, and descend on the\r\n  lecture-table like a fall of snow. The effect is greatly increased\r\n  when a metal disc is substituted for the basket.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN OF THE LEYDEN JAR.\r\n\r\nMuschenbroek and Linnæus had made various experiments of a strong kind\r\nwith water and wire. The former, as appears from a letter of his to\r\nRéaumur, filled a small bottle with water, and having corked it up,\r\npassed a wire through the cork into the bottle. Having rubbed the\r\nvessel on the outside and suspended it to the electric machine, he was\r\nsurprised to find that on trying to pull the wire out he was subjected\r\nto an awfully severe shock in his joints and his whole body, such as he\r\ndeclared he would not suffer again for any experiment. Hence the Leyden\r\njar, which owes its name to the University of Leyden, with which, we\r\nbelieve, Muschenbroek was connected.--_Faraday._\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGER TO GUNPOWDER MAGAZINES.\r\n\r\nBy the illustration of a gas globule, which is ignited from a spark by\r\ninduction, Mr. Faraday has proved in a most interesting manner that the\r\ncorrugated-iron roofs of some gunpowder-magazines,--on the subject of\r\nwhich he had often been consulted by the builders, with a view to the\r\ngreater safety of these manufactories,--are absolutely dangerous by the\r\nlaws of induction; as, by the return of induction, while a storm was\r\ndischarging itself a mile or two off, a secondary spark might ignite\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL CRYSTALS AND MINERALS.--“THE CROSSE MITE.”\r\n\r\nAmong the experimenters on Electricity in our time who have largely\r\ncontributed to the “Curiosities of Science,” Andrew Crosse is entitled\r\nto special notice. In his school-days he became greatly attached to the\r\nstudy of electricity; and on settling on his paternal estate, Fyne\r\nCourt, on the Quantock Hills in Somersetshire, he there devoted himself\r\nto chemistry, mineralogy, and electricity, pursuing his experiments\r\nwholly independently of theories, and searching only for facts. In\r\nHolwell Cavern, near his residence, he observed the sides and the roof\r\ncovered with Arragonite crystallisations, when his observations led\r\nhim to conclude that the crystallisations were the effects, at least\r\nto some extent, of electricity. This induced him to make the attempt\r\nto form artificial crystals by the same means, which he began in 1807.\r\nHe took some water from the cave, filled a tumbler, and exposed it to\r\nthe action of a voltaic battery excited by water alone, letting the\r\nplatinum-wires of the battery fall on opposite sides of the tumbler\r\nfrom the opposite poles of the battery. After ten days’ constant\r\naction, he produced crystals of carbonate of lime; and on repeating\r\nthe experiment in the dark, he produced them in six days. Thus Mr.\r\nCrosse simulated in his laboratory one of the hitherto most mysterious\r\nprocesses of nature.\r\n\r\nHe pursued this line of research for nearly thirty years at Fyne Court,\r\nwhere his electrical-room and laboratory were on an enormous scale:\r\nthe apparatus had cost some thousands of pounds, and the house was\r\nnearly full of furnaces. He carried an insulated wire above the tops\r\nof the trees around his house to the length of a mile and a quarter,\r\nafterwards shortened to 1800 feet. By this wire, which was brought\r\ninto connection with the apparatus in a chamber, he was enabled to see\r\ncontinually the changes in the state of the atmosphere, and could use\r\nthe fluid so collected for a variety of purposes. In 1816, at a meeting\r\nof country gentlemen, he prophesied that, “by means of electrical\r\nagency, we shall be able to communicate our thoughts simultaneously\r\nwith the uttermost ends of the earth.” Still, though he foresaw\r\nthe powers of the medium, he did not make any experiments in that\r\ndirection, but confined himself to the endeavour to produce crystals\r\nof various kinds. He ultimately obtained forty-one mineral crystals,\r\nor minerals uncrystallised, in the form in which they are produced by\r\nnature, including one sub-sulphate of copper--an entirely new mineral,\r\nneither found in nature nor formed by art previously. His belief was\r\nthat even diamonds might be produced in this way.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosse worked alone in his retreat until 1836, when, attending\r\nthe meeting of the British Association at Bristol, he was induced to\r\nexplain his experiments, for which he was highly complimented by Dr.\r\nBuckland, Dr. Dalton, Professor Sedgwick, and others.[51]\r\n\r\nShortly after Mr. Crosse’s return to Fyne Court, while pursuing his\r\nexperiments for forming crystals from a highly caustic solution out\r\nof contact with atmospheric air, he was greatly surprised by the\r\nappearance of an insect. Black flint, burnt to redness and reduced to\r\npowder, was mixed with carbonate of potash, and exposed to a strong\r\nheat for fifteen minutes; and the mixture was poured into a black-lead\r\ncrucible in an air furnace. It was reduced to powder while warm,\r\nmixed with boiling water, kept boiling for some minutes, and then\r\nhydrochloric acid was added to supersaturation. After being exposed\r\nto voltaic action for twenty-six days, a perfect insect of the Acari\r\ntribe made its appearance, and in the course of a few weeks about a\r\nhundred more. The experiment was repeated in other chemical fluids\r\nwith the like results; and Mr. Weeks of Sandwich afterwards produced\r\nthe Acari inferrocyanerret of potassium. The Acarus of Mr. Crosse was\r\nfound to contribute a new species of that genus, nearly approaching\r\nthe Acari found in cheese and flour, or more nearly, Hermann’s _Acarus\r\ndimidiatus_.\r\n\r\nThis discovery occasioned great excitement. The possibility was denied,\r\nthough Mr. Faraday is said to have stated in the same year that he had\r\nseen similar appearances in his own electrical experiments. Mr. Crosse\r\nwas now accused of impiety and aiming at creation, to which attacks he\r\nthus replied:\r\n\r\n  As to the appearance of the acari under long-continued electrical\r\n  action, I have never in thought, word, or deed given any one a\r\n  right to suppose that I considered them as a creation, or even as a\r\n  formation, from inorganic matter. To create is to form a something\r\n  out of a nothing. To annihilate is to reduce that something to\r\n  a nothing. Both of these, of course, can only be the attributes\r\n  of the Almighty. In fact, I can assure you most sacredly that I\r\n  have never dreamed of any theory sufficient to account for their\r\n  appearance. I confess that I was not a little surprised, and am so\r\n  still, and quite as much as I was when the acari made their first\r\n  appearance. Again, I have never claimed any merit as attached to\r\n  these experiments. It was a matter of chance; I was looking for\r\n  silicious formations, and animal matter appeared instead.\r\n\r\nThese Acari, if removed from their birthplace, lived and propagated;\r\nbut uniformly died on the first recurrence of frost, and were entirely\r\ndestroyed if they fell back into the fluid whence they arose.\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Crosse’s visitors thus describes the vast electrical room at\r\nFyne Court:\r\n\r\n  Here was an immense number of jars and gallipots, containing fluids\r\n  on which electricity was operating for the production of crystals.\r\n  But you are startled in the midst of your observations by the smart\r\n  crackling sound that attends the passage of the electrical spark;\r\n  you hear also the rumbling of distant thunder. The rain is already\r\n  plashing in great drops against the glass, and the sound of the\r\n  passing sparks continues to startle your ear; you see at the window\r\n  a huge brass conductor, with a discharging rod near it passing into\r\n  the floor, and from the one knob to the other sparks are leaping\r\n  with increasing rapidity and noise, every one of which would kill\r\n  twenty men at one blow, if they were linked together hand in hand\r\n  and the spark sent through the circle. From this conductor wires\r\n  pass off without the window, and the electric fluid is conducted\r\n  harmlessly away. Mr. Crosse approached the instrument as boldly as\r\n  if the flowing stream of fire were a harmless spark. Armed with\r\n  his insulated rod, he sent it into his batteries: having charged\r\n  them, he showed how wire was melted, dissipated in a moment, by its\r\n  passage; how metals--silver, gold, and tin--were inflamed and burnt\r\n  like paper, only with most brilliant hues. He showed you a mimic\r\n  aurora and a falling-star, and so proved to you the cause of those\r\n  beautiful phenomena.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosse appears to have produced in all “about 200 varieties of\r\nminerals, exactly resembling in all respects similar ones found in\r\nnature.” He tried also a new plan of extracting gold from its ores\r\nby an electrical process, which succeeded, but was too expensive\r\nfor common use. He was in the habit of saying that he could, like\r\nArchimedes, move the world “if he were able to construct a battery at\r\nonce cheap, powerful, and durable.” His process of extracting metals\r\nfrom their ores has been patented. Among his other useful applications\r\nof electricity are the purifying by its means of brackish or sea-water,\r\nand the improving bad wine and brandy. He agreed with Mr. Quekett\r\nin thinking that it is by electrical action that silica and other\r\nmineral substances are carried into and assimilated by plants. Negative\r\nelectricity Mr. Crosse found favourable to no plants except fungi;\r\nand positive electricity he ascertained to be injurious to fungi, but\r\nfavourable to every thing else.\r\n\r\nMr. Crosse died in 1855. His widow has published a very interesting\r\nvolume of _Memorials_ of the ingenious experimenter, from which we\r\nselect the following:\r\n\r\n  On one occasion Mr. Crosse kept a pair of soles under the electric\r\n  action for three months; and at the end of that time they were\r\n  sent to a friend, whose domestics knew nothing of the experiment.\r\n  Before the cook dressed them, her master asked her whether she\r\n  thought they were fresh, as he had some doubts. She replied that\r\n  she was sure they were fresh; indeed, she said she could swear\r\n  that they were alive yesterday! When served at table they appeared\r\n  like ordinary fish; but when the family attempted to eat them,\r\n  they were found to be perfectly tasteless--the electric action had\r\n  taken away all the essential oil, leaving the fish unfit for food.\r\n  However, the process is exceedingly useful for keeping fish, meat,\r\n  &c. fresh and _good_ for ten days or a fortnight. I have never\r\n  heard a satisfactory explanation of the cause of the antiseptic\r\n  power communicated to water by the passage of the electric current.\r\n  Whether ozone has not something to do with it, may be a question.\r\n  The same effect is produced whichever two dissimilar metals are\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Electric Telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTICIPATIONS OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThe great secret of ubiquity, or at least of instantaneous\r\ntransmission, has ever exercised the ingenuity of mankind in various\r\nromantic myths; and the discovery of certain properties of the\r\nloadstone gave a new direction to these fancies.\r\n\r\nThe earliest anticipation of the Electric Telegraph of this purely\r\nfabulous character forms the subject of one of the _Prolusiones\r\nAcademicæ_ of the learned Italian Jesuit Strada, first published at\r\nRome in the year 1617. Of this poem a free translation appeared in\r\n1750. Strada’s fancy was this: “There is,” he supposes, “a species of\r\nloadstone which possesses such virtue, that if two needles be touched\r\nwith it, and then balanced on separate pivots, and the one be turned in\r\na particular direction, the other will sympathetically move parallel\r\nto it. He then directs each of these needles to be poised and mounted\r\nparallel on a dial having the letters of the alphabet arranged round\r\nit. Accordingly, if one person has one of the dials, and another the\r\nother, by a little pre-arrangement as to details a correspondence can\r\nbe maintained between them at any distance by simply pointing the\r\nneedles to the letters of the required words. Strada, in his poetical\r\nreverie, dreamt that some such sympathy might one day be found to hold\r\nup the Magnesian Stone.”\r\n\r\nStrada’s conceit seems to have made a profound impression on the\r\nmaster-minds of the day. His poem is quoted in many works of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries; and Bishop Wilkins, in his book\r\non Cryptology, is strangely afraid lest his readers should mistake\r\nStrada’s fancy for fact. Wilkins writes: “This invention is altogether\r\nimaginary, having no foundation in any real experiment. You may see it\r\nfrequently confuted in those that treat concerning magnetical virtues.”\r\n\r\nAgain, Addison, in the 241st No. of the _Spectator_, 1712, describes\r\nStrada’s “Chimerical correspondence,” and adds that, “if ever this\r\ninvention should be revived or put in practice,” he “would propose\r\nthat upon the lover’s dial-plate there should be written not only the\r\nfour-and-twenty letters, but several entire words which have always a\r\nplace in passionate epistles, as flames, darts, die, language, absence,\r\nCupid, heart, eyes, being, drown, and the like. This would very much\r\nabridge the lover’s pains in this way of writing a letter, as it would\r\nenable him to express the most useful and significant words with a\r\nsingle touch of the needle.”\r\n\r\nAfter Strada and his commentators comes Henry Van Etten, who shows how\r\n“Claude, being at Paris, and John at Rome, might converse together, if\r\neach had a needle touched by a stone of such virtue that as one moved\r\nitself at Paris the other should be moved at Rome:” he adds, “it is\r\na fine invention, but I do not think there is a magnet in the world\r\nwhich has such virtue; besides, it is inexpedient, for treasons would\r\nbe too frequent and too much protected. (_Recréations Mathématiques_:\r\nsee 5th edition, Paris, 1660, p. 158.) Sir Thomas Browne refers\r\nto this “conceit” as “excellent, and, if the effect would follow,\r\nsomewhat divine;” but he tried the two needles touched with the same\r\nloadstone, and placed in two circles of letters, “one friend keeping\r\none and another the other, and agreeing upon an hour when they will\r\ncommunicate,” and found the tradition a failure that, “at what distance\r\nof place soever, when one needle shall be removed unto any letter, the\r\nother, by a wonderful sympathy, will move unto the same.” (See _Vulgar\r\nErrors_, book ii. ch. iii.)\r\n\r\nGlanvill’s _Vanity of Dogmatizing_, a work published in 1661, however,\r\ncontains the most remarkable allusion to the prevailing telegraphic\r\nfancy. Glanvill was an enthusiast, and he clearly predicts the\r\ndiscovery and general adoption of the electric telegraph. “To confer,”\r\nhe says, “at the distance of the Indies by sympathetic conveyance may\r\nbe as usual to future times as to us in a literary correspondence.” By\r\nthe word “sympathetic” he evidently intended to convey magnetic agency;\r\nfor he subsequently treats of “conference at a distance by impregnated\r\nneedles,” and describes the device substantially as it is given by Sir\r\nThomas Browne, adding, that though it did not then answer, “by some\r\nother such way of magnetic efficiency it may hereafter with success be\r\nattempted, when magical history shall be enlarged by riper inspection;\r\nand ’tis not unlikely but that present discoveries might be improved\r\nto the performance.” This may be said to close the most speculative or\r\nmythical period in reference to the subject of electro-telegraphy.\r\n\r\nElectricians now began to be sedulous in their experiments upon the\r\nnew force by friction, then the only known method of generating\r\nelectricity. In 1729, Stephen Gray, a pensioner of the Charter-house,\r\ncontrived a method of making electrical signals through a wire 765\r\nfeet long; yet this most important experiment did not excite much\r\nattention. Next Dr. Watson, of the Royal Society, experimented on the\r\npossibility of transmitting electricity through a large circuit from\r\nthe simple fact of Le Monnier’s account of his feeling the stroke\r\nof the electrified fires through two of the basins of the Tuileries\r\n(which occupy nearly an acre), by means of an iron chain lying upon\r\nthe ground and stretched round half their circumference. In 1745, Dr.\r\nWatson, assisted by several members of the Royal Society, made a series\r\nof experiments to ascertain how far electricity could be conveyed by\r\nmeans of conductors. “They caused the shock to pass across the Thames\r\nat Westminster Bridge, the circuit being completed by making use of the\r\nriver for one part of the chain of communication. One end of the wire\r\ncommunicated with the coating of a charged phial, the other being held\r\nby the observer, who in his other hand held an iron rod which he dipped\r\ninto the river. On the opposite side of the river stood a gentleman,\r\nwho likewise dipped an iron rod in the river with one hand, and in the\r\nother held a wire the extremity of which might be brought into contact\r\nwith the wire of the phial. Upon making the discharge, the shock was\r\nfelt simultaneously by both the observers.” (_Priestley’s History of\r\nElectricity._) Subsequently the same parties made experiments near\r\nShooter’s Hill, when the wires formed a circuit of four miles, and\r\nconveyed the shock with equal facility,--“a distance which without\r\ntrial,” they observed, “was too great to be credited.”[52] These\r\nexperiments in 1747 established two great principles: 1, that the\r\nelectric current is transmissible along nearly two miles and a half of\r\niron wire; 2, that the electric current may be completed by burying the\r\npoles in the earth at the above distance.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, 1748, Benjamin Franklin performed his celebrated\r\nexperiments on the banks of the Schuylkill, near Philadelphia; which\r\nbeing interrupted by the hot weather, they were concluded by a picnic,\r\nwhen spirits were fired by an electric spark sent through a wire in the\r\nriver, and a turkey was killed by the electric shock, and roasted by\r\nthe electric jack before a fire kindled by the electrified bottle.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1753, there appeared in the _Scots’ Magazine_, vol. xv.,\r\ndefinite proposals for the construction of an electric telegraph,\r\nrequiring as many conducting wires as there are letters in the\r\nalphabet; it was also proposed to converse by chimes, by substituting\r\nbells for the balls. A similar system of telegraphing was next invented\r\nby Joseph Bozolus, a Jesuit, at Rome; and next by the great Italian\r\nelectrician Tiberius Cavallo, in his treatise on Electricity.\r\n\r\nIn 1787, Arthur Young, when travelling in France, saw a model working\r\ntelegraph by M. Lomond: “You write two or three words on a paper,” says\r\nYoung; “he takes it with him into a room, and turns a machine enclosed\r\nin a cylindrical case, at the top of which is an electrometer--a\r\nsmall fine pith-ball; a wire connects with a similar cylinder and\r\nelectrometer in a distant apartment; and his wife, by remarking the\r\ncorresponding motions of the ball, writes down the words they indicate:\r\nfrom which it appears that he has formed an alphabet of motions. As the\r\nlength of the wire makes no difference in the effect, a correspondence\r\nmight be carried on at any distance. Whatever the use may be, the\r\ninvention is beautiful.”\r\n\r\nWe now reach a new epoch in the scientific period--the discovery of the\r\nVoltaic Pile. In 1794, according to _Voigt’s Magazine_, Reizen made\r\nuse of the electric spark for the telegraph; and in 1798 Dr. Salva\r\nof Madrid constructed a similar telegraph, which the Prince of Peace\r\nsubsequently exhibited to the King of Spain with great success.\r\n\r\nIn 1809, Soemmering exhibited a telegraphic apparatus worked by\r\ngalvanism before the Academy of Sciences at Munich, in which the mode\r\nof signalling consisted in the development of gas-bubbles from the\r\ndecomposition of water placed in a series of glass tubes, each of which\r\ndenoted a letter of the alphabet. In 1813, Mr. Sharpe, of Doe Hill near\r\nAlfreton, devised a _voltaic_-electric telegraph, which he exhibited to\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty, who spoke approvingly of it, but declined\r\nto carry it into effect. In the following year, Soemmering exhibited a\r\n_voltaic_-electric telegraph of his own construction, which, however,\r\nwas open to the objection of there being as many wires as signs or\r\nletters of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe next invention is of much greater importance. Upon the suggestion\r\nof Cavallo, already referred to, Francis Ronalds constructed a perfect\r\nelectric telegraph, employing frictional electricity notwithstanding\r\nVolta’s discoveries had been known in England for sixteen years. This\r\ntelegraph was exhibited at Hammersmith in 1816:[53] it consisted of\r\na single insulated wire, the indication being by pith-balls in front\r\nof a dial. When the wire was charged, the balls were divergent, but\r\ncollapsed when the wire was discharged; at the same time were employed\r\ntwo clocks, with lettered discs for the signals. “If, as Paley asserts\r\n(and Coleridge denies), ‘he alone discovers who proves,’ Ronalds is\r\nentitled to the appellation of the first discoverer of an efficient\r\nelectric telegraph.” (_Saturday Review_, No. 147[54]) Nevertheless\r\nthe Government of the day refused to avail itself of this admirable\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Oersted made his great discovery of the deflection, by a\r\ncurrent of electricity, of a magnetic needle at right angles to such\r\ncurrent. Dr. Hamel of St. Petersburg states that Baron Schilling was\r\nthe first to apply Oersted’s discovery to telegraphy; Ampère had\r\npreviously suggested it, but his plan was very complicated, and Dr.\r\nHamel maintains that Schilling first realised the idea by actually\r\nproducing an electro-magnetic telegraph simpler in construction\r\nthan that which Ampère had _imagined_. In 1836, Professor Muncke of\r\nHeidelberg, who had inspected Schilling’s telegraphic apparatus,\r\nexplained the same to William Fothergill Cooke, who in the following\r\nyear returned to England, and subsequently, with Professor Wheatstone,\r\nlaboured simultaneously for the introduction of the electro-magnetic\r\ntelegraph upon the English railways; the first patent for which was\r\ntaken out in the joint names of these two gentlemen.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Professor Wheatstone, with one of his telegraphs, formed a\r\ncommunication between King’s College and the lofty shot-tower on the\r\nopposite bank of the Thames: the wire was laid along the parapets of\r\nthe terrace of Somerset House and Waterloo Bridge, and thence to the\r\ntop of the tower, about 150 feet high, where a telegraph was placed;\r\nthe wire then descended, and a plate of zinc attached to its extremity\r\nwas plunged into the mud of the river, whilst a similar plate attached\r\nto the extremity at the north side was immersed in the water. The\r\ncircuit was thus completed by the entire breadth of the Thames, and the\r\ntelegraph acted as well as if the circuit were entirely metallic.\r\n\r\nShortly after this experiment, Professor Wheatstone and Mr. Cooke laid\r\ndown the first working electric telegraph on the Great Western Railway,\r\nfrom Paddington to Slough.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC GIRDLE FOR THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nOne of our most profound electricians is reported to have exclaimed:\r\n“Give me but an unlimited length of wire, with a small battery, and I\r\nwill girdle the universe with a sentence in forty minutes.” Yet this is\r\nno vain boast; for so rapid is the transition of the electric current\r\nalong the line of the telegraph wire, that, supposing it were possible\r\nto carry the wires eight times round the earth, the transit would\r\noccupy but _one second of time_!\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION OF THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nIt is singular to see how this telegraphic agency is measured by the\r\nchemical consumption of zinc and acid. Mr. Jones (who has written a\r\nwork upon the Electric Telegraphs of America) estimates that to work\r\n12,000 miles of telegraph about 3000 zinc cups are used to hold the\r\nacid: these weigh about 9000 lbs., and they undergo decomposition by\r\nthe galvanic action in about six months, so that 18,000 lbs. of zinc\r\nare consumed in a year. There are also about 3600 porcelain cups to\r\ncontain nitric acid; it requires 450 lbs. of acid to charge them once,\r\nand the charge is renewed every fortnight, making about 12,000 lbs. of\r\nnitric acid in a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME LOST IN ELECTRIC MESSAGES.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may require an hour, or two or three hours, to transmit\r\na telegraphic message to a distant city, yet it is the mechanical\r\nadjustment by the sender and receiver which really absorbs this time;\r\nthe actual transit is practically instantaneous, and so it would be\r\nfrom here to the antipodes, so far as the current itself is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH IN ASTRONOMY AND THE DETERMINATION OF LONGITUDE.\r\n\r\nThe Electric Telegraph has become an instrument in the hands of the\r\nastronomer for determining the difference of longitude between two\r\nobservatories. Thus in 1854 the difference of longitude between London\r\nand Paris was determined within a limit of error which amounted barely\r\nto a quarter of a second. The sudden disturbances of the magnetic\r\nneedle, when freely suspended, which seem to take place simultaneously\r\nover whole continents, if not over the whole globe, from some\r\nunexplained cause, are pointed out as means by which the differences of\r\nlongitude between the magnetic observatories may possibly be determined\r\nwith greater precision than by any yet known method.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1839 Professor Morse suggested some experiments for\r\nthe determination of Longitudes; and in June 1844 the difference of\r\nlongitude between Washington and Baltimore was determined by electric\r\nmeans under his direction. Two persons were stationed at these two\r\ntowns, with clocks carefully adjusted to the respective spots; and\r\na telegraphic signal gave the means of comparing the two clocks\r\nat a given instant. In 1847 the relative longitudes of New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Washington were determined by means of the electric\r\ntelegraph by Messrs. Keith, Walker, and Loomis.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-INTERFERENCE OF GALVANIC WAVES ON THE SAME WIRE.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable facts in the economy of the telegraph is,\r\nthat the line, when connected with a battery in action, propagates\r\nthe hydro-galvanic waves in either direction without interference. As\r\nseveral successive syllables of sound may set out in succession from\r\nthe same place, and be on their way at the same time, to a listener at\r\na distance, so also, where the telegraph-line is long enough, several\r\nwaves may be on their way from the signal station before the first one\r\nreaches the receiving station; two persons at a distance may pronounce\r\nseveral syllables at the same time, and each hear those emitted by the\r\nother. So, on a telegraph-line of two or three thousand miles in length\r\nin the air, and the same in the ground, two operators may at the same\r\ninstant commence a series of several dots and lines, and each receive\r\nthe other’s writings, though the waves have crossed each other on the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF LIGHTNING UPON THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nIn the storm of Sunday April 2, 1848, the lightning had a very\r\nconsiderable effect on the wires of the electric telegraph,\r\nparticularly on the line of railway eastward from Manchester to\r\nNormanton. Not only were the needles greatly deflected, and their power\r\nof answering to the handles considerably weakened, but those at the\r\nNormanton station were found to have had their poles reversed by some\r\naction of the electric fluid in the atmosphere. The damage, however,\r\nwas soon repaired, and the needles again put in good working order.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRO-TELEGRAPHIC MESSAGE TO THE STARS.\r\n\r\nThe electric fluid travels at the mean rate of 20,000 miles in a\r\nsecond under ordinary circumstances; therefore, if it were possible to\r\nestablish a telegraphic communication with the star 61 Cygni, it would\r\nrequire ninety years to send a message there.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henderson and Mr. Maclear have fully confirmed the annual\r\nparallax of α Centauri to amount to a second of arc, which gives about\r\ntwenty billions of miles as its distance from our system; a ray of\r\nlight would arrive from α Centauri to us in little more than three\r\nyears, and a telegraphic despatch would arrive there in thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic communication between England and the United States\r\nis so grand a conception, that it would be impossible to detail its\r\nscientific and mechanical relations within the limits of the present\r\nwork. All that we shall attempt, therefore, will be to glance at a few\r\nof the leading operations.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments made before the Atlantic Telegraph was finally\r\ndecided on, 2000 miles of subterranean and submarine telegraphic wires,\r\nramifying through England and Ireland and under the waters of the\r\nIrish Sea, were specially connected for the purpose; and through this\r\ndistance of 2000 miles 250 distinct signals were recorded and printed\r\nin one minute.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the _Cable_. In the ordinary wires by the side of\r\na railway the electric current travels on with the speed of\r\nlightning--uninterrupted by the speed of lightning; but when a wire\r\nis encased in gutta-percha, or any similar covering, for submersion\r\nin the sea, new forces come into play. The electric excitement of the\r\nwire acts by induction, through the envelope, upon the particles of\r\nwater in contact with that envelope, and calls up an electric force\r\nof an opposite kind. There are two forces, in fact, pulling against\r\neach other through the gutta-percha as a neutral medium,--that is,\r\nthe electricity in the wire, and the opposite electricity in the film\r\nof water immediately surrounding the cable; and to that extent the\r\npower of the current in the enclosed wire is weakened. A submarine\r\ncable, when in the water, is virtually _a lengthened-out Leyden jar_;\r\nit transmits signals while being charged and discharged, instead of\r\nmerely allowing a stream to flow evenly along it: it is a _bottle_\r\nfor holding electricity rather than a _pipe_ for carrying it; and\r\nthis has to be filled for every time of using. The wire being carried\r\nunderground, or through the water, the speed becomes quite measurable,\r\nsay a thousand miles in a second, instead of two hundred thousand,\r\nowing to the retardation by induced or retrograde currents. The energy\r\nof the currents and the quality of the wire also affect the speed.\r\nUntil lately it was supposed that the wire acts only as a _conductor_\r\nof electricity, and that a long wire must produce a weaker effect than\r\na short one, on account of the consequent attenuation of the electrical\r\ninfluence; but it is now known that, the cable being a _reservoir_ as\r\nwell as a conductor, its electrical supply is increased in proportion\r\nto its length.\r\n\r\nThe electro-magnetic current is employed, since it possesses a treble\r\nvelocity of transmission, and realises consequently _a threefold\r\nworking speed_ as compared with simple voltaic electricity. Mr. Wildman\r\nWhitehouse has determined by his ingenious apparatus that the speed\r\nof the voltaic current might be raised under special circumstances\r\nto 1800 miles per second; but that of the induced current, or the\r\nelectro-magnetic, might be augmented to 6000 miles per second.\r\n\r\nNext as to a _Quantity Battery_ employed in these investigations. To\r\neffect a charge, and transmit a current through some thousand miles of\r\nthe Atlantic Cable, Mr. Whitehouse had a piece of apparatus prepared\r\nconsisting of twenty-five pairs of zinc and silver plates about the\r\n20th part of a square inch large, and the pairs so arranged that\r\nthey would hold a drop of acidulated water or brine between them. On\r\ncharging this Lilliputian battery by dipping the plates in salt and\r\nwater, messages were sent from it through a thousand miles of cable\r\nwith the utmost ease; and not only so,--pair after pair was dropped\r\nout from the series, the messages being still sent on with equal\r\nfacility, until at last only a single pair, charged by one single drop\r\nof liquid, was used. Strange to say, with this single pair and single\r\ndrop distinct signals were effected through the thousand miles of the\r\ncable! Each signal was registered at the end of the cable in less than\r\nthree seconds of time.\r\n\r\nThe entire length of wire, iron and copper, spun into the cable amounts\r\nto 332,500 miles, a length sufficient to engirdle the earth thirteen\r\ntimes. The cable weighs from 19 cwt. to a ton per mile, and will bear a\r\nstrain of 5 tons.\r\n\r\nThe _Perpetual Maintenance Battery_, for working the cable at the\r\nbottom of the sea, consists of large plates of platinated silver and\r\namalgamated zinc, mounted in cells of gutta-percha. The zinc plates in\r\neach cell rest upon a longitudinal bar at the bottom, and the silver\r\nplates hang upon a similar bar at the top of the cell; so that there\r\nis virtually but a single stretch of silver and a single stretch of\r\nzinc in operation. Each of the ten cells contains 2000 square inches\r\nof acting surface; and the combination is so powerful, that when the\r\nbroad strips of copper-plate which form the polar extensions are\r\nbrought into contact or separated, brilliant flashes are produced,\r\naccompanied by a loud crackling sound. The points of large pliers\r\nare made red-hot in five seconds when placed between them, and even\r\nscrews burn with vivid scintillation. The cost of maintaining this\r\nmagnificent ten-celled Titan battery at work does not exceed a shilling\r\nper hour. The voltaic current generated in this battery is not,\r\nhowever, the electric stream to be sent across the Atlantic, but is\r\nonly the primary power used to call up and stimulate the energy of a\r\nmore speedy traveller by a complicated apparatus of “Double Induction\r\nCoils.” Nor is the transmission-current generated in the inner wire\r\nof the double induction coil,--and which becomes weakened when it has\r\npassed through 1800 or 1900 miles,--set to work to print or record the\r\nsignals transmitted. This weakened current merely opens and closes the\r\noutlet of a fresh battery, which is to do the printing labour. This\r\nrelay-instrument (as it is called), which consists of a temporary and\r\npermanent magnet, is so sensitive an apparatus, that it may be put in\r\naction by a fragment of zinc and a sixpence pressed against the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to lay the cable in August 1857 failed through stretching\r\nit so tightly that it snapped and went to the bottom, at a depth of\r\n12,000 feet, forty times the height of St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nThis great work was resumed in August 1858; and on the 5th the first\r\nsignals were received through _two thousand and fifty miles_ of the\r\nAtlantic Cable. And it is worthy of remark, that just 111 years\r\npreviously, on the 5th of August 1747, Dr. Watson astonished the\r\nscientific world by practically proving that the electric current could\r\nbe transmitted through a _wire hardly two miles and a half long_.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellanea.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MARINE CHRONOMETERS ARE RATED AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY, GREENWICH.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the Longitude at Sea requires simply accurate\r\ninstruments for the measurement of the positions of the heavenly\r\nbodies, and one or other of the two following,--either perfectly\r\ncorrect watches--or chronometers, as they are now called--or perfectly\r\naccurate tables of the lunar motions.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1696 a report was spread among the members of the Royal\r\nSociety that Sir Isaac Newton was occupied with the problem of finding\r\nthe longitude at sea; but the rumour having no foundation, he requested\r\nHalley to acquaint the members “that he was not about it.”[56] (_Sir\r\nDavid Brewster’s Life of Newton._)\r\n\r\nIn 1714 the legislature of Queen Anne passed an Act offering a reward\r\nof 20,000_l._ for the discovery of the longitude, the problem being\r\nthen very inaccurately solved for want of good watches or lunar tables.\r\nAbout the year 1749, the attention of the Royal Society was directed\r\nto the improvements effected in the construction of watches by John\r\nHarrison, who received for his inventions the Copley Medal. Thus\r\nencouraged, Harrison continued his labours with unwearied diligence,\r\nand produced in 1758 a timekeeper which was sent for trial on a voyage\r\nto Jamaica. After 161 days the error of the instrument was only 1m\r\n5s, and the maker received from the nation 5000_l._ The Commissioners\r\nof the Board of Longitude subsequently required Harrison to construct\r\nunder their inspection chronometers of a similar nature, which were\r\nsubjected to trial in a voyage to Barbadoes, and performed with such\r\naccuracy, that, after having fully explained the principle of their\r\nconstruction to the commissioners, they awarded him 10,000_l._ more;\r\nat the same time Euler of Berlin and the heirs of Mayer of Göttingen\r\nreceived each 3000_l._ for their lunar tables.\r\n\r\n  The account of the trial of Harrison’s watch is very interesting.\r\n  In April 1766, by desire of the Commissioners of the Board, the\r\n  Lords of the Admiralty delivered the watch into the custody of\r\n  the Astronomer-Royal, the Rev. Dr. Nevil Maskelyne. It was then\r\n  placed at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, in a box having two\r\n  different locks, fixed to the floor or wainscot, with a plate of\r\n  glass in the lid of the box, so that it might be compared as often\r\n  as convenient with the regulator and the variation set down. The\r\n  form observed by Mr. Harrison in winding up the watch was exactly\r\n  followed; and an officer of Greenwich Hospital attended every day,\r\n  at a stated hour, to see the watch wound up, and its comparison\r\n  with the regulator entered. A key to one of the locks was kept at\r\n  the Hospital for the use of the officer, and the other remained\r\n  at the Observatory for the use of the Astronomer-Royal or his\r\n  assistant.\r\n\r\n  The watch was then tried in various positions till the beginning\r\n  of July; and from thence to the end of February following in a\r\n  horizontal position with its face upwards.\r\n\r\n  The variation of the watch was then noted down, and a register was\r\n  kept of the barometer and thermometer; and the time of comparing\r\n  the same with the regulator was regularly kept, and attested by\r\n  the Astronomer-Royal or his assistant and such of the officers as\r\n  witnessed the winding-up and comparison of the watch.\r\n\r\n  Under these conditions Harrison’s watch was received by the\r\n  Astronomer-Royal at the Admiralty on May 5, 1766, in the presence\r\n  of Philip Stephens, Esq., Secretary of the Admiralty; Captain\r\n  Baillie, of the Royal Hospital, Greenwich; and Mr. Kendal the\r\n  watchmaker, who accompanied the Astronomer-Royal to Greenwich, and\r\n  saw the watch started and locked up in the box provided for it. The\r\n  watch was then compared with the transit clock daily, and wound up\r\n  in the presence of the officer of Greenwich Hospital. From May 5 to\r\n  May 17 the watch was kept in a horizontal position with its face\r\n  upwards; from May 18 to July 6 it was tried--first inclined at an\r\n  angle of 20° to the horizon, with the face upwards, and the hours\r\n  12, 6, 3, and 9, highest successively; then in a vertical position,\r\n  with the same hours highest in order; lastly, in a horizontal\r\n  position with the face downwards. From July 16, 1766, to March 4,\r\n  1767, it was always kept in a horizontal position with its face\r\n  upwards, lying upon the same cushion, and in the same box in which\r\n  Mr. Harrison had kept it in the voyage to Barbadoes.\r\n\r\n  From the observed transits of the sun over the meridian, according\r\n  to the time of the regulator of the Observatory, together with\r\n  the attested comparisons of Mr. Harrison’s watch with the transit\r\n  clock, the watch was found too fast on several days as follows:\r\n\r\n                                h.  m.   s.\r\n    1766.

They are rated daily by two observers, the process being as\r\nfollows. At a certain time every day two assistants in charge repair\r\nto the chronometer-room, where is a time-piece set to true time; one\r\nwinds up each with its own key, and the second follows after some\r\nlittle time and verifies the fact that each is wound. One assistant\r\nthen looks at each watch in succession, counting the beats of the clock\r\nwhilst he compares the chronometer by the eye; and in the course of a\r\nfew seconds he calls out the second shown by the chronometer when the\r\nclock is at a whole minute. This number is entered in a book by the\r\nother assistant, and so on till all the chronometers are compared.\r\nThen the assistants change places, the second comparing and the first\r\nwriting down. From these daily comparisons the daily rates are deduced,\r\nby which the goodness of the watch is determined. The errors are of\r\ntwo classes--that of general bad workmanship, and that of over or\r\nunder correction for temperature. In the room is an apparatus in which\r\nthe watch may be continually kept at temperatures exceeding 100° by\r\nartificial heat; and outside the window of the room is an iron cage,\r\nin which they are subjected to low temperatures. The very great care\r\ntaken with all chronometers sent to the Royal Observatory, as well as\r\nthe perfect impartiality of the examination which each receives, afford\r\nencouragement to their manufacture, and are of the utmost importance to\r\nthe safety and perfection of navigation.\r\n\r\nWe have before us now the Report of the Astronomer-Royal on the Rates\r\nof Chronometers in the year 1854, in which the following are the\r\nsuccessive weekly sums of the daily rates of the first there mentioned:\r\n\r\n    Week ending              secs.\r\n\r\n    Jan. 21, loss in the week 2·2\r\n     ”   28         ”         4·0\r\n    Feb.  4         ”         1·1\r\n     ”   11         ”         5·0\r\n     ”   18         ”         4·9\r\n     ”   25         ”         5·5\r\n    Mar.  4         ”         6·0\r\n     ”   11         ”         6·0\r\n     ”   18         ”         1·5\r\n     ”   25         ”         4·5\r\n    Apr.  1         ”         4·0\r\n     ”    8         ”         1·5\r\n     ”   15, gain in the week 0·4\r\n    Apr. 22,        ”         2·6\r\n     ”   29, loss in the week 1·4\r\n    May   6         ”         2·1\r\n     ”   13         ”         3·0\r\n     ”   20         ”         5·1\r\n     ”   27         ”         3·3\r\n    June  3         ”         2·8\r\n     ”   10         ”         1·8\r\n     ”   17         ”         2·0\r\n     ”   24         ”         3·0\r\n    July  1         ”         2·5\r\n     ”    8         ”         1·2\r\n\r\nTill February 4 the watch was exposed to the external air outside a\r\nnorth window; from February 5 to March 4 it was placed in the chamber\r\nof a stove heated by gas to a moderate temperature; and from April\r\n29 to May 20 it was placed in the chamber when heated to a high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe advance in making chronometers since Harrison’s celebrated watch\r\nwas tried at the Royal Observatory, more than ninety years since, may\r\nbe judged by comparing its rates with those above.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOMETRY OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nThere is a mechanical uniformity observable in the description of\r\nshells of the same species which at once suggests the probability that\r\nthe generating figure of each increases, and that the spiral chamber of\r\neach expands itself, according to some simple geometrical law common\r\nto all. To the determination of this law the operculum lends itself,\r\nin certain classes of shells, with remarkable facility. Continually\r\nenlarged by the animal, as the construction of its shell advances so as\r\nto fill up its mouth, the operculum measures the progressive widening\r\nof the spiral chamber by the progressive stages of its growth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe animal, as he advances in the construction of his shell, increases\r\ncontinually his operculum, so as to adjust it to his mouth. He\r\nincreases it, however, not by additions made at the same time all round\r\nits margin, but by additions made only on one side of it at once. One\r\nedge of the operculum thus remains unaltered as it is advanced into\r\neach new position, and placed in a newly-formed section of the chamber\r\nsimilar to the last but greater than it.\r\n\r\nThat the same edge which fitted a portion of the first less section\r\nshould be capable of adjustment so as to fit a portion of the next\r\nsimilar but greater section, supposes a geometrical provision in the\r\ncurved form of the chamber of great complication and difficulty. But\r\nGod hath bestowed upon this humble architect the practical skill of\r\nthe learned geometrician; and he makes this provision with admirable\r\nprecision in that curvature of the logarithmic spiral which he gives to\r\nthe section of the shell. This curvature obtaining, he has only to turn\r\nhis operculum slightly round in its own place, as he advances it into\r\neach newly-formed portion of his chamber, to adapt one margin of it to\r\na new and larger surface and a different curvature, leaving the space\r\nto be filled up by increasing the operculum wholly on the outer margin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhy the Mollusks, who inhabit turbinated and discoid shells, should, in\r\nthe progressive increase of their spiral dwellings, affect the peculiar\r\nlaw of the logarithmic spiral, is easily to be understood. Providence\r\nhas subjected the instinct which shapes out each to a rigid uniformity\r\nof operation.--_Professor Mosely_: _Philos. Trans._ 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC THEORY OF SHELLS.\r\n\r\nHow beautifully is the wisdom of God developed in shaping out and\r\nmoulding shells! and especially in the particular value of the constant\r\nangle which the spiral of each species of shell affects,--a value\r\nconnected by a necessary relation with the economy of the material\r\nof each, and with its stability and the conditions of its buoyancy.\r\nThus the shell of the _Nautilus Pompilius_ has, hydrostatically, an\r\nA-statical surface. If placed with any portion of its surface upon the\r\nwater, it will immediately turn over towards its smaller end, and rest\r\nonly on its mouth. Those conversant with the theory of floating bodies\r\nwill recognise in this an interesting property.--_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVICES OF SEA-SHELLS AND ANIMALCULES.\r\n\r\nDr. Maury is disposed to regard these beings as having much to do in\r\nmaintaining the harmonies of creation, and the principles of the most\r\nadmirable compensation in the system of oceanic circulation. “We may\r\neven regard them as regulators, to some extent, of climates in parts\r\nof the earth far removed from their presence. There is something\r\nsuggestive both of the grand and the beautiful in the idea that while\r\nthe insects of the sea are building up their coral islands in the\r\nperpetual summer of the tropics, they are also engaged in dispensing\r\nwarmth to distant parts of the earth, and in mitigating the severe cold\r\nof the polar winter.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPTH OF THE PRIMEVAL SEAS.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forbes, in a communication to the Royal Society, states that\r\nnot only the colour of the shells of existing mollusks ceases to be\r\nstrongly marked at considerable depths, but also that well-defined\r\npatterns are, with very few and slight exceptions, presented only by\r\ntestacea inhabiting the littoral, circumlittoral, and median zones.\r\nIn the Mediterranean, only one in eighteen of the shells taken from\r\nbelow 100 fathoms exhibit any markings of colour, and even the few\r\nthat do so are questionable inhabitants of those depths. Between 30\r\nand 35 fathoms, the proportion of marked to plain shells is rather\r\nless than one in three; and between the margin and two fathoms the\r\nstriped or mottled species exceed one-half of the total number. In our\r\nown seas, Professor Forbes observes that testacea taken from below 100\r\nfathoms, even when they are individuals of species vividly striped or\r\nbanded in shallower zones, are quite white or colourless. At between\r\n60 and 80 fathoms, striping and banding are rarely presented by our\r\nshells, especially in the northern provinces; from 50 fathoms, shallow\r\nbands, colours, and patterns, are well marked. _The relation of these\r\narrangements of colour to the degree of light penetrating the different\r\nzones of depth_ is a subject well worthy of minute inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL WATER-PURIFIERS.\r\n\r\nMr. Warrington kept for a whole year twelve gallons of water in a state\r\nof admirably balanced purity by the following beautiful action:\r\n\r\n  In the tank, or aquarium, were two gold fish, six water-snails, and\r\n  two or three specimens of that elegant aquatic plant _Valisperia\r\n  sporalis_, which, before the introduction of the water-snails, by\r\n  its decayed leaves caused a growth of slimy mucus, and made the\r\n  water turbid and likely to destroy both plants and fish. But under\r\n  the improved arrangement the slime, as fast as it was engendered,\r\n  was consumed by the water-snails, which reproduced it in the shape\r\n  of young snails, which furnished a succulent food to the fish.\r\n  Meanwhile the _Valisperia_ plants absorbed the carbonic acid\r\n  exhaled by the respiration of their companions, fixing the carbon\r\n  in their growing stems and luxuriant blossoms, and refreshing\r\n  the oxygen (during sunshine in visible little streams) for the\r\n  respiration of the snails and the fish. The spectacle of perfect\r\n  equilibrium thus simply maintained between animal, vegetable, and\r\n  inorganic activity, was strikingly beautiful; and such means might\r\n  possibly hereafter be made available on a large scale for keeping\r\n  tanked water sweet and clean.--_Quarterly Review_, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO IMITATE SEA-WATER.\r\n\r\nThe demand for Sea-water to supply the Marine Aquarium--now to be\r\nseen in so many houses--induced Mr. Gosse to attempt the manufacture\r\nof Sea-water, more especially as the constituents are well known. He\r\naccordingly took Scheveitzer’s analysis of Sea-water for his guide. In\r\none thousand grains of sea-water taken off Brighton, it gave: water,\r\n964·744; chloride of sodium, 27·059; chloride of magnesium, 3·666;\r\nchloride of potassium, 9·755; bromide of magnesium, 0·29; sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, 2·295; sulphate of lime, 1·407; carbonate of lime, 0·033:\r\ntotal, 999·998. Omitting the bromide of magnesium, the carbonate of\r\nlime, and the sulphate of lime, as being very small quantities, the\r\ncomponent parts were reduced to common salt, 3½ oz.; Epsom salts, ¼\r\noz.; chloride of magnesium, 200 grains troy; chloride of potassium,\r\n40 grains troy; and four quarts of water. Next day the mixture was\r\nfiltered through a sponge into a glass jar, the bottom covered with\r\nshore-pebbles and fragments of stone and fronds of green sea-weed. A\r\ncoating of green spores was soon deposited on the sides of the glass,\r\nand bubbles of oxygen were copiously thrown off every day under the\r\nexcitement of the sun’s light. In a week Mr. Gosse put in species of\r\n_Actinia Bowerbankia_, _Cellularia_, _Serpula_, &c. with some red\r\nsea-weeds; and the whole throve well.\r\n\r\n\r\nVELOCITY OF IMPRESSIONS TRANSMITTED TO THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nProfessor Helmholtz of Königsberg has, by the electro-magnetic\r\nmethod,[58] ascertained that the intelligence of an impression\r\nmade upon the ends of the nerves in communication with the skin\r\nis transmitted to the brain with a velocity of about 195 feet per\r\nsecond. Arrived at the brain, about one-tenth of a second passes\r\nbefore the will is able to give the command to the nerves that certain\r\nmuscles shall execute a certain motion, varying in persons and times.\r\nFinally, about 1/100th of a second passes after the receipt of the\r\ncommand before the muscle is in activity. In all, therefore, from the\r\nexcitation of the sensitive nerves till the moving of the muscle, 1¼\r\nto 2/10ths of a second are consumed. Intelligence from the great toe\r\narrives about 1/30th of a second later than from the ear or the face.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the differences of time in the nervous impressions,\r\nwhich we are accustomed to regard as simultaneous, lie near our\r\nperception. We are taught by astronomy that, on account of the\r\ntime taken to propagate light, we now see what has occurred in the\r\nfixed stars years ago; and that, owing to the time required for the\r\ntransmission of sound, we hear after we see is a matter of daily\r\nexperience. Happily the distances to be traversed by our sensuous\r\nperceptions before they reach the brain are so short that we do\r\nnot observe their influence, and are therefore unprejudiced in our\r\npractical interest. With an ordinary whale the case is perhaps more\r\ndubious; for in all probability the animal does not feel a wound near\r\nits tail until a second after it has been inflicted, and requires\r\nanother second to send the command to the tail to defend itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHS ON THE RETINA.\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Dr. Scoresby explained with much minuteness and skill\r\nthe varying phenomena which presented themselves to him after gazing\r\nintently for some time on strongly-illuminated objects,--as the sun,\r\nthe moon, a red or orange or yellow wafer on a strongly-contrasted\r\nground, or a dark object seen in a bright field. The doctor explained,\r\nupon removing the eyes from the object, the early appearance of the\r\npicture or image which had been thus “photographed on the Retina,” with\r\nthe photochromatic changes which the picture underwent while it still\r\nretained its general form and most strongly-marked features; also, how\r\nthese pictures, when they had almost faded away, could at pleasure, and\r\nfor a considerable time, be renewed by rapidly opening and shutting the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT EXPLORATION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nDr. S. Wood of Cincinnati states, that by means of a small double\r\nconvex lens of short focus held near the eye,--that organ looking\r\nthrough it at a candle twelve or fifteen feet distant,--there will be\r\nperceived a large luminous disc, covered with dark and light spots and\r\ndark streaks, which, after a momentary confusion, will settle down\r\ninto an unchanging picture, which picture is composed of the organs\r\nor internal parts of the eye. The eye is thus enabled to view its own\r\ninternal organisation, to have a beautiful exhibition of the vessels of\r\nthe cornea, of the distribution of the lachrymas secretions in the act\r\nof winking, and to see into the nature and cause of _muscæ volitantes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE CANDLE-FLAME.\r\n\r\nM. Volger has subjected this Flame to a new analysis.\r\n\r\n  He finds that the so-called _flame-bud_, a globular blue flaminule,\r\n  is first produced at the summit of the wick: this is the result\r\n  of the combustion of carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and carbon, and is\r\n  surrounded by a reddish-violet halo, the _veil_. The increased\r\n  heat now gives rise to the actual flame, which shoots forth from\r\n  the expanding bud, and is then surrounded at its inferior portion\r\n  only by the latter. The interior consists of a dark gaseous cone,\r\n  containing the immediate products of the decomposition of the fatty\r\n  acids, and surrounded by another dark hollow cone, the _inner\r\n  cap_. Here we already meet with carbon and hydrogen, which have\r\n  resulted from the process of decomposition; and we distinguish\r\n  this cone from the inner one by its yielding soot. The _external\r\n  cap_ constitutes the most luminous portion of the flame, in which\r\n  the hydrogen is consumed and the carbon rendered incandescent. The\r\n  surrounding portion is but slightly luminous, deposits no soot,\r\n  and in it the carbon and hydrogen are consumed.--_Liebig’s Annual\r\n  Report._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SOON A CORPSE DECAYS.\r\n\r\nMr. Lewis, of the General Board of Health, from his examination of the\r\ncontents of nearly 100 coffins in the vaults and catacombs of London\r\nchurches, concludes that the complete decomposition of a corpse, and\r\nits resolution into its ultimate elements, takes place in a leaden\r\ncoffin with extreme slowness. In a wooden coffin the remains, with the\r\nexception of the bones, vanish in from two to five years. This period\r\ndepends upon the quality of the wood, and the free access of air to\r\nthe coffins. But in leaden coffins, 50, 60, 80, and even 100 years\r\nare required to accomplish this. “I have opened,” says Mr. Lewis, “a\r\ncoffin in which the corpse had been placed for nearly a century; and\r\nthe ammoniacal gas formed dense white fumes when brought in contact\r\nwith hydrochloric-acid gas, and was so powerful that the head could\r\nnot remain in it for more than a few seconds at a time.” To render the\r\nhuman body perfectly inert after death, it should be placed in a light\r\nwooden coffin, in a pervious soil, from five to eight feet deep.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSKET-BALLS FOUND IN IVORY.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon sportsman, in shooting elephants, aims at a spot just above\r\nthe proboscis. If he fires a little too low, the ball passes into the\r\ntusk-socket, causing great pain to the animal, but not endangering\r\nits life; and it is immediately surrounded by osteo-dentine. It has\r\noften been a matter of wonder how such bodies should become completely\r\nimbedded in the substance of the tusk, sometimes without any visible\r\naperture; or how leaden bullets become lodged in the solid centre of a\r\nvery large tusk without having been flattened, as they are found by\r\nthe ivory-turner.\r\n\r\n  The explanation is as follows: A musket-ball aimed at the head of\r\n  an elephant may penetrate the thin bony socket and the thinner\r\n  ivory parietes of the wide conical pulp-cavity occupying the\r\n  inserted base of the tusk; if the projectile force be there spent,\r\n  the ball will gravitate to the opposite and lower side of the\r\n  pulp-cavity. The pulp becomes inflamed, irregular calcification\r\n  ensues, and osteo-dentine is formed around the ball. The pulp\r\n  then resumes its healthy state and functions, and coats the\r\n  osteo-dentine enclosing the ball, together with the root of the\r\n  conical cavity into which the mass projects, with layers of normal\r\n  ivory. The hole formed by the ball is soon replaced, and filled\r\n  up by osteo-dentine, and coated with cement. Meanwhile, by the\r\n  continued progress of growth, the enclosed ball is pushed forward\r\n  to the middle of the solid tusk; or if the elephant be young, the\r\n  ball may be carried forward by growth and wear of the tusk until\r\n  its base has become the apex, and become finally exposed and\r\n  discharged by the continual abrasion to which the apex of the tusk\r\n  is subjected.--_Professor Owen._\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nTo the article at pp. 59-60 should be added the result obtained by Dr.\r\nWoods of Parsonstown, and communicated to the _Philosophical Magazine_\r\nfor July 1854. Dr. Woods, from photographic experiment, has no doubt\r\nthat the light from the centre of flame acts more energetically than\r\nthat from the edge on a surface capable of receiving its impression;\r\nand that light from a luminous solid body acts equally powerfully from\r\nits centre or its edges: wherefore Dr. Woods concludes that, as the\r\nsun affects a sensitive plate similarly with flame, it is probable its\r\nlight-producing portion is of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n  _Note to_ “IS THE HEAT OF THE SUN DECREASING?” _at page 65_.--Dr.\r\n  Vaughan of Cincinnati has stated to the British Association:\r\n  “From a comparison of the relative intensity of solar, lunar,\r\n  and artificial light, as determined by Euler and Wollaston, it\r\n  appears that the rays of the sun have an illuminating power\r\n  equal to that of 14,000 candles at a distance of one foot, or\r\n  of 3500,000000,000000,000000,000000 candles at a distance of\r\n  95,000,000 miles. It follows that the amount of light which\r\n  flows from the solar orb could be scarcely produced by the daily\r\n  combustion of 200 globes of tallow, each equal to the earth in\r\n  magnitude. A sphere of combustible matter much larger than the\r\n  sun itself should be consumed every ten years in maintaining its\r\n  wonderful brilliancy; and its atmosphere, if pure oxygen, would be\r\n  expended before a few days in supporting so great a conflagration.\r\n  An illumination on so vast a scale could be kept up only by the\r\n  inexhaustible magazine of ether disseminated through space, and\r\n  ever ready to manifest its luciferous properties on large spheres,\r\n  whose attraction renders it sufficiently dense for the play of\r\n  chemical affinity. Accordingly suns derive the power of shedding\r\n  perpetual light, not from their chemical constitution, but from\r\n  their immense mass and their superior attractive power.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANETOIDS.\r\n\r\n  +----------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |                |               |           |           |    No.    |\r\n  |                |               |           |           |discovered |\r\n  |                |    Date of    |           | Place of  |  by each  |\r\n  |      Name.     |  Discovery.   |Discoverer.| Discovery.|astronomer.|\r\n  +----------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |Mercury, Mars, }|     Known  }  |           |           |           |\r\n  |Venus, Jupiter,}|    to the  }  |   ...     |    ...    |    --     |\r\n  |Earth, Saturn, }|   ancients.}  |           |           |           |\r\n  |   Uranus       |1781, March 13 |W.

the public generally, was drawn to the fact of\r\nthe above Comet passing (on Oct. 18) within nine millions of miles of\r\nthe planet Venus, or less than 9/100ths of the earth’s distance from\r\nthe Sun. “And (says Mr. Hind, the astronomer), it is obvious that\r\nif the comet had reached its least distance from the sun a few days\r\nearlier than it has done, the planet might have passed through it;\r\nand I am very far from thinking that close proximity to a comet of\r\nthis description would be unattended with danger. The inhabitants of\r\nVenus will witness a cometary spectacle far superior to that which has\r\nrecently attracted so much attention here, inasmuch as the tail will\r\ndoubtless appear twice as long from that planet as from the earth, and\r\nthe nucleus proportionally more brilliant.”\r\n\r\nThis Comet was first discovered by Dr. G. B. Donati, astronomer at\r\nthe Museum of Florence, on the evening of the 2d of June, in right\r\nascension 141° 18′, and north declination 23° 47′, corresponding to\r\na position near the star Leonis. Previous to this date we had no\r\nknowledge of its existence, and therefore it was not a predicted\r\ncomet; neither is it the one last observed in 1556. At the date of\r\ndiscovery it was distant from the earth 228,000,000 of miles, and was\r\nan excessively faint object in the largest telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe tail, from October 2 to 16, when the comet was most conspicuous,\r\nappears to have maintained an average length of at least 40,000,000\r\nmiles, subtending an angle varying from 30° to 40°. The dark line or\r\nspace down the centre, frequently remarked in other great comets,\r\nwas a striking characteristic in that of Donati. The nucleus, though\r\nsmall, was intensely brilliant in powerful instruments, and for some\r\ntime bore high magnifiers to much greater advantage than is usual with\r\nthese objects. In several respects this comet resembled the famous\r\nones of 1744, 1680, and 1811, particularly as regards the signs of\r\nviolent agitation going on in the vicinity of the nucleus, such as\r\nthe appearance of luminous jets, spiral offshoots, &c., which rapidly\r\nemanated from the planetary point and as quickly lost themselves in the\r\ngeneral nebulosity of the head.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th Oct. the most casual observer had an opportunity of\r\nsatisfying himself as to the accuracy of the mathematical theory of\r\nthe motions of comets in the near approach of the nucleus of Donati’s\r\nto Arcturus, the principal star in the constellation Bootes. The\r\ncircumstance of the appulse was very nearly as predicted by Mr. Hind.\r\n\r\nThe comet, according to the investigations by M. Loewy, of the\r\nObservatory of Vienna, arrived at its least distance from the sun a few\r\nminutes after eleven o’clock on the morning of the 30th of September;\r\nits longitude, as seen from the sun at this time, being 36° 13′, and\r\nits distance from him 55,000,000 miles. The longer diameter of its\r\norbit is 184 times that of the earth’s, or 35,100,000,000 miles;\r\nyet this is considerably less than 1/1000th of the distance of the\r\nnearest fixed star. As an illustration, let any one take a half-sheet\r\nof note-paper, and marking a circle with a sixpence in one corner\r\nof it, describe therein our solar system, drawing the orbits of the\r\nearth and the inferior planets as small as he can by the aid of a\r\nmagnifying-glass. If the circumference of the sixpence stands for the\r\norbit of Neptune, then an oval filling the page will fairly represent\r\nthe orbit of Donati’s comet; and if the paper be laid upon the pavement\r\nunder the west door of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, the length of that\r\nedifice will inadequately represent the distance of the nearest fixed\r\nstar. The time of revolution resulting from Mr. Loewy’s calculations\r\nis 2495 years, which is about 500 years less than that of the comet of\r\n1811 during the period it was visible from the earth.\r\n\r\nThat the comet should take more than 2000 years to travel round the\r\nabove page of note-paper is explained by its great diminution of speed\r\nas it recedes from the sun. At its perihelion it travelled at the rate\r\nof 127,000 miles an hour, or more than twice as fast as the earth,\r\nwhose motion is about 1000 miles a minute. At its aphelion, however,\r\nor its greatest distance from the sun, the comet is a very slow body,\r\nsailing at the rate of 480 miles an hour, or only eight times the\r\nspeed of a railway express. At this pace, were it to travel onward in\r\na straight line, the lapse of a million of years would find it still\r\ntravelling half way between our sun and the nearest fixed star.\r\n\r\nAs this comet last visited us between 2000 and 2495 years since, we\r\nknow that its appearance was at an interesting period of the world’s\r\nhistory. It might have terrified the Athenians into accepting the\r\nbloody code of Draco. It might have announced the destruction of\r\nNineveh, or of Babylon, or the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.\r\nIt might have been seen by the expedition which sailed round Africa\r\nin the reign of Pharaoh Necho. It might have given interest to the\r\nfoundation of the Pythian games. Within the probable range of its\r\nlast visitation are comprehended the whole of the great events of the\r\nhistory of Greece; and among the spectators of the comet may have been\r\nthe so-called sages of Greece and even the prophets of Holy Writ:\r\nThales might have attempted to calculate its return, and Jeremiah might\r\nhave tried to read its warning.--_Abridged from a Communication from\r\nMr. Hind to the Times, and from a Leader in that Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] From a photograph, with figures, to show the relative size of the\r\ntube aperture.\r\n\r\n[2] Weld’s _History of the Royal Society_, vol. ii. p. 188.\r\n\r\n[3] Dr. Whewell (_Bridgewater Treatise_, p. 266) well observes, that\r\nBoyle and Pascal are to hydrostatics what Galileo is to mechanics, and\r\nCopernicus, Kepler, and Newton are to astronomy.\r\n\r\n[4] The Rev. Mr. Turnor recollects that Mr. Jones, the tutor,\r\nmentioned, in one of his lectures on optics, that the reflecting\r\ntelescope belonging to Newton was then lodged in the observatory over\r\nthe gateway; and Mr. Turnor thinks that he once saw it, with a finder\r\naffixed to it.\r\n\r\n[5] The story of the dog “Diamond” having caused the burning of\r\ncertain papers is laid in London, and in Newton’s later years. In the\r\nnotes to Maude’s _Wenleysdale_, a person then living (1780) relates,\r\nthat Sir Isaac being called out of his study to a contiguous room, a\r\nlittle dog, called Diamond, the constant but incurious attendant of\r\nhis master’s researches, happened to be left among the papers, and\r\nby a fatality not to be retrieved, as it was in the latter part of\r\nSir Isaac’s days, threw down a lighted candle, which consumed the\r\nalmost finished labour of some years. Sir Isaac returning too late\r\nbut to behold the dreadful wreck, rebuked the author of it with an\r\nexclamation (_ad sidera palmas_), “O Diamond! Diamond! thou little\r\nknowest the mischief done!” without adding a single stripe. M. Biot\r\ngives this fiction as a true story, which happened some years after\r\nthe publication of the _Principia_; and he characterises the accident\r\nas having deprived the sciences forever of the fruit of so much of\r\nNewton’s labours.--Brewster’s _Life_, vol. ii. p. 139, note. Dr. Newton\r\nremarks, that Sir Isaac never had any communion with dogs or cats; and\r\nSir David Brewster adds, that the view which M. Biot has taken of the\r\nidle story of the dog Diamond, charged with fire-raising among Newton’s\r\nmanuscripts, and of the influence of this accident upon the mind of\r\ntheir author, is utterly incomprehensible. The fiction, however, was\r\nturned to account in giving colour to M. Biot’s misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n[6] Bohn’s edition.\r\n\r\n[7] When at Pisa, many years since, Captain Basil Hall investigated\r\nthe origin and divergence of the tower from the perpendicular, and\r\nestablished completely to his own satisfaction that it had been built\r\nfrom top to bottom originally just as it now stands. His reasons for\r\nthinking so were, that the line of the tower, on that side towards\r\nwhich it leans, has not the same curvature as the line on the opposite,\r\nor what may be called the upper side. If the tower had been built\r\nupright, and then been made to incline over, the line of the wall on\r\nthat side towards which the inclination was given would be more or less\r\nconcave in that direction, owing to the nodding or “swagging over” of\r\nthe top, by the simple action of gravity acting on a very tall mass\r\nof masonry, which is more or less elastic when placed in a sloping\r\nposition. But the contrary is the fact; for the line of wall on the\r\nside towards which the tower leans is decidedly more convex than the\r\nopposite side. Captain Hall had therefore no doubt whatever that the\r\narchitect, in rearing his successive courses of stones, gained or\r\nstole a little at each layer, so as to render his work less and less\r\noverhanging as he went up; and thus, without betraying what he was\r\nabout, really gained stability.--See _Patchwork_.\r\n\r\n[8] Lord Bacon proposed that, in order to determine whether the gravity\r\nof the earth arises from the gravity of its parts, a clock-pendulum\r\nshould be swung in a mine, as was recently done at Harton colliery by\r\nthe Astronomer-Royal.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1812, Ampère noted the phenomena of the pendulum, and showed\r\nthat its movement was produced only when the eye of the observer was\r\nfixed on the instrument, and endeavoured to prove thereby that the\r\nmotion was due to a play of the muscles, some members of the French\r\nAcademy objected to the consideration of a subject connected to such an\r\nextent with superstition.\r\n\r\n[9] This curious fact was first recorded by Pepys, in his _Diary_,\r\nunder the date 31st of July 1665.\r\n\r\n[10] The result of these experiments for ascertaining the variation\r\nof the gravity at great depths, has proved beyond doubt that the\r\nattraction of gravitation is increased at the depth of 1250 feet by\r\n1/19000 part.\r\n\r\n[11] See the account of Mr. Baily’s researches (with two illustrations)\r\nin _Things not generally Known_, p. vii., and “Weight of the Earth,” p.\r\n16.\r\n\r\n[12] Fizeau gives his result in leagues, reckoning twenty-five to the\r\nequatorial degree. He estimates the velocity of light at 70,000 such\r\nleagues, or about 210,000 miles in the second.\r\n\r\n[13] See _Things not generally Known_, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[14] Some time before the first announcement of the discovery of\r\nsun-painting, the following extract from Sir John Herschel’s _Treatise\r\non Light_, in the _Encyclopædia Metropolitana_, appeared in a popular\r\nwork entitled _Parlour Magic_: “Strain a piece of paper or linen upon\r\na wooden frame, and sponge it over with a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver in water; place it behind a painting upon glass, or a stained\r\nwindow-pane, and the light, traversing the painting or figures, will\r\nproduce a copy of it upon the prepared paper or linen; those parts in\r\nwhich the rays were least intercepted being the shadows of the picture.”\r\n\r\n[15] In his book on Colours, Mr. Doyle informs us that divers, if not\r\nall, essential oils, as also spirits of wine, when shaken, “have a\r\ngood store of bubbles, which appear adorned with various and lively\r\ncolours.” He mentions also that bubbles of soap and turpentine exhibit\r\nthe same colours, which “vary according to the incidence of the sight\r\nand the position of the eye;” and he had seen a glass-blower blow\r\nbubbles of glass which burst, and displayed “the varying colours of the\r\nrainbow, which were exceedingly vivid.”\r\n\r\n[16] The original idea is even attributed to Copernicus. M. Blundevile,\r\nin his _Treatise on Cosmography_, 1594, has the following passage,\r\nperhaps the most distinct recognition of authority in our language:\r\n“How prooue (prove) you that there is but one world? By the authoritie\r\nof Aristotle, who saieth that if there were any other world out of\r\nthis, then the earth of that world would mooue (move) towards the\r\ncentre of this world,” &c.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton, in a conversation with Conduitt, said he took “all\r\nthe planets to be composed of the same matter with the earth, viz.\r\nearth, water, and stone, but variously concocted.”\r\n\r\n[17] Sir William Herschel ascertained that our solar system is\r\nadvancing towards the constellation Hercules, or more accurately to a\r\npoint in space whose right ascension is 245° 52′ 30″, and north polar\r\ndistance 40° 22′; and that the quantity of this motion is such, that to\r\nan astronomer placed in Sirius, our sun would appear to describe an arc\r\nof little more than _a second_ every year.--_North-British Review_, No.\r\n3.\r\n\r\n[18] See M. Arago’s researches upon this interesting subject, in\r\n_Things not generally Known_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[19] This eloquent advocacy of the doctrine of “More Worlds than One”\r\n(referred to at p. 51) is from the author’s valuable _Outlines of\r\nAstronomy_.\r\n\r\n[20] Professor Challis, of the Cambridge Observatory, directing the\r\nNorthumberland telescope of that institution to the place assigned by\r\nMr. Adams’s calculations and its vicinity on the 4th and 12th of August\r\n1846, saw the planet on both those days, and noted its place (among\r\nthose of other stars) for re-observation. He, however, postponed the\r\n_comparison_ of the places observed, and not possessing Dr. Bremiker’s\r\nchart (which would at once have indicated the presence of an unmapped\r\nstar), remained in ignorance of the planet’s existence as a visible\r\nobject till the announcement of such by Dr. Galle.\r\n\r\n[21] For several interesting details of Comets, see “Destruction of the\r\nWorld by a Comet,” in _Popular Errors Explained and Illustrated_, new\r\nedit. pp. 165-168.\r\n\r\n[22] The letters of Sir Isaac Newton to Dr. Bentley, containing\r\nsuggestions for the Boyle Lectures, possess a peculiar interest in the\r\npresent day. “They show” (says Sir David Brewster) “that the _nebular\r\nhypothesis_, the dull and dangerous heresy of the age, is incompatible\r\nwith the established laws of the material universe, and that an\r\nomnipotent arm was required to give the planets their positions and\r\nmotions in space, and a presiding intelligence to assign to them the\r\ndifferent functions they had to perform.”--_Life of Newton_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[23] The constitution of the nebulæ in the constellation of Orion has\r\nbeen resolved by this instrument; and by its aid the stars of which it\r\nis composed burst upon the sight of man for the first time.\r\n\r\n[24] Several specimens of Meteoric Iron are to be seen in the\r\nMineralogical Collection in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[25] _Life of Sir Isaac Newton_, vol. i. p. 62.\r\n\r\n[26] _Description of the Monster Telescope_, by Thomas Woods, M.D. 4th\r\nedit. 1851.\r\n\r\n[27] This instrument also discovered a multitude of new objects in the\r\nmoon; as a mountainous tract near Ptolemy, every ridge of which is\r\ndotted with extremely minute craters, and two black parallel stripes in\r\nthe bottom of Aristarchus. Dr. Robinson, in his address to the British\r\nAssociation in 1843, stated that in this telescope a building the size\r\nof the Court-house at Cork would be easily visible on the lunar surface.\r\n\r\n[28] Mr. Hopkins supports his Glacial Theory by regarding the _Waves\r\nof Translation_, investigated by Mr. Scott Russell, as furnishing\r\na sufficient moving power for the transportation of large rounded\r\nboulders, and the formation of drifted gravel. When these waves of\r\ntranslation are produced by the sudden elevation of the surface of\r\nthe sea, the whole mass of water from the surface to the bottom of\r\nthe ocean moves onward, and becomes a mechanical agent of enormous\r\npower. Following up this view, Mr. Hopkins has shown that “elevations\r\nof continental masses of only 50 feet each, and from beneath an ocean\r\nhaving a depth of between 300 and 400 feet, would cause the most\r\npowerful divergent waves, which could transport large boulders to great\r\ndistances.”\r\n\r\n[29] It is scarcely too much to say, that from the collection of\r\nspecimens of building-stones made upon this occasion, and first\r\ndeposited in a house in Craig’s Court, Charing Cross, originated,\r\nupon the suggestion of Sir Henry Delabeche, the magnificent Museum of\r\nPractical Geology in Jermyn Street; one of the most eminently practical\r\ninstitutions of this scientific age.\r\n\r\n[30] Mr. R. Mallet, F.R.S., and his son Dr. Mallet, have constructed a\r\nseismographic map of the world, with seismic bands in their position\r\nand relative intensity; and small black discs to denote volcanoes,\r\nfemaroles, and soltataras, and shades indicating the areas of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\n[31] It has been computed that the shock of this earthquake pervaded\r\nan area of 700,000 miles, or the twelfth part of the circumference of\r\nthe globe. This dreadful shock lasted only five minutes; and nearly\r\nthe whole of the population being within the churches (on the feast of\r\nAll Saints), no less than 30,000 persons perished by the fall of these\r\nedifices.--See _Daubeny on Volcanoes_; _Translator’s note, Humboldt’s\r\nCosmos_.\r\n\r\n[32] Mr. Murray mentions, on the authority of the Rev. Dr. Robinson,\r\nof the Observatory at Armagh, that a rough diamond with a red tint,\r\nand valued by Mr. Rundell at twenty guineas, was found in Ireland,\r\nmany years since, in the bed of a brook flowing through the county of\r\nFermanagh.\r\n\r\n[33] The use of malachite in ornamental work is very extensive in\r\nRussia. Thus, to the Great Exhibition of 1851 were sent a pair of\r\nfolding-doors veneered with malachite, 13 feet high, valued at\r\n6000_l._; malachite cases and pedestals from 1500_l._ to 3000_l._\r\na-piece, malachite tables 400_l._, and chairs 150_l._ each.\r\n\r\n[34] Longfellow has written some pleasing lines on “The Fiftieth\r\nBirthday of M. Agassiz. May 28, 1857,” appended to “The Courtship of\r\nMiles Standish,” 1858.\r\n\r\n[35] The _sloth_ only deserves its name when it is obliged to attempt\r\nto proceed along the ground; when it has any thing which it can lay\r\nhold of it is agile enough.\r\n\r\n[36] Dr. A. Thomson has communicated to _Jameson’s Journal_, No. 112,\r\na Description of the Caves in the North Island, with some general\r\nobservations on this genus of birds. He concludes them to have been\r\nindolent, dull, and stupid; to have lived chiefly on vegetable food in\r\nmountain fastnesses and secluded caverns.\r\n\r\nIn the picture-gallery at Drayton Manor, the seat of Sir Robert Peel,\r\nhangs a portrait of Professor Owen, and in his hand is depicted the\r\ntibia of a Moa.\r\n\r\n[37] According to the law of correlation, so much insisted on by\r\nCuvier, a superior character implies the existence of its inferiors,\r\nand that too in definite proportions and constant connections; so\r\nthat we need only the assurance of one character, to be able to\r\nreconstruct the whole animal. The triumph of this system is seen in\r\nthe reconstruction of extinct animals, as in the above case of the\r\nDinornis, accomplished by Professor Owen.\r\n\r\n[38] Not only at London, but at Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Turin. St.\r\nPetersburg, and almost every other capital in Europe; at Liege, Caen,\r\nMontpellier, Toulouse, and several other large towns,--wherever,\r\nin fact, there are not great local obstacles,--the tendency of the\r\nwealthier inhabitants to group themselves to the west is as strongly\r\nmarked as in the British metropolis. At Pompeii, and other ancient\r\ntowns, the same thing maybe noticed; and where the local configuration\r\nof the town necessitates an increase in a different direction, the\r\nmoment the obstacle ceases houses spread towards the west.\r\n\r\n[39] By far the most complete set of experiments on the Radiation\r\nof Heat from the Earth’s Surface at Night which have been published\r\nsince Dr. Wells’s Memoir _On Dew_, are those of Mr. Glaisher, F.R.S.,\r\n_Philos. Trans._ for 1847.\r\n\r\n[40] The author is largely indebted for the illustrations in this new\r\nfield of research to Lieutenant Maury’s valuable work, _The Physical\r\nGeography of the Sea_. Sixth edition. Harper, New York; Low, Son, and\r\nCo., London.\r\n\r\n[41] It is the chloride of magnesia which gives that damp sticky\r\nfeeling to the clothes of sailors that are washed or wetted with salt\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[42] This fraction rests on the assumption that the dilatation of the\r\nsubstances of which the earth is composed is equal to that of glass,\r\nthat is to say, 1/18000 for 1°. Regarding this hypothesis, see Arago,\r\nin the _Annuaire_ for 1834, pp. 177-190.\r\n\r\n[43] Electricity, traversing excessively rarefied air or vapours,\r\ngives out light, and doubtless also heat. May not a continual current\r\nof electric matter be constantly circulating in the sun’s immediate\r\nneighbourhood, or traversing the planetary spaces, and exerting in the\r\nupper regions of its atmosphere those phenomena of which, on however\r\ndiminutive a scale, we have yet an unequivocal manifestation in our\r\nAurora Borealis?\r\n\r\n[44] Could we by mechanical pressure force water into a solid state, an\r\nimmense quantity of heat would be set free.\r\n\r\n[45] See Mr. Hunt’s popular work, _The Poetry of Science; or, Studies\r\nof Physical Phenomena of Nature_. Third edition, revised and enlarged.\r\nBohn, 1854.\r\n\r\n[46] Canton was the first who in England verified Dr. Franklin’s idea\r\nof the similarity of lightning and the electric fluid, July 1752.\r\n\r\n[47] This is mentioned in _Procli Diadochi Paraphrasis Ptolem._, 1635.\r\n(Delambre, _Hist. de l’Astronomie ancienne_.)\r\n\r\n[48] The first Variation-Compass was constructed, before 1525, by an\r\ningenious apothecary of Seville, Felisse Guillen. So earnest were\r\nthe endeavours to learn more exactly the direction of the curves of\r\nmagnetic declination, that in 1585 Juan Jayme sailed with Francisco\r\nGali from Manilla to Acapulco, for the sole purpose of trying in the\r\nPacific a declination instrument which he had invented.--_Humboldt._\r\n\r\n[49] Gilbert was surgeon to Queen Elizabeth and James I., and died\r\nin 1603. Whewell justly assigns him an important place among the\r\n“practical reformers of the physical sciences.” He adopted the\r\nCopernican doctrine, which Lord Bacon’s inferior aptitude for physical\r\nresearch led him to reject.\r\n\r\n[50] This illustration, it will be seen, does not literally correspond\r\nwith the details which precede it.\r\n\r\n[51] Mr. Crosse gave to the meeting a general invitation to Fyne Court;\r\none of the first to accept which was Sir Richard Phillips, who, on\r\nhis return to Brighton, described in a very attractive manner, at the\r\nSussex Institution, Mr. Crosse’s experiments and apparatus; a report of\r\nwhich being communicated to the _Brighton Herald_, was quoted in the\r\n_Literary Gazette_, and thence copied generally into the newspapers of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n[52] These experiments were performed at the expense of the Royal\r\nSociety, and cost 10_l._ 5_s._ 6_d._ In the Paper detailing the\r\nexperiments, printed in the 45th volume of the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_, occurs the first mention of Dr. Franklin’s name, and of\r\nhis theory of positive and negative electricity.--_Weld’s Hist. Royal\r\nSoc._ vol. i. p. 467.\r\n\r\n[53] In this year Andrew Crosse said: “I prophesy that by means of\r\nthe electric agency we shall be enabled to communicate our thoughts\r\ninstantaneously with the uttermost parts of the earth.”\r\n\r\n[54] To which paper the writer is indebted for many of these details.\r\n\r\n[55] These illustrations have been in the main selected and abridged\r\nfrom papers in the _Companion to the Almanac_, 1858, and the _Penny\r\nCyclopædia_, 2d supp.\r\n\r\n[56] Newton was, however, much pestered with inquirers; and a\r\nCorrespondent of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, in 1784, relates that he\r\nonce had a transient view of a Ms. in Pope’s handwriting, in which\r\nhe read a verified anecdote relating to the above period. Sir Isaac\r\nbeing often interrupted by ignorant pretenders to the discovery of\r\nthe longitude, ordered his porter to inquire of every stranger who\r\ndesired admission whether he came about the longitude, and to exclude\r\nsuch as answered in the affirmative. Two lines in Pope’s Ms., as the\r\nCorrespondent recollects, ran thus:\r\n\r\n    “‘Is it about the longitude you come?’\r\n    The porter asks: ‘Sir Isaac’s not at home.’”\r\n\r\n[57] In trying the merits of Harrison’s chronometers, Dr. Maskelyne\r\nacquired that knowledge of the wants of nautical astronomy which\r\nafterwards led to the formation of the Nautical Almanac.\r\n\r\n[58] A slight electric shock is given to a man at a certain portion of\r\nthe skin; and he is directed the moment he feels the stroke to make a\r\ncertain motion, as quickly as he possibly can, with the hands or with\r\nthe teeth, by which the time-measuring current is interrupted.\r\n\r\n[59] Through the calculations of M.

hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nSome numbers in equations include a hyphen to separate the fractional\r\nand integer parts. These are not minus signs, which, like other\r\narithmetic operators, are surrounded by spaces.\r\n\r\nThe original book apparently used a smaller font for multiple reasons,\r\nbut as those reasons were not always clear to the Transcriber, smaller\r\ntext is indented by 2 spaces in the Plain Text version of this eBook,\r\nand is displayed smaller in other versions.\r\n\r\nFootnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been collected and\r\nrepositioned just before the Index.\r\n\r\nPage 59: “95 × 1·623 = 154·185” was misprinted as “95 + 1·623 =\r\n154·185” and has been corrected here.\r\n\r\nThe Table of Contents does not list the “Phenomena of Heat” chapter,\r\nwhich begins on page 185; nor the Index, which begins on page 242.\r\n\r\nPage 95: “adjustible” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 151: Missing closing quotation mark added after “rapidly evaporate\r\nin space.” It may belong elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPage 221: Missing closing quotation mark not added for phrase beginning\r\n“it is a fine invention”.",
